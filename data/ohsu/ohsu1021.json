  ".W": "Over 12 years, 136 episodes of bacteremia caused by clostridial species were documented. Eighty-three were monomicrobial, and 53 were polymicrobial. Gastrointestinal, genitourinary carcinomas, and acute leukemia were the most common underlying malignancies. Septic shock occurred in 29% of monomicrobial bacteremias and 45% of polymicrobial bacteremias and was associated with a high mortality rate. Acute hemolysis, gas gangrene, and diffuse spreading cellulitis occurred infrequently but were associated with a 100% fatality rate. Many infections caused by Clostridium perfringens and C. septicum were associated with abdominal disease. The most commonly isolated organism was C. perfringens, followed by C. septicum and C. sporogenes. Overall survival was 58%, but it was 66% for monomicrobial episodes and 45% for polymicrobial infections. All of the patients with bacteremia due to an aerobic gram-negative bacillus in addition to the clostridial species died of their infection. The most effective antibiotics were clindamycin, penicillin, metronidazole, and moxalactam. Surgical drainage of abscesses was an important component of therapy.\r"

Dramatic responses to interferon-alpha and 2'-deoxycoformycin overshadow the established role of splenectomy in HCL, and patients currently can avoid surgery altogether. A case is presented of clinical remission lasting 32 years after splenectomy--a prolonged normal life, without medication or medical intervention. When relapse occurred, the patient's response to interferon-alpha was prompt and predictable. Prognostic variables are an important consideration at the time of diagnosis in predicting the response to splenectomy.\r"

The first known case is reported of extramedullary blastic transformation in a patient with medullary complete cytogenetic response (0% Ph-positive metaphases) to IFN-A. Four episodes of extramedullary blast crisis have occurred in this patient. The first three episodes were lymphoid by morphology and cytochemical stains. Molecular analysis confirmed breakpoint cluster region rearrangement. The most recent transformation was myeloid in nature and involved bone and pulmonary parenchyma. The patient is currently undergoing a second autologous transplantation with stored bone marrow that is Ph negative. The patient has survived more than 18 months since the first episode of blast crisis, and the bone marrow is normal.\r"

  ".W": "Available information suggests that individuals with breast cancer gain weight during adjuvant treatment and that this weight gain may be associated with poor prognosis. Exploration of the factors which affect weight gain may aid in developing weight control interventions for these patients. To determine the factors which are associated with weight gain, 32 women undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy were followed over 2 years from the beginning of adjuvant treatment. Measures of psychologic functioning and self-reports of exercise levels and eating were assessed every 2 months during the course of treatment. Sixty-nine percent of the women gained weight over treatment, resulting in a significant weight gain for the group as a whole. Weight gain was correlated positively with several psychologic measures but not with assessed biologic measures. A multiple-regression equation using psychologic/behavioural measures of emotional discharge, logical analysis, affective regulation, interpersonal sensitivity, average number of symptoms, and obsessive compulsiveness accounted for 58% of the variance in overall weight gain. At 2 years of follow-up, 27 women had gained weight for an average of 6.03 kg. The coping style of logical analysis emerged as a significant predictor of disease recurrence, accounting for 28% of the variance in weight gain at 2 years. The results are discussed in terms of identification of women likely to gain weight during adjuvant treatment, directions for future research, and development of interventions to control weight gain.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the potential role of sex steroid hormones in the development of colorectal tumors in humans, specific androgen (AR), estrogen (ER), and progesterone (PGR) receptors were investigated in normal mucosa (NM) and in tumor (T) paired biopsy specimens from 94 patients. Androgen receptors were detected in 98% and 96% of NM and T samples, ER in 91% and 83% of NM and T biopsy samples, whereas PGR were detected only in 14% and 10% of NM and T specimens, respectively. These incidences are independent of the sex and age of the patients. They are not related to tumor localization, histologic grade, or stages of Dukes' classification. Scatchard analysis of labeled ligand binding indicated the existence of one single class of high affinity binding sites; the calculated dissociation constant (Kd) was 1.7 +/- 0.6 10(-9) molar concentration (M) for 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and 0.6 +/- 0.3 10(-9) M for estradiol (E2). These values were identical in NM and T tissue for both AR and ER. The binding capacity for DHT was 148 +/- 67 and 93 +/- 43 fmol/mg of cytosol protein in NM and T tissues, respectively (P less than 0.05). The ER content was lower and similar in NM and T biopsy specimens: 19 +/- 9 and 18 +/- 10 fmol/mg protein, respectively. The PGR content was 10 +/- 4 in NM versus 17.5 +/- 6 fmol/mg protein in T specimens. It is observed that the elevated AR in normal mucosa is not related to any known function for androgens in the digestive tract. The receptor pattern observed in tumors does not support the hypothesis previously raised in the case of chemically induced colonic tumors in rodents.\r"

An overview is presented of clinical and pathologic data of 55 patients who were registered at the CNR until July 1, 1988. All Netherlands Departments of Pathology (NDP) maintain a patient registry and 95% of the Institutes are connected with a Central Archive via a computer network. The histologic slides and clinical status were reviewed at the CNR. Twenty-five tumors were classified as vaginal carcinoma and 30 as cervical carcinoma. The mean age of the patients was 22 years. Fifty-five percent of patients (63% of patients with known maternal history) were exposed to diethylstilbestrol (DES) in utero. The majority of cases was initially diagnosed after 1980. Cytologic examination before the initial histologic diagnosis indicated that cervical tumors were detected in 80% of cases, but vaginal tumors were detected only in 33% of cases. It was concluded that an examination of DES-exposed women should consist of colposcopic inspection of the cervix and vagina, cytologic examination of the cervix and four quadrants of the vagina, and careful palpation of the cervix and the entire vaginal wall. The most important prognostic parameter for patients with CCAC was stage and grade of nuclear atypia. The results of a statistical analysis showed that these features were the most effective to distinguish between nonsurvivors and patients surviving more than 5 years.\r"

The median interval between the occurrence of the first and subsequent PCMM in these patients was 1.93 years. The estimated 5-year survival rate from the first melanoma was 83.5%; that from the last melanoma was 53.1%. In summary, MPCMM is a distinct biologic phenomenon. A second or subsequent malignant melanoma should be treated like a primary melanoma.\r"

Whereas sun-induced freckles in children and older adults may be clinically indistinguishable, and sun-induced freckles in older adults usually consist of increased numbers of intraepidermal melanocytes, the histology of sun-induced freckles in children remains unsettled. Using L-3,4 dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)-paraffin sections, the authors examined six sun-induced freckles and adjacent nonpigmented skin (ANP) in as many white male subjects, ages 10 to 23 years. Melanocyte frequency was expressed as the ratio of DOPA-reactive melanocytes to total epidermal basal unit cells. For each case, melanocyte frequencies in freckles were significantly greater than in ANP. Cellular atypia of melanocytes was noticed in four of six freckles. Reactivity of melanocytes for HMB-45 was noticed in two freckles studied, compared with no reactivity in three specimens of ANP studied. The authors conclude the sun-induced freckles in the young may consist of a hyperplasia of melanocytes (i.e., similar to solar lentigines in the elderly), sometimes with cellular atypia, and that these findings may be relevant to melanocytic neoplasia.\r"

Compared with the general population, NHL patients were at a significantly increased risk of developing second cancers (observed/expected [O/E] = 1.18; O = 1231). The O/E ratio increased significantly with time to reach 1.77 in 10-year survivors. Significant excesses were noted for acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (O/E = 2.88), cancers of the bladder (O/E = 1.30), kidney (O/E = 1.47), and lung (O/E = 1.57), malignant melanoma (O/E = 2.44), and Hodgkin's disease (O/E = 4.16). Chemotherapy appeared related to subsequent acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) and bladder cancer. Radiation therapy was associated with ANLL and possibly cancers of the lung, bladder, and bone. Malignant melanoma was not clearly related to initial NHL treatment.\r"

From 45% to 52% of women in their 40s, 50s, and 60s had ever had a mammogram, and 55% to 57% intended to have one in the next year. Thirty-seven percent of women aged 70 to 74 years had ever had a mammogram, and 40% intended to have one in the following year. Nineteen percent of physicians reported screening nearly all women aged 30 to 39 years, and 14% screened few women aged 50 to 74 years. Younger women were more worried about breast cancer than older women and assessed their risk as higher, attitudes that were generally associated with higher mammography utilization. These community surveys suggest that mammography use may be excessive among younger women; older women continue to be underscreened.\r"

From 1977 to 1985, 42 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal were treated with mitomycin C (15 mg/m2) and 5-fluorouracil (750 mg/m2) on day 1, 5-FU (750 mg/m2/d) alone on days 2 to 5, and radiation therapy (3000 cGy) on days 7 to 28. They were evaluated 4 to 6 weeks after completion of the chemotherapy/radiation therapy protocol and received local excision, abdominoperineal resection, or both. Patient follow-up times ranged from 7 to 161 months, with a mean follow-up time of 71 months. Pathologic examination showed no residual carcinoma in 19 (45%) patients. The authors could not predict, based on clinical evaluation, which patients would have a complete response. Of the patients with a complete clinical response, 44% had tumor in the pathology specimen. Wide local excision was the most common initial operation (23 of 42 patients; 55%), with five of these patients subsequently requiring abdominoperineal resection. Anal continence was retained in 18 of 42 (43%) patients. Eleven patients experienced recurrent disease: six local recurrences, one distant, and four both local and distant. The 5-year overall survival rate was 82% and the 5-year disease-specific survival rate was 87%. There were no treatment related deaths. Preoperative tumor size was the only factor significantly related to survival. Contrary to other reports, tumor in the pathology specimen did not adversely affect long-term survival. Hence, patients should be treated after chemotherapy/radiation therapy with surgical therapy sufficient to control local disease.\r"

  ".W": "The authors assessed the potential benefit of postoperative radiation therapy for rectal cancer in a two-arm, prospective multicenter trial. One hundred seventy-two patients who had undergone surgical resection for rectal adenocarcinoma were randomly assigned to either treatment consisting of external irradiation to a dose of 5000 cGy in 5 weeks or a control group (no adjuvant therapy). It was assumed that the number of cells remaining after radical surgery would be low and that the dose of 5000 cGy would be adequate in eradicating the majority of those cells. The number of local recurrences was lower in the treated group of patients, but the difference was not statistically significant. It was assumed that if a significant reduction in the number of local recurrences could be obtained, improved (disease-free) survival would result. No influence on disease-free or overall survival could be detected. These results were in agreement with those reported in Europe and the US, and it was concluded that postoperative radiation therapy alone cannot be justified as a routine procedure in the primary management of resectable rectal cancer.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred forty-nine patients with poor risk nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCT) treated between 1975 and 1988 were studied. Patients were considered poor risk if they had an extragonadal primary site or testicular NSGCT with low predicted probability of achieving a complete response (CR). Primary sites were the testis (99 patients), retroperitoneum (18 patients), and mediastinum (32 patients). Patients with mediastinal NSGCT had lower human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) (P less than 0.0001) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (P less than 0.0001), and more frequent yolk sac elements (P = 0.002). CR rates were 38% for mediastinal, 61% for retroperitoneal, and 38% for testicular primary sites. Mediastinal NSGCT patients more frequently required resection of residual malignancy to attain a CR (6 of 12). Mediastinal NSGCT had the worst event-free survival (P = 0.02). Cox regression analysis identified brain or liver metastases as the most important predictor of event-free survival in poor risk patients. Retroperitoneal NSGCT often have a poor outcome due to advanced presentation, but the likelihood of a CR to therapy can be predicted using criteria applicable to testicular primary tumors. Therefore, not all retroperitoneal NSGCT are poor risk, and retroperitoneal tumors are probably of occult testicular origin. Mediastinal NSGCT have distinct clinical and pathologic features, do not respond as well to chemotherapy, relapse more frequently, and have the worst survival. The likelihood of a CR cannot be predicted using criteria developed for primary testicular tumors, suggesting that mediastinal primary NSGCT is a distinct clinical entity.\r"

These patients had not received cranial irradiation and had no evidence of CNS leukemia before or after these episodes. Ischemic changes on computerized tomographic scan or magnetic resonance imaging studies were documented in all three cases. Such changes are unusual manifestations of neurotoxicity in children after intrathecal therapy.\r"

Intrathecal methotrexate administration results in potentially toxic systemic methotrexate levels which persist longer than an equivalent systemic dose.

A common feature was a duration of T-cell and B-cell lymphopenia after therapy. The findings relating to the T-cell subsets were interesting. Although the CD4/CD8 ratio remained unchanged in Stages I/IIA for 24 months after treatment, patients with Stages IIB and III showed a lowering of the ratio immediately after treatment. Distinctive patterns of lymphocyte subset distribution were seen in a comparison between patients who were disease-free and those with recurrent disease. The CD4+ cell counts and CD4/CD8 ratio differed between the two groups, with consistent lowered values during the follow-up associated with recurrent disease. This study demonstrates the effects of radiation therapy in altering lymphocyte subset distribution, resulting in characteristic patterns which could be used as clinical and prognostic indicators.\r"

  ".W": "Between 1980 and 1988, 122 women with operable invasive breast cancers underwent wide excision and axillary dissection without subsequent irradiation. During the follow-up period of 1 to 8 years (median, 4 years), recurrences were observed in 23 patients (19%), 22 occurring in the breast and one in the axilla. This is a significant rate of recurrence and supports the need for breast irradiation after conservative surgery. The incidence of recurrence in the breast did not appear to be related to the presence or absence of axillary nodal metastasis. No recurrences were noted in 20 patients whose primary tumors were smaller than 1 cm. The incidence of recurrence was directly correlated to the increasing size of the tumor, but it also appeared to decrease with advancing age. In 31 patients over 70 years of age, only one (3%) recurrence was observed. If these early findings are confirmed, it is likely that patients with tumors smaller than 1 cm or patients over 70 years of age may be spared breast irradiation after wide excision.\r"

  ".W": "The authors analyzed the relationship between treatment, local recurrence, and metastases in a population-based series of 375 patients with soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities and the trunk wall. Treatment was inadequate (marginal excision alone) in 107 patients, local recurrence occurred in 112, and 128 patients developed metastases. Local recurrence was 3.5 times more common after inadequate treatment than after adequate and 2.5 times more common in patients with metastases than in those without. However, metastases were only 1.2 times more common after inadequate treatment than after adequate. Of the 128 patients who developed metastases, 63 had local recurrence and 65 had not. In these two subgroups the timing of metastases and the distribution of clinicopathologic factors--age, sex, tumor size, localization, depth, histotype, and malignancy grade--were similar. These findings indicate that local recurrence is of minor importance for development of metastases in soft tissue sarcoma. The increased local recurrence rate in metastatic tumors may be an expression of the aggressiveness of the primary tumor; highly malignant tumors combine a potential both for local and distant spread.\r"

  ".W": "The prediction of tumour biology rarely rests upon a single characteristic of the malignancy. The analysis of a single gene can complement standard histologic evaluation. The investigation of new parameters as well as the routine clinical analysis of gene expression is often limited because of the small amount of tissue available. This is particularly true of de novo human bladder cancers because they are generally small or handled in such a way as to hinder the analysis of multiple different parameters. Analysis of expressed mRNA by the polymerase chain reaction (RNA/PCR) is a method that allows the development of a profile of bladder cancer gene expression. The authors report the use of the RNA/PCR method to examine in bladder cancer the expression of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II gene family (HLA-DR, DQ, and DP) as well as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R). All de novo transitional cell carcinomas, one squamous carcinoma, and two transitional cell carcinoma cell lines expressed the majority of HLA class II genes. All samples expressed IL-6R RNA whereas production of IL-6 message was limited to one of the cell lines and to the high-grade bladder cancers. These results were combined with stage, grade, and DNA content to develop a profile of the cancers examined. Although an improved predictive index based on gene expression analysis by RNA/PCR has not been realized, a broader survey of human tumors for expression of these genes and others is likely to refine the classification of bladder cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Hyperthermia has been shown in vitro and in vivo to potentiate the effects of ionizing irradiation. Previous studies found that hyperthermia alters the metabolism of adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose polymers required for recovery from DNA damage and that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity is very sensitive to cellular nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD) levels. Thus, the effect of 41.8 degrees C hyperthermia in vitro and in vivo on NAD and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels was studied in human peripheral lymphocytes. In vitro studies showed significant decreases in oxidized NAD (NAD+) and ATP levels after heating that simulated a clinical whole-body hyperthermia (WBH) treatment. This nucleotide depletion could not be attributed to nucleotide leakage or increased enzymatic NAD+ consumption. As the reduction of NAD observed was sufficient to decrease poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase activity by 50%, the studies were extended to clinica cases. Cellular NAD+ and ATP were measured in previously stored lymphocytes obtained from four patients before and after WBH; a statistically significant decrease in NAD+ was observed after WBH which quantitatively agreed with the in vitro results. Based on these results a prospective study was done in three patients; NAD+ was extracted immediately on sample collection, and the kinetics of WBH-induced NAD depletion were studied. These data, which agree quantitatively with the laboratory results, are presented.\r"

Cytogenetic and molecular genetic examinations were performed in addition to the morphologic and immunologic approach. The expression of CD2 and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements indicated the T-cell origin of this case. CD30, which is positive for anaplastic large cell lymphoma (Ki-1 lymphoma), was not expressed. The cytogenetic study revealed a clonal chromosome abnormality involving 3q25, 6p21, 11p15, and 11q21. An N-ras point mutation within codon 12 (GGT----GCT) was also detected. These finding indicate that MH defined clinically and morphologically is not a tumor of true histiocytic origin and that it should be reclassified on the basis of immunologic, cytogenetic, and molecular genetic data.\r"

The bizarre stromal cells were usually distributed beneath the ulcerated mucosa or within granulation tissue. They stained strongly for vimentin in 20 of 23 cases. Some of the bizarre cells also stained for muscle specific actin (seven of 23 cases). The cells appear to be reactive fibroblasts or myofibroblasts. Follow-up information obtained on 24 of the 33 patients (including four of the six cases initially diagnosed as malignant) revealed 22 patients to be alive without evidence of a malignant neoplasm (average follow-up, 13 months). Two patients died of other causes. Correct recognition of these bizarre stromal cells in gastrointestinal ulcers and inflammatory polyps will prevent a potentially serious diagnostic pitfall.\r"

The authors studied 15 cases treated with radical prostatectomy to define more completely their pathologic features and determine the clinical outcome in these surgically treated patients. The study included morphometry and DNA image analysis using the CAS-200 system. The most common presentation was urinary outlet obstruction (n = 9), and most patients were clinical Stage B with palpable prostatic lesions (n = 12). Compared with acinar cancers of similar clinical stage, duct cancers were large (tumor volume, 8.4 +/- 10.0 cc) and occupied a large portion of the gland (23 +/- 21%). Duct cancers were in an advanced final pathologic stage with 93% having capsular penetration, 47% positive margins, 40% seminal vesicle invasion, and 27% positive pelvic lymph nodes. The DNA analysis on cells disaggregated from paraffin revealed that 54% of cases were diploid, 15% tetraploid, 8% aneuploid, and 23% tetraploid/aneuploid. On clinical follow-up, eight patients had no evidence of tumor at intervals ranging from 1 to 28 months, and seven patients (47%) had persistent tumor at intervals of 3 to 18 months. This study demonstrates that duct cancers are in an advanced pathologic stage by the time of presentation and have a much higher short-term failure rate after radical prostatectomy compared with acinar cancers.\r"

There were 28 American Indians (14%), 91 Hispanic whites (46%), and 77 non-Hispanic whites (39%). Median survivals for patients undergoing antileukemic therapy ranged from 8 months for American Indian boys to 140 months for non-Hispanic white girls. American Indian boys had the highest initial median leukocyte count (WBC) at 23.8 X 10(9)/l. Compliance problems occurred most commonly among American Indian children of both genders. Other clinical and pathologic features evaluated in this study were distributed similarly among the ethnic gender groups. Multi-variate analysis revealed that independent prognostic variables for survival included initial WBC, age, and gender. Ethnicity and compliance problems were possible, but confounded, prognostic variables. To the authors' knowledge this represents the most comprehensive study to date of ALL in American Indian patients.\r"

In the 805 thyroid nodules in which an adequate cytologic specimen was obtained, false-negative results were 2.3% and false-positive findings were 1.1% By comparing cytologic and histologic diagnoses, preoperative FNAB resulted in the ability to accurately assess the risk of cancer in a thyroid nodule; since 250 nodules were identified as malignant, the risk of a \"cold\" thyroid nodule being cancer was 4.46% in this series.\r"

Neu oncogene expression of a mRNA species of 4.6 kilobases was found in all normal salivary (five) and mammary glands (four) as well as in two normal or inflamed samples of tongue mucosa. This expression was regarded as baseline activity of the neu gene for the respective tissues and was used as standard for the evaluation of benign and malignant tumors. None of 14 squamous cell carcinomas of the oral and laryngeal mucosa showed enhanced neu transcription level. Five fibroadenomas, one benign variant of phylloid tumor, one carcinosarcoma, and one of two proliferative fibrocystic diseases of the breast showed lacking or normal baseline expression of the neu oncogene, as did one monomorphous cystadenolymphoma of the parotid gland. In contrast, four parotid pleomorphic adenomas and one salivary gland adenocarcinoma showed enhanced neu expression. For mammary adenocarcinomas, increased neu oncogene expression concerned ten of 34 cases--all being variants of ductal carcinomas--and all metastases analyzed (six) deriving from three primaries. One adenoid cystic carcinoma also showed enhanced neu expression. Neu overexpression may reflect accidents of genomic reconstitutional events occurring regularly within the differentiation pathway of epithelial/myoepithelial cells. This assumption was supported by further immunohistochemical analysis which showed stainings of myoepithelial and myoepithelia-like cell populations in tumors, especially pleomorphic adenomas and adjacent normal-looking tissues.\r"

In a prospective study of 261 occult breast lesions, aspiration biopsy was done with a standard fine needle and syringe. This \"scouting needle\" technique permits the collection of diagnostic cytologic material in the clinician's office without specialized radiologic equipment. Thirty of 53 malignant lesions (57%) were detected cytologically. A benign cytologic diagnosis, which was made in 220 patients, did not preclude additional investigation. Aspiration biopsy using the \"scouting needle\" is a rapid, low-cost, easily performed, initial procedure which complements \"watchful waiting.\" When diagnostic of carcinoma, it results in immediate surgical intervention and may obviate two-stage surgical treatment.\r"

Clinical and pathologic data of those patients (one female and two male; age range, 49-74 years) were analyzed. Tumors were localized in the middle third of the esophagus. One patient lived 15 months after surgery. Another is a case of early ACC who has been living 4.5 years after surgery and is without specific symptoms. The third patient had not had surgery and died 13 months after the onset of dysphagia. An autopsy showed only a locally invasive tumor growing into the surroundings of the esophagus, and regional lymph node metastases without distant parenchymal metastases. These findings support pathologic and biologic similarities between ACC of the esophagus and ACC of the salivary glands. There are synchronous tumors of the esophagus and the vital localization which makes the prognosis of ACC of the esophagus worse than ACC of the salivary glands.\r"

The clinicopathologic features of 72 cases treated at one institution are reported; 22 cases were evaluated immunohistochemically. Twenty-four tumors were urachal and 48 nonurachal. The cases were analyzed according to their stage at presentation, histologic type, and mucin staining; they were tested immunohistochemically to determine their reaction to carcinoembryonic antigen, Leu-M1, prostate-specific antigen, and prostatic acid phosphatase. Tumor stage was a highly significant predictor of outcome (P = 0.001). Nonurachal tumors tended to have a worse outcome than urachal, but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.07). Histologic type was not a significant predictor of outcome (P = 0.10). For adenocarcinoma of the urinary bladder, stage was the most significant predictive factor; separating urachal from nonurachal tumors was important, but mucin histochemistry and immunohistochemistry did not help in this distinction. On occasion, a few tumors may react with some polyclonal antibodies to prostate-specific antigen; thus these results must be interpreted with caution. In these instances, the possibility of using highly sensitive and specific monoclonal antibodies such as the one employed in this study should be considered.\r"

Diploidy was expressed in six sarcomas and it conferred a longer survival (mean, 68.6 months) than aneuploid sarcomas (mean, 8.2 months). For comparison, 13 metastases to soft tissues from cutaneous melanomas were assessed by flow cytometric study. The aneuploid neoplasms of both entities were categorized into low and high degree based on extent of the DNA index (DI). Low degree was defined by a DI of less than or equal to 1.5 and high degree by a DI of greater than 1.5. Significant differences in DNA content between CCS and metastatic melanomas were observed. Melanomas were preponderantly aneuploid (11/13) of high degree (mean DI, 1.7) whereas CCS manifested more diploidy (six of 11) and their aneuploidy was of a low degree (mean DI, 1.2; P = 0.001). Clear cell sarcomas and melanomas were also examined for their immunoreactivity to S-100 protein and HMB-45 antigen. All CCS reacted with S-100 protein and HMB-45. In CCS the reactions were diffuse for both in six tumors, diffuse with HMB-45 and moderate to S-100 protein in three tumors and diffuse with S-100 and moderate with HMB-45 in two tumors. All melanomas reacted diffusely to S-100 protein except for one heavily pigmented tumor which reacted only focally. The reaction to HMB-45 was diffuse in nine and focal in three melanomas. These data suggest that measurements of DNA content in CCS may be valuable in predicting clinical outcome and that there are quantitative differences in DNA content between CCS and metastatic melanoma in soft tissues.\r"

Their objectives were to determine the value of serum sIL-2R in estimating the tumor burden, and its predictive value in response to therapy and prognosis. The data showed that serum sIL-2R levels in patients were significantly higher than that of healthy controls. The serum levels correlated with clinical staging and hence the tumor burden of NPC. Serial measurement of serum sIL-2R provided an accurate prognostic index of the clinical response to radiotherapy in at least 89% of patients with raised serum sIL-2R at initial diagnosis (defined as mean + 2 SD of healthy controls) and a reliable predictive index in all patients who subsequently developed distant metastasis despite initial radiotherapy. Simultaneous measurement of Epstein-Barr virus-related serology (IgA-VCA and IgG-EA) failed to demonstrate predictive value comparable with that of serum sIL-2R. The authors conclude that monitoring serum sIL-2R levels has clinical and prognostic significance in patients with NPC and that prospective studies are indicated.\r"

There were no papillary carcinomas observed in children younger than 10 years. The predominant mode of presentation was a solitary nodule of thyroid and some of them had associated cervical adenopathy. A considerable number presented with only cervical adenopathy. The incidence of nodal metastases was 50% at time of presentation and lung involvement was present in 15% of children at the time of diagnosis. Radioiodine treatment was given in 70% of children. Ablation was achieved in 86% of patients given two doses of radioiodine (200 millicuries). The more resistant cases were those with lung and nodal metastases. There was complete ablation in 100% with only residual thyroid tissue, 83% in those with associated nodal metastases, and 57% in those with lung involvement. Average duration of follow-up was 10.3 years (range, 2 to 19 years). Recurrence rate or relapse was observed in 8.5% and was in the regional nodes. There was no recorded mortality due to the disease.\r"

A 10-year retrospective review at the University of Washington Medical Center (Seattle, WA) and Swedish Hospital and Medical Center Tumor Registry (Seattle, WA) identified 14 patients with cerebral metastases from ovarian carcinoma. Median age at diagnosis of cerebral metastases was 52.5 years. Median interval from the diagnosis of ovarian carcinoma to the diagnosis of CNS metastases was 14.5 months. Seven patients had received cisplatin therapy before CNS relapse. Seven patients underwent second-look procedures before developing CNS metastases; in three, results were negative. Eight patients had evidence of extraperitoneal spread to other sites at the time of CNS relapse. Clinical manifestations included motor weakness, seizures, headache, confusion, and speech disturbance. All lesions were contrast enhancing on computed tomography (CT) scans and were located in the cerebral hemispheres. Nine patients had single lesions, five of whom underwent surgical resection of the lesion with histologic confirmation of metastases from the primary site. Median survival was 2 months in patients receiving radiation therapy alone and 17 months in patients who received surgery and radiation. Median survival of the entire series was 3 months. The presence of multiple cerebral metastases or evidence of extraperitoneal spread elsewhere in the body was adversely associated with survival. The prognosis of patients with cerebral metastases from ovarian carcinoma appears poor. However, early diagnosis by routine CT scanning followed by surgical resection and radiation may improve overall survival in a select group of patients.\r"

Also statistically significant was the correlation between serum PSA level and intracapsular versus extracapsular disease (P less than 0.00005), although no one value can be used to differentiate reliably between patients in these two categories. The probability of clinically detectable metastasis (Stage D2) is 85% if the serum PSA level is greater than 30; however, 12% of patients without clinical evidence of metastases (Stages A, B, and C) have such a serum PSA value. Despite the statistically significant association between PSA and tumor differentiation and volume as reflected by tumor grade and clinical stage, this marker cannot be used to determine either for an individual patient.\r"

Recent estimates of the frequency of world-wide traumatic events have determined that almost two million households annually experience damages and/or injuries from fire, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, and earthquakes alone. The population that is at risk is expected to grow exponentially with our expanding technology, making it even more vital to acquire knowledge to help the growing number of future disaster victims. Additionally, disaster research can contribute to a better understanding of PTSD and human coping processes that can be generalized to more ordinary stress situations. In the meantime, survivors of major catastrophes who experience acute symptoms of PTSD such as insomnia, nightmares, and jumpiness should be observed for nonresolution of symptoms over time, especially if there is a premorbid history of psychopathology or character problems. Otherwise, survivors may benefit from reassurance that PTSD symptoms are common in the short-term postdisaster period and that they can usually be expected to dissipate with time.\r"

  ".U": "91168859\r", 
  ".W": "A variety of analogs of 1,25-(OH)2D3 with less calcemic activity and lower receptor binding affinity than 1,25-(OH)2D3 have been developed. However, these compounds have equal or greater ability to differentiate leukemia cells and psoriatic fibroblasts and to suppress PTH synthesis and secretion. The mechanism for this selectivity has not been elucidated. Because the lower potency of ergocalciferol compared to cholecalciferol in preventing or curing rickets in chicks was associated with a lower affinity of the avian vitamin D binding protein (DBP) for vitamin D2, we tested five analogs with low calcemic activity including 22-oxa-1,25-(OH)2D3 (OCT), MC903, 1,25-(OH)2-16 ene-23-yne D3, 1,25-(OH)2-26,27 dihomo-22-ene-D3, and 1,25-(OH)2-24-trihomo-22-ene-D3 for their affinity for rat serum DBP. All analogs had a low affinity for DBP, ranging from 50-3000 times less than that of 1,25-(OH)2D3. OCT also bound with low affinity to dog and human serum DBP. We tested with OCT the possible consequences of its low affinity for serum DBP. One of the functions of DBP is to prolong the lifetime of 1,25-(OH)2D3 in circulation. Quantification of the metabolic clearance rate (MCR) of OCT in 8 normal dogs using a single bolus injection technique showed that OCT was cleared at a rate of 48.2 +/- 7.5 ml/min, approximately 6-7 times more rapidly than 1,25-(OH)2D3 (6.8 +/- 0.4 ml/min). The estimated half-life of OCT in the circulation was 2.5 +/- 0.3 h compared to 7.0 +/- 0.6; n = 7 for 1,25-(OH)2D3. As our primary interest is the potential of OCT in treating the secondary hyperparathyroidism of CRF, we also measured the MCR of OCT in 5/6 nephrectomized dogs. Uremia does not affect the rate of clearance of OCT from the circulation (MCR: 56.8 +/- 4.5; t1/2 = 2.1 +/- 0.2 n = 4). Despite its shorter half-life, OCT suppressed PTH secretion in vivo in uremic dogs. The effects of low binding to DBP on the percentage uremic dogs. The effects of low binding to DBP on the percentage of free sterol were determined using an ultrafiltration procedure. We compared the proportion of free (unbound) OCT and 1,25-(OH)2D3 in 0.1% BSA-PBS with concentrations of human serum ranging from 0-25%. The proportion of OCT in the free form was significantly higher than that of 1,25-(OH)2D3 for every serum concentration tested. The physiological relevance of a higher percentage of free OCT was tested in normal human macrophages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that Wistar rats injected at birth (n0) with STZ (n0-STZ) develop as adults a noninsulin-dependent diabetic state characterized by a lack of insulin response to glucose in vivo, a mild basal hyperglycemia, and an impaired glucose tolerance. Our former in vivo studies using the insulin-glucose clamp technique revealed an increased insulin action upon hepatic glucose production in these animals. We have now cultured hepatocytes from these mildly diabetic rats in parallel with hepatocytes from control rats, to examine more closely basal and insulin-regulated glucose production and glucose incorporation into glycogen. In addition, we extended our investigation to other hepatic functions such as lipid synthesis and amino acid transport, which could not be studied in vivo. Although glucose production from glycogenolysis or gluconeogenesis in absence or presence of glucagon was identical in the two cell populations, glucagon-stimulated glycogenolysis was more sensitive to insulin action in diabetic hepatocytes. Similarly, insulin action on glucose incorporation into glycogen, lipogenesis, and amino acid transport were enhanced in diabetic hepatocytes. The hormone effect was manifested by an increase in the sensitivity and/or in the responsiveness, reflecting the multiplicity of the pathways whereby the insulin signal is transduced through the insulin receptor to multiple postreceptor sites. To gain insight into the possible mechanism of these disturbances, we evaluated the initial insulin receptor interaction and the kinase activity of the receptor beta-subunit. In accordance with our previous study on intact livers, we found no alteration in either of these parameters in n0-STZ rat hepatocytes. Thus, the present study clearly demonstrates that these diabetic rats exhibit a postreceptor hyperresponsiveness to insulin at the cellular level. It strengthens the notion that a beta-cell deficiency with glucose intolerance does not necessarily lead to a hepatic insulin resistance.\r"

  ".W": "A potential role of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) in the regulation of steroidogenesis in the rabbit corpus luteum was investigated using a primary culture of luteal cells obtained 3 days after ovulation. Dissociated cells were cultured for 1 day in the presence of medium 199 and 10% fetal bovine serum; thereafter, the cells were cultured in medium 199 containing 0.1% BSA, gentamicin (50 micrograms/ml), and hormones or growth factors, and without serum. IGF-I (human recombinant, 100 ng/ml) was as effective as LH (ovine, 10 ng/ml) in maintaining progesterone accumulation through 4 days of culture. Estradiol (10(-8) M), either alone or in combination with LH or IGF-I failed to stimulate progesterone accumulation, which was not surprising since these cells did not possess estrogen receptors. The stimulation of progesterone by IGF-I was not detectable until 24-36 h after introduction of the growth factor to the cultures, whereas stimulation by LH was observed within 2 h. The steroidogenic effect of IGF-I was not attributable to increased cell number, as DNA values or [3H]thymidine incorporation were unchanged by IGF-I. IGF-I increased functional enzymatic activity, observed as increased progesterone accumulation in the presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol used as exogenous substrate. These data indicate that luteal cells have the capacity to respond to IGF-I, raising the possibility that IGF-I has a role in the regulation of steroidogenesis in the rabbit corpus luteum.\r"

  ".U": "91168862\r", 
  ".W": "The sexual dimorphism characterizing GH secretion in the rat is thought to be related to differences in the hypothalamic synthesis and release of the GH-regulating peptides, GH-releasing hormone (GHRH), and somatostatin. Therefore, the influence of gender and sex steroid hormones on hypothalamic expression of the GHRH gene in adult rats were examined. GHRH messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were measured in individual rat hypothalami by Northern hybridization analysis using a 32P-labeled complementary DNA encoding rat GHRH. Destruction of hypothalamic GHRH neurons by neonatal treatment with monosodium glutamate caused similar 3-fold reductions in the levels of GHRH mRNA in adult male and female animals. In three separate experiments, hypothalamic GHRH mRNA concentrations in male rats were 2- to 3-fold greater than in randomly cycling females (four or five rats per group; P less than 0.01). In spite of the greater abundance of GHRH mRNA abundance in the male rat hypothalamus, circulating gonadal steroids lacked the ability to modulate GHRH gene expression in adult animals, since neither gonadectomy nor pharmacological sex steroid replacement changed GHRH mRNA levels in the hypothalamus of male and female adult rats. Furthermore, GHRH mRNA concentrations in female rats were similar during the proestrus, estrus, and diestrus phase of the estrous cycle. Also, GH inhibited hypothalamic GHRH gene expression in a sex-specific manner. Exposure to high levels of GH secreted by the MtTW15 tumor for 4 weeks reduced GHRH mRNA concentrations 7-fold in male rats (P less than 0.001) but only 2-fold in females (P less than 0.05). These studies demonstrate that GHRH gene expression in the rat hypothalamus is sexually dimorphic. Basal mRNA levels are greater in male rats, and expression in male hypothalami is more sensitive to feedback inhibition by GH than expression in females. There is no evidence for regulation of GHRH mRNA levels by either testosterone or estrogen in adult rats. These gender differences in GHRH gene expression likely contribute to the generation of a sex-specific pattern of GH secretion.\r"

  ".W": "The ontogeny of the iodothyronine deiodinase systems has been studied by several investigators in recent years, but our understanding of the subject is far from complete. The present study was conducted to obtain kinetic information concerning 5' deiodinase (5'D) and 5 deiodinase (5D) activities in fetal rat liver and intestine, and to examine reduced glutathione (GSH)-activated 5'D activity in the two tissues. When dithiothreitol (DTT) was used as cofactor in concentrations up to 100 mM, 5'D activity was not clearly detected in liver or intestine until day 16 of gestation. Activity increased markedly in both tissues between fetal day 18-21, due primarily to an increase in maximum velocity (Vmax) of the enzyme. However, whereas 5'D activity was much higher in adult liver than in fetal liver [due to both an increase in Vmax and a decrease in the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km)], activity was barely detectable in adult intestine. When GSH was used as cofactor, the temporal development of activity in both tissues was comparable to that observed with DTT, but kinetic values were very different; with DTT mean values for Vmax in liver ranged from 3.7-1264 pmol I-/h.mg protein, and values for Km ranged from 0.1-0.5 microM; with GSH, values for Vmax ranged from 0.4-16.7 pmol I-/h.mg protein, and values for Km were less than 1 nM. A comparable difference was observed also in intestine. When either DTT or GSH was used as cofactor, 5'D activity was inhibited in the presence of 6n-propyl-2-thiouracil or iopanoic acid. Using T3 as substrate it was found that 5D activity was much higher in intestine than in liver, and the amount of 5D activity in intestine paralleled that in brain in that it was much higher in fetal than in adult tissue. Moreover, values for Vmax and Km in fetal intestine were comparable to those in fetal brain. These findings suggest that thyroid hormone is important in the developing rat intestine and raise the possibility that GSH could be the activator of 5'D systems in vivo.\r"

  ".U": "91168864\r", 
  ".W": "The liver is a major site of production of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and IGF binding proteins (IGF-BPs). GH decisively influences IGF-I production. To study the role of GH and glucagon in the regulation of IGF-I and IGF-BP production, we examined IGF-I and IGF-BPs secreted by primary rat hepatocytes cultured in a serum-free medium. Glucagon (1 x 10(-8) M) stimulated IGF-I secretion and IGF-BP secretion. Bovine GH (bGH, 300 ng/ml) stimulated IGF-I secretion but suppressed IGF-BP secretion. Combining bGH and glucagon significantly augmented IGF-I secretion above the level seen with each individual agent. The inhibitory effect of bGH on IGF-BP secretion was reversed by glucagon. The major species of IGF-BPs secreted by hepatocytes were found, on Western ligand blotting, to be 24K and 30-34K. All species of secreted IGF-BPs appeared to be comparably affected by glucagon, bGH, and their combination. Northern analysis of IGF-I mRNA revealed three transcripts of 0.7-1.1 kilobases (kb), 1.8 kb, and 7.0 kb. Glucagon stimulated IGF-I mRNA levels 1.8- to 2.0-fold, whereas bGH stimulated IGF-I mRNA levels 2.0- to 2.5-fold. When hepatocytes were incubated with glucagon and bGH for 6 h, IGF-I mRNA levels were augmented 10-fold. Glucagon, in the presence of 50 ng/ml bGH, had a dose-dependent effect on IGF-I mRNA accumulation from a 6-fold level of stimulation at 50 ng/ml of glucagon to a 9-fold level of stimulation at 1000 ng/ml glucagon to a 9-fold level of stimulation at 1000 ng/ml glucagon. This study has demonstrated that glucagon, as well as GH, has significant effects on the production of both IGF-I and IGF-BPs. Of particular interest was the marked augmentation of hepatic IGF-I messenger RNA levels and the reversal of the low levels of IGF-BP production seen on adding glucagon to bGH.\r"

  ".W": "The activity and distribution of 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in rat brain is described. Oxidation of corticosterone to 11-dehydrocorticosterone was significantly increased by NADP; the reverse reaction was increased by NADPH. Cortisol was a poor substrate. Both 11-dehydrogenase (11-DH) and 11-oxoreductase (11-OR) activities were found in brains of rats from 6 days to adult, and 11-DH and 11-OR activities were positively correlated with each other. Highest enzyme activities were found in pituitary, cerebellum, hippocampus, and cortex. Lower levels were found in the olfactory region, hypothalamus, brain stem, preoptic nucleus, and amygdala. Two antisera to 11-DH, designated 56-125 and 56-126, reacted with a 34K component corresponding in mass to rat liver 11-DH on Western blots. The dominant species of protein in all brain regions reacting with rat liver 11-DH antibody 56-125, was at 26K mol wt. Antiserum 56-126 did not cross-react with the 26K protein. The 26K component was not a 34K degradation product. In each region of the brain, Western blot analysis showed that the 26K band intensity was directly proportional to enzyme activity. However, the 26K protein was devoid of 11-DH activity. All 11-DH and 11-OR activities were associated with the 34K antigen. The data demonstrate the nonuniform distribution of 11-DH in brain tissue. They are consistent with the notion that 11-DH may confer upon brain the ability to control intracellular levels of active glucocorticoids and in this way mediate steroid function within the cell.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis that hydrogen peroxide generation occurs in the corpora lutea of superovulated rats during luteolysis was tested using a peroxide-dependent inhibitor of catalase, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (AT). Luteal regression was induced during midpseudopregnancy by injection of 500 micrograms prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) 1 h before administration of AT (0.1 g/kg, ip) and was confirmed by progesterone analysis of peripheral blood serum. Within groups of both PGF2 alpha-treated and untreated control rats, other rats also received ethanol (0.2 g/kg, ip), which prevents hydrogen peroxide-mediated inhibition of catalase by AT. Diluted homogenates of ovaries removed 1 h after AT administration were assayed for catalase activity by measuring the decrease in absorbance at 240 nm for 30 sec after the addition of hydrogen peroxide (10 mM). Ethanol-sensitive catalase inhibition by AT was significantly higher (47.9 +/- 3.38%) in samples from PGF2 alpha-treated groups than in controls (23.1 +/- 4.82%; P less than 0.01; n = 9). Similar increases in catalase inhibition by AT were found in luteal tissue of rats treated with PGF2 alpha 24 h earlier and in rats in which luteolysis was allowed to occur spontaneously in late pseudopregnancy. Hemoglobin an AT assays revealed that the changes in catalase activity were not the result of altered blood contamination or AT concentration in the luteal homogenates. Since catalase inhibition by AT is only seen in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, these results support the conclusion that an early and sustained component of corpus luteum regression is the generation of hydrogen peroxide in luteal tissue.\r"

  ".U": "91168868\r", 
  ".W": "To investigate cAMP-dependent regulation of somatostatin secretion and gene expression in the islets of Langerhans, we have correlated the effects of forskolin, theophylline, and (Bu)2cAMP (dbcAMP) on the secretion of somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SLI), cAMP generation, and somatosatin mRNA (S-mRNA) accumulation by cultured rat islet cells and a rat somatostatin-producing islet tumor cell line (1027 B2). Additionally, we have compared these effects with those of phorbol esters. Forskolin induced large acute increases in cAMP levels in islet cells, whereas theophylline produced modest sustained elevations in cAMP. During 4-h exposure to islets cells, forskolin, theophylline, and dbcAMP produced time- and dose-related increases of up to 14-fold in SLI release and up to 5-fold in S-mRNA levels. The rate of increase in S-mRNA paralleled secretion and occurred with the following order of potency: forskolin greater than dbcAMP greater than theophylline. The analog 1,9-dideoxyforskolin, which is unable to activate adenylyl cyclase, produced a small increase in SLI release without affecting S-mRNA. The effects of short term increases in islet cAMP levels and SLI release on long term changes in S-mRNA accumulation were investigated in a 48-h study with forskolin. Pretreatment of islet cells for 30 min with forskolin evoked large acute increases in cAMP levels and SLI release. S-mRNA rose in a biphasic pattern, with an acute increase at 30 min followed by a secondary increase at 12-48 h. In 1027B2 cells, forskolin and theophylline generated large increases in cAMP levels. Despite this, the two agents as well as dbcAMP produced only slight (20-35%) stimulation of SLI release and S-mRNA accumulation. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate evoked dose-dependent stimulation of SLI secretion of up to 4-fold from islet cells without altering S-mRNA.

  ".W": "We have previously reported that scorbutic and fasted guinea pig sera contain an insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I)-reversible inhibitor of collagen, proteoglycan, and DNA synthesis in cultured cells. Here we report that IGF-binding protein (IGFBP) activity is increased in serum containing the inhibitor [125I]IGF-I or -II bound to these sera was eluted in the 30- to 50-kDa region of an S200 gel column. [125I]IGF-I affinity cross-linking analysis revealed that a 38-kDa cross-linked species increased markedly in fasted and scorbutic sera, with a lesser increase in a 34-kDa species, while scorbutic sera also yielded a 44-kDa species. Gel filtration of unlabeled sera showed a 10-fold increase in the activity of two proteins in the 30- to 50-kDa region from the experimental sera. Their activity correlated with their ability to inhibit binding of [125I]IGF-I to its cellular receptor, suggesting that they have the potential to inhibit IGF-I-dependent functions. Ligand blotting showed that 29 and 35-kDa IGFBPs were almost undetectable in normal serum, but were dramatically induced by scurvy and fasting, so that they accounted for close to 40% of the total circulating BPs. Total IGFBP-3 in the experimental sera was increased about 30%, while there was little effect of scurvy or fasting on the level of BP-3 activity isolated by acid extraction of the high mol wt region of the S200 column. An IGF-I analog with normal affinity for the 30- to 50-kDa BPs from fasted and scorbutic sera, but with reduced affinity for the cell receptor, was equivalent to IGF-I in reversing the inhibition of collagen synthesis by scorbutic guinea pig serum in human fibroblasts. Thus, reversal of inhibition appears to require initial saturation of IGFBPs. The overall results suggest that two circulating IGFBPs with unoccupied binding sites are induced in vitamin C-deficient or fasted guinea pigs and may be responsible for inhibition of IGF-I-dependent functions by sera from these animals.\r"

  ".U": "91168871\r", 
  ".W": "Previously we reported that uptake of Ca2+ in cells isolated from rat duodenum declined in senescence. In this paper we examined the possible mechanisms for this age-related defect. Duodenal vitamin D-dependent calcium-binding protein decreased steadily from 3-12 months (mo), followed by a minimal decline at 24 mo. On the contrary, Ca2+ uptake was not different in 3-, 6-, and 12-mo-old rats. A significant decline of Ca2+ uptake was observed at 24 mo. ATP contents in duodenal cells from 6- and 24-mo-old rats were not different. This suggests that the metabolic status of the duodenal cells was not the cause of the change in Ca2+ uptake. Ca2+ uptake activity was significantly lower in brush border membrane vesicles isolated from 24-mo-old rats than in those from 6-mo-old rats. The decrease in Ca2+ uptake activity in old rats was not due to a change in the Ca2(+)-binding capacity of the membranes. Kinetic analysis shows that the Vmax, the apparent maximum uptake capacity of membrane vesicles, decreased in senescent rats, whereas the Km, the apparent affinity to Ca2+, was unchanged. Since duodenal Ca2+ influx at the brush border was regulated by 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3], we tested the effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 administration on the uptake activity in isolated membrane vesicles. After 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment, Ca2+ uptake activity in brush border membranes prepared from senescent rats was only slightly lower than that in membranes from adult rats. We conclude that the decline in the influx of Ca2+ at the brush border membrane was the main cause of the decrease in duodenal Ca2+ uptake activity in aging. This defect was probably due to the low serum 1,25-(OH)2D3 concentration and not the result of impaired response to 1,25-(OH)2D3.\r"

IA (rac), IB (rac), and Z-PD have been previously shown to interact with the mouse uterine estrogen receptor with high affinity (Kd, approximately 1.5-2.2 x 10(-10) M), occupy similar levels of receptor in the nucleus in vivo, and have nuclear retention times similar to those of E and DES. However, in spite of these similarities, they differentially stimulate estrogenic responses that were previously thought to be interrelated and obligatory for full estrogenic action. In an attempt to elucidate the mechanism of differential stimulation of estrogen-regulated responses, the temporal pattern of KCl-resistant receptor sites was examined after a single injection of E, DES, IA (rac), IB (rac), Z-PD, or saline. Z-PD displayed lower levels of KCl-resistant receptor than the other compounds, whereas IA (rac) and IB (rac) had patterns similar to those of E and DES. In cell-free binding assays, all of the different receptor-ligand complexes were equally effective at competitively inhibiting the binding of receptor-[3H]E complexes to mouse uterine nuclear matrix with a Ki of 1.1 x 10(-10) M. Direct binding analysis showed no difference in the number of nuclear binding sites (range, 40.4-63.9 fmol/100 micrograms DNA) or Kd (range, 1.3-1.8 x 10(-10) M) among the different receptor-ligand complexes. Dissociation studies performed at 4 C showed no differences among the different complexes. In contrast, Z-PD-receptor complexes dissociated much faster from matrix sites at 22 C than any of the other complexes. Significant differences were noted in the proportion of complexes that were resistant to extraction with 0.6 M KCl. Forty-three percent of receptor-E complexes and 44% of receptor-DES complexes were resistant to KCl extraction, while 61% of receptor-IA and 29% of receptor-PD complexes were resistant to extraction, paralleling their activity in eliciting some estrogenic responses. In contrast, no difference was seen by gel shift assays in the ability of the ligand-receptor complexes to bind to a specific PS2 estrogen-responsive DNA sequence. These results demonstrate that the ligand may significantly affect the interaction of the estrogen receptor with nuclear acceptor sites.\r"

  ".W": "We have reported that osteoblastic cells are required for differentiation of osteoclast progenitors in splenic tissues into multinucleated osteoclasts. In the present study we examined the pathogenesis of the osteoclast deficiency in osteopetrotic (op/op) mice using a coculture system of spleen cells and osteoblastic cells. When spleen cells obtained from op/op or normal (+/?) littermates of op/+ parent mice were cocultured with osteoblastic cells obtained from calvaria of normal ddy strain mice, numerous tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive multinucleated cells (MNCs) were formed in the presence of 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1 alpha,25(OH)2D3]. Most of the TRAP-positive MNCs bound [125I]salmon calcitonin. This suggests that there is no abnormality in the osteoclast progenitors present in the splenic tissues of op/op mice. When osteoblastic cells from +/? littermates were cocultured with normal spleen cells from ddy mice, TRAP-positive MNCs were similarly formed in response to 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3. In contrast, in cocultures of op/op osteoblastic cells with normal spleen cells, no TRAP-positive cells appeared, even in the presence of 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3. The op/op mutation was recently reported to exist in the coding region of the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) gene. Adding M-CSF and 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 to the coculture with op/op osteoblastic cells induced the appearance of TRAP-positive MNCs with calcitonin receptors. These results clearly indicate that osteoclast deficiency in op/op mice is due to a defect in the local microenvironment in bone, in which M-CSF produced by osteoblastic cells plays a critical role in osteoclast development.\r"

URs without gonads were grown in serum-free medium with testosterone (T, 10(-7) M), 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT, 10(-8) M), T (10(-7) M) plus cyproterone acetate (antiandrogen, 10(-5) M), or T (10(-8) M) plus 390 MSD (17 beta-N, N-diisopropylcarbamoyl-4-aza-5 alpha- androstan-3-one, an inhibitor of 5 alpha-reductase, 10(-5) M). After 4 days of culture the number of epididymal curvatures that appeared in the upper portion of WDs were quantified. DNA content of URs grown in serum-free medium was also measured. Both T and DHT increased DNA contents in a dose- (T = 10(-8) to 10(-10) M, DHT = 10(-9) to 10(-11) M) and time-dependent manner. DHT was approximately 10-fold more effective than T in eliciting epididymal coiling and increasing DNA content of URs. The effects of T or DHT were mimicked by coculture with fetal testes. Epididymal coiling and an increase in DNA content occurred in URs grown in the presence of T plus 390 MSD. By contrast, URs cultured without androgens or with T plus cyproterone acetate failed to undergo epididymal coiling and to increase DNA content. The conversion rate per mg protein of [1 beta, 2 beta-3H]T into [3H]DHT was 0.30-fold lower in 15.5 day URs cultured over a 4-day period in comparison to urogenital sinuses whose development is known to be dependent upon DHT. These data suggest that T is an important hormone in the development of the upper portion of WDs, although it is not possible to exclude a role for DHT in the development of the epididymis.\r"

Maximal specific binding of [125I]hPTHrP(1-34) was reduced by 40% in cells treated with 100 nM DEX, but half-maximal inhibition of binding of [125I]hPTHrP(1-34) by bPTH(1-34) or hPTHrP(1-34) was unaffected by DEX (0.5 nM and 1.4 nM, in the absence and presence of DEX, respectively). Moreover, the EC50 of bPTH(1-34) and hPTHrP(1-34)-evoked cAMP accumulation ranged from 3-7 nM and was the same with and without DEX. The EC50 of the inhibition of phosphate uptake by bPTH(1-34) and hPTHrP(1-34) ranged from 0.2-0.5 nM. Treatment with 100 nM DEX increased phosphate uptake 1.5-fold (EC50 3 nM), and the inhibition of phosphate uptake by bPTH(1-34) and hPTHrP(1-34) was suppressed. The inhibition of phosphate uptake by forskolin was also suppressed in cells treated with 100 nM DEX. DEX, on the other hand, enhanced forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation 1.6- to 1.8-fold. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate did not affect cAMP production, but phosphate uptake was inhibited both in the absence and the presence of 100 nM DEX (EC50 3 nM). In conclusion, treatment of OK cells with DEX only minimally affected PTH receptor binding, and cAMP accumulation evoked by bPTH(1-34) and hPTHrP(1-34) remained unaltered. The inhibition of phosphate uptake by PTH, however, was suppressed.\r"

  ".W": "Metalloproteinases, such as collagenase or gelatinase, and their associated inhibitors appear to control connective tissue remodeling during follicular rupture. We examined the regulation of metalloproteinase inhibitor activity by various treatments in cultured rat granulosa cells. Granulosa cells were harvested from immature PMSG-primed rats and cultured with LH, the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), cAMP, or forskolin. Inhibitor activity was measured in the medium. Increasing concentrations of either LH (0.1-1000 ng/ml) or TPA (2.5-100 nM) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in metalloproteinase inhibitor activity (2.9- and 2.4-fold increases above control, respectively). There was also a time-dependent induction of inhibitor activity in cells incubated in the presence of LH (100 ng/ml) for 6, 12, 18, or 24 h. Forskolin (0.1 mM) or cAMP (1 mM) treatment increased inhibitor activity 2.8- and 1.6-fold above that in control cultures. LH and TPA treatment in combination resulted in an additive increase in inhibitor activity compared to LH or TPA treatment alone. This finding suggested that the granulosa cell inhibitor activity might be induced through separate intracellular pathways. The inhibitor present in conditioned medium was isolated by chromatographic separation on a Sepharose 6B mol wt exclusion column. The inhibitor present was approximately 28,000 mol wt, which is consistent with the size of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP). In addition to the granulosa cell experiments, changes in ovarian mRNA levels for TIMP were determined. There was a preovulatory increase in TIMP mRNA from whole rat ovaries, with the highest levels detected 12 h after hCG administration. The present study establishes that metalloproteinase inhibitor activity from rat granulosa cells is induced through separate pathways: a LH-cAMP-dependent protein kinase-A pathway and a cAMP-independent protein kinase-C pathway. Furthermore, a TIMP-like protein is observed in granulosa cell-conditioned medium, while TIMP mRNA is present in rat ovaries and increases before ovulation, suggesting that the granulosa cell metalloproteinase inhibitor is TIMP. We propose that TIMP acts in part to control the site and extent of follicular connective tissue remodeling associated with ovulation.\r"

Degradation of proenkephalin released into the conditioned medium was reduced significantly in the presence of 2% fetal bovine serum. Forty-eight percent of recombinant proenkephalin was glycosylated; glycosylation could be entirely prevented by the addition of tunicamycin. Two-dimensional isoelectric focusing experiments showed that recombinant proenkephalin exhibited considerable charge heterogeneity, with two major unglycosylated isoelectric forms and six or seven glycosylated isoelectric forms. The estimated isoelectric points of the major unglycosylated proenkephalins were 6.0 and 6.1, while glycosylated proenkephalins ranged in pI from 5.7-6.1. Some of this isoelectric heterogeneity is due to phosphorylation; [32P] orthophosphate was readily incorporated into serine residues within newly synthesized proenkephalin.\r"

In dw/dw mice hGH enhanced significantly body, liver, kidney, and testicular weight. In addition, hGH increased testicular LH receptors and the acute steroidogenic response to human CG, but there was no significant effect on basal plasma testosterone or plasma LH levels. The effects of IGF-I in body and kidney weight were less pronounced than those produced by hGH, but its effects on testicular weight and LH receptors, as well as on the acute steroidogenic response to human CG, were similar to that observed after hGH treatment. In Dw/- mice hGH had no effect on either body or organ weight or on testicular function, despite the fact that it induced a significant increase in plasma IGF-I levels. These results indicated that IGF-I is able to induce the maturation of Leydig cell function and that the effects of hGH on the testis are probably mediated by IGF-I. They also suggest that the delayed puberty associated with GH deficiency or resistance is most likely related to an IGF-I deficiency.\r"

  ".W": "The suppression of PTH release by high extracellular calcium (Ca2+) has been associated with secretion of biologically inactive carboxyl-terminal fragments of PTH (C-PTH), while relatively more intact PTH is released under low extracellular Ca2+ conditions. In the presence of high extracellular Ca2+, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) has been shown to stimulate PTH release to levels observed at low Ca2+, suggesting that protein kinase-C (PKC) is involved in the regulation of PTH secretion. We have examined the effect of PMA on PTH secretion and the release of PTH fragments at high and low calcium concentrations. Primary cultures of bovine parathyroid cells were incubated for 90 min in 0.5 mM (low) or 2.0 mM (high) Ca2+ with or without 1.6 microM PMA. Reverse phase HPLC using an 18-60% gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was performed on the medium from these incubations, and the eluant fractions were analyzed with a carboxyl (C)-terminal-specific PTH RIA. Medium from cultures exposed to low Ca2+ exhibited two large peaks of PTH immunoreactivity, coeluting with intact PTH-(1-84) and a synthetic human C-PTH-(39-84). PMA treatment at low Ca2+ resulted in the secretion of a greatly reduced amount of intact PTH, suggesting that PKC may increase the production of PTH fragment. At high extracellular Ca2+ PMA caused an increase in total immunoreactive PTH release similar to that seen at low Ca2+. However, on HPLC analysis, proportionally more PTH eluted in the position of the C-PTH fragment than was seen with low Ca2+ stimulation of PTH secretion. It, therefore, appears that the degradation of PTH to C-PTH may be linked to activation of PKC and can be separated from the Ca2+ regulation of PTH release occurring at the cell membrane.\r"

We have found that systemic administration of the excitatory amino acid agonist N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) evokes a transient and profound increase in circulating levels of ACTH as well. Treatment of adult male Long-Evans rats with NMDA (30 mg/kg, sc) maximally increased plasma ACTH and immunoreactive beta-endorphin from 7-15 min after injection, and levels of both remained significantly elevated until 60 min into the time course. Corresponding increases in corticosterone were observed 15 and 30 min after treatment, while LH, similar to other pituitary hormones, was increased from 7-30 min after NMDA. Stimulation of the pituitary-adrenal and pituitary-gonadal neuroendocrine axes by NMDA was monitored in subsequent studies by plasma ACTH and LH, respectively; both were increased in a dose-related manner after the administration of 3-60 mg/kg NMDA, although stimulation of ACTH (800%) was more pronounced than that of LH (200%). The increases in ACTH and LH due to NMDA were inhibited by pretreatment with the competitive NMDA antagonist (+/-)3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4- yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid, CPP (6 and 10 mg/kg, ip, for 21 min); by contrast, dexamethasone pretreatment (50 micrograms/kg, ip, for 4 h) blocked only the NMDA-evoked increase in circulating ACTH. These findings indicate that an NMDA receptor mechanism might be involved in the acute activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in the rat.\r"

  ".W": "Endogenous opioid peptides such as beta-endorphin, derived from proopiomelanocortin (POMC), have been widely implicated as serving an important role in the neuroendocrine regulation of the primate reproductive axis. In both human and nonhuman primates, POMC neurons are thought to mediate, at least in part, the negative feedback action of sex steroids on GnRH. Sex steroids, such as testosterone, are thought to inhibit GnRH secretion by enhancing the inhibitory activity of beta-endorphin; however, the cellular mechanisms by which steroid hormones regulate the activity of POMC neurons in the primate brain are unknown. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that testosterone stimulates POMC gene expression within the primate brain and that this regulation occurs within a specific subset of POMC neurons residing in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. We used in situ hybridization to compare cellular levels of POMC messenger RNA in intact (n = 4), castrated (n = 4), and castrated/testosterone-treated (n = 4) monkeys. We report that after castration of the male macaque (Macaca fascicularis), cellular POMC messenger RNA levels decline significantly (P less than 0.05) in neurons within the arcuate nucleus and that this decline is prevented by replacement with physiological doses of testosterone. Moreover, we found that this testosterone-dependent modulation of POMC gene expression is restricted to a small fraction of the numerous POMC neurons located within the most anterior region of the arcuate nucleus in the brain of this primate species. These observations provide evidence that sex steroids regulate expression of the POMC gene in the primate brain.\r"

  ".W": "The responsiveness to dopamine of PRL secretion from individual lactotrophs of female rats was investigated by the use of a newly developed sequential cell immunoblot assay. In this assay, PRL secretion from the same single lactotrophs that had been cultured on plastic coverslips was quantified before and after dopamine treatment by a combination of direct absorption of PRL secreted on protein-blotting transfer membranes, immunostaining, and microscopic image analysis. The assay was sensitive enough to detect 0.03 fg PRL/pixel and was specific for PRL. The range of PRL secretion from single pituitary cells in culture was 0.03-1.92 pg/cell.h. PRL secretion was increased with time of incubation and reached a maximum by 80-160 min. There was a significant correlation in PRL secretion from the same lactotrophs between the first and second 60-min incubations. When medium used in the second incubation contained no dopamine, amounts of PRL secreted during the second incubation period were 21-204% of those secreted during the first incubation period. Inclusion of 10(-8)-10(-6) M dopamine in the second incubation medium increased in a dose-dependent manner the proportion of lactotrophs whose PRL secretion was suppressed significantly compared with that during the first incubation period. However, PRL secretion from approximately 6% of the total lactotrophs was not suppressed even by dopamine at concentrations over 10(-6) M. The present study demonstrates that the sequential cell immunoblot assay is a useful means to quantify repeatedly hormone secretion from individual endocrine cells in culture. Furthermore, these results suggest that there is a subpopulation of rat PRL-secreting lactotrophs that are unresponsive to dopamine.\r"

In a previous study we showed that IGF-I mRNA was expressed in chicken embryos beginning at the blastoderm stage (day 0, newly laid egg). Here we present the ontogeny of serum IGF-I in normal and growth-retarded chicken embryos. Serum samples were pooled from multiple embryos starting on day 4 of development in ovo until hatching (day 21). Extracts of day 2 and 3 whole embryos were also studied. IGF-binding proteins were removed by filtration on Sep-Pak C-18 cartridges. IGF-I was quantitated by a heterologous RIA validated for chicken species. Embryonic IGF-I showed a HPLC profile similar to that of adult chicken serum IGF-I. Serum IGF-I was measurable on day 6 of development (approximately 0.04 ng/ml), reached a peak on day 15 (18 ng/ml), and decreased to a low concentration (0.2 ng/ml) the day before hatching. Embryos cultured ex ovo showed progressive growth retardation after day 10 of development, and by day 20 their weight was 50% of normal. The serum IGF-I concentration of ex ovo cultured embryos was normal on day 10, but remained low until day 21, without the midembryogenesis rise observed in normal embryos. These results support the concept that IGF-I may have a role in general embryonic growth in addition to any paracrine/autocrine action in individual tissues.\r"

Prior studies in the rat ventral prostate, using autoradiography and tritiated dihydrotestosterone, indicate that androgen receptors are present in the prostatic stroma on day 3 and are detected in the epithelium by the tenth postnatal day. These findings suggested that androgen stimulation of the prostatic mesenchyme is a crucial step in the growth and development of the prostate. We have examined this developmental program directly using polyclonal antibodies that recognize specific epitopes of the androgen receptor to examine the pattern of androgen receptor expression in intact and neonatally castrate animals. In keeping with previous studies, androgen receptors are present in the prostate stroma at birth and subsequently appear in the prostatic epithelium by the 10th postnatal day. Development of androgen receptor expression in the epithelium was not changed when the animals were castrated at birth, castrated and blocked by flutamide, or castrated and given hydrocortisone to suppress the production of adrenal androgens. These findings suggest that the appearance of androgen receptors in the prostatic epithelium is programmed by androgens before birth or that factors other than testicular or adrenal androgens control the development of epithelial androgen receptors.\r"

In contrast, levels of pituitary estrogen receptors (ER) remain constant in spayed or E-treated monkeys. In monkey pituitary cultures, the number of PR-positive cells varies depending on the donor status, whereas the percentage of ER-positive cells in similar. We sought to determine whether E can directly induce PR in monkey pituitary gonadotropes in culture and to provide further evidence that monkey pituitary ER are constitutively expressed. Dispersed pituitary cells from intact or gonadectomized male and female macaques were cultured on extracellular matrix with and without E, phenol red, high or low insulin, insulin-like growth factor-I, or 5% ovariectomized monkey serum, ER- and PR-positive parenchymal cells were immunohistochemically detected with monoclonal antibodies H222 and D75 (against human ER) and B39 (against human PR). ER levels were also measured with a gradient shift assay incorporating H222. Neither the percentage of ER-positive cells nor the levels of nuclear ER were altered by donor status or by 8 days of culture in phenol red or E. In contrast, cultures from gonad-intact donors exhibited the highest average percentage of PR-positive cells. The lower number of PR-positive cells in cultures from spayed donors did not vary for 8 days on extracellular matrix without phenol red, E, insulin, or serum. E directly increased the percentage of PR-expressing cells in serum-free cultures. Addition of serum also increased the percentage of PR-positive cells. Addition of E to serum-containing cultures further increased the percentage of PR-positive cells. Neither insulin nor insulin-like growth factor-I directly affected the number of PR-positive cells, but a high level of insulin blunted the action of E on PR induction in serum-free culture. We conclude that E treatment has no obvious effect on ER expression in macaque pituitary. However, the induction of pituitary PR by E treatment of spayed monkeys can be accounted for by a direct action of E on PR gene expression in gonadotropes.\r"

  ".W": "The acute regulation of steroidogenesis in steroidogenic tissues requires de novo protein synthesis. It is believed that these newly synthesized proteins are instrumental in the delivery of the substrate, cholesterol, to the inner mitochondrial membrane where the cholesterol side-chain cleavage complex converts cholesterol to pregnenolone. A number of studies have attempted to characterize the protein(s) synthesized in response to hormone stimulation and, hence, function in the delivery of cholesterol to the cholesterol side-chain cleavage complex. While a number of potential protein candidates have been described, there is at present no unequivocal evidence which indicates that they are involved in steroidogenic regulation. We and others have described proteins that are induced in a variety of steroidogenic tissues in response to hormone stimulation and are localized in the mitochondria of these tissues. In an attempt to determine whether these induced proteins may be involved in steroidogenesis, we compared mitochondrial protein profiles in two separate Leydig tumor cell line. One cell line, the MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cell line, has a very low basal steroid production, but synthesizes large amounts of progesterone in response to both tropic hormone and cAMP analog. The other cell line, the R2C rat Leydig tumor cell line, produces constitutively large amounts of progesterone, which cannot be increased further with hormone stimulation. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis profiles of newly synthesized mitochondrial proteins demonstrated that four 30-kDa proteins are induced in response to hormonal stimulation in MA-10 cells. Further, it was shown that proteins identical to these induced proteins are present constitutively in the mitochondria of R2C cells and cannot be further increased with hormone stimulation. These results strongly suggest that the 30-kDa mitochondrial proteins shown to be induced in several steroidogenic tissues are involved in the acute regulation of steroid production.\r"

These antibodies have been used to develop a two-site immunometric enzyme immunoassay which detects PTHLP[1-87] and PTHLP[1-141] but not PTH. The immunoassay detected PTHLP in extracts of squamous carcinomas and normal tissues at concentrations from 7-515 ng PTHLP[1-87]/mg protein. Immunoblotting of the extract which showed the highest immunoreactivity, a squamous carcinoma of the lung from a patient with hypercalcemia, revealed a major band having an apparent mol wt of 26,500 and several other higher mol wt bands. Similar polypeptides were observed by immunoblotting cell extracts from a cell line, SCaBER, which secretes immunoreactive PTHLP into its medium and also from tumors in nude mice derived from this cell line. Chaotropic agents did not alter the immunoblotting pattern, and antibodies to three different epitopes of PTHLP recognized these bands, indicating PTHLP expression in the extracts. Immunohistochemical staining of normal human tissue with these antibodies revealed several PTHLP-containing tissues and confirmed the results of the immunoassay, suggesting a paracrine role for PTHLP. Staining was observed in several neoplastic tissues including squamous cell carcinomas, lung carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, osteogenic sarcoma, and adenocarcinoma of the colon.\r"

The amino-terminal portion of this peptide has a sequence homology with parathyroid hormone PTH. We have compared the agonist potency of the synthetic human amino-terminal 1-34 peptide [human (h)PLP-(1-34)] with that of intact PTH and its amino terminal fragment [hPTH-(1-34)] in the renal and metatarsal cytochemical bioassays (CBA). Furthermore, the antagonist activity of the truncated amino terminal molecule [hPLP-(3-34)] has been compared to that of [Norleu8.18,Tyr34]bovine PTH-(3-34)NH2, and we have also tested their ability to stimulate enzyme activities thought to be associated with bone formation and resorption. In the renal CBA, both PLP-(1-34) and hPTH-(1-34) were equipotent with intact hPTH. In the metatarsal CBA, although the two amino-terminal peptides were equipotent, they elicited an earlier response than the intact PTH molecule. In both assay systems the truncated PLP analog [hPLP-(3-34)] was a more potent antagonist of both PTH and PLP activity than was [Norleu8.18,Tyr34]bovine PTH-(1-34)NH2. In acute studies, hPLP-(1-34) and hPTH-(1-34) stimulated alkaline phosphatase and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity in osteoblasts to a similar extent, and both peptides stimulated tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and succinate dehydrogenase activity in osteoclasts. Longer exposure to the peptides resulted in stimulation of enzyme activity in osteoclasts but not osteoblasts, although there was no difference in potency between the two molecules.\r"

Premature parturition and a precocious elevation in fetal plasma CBG are produced by intrafetal ACTH administration, but the possible sources of CBG in the ovine fetus are not known. To determine these sites, CBG mRNA was measured in tissues from fetal sheep in late pregnancy and after intrafetal ACTH treatment, using a sheep CBG cDNA. Fetal ACTH treatment caused a significant increase in the fetal plasma corticosteroid-binding capacity (CBC), although there was no significant difference in CBC between umbilical arterial and umbilical venous plasma. After ACTH treatment, CBC was elevated in fetal liver and kidney. Cortisol binding in these tissues had characteristics similar to those of cortisol binding in fetal sheep plasma. By Northern blot analysis a single mRNA (1.7 kilobases) for CBG was detected in fetal liver, kidney, lung, and adrenal, but not in placenta. The abundance of CBG mRNA in the fetal liver was greater than that in other tissues, but was unchanged by ACTH treatment. The level of CBG mRNA in the fetal kidney, but not in other tissues, increased 3-fold after ACTH. We conclude that the elevation in plasma CBC after intrafetal ACTH, and presumably also at term pregnancy, does not reflect production of CBC by the placenta or transfer from the mother. Rather, it results from production primarily in the fetal liver and kidney, although only in the latter tissue is CBG mRNA accumulation increased by intrafetal ACTH treatment.\r"

  ".W": "The insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) exist primarily bound to cell surface receptors or complexed to specific binding proteins (IGFBPs). The IGFBPs modulate the bioavailability of the IGFs and may enhance or inhibit IGF actions. Several distinct forms of IGFBPs have been described on the basis of size, immunological determinants, and distribution in biological fluids; the IGFBPs may differ as well in their biological function. Sheep thyroid cells produce IGFBPs under hormonal regulation. Cells grown in basal medium or with six-hormone (6H) medium supplements (transferrin, glycyl-histidyl-lysine, hydrocortisone, somatostatin, insulin, and TSH) release nonglycosylated BPs that migrate at 24, 27, 29, and 32 kDa on Western ligand blot. Cells cultured with the thyroid mitogens epidermal growth factor and phorbol ester release additional glycosylated IGFBPs of 40-44 kDa. Immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that 29- and 32-kDa IGFBPs are antigenically related to IGFBP-2, and the 40- to 44-kDa proteins are related to IGFBP-3. Using specific cDNA probes IGFBP-1, -2, and -3, we examined the regulation of IGFBP mRNA levels in sheep thyroid cultures. The rat IGFBP-2 cDNA probe hybridized to an approximately 1.6-kilobase mRNA species in cells under all culture conditions. However, IGFBP-3 mRNA was detectable only in epidermal growth factor- or phorbol ester-treated cells and appeared within 4 h, preceding the release of IGFBP-3 protein into the medium. The 6H additives, which stimulate differentiated function in thyroid cells, inhibited the mRNA levels of both IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3. IGFBP-1 mRNA was not detectable. The distinct regulation of these IGFBPs suggest that they may play different biological roles in modulating thyroid physiology.\r"

In this study we report that a chymotrypsin-like activity has been colocalized with trypsin-like and carboxypeptidase-B-like proteases in neurosecretory granules, the site of intracellular processing of prohomones. Using a peptide of 11 amino acids as a simple model system for the study of prohomone processing, we have identified in neurosecretory granule membranes a novel protease that specifically recognizes and cleaves peptide bonds at aromatic residues. Studies were also performed with the fluorogenic peptide substrate N-succinyl-leucyl-leucyl-valyl-tyrosine-7-amino-4-methyl-coumarine . The identified protease activity is inactivated by a cloromethyl ketone derivative (Tos-Phe-CH2-Cl) by Trasylol, and markedly by phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride and diisopropylfluorophosphate. This activity is colocalized with other prohomone-processing enzymes in neurosecretory granules, which indicates that this activity is involved in the prohomone processing. Alternatively, this activity may function in the degradation of homones and neuropeptides when they are released in synapses.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanisms that restrict cell proliferation play an important regulatory role in differentiation and tumorigenesis. The growth of PRL-secreting cells of the anterior pituitary is known to be highly estrogen dependent; however, estrogen may act indirectly via growth regulatory polypeptides. We have used the GH4C1 rat pituitary cell line to investigate the action of two classes of growth regulatory polypeptides, transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF alpha) and TGF beta. TGF alpha and TGF beta each inhibit GH4 cell proliferation, as measured by cell number and [3H]thymidine incorporation, and given together arrest GH4 cell proliferation. The growth inhibitory action of TGF alpha is concentration dependent (IC50 = 100 pM) and saturable. Activin-A, a TGF beta-related polypeptide, also inhibits proliferation, but is less effective than TGF beta. TGF alpha and TGF beta each alter GH4 cell cycle distribution by decreasing in the percentage of S phase cells (74% and 34%, respectively) and increasing proportionally G0-G1 phase cells. The growth inhibitory action of TGF alpha differs from that of TGF beta in that TGF alpha also causes a temporary accumulation of cells in G2-M phases. We next initiated experiments to evaluate the role of protein kinase-C in the growth inhibitory actions of TGF alpha and TGF beta. The alpha- and beta-isoforms of protein kinase-C were down-regulated by pretreatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, yet TGF alpha and TGF beta still substantially inhibited GH4 cell proliferation. We next compared the actions of TGF alpha and TGF beta on two other well characterized prolonged GH4 responses. TGF alpha and TGF beta each increased GH4 cell adhesion, but differed in their effects on PRL production. This indicates that TGF alpha and TGF beta activate different signaling pathways in GH4 cells. Activin-A acted like TGF beta by enhancing cell-substratum adhesion and inhibiting PRL production, consistent with an interaction at a common receptor site. Taken together these results identify biological functions for TGF alpha, TGF beta, and activin-A on PRL cells and open the possibility that they may represent the direct in vivo mediators of estrogen action to regulate the growth of PRL cells in the anterior pituitary gland.\r"

Select types of opiates are known to release GH by a hypothalamic site of action, and thus, the dermorphin heptapeptide and benzomorphan opiate agonist 2549 used in this study presumably act on the hypothalamus to release GH. Neither dermorphin nor 2549 released GH or augmented the GH responses of GHRP or GHRH in vitro by a direct pituitary action, while GHRH antiserum inhibited the GH response of both dermorphin and 2549 in vivo. Evidence indicates that these opiates and GHRP administered together synergistically release GH, demonstrating the independent action(s) of GHRP and the opiates. Present data indicate that one of the major differences in the actions of dermorphin, 2549, and GHRP is the inhibition of somatostatin (SRIF) release by the opiates but not by GHRP. Although the actions of dermorphin, 2549, and GHRP on GH release are GHRH dependent, release of endogenous GHRH does not explain how GH is released synergistically by the combination of these peptides. It is proposed that dermorphin/2549 synergistically release GH with GHRP or GHRH because these opiates inhibit SRIF release. Since the GHRP plus GHRH synergistic GH release was not explained by inhibition of SRIF or stimulation of GHRH, an alternative mechanism is proposed to explain how GHRP synergistically release GH in combination with GHRH. The complementary, rather dramatic synergistic interaction of GHRP, GHRH, and dermorphin or GHRP, GHRH, and 2549 in releasing GH again strongly supports the independent actions of these compounds.\r"

  ".W": "Primary uterine cell cultures were used to study multifactor regulation of progesterone receptor (PR) and the signal transduction pathways which may serve to mediate that regulation. Increases in intracellular cAMP, brought about by treatment with cholera toxin plus isobutyl methyl xanthine or by addition of 8-bromo-cAMP, result in 6- to 7-fold increases in the intracellular content of PR as monitored by [3H]R5020 binding and by Western immunoblot using anti-PR antibodies. In these primary cultures of uterine cells isolated from 19-day-old immature rats, 8-bromo-cAMP evokes significant increases in PR by 8 h with maximal increases by 24 h. This time course and magnitude of PR stimulation are similar to those evoked by maximally effective concentrations of estradiol (3 x 10(-9) M) or IGF-I (20 ng/ml). Dose-response studies reveal that 10(-6) to 10(-4) M concentrations of 8-bromo-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP) elicit a maximal response. In contrast, 8-bromo-cGMP over a wide concentration range was unable to elevate cellular PR levels. Under these culture conditions, cell proliferation was not altered by treatment with any of these agents. Although estrogen, cAMP, and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) may act via different pathways to increase PR, the effects evoked by maximally effective concentrations of these agents are not additive implying involvement of a common component. The increases in PR evoked by estradiol, cAMP, or IGF-I are markedly suppressed by treatment with antiestrogen (ICI 164,384) or the cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase inhibitor H8 or the protein kinase A inhibitor PKI, indicating the involvement of the estrogen receptor and phosphorylation pathways in PR regulation by these three agents. The present studies identify cAMP, as well as estrogen and IGF-I, as important regulators of the level of PR in uterine cells and suggest that multiple factors, including those affecting intracellular cAMP levels, might influence responsiveness to progestins via regulation of the intracellular PR content.\r"

The results of these studies showed that antisense GH ODN treatment inhibits lymphocyte production of immunoreactive GH (irGH). Lymphocytes treated with the GH antisense ODN produced less irGH than did lymphocytes treated with control sense GH ODN. Antisense GH ODN-mediated inhibition of irGH production resulted in a decrease in lymphocyte proliferation. Cells with the antisense GH ODN had less (87%) incorporation of [3H]thymidine [( 3H]TdR) in both resting and Concanavalin-A-stimulated lymphocytes, whereas the incorporation of [3H]TdR in cells treated with a control ODN was not significantly affected. The effect of the antisense ODN on [3H]TdR incorporation was specific, since it could be reversed by hybridization competition with a complementary GH sense ODN or by the addition of exogenous rat GH. Collectively, the data indicate that lymphocytes synthesize and secrete irGH and that irGH produced by these cells can stimulate proliferation, suggesting that GH may play an autocrine/paracrine role in lymphocyte replication.\r"

In this study we investigated whether factors other than the diabetes-induced decrease in GH secretion contribute to alterations in P-450 isozyme expression in streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rats. In male rats, hepatic P-450h apoprotein and mRNA decreased to 13% and 24% of control male levels, respectively, within 14 days of STZ injection. STZ-diabetes had little effect on expression of P-450i in females. Treatment of diabetic male rats with GH did not reverse the suppression of P-450h. STZ treatment also suppressed P-450h expression in GH-treated hypophysectomized (Hx) male rats, but incompletely. Thus, GH can partially reverse diabetic suppression of P-450h. However, in Hx male rats without GH supplementation, STZ treatment suppressed P-450h apoprotein and mRNA expression to 16% and 6% of nondiabetic Hx male levels, respectively, demonstrating the existence of GH-independent regulation of P-450h expression. In Hx female rats, P-450h apoprotein levels were 40% of those in intact control males and were not significantly decreased by STZ. Concomitantly, STZ produced a greater decrease in serum insulin levels and a greater increase in serum glucagon in Hx male rats than in Hx females. The results provide evidence for the existence of STZ-sensitive GH-independent expression of P-450h and further document the gender differences in STZ sensitivity.\r"

  ".W": "The maternal transfer of circadian rhythmicity and photoperiodic information to the fetus has been clearly demonstrated in several species, as has the importance of the pineal hormone, melatonin, in conveying this information. Maternal melatonin is known to readily cross the placenta and be taken up by the fetal brain. Specific melatonin receptors have been demonstrated in the rodent brain and pituitary from the 21st day of gestation. To better understand the mechanisms by which melatonin brings about the transfer of information to the fetus and to define the receptivity of the fetus to the melatonin signal, we have followed the ontogeny of central melatonin binding sites in the rat from the 13th day of gestation to 5 days after birth. The use of in vitro autoradiography allows for the precise localization of binding sites as well as their quantification. In the present study melatonin binding sites were first found on the 15th day of gestation, at which time specific binding was limited to the pituitary. At birth it was possible to identify a strong label in the pars tuberalis of the pituitary, whereas the pars distalis appeared to be less intensely and more unevenly labeled. Neuronal melatonin binding sites became apparent from day 17 of gestation in an area of the dorsal brain that in older fetuses and in neonatal rats appeared to be the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus. Moreover, melatonin binding sites are identifiable over the suprachiasmatic nuclei from day 18 of gestation. These data show that the fetal pituitary may have the potential to respond to the maternal melatonin signal as early as the 15th day of gestation, and that the brain may attain that potential at the 17th or 18th day of gestation.\r"

  ".W": "The rat prostate is a complex ductal system with branches and subbranches extending from one end to another. Owing to the relative distance of various regions from the urethra, the entire length of the ductal system can be divided into three segments, i.e. the proximal, intermediate, and distal segments. The present study was carried out to examine the pattern of localization of sulfated glycoprotein-2 (SGP-2), a marker protein associated with programmed cell death, in various regions of the prostatic ductal system under normal conditions and during castration-induced regression. SGP-2 has been considered an androgen-repressed gene product in the rat prostate and has previously been known as castration-induced protein or TRPM-2. In the normal rat prostate, immunoreactive SGP-2 was localized in epithelial cells lining the proximal segment in which signs of programmed cell death were apparent. Cells lining the distal and intermediate segments were, however, devoid of SGP-2. This observed regional variation in SGP-2 localization did not support an earlier hypothesis which stated that SGP-2 was constitutively expressed by all prostatic epithelial cells in the normal rat prostate. After castration in adult rats, there was a shift in the location of cells containing SGP-2 from the proximal segment toward the distal segment. Therefore, there is a regional variation in the distribution of SGP-2 in the rat prostate both before and after castration in the host. These findings are likely to be associated with a regional variation in cellular responsiveness to androgen stimulation and androgen depletion in the prostatic ductal system. Results also support the view that SGP-2 localization is associated with an early manifestation of programmed cell death in the rat prostate.\r"

Antiserum against IGF-I was raised in sheep and purified by affinity chromatography. The ability of the purified antibodies to neutralize the actions of IGF-I in vitro and bind IGF-I in vivo were extensively tested using L6 myoblast and cartilage bioassays. Four groups of male rats with isolated GH deficiency were used in the study. At 49 days of age the rats received 100 microliter normal saline given sc each day for 10 days, 2 mg/kg recombinant bovine GH (bGH) given in 100 microliter, sc, each day, 2 mg/kg bGH, sc, and 300 microliter immunoglobulin G purified from normal sheep serum given daily ip, or 2 mg/kg bGH plus 300 microliter anti-IGF-I immunoglobulin G daily, ip (a dose that was able to completely inhibit IGF-I actions on sulfate uptake into cartilage). Treatment with GH significantly increased growth rates (P less than 0.001) in the rats, but there was no difference between any of the three GH-treated groups; passive immunization against IGF-I did not diminish the GH-stimulated growth in these rats. Excess antibody could be detected in the plasma of all anti-IGF-I-treated rats at the conclusion of the experiment, and the antibody was capable of sequestering both free and binding protein-bound IGF-I. The absence of even a slight retardation of GH-stimulated growth in the anti-IGF-I-treated rats suggests that circulating IGF-I may not be important in mediating the growth-promoting actions of GH, although the immunoneutralization probably does not affect GH stimulation of tissue IGF-I production.\r"

Prompted by the observation that mice bearing a bovine OT transgene express bovine OT RNA in their testes, we investigated the expression of the VP-OT locus in normal mice and cattle. Normal wild-type mice do not have detectable levels of either VP or OT RNA in their testes. Normal cattle are also devoid of detectable VP transcripts, but have relatively high levels of testicular OT RNA. Additionally, OT, but not VP, peptide is detectable by HPLC. In situ hybridization to RNA in bovine testicular tissue sections localized OT transcripts to seminiferous tubules, with a distribution similar to that of alpha-inhibin, suggesting expression in Sertoli cells. Interestingly, the bovine OT RNAs in the transgenic mouse testes were also shown by in situ hybridization to have the same distribution. These data suggest that the cis-acting regulatory sequences responsible for expression of the OT gene in bovine Sertoli testis reside within the limits of the transgene used in this study. Further, the trans-acting factors present in murine testicular cells are able to recognize these elements, although they do not express the endogenous mouse OT gene in this tissue.\r"

Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis we have been able to identify a VP RNA that is identical in exonic structure to that found in the hypothalamus. However, the abundance of this form is very low, and it cannot be detected by Northern blotting. Two VP RNAs with a novel structure, as shown using exon-specific probes, are present in higher abundance. By differential hybridization, sequencing of a cDNA clone, and PCR we have deduced the structure of these novel transcripts. Both of the novel testicular VP RNA species share two exons with the classical hypothalamic RNA. However, the testicular VP gene-derived RNA lacks the first exon of the hypothalamic transcript, the exon that contains the sequence information for the VP nonopeptide hormone. Instead, it has novel sequence that are derived from at least two unique testis-specific exons, one of which is located 7-10 kilobase up-stream of the brain-specific start of transcription. These two unusual transcripts are probably derived by alternative splicing of at least two up-stream exons. Sequence and polysome analyses indicate that the testicular VP RNAs are probably not translated. Northern blotting revealed that the VP gene-derived RNA species are tightly regulated during postnatal development, becoming apparent by 40 days of age, although they subsequently fail to respond to a variety of physiological perturbations. Oxytocin gene transcripts are not detectable by Northern hybridization, but the authentic hypothalamic-type RNA can be detected in the rat testis using PCR analysis.\r"

In man, congenital and acquired deficiency of 11 beta-dehydrogenase are rare causes of hypertension in which cortisol acts as a potent mineralocorticoid. Observations from these clinical studies indicate that 11 beta-DH conveys specificity for the mineralocorticoid receptor in distal tubules and collecting ducts. However, while some studies do indicate 11 beta-DH activity in rat distal tubules and collecting ducts, immunohistochemical studies localize 11 beta-DH only to proximal tubules. to resolve this dilemma, we have performed in situ hybridization localization of 11 beta-DH mRNA in rat kidney tissue using 35S-labeled sense and antisense cRNA probes to rat 11 beta-DH. In contrast to our immunohistochemical studies in which 11 beta-DH protein was localized predominantly to proximal tubules in the inner cortex, 11 beta-DH mRNA was expressed in tubules in both the inner and outer cortex, most probably proximal and distal tubules, and in collecting ducts extending across the corticomedullary junction to the papillary tip. Weak hybridization was also seen in glomeruli, but no hybridization to the sense 11 beta-DH cRNA or to sections pretreated with RNase-A was observed. We conclude that renal 11 beta-DH is suitably located to prevent access of glucocorticoid to the MR in an autocrine and not a paracrine fashion. 11 beta-DH in proximal tubules may protect the glucocorticoid receptor.\r"

Both [125I]insulin and [125I]epidermal growth factor (EGF) are internalized to a much greater extent than [125I]glucagon in freshly isolated rat hepatocytes. All three ligands bind initially and preferentially to the microvillous surface of the hepatocyte, but only [125I]insulin and [125I]EGF undergo significant redistribution to the nonvillous surface of the cell. Thus, the degree of lateral mobility of the ligand receptor complex is strongly correlated with the extent of internalization of the ligand. Since the beta-subunit of the insulin and the EGF receptors span the plasma membrane only once and both receptors are autophosphorylated, it is possible that these are important determinants of the receptor mobility.\r"

Orchiectomy resulted in 39% and 41% reductions in the levels of EGFR mRNA and EGF binding, respectively, within 2 weeks. Treatment of orchiectomized mice with a sc injection of testosterone propionate (TP; 100 micrograms/mouse.day) for 1 week restored these values to normal male levels. The hepatic levels of EGFR mRNA and EGF binding in females were 37% and 36% of those in males, respectively, and were not affected by ovariectomy, whereas treatment of females with TP (100 micrograms/mouse.day) increased EGFR to normal male levels within 1 week. On the other hand, neither orchiectomy nor androgen treatment affected levels of mRNAs for EGFR in the kidney or mRNAs for the structural protein beta-actin in the liver. To examine whether testosterone directly increased EGFR levels in the liver, TP (1.0 mg) pellets were implanted into the spleen of orchiectomized mice, so that testosterone released from the pellets reached the liver through the portal vein but did not enter the systemic circulation due to rapid clearance by the liver. The heptic levels of EGFR mRNA and EGF binding in orchiectomized mice were restored to normal male levels by intrasplenic implantation of TP (1.0 mg) pellets. This treatment also increased the hepatic levels of EGFR mRNA and EGF binding in female mice by 61% and 68%, respectively. In addition, sialoadenectomy, which reduced plasma EGF, as well as EGF antiserum treatment did not affect the androgen-dependent increase in EGFR levels in the liver, suggesting that endogenous EGF is not involved in the androgenic regulation of hepatic EGFR levels. These results suggest that hepatic EGFR levels are at least in part regulated at a pretranslational level by direct effects of androgens on the liver.\r"

  ".U": "91168919\r", 
  ".W": "As judged by the response of uncoupling protein and key enzymes, brown adipose tissue (BAT) is highly dependent upon the local generation of T3 catalyzed by the tissue type II T4 5'-deiodinase (5'-D-II). In hypothyroid rats treated with T3 or T4, the capacity to withstand cold seems better correlated with the normalization of BAT responses than with the liver thyroid status. 5'D-II is activated by cold via sympathetic nervous system (SNS) stimulation, and the activation generates enough T3 to nearly saturate BAT nuclear T3 receptor (NTR) in euthyroid rats. In hypothyroidism, 5'D-II is highly stimulated by the SNS and hypothyroxinemia. In the present studies we have taken advantage of this situation to test 1) the capacity of 5'D-II to maintain nuclear T3 in rats with various degrees of hypothyroxinemia, and 2) the hypothesis that thyroid hormone-dependent BAT-facultative thermogenesis, rather than the effect of thyroid hormone on obligatory thermogenesis (basal metabolic rate), is the basic mechanism by which thyroid hormone confers protection against acute cold exposure. We treated methimazole-blocked rats (undetectable plasma T4 and T3) for a week with either subreplacement doses of T4 (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 micrograms/kg.day) or replacement doses of T4 or T3 (8 or 3 micrograms/kg.day, respectively). Sources and content of BAT nuclear T3 were studied at 25 C and after 48 h at 4 C by labeling the plasmaborne T3 (T3[T3]) with [131I]T3 and the locally generated T3 (T3[T4]) with [125I]T4. Neither the kinetics of nuclear-plasma exchange of T3[T3], the time of appearance of T3[T4] in BAT nuclei, nor NTR maximal binding capacity (0.71 ng T3/mg DNA) was affected by hypothyroidism. Kinetic analyses indicated a maximal BAT NTR occupancy of 40% at euthyroid serum T3 concentrations if T4 is not present. Replacement with T4 normalized both serum T4 and T3, while replacement with T3 normalized serum T3; for all other doses of T4, serum T4 and T3 concentrations were predictably related to the dose. 5'D-II activity decreased with increasing doses of T4, but for each dose of T4, this activity was 2-4 times greater at 4 C than at 25 C. BAT NTR occupancy normalized with 2 micrograms T4/kg in rats maintained at 25 C and with 4 micrograms T4/kg in cold-exposed rats, although in neither condition were serum T4 and T3 normalized nor more than 30% of NTR occupied by plasma T3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The actions and the mechanisms of action of epidermal growth factor (EGF) in testicular steroidogenesis were investigated using a model of primary culture of purified porcine Leydig cells from immature intact animals. EGF decreased (1.7-fold) human CG (hCG)-induced dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) accumulation in the medium whereas it enhanced (2.5-fold) that of testosterone. The maximal and half-maximal effects on both DHEA and testosterone secretions were observed at similar concentrations which were, respectively, 3 (5 x 10(-10) M) and 0.7 (11 x 10(-11) M) ng/ml EGF, after 72-h treatment. EGF effect on DHEA and testosterone secretion was similarly observed whether the cells were acutely (3 h) stimulated with hCG (1 ng/ml) or with 8-bromo-cAMP (10(-3) M). To further localize the steroidogenic biochemical steps affected by EGF, the growth factor action on steroidogenic enzyme activities was investigated. EGF increased delta 5 steroid intermediate (i.e. pregnenolone and DHEA) formation [evaluated in the presence of 10(-5) M of WIN 24540, an inhibitor of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/iosomerase (3 beta-HSDI) activity]. However, this stimulation was observed in cells when acutely (3 h) stimulated with hCG (0.01-1 ng/ml) but not when incubated with 22R-hydroxycholesterol (0.01-10 micrograms/ml). Such findings indicate that EGF did not affect cholesterol side chain cleavage cytochrome P450 activity but probably increased cholesterol substrate availability for this enzyme in the inner mitochondria. Moreover, EGF significantly (P less than 0.001) increased delta 5 steroid intermediate (i.e. pregnenolone and DHEA) but not delta 4 steroid intermediate (i.e. progesterone and androstenedione) conversion into testosterone, indicating that EGF enhances 3 beta-HSDI activity. Such effects of EGF are directly exerted on Leydig cells since EGF receptors (Kd = 16 x 10(-11) M) are present in primary cultures of purified porcine Leydig cells. Together, the present findings show that in Leydig cells from intact animals, EGF enhances the gonadotropin action on testosterone formation through an increase in the availability of cholesterol substrate in the mitochondria as well as an increase in the activity of 3 beta-HSDI.\r"

We have previously demonstrated a rapid decrease in pyroglutamyl peptidase II activity to 10% of the control level within 15 min, which returns to 70% of the control level by 1 h. This decrease results from enzyme phosphorylation by TPA-activated protein kinase-C. We now report a second phase of inactivation after longer exposure of cells to TPA. After 1 h, enzymatic activity slowly and progressively declined. By 7 h, only 15% of control activity remained. Cotreatment of cells with H-7, a protein kinase-C inhibitor, prevented this second phase of inactivation. Immunoblot experiments demonstrated a reduction in the amount of pyroglutamyl peptidase II in Y-79 membranes after long term exposure to TPA. Y-79 cells were labeled with [35S]methionine, and pyroglutamyl peptidase II was immunoprecipitated. A decreased incorporation of [35S]methionine paralleled the decrease in enzyme activity. These studies demonstrate that the second phase of inactivation after exposure to TPA is due to an inhibition of enzyme synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin responses to nutrient secretagogues were investigated in neonatally streptozotocin-injected (n-STZ) rats, i.e. an animal model of noninsulin-dependent diabetes. In the perfused pancreas 16 mM L-glutamine induced and 10 mM octanoate tended to induce (P less than 0.2) higher responses in n-STZ than in nondiabetic rats. Addition of 3.9 mM glucose potentiated responses to glutamine and octanoate more in n-STZ (3.3- and 3.4-fold) than in nondiabetic rats (1.5- and 1.9-fold). Conversely, the succinate derivative succinate monomethylester (Succ ME) induced lesser response in n-STZ rats (57% of that in nondiabetic rats) and coperfusion with 3.9 mM glucose increased the response less in n-STZ (1.4-fold) than in nondiabetic rats (3.8-fold). Pyruvate (20 mM) mimicked the potency of 3.9 mM glucose, i.e. pyruvate potentiated the response to Succ ME only nonsignificantly (1.2-fold) in n-STZ but markedly (4.9-fold) in nondiabetic rats. Dichloroacetate (20 mM) failed to affect the response to Succ ME together with pyruvate in n-STZ rats. To investigate the role of hyperglycemia for octanoate-induced secretion, nondiabetic rats were made hyperglycemic by 48-h glucose infusions. Octanoate-induced secretion from perfused pancreas was enhanced 3.8-fold after moderate hyperglycemia (13.2 +/- 0.6 mM) and 17-fold after marked hyperglycemia (22.7 +/- 0.6 mM). This positive association between response and degree of hyperglycemia was not found with a nonnutrient secretagogue, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. Results with glutamine and octanoate indicate that oxidation of nonglucose nutrients which normally do not regulate secretion is enhanced secondary to chronic hyperglycemia. Results with Succ ME and pyruvate suggest that early steps of oxidation of glucose are impaired in n-STZ rats.\r"

Neither the source nor the role of this soluble, truncated form of the membrane receptor has been determined. This study has examined the ability of a variety of rat tissues in culture to synthesize and release soluble receptor. Explants (1 mm3) of 21-day fetal, neonatal and adult rat tissues were cultured in serum-free medium and the conditioned medium analyzed for the presence of receptor. Using IGF-II binding and immunochemical techniques, receptor was detected in media from heart, kidney, liver, lung and muscle explants. [35S]cysteine labeling indicated that de novo synthesis of the soluble receptor occurs in the cultured explants and can be inhibited by cycloheximide. This rat tissue explant culture system demonstrates that soluble receptor is released by a number of tissues, and should provide a useful model for further investigations into its function and regulation.\r"

  ".W": "To study the effect of age on seizure latency, intensity, reproducibility, and mortality in genetically epilepsy-prone rats of the severe colony (GEPR-9s), 472 seizure-naive rats, ranging in age from 14 to 65 days, received a series of three audiogenic stimulations. Both the percentage of rats having one or more seizures and the percentage of seizures that were stage 9 generally increased with advancing age of the animal at the time of the first stimulation. Mean latency to seizure onset decreased while seizure intensity increased with increasing age of the animal. Reproducibility of seizure stage also increased with advancing age of the animal. The effects of senescence on seizure susceptibility were also investigated in an additional 18 prepubescent rats (25-35 days) who received three audiogenic stimulations and were tested again between the ages of 480 and 540 days with identical testing procedures. No significant changes occurred with either latency to seizure onset or seizure intensity in rats tested during prepubescence and again at senescence. Although GEPR-9s provide an excellent model of inherited seizures, latency to seizure onset, seizure intensity, and seizure reproducibility is dependent on age of the animal. Once established, however, audiogenic-induced seizures persist throughout life.\r"

Both moderate-seizure (GEPR-3) and severe-seizure (GEPR-9) animals had extensive abnormalities in brain NE concentration. Deficits of equal magnitude in GEPR-3s and GEPR-9s were found in the spinal cord, midbrain minus the inferior colliculus, inferior colliculus, hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, occipital + parietal cortex, frontal cortex, and olfactory septum. Because both types of GEPRs share these deficits and share seizure susceptibility, we hypothesize that these areas are candidates for regulation of seizure susceptibility in GEPRs. In addition, because GEPR-9s have more severe seizures than GEPR-3s and because GEPR-9s had greater NE deficits in several brain areas (cerebellum, pons-medulla, thalamus, and possibly the temporal cortex and olfactory bulbs), we hypothesize that these areas may be important in regulation of seizure severity in GEPRs. All animals used in these experiments had been protected from seizure-provoking stimuli and were naive to seizures. Because the abnormalities in NE concentration were present in seizure-predisposed animals that were protected from seizures, we conclude that these abnormalities are important components of the seizure-predisposition characteristic of GEPRs and do not result from seizure experience.\r"

No correlation between IIS and SSLI in CA4, CA3, CA1, or the dentate was evident.

Twenty-one of the 23 patients had abnormalities on SPECT scanning consisting of areas of decreased activity reflecting diminished cerebral blood flow. In 15 of these 21 patients, there was good correlation between the site of the abnormality on SPECT scan and the site of origin of seizures monitored by EEG. Of the six remaining patients, four had multifocal SPECT abnormalities, with one of the abnormal areas corresponding with an ictal site. The two remaining patients had SPECT abnormalities and major ictal EEG foci in entirely different areas. In contrast to the high proportion of abnormal SPECT scans, only 10 of 23 focal abnormalities were discovered on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Three patients who had seizures within 2 h of an initial scan were rescanned 4-5 h after injection. Focal areas of increased blood flow were noted on all three scans, although not always at the ictal site. The SPECT scan appears to be useful in interictal localization of seizure foci. Postictal scans may also be useful, although our numbers are too small to draw conclusions.\r"

Three observers independently counted ISSW in the scalp EEGs of 59 candidates for temporal lobectomy to determine the degree of lateralization of ISSW. Interobserver correlation in percentage of lateralization was excellent (r = 0.92). Thirty-one candidates were also evaluated with depth EEG (DEEG). Operative success was graded by the number of seizures reported in the second postoperative year. There was a significant progressive decrease in the number of good operative results as the degree of lateralization of ISSW lessened (p = 0.0142). Ninety-two percent of patients with greater than 90% lateralization had a good surgical outcome, whereas only 50% with less than 90% lateralization had a good outcome. Even when all DEEG-recorded seizures emerged from the side of the lobectomy, patients with greater than 90% lateralization appeared to have better outcomes than patients with less than 90% lateralization. We conclude that greater than 90% lateralization of temporal ISSW is associated with good surgical outcome, and DEEG may not be necessary in these patients. Less than 90% lateralization is associated with poor surgical outcome and the additional information provided by DEEG may be especially useful in such patients.\r"

This article presents the multicenter development of the Adolescent Psychosocial Seizure Inventory (APSI), an empirically based self-report test patterned after the Washington Psychosocial Seizure Inventory, which is used to evaluate psychosocial problems in adults. After pilot work, 120 adolescents with epilepsy from five centers in North America took the APSI and were interviewed by professionals with respect to adequacy of adjustment in eight psychosocial areas. At least one parent or guardian was also interviewed. Interrater reliability of professional ratings in each area was established. Using an item-by-item, empirically based technique, eight psychosocial scales were developed as well as three validity scales. Reliability of the scales was established by both internal consistency and test-retest procedures. Results for each adolescent are presented in profile form. These results give a visual display of the types and extent of problems that likely would be identified in a detailed professional assessment. It is anticipated that the APSI will be of value in a variety of treatment and research contexts.\r"

  ".W": "Bouts of unusually frequent partial complex seizures originating in the temporal lobe, that sometimes became secondarily generalized, induced psychotic episodes in 9 patients. In 7, the increase in seizures occurred at a time when antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were being reduced during intensive EEG monitoring with a view to surgical treatment of intractable epilepsy. According to DSM-III-R criteria, the postictal psychosis resembled an organic delusional syndrome which was paranoid in 7 and schizophreniform in 1 and an organic mood syndrome in 1. A high incidence of ictal fear, of bilateral independent epileptogenic discharge, and of small foreign tissue lesion were unexpected findings and appeared to represent risk factors, especially in patients otherwise handicapped by an epileptic personality disorder. Recognition of postictal psychosis in this setting and in others is important both prognostically and therapeutically. Postictal psychosis does not constitute a contraindication to surgical treatment of epilepsy.\r"

  ".W": "The E-isomer of 2-unsaturated valproate (E-delta 2-VPA) is a pharmacologically active metabolite of VPA that is less teratogenic and hepatotoxic than its saturated precursor. To assess potential use of E-delta 2-VPA as an alternate to VPA, a dose-response study comparing the anticonvulsant activity and neurotoxicity of E-delta 2-VPA and VPA was conducted in rats using the intravenous (i.v.) pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-infusion threshold seizure model. Assay of drug in whole brain and plasma allowed comparison of the drug concentration-effect relationships and the brain distribution characteristics of the two compounds. E-delta 2-VPA was two to three times more potent than VPA in elevating the clonic seizure threshold of PTZ, in reference to either plasma or whole-brain drug concentrations. Furthermore, much steeper response curves were observed with E-delta 2-VPA as compared with VPA. Within the pharmacologic concentration range (defined as EC25 to EC75), E-delta 2-VPA was less neurotoxic than VPA as assessed by behavioral tests. Therefore, E-delta 2-VPA has a much more favorable protective index than VPA. At low doses, the concentration ratios of brain to plasma for both E-delta 2-VPA and VPA increased markedly with increasing plasma drug concentration. E-delta 2-VPA and VPA were previously shown to exhibit saturable binding to rat plasma proteins. If we assume that uptake of drug into the CNS is limited to the equilibrium plasma free fraction in the brain microvasculature, much of the nonlinear brain distribution features of VPA could be accounted for by saturable drug plasma protein binding. On the other hand, more complex kinetics involving simultaneous saturation of plasma protein binding and blood-to-brain transport are proposed to explain the brain distribution of the unsaturated compound. In addition, the brain-to-free drug concentration ratios for both E-delta 2-VPA and VPA were below unity at high drug-concentration range, consistent with the presence of an efficient efflux mechanism of these compounds from brain.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of 12-day intraperitoneal i.p. administration of vigabatrin (GVG, gamma-vinyl GABA) to rats on the neurotransmission-related amino acids in various brain regions (cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and spinal cord), cisternal fluid (CSF) and blood was studied. Results showed that GVG administration increased the levels of GABA in cortical and subcortical regions of the brain and CSF without affecting GABA and benzodiazepine receptors in the cortex. In addition, a dose-dependent decrease was noted in the concentration of glutamate in the hippocampus and in the concentrations of aspartate and glutamine in the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. The changes in the levels of amino acids in the brain, except for that of GABA, were not reflected in the CSF, however, and the levels of amino acids in discrete brain regions did not show any correlation with those in the serum or in the CSF. The results suggest that GVG administration might suppress development and spread of seizures not only by elevating the level of the inhibitory amino acid GABA, but also by decreasing the levels of excitatory amino acids in the brain.\r"

Two groups of rats determined to be in the third week of pregnancy received 30 mg/kg as a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) dose of either PB or PHT. At various times (from 15 min to 48 h for PB and from 20 min to 16 h for PHT), the rats were killed and whole blood, plasma, maternal brain, fetal brain and liver, whole fetuses, and placentas were rapidly collected. Concentrations of PB, PHT, and its major metabolite, p-hydroxyphenytoin (HPPH), were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). PB and PHT appeared rapidly in plasma and all tissues; the maximum HPPH concentrations appeared much later. The highest PB concentrations were detected in plasma, followed by placenta, whole fetus, maternal brain, fetal liver, and fetal brain. In contrast, PHT concentrations were higher in fetal brain and liver than in whole fetuses. HPPH concentrations were much lower than PHT and were not detected in maternal brain. These results show that PB and PHT readily distribute to the rat fetus, that drug distribution within the fetus is regional, and that changes in maternal plasma concentrations of these antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are accompanied by parallel changes in fetal tissue.\r"

  ".W": "Steady-state plasma antiepileptic drug (AED) concentrations were measured at intervals throughout pregnancy and during the postnatal period in 105 women who underwent 134 pregnancies. Phenytoin (PHT) dosage had to be increased in 85% of pregnancies in which the drug was received, carbamazepine (CBZ) dosage in 70%, and phenobarbital (PB) or methylphenobarbital (MPB) dosage in 85%, in an attempt to prevent or correct a fall in plasma concentrations of the respective drugs as pregnancy progressed. The altered disposition of the AEDs usually began in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy (often before epileptic pregnant women are referred for neurological supervision), and had returned to baseline value within 4 weeks of childbirth in two thirds of the women receiving PHT. The return to the nonpregnant situation appeared to be slower for CBZ, PB, and MPB. In women studied during more than one pregnancy, the changes in AED dosage to plasma concentration ratios tended to be greater in the first than in the subsequent pregnancies. Full seizure control prior to pregnancy was associated with a more favorable outcome for freedom from seizures during pregnancy. However, the plasma level monitoring-dosage adjustment policy produced no marked improvement in overall seizure control in pregnancy. This may have occurred because some patients were seen too late in their pregnancies for the policy to have been applied optimally.\r"

In seven epileptic patients, STP (1,500-3,000 mg/day for 2 weeks) inhibited CBZ clearance by 50 +/- 16% (p = 0.001) and reduced the CBZE/CBZ plasma ratio by 45 +/- 14% (p = 0.0005). The inhibitory effect was gradually manifested over a period of 7-10 days after initiation of STP therapy. In contrast to inhibition of CBZE formation, STP had no effect (p greater than 0.05) on elimination clearance or half-life (t1/2) of CBZE in six healthy volunteers. STP most likely exerts inhibitory effects through inhibition of cytochrome P-450. This hypothesis was confirmed in the present study by the finding that a therapeutic concentration of STP (7 micrograms/mL) inhibited 10,11-epoxidation of CBZ in human liver microsomes by 40-50%. On the basis of results from this study, we propose that (a) CBZ dosage should be reduced in steps over a period of 7-10 days after initiation of STP, and (b) a CBZ dosage of 4.3 to 8.7 mg/kg/day will maintain therapeutic CBZ plasma levels of 5-10 micrograms/mL.\r"

Fifty-two patients had successful completion of the laparoscopic cholecystectomy (87%). The reasons for conversion to open cholecystectomy were acute cholecystitis (four patients), inability to define the cystic duct-common duct junction (three patients), and one patient with an unexpected choledochal cyst variant. Forty patients (77%) were discharged on the first post-operative day, and the remaining 12 patients on the second post-operative day. Thirty-three patients (63%) required only oral pain medication, and 11 patients (21%) needed no pain medication post-operatively. Fifty-one patients (98%) had resumed normal activities by the seventh post-operative day. Cholecystectomy remains the treatment of choice for biliary colic. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy minimizes length of stay in the hospital, lessens post-operative pain, allows quicker return to normal activities, and has a superior cosmetic result.\r"

Mean follow-up time was 35 months. Mercury bougienage, performed in 20 patients, was successful in 10 (50%) with no complications. Pneumatic dilation was performed as initial therapy or in those having failed previous pharmacologic therapy and/or bougienage. A successful response was achieved in 19 of 23 patients (83%), with a 3.2% complication rate. In addition, in four patients with eventual recurrence of symptoms after initial pneumatic dilation, bougienage was used as a successful alternative to repeat pneumatic treatment. The combined efficacy of both forms of dilation was 88% with a complication rate of 1.4%. These data indicate that mercury bougienage should be considered initial therapy for achalasia in view of its simplicity, safety, and acceptable efficacy, followed by pneumatic dilation if bougienage is unsuccessful. Bougienage also may be considered if eventual recurrent symptoms develop after initially successful pneumatic dilation. Surgery should be utilized only if dilation therapy fails to achieve a satisfactory response.\r"

In all cases the endoprostheses expanded to a diameter of 7 to 10 mm and achieved complete biliary tract drainage. Jaundice disappeared in 36 of the 39 patients. No early complication was observed. After a median follow-up of 121 days (range, 30 to 422 days), 19 of 36 patients are still alive and 17 died of non-procedure-related causes. Biliary re-obstruction occurred in five patients due to tumor overgrowth above or below the prosthesis (four patients) or bile encrustation (one patient).

Sixty-three consecutive patients undergoing ERCP were randomly allocated to two group. In the control group, 34 patients received isotonic sodium-chloride, and in the treated group 29 patients received 0.1 mg of octreotide acetate subcutaneously before the pancreatography. After the endoscopy, amylase levels increased to pathological range in 15 of the controls and in 3 of the treated patients, whereas lipase levels showed a pathological rise in 17 of the controls and in 5 of the treated patients. A significant difference (p less than 0.01) was observed in the amylase and lipase changes between the two groups at 90 and 180 min after pancreatography. The enzyme levels showed at 90 min, mean +/- SD amylase: controls 540 +/- 185 units/liter, treated patients 261 +/- 108 units/liter; lipase: controls 304 +/- 98 units/liter, treated patients 198 +/- 88 units/liter. These findings suggest that the use of long-acting somatostatin analogue ameliorates the enzyme increases in the serum after endoscopic pancreatography.\r"

The median value for patient age was 69 years; duration of bleeding, 2 years (range, 2 months to 9 years); and transfusion requirements, 9 units. Bleeding was occult in 54% of these patients. Placement and passage of the enteroscope was performed by a gastrointestinal endoscopy assistant. Mean passage time was 4.3 hours. Complete passage was obtained in 14% of the patients, passage into the mid-distal ileum in 69%, and passage only into the jejunum in 17%. The diagnostic yield was 26%, with the majority of lesions encountered being mucosal vascular malformations. Small intestinal enteroscopy is a reasonable diagnostic procedure before embarking on visceral angiography and surgical exploration when standard endoscopic and radiologic methods fail to disclose a diagnosis.\r"

During all admissions a standardized protocol of management defined the failure of transfusion and vasoactive drugs (conservative measures) to stop bleeding and the occurrence of early rebleeding, at which time either emergency sclerotherapy or a staple transection of the esophagus was used. The finding of a white nipple in 18 admissions (9%) did not have predictive value as regards the failure of conservative measures to stop bleeding within 24 hours or rebleeding within 5 days, and there was no association with increased mortality. In one case, a white nipple was seen to occur after spontaneous cessation of a variceal venous spurt, suggesting it is a platelet-fibrin plug. The white nipple sign is diagnostic of a varix that has bled but has no adverse prognostic significance.\r"

  ".W": "Ablation of colorectal adenomas by Nd:YAG laser energy was investigated in 271 patients. Two hundred and forty-one patients, selected because of poor surgical and medical condition or refusal of surgery, presented with incompletely removed polyps or with lesions unsuitable for endoscopic polypectomy. Thirty patients with polyposis coli were treated for rectal stump polyps after subtotal colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis. Because of insufficient follow-up (28) or malignant degeneration (23), full evaluation was possible in 196 colon adenoma and 24 polyposis patients. Complete ablation with histologic confirmation for at least 12 weeks was achieved in 150 (82%) of the 183 colon adenomas. This declined to 141 (77%) because of later recurrences in prolonged follow-up. Treatment of large adenomas was less successful than that of intermediate and small lesions: ultimate ablation in 56, 85, and 93%, respectively. Impressive was the immediate relief in 100 symptomatic elderly patients, who were bothered by frequent diarrhea, excessive mucous discharge, and incontinence. All patients survived despite major complications (7%) that mainly consisted of stenosis and hemorrhage. Rectal stump polyps were eliminated in 20 patients with polyposis coli. The remaining four had an uneventful ileoanal anastomosis for ultimately uncontrollable growth of polyps. Malignancy was discovered in 22 adenoma patients and in 1 polyposis patient. We recommend laser ablation of colorectal adenomas for small and medium-sized polyps, that cannot be removed by endoscopic polypectomy in inoperable patients or in patients refusing operation. Laser treatment for extensive adenomas seems only appropriate for symptomatic relief.\r"

To determine which point on the PAD waveform best estimated LVEDP, we performed studies in 100 adults undergoing routine diagnostic cardiac catheterization. During normal spontaneous respiration, simultaneous recordings of the electrocardiogram, PAD, and LVEDP were obtained. Three end-expiratory measurements of PAD were recorded: at the lowest point on the waveform (PAD), at 0.04 seconds (PAD 0.04), and at 0.08 seconds (PAD 0.08) after the onset of the QRS complex. The PADs were correlated with LVEDP by linear regression. PAD 0.08 correlated best with LVEDP (r = 0.88, standard error of the estimate [SEE] = 3.6 mm Hg) whereas PAD 0.04 and PAD correlated slightly less strongly (r = 0.86, SEE = 4.0 mm Hg; r = 0.82, SEE = 4.4 mm Hg respectively). Therefore, when the wedge pressure is not easily determined, PAD 0.08 may be the best point on the waveform to use when attempting to estimate LVEDP in the clinical setting.\r"

  ".W": "A double-blind, randomized study was conducted in 30 adult medical intensive care unit patients to determine if the presence of heparin in continuous-flush solutions prolongs the functional life span of radial arterial catheters compared with catheters flushed with solutions not containing heparin. Patients were consecutively entered into the study and randomly assigned to receive arterial line flush solutions containing 0.9% sodium chloride (NSS) or heparin 4 U/ml in 0.9% sodium chloride. The flow rate of each flush solution was approximately 3 ml/hr. Use of the heparin-containing flush solution resulted in a catheter survival rate of 86% at 96 hours compared with a rate of only 52% after 40 hours with NSS (p less than 0.05). In addition, the heparin-flushed catheters required significantly less manipulation to prevent catheter occlusion and arterial pressure-wave dampening (p less than 0.01). The use of NSS as a continuous flush for radial artery catheters is associated with an increased frequency of catheter occlusion and malfunctions compared with solution containing heparin, and thus is not recommended in patients with normal coagulation status and platelet count.\r"

Two hundred adult patients immediately after myocardial revascularization were randomly assigned to a specific chest tube manipulation group. The dependent variables were drainage, incidence of cardiac tamponade, incidence of surgical reentry, hemodynamic values, and number of manipulation episodes. Statistical analyses revealed no difference in any of the dependent variables when milking and stripping were used. Of the 200 patients, 78 did not require any manipulation of the chest tubes in the first 8 hours after surgery. One patient had signs of cardiac tamponade and six other patients required surgical reentry. Positioning of the connecting tube in a nondependent position assisted with the removal of drainage from the chest cavity. In conclusion, patients having myocardial revascularization did not need their chest tubes manipulated the first 8 hours after surgery. Visible drainage in the chest tube did not cause a lack of patency.\r"

They reported their sensations and the intensity of those sensations (using a 100 mm visual analog scale) within 15 minutes after tube removal. The most frequently reported sensation during chest tube removal was burning, followed by pain and pulling with mean intensities of 64, 62, and 45, respectively. Subjects reported having few sensations after the tube was removed with only five reporting soreness in the chest. The sensations and intensities did not differ for those who did and did not receive analgesia or for those having a pleural tube versus a mediastinal tube removed. The sensations were similar for the old and young subjects with younger subjects reporting higher intensities. Women reported pain more frequently than men, but the intensities of the sensations reported by men and women were not significantly different. The sensations reported during chest tube removal differ from those described in the literature and can be used to prepare patients more appropriately for chest tube removal.\r"

Two control animals were intubated and not suctioned. Animals in group 1 and 2 were suctioned every 15 minutes for 4 hours for a total of 16 suction passes. Endotracheal suctioning was performed by using a 14F suction catheter either continuously (10 seconds) or intermittently (2 seconds with, 1 second without for a total of 10 seconds) at a suction pressure of 200 mm Hg and a suction flow rate of 16 L/min. Tracheal tissue samples were examined for simplified and major simplified damage, ulceration, and ulceration with necrosis. Results indicated that all forms of damage were present with both suctioning techniques. No significant differences were found between group 1 and group 2 (Wilcoxon rank sum) for any of the alterations. Results indicate that both continuous and intermittent application of negative pressure with endotracheal suction produces significant damage to tracheal tissue.\r"

Slow continuous ultrafiltration and continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration were developed to manage fluid balance and electrolyte abnormalities without circulatory side effects. To improve urea clearance a dialysate was added to the extracorporeal circuit. This technique is called continuous arteriovenous hemodialysis (CAVHD) or, when large amounts of ultrafiltrate are removed together with the use of a substitution fluid, continuous arteriovenous hemodiafiltration. We have used CAVHD since 1987 in a medical intensive care unit. Intermittent hemodialysis is no longer used because urea clearance is adequate even in patients with severe catabolism. An initial dialysate rate of 1600 ml/hr is used. Electrolyte and glucose levels should be monitored frequently. Bleeding complications (10%) and catheter-related infection (5%) occur infrequently. An overview of the CAVHD technique is presented as well as guidelines regarding technical and nursing observations for patients receiving CAVHD treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Strict bed rest prescribed after acute myocardial infarction provides rest for the heart in an effort to lessen myocardial work. However, bed rest has been implicated as a threat to physical and psychosocial well-being. Nurses must question whether activities associated with bed rest, such as bed making by hospital personnel while the patient is occupying the bed, actually require less myocardial work than out-of-bed activities. In this study we examined cardiovascular function of 22 healthy individuals, 10 (45.5%) men and 12 (54.5%) women ranging in age from 34 to 69 years (mean 48 years), during occupied (side to side method) and unoccupied (patient up to chair) bed making. Cardiac output, heart rate, stroke volume, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, total peripheral resistance, and the ratio of preejection period to left ventricular ejection time were measured by using an impedance cardiograph and vital signs monitor. Although differences between these measurements during the two bed making procedures were statistically significant (p less than 0.001), they were not deemed clinically significant for healthy subjects because they represent transient reflexive responses to posturally induced changes in venous return rather than substantial increases in myocardial work. When the goal is minimal myocardial energy expenditure, making the bed when it is unoccupied may offer a sound alternative to making an occupied bed.\r"

Tape-recorded interviews were completed with 12 spouses, 9 patients (2 mothers and 7 fathers), 11 children, and 12 nurses. Responses were analyzed by using systematic thematic content analysis. Themes that emerged with regard to how this event affected the family unit and individuals in the family included (1) lack of communication among family members; (2) protecting children from anxiety-provoking information; (3) overriding threat, exemplified by feelings of vulnerability, uncertainty, intense emotions, and physical illness in children; (4) disruption of normal home routines; (5) changes in relationships; and (6) role conflict. Nurses' perceptions of the impact of this event on parents, spouses, and children demonstrated some incongruences with perceptions of patients and family members. Practice implications from this study include the following nursing actions: (1) eliciting more comprehensive information about relationships among family members and the impact on the family; (2) developing mechanisms to promote communication among family members; (3) making referrals to community resources such as school nurses, counselors, and chaplains; and (4) teaching nurses and parents ways to help children cope with this event.\r"

In general, the findings were consistent with those in previous studies using the Critical Care Family Needs Inventory. One striking difference was the relatively low ranking accorded by this sample to the need \"to feel there was hope.\" Parents, spouses, siblings, adult children, and \"significant others\" ranked their needs in strikingly similar ways. Family members of critically ill patients need two things most: to have honest, intelligible, and timely information and to feel assured that their loved one is being cared for by competent and caring people.

The majority of the nurses perceived family needs as important or very important, and 85% of the nurses indicated that they were able to meet family needs and had the time to do so. Cognitive family were ranked higher than psychologic or personal and physical needs. Nurses from the four intensive care units ranked family needs significantly differently, a result that may be influenced by differing patient acuity and patient length of stay on individual units. Nurses' perceptions of family needs were influenced by units worked, length of time practicing in critical care, educational preparation, and length of time in nursing.\r"

Study of the cellular mechanisms of muscle enlargement and the adaptations of muscle to strength-training programs has been difficult because of the need to analyze entire muscles. This precludes the use of human subjects in many experiments of this nature. Several animal models have been developed for the study of muscle enlargement; these models basically fall into three categories: 1) stretch hypertrophy, 2) compensatory hypertrophy, and 3) exercise-induced hypertrophy. This review attempts to analyze these models as models of muscle enlargement produced by strength training in humans. Three areas must be considered when evaluating animal models of human muscle enlargement produced by strength training: 1) response topography, 2) magnitude of enlargement, and 3) muscle fiber adaptations produced as a result of the enlargement. Based on these considerations, it is concluded that none of the animal models currently in use truly represents the human strength-training situation under all conditions. All three models, however, provide valuable information about the plasticity of skeletal muscle in response to a broad spectrum of muscle enlargement.\r"

Effects of ambient temperatures (Ta) between 4 and 18 degrees C on ventilatory parameters and respiratory heat loss (RHL) were determined in four calves. As Ta decreased, respiratory frequency decreased 29%, tidal volume increased 35%, total ventilation and RHL did not change, and the percentage of metabolic rate attributed to RHL decreased 26%. Total ventilation was stimulated by increasing inspired CO2 in six calves (Ta 4-6 degrees C), and a positive relationship existed between respiratory frequency and expired air temperature. Therefore, cold-exposed calves conserve respiratory heat by decreasing expired air temperature and dead space ventilation. Compared with thermoneutral exposure (16-18 degrees C), hypoventilation was induced by airway cold exposure (4-6 degrees C) alone and by exposing the body but not the airways to cold. Blocking nasal thermoreceptors with topical lidocaine during airway cold exposure prevented the ventilatory response but did not lower hypothalamic temperature. Hypothalamic cooling (Ta 16-18 degrees C) did not produce a ventilatory response. Thus, airway temperature but not hypothalamic temperature appears to control ventilation in cold-exposed calves.\r"

The diameter of tracheal ring 4 decreased with increasing frequency of vagal stimulation, and there was more constriction at 3 (PID3) than at 6 days postinfection (PID6) or in control cats. RL increased and Cdyn tended to decrease with increasing frequency of stimulation, but there was no difference between control and infected cats. Infected and control cats did not differ in their response to locally infused acetylcholine. Virus was consistently cultured from conjunctival, nasal, and oral mucous membranes, trachea, and main stem bronchi at PID3 but not from the trachea and main stem bronchi at PID6. Virus was never isolated distal to the main stem bronchi. Tracheal hyperresponsiveness to vagal stimulation correlates with the presence of virus at PID3 and is apparently presynaptic in origin.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of changes in abdominal pressure (Pab) on inferior vena cava (IVC) venous return were analyzed using a model of the IVC circulation based on a concept of abdominal vascular zone conditions analogous to pulmonary vascular zone conditions. We hypothesized that an increase in Pab would increase IVC venous return when the IVC pressure at the level of the diaphragm (Pivc) exceeds the sum of Pab and the critical closing transmural pressure (Pc), i.e., zone 3 conditions, but reduce IVC venous return when Pivc is below the sum of Pab and Pc, i.e., zone 2 conditions. The validity of the model was tested in 12 canine experiments with an open-chest IVC bypass. An increase in Pab produced by phrenic stimulation increased the IVC venous return when Pivc-Pab was positive but decreased the IVC venous return when Pivc - Pab was negative. The value of Pivc - Pab that separated net increases from decreases in venous return was 1.00 +/- 0.72 (SE) mmHg (n = 6). An increase in Pivc did not influence the femoral venous pressure when Pivc was lower than the sum of Pab and a constant, 0.96 +/- 0.70 mmHg (n = 6), consistent with presence of a waterfall. These results agreed closely with the predictions of the model and its computer simulation. The abdominal venous compartment appears to function with changes in Pab either as a capacitor in zone 3 conditions or as a collapsible Starling resistor with little wall tone in zone 2 conditions.\r"

The object of the present effort was to explore the possibility that this depended primarily on atrial distension. Cardiopulmonary bypass perfusion and ligation of pulmonary veins were used to isolate the left-heart chambers of anesthetized dogs. Simultaneous distension of the beating left atrium and fibrillating ventricle stimulated breathing frequency (f), whereas isolated ventricular distension did not. At other times, intervals of atrial fibrillation were imposed under two different conditions: 1) while the right heart and lungs were bypassed and systemic perfusion was provided by the left ventricle using blood returned to the left atrium by pump and 2) while the ventricles fibrillated and systemic perfusion was supplied directly by the pump. Atrial fibrillation increased left atrial pressure and stimulated f in condition 1. In condition 2, f increased only if fibrillation was associated with a rise in left atrial pressure. Vagal cooling blocked the effect of fibrillation. I conclude that left atrial distension may initiate reflex tachypnea.\r"

Intracisternal application of substance P (11 dogs) in doses of 10(-5) to 10(-4) M caused diaphragm electrical activity to change insignificantly from 19.3 +/- 1.9 to 24.8 +/- 3.2 units (P greater than 0.05), produced a moderate increase of triangularis sterni activity from 12.6 +/- 2.2 to 19.2 +/- 2.2 units (P less than 0.05), and stimulated a large increase of transversus abdominis activity from 9.4 +/- 2.7 to 28.5 +/- 2.6 units (P less than 0.01). Comparable effects were seen with similar doses of neurokinin A (8 dogs) and neurokinin B (3 dogs) administered intracisternally. Local application of substance P to the ventral medullary surface (5 dogs and 4 cats) also caused expiratory muscle activity to increase more than diaphragm activity, and in addition transversus abdominis activity increased to a larger extent than triangularis sterni activity. Furthermore, administration of the substance P antagonist [D-Pro2,D-Trp7,9]-SP to the ventral medullary surface decreased respiratory motor output, with expiratory muscles activity being attenuated to a greater extent than diaphragm activity. Application of neurotensin and N-methyl-D-asparate to the ventral surface of the medulla produced responses similar to those observed as a result of central administration of tachykinin peptides. The results suggest that 1) mammalian tachykinins are involved in the regulation of thoracic and abdominal expiratory muscle activity, 2) these muscles manifest substantial differences in their electrical responses to excitatory neuropeptides acting centrally, and 3) inputs from modulatory neurons located in this vicinity of the ventral medullary surface seem to be distributed unevenly to different expiratory premotor and/or motoneurons.\r"

Obese and lean rats were randomly assigned to a sedentary group or to a run group in which rats ran at 72-73% of their maximal O2 consumption, with the duration of exercise set to require an energy expenditure of 2.1-2.2 kcal. During the run the respiratory exchange ratio was significantly higher in the obese than in the lean rats [0.94 +/- 0.01 (SE) and 0.86 +/- 0.01, respectively], which indicate that the obese rats required 54% more carbohydrate than the lean rats. Total muscle glycogen utilization in the soleus, plantaris, and red and white gastrocnemius was not different between groups. Obese rats had total liver glycogen values five times greater than those of lean rats (833.38 +/- 101.4 and 152.8 +/- 37.5 mg, respectively) and utilized twice as much liver glycogen as their lean littermates (193.5 and 90.4 mg, respectively). The obese rats exhibited higher blood glucose and insulin concentrations than the lean rats during the run. These findings indicate that, despite their characteristic insulin resistance, the obese Zucker rats had a greater dependency on carbohydrate as a substrate during exercise than their lean littermates and that the major source of this carbohydrate was liver glycogen.\r"

In the present study the in situ isometric contractility and endurance of a pharyngeal dilator, the geniohyoid muscle, were compared with properties of the diaphragm in 12 anesthetized artificially ventilated cats. The contraction time (means +/- SE) of the geniohyoid (27 +/- 2 ms) was shorter than that of the diaphragm (36 +/- 3 ms; P less than 0.0005), as was the half-relaxation time (29 +/- 2 vs. 45 +/- 4 ms; P less than 0.002). The faster contraction and relaxation of the geniohyoid compared with the diaphragm were appropriately reflected in the shape of the force-frequency curves for the two muscles, with that of the geniohyoid located to the right of the diaphragm force-frequency curve. The endurance properties of the two muscles were assessed using repetitive stimulation at 40 Hz in trains lasting 0.33 s, with one train repeated every second. The ratio of force at the end of 2 min of repetitive stimulation to initial force was 0.67 +/- 0.06 for the geniohyoid and 0.15 +/- 0.03 for the diaphragm (P less than 0.00001). After the repetitive stimulation, the muscle force generated in response to a range of stimulus frequencies was reduced to a greater extent for the diaphragm than for the geniohyoid muscle. These results indicate that the geniohyoid muscle has a faster physiological profile than does the diaphragm yet is relatively resistant to fatigue when driven at high rates.\r"

We examined the electromyogram expiratory activity of the thyroarytenoid muscle in seven 11- to 18-day-old awake nonsedated lambs exposed to an inspired O2 fraction of 0.08 for 18 min. The lambs breathed through a face mask and a pneumotachograph. During baseline prehypoxic breathing, the thyroarytenoid muscle was largely inactive in each awake lamb. Unexpectedly, no recruitment of the thyroarytenoid muscle was recorded during hypoxia in any of the seven lambs; simultaneous examination of the flow-volume curves revealed an absence of expiratory airflow braking. Also unexpectedly, marked expiratory activity of the thyroarytenoid muscle was recorded, with each expiration occurring within less than 10 s after the return to room air. The resulting delay of expiration was apparent in the flow-volume loops. Thus, in awake 11- to 18-day-old lambs, 1) active expiratory glottic adduction is absent during hypoxia and 2) a return from hypoxia to room air results in prolonged expiration as well as active glottic adduction that controls end-expiratory lung volume.\r"

There was considerable variation in height jumped during an activity session both within and between rats. The two highest-jumping rats attained a displacement of center of mass of approximately 30 cm, estimated to be approximately 67% of the maximum attainable. The two lowest-jumping rats jumped to approximately 30% of the estimated maximum. The activity was described as \"habitual activity\" rather than \"training\" because there were no significant increases in the height of jumping by any rat over the period of activity. The isometric properties of medial gastrocnemius (MG) and soleus muscles were studied in terminal experiments on anesthetised rats. Five significant effects on MG were evoked by this pattern of exercise (\"habituation\"): 1) a 15-18% increase in force at frequencies of stimulation between 60 and 150 Hz and a 15% increase in maximum tetanic tension to 14.9 N, 2) a 3% increase in the maximum rate of rise of tetanic force to 3.4% of maximum tetanic tension per millisecond, 3) an increase in fatigability expressed as a smaller fatigue index in active rats (33%) than in controls (58%), 4) a decrease of 4% in the percentage of type IIa muscle fibers, and 5) an increase of 6% in the percentage of type II fibers that could not be classified with certainty as IIa or IIb.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Effects of XO and AO were studied by inactivation with a tungsten-enriched diet (0.7 g/kg) and inhibition of XO by allopurinol (100 microM) or AO by menadione (3.5 microM). PMN effects were studied by preventing endothelial adhesion with the monoclonal antibody IB4 (10 microM). Vascular permeability was evaluated by determining the capillary filtration coefficient (Kf,c) measured before and after I-R in all experimental conditions. Reperfusion after 2 h of ischemia significantly increased pulmonary capillary permeability (Kf,c changed from 0.096 +/- 0.014 to 0.213 +/- 0.025 ml.min-1. cmH2O-1.100 g-1), and this increase was blocked by the addition of catalase (50,000 U) at reperfusion (baseline Kf,c was 0.125 +/- 0.023 and 0.116 +/- 0.014 ml.min-1.cmH2O-1.100 g-1). XO inactivation with the tungsten-supplemented diet and XO inhibition with allopurinol prevented the Kf,c increase observed after I-R (0.183 +/- 0.030 to 0.185 +/- 0.033 and 0.126 +/- 0.018 to 0.103 +/- 0.005 ml.min-1.cmH2O-1.100 g-1). Inhibition of AO had no effect on I-R injury (Kf,c 0.108 +/- 0.011 to 0.167 +/- 0.014 ml.min-1.cmH2O-1.100 g-1). Preventing PMN adhesion resulted in significant attenuation of the change in Kf,c associated with I-R (0.112 +/- 0.032 to 0.090 +/- 0.065 ml.min-1.cmH2O-1.100 g-1). We conclude that XO and PMN adherence, but not AO, are involved in the increased capillary permeability associated with I-R.\r"

The purpose of the present experiment was to determine whether it was possible to pharmacologically augment diaphragm blood flow and reverse fatigue by the administration of norepinephrine. Four groups of studies were performed, all employing our previously described in situ isometric canine diaphragm strip preparation (Supinski et al., J. Appl. Physiol. 60: 1789-1796, 1986). Group I studies examined the effects of norepinephrine on the contractility of the nonfatigued diaphragm in normotensive dogs, group II studies examined the effects of this drug on the contractility of the fatigued diaphragm in normotensive animals, and group III studies examined the effect of this drug on the contractility of the fatigued diaphragm in hypotensive animals. Group IV studies examined the effect of norepinephrine in normotensive animals in which the phrenic artery was cannulated and pump perfused at constant flow. Fatigue was induced in group II, III, and IV studies by rhythmically stimulating the diaphragm via intramuscular electrodes. Norepinephrine had no effect on the contractility of the nonfatigued diaphragm (group I). In normotensive (group II) and hypotensive animals (group III), norepinephrine elicited dramatic increases in arterial blood pressure and phrenic arterial flow and produced a significant upshift in the force-frequency curve of the fatigued diaphragm. However, when phrenic flow was held constant (group IV experiments), norepinephrine failed to augment the contractility of the fatigued diaphragm. These results indicate that 1) norepinephrine can increase phrenic blood flow and augment the contractility of the fatigued diaphragm in both normotensive and hypotensive conditions and 2) this effect of norepinephrine to partially reverse fatigue is secondary to its action to augment diaphragmatic blood flow.\r"

The subjects were studied while exposed for 90 min to neutral environmental conditions (ambient temperature 28 degrees C, relative humidity 40%) in a direct calorimeter. The values of M and H were not modified by the phase of the menstrual cycle. Furthermore, in both phases the subjects were in thermal equilibrium because M was similar to H (69.7 +/- 1.8 and 72.1 +/- 1.8 W in F and 70.4 +/- 1.9 and 71.4 +/- 1.7 W in L phases, respectively). Tympanic temperature (Tty) was 0.24 +/- 0.07 degrees C higher in the L than in the F phase (P less than 0.05), whereas mean skin temperature (Tsk) was unchanged. Calculated skin thermal conductance (Ksk) was lower in the L (17.9 +/- 0.6 W.m-2.degrees C-1) than in the F phase (20.1 +/- 1.1 W.m-2.degrees C-1; P less than 0.05). Calculated skin blood flow (Fsk) was also lower in the L (0.101 +/- 0.008 l.min-1.m-2) than in the F phase (0.131 +/- 0.015 l.min-1.m-2; P less than 0.05). Differences in Tty, Ksk, and Fsk were not correlated with changes in plasma progesterone concentration. It is concluded that, during the L phase, a decreased thermal conductance in women exposed to a neutral environment allows the maintenance of a higher internal temperature.\r"

In the CPI2 and CAV2 groups, a lower respiratory illness developed by day 3 postinfection with clinical recovery by day 14. In the CAV2-CPI2 group, puppies were inoculated initially with CAV2 and 12 days later with CPI2. In this group, illness persisted until day 14 after infection with CPI2. Lung resistance (RL), dynamic (Cdyn) and static (Cst) lung compliance, functional residual capacity (FRC), and responsiveness to aerosolized histamine were measured before infection and at periodic intervals until 239 +/- 43 days of age. Lung function data were analyzed using a longitudinal random effects model. In all groups, FRC, Cst, and Cdyn increased with age. In all infected groups, the regression slopes for Cdyn were steeper than in controls. RL decreased linearly with age without group slope differences. Histamine reactivity increased with age, but there were no differences in slope among groups. Lung pathological studies showed areas of obliterative bronchiolitis and chronic small airways inflammation particularly in the CAV2 and CAV2-CPI2 groups. Thus, viral bronchiolitis produces chronic small airways inflammation in beagle puppies and alters the changes in lung function occurring with growth. Histamine reactivity increases with age and is not modified by viral infection.\r"

Four rows of radiopaque markers were sewn onto muscle bundles of the costal and crural diaphragm between their origin on the central tendon and their insertion on the rib cage and spine. The length of the diaphragm (L) was determined from the projection images of marker rows using biplane fluoroscopy. Measurements were made at lung volumes between total lung capacity and functional residual capacity before and after the infusion of Ringer lactate solution into the abdominal cavity. In contrast to relaxation, during tetanic stimulation the active lengths of the muscle bundles were similar at all volumes, but the diaphragm assumed different shapes. Although the small differences in active muscle length with volume and liquid loads are consistent with only small changes in muscle force output, Pdi varied by a factor of greater than or equal to 5. There was no single L/Pdi curve that fitted all data during 50-Hz stimulations. We conclude that under these experimental conditions Pdi is not a unique measure of the force produced by the diaphragm and that lung volume, chest wall geometry, and respiratory system impedance are important determinants of the mechanical efficiency of the diaphragm as a pressure generator.\r"

  ".W": "The pulmonary pathology for which a patient receives ventilatory support may increase the risk of developing barotrauma, because an underlying disease process may weaken the vasculature and render the lung more susceptible to damage by mechanical ventilation. We determined the response of isolated young rabbit lungs to mechanical ventilation after oleic acid (OA) injury. New Zealand White rabbits (0.7-1.3 kg) were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (30 mg/kg), tracheotomized, and exsanguinated. The heart and lungs were isolated and perfused with autologous blood at a constant flow. The capillary filtration coefficient (Kf,c, in ml.min-1.cmH2O-1.100 g wet wt-1) and pulmonary arterial (Ppa) and venous pressures were determined before and 30 and 60 min after oleic acid administration (OA group; 0.2 ml into the venous reservoir), ventilation alone (Vent group; peak inspiratory pressure = 25 cmH2O), or oleic acid combined with ventilation (OA + Vent group). Ppa transiently increased by 4.21 +/- 0.822 cmH2O after OA administration but then returned to approximately control values. Baseline Kf,c values for OA (0.288 +/- 0.042), Vent (0.296 +/- 0.035), or OA + Vent (0.276 +/- 0.028) groups were not significantly different from each other. Kf,c after either OA administration (0.45 +/- 0.066) or Vent (0.35 +/- 0.75) were not significantly different from each other or from baseline measurements. In the group ventilated after OA administration (OA + Vent), Kf,c (0.883 +/- 0.148) increased significantly from baseline (P less than 0.001) and was significantly different from all other treatment groups. We conclude that the combination of minimal OA injury and ventilation was more deleterious to the lung than either one alone.\r"

Little is known about the magnitude and pattern of blood pressure response and resultant effects on left ventricular (LV) function during this form of intense isometric exercise. We monitored brachial intra-arterial pressure and LV ejection fraction (LVEF) during upright isometric dead lifting performed on a force platform. Fourteen healthy male subjects (age 27 yr) maintained maximal sustained isometric dead lift (140 +/- 34 kg) for 32 s. LVEF was measured by 99mTc first-pass radionuclide ventriculography. Mean arterial pressure increased from 107 +/- 15 mmHg at rest to a peak of 174 +/- 28 mmHg and fell precipitously to 88 +/- 13 mmHg within 10 s after release of the dead lift. LVEF decreased from 63 +/- 8 to 51 +/- 14% (P less than 0.02) in seven subjects with technically acceptable ventriculograms. We conclude that maximal upright isometric dead-lift exercise produces a marked increase in arterial pressure and corresponding LV afterload that is associated with a transient reduction in LVEF in normal men.\r"

Hypoxemia requiring mechanical ventilation occurs, accompanied by a substantial pulmonary hypertension, a large intra-alveolar protein leak, peripheral neutropenia, and pathological features of marked neutrophil infiltration with extensive hyaline membrane formation. Pretreatment with indomethacin abolishes postlavage pulmonary hypertension, preserves a slightly better lung function with higher arterial PO2, and prevents the postlavage peripheral neutropenia found in untreated animals. Pretreatment with a thromboxane A2 receptor blocker (L 655,240, Merck Frosst, Canada) also completely attenuated pulmonary hypertension, providing evidence that thromboxane A2 mediates pulmonary arterial hypertension after lung lavage. However, specific thromboxane receptor blockade had no other long-lasting beneficial effects on the ongoing injury in this model.\r"

ATII cells were isolated to high purity (greater than 85%) from rabbit lungs by enzymatic digestion and Percoll centrifugation and suspended in Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM). They were then coincubated with either 500 microM xanthine and 10 mU/ml xanthine oxidase (XO; pH 7.4; 25 degrees C) or 300 microM H2O2. The extracellular H2O2 concentration [H2O2] was measured in the following conditions over a 60-min period: 1) MEM alone, 2) untreated (control), 3) 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (ATZ)-treated, or 4) 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene-treated ATII cells. Addition of xanthine and XO to MEM alone resulted in a time-dependent increase in [H2O2], reaching a plateau value of approximately 300 microM after 45 min. In the presence of control ATII cells (1 x 10(6) cells/ml), [H2O2] remained at control levels. When coincubated with 300 microM H2O2, ATII cells cleared H2O2 at a higher rate than an equivalent amount of free catalase. Incubation with ATZ decreased ATII cell catalase activity by 89% and significantly impaired their ability to clear H2O2 (half-life = 18.1 +/- 2.7 vs. 1.3 +/- 0.1 min, P less than 0.01). ATZ-treated cells were more susceptible to oxidant injury, as shown by their decreased ability to exclude trypan blue after 60 min of H2O2 exposure. On the other hand, glutathione-depleted cells scavenged H2O2 at the same rate as controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

SSA increased abruptly and was almost constant during handgrip, accompanied by an increase in sweat rate, whereas skin blood flow showed no significant change during the handgrip. MSA showed a time-dependent increase during the course of handgrip. During arterial occlusion of the working forearm after handgrip, SSA decayed to the precontraction control level, whereas MSA remained at a higher level than during control. During involuntary biceps muscle contraction induced by electrical stimulation, both SSA and MSA increased. The results suggest that the SSA response during voluntary handgrip, which was demonstrated to contain mainly sudomotor activity, might be influenced by central command and input from peripheral mechanoreceptors but be influenced little by input from muscle chemoreceptors.\r"

Initial experiments determined changes in plasma volume (PV) occurring over this period by use of the Evans Blue dye dilution technique. PV was determined immediately before tail suspension and on day 7 of the stimulus. PV, erythrocyte volume, and total blood volume were all significantly diminished on day 7, whereas hematocrit was unchanged. Other rats were instrumented with pulsed Doppler flow probes on the ascending aorta for determination of cardiac output and with arterial and venous catheters 7-10 days before study. Immediately before tail suspension, control cardiac output, mean arterial blood pressure, and heart rate values were determined. In addition, BRR sensitivity was estimated both before and after intravenous administration of a V2-receptor antagonist by assessing the slope of the pulse interval-mean arterial blood pressure relationship in response to a series of pressor doses of phenylephrine. BRR sensitivity was determined on the last day of head-down tilt, 1 min after release from tail suspension, and 10 min after administration of a specific V2-vasopressinergic antagonist. BRR sensitivity tended to fall on day 7 of tail suspension compared with control and was significantly increased after release. However, BRR sensitivity was not altered by intravenous V2 antagonist administration either before tail suspension or after release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One group (T) of female rats trained on a treadmill (10 degrees incline, 30 m/min) for 1 h/day 5 days/wk for 10 wk before becoming pregnant. A second group (UT) was run at the same speed and incline for 10 min/day 5 days/wk for 2 wk. T and UT rats were bred until pregnant. Skeletal muscle blood flow, RBF, and VBF were measured at pre-EX and at 1 and 10 min of EX (10 degrees incline, 30 m/min). No differences were observed before or during exercise between the two groups in RBF and VBF, heart rate, or mean arterial pressure. Both groups experienced decreases in VBF (except liver) and RBF from pre-EX to EX. In most muscles skeletal muscle blood flow increased for both groups from pre-EX to EX. Neither group experienced a change in mean arterial pressure from pre-EX to EX, but heart rate increased significantly for both groups. No differences were observed between groups in fetal number, fetal weight, or fetal resorptions. It was concluded that training does not significantly attenuate the reduction in RBF and VBF in pregnant rats that occurs during an acute bout of submaximal EX and that training does not affect fetal weight or fetal number.\r"

Total lung aerosol deposition and airway caliber as assessed by pulmonary airflow resistance (RL) were measured every 20-30 min up to 4 h after the challenges. Aerosol deposition was measured by monitoring aerosol concentration continuously with a laser aerosol photometer while the sheep rebreathed 1.0-micron-diam inert oil droplets delivered by a 0.25-liter bag-in-box system driven by a respiratory pump at a breathing frequency of 30 breaths/min. Total accumulated deposition at the fifth breath (AD5) as percentage of the initial aerosol concentration was determined and used as an aerosol deposition index. Percent changes in AD5 from baseline were compared with corresponding changes in RL. Both RL and AD5 increased after Cl, CA, and HA: 192-477% for RL and 23-44% for AD5 (P less than 0.05). Mean RL return to baseline values 1 h after CI and HA and 2 h after CA. Mean AD5 returned to baseline at 1 h post-HA. In contrast, mean AD5 remained elevated for 2-4 h after CI and CA (P less than 0.05), and the increased AD5 could not be reversed by a bronchodilator aerosol. The persistence of enhanced aerosol deposition long after the return of RL to baseline suggests that complete recovery of airway conditions after CI and CA takes much longer than predicted by RL.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91170059\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of insulin on carbohydrate metabolism in atrophied rat soleus muscle are increased after unweighting by tail-cast suspension. This work has been extended by testing the effect of unweighting on the response of carbohydrate metabolism to isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist. Isoproterenol promoted glycogen degradation more in the unweighted than in the weight-bearing soleus but showed no differences in the extensor digitorum longus, which is unresponsive to hindlimb unweighting. In soleus muscles depleted of glycogen, to avoid varied inhibitory effects of glycogen on glycogen synthesis, isoproterenol inhibited this process more in the unweighted muscle. Isoproterenol did not have a greater inhibitory effect on net uptake of 2-deoxy-D[1,2-3H]glucose by the unweighted muscle. Measurements of intracellular 2-deoxy-[3H]glucose 6-phosphate and 3-O-methyl-D-[1-3H]glucose, which cannot be phosphorylated, showed that isoproterenol inhibited glucose phosphorylation but not transport. This effect could be explained by an increase of glucose 6-phosphate, an inhibitor of hexokinase. At 100 microU insulin/ml but not at a lower amount (10 microU/ml), isoproterenol inhibited hexose phosphorylation more in the control than in the unweighted muscle. This result may be explained by greater insulin antagonism in the unweighted muscle owing to increased insulin sensitivity. However, insulin antagonism of isoproterenol stimulation of glycogenolysis or inhibition of glycogenesis was not altered by unweighting. Therefore, for some aspects of carbohydrate metabolism, the unweighted muscle has an increased response to beta-adrenergic activation, just as this muscle shows increased responses to insulin.\r"

In a pentobarbital-anesthetized closed-chest canine model, LV stroke volume (SLLV) was measured by integration from an aortic flow probe signal. MR was induced by a regurgitant ring. ITP was elevated over apnea by means of intermittent positive-pressure ventilation (IPPV), asynchronous (asynch) high-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV), and cardiac cycle-specific (synch) HFJV. IPPV resulted in the greatest increase in ITP. MR caused a fall in SVLV and a rise in LV filling pressure that were not altered by IPPV. Compared with IPPV or apnea, both asynch and synch HFJV increased SVLV and reduced LV filling pressures (P less than 0.05). Systolic synch HFJV induced a greater increase in SVLV (32%) than diastolic synch HFJV (26%) despite similar ventilatory settings. Our data suggest that when LV contractility is normal but MR impairs forward flow, cardiac cycle-specific increases in ITP will augment forward flow.\r"

The ratios of the estimated magnitude spectra of transmission of each of the chest wall sites to the tracheal site were determined, with the resulting spectra representing effective transfer functions of transmission in the subglottal system. For the group, the transfer functions exhibited a single peak, which occurred at 143 +/- 13 Hz (mean +/- SD) with a quality factor (Q) of 2.0 +/- 0.2 for the upper chest wall site and at 129 +/- 6 Hz with a Q of 2.2 +/- 0.4 for the lower site. The trend of decreasing spectral energy with increasing frequency was indicated by roll-offs of -10 +/- 4 and -17 +/- 5 dB/octave from 300 to 600 Hz at the two sites, respectively. The fundamental radial mode of a model thoracic cavity, which is a large rigid cylinder filled with lossless lung tissue, provides a good estimate of the observed low-frequency resonance. This agreement suggests that thoracic cavity resonances may have particularly important effects on sound transmission at frequencies below approximately 250 Hz, where the magnitude of parenchymal attenuation appears to be small.\r"

  ".W": "The goal of this study was to determine whether neutrophils that adhere to the vascular endothelium in association with neurogenic inflammation in the respiratory tract migrate out of the blood vessels or whether they detach and reenter the circulation. We also sought to determine whether the fate of the neutrophils is influenced by neutral endopeptidase (NEP), an enzyme that degrades the tachykinins that produce neurogenic inflammation. Neutrophils in the tracheal mucosa of anesthetized pathogen-free rats were examined 5 min or 4 h after neurogenic inflammation was produced by an injection of capsaicin (100 or 200 micrograms/kg iv). In whole mounts of these tracheae stained histochemically for myeloperoxidase, adherent intravascular neutrophils had a spherical or teardrop (regular) shape and migrating neutrophils had a polarized amoeboid (irregular) shape. The number of regular neutrophils in the tracheae was increased at both times, but the increase at 4 h was only half that present at 5 min. The reduction between 5 min and 4 h was not offset by an appreciable increase in the number of irregular neutrophils, unless NEP was inhibited by phosphoramidon. We interpret these results as indicating that the rapid adherence of neutrophils to the vascular endothelium after an injection of capsaicin is followed by a gradual reentry of the neutrophils into the circulation and comparatively little neutrophil migration. However, when the effect of the stimulus is increased and/or prolonged by inhibition of NEP, some of the adherent neutrophils migrate out of the vessels. Thus the activity of NEP can regulate both the magnitude of the neutrophil adherence and the fate of the adherent cells.\r"

The electromyographic (EMG) activity of the triangularis sterni, the rectus abdominis, the external oblique, and the transversus abdominis was studied in 10 dogs light anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium. EMGs were recorded during spontaneous steady-state breathing in supine and prone suspended animals both before and after cervical vagotomy. We also measured the end-expiratory lung volume [functional residual capacity (FRC)] in supine and prone positions to assess the mechanical role of expiratory muscle activation in prone dogs. Spontaneous breathing in the prone posture elicited a significant recruitment of the triangularis sterni, the external oblique, and the transversus abdominis (P less than 0.05). Bilateral cervical vagotomy eliminated the postural activation of the external oblique and the transversus abdominis but not the triangularis sterni. Changes in posture during control and after cervical vagotomy were associated with an increase in FRC. However, changes in FRC, on average, were 132.3 +/- 33.8 (SE) ml larger (P less than 0.01) postvagotomy. We conclude that spontaneous breathing in prone anesthetized dogs is associated with a marked phasic expiratory recruitment of rib cage and abdominal muscles. The present data also indicate that by relaxing at end expiration the expiratory muscles of the abdominal region are directly responsible for generating roughly 40% of the tidal volume.\r"

The causes of the BP elevations, which contribute significantly to nocturnal hypertension in OSA, have not been defined precisely. To assess the relative contribution of arterial hypoxemia, we observed mean arterial pressure (MAP) changes following obstructive apneas in 11 OSA patients during non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep and then under three experimental conditions: 1) apnea with O2 supplementation; 2) hypoxemia (SaO2 80%) without apnea; and 3) arousal from sleep with neither hypoxemia nor apnea. We found that apneas recorded during O2 supplementation (SaO2 nadir 93.6% +/- 2.4; mean +/- SD) in six subjects were associated with equivalent postapneic MAP elevations compared with unsupplemented apneas (SaO2 nadir 79-82%): 18.8 +/- 7.1 vs. 21.3 +/- 9.2 mmHg (mean change MAP +/- SD); in the absence of respiratory and sleep disruption in eight subjects, hypoxemia was not associated with the BP elevations observed following apneas: -5.4 +/- 19 vs. 19.1 +/- 7.8 mmHg (P less than 0.01); and in five subjects, auditory arousal alone was associated with MAP elevation similar to that observed following apneas: 24.0 +/- 8.1 vs. 22.0 +/- 6.9 mmHg. We conclude that in NREM sleep postapneic BP elevations are not primarily attributable to arterial hypoxemia. Other factors associated with apnea termination, including arousal from sleep, reinflation of the lungs, and changes of intrathoracic pressure, may be responsible for these elevations.\r"

(Nature Lond. 284: 515-521, 180) hypothesized that it is vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) that is cotransmitted with acetylcholine. Heinz-Erian et al. (Science Wash. DC 229: 1407-1408, 1985) reported that VIP innervation is sparse in the skin of persons with cystic fibrosis (CF). A corresponding attenuation of active vasodilation in these subjects would be evidence that VIP is involved in this effector mechanism of human thermor-regulation. Immunocytochemical analysis of skin biopsies from four men with CF confirmed that VIP innervation was sparse. We also analyzed immunoreactivity for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP; normal), substance P (normal), and neuropeptide Y (low). VIP-immunoreactive Merkel cells were abnormal. Despite sparse VIP-immunoreactive innervation, our CF subjects' cutaneous vascular responses to hyperthermia were normal. Because VIP was not completely absent, this evidence is insufficient to rule out VIP as the vasodilator transmitter. However, the CGRP and substance P innervation we observed could mean that release of one or both of these peptides was the mechanism of the fully developed active cutaneous vasodilation.\r"

Experiments were done in anesthetized paralyzed rabbits that were oxygenated via an endotracheal tube with 50% humidified oxygen and kept in either the supine or the lateral position. A small area of an intercostal space was cleared of the intercostal muscles down to the endothoracic fascia. Subsequently a \"pleural window\" was opened by stripping the endothoracic fascia over a 0.2-cm2 surface and leaving the parietal pleura (approximately 10 microns thick). Direct micropuncture through the pleural window was performed with 2- to 3-microns-tip pipettes connected to a servo-null pressure-measuring system. We recorded pleural liquid pressure and, after inserting the pipette tip into the lung, we recorded interstitial pressure from subpleural lung tissue. Depth of recording for interstitial pressure averaged 263 +/- 122 (SD) microns. We report data gathered at 26, 53, and 84% lung height (relative to the most dependent portion of the lung). For the three heights, interstitial pressure was -9.8 +/- 3, -10.1 +/- 1.6, and -12.5 +/- 3.7 cmH2O, respectively, whereas the corresponding pleural liquid pressure was -3.4 +/- 0.5, -4.4 +/- 1, and -5.2 +/- 0.3 cmH2O, respectively.\r"

In model 1, diaphragmatic descent was treated as if it were a \"piston in a cylinder.\" In contrast, model 2 incorporated thoracic configuration as well as inspiratory changes in rib cage diameter and diaphragm shape. In one dog, a computerized tomography reconstruction of Vdi was compared with Vdi calculated using the models. Vdi calculated from model 2 lay within 11% of the computerized tomographic value, whereas Vdi based on model 1 was 30% larger. In seven animals, radiopaque markers were sewn to the right costal diaphragm. Digitized fluoroscopic images were used to measure intermarker distance, an index of muscle shortening. For four tidal breaths per dog, in model 2 Vdi averaged 49 +/- 18% of tidal volume and was weakly correlated with costal diaphragm muscle shortening (R = 0.74). It is concluded that Vdi can be estimated from linear dimensions in the coronal plane, provided that inspiratory changes in rib cage diameter and diaphragmatic shape change are taken into account.\r"

Blood flow was adjusted initially to keep pulmonary arterial pressure at 20 cmH2O and left atrial and airway pressures at 6 and 8 cmH2O, respectively (zone 3). Once adjusted, flow was kept constant throughout the experiment. In each lung, pressures were measured in subpleural 20- to 50-microns-diam arterioles and venules with the micropipette servo-nulling method during normoxia (PO2 approximately 100 Torr) and hypoxia (PO2 less than 50 Torr). In normoxic adult ferret lungs, approximately 40% of total vascular resistance was in arteries, approximately 40% was in microvessels, and approximately 20% was in veins. With hypoxia, the total arteriovenous pressure drop increased by 68%. Arterial and venous pressure drops increased by 92 and 132%, respectively, with no change in microvascular pressure drop. In 3- to 5-wk-old ferret lungs, the vascular pressure profile during normoxia and the response to hypoxia were similar to those in adult lungs. We conclude that, in ferret lungs, arterial and venous resistances increase equally during hypoxia, resulting in increased microvascular pressures for fluid filtration.\r"

This study assesses the functional significance of this hepatic innervation by determining the effect of a selective hepatic vagotomy (HV) on running endurance time during submaximal activity in rats subjected to an overnight 50% food restriction. The time to exhaustion was similar for the groups of HV and sham-operated (SHM) rats [66 +/- 15 vs. 64 +/- 21 (SD) min]. The HV group was associated with higher resting levels (P less than 0.05) of hepatic glycogen and plasma glucose. No significant differences were observed between HV and SHM rats at rest and after exercise for muscle glycogen, free fatty acids, insulin, glucagon, and lactate concentrations. These data indicate that if hepatic glucoreceptors do exist and contribute to the metabolic regulation of exercise, their functional significance is secondary to more important regulatory mechanisms.\r"

Sixteen sedentary men, aged 18-33 yr, were trained using high-intensity interval and prolonged continuous cycling in the supine (STG; supine training group) or upright (UTG; upright training group) posture 4 days/wk, 40 min/day, for 8 wk, while seven male subjects served as nontraining controls. After training, maximal O2 uptake measured during supine and upright cycling, respectively, increased significantly (P less than 0.05) by 22.9 and 16.1% in the STG and by 6.0 and 14.6% in the UTG. No significant cardiovascular adaptations were observed at rest. During submaximal supine cycling at 100 W, significant increases in end-diastolic volume (21%) and stroke volume (22%) (radionuclide ventriculography and CO2 rebreathing) and decreases in heart rate, blood pressure, and systemic vascular resistance occurred in the STG, whereas only a significant decrease in blood pressure occurred in the UTG. During upright cycling at 100 W, a significant decrease in blood pressure occurred in the STG, whereas significant increases in end-diastolic volume (17%) and stroke volume (18%) and decreases in blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance occurred in the UTG. Volume of myocardial contractility, ejection fraction, and systolic blood pressure-to-end-systolic volume ratio did not change significantly after training when measured during supine and upright cycling in either training group. Blood volume increased significantly in the UTG but remained unchanged in the STG.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At baseline, airway responsiveness did not correlate with any BAL cell population. When data obtained after allergen challenge were included in the analysis, 44% of the variability of airway responsiveness was explained by a multiple regression model with BAL eosinophils as a directly correlated (P = 0.002) independent variable and with BAL macrophages as an inversely correlated (P = 0.045) independent variable. Changes in airway responsiveness after allergen challenge were predicted (82% of variance explained) by a model with BAL eosinophils and BAL lymphocytes as directly correlated (P = 0.0002 and P = 0.03, respectively) independent variables. We conclude that, in stable asymptomatic asthma, baseline airway responsiveness does not correlate with the presence in the airways of inflammatory and immunoeffector cells that can be recovered by BAL. Nevertheless the allergen-induced increase in airway responsiveness is associated with an influx of eosinophils and lymphocytes in the bronchial lumen.\r"

  ".W": "The speed-torque relationship of the right knee extensor muscle group was investigated in eight untrained subjects (28 +/- 2 yr old). Torque was measured at a specific knee angle during isokinetic concentric or eccentric actions at nine angular velocities (0.17-3.66 rad/s) and during isometric actions. Activation was by \"maximal\" voluntary effort or by transcutaneous tetanic electrical stimulation that induced an isometric torque equal to 60% (STIM 1) or 45% (STIM 2) of the voluntary isometric value. Torque increased (P less than 0.05) to 1.4 times isometric as the speed of eccentric actions increased to 1.57 rad/s for STIM 1 and STIM 2. Thereafter, increases in eccentric speed did not further increase torque. Torque did not increase (P greater than 0.05) above isometric for voluntary eccentric actions. As the speed of concentric actions increased from 0.00 to 3.66 rad/s, torque decreased (P less than 0.05) more (P less than 0.05) for both STIM 1 and STIM 2 (two-thirds) than for voluntary activation (one-half). As a result of these responses, torque changed three times as much (P less than 0.05) across speeds of concentric and eccentric actions with artificial (3.4-fold) than voluntary (1.1-fold) activation. The results indicate that with artificial activation the normalized speed-torque relationship of the knee extensors in situ is remarkably similar to that of isolated muscle. The relationship for voluntary activation, in contrast, suggests that the ability of the central nervous system to activate the knee extensors during maximal efforts depends on the speed and type of muscle action performed.\r"

In 16 anesthetized dogs, we simultaneously measured EI (3rd and 4th interspaces) and parasternal intercostal (PA) (3rd interspace) electromyogram and length. Muscle length was measured by sonomicrometry and expressed as a percentage of resting length (%LR). During resting breathing, each muscle was electrically active and shortened to a similar extent. Sequential EI muscle denervation (3rd and 4th interspaces) followed by PA denervation (3rd interspace) demonstrated significant reductions in the degree of inspiratory shortening for each muscle. Mean EI muscle shortening of the third and fourth interspaces decreased from -3.4 +/- 0.5 and -3.0 +/- 0.4% LR (SE) under control conditions to -0.2 +/- 0.2 and -0.8 +/- 0.3% LR, respectively, after selective denervation of each of these muscles (P less than 0.001 for each). After selective denervation of the PA muscle, its shortening decreased from -3.5 +/- 0.3 to +0.6% LR (SE) (P less than 0.001). PA muscle denervation also caused the EI muscle in the third interspace to change from inspiratory shortening of -0.2% to inspiratory lengthening of +0.2% +/- 0.2 (P less than 0.05). We conclude that during eupneic breathing 1) the EI muscles of the upper rib cage, like the PA muscles, are inspiratory agonists and actively contribute to rib cage expansion and 2) PA muscle contraction contributes to EI muscle shortening.\r"

  ".W": "The rapid development of pulmonary edema that may occur in the rabbit after the intracisternal injection of a mixture of fibrinogen and thrombin has classically been considered to result from a vagally mediated increase in vascular permeability (G. R. Cameron and S. N. De, J. Pathol. Bacteriol 61: 375, 1949) and to not be dependent on hemodynamic mechanisms. We tested this hypothesis by evaluating the relationship between the degree of pulmonary hypertension and postmortem extravascular lung water content (EVLW) in both nonvagotomized (n = 10) and vagotomized (n = 7) rabbits administered thrombin (0.1 ml, 500 U/ml) and fibrinogen (1 ml, 27 mg/ml) intracisternally. No increase in EVLW was observed in either group unless pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) exceeded 25 Torr, and large increases in EVLW were only observed at higher Ppa's. These results thus indicate that some degree of pulmonary hypertension is required for the development of this form of edema. Because the vascular pressure required to produce edema in this model approaches that required to increase pulmonary vascular permeability in the rabbit, a pressure-dependent increase in permeability may be a common characteristic of neurogenic pulmonary edema in this species. Vagotomy had no protective effect but instead appeared to increase the amount of edema development for a given degree of pulmonary hypertension.\r"

Aggregation was induced at pressure by ADP and quantified turbidimetrically. The maximum degree of aggregation (MDA) was reduced from a control level of 82.2 to 53.6% by exposure to 101 ATA. Because decompression bubbles did not form, aggregation was also measured immediately after a compression cycle. After exposure to 101 ATA hydrostatic pressure, platelets responded normally to ADP at 1 ATA. In a matching apparatus, PRP was equilibrated with high partial pressures of inert gases. Normal physiological plasma Po2 and pH were maintained during equilibration. N2O (5 ATA) reduced the MDA from 86.5 (control) to 58.1%. N2 (51 ATA) reduced the MDA from 74.7 (control) to 51.6%, and 101 ATA Pn2 reduced the MDA from 78.0 (control) to 32.3%. He (100 ATA) reduced the MDA from 83.6 to 38.6%. It was concluded that platelet aggregation was relatively sensitive to hydrostatic pressure and less sensitive to inert gases than predicted from their anesthetic potency ratios.\r"

Muscle mass loss of approximately 30% was observed in soleus after 7 and 14 days of WBS. Measurement of slow- and fast-twitch fibers showed significant alterations. Reductions in cross-sectional areas and increases in fiber densities in soleus after spaceflight and WBS were related to previous findings of muscle atrophy during unloading. Capillary density also showed a marked increase with unloading. Seven days of weightlessness were sufficient to effect a 20 and 15% loss in absolute muscle mass in soleus and EDL, respectively. However, the antigravity soleus was more responsive in terms of cross-sectional area reductions. After 7 days of recovery from WBS, with normal ambulatory loading, the parameters studied showed a reversal to control levels. Muscle plasticity, in terms of fiber and capillary responses, indicated differences in responses in the two types of muscles and further amplified that antigravity posture muscles are highly susceptible to unloading. Studies of recovery from spaceflight for both muscle metabolism and microvascular modifications are further justified.\r"

With the rabbit in the left lateral decubitus position, the subpleural microcirculation was viewed either through a transparent parietal pleural window located in the superior part of the chest or directly with the chest open. There was no physical contact with the chest or lung. The rabbit was anesthetized, paralyzed, and mechanically ventilated with 100% O2. The dye was injected into the right ventricle during a 2-min apneic period to eliminate lung movement due to ventilation. The video signal of the passage of the dye was analyzed frame by frame by use of digital image processing to compensate for cardiogenic oscillations of the lung surface. Gray scale levels of an arteriole and adjacent venule were measured every 1/30 s. Capillary transit time was determined from the difference between the concentration-weighted mean time values of the arteriolar and venular dye dilution curves. We studied the effect of airway pressure (0-20 cmH2O) on transit time. Cardiac output was measured at different airway pressures by the thermal dilution technique. Capillary transit time averaged 0.60 s at functional residual capacity. Right ventricular-to-arteriolar transit time was four times as large as the capillary transit time. An increase in airway pressure from 0-5 to 20 cmH2O resulted in a fourfold increase in both capillary and arterial transit times and a threefold decrease in cardiac output.\r"

  ".W": "A new lung model that incorporates intra-acinar diffusion- and convection-dependent inhomogeneities (DCDI) and interregional and intraregional convection-dependent inhomogeneities (CDI) is described. The model is divided into two regions, each containing two subunits. Each of the four subunits in the model consists of a multi-branch-point structure, based on the anatomic data from Haefeli-Bleuer and Weibel (Anat. Record 220: 401-414, 1988). The subunit turnover (TO), i.e., the ratio of subunit tidal to resting volume, and the flow sequences (FS) between the subunits are used as model parameters. The model simulates the normalized alveolar slope (Sn), Fowler and Bohr dead space (VDF and VDB), and alveolar mixing efficiency (AME) as a function of breath number (n) during a multiple-breath N2 washout (MBNW). For the first breath of the MBNW, these indexes are poorly sensitive to the TO distribution or FS between the subunits. However, as the washout proceeds, the n dependence of both Sn and VDB becomes markedly distinct for simulations with different TO and FS. VDF increases only slightly with n during the MBNW for a large range of TO and FS combinations, and AME is independent of FS. Comparison of published experimental observations with model simulations gave a consistent picture of ventilation maldistribution in the human lung. MBNW simulations in conditions of weightlessness, which will be performed shortly in Spacelab, suggest that it will be possible to evaluate quantitatively the intraregional elastic inhomogeneities in the human lung.\r"

  ".W": "The injection of carbachol into the pontine tegmentum of decerebrate cats evokes a postural motor atonia that has many of the characteristics of the atonia of natural rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep (Morales et al. J. Neurophysiol. 57: 1118-1129, 1987). We have used the carbachol-injected decerebrate cat to study the changes in respiratory neuronal activity that accompany the atonia. The activities of representative respiratory motor nerves--phrenic, intercostal, and hypoglossal--and that of a motor branch of C4 were recorded in decerebrate, vagotomized, paralyzed, and artificially ventilated cats. After the microinjection of carbachol, there was a profound suppression of activity in all the nerves and a decrease in respiratory rate. This was a consistent stereotyped response in which the magnitude of the suppression of respiratory-related activity was phrenic (to approximately 65% of control) less than inspiratory intercostal (approximately 50%) less than hypoglossal (approximately 10%) less than expiratory intercostal (approximately 5%). The decrease in respiratory rate (to approximately 70% of control) was caused by a prolongation of both inspiratory and expiratory durations. Complete reversal of the carbachol effect was elicited by the microinjection of atropine into the same site as the carbachol injection. This allowed us to produce a second episode of atonia by the injection of carbachol into the contralateral pons. Thus we have demonstrated the existence of neural pathways originating in the cholinoceptive cells of the pons that have the potential to powerfully and differentially depress various respiratory motoneuronal pools and to reduce the respiratory rate. These pathways are likely to be activated along with the atonia of REM sleep.\r"

  ".W": "We compared the sensitivity of dynamic (Cdyn) and static lung compliance (CL) with indicators of permeability injury in a model of septic porcine adult respiratory distress syndrome. Two groups of anesthetized ventilated swine (15-25 kg) were studied. Septic animals (Ps, n = 13) received Pseudomonas aeruginosa intravenously for 1 h, which resulted in severe adult respiratory distress syndrome. Controls (C, n = 13) received 0.9% NaCl. Cdyn, CL, bronchoalveolar lavage for protein estimation, and thermal cardiogreen extravascular lung water (EVLW) measurements were performed in seven C and eight Ps animals. Six C and five Ps animals underwent gamma camera measurement of lung-to-heart ratio (slope index) of 99Tc-labeled human serum albumin. Both Cdyn and CL decreased significantly (P less than 0.01) at 30 min and thereafter in Ps vs. C. EVLW, slope index, and bronchoalveolar protein content increased significantly (P less than 0.05) in Ps vs. C at 120, 150, and 300 min, respectively. Cdyn and CL decreased well before onset of permeability injury. These early changes may be due to release of vasoactive mediators and sequestration of neutrophils in the pulmonary capillaries and later to increases in EVLW. Measurement of Cdyn and CL represents an early means of assessing evolving lung injury in this acute septic porcine model.\r"

  ".U": "91170086\r", 
  ".W": "The in situ lengths of muscle bundles of the crural and three regions of the costal diaphragm between origin and insertion were determined with a video roentgenographic technique in dogs. At total lung capacity (TLC) in both the prone and supine positions, the length of the diaphragm is not significantly different from the unstressed excised length, suggesting that the diaphragm is not under tension at TLC and that there is a hydrostatic gradient of pleural pressure on the diaphragmatic surface. Except for the ventral region of the costal diaphragm, which does not change length at lung volumes greater than 70% TLC, all other regions are stretched during passive deflations from TLC. Therefore below TLC the diaphragm is under passive tension and supports a transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi). The length of the diaphragm relative to its unstressed length is not uniform at functional residual capacity (FRC) and does not follow a strict vertical gradient that reverses when the animal is changed from the supine to the prone position. By inference, the length of muscle bundles is determined by factors other than the vertical gradient of Pdi. During mechanical ventilation, regional shortening is identical to the passive deflation length-volume relationship near FRC. Prone and supine FRC is the same, but the diaphragm is slightly shorter in the prone position. In both positions, during spontaneous ventilation there are no consistent differences in regional fractional shortening, despite regional differences in initial length relative to unstressed length.\r"

Surfactant metabolism also was studied using intravascular and intratracheal radiolabels. Protein permeability, gas exchange, and compliance were significantly abnormal as lung injury progressed. At peak injury, there was a decrease in the large aggregate Sat PC pool size in alveolar wash accompanied by increased uptake of Sat PC from the air space and increased specific activity of both intravascular and intratracheal radiolabels in lamellar bodies. This was followed by a marked rise in the small aggregate pool size in the alveolar wash and increased secretion of Sat PC into the air spaces. Phospholipid compositions, total phospholipid-to-protein ratios, and in vivo functional studies using a preterm ventilated rabbit model were abnormal for both large and small aggregate surfactant fractions from the lung-injured rabbits. These studies characterize quantitative, qualitative, and functional changes of alveolar wash surfactant subfractions in NNNMU-injured lungs.\r"

Using this technique, we raised pulmonary capillary pressure from a baseline of 13.2 +/- 2.2 to 35.3 +/- 5.1 mmHg. This increased lung lymph flow (from 8.8 +/- 2.7 to 53.1 +/- 13.9 ml/h). We estimated the pulmonary microvascular oncotic reflection coefficient and found it to be 0.82 +/- 0.05 (SD). The filtration coefficient was 0.019 +/- 0.005 ml.mmHg-1.min-1. During the period of increased pressure, the animals had stable arterial pressures and cardiac outputs. None of the animals developed blood coagulation problems. These data illustrate the usefulness of pulmonary venous occlusion to elevate pulmonary microvascular pressure to obtain plasma-to-lymph protein concentration ratios independent of flow, allowing for the calculation of the oncotic reflection coefficient.\r"

We did not confirm the previously reported increase in external torsion with increasing age. The relative internal tibial torsion we have demonstrated in patients with congenital talipes equinovarus must be differentiated from the posterior displacement of the distal fibula observed by others and which may result from manipulative treatment. The relative internal tibial torsion we found in the clinically normal legs of children with congenital talipes equinovarus is further evidence that in this condition the pathology is not confined to the clinically affected foot.\r"

Nine of the 11 patients had had an average of four surgical procedures before the FVFG, so the graft was a salvage procedure for which the only alternative was amputation. FVFG is recommended as a primary procedure for the treatment of congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia if there is a large tibial defect (over 3 cm) or shortening of more than 5 cm. The primary use of this operation is not advised for cases in which standard orthopaedic procedures are expected to succeed. For a small defect with a favourable prognosis (Boyd and Sage 1958), we recommend conventional bone grafting, intramedullary nailing and electrical stimulation.\r"

The posterior capsule was not a strong or, in itself, an important structure.

For osteoarthritis secondary to hip dysplasia, the Chiari pelvic osteotomy is an alternative procedure to early hip replacement. In contrast to intertrochanteric osteotomy, it has the advantage of facilitating the implantation of an acetabular prosthesis should arthroplasty become necessary at a later stage.\r"

Their contributions to resisting anterior subluxation in flexion and extension were found by repeated tests after sequential bundle transection. Changes of length in flexion and extension and in tibial rotation were measured. None of the fibres were isometric. The posterolateral bundle was stretched in extension and the anteromedial in flexion, which correlated with increased contributions to knee stability and the likelihood of partial ruptures in these positions. Tibial rotation had no significant effect. The fibre length changes suggested that the 'isometric point' aimed at by some ligament replacements lay anterior and superior to the femoral origin of the intermediate fibre bundle and towards the roof of the intercondylar notch.\r"

Amyloidosis presents with various musculoskeletal disorders only after several years of dialysis. We reviewed 83 patients who had been dialysed for at least 10 years. The commonest complaint was severe joint pain in the absence of radiological changes of arthritis (41%), the shoulders usually being the most affected (33%). Carpal tunnel syndrome had developed in 26 patients, and was bilateral in 14 of them; at operation the presence of amyloid was confirmed. Six of these patients had recurrent symptoms after a further two to three years and required another decompression. Other manifestations of amyloidosis included trigger finger, flexor tendon contracture, spontaneous tendon rupture and pathological fracture through amyloid bone cysts. The frequency of symptoms was proportional to the duration of dialysis: all 13 patients on dialysis for over 20 years were affected. Symptoms developed earlier in older patients.\r"

We have used partially demineralised rabbit tibiae to simulate atrophic changes and to determine whether weakness is due to atrophy or to residual screw holes. Partial demineralisation and a screw hole each reduced maximum bending moment. However, energy absorbing capacity was little affected by demineralisation, but was reduced to 50% by a single drill hole. Residual screw holes are a considerably more important cause of bone weakness after plate removal than is cortical atrophy.\r"

However, controversy exists regarding the length of dermotomy required for adequate decompression in the lower extremity. This study investigated the skin envelope as a potential contributing factor. Wide fascial releases were performed through limited 8 cm incisions in eight cases of post-traumatic lower extremity compartment syndrome. In nine of 29 compartments the pressure remained greater than 30 mmHg. Lengthening the skin incisions to an average of 16 cm decreased intracompartmental pressures significantly. This study documents the skin envelope as a contributing factor in acute compartment syndromes of the leg. The use of generous skin incisions is supported and the need for intra-operative compartment pressure measurements in the treatment of this condition is emphasised.\r"

Patients treated with external fixation had a good anatomical result, but their function was no better than that of the control group.

Fractures immobilised with the wrist in dorsiflexion showed the lowest incidence of redisplacement, especially of dorsal tilt, and had the best early functional results. Immobilisation of the wrist in palmar flexion has a detrimental effect on hand function; it is suggested that it is also one of the main causes for redisplacement of the fracture.

Binding of [125I]IGF-I to membranes obtained from untreated patients was specific and time and temperature dependent. Analysis of the binding data yielded two classes of binding sites, one of high affinity (Kd, 10(-11) mol/L) and one of lower affinity (Kd, 10(-9) mol/L). BPH membrane preparations were affinity-cross linked to labeled IGF-I, and then subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Analysis by autoradiography revealed one labeled protein with an apparent Mr = 300K under nonreducing conditions and two labeled protein with Mr = 270K and Mr = 130K under reducing conditions. Excess unlabeled IGF-II reduce both of them, whereas the same excess of IGF-I completely abolished them. In membrane preparations of prostatic tissues from patients affected by BPH and treated for 2 months with a GnRH agonist analog, the binding capacities of both binding sites were significantly higher than those of BPH tissue from untreated patients, whereas binding affinities were unchanged. The IGF-I receptor in BPH prostate tissue of untreated patients was mainly localized in the basal layer of the epithelium, as demonstrated by immunohistochemical staining, whereas in the tissue from treated patients positive staining was found also in the glandular epithelium. These results demonstrate that: 1) specific binding sites for IGF-I are present in prostatic tissue from patients with BPH, 2) androgen deprivation increases their binding capacities and seems to modify their epithelial localization.\r"

The ability of R 76713 to inhibit peripheral aromatization of androstenedione (A) to estrone (E1) in vivo was studied in male cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). Peripheral aromatization was measured using a primed constant infusion of [3H] A and [14C]E1 for 3.5 h. Blood samples, collected during the final hour of infusion, were analyzed for plasma radioactivity as infused and product steroids. MCRs, conversion ratios (CR), and percent conversion of A to E1 were calculated. R 76713 (0.03-10 microgram/kg) or vehicle (10% hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin) were administered iv 90 min before beginning the infusion of radiolabeled steroids. In vehicle-treated monkeys, the aromatization of A (mean +/- SEM, 1.35 +/- 0.11%) was similar to that previously reported for cynomolgus and rhesus monkeys, baboons, and humans. Aromatization of A, measured 4-5 h after injection of R 76713, was dose-dependently decreased from the control value by 87 +/- 3%, 85 +/- 2%, 61 +/- 5%, and 33 +/- 8% (all P less than 0.05) at doses of 10.0, 3.0, 0.3, and 0.03 micrograms/kg, respectively, with an ID50 of 0.13 microgram/kg, iv (95% confidence interval, 0.06-0.21). When measured 15-16 h after iv administration of 3.0 micrograms/kg R 76713, aromatization (0.55 +/- 0.13%) was significantly inhibited by 53 +/- 11% compared to that in control monkeys (1.16 +/- 0.18%). The CRs between androgens, the CRs between estrogens, and the MCRs of A and E1 were not significantly altered by R 76713 compared to those after vehicle treatment. R 76713 potently decreased peripheral conversion of androgen to estrogen in vivo in male cynomolgus monkeys and may be a useful therapeutic agent in treating estrogen-dependent diseases, including post-menopausal breast cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Human fetal adrenals are very active in steroid production. They make large amounts of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate which is further converted to estrogens in placenta. Fetal adrenals cannot make cortisol efficiently from cholesterol or pregnenolone, but they can convert progesterone to cortisol. To clarify the molecular basis of the very low activity of 3 beta-hydroxy-5-ene steroid dehydrogenase (3 beta HSD) in human fetal adrenals we studied the expression of 3 beta HSD gene in fetal adrenals in vivo and in culture conditions. Human adult adrenals, placenta and a testicular Leydig cell tumor clearly expressed 3 beta HSD gene when studied by Northern blotting, but fetal adrenals and ovaries had no detectable 3 beta HSD mRNA by this method. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of cDNA samples derived from different human tissues revealed 3 beta HSD gene expression in placenta, adult adrenal and adult ovarian granulosa cells after 25 cycles of amplification. Fetal adrenal samples became positive only after additional amplification cycles, which verifies the very low expression of 3 beta HSD gene in fetal adrenals. In cell culture conditions both ACTH and a protein kinase C regulator 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate induced 3 beta HSD gene expression. We conclude: 1) the very low activity of 3 beta HSD in human fetal adrenals is due to the low expression of this gene; 2) both cAMP and protein kinase C-dependent mechanisms regulate 3 beta HSD gene expression in adrenocortical cells.\r"

  ".W": "Adrenal response to iv administration of 1-24 ACTH (250 micrograms) was examined in normal volunteers under various conditions. The effect of basal cortisol levels was examined by performing the tests at 0800 h with and without pretreatment with dexamethasone. The effect of time of day was evaluated by performing the tests at 0800 h and at 1600 h, eliminating possible basal cortisol influence by pretreatment with dexamethasone. In the first set of tests, despite significantly different baseline levels, 30-min cortisol levels were not different (618 +/- 50 vs. 590 +/- 52 nmol/L). Afternoon cortisol levels in response to ACTH were found to be significantly higher than morning levels at 5 min (254 +/- 50 vs. 144 +/- 36 nmol/L, p less than 0.01) and at 15 min (541 +/- 61 vs. 433 +/- 52 nmol/L, p less than 0.02). This difference in response was no longer notable at 30 min (629 +/- 52 and 591 +/- 52 nmol/L). We tried also to determine the lowest ACTH dose which will elicit a maximal cortisol response. No difference was found in cortisol levels at 30 and 60 min in response to 250 and 5 micrograms 1-24 ACTH. Using 1 micrograms ACTH, the 30-min response did not differ from that to 250 micrograms (704 +/- 72 vs. 718 +/- 55 nmol/L, respectively). However, the 60-min response to 1 microgram was significantly lower (549 +/- 61 vs. 842 +/- 110 nmol/L, p less than 0.01). Using this low dose ACTH test (1 microgram, measuring 30-min cortisol level), we were able to develop a much more sensitive ACTH test, which enabled us to differentiate a subgroup of patients on long-term steroid treatment who responded normally to the regular 250 micrograms test, but had a reduced response to 1 microgram. The stability of 1-24 ACTH in saline solution, kept at 4 C, was checked. ACTH was found to be fully stable after 2 hs in a concentration of 5 micrograms/ml in glass tube and 0.5 micrograms/ml in plastic tube. It was also found to be fully stable, both immunologically and biologically, for 4 months, under these conditions. We conclude that the 30-min cortisol response to ACTH is constant, unrelated to basal cortisol level or time of day. It is therefore the best criterion for measuring adrenal response in the short ACTH test. The higher afternoon responses at 5 and 15 min suggest greater adrenal sensitivity in the afternoon, but further studies are needed to clarify this issue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) autocrine/paracrine system is believed to play a role in endometrial differentiation and trophoblast growth. The IGFs bind with high affinity to a family of binding proteins (IGFBPs) that regulate the actions of the IGFs at their target cells. IGFBP-1, one of three well-characterized IGFBPs in humans, has been shown by numerous investigators to be present in secretory but not proliferative endometrium; however, no information is available with regard to two other human IGFBPs, IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3, in normal human endometrium. We have examined expression of the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) encoding IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3 in human proliferative endometrium [under the influence of estradiol (E2)] compared to secretory endometrium (under the influence of E2 and progesterone). Using a complementary DNA probe specific for IGFBP-2, by Northern analysis, expression of a 1.4 kilobase mRNA was found to be differentially expressed in secretory compared to proliferative phase endometrium. Using a complementary DNA probe encoding IGFBP-3, a 2.4 kilobase mRNA was found in endometrium and was also found to be differentially expressed in secretory compared to proliferative phase endometrium. Endometrial stromal cells were established in culture and revealed constitutive synthesis and secretion of IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3 into the conditioned medium (CM), as detected by Western ligand blot analysis of the CM. Identification of the IGFBPs in the CM was made using IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3 specific antiserum. In the presence of E2 and progesterone, there was an enhancement in the amount of IGFBP-3 and a marked enhancement of IGFBP-2 in the conditioned media, suggesting sex steroid-dependence of IGFBP-2 and, to a lesser extent, IGFBP-3 protein synthesis. Western ligand blot analysis of IGFBPs in serum throughout the menstrual cycle revealed no hormonal dependence in the serum IGFBPs, suggesting local action of the IGFBPs in endometrium. These data thus show that mRNAs encoding IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3 are expressed in human endometrium, that their expression is differentially regulated in secretory compared to proliferative phase endometrium (different steroidogenic environments), and that the synthesis of both IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3 proteins is regulated by steroid hormones.\r"

Counterregulatory hormone concentrations were measured during a glucose clamp with graded reductions of plasma glucose from 5.2 to 2.6 mmol/L. In the study before surgery, the increase in plasma epinephrine concentration was markedly blunted (by greater than 90%) compared to that in the study after surgery. The peak plasma norepinephrine concentration was similarly reduced by 71%, and plasma cortisol by 63%. In addition, the glycemic thresholds for secretion of the counterregulatory hormones were lower before removal of the tumor. Peak plasma GH responses were equivalent before and after surgery, but the threshold for GH secretion was 21% lower in the first hypoglycemia study. We conclude 1) that there is evidence for abnormal glucose counterregulatory hormone secretion in this patient, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of hypoglycemia seen in patients with insulinoma; 2) the reversal of reduced counterregulatory hormone secretion after tumor resection suggests that these defective hormonal responses may be related to recurrent hypoglycemia, persistent hyperinsulinemia, or both; and 3) that abnormal glucose counterregulation may exist in the absence of type 1 diabetes.\r"

We examined 20 menstrual cycles ending in early loss of a conceptus in order to identify hormonal correlates of loss. Each loss cycle was compared to a successful conception cycle in the same woman, using daily concentration of urinary estrone-3-glucuronide and pregnanediol-3-glucuronide (PdG). The estrone-3-glucuronide and PdG profiles in cycles of early pregnancy loss were very similar to those in successful conception cycles until late in the luteal phase. Early pregnancy loss was not related to a midluteal deficiency in PdG. hCG tended to be detected later in cycles of early pregnancy loss than in successful conception cycles, presumably indicating later implantation. Ten of the early pregnancy losses implanted after luteal-day-10; only one of the successful pregnancies implanted that late. The corpus luteum responded to the conception in only 2 of the 10 loss cycles with late implantation. In contrast, the corpus luteum responded in 8 of 10 loss cycles with normally timed implantation. The similarity of preimplantation hormonal profiles in cycles of early pregnancy loss and in cycles with successful conceptions suggests that most early losses in reproductively normal women do not result directly from deficiencies in ovarian steroid production.\r"

  ".W": "Decreased glucose-induced thermogenesis has been observed in all forms of obesity. However, some studies implicate insulin resistance rather than obesity per se as the mechanism by which glucose-induced thermogenesis is reduced. To establish the role of insulin resistance in reduced thermogenesis independent of obesity, we compared energy expenditure in 9 nonobese individuals with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) to 16 nonobese control subjects using indirect calorimetry and the hyperinsulinemic clamp technique. To document the presence of insulin resistance and reduced glucose-induced thermogenesis in nonobese NIDDM, 6 individuals from each group were studied under identical conditions of hyperinsulinemia (120 mU/m2.min) and euglycemia (approximately 5 mmol/l). Both glucose uptake (0.482 +/- 0.042 vs. 0.737 +/- 0.040 g/min) and energy expenditure above basal (0.04 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.10 +/- 0.02 kcal/min) were decreased in nonobese NIDDM compared to control subjects (both P less than 0.05). To determine whether decreased glucose-induced thermogenesis could be overcome by correcting for reduced glucose uptake, the 9 nonobese NIDDM individuals were age and weight-matched to 9 control subjects and clamps were performed at matched rates of glucose uptake. During a 40 mU/m2.min insulin infusion, the nonobese NIDDM individuals were studied at hyperglycemia (17.5 +/- 1.9 mmol/L) and compared to the control subjects at euglycemia (5.1 +/- 0.1 mmol/L; P less than 0.05). Under these conditions, both groups achieved similar rates of glucose uptake (0.698 +/- 0.040 vs. 0.688 +/- 0.038 g/min, NIDDM and control subjects, respectively) and similar rates of energy expenditure above basal (0.08 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.06 +/- 0.02 kcal/min, P = NS). During 600 mU/m2.min clamps performed at hyperglycemia (19.0 +/- 1.2 vs. 14.5 +/- 1.1 mmol/L, NIDDM vs. control subjects, respectively; P less than 0.05), rates of maximal glucose uptake (1.538 +/- 0.093 vs. 1.518 +/- 0.047 g/min) and energy expenditure above basal (0.34 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.31 +/- 0.03 kcal/min) were also similar (P = NS). In conclusion nonobese NIDDM is associated with both decreased rates of glucose uptake and decreased glucose-induced thermogenesis. Decreased glucose substrate availability, due to impaired insulin action, appears to be the critical determinant of glucose-induced thermogenesis in nonobese NIDDM. These data indicate that decreased thermogenesis in NIDDM is a consequence of insulin resistance and can occur independent of obesity.\r"

Since bone mineral density is the net result of bone formation and bone resorption we studied biochemical indices of bone formation (serum osteocalcin) and resorption [fasting urinary calcium:creatinine (Ca/Crt) and hydroxyproline:creatinine (OH/Crt)] in adult female twins; 39 monozygotic (MZ) and 31 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs (age, mean +/- SEM, MZ: 51.1 +/- 1.5 yrs; DZ: 46.5 +/- 1.5 yrs, P = NS). Of these subjects, 18 MZ twin pairs and 10 DZ twin pairs were postmenopausal. The MZ twin pair correlations (rMZ) for each index of bone turnover exceeded that between DZ pairs (rDZ), but this difference was only significant for osteocalcin (rMZ = 0.81, rDZ = 0.21, P less than 0.001). Similarly, in the postmenopausal group examined alone, the rMZ (r = 0.84) for serum osteocalcin was significantly greater than rDZ (r = -0.003, P less than 0.03). These osteocalcin data imply that 80% of the variance in serum osteocalcin could be explained by genetic factors. Although genetic effects on fasting urinary hydroxyproline:creatine and calcium:creatinine were not demonstrable, these indices may be less precise and specific. The data indicate that circulating osteocalcin, and therefore bone formation, is strongly genetically determined. These studies suggest at least one of the mechanisms of the genetic effect on bone mass relates to the regulation of bone turnover.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the effect of chronic hyperglycemia on glucose transporters in erythrocytes of subjects with and without diabetes mellitus. We found a 22% increase in D-glucose-displaceable cytochalasin-B binding in erythrocyte membranes of diabetic subjects over those of controls (311 +/- 13 vs. 254 +/- 8 pmol/mg protein; P less than 0.001). This increased binding was due to a higher density of binding sites without a significant change in binding affinity. Cytochalasin-B binding to erythrocyte membrane correlated positively with both erythrocyte glycohemoglobin and serum glucose levels, but not with plasma C-peptide levels. The data are compatible with up-regulation of glucose transporters in the erythrocytes of subjects with chronic hyperglycemia. We suspect that this is brought about by increased synthesis and membrane incorporation of the glucose transporter during erythropoiesis.\r"

  ".W": "Simultaneous measurements of plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) melatonin and urinary excretion of 6-hydroxymelatonin were performed in four normal volunteers and one patient before and after upper thoracic sympathectomy for the control of essential hyperhidrosis. For normal individuals, hourly 24-h melatonin concentrations in plasma and CSF exhibited similar profiles, with low levels during the day and high levels at night. Peak plasma levels varied from 122-660 pmol/L, and the peak CSF levels from 94-355 pmol/L. The onset of the nocturnal increase in melatonin did not occur at the same time for each individual. Urinary 6-hydroxymelatonin levels also exhibited a daily rhythm, with peak excretion at night. The individual with the lowest nocturnal levels of circulating melatonin also had the lowest excretion of 6-hydroxymelatonin. In the patient with hyperhidrosis, a prominent melatonin rhythm was observed preoperatively in the CSF and plasma. After bilateral T1-T2 ganglionectomy, however, melatonin levels were markedly reduced, and the diurnal rhythm was abolished. These results provide direct evidence in humans for a diurnal melatonin rhythm in CSF and plasma as well as regulation of this rhythm by sympathetic innervation.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of human interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-2 on human granulosa-luteal cell progesterone production were examined with or without hCG stimulation in vitro. Human granulosa-luteal cells were recovered from follicular fluid obtained from women undergoing in vitro fertilization procedures and cultured for up to 7 days before supernatant progesterone level measurement. Lymphokine-rich conditioned medium was prepared from mitogen-stimulated human peripheral blood leukocytes (HPL-CM). The influence of HPL-CM on both granulosa-luteal cell progesterone production and cell growth was inhibitory. In contrast, supernatants of the IL-2-producing cell line MLA-144 (MLA-CM) stimulated both basal progesterone secretion and cell proliferation. Human recombinant IL-2 (from 0.1-100 IU) alone did not change progesterone levels, compared to control values, after 24 h of cell culture. However, 1, 10, and 100 IU IL-2 significantly inhibited progesterone secretion from cells stimulated by 5 IU hCG (P less than 0.01). The enhanced progesterone levels stimulated by forskolin were also significantly inhibited by 10 IU IL-2 (P = 0.01). This effect was not mediated through decreased cAMP, since the forskolin-enhanced cAMP level was not influenced by IL-2, IL-1, with or without hCG, did not show any effect on progesterone production during either 24 or 48 h of cell culture. It is concluded that 1) human recombinant IL-2 significantly inhibits progesterone production stimulated by hCG in human granulosa-luteal cells; 2) IL-2 also had a marked inhibitory effect on forskolin-induced progesterone release, but did not influence the increased cAMP level stimulated by forskolin; 3) the inhibitory influence of IL-2 on progesterone synthesis may be down-stream in the signal transduction pathway from cAMP activation; and 4) HPL-CM and MLA-CM produced inhibitory and stimulatory effects, respectively, on both basal and hCG-stimulated progesterone levels as well as on granulosa-luteal cell proliferation. These activities cannot be completely attributed to IL-2, and other mediators of leukocyte origin may, therefore, exist.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate whether insulin resistance contributes to the increased risk of diabetes in patients with Turner's syndrome, we measured insulin sensitivity (using the euglycemic insulin clamp technique, 40 mU/m2.min) and whole body glucose and lipid oxidation (assessed by indirect calorimetry) in two groups of nondiabetic patients with Turner's syndrome and age-matched normal controls. Group 1 consisted of eight young patients (mean age, 10 +/- 0.8 yr) who had never received hormone therapy, and group 2 consisted of five patients (mean age, 17.6 +/- 1.4 yr) who had been or were on estrogen therapy. In group 2, [3-3H]glucose was also infused during the euglycemic clamp to assess hepatic sensitivity to insulin. During the euglycemic clamp, insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism was decreased in both groups of patients [group 1, 8.4 +/- 1.0 vs. 14.7 +/- 2 mM/m2.min in controls (P less than 0.05); group 2, 9 +/- 0.7 vs. 11.7 +/- 0.9 mM/m2.min in controls (P less than 0.05)]. The impairment of insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism in patients with Turner's syndrome was accounted for by reduced nonoxidative glucose disposal; glucose oxidation rose to a similar extent in Turner patients and normal controls. Insulin-induced suppression of hepatic glucose production (group 2) and plasma FFA and branched chain amino acid levels in Turner patients was also indistinguishable from that in normal controls. Our data suggest that in patients with Turner's syndrome, insulin resistance is a very early metabolic defect that may be restricted to nonoxidative pathways of intracellular glucose metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "The current working hypothesis on the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease focuses on the interactions between susceptibility genes and environmental stimuli. In Graves' disease it is postulated that aberrant expression of HLA class II antigens on thyroid epithelial cells permits the presentation of specific thyroid antigen to activated lymphocytes. Evidence suggests that thyrocyte HLA-DR expression is secondary to the production of cytokines by presensitized T-lymphocytes. A 20-yr-old woman and her 18-yr-old brother presented with classical findings of Graves' disease with ophthalmopathy within a year of each other. Diagnosis was confirmed by demonstration of elevated serum levels of T4 and T3, strongly positive titers of TSH binding inhibitory immunoglobulins, and histological examination after subtotal thyroidectomy. Eight years previously, acute life-threatening aplastic anemia in the brother led to therapeutic transplantation of bone marrow from his sister. After the procedure, 100% of his peripheral leucocytes were genotype 46,XX. HLA typing performed before transplantation and 2 months after thyroidectomy in the female indicated complete identity with her brother's leukocytes for class I and class II antigens. Thyroid autoantibodies at this time were weakly positive. Although the concordance of thyroid disease in these patients could be due to chance, the patients were of different sexes, the family history was negative, and neither the probands nor the first degree relatives bore the HLA-DR3/B8 antigens. We propose that the male passively acquired a clone of programmed or activated lymphocytes from his sister and that his hyperthyroidism was not primarily dependent on exposure to specific thyroid-derived antigen.\r"
