  ".W": "We evaluated three cellular and five serologic markers that are affected by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) for their ability to predict the progression to clinical acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The cellular markers were the number of CD4+ T cells, the number of CD8+ T cells, and the ratio of CD4+ T cells to CD8+ T cells. The serologic markers were the serum levels of neopterin (a product of stimulated macrophages), beta 2-microglobulin, soluble interleukin-2 receptors, IgA, and HIV p24 antigen. We evaluated the usefulness of these measures as markers of the progression to AIDS prospectively, over four years, in a cohort of 395 HIV-seropositive homosexual men who were initially free of AIDS. CD4+ T cells (expressed as an absolute number, a percentage of lymphocytes, or a ratio of CD4+ to CD8+ T cells) were the best single predictor of the progression to AIDS, but the serum neopterin and beta 2-microglobulin levels each had nearly as much predictive power. The neopterin level appeared to be a slightly better predictor than the beta 2-microglobulin level. The levels of IgA, interleukin-2 receptors, and p24 antigen had less predictive value. A stepwise multivariate analysis indicated that the best predictors, in descending order, were CD4+ T cells (the percentage of lymphocytes or the CD4+: CD8+ ratio), the serum level of neopterin or beta 2-microglobulin, the level of IgA, that of interleukin-2 receptors, and that of p24 antigen. The last three markers had little additional predictive power beyond that of the first two. We conclude that of the eight markers studied, progression to AIDS was predicted most accurately by the level of CD4+ T cells in combination with the serum level of either neopterin or beta 2-microglobulin. At least one of these two serum markers, which reflect immune activation, should be used along with measurement of CD4+ T cells in disease-classification schemes and in the evaluation of responses to therapy.\r"

This raises the question of how the antigen-presenting cell provides a sufficient number of free MHC binding sites to ensure T cell immunity. We present results suggesting that an exchange of peptide in MHC binding sites may take place under physiological conditions.\r"

  ".W": "The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genome encodes the regulatory protein Rev, of relative molecular mass 13,000, which is synthesized from fully processed viral transcripts before synthesis of HIV-1 structural proteins. Rev has been postulated to exert control within the nucleus at the level of messenger RNA processing. The availability of Rev in the nucleus serves to increase the proportion of unspliced and singly spliced mRNA species relative to fully spliced mRNA molecules, resulting in an increased synthesis of viral structural proteins. A highly conserved cis-acting sequence termed the Rev-responsive element (RRE) has been identified in the envelope gene (env) of the viral transcript that seems to control mRNA processing in a Rev-dependent manner. Genetic studies have identified rev gene mutants with dominant phenotypes, supporting the hypothesis that Rev interacts directly with the RRE. Here we demonstrate that Rev protein, purified from Escherichia coli, binds in a sequence-specific manner to the RRE element in vitro.\r"

The other 2 patients have been monitored without biopsy or treatment. Three patients are alive and clinically stable, having been followed up for an average of 4 years; neuroimaging studies have shown no change in their tumors. The fourth patient died of a supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor. Imaging studies had shown no change in his brain stem lesion, which at autopsy was found to be a focal collection of fibrillary astrocytes. These data suggest that some patients with brain stem lesions and neurofibromatosis may have a prognosis distinctly different from that of the typical patient with a brain stem glioma. We recommend caution against aggressive operative and adjuvant therapy for brain stem lesions in patients with neurofibromatosis, unless progression of the lesion is documented clinically and/or by imaging.\r"

Further reductions in Medicare outlays relative to hospital costs are likely, given the looming federal deficit. We analyzed the relationship of individual neurosurgical volume, hospital costs, and outcome. All neurosurgical patients (n = 1002) treated for a 3-year period at our large academic medical center were grouped into those treated by low-volume neurosurgeons versus those treated by high-volume neurosurgeons (arbitrarily defined by us); 95% of patients admitted for neurosurgical procedures fit into one of these two categories. Patients of low-volume neurosurgeons had higher hospital costs (even after correction for DRG case-mix and severity of illness) (P less than 0.01), a much worse financial position under DRGs (P less than 0.01), but a similar outcome for both emergency and nonemergency admissions when compared to patients of higher volume neurosurgeons. Pearson correlation showed an inverse relationship between declining cost per patient and increasing neurosurgical volume for both nonemergency patients -0.340 (P less than 0.0001), and emergency patients, -0.321 (P less than 0.0001). These findings suggest that the volume of neurosurgical procedures performed by an individual neurosurgeon is related to hospital resource utilization. This study also suggests that the DRG prospective payment system could provide incentives that may affect both neurosurgical practice and the access to neurosurgical care.\r"

With intensive counseling her compliance improved and she was able to maintain good nutritional status with oral feeding. This case report illustrates the need for intensive nutritional support for patients with short bowel. Although initial survival depends on TPN, it should be followed by an aggressive attempt to use enteral feedings alone. The program should be individualized, and caregivers must be aware of the many potential complications, since early diagnosis and treatment of complications may be critical for survival.\r"

If the physician can do something to help this patient either by symptomatic or, more importantly, prophylactic treatment, he or she will have a most thankful patient. This type of headache is seen most frequently in men, and occurs in a cyclic manner. During an acute cycle, the patient will experience a daily type of pain that may occur many times per day. The pain is usually unilateral and may be accompanied by unilateral lacrimation, conjunctivitis, and clear rhinorrhea. Prednisone is the first treatment we employ. Patients are seen for follow-up approximately twice a week, and their medication is lowered in an appropriate manner, depending on their response to the treatment. Regulation of dosage has to be individualized, and when one reaches the lower dose such as 5 to 10 mg per day, the drug may have to be tapered more slowly, or even maintained at that level for a period of time to prevent further recurrence of symptoms. We frequently will use an intravenous histamine desensitization technique to prevent further attacks. We will give the patient an ergotamine preparation to use for symptomatic relief. As these patients often have headaches during the middle of the night, we will place the patient on a 2-mg ergotamine preparation to take prior to going to bed in the evening. This often works in a prophylactic nature, and prevents the nighttime occurrence of a headache. We believe that following these principles to make the accurate diagnosis and institute the proper therapy will help the practicing otolaryngologist recognize and treat patients suffering from this severe pain.\r"

Genomic expression vectors have been constructed containing the rearranged gene segments coding for the V region domains of the heavy (VH) and light (VL) chains of an anti-2,4,6-trinitrophenyl (TNP) antibody (SP6) spliced to either one of the C-region gene segments of the alpha or beta TcR chains. Following transfection into a cytotoxic T-cell hybridoma, expression of a functional TcR was detected. The chimeric TcR exhibited the idiotope of the Sp6 anti-TNP antibody and endowed the T cells with a non-MHC-restricted response to the hapten TNP. The transfectants specifically killed and produced interleukin 2 in response to TNP-bearing target cells across strain and species barriers. Moreover, such transfectants responded to immobilized TNP-protein conjugates, bypassing the need for cellular processing and presentation. In the particular system employed, both the TNP-binding site and the Sp6 idiotope reside almost exclusively in the VH chain region. Hence, introduction into T cells of TcR genes containing only the VHSp6 fused to either the C alpha or C beta was sufficient for the expression of a functional surface receptor. Apparently, the VHC alpha or VHC beta chimeric chains can pair with the endogenous beta or alpha chains of the recipient T cell to form a functional alpha beta heterodimeric receptor. Thus, this chimeric receptor provides the T cell with an antibody-like specificity and is able to effectively transmit the signal for T-cell activation and execution of its effector function.\r"

We have therefore constructed a \"humanized\" antibody by combining the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of the anti-Tac antibody with human framework and constant regions. The human framework regions were chosen to maximize homology with the anti-Tac antibody sequence. In addition, a computer model of murine anti-Tac was used to identify several amino acids which, while outside the CDRs, are likely to interact with the CDRs or antigen. These mouse amino acids were also retained in the humanized antibody. The humanized anti-Tac antibody has an affinity for p55 of 3 x 10(9) M-1, about 1/3 that of murine anti-Tac.\r"

Such transgenic mice express I-Ad exclusively on exocrine pancreas, without expression in thymus or by lymphocytes. No spontaneous development of autoimmune reactivity toward exocrine pancreas was found in transgene-expressing mice of an H-2b background even though such mice could produce in vitro allogeneic responses against I-Ad. When T cells from nontransgenic H-2b mice as well as transgenic H-2b mice were activated in vitro by I-Ad allogeneic stimulator cells and transferred to transgenic mice, an intense, destructive lymphocytic infiltrate specific for exocrine pancreas developed. These findings suggest that aberrant class II MHC expression alone may not trigger autoimmune reactions. Rather, the unresponsiveness to allogenic class II MHC may result from the inability of exocrine pancreas to initiate primary responses by T cells.\r"

CD4 and CD8 function by binding to class II and class I MHC molecules on the antigen-presenting cell (APC), thereby increasing the adhesion between the T cell and the APC. From antibody-blocking studies and from cocapping and comodulation experiments, CD4 and CD8 come into close physical contact with their appropriately restricted T-cell receptor (TCR) at the time of antigen recognition. By the use of affinity chromatography followed by two-dimensional diagonal gel electrophoresis, we have identified a Mr 43,000 disulfide-bonded heterodimer copurifying with CD4. This protein was identified as the TCR by its removal after preclearing with the anti-TCR antibody F23.1 and by its generation after protease digestion of the same peptides as the TCR from this clone. When CD4 and CD8 were similarly isolated from an unusual CD4+ CD8+ class II-restricted T-cell clone, the TCR was identified as associating with either accessory molecule in the absence of activation. Therefore, CD4 and CD8 do not distinguish between class I- and class II-restricted TCRs in their ability to form membrane complexes, indicating a need for both the TCR and its associated accessory molecule to recognize the same individual MHC molecule on the APC to optimize TCR triggering.\r"

A highly conserved epitope present on DR beta chains of DR4 and DR1 haplotypes was found in 83% of 149 patients with classical or definite RA but was found in only 46% of 100 control individuals (P less than 0.0001). Two Dw subtypes of DR4 (Dw4 and Dw14) were associated with disease susceptibility but two other subtypes (Dw10 and Dw13) were not. Sequence differences between these subtypes implicate those residues around the putative antigen binding site of the DR beta molecule in the pathogenesis of RA. These data provide a basis for understanding host susceptibility to RA at a molecular level.\r"

Recent findings by several groups strongly suggest a functional role for the gene product p56lck protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) in the activation of normal T cells. A single recessive gene, lpr or gld, induces a lymphoproliferative disorder concomitant with autoimmune disease in mice. In this study, a 10-fold elevated activity of PTK encoded by fyn, another src family gene, was demonstrated in CD4-CD8- T cells in mutant mice. The increased PTK activity was consistent with overexpression of fyn mRNA. The elevated fyn mRNA expression appeared to be a characteristic of CD4-CD8- T cells, since it was not observed in normal T cells at any stage of differentiation. The fact that fyn mRNA expression was markedly induced in normal T cells by mitogenic stimulation with anti-T3 epsilon antiserum supports the possibility that p59fyn PTK is a signal-generating molecule in T cells. Thus, our findings provide insight into the physiological role for a src gene family kinase in T-cell development and contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of disease-inducing recessive genes.\r"

It possesses some of the characteristics ascribed to a putative endogenous \"digitalis-like\" compound that has been implicated in the control of renal sodium excretion and the pathogenesis of essential hypertension in man. To determine whether this hypothalamic Na+/K(+)-transporting ATPase inhibitor might have physiologic properties in cardiac tissues, its effects on Na+ pump inhibition, accumulation of cytosolic free calcium, and contractile response were studied in cultured, spontaneously contracting neonatal rat cardiocytes. The hypothalamic factor potently inhibited the Na+ pump in these cells, increased myoplasmic free calcium in a dose-dependent manner, and reversibly enhanced myocyte contractility by up to 40%, comparable in degree to maximal positive inotropic effects caused by the cardiac glycoside ouabain. Comparative studies further indicate that cardiotoxic effects of ouabain in the myocytes may be more complex than simple progressive elevation of intracellular free calcium concentration because at a free calcium concentration in excess of that produced by a toxic dose of ouabain, no toxicity with the hypothalamic Na+/K(+)-transporting ATPase inhibitor occurred.\r"

  ".W": "The hyperimmunoglobulin E recurrent-infection (Job) syndrome (HIE) is a congenital disorder characterized by high serum IgE, chronic eczematoid dermatitis, and recurrent infections. We examined the effect of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) on excessive IgE production in HIE patients. Spontaneous in vitro production of IgE by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HIE patients was elevated compared to normal individuals and correlated with serum IgE. In 9 of 13 patients, IgE production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells was inhibited by 50% by IFN-gamma at 100-1000 units/ml, whereas inhibition by IFN-gamma at 10(4) units/ml ranged from 67 to 93% for these 9 patients. IFN-gamma also inhibited IgG1, IgG3, and IgG4 production by B lymphocytes without inhibiting IgG2 production. IFN-gamma was administered subcutaneously to 5 HIE patients. After 2 weeks of treatment with IFN-gamma (0.05 mg/m2) at three doses per week given on alternate days, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from all 5 HIE patients decreased spontaneous in vitro IgE production (27-62% decrease) with no change in IgG and IgM. One patient had a 58% decrease in serum IgE and another patient had a 50% decrease in serum IgE after the IFN-gamma was increased to 0.1 mg/m2 for three doses per week for a month. In both patients, serum IgE returned to pre-IFN-gamma-challenge levels 1-3 months after completion of treatment, and in vivo IFN-gamma did not affect serum IgG and IgM, although serum IgG4 decreased with changes in serum IgE. Our studies demonstrate that IFN-gamma can regulate production of IgE and some IgG subclasses in humans.\r"

Whereas RSV tumors require sustained oncogene expression, their growth is largely a balance between viral recruitment of tissues and host immune destruction of infected cells. We have therefore examined the tumorigenic potential of v-src in the absence of viral recruitment and viral antigen expression. v-src was introduced with high efficiency into chicken wing web tissues using replication-defective (rd) retroviral vectors. Clonal sarcomas were induced rapidly, and, furthermore, v-src potentiated metastatic progression in approximately 0.1%-1% of tumor clones with unexpectedly short latency. rd vectors proved effective not only in transducing v-src into tissues but also as insertional markers of tumor clonality. The rd vector present in most primary and metastatic tumors was a highly truncated form of RSV derived by viral transmission of spliced v-src mRNA; this vector should thus avoid viral recruitment and host anti-viral immune reaction through its complete lack of viral structural genes. Under such conditions v-src maintains strong carcinogenicity in vivo when restricted to clonal tumor growth and can confer rapid metastatic potential on a discrete subset of tumor clones.\r"

In retinal slices, bath-applied baclofen, a gamma-aminobutyrate type B (GABAB) receptor agonist, reduced a patch-clamp-recorded L-type calcium channel current in a population of bipolar cells with axon terminals that ramify along the midline of the inner plexiform layer. Lucifer yellow staining revealed that this current was found only in bipolar cells that retain axon terminals and their associated telodendria, suggesting that the current is generated at the terminal and also possibly modulated there. T-type calcium currents were found in all bipolar cells, including those without axon terminals, but were not modulated by baclofen. The baclofen-induced reduction of calcium current was enhanced by guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate and eliminated by guanosine 5'-[beta-thio]diphosphate added to the cytoplasm by the patch recording electrode, suggesting that the GABAB receptors act through a guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (G protein). Baclofen also reduced an excitatory synaptic input to a population of amacrine cells with processes that ramify along the midline of the inner plexiform layer--cells probably postsynaptic to the bipolar terminals. This suggests that GABAB receptors modulate not only the calcium current but also transmitter release by a pathway involving G proteins and L-type calcium channels.\r"

We report a D1-D2 interaction in homogenized tissue as revealed by ligand binding. D2 agonists lowered the binding of [3H]raclopride to D2 receptors in striatal and anterior pituitary tissues. Pretreating the tissue with the D1-selective antagonist SCH 23390 prevented the agonist-induced decrease in [3H]raclopride binding to D2 sites in the striatum but not in the anterior pituitary, which has no D1 receptors. Conversely, a dopamine-induced reduction in the binding of [3H]SCH 23390 to D1 receptors could be prevented by the D2-selective antagonist eticlopride. Receptor photolabeling experiments confirmed both these D1-D2 interactions. The blocking effect by SCH 23390 was similar to that produced by a nonhydrolyzable guanine nucleotide analogue, and SCH 23390 reduced the number of agonist-labeled D2 receptors in the high-affinity state. Thus, the D1-D2 link may be mediated by guanine nucleotide-binding protein components. The link may underlie D1-D2 interactions influencing behavior, since the link was missing in over half the postmortem striata from patients with schizophrenia and Huntington disease (both diseases that show some hyperdopamine signs) but was present in human control, Alzheimer, and Parkinson striata.\r"

However, K+ need not act to control synthesis directly but may act through an unidentified downstream effector. Using microinjection to vary the salt content of oocytes and concomitantly measuring [3H]leucine incorporation, we found that small changes in Mg2+ greatly affect translation rates. (Ca2+ had little influence.) By measuring intracellular ion activities, we found that oocyte cations existed in a buffer-like (ion-exchange) equilibrium in which K+ and Mg2+ are the preponderant monovalent and divalent cations. Hence, increasing cellular K+ activity might increase translation by causing Mg2+ activity to rise. If so, the increased translation rates produced by hormone treatment or K+ injection would be prevented by EDTA, a Mg2+ chelating agent. This prediction was tested and confirmed. We conclude that, when gonadotropin increases K+ activity, the cell's internal ion-exchange equilibrium is altered thereby increasing Mg2+ activity and this up-regulates translation.\r"

  ".W": "Hereditary 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-resistant rickets is a rare autosomal-recessive disease resulting from target-organ resistance to the action of the active hormonal form of vitamin D. Four affected children from three related families with the classical syndrome of hereditary 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-resistant rickets and the absence of detectable binding to the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in cultured fibroblasts or lymphoblasts were examined for genetic abnormalities in the VDR gene. Genomic DNA from Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblasts of eight family members was isolated and amplified by polymerase chain reaction techniques. Amplified fragments containing the eight structural exons encoding the VDR protein were sequenced. The DNA from all affected children exhibited a single C----A base substitution within exon 7 at nucleotide 970 that resulted in the conversion of the normal codon for tyrosine (TAC) into a premature termination codon (TAA) at amino acid 292. This mutation causes a truncation of the VDR protein thereby deleting a large portion of the steroid hormone binding domain (amino acids 292-424). Although the affected children were all homozygotic for the mutation, the four parents tested all exhibited both wild-type and mutant alleles, indicating a heterozygous state. The functional consequences of this mutation were confirmed after expression of the recreated mutant VDR cDNA in mammalian cells. Recreated mutant receptor exhibited no specific 1,25-[3H]dihydroxyvitamin D3 binding and failed to activate a cotransfected VDR promoter-reporter gene construct. Thus these findings identify an ochre mutation in a human steroid hormone receptor in patients with hereditary 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-resistant rickets.\r"

Murine IFN-gamma receptor cDNA was expressed in human HEp-2 cells, which do not bind murine IFN-gamma and are insensitive to its action. Transfectants displayed the same binding properties as mouse cells. The biological responsiveness of such transfectants to various biological effects of both human and murine IFN-gamma was investigated, including modulation of major histocompatibility complex class I and class II antigen expression, inhibition of cell growth, and antiviral activity. Like parental HEp-2 cells, these transfectants responded only to human, but not to murine, IFN-gamma. Inversely, mouse L929 cells transfected with human IFN-gamma receptor cDNA were insensitive to human IFN-gamma. These results confirm and extend previous findings, suggesting that species-specific cofactors are needed for IFN-gamma-mediated signal transduction.\r"

Here we show that in both human FS-4 and murine L929 cells, steady-state levels of IRF-1 mRNA were increased by treatment with tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin 1 (IL-1), poly(I).poly(C), or IFN-beta. IRF-1 mRNA induction was also demonstrated in cells treated with calcium ionophore A23187 or with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, but not with epidermal growth factor, dibutyryl-cAMP, or the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin. To determine whether stimulation of IRF-1 mRNA levels correlates with IFN-beta induction, we compared IRF-1 and IFN-beta mRNA levels in cells exposed to various stimuli. In L929 cells, treatment with poly(I).poly(C) under conditions that failed to induce significant levels of IFN-beta mRNA led to a very low induction of IRF-1 mRNA, but \"priming\" cells with IFN prior to the addition of poly(I).poly(C) greatly increased both IRF-1 and IFN-beta mRNAs. In FS-4 cells an increase in IFN-beta mRNA (examined by the polymerase chain reaction) was seen after treatment with TNF, IL-1, A23187, or poly(I).poly(C), but not with IFN-beta, epidermal growth factor, dibutyryl-cAMP, or forskolin. Thus, all treatments that increased steady-state levels of IFN-beta mRNA also enhanced IRF-1 mRNA levels. However, treatment with IFN-beta, which caused a marked stimulation in IRF-1 mRNA, failed to produce a detectable increase in IFN-beta mRNA. It appears that IRF-1 may be necessary but not sufficient for IFN-beta induction. The ability of TNF and IL-1 to increase both IRF-1 and IFN-beta mRNAs may be responsible for some similarities in the actions of TNF, IL-1, and the IFNs.\r"

These genera, here named Catopithecus and Proteopithecus, come from a new Fayum site, L-41, and resemble Oligopithecus from the Jebel Qatrani Formation (lower sequence) at quarry E. They are here placed with the latter in a subfamily, Oligopithecinae, that is ranked in the Propliopithecidae. The level of L-41 is separated from quarry E by at least one major unconformity and 47 m of section. Only a maxilla of Proteopithecus is known. Its molars and premolars resemble those of later Fayum Propliopithecus and Aegyptopithecus and do not resemble those of Apidium and Parapithecus, all of which come from the Jebel Qatrani Formation, upper sequence. The type specimen of Catopithecus confirms a lower dental formula of 2-1-2-3, as in Catarrhini. These species appear to be the oldest primates undoubtedly related to humans. Their dental anatomy points to a derivation of Anthropoidea from Eocene adapids.\r"

  ".W": "Sharks are living fossils that are indistinguishable morphologically from their Devonian ancestors of approximately equal to 400 million years ago. If parallel conservatism characterizes their biochemical evolution, characterization of their immunoglobulin chains could provide information regarding the primordial features of these essential defense molecules. Shark immunoglobulins are polydisperse like those of mammals, but these species lack homogeneous myeloma proteins. This heterogeneity has precluded direct determination of the sequence of elasmobranch light-chain proteins. We have sequenced four cDNA clones that contain the constant-region sequence as well as varying degrees of variable- or joining-region segments. The sandbar shark (Carcharhinus plumbeus) has at least four distinct light-chain constant regions, and these can be considered homologs of mammalian lambda chains. Approximately 40% identity was found in comparison from sharks to mammals. Certain stretches of sequence were remarkably conserved, whereas others varied in a manner consistent with accepted concepts of speciation. One hexapeptide (Ala-Thr-Leu-Val-Cys-Leu) occurred in lambda constant regions of all vertebrate species. There was a universal conservation of certain cysteines, phenylalanines, tryptophans, and glycines and strong identities in the block of residues from Ser-176 to Trp-186. Comparison of the shark sequence with that of the characterized human lambda myeloma protein Mcg indicates a strong conservation of three-dimensional structure in this light-chain domain representing species whose ancestors diverged early in vertebrate evolution. The shark light-chain sequence contains primordial features shared by mammalian kappa and lambda chains and by T-cell receptor beta chains.\r"

This extensive sequence polymorphism either may have been generated during the lifetime of the human species or could have arisen before speciation and been maintained in the contemporary human population by selection or, possibly, by genetic drift. These two hypotheses were examined using the polymerase chain reaction method to amplify polymorphic sequences from the DQ alpha locus, as well as the DX alpha locus, an homologous but nonexpressed locus, in a series of primates that diverged at known times. In general, the amino acid sequence of a specific human DQ alpha allelic type is more closely related to its chimpanzee or gorilla counterpart than to other human DQ alpha alleles. Phylogenetic analysis of the silent nucleotide position changes shows that the similarity of allelic types between species is due to common ancestry rather than convergent evolution. Thus, most of the polymorphism at the DQ alpha locus in the human species was already present at least 5 million years ago in the ancestral species that gave rise to the chimpanzee, gorilla, and human lineages. However, one of the DQ alpha alleles may have arisen after speciation by recombination between two ancestral alleles.\r"

The early symptoms are attributable to polycythaemia--headache, dizziness, loss of memory and fatigue being prominent. In the later stages of the disease, dyspnoea and peripheral oedema develop. Haemodynamic investigations show pulmonary hypertension with a normal cardiac output and dilatation of the right ventricle in the long-established case. Respiratory gas studies provide evidence of alveolar underventilation and ventilation: perfusion inhomogeneity. Both clinical and investigatory data suggest that the earlier stages of the disease are dominated by polycythaemia, while cardiopulmonary involvement increases with the duration of the disease. The disease is rare in women and uncommon in Tibetans. Cigarette smoking appears to be a contributory factor.\r"

  ".W": "Intraarterial 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) chemotherapy in eight patients, one with primary and seven with secondary liver tumors, was monitored by means of in vivo fluorine-19 magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy. F-19 MR spectra were obtained with surface coils and included signal contributions from both liver and tumor tissue. The time course of the relative concentrations of 5-FU and its major catabolite, alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine (FBAL), was followed for up to 100 minutes after the start of drug administration. The time constants for the kinetics of 5-FU ranged from 8 to 75 minutes, whereas the time constants for FBAL were either approximately 15 or 50 minutes. A broad peak comprising nucleoside and nucleotide anabolites of 5-FU was detected in one patient. These investigations demonstrate the feasibility of short-term therapy monitoring with F-19 MR spectroscopy and that catabolites and anabolites of 5-FU can be observed separately. However, since no F-19 MR spectroscopy localization sequence is available at present, the contributions to the total MR signal from normal liver and tumor tissue cannot be discriminated.\r"

Among the 1,179 patients without node involvement, 215 underwent limited surgery (complete excision and axillary node dissection) and radiation therapy; 964 patients underwent modified radical mastectomy only. Of the 961 patients with node involvement, 106 were treated by means of limited surgery and radiation therapy; of these, 48 also received chemotherapy. The remaining 855 patients underwent mastectomy; of these, 381 also received chemotherapy and/or hormone therapy. The 5-year survival rates for patients with no node involvement were 96% for the group treated by means of limited surgery and radiation therapy and 88% for the group treated by means of mastectomy (P greater than .05). The 5-year survival rates for patients with node involvement were 96% for the group treated by means of limited surgery and radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy and 77% for the group treated by means of mastectomy with or without chemotherapy (P less than .01). This study demonstrates no disadvantage from treatment by means of limited surgery and radiation therapy and suggests that adjuvant radiation therapy may be important in increasing survival among patients with T1-2 breast carcinoma and positive axillary nodes.\r"

Their spectrum of activity includes serious pediatric pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The potential uses of fluoroquinolones in pediatric diseases include acute and chronic pulmonary infections in children with cystic fibrosis, methicillin-resistant staphylococcal infections, meningitis with resistant bacteria, and prophylaxis in leukemic and immunocompromised children. The toxicity of some quinolone derivatives that involve developing cartilage in sensitive animal species has to be studied further. Clinical trials of fluoroquinolones from Europe and the United States in children show no cartilage or joint toxicity. For the time being and until more clinical experience with fluoroquinolones in children is obtained, their use should be limited to specific cases of therapeutic failure or multiple resistance to other antibiotics.\r"

The most common clinical findings were acute onset of symptoms, fever (greater than or equal to 38 degrees C), thirst, headache, nausea, back pain, vomiting, myalgia, and abdominal pain. Twenty-seven patients (37%) had hemorrhagic manifestations, i.e., epistaxis, melena, hematemesis, petechial bleeding, macroscopic hematuria, or metrorrhagia. Disseminated intravascular coagulation developed in four patients. Fifty-one percent had thrombocytopenia. Proteinuria was recorded for all patients, while hematuria and glucosuria were noted for 85% and 58%, respectively. Serum creatinine levels were elevated in 71 (96%) of the patients. Levels of C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rates were elevated in all cases, usually to levels found in serious bacterial diseases. Sixty-six (89%) of the patients were followed for up to 7 months, at which time all had recovered clinically. No patient died or required dialysis. We conclude that nephropathia epidemica in Sweden has a clinical picture similar to that of hemorrhagic fevers in other parts of the world, but with a milder course and a better prognosis.\r"

All agents were capable of preventing infections. However, the use of TMP-SMZ alone led to an increase in the number of infections caused by multiresistant microorganisms. The combination of TMP-SMZ plus colistin was superior to that of neomycin plus colistin. The new quinolone derivative ciprofloxacin was more effective than TMP-SMZ and was well tolerated. Antimicrobial prophylaxis with agents that provide adequate levels of drug in tissue prevents infections in granulocytopenic patients and is superior to that with nonabsorbable agents.\r"

Because infections arise from both the endogenous microbial flora and newly acquired organisms and because the pathogens include bacteria, fungi, viruses, and/or parasites and affect a number of different body sites, it has been difficult to conceive of a single or simple method of controlling these multiple infectious etiologies. The suppression or elimination of the host's own microbial flora by the use of various prophylactic antibiotics and the reduction in the patient's acquisition of new organisms by the use of isolation techniques have received the greatest attention. While a number of these approaches (including total protected isolation, nonabsorbable antibiotics, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, selective decontamination, and most recently the quinolones) have appeared to reduce the incidence of infections, few have stood the test of time. The advantages and disadvantages of each of these methods are reviewed, and newer promising areas for current and future investigation are considered.\r"

Inspection of the sequences of the gonadotropic hormones revealed a homologous tetrapeptide (Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys) between the beta subunit of lutropin (LH) and the active site of thioredoxin (TD). The beta subunit of follitropin (FSH) has a similar sequence (Cys-Gly-Lys-Cys). Thioredoxin is a ubiquitous protein serving as an electron donor for ribonucleotide reductase, but it also exhibits disulfide isomerase activity. The catalytic activity of TD was assayed by its ability to reactivate reduced and denatured ribonuclease. In this assay, the purified ovine FSH and bovine LH preparations tested were approximately 60 and approximately 300 times, respectively, as active as TD on a molar basis. This heretofore unsuspected catalytic property of FSH and LH may be important in understanding their mechanism of receptor activation and signal transduction.\r"

Irreversible changes in gene expression occurred in senescent human fetal lung fibroblasts: a non-cell cycle-regulated mRNA was partially repressed; an unusual polyadenylated histone mRNA was expressed; although serum induced c-H-ras, c-myc, and ornithine decarboxylase mRNA normally, ornithine decarboxylase activity was deficient; and serum did not induce mRNA for a replication-dependent histone and for the c-fos proto-oncogene. The loss of c-fos inducibility was the result of a specific, transcriptional block. The results suggest that senescent fibroblasts were unable to proliferate because of, at least in part, selective repression of c-fos; moreover, the multiple changes in gene expression support the view that cellular senescence is a process of terminal differentiation.\r"

Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament was found in 26.15% of the parents of the probands and 28.89% of the siblings of the probands. These prevalences were significantly higher than in the general population. The segregation rate in the siblings corresponded neither with the hypothesis of autosomal dominant inheritance nor with that of autosomal recessive inheritance. The possibility of polygene inheritance was also ruled out, considering the risk of recurrence in the siblings of the probands. However, owing to the segregation rate in the siblings exceeding 0.25 and the high prevalence of OPLL in the parents, OPLL was suggested to be a disorder possibly controlled by autosomal dominant inheritance.\r"

Therefore, a randomized, double-blind controlled study was designed to test the hypothesis that daily administration of cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK-OP) prevents the formation of biliary sludge in humans receiving long term TPN. Adult patients receiving TPN for more than 21 consecutive days were studied. After randomization of 15 patients, the study was concluded because statistical significance was achieved. Eight patients received saline solution (placebo) intravenously and seven received CCK-OP (50 nanograms per kilogram) intravenously over a ten minute period daily. The groups were similar with respect to age, sex, diagnosis, liver function tests, amylase levels, total TPN time and time of study. All of the patients underwent weekly ultrasound studies. Volume and emptying studies of the gallbladder in response to the study drug were performed after one week. None of the patients receiving CCK-OP had sludge whereas five of eight of the patients receiving placebo had sludge (p less than 0.02). The results of emptying studies showed significant contraction of the gallbladder in those in the CCK-OP group but not in the placebo group. These data suggest that CCK-OP given intravenously daily prevents TPN induced stasis and sludge of the gallbladder. We conclude that CCK-OP should be used as routine prophylaxis against biliary sludge and formation of gallstones in patients receiving long term TPN.\r"

The finding was shown best in the right upper quadrant with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position. The echoes caused by the pneumoperitoneum overlapped the echoes of the lung during inspiration, but the echoes were separate during expiration. The probable cause of pneumoperitoneum was determined with sonography in four of the five patients: three had perforation of duodenal ulcer and one had perforation of gastric cancer. The fifth patient had a perforated ileum, which was not evident on the sonogram. Our experience with these patients suggests that the detection of pneumoperitoneum on sonography in patients with an acute abdomen is an important sign of a perforated viscus.\r"

  ".W": "The self-retaining intraurethral coil is a device to stent the urethra in men who have severe urethral obstruction. It allows them to empty their bladders and still remain continent and sexually active. The device can be used in place of long-term indwelling catheters or as an alternative to surgery. During 1 year, we inserted the stent in 26 men who were poor operative risks. The treatment was successful in 20 (77%). All 20 were able to void satisfactorily. Four of the 20 resumed sexual activity, which previously had been prevented by indwelling catheters. Two patients who had delayed prostatic surgery because of fear of impotence were able to empty their bladders properly and to remain sexually active. Three patients subsequently had surgery, two after anticoagulant therapy could be stopped and one after renal function improved. No difficulties caused by the stent were encountered during surgery. Follow-up was for 2-12 months. Four patients who had had the stent in place for 12 months had no difficulties. In 16 of the 18 patients who had indwelling catheters and infected urine before insertion of the stent, sterilization of the urine was obtained after relatively short courses of antibiotic treatment. Short-term complications associated with the stent were incontinence or urinary retention. These were treated by repositioning the stent. Frequency of urination after insertion of the stent either disappeared spontaneously or was treated with anticholinergic drugs. In six patients, frequency was so severe that removal of the stent and insertion of an indwelling catheter were necessary. Slight to mild dysuria occurred immediately after surgery in all patients but eventually disappeared. Our experience suggests that the self-retaining intraurethral stent has considerable promise for the treatment of prostatic obstruction of the urethra.\r"

  ".U": "90102234\r", 
  ".W": "A posterior intercostal approach is commonly used for percutaneous access to the upper poles of the kidney. However, the safety of this approach with respect to puncturing the intervening lung, pleura, liver, and spleen with the needle has been inferred only from a small series of patients without regard to the degree of respiration. To determine the possibility of puncturing these structures, we performed CT at both maximal inspiration and expiration and with sagittal reconstructions in 43 (27 supine and 16 prone) randomly selected patients. With expiration, the needle path was such that there was little risk to the spleen and liver from an 11th-12th posterior intercostal approach. However, the chance of transgressing the lung with this approach to the kidney was 29% on the right and 14% on the left. If done during maximal inspiration, the lung would be in the path of the needle in most patients. With a 10th-11th rib posterior intercostal approach, the chance of puncturing the lung was excessive regardless of the degree of respiration used. Our results show that the primary risk from a posterior 11th-12th rib intercostal approach to the upper renal collecting system is puncture of intervening lung, a complication that can be expected to occur in from 14% to 29% of patients. The risks from a posterior 10th-11th rib intercostal approach appear prohibitive.\r"

Eighty-one patients were referred by orthopedic specialists because of a clinical suspicion of rotator cuff tear. The standards of comparison were arthrography in 79 cases and surgery in two cases. The sonographic technique used was based on a review of the literature and experience gained by scanning normal subjects. The sonographic criteria for the diagnosis of a complete rotator cuff tear were a focal defect in the cuff or complete absence or nonvisualization of the cuff. All sonograms were interpreted prospectively without knowledge of arthrographic or surgical results. With arthrography as the standard of comparison for the diagnosis of rotator cuff tear, sonographic results included 15 true-positives, 52 true-negatives, eight false-negatives, and four false-positives. With surgery as the standard of comparison, the results were one true-positive and one true-negative sonogram. The sensitivity of sonography in detecting rotator cuff tear was 0.67, the specificity was 0.93, and the accuracy was 0.85. Our study found lower sensitivity and accuracy results for shoulder sonography than have been previously reported.\r"

  ".U": "90102237\r", 
  ".W": "The success of the Ilizarov distraction technique has resulted in a marked increase in the number of limb-lengthening and limb-straightening procedures performed for the correction of short and deformed limbs. This technique involves fracture of the bone and application of an external ring and bar support frame with circumferential screw threads and nuts, which allows systematic distraction of bone segments at a rate of 0.25 mm four times a day. During the procedure, the patient is encouraged to be ambulatory, as the strength of the frame allows weight bearing. Because of the limitations of plain radiographs in detecting the small amounts of new bone formation that occur at the distraction site in the early stages of healing, the success of the procedure cannot be determined for many weeks. The rate of distraction depends on the successful production of new bone in the distraction site. Early evaluation of new bone production is therefore important, because slow bone formation requires a decrease in distraction rate and vice versa. We examined 12 patients who had limb-lengthening procedures via the Ilizarov technique to determine if sonography could be used to detect early new bone formation at the distraction site. Our results show that new bone formation could be detected with sonography many weeks before its appearance on the radiograph. The sonographic appearance of new bone consists of echogenic foci within the distraction site, which become aligned in the longitudinal plane and which increase in number and size until they coalesce as echodense bone, which does not allow through-transmission of the ultrasound beam. In addition, sonograms showed 1.5-cm and 2-cm cysts within the distraction site in two patients in whom they were not visible on the radiographs. Timely percutaneous aspiration allowed continued normal bone generation. We conclude that sonography is useful for the detection of new bone formation at the distraction site in patients undergoing the Ilizarov procedure.\r"

Joints drained included the hip in two cases and one case each of a hip joint prosthesis, an ankle joint, and a glenohumeral joint. Organisms isolated from the joints included Staphylococcus aureus in one hip joint and the hip prosthesis, and Haemophilus influenzae in the ankle joint. Specific organisms were not isolated in the other hip joint or in the shoulder joint. Systemic antibiotic therapy was used in all five patients, and in two patients gentamicin was instilled through the catheters. Joint infection was managed successfully with catheter drainage and antibiotics in three patients. In all three cases, the range of motion was restored and the patients became free of pain after catheter drainage. These three patients remained asymptomatic at follow-up ranging from 3 weeks to 9 months. In two patients, percutaneous drainage failed. In one patient, the catheter positions could not be maintained and the catheters repeatedly became dislodged. In the other, superimposed osteomyelitis necessitated surgical debridement. No complications occurred. Our experience suggests that suppurative arthritis can be successfully treated with drainage of the joint via a percutaneous catheter in combination with antibiotic therapy.\r"

Of the eight lesions in children less than 13 years old, five were complex lesions and three were cystic. Mural nodules were found in three (38%) of eight lesions and acoustic shadowing in one (13%). Of the 10 lesions in the patients 13 years old or more, seven were complex and three were solid. Seven (70%) of 10 lesions contained a mural nodule, seven (70%) had acoustic shadowing, and one (10%) had a fluid/fluid level.

All but one case were diagnosed prospectively with sonography. Facial abnormalities were present in 24 of 27 cases and were detected in 14 (58%) of 24 fetuses on prenatal sonography. Prenatal abnormalities detected by sonography included cyclopia (four of five), ethmocephaly (two of three), cebocephaly (one of three), midline cleft lip (four of eight), lateral cleft lip (two of two), and mild hypotelorism (one of three). One or more extrafacial anomalies were present in 14 (52%) of 27 fetuses. Other major structural anomalies detected prenatally by sonography included meningomyelocele (two of two), renal dysplasia (five of six), omphalocele (three of four), esophageal atresia (zero of three), and cardiac defects (one of seven). Chromosomal analysis revealed abnormal karyotype in 13 (50%) of the 26 fetuses in which it was performed; the most common abnormality was trisomy 13 (seven cases). The perinatal mortality rate was 89% (24 of 27); three neonates with holoprosencephaly were alive when discharged from the hospital. It is concluded that when a major cystic abnormality of the fetal brain is detected, prenatal sonographic analysis of midline facial defect may allow more definitive diagnosis of alobar or semilobar holoprosencephaly; affected fetuses often have other major structural abnormalities, and the outcome is nearly always fatal.\r"

Surgical findings and pathologic correlations were used as an objective measure of accuracy. Gadolinium-DTPA increased the confidence of diagnosis at one of eight operated cervical levels (six patients) and changed the diagnosis from extradural degenerative disease to tumor in one patient. The mechanism of enhancement of the epidural space and peridiskal region appears to be related to accumulation of contrast material within the epidural venous plexus, as well as to epidural fibrosis associated with disk disruption and herniation. While the immediate clinical utility of gadolinium-DTPA for morphologic analysis seems limited to difficult cervical spine cases, the presence of enhancement as a marker of epidural fibrosis and attempted healing may prove to be of great importance in studying the natural history and basic pathophysiology of degenerative disk disease.\r"

Since growth of granulation tissue into anular tears has been described as part of the healing process, it seemed likely that gadolinium-DTPA should enhance anular tears as it does scar tissue in other parts of the spine. We retrospectively reviewed spinal MR images from 30 previously unoperated patients and correlated areas of increased signal intensity within the anulus on T2-weighted images with areas of enhancement on T1-weighted images, and to a limited extent, with surgical findings. Eighteen separate areas of anular enhancement were found in 12 patients (six cervical, 12 lumbar). Only five of these enhancing areas showed increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images, four of a type II tear pattern and one of a type III tear pattern. Contrast enhancement within the anulus was in a pattern of type II tear in 14 and type III in four. Histology from an enhancing type II anulus demonstrated vascularized granulation tissue within the avascular anulus, without focal herniation. Anular tears may be imaged in vivo not only with T2-weighted images but also with gadolinium-DTPA-enhanced T1-weighted images by virtue of their vascularized granulation tissue.\r"

CT usually reveals cystic lesions adjacent to a facet joint, and they may show calcification. MR imaging of four surgically confirmed cases of intraspinal synovial cysts revealed subtle signal changes compared with CSF. Short TR/TE images showed the lesions to be slightly hyperintense in three cases and isointense in one case. Long TR/TE sequences revealed a hyperintense appearance in two cases and a hypointense appearance in the others. A peripheral rim of decreased signal on long TR/TE images probably reflects fine calcification or hemorrhage in the margins of the cysts. The multiplanar and contrast characteristics of MR make this technique well suited to the diagnosis of herniated disk, degenerative facet disease, and synovial cyst.\r"

To evaluate further the merits of percutaneous angioplasty of these vessels, we retrospectively analyzed the results of 57 procedures in 53 patients. Seventy-six infrapopliteal arteries were dilated: 26 anterior tibial arteries, 10 posterior tibial arteries, 18 peroneal arteries, and 22 tibioperoneal trunks. Thirty-three (62%) of the patients had concomitant angioplasties of the femoropopliteal arteries or vein grafts. There were three major complications (one death due to cardiac arrest 5 hr after the procedure and two puncture-site hematomas requiring surgery). Twenty minor complications did not affect clinical course. In the first 14 procedures (25%), tapered catheters were used, and technical success occurred in only four (29%). In the succeeding 43 procedures (75%), Gruentzig balloon catheters and low-profile balloons were used, and technical success occurred in 37 procedures (86%). Prompt clinical improvement was seen in 32 (80%) of 40 technically successful procedures. Prompt clinical improvement occurred in 28 (97%) of 29 procedures in which angioplasty restored straight-line flow to the foot (i.e., nonobstructed blood flow in at least one calf vessel that is narrowed by no more than 75% of its diameter). When such flow was not restored, clinical improvement occurred in only four (36%) of 11 cases (p less than .001). These results show that with current technology, infrapopliteal artery angioplasty is an effective and safe procedure. The greatest benefit is achieved when straight-line blood flow to the foot is restored.\r"

T1-weighted (600/25 [TR/TE]), intermediate (2000/30), and T2-weighted (2000/100) spin-echo series and a gradient-recalled acquisition in the steady state (GRASS) series were compared. Using venography as the standard for diagnosis, we found GRASS to be the most sensitive of the MR techniques, showing thrombi in all patients. It provided good contrast between the low-intensity thrombus and high-intensity flowing blood and also between thrombus and intermediate- or high-intensity perivascular tissues. The T1-weighted series was the least sensitive technique. All thrombi showed heterogeneity in the transaxial image with differences in signal between the peripheral and central regions. A higher intensity signal in the center than in the periphery at some level of the thrombus was found in six of seven T2-weighted or GRASS images. Heterogeneity in the signal intensity was more frequent in distal portions of thrombi, whereas the most proximal extent was homogeneous in appearance in six of seven cases. The heterogeneous appearance may be related to the greater age of the distal thrombus, because deep venous thrombi are known to begin in the calf and extend proximally over time. We conclude, on the basis of our experience with a small number of patients, that the GRASS MR technique is more sensitive for detecting acute deep venous thrombosis than T1-weighted, intermediate, and T2-weighted MR images.\r"

  ".W": "It is often necessary to estimate the dose of radiation to a fetus from a series of CT scans. To assist in making this process easier and more accurate, we measured fetal doses in an adult anthropomorphic phantom for four CT scanners: Picker 1200, Siemens DRH, GE 9800, and GE 8800. Measurements were made at four kilovoltages (100, 120, 130, and 140 kVp), for 2-, 5-, 8-, and 10-mm thicknesses, for two scanning angles (360 degrees and 398 degrees) and for two patient orientations (prone and supine). The fetal-dose estimates are based on the CT dose index measured by using a pencil ionization chamber at the center position of a 16-cm-diameter cylindrical phantom. Comparison with data from other investigators shows reasonable agreement when phantom differences, X-ray tube output, and equipment calibration are considered.\r"

  ".W": "Insertion of an endotracheal tube into the esophagus is an infrequent but life-threatening complication of endotracheal intubation. This complication is difficult to detect on standard, anteroposterior, portable chest radiographs because the incorrectly placed endotracheal tube is usually projected over the tracheal air column. To evaluate the use of chest radiographs to detect the malposition, we performed a two-part study. First, we analyzed the findings on chest radiographs in six patients in whom an endotracheal tube had been inserted in the esophagus, and then we analyzed 328 portable chest radiographs of patients with both endotracheal and nasogastric tubes to determine the best radiographic position for identifying the exact location of an endotracheal tube. The findings in the six patients included projection of the tube lateral to the trachea (five patients), gastric distension (four patients), esophageal air (two patients), and deviation of the trachea by the balloon cuff (one patient). The study of the portable chest radiographs showed that the endotracheal tube position could be identified correctly in 81 (92%) of 88 of the films made with the patient in a 25 degrees right posterior oblique position. The trachea and esophagus were superimposed in 25 (96%) of 26 of the radiographs made with the head turned to the left and with the patient in a 25 degrees left posterior oblique projection. Our results show that by positioning patients for chest radiographs in a 25 degrees right posterior oblique position, the location of endotracheal tubes can be identified accurately.\r"

CT showed parenchymal calcifications in the spleen (seven patients), liver (six patients), kidneys (six patients), abdominal lymph nodes (three patients), adrenal glands (two patients), and mediastinal lymph nodes (one patient). Multiple punctate calcifications in the liver, spleen, kidneys, and/or adrenal glands were visible on plain films in three patients. Sonography showed diffuse tiny echogenic foci without shadowing in the liver, spleen, and kidneys. In one patient, CT showed multiple hypodense lesions in the spleen. P. carinii infection should be included in the differential diagnosis when calcifications or focal lesions are detected at one or more extrapulmonary sites in an immunodeficient patient, even if there is no history or evidence of P. carinii pneumonia.\r"

  ".W": "We designed a study to determine whether thickening or effacement of the anterior wall stripe of the left lower lobe bronchus on the lateral chest radiograph implies adjacent disease, as it does for the posterior wall stripe of the right bronchus intermedius. The anterior wall stripe of the left lower lobe bronchus originates from the inferior anterior aspect of the end-on left bronchus and descends in a gentle posteriorly convex curve. The left lower lobe bronchus was identified on routine lateral chest films in 86 of 90 consecutive patients who also had chest CT. In those cases the anterior wall stripe was measured and categorized on chest films. On the CT scans, the length of the left lower lobe bronchus and its relationship to the left lower lobe artery and left upper lobe, lingular, and lower lobe veins were assessed. The presence of adjacent disease was noted. A complete anterior wall stripe was seen in 59 of 86 cases. It was effaced by anterior soft tissue in 15 of 86 cases; in 12 of 86 cases only the superior 0.5-1.5 cm was effaced. A normal anterior wall stripe was as thick as 12 mm in one case, but was 6 mm or less in 90%. Shapes other than linear were common. Anatomic variation accounted for nearly all of these findings. There was no focal abnormality in the 12 cases with partial effacement or in nine of the 15 cases with complete effacement; disease was significant in only two of these six. We concluded that thickening or effacement of the anterior wall stripe is an unreliable sign of disease.\r"

These terminations are termed the retroaortic anastomoses by anatomists. We studied the CT appearances of these veins on scans of one cadaver and seven patients. We found that the retroaortic anastomoses usually were clearly recognizable because of their continuity with the hemiazygos or accessory hemiazygos vein. However, it is sometimes possible to mistake these vessels for lymph nodes, especially when only short segments of the vessel are visible on a CT image or when the vessel is not clearly opacified by contrast material. Familiarity with the CT appearances of the hemiazygos and azygous veins can prevent their being mistaken for normal or enlarged lymph nodes.\r"

Because it is easier to obtain CT scans than chest radiographs after CT-guided interventional procedures, it is important to know the sensitivity of CT in detecting pneumothoraces. To determine the sensitivity of CT for detecting procedure-induced pneumothoraces, we retrospectively reviewed 70 pulmonary interventional procedures performed under CT guidance. The sensitivity for detecting pneumothoraces with CT was compared with the detection rate with expiratory chest radiographs. Thirty-two (46%) of 70 procedures resulted in pneumothorax. Twenty-nine (91%) of the pneumothoraces were detected on CT scans and 27 (84%) were detected on chest radiographs. The difference between these two detection rates was not statistically significant (p less than .90). We conclude that postprocedure CT scans can replace expiratory chest radiographs for the detection of pneumothoraces after CT-directed pulmonary procedures.\r"

This report describes five cases of lung hernias. Two were congenital cervical hernias, detected as incidental findings on chest radiographs of infants. One was a posttraumatic intercostal hernia detected on a chest radiograph and confirmed with CT. The remaining two were acquired intercostal hernias at the site of prior chest-tube drainage of tuberculous empyemas.

We studied the clinical and radiologic findings in nine patients with advanced pulmonary tuberculosis who presented with dysphagia. In each patient, dysphagia first occurred while the patient was on antituberculous therapy. Chest radiographs in each case showed extensive tuberculous disease of the lung, affecting especially the left upper lobe. In addition, dense mediastinal pleural fibrosis was seen along the medial aspects of the upper thorax. Tomograms did not show mediastinal lymph node enlargement. Barium esophagograms showed extrinsic compression and various degrees of narrowing of the supracarinal part of the esophagus. No mucosal abnormality was seen on esophagoscopy. On the basis of these findings, the compression of the esophagus in these patients was attributed solely to tuberculous mediastinal fibrosis. The dysphagia remained constant in all patients except one, in whom worsening dysphagia improved after balloon dilatation. We conclude that mediastinal fibrosis is a significant cause of dysphagia in patients with advanced pulmonary tuberculosis.\r"

  ".W": "The value of CT of the pelvis, 111In-labeled leukocyte scintigraphy, and contrast enema (pouchography) for detecting postsurgical complications was assessed in 44 patients with total colectomy, rectal mucosectomy, and ileoanal pouches. Ileoanal pouches were created as reservoirs from an ileal loop that was anastomosed to the dentate line of the anus and stayed connected to the remainder of the ileum. This pouch preserves the normal defecatory pathway and eliminates disease-producing mucosa. A total of 57 sets of examinations revealed 22 cases of normal postoperative findings, 22 of pouchitis, 13 of abscess, and three of fistula. Overall sensitivity for detecting complications with pouchography was 60% (18 of 30 findings); with CT, 78% (28 of 36 findings); and with scintigraphy, 79% (23 of 29 findings). Pouchitis was best diagnosed by scintigraphy (sensitivity, 80%), followed by CT (sensitivity, 71%) and pouchography (sensitivity, 53%). Only CT correctly diagnosed all cases of abscess. Fistulas were frequently missed by all three methods. If tests were combined, the overall sensitivity rose to 93% for the combination CT/scintigraphy and to 86% for CT/pouchography, but did not improve for pouchography/scintigraphy (78%). For evaluation of complications in patients with ileoanal pouches, CT should be the initial test. If an abscess is found, no further tests are needed. If CT findings are negative, a scintigram should be obtained. Our data did not establish a clear role for pouchography.\r"

  ".W": "Recent reports have described thickening and enhancement of the extrahepatic bile duct wall on CT scans obtained after administration of IV contrast material. We undertook this study to establish parameters for the normal thickness and enhancement of the bile duct wall on CT, and to develop a differential diagnosis for thickening of the duct wall. Routine CT examinations of 100 patients without biliary disease were evaluated prospectively. The common hepatic duct and common bile duct could be visualized in 66% and 82% of cases, respectively; the walls of these ducts could be separately discerned in 59% and 52%. The mean thickness of the duct wall was 1 mm, with a maximal thickness of 1.5 mm. Wall enhancement was similar to (51%), slightly greater than (44%), or markedly greater than (5%) the enhancement of adjacent pancreatic parenchyma. A review of records covering a 5-year period identified 52 patients in whom CT showed thickening of the bile duct wall (greater than or equal to 2 mm). These patients could be categorized by seven underlying diseases, and analysis of the CT scans revealed four general patterns of thickening. Focal, concentric wall thickening in the distal common bile duct was associated with pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, and common bile duct stones; focal, eccentric thickening tended to occur with cholangiocarcinoma and sclerosing cholangitis. Diffuse, concentric thickening was seen with acute cholangitis; diffuse, eccentric thickening was associated with oriental cholangiohepatitis and sclerosing cholangitis. Thickening of greater than 5 mm was seen only with cholangiocarcinoma. Enhancement of the duct wall in these groups varied and was of no predictive value. In summary, the extrahepatic bile ducts can be visualized in the majority of patients, and the normal duct wall should be 1.5 mm or less in thickness. Contrast enhancement of the duct wall occurs in patients without biliary tract disease and alone is predictive not predictive of pathology. Pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, common bile duct stones, cholangiocarcinoma, sclerosing cholangitis, acute cholangitis, and oriental cholangiohepatitis are associated with thickening of the duct wall.\r"

  ".W": "We analyzed the findings on plain abdominal radiographs in 24 patients who had adverse gastrointestinal reactions after chemotherapy with cytosine-arabinoside (Ara-C) for treatment of acute leukemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Ara-C was given with vincristine, VP 16-213, daunorubicin, amsacrine, adriamycin, or corticosteroids in various combinations and dosages. The abnormalities noted on plain abdominal radiographs included paralytic ileus (73%), cecal distension (38%), pneumatosis intestinalis (27%), thickened loops of small bowel (19%), and pneumoperitoneum (8%). One patient had small-bowel ileus simulating an obstruction. In 23%, death was directly related to gastrointestinal complications. Bowel wall erosions, necrosis, and transmural or submucosal hemorrhage were the main findings at autopsy. This experience suggests that plain abdominal radiographs are useful in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal complications associated with chemotherapy with Ara-C.\r"

Criteria considered specific for infarction on CT were identified in nine (39%) of 23 patients and comprised pneumatosis in seven patients (30%), mesenteric or portal venous gas in three patients (13%), and focally thick-walled bowel in two patients (9%). Criteria considered specific for bowel infarction on plain films were identified in seven (30%) of 23 patients and comprised focally edematous bowel in six patients (26%) and pneumatosis intestinalis in one patient (4%). Only one patient had specific changes on both CT and plain films, but 15 (65%) of the 23 showed specific changes on at least one study. The results indicate that plain films remain an important tool in patients suspected of mesenteric infarction and can provide information that is complementary to CT. Also, as both studies were nonspecific in eight (35%) of our patients, negative or nonspecific findings should not deter further diagnostic or interventional procedures in patients in whom the clinical suspicion of bowel infarction is high.\r"

Because venous pooling contributes significantly to this disorder, the venoconstrictive properties of ergotamine offer theoretical advantages over pure arteriolar pressor agents. However, the low and erratic bioavailability of oral preparations has hindered the use of ergotamine. Accordingly, the efficacy of inhaled ergotamine tartrate (1 puff, 0.36 mg) was compared to placebo in 8 patients with severe autonomic failure. Blood pressure was monitored in the seated position with an automated device. Ergotamine produced significant increases in systolic (29 +/- 5 mm Hg, p less than 0.01 by analysis of variance) and diastolic (13 +/- 1 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) blood pressures compared to placebo (-9 +/- 5 and -2 +/- 3, respectively). Upright blood pressure 2 hours after administration was significantly greater with ergotamine (119 +/- 8/69 +/- 6 mm Hg) vs placebo (82 +/- 7/59 +/- 5 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). Motionless standing time, a measurement of functional capacity, also improved with ergotamine (200 +/- 58 vs 85 +/- 22 seconds). No side effects were noted, but patients with coronary or peripheral artery disease were excluded. Inhaled ergotamine may provide an effective and practical therapy for disabling orthostatic hypotension due to autonomic failure.\r"

The venodilatory effect of nitroglycerin was not altered by pretreatment with nifedipine. VV[30] increased by 0.72 +/- 0.14 cc/100 cc arm after nitroglycerin in subjects pretreated with placebo compared to 0.70 +/- 0.09 cc/100 cc arm in subjects pretreated with nifedipine. These results suggest that, at a dose of 10 mg, nifedipine does not venodilate and the venodilatory effect of nitroglycerin is not altered by pretreatment with nifedipine.\r"

  ".W": "An unusual large cell lymphoma of the proximal jejunum with large granular lymphocyte (LGL) morphologic characteristics and T-helper/inducer cell phenotype is described. Although the cells strongly expressed Leu-7 (HNK-1), studies with antibodies directed against the more specific natural killer (NK) antigens, CD16 (Leu-11) and Leu-19, were negative. Ultrastructural analysis of the neoplastic cells demonstrated substantial numbers of electron-dense granules and rare parallel tubular arrays. Clonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor beta chain gene and germline configuration of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene confirmed the T-cell origin of the neoplastic cells. This lymphoma pursued an aggressive clinical course, with rapid dissemination to the lungs and central nervous system. DNA content analysis indicated that a similar DNA aneuploid population was present in the jejunal primary and lung tissue at recurrence. There was no evidence of nodal, peripheral blood, splenic, or bone marrow involvement. Morphologic and functional similarities between the lymphoid tissues of the gastrointestinal tract and lung have previously prompted a classification of the immune system into distinct peripheral somatic and mucosal components. Based on the distribution and migratory properties of the tumor cells in this case, the authors propose that this lymphoma arose from a minor mucosa-associated LGL subset that may be unrelated to circulating LGLs. In addition, these observations emphasize that prominent granulated cytomorphologic features may be seen in neoplastic disorders with the T-helper/inducer phenotype, as well as in the more widely recognized lymphoproliferative disorders of NK and cytotoxic/suppressor cell types.\r"

In addition, anti-HBc has recently been suggested to be a surrogate marker for non-A, non-B hepatitis agents in donated blood. The authors studied prospectively the HBV antigen and antibody status in four patients with chronic hepatitis and persistent presence of isolated anti-HBc in their sera. The serologic and histopathologic findings of these four patients were compared with those of three groups of patients having chronic hepatitis with or without HBV markers. A low concentration of serum HBV DNA was detected in only one of the four patients with hepatitis with isolated anti-HBc and in another patient with previous HBV infection. HBV antigens and HBV DNA were not detected in the sera and liver biopsies from the remaining patients with hepatitis with isolated anti-HBc and other patients with hepatitis with or without serologic markers of previous hepatitis A or HBV infection. In contrast, all patients with chronic HBV-associated hepatitis had detectable HBV DNA, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) in their sera and/or liver biopsies. These findings suggest that chronic hepatitis associated with isolated anti-HBc is a heterogenous pathologic entity. The condition of some of these patients may represent a variant of non-A, non-B hepatitis, whereas the remaining patients are chronic hepatitis B carriers with low serum concentrations of HBV.\r"

Although exons 5 and 6 were involved in three of the four partial gene deletions, the extent of the DNA lost differs in each case. The fourth deletion was located entirely within intron 1 and segregated with the disease in a large hemophilia pedigree. There was no history of hemophilia in eight of the 10 families. The origin of the mutation was determined in six of these pedigrees, two of which showed evidence for maternal mosaicism.\r"

This close relationship is further strengthened by the complementary localization of their receptors in the brain, adrenal gland, vasculature, and kidney. In many physiologic situations including postural changes, volume expansion, water immersion, high altitude, and lower body negative pressure, the plasma levels of ANP and angiotensin II change inversely. In congestive heart failure, renin and aldosterone levels may initially be suppressed by high levels of ANP. Similarly the low renin levels associated with increasing age and with elderly hypertensive patients, may be the result of the elevation of plasma ANP that occurs with aging. ANP may thus be the endogenous antagonist of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system. These two opposing systems allow fine-tuning of volume and pressure by the body.\r"

  ".W": "In the past decade, significant progress has been made in understanding structure-function relationships of the new quinolones, which have a N-1-substituted, 1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-pyridine-3-carboxylic acid moiety as the basic nucleus. Modification of the groups affixed to positions C-6, C-7, and C-8 has made a major change in the antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetic, and metabolic properties of the quinolones as have changes in the moieties affixed to the N-1 nitrogen. The new quinolones have a carboxyl group at position 3 and a keto group at C-4. The presence of a fluorine atom at C-6 enhances the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) gyrase inhibitory activity as well as the ability of the compounds to inhibit staphylococci. Position C-7 has been one of the most modified sites. Addition of a piperazinyl group markedly increased gram-positive activity, primarily antistaphylococcal activity; lowered the minimal inhibitory concentrations against Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus spp., and Neisseria spp.; and added activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa compared with nalidixic acid. Methyl derivatives of the piperazine group or of the pyrroles have longer half-lives than do unsubstituted moieties. At the N-1 position, a cyclopropyl group appears to be most potent with respect to minimal inhibitory concentrations against Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas. Ofloxacin is unique in that it has an oxygen substituted at C-8 with the substituent part of the ring system formed by fusion to the N-1 position. This has produced excellent in vitro activity against gram-positive species comparable with that of ciprofloxacin, excellent activity against the Enterobacteriaceae, and antipseudomonal activity superior to agents with an ethyl substitution at position N-1. The oxazine ring of ofloxacin provides excellent oral absorption with virtually 95 percent bioavailability; this modification also has prevented metabolism and has provided a long half-life of seven to eight hours.\r"

Post-treatment culture results showed that ofloxacin had eradicated N. gonorrhoeae in 97.5 percent (41 men) of 42 men and all 28 women evaluated. Amoxicillin-probenecid achieved microbiologic cures in 92.7 percent (51 men) of 55 men and 92.6 percent (25 women) of 27 women evaluated. Clinical cure rates among initially symptomatic patients were 84.6 percent (33 men) of 39 men and 81.8 percent (nine women) of 11 women with ofloxacin and 83.0 percent (44 men) of 53 men and 66.7 percent (10 women) of 15 women with amoxicillin-probenecid. No drug-related adverse effects were noted in ofloxacin-treated patients. One patient each in the amoxicillin-probenecid group reported nausea, diarrhea, and vaginitis. These results demonstrate that single-dose ofloxacin is as effective as amoxicillin-probenecid in eradicating N. gonorrhoeae and relieving clinical signs and symptoms of gonococcal infections in both men and women.\r"

Between March 1986 and March 1988, 60 intravascular fetal transfusions were performed in 20 patients. Fetal transfusions were excluded from analysis if blood samples were unable to be obtained before and after transfusion, as well as at the beginning of the next transfusion or birth. Fifty-three procedures were analyzed. Two equations were used to predict the fetal hematocrit at the subsequent transfusion. The difference between observed and predicted hematocrits at the beginning of a subsequent transfusion or birth was -0.9% +/- 5.8% with equation 2, which was the more accurate formula in the majority of fetuses. Prediction of fetal hematocrit decline may be used to determine the optimum timing of repeat transfusion.\r"

However, the rapid transfusion of high-hematocrit blood should increase vessel distention and the flow shear force. Each is known to stimulate the release of prostacyclin. We measured prostaglandins E2 and F2 alpha and the stable metabolite of prostacyclin, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, by radioimmunoassay before, at the estimated midway point of, and at the completion of 40 umbilical venous transfusions performed because of immune hemolytic anemia. Umbilical venous pressures corrected for amniotic fluid pressure were measured at similar intervals during nine of the procedures. The mean (+/- SEM) length of gestation at transfusion was 29 +/- 1 week, opening hematocrit 23% +/- 1%, and total volume of 70% hematocrit red blood cells transfused 83 +/- 5 ml. 6-Keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha was the principal circulating fetal prostanoid and its concentration was unrelated to gestational age. Intravenous transfusion was associated with an 84% increase in 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (p = 0.03) and a 68% increase in prostaglandin E2 (p less than 0.05). The rise for each strongly correlated with the rise in the fetal umbilical venous pressure (6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, r = 0.94, p = 0.0005; prostaglandin E2, r = 0.81, p less than 0.03). We conclude that 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha is the principal circulating prostaglandin in the human fetus and that the release of venodilator prostaglandins may be one reason the human fetus can tolerate a large increase in intravascular volume without obvious sequelae.\r"

  ".W": "Placentas obtained from women with preeclampsia produce more thromboxane and less prostacyclin than normal. They also produce more progesterone than normal. This study tested whether a progesterone concentration equivalent to that in the medium after in vitro incubation of placentas from women with preeclampsia (greater than or equal to 1.5 x 10(-5) mol/L) could cause an imbalance of increased thromboxane and decreased prostacyclin production by normal placentas. Fresh term placental tissues were incubated for 48 hours in the absence or presence of various concentrations of progesterone and/or estradiol. Prostacyclin and thromboxane were determined by radioimmunoassay of their stable metabolites, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha and thromboxane B2. A progesterone concentration of 1.5 x 10(-5) mol/L significantly (p less than 0.001) inhibited prostacyclin production, compared with control, but lower concentrations did not. Estradiol at concentrations present in the medium after incubation of either normal or preeclamptic placental tissue did not significantly affect prostacyclin production, nor did it prevent progesterone at 1.5 x 10(-5) mol/L from inhibiting prostacyclin. Thromboxane production was not affected by either progesterone or estradiol. Conclusion: In vitro addition of progesterone at a concentration equivalent to that in the medium after incubation of preeclamptic placentas inhibited prostacyclin production by normal placentas to a rate characteristic of preeclampsia. However, it did not increase thromboxane. Speculation: Increased trophoblast progesterone in preeclampsia may act by a paracrine mechanism to inhibit prostacyclin synthesis in placental vasculature. Progesterone's selective inhibition of prostacyclin without affecting thromboxane may be due to the compartmentalization of thromboxane production to trophoblast and stroma and prostacyclin production to placental vasculature.\r"

We studied the effects of aspirin on eicosanoid production by different compartments of normal term human placental villi. Duplicate parallel incubations (n = 7) of whole villi, villous core tissues, and trophoblast were established on Millicell platform dishes in minimum essential medium in the presence or absence of 1 x 10(-4) or 1 x 10(-5) mol/L aspirin. Production rates of thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin were estimated by radioimmunoassay of their stable hydrolysis products, thromboxane B2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, respectively. Our results indicate that 1 x 10(-4) mol/L aspirin inhibits thromboxane production in whole villi and villous core tissues denuded of their trophoblast layer but not in isolated trophoblast cells. The same concentration of aspirin also inhibits prostacyclin production in the isolated villous core but not in whole villi and not in isolated trophoblast. We conclude that aspirin can selectively inhibit thromboxane production in whole placental villi and differentially affects thromboxane and prostacyclin production by the trophoblast and villous core compartments.\r"

Neither right nor left atrial concentrations of atrial natriuretic factor were elevated during pregnancy in animals on a normal diet, but both were increased during the first 2 days after delivery. Term pregnant rats on a high-salt diet showed a small increase in atrial natriuretic factor levels in the left atria only, without any change in plasma atrial natriuretic factor levels.

To compare the molecular events in compensatory ovarian growth with those known to occur in other compensatory growth processes such as the regenerating liver, the temporal pattern of proto-oncogene expression and dexoyribonucleic acid synthesis was investigated in rat ovarian tissue after unilateral castration. One hundred fifty female rats were subjected to either a left hemioophorectomy or a sham oophorectomy. Twenty-four rats from each group were put to death at 3 and 14 days after the initial procedure and the ovaries were weighed. There was a mean compensatory weight increase in the right ovaries of the hemioophorectomy group of 7.9% at 3 days and 22.5% at 14 days. The temporal pattern of proto-oncogene expression was determined by removing the right ovary from six rats in each group at 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours after the initial procedure. The ovaries were paired into three samples in each group for each time point and the ribonucleic acid was extracted. Dot blot hybridization was performed on each ribonucleic acid sample with radiolabeled complementary deoxyribonucleic acid probes for the proto-oncogenes c-myc, c-HA-ras, and c-fos. There was no significant increase in proto-oncogene expression in the right ovaries of the hemioophorectomy group when compared with the right ovaries of the sham oophorectomy group. The temporal pattern of dexoyribonucleic acid synthesis was determined by removing the right ovary from three rats in each group at 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours after the initial procedure. Each rat had been injected intraperitoneally with [3H]thymidine 2 hours before the right oophorectomy. The specific activity of dexoyribonucleic acid extracted from each ovarian sample did not demonstrate a significant increase in ovarian dexoyribonucleic acid synthesis after hemioophorectomy or any significant difference in dexoyribonucleic acid synthesis between the hemioophorectomy and the sham oophorectomy groups. This report concludes that compensatory ovarian growth occurs by a mechanism distinct from compensatory growth in the regenerating liver.\r"

Four hundred eighty two patients were prospectively included with serum measurement of apolipoprotein-AI within 10 days before liver biopsy. Pathologic features were semiquantitatively assessed by two observers. In 28 patients liver biopsy was used for histomorphometric assessment of fibrosis and immunohistochemical labeling of apolipoprotein-AI. Serum apolipoprotein-AI was negatively correlated to semiquantitative score of fibrosis (r = -0.50; p less than 0.001), independently of the scores of steatosis and alcoholic hepatitis (r = -0.44; p less than 0.001) and of the value of serum albumin, bilirubin, and prothrombin time (r = -0.22; p less than 0.001) and independently of the nutritional parameters (r = -0.29; p less than 0.009). The mean value of apolipoprotein-AI decreased according to the grade of fibrosis from 220 +/- 6 mg/dl (mean +/- SEM) to 110 +/- 8 mg/dl. Serum apolipoprotein-AI was negatively correlated to the percentage of fibrosis (r = -0.70; p less than 0.001) in the biopsies morphometrically assessed. The labeling was superimposed to the extracellular matrix. In conclusion, this study shows that decrease of apolipoprotein-AI is a serum and tissue marker of liver fibrosis independently of steatosis, alcoholic hepatitis, liver function tests, and nutritional parameters.\r"

However, mediators of allergy, such as histamine, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), isoproterenol, and adenosine, may serve to mitigate this inflammation through feedback inhibition of neutrophil function. To test the hypothesis that PMN activation and feedback inhibition mechanisms may be abnormal in asthmatics, we compared both superoxide production and adenosine-induced suppression of superoxide production in 12 matched pairs of asthmatics and control subjects. PMN obtained from asthmatic patients generated significantly more superoxide in response to f-met-leu-phe (fMLP) than controls (2.94 +/- 55 nmol/5 x 10(5) PMN/5 min versus 1.38 +/- 0.35 at 2 x 10(-8) M fMLP and 3.81 +/- 0.68 nmol versus 2.04 +/- 0.45 nmol at 10(-7) M; p less than 0.01 for both). In contrast, the respiratory burst generated by two receptor-independent stimuli, the calcium ionophore A23187 and phorbol myristate acetate, was equivalent between control and asthmatic subjects. At 10(-6) M, 2-chloroadenosine induced a 19.5 +/- 5.1% inhibition of fMLP-stimulated superoxide production in PMN from patients with asthma as compared to 55.6 +/- 24.6% inhibition in PMN from control subjects (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, the correlation between bacterial adherence to tracheal epithelial cells (TEC) and the acquisition of pneumonia and whether intubation or its duration affects bacterial adherence to TEC is unknown. To examine these factors we initially established that the normal adhesion index range for Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain 492c adherence to TEC was zero to 18.83 cfu/TEC on the basis of the adhesion indices of 12 healthy volunteers and 20 surgical patients undergoing elective bronchoscopy. Forty-two analyses of the adhesion index for P. aeruginosa binding to TEC of 24 ICU patients were performed in this study. Analysis of the data indicated that the adhesion index was not correlated with intubation or the duration of intubation. However, an elevated bacterial adhesion index was significantly (p less than 0.001) correlated with pneumonitis. Pneumonitis was observed in 11 of the 12 patients who had an elevated or augmented bacterial adhesion index, whereas pneumonitis was observed in only one of 12 patients who had a normal adhesion index. The bacterial adhesion index was found to parallel the clinical situation in five patients where three patients developed high adhesion indices and acquired pneumonitis and two patients who initially had pneumonitis and elevated adhesion indices subsequently resolved their pneumonitis, and their adhesion indices fell to within the normal range.\r"

We investigated the role of alveolar macrophages in defense against Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in the lower respiratory tract. Intratracheal inoculation of formalin-inactivated P. aeruginosa (1 x 10(8)-1 x 10(10) organisms) into normal rats resulted in increase in the number of neutrophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid obtained 24 h later. The phagocytic activity of neutrophils for P. aeruginosa was higher than that of alveolar macrophages. These findings indicate that neutrophils are essential for phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa in the lower respiratory tract. On incubation with P. aeruginosa, alveolar macrophages released neutrophil chemotactic factor (NCF) dose-dependently. MDP-Lys(L18), a muramyl dipeptide analog, stimulated alveolar macrophages to phagocytize P. aeruginosa and stimulate the release of NCF from alveolar macrophages in vitro and enhanced the neutrophil response to inoculated P. aeruginosa in vivo. These results indicate that alveolar macrophages are important in initiating the neutrophil-dependent defense system against P. aeruginosa by releasing NCF and that MDP-Lys(L18) can amplify the defense system.\r"

At our institution, tuberculosis occurs commonly among patients with and without HIV infection. We sought to determine the frequency of M. tuberculosis bacteremia among patients with newly diagnosed tuberculosis. During a 4-month period, mycobacterial blood cultures were obtained on all identifiable patients with newly diagnosed tuberculosis. Fifteen percent (9/59) of consecutive patients with tuberculosis had positive blood cultures for M. tuberculosis. Twenty-six percent (7/27) of patients known to be infected with HIV had positive mycobacterial blood cultures; two intravenous drug users who refused HIV-serologic testing also had positive mycobacterial blood cultures. M. tuberculosis bacteremia occurred at a higher rate among HIV-infected patients with an AIDS-defining opportunistic infection in addition to tuberculosis (3/3) than among HIV-infected patients without such an opportunistic infection (4/24; p less than 0.02). M. tuberculosis bacteremia occurred in 83% (5/6) of patients with disseminated tuberculosis and in 8% (4/53) of patients without disseminated tuberculosis (p less than 0.001). In all cases, tuberculosis was diagnosed in patients with M. tuberculosis bacteremia or else they died prior to the blood cultures demonstrating mycobacterial growth (mean time to detection of mycobacterial growth: 43 days). However, the frequent occurrence of M. tuberculosis bacteremia in HIV-infected patients with disseminated tuberculosis suggests that mycobacterial blood cultures may help confirm the diagnosis of tuberculosis in this group of patients.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine the distribution of alveolar ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) in six patients with mild liver disease and severe hypoxemia (PaO2 at rest in sitting or standing position ranged from 35 to 67 mm Hg). Orthodeoxia was documented with improvement in PaO2 in the supine position in each patient (PaO2 at rest in supine position ranged from 46 to 75 mm Hg). VA/Q distribution was measured by the multiple inert gas elimination technique. The dispersion of VA/Q was increased with small portions of the cardiac output (0.5 to 14.8%) perfusing low VA/Q areas (O less than VAless than 0.1). Another major finding was a large right-to-left shunt (VA/Q less than 0.005) that ranged from 4 to 28%. The VA/Q mismatching and the right-to-left shunt both contributed to the hypoxemia. The predicted PaO2 was 5.5 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) larger than the measured PaO2. In each patient, the mean pulmonary artery pressure was low and the cardiac output was elevated. These results show that the low PaO2 in these patients was due to both increased right-to-left shunt and VA/Q mismatching, but impaired diffusion could not be ruled out.\r"

Bacteriologic data come from cultures of sputum or accessible lung effluent from bronchoscopy. Our objective was to localize Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) in situ in order to provide descriptive data on the relationship between the presence of PA and disease of the surrounding tissue. Using stored, uncut blocks of preserved lung, we deparaffinized, cut, mounted, and reacted them with high-titer rabbit sera made to a mucoid strain of PA. The tissues were then reacted with a second antibody, biotinylated goat antirabbit immunoglobulin, developed using a peroxidase technique and counterstained with hematoxylin. PA organisms stained with heavy brown deposits and this was species-specific. In five patients with CF chronically colonized with PA, the organisms could easily be localized in multiple sections. Microscopic study demonstrated that location was generally endobronchiolar and associated with bronchiolar obliterative changes, mainly in small (less than 1 mm) airways. Extraluminal PA organisms were rare even when there was chronic interstitial inflammation. This study demonstrated the presence of PA at the location where physiologic damage in CF is most severe--the small bronchioles--strengthening the association between PA and pulmonary deterioration in CF.\r"

In catheter-implanted, unanesthetized rats, intraperitoneal injection of Salmonella enteritidis endotoxin (2 mg/kg) decreased cardiac output and systemic blood pressure while increasing total pulmonary vascular resistance. Db-cAMP (1 mg given intraperitoneally every 30 min), although not significantly affecting cardiac output and systemic blood pressure, blocked the increase in total pulmonary resistance caused by endotoxin. Ninety minutes after intraperitoneal endotoxin injection, perfused lungs from endotoxin-treated rats exhibited increased pulmonary vascular permeability, as assessed by increased extravascular accumulation of 125I-albumin and water. Db-cAMP treatment in vivo markedly attenuated the increases in lung albumin leak index and wet-to-dry weight ratio caused by endotoxin without affecting lung microvascular pressures. This protective action of db-cAMP is not due to its effect on prostaglandin or leukotriene synthesis since endotoxin-stimulated increases in lung tissue 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, thromboxane B2 and leukotriene C4 were not inhibited. We conclude that db-cAMP blocks endotoxin-induced lung injury in the rat by a mechanism independent of eicosanoid products and speculate that agents that increase intracellular cAMP may be therapeutically useful in acute lung vascular injury.\r"

Oligoclonal IgG bands have been reported in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from PPS patients, suggesting that the syndrome is immune mediated or caused by persistent viral infection. We studied 15 paired serum and CSF samples and 6 unpaired CSF samples from a total of 21 patients with a prior history of poliomyelitis. Quantitative immune studies failed to show evidence for increased intrathecal IgG production relative to patients with noninflammatory central nervous system (CNS) disease. We found definite oligoclonal IgG bands in the CSF from only 1 patient, who also carried a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. An isoelectric focusing poliovirus antigen overlay study showed evidence that suggested a CNS-specific antipoliovirus immune response in only 1 patient. Our results fail to support a dysimmune or persistent viral cause for post-poliomyelitis progressive muscular atrophy or PPS.\r"

Since inheritance of some components of the electron transport chain is nonmendelian and since inhibition of the electron transport chain with the toxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine models Parkinson's disease in humans and animals, we evaluated catalytic activities of the electron transport chain in platelet mitochondria purified from patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. All 10 patients studied had significant reductions of complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) activity. Succinate:cytochrome c oxidoreductase activity was less strikingly reduced. We hypothesize that the complex I abnormality may have an etiological role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and that this defect may be derived via the mitochondrial genome.\r"

The residual activities of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex were 9 to 45% of control values in all specimens. Immunoblot analysis of mitochondrial proteins using polyclonal antibodies against the alpha and beta subunits of the first component (E1) of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex revealed markedly decreased amounts of cross-reacting material in 4 boys who died in infancy. Two of the boys were half brothers related through a common mother. A fifth boy had an alteration of the electrophoretic mobility of the E1 alpha subunit and normal E1 beta subunit abundance. The remaining 6 patients (2 boys and 4 girls) had normal findings on Western blot assay, and all 11 patients had normal E2 and E3 patterns. These findings suggest that the E1 alpha subunit gene represents a genetically vulnerable site on the X chromosome. Decreased abundance of E1 components appears to be associated with death in infancy. A normal Western blot analysis is compatible with long-term survival despite decreased catalytic activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.\r"

  ".W": "The structural changes of Alzheimer's disease (AD) include a widespread alteration of neuronal cell processes in addition to senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Since the antigenic characteristics of these abnormal neurites are similar to those of the abnormal neurites associated with the senile plaques, the question has been raised as to whether the widespread neuritic alteration is secondary to the deposition of amyloid. To answer this question, we examined brains from 2 subjects with a longer-lasting form of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) characterized by the presence of numerous neurofibrillary tangles but no senile plaques, 3 subjects with AD, and 2 age-matched controls. Light and electron immunocytochemical analyses revealed that abnormal neurites are present diffusely in SSPE cerebral cortex in the absence of amyloid deposits. These abnormal neurites were qualitatively identical to the widespread abnormal neurites of AD. The abnormal neurites, in contrast to the neurites of control brains, immunoreacted with antibodies to tau and ubiquitin. These distinctive antigenic features were due to the presence in these abnormal neurites of straight filaments, 14 to 16 nm in diameter, mixed with a few paired helical filaments. The spatial distribution of the widespread neuritic alteration correlated with that of neurofibrillary tangles in both conditions, but not with that of senile plaques in AD. The present findings demonstrate that a diffuse alteration of neurites similar to that present in AD takes place independently of the deposition of amyloid in SSPE, and they are consistent with the hypothesis that in AD, also, this alteration is not secondary to the deposition of amyloid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The causative lesion, which had escaped detection by cerebral angiography and repeated computed tomographic scanning, was shown by magnetic resonance imaging to be a small cavernous hemangioma in the right occipital lobe. This was treated by a course of fine-beam radiotherapy directed to the lesion. After treatment the partial attacks ceased, although one nocturnal clonic seizure occurred 12 months after radiotherapy and 6 weeks after stopping all anticonvulsant medication.\r"

A high correlation and level of absolute agreement was shown between paired finger prick and venepuncture blood spots, and between blood spot, serum spot, and serum samples. Healthy controls and non-infected patients with cystic fibrosis had low titres of antibody compared with patients with intermittent and chronic infection. The latter groups had significantly greater antibody titres than normal controls. This assay permits serial measurement of antibodies to P aeruginosa in patients of all ages with cystic fibrosis and may provide a means of assessing the value of such measurements in the detection and management of early infection.\r"

Monocytes from 11 trauma patients and 11 burn patients were suboptimally stimulated with interferon gamma and muramyl dipeptide, an analogue of bacterial wall products. The patients with sepsis showed significantly greater total TNF alpha levels (secreted in combination with cell-associated) 3 days before septic episodes, as compared with normal controls (32.38 to 2231.76 ng/10(6) monocytes per milliliter, median = 121.03 ng/10(6) monocytes per milliliter; normal control: 0.00 to 18.20 ng/10(6) monocytes per milliliter, median = 5.93 ng/10(6) monocytes per milliliter). Increases in patients' total monocyte TNF alpha levels greater than 30 ng/10(6) monocytes per milliliter correlated with septic episodes. In patients with sepsis, the total monocyte TNF alpha levels were increased despite a concomitant increase in their prostaglandin E2 levels in both stimulated (interferon gamma plus muramyl dipeptide) and unstimulated in vitro assays (9 patients: stimulated prostaglandin E2 range, 30.1 to 123.6 ng/10(6) monocytes per milliliter). Massively elevated monocyte TNF alpha and prostaglandin E2 production occurred simultaneously in patients with sepsis.\r"

However, circulating levels of TNF-alpha/cachectin have only been episodically detected in hospitalized patients with life-threatening bacterial infections. In the present report, increased quantities of immune-reactive TNF-alpha/cachectin were recovered from the livers of rats 3 days following a lethal burn and infection. Two species of TNF-alpha/cachectin were detected, one of approximately 29 kd and the other 17 kd, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In murine peritoneal macrophages and rat Kupffer cells stimulated in vitro with endotoxin, a 29-kd cell-associated and 17-kd secreted form were also detected. We conclude that the increased appearance in vivo of a 29-kd form of TNF-alpha/cachectin from the livers of lethally burned and infected rats represents a novel cell-associated form of the protein.\r"

Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide was measured at rest, at each workload until exhaustion, and 15 and 30 minutes after the exercise test. Echocardiography showed that the athletes had a significantly larger left atrium, left ventricular end diastolic diameter, left ventricular posterior wall, interventricular septum, left ventricular ejection fraction, and left ventricular mass than the controls. The athletes performed significantly more work than the control group--325 W v 277 W. The plasma concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide rose by a mean factor of 2.76 (range 1.78-4.28) in all men from rest to maximum exercise. There were no differences between the athletes and the controls in the concentrations of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide at rest, at any workload, or at maximum workload. Neither was there any difference in the increase in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide between the groups. There was no correlation between the plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide and any of the variables measured by echocardiography. In healthy young men plasma atrial natriuretic peptide rises by a factor of about 2.8 during maximum exercise and the size of the chambers on the left side of the heart or left ventricular hypertrophy does not seem to influence the concentration of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide at rest or during exercise.\r"

In conclusion, this study has shown that the non-F.VIII sequences detected with the probe p482.6 are situated on the X chromosome, they seem to be present in two copies, and either or both copies infrequently possess a polymorphic XbaI site or a partial deletion.\r"

We report here the clinical and laboratory features of a 50-year-old woman with a life-long history of excessive bleeding. Her particular laboratory data are factor VIII (FVIII) deficiency, subnormal bleeding time, and the presence of all plasma and platelet vWF multimers in normal amounts. Infused with FVIII/vWF concentrate, she showed a persistent increase in FVIII that led us to discard hemophilia A carrier or \"acquired hemophilia\" diagnoses. vWF devoid of FVIII purified from normal and patient's plasma by immunoaffinity on anti-vWF monoclonal antibody (MoAb) was immobilized onto polystyrene tubes that were further incubated with purified normal FVIII. The bound FVIII was evidenced using radiolabeled anti-FVIII MoAb. The data showed that the patient's vWF, in contrast to vWF purified from normal plasma, was unable to bind FVIII. Furthermore, no inhibitor of FVIII/vWF interaction was evidenced in incubating purified normal vWF with the patient's plasma before the addition of FVIII and anti-FVIII MoAb. These results support the concept that the bleeding diathesis of this patient appears to be due mainly to her abnormal vWF preventing FVIII/vWF interaction. This abnormality, which is not yet described in present classification of vWD, could be considered as a new variant of vWD.\r"

Eight of the 14 patients had relapsed or had refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and received rhGM-CSF after intensive chemotherapy with novantrone (NO) and high-dose Ara-C (AC) (NOAC) as salvage regimen. Six other patients with NHL or Hodgkin's disease (HD) were in complete remission and treated with rhGM-CSF to enhance peripheral hematopoietic progenitor cell harvest for autografting. An increase in absolute lymphocyte count at the zenith of leukocyte elevation and a drastic increase in concentration of sIL-2R from a median of 565 U/mL to 6,700 U/mL on rhGM-CSF infusion were found in all patients. There was also a moderate increase in sCD8 levels from a median of 277 U/mL to 470 U/mL. Ten patients were available for serial studies of phenotypic changes in surface membrane antigens. A significant increase in CD25+ (IL-2R+) (P = .0020) and CD4+ (P = .0137) lymphocytes was observed in all patients, but no significant change in CD3+, CD8+, TCR delta 1+, or CD19+ cells. Elevations in absolute lymphocyte counts or in concentrations of sIL-2R or sCD8 were not observed in four other patients during recovery from intensive chemotherapy without rhGM-CSF support. Our results provide evidence that administration of rhGM-CSF might activate lymphocytes in vivo. The impact of this activation on the remission rate and duration, as well as survival in patients with NHL, warrants further investigation.\r"

  ".W": "Neutrophil dysfunction consequent to influenza A virus infection has been described in vivo and in vitro and may contribute to the serious bacterial sequelae which occur in influenza-infected hosts. On the premise that such dysfunction may represent a form of \"deactivation,\" we sought to characterize neutrophil activation by the virus in comparison with other agonists. The virus induces a respiratory burst in which H2O2 (but not O2-) are formed. Preceding the respiratory burst, a rise in intracellular calcium (Ca2+i) is noted, but both responses are nearly independent of extracellular Ca2+, unlike those elicited by the other well-characterized Ca2+-dependent agonists, formyl-methyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP), or Concanavalin-A (Con-A). The Ca2+ increase is paralleled by IP3 generation, implying that it is the result of phospholipase C (PLC) activation. The virus also elicits neutrophil membrane depolarization, which is independently mediated from the Ca2+ increase and respiratory burst and may reflect protein kinase C (PK-C) activation. Virus-induced responses are insensitive to pertussis toxin (PT); cholera toxin does inhibit these responses but in a nonspecific manner. Thus, although influenza virus activates PLC in neutrophils, it does so in a PT-insensitive manner and does not elicit or require a discernible Ca2+ influx to generate a respiratory burst response. In aggregate, the data indicate that influenza A virus activates neutrophils in a manner distinct from that of other well-described neutrophil agonists. These results illustrate the diversity of neutrophil activation mechanisms and support the notion that further characterization of this pathway may facilitate understanding of neutrophil dysfunction induced by the virus.\r"

We studied human umbilical vein endothelial cells cultured in vitro. The cells contained TC II (2.3 pmol/10(8) cells) and released progressively increasing amounts of the protein into the surrounding medium during the 3-day incubation period. This release exceeded the starting intracellular content of TC II. In contrast, endothelial cells did not contain or elaborate R binder, the other major circulating binding protein for cobalamin, Cycloheximide inhibited the elaboration of TC II, suggesting that the endothelial cells synthesize the protein. Thrombin, which stimulates tissue plasminogen activator release, did not enhance TC II release, and neither did endotoxin or mellitin. However, thrombin did appear to partially protect TC II release from inhibition by cycloheximide. Among other cells studied, human fibroblasts also released TC II into the incubation medium, while K562 human leukemia cells, ARH-77 and HS Sultan human plasma cell lines, and Raji strain lymphoblasts did not. The data suggest that endothelial cells are an important source of the metabolically crucial TC II.\r"

We found that treatment of intact cells with either phospholipase A2 or proteases such as papain did not alter the size of Rh antigen-containing polypeptides. In contrast, phospholipase A2 treatment followed by papain digestion cleaved a fraction of these polypeptides. This cleavage appears, from such digestions of Rh(D) positive and negative cells of different genotypes, to occur solely at the extracellular domain of Rh(D) polypeptide, while the extracellular domains of other Rh antigen-containing polypeptides are unaffected. Digestion of red blood cell ghosts and inside-out vesicles with trypsin showed that Rh(D), (C/c), and (E/e) antigen-containing polypeptides span the lipid bilayer having cytoplasmic domains susceptible to the action of proteases. The size of the cleavage products at the cytoplasmic domain of -D-/-D- cells was found to differ from that of other Rh(D) positive genotypes, due possibly to a difference in folding of Rh(D) polypeptide at its cytoplasmic domain and within the cellular membrane of these cells.\r"

  ".W": "Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN), or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) triggered the rapid, stable phosphorylation of a 75-Kd protein (p75) when incubated with permeabilized HL60 human myeloid leukemia cells in the presence of [gamma-32P] ATP. Among several chemical inducers of HL60 cell differentiation, dimethyl sulfoxide also triggered p75 labeling, but retinoic acid or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate did not elicit this response. Pretreatment of cells with G-CSF or GM-CSF for more than 30 seconds before permeabilization rendered the p75 labeling undetectable, suggesting that ligand-stimulated labeling was rapidly completed within this time in intact cells. Phosphorylation of p75 occurred on serine and tyrosine residues. This conclusion was confirmed by direct phosphoamino acid analysis. Immunoblot analysis of lysates of intact HL60 cells that had been incubated with G-CSF, GM-CSF, IFN, or TNF confirmed that tyrosine phosphorylation of a p75 also occurred in response to these cytokines in intact cells. Pretreatment of intact HL60 cells with one biologic agent or dimethyl sulfoxide abolished p75 labeling in response to incubation of permeabilized cells with a second agent, strongly suggesting that the same protein was phosphorylated in response to these treatments. p75 labeling was strictly dependent on expression of the appropriate ligand receptor. Data suggest that activation of a tyrosine kinase system is an early response to the binding of G-CSF, GM-CSF, TNF, or IFN to their respective cell surface receptors, or to the addition of dimethyl sulfoxide, and that the resulting phosphorylation event(s) may play a role in securing common elements in the biologic responses to these agents.\r"

Circulating noninhibitory antibodies complexed with factor IX have been demonstrated in tolerant hemophilia B patients. Similar findings are now described in six tolerant hemophilia A patients. Complexes between factor VIII and the 'tolerant' antibody were demonstrated by subjecting plasma to gel filtration chromatography, void fractions containing factor VIII/vWF complexes being collected and adsorbed to protein A. Using 125I-labeled F(ab')2 fragments against IgG subclass and factor VIII antigen, complexes between an IgG4 antibody and factor VIII were found to adsorb to protein A. After infusion of factor VIII to tolerant patients, all factor VIII circulated in complex with IgG4 antibody. In three of the patients, the 'tolerant' antibodies inhibited an ELISA specific for factor VIII light chain but, unlike the pretolerant antibodies, did not bind radiolabeled factor VIII heavy chain. Although after induction of tolerance the patients still have circulating IgG4 antibodies against factor VIII, the antibodies differ in specificity, lack coagulation inhibitory activity, and do not enhance the rate of elimination of factor VIII.\r"

In both cases, the immunopurified dysfunctional factor VIII protein is abnormal, in that the 80 Kd light chain is not cleaved by thrombin at arginine-1689. The basis for this failure was identified by polymerase chain reaction amplification of exon 14 of the variant factor VIII genes and direct sequencing of the amplified products. In both cases, a single base substitution (C to T) was identified that produces an arginine to cysteine substitution at amino acid residue 1689. These data identify the molecular defects of the two identical factor VIII variant proteins.

The fluorescent label is the TAB murine monoclonal antibody directed against human platelet GP IIB, together with a fluorescein-conjugated goat F(ab')2 against murine immunoglobulin. The combination assures specificity for platelet membranes, yet leaves platelet function intact. TAB is first added to gently mixed, citrated human blood; the second antibody is added 1 hour after the first, mixing continuing for a second hour. Bovine aortic endothelial cell monolayers (ECMs), grown on rectangular cover glasses precoated with microfibrillar collagen, comprise one wall of a flow chamber mounted on a vertical microscope stage. A loop of 6-0 sterile suture is drawn across the ECM in order to create microinjuries of width 70 +/- 15 microns (mean +/- SD) oriented in a direction transverse to flow. Platelet adhesion/aggregation is virtually absent on intact and confluent regions of the monolayer. On micro-injury sites and at shear rates of 60 to 1,080 sec-1, however, computer-enhanced images obtained by means of videomicroscopy show arrival and adherence of single platelets resulting in the formation of platelet aggregates elongated in the flow direction. When the monolayers are pretreated with 1.0 mmol/L lysine acetylsalicylate, the mean aggregate thickness increases (2P less than .05) to 260 +/- 58% (mean +/- SE, N = 6) of control, aggregates are regularly shed downstream, and the surface area of the injury site covered by platelets is augmented (2P less than .05) from 14.8 +/- 3.9% to 49.2 +/- 4.7% (mean +/- SE, N = 6). Donor ingestion of aspirin, on the other hand, leads to an increase (2P less than .01) in percent surface coverage to 42.7 +/- 8.5 without a concomitant increase in mean aggregate thickness. In parallel with the above, outflow levels of serum thromboxane and prostacyclin are measured by radioimmunoassays (RIAs) for thromboxane B2 and 6-Keto-PGF1 alpha, respectively. Thromboxane B2 is increased (2P less than .01) by monolayer pretreatment with lysine acetylsalicylate from 5.08 +/- 1.47 to 9.35 +/- 2.42, but decreased (2P less than .05) after oral aspirin to 1.21 +/- 0.38 ng/mL (mean +/- SE, N = 6). Levels of 6-Keto-PGF1 alpha were reduced (2P less than .05) by monolayer pretreatment from 0.48 +/- 0.046 to 0.36 +/- 0.016 ng/mL. Platelet adhesion/aggregation at a site of injury to an endothelial cell monolayer, therefore, can be imaged in flowing blood in real time using a monoclonal antibody approach.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We previously demonstrated that newly formed intracellular histamine mediates platelet aggregation in response to phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA). We now report further investigations of the role of histamine during physiological activation of platelets by collagen. Platelets stirred with collagen produced histamine; the rise in histamine precedes the onset of aggregation. The dose response for collagen stimulation of histamine synthesis and platelet aggregation is similar. Inhibitors of histidine decarboxylase (HDC) block both aggregation and histamine synthesis in parallel. Histamine production is not dependent on aggregation; both the intracellular histamine receptor antagonist, N,N-diethyl-2-[4-(phenylmethyl)phenoxy]ethanamine-HCl (DPPE), and the cyclooxygenase inhibitors, aspirin and indomethacin, inhibit collagen-induced aggregation but not histamine synthesis. DPPE also inhibits collagen-induced serotonin secretion and thromboxane production. The effects of DPPE and HDC inhibitors are significantly reversed by the addition of histamine (0.1 to 10 mumol/L) to saponin-permeabilized platelets, though histamine alone has no pro-aggregatory effects. The results suggest that newly synthesized intracellular histamine has a role in collagen-induced platelet activation and that it may act to promote the generation of thromboxane and the secretion responses of platelet granules.\r"

Two patients are still alive: one had a relapse 24 months after the initial diagnosis, while the other is in complete remission. The main pathological feature was the infiltration of the marrow, spleen and liver by neoplastic T cells, accompanied by an exuberant hyperplasia of benign-looking, hemophagocytizing histiocytes. The term \"peripheral T-cell lymphoma with hemophagocytic syndrome\" is proposed for this condition. Retrospective analysis of stored paraffin material (1949 to 1965) from the Radcliffe Infirmary files suggests that at least some of the cases designated as \"histiocytic medullary reticulosis\" by Scott and Robb-Smith were examples of the syndrome herein described.\r"

The frequency of point-mutation of the N-ras gene was not high (2 of 15), and one positive case who relapsed was analyzed in detail. Although N-ras gene activation was detected at both onset and relapse, the mutation sites were different. At onset, Gly (GGT) was changed to Ser (AGT) at codon 12, and at relapse, Gly (GGT) to Asp (GAT) was observed at the same codon. In addition, the DNA at relapse showed a remarkably higher transforming activity than the DNA at onset on two independent recipient cell lines. The identical cell surface phenotype and the same rearrangement patterns of both the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain and T-cell receptor (TCR) gamma chain genes indicated that the leukemic cells at onset and those at relapse were derived from the same precursor cell. Therefore, this case supports the concept that ras activation is not the event initiating leukemogenesis, but may be involved in leukemic progression.\r"

Previous investigations have indicated that diminished expression or regulation of Mac-1 may underlie abnormalities of stimulated adhesion and chemotaxis of neonatal neutrophils in vitro and inflammatory deficits in human neonates. To define the pathogenic mechanisms contributing to these findings, we compared the distribution and translocation of Mac-1 in subcellular fractions of neonatal and adult neutrophils before and after chemotactic stimulation. The total cell content of Mac-1 and the proportions of Mac-1 in beta fractions (vitamin B12 binding protein-rich granules), pre-gamma fractions (gelatinase-rich granules), or gamma fractions (plasma membrane) of neonatal neutrophils were comparable with those of adult neutrophils. However, after stimulation with N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP; 10 nmol/L, 37 degrees C, 15 minutes), neonatal neutrophils demonstrated (1) diminished translocation of Mac-1 from pre-gamma fractions (P less than .05), and (2) diminished surface expression of Mac-1 (P less than .05), as compared with healthy adult neutrophils. As shown in enzymatic and immunochemical assays, neonatal cells contained significantly (P less than .01) diminished levels of neutrophil gelatinase. In response to FMLP (0.1 to 10 nmol/L, 37 degrees C, 15 minutes), neonatal suspensions also released significantly (P less than .001) less gelatinase, as compared with adult neutrophil suspensions. These observations demonstrate that diminished mobilization of Mac-1 from gelatinase-rich granular pools in neonatal neutrophils is associated with abnormal surface expression of this glycoprotein after chemotactic stimulation. This abnormality may contribute, in part, to abnormal migratory properties of neonatal neutrophils in response to inflammatory stimuli.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To evaluate the associations between the use of aspirin and the incidences of cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and other chronic diseases. DESIGN--Postal questionnaire survey to elicit details of aspirin use. SETTING--Californian retirement community. SUBJECTS--All 22,781 residents of the community (white, affluent, and well educated) were sent a questionnaire that included questions on medical history and the use of drugs such as analgesics, laxatives, and vitamin supplements. In all 61% responded (13,987, 8881 women and 5106 men; median age 73). They formed the cohort that was followed up for 6 1/2 years using discharge summaries from three hospitals serving the area and death certificates from the health department. Only 13 respondents were lost to follow up but seemed not to have died. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Incidences of cardiovascular diseases, cancers, gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcers, and cataracts were compared in participants who did and did not take aspirin daily. RESULTS--Age adjusted incidences were computed with an internal standard and five age groups. By 1 January 1988 there had been 25 incident cases of kidney cancer among all participants; 341 incident cases of stroke, 253 of acute myocardial infarction, 220 of ischaemic heart disease, and 317 of other heart disease were reported among respondents without a reported history of angina, myocardial infarction, or stroke. The incidence of kidney cancer was raised among those who took aspirin daily compared with those who did not take it, although the increase was significant only in men (relative risks = 6.3, 95% confidence interval 2.2 to 17, for men and 2.1, 0.53 to 8.5, for women). Those who took aspirin daily showed no increased risk of any other cancer, except colon cancer for both sexes combined (relative risk = 1.5, 1.1 to 2.2). The risk of acute myocardial infarction was reduced slightly among regular users of aspirin in men but not women. The risk of ischaemic heart disease was almost doubled in those who took aspirin daily compared with non-users (relative risks = 1.9, 1.1 to 3.1, for men and 1.7, 1.1 to 2.7, for women). Small, non-significant increased risks of stroke were observed in both sexes. CONCLUSION--The daily use of aspirin increased the risk of kidney cancer and ischaemic heart disease.\r"

DESIGN--Women presenting in labour were tested for HIV-I. Their newborn babies were also tested. Women positive for the virus were followed up with their babies for two years. SETTING--Teaching hospital in Lusaka, Zambia. SUBJECTS--1954 Women, of whom 227 were seropositive. Of 205 babies, 192 were positive for HIV-I. After birth 109 seropositive mothers and their babies and 40 seronegative mothers and their babies were available for follow up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Serological examination of mothers and their babies by western blotting. Birth weight and subsequent survival of babies. Women and babies were tested over two years for signs of seroconversion and symptoms of infection with HIV, AIDS related complex, and AIDS. RESULTS--Of the 109 babies born to seropositive mothers and available for follow up, 18 died before 8 months, 14 with clinical AIDS. Of the 91 remaining, 23 were seropositive at 8 months. By 24 months 23 of 86 surviving babies were seropositive, and a further five infected babies had died, four were terminally ill, 17 had AIDS related complex, and two had no symptoms. The overall rate of perinatal transmission was 42 out of 109 (39%). The overall mortality of infected children at 2 years was 19 out of 42 (44%). Before the age of 1 year infected children had pneumonia and recurrent coughs, thereafter symptoms included failure to thrive, recurrent diarrhoea and fever, pneumonia, candidiasis, and lymphodenopathy. All babies had received live attenuated vaccines before 8 months with no adverse affects. CONCLUSIONS--Vertical transmission from infected mothers to their babies is high in Zambia and prognosis is poor for the babies. Perinatal transmission and paediatric AIDS must be reduced, possibly by screening young women and counselling those positive for HIV-I against future pregnancy.\r"

DESIGN--Uncontrolled clinical trials in infants deteriorating or failing to improve despite standard medical treatment. SETTING--Paediatric and neonatal intensive care units and paediatric wards. PATIENTS--88 Infants and young children aged 1 day to 2 years with respiratory failure due to bronchopulmonary dysplasia, the neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, bronchiolitis, myopathy, the congenital hypoventilation syndrome, pneumonitis, and postoperative phrenic nerve palsy. At the start of treatment 59 were receiving greater than or equal to 50% inspired oxygen and 40 positive airway pressure ventilation. INTERVENTION--Treatment was provided within purpose built Perspex chambers of appropriate size. The chamber incorporated safe and effective latex neck seals; facilities for access, monitoring, and observation; and a heater to control the ambient air temperature. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Inspired oxygen concentration and carbon dioxide pressure before application of negative extrathoracic pressure and two and 48 hours afterwards; duration of treatment; and final outcome (discharge home or death). RESULTS--While arterial oxygen saturation was maintained at constant values 75 infants showed reductions in inspired oxygen concentrations (range 4-50%, median 15%) two hours after starting treatment and 74 showed reductions at 48 hours (2-79%, median 20%). Of 59 infants who had carbon dioxide pressure measured before and after starting negative extrathoracic pressure, 21 showed a reduction (range 0.6-8.9 kPa, median 2.0), 30 no change (+/- 0.5 kPa), and eight a rise (range 0.6-5.1 kPa, median 2.1). In 28 patients extubation was facilitated, 54 patients were discharged home, where six continued treatment, and 34 died. Treatments lasted for between two and 236 days (median 13 days). CONCLUSION--Negative pressure respiratory support is a non-invasive yet effective treatment for respiratory failure. It may avoid the need for intubation, reduce the pathophysiological consequences of positive airway pressure ventilation, and aid extubation.\r"

The overall response rate was 72%, varying from 62% to 83% according to status and from 61% to 80% according to specialty. Although most of the 226 senior house officer respondents were aged 28 or under (168/225), had been qualified for four years or less (168/225) and were British (176/223), a quarter were older and had been qualified for five years or more; in all, 17 other nationalities were represented. Twenty two were aged over 33, and 17 had been qualified for more than 10 years. Thirty five senior house officers worked more than the mode of the distribution of duty rotas (one in three). Among postgraduate qualifications achieved or pursued, those related to general practice were highly represented (164 examinations); 111 senior house officers intended becoming general practitioners, 63 non-teaching hospital consultants, and 34 university or NHS teaching staff. Analysis of career progression showed that an appreciable number (31/221) had had more than three senior house officer posts. The findings indicate that the main implications for training and education are time for study, careers advice, and revision of educational programmes.\r"

  ".W": "Aspects of teaching and learning at senior house officer level in South East Thames region were investigated by analysis of the responses of consultants, senior registrars, registrars, and senior house officers to a postal questionnaire. Responses to sections about who teaches senior house officers, how senior house officers learn, and the relation between the service and training elements of these posts varied significantly, according to the status of the respondents; certain grades commonly overestimated their own contribution when compared with the estimates of the other grades. Although the replies of senior house officers showed that they were taught by various grades, 47% of this group did not regard the consultant as their main teacher. Senior registrars and registrars rather than consultants were regarded by senior house officers as best at teaching (63% v 48% respectively). Consultants and registrars were considered to require more commitment to training, personal educational training, and to be more approachable. Inquiry about teaching methods used most by senior house officers showed absence of a systematic approach to training. Only about half of senior house officers cited ward rounds with consultants. Views on the relation between training and service were significantly different among grades, but there was general dissatisfaction. Overall, the findings disclosed the ineffectiveness of senior house officer training posts. This arises from lack of a clear distinction between training and service elements, of educational training for teachers, of a clear contractual obligation to teach im the consultant grade, and of allotted time for training and study for the teachers and senior house officers respectively. Reversal of these current trends is needed for senior house officer posts to fulfil their main training function.\r"

Intensive care level 1 (as defined by the British Paediatric Association and British Association for Perinatal Paediatrics) was determined by two separate techniques, which showed close agreement. Intensive care level 2 could not be measured directly, as the definition was too subjective. This aspect of demand was therefore estimated by using data derived from the treatment of babies transferred for intensive care. These findings represent a minimum estimate of need, as the data were obtained from a service constrained by having facilities well below the estimated level (roughly 60% of estimated demand). In the future other factors such as increased survival of extremely preterm infants will be likely to increase demand still further.\r"

DESIGN--Randomised case-control study with a minimum follow up of one year, comparing patients treated with drugs alone with those treated with additional needle aspiration. SETTING--Referral based gastroenterology clinic. PATIENTS--39 Consecutive patients with amoebic liver abscess in the right lobe, of whom 37 completed the study. INTERVENTION--Metronidazole 2.4 g/day was given to all patients for 10 days. Needle aspiration of the abscess was performed in 19 patients on the day of admission to hospital. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Abdominal pain, fever, anorexia, and hepatomegaly were measured. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum aspartate, and alanine aminotransferase activities, and alkaline phosphatase activity were also measured. RESULTS--Clinical improvement was similar in both groups of patients. Improvement in haematological and biochemical variables and rates of healing of cavities were also similar. CONCLUSIONS--Chemotherapy with potent tissue amoebicidal drugs such as metronidazole is optimally effective in treating amoebic liver abscess, and in uncomplicated cases routine aspiration is not required.\r"

DESIGN--Pathological and neuropathological findings at necropsy were compared in haemophiliacs and non-haemophiliacs, most of them homosexual men. SETTING--Necropsies performed in the south of England. SUBJECTS--11 Haemophiliacs (mean age 41, range 15-69) and 31 non-haemophiliacs, 29 of whom were homosexual men (mean age 40, range 21-60). AIDS was diagnosed before death in four haemophiliacs and all but one of the non-haemophiliacs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Prevalence of various forms of neuropathology and systemic pathology in the haemophiliacs and non-haemophiliacs, compared with Fisher's exact test. RESULTS--The prevalences of opportunistic infections of the central nervous system were significantly higher in the non-haemophiliacs (cerebral toxoplasmosis 23% (7), progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy 10% (3), and cerebral cytomegalovirus infection 19% (6) in the non-haemophiliacs v no cases in the haemophiliacs). The prevalences of fresh and old intracranial haemorrhages and cirrhosis of the liver were significantly higher in the haemophiliacs (fresh intracranial haemorrhage 45% (5), old intracranial haemorrhage 36% (4), and cirrhosis of the liver 27% (3) in the haemophiliacs v no cases in the non-haemophiliacs). The prevalence of neuropathological changes in the non-haemophiliacs was similar to that found in other necropsy series. CONCLUSIONS--The main causes of death in haemophiliacs positive for HIV included intracranial haemorrhage and cirrhosis of the liver. The haemophiliacs died when the characteristic neuropathological changes associated with HIV infection were at a fairly early stage in their development.\r"

DESIGN--Randomised double blind placebo controlled trial. SETTING--General practices in the south east of The Netherlands. PATIENTS--327 Non-pregnant female patients aged 12 to 65. INTERVENTION--161 Women were allocated to three days' treatment (co-trimoxazole 960 mg twice a day), and 166 women were allocated to seven days' treatment (co-trimoxazole 960 mg twice a day). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Resolution of symptoms at one, two, and six weeks. RESULTS--The rates for resolution of symptoms were not significantly different between the two groups. Cumulative rates of recurrence after three days' and seven days' treatment were 31/139 (22%) and 23/151 (15%) respectively six weeks after entry (p = 0.16). Adverse effects occurred in a quarter of women given three days' treatment compared with a third of women receiving seven days' treatment (p = 0.29). In only two patients did adverse effects necessitate stopping treatment. CONCLUSIONS--Three days of co-trimoxazole seems to be as effective as a seven days' course for treating acute urinary tract infection in non-pregnant women.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective study of at least 5000 self referred women without symptoms of ovarian cancer. Each woman was scheduled to undergo three annual screenings (consisting of one or more scans) to detect grossly abnormal ovaries or non-regressing masses. SETTING--The ovarian screening clinic at King's College Hospital, London. SUBJECTS--5479 Self referred women without symptoms (aged 18-78, mean age 52). INTERVENTIONS--Women with a positive result on screening were referred for laparoscopy or laparotomy, or both. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Findings at surgery and from histology of abnormal ovaries. RESULTS--A total of 14,594 screenings (15,977 scans) were performed. A positive result was obtained at 338 screens (2.3%) comprising 326 subjects (5.9%). Five patients with primary ovarian cancer (four stage Ia, one stage Ib; two at first screening three at second) were identified (prevalence 0.09%). An additional four patients had metastatic ovarian cancer (three at first screening, one at second). The apparent detection rate was 100%. It was not possible to differentiate between the ultrasonic appearance of early malignant and benign tumours. The rate of false positive results for primary ovarian cancer was 3.5% at the first screening, 1.8% at the second, and 1.2% at the third. Overall the rate of false positive results was 2.3%; the specificity was 97.7% and the predictive value of a positive result on screening was 1.5%. The odds that a positive result on screening indicated the presence of an ovarian tumour, any ovarian cancer, or primary ovarian cancer were about one to two, one to 37, and one to 67 respectively. CONCLUSION--Ultrasonography can be used to screen women without symptoms for persistent ovarian masses that will include early ovarian cancer.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To assess whether changes in the intraovarian vasculature or blood flow impedance can be used to identify potentially malignant masses. DESIGN--Open, non-comparative prospective study. SETTING--Ovarian screening clinics at King's College Hospital and the Hallam Medical Centre. SUBJECTS--50 Women selected on the basis of their medical history and the result of a previous transvaginal ultrasound scan. Thirty women (10 premenopausal (scan taken on days 1 to 8 of the menstrual cycle) and 20 postmenopausal) had normal ovaries, and 20 had at least one ovary with an abnormal morphology or volume, or both. INTERVENTIONS--Women with a positive result on screening were referred for laparotomy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Presence or absence of coloured areas (neovascularisation) and the pulsatility index within each ovary. The pulsatility index is a measure of the impedance to blood flow, a low value indicating decreased impedance and a high value increased impedance to blood flow. RESULTS--Two women with a positive result on screening had hydrosalpinges, 10 a benign tumour or a tumour-like condition, and eight primary ovarian cancers. No areas of neovascularisation were seen in the 30 women with morphologically normal ovaries and the two patients with hydrosalpinges; the pulsatility index ranged from 3.1 to 9.4. Similarly, nine patients (10 affected ovaries) with a non-malignant mass had no signs of neovascularisation and the pulsatility index varied from 3.2 to 7.0. One patient with bilateral dermoid cysts containing nests of thyroid-like cells had vascular changes and pulsatility index values of 0.4 and 0.8. Seven patients (eight ovaries) with primary ovarian cancer (one stage IV, four stage II, and two stage Ia) showed clear evidence of neovascularisation and pulsatility index values were from 0.3 to 1.0. One patient with an intraepithelial serous cystadenocarcinoma in a small ovary (less than 5 ml volume) had no signs of any vascular change and the pulsatility index was 5.5. CONCLUSION--Transvaginal colour flow imaging may be used to identify potentially malignant ovarian masses and help elucidate the early stages of tumorigenesis. The routine application of this technique may reduce the rate of false positive results of an ultrasonography based screening procedure.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To investigate the incidence of difficulties associated with parental presence during the induction of anaesthesia in children and the influence of premedication with special reference to vomiting after papaveretum. DESIGN--Mixed factual and multiple choice questionnaire completed by medical and nursing staff and parents during and after admission. SETTING--Teaching hospital with regional paediatric general surgical unit where parental presence during induction of anaesthesia is long established. PATIENTS--151 Children aged 1-14 years who had not previously undergone surgery attending with parents for day stay general surgical procedures. INTERVENTION--Children were randomly allocated to receive no premedication (group 1), oral diazepam elixir (0.3 mg/kg) (group 2), or intramuscular papaveretum with hyoscine (0.3 mg/kg with 0.006 mg/kg) (group 3). No other modification to established day stay routine was made. RESULTS--No major problems were associated with the presence of parents during the induction of anaesthesia. Only 10 of the 141 parents who accompanied their child caused some difficulty, and five became distressed. Premedication with both diazepam and papaveretum resulted in sedation but did not ease induction of anaesthesia. Papaveretum greatly reduced pain and distress immediately after the operation, pain and discomfort being observed in only 15% of children (7/48) compared with 66% (27/41) in group 1 and 49% (22/45) in group 2. Papaveretum, however, must be given intramuscularly, and nurses observed that the children preferred being given premedication orally to intramuscularly. In addition, the incidences of nausea and vomiting were significantly higher in the postoperative ward and at home with papaveretum, although no patient who had been given the drug was nauseous or vomited in the recovery area. The incidences of nausea in group 3 were 62% (31/50) and 57% (27/47) in the postoperative ward and at home, respectively, v 21% (7/33) and 14% (4/29) in group 1 and 13% (5/38) and 14% (5/37) in group 2; the incidences of vomiting in group 3 were 60% and 43% in the postoperative ward and at home, respectively, v 18% and 7% in group 1 and 11% and 11% in group 2. Finally, neither the administration or otherwise of premedication nor the drug given affected the children's or parents' perception of day care surgery. CONCLUSIONS--Difficulties with parents in anaesthetic rooms were not common or severe. Premedication provides preoperative sedation and papaveretum improves the immediate postoperative course but the incidences of nausea and vomiting after operation are higher with its use than without.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To reduce the psychological stress and improve the skills in coping of people who care for relatives with dementia. DESIGN--Assessment and suitability of carers by questionnaire; assessment of patients and carers in a hospital outpatient clinic; allocation to groups according to date of application to study. Linkage of groups of four carers and programme coordinator by telephone conference calls over 12 months after programmes. Reassessment at three, six, 12, and, for those in the \"wait list\" group, 18 months. SETTING--The programmes were conducted in the psychiatry unit of a Sydney teaching hospital. SUBJECTS--Eligible patients were less than 80 years old, had mild to moderate dementia, and lived at home with their carer. Of the 96 patient-carer pairs in the study, 33 were in the dementia carers' programme group, 31 were in the memory retraining group, and 32 were in the wait list group. INTERVENTIONS--Carers in the dementia carers' programme received training in coping with the difficulties of looking after patients with dementia while the patients had sessions in subjects such as memory retraining. In the memory retraining programme patients were admitted and received the patient component of the carers' programme while their carers had 10 days' respite. In the wait list group carers waited six months before undertaking the carers' programme. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Effect of the programmes on carers' general health questionnaire scores and the rate of placement of patients in institutions. RESULTS--At 12 months' follow up the carers' programme had resulted in significantly lower psychological stress among carers than the memory retraining programme (mean (SD) general health questionnaire scores at 0 months were 6.31 (6.23) and 3.60 (6.25) respectively, and at 12 months were 4.69 (5.58) and 7.40 (9.39); p less than 0.05.) In the wait list group distress scores remained stable, even after the carers and patients had undertaken the carers' programme. Patients deteriorated over 12 months regardless of group allocation, but at 30 months, allowing for patients who died and could not be included in the analysis, 65% of patients in the carers' programme group were still living at home compared with 26% in the memory retraining programme group. CONCLUSION--The intensive intervention programme described for carers of patients with dementia can reduce the psychological morbidity of the carer and delay the placement of the patient in an institution without increasing the use of health services by either patient or carer.\r"

SETTING--Liverpool Maternity Hospital. PATIENTS--190 Pregnant women were transferred to the hospital under the in utero transfer arrangements from district general hospitals both within and outside the Mersey region. The women admitted were divided into two categories: those in threatened or established uncomplicated preterm labour and those who may or may not have been in threatened or established preterm labour but who had coexisting complicating factors affecting the mother or fetus, or both. INTERVENTIONS--Planned delivery of the fetus if indicated and arrangements for appropriate postpartum care of the mother. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Assessment of the progress of labour and, if appropriate, resuscitation of the mother. RESULTS--Women who were transferred with no coexisting disease (124) had relatively uncomplicated deliveries whereas those transferred with coexisting diseases (66) exhibited considerable morbidity and 17 of these required prolonged intensive monitoring after delivery. CONCLUSIONS--In utero transfer in healthy mothers may have benefits for babies born very prematurely. If mothers have coexisting disease, however, the desirability of transfer should be reviewed urgently in the light of the considerable maternal morbidity associated with these problems. In these cases transfer may introduce an additional hazard.\r"

Most experience is with streptokinase, although newer agents such as recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rTPA) may offer more effective lysis with reduced complications. We have reviewed the experience documented in 19 prospective series published between 1974 and 1988 in an attempt to define the incidence of stroke, major haemorrhage and minor haemorrhage. The overall risk of stroke was 1.0 per cent of patients (14 cases). Major haemorrhage occurred in 5.1 per cent of patients (71 cases) and minor haemorrhage occurred in 14.8 per cent (92 out of 620 cases). There was little difference between the two thrombolytic agents, although the experience with lower doses of rTPA suggests it may offer a reduced risk of haemorrhagic complications. It is essential that all studies concerning thrombolysis should give their exclusion and inclusion criteria in full to allow an accurate appraisal of haemorrhagic complications, with the hope of improved patient selection and reduced morbidity in the future.\r"

The standard first line hormonal treatment for systemic breast cancer in postmenopausal women is tamoxifen. The combination of goserelin and tamoxifen in premenopausal women has been proposed. We have treated 34 premenopausal breast cancer patients with goserelin (3.6 mg) monthly and tamoxifen (20 mg) twice daily: endocrine data are available on all 34 patients. As with goserelin alone, patients on goserelin and tamoxifen showed transient stimulation of serum follicle stimulating hormone over the first 7-10 days with subsequent low gonadotrophin levels. Serum oestradiol and progesterone levels were reduced to castrate levels in all patients studied; no peaks of serum oestradiol were detected. There is no endocrinological contraindication to the use of goserelin and tamoxifen together in premenopausal women with breast cancer either as adjuvant therapy or in treating advanced disease.\r"

This study showed that tumour necrosis factor was effective in modifying surgically simulated wound infections when administered both as prophylaxis and as therapy. Two models were used; one was an intramuscular bacterial challenge, and the other involved the use of a bacteria-laden thigh suture. The test bacterium for both models was Klebsiella pneumoniae, a common surgical pathogen in our surgical service. Interferon gamma was an effective biological response modifier in these models. Tumour necrosis factor was more potent than interferon gamma and there was no additive or synergistic effect with interferon gamma. This indicates potentially different mechanisms of action for these two cytokines.\r"

Mean fasting insulin and glucose levels were similar in all groups. After feeding, insulin profiles in both transplant groups were near normal while significant hyperinsulinaemia occurred in insulin treated diabetic dogs. Mild postprandial carbohydrate intolerance was observed in transplant recipients but glycosylated haemoglobin levels were similar (mean(s.d.] to normals (6.88(0.86) per cent, 6.86(0.5) per cent respectively).

  ".W": "The specific benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (Ro 15-1788) (Ro) was given in a double-blind study to 40 adult orthopaedic patients in order to determine if it shortens the immediate recovery time after benzodiazepine-fentanyl anaesthesia. On the evening before operation the patients were premedicated orally with 1-2 mg of flunitrazepam and 30 min before the induction of anaesthesia with 7.5 mg midazolam. Induction of anaesthesia was carried out with flunitrazepam 0.03-0.04 mg.kg-1 and fentanyl 0.1 mg IV. Anaesthesia was maintained with fentanyl (5.9 microgram.kg-1.h-1) and nitrous oxide. After the reversal of muscle relaxation, 20 patients received a placebo and 20 patients Ro, as boluses up to 10 ml, until the effect of awakening was noticed. The dose of Ro (0.1 mg.ml-1) required was 6.8 +/- 2.9 micrograms.kg-1 and that of placebo 10 +/- 0 ml. Patients given Ro woke up faster than patients given placebo. Ro patients were more alert than patients given placebo until 120 min after the injection or the test drug. After this patients in both groups behaved similarly. Eight patients given Ro and one given placebo showed some mild adverse reaction for 5-60 min after the administration of Ro or placebo (e.g., nausea, shivering). This study indicates that flumazenil speeds up awakening after benzodiazepine-fentanyl anaesthesia.\r"

  ".W": "To clarify whether or not tachycardia stimulates the secretion of atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP) without elevation of atrial pressure, we examined the effects of atrial pacing on ANP secretion in awake dogs with normal sinus rhythm and with complete atrioventricular block (CAVB), which was produced surgically by heat cauterization of His' bundle. In four dogs with normal sinus rhythm, atrial pacing increased the atrial rate from 146 +/- 20 to 260 +/- 10 beats/min, with marked elevation of right atrial pressure (from 0.2 +/- 0.1 to 3.9 +/- 0.8 mm Hg) and left atrial pressure (from 0.2 +/- 0.1 to 8.6 +/- 2.8 mm Hg). Along with the hemodynamic changes, the ANP level in plasma obtained from the coronary sinus was increased from 405 +/- 99 to 849 +/- 199 pg/ml (p less than 0.01). In five dogs with CAVB, the ANP level was also significantly increased from 730 +/- 82 to 1,137 +/- 35 pg/ml (p less than 0.01) by rapid atrial pacing (from 164 +/- 20 to 317 +/- 30 beats/min) in spite of the lack of any appreciable changes in either left or right atrial pressure. Furthermore, in the CAVB group, while the ventricular rate was increased by ventricular pacing from 52 +/- 5 to 146 +/- 16 beats/min, atrial pacing was performed simultaneously without atrioventricular (A-V) sequential form. Even under this condition, the ANP level was increased from 480 +/- 172 to 626 +/- 223 pg/ml (p less than 0.05) without any substantial changes in atrial pressure. Such effects of rapid atrial pacing on ANP secretion were suppressed after infusion of autonomic blocking agents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Hypertension of 10-week duration caused a twofold increase in the left ventricular weight/body weight ratio, a significant increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and an eightfold increase in left ventricular ANP mRNA levels in RHRs, as compared with the levels in control rats. Uninephrectomy or 4 weeks of treatment with the converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril reduced the blood pressure to the control level, with the complete reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and ANP mRNA levels. Four weeks of treatment with the arterial vasodilator hydralazine significantly, but not completely, reduced the high blood pressure, but it did not influence left ventricular hypertrophy, end-diastolic pressure, and ANP mRNA levels. The increased ANP synthesis observed in the right ventricles of RHRs also reverted to the control level by uninephrectomy or enalapril treatment, but not by hydralazine, with a time course similar to that of left ventricular ANP. In addition, uninephrectomy caused the left and right ventricular ANP and ANP mRNA levels of RHRs to fall to the levels of control rats as early as 1 week, despite persistent left ventricular hypertrophy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effects of hemostatic substances on the vascular tone in porcine coronary arteries and the influence of low density lipoprotein on tension were investigated. Thrombin induced a marked concentration-dependent relaxation in prostaglandin F2 alpha-precontracted strips with intact endothelium, whereas it produced a modest constriction in endothelium-denuded arteries. Methylene blue abolished the relaxation, but indomethacin did not affect it significantly. An exposure of the intact strips to low density lipoprotein resulted in a marked inhibition of the relaxation to thrombin but did not interfere with vasodilation by sodium nitroprusside. The inhibition by low density lipoprotein was reversed completely by washing. In contrast, high density lipoprotein lacked such inhibitory effects. Adenosine diphosphate, calcium ionophore A23187, and platelet-activating factor also produced relaxation in the intact strips. An exposure of the strips to low density lipoprotein almost abolished relaxation to these substances. The inhibition was also reversible. Heat treatment or acid treatment of low density lipoprotein resulted in a complete loss of the inhibitory effects, but diisopropyl fluorophosphate treatment did not alter the effect. It is concluded that low density lipoprotein may play a new pathological role in promotion of coronary vasospasm through rapid and reversible inhibition in endothelium-dependent relaxation to hemostatic substances.\r"

Oxidative deamination of allylamine to a highly toxic aldehyde, acrolein, was blocked through enzyme inhibition by semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase suggests that this vascular enzyme's physiological role may include metabolism of exogenous amines.\r"

  ".W": "To assess how polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) act on coronary vasoactivity, we measured the changes in isometric tension of isolated rings of canine coronary arteries upon addition of autologous PMNs to organ chambers in which the rings were suspended. When PMNs isolated by the colloidal polyvinylpyrrolidone-coated silica (Percoll) gradient method were added to the chambers, ring preparations of left circumflex coronary arteries developed isometric tension. The increase in tension was dependent on the amount of PMNs (1 X 10(4) to 5 X 10(6) cells/ml). Maximal tension obtained by an optimal amount of PMNs (5 X 10(5) cells/ml) was almost comparable to that produced by prostaglandin F2 alpha (5 microM). Integrity of endothelial cells was not disrupted after the addition of PMNs because the developed tension could be reversed by the addition of acetylcholine in an endothelium-dependent manner. Mechanical rubbing of endothelium abolished the PMN-induced vasoconstriction, which was regained by placing an endothelium-unrubbed ring inside a rubbed ring (\"sandwich preparation\"). When PMN suspensions were pretreated with 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors of arachidonate, PMN-induced vasoconstriction was greatly suppressed, although the pretreatment of vascular preparations did not alter the development of isometric tension. These findings indicate that PMNs induce the contraction of coronary arterial rings in the presence of intact endothelial cells. The mechanism by which PMNs induce the contraction is the release of vasoconstrictive substances by metabolic interaction between PMNs and endothelial cells. Vasoconstrictive substances produced by the PMN-endothelial system, such as 5-lipoxygenase metabolites through a \"leukotriene A4 steal\" mechanism, may contribute to the contraction of vascular smooth muscle.\r"

Mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, and renal blood flow decreased during tachycardia while right and left atrial pressures increased. ANF markedly increased during tachycardia but urinary and fractional excretion of sodium were unchanged from control. Plasma renin activity was not increased during pacing despite the decrease in renal perfusion pressure. After tachycardia and restoration of mean arterial pressure to control, ANF declined but remained elevated above control despite a return of atrial pressure to control level. After tachycardia, urinary and fractional sodium excretion increased significantly in the absence of an increase in glomerular filtration rate. These findings support the following conclusions: 1) tachycardia increases ANF in association with increased atrial pressure; however, an elevation of ANF persists following tachycardia despite the absence of the persistent stimulus of elevated atrial pressures; 2) the increase in ANF during tachycardia may contribute to the absence of a decrease in sodium excretion and activation of the renin-angiotensin system that occurs with reduction in renal perfusion pressure; and 3) tachycardia-induced natriuresis may be dependent on an increase in ANF and the maintenance of renal perfusion pressure.\r"

  ".W": "Thromboxane (TXA2), a potent proaggregatory and vasoconstricting eicosanoid, is produced at a very low rate and is cleared rapidly from the human circulation. Its chemically stable hydration product, TXB2, is extensively metabolized through dehydrogenation of the hemiacetal alcohol group at C-11 and beta-oxidation, resulting in the formation of two main enzymatic derivatives (i.e., 11-dehydro-TXB2 and 2,3-dinor-TXB2). A large discrepancy exists between the platelet biosynthetic capacity and actual TXA2 production in vivo. This has both methodological and pathophysiological relevance. Platelet synthesis of TXA2 can be reduced by cyclooxygenase and thromboxane-synthase inhibitors. Furthermore, the platelet and vascular actions of TXA2 can be antagonized by prostaglandin H2/TXA2-receptor antagonists. The combined administration of a thromboxane-synthase inhibitor and a TXA2-receptor antagonist gives stronger inhibition of platelet aggregation and prolongs bleeding time more than either drug alone or acetylsalicylic acid. Finally, TXA2-dependent glomerular damage, as seen in lupus nephritis, might represent a unique therapeutic target for receptor antagonists and/or tissue-selective synthase inhibitors.\r"

However, this premise has yet to be proven clinically. The historical development of thromboxane receptor blockers as a new class of medicines and, in particular, that of GR32191, are described here. The clinical evaluation of GR32191 should determine the importance of thromboxane A2 in cardiovascular disease.\r"

This was a double-blind crossover study with randomized placebo and omeprazole treatments. Blood was collected up to 120 hours after diazepam dosing (still during one-daily omeprazole and placebo administration) for measurement of diazepam and its major metabolite desmethyldiazepam. The slow metabolizers of omeprazole also metabolized diazepam slowly, exhibiting only half the diazepam plasma clearance of the others. The mean clearance of diazepam was decreased 26% after omeprazole in the rapid metabolizers, whereas the slow group showed no apparent interaction. The mean plasma concentrations of desmethyldiazepam showed a more rapid formation in the rapid compared with the slow metabolizers, which is a logical consequence of the rate of diazepam metabolism.\r"

Using arterial and selective venous catheterization and sampling, and measurement of regional organ flow, we measured haemodynamics, cardiac secretion of ANP and renal clearance of ANP in six healthy volunteers at rest, on a normal sodium diet. 2. Salt restriction decreases plasma concentrations of ANP. We assessed the contribution of the heart and kidney to this decrease, by measuring cardiac secretion and renal clearance of ANP at the termination of a low salt diet. 3. Twenty-four hour urinary sodium excretion fell on the low salt diet from 163 to 29 mmol/day [standard error of the difference (SED)+/- 14, P less than 0.001]. Body weight decreased on salt restriction from 76.4 to 75.4 kg (SED +/- 0.33, P less than 0.05). Brachial mean arterial pressure fell by 6% (P less than 0.05), but right atrial pressure was unchanged. Renal vein plasma renin activity increased by 56% with sodium restriction (P less than 0.01), whereas arterial ANP concentrations fell by 39% (P less than 0.05). 4. Coronary sinus ANP levels fell from 417 to 268 pg/ml (SED +/- 74, P less than 0.05), whereas renal vein concentrations were unaltered. There was a 47% decrease in cardiac secretion of ANP in the low salt state (P less than 0.05). Net extraction of ANP across the kidney (about two-thirds) and renal clearance of ANP were unchanged on the low salt diet. Thus decreased plasma ANP with sodium restriction is due to reduced cardiac secretion.\r"

We interviewed 30 Veterans Administration intensive care unit patients to determine their preferences for resuscitation, resuscitation requiring mechanical ventilation, artificial hydration and nutrition, and hospitalization for treatment of pneumonia. Patients expressed their preferences considering their current health and then two hypothetical scenarios, stroke and dementia. Follow-up interviews occurred one month later to assess preference stability. We found a diversity of opinions about life-sustaining treatments. Despite significant changes in health status and mood (p less than 0.05), treatment preferences were stable over time (kappa = .35-.70). Our results suggest that life-sustaining treatment preferences solicited during a serious illness are reliable and may be used in decision-making when a patient becomes unable to communicate or is mentally incapacitated.\r"

  ".W": "For subjects with EIA participating in physical activities throughout the day, prolonged duration of protection is desirable. The purpose of this study was to determine whether in EIA a combination of the recommended aerosol doses of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor agonist, terbutaline sulfate (0.5 mg), and cromolyn sodium (disodium cromoglycate; 2 mg) provides longer protection against EIA than either drug alone. On four separate days, following the administration of either placebo, terbutaline alone, cromolyn sodium alone or terbutaline and cromolyn sodium together, 12 subjects (seven men and five women; aged 18 to 28 years) with EIA performed four identical eight minute treadmill runs, each separated by two-hour intervals. Drug treatments were given double-blind, with the order counterbalanced using a Latin-square design. Pulmonary function was recorded before the drug, immediately before and after exercise, and at 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 15, and 30 minutes after exercise. Inspired ventilation, heart rate, and environmental conditions were monitored during exercise. A two-way analysis of variance was performed to investigate the main effects of time and drug treatment. Results indicated that in comparison with placebo, EIA was significantly reduced by either cromolyn sodium or terbutaline administered up to two hours (p less than 0.01) and by the combination (cromolyn sodium and terbutaline) up to four hours after inhalation (p less than 0.05). No significant differences were found between the combination and terbutaline during the initial two hours (p less than 0.5). We conclude that a combination of beta 2-adrenergic receptor agonist and cromolyn sodium is the treatment of choice for prolonged effective protection from EIA.\r"

The nocturnal use of NIPPV is explored in combination with other noninvasive methods of supported ventilation for daytime support as alternatives to tracheostomy and long-term tracheostomy intermittent positive pressure ventilation (TIPPV). Sixteen patients with less than 400 ml of vital capacity (VC) supine and less than 15 minutes of autonomous respiration (free time) maintained a mean SaO2 of 95.9 +/- 2.6 percent (SD) during sleep on NIPPV without added oxygen. Seventeen other patients with adequate free time for a sleep trial unaided had an average SaO2 of 81.8 +/- 11.0 percent which improved to 94.1 +/- 3.4 percent on NIPPV alone. The average length of use of NIPPV by the 42 patients who have used it for one month or more is 21 (3-67) months. All 34 patients who were not dependent on ventilatory support 24 hours a day demonstrated significant improvement and in most cases normalization of ABG when off aid. Thirteen patients were converted from IPPV via an endotracheal tube or TIPPV to NIPPV. Long-term use of a custom molded thermoplastic nasal interface for the delivery of NIPPV is reported for 17 patients. Unnecessary morbidity and hospitalizations can be avoided by early awareness and appropriate management of CAH. NIPPV can be an effective alternative to TIPPV, body ventilators, or oxygen therapy.\r"

After one to three months of nocturnal use averaging 8 h, mean daytime PaCO2 fell from 63 +/- 2 to 45 +/- 3 mm Hg. At late follow-up, PaCO2 remained stable at 47 +/- 4 mm Hg, but vital capacity fell 33 percent compared with the initial value and the average duration of ventilator use had increased to 18 +/- 2 h daily. Three patients died and five survived; two continued using negative pressure ventilators and three had tracheostomies placed for administration of positive pressure ventilation. We conclude that noninvasive intermittent ventilatory assistance effectively reverses hypoventilation and symptoms in patients with late-stage Duchenne muscular dystrophy, but pulmonary function continues to deteriorate necessitating longer periods of ventilation, and often tracheostomy, within a few years.\r"

Eighty-nine (43 percent) used a PEG lavage, eight (4 percent) used mannitol, and one physician used a saline lavage method. Almost all the responding surgeons believed that their method of preparation was well tolerated by patients, provided good cleansing, and was associated with few complications. Most patients were admitted one day before surgery. All respondents used perioperative antibiotics, with the most common pattern being a combination of oral and parenteral agents. Surgeons using PEG lavage did more colonic resections per month and were fewer years out of their residency. This current pattern of preoperative bowel preparation has changed from previous surveys.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of rioprostil, a methylprostaglandin E1 analog on circulating pancreatic hormones was evaluated in 13 healthy male subjects. Rioprostil administration, 300 micrograms twice daily resulted in a significant decrease of fasting insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, and pancreatic polypeptide. No change in fasting plasma glucose or somatostatin levels was observed. An oral glucose tolerance test induced similar increments in plasma glucose concentration before and during treatment, but a delayed rise of insulin and C-peptide levels occurred during the administration of the drug. On rioprostil, the glucose load no longer inhibited peripheral glucagon or somatostatin. Treatment with rioprostil remained without effect on mixed meal-induced changes in plasma glucose levels and concomitant increases in insulin, pancreatic polypeptide, and somatostatin levels. It is concluded that in healthy individuals rioprostil influences the basal and glucose-induced levels of glucagon, insulin, and somatostatin. In healthy men this effect did not, however, result in glucose intolerance.\r"

The ulcers, which were observed with an endoscope, were found to undergo periods of decrease, healing and exacerbation during the rat's lifetime. The phases were categorized as follows: (1) the reduction period (days 3-50 after ulcer induction, corresponding to 7-14 weeks of age), (2) healing period (days 35-150 after ulcer induction, corresponding to 12-29 weeks of age), (3) first exacerbation period (days 35-231 after ulcer induction, corresponding to 12-40 weeks of age), (4) inactive period (days 231-365 after ulcer induction, corresponding to 40-60 weeks of age), and (5) second exacerbation period (days 365-550 after ulcer induction, corresponding to 60-86 weeks of age). In normal rats, the level of gastric mucosal PGI2 gradually increased with aging between 7 and 20 weeks, then decreased up to 40 weeks. The PGI2 level in the 60-week-old rat did not differ from that in the 40-week-old rat. The PGI2 level was the lowest in the 86-week-old rat. In ulcer-bearing rats, the PGI2 level showed the same pattern of change as that in normal rats, but the level was higher. The above results indicated a marked decrease in PGI2 level between 20 and 40 weeks of age and between 60 and 86 weeks of age in normal and ulcer-bearing rats. These periods corresponded closely to the first and second exacerbation periods, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The GnRH-a leuprolide acetate was administered to all patients beginning in the midluteal phase of the prior cycle and continuing until the day of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration. There were no significant differences between hMG and FSH cycles with regard to the day of hCG administration, mean peak estradiol levels, number of ampules of medication used, and number of oocytes aspirated, embryos transferred, or pregnancies. We conclude that there is no significant difference between hMG and FSH stimulation when used in conjunction with GnRH-a.\r"

A significant decreased ovarian gradient was found for IGF-II but not for IGF-I or insulin. Although there was no significant ovarian vein insulin gradient, insulin levels were higher in follicular than in luteal phase ovarian samples. These data suggest that IGF-II may be locally regulated by the ovary. Both insulin and IGFs may regulate ovarian function in vivo.\r"

The patients were allocated on the transfer day to either luteal phase supplementation with hCG (Group A, n = 18) or none (Group B, n = 18). Nine patients of Group A conceived as compared with 3 in Group B. Five patients, all in Group A, developed ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) (3 moderate and 2 severe forms). Analysis of the hormonal profiles disclosed similar progesterone (P), estradiol (E2), and E2/P ratio up to the 6th post ovum pick-up day. Then, E2 and mainly P levels decreased only in Group B resulting in a rising E2/P ratio. These findings stress the importance of luteal support in IVF cycles treated with GnRH-a. In light of the increased risk of OHSS among hCG treated patients, further studies are needed to assess the optimal preparation needed.\r"

TRH stimulates gastric, intestinal, and colonic contractility in rats and in several experimental species. A number of peptides including calcitonin, CGRP, neurotensin, NPY, and mu opioid peptides act centrally to induce a fasted MMC pattern of intestinal motility in fed animals while GRF and substance P shorten its duration. The dorsal vagal complex is site of action for TRH-, bombesin-, and somatostatin-induced stimulation of gastric contractility, and for CCK-, oxytocin- and substance P-induced decrease in gastric contractions or intraluminal pressure. The mechanisms through which TRH, bombesin, calcitonin, neurotensin, CCK, and oxytocin alter GI motility are vagally mediated. An involvement of central peptidergic neurons in the regulation of gut motility has recently been demonstrated in Aplysia, indicating that such regulatory mechanisms are important in the phylogenesis. Alterations of the pattern of GI motor activity are associated with functional changes in transit. TRH is so far the only centrally acting peptide stimulating simultaneously gastric, intestinal, and colonic transit in various animals species. Opioid peptides acting on mu receptor subtypes in the brain exert the opposite effect and inhibit concomitantly gastric, intestinal, and colonic transit. Bombesin and CRF were found to act centrally to inhibit gastric and intestinal transit and to stimulate colonic transit in the rat. The antitransit effect of calcitonin and CGRP is limited to the stomach and small intestine. The delay in GI transit is associated with reduced GI contractility for most of the peptides except central bombesin that increases GI motility. Nothing is known about brain sites through which these peptides act to alter gastric emptying and colonic transit. Regarding brain sites influencing intestinal transit, TRH-induced stimulation of intestinal transit in the rat is localized in the lateral and medial hypothalamus and medial septum. The periaqueductal gray matter is a responsive site for mu receptor agonist- and neurotensin-induced inhibition of intestinal transit. The neural pathways from the brain to the gut whereby these peptides express their stimulatory or inhibitory effects on GI transit is vagal dependent with the exception of calcitonin. It is not known whether the vagally mediated inhibition of GI transit by these peptides results from a decrease activity of vagal preganglionic fibers synapsing with excitatory myenteric neurons or an activation of vagal preganglionic neurons synapsing with inhibitory myenteric neurons. The lack of specific antagonists for these peptides has hampered the assessment of their physiological role.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Physicians must have knowledge of the nursing home environment, medical problems common in nursing home patients, and basic aspects of care required in the elderly. While the medical director of a nursing home must set and maintain the standard of care, attending physicians need to understand the clinically relevant differences between young and old people, be skilled in geriatric assessment, prescribe medications knowledgeably and with restraint, respond promptly to changes in the patient's status, and carefully document medical observations and care plans.\r"
