We have reviewed a group of 27 patients up to 14 years (median 62 months) after diagnosis; 18 of these were re-examined after an average of nearly 4 years (median 45 months). The condition was more common in non-insulin-dependent diabetics (88 per cent), in men (59 per cent) and in older patients (median age at diagnosis 64 years). The neuropathy was bilateral (10 cases) or unilateral (17 cases); five patients with unilateral neuropathy developed femoral neuropathy on the opposite side, usually within a few weeks of the first episode. Recovery was apparent after 3 months and usually complete by 18 months; only two of the 27 patients had severe relapses. No patients remained disabled, although there were minor residual symptoms and signs in half of the patients (2 cm reduction in thigh circumference and diminished reflexes). The outlook for femoral neuropathy, even in its most severe form, is therefore very good: residual features are demonstrable but do not cause symptoms, and relapses after the first few weeks are very rare.\r"

In 34 dialysis patients who underwent total parathyroidectomy with an autograft there was a high rate of recurrent hyperparathyroidism after 6 years in those remaining on dialysis. Fifty per cent had asymptomatic recurrent hyperparathyroidism and 30 per cent required partial autograft excision for symptomatic hyperparathyroidism. In contrast, recurrent hyperparathyroidism was rare in renal transplant recipients with good renal function. This favourable outcome did not depend upon whether parathyroid surgery was performed before or after transplantation, or on the type of parathyroidectomy. Total parathyroidectomy without an autograft was performed in nine dialysis patients without any short-term adverse effects, and with clinical and pathological improvement in bone disease. In summary, the results of surgery for renal hyperparathyroidism were excellent in patients who received a successful renal transplant. However, there was a high incidence of recurrent hyperparathyroidism in patients who remained on long-term dialysis. Total parathyroidectomy without an autograft may be the treatment of choice in patients unlikely to receive a renal transplant.\r"

These cases were divided into four categories depending on regular or irregular cyclic adrenal hypersecretion and presence or absence of concomitant fluctuations in the clinical course. The manifestations of cyclic adrenal hypersecretion in these patients varied from daily to yearly intervals. Cyclic activity persisted for as long as 25 years, with cycle lengths varying from 12 hours to 85 days. Some patients demonstrated complex biochemical cyclic patterns. Clinical presentations varied from a single outstanding symptom, such as recurring oedema, to a complex clinical syndrome. The aetiology in these patients varied: 12 appeared to be pituitary dependent, 11 had corticotropin-producing tumours and another eight were described as showing 'adrenal hyperplasia'. A hypothalamic disorder was found in four, a benign adrenal adenoma in two, and an adrenal 'mass' and adrenocortical nodular dysplasia in single patients. Evaluation during the intercyclic phase may reveal normal pituitary function. Inconsistent responsiveness to administration of dexamethasone in different phases of cyclic activities may suggest the presence of cyclic Cushing's syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "A four-year prospective study of the factors predicting albuminuria was carried out in 172 normotensive, insulin-dependent diabetic patients without overt nephropathy. Urinary albumin excretion was estimated as the urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (UA/UC) in an early morning sample. Multivariate analysis showed that UA/UC on the return visit was positively associated with the UA/UC (p less than 0.001) and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1; p less than 0.001) at initial examination; weaker associations were found with a history of hospital admission (p less than 0.05) and smoking (p less than 0.05), and with treatment of blood pressure (p less than 0.05). Neither initial blood pressure, heart rate, nor creatinine clearance were significant predictors of the UA/UC. Two patients died from coronary heart disease, both of whom had raised albumin excretion at initial examination. Eleven (6.8 per cent) of the 160 patients who were studied repeatedly developed macroalbuminuria (UA/UC greater than 45.5 mg/mmol): they had a significantly higher initial UA/UC (p less than 0.005), HbA1 (p less than 0.05) and a greater frequency of retinopathy (p less than 0.05) than patients matched for age, sex and duration of diabetes who did not develop macroalbuminuria. Simultaneous measurements of the UA/UC and HbA1 should be used when screening for microalbuminuria in diabetes mellitus: patients with a high UA/UC (e.g. greater than 3.5 mg/mmol) and HbA1 (e.g. greater than 13 per cent) should be closely monitored even when blood pressure is normal.\r"

The participation of five small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) in splicing is now well documented. Genetic analysis in yeast has revealed the requirement, in addition, for several dozen proteins. Some of these are tightly bound to snRNAs to form small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs); such proteins may promote interactions between snRNAs or between an snRNA and the intron. Other, non-snRNP proteins appear to associate transiently with the spliceosome. Some of these factors, which include RNA-dependent adenosine triphosphatases, may promote the accurate recognition of introns.\r"

The environments are described by: (i) the area of the residue buried in the protein and inaccessible to solvent; (ii) the fraction of side-chain area that is covered by polar atoms (O and N); and (iii) the local secondary structure. Examples of this 3D profile method are presented for four families of proteins: the globins, cyclic AMP (adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate) receptor-like proteins, the periplasmic binding proteins, and the actins. This method is able to detect the structural similarity of the actins and 70- kilodalton heat shock proteins, even though these protein families share no detectable sequence similarity.\r"

In patients with Alzheimer's disease, extracellular amyloid plaque core is primarily composed of beta (1-42), whereas cerebrovascular amyloid contains the more soluble beta (1-39). In aqueous trifluoroethanol solution, the beta (1-28), beta (1-39), and beta (1-42) peptides adopt monomeric alpha-helical structures at both low and high pH, whereas at intermediate pH (4 to 7) an oligomeric beta structure (the probable structure in plaques) predominates. Thus, beta peptide is not by itself an insoluble protein (as originally thought), and localized or normal age-related alterations of pH may be necessary for the self-assembly and deposition of beta peptide. The hydrophobic carboxyl-terminal segment, beta(29-42), exists exclusively as an oligomeric beta sheet in solution, regardless of differences in solvent, pH, or temperature, suggesting that this segment directs the folding of the complete beta (1-42) peptide to produce the beta-pleated sheet found in amyloid plaques.\r"

The three polypeptide components of one such system, the 4-chlorobenzoate dehalogenase system, have been isolated, and the chemical steps of the 4-hydroxybenzoate-forming reaction that they catalyze have been identified. The genes contained within a 4.5-kilobase Pseudomonas sp. strain CBS3 chromosomal DNA fragment that encode dehalogenase activity were selectively expressed in transformed Escherichia coli. Oligonucleotide sequencing revealed a stretch of homology between the 57-kilodalton (kD) polypeptide and several magnesium adenosine triphosphate (MgATP)-cleaving enzymes that allowed MgATP and coenzyme A (CoA) to be identified as the dehalogenase cosubstrate and cofactor, respectively. The dehalogenase activity arises from two components, a 4-chlorobenzoate:CoA ligase-dehalogenase (an alpha beta dimer of the 57- and 30-kD polypeptides) and a thioesterase (the 16-kD polypeptide).\r"

The solution structures of the GCAA and GAAA hairpins have been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Both loops contain an unusual G-A base pair between the first and last residue in the loop, a hydrogen bond between a G base and a phosphate, extensive base stacking, and a hydrogen bond between a sugar 2'-end OH and a base. These interactions explain the high stability of these hairpins and the sequence requirements for the variant and invariant nucleotides in the GNRA tetranucleotide loop family.\r"

A search for potential gene regulatory components specifically expressed in the organizer was undertaken that resulted in the identification of four types of complementary DNAs from homeobox-containing genes that fulfill this criterion. The most abundant of these encodes a DNA-binding specificity similar to that of the Drosophila melanogaster anterior morphogen bicoid. The other three are also homologous to developmentally significant Drosophila genes. These four genes may participate in the regulation of the developmental potential of the organizer.\r"

These dwarf mice (dw and dwJ) are deficient in growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL) synthesis and exhibit pituitary hypoplasia, suggesting a stem cell defect. With antisense oligonucleotide technology, a cell culture model of this genetic defect was developed. Specific inhibition of GHF1 synthesis by complementary oligonucleotides led to a marked decrease in GH and PRL expression and to a marked decrease in proliferation of somatotrophic cell lines. These results provide direct evidence that the homeodomain protein GHF1 is required not only for the establishment and maintenance of the differentiated phenotype but for cell proliferation as well.\r"

CFTR in which the R domain was deleted (CFTR delta R) conducted chloride independently of the presence of cAMP. However, sites within CFTR other than those deleted also respond to cAMP, because the chloride current of CFTR delta R increased further in response to cAMP stimulation. In addition, deletion of the R domain suppressed the inactivating effect of a mutation in NBD2 (but not NBD1), a result which suggests that NBD2 interacts with the channel through the R domain.\r"

Of 117 respondents, 81 knew their family history for myocardial infarction and 81 knew their family history for stroke. Of 83 responding 43 reported a personal history of myocardial infarction, and of 85 responding 66 reported a personal history of stroke. As expected, there was an association between positive family and personal histories of myocardial infarction in younger (aged less than 70 years) patients (Fisher's two-tailed exact test, p = 0.014). This association was reversed for stroke (Fisher's two-tailed exact test, p = 0.017). Older (aged greater than or equal to 70 years) patients had a stronger association between positive family and personal histories of stroke; 14 (74%) of 19 older patients with a positive personal history of stroke had a positive family history of stroke. The reason for this reversal in the relation between family and personal histories of stroke compared with myocardial infarction may relate to the older age at onset of most strokes, differing stroke subtypes in older age groups, or lower rates of fatal myocardial infarction. This study suggests that familial factors may be important in some subtypes of cerebrovascular disease. Familial effects may be different in vascular diseases of the heart and brain.\r"

The median delay from the onset of the stroke to the first blood sample (day 0) was 9 (range 4-22) hours. Subsequent blood samples were taken, after fasting, for the determination of blood glucose, cortisol, catecholamine, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, and lactate concentrations on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 30, and 90. For all 23 patients, a significant relation was found between the blood glucose concentration and survival (p = 0.03) and the blood glucose concentration decreased with time (p less than 0.001). There was also a significant relation between blood glucose concentration and outcome (p = 0.02). For the 15 patients with complete data, the major determinants of the blood glucose concentration were the cortisol, insulin, and glucagon concentrations (all p less than 0.001), which accounted for 42% of the variance. When all the indexes were analyzed together by logistic regression, only the cortisol concentration was related to outcome (p = 0.02). Hyperglycemia following a stroke probably reflects the intensity of the stress hormone response. We have confirmed that hyperglycemia is a predictor of outcome in persons with stroke.\r"

Subarachnoid hemorrhage represented 11% of all strokes detected during 1983-1985 in the community-based stroke register in three areas of Finland. Age-standardized mortality from subarachnoid hemorrhage was 18/100,000/yr among men and 12/100,000/yr among women aged 25-74 years, representing in men 22% and in women 23% of all deaths from stroke in the register. The case-fatality rate of subarachnoid hemorrhage was high: 35% among men and 33% among women within 2 days after the onset of the stroke attack and 48% in men and 46% in women at 1 month. Our findings suggest that the incidence and mortality of subarachnoid hemorrhage in Finland are among the highest worldwide, although differences in criteria, study methods, and classification procedures reduce the comparability of studies from different countries. The occurrence of subarachnoid hemorrhage in our present study is also higher than that previously reported in this country. We believe that this is more likely due to changes in diagnostic classification and improvements in detection of the disease than to a real increase in the morbidity and mortality of subarachnoid hemorrhage.\r"

Platelet function in blood from the internal jugular vein tended to be enhanced during days 0-1 but recovered to the normal range during days 2-4. After day 5, platelet function showed various patterns depending on the presence of symptomatic vasospasm. In patients without symptomatic vasospasm, sequential changes were relatively minor, with normal or slightly high values. Patients with symptomatic vasospasm already showed high platelet aggregability during the early stage of vasospasm. The concentration of beta-thromboglobulin increased several days after the onset of vasospasm, reaching 80 ng/ml or more in patients with a poor prognosis. Two of the five patients with symptomatic vasospasm showed markedly high concentrations of thromboxane B2 after day 8. These results suggest that vasospasm activates platelets and promotes aggregability and that the resulting increased tendency for thrombus formation may affect the patient's prognosis during the advanced stage.\r"

This test consists of a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using monoclonal mouse anticystatin C and polyclonal rabbit anticystatin C antibodies. The cystatin C level was assayed in cerebrospinal fluid samples from 29 patients with brain hemorrhage and 45 control patients with other neurological diseases. Fifteen patients with brain hemorrhage showed low cystatin C levels (less than or equal to 70 ng/ml) in a clinical setting in which the positive and negative findings were compatible with a diagnosis of cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Immunohistological examination of brain tissue obtained by biopsy from two of the 15 patients confirmed the diagnosis of cerebral amyloid angiopathy and identified the deposition of cystatin C and beta-protein. This enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is simple to perform and may be useful for investigating patients suspected of having cerebral amyloid angiopathy with brain hemorrhage and the deposition of cystatin C.\r"

The main purpose of this study was to investigate the validity of these statements. We evaluated 40 hemiplegic subjects over 3 months. Radiographs of the affected and nonaffected shoulders were taken at both a frontal plane (0 degree) and a 45 degree incidence. From these patients, subluxed (n = 19) and nonsubluxed (n = 21) groups were formed. Pain was evaluated using the Present Pain Intensity index of the McGill Pain Questionnaire. On these x-ray films, measurements were taken of the V-shaped space, abduction of the arm, and rotation of the scapula. The statistical analysis (analysis of variance for repeated measures) contrasted the results obtained from the nonaffected side with those from the affected side over the 3 months studied. At the 45 degree angle, which better exposes the articular configuration of the shoulder, the difference in the V angle between the affected and nonaffected shoulders was significant for the subluxed group (p less than 0.01), indicating that such a V-shaped space can be identified. The measures taken also indicate that a downward subluxation of the humeral head occurs relative to the scapula without any systematic abduction of the humerus or downward rotation of the scapula. None of the results obtained from the frontal plane x-ray films was significant. Finally, no significant relation was found between subluxation and shoulder pain.\r"

We gave a dose of 1 mg/kg anti-CD18 to treatment rabbits 30 minutes before inducing irreversible ischemia in the brain with intraarterial microspheres or in the spinal cord using reversible aortic occlusion. Treatment with anti-CD18 produced a significant reduction in neurologic deficits in the reversible spinal cord model, but not in the irreversible microsphere model. This protective effect supports the active role of leukocytes in central nervous system reperfusion ischemic injury and offers potential for future therapy.\r"

Blood pressure in the treated groups was substantially lower than that in untreated groups after 1 week of hydralazine therapy and remained lower for the entire treatment period in all four experiments. Mean infarct volume in spontaneously hypertensive rats treated for 10 (p = 0.02) or 16 (p = 0.005) weeks, but not 1.5 or 6 weeks, was significantly less than that in the untreated controls. The percentage reduction of infarct volume in animals treated for 10 and 16 weeks was similar. This study demonstrates that antihypertensive therapy decreases infarct volume in hypertensive rats subjected to focal cerebral ischemia. This treatment effect appears to be dependent on the duration of therapy, and the magnitude of the treatment effect seems to plateau by 10 weeks of therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Lipid peroxidation reactions during reperfusion after cardiac arrest may contribute to postischemic cerebral hypoperfusion, which in turn can contribute to permanent neurological dysfunction. We designed this study to determine whether the aminosteroid U74006F, a putative inhibitor of lipid peroxidation, mitigates cerebral multifocal hypoperfusion after cardiac arrest. We used our established dog model of ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest (no blood flow) of 12.5 minutes, reperfusion by cardiopulmonary bypass of less than or equal to 5 minutes, and control of extracerebral variables during 4 hours postarrest. Cerebral blood flow was monitored by the stable xenon computed tomography method. Changes in cerebral oxygen consumption were obtained from mean blood flow values of coronal slices and the cerebral arteriovenous (sagittal sinus) oxygen content difference. A treatment group (n = 5) received U74006F starting with reperfusion (1.5 mg/kg i.a. plus 1.5 mg/kg i.v.) and three additional (graded) doses over 4 hours (total dose 4.5, 7.5, or 14.5 mg/kg). The U74006F-treated group showed the same postarrest transient hyperemia and protracted hypoperfusion in terms of global (computed tomography slice), regional, and local (multifocal) cerebral blood flow values and the same global cerebral oxygen consumption pattern as a concurrent control group (n = 5). At 1-4 hours postarrest, in both groups there was mismatching of global cerebral oxygen consumption, which reached baseline values, in relation to global cerebral blood flow and oxygen delivery, which remained at 50% of baseline. We conclude that treatment with U74006F after prolonged cardiac arrest causes no deleterious side effects and does not seem to alter multifocal postarrest cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effect of a putative lipid peroxidation inhibitor, the 21-aminosteroid U74006F, on transient forebrain ischemia in rats. Acute-treatment rats received either 3 mg/kg U74006F (n = 7) or carrier vehicle (n = 5) intravenously 30 minutes before ischemia, sustained-treatment rats received the same treatment before ischemia followed by 3 mg/kg U74006F (n = 6) or carrier vehicle (n = 5) intraperitoneally every 6 hours for 48 hours, and control rats (n = 7) received no injection. Coronal magnetic resonance images were obtained daily for 3 days, followed by the histological examination of perfusion-fixed brains. Control rats demonstrated magnetic resonance image changes indicative of neuronal damage in the striatum at 24 hours postischemia, followed by changes in the hippocampus and neocortex at 48 hours. No significant effect of U74006F treatment on striatal or hippocampal injury was demonstrated. However, both the acute and sustained U74006F treatments produced a significant reduction in the severity of neuronal damage in the neocortex (p less than 0.05). Our results suggest that U74006F is of benefit in ameliorating ischemic neuronal injury, particularly in the neocortex, and raise the possibility of regional variability in lipid peroxidation following an ischemic insult.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the 21-aminosteroid U74006F, a potent inhibitor of lipid peroxidation, for potential neuroprotective effects in a canine model of complete cerebral ischemia. Two 1.5-mg/kg boluses were administered to six dogs, the first bolus 15 minutes prior to a 12-minute episode of complete cerebral ischemia and the second bolus after 11 minutes of ischemia, 1 minute prior to reperfusion. Using this dosage regimen, plasma U74006F levels of greater than 0.3 microgram/ml were maintained for up to an hour postischemia. An additional six animals received equal volumes of the citrate vehicle solution. At 24 and 48 hours postischemia, the dogs were neurologically evaluated by an observer blinded as to treatment selection. All six U74006F-treated animals had a normal neurologic outcome at 48 hours postischemia, while the citrate vehicle-treated animals all suffered moderate to severe neurologic deficits. The difference in outcome was significant at both 24 and 48 hours (p less than 0.005). Although U74006F is a 21-aminosteroid, it is not reported to possess glucocorticoid activity. This is supported by the present finding that no changes in plasma glucose concentration were observed following administration of the drug. The systemic vitamin E levels of citrate vehicle-treated animals decreased significantly (from 4.10 +/- 0.46 micrograms/ml to 2.95 +/- 0.38 micrograms/ml, p less than 0.05), whereas the vitamin E levels in U74006F-treated animals did not decrease significantly. These results suggest that U74006F may be of benefit in improving neurologic outcome when administered prior to an episode of complete cerebral ischemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with 70% nitrous oxide in oxygen and fentanyl (10 micrograms x kg-1 i.v. bolus, 25 micrograms x kg-1 x hr-1 i.v. continuous infusion). Animals in group 1 (n = 10) received no angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor while animals in group 2 (n = 10) were given 10 mg x kg-1 i.v. captopril 30 minutes prior to the ischemic period. Ischemia was produced by unilateral carotid artery ligation and hemorrhagic hypotension to 35 mm Hg for 30 minutes. Body temperature, arterial blood gases, and arterial pH were maintained constant. Neurologic outcome was evaluated every 24 hours for 3 days using a graded deficit score (0, normal; 18, stroke-related death). On the third day after ischemia, captopril significantly improved neurologic outcome (median deficit score = 4) compared with controls (median deficit score = 18) (p less than 0.05). These results suggest that reduced angiotensin II levels or increased tissue kinin concentrations may decrease ischemic brain injury.\r"

Seventy-two hours later the basilar artery was exposed via the transclival approach and photographed at high-power magnification through an operating microscope. We then evaluated the effect of topical (n = 30) and intravenous (n = 20) magnesium sulfate on the spastic artery by computerized image analysis. A greater than 50% reduction in baseline diameter of the basilar artery was observed in the rats subjected to subarachnoid hemorrhage compared with the 10 controls (p less than 0.0001). Intravenous magnesium sulfate dilated the spastic artery to approximately 75% of the baseline diameter in control rats (p less than 0.0001). Topical magnesium sulfate caused dramatic dilation of the basilar artery in both the control and the subarachnoid hemorrhage groups to near 150% of the baseline diameter in the controls (p less than 0.001). All rats receiving intravenous magnesium sulfate reached therapeutic plasma levels of the ion. Hemodynamic effects were mild and immediately reversible upon cessation of magnesium sulfate administration. We suggest that magnesium has a role in the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage-induced vasospasm in humans.\r"

Microdialysis probes were inserted into the right striatum of postnatal day 7 rats. To induce hypoxic-ischemic injury, the right carotid artery was ligated and the animals were exposed to 8% oxygen for 2.5 hours (n = 22). Rats exposed to ligation alone (n = 10) or hypoxia alone (n = 8) and untreated controls (n = 17) were also studied. Two hours after probe insertion, a 30-minute baseline microdialysis sample was obtained. After arterial ligation, two additional baseline samples were collected. Five more samples were collected over the next 2.5 hours (in 8% oxygen or room air). Eight amino acids (glutamate, aspartate, taurine, glutamine, alanine, serine, glycine, and asparagine) were consistently detected in dialysates using a high-performance liquid chromatography assay with electrochemical detection. In untreated controls, amino acid efflux did not change over 4 hours. During hypoxia-ischemia, efflux values fluctuated widely, with marked intra-animal and interanimal variability. Efflux peaks for each amino acid were defined as values greater than the highest control mean value plus two standard deviations. Glutamate efflux peaks (greater than 7 pmol/min compared with 2 pmol/min at baseline) were detected in no controls and in eight hypoxic-ischemic rats (p = 0.006, Fisher's two-tailed exact test). Taurine efflux peaks (greater than 75 pmol/min compared with 10 pmol/min for controls at baseline) were detected in 10 hypoxic-ischemic rats and one control (p = 0.01) and in seven of the eight animals in which glutamate efflux peaks occurred (p = 0.006).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We review here the literature in both animal models and humans concerning electrical activity, blood flow, and metabolism in the hemisphere contralateral to unilateral cerebral ischemia. We analyze the data by periods based on the time from initial injury to emphasize the time course of transhemispheric diaschisis. Contralateral electrical activity, such as evoked potential amplitude, is increased in the late stages after unilateral infarction, with the data from the more acute periods being inconclusive. Contralateral blood flow changes probably depend on the magnitude of the ischemic injury, with a larger insult resulting in a decrease not seen with smaller insults. Some studies have shown a decrease in contralateral blood flow over the first week followed by a gradual return toward baseline. Most measures of contralateral metabolism show a time course similar to blood flow, that is, a decrease followed by gradual recovery. The effects of corpus callosum section on transhemispheric diaschisis are not yet established. We provide examples to show that under certain conditions, diaschisis may represent a loss of remote inhibition rather than a loss of remote facilitation, as von Monakow originally suggested. By following the contralateral changes over time, particularly during the first minutes and hours of ischemia, insight will be gained into the brain's responses remote from the focus of ischemic injury. These responses should bear a relation to the brain's defense mechanisms ipsilaterally to the region of ischemia.\r"

Merocyanine 540 (MC 540) with visible light was used as an example of an oxygen-dependent chemical-directed at the viral membrane, and aminomethyl trimethyl psoralen (AMT) with ultraviolet A light (UVA) was used as an example of a nucleic acid-directed system. Antiviral conditions in petri dishes were identified and the effects of these procedures on platelet suspensions in plastic storage containers were studied. Concentrations of photochemicals in the 10 to 150 mumol range with 30 to 60 minutes of visible light (MC 540) or 1 to 2 minutes of UVA (AMT) readily inactivated 5 to 6 log10 of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and other model viruses in platelet suspensions, provided the plasma concentration was reduced to about 15 percent by the use of a synthetic platelet storage medium. Extracellular pH, morphology scores, and aggregation response dropped markedly when platelets were treated with MC 540 and visible light. However, treatment with 136 mumol per L of AMT and 1 to 3 minutes of UVA could inactivate 5 log10 of VSV in platelet suspensions with retention of platelet characteristics for 4 days, particularly if oxygen levels were reduced during treatment. These studies demonstrate that AMT-UVA treatment meets the initial requirements for virus inactivation in platelet suspensions.\r"

As irradiation performed in a blood center or a hospital will probably be associated with a variable postirradiation delay before transfusion, the ability to store PCs after UVB irradiation becomes important. The effects have been studied of a UVB dose of 10,000 mJ per cm2, the dose used in our institution for UVB clinical trials, on PCs pooled and stored for up to 96 hours after irradiation. Results showed that after 96 hours of storage, though there were no changes in pH, platelet count, white cell count, percent discharge of lactate dehydrogenase, or beta-thromboglobulin, there were significant decreases in morphology score and osmotic recovery. These changes, however, were not evident after 24 hours of storage. Similarly, there was a 60-percent decrease in immunoreactive membrane glycoprotein (GP) Ib after 96 hours of storage, but these changes were not seen after 48 hours of storage. No changes were seen in levels of GPIIb/IIIa in either group during the 96 hours of storage. On computer-analyzed two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, PCs irradiated at 10,000 mJ per cm2 and stored for 72 hours had changes in over 50 platelet proteins as compared to those proteins in nonirradiated age-matched control PCs. It can be concluded that UVB irradiation of PCs at 10,000 mJ per cm2 does not lead to significant platelet deterioration after short-term storage (24-48 hours) but is likely to be deleterious after long-term (72-96 hours) storage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The changes noted in ATP, pH, LDH, and PFH are significant but minimal on Day 42 and imply that viability changes would also be minimal. These biochemical data support the storage of irradiated units for at least 28 days.\r"

Affirmative responses were obtained from 0.6 or 4.0 percent of the donors, depending on how the question was asked. In one center, more than 6 percent of donors gave affirmative answers. The efficacy of asking a relatively simple question about gastrointestinal symptoms as a way of preventing Y. enterocolitica should be evaluated further, because relatively large numbers of donors may respond affirmatively. Other methods of reducing the risk of transfusion-associated Y. enterocolitica infection should be pursued.\r"

  ".W": "In vivo survival studies of human red cells (RBCs) are commonly carried out by using chromium-51 (51Cr), a gamma-emitting radionuclide, as the cell label. The effects of labeling human RBCs with PKH-2, a nonradioactive lipophilic fluorescent dye that binds to the cell membrane, and the feasibility of detecting the labeled cells by flow cytometric analysis were investigated. Optimal labeling, defined as maximum mean fluorescence intensity with minimal cell-to-cell variability in fluorescence intensity and minimal cell loss, was achieved with the use of 15.0 x 10(-6) M (15.0 x 10(-6) mol/L) PKH-2 and a cell concentration of 4.0 x 10(9) RBCs per mL. Both freshly drawn and stored RBCs could be labeled, but RBCs stored for more than 20 days did not take up the label as uniformly as fresher cells. Although labeling with PKH-2 did not interfere with the detection of ABO, Rh(D), or common minor RBC antigens by routine serologic methods, it resulted in a morphologic appearance resembling echinocytosis and an increased resistance to osmotic lysis by hypotonic saline. RBCs labeled by this method could be quantitated accurately in blood samples in which their proportion was 0.01 percent, or 1 labeled cell in 10,000 cells. This method holds promise as a simple, reliable, and sensitive method for the detection of labeled human RBCs, but the in vivo significance of the label's effects on cell morphology and osmotic fragility is not known. Further studies directly comparing PKH-2-labeled and 51Cr-labeled RBCs will be necessary to establish the accuracy of the former method in determining the in vivo survival of human RBCs.\r"

Analysis was conducted of 5660 PADs made at 25 different blood centers, to determine the risks of PAD in nonhospital settings and to search for predictors of severe reactions. Sixteen percent (886) of the donations studied were by persons who did not meet all usual homologous donor criteria. The most common variances were for cardiovascular disease, including the use of cardiac drugs (416 donors, 41% of those not meeting criteria), history of angina (204, 23%), and history of myocardial infarction (192, 22%). Donation by persons not meeting routine criteria was followed by a higher reaction rate than that by donors without any variance (4.3 vs. 2.7%; p less than 0.0001). An increased likelihood of reaction was associated with donor age less than 17 years, female gender, weight less than 110 pounds, and a history of reaction. Four reactions were graded as severe (transient ischemic attack, 1; angina, 3), and all occurred in donors not meeting all criteria (0.4% of 886 donations). A review of these donors' histories failed to identify distinguishing features from which their severe reactions could have been predicted. This study documents the infrequency of severe reactions after PADs by persons referred to a blood center for donation, even those not meeting routine homologous donor criteria, and quantitates the risk to these donors of a severe reaction.\r"

Data collected for 27 regional Connecticut hospitals that accept directed donations were compared with similar data for Hartford Hospital, an 885-bed tertiary-care facility. The number of directed-donor units (68) collected by the American Red Cross Blood Services for Hartford Hospital during the study period was comparable to the number (average, 62.3) provided for smaller (301-450 beds) institutions in the state. The percentage that directed-donor units drawn for Hartford Hospital represented of the total number of homologous units provided (0.23%) was less than that for any of the categories of hospitals, by size, in the state. Supplying the patient and/or the patient's family, in a personalized manner, with information concerning the advantages and disadvantages of directed as well as of volunteer donor blood can result in a marked overall reduction in the number of directed donations and also serves to reassure those concerned about blood transfusion.\r"

Reactions in patients transfused during a 4-year period with 134 autologous marrows cryopreserved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were compared with those in patients transfused with marrow that had been collected from HLA-compatible donors and that had not been cryopreserved. Patients transfused with cryopreserved marrow had significantly more nausea (44.8 vs. 14.1%; p less than 0.0005), vomiting (23.9 vs. 8.5%; p less than 0.01), chills (31.3 vs. 1.4%; p less than 0.0005), and fever (17.9 vs. 0%; p less than 0.005) than patients transfused with fresh allogeneic marrow. The incidence of emesis correlated with the dose of DMSO received, but that of nausea did not. All cryopreserved marrows were cultured for bacteria at the time of transfusion and 17 (12.7%) were found to be positive. Only 1 of the 17 patients transfused with culture-positive marrow developed sepsis during the transplant course with the same organism that was present in the transfused marrow. Although the reactions in donors transfused with cryopreserved marrow were readily treated, this study suggests that the incidence of some reactions might be decreased by reducing the dose of DMSO transfused. Bacterial contamination of transfused marrow was a worrisome complication, and efforts should be made to improve marrow collection and processing techniques to minimize that risk.\r"

  ".W": "New procedures and new devices have been developed to improve the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) assay by using microtiter plates with 96 wells. Sera for ALT determination and reagents are distributed with a computer-controlled multiple syringe for simultaneous filling of the 96 wells. The volumes simultaneously distributed by this new multiple syringe show very little variation. The coefficient of variation (CV) is 0.6 percent (n = 96). Repeated filling of the wells with this syringe results in good reproducibility of distributed volumes (CV = 0.5%, n = 10). The temperature of sera, reagents, and mixtures, even during photometry, is actively regulated (down or up) to 25 degrees C in special chambers. Thus, the temperature varies minimally +/- 0.05 degrees C. ALT values in the low normal range as well as the high pathologic range show little variation (CV less than 2.3%) in aliquots of the same sample simultaneously or subsequently examined by the new procedure and with new devices. There is good correlation between the improved method using microtiter plates and the conventional methods (r greater than 0.9900, ALT values from 1-154 U/L). False-low and false-high values are excluded by computerized evaluation of many single determinations during the kinetic reactions in each sample. The new method is precise as well as simple, saves time, and may become important for the determination of other serum constituents on the basis of kinetics.\r"

The model takes into account the fact that certain resource inputs--notably, direct labor and machines--increase in discrete steps rather than in a continuous manner. To address this fact, a stepwise cost analysis function was developed, which related operating costs to the volume of apheresis collections. This function was used to predict the marginal costs of potential increases in the supply of plasma at a blood center in Canada. Differences were noted in the cost of plasma in Canada and the United States, much of which could be attributed to different standards regarding the volume of plasma per collection and to differences in pricing materials.\r"

  ".W": "This article introduces a new method of component preparation that is capable of producing white cell (WBC)-reduced platelet concentrates (PCs) from whole blood. Whole blood is separated into packed red cells (RBCs) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) by centrifugation, and the PRP is expressed through a newly designed WBC removal filter into the platelet storage bag. The filtered PRP is then centrifuged and yields WBC-reduced PCs and plasma for freezing as fresh-frozen plasma (FFP). The method uses standard triple-pack blood bags and centrifugation protocols. Fifteen WBC-reduced PCs prepared with this technique had an average volume of 56.7 mL, an average Day 5 platelet content of 8.6 x 10(10) per unit, and an average Day 5 WBC content of 0.83 +/- 0.7 x 10(4) per unit (0.14 WBCs/microL). This represents WBC removal equal to at least 99.9 percent (3 log10) of the WBCs found in standard PCs prepared in our laboratory by an identical centrifugation protocol. Paired studies documented a 4.5-percent platelet loss by filtration. Filtration had no effect on the plasma prepared for FFP as measured by prothrombin time; activated partial thromboplastin time; factors I, V, VIII:C, and VIII:von Willebrand factor; antithrombin-III; albumin; globulin; or total protein. This method holds promise as a simple and highly effective technique for the production of WBC-reduced PCs by filtration during component preparation.\r"

  ".W": "Active blood warming is a recent practice and arises out of conflicting needs. On the one hand, the safety and preservation of blood require refrigerated storage and delivery up to the moment of transfusion. On the other hand, modern methods of very rapid transfusion in resuscitation would cause clinically dangerous hypothermia if unmodified, ice-cold blood were to be so transfused. These needs must be reconciled in the interest of adequate patient care--hence the need for blood warming. Nevertheless, blood warming creates risks of its own and should not be used without justifying clinical indications. Within limits that extend somewhat above normal body temperature, the application of heat does no harm to stored RBC, a fact that is not reflected in current standards for blood warmers. Bearing in mind the human tendency to \"stretch\" standards and the fallibility of mechanical devices, caution is always wise. But perhaps the time has come for reconsideration of the present upper limit of 38 degrees C. Many varieties of blood warmers are available in the US, but none at this time is based on electromagnetic activity. The most common systems now in use are in-line warmers, most of which are not adequate for the type of rapid-transfusion systems currently available. Countercurrent in-line blood warmers and the method of rapid warm saline admixture can both be used successfully for rapid, massive transfusions. Blood warming is seldom necessary or desirable for elective transfusions at conventional rates, even for patients with cold autoagglutinins.\r"

  ".U": "91306823\r", 
  ".W": "Laparoscopic cholecystectomy, a surgical technique first performed in France, has gained widespread acceptance among surgeons in the United States. The abdominal cavity is inflated by carbon dioxide, a video monitor is inserted via a laparoscope placed periumbilically, and the gallbladder is freed and removed from the liver bed by using small subcostal ports for access and dissection. Intraoperative cholangiography is routinely performed, but uncertainty exists about how best to manage choledocholithiasis. Compared with traditional cholecystectomy, initial reports describing laparoscopic cholecystectomy cite shorter recovery times because no large incisions are made, thus potentially reducing the cost and morbidity of cholecystectomy. A survey of 614 early cases supports these claims, with a reported complication rate of 1.5% and quick resumption of normal activities by patients. Because of its promise for reduced morbidity, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is challenging open cholecystectomy as the therapeutic gold standard for symptomatic cholelithiasis. Thus, the standard to which the nonsurgical gallstone therapies, such as lithotripsy and contact dissolution, will be compared may shift to laparoscopic cholecystectomy. As the laparoscopic complications are similar to those of traditional cholecystectomy, such as abscesses and bile leaks, their percutaneous treatment should not change.\r"

  ".U": "91306825\r", 
  ".W": "Tumor hypoxia is of considerable importance to the oncologist in selecting and optimizing cancer therapy, because hypoxia can determine the effectiveness of various therapies. The relationship between tumor hypoxia and tumor bioenergetics, assessed by 31P MR spectroscopy, is examined to determine whether 31P MR spectroscopy can be clinically useful to measure or characterize tumor hypoxia. Work with experimental tumors has suggested that several different types of hypoxia may exist and that 31P MR spectroscopy cannot be used to characterize all types. Metabolic hypoxia is the level of hypoxia that results in mitochondrial impairment in cells, and it is associated with declining cellular bioenergetic status, which can be measured by enzymatic assay of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Because 31P MR spectroscopy is sensitive to levels of ATP, it is potentially sensitive to metabolic hypoxia in vivo and may provide a rapid and noninvasive technique for characterizing metabolic hypoxia in tumors. Radiobiologic hypoxia is the level of hypoxia that results in attenuated cell death due to radiation, because radiotoxicity is directly related to tissue levels of oxygen. Radiobiologic hypoxia of tumors thus has more impact on choice of therapy, yet the relationship between metabolic hypoxia and radiobiologic hypoxia remains to be elucidated. An analysis of published data suggests that 31P MR spectroscopy is directly sensitive to metabolic hypoxia in tumors, but it is only indirectly sensitive to radiobiologic hypoxia in tumors. Therefore, 31P MR spectroscopy may be unable to quantify the cell fraction of a tumor that has radiobiologic hypoxia. However, preliminary data suggest that MR spectroscopy may prove useful for determining the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions designed to manipulate radiobiologic hypoxia in tumors or for monitoring the kinetics of tumor reoxygenation after treatment.\r"

The key radiologic finding is a calcified endobronchial or peribronchial lymph node. To determine the CT findings of broncholithiasis, we retrospectively reviewed the chest radiographs and CT scans of 15 patients with proved broncholithiasis. Ten patients had endobronchial nodes as proved by bronchoscopy, surgery, or lithoptysis. Broncholiths were identified on bronchoscopy in only five cases. Five patients had peribronchial nodes with associated bronchial distortion. Collimation of the CT scans varied; 1.0-cm-, 0.6-cm-, and 0.5-cm-thick sections were obtained. Three patients had both 1.0-cm- and 0.5-cm-thick sections. The calcified lymph node was identified on CT in all 15 patients. CT correctly localized six of 10 endobronchial nodes and four of five peribronchial nodes. Findings due to bronchial obstruction also were seen on CT; atelectasis (n = 11), infiltration (n = 4), bronchiectasis (n = 4), and air trapping (n = 1). An associated soft-tissue mass was not seen in any case. Difficulty in determining the relationship between lymph node and bronchus is due to volume averaging, which can be decreased by scanning thinner sections. CT can suggest the diagnosis of broncholithiasis and is useful when bronchoscopy does not show a broncholith.\r"

  ".U": "91306828\r", 
  ".W": "Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) was diagnosed in 165 surgical specimens (119 patients) at our institution between 1974 and 1987. LCIS was seen more often in younger women (mean age, 49 years) than other breast carcinomas were (mean age, 58 years). Sampling of a single breast revealed multifocal disease in 70% (96/138). When both breasts were sampled, bilateral foci were found in 50% (41/82). Of 165 breasts with foci of LCIS, 37% (61/165) had simultaneously occurring invasive cancers in the same breast. Direct mammographic-pathologic correlation of foci of LCIS was possible in 73 breasts (67 patients). Microcalcifications were an indication for biopsy in 49% (20/41) of breasts with a mammographic abnormality, but were a nonspecific finding often found in tissues adjacent to foci of LCIS. The mammogram was normal in 44% (32/73) of breasts with foci of LCIS. The mammograms of patients with LCIS and those from a group of age-matched control subjects were compared by using a modified form of Wolfe's criteria and the percentage of fibroglandular elements. LCIS was seldom found in an N1 breast (1% vs 29%) or in a breast with less than 25% of its parenchymal area occupied by fibroglandular density (3% vs 33%). Compared with the control group, breasts with LCIS had more than 50% fibroglandular density (85% vs 45%) and a much higher frequency of the DY pattern (56% vs 36%). More fibroglandular density was seen in the LCIS group at all ages. Postmenopausally, the frequencies of the DY pattern and fibroglandular density greater than 50% in LCIS patients were nearly double those in the control group. LCIS patients have disease of the entire breast parenchyma, characterized by multifocality and bilaterality of various forms of lobular disease. Their mammograms reveal a higher rate of the DY pattern and higher percentages of fibroglandular or parenchymal density than those of age-matched controls. In LCIS patients, persistence of the DY pattern, or large amounts of fibroglandular density postmenopausally supports the concept that mammographically dense breasts are a marker for increased cancer risk in women 50 years old and older.\r"

Strongly enhancing lesions may become isointense relative to the fat signal and become invisible or indistinct after contrast administration. Fat-suppressed chemical-shift imaging (CSI) combined with administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine improves lesion detection and characterization in other areas of the body where a strong lipid signal is present. We evaluated this technique in the breast. Twenty patients with mammographic lesions were studied with standard unenhanced T1- and T2-weighted images and enhanced T1-weighted images, as well as with CSI before and after administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine. The series were ranked independently for border and matrix characteristics. The border was assessed for a smooth, irregular, or spiculated margin. The matrix or internal substance was evaluated for visibility and type of enhancement, homogeneous or inhomogeneous. The enhanced CSI images were superior to all other images in the depiction of border and matrix characteristics. Of 20 patients, a corresponding mass was detected on MR in 14. In two of the 14 patients, the lesion was seen only in the enhanced CSI images. Chemical-shift artifacts on enhanced T1-weighted images obscured border detail in several cases. Enhanced CSI improves visualization of breast lesions as compared with conventional MR imaging with or without enhancement. The enhanced CSI technique produces differential enhancement between glandular tissue and lesions while suppressing the signal from fat. This improves the visualization of border and matrix characteristics and depicts lesions that otherwise might be obscured.\r"

Tumors were solitary in 72% of patients and multiple in 28%. Fifty percent were located in the abdominal wall, 41% in the mesentery, and 9% in the retroperitoneum. More than two thirds of the lesions had well-defined borders, with the remainder displaying an infiltrative outer margin. The majority of tumors had attenuation values equal to (47%) or greater than (41%) the attenuation of muscle on contrast-enhanced CT scans. Complications attributable to the desmoid were commonly detectable on CT (hydronephrosis occurred in 36% and small-bowel obstruction in 20%).

We studied 205 patients to determine if gallbladder contractility before biliary lithotripsy is a predictor of treatment results and rate of fragment clearance. Percentage gallbladder contraction was calculated from the fractional difference in the sonographically measured gallbladder volumes before and after a fatty meal. Seventy-six patients (37%) were free of stones and fragments, and 129 patients (63%) had residual fragments at comparable follow-up intervals. Statistical analysis showed a significant difference in gallbladder contractility before biliary lithotripsy between the fragment-free group and the residual-fragment group (p = .008). Stone burden before treatment showed no significant difference between the groups (p = .074), but the number of stones was significantly less in the fragment-free group (p = .022). In the fragment-free group, a poor correlation (r = .047) was found between the percentage gallbladder contraction and the rate of fragment clearance. These data indicate that contractility of the gallbladder before treatment correlates with overall success of biliary lithotripsy but is not a predictor of the speed of fragment clearance.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to determine the accuracy of color Doppler imaging in the diagnosis of portal vein thrombosis. Two hundred fifteen patients were studied with color Doppler imaging to determine patency of the main portal vein. Sonographic findings were confirmed in 75 patients, aged 19 to 66 years. Correlation with angiography was obtained in 13 patients, and surgical correlation was obtained in the remaining 62. Nine patients had portal vein thrombosis on the basis of these gold standards. Sonograms were classified as showing either patency or thrombosis, depending on the ability to show color flow within the main portal vein. Agreement between sonography and angiography or surgery was found in 69 patients (61 patent, eight thrombosed). One patient with a patent portal vein at sonography was found to have a thrombosed vessel at surgery, whereas five patients without portal venous flow at sonography had patent vessels at angiography (one patient) or surgery (four patients). Overall sensitivity and specificity for detection of portal vein thrombosis were 89% and 92%, with an accuracy of 92%, a false-negative rate of 0.11, a negative predictive value of 0.98, and a positive predictive value of 0.62. We postulate that the majority of errors in our study occurred in vessels that, although patent, had only sluggish flow, which could not be resolved because of technical limitations. We conclude that color Doppler imaging is a valuable screening procedure for the assessment of portal vein patency. If the sonogram shows a patent portal vein, no further studies are required. However, a lack of demonstrable flow does not always indicate thrombosis, and other imaging studies should be performed for confirmation.\r"

GRE imaging was performed in 31 subjects, 15 normal volunteers and 16 patients with documented portal venous disease (15 cases) or suspected disease (one case). Eight of 16 patients had venous thrombosis, five had focal thrombus, and three had complete occlusion. Six patients had extrinsic venous compression by tumor. Of the two other patients, one had an arteriovenous fistula and the other a falsely positive angiogram, suggesting portal vein occlusion. In normal subjects, GRE scans had excellent visualization of the portal venous system with high intravascular signal compared with surrounding tissues. Nine (60%) of 15 normal subjects and three patients had an artifact consisting of a curvilinear area of decreased signal that could mimic clot. In three of five patients with focal thrombus, clot was identified on GRE but not on SE images. In all three patients with occlusion, SE and GRE images demonstrated similar findings. In five of the six patients with extrinsic venous compression by tumor, SE and GRE studies showed similar findings. Of the two patients, an arteriovenous fistula was seen on GRE MR in one, and in the other, patency of the left portal vein was seen on SE and GRE images after angiography had suggested portal vein occlusion. Collateral vessels were seen in nine of 16 patients. In five of nine cases, GRE MR demonstrated more extensive collaterals than did SE MR. In summary, GRE MR provides a useful adjunct to standard SE MR imaging. Benefits include high contrast between vascular structures and surrounding tissues, reduced motion artifact, and rapid scanning within a breath-hold.\r"

We retrospectively studied 36 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who were examined with both CT and sonography before undergoing hepatic transplantation. Pathologic findings of the entire resected liver were correlated with results of imaging studies before transplantation. Parenchymal lesions were shown by sonography in 29 cases (81%) and by CT in 34 cases (94%). Although CT was more sensitive than sonography was, both CT and sonography frequently failed to depict reliably the size of tumor or the exact number of tumor nodules as determined pathologically. Pathologic findings showed vascular invasion in 19 cases (53%), whereas CT showed invasion in 11 cases (31%) and sonography showed it in only six (17%). Nodal metastasis to the porta hepatis was found in four patients; CT correctly showed two cases (three false-positive) and sonography correctly showed one case. Intrahepatic ductal dilatation was seen in eight patients on CT but was not identified on sonography. We conclude that CT is more accurate for identifying and staging hepatocellular carcinoma, but both CT and sonography frequently fail to depict the extent (size and number of lesions) of disease, especially when underlying cirrhosis is present.\r"

All of the patients had nonspecific constitutional symptoms and/or complaints referable to the upper gastrointestinal tract. No clinical evidence of active Crohn disease was present. In each patient, barium examination and CT showed either a mass (two cases) or other radiologic features of malignancy (two cases). Endoscopy with biopsy was performed in three patients and findings were misleading in two patients. The possibility of an increased risk of malignancy in sites remote from inflamed bowel segments has been reported. The findings in this study suggest that patients with Crohn disease, particularly disease of late onset, may be predisposed to the development of gastric carcinoma.\r"

It has been postulated that the fibrosis in the idiopathic cases results from a hypersensitivity reaction to antigens leaking into the retroperitoneum from atheromatous plaques in the aorta or common iliac arteries. In the remaining one third of cases, causes include ergot-derivative drugs, retroperitoneal hemorrhage or urine extravasation, and a desmoplastic response to a variety of tumors. In up to 15% of cases, associated fibrotic processes are found elsewhere in the body. Although the disease is imaged best with CT or MR, neither of these techniques can be used to differentiate benign from malignant plaques. Histologically, the disease is characterized in its early stages by inflammatory cells and edema in a loose collagen network. The mature plaque is composed of dense fibrous tissue with minimal cellular infiltration. This progression is important as it influences MR signal characteristics.\r"

  ".W": "Most studies of duplex Doppler sonography for the assessment of erectile dysfunction involve determination of peak systolic velocities 5 min after intracavernosal injection of papaverine. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the timing of Doppler measurements of flow after papaverine injection for establishing the presence of arterial and venous abnormalities. Color Doppler sonography was performed in 75 patients for evaluation of vasculogenic impotence. After intracavernosal injection of 60 mg of papaverine, measurements of peak systolic and end-diastolic velocities were obtained in each cavernosal artery at 5-min intervals for a total of 30 min. A peak systolic velocity of less than 25 cm/sec was used as the threshold for arterial insufficiency. An end-diastolic velocity of greater than 5 cm/sec was used to predict venous incompetence. Scanning was performed for direct assessment of dorsal venous flow. Thirty patients were subsequently evaluated by cavernosometry and cavernosography. In most patients (76%), maximum response to papaverine was achieved within the first 5 min. In eight patients, significant increases in systolic velocity were seen only after 5 min. In 10 patients, significant changes in end-diastolic velocity between 5 and 30 min resulted in diagnostic reclassification. Data acquisition for 30 min significantly improved the sensitivity (95%) and specificity (83%) for the prediction of venous incompetence in patients with correlative cavernosography. Transient, early dorsal vein flow was noted in normal subjects. Persistent dorsal vein flow had an 80% sensitivity and 100% specificity for venous incompetence. Our results suggest that, when using color Doppler sonography, gathering data for 30 min may improve the prediction of vasculogenic impotence.\r"

Endorectal sonography allows visualization of the seminal vesicles, which are otherwise difficult to examine. We used endorectal sonography to evaluate six young men, five of whom were being evaluated for azoospermia and infertility. One patient had no identifiable seminal vesicle on either side. Four patients had unilateral absence of the seminal vesicles. Of these four, three had a sonographically normal-appearing seminal vesicle on the contralateral side, and the fourth had an obstructed system contralaterally. The sixth patient had a hypoplastic system on the left and an obstructed system on the right. The delineation of an obstructed or agenetic seminal vesicle and seminal tract on endorectal sonography allows decisions to be made regarding treatment and prognosis.\r"

MR showed increasing areas of low signal, and histologic examination showed changes of fat necrosis, inflammatory infiltrate, and fibrocytic and bony repair. These processes were divided into four stages. Stage 1 is seen in the first days after surgery and consists of homogeneous high signal on MR and only subtle histologic changes of early fat necrosis. Stage 2, seen by 7 days after surgery, shows linear low-signal areas within the high-signal marrow on MR and fat necrosis and an inflammatory infiltrate on histologic sections. Stage 3, seen by 16 days after surgery, shows patchy low signal occupying more of the marrow on MR with a fibrocytic infiltrate on histologic sections. Stage 4, seen by 23 days after surgery, shows a more homogeneous low and intermediate signal on MR and histologic findings of more organized fibrocytes and the onset of new bone formation. Using this model, we have proved that MR imaging can show marrow changes as soon as 1 week after the onset of avascular necrosis. Whereas MR imaging showed a progression of increasing areas of low signal, the histologic findings seen during this time were diverse, including inflammatory infiltration (a previously unreported finding), fat necrosis, and fibrocytic and osseous repair.\r"

In order to determine whether enhancement with gadopentetate dimeglumine could add clinically significant information to that available with unenhanced MR imaging, 21 patients with osteosarcoma underwent preoperative MR imaging. T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo MR images obtained before and after administration of IV gadopentetate dimeglumine were evaluated to determine the conspicuity of marrow and soft-tissue extent of tumor, including tumor involvement of major neurovascular bundles and adjacent joints. MR results were correlated with tumor margins found at surgery. In some instances, use of gadopentetate dimeglumine obscured differentiation of tumor from normal marrow or tumor infiltration into perineurovascular fat, and tumor extension through pseudocapsule could not be differentiated from peritumoral edema after contrast administration. Contrast enhancement did assist in differentiation of intraarticular tumor from effusion; however, synovial invasion could be identified on unenhanced T1-weighted images by loss of synovial fat and cortical disruption. These results indicate that gadopentetate dimeglumine does not assist in defining tumor margins of osteosarcoma.\r"

Recurrences were confirmed histologically in 12 (46%) of 26 studies. The MR images and sonograms were obtained within 1 month of each other. The findings were classified as recurrence, no recurrence, or indeterminate. Sonography was instrumental in guiding fine-needle aspiration biopsy of impalpable lesions. In two cases, the findings on sonography were indeterminate. In both of these cases, the sonograms had been obtained soon after surgery (at 2 and 4 months). The sensitivity and specificity in the detection of local recurrences were 83% and 93%, respectively, for MR and 100% and 79%, respectively, for sonography. These differences were not statistically significant. We conclude that MR and sonography appear to be equally useful in the detection of local recurrences of soft-tissue sarcomas, sonography can be used for routine follow-up and in guiding needle biopsies, sonography may be more difficult to interpret than MR during the early postoperative period, and MR should be used if sonography is inconclusive.\r"

The radiologists compared the visibility of specific anatomic features and rated the SER images as better than, equal to, or worse than the conventional radiographs. In the evaluation of the images of the cervical spine, the radiologists much preferred the SER images 63% of the time because of slight improvement in bone detail and marked improvement in detail of the soft tissues.

The 67Ga-citrate scan augments the diagnostic value of the 99mTc-MDP scan, and the 111In-labeled WBC scan is useful for detecting abscesses.

Otherwise no significant difference was noted between Exosurf and human surfactant in radiologic severity of respiratory distress syndrome or in the prevalence of pulmonary interstitial emphysema, pneumothorax, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. These findings support the thesis that artificial surfactant is an acceptable substitute for surfactants of biological origin, with possible benefits of safety and ease of use.\r"

  ".W": "Characteristic systolic and diastolic pulse contours occur in the carotid Doppler waveforms of patients with aortic valvular disease that have not previously been described in publications concerning carotid duplex sonography. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the presence and characterize the nature of these carotid duplex waveform abnormalities in patients with known aortic valve disease and to correlate these changes with the severity of valve dysfunction. The study group consisted of 26 patients with aortic regurgitation or combined aortic regurgitation and aortic stenosis. Duplex studies were retrospectively reviewed by two radiologists for the presence of two systolic peaks, and for the presence of diastolic reversal of flow direction. This pattern of two systolic peaks, characteristic of aortic regurgitation, is called bisferious from the Latin \"twice beating.\" Aortic regurgitation was graded by echocardiography as mild, moderate, or severe by the cardiologists reviewing the examination. A group of 20 age-matched patients without aortic valvular disease were similarly assessed. The bisferious pattern was demonstrated in 13 (50%) of 26 patients. Five (19%) of 26 patients had significant reversal of diastolic flow. Four patients were studied both before and after aortic valve replacement. Three had bisferious wave contours preoperatively; two of these also had diastolic reversal of flow. The fourth patient had retrograde flow in diastole without systolic contour abnormality. Postoperatively, all carotid waveforms were normal. None of the duplex waveforms in the control group demonstrated characteristic systolic or diastolic abnormalities. The bisferious waveform and retrograde diastolic flow are Doppler patterns associated with aortic valvular disease. These patterns are reversible after aortic valve replacement. While echocardiography remains the study of choice in the evaluation of suspected valvular dysfunction, up to one third of patients with aortic regurgitation may not have a detectable murmur. Therefore, identifying these patterns on carotid duplex examinations may provide clinically useful information and serve as a clue to previously unsuspected cardiovascular disease.\r"

Women without identifiable somatic abnormality (group 2) were younger, had higher mean somatization scores, and reported an earlier mean age at first intercourse, a higher number of total sexual partners, and a higher prevalence of sexual abuse before the age of 20. Within group 2 (nonsomatic pain) but not within group 1, mean somatization scores were significantly higher among women with a history of sexual abuse than among women with a negative history. When analyzed as risks for nonsomatic pelvic pain, the positive predictive value of both a history of sexual abuse and a high somatization score was 78% (relative risk compared with that of women with zero or one risk factor, 2.1; p less than 0.0001). These data suggest that the psychosocial profile of women with nonsomatic pelvic pain differs from that of women with somatic pelvic pain and that previous sexual abuse is a significant predisposing risk for somatization and non-somatic chronic pelvic pain.\r"

The biosynthesis of endothelin 1 and 2 by an avascular tissue is suggestive of a wider role for endothelins than has been recognized.\r"

  ".W": "Intensive treatment of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus during pregnancy often normalizes plasma glucose levels. However, it is unclear whether this adversely affects other metabolic fuels that are essential to normal fetal growth and development. Metabolic studies were conducted after the subjects ingested a standardized mixed meal during each trimester in 7 normal and 15 insulin-dependent diabetic pregnant women. The latter were treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion or multiple injections, which were adjusted to achieve strict glucose control throughout pregnancy. Insulin, alanine, branched-chain amino acids, triglycerides, free fatty acids, and ketones were measured every 15 to 30 minutes before a standardized breakfast and for 150 minutes after the breakfast. Patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus were studied while they received their unusual insulin dosages. Fasting glucose levels (87 +/- 7 mg/dl) and glucose levels 150 minutes after the meal (112 +/- 11 mg/dl) were near normal. However, normoglycemia was achieved at the expense of increased plasma insulin levels (area under insulin response curves, p less than 0.01, vs nondiabetic curves). Nevertheless, fasting and post-prandial plasma branched-chain amino acids, alanine, and free fatty acids were similar in both groups. Fasting cholesterol, triglyceride, and ketone levels were also normalized. We conclude that normalization of circulating amino acids and lipids in conjunction with correction of hyperglycemia may contribute to favorable outcomes in infants of intensively treated diabetic mothers.\r"

We studied the activity of the placenta to produce interleukin-1 with an enzyme immunoassay by culturing tissue blocks. The placental tissue obtained after labor produced a larger amount of interleukin-1 than placental tissue obtained before labor. All the placental tissues produced more interleukin-1 beta than interleukin-1 alpha. The placentas with labor and chorioamnionitis produced about seventeenfold more interleukin-1 than placentas with labor only. We immunohistochemically identified interleukin-1--producing cells in the placenta and found that syncytiotrophoblasts produced both interleukin-1 alpha and interleukin-1 beta, while Hofbauer cells produced only interleukin-1 beta. In vitro analysis of the trophoblast activities to produce interleukin-1 revealed that microbial byproducts enhanced interleukin-1 production, possibly inducing accumulation of interleukin-1 receptor-positive cells at the sites of inflammation. In addition to stimulation of prostaglandin biosynthesis and labor, the placental interleukin-1 may act as an inflammatory mediator, leading to systemic and local changes at fetomaternal interface and activating fetomaternal immune systems against intrauterine infection.\r"

The pulsatility index of the femoral artery increased linearly with advancing gestation in all 12 fetuses; this was associated with reverse diastolic flow velocity waveforms. In 30 other normal fetuses (group 1B) whose gestational ages ranged between 16 and 38 weeks (mean +/- SD, 29.5 +/- 5.6 weeks), the femoral artery flow velocity waveforms were analyzed with the external iliac artery, internal iliac artery, and umbilical artery waveforms. No significant difference was observed between the pulsatility index of the external iliac artery and that of the femoral artery (mean +/- SD, 3.7 +/- 1.1 vs 3.7 +/- 1.1). The pulsatility index of the internal iliac artery was significantly higher than that observed in the umbilical artery (mean +/- SD, 1.27 +/- 0.28 vs 1.12 +/- 0.23). The femoral and umbilical artery velocity waveforms also were determined in 20 fetuses with intrauterine growth retardation (group 2), whose gestational ages ranged between 24 and 36 weeks (mean +/- SD, 31 +/- 3.4 weeks). Abnormal femoral artery pulsatility index was recorded in two fetuses who died. Absent or reverse flow of the umbilical artery was recorded in 10 fetuses; four of them died, and four others manifested fetal distress or required admission to the neonatal intensive care unit or both. These preliminary data suggest that the femoral artery pulsatility index cannot be used as an indicator of adverse fetal outcome, whereas absent or reverse flow of the umbilical artery seems to be better correlated with adverse fetal outcome.\r"

Twin birth weight distribution was skewed with 48% of white and 63% of black twins born weighing less than 2500 gm. Overall infant mortality rates were 47.1 and 79.3 deaths per 1000 live births for white and black twins, respectively (five times the rates for singletons). Three fourths of deaths were among twins weighing less than 1500 gm. White like-gender twins had about twice the risk of both twins dying compared with unlike-gender twins. Likewise, white twin pairs with greater than 25% birth weight disparity had a 40% to 80% increased risk of both twins dying, compared with twins whose weights were within 10% of each other. Twins born to high-risk women (on the basis of demographic factors) were twice as likely to die as twins born to low-risk women. Thus strategies to decrease twin infant mortality must address both maternal and infant risk factors.\r"

Twenty-four women were or became pregnant while having an acute hepatitis B infection. Five pregnancies ended in abortion. The remaining 19 pregnancies ended in the birth of 24 children.

Some of these tests are simple, whereas others are invasive; some have been studied extensively, while others are still under clinical investigation. A review of the literature indicates considerable disagreement regarding the sensitivity and predictive values of the various tests studied. The reported differences in the predictive values of these tests may be attributed to one or more of the following: populations studied, definition and prevalence of the disorder, techniques and methodology used in performing these tests, etc. As a result, there is disagreement regarding the ideal screening test to be used for identifying patients for clinical trials dealing with prevention of the disorder.\r"

We examined the effect of meclofenamate administration on renal blood flow in chronically catheterized fetal sheep during normoxia and during moderate and severe hypoxia. Ten fetal sheep were made hypoxic twice at least 4 days after surgery: once in the presence and once in the absence of meclofenamate infusion. Renal blood flow and combined ventricular output were measured with radioactive microspheres. Prostaglandin synthesis blockade with meclofenamate caused no significant change in blood pressure, combined ventricular output, renal blood flow, or renal vascular resistance in either the normoxic or hypoxic animals. These data challenge the contention that prostaglandin activity protects the renal vascular bed of the fetus from vasoconstriction during hypoxia and they also do not support the hypothesis that prostaglandin synthesis inhibition causes oligohydramnios through reduction of fetal renal blood flow.\r"

The microvascular endothelium, a focal point for both initiation and inhibition of coagulation and control of vascular tone, may well contribute to development and aggravation of these abnormalities. We describe a method for isolation, purification, and culture of human decidual endothelial cells from biopsies performed at the time of cesarean section. The separation procedure is technically simple, requires only a small piece of tissue, and takes approximately 2 hours to perform. Some of the unique features of these cells in culture are outlined. This technique will permit the close examination of various aspects of the function of these cells in normal pregnancy, and their comparison with cells from pregnancies complicated by hypertension.\r"

There was agreement that women destined for preterm delivery have more uterine activity on average than do other women of comparable gestational age but that there is substantial overlap between the two groups. Thus it is uncertain whether this difference can be used effectively for screening purposes. Conferees agreed that there is considerable evidence that twice-daily monitoring of very-high-risk women, in conjunction with daily nursing support and high-quality obstetric care, may prevent preterm births. Available evidence does not clearly distinguish the contribution of tocodynamometry from that of nursing support. A number of areas were identified in which further research is needed.\r"

Endometriosis is a disease originating from the normal endometrium, specifically from its basal layer. Internal endometriosis (adenomyosis) is caused mainly by direct invasion of the endometrium into the spaces located in the connective tissue of the muscle layer. Serous and ovarian types of endometriosis are frequently found together with adenomyosis. Endometrial fragments in vessels are detected in 4.5% of cases of endometriosis. Observation of serial sections proved that serous endometriosis is caused mainly by continuous or semicontinuous invasion of the tunica muscularis spaces primarily from adenomyosis lesions and partly from the endometrium. Confirmation of lymph flow into the ovary from the uterine body strongly suggests that ovarian endometriosis arises as a consequence of vascular (lymphatic) transport of endometrial fragments from adenomyosis lesions, serous endometriosis lesions, or the endometrium.\r"

These women were further subdivided into two groups: the stage Ia group in which implants were found in one area (25 women) and the stage Ib group in which implants were found in two or more areas (29 women). In both groups the most frequent site was the uterosacral ligaments followed by the posterior uterine serosa, the posterior cul-de-sac, and the posterior broad ligaments in that order. Regardless of the position of the uterus, endometriosis was found significantly more frequently in the posterior compartment. The finding that the most frequent implants on the uterosacral ligaments were near the tubal ostium and, in the stage Ia group, the absence of implants on the anterior uterine serosa but a 33% frequency on the posterior uterine serosa, which is more frequently exposed to menstrual blood, suggest that implantation of endometriosis is the result of retrograde menstruation. However, the possibility that metaplasia of the serosal epithelium is stimulated by menstrual blood cannot be ruled out, inasmuch as the process of implantation in the peritoneum has not yet been proved.\r"

It affects not only the pelvic organs but also the right-sided thoracic organs and rarely the extremities. It occurs in men who are castrated and treated with estrogen. The affected sites in both common and uncommon endometriosis include cells arising from the coelomic membrane and sites exposed to metaplasia-inducing substances such as estrogen and unknown factors liberated from the degenerating endometrium. This appears to strengthen the coelomic metaplasia theory, although additional basic and experimental data must still be accumulated to confirm this theory.\r"

Studies on the development of the coelomic cavity and the mullerian duct, as well as expression of CA 125 during the fetal period and in the adult, strongly suggest that coelomic epithelium-related tissues and mullerian-derived epithelia of the adult have a shared embryologic ancestry. Many manifestations of mullerian-directed metaplasia suggest that tissues derived from the coelomic epithelium and its accompanying mesenchymal cells, referred to as the \"secondary mullerian system,\" have the potentiality to differentiate into mullerian-directed epithelium and stroma. This metaplastic potentiality of the secondary mullerian system constitutes a basic concept in the pathogenesis of endometriosis.\r"

The parameters that correlated with dysmenorrhea were the number of islands of adenomyosis and glands, distance of invasion, relative rate of invasion, and CA 125 levels.

It is concluded that vaginal delivery, irrespective of the position of the second twin, is valid in selected cases as long as fetal weight is greater than 1500 gm and the gestational age is greater than or equal to 32 weeks.\r"

Thus elucidation of the mechanisms involved in the development of the disease would contribute to improved management and treatment and prophylaxis of this lesion. A mouse model, in which ectopic pituitary isografting is associated with an increase in the plasma level of prolactin, is useful for a rapid and frequent induction of uterine adenomyosis and can be used to study the origin of this lesion.\r"

The unadjusted relative risk estimate of placenta previa for women reported to have \"ever smoked\" during pregnancy relative to nonsmoking mothers was 1.9 (95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 3.0). The risk rose after adjusting for potential confounders (odds ratio, 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 5.5). In contrast to a previous report, the duration of smoking was not an independent risk factor for placenta previa. These results suggest that cigarette smoking during pregnancy is a determinant of placenta previa. Carbon monoxide hypoxemia, which is one possible mechanism for this association, may result in compensatory placental hypertrophy. Placentas with increased surface areas are more likely to cover the cervical os, causing placenta previa.\r"

The mean number of drugs used by all subjects was 1.3 and, among drug users, 2.9. Of all drugs used, 68% were over-the-counter and 32% were prescription preparations. Internal analgesics, autonomic drugs, antiinfective agents, and antacids were most frequently used. Women who used prescription drugs were also more likely to use over-the-counter medications. Maternal characteristics that were associated with an increase in both over-the-counter and prescription drug use were being white, smoking more than 20 cigarettes a day, using alcohol, using caffeine, and smoking marijuana. These findings suggest that women who engage in \"risk-taking behavior\" during pregnancy are also more likely to use medications while pregnant.\r"

We used pregnancy (N = 2899) as the unit of analysis and a modified conditional logistic regression to estimate a pairwise odds ratio as a measure of the recurrence of ectopic pregnancy. Among the second or higher order of pregnancy, the recurrence was 21.7%. For pregnancies with a prior uterine pregnancy, the ectopic pregnancy rate increased with prior salpingitis scores constructed from a combination of prior salpingitis episodes and severity (0 score, 2.7%; 1 to 2 scores, 4.8%; and greater than or equal to 3 scores, 12.1%). For those with a prior ectopic pregnancy, the rate did not increase with prior salpingitis scores (score 0, 20.0%; score 1 or 2, 19.2%; and score greater than or equal to 3, 26.9%). The adjusted pairwise odds ratio was 2.2 and was practically unchanged (2.1) after additional adjustment with prior salpingitis scores. These findings confirm salpingitis as a risk factor for first ectopic pregnancy, but once a woman had an ectopic pregnancy, previous salpingitis might not add any incremental risk.\r"

In spite of a normal activated partial thromboplastin time in all instances, lupus anticoagulant was further investigated by three additional procedures: tissue thromboplastin inhibition time, platelet neutralization procedure, and cephalin neutralization test. The prevalence of autoantibodies in pregnancies with hypertension reaches 16% (four with lupus anticoagulant, two with anticardiolipin, and two with antithyroid microsomal antibodies), which is significantly greater than that for idiopathic fetal growth retardation (2%) (one with lupus anticoagulant antibodies) and normal pregnancies (3%) (two with antithyroglobulin and one with autithyroid microsomal antibodies) (p less than 0.01). Autoantibodies were equally distributed between patients with gestational hypertension and those with preeclampsia. When compared with the 42 patients with hypertension and no autoantibodies, the eight patients with autoantibody had a more frequent history of fetal growth retardation (p less than 0.05), but there was no difference in the severity of hypertension, the frequency of obstetric complications, or the outcome of pregnancy.

The recordings were used to evaluate a system for automated fetal heart rate analysis (Sonicaid System 8000). Fetal rest-activity patterns were considered in the analysis. The mean duration of C2F periods \"active sleep,\" 33 minutes) was significantly greater than that of C1F periods (\"quiet sleep,\" 19 minutes) (p less than 0.001). The incidence of accelerations and decelerations and the overall fetal heart rate variations were greater during C2F than during C1F (p less than 0.001). In 11 of 16 C1F periods, the system classified the fetal heart rate variation as \"questionable\" or \"abnormal.\" Episodes of high variation were identified in only 3 of 16 C1F periods, but they were found in all 18 C2F periods. Episodes of low variation were identified in 14 of the 16 C1F periods but were not found in any C2F periods. During C2F periods, the system's criteria of normality were met in all cases but one; they were not met during any of the C1F periods. Thus the diagnosis of fetal distress should not be based merely on the absence of accelerations, low fetal heart rate variation, or absence of episodes of high variation in recordings with a duration of less than 45 minutes.\r"

One hundred twenty-five Papanicolaou smears from women who were screened for human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid were sent routinely to a private laboratory for diagnoses. These slides were then reviewed independently by two pathologists who were blinded to the human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid results. The effects of cytologic rescreening in cases of both positive and negative human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid were assessed by calculating z scores. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia was diagnosed in 40% by pathologist A and in 20% by pathologist B of the human papillomavirus-positive subjects compared with none diagnosed by the private cytology laboratory (z = 3.09, p less than 0.005 and z = 1.98, p less than 0.05, respectively). No significant differences were found in the human papillomavirus-negative group.

Two tests, serum CA 125 and pelvic ultrasonography, have been suggested by some to be accurate enough to be included in yearly screening for ovarian cancer. Although further testing of these techniques is encouraged, data to date do not justify yearly screening with CA 125 or pelvic ultrasonography in all women.\r"

We addressed this possibility in the guinea pig, the small laboratory animal whose reproductive physiology most resembles that of women. Daily administration of the antiprogestin RU 486 (0, 1, 2, or 3 mg/kg, subcutaneously) for 9 days after mating inhibited implantation in a dose-dependent fashion. When this compound was given daily throughout the estrous cycle, cyclic vaginal changes, ovulation, and mating were suppressed in up to 17%, 28%, and 55% of animals, respectively. Two of seven mated female animals receiving RU 486, 1 mg/kg/day, had implantation sites. Nidation was completely blocked at higher doses. Thus daily antiprogestin administration prevented pregnancy in sexually active, normally cycling guinea pigs. A similar strategy using a daily antinidatory dose of an antiprogestin may offer a novel approach to human fertility control.\r"

(2) Operative time in emergency cases was significantly longer than in elective cases (105 +/- 38 vs 83 +/- 27 minutes, p = 0.003). (3) The incidence of transfusion was 68% in our emergency cases and 14.6% in the elective series (p less than 0.05). (4) Febrile morbidity in our series was 40% in emergency cases and 18.3% in elective cases (p less than 0.05). Our series was comparable to previous series reported. Our experience suggests that cesarean hysterectomy can be performed safely in a residency training program when done as an elective procedure in the well-prepared patient.\r"

This means that although anembryonic pregnancy shares characteristics with complete hydatidiform mole and androgenetic development in the mouse in that there is no embryo, it does not arise by the same genetic process. Of three anembryonic pregnancies that were successfully karyotyped, two had normal female 46,XX chromosome constitutions and one had an abnormal 47,XX + 16 complement. The sex of the trophoblast in each anembryonic pregnancy was determined with a deoxyribonucleic acid probe with Y-specific bands. A male-to-female ratio of 6:8 was found, which is not significantly different from normal.\r"

The PCR was capable of detecting virus at a 10(-4) dilution for both HSVI and HSVII, when the corresponding TCID50 endpoints were 10(-5.9) and 10(-5.7), respectively. The ELISA detected virus only down to the 10(-1) dilution. The amplification procedure showed the greatest sensitivity when an initial protease digestion was followed by filtration. The PCR may have use in detection of HSV in clinical situations in which a rapid result is desirable.\r"

A 69% +/- 5% stenosis was produced with a U-shaped metal clip. One month to 8 months later, the aorta was studied en face by light microscopy after fixation and lipid staining. The intima in the throat of the stenosis was almost completely free of lipid, whereas symmetric lipid deposits occurred as bands just above and especially just below the stenosis; elsewhere lipid deposits appeared to be random. The flow data obtained from the scale model showed that the intima in the throat of the stenosis was subjected to an increase of as much as 20 times in shear stress, whereas the lipid deposits just above and just below the stenosis were associated with asymmetric flow conditions: the proximal area corresponded to a region of rapidly increasing shear stress, the distal area to a region of low to normal shear stress and separated flow. A finite element computer model based on the aortic deformations indicated that the endothelium at the inlet and outlet of the stenosis is subjected to a symmetric pattern of elevated stresses and strains. These results indicate that 1) the pattern of lipid deposition can not be adequately explained by a hypothesis based solely on flow conditions, and 2) lipid deposits can develop in areas of increased fluid shear stress, decreased fluid shear stress, and increased intimal strains.\r"

Its action is mediated by a specific cell surface transmembrane glycoprotein, nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR). In this study, NGFR expression by human fetal and adult adrenal medullary tissue, peripheral nervous system (PNS) neuroectodermal tumors (neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroblastoma, ganglioneuroma), pediatric primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs) of the central nervous system (CNS), and CNS gliomas was examined by an immunohistochemical technique. Sixty-nine tumors in total were probed in this manner. Nerve growth factor receptor immunoreactivity was confined to nerve fibers and clusters of primitive-appearing cells in the fetal adrenal, and to nerve fibers and ganglion cells of the adult adrenal medulla; adrenal chromaffin cells were negative. In PNS neuroectodermal tumors, there was NGFR expression in tumor cells of 6 of 11 neuroblastomas and 6 of 6 ganglioneuroblastomas or ganglioneuromas. Thirteen of thirty-five CNS PNETs showed NGFR positivity. In most CNS PNETs, NGFR was restricted to scattered single or small groups of cells, but two tumors with astroglial differentiation showed much more extensive immunoreactivity. Most astrocytomas (11 of 14) and all ependymomas (3 of 3) were intensely NGFR positive.\r"

Immunoreactive TGF-alpha was detected in 16 (84.2%) of 19 colorectal cancers. In contrast, there was no IR-TGF-alpha in the gland cells of normal mucosa. Immunoreactive EGF was detected in 7 (36.8%) of 19 colorectal cancers and 1 (8.3%) of 12 cases of normal mucosa. The production of both IR-TGF-alpha and IR-EGF in colorectal cancer did not differ by histologic type and Dukes' stage. Immunoreactive TGF-alpha was detected at significantly higher incidence than IR-EGF in colorectal cancer. These results indicate that IR-TGF-alpha should prove valuable as a possible tumor marker in colorectal cancers, and it may be very useful in understanding the biology of colorectal cancer.\r"

The author examined the expression of the EGFR using immunohistochemistry and three anti-EGFR antibodies with different fine specificities. These were applied to frozen sections from 120 tissue biopsies, including normal and neoplastic urothelium. The expression of blood group A, B, H determinants was also evaluated in the same tissues. Significant differences were noted, depending on the fine specificity of the anti-EGFR antibody, cellular differentiation, and the tissue donor's blood group. The most interesting finding was a reciprocal relationship between the reaction patterns obtained using antibodies with carbohydrate specificity and those with peptide specificity. These patterns were characteristic of cellular differentiation and suggested that the EGFR peptide determinants are detected in excess in immature and malignant cells that, however, appear deficient in oligosaccharide determinants. The combination of 'loss' of blood group antigen and an apparent overexpression of EGFR peptide determinants is indicative of invasive growth in transitional cell carcinomas.\r"

These pigs bear the Lpb5 and Lpu1 mutant alleles for apolipoproteins B and U and demonstrate spontaneously elevated cholesterol levels, due primarily to elevated LDL. By 1 year of age, IHLC pigs exhibited focal lesions in the major coronary, iliac, and femoral arteries that were composed of macrophage-derived from cells and smooth muscle cells. Peripheral arterial lesions were more fibrous than those found in the coronaries. By 2 years of age, complicated stenotic lesions containing fibrous caps, necrotic cores, cholesterol clefts, granular calcium deposits, and neovascularization deep within the lesion were common in the major coronary vessels. Peripheral vascular lesions were more smooth muscle cell-rich and fibrotic. By 3 years of age, neovascularization was observed throughout the intimal lesion, and hemorrhage and rupture were common. The extent of complicated lesion formation correlated with both the degree and duration of hypercholesterolemia, with the most stenotic lesions observed in the coronary arteries of the oldest animals having the highest cholesterol levels. Thus IHLC pigs with mutant apolipoproteins B and U develop complicated atherosclerotic plaques that closely resemble advanced atherosclerotic lesions found in humans.\r"

To address these issues, the authors performed morphologic and immunocytochemical analyses of reproductive tissues obtained at autopsy from 43 male acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. Monoclonal antibodies recognizing different subpopulations of white blood cells were used to detect leukocyte infiltration and map the location of potential lymphocytic/monocytic HIV-1 host cells and immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization techniques were used to detect HIV-1-infected cells in the testis, excurrent ducts, and prostate. Distinct pathologic changes were observed in a majority of testes of AIDS patients that included azoospermia, hyalinization of the boundary wall of seminiferous tubules, and lymphocytic infiltration of the interstitium. The reproductive excurrent ducts and prostate appeared morphologically normal except for the presence of focal accumulations of white blood cells in the connective tissue stroma. In the testis many white blood cells were shown to be CD4+, indicating the presence of abundant host cells (T-helper/inducer lymphocytes and macrophages) for HIV-1. Furthermore macrophages and cells of lymphocytic morphology were observed migrating across the boundary walls of hyalinized seminiferous in tubules to enter the lumen. In 9 of the 23 cases tested for HIV-1 protein expression by immunocytochemistry. HIV-1 + cells of lymphocytic/monocytic morphology were found in the seminiferous tubules and interstitium of the testis, epididymal epithelium, and connective tissue of the epididymis and prostate. One patient with epididymal blockage had accumulations of HIV-1-antigen-positive cells of macrophages morphology in the distended lumen of the efferent ducts. There was no evidence of active HIV-1 infection in germ cells or Sertoli cells of the seminiferous tubules or other epithelial cells lining the excurrent ducts or prostatic glands.\r"

The authors have previously shown that heparin and heparan sulfate inhibit glomerular visceral epithelial cell (GEC) growth and that epidermal growth factor (EGF) can partially reverse the effect of heparin. The authors studied EGF processing by GEC in an attempt to clarify the mechanism by which heparin inhibits GEC growth. Control and heparin-treated GEC rapidly internalized 125I-EGF (within 15 minutes). In heparin-treated cells, 125I-EGF reappeared on the cell surface during the course of a 1-hour incubation and the percent internalized dropped significantly to 59.0% +/- 8.6%, suggesting recycling of 125I-EGF-occupied receptors. After incubation with 125I-EGF, heparin-treated cells also released significantly more cpm of 125I into EGF-free medium (2526 +/- 68 cpm-H; 903 +/- 32-C). Analysis of the released 125I by gel filtration chromatography showed more totally degraded 125I-EGF in media from heparin-treated cells (30.8% +/- 1.6% in heparin-treated versus 17.8% +/- 3.2 in control; P less than 0.05). Analysis of EGF-induced dimerization of receptors showed no effect of heparin on this ratio. These studies suggest that heparin decreases GEC response to EGF by accelerating its uptake and degradation. Matrix alterations in disease states may thus play a role in altering cell responsiveness to growth factors.\r"

E-cadherin was strongly expressed in all normal epithelium examined. However E-CD expression in primary tumors of esophagus (11 of 15: 73%), stomach (5 of 20: 25%), and breast (9 of 20: 45%) was reduced, and 68% of these (esophagus: 8 of 11, stomach: 4 of 5, breast: 5 of 9) displayed heterogeneous E-CD expression. In some tumor cells with reduced E-CD expression, E-CD molecules were located in the cell cytoplasm. These results indicate that there are human cancer cells in which E-CD-related intercellular adhesion is impaired.\r"

Oral infection of germ-free mice with Salmonella typhimurium aroA- caused a twofold to threefold increase in M cell numbers, crypt depth, and enterocyte migration rate after 7 days. These changes were accompanied by a twofold increase in follicle-associated epithelial tissue (FAE)-associated CD4+ and a threefold decrease in FAE-associated CD8+ counts. Salmonella also increased M-cell numbers shortly after infection. Other effects on crypt size and spleen weight took longer to develop. Salmonella probably creates M cells by changing the local subepithelial immune environment in the lymphoid follicle.\r"

DNA in situ hybridization, and lectin histochemistry with electron microscopy. Diffuse-staining components of the EBV early antigen complex (EA-D), EBV 150-kd capsid antigen (VCA), EBV membrane antigen (gp350/220), and double-stranded DNA were labeled with monoclonal antibodies. An EBV-DNA probe was used to locate EBV DNA. Wheat-germ agglutinin (WGA) was employed to distinguish Golgi-associated compartments. The authors found EBV proteins and EBV DNA only in keratinocytes with apparent viral assembly. In situ hybridization showed EBV DNA in free corelike material and in electron-dense cores of mature nucleocapsids. Monoclonal antibodies to nonspecific double-stranded DNA attached to the same structures and to marginated chromatin. Components of EA-D were dispersed throughout the nuclei but accumulated near condensed chromatin and in 'punched-out' regions of the chromatin. Epstein-Barr virus 150-kd capsid antigen was found only in the nuclei, where it appeared preferentially on mature nucleocapsids. As yet unexplained arrays of intranuclear particles that remained unlabeled with all EBV-specific probes reacted intensely with an antiserum against common papillomavirus antigen. Gp350/220 was detectable in various cellular membrane compartments and was highly concentrated on EBV envelopes in peripheral Golgi-associated secretory vesicles. It was less abundant on the extracellular EBV, indicating that viral membrane antigen partly dissociates from the mature virus. Combined lectin-binding histochemistry and electron microscopy demonstrated for the first time that EBV is processed in the Golgi apparatus, which eventually releases the virus by fusion with the plasma membrane. These results provide insight into the biologic events that occur during complete EBV replication in vivo.\r"

Treatment with thrombin (0.01 to 10 units/ml), endotoxin (0.01 to 10 micrograms/ml), or interleukin-1 (0.01 to 3.0 units/ml), however, caused significant, dose-dependent increases in E92 detectable in the culture supernatants. Time-course experiments showed that maximum release of E92 into cellular supernatants occurred 24 hours after stimulation with all mediators. Parallel experiments used 51Cr-loaded endothelial cells as a measure of lethal cellular injury. None of the mediators caused significant injury at the doses observed to induce release of E92. These results suggest that the release of E92 into the supernatants of cultured endothelial cells is an inducible event. The data also support the hypothesis that detection of E92 antigen in sera from patients with rheumatic disease represents a marker of in vivo vascular endothelial cell activity.\r"

  ".W": "A number of changes occur in contractile proteins and mechanical performance of the heart within 2 weeks of right ventricular pressure overload in 8- to 12-week-old rabbits. These changes are accompanied by increases in collagen concentration and the ratio of type I to type III collagen. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the evolution of these connective tissue changes morphologically and to characterize the interstitial cells that might be responsible. The myocardium is infiltrated by mononuclear inflammatory cells 2 days after banding, accompanied by focal myocyte necrosis. By 7 days, the inflammatory infiltrates subside and the damaged myocytes seen at 2 days are replaced by new collagen and a population of spindle-shaped cells, with ultrastructural features of myofibroblasts. A significant proportion of these cells contain alpha smooth muscle actin by immunohistochemical analysis. At 14 days, there is a large increase in stainable collagen with complex remodeling and reduplication of the collagen fiber network of the interstitium. Alpha smooth muscle actin-containing myofibroblasts persist, but their immunoreactivity appears reduced compared with day 7. The authors hypothesize that the interstitial fibroblasts that acquire smooth-muscle-like features in this model play a critical role in the heart's response to severe and sudden mechanical stress and are at least partly responsible for the changes in connective tissue that occur as a result of pressure overload in this model.\r"

Nevertheless the initial hepatic response is a prompt, florid proliferation of peroxisomes. In investigations reported here, changes in the rat hepatic peroxisome compartment were measured by quantitative microscopy to determine chemical structure requirements that relate to peroxisome proliferation and lipid regulation. Aryloxyalkanoic acids plus amide analogs, and thio, benzimidazole, phenylpiperazine, and oxazole derivatives induced peroxisome proliferation and generally decreased plasma triglyceride and total cholesterol levels. These compounds contain an acidic function or are readily metabolized to a chemical with an acidic function. Substitution of the acidic function with an adamantyloxy eliminated peroxisome proliferation and induced contrasting effects on lipid profile, increasing triglycerides and decreasing total cholesterol. A previously unreported, direct correlation emerged between peroxisome proliferation and plasma high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels. These effects could not be elicited separately, negating identification of functional groups that could be associated with either activity. Chemical structure and resulting peroxisome proliferation with changes in plasma lipoproteins are therefore closely interrelated in rats.\r"

SV40Tag-activated replication gives rise to two different preneoplastic alterations in hepatocytes, which are characterized in detail: 1) dysplasia and finally cell death in the original hepatocyte population and 2) amplification of periportal transitional hepatocytes leading to multifocal hyperplasia and hepatocellular carcinoma. Multifocal hyperplasia, most probably the equivalent of SV40Tag-immortalization, grows confluent and leads to hepatomegaly. SV40Tag-independent, secondary events are necessary for the tumor development from confluent hyperplasia. This allows further investigation of the steps involved in malignant transformation and progression during hepatocarcinogenesis in vivo.\r"

This question was addressed by polymerase chain reaction analysis of TCR alpha chain variable (V) region gene expression in intratumoral T lymphocytes from three cases of small cleaved follicular center cell lymphoma. In all three cases studied, the tumor-associated T cells showed unrestricted expression of all 18 alpha-chain V region genes. These findings imply that the T cells admixed with the neoplastic B cells of small cleaved follicular center cell lymphomas are not recruited based on TCR recognition of a single or limited number of tumor-related antigens.\r"

Molecularly cloned simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)mac239 replicates very poorly in cultured macrophages yet it causes AIDS in rhesus monkeys. Three of five rhesus monkeys that died with AIDS following SIVmac239 infection showed no disease manifestations directly associated with macrophage infection, such as encephalitis and granulomatous interstitial pneumonia. Simian immunodeficiency virus recovered from the peripheral blood of these three animals at or near the time of death replicated very poorly if at all in cultured macrophages, and tissues taken at autopsy showed little or no infection of macrophages by immunohistochemical staining. However two of the five rhesus monkeys that died with AIDS following SIVmac239 infection displayed a characteristic SIV-related meningoencephalitis and/or granulomatous pneumonia, lesions associated with macrophage infection. Simian immunodeficiency virus recovered from the peripheral blood of these two animals near the time of death replicated extremely well in cultured macrophages, indicating the emergency of macrophage-tropic variants in vivo. Furthermore tissues taken at autopsy from these two showed many infected macrophages by immunohistochemical staining. These results indicate that AIDS and death can occur without obvious involvement of macrophage infection. However the presence of macrophage-tropic viral strains appears to influence the disease course and disease manifestations.\r"

Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), vimentin, desmin, neurofilaments, and broad-specificity keratin MAbs, as well as MAbs that recognize several or only single keratin polypeptides, were used. Unexpected reactivities were surprisingly frequent. As these may lead to diagnostic confusion and misinterpretation on this material, the authors investigated these phenomena more thoroughly. Four major sources of artifactual staining were found: 1) positive staining attributable to the rabbit gamma G immunoglobulins used in the alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase technique; 2) certain desmin and keratin MAbs cross-reacted with astrocytic glia and with other brain-specific epitopes; 3) technical difficulties; 4) some MAbs directed against neurofilaments and keratins showed unexpected reactivities only on individual anaplastic gliomas. The implications of these findings for intermediate filament typing of neuropathologic material are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), which is produced by germinal center dendritic reticulum cells (DRC) in lymphoid tissue, plays a regulatory role in a local immune response. However no information is available on the nature and location of cells responding to this cytokine. Thus TNF receptor distribution was investigated in situ by immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies directed against the p75 and p55 receptor proteins. Receptor expression was unique and restricted to the lymphoreticular tissue. The p75 receptor was found on activated lymphocytes and interdigitating reticulum cells of the T-cell area, whereas the p55 receptor was confined to the germinal center DRCs, which are the main site of TNF alpha production. The two receptor proteins were expressed on distinct cell populations of the lymphoid system and no coexpression was observed. Preliminary results indicate that TNF receptor (TNFR) expression is regulated; Upregulation of TNFR proteins was found in reactive hyperplasia together with increased TNF alpha expression. In lymphoproliferative disorders, expression of the p75 receptor and TNF alpha was found mainly in high-grade malignant non-Hodgkin lymphomas. In summary, TNF alpha produced by germinal center DRCs might regulate an in vivo immune response through autocrine and paracrine pathways. Thus TNF alpha might signal, through the distinct TNFR proteins, the p55 and p75 receptor, which are expressed on different cell types in lymphoid tissue.\r"

Activated leukocytes can cause microvascular occlusions and cell damage by release of cytotoxic products. To explore the role of leukocytes in capillary occlusion, nonperfusion, and neovascularization of diabetic retinopathy, a rat model was used, in which a diabetic state was induced by alloxan. Retina flat preparations were differentially stained for monocytes and granulocytes. Capillary occlusion, nonperfusion, and neovascularization were assessed microscopically in the center, midperiphery, and periphery of the retina. In contrast to control retinas, 2- to 9-month diabetic rats showed many capillary occlusions by leukocytes, especially monocytes, endothelial cell damage, extravascular macrophage accumulation, and tissue damage. The percentage of activated monocytes and granulocytes in the circulating blood of diabetic rats was greatly increased, and areas of capillary 'loss' and neovascularization in the retina coincided with sites of extravascular leukocytes. The authors' results suggest a potential role of monocytes and macrophages in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy.\r"

The authors' goal, therefore, was to look at 5-HT function in depression using the d isomer of fenfluramine as a probe. METHOD: They evaluated central 5-HT function in 23 patients with DSM-III-R-diagnosed major depression and 16 healthy control subjects. The depressed group included 10 men and 13 women; four were outpatients, two attended a day hospital facility, and 17 were inpatients. Subjects were cannulated at 8:30 a.m. after an overnight fast. After baseline samples were drawn, 30 mg of d-fenfluramine was administered orally and blood samples were drawn over the following 5-hour period for prolactin and cortisol estimation. RESULTS: The plasma prolactin responses of the depressed patients were significantly lower than those of the control subjects. This blunting was not related to the severity of the depression but was significantly related to the patients' levels of state anxiety. Cortisol responses as well as prolactin responses were impaired in depression. High baseline cortisol levels were correlated with the severity of depression and the presence of weight loss. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these findings indicate that there is diminished 5-HT responsivity in the depressed state.\r"

METHOD: Thirty-six women married to men with hemophilia were studied; the husbands of 17 of these women were HIV-seropositive. The men were drawn from the population of adults with hemophilia residing in a 24-county region of western Pennsylvania. Measures of wives' psychiatric symptoms were obtained, as were measures in three psychosocial domains: predispositional sociodemographic characteristics, psychosocial stressors, and husbands' strategies for coping. RESULTS: The psychiatric symptoms of the women did not differ as a function of their husbands' serostatus or across subgroups defined according to stages of HIV infection or clinical severity of hemophilia. Instead, other factors--perceptions of personal risk of AIDS, husbands' use of particular coping styles with respect to HIV infection, and the experience of other life events--were the principal correlates of psychiatric distress. CONCLUSIONS: HIV infection acted primarily as an indirect source of stress for these women, mediated by other psychosocial characteristics of both the women and their HIV-seropositive husbands. Mental health interventions for caregivers of HIV-seropositive individuals should target the identified psychosocial correlates of psychiatric distress.\r"

The behavioral, cognitive, and neurochemical changes observed following the cessation of heavy drinking, therefore, may be associated with disturbances of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. To investigate HPA axis disturbances during the ethanol withdrawal syndrome, the authors examined diurnal changes in plasma cortisol in six alcohol-dependent men following the abrupt discontinuation of alcohol intake. METHOD: Plasma cortisol concentrations were quantified every 30 minutes for 24 hours in the early stage (1 day after cessation) and the middle to late stage (3 days after cessation) of the ethanol withdrawal syndrome as well as after the resolution of acute symptoms (8 days or more after cessation). RESULTS: Plasma cortisol concentrations were almost twice as high during acute withdrawal as they were following recovery. The duration of the cortisol diurnal cycle on the first day of withdrawal was negatively correlated with the severity of withdrawal. CONCLUSIONS: There is a marked activation of the HPA axis associated with the ethanol withdrawal syndrome. The authors hypothesize that this activation may account for some of the signs and symptoms of acute and subacute withdrawal. They discuss the potential long-term physiological effects of the episodic increases in cortisol associated with repeated episodes of ethanol withdrawal. The alterations in cortisol rhythmicity during early withdrawal may also have clinical implications.\r"

METHOD: Three large and diverse samples of homeless patients (N = 512) were compared with a sample of patients who had never been homeless (N = 271), with respect to childhood experience of foster care, group home placement, and running away. One of the homeless samples and the never homeless sample were drawn from patients admitted to a state mental hospital. In this state hospital population, risk ratios for lifetime prevalence of homelessness could be derived. RESULTS: In the three homeless samples, over 15% had a history of foster care, over 10% had a history of group home placement, and over 20% had a history of running away. These figures compared with 2%, 1%, and 5%, respectively, in the never homeless sample. In the state hospital, the lifetime prevalence of homelessness in patients with any one of these childhood experiences was about threefold that of other patients. A history of homelessness was reported by the great majority of state hospital patients who had had one of these childhood experiences. CONCLUSIONS: These childhood experiences were strongly associated with adult homelessness in these psychiatric patients. It might be possible to prevent homelessness in some cases by interventions aimed at patients with such childhood histories.\r"

METHOD: Adult outpatients in a hospital's clinical psychopharmacology unit were asked to complete the Pediatric Symptom Checklist regarding their children. These patients were the parents of 100 school-aged children. Factors such as the parents' diagnoses and demographic variables were also examined. RESULTS: The Pediatric Symptom Checklist was readily accepted by parents and fit easily into the routine of general psychiatric practice. Significantly more of the children of these outpatients than of children in comparable pediatric offices had scores indicative of psychiatric dysfunction (scores above the cutoff). Children of parents who were single, of low socioeconomic status, or with a diagnosis of personality (especially borderline) or mood disorder were more likely to have scores above the cutoff. More than a third of the children who had scores above the cutoff on the Pediatric Symptom Checklist were not currently receiving psychiatric services. CONCLUSIONS: The Pediatric Symptom Checklist provided a rapid and simple method for general psychiatrists to identify psychosocial dysfunction in their patients' children.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: APA evaluated the Social Security Administration's (SSA's) medical standards and guidelines for determining disability due to mental impairment to determine how well the standards and guidelines operationalize the statutory definition of disability in a manner consistent with current psychiatric practice. METHOD: Seventy-two psychiatrists were trained in one of two procedures: those in the sequential evaluation condition were trained in the process and forms used by the SSA's reviewing medical consultants, and those in the statutory definition condition were trained in the statutory definition of disability and application of clinical judgment according to this standard. Decisions regarding claimant's ability or inability to work were recorded on an instrument designed for the study. Each condition consisted of 12 panels of three members. They reviewed 732 actual claims for disability benefits. The panelists reviewed claims independently, then rendered panel judgments. Each claim was reviewed by one panel in each condition. RESULTS: The proportion of agreement between conditions for panel decisions (0.77) was higher than chance agreement (kappa = 0.46). The high level of agreement on claims judged to have good medical evidence and on which confident decisions were made (proportion of agreement = 0.96, kappa = 0.78) suggests that disagreements largely reflected ambiguities in application of the standards and guidelines to more complex cases or those with inadequate information. CONCLUSIONS: The SSA's revised medical standards and guidelines reflect clinical decisions about ability to work based on the statute and, with procedural modifications, should be retained. The SSA should be involved in further systematic studies to develop a field of scientific inquiry into disability and psychiatric disorders.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: The authors hypothesized that psychiatric liaison screening of elderly patients with hip fractures would shorten the average length of hospital stay and increase the proportion of patients who returned home after discharge. METHOD: The study was performed at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York and Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. The subjects were 452 patients 65 years or older who were consecutively admitted for surgical repair of fractured hips. During a baseline year the patients received traditional referral for psychiatric consultation. During the experimental year all the patients at Mount Sinai and the patients on one Northwestern Unit were screened for psychiatric consultation. RESULTS: The patients who received psychiatric liaison screening had a higher consultation rate than those who received traditional consultation. The rates of DSM-III disorders in the experimental year were 56% at Mount Sinai and 60% at Northwestern. The mean length of stay was reduced from 20.7 to 18.5 days at Mount Sinai and from 15.5 to 13.8 days at Northwestern, resulting in reductions in hospital costs ($647/day) of $166,926 and $97,361, respectively. Fees generated from Medicare service delivery could have paid for the $20,000 psychiatric intervention cost at each site. There was no difference, however, between the two years in the discharge placement of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Admission psychiatric liaison screening of elderly patients with hip fractures results in early detection of psychiatric morbidity, better psychiatric care, earlier discharge, and substantial cost savings to the hospital.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE AND METHOD: Diagnosis and treatment of the dissociative disorders may be delayed for many years because of difficulties in detecting patients at high risk for dissociative disorders. This study investigates the utility of the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES), a self-report instrument for dissociative experiences, in detecting patients at high risk for dissociative disorders. The clinician-administered Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R Dissociative Disorders (SCID-D) was used as the diagnostic standard, and 36 outpatients with mixed diagnoses and nine normal subjects were evaluated for the presence and absence of a dissociative disorder. DES scores were then compared. RESULTS: Results indicate that a DES cutoff score of 15-20 yields good to excellent sensitivity and specificity as a screening instrument. However, for higher cutoff points the sensitivity can be much lower. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, although the DES can be used to identify some high-risk patients, they should be further evaluated with such diagnostic instruments as the SCID-D or by in-depth clinical follow-up.\r"

  ".U": "91307009\r", 
  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: Tardive dystonia, historically combined with tardive dyskinesia, is now viewed as probably having a different pathophysiology, course, outcome, and treatment response than tardive dyskinesia. In addition, patients with tardive dystonia are reported to be younger, and most are men. This study evaluates characteristics of 32 patients with tardive dystonia and compares results to other reports. METHOD: Twenty-four patients had been referred for research purposes and were videotaped, while eight had been followed clinically. Two of the authors reviewed all available videotapes and clinical reports to assess the course of symptoms over time. For global ratings and ratings of affected body parts, two scales were used: the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) for tardive dyskinesia and a similar scale for tardive dystonia. The method of case finding does not provide incidence or prevalence data for tardive dystonia. RESULTS: Fifty-nine percent of the patients experienced onset of tardive dystonia symptoms within 6 years of antipsychotic drug exposure; women had a shorter exposure time. No patient had complete remission of tardive dystonia symptoms, and 22 were moderately or severely impaired when their movements were most prominent. CONCLUSIONS: While epidemiological studies of tardive dystonia have yet to be performed, these results support the observations of others that most patients with tardive dystonia are men, have a short history of exposure to antipsychotic drugs, and may initially present with blepharospasm. Tardive dystonia rarely remits completely, can cause notable disability, and may partially respond to anticholinergic agents.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: This study examined the interaction between lithium and diuretics, comparing both the pharmacokinetic and the pharmacodynamic variable of hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide, and placebo. METHOD: The study, which took place in an outpatient research clinic of a university hospital, used a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design. The subjects were normal, healthy male volunteers who responded to recruitment announcements. Thirteen subjects entered and completed the study. All subjects took lithium, 300 mg b.i.d., for 6 weeks. Hydrochlorothiazide, 25 mg b.i.d.; furosemide, 20 mg b.i.d.; and placebo were given during weeks 2, 4, and 6 in a random order of assignment. Serum lithium levels and indices of diuretic activity were measured during each week. RESULTS: The subjects' serum lithium levels after 5 days of taking hydrochlorothiazide were significantly higher than after 5 days of taking furosemide and placebo. At the doses studied, hydrochlorothiazide was also more potent than furosemide in increasing plasma renin activity, increasing sodium excretion, and decreasing lithium excretion. CONCLUSIONS: The observed differences between diuretics in effects on serum lithium may have been due to differences in the potency of the diuretics at the doses studied as well as in the site of action of the diuretic effect. The results must be interpreted cautiously, however, because the effects were small and of questionable clinical significance, and the study used healthy volunteers and low doses of lithium instead of psychiatric patients and the usual therapeutic levels of lithium.\r"

In vivo MRS with 31P provides important information on brain phospholipid metabolism and energy production. In vivo 13C and 1H MRS can reveal information about carbohydrate, protein, and amino acid metabolism. In vivo 7Li and 19F MRS can be used to study the pharmacology of lithium and fluorinated psychopharmacological agents. MRS with 23Na can yield information about electrolyte balance. The limitations of in vivo MRS include poor sensitivity, poor resolution, and the fact that only highly mobile atomic nuclei can be detected. Future clinical application of MRS will benefit from improvements in the technology of localization, use of spectroscopy contrast agents, stronger magnets, and the merging of MRS and imaging technology.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: Kleptomania, or the irresistible impulse to steal unneeded objects, is a poorly understood disorder. The objectives of this paper are to critically review and integrate existing data and to make suggestions for further research. DATA COLLECTION: Information was gathered by reviewing the English-language literature on kleptomania. Cases were chosen for review that approximated the diagnosis as defined in DSM-III-R. These cases were analyzed in terms of their relationship to previous theories about the disorder, and larger relevant studies were examined. Using the data organized into a table, the author explores areas of convergence and disagreement and discusses the methodological difficulties of the different studies. FINDINGS: Kleptomania is more common than previously thought. The \"typical\" individual with kleptomania is a 35-year-old woman who began to steal when she was 20 years old. Her thefts bring both relief and guilt. She probably has not sought treatment on her own but suffers from a necessary, pervasive, repetitive, and self-destructive act. She may have a history of sexual dysfunction or sexual preoccupation and may be unhappily married to an emotionally unsupportive husband. She has been labile and dysphoric for many years and may have a personality disorder. She has probably had a tumultuous, stressful childhood and may dissociate. CONCLUSIONS: The author proposes a biopsychosocial model of the etiology of kleptomania based on data from the literature. This model emphasizes possible childhood abuse as a precipitating factor in later development of kleptomania. More complete research is needed in the study of kleptomania.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: The authors investigated patient characteristics predictive of treatment response in the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Treatment of Depression Collaborative Research Program. METHOD: Two hundred thirty-nine outpatients with major depressive disorder according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria entered a 16-week multicenter clinical trial and were randomly assigned to interpersonal psychotherapy, cognitive-behavior therapy, imipramine with clinical management, or placebo with clinical management. Pretreatment sociodemographic features, diagnosis, course of illness, function, personality, and symptoms were studied to identify patient predictors of depression severity (measured with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression) and complete response (measured with the Hamilton scale and the Beck Depression Inventory). RESULTS: One hundred sixty-two patients completed the entire 16-week trial. Six patient characteristics, in addition to depression severity previously reported, predicted outcome across all treatments: social dysfunction, cognitive dysfunction, expectation of improvement, endogenous depression, double depression, and duration of current episode. Significant patient predictors of differential treatment outcome were identified. 1) Low social dysfunction predicted superior response to interpersonal psychotherapy. 2) Low cognitive dysfunction predicted superior response to cognitive-behavior therapy and to imipramine. 3) High work dysfunction predicted superior response to imipramine. 4) High depression severity and impairment of function predicted superior response to imipramine and to interpersonal psychotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the relevance of patient characteristics, including social, cognitive, and work function, for prediction of the outcome of major depressive disorder. They provide indirect evidence of treatment specificity by identifying characteristics responsive to different modalities, which may be of value in the selection of patients for alternative treatments.\r"

The effectiveness of these strategies has not been systematically evaluated. METHODS: We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial comparing three strategies for control of Giardia in infant-toddler day care centers: Group 1, exclusion and treatment of symptomatic and asymptomatic infected children; Group 2, exclusion and treatment of symptomatic infection only; Group 3, exclusion and treatment of symptomatic infection, treatment of asymptomatic infection in the center. The study included 31 day care centers with 4180 child-months of observation. Giardia prevalence was determined before intervention and 1, 2, 4, and 6 months later; new infants and toddlers were tested on admission. RESULTS: Initial Giardia prevalences were 18% to 22% in the three groups. Giardia was identified in 10.5% of 676 new infants and toddlers entering study day care centers during the 6-month follow-up. Giardia prevalences by intervention group were 8%, 12%, and 7% at 1 month, and 7%, 8%, and 8% at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: The stricter intervention resulted in greater cost in terms of child day care and parents' work days lost, but did not result in significantly better control of Giardia infections in this day care environment.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND: Although maternal employment is considered a risk factor for low birthweight (LBW), the manner in which employment might affect birthweight is poorly understood. In this analysis, selected characteristics of employment during pregnancy were examined for effects on pregnancy outcomes. METHODS: Work characteristics included the number of hours per week, physical activities, and environmental conditions. The outcomes of interest were fetal growth retardation (less than 2500 grams at term) and preterm delivery (less than 37 weeks). The study population consisted of 2711 non-Black, married mothers who participated in the 1980 National Natality Survey (NNS). The NNS data were merged with data from the 1977 revision of The Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT) from which measures of occupational physical activities and environmental exposures were obtained. Logistic regression was used in the analysis. RESULTS: Those who worked 40 or more hours per week were more likely than women who worked fewer hours to have a low birthweight delivery at greater than or equal to 37 weeks. No physical or environmental characterics of work were associated with low birthweight or preterm delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Non-Black married American women may face a risk of delivering low-birthweight babies at or near term only if they work 40 or more hours each week. However, the lack of risk associated with other characteristics of work may be a function of measurement error in the DOT data source or of low levels of exposure in the analysis population.\r"

This study investigates the potential impact that completeness of reporting of prenatal care and gestational age variables and strategies to impute missing data may have on evaluations of the Medicaid expansion. METHODS: This study, examining 15 years of vital record data from a single state and comparing 1 year of data from four mid-Atlantic states, selected single live births to resident mothers for analyses. The \"day 15\" and the \"preceding case\" methods were used to impute missing gestational age data. RESULTS: Considerable temporal and geographic variation was detected in completeness of reporting of variables used to construct prenatal care indices. After imputing values for cases with missing data, the proportion of cases for which adequacy of prenatal care utilization could not be determined ranged from 3% to 24% among the states investigated. For those cases where gestational age data could be imputed, the distribution of prenatal care utilization was not markedly disparate from those cases with complete reporting of gestational age. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that variations in reporting, decisions regarding the treatment of missing data, and the choice of the denominator can alter prenatal care utilization percentages and have implications for evaluations of the impact of the recent Medicaid expansion on prenatal care utilization.\r"

The purpose of this study was to identify the factors that affect the amount of unpaid hospital charges for services provided to pregnant women. METHODS: Individual and hospital data were collected on a representative set of 235 pregnancy and childbirth patients with unpaid hospital charges from 28 hospitals in the state of Indiana. RESULTS: Most of these patients did not have insurance coverage (63.8%), yet the majority were employed in the public or private sector (72.3%). Over half (55.5%) of the total uncompensated care amount for this group was from the $1000 to 2499 debt category. The median charge for these patients was $1468, of which the typical hospital was able to collect only 25.5%. CONCLUSIONS: The findings support the belief that any national effort to expand the availability of health insurance coverage to women through increased employment will not totally eliminate the uncompensated care problem. The findings also indicate that rural hospitals face the uncompensated care problem mainly because a significant portion of rural patients are without adequate health insurance coverage.\r"

RESULTS: Distribution of the basic examinations in prenatal care vary according to marital status, parity, education, and residence in a metropolitan or nonmetropolitan county.

METHODS: A nationwide data base of medically diagnosed spontaneous abortions and other pregnancies and national census data was used to evaluate the effects of men's occupational exposures on risk of spontaneous abortion in 99,186 pregnancies in Finland. Census data from the years 1975 and 1980 provided information about the occupation, industry, and socioeconomic status. A job-exposure classification was developed to classify women and their husbands according to possible occupational exposures on the basis of their occupational title and industry. RESULTS: In 10% of the pregnancies, the husband was exposed to one or more of the mutagens, and the rate of spontaneous abortion was unaffected (OR = 1.0). Of the 25 specific mutagenic exposures evaluated, paternal exposure to four (ethylene oxide, rubber chemicals, solvents used in refineries, and solvents used in the manufacturing of rubber products) was associated with an increased relative risk of spontaneous abortion. In addition, the risk of spontaneous abortion was higher among wives of rubber products workers than among unexposed men. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is some biological rationale for the findings of this study, these findings need to be confirmed by studies in which individual exposures can be measured directly.\r"

METHODS: I analyzed 54 such deaths reported to me by 55 medical examiners and coroners in the United States and 104 deaths reported to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). RESULTS: Only seven of the 158 deaths analyzed occurred in saunas. All of the remaining deaths occurred in spas, jacuzzis, or hot tubs, which were far more numerous. The chief risk factors identified were alcohol ingestion, heart disease, seizure disorders, and cocaine ingestion (alone or in combination with alcohol ingestion). These factors accounted for 71 or 44.7% of the 159 fatalities. Of these risk factors, alcohol represented 38%; heart disease, 31%; seizure disorders, 17%; and cocaine ingestion, alone or in combination with alcohol, 14%. Sixty-one of the 151 spa-associated deaths occurred in children under 12 years of age. Accidental drownings from uncovered or improperly covered spas and, to a lesser extent, entrapment by suction, were the chief causes of childhood drownings. CONCLUSIONS: Children and older persons who have heart disease or seizure disorders or who use alcohol or cocaine are especially vulnerable. Recommended preventive measures include shortening the time of exposure, lowering the temperature, establishing safety standards for covers and for baffles for suction outlets, and using warning notices.\r"

Information on the distribution of TC:HDL-C in the US population is limited to selected populations and the relationship of the ratio distribution and its correlates has received little attention. METHOD: TC/HDL-C ratios were examined in a representative sample of the United States adult population ages 20 to 74 years, between February 1976 and February 1980 during NHANES II, using stratification and multivariate regression analyses. RESULTS: Age-adjusted mean ratios were higher in men compared with women and were higher in Whites compared with Blacks. White men had the highest TC/HDL-C mean ratios. These relationships remained after stratification by age, education, body mass index, alcohol use, cigarette smoking, and physical activity. Using multivariate analyses, the ratios were positively related to BMI, age, and smoking; and negatively related to female sex, alcohol use, being Black, and physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: Using a ratio reference point of greater than or equal to 4.5 from the Framingham study, at least an estimated 44 million persons ages 25 to 74 years in the US were found to be at higher risk of developing coronary heart disease.\r"

During the latter half of the study, bicycle safety received considerable media attention in Ottawa, and the provincial medical society sponsored a $5 discount campaign. Therefore both groups were subject to community \"co-intervention.\" Nonetheless, we were surprised that physician counseling made no additional impact. Our results and the success of certain community programs suggest that physicians interested in helmet promotion would do better to participate in the design and implementation of multidisciplinary campaigns.\r"

As a result of the study, the company hired additional staff to provide integrated maternal-child preventive health care and family planning and contracted for intensive training and periodic on-site supervision. In less than 2 years, vaccination coverage reached 75%, and virtually all children under age 1 were enrolled in growth monitoring. Prescriptions were reduced by 24%, including a 67% drop in antimicrobials. The cost of the new services was $13,200 for the first 2 years. Approximately $6800 has been saved in pharmaceuticals prescribed for respiratory infection and diarrhea. Recently, two more mines adopted maternal and child health and family planning services. It is hoped that cost-benefit arguments will encourage other companies to incorporate aggressive child survival measures into their health plans.\r"

The annual mean and the greatest half-hour concentrations of sulfur dioxide (23 and 807 micrograms/m3), particulates (31 and 291 micrograms/m3), nitrogen oxides (15 and 160 micrograms/m3), and hydrogen sulfide (2 and 177 micrograms/m3) in the polluted city were mainly due to industrial sources. In the reference cities, air pollution was produced mainly by traffic and heating. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) for one or more upper respiratory infections of residents in the polluted city vs those in the reference cities were 2.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.3-3.2) in the younger age group and 1.6 (95% CI = 1.1-2.1) in the older age group. Within the polluted city, OR calculated for living in more vs less polluted areas were 2.0 (95% CI = 1.0-4.0) in the younger and 1.6 (95% CI = 1.0-2.7) in the older children. The present results suggests that, for children, air pollution can be hazardous in concentrations lower than those recorded in earlier studies from Britain and central Europe. The synergistic effect of sulfur dioxide, particulates, nitrogen oxides, hydrogen sulfide, and other pollutants may be a contributing factor.\r"

Subjects were asked to recall all pregnancies they engendered (men) or carried (women), outcome, and intellectual development of resulting children. Matched female plumbism subjects reported a higher proportion of spontaneous abortion or stillbirths among pregnancies (relative risk = 1.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.6-4.0) and a higher proportion of learning disabilities among school-age children (relative risk = 3.0, 95% CI = 0.9-10.2) in comparison with their controls. There was no evidence of clustering of learning disabilities within families or confounding by parental educational level. These results suggest that women with a history of childhood lead poisoning may be at risk for having spontaneous abortions or stillbirths and having children who manifest significant learning disabilities.\r"

METHODS: The primary case-workers of 3398 children under the care of the state responded to a survey of the child's treatment history, social and clinical condition, and service needs. Service need data on the 2455 children in the sample who were classifiable as severely emotionally disturbed were examined using log linear analysis. RESULTS: School- and home-based services were frequently reported needs of school-aged children. Adolescent children were reported to be in need of services which prepare them for adulthood. Services endorsed for female children tended to focus on assistance to family members, therapy, and protection, whereas services endorsed for male children focused on home removal, substance abuse treatment, and preparation for employment. CONCLUSIONS: Severely emotionally disturbed children are in need of a variety of nontraditional mental health services. Significant differences in the needs of male versus female children, and of differently aged children, are present that have serious implications for service system development.\r"

With a mailed survey of state day care regulatory personnel, we examined the processes of formulating and implementing safety policy in 47 states. RESULTS: For 24 of the 36 items, more than half the states' regulations were below the criteria or failed to mention the topic. Most notable is the inattention to playground safety, choking hazards, and firearms. CONCLUSION: The uneven quality of regulations may be a reflection of a regulatory process that is fragmented, with many different groups sharing authority and with limited involvement of injury prevention specialists.\r"

We tested the effects of a school-based program to improve students' diet and physical activity behavior at school. METHODS: Two of the four elementary schools in one Texas school district were assigned to intervention and two to control conditions. The three intervention components were classroom health education, vigorous physical education, and lower fat, lower sodium school lunches. Nutrients from school lunches and the total day and the amount of physical activity students obtained during physical education were assessed as outcome. RESULTS: Analysis of school lunches showed declines from base line to posttest in the two intervention schools of 15.5% and 10.4% for total fat, 31.7% and 18.8% for saturated fat, and 40.2% and 53.6% for sodium; posttest values were lower in the intervention schools. Observation of physical activity during physical education classes indicated an increase in the intervention schools from baseline to posttest in the percent of time children engaged in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity from less than 10% of class time at baseline to about 40% of class time at posttest; posttest values were higher in the intervention schools than in the control schools. CONCLUSIONS: This efficacy study demonstrates the feasibility of substantially modifying school lunches and school physical education to improve children's diet and physical activity behavior at school.\r"

METHODS: Using anonymous questionnaires, we surveyed 395 parents of children with CF at 12 New England CF centers with regard to 12 maternal or family situations and 11 fetal characteristics; 271 (68%) responded. RESULTS: The majority supported legal abortion in the first trimester for all 23 situations; 58% would abort for severe mental retardation (MR), 40% would abort for a genetic disorder leading to death before age five years, 41% for a child bedridden for life, 35% for moderate MR, 20% for CF and 17% for a severe incurable disorder starting at age 40 years. Few would abort for a disorder starting at age 60 years, for genetic susceptibility to alcoholism or for sex selection. Variables most strongly related to abortion for CF were attitudes of spouse, respondent's siblings, and CF doctor toward abortion for CF as well as infrequent attendance at religious services. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal diagnosis may not reduce substantially the number of CF births to parents of CF children because most do not accept abortion for CF.\r"

Interviews of case parents suggested that the use of high-iron infant formula was associated with this problem. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted to test this hypothesis. Information on feeding practices and a variety of medical and socioeconomic factors was collected for 78 laboratory-confirmed Salmonella-case infants and 167 control infants. RESULTS: Case infants were less likely to have been breast-fed (odds ratio [OR] = 9.15; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.71-30.9) and more likely to have been fed infant formula with an iron content of 10 mg/L or greater (OR = 2.96; 95% CI = 1.24-7.08) than were control infants. CONCLUSIONS: Although the precise means by which infants are most commonly exposed to Salmonella bacteria remain obscure, breast-feeding apparently protects against the development of physician-diagnosed clinical salmonellosis, while the feeding of high-iron infant formula has the opposite effect.\r"

All patients were given glucose/insulin infusion before delivery. Fifteen healthy patients with iatrogenic hyperglycemia (group 2) and 15 healthy euglycemic patients (group 3) served as controls. Results were expressed as mean +/- 1 SE and were analyzed using analysis of variance and chi 2 analysis at P less than 0.05. No significant differences were seen at delivery either in maternal arterial and neonatal umbilical venous and arterial blood acid-base status or in neonatal Apgar scores among the three groups. Patients in groups 1 and 2 had larger blood glucose concentrations than those in group 3 (P = 0.01). Diabetic mothers and their neonates had a 25%-50% reduction in pyruvate concentration in maternal venous, and neonatal umbilical venous and arterial blood compared with that in the other two groups (P = 0.001). Postpartum neonatal hypoglycemia (less than 30 mg/dL) developed in seven of the group 1 neonates (P = 0.05). Thus, epidural anesthesia in diabetic women is associated with normal acid-base status in the mother and in the neonate. The data also show an increased incidence of neonatal hypoglycemia and altered maternal and neonatal glycolysis in patients with diabetes mellitus.\r"

The study drugs were administered in the recovery room for moderate or severe pain and were repeated until pain subsided or disappeared. In the group receiving diclofenac, 83% of the patients required analgesic supplementation with morphine. This contrasted (P less than 0.01) with 33% of the patients receiving either oxycodone or the higher dose of dexmedetomidine. After the first dose of oxycodone was injected, the visual analogue scale for pain (0%-100%) was reduced from 58% to 33%, whereas corresponding pain relief was only achieved after the third injection of 0.4 microgram/kg of dexmedetomidine. Repeated doses of 0.2 microgram/kg of diclofenac or dexmedetomidine did not reduce the visual analogue scale value by more than 17%. More sedation was seen with the higher dose of dexmedetomidine than with either diclofenac or oxycodone (P less than 0.001). Both doses of dexmedetomidine decreased heart rate when compared with diclofenac (P less than 0.001). In the group given 0.4 microgram/kg of dexmedetomidine, 33% of the patients required atropine for bradycardia. The authors conclude that after laparoscopic tubal ligation, intravenously administered dexmedetomidine relieves pain and reduces opioid drug requirement but is attended by sedation and a high incidence of bradycardia.\r"

  ".W": "The quality and duration of analgesia and incidence of side effects following epidurally administered morphine after cesarean section are highly variable. Two suggested sources of this variability are prior use of epinephrine-containing solutions, which may enhance both analgesia and side effects of morphine, and prior use of 2-chloroprocaine, which may inhibit epidural morphine analgesia. To examine these proposed sources of this variability we performed two studies. In the first, designed to test epinephrine's effect, 30 women underwent testing for epidural catheter tip location with injection of 2-chloroprocaine, followed by either 0.5% bupivacaine alone or 0.5% bupivacaine with 5 micrograms/mL epinephrine for epidural anesthesia. Inclusion of epinephrine with bupivacaine decreased the bupivacaine dose needed to achieve a T-4 sensory block by 24% (P less than 0.05), but did not alter analgesic duration or the incidence of side effects of epidural morphine (5 mg). In the second study, designed to test the effect of 2-chloroprocaine, 30 women received 7 mL of either 2% 2-chloroprocaine or lidocaine for epidural catheter testing, followed by 0.5% bupivacaine for epidural anesthesia. Compared to lidocaine testing, 2-chloroprocaine decreased the duration of epidural morphine analgesia (median 16 h with 2-chloroprocaine vs 24 h with lidocaine; P less than 0.05) without altering the incidence of side effects. The authors conclude that addition of epinephrine to local anesthetic does not increase the incidence of side effects or the analgesic effect from epidurally administered morphine. 2-Chloroprocaine, even when administered in small doses remote to the time of morphine injection, interferes with the duration of epidural morphine analgesia.\r"

  ".W": "The antinociceptive effects of an intrathecally administered benzodiazepine agonist midazolam, alone and in combination with morphine, were examined in the rat by using the tail-flick test. The duration of antinociceptive effect produced by midazolam was significantly less (P less than 0.05) than that produced by morphine. Low doses of midazolam (10 micrograms) and morphine (10 micrograms) produced a synergistic effect in prolonging antinociceptive effect. However, at higher doses (20 or 30 micrograms), these drugs reduced the extent of antinociception produced by each other. Naloxone administration prevented antinociception produced by these drugs, indicating interactions between midazolam and opioid receptors. Midazolam had dual effects on the binding of opioid ligands to the spinal opioid receptors. At low dose, it potentiated the displacement of [3H]naloxone by morphine. At higher doses, midazolam inhibited the binding of opioid ligands to their spinal receptors in the following order: kappa greater than delta greater than mu. These results indicate that differential antinociceptive effects of midazolam on morphine-induced antinociception involve interaction of this benzodiazepine with spinal opioid receptors.\r"

Analgesia evaluated by a visual analogue pain score and by a verbal pain score was similarly effective in both groups. The sedation score was also similar in both groups. The total dose of epidural fentanyl administered during the first 24 h was significantly lower in the PCA group than in the continuous infusion group (405 +/- 110 micrograms vs 1600 +/- 245 micrograms, P less than 0.001). The dose of fentanyl given during each 4-h interval ranged between 40 and 160 micrograms in the PCA group and 251 and 292 micrograms in the continuous infusion group. Clinically detectable respiratory depression was not observed in either group. In conclusion, epidural administration of 0.1 mg.kg-1.h-1 bupivacaine combined with fentanyl provides effective postoperative analgesia with a total dose of fentanyl required that is lower when fentanyl is administered by epidural PCA rather than by continuous epidural infusion.\r"

  ".W": "To study the relationship between skin sympathetic nerve activity and changes in skin resistance (galvanic skin response--GSR), efferent sympathetic and sensory nerves to the hand were blocked by an axillary nerve blockade in 15 healthy subjects. Subsequently, intraneural electrical stimuli in the median nerve distal to the axillary nerve block were used to evoke changes in skin resistance and in water vapor partial pressure in the sensory and sympathetically denervated hand. With increasing frequency of stimulation, skin resistance decreased and water vapor partial pressure increased until stimuli exceeded 10 Hz. When an additional burst of impulses was added to the background stimulation, GSR amplitude varied in a nonlinear fashion with the background frequency. Stimulation-induced GSR was completely abolished in a dose-dependent manner by systemically (intravenously) administered atropine. The results indicate that GSR depends on the preceding level of nerve traffic in the sympathetic sudomotor nerve fibers. Consequently, skin resistance recordings cannot be used to quantify sympathetic nerve traffic and thus do not express the completeness of sympathetic blockade in regional anesthesia.\r"

  ".W": "The cardiovascular actions of three concentrations of desflurane (formerly I-653), a new inhalation anesthetic, were examined in 12 unmedicated normocapnic, normothermic male volunteers. We compared the effects of 0.83, 1.24, and 1.66 MAC desflurane with measurements obtained while the same men were conscious. Desflurane caused a dose-dependent increase in right-heart filling pressure and a decrease in systemic vascular resistance and mean systemic arterial blood pressure. As measured by echocardiography, left ventricular end-diastolic area did not change except for a small increase at 1.66 MAC desflurane, and systolic wall stress was less at all concentrations of desflurane than during the conscious state. Desflurane did not change cardiac index or left ventricular ejection fraction. Heart rate did not change at 0.83 MAC, but progressively increased with deeper desflurane anesthesia. Stroke volume index was less at all concentrations of desflurane than while the men were conscious, but desflurane did not alter the velocity of ventricular circumferential fiber shortening. Mixed venous blood PO2 and oxyhemoglobin saturation were higher during all concentrations of desflurane anesthesia than during the conscious state. No volunteer developed a metabolic acidosis. We conclude that desflurane with controlled ventilation and constant PaCO2 causes cardiovascular depression, as indicated by the increased cardiac filling pressure and decreased stroke volume index and by no change in the velocity of circumferential fiber shortening in the presence of decreased systolic wall stress. However, cardiac output is well maintained, and heart rate does not increase at light levels of anesthesia. The cardiovascular actions of 0.83 and 1.66 MAC desflurane were also reexamined in 6 of the 12 men during the seventh hour of anesthesia. Prolonged desflurane anesthesia resulted in lesser cardiovascular depression than was evidenced during the first 90 min. The measures of cardiac filling (central venous pressure and left ventricular end-diastolic cross-sectional area) did not differ between the early and late periods of anesthesia. Systemic vascular resistance decreased further during the late period, but systolic wall stress did not differ between the two time periods. During the seventh hour of desflurane anesthesia, heart rate and cardiac index were higher at both anesthetic concentrations than during the first 90 min of anesthesia. Left ventricular ejection fraction and velocity of fiber shortening did not change with duration of desflurane anesthesia. Oxygen consumption, oxygen transport, the ratio of the two, mixed venous PO2, and mixed venous oxyhemoglobin saturation (SO2) increased late in the anesthetic in comparison with the first 90 min.\r"

Desflurane/nitrous oxide anesthesia decreased systemic blood pressures, cardiac index, stroke volume index, systemic vascular resistance, and left ventricular stroke work index, and increased pulmonary arterial pressures and central venous pressure in a dose-dependent fashion, while heart rate was 10%-12% and mixed venous oxygen tension was 2-4 mm Hg higher at all MAC levels than at baseline (awake). Desflurane/nitrous oxide anesthesia modestly increased left ventricular end-diastolic cross-sectional area (preload) and decreased velocity of left ventricular circumferential fiber shortening, systolic wall stress (afterload), and area ejection fraction; this combination of changes indicates myocardial depression. At approximately comparable MAC levels, heart rate was lower and systemic blood pressures, central venous pressure, left ventricular stroke work index, and systemic vascular resistance usually were significantly higher during anesthesia with desflurane and nitrous oxide than during desflurane anesthesia alone (same volunteers, data collected in crossover design). After 7 h of anesthesia, regardless of the background gas, somewhat less cardiovascular depression and/or modest stimulation was apparent: cardiac index, area ejection fraction, and velocity of left ventricular circumferential fiber shortening recovered to or toward awake values, whereas heart rate was further increased. Evidence of circulatory insufficiency did not develop in any volunteers during the study. Segmental left ventricular function was normal at baseline, and no segmental wall-motion abnormalities, ST-segment change, or dysrhythmias developed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Both anesthetic regimens decreased ventilation, increased partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide, and produced similar cardiovascular changes. In comparison with values obtained when the volunteers were conscious, desflurane anesthesia with spontaneous ventilation decreased systemic vascular resistance and mean arterial blood pressure. Cardiac index, heart rate, stroke volume index, and central venous blood pressure increased. Left ventricular ejection fraction increased at 0.83 MAC desflurane in oxygen, and otherwise did not differ from the conscious value. The velocity of ventricular circumferential fiber shortening, estimated by echocardiography, increased with desflurane in oxygen but did not change with desflurane in nitrous oxide. Oxygen consumption increased during desflurane and oxygen anesthesia, but not when nitrous oxide plus oxygen was the background gas. Desflurane increased oxygen transport, the ratio of oxygen transport to oxygen consumption, mixed venous partial pressure of oxygen, and oxyhemoglobin saturation. The cardiovascular changes with desflurane during spontaneous ventilation differ from those during controlled ventilation. With both background gases, spontaneous ventilation, in comparison with controlled ventilation, increased cardiac index, stroke volume, central venous pressure, left ventricular ejection fraction, velocity of circumferential fiber shortening, oxygen transport, and the ratio of oxygen transport to oxygen consumption but did not change mean arterial blood pressure except at 1.66 MAC desflurane in oxygen (when it was higher with spontaneous than with controlled ventilation).\r"

At 0.83 and 1.24 MAC, cardiac output, mean systemic arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and pulmonary arterial blood pressure increased. Peak changes averaged 13%-20% and most frequently occurred 0-2 min after stimulation (P less than 0.05) with return to control values at 4-6 min (except for pulmonary arterial blood pressure). At 1.66 MAC, heart rate and systemic blood pressure responses were attenuated, but this level of anesthesia had equivocal effects on the cardiac output and pulmonary blood pressure responses. The addition of nitrous oxide attenuated the peak response of heart rate and cardiac output but not the peak response of mean systemic arterial blood pressure. In summary, 0.83 and 1.24 MAC desflurane did not abolish cardiovascular responses to stimulation, but 1.66 MAC attenuated the responses.\r"

Markers of desflurane metabolism included fluoride ion measured via an ion-specific electrode, nonvolatile organic fluoride measured after sodium fusion of urine samples, and trifluoroacetic acid determined by a gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric method. In both volunteer and patient groups, postanesthesia serum fluoride ion concentrations did not differ from background fluoride ion concentrations. Similarly, postanesthesia urinary excretion of fluoride ion and organic fluoride in volunteers was comparable to preanesthesia excretion rates. However, small but significant levels of trifluoroacetic acid were found in both serum and urine from volunteers after exposure to desflurane. A peak serum concentration of 0.38 +/- 0.17 mumol/L of trifluoroacetic acid and a peak urinary excretion rate of 0.169 +/- 0.107 mumol/h were detected in volunteers at 24 h after desflurane exposure. Although these increases in trifluoroacetic acid after exposure to desflurane were statistically significant, they are approximately 10-fold less than levels seen after exposure to isoflurane. Thus, desflurane strongly resists biodegradation, but a small amount is metabolized in humans.\r"

Serum levels in excess of 1000 mg% were measured at 30 min when an amount of Hyskon greater than 300 mL was used. Intrauterine Hyskon absorption and/or injection during hysteroscopy were found even after volumes of Hyskon as small as 50-100 mL were used. Serum levels were significantly higher with the larger amounts of Hyskon used in ablative procedures (P less than 0.01), as compared with serum levels seen with the smaller amounts of Hyskon used for diagnostic procedures. The injection pressures should be low to minimize the amount of intravascular injection. In cases in which extensive ablative procedures are necessary, we suggest that a two-stage procedure be considered. Because of the hypertonicity of Hyskon, intravascular volume expansion that may be larger than that seen during transurethral prostatectomy occurs.\r"

Patients were interviewed on their knowledge of the role and training of anesthesiologists and on their preferences regarding anesthetic management. Patients also rated the intensity of their concern on 20 written statements expressing potential anesthetic complications. Results indicated that patients' perceptions of the anesthesiologist's training and role were accurate. Most patients preferred (a) general to regional anesthesia and (b) not to select their own anesthesiologist. Most significant preoperative concerns regarding the anesthesiologist focused on experience, qualifications, and presence or absence during the anesthesia. Patient concerns also included the possibility of not waking up postoperatively, experiencing pain, and becoming paralyzed. Intensity of concern was inversely related to age and unrelated to educational level or occupation. Variables related to type of concern included patient's sex, type of anesthesia, and proposed surgical procedure. Issues of least concern included disclosure of personal matters during anesthesia, experiencing impaired judgment postoperatively, and being asleep or bedridden for a prolonged period of time. It is suggested that anesthesiologists address significant patient concerns during the preoperative visit to enhance their effectiveness in patient care. Efforts to educate the public on the anesthesiologist's role in perioperative care should improve patient confidence.\r"

Dexmedetomidine, ([+]4-[1-[2,3-dimethylphenyl]-ethyl]-1H-imidazole), another imidazole compound with anesthetic like properties, is now being used perioperatively. Therefore, we investigated the effects of dexmedetomidine on steroidogenesis as well as on binding to glucocorticoid receptors in a series of in vitro and in vivo animal studies. The effect of dexmedetomidine, 10(-8)-10(-3) M, on adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) stimulated release of corticosterone was assessed in isolated rat adrenal cells. To characterize dexmedetomidine interactions with the glucocorticoid receptor, dexmedetomidine's ability to compete for [3H]dexmethasone binding sites was studied in renal tubular cells. The effect of dexmedetomidine, 80 micrograms/kg subcutaneously, on ACTH-stimulated release of cortisol was studied in separate cohorts of dogs at various time intervals during and after anesthesia was given. To compare the inhibitory effects of etomidate and dexmedetomidine on steroidogenesis, ACTH-stimulated release of cortisol was studied in dogs treated with anesthetic doses of either dexmedetomidine (80 micrograms/kg IV) or etomidate (1 mg/kg IV). Finally, dogs were given dexmedetomidine by continuous subcutaneous infusion for 7 days at sedative doses after which their cortisol response to ACTH was determined. At dexmedetomidine concentrations greater than 10(-7) M, a dose-dependent inhibition of corticosterone release was detected in response to ACTH stimulation in vitro. At these high dexmedetomidine concentrations, [3H]dexamethasone binding was not affected. In the in vivo dog experiments, basal cortisol levels decreased and the cortisol response to ACTH was blunted 3 h after dexmedetomidine administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Pleural and peritoneal surfaces pose less effective barriers because diffusion distances are smaller than in the skin. Accordingly, we measured visceral loss to air of desflurane, isoflurane, and halothane from pleural and peritoneal surfaces in five juvenile swine. Pleural and peritoneal losses per percent end-tidal anesthetic correlated directly with the solubility of the anesthetic in blood or tissues. The total pleural losses for the first 30 min of anesthetic administration were desflurane, 1.22 +/- 0.22 mL (mean +/- standard deviation for the 30-min period); isoflurane, 2.34 +/- 0.52 mL; and halothane, 4.69 +/- 0.98 mL; respective peritoneal losses were 0.64 +/- 0.12 mL, 1.23 +/- 0.25 mL, and 2.69 +/- 0.57 mL. Pleural loss per unit time did not change with increasing duration of anesthesia, whereas peritoneal loss increased for all anesthetics. These visceral losses are greater than total percutaneous losses in humans given these anesthetics for the same period of time, but the loss of anesthetic by either route is too small to affect measurements of anesthetic kinetics or recovery.\r"

The average accuracy of oscillometric and Finapres pressure measurements was good. Comparisons of arterial, oscillometric, and Finapres pressures showed only a small bias in the oscillometric and Finapres pressure estimations. Finapres pressures underestimated arterial pressures by 1 mm Hg more than oscillometric pressures did. Peripheral vascular status had no effect on comparisons made between pressures measured with these two techniques. Although bias was small, precision was often lacking as shown by the large variability of the difference between individual values from the three monitors. However, the precision of Finapres pressure measurements was about the same order of magnitude as that of oscillometric measurements.\r"
