  ".W": "The frequency with which patients presenting with acute or chronic noncompressive cord syndromes subsequently develop multiple sclerosis is uncertain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on 121 patients with such syndromes to determine the frequency of asymptomatic brain lesions and to assess the sensitivity of MRI in detecting the local cord lesion. MRI findings were compared with those from visual, brainstem, and somatosensory evoked potentials (VEPs, BAEPs, SEPs), and cerebrospinal fluid electrophoresis. Lesions were seen in the appropriate cord region in 47 of 73 patients (64%) with a cervical syndrome, and in 7 of 25 patients (28%) with a thoracic or lumbar syndrome. MRI demonstrated more cervical lesions than did SEPs, but fewer thoracic or lumbar lesions. Cord swelling was seen in 6 patients and atrophy in 10. Of those with acute syndromes, abnormalities were seen with brain MRI in 18 of 32 patients (56%), with VEPs in 2 of 30 patients (7%), and with BAEPs in 2 of 24 patients (8%). In patients with chronic syndromes, abnormalities were seen with brain MRI in 73 of 89 patients (82%), with VEPs in 22 of 80 patients (28%), and with BAEPs in 12 of 62 patients (19%). Brain MRI was thus more sensitive than evoked potentials were in establishing multiplicity of lesions. However, in acute syndromes, it was not possible to diagnose multiple sclerosis from a single abnormal brain scan in chronic syndromes, a diagnosis of clinically probable multiple sclerosis could be made from one scan, provided there was no better explanation for the abnormalities: the added presence of oligoclonal bands allows a diagnosis of laboratory-supported, definite multiple sclerosis as was the case in 28 patients in this series.\r"

A total of 178 patients in an average annual at-risk population of 18,991 persons over age 29 developed dementia during 1960 through 1964 in Rochester, Minnesota, yielding an average annual incidence rate of 187.5 new cases/100,000/year. The corresponding rate for clinically and/or pathologically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (the most common cause of dementia in this community) was 123.3 new cases/100,000/year, based on 117 cases. The incidence rates for both dementia in general and Alzheimer's disease in particular rise dramatically with age. All patients were followed to death or to 1982, and the median survival was 63 months. These data include only those in the community who came to medical attention, but they yield higher rates than studies in Scandinavia, indicating a relatively high level of case ascertainment.\r"

Although in some of the monkeys the BNM was lesioned only partly with some surrounding tissue affected as well, the lesion of the BNM appears to be crucial in the large and apparently irreversible learning deficits of the monkeys. However, final proof for this suggestion is still needed.\r"

CMC time was obtained from the latency difference in responses from the abductor muscle of the little finger to magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex and electrical stimulation at the C-7/T-1 interspace. Mean CMC time in normal subjects was 6.2 msec (SD 0.86 msec), and amplitudes of responses to cortical stimuli were at least 18% of those obtained with stimuli at the wrist. CMC was abnormal in 60 patients with multiple sclerosis (72%); this correlated well with brisk finger flexor jerks (p less than 0.005). CMC was abnormal in 79% of patients with weakness of the abductor muscle of the little finger and in 54% with a normal muscle. Neurological examination was normal in 7 arms with abnormal CMC. Visual evoked potentials were abnormal in 67%, somatosensory evoked potentials in 59%, and brainstem auditory evoked potentials in 39% of those tested. For each procedure more subjects had abnormal CMC and normal evoked potentials than the reverse. The technique is of value for demonstrating and documenting central motor pathway lesions in multiple sclerosis, especially when physical signs are equivocal.\r"

Two hundred twenty patients were included, 111 in the control group, 109 in the plasma exchange group, 57 of whom were assigned to receive albumin and 52 to receive fresh frozen plasma. Treatment consisted of four plasma exchanges of two plasma volumes each, initiated on the day of randomization and repeated on alternate days. Significant short-term benefits appeared in the group that received plasma exchange as demonstrated by the reduction in the proportion of patients who required assisted ventilation after randomization, and the decrease in time before beginning weaning from ventilator, time to onset of motor recovery, and time to walk with and without assistance. No statistically significant difference was found between the group that received albumin and the group that received fresh frozen plasma. Incidents during exchanges and complications related to the plasma exchange were more frequent in patients who received fresh frozen plasma. Plasma exchange is beneficial in Guillain-Barre syndrome when it is carried out early in the course of the disease. Given its risks and the lack of its clear superiority over albumin, however, we recommend that fresh frozen plasma be abandoned in the treatment of Guillain-Barre syndrome.\r"

No side effects of the 100-mg dose were observed in the amantadine-treated volunteers. Compared with placebo, 100 mg of amantadine significantly reduced the frequency of illness (9 of 22 versus 2 of 22 volunteers, P less than 0.04) and provided 78% protection against influenza illness. The two ill volunteers in the amantadine group had rhinitis only, whereas most of the ill placebo controls developed both systemic and upper-respiratory-tract illness. Wild-type virus was recovered from 50% of the amantadine-treated volunteers, compared with 82% of the placebo controls. Of note, the infected amantadine recipients shed 100 times less virus and shed virus for half as many days as did the infected placebo recipients. Although amantadine restricted viral replication, it did not interfere with the development of an antibody response to influenza virus. These results indicate that in adults experimentally challenged with influenza wild-type virus, 100 mg of amantadine is effective both in the prevention of influenza illness and in the restriction of virus replication.\r"

A simple method of studying the effect of antibiotics on bacteria in established biofilms is reported. Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 cells grown overnight at 37 degrees C on Mueller-Hinton agar were suspended in buffer and dispensed on 0.5-cm2 catheter disks. The disks were incubated for 1 h at 37 degrees C, washed, transferred to petri dishes containing 20 ml of broth, and incubated at 37 degrees C for 20 to 22 h, at which time thick biofilms were established. Disks were washed, placed in broth or broth containing antibiotic, and incubated at 37 degrees C for 4 h. The disks were removed, and viable counts were determined. This process was repeated at other selected time intervals (e.g., 8 and 24 h). Viable bacterial counts decreased from 10(3) to 10(4) CFU/cm2 in 24 h with 400 micrograms of amdinocillin or cefamandole per ml. A combination containing 400 micrograms of each antibiotic per ml decreased the viable counts to an undetectable level (less than 100 CFU/cm2) in 24 h. Other antibiotics and organisms were also examined in this system.\r"

Extracellular susceptibility was determined by MIC determinations and time kill curves in buffered yeast extract broth, while intracellular susceptibility was determined by peripheral human monocytes in RPMI 1640 culture medium. Antibiotic concentrations equal to or greater than the broth dilution MIC inhibited or killed L. pneumophila by the time kill method, except this was not the case for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Antibiotic concentrations below the broth dilution MIC did not inhibit Legionella growth. The only antibiotic-rifampin combinations which produced improved killing of L. pneumophila by the time kill method were those in which the logarithmic growth of L. pneumophila occurred during the experiment (rosoxacin, amifloxacin, cinoxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, clindamycin, and doxycycline). Neither direct MICs nor time kill curve assays accurately predicted intracellular L. pneumophila susceptibility. Rifampin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, rosoxacin, enoxacin, amifloxacin, gentamicin, clindamycin, and doxycycline all inhibited intracellular L. pneumophila growth at readily achievable concentrations in serum. Cefoxitin and thienamycin showed no inhibition of growth, although they were present extracellularly at concentrations that were 20 to 1,000 times their broth dilution MICs. Clindamycin was the only antibiotic that was able to inhibit intracellular L. pneumophila growth at an extracellular concentration below its MIC. The gentamicin (5 mg/liter)-rifampin combination was the only antibiotic-rifampin combination which demonstrated decreased cell-associated Legionella survival in this model of in vitro susceptibility.\r"

The compound was highly active against strains of adeno-, vaccinia, influenza B, paramyxo-, picorna-, and reoviruses, with 50% inhibition of virus-induced cytopathology at 1 to 10 microM. Lesser or no antiviral effects were observed against herpes simplex, cytomegalo-, corona-, influenza A, vesicular stomatitis, and visna viruses. Drug potency against certain viruses was highly cell line dependent (N10169 was highly active in HeLa cells but was much less potent in Vero cells). This was correlated, in part, to differences in levels of adenosine kinase activity in these cell lines, since adenosine kinase appears to phosphorylate N10169 to its active form. N10169 was inhibitory to proliferating cells at antiviral concentrations, whereas stationary-phase monolayers tolerated higher concentrations (less than or equal to 100 microM). Exogenous uridine was able to reverse the virus-inhibitory effects of the compound, leading to the discovery that N10169 5'-monophosphate is a potent inhibitor of cellular orotidylate decarboxylase. N10169 was evaluated in mice that were infected intraperitoneally with banzi virus or inoculated intranasally with influenza B virus, and in hamsters that were infected intranasally with vaccinia virus. In each model, intraperitoneal injection of N10169 (100 to 300 mg/kg per day for 7 days) twice daily was ineffective, whereas intraperitoneal injection of ribavirin showed some benefit in the influenza B and banzi virus infection models.\r"

Results of comparative chemotherapeutic studies carried out with econazole and tolnaftate demonstrated superior efficacy of terbinafine in the treatment of both trichophytosis and microsporosis. Skin infections of guinea pigs caused by Candida albicans and vaginal candidiasis in rats proved to be responsive to a topical application of terbinafine also.

Antischistosomal activity, assessed by worm recovery from the host 6 weeks after infection, was most effective (complete worm elimination) when CsA was administered at the time of infection. Oral administration of CsA was less effective than subcutaneous injection, and no prophylactic activity was demonstrated by the former route. Derivatives of dihydrocyclosporin A and cyclosporin C, which have been reported to exert only poor immunosuppressive activity, exhibited efficacy against S. mansoni similar to that of CsA and were also less effective when given orally. Subcutaneous, but not oral CsA reduced cercarial skin penetration and transformation success; the derivative of dihydrocyclosporin A, however, was without effect. Moreover, CsA, but not the derivative of dihydrocyclosporin A, reduced the number of worms established after intraperitoneal injection of cercariae. These data provide further insight into the antischistosomal activity of cyclosporins, which appears to be distinct from their immunomodulatory properties, since parasite killing was retained both in immunologically disparate mice and with poorly immunosuppressive cyclosporin derivatives.\r"

Subjects washed their hands by a standardized technique 15 times per day for 5 days. After days 1 and 5 of handwashing, there was a significant reduction in log CFU for subjects using all four CHG-containing products compared with subjects using control soap and for subjects within each group after days 1 and 5 compared with the base-line CFU counts (all P less than 0.05).

In a completely defined medium only sulfamoxole, sulfaquinoxaline, and dapsone were inhibitory; the concentrations required for 50% inhibition of the rate of growth were 150, 600, and 600 microM, respectively. Eleven other sulfa drugs were ineffective at concentrations up to 2 mM. The growth inhibition was similar to that observed in procaryotes: the cells continued logarithmic growth for several cell doublings before inhibition was observed. Surprisingly, the addition of p-aminobenzoate or folate did not reverse the effects of the active sulfa drugs, the effects of sulfamoxole and methotrexate were additive rather than synergistic, and the addition of thymidine reversed methotrexate but not sulfa-drug inhibition. These results suggest that the mode of action of sulfa drugs on L. major is not by the classical route of inhibition of de novo folate synthesis. Promastigotes could be propagated for more than 40 passages in a completely defined medium in which the only added pterin was biopterin. The folate concentration in this medium was less than 10(-10) to 10(-11) M, as determined by a Leishmania bioassay. Although these data suggest that L. major may be capable of de novo synthesis of folate, the nonclassical mode of action of sulfa drugs, as well as other studies, favors the view that L. major is auxotrophic for folate.\r"

Serial concentrations in serum and urine were measured by using high-performance liquid chromatography, and the effect of the concentration in serum on protein binding was assessed. Thirty patients (ten with creatinine clearances of greater than 80 ml/min, ten with creatinine clearances between 10 and 80 ml/min, and ten on dialysis) were studied. The concentration-time curve of cefpiramide was best described by an open two-compartment model. The elimination half-lives in patients with normal or impaired renal function or those on dialysis were 5.41 +/- 1.44, 8.3 +/- 2.82, and 8.38 +/- 4.06 h, respectively, and the serum clearances in the same groups were 2.0 +/- 0.84, 1.29 +/- 0.45, and 2.04 +/- 1.10 liters/h, respectively. There were no significant differences in any of the parameters among the three groups of patients. In patients with normal or impaired renal function, protein binding varied between 93.0 +/- 1.3% at 304.4 micrograms/ml and 99.3 +/- 0.8% at 41.1 micrograms/ml and was linearly and inversely related to the cefpiramide concentration in serum. In patients on dialysis, protein binding was significantly lower (P less than 0.05) and varied between 88.5 +/- 7.1% at 173.4 micrograms/ml to 94.9 +/- 4.8% at 46.8 micrograms/ml. In patients with normal or abnormal renal function, renal cefpiramide clearance decreased linearly with declining renal function, whereas plasma clearance was maintained. Therefore, nonrenal elimination becomes more important as renal impairment progresses.\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin were studied in 15 adult patients in the acute phase of severe infections caused by gram-positive cocci. All the subjects were given a daily intravenous bolus dose of 6 mg of teicoplanin kg-1 (body weight). The pharmacokinetic study was performed over a 48-h period after injection 4. The subjects were categorized according to their mean creatinine clearances (ml.min-1.kg-1) during the study period: group 1 (n = 3), greater than 1.6; group 2 (n = 6), 0.8 to 1.6; and group 3 (n = 6), 0.15 to 0.8. Mean concentrations of teicoplanin in serum at 1, 24, and 48 h were 33 +/- 8, 9 +/- 3, and 6 +/- 2.5 micrograms.ml-1, respectively. The mean half-lives of the concentration-time curve from 12 to 48 h were 28 +/- 4, 44 +/- 24, and 48 +/- 14 h in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively (group 3 versus group 1: P less than 0.05). The mean area under the serum concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 h was 344 +/- 92 mg.h.liter-1, and the mean hybrid volume of distribution was 1.09 +/- 0.46 liter.kg-1. These values were similar for the three groups, with a trend for larger areas under the curve in group 3. Creatinine clearance correlated directly with the total body clearance of teicoplanin (r = 0.70) and with the renal clearance of teicoplanin (r = 0.82). However, in critically ill patients, the wide interindividual variations in pharmacokinetic parameters are more relevant than those related to the variations in renal function when creatinine clearance is above 0.30 ml.min-1.kg-1. We concluded that, in such conditions, monitoring of concentrations of teicoplanin in serum is mandatory.\r"

  ".W": "Teicoplanin, a new glycopeptide antibiotic, is structurally related to ristocetin, an antibiotic known to induce human platelet agglutination and, thus, thrombocytopenia and thromboembolic side effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of teicoplanin on platelet function in vitro and ex vivo and on blood coagulation ex vivo. In the in vitro studies, spontaneous platelet aggregation; platelet aggregation induced by ADP, collagen, and ristocetin; and the release of beta-thromboglobulin from platelets were assessed. Platelets from healthy subjects were incubated with teicoplanin at final concentrations of 100, 1,500, 5,000, and 10,000 micrograms/ml. The maximal achievable concentration with therapeutic doses is 100 micrograms/ml. When compared with saline, teicoplanin at concentrations of 100 and 1,500 micrograms/ml had no effect on platelet function, but at concentrations of 5,000 and 10,000 micrograms/ml, it induced greater spontaneous platelet aggregation (P less than 0.01) and inhibited platelet aggregation induced by ADP, collagen, and ristocetin (P less than 0.01). Teicoplanin at concentrations of 100, 1,500, and 5,000 micrograms/ml did not induce the release of beta-thromboglobulin, in contrast to teicoplanin at a concentration of 10,000 micrograms/ml and ristocetin at a concentration of 1.5 mg/ml (P less than 0.01). In the ex vivo studies, platelet count, bleeding time, plasma beta-thromboglobulin, platelet aggregation induced by ADP, ristocetin, and epinephrine, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, thrombin clotting time, and serum fibrinogen degradation products were evaluated at days 0, 3, and 6 and at 72 h after the end of therapy.

In the wild-type strain grown at optimal temperature, the MBCs of all beta-lactams were significantly greater than the MICs (bacteriostatic effect). As opposed to this, in the same cells grown at suboptimal temperature and in the mutants hyperproducing PBP 5 at all temperatures, the MICs of all antibiotics coincided with the MBCs (bactericidal effect). Under all conditions in which the MIC and MBC were the same, with all antibiotics, growth inhibition occurred only at the minimal concentration saturating all penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) (or at higher concentrations). On the contrary, under conditions in which the MIC was lower than the MBC, only some of the PBPs were saturated (or bound) at both the MIC and the MBC, PBP 5 in no case being either saturated or bound. Under all conditions in which saturation of all PBPs was needed for growth inhibition, cells died at all antibiotic MBCs with kinetics which were much faster than those with which they died at the MBCs under conditions in which not all PBPs were saturated (or bound). In addition, under the former conditions, antibiotic concentrations above the MBCs did not significantly accelerate cell death kinetics, while under the latter conditions there was an acceleration in kinetics with increasing antibiotic concentrations up to full saturation of PBPs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The following pharmacokinetic parameters (mean +/- standard deviations) were obtained: half-life, 18.31 +/- 6.06 h; elimination rate constant, 0.042 +/- 0.013 h-1; volume of distribution, 0.77 +/- 0.16 liters/kg; and total body clearance, 0.51 +/- 0.11 ml/min per kg. Compared with subjects with normal liver function, patients with liver disease showed a reduction in drug elimination rate and total body clearance. The half-life of metronizadole in serum and volume of distribution were increased. Large variations of these parameters were also observed among the patients. On the basis of these observations, a reduced dose of metronidazole should be given to patients with alcoholic liver disease to avoid accumulation of metronidazole and its metabolites. Monitoring of drug concentration in serum may also be necessary to optimize therapy.\r"

A probe consisting of the 1.8-kilobase (kb) HincII fragment from pUA466 was highly specific for the detection of tetracycline resistance (Tcr) in C. jejuni and C. coli. The 5-kb tetM DNA probe from Streptococcus agalactiae plasmid pJI3 which has homology with the 1.8-kb HincII fragment from pUA466 could also be used to detect Tcr Campylobacter strains. However, the tetM probe had a much lower sensitivity and required a lower stringency of hybridization. Therefore, the 1.8-kb HincII fragment appeared to be more appropriate for the classification of Tcr in Campylobacter spp. No homology was detected between the Tcr determinant from Campylobacter spp. and the tetL and tetN probes from Streptococcus spp. DNA homology was demonstrated between pUA649, a derivative of plasmid pUA466 which had lost most of the Tcr region, and Tcr plasmids from C. jejuni and C. coli isolated from animal and human sources. There was also homology between pUA649 and the chromosomes of C. jejuni and C. coli strains. In this study, all but one of the tetracycline-resistant C. coli and C. jejuni strains contained plasmids of approximately 50 kb which hybridized with the 1.8-kb HincII probe. In one C. coli strain (UA703), Tcr appeared to be chromosomally mediated.\r"

A specific trimethoprim resistance gene probe from a conjugative Staphylococcus aereus plasmid was used to investigate the location of the trimethoprim resistance gene among 29 isolates. In 14 trimethoprim-resistant isolates, the probe hybridized with only chromosomal DNA, in 9 it hybridized with only plasmid DNA, and in 1 isolate both plasmid and chromosomal sequences showed hybridization. In five isolates there was no hybridization of the probe with either chromosomal or plasmid DNA. Four of these five nonhybridizing isolates were Staphylococcus haemolyticus. In contrast, all 22 Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates tested hybridized with the probe. The presence of the trimethoprim resistance gene in a chromosomal location was correlated with a lower MIC (median, 80 micrograms/ml) than when it was plasmid encoded (median, 1,250 micrograms/ml). Restriction endonuclease mapping as well as DNA hybridization of cloned plasmid and chromosomal DNA showed that there were 2.7 kilobases of common DNA in the two loci. This included the 500 base pairs of DNA mediating trimethoprim resistance and a total of 2.2 kilobases of 3'- and 5'-flanking sequences. The presence of the same gene and flanking sequences in chromosomal and plasmid locations suggests that the trimethoprim resistance determinant is translocated among different genetic loci.\r"

After a minor delay in transit from blood to lymph, vancomycin was completely distributed to pulmonary lymph with a ratio of free drug in lymph to free drug in plasma of 0.9.

Stop-flow analysis in dogs demonstrated that CRMN is exclusively excreted by glomerular filtration. There was no specific CRMN peak corresponding to the peak of p-aminohippuric acid (PAH) secretion or to the trough of Na+-K+ reabsorption in the stop-flow pattern. Although the PAH peak disappeared when probenecid was administered, the CRMN stop-flow pattern showed no change. In rabbits, however, the CRMN concentration peak corresponding with the PAH peak was detected in the stop-flow pattern; the CRMN peak disappeared when probenecid was administered. The pharmacokinetic parameters in plasma, such as the area under the concentration-time curve, the half-life, and the clearance rate, were affected by probenecid in rats, rabbits, and monkeys, but not in dogs. The results suggest that the renal excretion of CRMN in dogs takes place exclusively through glomerular filtration. In rats, rabbits, and monkeys, however, CRMN is excreted through both glomerular filtration and renal tubular secretion.\r"

Peak imipenem concentrations in bile occurred a mean of 2.3 h after administration of the drug; cilastatin peak concentrations occurred at a mean of 2.4 h. Less than 0.3% of each drug was recovered in the bile. Our results suggest that imipenem enters bile by simple diffusion and in most patients attains concentrations sufficient to inhibit susceptible organisms. In contrast, cilastatin had a bimodal entry into bile. Some patients had very high concentrations in bile, whereas others had very low or undetectable concentrations, suggesting that cilastatin may be actively secreted into the bile.\r"

  ".W": "Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains produce a fifth penicillin-binding protein (PBP), PBP 2', with low affinity for beta-lactam antibiotics that is believed to represent a beta-lactam-insensitive peptidoglycan transpeptidase. In an effort to evaluate the adequacy of PBP 2' as an explanation of methicillin resistance, PBP 2' production and the responses of growth and peptidoglycan synthesis to methicillin under different environmental conditions have been compared. In the heterogeneous methicillin-resistant strain DU4916-K7, less PBP 2' was produced at 40 degrees C than at 30 degrees C, but inclusion of 5% (wt/vol) NaCl in the medium at 40 degrees C boosted PBP 2' production and allowed growth of the organism in the presence of 10 micrograms of methicillin per ml. When exponential-phase cultures were challenged with methicillin, growth and peptidoglycan synthesis were much more resistant at 30 degrees C than at 40 degrees C. Inclusion of NaCl in medium rendered growth and peptidoglycan synthesis more methicillin resistant at 40 degrees C. Hence, there was a good correlation between PBP 2' production and methicillin-resistant peptidoglycan synthesis under these conditions. However, PBP 2' production was increased by NaCl at 30 degrees C without markedly affecting the susceptibilities of growth and peptidoglycan synthesis to methicillin. Pregrowth of cells with methicillin, which was expected to boost PBP 2' production, seemed to increase the susceptibilities of growth and peptidoglycan synthesis to methicillin. Patterns of growth and peptidoglycan synthesis susceptibilities to methicillin which were similar to those described above were found in chloramphenicol-inhibited cultures, in which presumably no induction of PBP 2' could occur during the methicillin challenge period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Analysis of the chromatographically purified RNA polymerase on nondenaturing gels revealed two electrophoretic forms. The enzyme isolated had characteristics of true DNA-dependent RNA polymerase since it required DNA and all four nucleoside triphosphates for synthesis of RNase-sensitive products. Analysis of ammonium sulfate and metal ion optima, as well as relative activities of the enzyme with Mn2+ versus Mg2+, gave results similar to those reported for other RNA polymerase IIIs in eucaryotes. Formycin A triphosphate was found to be a noncompetitive inhibitor of RNA polymerase III, and cordycepin triphosphate was found to be inhibitory, although the exact mode of inhibition was not determined.\r"

Because of clinical deterioration of the patient, rifampin was added empirically. The patient improved clinically, and lung tissue removed surgically 8 weeks later showed no fungal elements by histopathological studies or by culture. An in vitro study of amphotericin B alone and in combination with rifampin against the isolate from the patient and 11 additional isolates of Rhizopus spp. was designed. The activity of amphotericin B in the presence of rifampin (10 or 5 micrograms/ml) increased fourfold against 9 of 10 clinical and 1 of 2 environmental isolates. Amphotericin B activity in the presence of 2 micrograms of rifampin per ml increased fourfold against 6 of 10 clinical isolates and increased twofold against an additional 3 clinical isolates. Amphotericin B in the presence of 1 microgram of rifampin per ml inhibited 9 of 10 isolates at a concentration of one-half the MIC of amphotericin B alone. These findings were confirmed by dose-response curves calculated from fungal dry weight determinations of Rhizopus spp. incubated in serial dilutions of amphotericin B combined with rifampin. These observations demonstrate in vitro, and possibly in vivo, synergy between amphotericin B and rifampin against Rhizopus spp.\r"

Three subjects participated in this study twice, once while taking and once while abstaining from phosphate-binding aluminum antacids. Subjects tolerated the medication without evidence of toxicity. Food may have delayed or decreased the absorption of ciprofloxacin, whereas antacids definitely decreased the absorption of the drug. Peak concentrations in serum noted in the absence of antacids ranged from 2.9 to 6.4 micrograms/ml, and peak concentrations in dialysate in the absence of antacids ranged from 1.8 to 4.5 micrograms/ml. Peak ciprofloxacin concentrations in serum achieved in subjects taking antacids were 14 to 50% of those achieved in subjects without antacids. The peak concentrations in dialysate achieved in subjects on antacids were 8 to 33% of those observed in subjects off antacids. The clearance of ciprofloxacin by continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis represented 2% of the total body (systemic) clearance. Simultaneous ratios of concentration in dialysate to concentration in serum (D/S) were determined at various durations of dialysate dwelling within the peritoneum. A progressive rise of the D/S ratio was noted as dwell time increased. At 4 h D/S was 0.57 +/- 0.07 (mean +/- standard error of the mean; n = 9), and at 8 h it was 0.75 +/- 0.04 (n = 26). Long-dwell exchanges may be necessary to achieve reasonable concentrations of orally ingested ciprofloxacin in dialysate.\r"

Their antibacterial spectrum includes staphylococci, streptococci, and Bacteroides fragilis strains. The compounds have equal activity against staphylococcal strains susceptible or resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics, including methicillin-resistant strains. The MICs for 90% of the strains (MIC90s) against staphylococcal isolates were 1 to 4 micrograms/ml for DuP 721 and 4 to 16 micrograms/ml for DuP 105, compared with 1 to 2 micrograms/ml for vancomycin, 0.5 microgram/ml for ciprofloxacin, and 2 to greater than 16 micrograms/ml for imipenem. The MIC90s against group D streptococci were 4 micrograms/ml for DuP 721, 16 micrograms/ml for DuP 105, and 2 micrograms/ml for vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and imipenem. MIC90s against B. fragilis isolates were 4 micrograms/ml for DuP 721, 16 micrograms/ml for DuP 105, and 8 micrograms/ml for cefoxitin. DuP 721 and DuP 105 administered by either the oral or the parenteral route were protective against staphylococcal and streptococcal infections in mice. The 50% effective doses were 2 to 10 mg/kg for DuP 721, 9 to 23 mg/kg for DuP 105, and 2 to 12 mg/kg for vancomycin.

Bacterial endotoxin is liberated during antibiotic therapy and may lead to endotoxemic shock. Steroids such as hydrocortisone are generally recommended in the treatment of endotoxemic shock. There are very limited data on the influence of endotoxin or corticosteroids on the pharmacology of antibiotics, especially aminoglycosides, which are nephrotoxic. We studied the influence of both Escherichia coli endotoxin and hydrocortisone succinate on the renal uptake of gentamicin in rats. Animals were injected intravenously with endotoxin (0.25 mg/kg) and/or hydrocortisone (25 mg/kg) plus gentamicin (10 mg/kg). Gentamicin levels in the serum and renal parenchyma as well as renal function and histology were evaluated. Both endotoxin and hydrocortisone given alone increased the concentration of gentamicin in the renal cortex (P less than 0.05). Normal values in serum were observed in all groups at most time intervals. When administered together, endotoxin and hydrocortisone did not potentiate each other. The combination of endotoxin and hydrocortisone gave significantly higher levels of gentamicin than endotoxin or hydrocortisone alone when endotoxin was injected 3 h before hydrocortisone (P less than 0.05). Blood pressure and cardiac frequency were normal when gentamicin was given. Endotoxin alone slightly decreased the glomerular filtration rate, and hydrocortisone alone slightly modified renal plasma flow. The combination of both drugs did not significantly affect renal function. No histological lesion was noted on light microscopy in animals receiving endotoxin. Competitive or synergistic activity of endotoxin, gentamicin, and hydrocortisone at the cellular level, especially on membranes or lysosomes, might explain in part our observation on the renal uptake of gentamicin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To investigate whether the well-tolerated intravenous (i.v.) injection of cephalosporins may be of comparable gonocidal effect, levels of cefodizime, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin, in serum and tissue fluid (suction blister and cantharides blister fluid) were determined in six healthy men. Single doses of 1 g of cefodizime were injected i.v. and i.m. according to a randomized crossover design. On i.m. injection the drug was completely bioavailable, and the peak concentration in serum was 75 +/- 8 micrograms/ml. The terminal half-life of serum levels was 2.4 h. Cefodizime concentrations in the blister fluids increased for 1.5 to 3 h after the i.v. dose and for at least 3 h on i.m. administration. The concentrations of non-protein-bound cefodizime in blister fluid already exceeded the MIC for 90% of Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains 10 min after i.v. injection and 20 to 30 min after the i.m. dose. At 6 h after each dose, active concentrations were still present in serum. The results suggest that cefodizime administered i.v. and i.m. has equivalent high cure rates in uncomplicated gonorrhea. This hypothesis should be tested further by a controlled clinical trial. If equivalent, i.v. administration excels because it is better tolerated locally.\r"

There were no relationships between pharmacokinetic parameters and documented infection, death, or intubation status. The results indicate that volume of distribution is commonly underestimated in intensive care unit patients, whereas elimination rates may be adequately predicted based on population averages.

Several problems with immunisation scheduling, information transfer between general practitioners and clinics and the computer centre, and validity of computer information were identified. The attitudes of parents, relatives, and friends were generally favourable, although parents reported a lack of knowledge about the disease and vaccine and lack of advice from professionals. Perceived contraindications to immunisation, particularly a history of measles, were important reasons for non-uptake. Professionals' perceptions of contraindications, however, were at variance with Department of Health and Social Security guidelines and none of the recorded contraindications was valid. Calculations of potential uptake suggest that a 90% target uptake is feasible and recommendations are made for changes in services.\r"

Comparison was made with the Tanner standards: male puberty developed a little later but growth continued longer, so that the adult men were taller and heavier. Girls showed a similar timing of puberty to the Tanner standards but were lighter at all ages and ultimately slightly taller as growth was not completed until later. It is important to know the pubertal state when interpreting growth changes in children.\r"

The prevalence of CMV in the urine of children with sensorineural hearing loss but no immediate family history of deafness was nearly twice that (13%) found in other children with impaired hearing and those with normal hearing (7%).

It is concluded that the chemoreflex is less active immediately after birth than it is a few days later, possibly due to a resetting of the sensitivity of the peripheral chemoreceptors from the fetal state, with its relatively low arterial oxygen tension to the higher postnatal concentrations.\r"

Theophylline changed the ventilatory response to a more biphasic pattern--that is, ventilation decreased after an initial increase. The relative ventilatory slope (defined as the decrease in transcutaneous carbon dioxide tension (PCO2) in relation to the fall in transcutaneous oxygen tension (PO2)) decreased significantly after theophylline. Four infants were roused during hypoxia before theophylline administration compared with none after treatment. Theophylline abolished the periodic breathing induced by hypoxia in one of six infants. These findings suggest that methylxanthines may not, as previously thought, enhance the respiratory drive during hypoxia.\r"

Three babies died from overwhelming infection and three babies developed necrotising enterocolitis, all in the group that had not been treated. Serum IgG concentrations were significantly higher in the treated group by the age of 2 weeks but remained consistently below those of full term babies of similar postnatal age. Administration of human immunoglobulin may decrease the severity of infection in premature babies, but alternative regimens may be more successful.\r"

Seventeen infants were fed with preterm formula milk and 18 with expressed maternal breast milk at one to two hourly intervals during the study period. Formula fed infants gained weight faster than those fed on breast milk but there was little difference in amino acid patterns. Infants fed on breast milk were more likely to have concentrations of essential amino acids below the mid trimester fetal range than formula fed infants, but few infants in either feeding group had values above the fetal range. Those that did were equally distributed between both groups. Only two samples approached toxic concentrations, both in the group fed breast milk. The ratio of branched chain to aromatic amino acids was higher in the group fed on formula after correction for post conceptional age, implying that liver maturation may be accelerated by formula feeding. No correlations were found between plasma amino acid concentrations and nitrogen retention or metabolisable energy intake.\r"

In 15 healthy individuals, HA increased from 26 +/- 9 micrograms/liter (mean +/- SD) before arising from a night's sleep to 54 +/- 24 micrograms/liter 1 hour after arising and performance of normal morning activities (P less than 0.001). HA in 14 patients who had inflammatory arthritis increased from 124 +/- 104 micrograms/liter to 402 +/- 232 micrograms/liter under the same conditions (P less than 0.001). The elevation due to physical activity was significantly (P less than 0.001) higher in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) than that found in controls. A slight increase of HA in the afternoon was also observed in healthy subjects who performed heavy exercise, but a marked increase was seen in RA patients who performed moderate exercise. In another group of 24 RA patients, a more standardized blood sampling was performed before arising and during normal morning activities. An increase in HA was significantly (P less than 0.001) correlated to the synovitis mass, estimated by the Ritchie articular index. Maximum increases of HA were seen 30 and 60 minutes after arising; thereafter, levels decreased to those measured at rest. During the morning activities, procollagen III peptide remained stable, while plasma elastase tended to increase. It is proposed that HA, produced in the joint tissue structures and accumulated at rest, is carried by the lymph vessels to the general circulation during physical activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Participants were asked how frequently they needed 66 specific information items. Three categories of resource needs in arthritis care were identified: general information, personal care and medical services, and assistive devices and equipment. In the first category, results indicated that the greater the impairment in functional ability, the greater the need for general information about arthritis. When functional ability was held constant, younger patients with lower family income displayed a greater need for arthritis resource information. Lower functional ability and family income were associated with a greater need for personal care and medical service information. Lower functional ability contributed the most to the need for information about assistive devices and equipment. We suggest that, as an essential component of the long-term care of patients with rheumatic diseases, individuals who provide educational counseling should clearly understand the community resource needs of patients, and should be able to match articulated needs with the existing services. Health professionals should be aware that certain patient characteristics (specifically, family income, functional ability, and age) are related to a need for this type of information. The large percentage of patients who could not name their rheumatic disease diagnosis (65%) presents a major concern and challenge to patient educators.\r"

Levels of IgG antibodies to denatured or native human type II collagen, rheumatoid factor, immunoglobulins, and total proteins were assessed in paired samples of serum and synovial fluid from 21 patients with RA and from 14 patients with OAD. Solid-phase radioimmunoassay showed that levels of antibodies to denatured collagen in synovial fluid were significantly higher in RA patients than in OAD patients (median 3,270, range 44-16,816 versus median 919, range 119-5,814; P less than 0.001). These antibody levels were higher in synovial fluid than in the serum of RA patients, but not in patients with OAD. Paired serum and synovial fluid samples showed no correlation between the level of antibodies to denatured collagen and levels of either IgG, IgA, IgM, or rheumatoid factor. Synovial fluid antibodies to native collagen were higher in RA patients. Antibodies to collagen may be synthesized preferentially in synovial tissues and, hence, participate in the perpetuation of RA.\r"

They were interviewed and examined for the 5 recognized features of hypermobility (laxity of the thumbs, fingers, elbows, spine, and knees). The incidence of hypermobility, according to the number of joints involved, followed an empiric geometric law. Approximately 27% of the individuals had 1 lax joint, whereas only 3% possessed all 5 features. Specific features were present at different frequencies in the 2 sexes. The ratio of the occurrence of 2 features in women compared with the occurrence in men was 2:1. Ratios for the occurrence of 3, 4, and 5 features were 4:1, 8:1, and 3:1, respectively. Thus, hypermobility was a predominantly female characteristic. Joint laxity declined with age, although not to a statistically significant degree. In men, the decline started when they were in their mid-twenties; however, in women, joint laxity continued through the mid-forties.\r"

The amplitude of the b-wave in the light-readapted ERG was 48% +/- 4% of that in the light-adapted ERG, and the peak time of the b-wave in the light-readapted ERG was delayed by an average of 3.49 +/- 1.09 ms. Segmental analysis of the b-wave showed that the last segment of the ascending limb of the b-wave (from the second oscillatory potential [OP] to the peak) was attenuated the most (61% +/- 8%). In fact, the reduction in the amplitude of the last segment alone accounted for more than 60% +/- 13% of the overall reduction observed for the entire b-wave. This last segment appears to correspond to OP4 in the 100- to 1000-Hz recordings. The amplitude of OP4 in the light-readapted ERG was 56.5% +/- 10% of that in the light-adapted ERG, a similar reduction to that observed for the last segment of the 1- to 1000-Hz b-wave. The results strongly support the concept that the b-wave of the photopic ERG may actually represent a composite of potentials whose individual contributions are best visualized when the ERG is recorded with the 100- to 1000-Hz bandwidth.\r"

The overall prevalence of Kathon sensitivity was 0.9% for 1985-87. The prevalence for 1985/6 and 1986/7 was 0.8% and 1.1% (difference not significant). The rate of sensitisation to Kathon was measured in 212 patients with negative patch tests by retesting after 6-15 months (mean 10.8 months +/- 0.2 SE), and gave a mean rate of sensitisation of 1/2280 patient months or 0.5%/patient population. Retesting 45 negative reactors after 4 weeks gave no new reactors, showing that the rate of sensitisation by patch testing with 100 ppm Kathon is low. It is concluded that the low and stable prevalence of Kathon sensitivity and the low rate of new sensitisation is in keeping with a low potential for sensitisation. Used on a larger scale, the present method would rapidly define risk from potential new allergens.\r"

  ".W": "In my experience, steroids have no use in the management of ACSOL once the airway is secured, and may actually prolong and complicate the infectious process. The main use of antibiotics is probably for preventing systemic complications such as pneumonia and meningitis. It is possible, however, that neither drug can alter the natural course of this disease and may just hasten its expected inconsequential resolution. The key to successful management of acute supraglottitis is early recognition and prompt provision of airway assistance when indicated. This potentially fatal disease occurs in adults as well as children. To my knowledge, most deaths occur after the patient arrives at the hospital, when there is hesitation and indecision about the need for airway intervention. Whenever signs of UAO appear, artificial airway should be provided promptly, regardless of the eventual diagnosis. Those physicians who try all means to avoid intubation or tracheotomy early in the process may be cautioned that complications from either procedures are just a risk, while airway obstruction in most cases of ACSOL is a certainty. Finally, the examiner assessing patients with possible obstructive laryngitis, supraglottic, or subglottic, should first and foremost decide whether an airway is needed and should defer all diagnostic guesswork and laboratory data processing until the airway is secured.\r"

Whereas the SWP of WA rats showed a trend toward increasing disruption as the degree of hypoxia increased, CA rats exhibited no such trend. The effect was chiefly on the frequency of state changes and less on epoch durations. The SWP of WA rats was more vulnerable to hypoxia than that of CA rats. Maximum and minimum body temperatures of WA and CA rats were not significantly affected by O2 lack down to 10% inspired O2. We conclude that in the rat 1) hypoxia primarily affects the neural mechanism that governs the frequency of changes in sleep-waking states; 2) the extent of alterations in SWP's depends on the ambient temperature to which the rats are acclimated; and 3) hypoxia does not significantly affect deep body temperature at the animal's neutral temperature.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies in humans have shown that alanine is released from the skeletal muscle in proportion to the work load. We have measured plasma alanine and urea concentrations in well-trained Standardbred and Finnish-bred (cold-blooded) trotters after a graded-intensity exercise and during recovery to study metabolic responses to exercise in this animal model. As controls we measured blood lactate, pyruvate, and glucose concentrations as well as hematocrit values. Metabolic responses to exercise were closely reflected in all these parameters. Plasma alanine increased relatively more than plasma lactate at moderate-intensity exercise near anaerobic threshold. The linear correlation between the intensity of exercise and plasma alanine was similar to that observed earlier in humans. Interestingly, plasma alanine concentrations remained elevated long after the submaximal exercise, whereas the concentration of lactate, pyruvate, and glucose decreased more rapidly. No significant changes were found in plasma urea concentration under these conditions. The most significant differences in the metabolic responses to exercise of the two breeds studied were the higher lactate-to-pyruvate ratios achieved during the high-intensity exercise and the more sensitive increases of plasma alanine even during low-intensity exercise in the Finnish-bred horses. These differences probably reflect different compositions of muscle fiber types in the two breeds. The findings together indicate that plasma alanine is greatly increased in the racehorse during and after a high-intensity exercise and thus is an important vehicle in transporting ammonia and carbon skeletons of products of anaerobic glycolysis out of the muscle tissue.\r"

We infused air (1.23 ml/min) in the pulmonary artery for 2 h in untreated control sheep. In DBcAMP-pretreated sheep DBcAMP was infused (1 mg/kg bolus and 0.02 mg.kg-1.min-1 constantly for 5 h); after 1 h from beginning of DBcAMP administration the air infusion was started. After the air infusion, pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) and lung lymph flow rate (Qlym) significantly increased in both groups. DBcAMP-pretreated sheep showed significantly lower responses in Qlym (2.7 X base line) compared with untreated control sheep (4.6 X base line); however, Ppa, left atrial pressure, and lung lymph-to-plasma protein concentration ratio were not significantly different between the two groups. Although plasma and lung lymph thromboxane B2 and 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha concentrations increased significantly during the air infusion, DBcAMP-pretreated sheep showed significantly lower responses. Thus DBcAMP infusion attenuated pulmonary microvascular permeability induced by air embolism. We conclude that pulmonary vascular permeability is in part controlled by the intracellular cAMP level.\r"

Hypoxia induced a significant mean pial arterial dilatation of 18-29% in the various types of experiments. The pial arterial reactivity to each of the tested factors remained unchanged during hypoxia compared with normoxia. The hypoxic vasodilatation could not be reduced by the perivascular microapplication of theophylline (10(-5) and 5 X 10(-5) M). Systemic theophylline (50-75 mumol/kg, iv), regardless of whether given during or before hypoxia, did not attenuate the hypoxic vasodilatation, although it blocked dilatations induced by the perivascular microapplication of adenosine during normoxia. The present study shows that 1) local metabolic factors are vasoactive during moderate hypoxia; therefore they could mediate the hypoxic dilatation of brain vessels; 2) systemic theophylline can block vascular adenosine receptors; 3) since local theophylline had no effect on the hypoxic dilatation of pial arteries, adenosine may not be the main causative factor for the hypoxic hyperemia.\r"

To determine whether this response is governed by central nervous system thermoregulatory control or is a local response to the drying and/or cooling of the airway mucosa, we studied eight anesthetized spontaneously breathing dogs in a thermally controlled chamber designed so that inspired air temperature, humidity, and body temperature could be separately regulated. Four dogs breathed through the nose and mouth (group 1), and four breathed through a short tracheostomy tube (group 2). Dogs were studied under the following conditions: 1) a normothermic control period and 2) two periods of hyperthermia in which the dogs panted with either warm 100% humidified air or warm dry (approximately 10% humidified) air. Radiolabeled microspheres (15 +/- 3 micron diam) were injected into the left ventricle as a marker of nasal, lingual, and tracheobronchial blood flow. After the final measurements, the dogs were killed and tissues of interest excised. Results showed that lingual and nasal blood flow (ml.min-1.g-1) increased during panting (P less than 0.01) in both groups and were not affected by the inspired air conditions. In group 1, tracheal mucosal blood flow barely doubled (P less than 0.01) and bronchial blood flow did not change during humid and dry air panting. In group 2, there was a sevenfold increase in tracheal mucosal and about a threefold increase in bronchial blood flow (P less than 0.01), which was only observed during dry air panting.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Computer simulation of blood flow and O2 consumption (QO2) of leg muscles and of blood flow through other vascular compartments was made to estimate the potential effects of circulatory adjustments to moderate leg exercise on pulmonary O2 uptake (VO2) kinetics in humans. The model revealed a biphasic rise in pulmonary VO2 after the onset of constant-load exercise. The length of the first phase represented a circulatory transit time from the contracting muscles to the lung. The duration and magnitude of rise in VO2 during phase 1 were determined solely by the rate of rise in venous return and by the venous volume separating the muscle from the lung gas exchange sites. The second phase of VO2 represented increased muscle metabolism (QO2) of exercise. With the use of a single-exponential model for muscle QO2 and physiological estimates of other model parameters, phase 2 VO2 could be well described as a first-order exponential whose time constant was within 2 s of that for muscle QO2. The use of unphysiological estimates for certain parameters led to responses for VO2 during phase 2 that were qualitatively different from QO2. It is concluded that 1) the normal response of VO2 in humans to step increases in muscle work contains two components or phases, the first determined by cardiovascular phenomena and the second primarily reflecting muscle metabolism and 2) the kinetics of VO2 during phase 2 can be used to estimate the kinetics of muscle QO2. The simulation results are consistent with previously published profiles of VO2 kinetics for square-wave transients.\r"

Glycerol ingestion increased plasma osmolality for 2 h and reduced the total 4-h urine volume. There were no significant changes in Hb or Hct as a result of the glycerol or excess fluid intake.

Incremental increases in work intensity resulted in corresponding increases in blood flows to the gracilis, gastrocnemius, semimembranosus, and semitendinosus muscles of the hindlimb and to the heart. During maximal exercise, blood flow was greatest in the semimembranosus muscle and lowest in the semitendinosus muscle (342 and 134 ml-1.100 g tissue-1.min-1, respectively). Exercise produced a decrease in blood flow to the temporalis muscle, which was classified as nonlocomotive in function. Blood flows to the stomach, pancreas, and large intestine decreased at the lowest exercise work load and remained diminished throughout the continuum to maximal exercise. Blood flows to the small intestine and spleen were maintained during submaximal exercise but were reduced by 50% at maximal O2 consumption (VO2max). No changes in blood flows to the kidneys, adrenal glands, liver, and brain were found. These results demonstrate that 1) renal blood flow is maintained at resting levels during exercise in untrained dogs; 2) blood flow changes in the various organs of the splanchnic region of dogs during exercise are heterogeneous; and 3) blood flows to the working skeletal muscles of dogs progressively increase with increasing work loads up to VO2max.\r"

  ".W": "To study the relationship between bronchomotor tone, static mechanical properties of the lung, and ventilation distribution, we measured the pressure-volume (P-V) curve of the lung and several ventilatory indexes before and after intravenous atropine in eight normal subjects. The indexes of ventilation distribution were derived from multiple breath N2 washouts by a recently developed analysis (7,8). The latter not only provides a sensitive measure of overall ventilation inhomogeneity but distinguishes between the convection-dependent inhomogeneity (CDI) among larger lung units and that due to the interaction of convection and diffusion (DCDI) within the lung periphery. Atropine decreased lung elastic recoil but distensibility, as defined by the exponent (K) in the monoexponential analysis of the P-V data, was unchanged. The overall ventilation inhomogeneity increased by 37% after atropine (P less than 0.02) due to an increase in the CDI component. More importantly, there was a significant correlation between the loss of lung recoil (but not K) and each of the indexes of CDI among the subjects. There was no correlation between the changes in lung recoil and in DCDI. Our findings indicate that normal bronchomotor tone contributes to the elastic recoil of the lung. Furthermore, the tone is distributed in a way that enhances the uniformity of ventilation distribution among diffusion-independent lung units. Presumably this is achieved by minimizing interacinar intrinsic inequalities in static mechanical properties.\r"

There was a 31% increase in the mean maximal velocity of unloaded shortening (Vmax) among fibers from SOL with no change in the mean Vmax of fibers from PL after suspension. The myosin heavy and light chain (MHC and MLC) composition of bundles and the MHC composition of single fibers from control and suspended muscles were examined using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. There was a marked increase in the relative amount of fast-type MHC's in hypokinetic SOL and a smaller increase in the amount of fast-type MHC's in the PL. Relatively minor changes occurred in the MLC's during hypokinesia. As Vmax increased among individual fibers from control and suspended muscles, the relative amount of fast-type MHC's increased. The results demonstrate that the myosin isozyme composition of skeletal muscle, especially the heavy chains, is altered during hypokinesia, and this finding provides an explanation for changes in Vmax of rat single muscle fibers under the same conditions.\r"

Sixty days postablation, the NADH-tetrazolium reductase (NADH-TR) activity of soleus motoneurons decreased 12.5% from 0.327 +/- 0.005 (mean +/- SE; optical density units) to 0.286 +/- 0.007. In the muscle fibers, the alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase activity (glycolytic enzyme) decreased from 0.114 +/- 0.010 to 0.074 +/- 0.009, a change of 35.1%, and the NADH-TR activity decreased 21.2% from 0.348 +/- 0.018 to 0.274 +/- 0.017. In both the motoneurons and the muscle fibers, the decrease was nonspecific for all cells, although a greater effect on the cells with higher enzyme activity was observed. The decreased NADH-TR activity represents a shift in the oxidative profile of the motoneurons and muscle fibers, indicating a decreased ability to use oxidative metabolism for periods of short-term high-energy demands. Furthermore, the parallel decrease in muscle fibers and motoneurons with high NADH-TR activity (fast-twitch oxidative-glycolytic fibers and presumably also motoneurons) demonstrates the tight correlation of the NADH-TR activity between these parts of the motor unit in both control and synergist-ablated muscles.\r"

Basal cAMP levels were not significantly different (PNS) in muscle from BG (11.6 +/- 0.53 pmol/mg protein) and greyhound dogs (10.30 +/- 1.60 pmol/mg protein). The cAMP responses to stimulation with ISO were enhanced in BG compared with greyhound dogs. The low Michaelis constant (1) for Km-cAMP PDE activity (Km = 0.63 microM) was significantly less (P less than 0.005) in BG dogs (1.54 +/- 0.28 pmol.min-1.mg protein-1) than greyhounds (11.76 +/- 2.48). Endogenously active PK activity was significantly greater (P less than 0.005) in BG (54.74 +/- 5.39 pmol.min-1.mg protein-1) than in greyhound dogs (15.50 +/0 2.20). Increases in PK activity with 5 microM cAMP added were not significantly different between BG (14.79 +/- 6.00) and greyhound dogs (7.04 +/- 2.14). Approximately 90% of both endogenous PK activity and cAMP-activated PK activity in BG and greyhound dogs was inhibited by a cAMP-dependent PK inhibitor (PKI'). These data suggest that decreased cyclic nucleotide degradation due to decreased cyclic nucleotide PDE activity with increased PK could account for the in vitro hyporesponsiveness of airway smooth muscle in BG dogs as a protective adaptive mechanism.\r"

The lambs were given sheep surfactant, paralyzed, and mechanically ventilated at birth. We first compared 8 lambs with open ductus and 13 lambs with closed ductus during the 12 h after birth. Although lambs with open ductus had greater pulmonary blood flow (301 +/- 36 vs. 188 +/- 11 ml.min-1.kg-1, mean +/- SE, at 12 h of age) and mean pulmonary arterial (44 +/- 3 vs. 33 +/- 2 mmHg) and left ventricular end-diastolic (6 +/- 0.6 vs 4 +/- 0.7 mmHg) pressures, we found no differences in dynamic respiratory compliance (Cdyn = 0.55 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.55 +/- 0.03 ml.cmH2O-1.kg-1), midtidal volume resistance (62 +/- 5 X 10(-3) vs. 62 +/- 7 X 10(-3) cmH2O.ml-1.s), or functional residual capacity (FRC = 27 +/- 3 vs. 26 +/- 2 ml.kg-1). Alveolar-arterial PO2 difference was lower in the lambs with open ductus (238 +/- 65 vs. 362 +/- 37 Torr). Next, we challenged eight lambs with two separate saline infusions (50 ml.kg-1 over 3 min), each given with the ductus alternately closed or open. When the ductus was closed, FRC was unchanged, but Cdyn increased by 18% immediately after the infusion. When the ductus was open, FRC decreased by 16% and Cdyn decreased by 12%. We conclude that the premature lamb is surprisingly resistant to changes in respiratory function from ductal patency during the immediate neonatal period.\r"

Carotid baroreceptor activity was altered with 5-s periods of 30 Torr pressure or suction applied to a neck chamber during held expiration. Brief handgrip (30% of maximum) significantly reduced base-line R-R intervals, did not modify reductions of R-R intervals during neck pressure, and significantly reduced increases of R-R intervals during neck suction. Handgrip did not significantly increase base-line sympathetic activity from resting levels, but it significantly diminished increases of sympathetic activity during neck pressure and augmented reductions of sympathetic activity during neck suction. Our results suggest that exercise modifies, in small but significant ways, early sympathetic and vagal responses to abrupt changes of arterial baroreceptor input in humans.\r"

With both swimming and electrical stimulation, soleus (SOL) contents of creatine phosphate (CP), ATP, and glycogen changed the least, whereas the largest decreases in these metabolites occurred in the white gastrocnemius (WG). Lactate (La-) accumulation and glycogen breakdown were significantly greater in SWUM hindlimb muscles compared with STIM. The high arterial La- concentration [( La-] = 20 meq.l-1) in SWUM may have contributed to elevated muscle [La-], whereas one-pass perfusion kept arterial [La-] below 2 meq.l-1 in STIM. In SWUM, intracellular [Na+] increased significantly in the plantaris (PL), red gastrocnemius (RG), and WG, but not in SOL. [Cl-] increased, and [K+], [Ca2+], and [Mg2+] decreased in all muscles. In STIM, intracellular [K+], [Mg2+], and [Ca2+] decreased significantly, whereas [Na+] and [Cl-] increased in all muscles. Differences in the magnitude of ion and fluid fluxes between groups can be explained by the different methods of hindlimb perfusion. In conclusion, STIM is a useful model of in vivo energy metabolism and permits mechanisms of transsarcolemmal ion movements to be studied.\r"

This underestimation is related to the percent of vessels embolized and the caliber of pulmonary arteries that are embolized (i.e., the size of the emboli). Experimental verification of these theoretical findings is necessary before the conclusions can be extended to the interpretation of venous occlusion experiments in the lung.\r"

The dispersion of the blood flow distribution increased by 64% from rest to 281 W, at both sea level and at PB = 428 Torr (heaviest exercise 215 W). At PB = 347 Torr, the increase was 79% (rest to 159 W); at PB = 282 Torr, the increase was 112% (108 W); and at PB = 240 Torr, the increase was 9% (60 W). There was no significant correlation between the dispersion and cardiac output, ventilation, or pulmonary arterial wedge pressure, but there was a correlation between the dispersion and mean pulmonary arterial pressure (r = 0.49, P = 0.02). When abnormal, the VA/Q pattern generally had perfusion in lung units of zero or near zero VA/Q combined with units of normal VA/Q. Alveolar-end-capillary diffusion limitation of O2 uptake (VO2) was observed at VO2 greater than 3 l/min at sea level, greater than 1-2 l/min VO2 at PB = 428 and 347 Torr, and at higher altitudes, at VO2 less than or equal to 1 l/min. These results show variable but increasing VA/Q mismatch with long-term exposure to both altitude and exercise. The VA/Q pattern and relationship to pulmonary arterial pressure are both compatible with alveolar interstitial edema as the primary cause of inequality.\r"

Metabolite concentrations were used with equilibrium constants of triosephosphate isomerase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase to estimate cytosolic pH changes during the rest-to-work transition. Magnesium and hydrogen binding were taken into account. Limits to this approach include errors in the intermediate measurements and uncertainties in values of the equilibrium constants. The former leads to maximum errors of +/- 0.15 pH units, whereas the latter affects the absolute pH value but not estimates of the changes in pH. The estimated pH increases from a resting value of 7.05 to approximately 7.8 by 5 s of stimulation and then falls to a pH value of approximately 6.5 after 3 min of stimulation. The results are consistent with previous studies but permit identification of a larger early alkaline shift. Potential causes for the pH changes are discussed.\r"

During an initial burst of glycolysis (0-5 s) only 3-phosphoglycerate and lactate accumulate. These changes are reversed during the period of low glycolytic flux (5-30 s). During a second burst of glycolysis (30-60 s) most glycolytic intermediates increase. The levels of glycogen phosphorylase a changes in parallel with the initial burst of glycolysis but remain at resting levels throughout the second burst. The phosphoglycerate mutase-enolase steps deviate from equilibrium during the initial burst of glycolysis, suggesting a transiently rate-limiting role. Analysis using a model of phosphofructokinase kinetics indicates that combined changes in cytosolic pH (R. J. Connett, J. Appl. Physiol. 63: 2360-2365, 1987) and free [ADP] and [AMP] can account for the initial burst of glycolysis. The second burst of glycolysis requires other regulatory factors. It is concluded that an initial alkalization is a major regulatory factor in the early burst of glycolysis during a rest-to-work transition in red muscle.\r"

Tco was monitored with an esophageal thermistor probe at the level of the heart. Treatment effectiveness was determined by calculating the amount of Tco afterdrop, length of afterdrop period, rate of Tco increase, and total recovery time. Rate of Tco increase for exercise (4.9 degrees C/h) was significantly higher (P less than 0.05) than shivering (3.5 degrees C/h) but not external heat (3.7 degrees C/h). Exercise afterdrop amount and afterdrop length values (0.95 degrees C and 24 min, respectively) were significantly higher (P less than 0.05) than both shivering (0.33 degrees C, 15 min) and external heat (0.32 degrees C, 14 min). Therefore, although rate of Tco increase during recovery for exercise was faster than for shivering or external heat, as it was preceded by a greater afterdrop length and amount, total recovery time did not differ among the three treatments.\r"

Animal experiments have shown that high O2 can increase risk of serious decompression sickness (DCS). A trial was performed to assess the relative risks of O2 and N2 in human no-decompression dives. Controlled dives (477) of 30- to 240-min duration were performed with subjects breathing mixtures with low (0.21-0.38 ATA) or high (1.0-1.5 ATA) Po2. Depths were chosen by a sequential dose-response format. Only 11 cases of DCS and 18 cases of marginal symptoms were recorded despite exceeding the presently accepted no-decompression limits by greater than 20%. Analysis by maximum likelihood showed a shallow dose-response curve for increasing depth. O2 was estimated to have zero influence on DCS risk, although data variability still allows a slight chance that O2 could be 40% as effective as N2 in producing a risk of DCS. Consideration of only inert gases is thus justified in calculating human decompression tables.\r"

Training was the same in both groups: 15 contractions at 80% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), 3 days/wk for 5 wk. Trained muscles in both groups increased MVC by approximately 15% (voluntary, P less than 0.01; stimulated, P less than 0.05). There was a small (9.5%) but significant (P less than 0.05) increase in MVC of the untrained muscles in the voluntary group. MVC did not change in the control group. Maximal electromyogram (EMG) was highly reproducible pre-to posttraining in the control group (r = 0.92, slope = 0.995) and did not change pre- to posttraining in the trained groups. Sensory adaptation to training caused a reduction in force sensation in the stimulated group (P less than 0.05) but not in the voluntary group. Because there was a small increase in MVC of the untrained muscle of the voluntary group (9.5%, P less than 0.05) but not in the stimulated group, it is possible that there is a central motor adaptation, but it is not manifested in increased neural drive (EMG). Moreover, this central adaptation may be responsible for the decrease in force sensation that follows training.\r"

To determine whether the sensitivity of peripheral chemoreceptors to hypoxia increases during acclimatization, we measured ventilatory and carotid sinus nerve responses to isocapnic hypoxia in seven cats exposed to simulated altitude of 15,000 ft (barometric pressure = 440 Torr) for 48 h. A control group (n = 7) was selected for hypoxic ventilatory responses matched to the preacclimatized measurements of the experimental group. Exposure to 48 h of hypobaric hypoxia produced acclimatization manifested as decrease in end-tidal PCO2 (PETCO2) in normoxia (34.5 +/- 0.9 Torr before, 28.9 +/- 1.2 after the exposure) as well as in hypoxia (28.1 +/- 1.9 Torr before, 21.8 +/- 1.9 after). Acclimatization produced an increase in hypoxic ventilatory response, measured as the shape parameter A (24.9 +/- 2.6 before, 35.2 +/- 5.6 after; P less than 0.05), whereas values in controls remained unchanged (25.7 +/- 3.2 and 23.1 +/- 2.7; NS). Hypoxic exposure was associated with an increase in the carotid body response to hypoxia, similarly measured as the shape parameter A (24.2 +/- 4.7 in control, 44.5 +/- 8.2 in acclimatized cats). We also found an increased dependency of ventilation on carotid body function (PETCO2 increased after unilateral section of carotid sinus nerve in acclimatized but not in control animals). These results suggest that acclimatization is associated with increased hypoxic ventilatory response accompanied by enhanced peripheral chemoreceptor responsiveness, which may contribute to the attendant rise in ventilation.\r"

After SP infusion, inhalation of CO2 in O2 caused a rapid increase in activity that reached a peak and then adapted to a lower level, whereas similar levels of CO2 before SP caused only a gradual increase in carotid body discharge rate without any overshoot in response. Furthermore SP significantly increased the magnitude and slope of the CO2 response. In the other nine cats the effect of intracarotid infusion of an SP antagonist, [D-Pro2,D-Trp7,9] SP (10-15 micrograms.kg-1.min-1), on carotid body responses to 1) hyperoxic hypercapnia (7% CO2-93% O2), 2) isocapnic hypoxia (11% O2-89% N2), and 3) hypoxic hypercapnia (11% O2-7% CO2-82% N2) was examined. SP antagonist had no effect on carotid body response to hyperoxic hypercapnia but significantly attenuated the chemoreceptor excitation caused by isocapnic hypoxia and hypoxic hypercapnia. These results suggest that 1) SP may play an important role in carotid body responses to hypoxia but not to CO2, and 2) the mechanisms of stimulation of the carotid body by hypercapnia and by hypoxia differ.\r"

CVP was obtained using central venous catheters and strain-gauge pressure transducers. Heart rate (HR) was measured simultaneously in seven of the subjects. Measurements were compared with values obtained inflight at 1 G with the subjects in the supine (+1 Gx) and upright sitting (+1 Gz) positions, respectively. CVP was 2.6 +/- 1.5 mmHg during upright sitting and 5.0 +/- 0.7 mmHg in the supine position. During weightlessness, CVP increased significantly to 6.8 +/- 0.8 mmHg (P less than 0.005 compared with both upright sitting and supine inflight). During +2 Gz, CVP was 2.8 +/- 1.4 mmHg and only significantly lower than CVP during weightlessness (P less than 0.05). HR increased from 65 +/- 7 beats/min at supine and 70 +/- 5 beats/min during upright sitting to 79 +/- 7 beats/min (P less than 0.01 compared with supine) during weightlessness and to 80 +/- 6 beats/min (P less than 0.01 compared with upright sitting and P less than 0.001 compared with supine) during +2 Gz. We conclude that the immediate onset of weightlessness induces a significant increase in CVP, not only compared with the upright sitting position but also compared with the supine position at 1 G.\r"

The exhalation dynamics of carbon monoxide (CO), argon (Ar), and lung volume from a single-breath experiment are analyzed simultaneously. A membrane transport coefficient (MTCO) that does not vary with lung volume is evaluated by a two-stage optimization procedure and related to diffusing capacity. Also, the model allows for a decrease in membrane transport rate associated with reduced lung volume. The model is tested by simulation studies and experiments with human subjects having normal or diseased (mainly obstructed) lungs. The MTCO provides a clear distinction between normal and obstructed lungs with respect to alveolar-capillary transport, whereas the semilog slope of the Ar alveolar plateau characterizes the ventilation inhomogeneity. Only when the diffusing capacity is corrected by the Ar slope, DLCO(Ar), do the breathing maneuvers performed from different preinflation volumes (residual volume or functional residual capacity) yield the same results for lungs with ventilation inhomogeneity. The uncorrected DLCO overestimates the effectiveness of alveolar-capillary transport in the presence of ventilation inhomogeneity.\r"

The cyclooxygenase inhibitors indomethacin (10(-5) M) and aspirin (3 X 10(-5) to 10(-4) M), the lipoxygenase inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid (10(-5) to 3 X 10(-5) M), and the combined cyclooxygenase/lipoxygenase inhibitors 1-phenyl-3-pyrazolidinone (Phenidone) (3 X 10(-5) to 3 X 10(-4) M) and BW 755C (10(-5) to 10(-4) M) each caused a decrease in the maximum force induced by FMLP (Fmax) and an increase in the concentration of FMLP required to produce 50% of Fmax (EC50). The thromboxane synthesis inhibitor imidazole (3 X 10(-3) M) also decreased Fmax. The leukotriene D4 receptor antagonist FPL 55712 (5.7 X 10(-6) to 1.9 X 10(-5) M) increased the EC50 for FMLP, whereas desensitization of lung parenchymal strips to leukotriene B4 by pretreatment with this leukotriene (10(-7) M) had no effect on FMLP-induced contraction. After exposure to FMLP (10(-6) M), guinea pig lung produced (as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay) leukotrienes C4 and B4, thromboxane A2 (as measured by its stable degradation product thromboxane B2), and prostaglandin F2 alpha. Lung strips not exposed to FMLP showed no evidence of leukotriene production. We conclude that thromboxane A2 and leukotriene C4 generated in response to FMLP mediate a substantial fraction of the force induced by this peptide in guinea pig lung parenchymal strips.\r"

RT increased (P less than 0.05) in a nonlinear fashion when mass was reduced by greater than 35% in zone 3 lungs (Pa greater than PV greater than airway pressure) perfused at constant pressure (CP, n = 9), a finding predicted by a model of rigid parallel flow channels subjected to loss of cross-sectional area. Furthermore, these findings were not altered by pretreatment with ibuprofen or diphenhydramine (n = 7). In contrast, in zone 3 lungs perfused with constant flow (CF, n = 4), RT did not increase until at least 60-75% of mass was removed. Since Pa and Pc were constant in the former group, but increased in the latter group (P less than 0.05), the attenuation of RT by CF is best explained by vascular distension. This is supported by the finding that microvascular C, as a fraction of CT, decreased significantly with CF, but not with CP. Kf,c and CT (referenced to the initial lung mass) decreased linearly with reductions in lung mass % delta Kf,c = 1.26-0.98% mass removed (r = 0.90, P less than 0.01) and % delta CT = -3.99-0.98% mass removed (r = 0.82, P less than 0.01) relationships that were not altered by blocker pretreatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Using the parenchymal marker technique, we determined regional lung behavior during mechanical ventilation and spontaneous breathing in five anesthetized recumbent dogs. Regional lung behavior was related to the patterns of diaphragm motion estimated from X-ray projection images obtained at functional residual capacity (FRC) and end inspiration. Our results indicate that 1) in the prone and supine positions, FRC was larger during mechanical ventilation than during spontaneous breathing; 2) there were significant differences in the patterns of diaphragm motion and regional ventilation between mechanical ventilation and spontaneous breathing in both body positions; 3) in the supine position only, there was a vertical gradient in lung volume at FRC; 4) in both positions and for both modes of breathing, regional ventilation was nonlinearly related to changes in lobar and overall lung volumes; and 5) different patterns of diaphragm motion caused different sliding motions and differential rotations of upper and lower lobes. Our results are inconsistent with the classic model of regional ventilation, and we conclude that the distribution of ventilation is determined by a complex interaction of lung and chest wall shapes and by the motion of the lobes relative to each other, all of which help to minimize distortion of the lung parenchyma.\r"

Experiments were performed to determine whether total denervation of these receptors by combined cervical vagotomy and thoracic sympathectomy affects the renal responses of the monkey to head-out water immersion, a maneuver that translocates blood to the thorax and elicits an increase in renal salt and water excretion. Macaca fascicularis monkeys first underwent chronic bilateral thoracic sympathectomy or sham denervation performed in two stages a week apart. One to two weeks later, they were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium, and the sympathectomized animals underwent bilateral cervical vagotomy. Control renal function did not differ between the two groups. Immersion of 90-min duration increased central venous and mean arterial pressures by similar amounts in both groups, but heart rate increased only in the sham-denervated animals. Denervation did not affect the magnitudes or delay the times of onset of the increases in urine flow, absolute and fractional sodium excretion, and osmolar and free water clearances occurring with immersion. These results demonstrate that in the anesthetized monkey cardiopulmonary receptors are not necessary for eliciting the renal responses to immersion.\r"

We measured airway area during a slow continuous expiration from total lung capacity (TLC) to residual volume (RV) and during inspiration back to TLC. Lung volume and esophageal pressure were monitored continuously during this quasi-static, double vital capacity maneuver. We found that 1) the area of tracheal and bronchial segments increases with increasing lung volume and transpulmonary pressure, 2) the trachea and bronchi exhibit a variable degree of hysteresis, which may be greater or less than that of the lung parenchyma, 3) extrathoracic and intrathoracic tracheal segments behaved as if they were subjected to similar transmural pressure and had similar elastic properties, and 4) specific compliance (means +/- SE) for the intrathoracic and bronchial segments, calculated with the assumption that transmural pressure is equal to the transpulmonary pressure, was significantly (P less than 0.05) smaller for the intrathoracic segment than for the bronchial segment: (2.1 +/- 2.0) X 10(-3) cmH2O-1 vs. (9.1 +/- 2.1) X 10(-3) cmH2O-1.

We found that sympathetic stimulation abolished all contraction evoked by vagal tone but reduced ACh tone by only one-half. In a second group of cats we compared the inhibitory effects of sympathetic stimulation and intravenous isoproterenol during vagal and ACh tone and also during tone evoked by exogenous 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT tone). Sympathetic stimulation or isoproterenol injection abolished all vagal and 5-HT tone but again reduced ACh tone by only one-half. Our results suggest that catecholamines released from sympathetic nerves or injected into the circulation completely inhibit vagal tone. This inhibition may be partially responsible for inducing relaxation in airway smooth muscle.\r"

Three orders of canine bronchus were studied: second order (lobar bronchus), third order (segmental bronchus), and fourth order (subsegmental bronchus). Paired rings of tissue, with and without epithelium, were placed in organ chambers in physiological salt solution gassed with 95% O2-5% CO2 and maintained at 37 degrees C. For second- and third-order bronchi, epithelium removal caused significant left-ward shifts of the concentration-effect curves for 5-hydroxytryptamine, histamine, and acetylcholine. In fourth-order bronchi, there was no significant shift for any of the contractile agonists. Isoproterenol (during contractions evoked by acetylcholine) induced concentration-dependent relaxations that were significantly greater in bronchi with than in those without epithelium. This effect was most prominent in fourth-order bronchi. These results suggest that 1) the canine airway epithelium releases a relaxing factor, 2) in larger airways the major effect is reduction of contractile responses, and 3) in smaller airways the major effect is enhancement of relaxing responses.\r"

Unilateral left lung injury was induced by intrabronchial instillation of 1.5 ml/kg of 0.1 N HCl. After HCl injury, blood flow to the injured left lung decreased progressively from 0.70 +/- 0.04 to 0.37 +/- 0.05 l/min and percent of flow to the injured left lung (QL/QT) decreased from 37.7 +/- 2.2 to 23.6 +/- 2.2% at 240 min. Exposure to hypoxia (12% O2) for three 10-min episodes did not affect QL/QT in normal animals, but after unilateral HCl injury, it caused blood flow to the injured left lung to increase significantly. A concomitant decrease in blood flow occurred to the noninjured right lung, resulting in a significant increase in QL/QT. The enhanced blood flow to the injured lung was associated with a significant increase in the wet-to-dry lung weight ratio in the dependent regions of the injured lung. These findings demonstrate that in unilateral HCl-induced lung injury, transient hypoxia can enhance blood flow to the areas of injury and increase lung edema formation.\r"

Whereas addition to perfusate of 5 nM phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), a stimulator of exchange of intracellular H+ for extracellular Na+, potentiated hypoxic vasoconstriction, 1 mM amiloride, an inhibitor of Na+-H+ exchange, blunted the hypoxic response. Hypoxic vasoconstriction was also potentiated by the weak bases NH4Cl (20 mM), methylamine (10 mM), and imidazole (5 mM) and was inhibited by the weak acid sodium acetate (40 mM). NH4Cl, imidazole, and acetate had the same effects on KCl-induced vasoconstriction and on the hypoxic response. Hypoxic vasoconstriction was greater in lungs perfused with N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES)-buffered solution than in those perfused with CO2/HCO3--buffered solution. Similarly, lungs perfused with CO2/HCO3--buffered solution containing 1.8 mM Cl- (NaNO3 and KNO3 substituted for NaCl and KCl) had larger hypoxic and angiotensin II pressor responses than those perfused with 122.5 mM Cl-. Because PMA, NH4Cl, methylamine, imidazole, HEPES-buffered solutions, and low-Cl- solutions can cause increases in pHi and amiloride and acetate can cause decreases in pHi, these results suggest that intracellular alkalosis and acidosis, respectively, potentiate and blunt vasoconstrictor responses to hypoxia and other stimuli in isolated rat lungs. These effects could be related to pHi-dependent changes in either the sensitivity of the arterial smooth muscle contractile machinery to Ca2+ or the release of a vasoactive mediator or modulator by some other lung cell.\r"

Antioxidants and antioxidant enzymes, such as the selenium enzyme glutathione peroxidase, minimize or prevent such potentially toxic reactions. This study shows that selenium deficiency decreases glutathione peroxidase activity in liver and muscle (less than 80%, P less than 0.001), increases total glutathione in liver, muscle, and plasma (P less than 0.05) and increases muscle cytochrome oxidase activity, and ubiquinone content (P less than 0.05) but has no effect on endurance capacity. Exercise to exhaustion resulted in a significant (P less than 0.001) elevation of total and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and a significant (P less than 0.05) decrease of vitamin E in plasma of control and selenium-deficient rats. Acute exercise also increased tissue GSSG levels in both control and selenium-deficient groups of rats. Hence, despite a large depletion of selenium-deficient glutathione peroxidase, pronounced oxidation of glutathione to GSSG can be produced by the increased oxidative metabolism during physical exercise. The results suggest that the residual glutathione peroxidase activity is sufficient to detoxify hydroperoxides in exercising selenium-deficient animals and to prevent the impairment of endurance capacity.\r"

It is unknown whether HPV is also diminished in neonates after hyperoxic exposure and if so to what extent such suppression might interfere with pulmonary gas exchange during hypoxic gas breathing. We tested the possibility that hyperoxia would suppress HPV and interfere with ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) matching and therefore gas exchange in neonatal piglets. Twelve 2- to 4-wk-old piglets were exposed for an average of 68 h to greater than 90% inspired O2. A control group of eight piglets was exposed to room air for a similar period of time. Immediately after exposure the animals were anesthetized and instrumented. Pulmonary hemodynamics and respiratory and inert gas exchange were assessed while the animals inspired an O2 fraction of 1.0, 0.21, and 0.12. After 20 min of hypoxic gas breathing, pulmonary arterial pressure rose to a lesser degree in the hyperoxia (H)-exposed animals than in the control (C) animals (P less than 0.02). The increase in pulmonary vascular resistance was similarly blunted. Venous admixture of the insoluble inert gas, sulfur hexafluoride, an index of extremely low VA/Q areas, was increased during hypoxic gas breathing compared with room air breathing in the H-preexposed animals (P less than 0.02). Standard deviation of pulmonary blood flow was increased (P less than 0.02), indicating an increase in mismatching of VA/Q during hypoxic breathing in the H-preexposed animals compared with the C animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The rat is widely used in studies of the metabolic and physiological effects of physical exercise. The most commonly used form of exercise is running on treadmills or mechanically driven running wheels. Rats will not voluntarily run significant distances, under normal circumstances. If rats are exposed to running wheels with food freely available, only very limited activity normally occurs. When rats with access to a running wheel are restricted to a fixed amount of food, presented once per day, consistent running occurs. The running is spontaneous and very sensitive to the amount of food provided. Six 6-wk-old rats of 197 g mean body wt were induced to run for 139 days. The distance run increased rapidly over a 20-day initial period on a food supply of 15 g/day (vs. 19.5 g/day consumption by sedentary controls). From day 20 to day 139 the mean distance run was described by the regression equation distance (m/day) = 10,410 - 37.9 X days. Food provided was varied according to distance run, ranging from 15 to 18 g/day, and was normally 17.5 g/day. Thus a food deprivation of 10% of normal consumption will result in mean distances run of approximately 8,000 m/day. The use of pair-fed control animals without access to a wheel allows the conduct of experiments to test the effects of chronic long-distance running. The running is spontaneous; thus the technique avoids the complications accompanying techniques that force running.\r"

An improved method of constructing such electrodes consists of several steps: 1) insertion of a rod made of a special low-melting point alloy into a pulled glass micropipette, 2) heating of the electrode tip as the alloy is pushed toward the tip, 3) beveling, and 4) gold plating the alloy, leaving a recess of the desired length. This method can be used to make single- or double-barreled electrodes in which the O2 barrel is as small as 2-3 micron. The electrodes retain their characteristics for several weeks.\r"

We used microelectrode recordings of muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) from the peroneal nerve in conscious humans to determine if unloading of cardiac baroreceptors during nonhypotensive lower body negative pressure (LBNP) increases sympathetic discharge to the leg muscles. LBNP from -5 to -15 mmHg had no effect on arterial pressure or heart rate but caused graded decreases in central venous pressure and corresponding large increases in peroneal MSNA. Total MSNA (burst frequency X mean burst amplitude) increased by 61 +/- 22% (P less than 0.05 vs. control) during LBNP at only -5 mmHg and rose progressively to a value that was 149 +/- 29% greater than control during LBNP at -15 mmHg (P less than 0.05). The major new conclusion is that nonhypotensive LBNP is a potent stimulus to muscle sympathetic outflow in the leg as well as the arm. During orthostatic stress in humans, the cardiac baroreflex appears to trigger a mass sympathetic discharge to the skeletal muscles in all of the extremities.\r"

The \"lymph pump\" appears to be regulated by local physiologic forces as well as neurogenic and humoral factors. We have assessed the effects of hemorrhage and endotoxin on the ability of the lymph vessel to propel fluid in sheep using a model system that permits the quantitation of lymphatic pumping in vivo without the complication of variable lymph inputs. A major blood loss was found to enhance lymphatic contractile activity and fluid pumping. Considering the large reservoir of fluid and protein in the interstitium and lymph, we speculate that stimulation of the \"lymph pump\" after hemorrhage might help to re-expand the vascular space. On the other hand, the intravenous administration of endotoxin inhibited lymphatic pumping, suggesting that impaired lymph propulsion in sepsis may contribute to edema by reducing the ability of the lymphatic vessel to remove extravasated protein from the tissues.\r"

  ".U": "88139477\r", 
  ".W": "The increased susceptibility to infection of patients with thermal injury is related to loss of host defense, which is reflected, in part, by the temporal loss of chemotactic function of leukocytic phagocytes. Our studies of patient neutrophils to define the mechanism of this phenomenon involved evaluation of both random and chemotactic migratory functions of patient neutrophils, measurement of receptors for chemotactic ligands, and measurement of receptors mediating substrate adherence of the cells. Measurements of migratory functions were made using the under-agarose technique and measurements of receptor expression were accomplished by flow cytometry using fluorescein-labeled ligand or receptor-specific antibody. We conclude that loss of chemotaxis in response to C5a/C5adesArg is the results of down-regulation of receptors for C5a and of reduced motility, and that loss of chemotaxis in response to the tripeptide FMLP is the result of reduced motility alone. Measurements of changes in the expression of \"adherence\" (iC3b) receptors revealed that up-regulation occurs early and can be sustained for weeks after injury. These results are taken to suggest that either hyper- or hypo-adherence could explain the loss of random migratory function observed for patient cells. Evidence of auto-oxidative alteration of cytoskeletal elements, to produce loss of random migratory function, also is reviewed. Considering the evidence for activation of the complement cascade after thermal injury C5a and C5adesArg are likely primary factors in effecting the down-regulation of C5a receptors, stimulation of secretion to mobilize iC3b receptors, and stimulation of respiration to auto-oxidize cell components. Such evidence of injury-mediated complement activation included data derived from application of a novel immunoassay for iC3b.\r"

  ".U": "88139480\r", 
  ".W": "On the basis of recent evidence, the natural opiate enkephalins, which previously were believed to be confined to the central nervous system, are now known, in fact, to be released from the adrenal glands by sympathetic activation or trauma. To determine if enkephalins (EKs) affect peripheral function, the influence of synthetic leucine and methionine enkephalin (leuEK and metEK) on several relevant functions of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes was evaluated. Initial attempts to detect interaction of leuEK and metEK with neutrophils yielded inconsistent results. Further studies were done using protease-resistant methionine enkephalin-amide (metEKamide). MetEKamide was able to induce degranulation when present at 10(-3) and 10(-4) mmol/L as determined by release of beta-glucuronidase and lysozyme. Using the under-agarose chemotaxis method, treatment with metEKamide resulted in no change of the neutrophil's chemotactic response to an optimal concentration of the chemotactic peptide formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenyl-alanine (FMLP). However, responsiveness to low levels of FMLP increased in cells treated with 10(-3)-10(-5) mmol/L metaEKamide. This appeared to be a result of increased chemokinesis of the treated cells. Scanning electron microscopic studies of cells exposed to metEKamide revealed that treatment resulted in changes in neutrophil morphology. When metEKamide itself was tested as a potential chemotactic agent, 10(-2) mmol/L metEKamide in an opposing well served to induce chemotaxis. Our results, along with those of recent studies of EKs as immunomodulators of T cell function, suggest that neurohormones can function as regulators of the immune response.\r"

A larger volume of allogeneic blood given once was more suppressive than a smaller amount, while administration of syngeneic blood had no effect. The observed blood-induced suppression was indomethacin-sensitive, and antiprostaglandin E antibody given to transfused mice resulted in an augmented CMI. Prostaglandin E appears to play a mechanistic role in transfusion-induced suppression.\r"

Patient serum suppressed T lymphocyte blastogenesis in the mixed lymphocyte reaction test and neutrophil chemotaxis in vitro. Endotoxin removal (affinity chromatography) resulted in a reverse of serum suppressive activity against T lymphocytes but did not reverse inhibition of PMN chemotaxis. Circulating endotoxin levels remained detectable during the entire course while blood cultures remained negative. It is our belief that early endotoxemia (detected before clinical signs of wound sepsis becomes apparent) leads to immunosuppression and other systemic complications.\r"

Results showed that metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint flexion improved an average of 7.46 degrees with passive exercise and 2.65 degrees with static wrapping. Proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint flexion improved an average of 9.68 degrees with static wrapping and 4.28 degrees with passive exercise. The percentages of improvement in the MCP joint with passive exercise and static wrapping were 8.53% and 2.92%, respectively. In the PIP joint, the respective percentages were 3.69% and 8.09%. All differences were statistically significant at a P value of less than .001. It was concluded that in the rehabilitation of hands and/or fingers with recently healed burns, manual passive exercise is significantly better than static wrapping for increasing MCP joint flexion, while static wrapping is more effective for increasing PIP joint flexion.\r"

There was no significant difference in the fertilization rate of oocytes obtained from patients exhibiting either pattern A or pattern B (78 versus 74%) but the cleavage rate was significantly higher in ova obtained from patients who exhibited pattern A rather than pattern B (72 vs 50%; P less than or equal to 0.01). In addition, embryos resulting from fertilized ova obtained from women in group A were of better quality morphologically than those obtained from women in group B (mean embryo grades, 3.9 vs 3.2; P less than or equal to 0.005). We conclude that cycles in which serial serum concentrations of E2 follow pattern A in response to stimulation give rise to oocytes that, when fertilized, yield higher cleavage rates and better-quality embryos than oocytes obtained from women in whom serial serum E2 concentrations follow pattern B.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Ultrasonically guided transvesical oocyte aspiration is a safe and efficient method in most in vitro fertilization (IVF) units. It entails very rare severe complications, even though transvesical punctures performed may unintentionally pierce the bowel or even major blood vessels. Nevertheless, mild complications are rarely noted and reported. During a 9-month period 140 ovum pickups were performed: 102 by transabdominal ultrasound-guided puncture and 38 by means of laparoscopy. In the former group, abdominal pain (11.6%), exacerbation of previous pelvic inflammatory disease (2.9%), mild hemoperitoneum (2.9%), urinary tract infections (5.8%) and transient macroscopic hematuria (5.8%) occurred following the procedure. In the latter group, abdominal pain followed in 7.8%; no urinary tract complications were noted in women undergoing laparoscopic ovum aspiration. In spite of the fact that ultrasonically guided transvesical oocyte collection is an atraumatic method with rare complications, they should be reported in order to draw attention to their not-so-rare occurrence and with the aim of their prevention.\r"

The median age was younger in the one-ovary group (31 vs 32) (P less than 0.05). The group with two accessible ovaries had significantly more follicles aspirated (median, 7 vs 5; P less than 0.001) and more oocytes obtained (median, 5 vs 4; P less than 0.001) per retrieval compared with the single-ovary group. However, the single-ovary group had a higher percentage fertilization (69 vs 62%; P less than 0.05) so that the number of embryos transferred per transfer patient (median, 3 vs 3) and pregnancy rate per cycle (9.7 vs 15.6%) did not differ significantly between groups. We conclude that patients with a single ovary have a compensatory increase in the ability to produce oocytes which may have greater potential for fertilization and subsequent development.\r"

In an attempt to understand the mode of production of embryo-toxic factors in DC serum, we developed a model in which blood coagulation is initially blocked and later induced. The serum prepared in this fashion from whole blood (WB serum) is detrimental to mouse embryo development, as is DC serum. The toxicity of WB serum appears to derive mainly from the platelet release reaction during blood coagulation. Adenosine diphosphate and/or its degradation products may act directly to impair embryonic development and appear to be the main embryo-toxic substance(s) resulting from the platelet release reaction.\r"

Life-table analysis shows that most of these pregnancies have occurred in the first year after entering the program. Many members have undergone only one or two treatment cycles. In the future, greater emphasis will need to be placed on factors which encourage couples to undergo additional cycles of treatment. This, as much as technical advances, may increase outcome figures.\r"

However, no data are available concerning the effects of diagnostic ultrasound on human preovulatory oocytes. This study was conducted to determine whether there were any adverse effects on the reproductive function of oocytes using transvaginal ultrasonography. No effect on fertilization and subsequent cleavage of oocytes was demonstrated. This method can, therefore, be recommended for follicle assessment and as a better alternative to laparoscopy for oocyte retrieval.\r"

Since essential tremor, Parkinsonian tremor and cerebellar tremor can be abolished by a stereotaxic produce applied to the thalamus, a common neural pathway via the thalamic nuclei may exist in these disorders. The existence is therefore proposed of some neural mechanism that controls the higher cerebral function of writing via the thalamus.\r"

This disturbance of rCBF distribution was significantly greater in \"recent\" N+ patients than in \"old\" N- patients, but was not a function of the potential evolution of systemic lupus erythematosus. It was also found that there was a reduction in the physiological high frontal rCBF in the \"old\" N+ patients.

The presence of axonal atrophy in tibial nerve fibres in the leg was subsequently confirmed by histological studies. These changes were not seen in a second group of animals in which similar ligatures were tied but removed after 6 hours. When the ligatures were left in place, the animals developed local plantar nerve lesions in the sole of the foot on the affected side, which were thought to be due to pressure from the floor of the cage. Local pressure changes of varying severity were seen in the foot in all the constricted nerves, but were only occasionally found in control nerves from the opposite foot, or in nerves which had been constricted for a few hours by ligatures which were then removed. These results suggest that atrophic nerve fibres distal to a persistent constriction may be particularly sensitive to local pressure.\r"

The tibial nerve SEPs were remarkably attenuated by interfering tactile stimulation.

Several CT and one MR studies done in this patient during the last 4 years have been normal. Ultrastructural studies of the bone marrow histiocytes and blood lymphocytes disclosed peculiar inclusions. Bromocriptine in low doses proved to be a beneficial therapy for this patient.\r"

The findings indicate that the INAP is recorded by the G2 electrode from the digital nerve.\r"

Median nerve function was more resistant to ischaemia in diabetic patients than in control subjects. In diabetic patients the degree of resistance to ischaemia correlated closely with HbAlc but not with the coincident blood glucose level, the duration of diabetes, the vibration perception threshold at the thumb or the initial median nerve action potential amplitude. Thus in diabetes the resistance of peripheral nerve function to ischaemia is dependent on medium term metabolic control and is not directly related to the presence or absence of neuropathy.\r"

All of them had a labial salivary gland (LSG) biopsy, since a greater than or equal to 2+ score (Tarpley's classification) was considered mandatory for the diagnosis of sSS. One hundred eleven were completely investigated. The diagnosis of sSS was established when a patient with a positive LSG biopsy (greater than or equal to 2+ score) had keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) (positive rose bengal test and/or the combination of subjective xerophthalmia and positive Schirmer's I) and/or xerostomia (subjective xerostomia and decreased parotid flow rate = [PFR]). Forty-four patients had an LSG biopsy score of greater than or equal to 2+, 28 a 1+ score and 39 a negative biopsy. Thirty-four of the 44 patients with positive biopsy had sSS, suggesting a 31% prevalence of sSS in RA. The 1+ score group represents a nonspecific category, resembling the negative biopsy group. Rose bengal test was very sensitive for sSS, whereas Schirmer's I and PFR were not. Parotid gland enlargement was unusual, and extraglandular manifestations, with the exception of diffuse interstitial lung disease, were relatively uncommon in all biopsy groups. No patient complained of xerophthalmia or xerostomia on his/her own. Anti-Ro (SSA) antibodies, detected in 23.5% of the patients with sSS, correlated well with positive LSG biopsy. Our study suggests that sSS in RA is common, benign and subclinical, requiring a positive lip biopsy and specific tests for its diagnosis.\r"

These variables were not statistically different from controls in patients with inflammatory arthritis and in patients with RA not treated with corticosteroids. No correlation was found in RA between plasma selenium biological variables of inflammation and most clinical indices of disease severity. Therefore, acute or chronic inflammation was not the main factor that accounted for low plasma selenium levels in RA. Corticosteroid treatment, particularly at high doses (20-60 mg prednisolone/day), was significantly related to the depressed plasma selenium levels of some patients with RA. The mechanisms underlying this modification remain poorly understood.\r"

Corresponding improvements were also observed on the other main study outcomes of pain and functional ability. Improvement occurred between 12-20 weeks, somewhat later than in other studies. Toxicity included mild hypertension (4 patients) and gastrointestinal intolerance (2). Three patients were withdrawn from CyA due to nephrotoxicity. There was a clinically significant reduction in calculated creatinine clearance but this returned to baseline within 6 months after CyA was withdrawn for all except 2 patients who took 12 months to return to baseline.\r"

Therapeutic effect was good in 26 (23%), and moderate in 30 (27%). No single variable, including HLA antigens, was predictive of effectiveness.

An unusual variant of C4B was found in 6 patients and 1 control. The possible role of haplotypes is considered in interpreting these results and relating them to previous findings in Chinese.\r"

The GAG were fractionated into a high charge \"free\" fraction known to contain chondroitin sulfate (CS) as a major and heparan-sulphate (HS) as a minor GAG and a low charge \"bound\" fraction known to contain low sulphated CS as the only GAG. The concentration of the free GAG was significantly increased in SLE (p less than 0.01); this increase was mainly due to the high concentrations of free GAG in patients with active disease. These patients also had an increased concentration of \"bound\" GAG (p less than 0.05). However, the plasma GAG concentrations did not correlate with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, the binding of native DNA or the C4 concentration. Plasma proteoglycans and/or GAG are known to modulate certain immune functions. Whether the increase in free GAG reported here is somehow associated with the disturbed immunoregulation in SLE remains speculative.\r"

For accuracy, all cases of the original study still available were reexamined. Of the total of 17 cases, 13 were male and 4 female. All had positive tests for rheumatoid factor and 6 had subcutaneous nodules. The male predominance and the frequency of nodules are consistent with other publications. In addition, our study demonstrates the strong association of each of these 2 diseases with its genetic marker: the antigen HLA-DR4 was present in 8 of 12 cases tested and the antigen HLA-B27 was present in 16 of the 17 cases. The coexistence of these 2 classical rheumatological entities in the same patient appears to occur by chance and is probably often overlooked.\r"

Synovial villi harvested from the unstable knee of dogs 8 to 14 weeks after cruciate ligament transection and studied in organ culture synthesized more 3H-hyaluronic acid/microgram tissue DNA than villi from the contralateral stifle joints (p less than 0.02). Rates of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) synthesis by synovial cells isolated from the OA joints were comparable to those of synovial cells from contralateral joints, but cells from OA joints tended to proliferate more rapidly (p less than 0.01). Synovial conditioned medium prepared with villi from the OA joints stimulated GAG synthesis and proliferation in synovial cell cultures to a greater extent than either medium prepared with villi from the contralateral knees, or unconditioned medium. Pronase digestion eliminated the stimulatory effect of the conditioned medium. Our results suggest that soluble protein(s) released from the synovium may mediate the synovial proliferation and excessive secretion of hyaluronic acid observed in this arthropathy.\r"

In addition to these points, we have been impressed with several clinical observations that merit special emphasis: (1) cellulitis adjacent to the affected bursae was frequent (89%) and often extensive; (2) profound edema occurred in 11% of affected limbs; (3) clinical resolution was slow, occurring at a mean of greater than 5 weeks, but at times requiring as long as 20 weeks to return to baseline status.\r"

Though the admissions, as a group, had some positive characteristics (e.g., over 50% reported full time employment over the past three years), they also reported severe problems. For the 30 days prior to interview, heroin was the most commonly used drug, followed by cannabis, cocaine, and alcohol. Less than 10% had never been arrested and subjects reported engaging in crime on 6.4 of the past 30 days. The majority of these subjects had never married, but very few lived alone. The most common psychiatric symptoms reported were depression and anxiety. Characteristics were compared between programs and differences were found in race and age as well as two of the seven ASI areas. Thus, despite differences in demographics there was a great commonality in terms of the characteristics of admissions to these programs. The implications of this for the behavioral problems related to drug abuse and for the development of treatments aimed at specific areas (such as measured by the ASI) were discussed.\r"

Vignettes illustrate clinical problems with intimacy and social isolation, identity as a former addict, and a \"post methadone syndrome\" characterized by vulnerability, dramatic swings in mood, and disordered thinking for a period of up to six months after detoxification. To counteract these barriers to recovery, a program model is suggested that uses curricula available in the emerging literature on treatment of substance abuse.

It was concluded that chronic heavy drinking was the only identifiable factor responsible for the heart failure in three of these patients. Eleven other patients also had chronic heavy drinking as a possible etiological factor of their heart failure in addition to Coronary Artery Disease and/or hypertension. Less than 50% of the heavy drinkers totally abstained from alcohol after seeking medical treatment although they reduced their drinking significantly. All three patients with clear alcoholic cardiomyopathy discontinued drinking and showed marked improvement in cardiac status. The discontinuation of drinking did not appear to be associated with improvement in the remaining heavy drinkers and those patients who reported a history of moderate drinking.\r"

  ".W": "After detoxification has been completed (if needed), a comprehensive assessment of the individual patient's drinking and other problems is the first step in inpatient behavioral treatment of alcoholism. On the basis of the assessment results, treatment is planned and delivered in an individualized manner to achieve three major goals. The first goal of treatment is to facilitate and consolidate the patient's commitment to change by carefully reviewing the evidence from the assessment of negative consequences of the patient's drinking. Alcohol education about the long-term negative consequences of drinking and the use of a decision matrix to clarify the patient's reasons for not drinking also are useful in this regard. The second goal is to stabilize the change in the drinking that occurred when the patient decided to enter the inpatient treatment program. Aversion therapy to decrease desire for alcohol, teaching alternative skills to deal with likely precipitants of renewed alcohol use, and strengthening behaviors incompatible with alcohol abuse all can be used to help maintain abstinence. Antabuse (including behavioral contracting procedures to increase compliance with this drug), along with psychotropic medication for additional psychopathology, are pharmacological interventions that often can be used to stabilize change. A final very important goal is the careful planning of aftercare and post-discharge life to help maintain the changes started during inpatient treatment. A case is presented to illustrate the above notions.\r"

Of the epidermoid cysts, 13 were entirely infratentorial, but the other 10 had an additional supratentorial component. Presenting symptoms and signs were usually long-standing and at onset had often been vague and nonspecific. With time, however, a variety of neurological deficits that depended on the site of the lesion developed. These were generally combinations of cerebellopontine (CP) angle and jugular foramen syndromes, deafness, facial palsy, and motor weakness. Diagnostic procedures have changed greatly over the review period. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging have replaced air encephalography and contrast ventriculography. The better preoperative localization of these lesions allows rational planning of the surgical approach required for optimal tumor exposure, which is essential for any attempt at total excision, considering the large size of the majority of these tumors when diagnosed. We favor operation through a posterior fossa craniectomy for those tumors restricted to the CP angle or 4th ventricle, but routinely use a combined supra- and infratentorial approach if the lesion has a more rostral component. The infiltrating nature of epidermoid cysts within the cranium compromises the extent of excision if neurological deficit is not to be increased, but we attempt as complete an excision of tumor and capsule as possible in the hope that many years will pass before symptoms recur. Cholesterol granulomas seem to respond well to simple cavity drainage and have shown no tendency to recur.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of three operative approaches to the cavernous sinus (CS) and the possibilities of vascular and cranial nerve reconstruction in and around the CS were studied in 50 cadaver specimens (25 heads). The lateral operative approach was through the lateral wall, between Cranial Nerves V1 and IV, or between Cranial Nerves V1 and V2. The superior approach was through the superior wall of the CS after removing the anterior clinoid process and unroofing the optic canal. The inferior approach followed the petrous internal carotid artery (ICA) into the CS after an extradural subtemporal exposure or after a combined subtemporal and infratemporal fossa exposure. The different exposures of the spaces of the CS and of the intracavernous structures provided by the superior and the lateral approaches were complementary. The exposure provided by the inferior approach was minimal; however, the junction of the petrous and cavernous ICA was best exposed by this route. The combined subtemporal and infratemporal fossa approach exposed the petrous ICA (for proximal control or for reconstruction) with the greatest ease and with the least temporal lobe retraction. The combination of the superior and lateral approaches and the complete mobilization of the intracavernous ICA facilitated its repair after experimental lacerations. Lacerations of either the inferior and the inferomedial aspects of any portion of the cavernous ICA or of the anterior surface of the posterior vertical segment of the artery were the most difficult to repair. End-to-end anastomosis was more difficult with the posterior third of the artery than with the anterior two-thirds. A vein graft with an average length of 3.5 cm could be sutured from the petrous to the supraclinoid ICA to bypass the cavernous ICA, with an average occlusion time of 45 minutes. End-to-end technique was judged better for the proximal anastomosis, but end (graft)-to-side anastomosis was easier to perform at the distal end because of the location of the ophthalmic artery. Resuture of Cranial Nerves III and VI could not be performed in fresh cadavers if the gap exceeded 0.3 cm. In 3 specimens, the exposure of Cranial Nerve VI in the posterior fossa through the petrous apex and in the orbital apex was followed by graft placement (bypassing the CS). The complex anatomy of the cranial nerves at the apex of the CS was also defined in 10 specimens. Surgeons who perform operations in and around the CS for neoplastic and vascular lesions will find these studies useful.\r"

Several authors have reported an altered secretion pattern of MLT in patients with pineal tumors and have proposed that MLT may be used as a tumor marker. In nine patients, a pineal region tumor was diagnosed by computer-assisted tomography. Before and after surgical removal of the tumor, several day- and nighttime serum samples were collected and MLT concentrations were estimated by radioimmunoassay. Before operation, five patients presented a normal circadian pattern of MLT secretion. In the remaining four subjects, MLT levels were undetectable or at the limit of detection, with no signs of a circadian secretion pattern. Eight patients were reexamined after tumor resection, when all but one had undetectable or very low MLT levels. The remaining subject, with a pineomesencephalic pilocytic astrocytoma, dislocating but not involving the pineal gland, presented a normal circadian secretion pattern of MLT after operation; in this case, tumor resection was possible without damaging the pineal gland. Thus, before operation, MLT deficiency rather than exaggerated serum levels may be used as a marker for pineal tumors that destroy the pineal gland. After tumor resection, serum MLT may serve to demonstrate complete pinealectomy.\r"

This technique allows visual identification for accurate metabolic analysis of regions with variable tissue perfusion. After 2.5 hours of unilateral middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in the rat, intravenous infusion of the vital dye, neutral red (NR), identified three distinct regions: (a) an intensely stained region consisting of the entire contralateral hemisphere and the medial ipsilateral hemisphere; (b) a blanched region in the lateral ipsilateral hemisphere; and (c) a zone of intermediately stained tissue interposed between the medial and lateral ipsilateral regions. Close regional correlation between NR staining and the iodoantipyrine intensity of adjacent brain slices suggests that NR distribution is a qualitative indicator of brain perfusion. Using the NR staining pattern to guide tissue dissection for metabolite analysis of high energy phosphates (adenosine triphosphate and phosphocreatine) and glucose-related metabolites showed that the blanched region contained ischemic tissue, whereas values from the contralateral cortex resembled those of control tissue. The intermediately stained region exhibited a gradient of metabolic perturbation. Tissue near intensely stained regions resembled control tissue, and tissue near blanched regions resembled ischemic tissue. These results confirm the concept of a metabolic penumbra. When present, it occupies only the most medial area of the intermediate region at 2.5 hours after MCAO.\r"

Although the patient's postoperative memory deficit subsequently resolved, his disconnection syndrome persisted and was primarily responsible for his disability despite otherwise normal neurological findings. We studied a second patient with a hematoma in the genu of the corpus callosum secondary to an arteriovenous malformation (AVM). Although the second patient also exhibited postoperative memory problems, her hemispheric disconnection symptoms were minimal and commensurate with a more circumscribed corpus callosum lesion. Neurobehavioral sequelae of aneurysm or AVM rupture involving the anterior circulation, which may be overlooked in the absence of a detailed examination, can produce persistent disability in many patients.\r"

Serial rCBF measurements corresponding to the clinical presentation and course of the early postirradiation syndrome have not been previously reported. It is our belief that the global decline in rCBF identified in these patients represents a generalized metabolic derangement induced by whole brain irradiation rather than primary vascular changes. A distinction between tumor recurrence and the early transient postirradiation effects can be made utilizing this technique. It also provides a reproducible monitor of the clinical and metabolic impact of radiotherapy for brain tumors. A series of seven such patients is presented with appropriate case histories and graphic representations of the serial rCBF measurements.\r"

  ".W": "Although somatosensory evoked potentials are being used in the evaluation of spinal cord injury and the monitoring of cord function during surgical procedures, their limitations in the face of fluctuations in blood pressure await further clarification. To study the effect of hypotension upon spinal cord blood flow (SCBF) and spinal evoked potentials (SEPs), we subjected five anesthetized lambs to graded hypotension to a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 80, 60, 40, and less than or equal to 30 mm Hg. Five animals served as controls. Maximal hypotension was associated with a significant decrease in renal and sciatic nerve blood flow of 83% and 77%, respectively. SCBF, on the other hand, showed no decrease with hypotension down to a MAP of 40 mm Hg. As hypotension progressed, a gradual but significant slowing in nerve conduction velocity was noted without alteration in the cord conduction velocity from L7 to L1. Control animals demonstrated a decline in sciatic nerve blood flow of 48%, without any change in latency or amplitude of nerve action potentials. These findings suggest that, in hypotension, the peripheral nerve (lacking autoregulation) becomes ischemic, resulting in slowing of nerve conduction velocity with an increase in latency and decrease in amplitude of SEPs. Cord conduction velocity, on the other hand, remains unchanged. Caution is advised in relying upon SEPs generated by peripheral nerve stimulation to monitor cord function in situations where profound hypotension is anticipated. Variations in SEPs may reflect alterations in the peripheral nerve and not the spinal cord.\r"

  ".W": "A new argon laser scalpel (ALS) that delivers radiation to tissue by direct contact was used to perform endarterectomies on atherosclerotic rabbit aortas in vivo. The resultant effects were compared to those induced by CO2 laser (CO2) and conventional surgical endarterectomy (END) to determine whether this instrument might be useful in the treatment of occlusive cerebrovascular disease. Light microscopy of the treated aortic segments revealed significantly more atheroma removed and less damage to the underlying media in the ALS segments compared to the CO2 segments. Electron microscopy showed that the ALS surface and distal intima-media interface were smoother and more even than those of the CO2 or END groups. Prostacyclin synthesis, as measured by 6-keto-prostaglandin F1a levels, was significantly reduced in the ALS compared to the END and control segments. These results indicate that the ALS is superior to CO2 in performing open laser endarterectomies, but such treatment places the atherosclerotic blood vessel at greater risk for thrombotic complications during the early postoperative period that does surgical endarterectomy. It is conceivable that a contact laser may be useful in the smooth welding of the distal edge of an atheroma (i.e., during carotid endarterectomy) and for the transcatheter ablation of surgically inaccessible obstructions of the cerebral circulation.\r"

Laser treatment of tumor attachments, especially those of meningiomas to the skull base, seemed to be effective in eradication of residual tumor.

In contrast to cells placed on plastic alone, which did not grow or attach, the medulloblastoma cells attached readily to the leptomeningeal cells and grew to form enlarging spheroids. The growth of these spheroids was supported with minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum or with human cerebrospinal fluid. Medulloblastoma cells grown on plastic remained viable for 7 to 10 days, whereas those grown on a monolayer of leptomeningeal cells remained viable for 40 days. Electron microscopy demonstrated increased interdigitation of the plasma membrane at the sites of contact between leptomeningeal and medulloblastoma cells, the deposition of fine, basement membrane-like material between the two cell types, and an increased number of cytoskeletal filaments in the leptomeningeal cells. We conclude that medulloblastoma cells can be grown on a leptomeningeal monolayer. This in vitro system may be useful in studying the mechanisms by which medulloblastoma cells attach to leptomeningeal elements and grow after dissemination in cerebrospinal fluid.\r"

All patients underwent operation. Six were also treated with bromocriptine, 7.5 mg/day immediately after operation. A group of 15 patients with tumor sizes similar to those of the first group was followed without medical therapy until signs of regrowth of the neoplasia were evident. No patient of the combined therapy group experienced a recurrence of the disease. On the other hand, only 2 patients of the second group were recurrence-free at the end of follow-up. In the other 13 cases, adjunctive therapy had to be established for clinical and radiological evidence of tumor recurrence 26 +/- 7 months after operation. We conclude that combined sequential surgical and medical therapy may be useful in the management of macroprolactinomas. Our hypothesis must be confirmed by studies that compare patients treated with operation plus bromocriptine with patients treated with bromocriptine alone.\r"

The results of the computer simulation are compared with the findings of CT and magnetic resonance imaging of hydrocephalic patients. The progress of periventricular cerebrospinal fluid edema and ventricular enlargement is well represented by the mathematical model. The model demonstrated that stress concentration in the brain tissue and increased parenchymal hydraulic conductivity play an important role in the generation of periventricular cerebrospinal fluid edema.\r"

Eighty-one patients were treated with suspension laminotomy. This operative technique can be applied to almost all segments of the spine and can be used for all cases that would usually have been treated with conventional extensive laminectomy. We emphasize the necessity of repairing paraspinal muscles and discuss the postoperative spinal deformities and the dural constriction, which seemed to be caused by scar formation after conventional laminectomy. Suspension laminotomy should minimize the negative aspects of conventional extensive laminectomy.\r"

In 1977, as part of a national typhoid immunization program, Thai schoolchildren aged seven to 12 years began to receive annually a single 0.25-ml subcutaneous dose (2.5 x 10(8) organisms) of a heat/phenol-inactivated typhoid vaccine. Isolations of Salmonella typhi in Bangkok decreased from 880 (4.6% of all blood cultures) in 1976 to 54 (0.3% of all blood cultures) in 1985. The case ratio of S. typhi to Salmonella paratyphi A infection declined from 4.1:1 before the epidemic (1970-1973) to 0.9:1 after the epidemic (1984-1985), and the proportion of cases of typhoid fever occurring among children aged seven to 12 years significantly decreased from 30% to 10%. During the same periods S. paratyphi A isolation rates did not significantly decrease (in terms of either total number or percentage of cases) in school-aged children. Thus, mass vaccination of schoolchildren in Thailand with the heat-inactivated typhoid vaccine has been closely associated with a sharp decline in typhoid fever in Bangkok during an epidemic and with continuous control after the epidemic.\r"

The shunt was quantified by recording the temperature after injecting the same amount of cold glucose solution also through a central venous line. Oximetric determination of the left-to-right shunt was used as a reference. The result was expressed as shunt flow divided by pulmonary blood flow (Qshunt/Qp). The regression equation then obtained was Qshunt/Qp by thermodilution = 0.05 + 0.87 x Qshunt/Qp by oximetry. The residual standard deviation around the line of regression was 0.03. The thermodilution technique can be used for rapid assessment of the presence and magnitude of left-to-right shunting, provided that there is opportunity for the indicator to mix adequately in the main blood stream before shunting occurs.\r"

A higher blood flow is needed during cardiopulmonary bypass in older patients and in patients with a raised pre-operative serum creatinine to prevent deterioration in renal function postoperatively.

Rupture occurred into the right atrium (6 cases), right ventricle (6) or pulmonary artery (1 case). Repair was undertaken through aortotomy (6 cases), right ventriculotomy (2) or right atriotomy (1) or through aortotomy + right ventriculotomy or atriotomy (4). In one case aortic valve replacement was performed. All survived the operation. Follow-up averaged 9.6 years. Recurrent fistulation, though with small shunt, was found in two cases.

The early mortality was 4% in patients with isolated MVR and 10% where concomitant procedures had to be performed. Since the use of cold cardioplegia there has been no mortality for isolated MVR and the mortality rate for patients with concomitant procedures has been 3.9%. During the follow-up the rate of thromboembolism was 0.4 per 100 patient years, that of thrombolic encapsulation 0.4 and anticoagulant-related haemorrhage 0.7. Ninety-five per cent of the patients were free from thrombotic or embolic complications at 5 and 10 years after surgery. The survival rate was 79% at 5 years and 72% at 10 years.

In group II the ATP fell to only about 5% of normal values, without significant differences between the subgroups Hearts supplemented with PEP alone or with combined PEP-ATP showed significantly higher levels of pyruvate than in hearts with only ATP supplementation or control hearts.

Reductions in ATP, total adenine nucleotide content and energy charge were insignificant during cardioplegia, as were changes in adenosine and uric acid concentrations. During reperfusion, however, there was slight but significant reduction in total adenine nucleotide content, despite adequate oxygenation as indicated by reversal of lactate accumulation. These observations suggest that the reperfusion phase is accompanied by metabolic aberrations which are not overcome by good oxygenation in relation to the metabolic rate.\r"

Fluid from bronchial lavage performed preoperatively and 4 hours postoperatively was analyzed for granulocyte elastase activity and PMN content. Ten of the 20 patients received methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg b.w.) immediately before ECC. No difference was found between them and the control group regarding C3dg and TCC, and both groups showed similar postoperative decrease of peripheral blood lymphocytes. The postoperative PMN count in peripheral blood was significantly higher in the methylprednisolone group than in the controls from 12 hours onwards. In bronchial lavage fluid the postoperative PMN count was unaltered in the methylprednisolone group, but significantly increased in the controls. No granulocyte elastase activity was found before or after surgery in either group. The results indicated that methylprednisolone does not affect complement activation during cardiopulmonary bypass, but increases the granulocytes in peripheral blood postoperatively.\r"

The median value for recovery of protein from lavage fluid was significantly higher in 21 patients with sarcoidosis than in 19 normal subjects (18 v 11 mg), while the median value for phospholipid recovery was significantly lower (4 v 1.7 mg). There were no changes in the proportions of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol. In addition, significantly less of the neutral lipid, cholesterol, was recovered (3.2 v 1.5 mg). The combined values of three biochemical measurements, non-phospholipid polar lipid, non-polar lipid, and protein, correctly classified all 40 subjects in our series; in a further group of nine normal subjects and 11 patients with sarcoidosis it allowed all but one normal subject to be classified correctly. These results are discussed in terms of alterations in epithelial cell function in interstitial disease.\r"

  ".U": "88146043\r", 
  ".W": "Hyaluronate (hyaluronic acid), a potential marker for activated pulmonary fibroblasts, appears in increased concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with sarcoidosis. The mechanisms underlying fibroblast proliferation are largely unknown but activated alveolar T lymphocytes and macrophages probably play a part; the mast cell is also important for fibroblast proliferation. This study was designed to determine whether there is any association between pulmonary mast cells in lavage fluid, which are known to be increased in patients with sarcoidosis, and signs of pulmonary fibroblast activation. A strong correlation was found between lavage fluid hyaluronate and recovered mast cells (r = 0.72, p less than 0.001). Moreover, mast cell and hyaluronate estimations correlated inversely with lung volume and transfer factor for carbon monoxide, and both indices increased with advancing radiological sarcoid stage. Macrophage and granulocyte counts were normal in lavage fluid from patients with sarcoidosis and were not related to lavage fluid hyaluronate or laboratory signs of the disease in the lungs. Lymphocytes were recovered in increased numbers (p less than 0.001) and were related to the lavage fluid mast cells and hyaluronate. It is concluded that in sarcoidosis release of hyaluronate into the airways is related to the degree of lung disease and to the local inflammatory reaction in the lung as defined by increased numbers of mast cells and lymphocytes in lavage fluid. The findings may reflect a link between the immune system, activation of mast cells, and a pulmonary fibroblast proliferation.\r"

  ".W": "Airway responsiveness to inhaled methacholine and to ultrasonically nebulised hyperosmolar saline was compared in 20 asthmatic subjects. Each subject had two hyperosmolar inhalation tests and a methacholine challenge in random order at least 48 hours apart over a period of two weeks. Hyperosmolar challenge, carried out with doubling concentrations of saline from 0.9% to 14.4% to obtain a dose-response curve, was well tolerated by all subjects. The response to hyperosmolar saline--expressed as the PO20, the osmolarity inducing a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was obtained in 16 of the 20 subjects and in each was repeatable to within one doubling concentration of saline. The peak bronchoconstrictor effect of hyperosmolar saline inhalation occurred at 3 minutes and its mean total duration (FEV1 less than 90% of baseline) was 50 minutes. There was no significant correlation between the PO20 and the PC20 methacholine (the concentration inducing a 20% fall in FEV1). Thus by using a new method to obtain a quantitative airway response to inhaled hyperosmolar saline we found that the airway response to hyperosmolar inhalation differs from the airway response to methacholine.\r"
