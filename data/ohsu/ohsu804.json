  ".W": "To evaluate the correlation of detection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with detection of HIV antibody, 271 simultaneous serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples were examined from 242 persons whose activities placed them at increased risk for HIV infection: 142 from homosexual men, 86 from hemophilic men, and 43 from heterosexual partners of HIV-infected persons. PCR was performed using the gag region primer pair SK38/39 and the env region primer pairs SK68/69 and CO71/72. Amplified HIV DNA was detected using specific oligomer probes. Of 63 HIV antibody-positive samples, 58 (92%) had HIV DNA by PCR. Of 208 HIV antibody-negative samples, 7 (3.4%) had HIV DNA by PCR. On follow-up, 4 of the latter persons were seropositive when next tested; 2 were well and antibody- and PCR-negative; 1 had died of a stroke before retesting. Thus, PCR detects HIV in most antibody-positive persons; detection is increased by use of multiple primer pairs. PCR-positive antibody-negative specimens may indicate HIV infection in which antibody has not yet developed or may be false-positive PCR results. When PCR is discordant with HIV antibody, testing of additional specimens and clinical follow-up are necessary to assess HIV infection status.\r"

Tympanocentesis for bacterial and viral cultures of middle ear fluids (MEF) was done before and 2-4 days after beginning treatment. Patients were followed until the end of antibiotic course. Bacteria were cultured from the preantibiotic MEF in 43 cases (74%). Viruses were cultured from the preantibiotic MEF in 11 cases (19%); all of these MEFs also contained bacterial pathogens. A significantly higher proportion of patients with both virus and bacteria (50%) failed to respond with clearing of bacteria 2-4 days into therapy compared with the group with bacteria alone (13%). The patients with persistently positive viral cultures of the MEF seemed to have purulent otitis of longer duration. Presence of virus in the MEF may interfere with bacteriologic and clinical responses to antibiotic. The mechanism of interference deserves further investigation.\r"

  ".W": "The isolation of Borrelia burgdorferi from blood raises the possibility of bloodborne transmission of Lyme borreliosis through transfusions. To assess this possibility, the ability of B. burgdorferi to survive in human blood processed for transfusion was studied. Human blood was inoculated with B. burgdorferi type strain B-31 (ATCC 35210) at 0.2, 20, or 2000 viable cells/ml, processed by conventional blood banking procedures, stored at 4 degrees C, and cultured for B. burgdorferi at 12, 23, 36, and 48 days of storage. After processing, most B. burgdorferi were found in the packed cell fraction. At inoculum levels of 20 or 2000 viable cells/ml, B. burgdorferi survived in processed blood through 48 days of storage at 4 degrees C. B. burgdorferi was isolated from packed cells after 36 days of storage at 4 degrees C even when the initial inoculum level was as low as 0.2 cells/ml. The data demonstrate that B. burgdorferi can survive the blood processing procedures normally applied to transfused blood in the USA. Since hematogenous spread of the spirochete seems to occur early in the illness, primarily in symptomatic patients, the risk of transfusion-associated Lyme disease may be small. However, the possibility of survival of B. burgdorferi under blood banking conditions warrants a heightened awareness of this potential problem.\r"

  ".U": "90324681\r", 
  ".W": "Eradication of Bordetella pertussis from the respiratory tract occurs slowly even when bactericidal antibiotics are used. The rate of killing of B. pertussis was found to be proportional to growth rate: virulent, slowly growing strains were killed over days, while rapidly growing strains (either avirulent or virulent modulated by growth conditions to avirulent) were killed over hours. Minimum inhibitory concentrations and binding of antibiotics to membrane targets were equivalent in virulent and avirulent cells, suggesting differences in antibiotic response might reflect differences in activities of the autolytic cascade. This was supported by the finding that cell wall degradation was less than 40% per day in virulent strains and greater than 70% per day in avirulent strains. Penem antibiotics, known to rapidly kill even slowly growing bacteria, demonstrated a more-than-twofold greater rate of killing of slowly growing virulent strains compared with ampicillin or erythromycin. This suggests the potential for improved therapeutic efficacy in vivo. Thus, the vir locus, which determines phase transition in B. pertussis, is apparently the first example of a sensor-transducer system controlling phenotypic tolerance and antibiotic-induced autolytic activity.\r"

DESIGN: 1) A descriptive study of the diagnostic process for suspected PE using the new reporting method; 2) a non-experimental evaluation of the reporting method comparing prospective patients and historical controls; and 3) a survey of physicians' reactions to the reporting innovation. SETTING: University of Virginia Hospital. PATIENTS: Of 148 consecutive patients enrolled at the time of LS, 129 were completely evaluated; 75 patients scanned the previous year served as controls. INTERVENTION: The LS results of patients with suspected PE were reported as posttest probabilities of PE calculated from physician-provided pretest probabilities and the likelihood ratios for PE of LS interpretations. RESULTS: Despite the Bayesian intervention, the confirmation or exclusion of PE was often based on inconclusive evidence. PE was considered by the clinician to be ruled out in 98% of patients with posttest probabilities less than 25% and ruled in for 95% of patients with posttest probabilities greater than 75%. Prospective patients and historical controls were similar in terms of tests ordered after the LS (e.g., pulmonary angiography). Patients with intermediate or indeterminate lung scan results had the highest proportion of subsequent testing. Most physicians (80%) found the reporting innovation to be helpful, either because it confirmed clinical judgement (94 cases) or because it led to additional testing (7 cases). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the probabilistic guidance provided by the study, the diagnosis of PE was often neither clearly established nor excluded. While physicians appreciated the innovation and were not confused by the terminology, their clinical decision making was not clearly enhanced.\r"

This paper evaluates a formula for estimating the prevalence of a disease in a population, based on the proportion of patients with abnormal test results in that population and the known sensitivity and specificity of the test. The authors tested the formula by using it to estimate the prevalence of myocardial infarction in 215 patients with chest pain admitted to a coronary care unit, based on results of initial total creatine kinase determinations. The estimated prevalence was 30%. The true prevalence of myocardial infarction, based on established diagnostic criteria, was 25% (95% confidence interval 19.2%-30.8%). To further evaluate the formula, a sensitivity analysis was performed. Errors in estimated prevalence were inversely related to test sensitivity and specificity, positively related to the magnitude of the differences between presumed and true test sensitivity and specificity, and complexly related to the true prevalence of disease. This formula permits the estimation of prevalence of a disease in a population without resorting to the use of a \"gold standard\" test, which is often invasive or impractical. Situations are presented where the formula could be used to evaluate and improve the utilization of laboratory tests.\r"

The lengths of hospitalization, in-hospital mortality rates, and incidences of postoperative complications were similar in the two groups except for higher rates of wound infection and wound dehiscence in the patients with rheumatoid arthritis and a higher rate of thromboembolic events in the osteoarthritis group.

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To study knowledge of and adherence to National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) guidelines among primary care physicians. DESIGN: Cross-sectional telephone survey. SETTING: New York State primary care practitioners; survey conducted November 1988-January 1989. PARTICIPANTS: Physicians in general practice, family practice, internal medicine without subspecialty, and cardiology who reported greater than or equal to 10 hours/week of clinical practice (n = 329; response rate = 63%). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: While 84% of physicians had heard of the ATP guidelines, gaps in knowledge and inconsistencies between ATP recommendations and clinical practices were found. Although the ATP guidelines recommend six months of dietary therapy before starting drug treatment, 41% of physicians would initiate drug treatment for a healthy 40-year-old man with total cholesterol of 7.8 mmol/L (300 mg/dl) either at the initial visit or after one month of lipid-lowering diet. Multivariate analysis of a 24-item knowledge scale revealed that less knowledgeable physicians were more likely to be older, lack board certification, and have a specialty other than cardiology (p less than 0.01). Less knowledgeable physicians were also more likely to consider drug company literature and drug company representatives very useful sources of information about cholesterol (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that hard-to-reach physician groups may require special efforts to communicate consensus guidelines of major importance to clinical practice.\r"

DESIGN: Two groups of patient examination reports written by physicians were retrospectively compared with the patients' responses on the case-finding database instrument. The samples were obtained by sequential selection in four time periods. SETTING AND PATIENTS: The study occurred in a university general internal medicine practice that utilizes the problem-oriented record. The patients studied were seen for first-time comprehensive examinations designed to identify all important health problems, including psychosocial problems. INTERVENTION: The authors compared performances of the physicians in identification of psychosocial problems before and after the intervention, which consisted of a pilot study audit of psychosocial problem identification, establishment of standards for interpretation of the case-finding instrument, design of a flow sheet to make case-finding data clearly available to the physician at each comprehensive examination, and feedback of physician performance according to practice-adopted standards for identification of psychosocial problems. MEASUREMENT: The result of the intervention was an increase in psychosocial problem identification from 67% to 90% of problems present, p less than 0.05 by chi-square distribution; or a decrease from 33% to 10% in psychosocial problems missed by the physicians. CONCLUSION: The quality improvement process for identification of psychosocial problems described in this report significantly increased the rate of identification of psychosocial problems by general internists.\r"

This anatomic study was done to assess where these holes can be safely placed. A study of 20 adult skulls showed that when drilling perpendicular to the bone above the ZF suture, the cranial cavity can be entered as low as 12 mm above it (average, 15 mm). Therefore, when drilling more than 12 mm over the ZF suture, the surgeon should angle the drill at an acute angle to the forehead to prevent cranial encroachment. In addition there is great variability of depth of bone around the ZF suture. When drilling perpendicularly on the frontal bone in the first centimeter above the ZF suture, the orbital cavity will always be entered.\r"

Lateral cephalometric radiographs of 25 individuals (11 males and 14 females) with a mean age of 23.4 years were evaluated presurgery, immediate postsurgery, and after a follow-up period of 7 to 42 months. The mean amount of surgical setback was 5.1 +/- 3.0 mm and the mean amount of postsurgical anterior movement was 0.51 +/- 1.04 mm, representing a 10% relapse of the original surgical correction. The postsurgical relapse of the mandible was not found to be related to the amount of surgical movement. Sixteen of the 18 cases that demonstrated anterior relapse moved forward between 0.5 and 1.5 mm. The amount of relapse was consistent and statistically significant (P less than .05), but small enough that it was not considered to be clinically significant. The findings of this study indicate that mandibular setback with a sagittal ramus osteotomy and its stabilization with rigid fixation appears to be a stable clinical procedure.\r"

The defects were allowed to heal for 6 and 18 months before killing the animals and mechanical testing. Each animal had one side of the mandible restored with 100% AB as control. The fracture strength and section modulus of the opposite side of the mandible, containing the test ratio of HA-AB, were directly compared with the mechanical behavior of the control side. The fracture strength and section modulus were evaluated by a cantilever type of mechanical test that took into account the anisotropic, viscoelastic, and geometric nature of the mandible. The type of bone and tissue at the fracture site was examined by scanning electron microscopy and a direct correlation between the amount of bone and/or fibrous tissue growth around the HA implant material and the fracture strength and section modulus values was established. The average fracture strength of the AB graft sites at 18 months was 9,975 +/- 4,300 psi, with ratios of 25:75 and 50:50 HA-AB giving test results approaching those of the AB graft sites.\r"

The study was performed using intravascular perfusion with 30% Micropaque and 40% gelatin. Six anesthetized New Zealand white rabbits were divided into 2 groups of three. Group 1 rabbits were perfused in the resting, closed-jaw position and group 2 rabbits were perfused while the jaw was held open. The animals were killed with an overdose of pentobarbital and frozen. The heads were hemisected, fixed, decalcified, and embedded in Cedukol. Sagittal sections were cut at the level of the meniscus and radiographed with a specimen x-ray unit on high-resolution film. The 6 rabbits (12 TMJs) demonstrated consistent microvascular differences. In 83% of the jaws in group 2 rabbits the anterior condylar vein was not seen or appeared patchy whereas the same vein was readily seen in all jaws of group 1 (P less than .01). The superior condylar vasculature was distended in 83.3% of group 2 jaws and in 16.7% of group 1 jaws (P less than .05). This study demonstrates significant changes in vascular morphology when the jaw is placed in the open position.\r"

The effects of sutural fusion on the growth of the nasomaxillary complex were evaluated by radiographic cephalometry with implants, and histologic assessment. The immobilization successfully constrained the anteroinferior displacement of the maxilla and zygomatic bone on the fused side. Compensatory responsive remodeling at adjacent sutures and in certain regions of the nasomaxillary complex was observed. Developmental asymmetry was found when the fused side was compared with the nonfused side. No gross anatomic asymmetry of the facial complex as a whole, however, was detected. Adaptive compensation involving periosteal bone deposition occurred at the junction of the lower maxillary process and the maxilla proper on the fused side. This, together with periosteal bone resorption in corresponding areas on the nonfused side served to offset any developmental asymmetry that might have occurred, thus leading to a compensatory preclusion of gross anatomic asymmetry.\r"

Poverty and social disorganization do not directly cause relapse, but problems related to daily life under such conditions represent significant risk factors. The Eagleville Hospital treatment model and relapse prevention programs are described, and it is noted that public-sector women typically present with problems related to being raised in addicted households, residing in drug-saturated inner-city environments, deficits in child-rearing skills, destructive (often abusive) relationships with men, social interactions involving other substance abusers, few (if any) work skills, minimal educational achievement, low self-esteem, and poor self-image. A case study illustrates the course of treatment and relapse prevention efforts with a typical public-sector chemically dependent woman.\r"

In the present study, a retrovirus vector containing a complementary DNA for the human multidrug resistance gene HaMDR1/A was used to transfer the multidrug resistance phenotype to bone marrow cells of the DBA/2J mouse. A high proportion of transduced bone marrow cells showed resistance to both colchicine and vinblastine, as determined by in vitro colony formation of hematopoietic precursor cells. In addition, brief culturing of the cells in a cytotoxic drug following exposure to the retrovirus vector could be used to increase the proportion of bone marrow cell colonies that were resistant. These results may serve as a model for the generation and selection of bone marrow cells resistant to the toxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents in vivo.\r"

Overall, individuals who were extensive metabolizers of debrisoquine were at significantly greater risk of lung cancer than those who were poor or intermediate metabolizers (odds ratio = 6.1; 95% confidence interval = 2.2-17.1). In this study, case patients had lung cancer, and control subjects had either chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cancers other than lung cancer. Results were adjusted for age, race, asbestos exposure, and smoking. Both black and white individuals who were extensive metabolizers of debrisoquine were at significantly increased risk after similar adjustment (for blacks, odds ratio = 4.5, 95% confidence interval = 1.1-18.1; for whites, odds ratio = 10.2, 95% confidence interval = 2.0-51.4). Significantly increased risk of lung cancer was also present for individuals who were extensive metabolizers when subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or other cancers were considered separately. These data confirm that the ability to metabolize debrisoquine is a major determinant of susceptibility to lung cancer. Evaluation of the marker in other case-control settings, further exploration of racial differences, and the prospective evaluation of this marker in subgroups at high risk of lung cancer are areas worthy of further study.\r"

Fluid intake should be increased, especially after dinner. Unbalanced diets should be corrected and avoided (the diet should include different types of food, with vegetables being eaten at every meal and an excessive intake of meat should also be avoided). Three meals a day should be eaten and an excessive intake at dinner should be avoided. The interval from dinner until retiring should be extended. By following these individual dietary guidelines the stone recurrence rate in 199 male calcium stone patients who had received individual dietary instruction decreased remarkably compared to that in male calcium stone patients who had not received individual dietary instruction, not only during the period of outpatient visits but also after outpatient visits were discontinued. From these results we conclude that individual dietary management should be the primary measure for the prophylaxis of renal stone disease in Japan.\r"

The most common presenting signs or symptoms of a dissection were hypertension (94%), an abdominal bruit (44%), headache (44%), minimal proteinuria (44%), microscopic hematuria (38%) and flank pain (38%). Renal artery dissection led to segmental or total renal infarction in 8 of 20 involved kidneys (40%). Seventeen patients underwent unilateral surgical revascularization with amelioration of hypertension and preservation of renal function. Three kidneys were lost due to irreversible ischemic damage from an occlusive dissection. Isolated renal artery dissection is an uncommon lesion that can cause hypertension and threaten renal function.\r"

The new tumor, nodes and metastasis classification facilitates an improved assessment of prognosis by subdivision of the former category pT3 into pT3a and pT3b. The new pN classification permits recognition of an especially unfavorable subgroup (pN3) in patients with regional lymph node metastases. The new stage grouping makes a rough subdivision of patients into groups with different prognoses. However, stages 1 and 2 show similar survival rates. Compared to the commonly used Robson stages, the International Union Against Cancer stage grouping has advantages as well as disadvantages. Any resulting recommendations for modification of stages should be subject to testing by other institutions.\r"

  ".W": "Preoperative axial computerized tomography scans in 163 patients with renal cell carcinoma were reviewed to assess the predictive value for the diagnosis of regional lymph node metastases. Computerized tomography was falsely negative in 5 patients: 2 had metastatic lymph nodes in the renal hilus adjacent to the primary tumor measuring 2 and 2.5 cm., and 3 had micrometastases in nodes of less than 1 cm. In 43 patients enlarged lymph nodes with a diameter of 1 to 2.2 cm. (median 1.4 cm.) were diagnosed on the preoperative scan and this was confirmed at nephrectomy and pathologically. In 18 of these 43 patients (42%) histological study showed metastases of the renal cell carcinoma in the enlarged lymph nodes. In the other 25 patients (58%) the enlarged nodes showed only inflammatory changes and/or follicular hyperplasia. This finding was significantly more frequent in patients with tumor involvement of the renal vein and tumor necrosis (p = 0.0044). We conclude that the sensitivity of preoperative computerized tomography is good for the detection of enlarged lymph nodes in patients with renal cell cancer (95%). However, significant lymph node enlargement frequently may be caused by inflammatory changes, especially in the presence of tumor necrosis. This radiological finding should not be misinterpreted as metastatic disease, unless it has been proved cytologically by fine needle aspiration.\r"

Via this approach ureteropelvic junction obstruction has been treated with an endoscopically controlled incision with a cold knife. While less invasive than an open operation, we have noted significant discomfort from the 24 to 32F percutaneous tract. Accordingly, we sought to achieve the same results by using a less invasive approach, that is retrograde ureteronephroscopic endopyelotomy. A total of 10 patients (9 women and 1 man) with 5 primary and 5 secondary ureteropelvic junction obstructions underwent ureteroscopic endopyelotomy with a 3 or 5F Greenwald cutting electrode passed through a 12F rigid, 10.8F flexible or 9.8F flexible deflectable ureteronephroscope. Preoperatively, ureteropelvic junction obstruction was documented by a furosemide washout renal scan and/or a Whitaker test in 8 of 10 patients. In 2 patients an excretory urogram or retrograde pyelography was diagnostic. Duration of the procedure averaged 180 minutes (245 minutes with a concurrent Whitaker test). At the conclusion of the procedure a 7/14F indwelling ureteral stent was placed. The nephrostomy tube was removed after 3 days and average hospital stay was 5 days. The ureteral stents were routinely left in place for 6 weeks. Followup in 10 patients averaged 12 months. Flank pain was largely resolved in all patients. A followup Whitaker test, excretory urogram or renal scan ultimately has demonstrated decreased or no obstruction in 9 of 10 patients. In summary, early results with retrograde ureteronephroscopic endopyelotomy, specifically in female patients, appear to be promising. Morbidity is minimal and efficacy is satisfactory given the favorable objective response noted in 90% of the patients.\r"

  ".W": "We reviewed our experience with in situ extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy for ureteral stones in 30 patients. The Siemens Lithostar unit was used for stone disintegration and no attempts were made to manipulate the calculi back into the kidney. During the study period 15 patients presented with upper, 9 with mid and 6 with lower ureteral calculi. The mean stone size was 5 x 12 mm. The success rates in stone removal, hospitalization, anesthesia, average number of shocks and kilovolts used were analyzed. Complete removal of all calculous material was obtained in 86.6% of the patients after 3 months. Followup consisted of a plain film of the kidneys, ureters and bladder, and eventually renal ultrasound 1 day and 1 to 3 months postoperatively. Routinely, patients were treated without hospitalization, while 3 had persistent stone fragments and required hospitalization for auxiliary endourological procedures. The average hospital stay for these patients was 1.6 days. Of the 30 patients 13 (43.4%) were treated without anesthesia, 9 (30.0%) received intravenous sedation and 8 (26.6%) had epidural anesthesia. Patients received 3,000 to 6,000 shock waves per session (median 4,000) at 14.0 to 19.0 kv. (median 18.1 kv.), and in 76.9% the treatment was completed after 1 session. Patients who needed more than 1 session received 3,000 to 4,000 shock waves (median 3,000) at 15.0 to 19.0 kv. (median 17.8 kv.) per additional session. Minor complications, such as hematuria, were observed in 33.3% of the patients for less than 24 hours. A small erythematous area usually was present on the abdominal wall at the shock wave entrance site and temporary ileus was noted in 2 patients. In situ extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy with the Siemens Lithostar device is an effective method for treatment of ureteral stones in all parts of the ureter due to the ease of patient positioning.\r"

The symptoms resolved in 2 patients but recurred in 6 shortly after the operation. Voiding could not be established in 4 patients. Self-catheterization was difficult and painful. Ultimately, cystectomy and urinary diversion were performed in 5 patients and is scheduled in 1. The 2 cured patients had a small contracted bladder preoperatively while they were under anesthesia, while all 6 failed cases had a large bladder capacity. Postoperative biopsies from the trigone showed no difference in the amount of fibrosis, the degree of degenerative changes in the muscle and mast cell density between the 2 cured patients and the 6 who failed to improve. The mast cell density and the histological status of the trigone cannot be used as predictors of the outcome of supratrigonal cystectomy. The role of the mast cells in interstitial cystitis is reviewed. Combination of supratrigonal cystectomy and a Mainz augmentation cystoplasty cannot be recommended in patients with intractable interstitial cystitis and a large bladder capacity.\r"

The relationship between autonomic neuropathy and impotence in diabetes was studied in human corporeal tissue obtained during implantation of a penile prosthesis in 19 impotent diabetic and 15 nondiabetic patients. The functional status of penile cholinergic nerves was assessed by determining their ability to accumulate tritiated choline (34), and synthesize (34) and release (19) tritiated-acetylcholine after incubation of corporeal tissue with tritiated-choline (34). Tritiated-choline accumulation, and tritiated-acetylcholine synthesis and release were significantly reduced in the corporeal tissue from diabetic patients compared to that from nondiabetic patients (p less than 0.05). The impairment in acetylcholine synthesis worsened with the duration of diabetes (p less than 0.025). No differences in the parameters measured were found between insulin-dependent (11) and noninsulin-dependent (8) diabetic patients. The ability of the cholinergic nerves to synthesize acetylcholine could not be predicted clinically with sensory vibration perception threshold testing. It is concluded that there is a functional penile neuropathic condition of the cholinergic nerves in the corpus cavernosum of diabetic impotent patients that may be responsible for the erectile dysfunction.\r"

The results of corporeal plication were as good as the other 2 methods. The advantages of this procedure over the other 2 methods are discussed. We recommend this procedure for patients in whom surgical correction of the deformity is indicated.\r"

We selected 75 patients for nerve-sparing retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy in an effort to preserve ejaculatory function postoperatively. This cohort of patients was selected on the basis of clinical stage. Of the 75 patients 73 had clinical stage I disease. However, 14 of these 73 patients had pathological stage II cancer. No patient was treated with adjuvant chemotherapy after nerve-sparing retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy. Of these 14 patients with pathological stage II disease 4 had relapse: 1 with proved retroperitoneal recurrence, and 3 with serological elevations of tumor markers and questionable clinical findings as to anatomical site of relapse. All 4 patients are free of disease after chemotherapy and/or surgical (1) rescue. There were no local recurrences in the 61 patients with negative nodes. All 75 patients ejaculate and had no evidence of disease more than 2 years after nerve-sparing retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy. It is clear that nerve-sparing retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy is a feasible technique. As noted, it can even be applied to selected patients with low volume positive nodes, yet maintaining relapse and survival figures that are acceptable. Ejaculation is reliably preserved when this nerve-sparing technique is applied accurately in retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy.\r"

Furthermore, the sympathetic trunk and its lumbar branches were dissected, including the connections between the right and left sympathetic trunks arising from the L3 and L4 ganglia. On the right side the fibers were found dorsal to the inferior vena cava from where they pass into the aortocaval zone. Caudal to the inferior mesenteric artery these fibers communicate with the left para-aortic fibers. The precise topographic inter-relationship between the L2 and L3 ganglia was studied; the lower margin of the L3 ganglion was located 1 cm. cranial to the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery. Based on these findings a modified operative technique was developed for stages B1 and B2 testicular tumors. With the help of this modification it should be possible to preserve ejaculatory function in 50% of the patients who undergo an operation for small retroperitoneal tumors. However, this modification can be justified only if the recurrence rate is not higher than that with radical bilateral lymphadenectomy.\r"

Prostate specific antigen levels were determined by a commercially available prostate specific antigen radioimmunometric assay (normal range 0 to 4.0 ng./ml.). The paraffin-embedded blocks of the prostate specimens were analyzed by flow cytometry for nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid content using Hedley's technique and propidium iodide staining. A strong association was found between nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy patterns and preoperative prostate specific antigen values. All patients with tetraploid and aneuploid tumors had elevated preoperative prostate specific antigen values. By contrast, all patients with preoperative antigen values of less than 4 ng./ml. had diploid tumors (p less than 0.0034). Prostate specific antigen levels were proportional to the estimated volume of the primary tumor (p less than 0.0065). However, even after statistical adjustment for tumor volume the preoperative prostate specific antigen value was still significantly and independently correlated with deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy pattern (p less than 0.007). However, only 35% of the patients with diploid tumors had antigen levels within the normal range. Conversely, 65% of the patients with diploid neoplasms had abnormally high antigen levels preoperatively. These results suggest that patients with localized biopsy proved prostate carcinoma and normal preoperative prostate specific antigen values are most likely to have diploid tumors; based on a 95% confidence level, the true proportion of patients with normal prostate specific antigen values who also have a deoxyribonucleic acid diploid tumor is 85 to 100%. Since localized deoxyribonucleic acid diploid tumors are known to be associated with a favorable prognosis for patients with prostate carcinoma treated by radical prostatectomy, a preoperative serum prostate specific antigen level within the normal range may help to predict disease outcome.\r"

Of the patients 12 had failed exstrophy reconstruction, 7 had myelodysplasia with a neurogenic bladder and 1 had extensive bladder damage as a result of a previous operation. In 5 patients a continent reservoir was constructed after cystectomy performed in early childhood. Techniques of reconstruction included the Mitrofanoff procedure (4 patients), a modification of the Indiana pouch (12), a modification of the Benchekroun procedure (2), the use of the appendix in situ as a continence mechanism (2) and a modified Kropp procedure using a duplicate vagina for catheterization (1). The morbidity from these procedures was acceptable and consisted primarily of chronic diarrhea (4 patients), stone formation within the pouch (5) and the need to revise the continence mechanism (7). All but 1 patient maintained stable or improved upper tracts after diversion. Over-all, 85% of the patients experienced diurnal continence on an intermittent catheterization regimen, while 75% were dry at night. The plicated/intussuscepted ileal nipples required revision because of difficulty with catheterization (7 patients) and urinary leakage. We currently favor the use of the Benchekroun or Mitrofanoff techniques for the ease of construction and minimal requirements for revision.\r"

The data suggest that the fecal occult blood test, if properly performed, is an adequate screening tool for average risk patients. However, because of the high rate of false negative results this test is inadequate for evaluation of high risk patients. It is recommended that such patients should undergo preoperative screening colonoscopy regardless of the fecal occult blood test result.\r"

  ".W": "Unilateral spermatic cord torsion has been shown to cause damage to the contralateral testis in humans and animal models. In an attempt to explain conflicts among various laboratories concerning the extent of this contralateral effect and to determine the importance of the extent of torsion, prepubertal rats (35 to 40 days) were subjected to unilateral spermatic cord torsion of various degrees (zero to 1440 degrees). Sham surgeries were performed and served as controls (0 degrees of torsion). The animals were allowed to recover from the surgeries and to attain puberty before a period of fertility testing. Fertility, fecundity, organ weight and testicular histological data were obtained after the breeding period. Our data indicate that animals undergoing 360 degrees of torsion exhibited no changes in the parameters studied. However, if 720 degrees, 1080 degrees or 1440 degrees of torsion was induced, a significantly lower percentage of fertile males and pregnant females resulted for each of these experimental groups when compared to those values for the 0 degrees controls. These data indicate that the extent of contralateral testicular degeneration is dependent upon the degree of spermatic cord torsion to which the ipsilateral testis is subjected. The induction of unilateral spermatic cord torsion at 720 degrees or more causes a significant reduction of subsequent fertility while torsion of a lesser degree has little or no effect in the development of this phenomenon.\r"

Briefly, mice were injected subcutaneously with 10(7) disaggregated cells. When the tumors were 250 mm3 in size, tumor necrosis factor was administered, either intravenously or by intratumor injection. Intravenous injection was 10(3) to 10(4) units tumor necrosis factor in the tail vein and intratumor was 10(3) to 10(4) units injected directly into the center of the tumor. Immediately following injection, the tumor bearing leg was placed in a 43.5 C water bath for 20 minutes. Tumor size was monitored once a week for seven weeks and the animals were divided into control, hyperthermia alone, tumor necrosis factor alone and combined therapy. Results of the study showed no significant difference in 10(3) units of tumor necrosis factor intravenously versus control but a significant regression in hyperthermia alone. Anti-tumor effects significantly increased in hyperthermia plus 10(3) units tumor necrosis factor versus hyperthermia alone. Similar results were seen with 10(4) units tumor necrosis factor intravenously though in the combination group of hyperthermia and tumor necrosis factor, eight mice of eight died one to three days following treatment. In those receiving intratumor injections, there was no difference between tumor necrosis factor or control. Tumor necrosis factor with hyperthermia had the approximate same characteristics as hyperthermia alone and therefore there was no synergistic finding. These results reflect on the suggestion that the combination therapy of hyperthermia and systemic administration of the proper dosage of tumor necrosis factor may produce synergistic anti-cancer effects in bladder cancer patients.\r"

Male Wistar-strain rats which had been fed the glycolic-acid diet developed marked urinary calculi within four weeks. Rats in the magnesium-hydroxide, magnesium-citrate, and magnesium-trisilicate groups, however, had almost no stones in the urinary system. Rats in the magnesium-oxide and magnesium-sulfate groups showed significantly less effect than those in the former three groups. During the experimental period, the 24-hour urinary oxalate excretion and concentration were higher in the glycolic-acid group than in the other groups. The urinary citrate excretion and concentration were the highest in the magnesium-hydroxide and magnesium-citrate groups and higher in the magnesium-trisilicate and magnesium-oxide groups than in the magnesium-sulfate and glycolic-acid groups. Similar trends were observed in the urinary magnesium excretion and in its concentration. The urinary calcium excretion and concentration were higher in the experimental groups than in the glycolic-acid group. The urinary calcium/magnesium ratio remained mostly unchanged. Therefore, it can be concluded that alkaline magnesium salts increase the urinary calcium and magnesium concentrations, without changing the calcium/magnesium ratio, and inhibit urinary calculi formation, most likely by increasing the urinary citrate concentration.\r"

  ".W": "Alpha-adrenergic, cholinergic, and serotonergic receptor-mediated contractile responses have been well characterized in the genitourinary tissues of several mammalian species. The present study characterizes the in vitro contractile responsiveness of canine bladder and prostate to the peptides, bradykinin, angiotensin I, and angiotensin II. All preparations contracted to 0.15 M KCl. Bradykinin elicited contractile responses in both prostate (10(-10) to 10(-7) M) and bladder (10(-10) to 10(-6) M). In both tissues, angiotensin II produced minimal responses and angiotensin I failed to elicit contractions. The potent angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalaprilic acid [MK-422] (10(-6) M) increased the contractile response to the prostate to bradykinin two-fold while having no effect on bradykinin-induced contractions in the bladder. Enalaprilic acid did not affect the contractile responses of the two tissues to angiotensin I or angiotensin II. The canine urogenital tissue contractile responses to bradykinin, angiotensin I, and angiotensin II may have relevance to human physiology. Previous studies have demonstrated that human prostatic tissue, specifically benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), has the highest concentration of ACE activity of tissues evaluated. Bradykinin is a potent peptidergic contractile agent in canine bladder and prostate. The activity of enalaprilic acid to amplify the bradykinin-induced contractions in the canine prostate is consistent with high levels of ACE in the tissue. These data confirm the sensitivity of the canine prostate to bradykinin and report for the first time, the ability of bradykinin to induce contractions in the prostate. These studies support the possibility that bradykinin may be involved in mediating micturition under normal and pathological states such as infravesical obstruction secondary to BPH. Furthermore, the results from these investigations in canine urogenital tissues, if applicable to humans, suggest that urinary function be closely monitored in patients receiving ACE inhibitor therapy.\r"

At issue is the long-term risk of the development of malignancy in the multicystic dysplastic kidney. The association between renal dysplasia and neoplasia has not been confirmed, with only 6 cases of malignancy reported. Nephroblastomatosis, a probable precursor of Wilms tumor, has been found in 5 to 7% of the cases of multicystic dysplastic kidney when specifically sought. In an attempt to determine whether a relationship exists between renal dysplasia and neoplasia in terms of abnormalities of cellular deoxyribonucleic acid content we performed flow cytometric evaluation on 30 formalin fixed, paraffin embedded archival specimens of multicystic dysplastic kidneys. None of the kidneys had evidence of malignancy. Nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy studies were performed on single dissociated nuclei prepared by the technique of McLemore and associates and stained with propidium iodide. All specimens demonstrated a diploid pattern of deoxyribonucleic acid, including 3 specimens with nephroblastomatosis or extensive papillary growth, and no specimen demonstrated a tetraploid or aneuploid pattern. The mean G0/G1 fraction was 85.94% (standard deviation 4.59) and the mean S/G2/M fraction was 12.54% (standard deviation 4.72). These findings do not support or negate the potential for neoplasm associated with multicystic dysplastic kidney, since a diploid deoxyribonucleic acid pattern does not eliminate the possibility of the future development of malignancy.\r"

Only 31 of the 40 neonates met all criteria for inclusion. All renal sonograms were normal before and after closure. Urodynamic evaluation demonstrated coordinated detrusor-sphincter activity in 18 neonates before and after closure. During prolonged followup 1 patient had detrusor areflexia and 4 had detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia. Of 11 neonates who demonstrated detrusor areflexia and no external sphincter activity before closure 10 were unchanged on initial post-closure evaluation (4 had detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia during followup), while 1 demonstrated detrusor areflexia with external sphincter overactivity and vesicoureteral reflux after closure. The latter patient subsequently had detrusor hyperreflexia, more severe reflux and upper tract deterioration. She was temporized with a cutaneous vesicostomy. One patient demonstrated detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia before closure and detrusor areflexia with no external sphincter activity after closure, the consequence of surgical division of the neural placode during back closure. The remaining patient demonstrated detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia before and after closure. This patient had coordinated detrusor-sphincter activity during followup. Those neonates who presented with or later had detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia were managed initially with neuropharmacological agents and clean intermittent catheterization. An unsuccessful outcome was managed by cutaneous vesicostomy. Our study demonstrates that neonatal closure of the spinal cord defect does not appear to affect detrusor-sphincter coordination adversely, and re-emphasizes the need for careful and regular followup in children with myelodysplasia to detect deterioration of the urinary tract.\r"

  ".W": "The surgical management of sphincteric incompetence in patients with myelodysplasia is a formidable problem. In 10 female patients and 4 male patients with myelodysplasia a free graft of rectus fascia was used to suspend the urethra, termed the periurethral and puboprostatic sling procedures, respectively. All but 1 patient also underwent augmentation cystoplasty, usually with sigmoid colon. Patient age ranged from 7 to 25 years (mean 12.6 years) and followup ranged from 2 to 27 months (mean 12 months). Of the patients 12 are completely dry on clean intermittent catheterization, 1 has undergone 2 subsequent urethral suspension procedures but remains incontinent and 1 experiences nocturnal enuresis but is dry during the day. The periurethral sling appears to be as effective as the artificial urinary sphincter, the Young-Dees-Leadbetter bladder neck reconstruction and the Kropp procedure in the management of sphincteric incompetence in female patients. In male patients experience with the puboprostatic sling is limited but thus far it is encouraging.\r"

In 59 cases augmentation was performed as part of an undiversion operation. Indications for augmentation included neurogenic bladder, severely scarred bladder from prior operations, noncompliant bladder after previous treatment of severe urethral valves, small bladder in former exstrophy patients, epispadias with a small bladder, cloacal exstrophy, and small, noncompliant bladder after therapy for cancer, trauma, cloaca and miscellaneous conditions. We used 145 bowel segments, since 16 patients had 2 bowel segments. Segments included cecum in 65 cases, sigmoid in 46, small bowel in 24, stomach in 4 and left colon in 1. The most common complication was stones. Detubularized bowel for augmentation of small noncompliant bladders allows functional reconstruction in a wide range of urological disorders that were formerly treated by diversion. Reconstruction is possible in many previously diverted patients if bladder augmentation is used.\r"

Delivery was vaginal in 10 patients, each of whom had the native continence mechanism intact, and by cesarean section in 5, of whom 3 had had prior surgical reconstruction of the vesical neck. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. As a consequence of this study, we recommend that patients who have had an enterocystoplasty alone should not be at an increased risk for incontinence from a vaginal delivery. Conversely, patients who have undergone augmentation cystoplasty and either vesical neck reconstruction or placement of an artificial genitourinary sphincter to attain continence should undergo cesarean section delivery to avoid the potential for disruption of the continence mechanism.\r"

All voiding parameters, renal function and biochemical studies remained normal. Mucus production was higher in the gastrocystoplasty and colocystoplasty than in ileocystoplasty cases. Postmortem histopathological examination of the enteropatch was performed, which showed urothelialization of the graft with native transitional epithelium extending over the junctional margin of the graft and covering the enteropatch mucosa. The enteropatch muscle orientation was maintained in all 3 types of grafts. We believe that the Long-Evans species of rats is a good model for the study of enterocystoplasty.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effects of unilateral testicular vein and artery ligation in the immature rat on the function and final location of the testis at adulthood, 10-day-old male rats underwent either a sham operation or unilateral ligation of these vessels of the still undescended testis. Testicular location, blood flow, size and histology as well as ventral prostate weights were measured 50 days later at adulthood. At age 60 days, it was determined that all testes were descended into the scrotum, and there were no differences in testis and ventral prostate weights, intratesticular sperm counts and mean seminiferous tubular area between the control and sham operated animals. However, there was an 18% reduction in testicular blood flow (ml. per 100 gm. per minute +/- standard error of mean) in the operated animals when compared to the sham (20.43 +/- 1.10 versus 16.69 +/- 0.74, p less than 0.02). These data indicate that although there is a slight but significant reduction in testicular blood flow at adulthood when the testicular artery and vein are ligated early in life, this diminution is not sufficient to alter the ultimate location, testicular weight and spermatogenic function of the testis. This would suggest that after ligation of the main testicular vessels to the immature testis, the collateral blood supply is able to compensate with time to allow normal growth and development of the testis. These experimental observations provide additional support for the 2-staged approach to the high undescended testis whereby the testicular vessels are initially ligated and a subsequent procedure is performed to place the undescended testis into the scrotum.\r"

Bacterial adherence may lead to colonization of the perineum in girls and of the prepuce in boys (if uncircumcised). Nephropathogenic bacteria ascend the urinary tract because of the P-fimbriae of Escherichia coli which adhere to a specific urothelial cell glycolipid. The endotoxin effect on ureteral peristalsis leads to intrarenal reflux, adherence in the kidney and acute pyelonephritis. Complement activation then causes granulocytic aggregation in capillaries with renal ischemia and activates granulocytes to produce the respiratory burst of phagocytosis, which releases superoxide into both phagosomes and the tubular lumen. Bacteria are thus killed as are renal tubules, leading to nephron loss. Untreated, the ischemia and respiratory burst lead to a loss of renal function and scar formation ending as chronic pyelonephritis (or reflux nephropathy).\r"

We performed 8 ureterorenoscopic examinations in 7 patients (3 boys) 3 to 8 years old and have demonstrated that the 11.5F ureteroscope can be inserted without difficulty into the ureteral meatus of a 3-year-old boy. Introduction of the instrument is facilitated by the use of the Perez-Castro irrigation pump. This procedure does not lead to any urethral or ureteral damage, nor is vesicoureteral reflux shown on a postoperative cystogram. This technique allows extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy to be extended also to small children, offering the possibility of easy and successful management of any residual steinstrasse.\r"

Obstruction occurred at the ureterosigmoid anastomosis in 3 patients and at the ureterovesical junction in 3. Obstruction was confirmed by diuresis renography, antegrade pyelography and pressure perfusion studies. An attempt at dilation was unsuccessful for 1 patient. For the remaining 5 patients the ureter has remained patent for a followup period of 7 to 18 months (mean 12 months). Percutaneous balloon dilation of established ureterointestinal and ureterovesical obstruction after failed surgical repair can be successful. The hospital stay is reduced and major surgery with its accompanying morbidity is avoided. If balloon dilation is unsuccessful, surgical repair remains an option. Balloon dilation should be seriously considered as an initial form of treatment in this group of patients.\r"

The 3-month rate free of stones after 1 treatment was 60% and increased to 80% with multiple treatments. The success rate, defined as being either free of stones or with residual fragments equal to or less than 4 mm. in diameter, was 95%.

In all cases deoxyribonucleic acid histograms appeared to correspond with microscopic appearance. Histograms from prepubescent patients demonstrated 85 to 95% of cells in the diploid (2c) peak and less than 10% of cells in the tetraploid peak (4c), representing prepubertal testes without active spermatogenesis. Three distinct patterns of ploidy were identified in postpubertal children corresponding to the histological appearances of normal spermatogenesis, maturation arrest and the Sertoli-cell-only syndrome, respectively. In addition, we identified an aneuploid cell population in the specimen from 1 patient, suggesting that this testis may be at risk for future malignant degeneration. We conclude that flow cytometry of testicular aspirates is an easy and effective means of testicular evaluation, which may permit predictions regarding the fertility and malignant potential of undescended testes in postpubertal children.\r"

The seminiferous tubular diameter in the left testis also was significantly reduced (219 +/- 37 microns) compared to that of the control group (270 +/- 14 microns). Histological changes, such as degeneration of germinal epithelium, tubular atrophy, Sertoli cell hyperplasia and interstitial edema, were observed more frequently in the 7-week group. At 8 weeks these changes were less significant. Our results suggest that varicocele during adolescence has the most damaging effects on the testis in rats.\r"

The relationship of incision site and number of venograms necessary to ensure complete interruption of the internal spermatic system was evaluated to determine if an optimum incision placement exists, minimizing the number of venograms necessary. Our data indicate that the most common etiology of recurrent varicocele in children seems to be residual proximal (central) collateral veins, pelvic collateral veins (that is cremasteric, deferential and crossover veins) rarely seem to contribute to varicocelectomy failure and there is an inherent but low risk of varicocelectomy failure despite radiological evidence of complete internal spermatic vein interruption.\r"

We performed 12 autotransplants in 10 boys ranging in age from 10 months to 14 years (median age 30 months). In each instance the testis had been localized previously by laparoscopy or it was known to be intra-abdominal and was believed to be grossly normal in appearance. The vascular anastomoses of the spermatic to the inferior epigastric vessels were performed by an experienced microvascular surgeon using 10-zero nylon suture and 40 times magnification. Biopsies were taken at operation in 9 patients. Followup of 6 to 30 months is available in 7 patients and all 8 testes are palpably normal and in good scrotal position. This approach is feasible even in small children and the results seem to be superior to the expected results reported with division of the spermatic vessels.\r"

A retrospective analysis of the data revealed that pneumoperitoneum was negative in demonstrating a contralateral inguinal hernia in 59 of 64 patients (92%). Contralateral exploration was not performed in patients in whom pneumoperitoneum was negative. All 5 patients who tested positive had an indirect inguinal hernia upon contralateral exploration and all 5 were less than 3 years old.

The 2 groups did not differ in regard to age or weight, and all boys received a standardized anesthetic with halothane and nitrous oxide in oxygen. Intraoperative blood loss was measured with sponge weights and microcalibrated suction canisters. Halothane requirements were reduced in group A (0.5 versus 1.1 plus or minus 0.1%, p less than 0.001). Measured blood loss was reduced in group A (16 plus or minus 10 ml. versus 31 plus or minus 17 ml., p less than 0.01). Operating time was reduced in group A (92 plus or minus 13 minutes versus 103 plus or minus 14 minutes, p less than 0.05). There was no apparent difference in postoperative pain relief between the 2 groups. We conclude that caudal epidural anesthesia can reduce blood loss and improve surgical conditions during hypospadias repair.\r"

A total of 69 boys underwent this procedure at our institution: 59 as a primary repair and 10 for correction of meatal retraction after a previous failed reconstruction. Cosmetic results were excellent in most patients. Complications included meatal retraction in 2 patients and mild meatal stenosis in 2 in the primary repair group, and meatal stenosis in 3 (with associated fistula in 1) in the secondary repair group. Although not a replacement for meatal-based flap procedures, and more tedious to perform than the meatal advancement and glanuloplasty procedure, we have been impressed with the superior cosmetic results and minimal morbidity of the sleeve advancement urethroplasty.\r"

A total of 35 patients (43%) required a second procedure: 28 (34%) for persistent fistula and 7 (9%) for stricture. These reoperations were typically minor outpatient procedures. All patients had an excellent functional and cosmetic outcome. Although the need for reoperation unfortunately is high, we believe the use of free grafts allows for a better functional and cosmetic outcome because the secondary torsion and bulkiness of the penile shaft caused by the vascular pedicle are eliminated. This is especially noticeable in patients with a small penis.\r"

Only patients with primary vesicoureteral reflux were included in the study. The guiding principle during this period was that all patients with high grade vesicoureteral reflux would be observed on prophylactic antibiotics (observational therapy) and surgical correction would be reserved for specific indications. Of the 300 patients 132 received observational therapy alone and 168 required surgical correction for specific indications after varying periods of observation. In both groups the duration of persistent reflux was analyzed using a life-table method. In patients with grade V reflux we observed resolution in 3 patients whereas 23 required surgical correction. Of those patients in the observation group with grade IV reflux 83% had persistent reflux at 2 years and 70% still had reflux at 5 years. For those with grade III reflux the persistence rate was 83% and 50%, respectively. Neither age, sex nor side of reflux had a correlation with the rate of resolution. When tested grade of reflux correlated loosely (p = 0.07). During the period of observational therapy new renal scars developed in 23 patients (8%). We conclude that high grade vesicoureteral reflux can resolve in a minority of patients over a protracted interval. On the basis of this analysis, we advocate consideration of surgical correction in these patients after a 4-year period of observational therapy and for specific indications.\r"

Long-term urological success appears to be related to adequate pubic approximation. We used fascia lata to construct an anterior pelvic ligament between the pubic bones in 7 patients. In the 6 patients for whom followup is available the fascia lata has persisted and appears to be viable histologically on biopsy specimens obtained at a subsequent operation. Because the fascia lata holds the pubis together so well we have been able to cease Bryant's traction in children by 2 weeks and place them into a cast. This has resulted in early discharge from the hospital in all patients. For these reasons we believe that fascia lata is a useful adjunct in the armamentarium of materials used to reapproximate the pubis.\r"

After surgery the rats were given a low (12%) or a high (36%) protein diet. After a period with a stable glomerular filtration rate, which was longer on the low protein diet, there was a linear decline in rats with an intact single kidney. The rate of decline was highest on the high protein diet, resulting in a shorter survival time. A decrease in urine osmolality and an increase in protein excretion preceded the decrease in filtration rate, while it was followed by an increase in blood pressure. The glomerular filtration rate of the rats with a single damaged kidney initially recovered to 75 to 80% of that of rats with an intact single kidney on the same diet. There was a linear decrease in the glomerular filtration rate, with the highest rate of decrease on the high protein diet. The mean survival time was less than that of rats with a single intact kidney. Proteinuria preceded the decrease in filtration rate, while hypertension was observed later. We conclude that in rats with a solitary kidney renal failure eventually develops. A low protein diet postpones and attenuates this development but it does not prevent it.\r"

The ureter was opacified preoperatively in all but 1 patient: in 65 by retrograde pyelography, in 18 by antegrade pyelography, either through a nephrostomy tube with which the patient was referred or during a Whitaker test, in 9 by vesicoureteral reflux seen on voiding cystourethrography performed before an operation for ureteropelvic junction obstruction and in 7 by an excretory urogram. Of the 65 patients who underwent retrograde pyelography 29 had a discrete area of narrowing. However, 36 patients had something more, including a longer segment of narrowing (13), tortuosity of the upper ureter (8), more than 1 area of narrowing (11), high insertion of the ureter on the renal pelvis (3) and compression of the ureter by the lower pole of the kidney (1). In 10 patients referred for reoperation after failed pyeloplasty there was narrowing of the ureter below the level of the prior pyeloplasty. Although indications for retrograde pyelography are fewer today with the various modern imaging modalities in current use, we believe a retrograde examination should be performed before pyeloplasty if the ureter has not been well shown by other means. The retrograde catheter should be small and soft, so as to create no edema or other injury to the lower ureter. The study is done with the patient under the same anesthesia as the pyeloplasty and not at a previous time. All 114 pyeloplasties in these 100 patients were successful.\r"

When combining any 2 studies (that is planar and pinhole, planar and SPECT or pinhole and SPECT) we were able to identify 97% of the defects, which approached but was not statistically significant at p = 0.09. When data from all 3 studies were combined 100% of the defects were identified, which was a statistically significant increase in defects noted when compared to only planar images (p = 0.016).

The traditional pinhole technique provides 2-dimensional imaging. Recent application of high resolution single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) has provided the means to obtain even greater cortical detail. With 360-degree imaging and computer reconstruction, SPECT provides coronal, sagittal and transaxial imaging. We prospectively compared the SPECT and pinhole techniques in 33 patients (65 renal units) ranging in age from 2.5 months to 18 years. Both scans were obtained in all patients. All scans were reviewed by an independent interpreter. Using SPECT imaging, diagnostic information was enhanced in 46 of the 65 kidneys (71%). Of the 24 kidneys that appeared \"normal\" by pinhole imaging 15 (63%) had defects on SPECT imaging. High resolution SPECT imaging improves the ability to identify cortical defects and visualize asymmetry of cortical thickness compared to standard pinhole imaging.\r"

We compared these methods to the plasma clearance of iothalamate during extended constant infusion. All 3 tests were performed in 14 boys and 5 girls 9 months to 16 years old with urological abnormalities and moderate renal insufficiency. Using iothalamate as the reference, calculated creatinine clearance overestimated glomerular filtration rate by more than 20% in 12 of the 19 patients (63%). Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid uptake grossly overestimated glomerular filtration rate; in only 3 instances was the estimate within 20%. The accuracy of both formulas was better in older patients and in those with more normal renal function. We conclude that the Gates formula for measuring glomerular filtration rate is grossly inaccurate in children with diminished renal function and the Schwartz formula, although better, has a poor level of predictability.\r"

The thickness of the tunica media was measured, and the groups were compared with a Student's t test. In the control groups the injured iliac artery had significant medial thickening when compared to the noninjured (p less than 0.05) from 1 to 42 days after injury. Injured arteries treated with cyclosporine 2 mg/kg/day for 14 days showed significantly less medial thickening when compared to controls (p less than 0.01). Cyclosporine 5 mg/kg/day for 14, 28, and 42 days showed a significant inhibition of medial thickening (p less than 0.05) for each time period. These results show that cyclosporine affects the response to experimental arterial injury by inhibiting the development of medial thickening. The most consistent effects were seen with a cyclosporine dose of 5 mg/kg/day for 2 to 6 weeks. These data also provide further evidence that immunologic mechanisms may modulate vascular proliferative lesions.\r"

A total of 514 patients (97%) were discharged from the hospital with normal radial pulses and/or normal ulnar pulses after a single surgical procedure. Fourteen others (3%) each required one additional procedure to regain a distal pulse, and four patients either underwent two reoperations, received thrombolytic therapy, and/or remained pulseless. Surgical delay of more than 1 day after catheterization was associated with a higher incidence of recurrent thrombosis (12% vs 2%, p = 0.025). In comparison to our previous experience with iatrogenic brachial injuries, the liberal use of segmental arterial resection and overnight heparin anticoagulation seem especially to reduce the risk for early failure in all patients, but improvement was particularly marked in women (25% vs 6%, p = 0.0004).\r"

However, if emergency surgery can be avoided in the medically compromised patient, surgical results may improve. To assess the value of CT scanning, we studied the 1983 to 1988 records of 65 hemodynamically stable patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms, who underwent diagnostic CT scanning for acute abdominal or back pain. Twenty-one patients had a history of severe cardiac, renal, or pulmonary disease. The average duration of the examination was 63 minutes; no episodes of hypotension occurred. Subsequently, 17 of 18 patients with ruptured aneurysms had emergency surgery, with 31% morbidity and 29% mortality. Of 44 patients found to have nonruptured aneurysms, 13 had other causes for their pain, nine were not considered surgical candidates, and 24 had elective aneurysmectomies, with 8% morbidity and 0% mortality. In three patients CT scanning excluded the diagnosis of aneurysm. Additional information provided by CT scanning enhanced the safety of the perioperative management of four patients with rupture and 14 without. In conclusion, the delay imposed by obtaining a preoperative CT scan in patients with possible ruptured aneurysm did not adversely affect patient outcome, and the information obtained from it aided significantly in both preoperative and intraoperative management.\r"

Eighteen mongrel dogs were subjected to subhepatic, suprarenal inferior vena cava occlusion with excision of the excluded segment. At 1 hour, six dogs were killed and inferior vena cava sizes and pressures were measured. All staple lines were intact. The inferior vena cava bursting pressure was 150 to 300 mm Hg. Ten dogs survived to 6 weeks and underwent repeat laparotomy with excision and measurement of the remaining inferior vena cava. Mean diameter was 1.9 cm. No evidence of staple line leakage was found despite chronic pressures to 39 cm H2O: median static bursting pressures were 250 mm Hg. Vein wall thickness of greater than 0.24 mm were all satisfactorily stapled. Histologic examination revealed normal reendothelialization, with improved healing at higher chronic pressures. No evidence of inflammation at the staple line or foreign body reaction was found. We conclude that a triple staple line provides secure, rapid venous occlusion that can withstand supraphysiologic stresses immediately and at 6 weeks.\r"

The classic diagnostic signs of an aortocaval fistula (pulsatile abdominal mass with bruit and high output heart failure) were present in approximately half of the patients, whereas hematuria was a constant finding in all patients. Six patients had macrohematuria, and five had microhematuria. Seven patients (64% survived, and four had postoperative complications: 1 ileus, 2 postoperative pneumonias, 2 deep venous thrombosis, 1 postoperative hemorrhage. The mean operative blood loss was 7 L. After operation the average follow-up time was 4 years. In four patients who died the perioperative (within 30 days) causes of death were renal failure, a bleeding duodenal carcinoma, myocardial infarction, and operative bleeding. It is concluded that hematuria is a more frequent finding than earlier assumed among patients whose abdominal aortic aneurysm has ruptured into the vena cava. The presence of hematuria in a patient suffering from an abdominal aortic aneurysm is an indication for aortography to rule out an aortocaval fistula.\r"

  ".W": "Human saphenous veins were obtained at surgery and assayed immediately (n = 10). The veins were cut into rings, suspended in organ chambers, and connected to force transducers for the recording of isometric tension. One ring served as control whereas others were treated with the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (3 X 10(-7) mol/L), or the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist rauwolscine (10(-7) mol/L). In quiescent rings cooling from 37 degrees C to 24 degrees C had no significant effect. Norepinephrine (10(-8)-10(-5) mol/L) caused concentration-dependent contractions with an EC20 (-log concentration of norepinephrine required to induce contractions 20% of maximal) = 6.97 +/- 0.10. The contractions were inhibited by prazosin (EC20 = 5.89 +/- 0.17, p less than 0.001) and rauwolscine (ED20 = 5.78 +/- 0.11, p less than 0.001). In control rings cooling potentiated contractions evoked at concentrations of norepinephrine below 10(-6) mol/L and inhibited those at higher concentrations. In rings treated with alpha-antagonists cooling depressed the maximal contractile responses. Contractions to the alpha 1-agonist, phenylephrine (10(-7)-10(-4) mol/L), were inhibited by cooling, whereas those to the alpha 2-specific agonist B-HT 920 (10(-7)-10(-4) mol/L) showed a pattern similar to that seen with norepinephrine. The data indicate that the human saphenous vein possesses both alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors postjunctionally, and that both contribute to contractile responses. Cold augments saphenous vein reactivity to norepinephrine by an apparent increase in the responsiveness of alpha 2-adrenoceptors to agonists. The relationship between temperature and adrenoceptor responsiveness may be of pivotal importance in defining the mechanism of cold-induced vasospasm.\r"

  ".W": "Prolonged ischemia to skeletal muscle as occurs after an acute arterial occlusion results in alterations in adenine nucleotide metabolism. Adenosine triphosphate continues to be used for cellular functions, and an ischemia-induced degradation of phosphorylated adenine nucleotides is initiated. In this experiment we demonstrated the time-dependent aspect of adenine nucleotide depletion during ischemia and the production of large quantities of soluble precursors. In addition, we studied the rate of conversion of xanthine dehydrogenase to xanthine oxidase, a potential source of oxygen-free radicals, after controlled periods of total normothermic ischemia (4 hours and 5 hours) and during the reperfusion phase. During ischemia complete depletion of creatine phosphate occurred in both groups, and adenosine triphosphate fell from 22.1 +/- 1.3 to 10.3 +/- 1.4 mumol/gm dry weight after 4 hours and from 21.6 +/- 0.7 to 3.9 +/- 0.8 mumol/gm dry weight after 5 hours (p less than 0.05). During reperfusion, creatine phosphokinase resynthesis occurred in both groups, but adenosine triphosphate levels were not significantly increased (p greater than 0.05). A washout of lipid soluble products of adenine nucleotide metabolism occurred equally in both groups. The relationship between phosphorylated adenine nucleotides as measured by the energy charge potential fell significantly in both groups (p less than 0.05), but after the shorter period of ischemia (4 hours it returned to normal during early reperfusion but did not after 5 hours of ischemia. There was 21% +/- 4% necrosis after 4 hours and 51% +/- 8% after 5 hours of ischemic stress when assessed at 48 hours. In conclusion, the degree of adenine nucleotide degeneration as determined primarily by the length of the ischemic period, may be the most important determinant of the ultimate extent of skeletal muscle ischemic necrosis that results from an acute interruption of circulation.\r"

The current era of educational safeguards permits approved vascular training programs provided that adequate educational experience, operative caseload, and appropriate supervision are ensured for both the vascular and general surgical trainee. The future portends significant changes in general surgical and subspecialty training to enhance the career goals of all surgical residents. Such evolutionary changes are necessary to not only capitalize on the benefits of subspecialty care but also enhance the professional standing and expertise of the general surgeon.

  ".W": "There is growing concern that dieting may adversely affect the metabolic rate and exacerbate efforts to control weight. In this study we measured the resting metabolic rate nine times over 48 weeks in 18 obese women (108.0 +/- 3.1 kg) who were randomly assigned to one of two dietary conditions. Nine patients consumed approximately 5021 kJ/d (1200 kcal/d) throughout the 48 weeks, while the other nine consumed a 1757-kJ/d (420-kcal/d) diet for 16 of the first 17 weeks and a conventional reducing diet for the remainder of treatment. All patients increased their physical activity, primarily by walking. During the first 5 weeks, the fall in metabolic rate was more than double the relative reduction in weight. By contrast, at week 48, the metabolic rate of patients in the two conditions was reduced by 9.4% +/- 4.0% and 8.3% +/- 2.2%, respectively, while weight was reduced by 16.6% +/- 2.7% and 19.5% +/- 2.7%, respectively. Thus, neither dietary regimen, combined with modest physical activity, was associated with long-term reductions in resting metabolic rate that exceeded decreases anticipated with the achievement of a lower body weight.\r"

This study compares injuries sustained by children riding in the back of pickup trucks with those of children riding in the cab. Data were obtained from a multihospital monitoring system and the coroner in a single urban county. The series of injured children consisted of 290 children 0 through 14 years of age, 201 of whom had been riding in the cab and 89 in the back. Age distribution of the children demonstrated that it is most frequently the 10- to 14-year-olds who travel in the back. Children riding in the back were more frequently injured in noncrash events (absence of a collision), had more ejections, had more injuries, and sustained more severe injuries as measured by the Maximum Injury Score. With increased restraint use in the cab, it is likely that even greater differentials in injury severity and patterns would be realized. Education regarding the hazards of travel in the back of pickups and stronger legislation limiting the transport of children in the back of trucks are recommended.\r"

  ".U": "90325463\r", 
  ".W": "Recently, nicotinic acid has been recommended as a first-line hypolipidemic drug. To determine the effectiveness of nicotinic acid in dyslipidemic patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, 13 patients were treated in a randomized crossover trial. Patients received either nicotinic acid (1.5 g three times daily) or no therapy (control period) for 8 weeks each. Compared with the control period, nicotinic acid therapy reduced the plasma total cholesterol level by 24%, plasma triglyceride level by 45%, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level by 58%, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level by 15%, and it increased the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level by 34%. However, nicotinic acid therapy resulted in the deterioration of glycemic control, as evidenced by a 16% increase in mean plasma glucose concentrations, a 21% increase in glycosylated hemoglobin levels, and the induction of marked glycosuria in some patients. Furthermore, a consistent increase in plasma uric acid levels was observed. Therefore, despite improvement in lipid and lipoprotein concentrations, because of worsening hyperglycemia and the development of hyperuricemia, nicotinic acid must be used with caution in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with dyslipidemia. We suggest that the drug not be used as a first-line hypolipidemic drug in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\r"

  ".W": "The number of applicants to US medical schools, which declined steadily between 1985 and 1988, increased slightly for the class entering in 1989. The profile of entering students showed a small decline from last year in the percentage of students with grade point averages categorized as \"A\" (3.5 or above on a 4-point scale) and slight declines in four of the six MCAT subtest scores. The percentage of both women and minority students in the entering class increased from the previous year. An interesting observation is the large percentage increase this year in students transferring to LCME medical schools from graduate and professional degree programs and from osteopathic medical schools. While the number of full-time faculty members in medical schools continues to increase, significant vacancy rates exist in some departments. More than 5% of full-time faculty positions are vacant in genetics, pathology, dermatology, family medicine, neurology, obstetrics-gynecology, orthopedics, otolaryngology, pediatrics, and surgery departments. Along with faculty vacancies, there has been a considerable turnover of medical school deans. The curriculum in most medical schools includes some innovative instructional formats, such as problem-based learning and computer-assisted instruction. However, current data do not allow a generalization about the extent to which these are being utilized. It seems that, at least in some institutions, multiple methods are being used to assess the clinical competence of medical students (observation by faculty members and residents, written and oral examinations, and multiple station examinations), including the use of standardized patients. About half of the medical schools require students to pass the NBME Part I examination and about one third require passage of Part II. The subject examinations provided by the NBME seem to be used widely, at least in the clinical disciplines. Within the past year, about 14% of medical schools have reported the presence of students or residents who have been diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus infection, and 12% have had students or residents diagnosed with hepatitis B virus infection. It is critical that medical schools teach students how to prevent occupational exposure to these infections, as well as ensuring that adequate health insurance coverage be provided for these conditions.\r"

  ".W": "The annual surveys of residency programs on which this report is based have had a higher than 90% response rate for the 5 years previous to 1989. Because of a change to the new electronic data collection system in 1989, the response rate decreased to 78.3%. To adjust for the lower response rate, a regression model computed from data from previous years was developed that permitted projected estimates for 1989 data. These numbers are included in several key tables. The number of GY-1 positions seems to have decreased for 1990, although this may be an artifact of the response rate. Reported unfilled positions, including GY-1 unfilled positions, have increased each year since 1985. The number of new-entry residents (GY-1) seems to be leveling out after decreasing since 1985. Because of the lower response rate, it is difficult to determine the trend in the total number of residents on duty. While the observed number of residents is lower than in 1988, statistical projections indicate an increase of 5% over the 1988 count. Thirty-nine percent of residents were training in family practice, internal medicine, or pediatrics. The number and percent of women in residency programs has remained relatively stable despite a steady increase in the number of women graduating from US medical schools. The percentage of FMG residents has continued to decrease. The percentage of black non-Hispanic residents remains steady. The number of graduates of osteopathic medical schools in ACGME programs has increased 17% since 1987. The number of institutions involved in graduate medical education has not changed significantly during the past 3 years.\r"

The fetal sex predicted by PCR analysis of the isolated trophoblast cells accorded with that ascertained by karyotyping of chorionic villus samples in eleven of twelve women studied in early pregnancy and with the sex of the baby on delivery in one woman studied at 34 weeks' gestation.

  ".W": "In a community-based intervention trial to reduce childhood mortality from pneumonia the intervention area included 58 villages (6176 children aged 0-4 years) and the control area 44 villages (3947 children) in Gadchiroli, India. The interventions included mass education about childhood pneumonia and case-management of pneumonia by paramedics, village health workers, and traditional birth attendants (TBAs) who were trained to recognise childhood pneumonia and treat it with co-trimoxazole. Parents sought treatment, and coverage was 76% without active case-detection efforts. The case-fatality rate among the 612 cases treated by health workers was 0.8%, compared with 13.5% in the control area. After a year of intervention pneumonia-specific childhood mortality was significantly lower in the intervention than in the control area (8.1 vs 17.5 deaths per 1000 children under 5 years); the difference between the areas was greatest in children under 1 year. The differences in infant mortality (89 vs 121 per 1000) and total under-5 mortality (28.5 vs 40.7 per 1000) were highly significant. Mortality from other causes remained similar in the two areas but neonatal mortality due to birth injury and prematurity was significantly lower in the intervention area, presumably owing to the combination of better maternal and neonatal care by the TBAs trained in the project and the availability of treatment for pneumonia. The cost of co-trimoxazole was US $0.025 per child per year ($2.64 per child saved).\r"

Serum from the H twins' aunt and the father and paternal grandparents in the Y family were also HBV DNA-positive. The nucleotide sequences in positions 2701-2800 were analysed. The same point mutation, C to T in position 2735, was present in the HBV DNAs from 7 individuals in the two families. All 4 H family members had the same HBV DNA sequence. The HBV DNA sequences found in the Y daughter, father, and grandfather were identical and they were different from the H family mutant. These results provided evidence at the DNA level of intrafamilial transmission within these Chinese families.\r"

An alternative metabolic route leads to the formation of cytotoxic 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN). To investigate whether these two pathways compete with each other to affect the therapeutic response to 6-MP, 6-TGN concentrations and TPMT enzymatic activity were measured in erythrocytes (RBC) from 95 children on long-term 6-MP therapy for lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). RBC TPMT activities were also measured in 130 control children and 104 long-term survivors of ALL no longer on treatment. The 95 children on 6-MP showed wide interindividual differences in RBC 6-TGN concentrations at the full protocol dose of 75 mg/m2, and RBC 6-TGN concentrations correlated negatively with RBC TPMT activity. Children with 6-TGN concentrations below the group median had higher TPMT activities and a higher subsequent relapse rate. 50 of the 104 long-term survivors had been treated with \"gentle\" low-dose protocols, and this subgroup contained an excess of children with lower TPMT activities compared with normal controls. These results indicate that genetically determined TPMT activity may be a substantial regulator of the cytotoxic effect of 6-MP, an effect which in turn could be important in influencing the outcome of therapy for childhood ALL.\r"

Further treatment was given in 4.1% of the cervical dysplasias. All patients treated in a single visit preferred this approach to the alternative of colposcopic assessment and biopsy followed, after histological examination, by local ablation by laser, excision by loop biopsy technique, or cone biopsy.\r"

Corticosteroids may be useful for patients with the Loffler syndrome and offer only a modest benefit in the majority of patients with neuromuscular disease. The clinical course appears to be chronic, and the long-term sequelae of this disorder are unknown. The etiologic agent remains undetermined; however, studies are in progress to examine the mechanism of eosinophilia, appropriate therapeutic intervention, and the long-term outcome of the affected individuals.\r"

  ".W": "Acquired cystic kidney disease (ACKD) is the result of cyst formation in the failing kidney. It has become more common because of increases in retention of the patients' own kidneys, growth in the dialysis population, and survival of long-term dialysis patients. We studied our chronic dialysis population for ACKD and renal cancers, and conducted a literature review of ACKD and renal cancer. We analyzed our chronic dialysis patients from 1979 through 1989 for native kidney retention, and studied patients undergoing their first kidney transplant at our center from 1967 through 1989. Our patients and those in literature reports were characterized by age, sex, race, underlying renal disease, dialysis time, and survival. We found that: 1) Native kidney retention in dialysis and transplant patients has increased linearly over the past 10 to 20 years and is now greater than 90% in both groups; 2) ACKD occurs in ESRD patients with all types of underlying kidney disease. 3) ACKD affects CAPD patients and HD patients equally; 4) ACKD affects both sexes equally and age is not a factor in the development of ACKD; 5) there appears to be a greater prevalence of ACKD in black patients with ESRD as compared to white patients with ESRD; 6) the prevalence of ACKD is a function of time on dialysis; 7) the incidence of renal cancer in ESRD is increased over that of the general population and occurs 80% of the time in patients with ACKD; 8) renal cancer can develop at any time in patients with ESRD and also occurs in renal transplant recipients; 9) the incidence of renal cancer in ESRD is 5 to 7 times greater in males than in females, and blacks are affected nearly twice as often as whites; and 10) the 5-year survival of patients with renal cancer and ESRD is approximately 35%--similar to that of patients not on dialysis. ACKD is an important complication of ESRD and will grow in importance as the population at risk continues to increase. These results support the need for investigation of 3-year dialysis patients for the presence of cystic disease and appropriate therapy based on findings. Further study is needed to discern the quantitative importance of ACKD and renal cancers in renal transplant patients.\r"

Of these grafts, 33 were first and 7 were second grafts. All recipients received prophylactic corticosteroids. Thirty-four also received prophylactic azathioprine, and 6, prophylactic cyclosporine. Acute rejection occurred in 65% (11/17) of non-cyclosporine treated grafts when the recipient was given 5 or fewer units of blood preoperatively, but in only 18% (3/17) when more than 5 units were given. High-dose steroid therapy reversed the acute rejection each time. Chronic rejection occurred in 2 grafts. Irreversible rejection did not occur in any second graft. Chronic glomerulonephritis, possibly due to recurrent disease, occurred in 1 graft. Five grafts have been lost, 1 each from technical and immunosuppressive complications, and 3 from incidental death. The 1-year actuarial graft survival rate is 95% and the 10-year rate 84%. All surviving patients lead normal lives without significant health restriction, and employ minimal medication. It is postulated that: 1) acute cellular rejection is HLA-independent, and chronic rejection is HLA-dependent, and 2) hyperacute and chronic rejection are related and are parts of a spectrum of humoral immunity.\r"

The eosinophilia in these patients can present before, concomitantly, or after the diagnosis of leukemia. Patients with this syndrome often suffer from the cardiovascular complications of severe eosinophilia, suffering excess morbidity and mortality as a result of their eosinophilia. Treatment of the eosinophilia in this syndrome consists of administration of induction chemotherapy, followed by prednisone and hydroxyurea if required for persistent eosinophilia. Eosinophilia often resolves with remission of leukemia, only to return at the time of relapse in a high percentage of cases. Patients with this syndrome characteristically have cytogenetic abnormalities involving the long arms of chromosomes 5 and 14. These cytogenetic abnormalities are not commonly seen in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and suggest that this syndrome may have a distinct pathophysiology and etiology. The affected region on chromosome 5 contains genes that control hematopoiesis, including eosinophilopoiesis. Further investigations into these cytogenetic abnormalities may provide insight into the etiology of the leukemia and eosinophilia characteristic of this syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Some claim that food sensitivities can best be identified by intradermal injection of extracts of the suspected allergens to reproduce the associated symptoms. A different dose of an offending allergen is thought to \"neutralize\" the reaction. METHODS. To assess the validity of symptom provocation, we performed a double-blind study that was carried out in the offices of seven physicians who were proponents of this technique and experienced in its use. Eighteen patients were tested in 20 sessions (two patients were tested twice) by the same technician, using the same extracts (at the same dilutions with the same saline diluent) as those previously thought to provoke symptoms during unblinded testing. At each session three injections of extract and nine of diluent were given in random sequence. The symptoms evaluated included nasal stuffiness, dry mouth, nausea, fatigue, headache, and feelings of disorientation or depression. No patient had a history of asthma or anaphylaxis. RESULTS. The responses of the patients to the active and control injections were indistinguishable, as was the incidence of positive responses: 27 percent of the active injections (16 of 60) were judged by the patients to be the active substance, as were 24 percent of the control injections (44 of 180). Neutralizing doses given by some of the physicians to treat the symptoms after a response were equally efficacious whether the injection was of the suspected allergen or saline. The rate of judging injections as active remained relatively constant within the experimental sessions, with no major change in the response rate due to neutralization or habituation. CONCLUSIONS. When the provocation of symptoms to identify food sensitivities is evaluated under double-blind conditions, this type of testing, as well as the treatments based on \"neutralizing\" such reactions, appears to lack scientific validity. The frequency of positive responses to the injected extracts appears to be the result of suggestion and chance.\r"

Although preeclampsia is an important and relatively common medical problem, its pathophysiology remains unresolved and the search for a biochemical marker that precedes the hemodynamic abnormalities of preeclampsia continues. We designed a study to investigate the hemodynamic changes that characterize preeclampsia and to evaluate the metabolism of platelet intracellular calcium as a possible predictor of the development of preeclampsia. METHODS. Hemodynamic measurements and spectrofluorometric determinations of the levels of intracellular calcium in platelets in the basal state and after stimulation with an agonist were performed in 48 nulliparous black women during each trimester of pregnancy. The data on the 14 women (29 percent) in whom preeclampsia developed were then compared with the data on the other 34, who served as normotensive controls. RESULTS. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the basal levels of intracellular calcium at any time. In contrast, the levels measured after arginine vasopressin was administered during the first trimester indicated an exaggerated response in the group with preeclampsia as compared with the control group (1494 +/- 388 [+/- SEM] percent vs. 545 +/- 55 percent of base line; P less than 0.0002), which was sustained through the second and third trimesters. All but three of the women with preeclampsia had responses higher than the highest response among the controls. Platelet intracellular calcium responses to arginine vasopressin during the first trimester were a sensitive predictor of the subsequent development of preeclampsia (P less than 0.00009). Although vascular resistance was similar in the two groups during the first trimester, it subsequently decreased in the control group (P less than 0.02) but not in the group with preeclampsia. CONCLUSIONS. Our findings indicate that preeclampsia is characterized by the absence of the normal pregnancy-related decrease in vascular resistance, which is preceded in most instances by an exaggerated response of platelet intracellular calcium to arginine vasopressin early in pregnancy. We therefore propose that an increase in the sensitivity of platelet calcium to arginine vasopressin can be used as an early predictor of subsequent preeclampsia.\r"

We placed 34 women (mean age, 26 years) and 25 men (mean age, 25 years) on three mixed natural diets of identical nutrient composition, except that 10 percent of the daily energy intake was provided as oleic acid (which contains one cis double bond), trans isomers of oleic acid, or saturated fatty acids. The three diets were consumed for three weeks each, in random order. RESULTS. On the oleic acid diet, the mean (+/- SD) serum values for the entire group for total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were 4.46 +/- 0.66. 2.67 +/- 0.54, and 1.42 +/- 0.32 mmol per liter (172 +/- 26, 103 +/- 21, and 55 +/- 12 mg per deciliter), respectively. On the trans-fatty-acid diet, the subjects' mean HDL cholesterol level was 0.17 mmol per liter (7 mg per deciliter) lower than the mean value on the diet high in oleic acid (P less than 0.0001; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.13 to 0.20 mmol per liter). The HDL cholesterol level on the saturated-fat diet was the same as on the oleic acid diet. The LDL cholesterol level was 0.37 mmol per liter (14 mg per deciliter) higher on the trans-fatty-acid diet than on the oleic acid diet (P less than 0.0001; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.28 to 0.45 mmol per liter) and 0.47 mmol per liter (18 mg per deciliter) higher on the saturated-fat diet (P less than 0.001; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.39 to 0.55 mmol per liter) than on the oleic acid diet. The effects on lipoprotein levels did not differ between women and men. CONCLUSIONS. The effect of trans fatty acids on the serum lipoprotein profile is at least as unfavorable as that of the cholesterol-raising saturated fatty acids, because they not only raise LDL cholesterol levels but also lower HDL cholesterol levels.\r"

This puzzling independence of energy cost and speed is found generally among running animals, although, on a per gram basis, cost is much higher for smaller animals. Running involves little work against the environment; work is done by muscles and tendons to lift and accelerate the body and limbs. Some of the work is recovered from muscle-tendon springs without metabolic cost and work rate does not parallel metabolic rate with either speed or size. Regardless of the amount of work muscles do, they must be activated and develop force to support the weight of the body. Load-carrying experiments have shown that the cost of supporting an extra newton of load is the same as the weight-specific cost of running. Size differences in cost are proportional to stride frequency at equivalent speeds, suggesting that the time available for developing force is important in determining cost. We report a simple inverse relationship between the rate of energy used for running and the time the foot applies force to the ground during each stride. These results support the hypothesis that it is primarily the cost of supporting the animal's weight and the time course of generating this force that determines the cost of running.\r"

  ".W": "Reading and writing require access to stored knowledge about the spelling of words. Presumably, we recognize chair but not chare or chiar as a word of English, and similarly would write 'chair' but not 'chare' or 'chiar', because we access orthographic representations that specify the identity and the order of the graphemes (abstract letter representations) that comprise the spelling of words. Thus, a fundamental problem concerns the content and structure of the hypothesized orthographic representations, and how information about grapheme order is represented and processed. We present evidence from a brain-damaged patient (N.G.) with unilateral neglect that this information is coded spatially. Unilateral neglect is a disorder clinically characterized by the inability to perceive or respond to stimuli presented to the side contralateral to the site of lesion, despite the absence of significant sensory or motor deficits. The patient made reading and spelling errors only on the right half of words, regardless of length. Furthermore, she produced the same pattern of errors in reading and spelling, irrespective of the topographic arrangement of stimuli in reading (horizontal, vertical or mirror-reversed words) and of the type of response in spelling (written, oral or backward oral spelling). This pattern of performance suggests that order information in orthographic representations is coded spatially in a word-centred coordinate system; that is, in a spatially defined coordinate frame whose centre corresponds to the midpoint of a canonical, orientation-invariant representation of the word and not the midpoint of the word stimulus.\r"

IL-2 is also implicated in autoimmune disease, although its role is still controversial. Murine systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a good model for human SLE as most of the immunological abnormalities in the human disease also seem to be operative in the mouse. Among SLE mice, the MRL/lpr strain develops early in life autoimmune diseases such as immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis, arthritis and arteritis. Lymphoid abnormalities associated with those diseases in this strain are thymic atrophy and abnormal proliferation of CD3+ CD4- CD8- 'double-negative' T cells, resulting in massive generalized lymph node enlargement. We have therefore now examined the effects of IL-2 on the disease progression in MRL/lpr mice using live vaccinia recombinant viruses expressing the human IL-2 gene. Vaccinated mice showed prolonged survival, decreased autoantibody and rheumatoid factor titres, marked attenuation of kidney interstitial infiltration and intraglomerular proliferation, as well as clearance of synovial mononuclear infiltrates. Inoculation with the IL-2/vaccinia recombinant virus led, in addition, to drastic reduction of the double-negative T-cell population, improved thymic differentiation and restoration of normal values of mature cells in peripheral lymphoid organs.\r"

TNF-alpha was first described in activated macrophages, but certain mouse or rat mast cell populations (reviewed in refs 4,5) and some in vitro-derived human cells with cytochemical features of mast cells-basophils may also contain products similar to TNF-alpha. Here we present evidence that resident mouse peritoneal mast cells constitutively contain large amounts of TNF-alpha bioactivity, whereas cultured, immature mast cells vary in their TNF-alpha content. IgE-dependent activation of cultured or peritoneal mast cells induces extracellular release of TNF-alpha and augments levels of TNF-alpha messenger RNA and bioactivity. These findings identify mouse mast cells as an important source of both preformed and immunologically inducible TNF-alpha, and suggest that release of TNF-alpha by mast cells may contribute to host defence, the pathophysiology of allergic diseases and other processes dependent on TNF-alpha.\r"

  ".W": "Binding of glycoprotein gp120 to the T cell-surface receptor CD4 is a crucial step in CD4-dependent infection of a target cell by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Blocking some or all gp120 molecules on the viral surface should therefore inhibit infection. Consequently, competitive receptor inhibitors, such as soluble synthetic CD4 (sCD4), synthetic CD4 peptides and immunoglobulins, have been investigated in vitro and in vivo, but little is known about the molecular mechanisms of these inhibitors. We have now quantitatively examined blocking by soluble CD4 in the hope of gaining insight into the complex process of viral binding, adsorption and penetration. At low sCD4 concentrations, the inhibition in three HIV strains is proportional to the binding of gp120. The biological association constant (gp120-sCD4 Kassoc) for HIV-2NIHZ is (8.5 +/- 0.5) x 10(7) M-1, whereas Kassoc for HIV-1HXB3 (1.4 +/- 0.2) and HIV-1MN (1.7 +/- 0.1) x 10(9) M-1 are 15-20-fold larger. For all three viral strains, the biological Kassoc from infectivity assays is comparable to the chemical Kassoc. The inhibitory action of sCD4 at high concentrations, however, is not fully explained by simple proportionality with the binding to gp120. Positive synergy in blocking of infection occurs after about half the viral gp120s molecules are occupied, and is identical for all three viral strains, despite the large differences in Kassoc. Our method of measuring the viral-cell receptor Kassoc directly from infectivity assays is applicable to immunoglobulins, to other viruses and to assays using primary or transformed cell lines.\r"

  ".U": "90326161\r", 
  ".W": "Whether a human embryo develops as a male or a female is determined by the presence of the Y chromosome. The sex-determining function lies entirely in interval 1A, inasmuch as most XX individuals with descended testes and normal male external genitalia carry this small region of the Y chromosome. We have localized an essential part of the sex-determining function to a portion of interval 1A, on the basis of the discovery of a female with a reciprocal Y;22 translocation and part of 1A deleted at the translocation breakpoint. Recently, a paradox has arisen with the report of four partially masculinized XX individuals who carry only a portion of interval 1A--a portion that does not overlap the deletion in the X,t(Y;22) female. These recent findings imply that the sex-determining function lies in the portion of 1A present in the four XX intersexes and not in the portion deleted in the X,t(Y;22) female. To explain the X,t(Y;22) individual, it was proposed that she was female because of a chromosomal position effect or delayed development of the gonadal soma. Here we report that the X,t(Y;22) female has a deletion of a second portion of interval 1A--a portion corresponding closely to that present in the XX intersexes. This resolves the apparent contradiction. Nonetheless, phenotype-genotype correlations suggest that two or more genetic elements in interval 1A may contribute to the sex-determining function of the Y chromosome. The X,t(Y;22) female lacks the ZFY gene but does not exhibit the complex phenotype known as Turner's syndrome, arguing against the hypothesis that ZFY is the Turner's syndrome gene on the Y chromosome.\r"

  ".U": "90326162\r", 
  ".W": "Decorin is a small chondroitin-dermatan sulphate proteoglycan consisting of a core protein and a single glycosaminoglycan chain. Eighty per cent of the core protein consists of 10 repeats of a leucin-rich sequence of 24 amino acids. Similar repeats have been found in two other proteoglycans, biglycan and fibromodulin, and in several other proteins including Drosophila morphogenetic proteins. Expression of high levels of decorin in Chinese hamster ovary cells has a dramatic effect on their morphology and growth properties. We now report that this effect is due at least in part to the ability of decorin to bind transforming growth factor-beta, an autocrine factor that stimulates the growth of Chinese hamster ovary cells. As transforming growth factor-beta induces synthesis of decorin in many cell types, our results suggest that decorin may be a component of a feedback system regulating cell growth.\r"

  ".W": "The scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) has been used to visualize DNA under water, under oil and in air. Images of single-stranded DNA have shown that submolecular resolution is possible. Here we describe atomic-resolution imaging of duplex DNA. Topographic STM images of uncoated duplex DNA on a graphite substrate obtained in ultra-high vacuum are presented that show double-helical structure, base pairs, and atomic-scale substructure. Experimental STM profiles show excellent correlation with atomic contours of the van der Waals surface of A-form DNA derived from X-ray crystallography. A comparison of variations in the barrier to quantum mechanical tunnelling (barrier-height) with atomic-scale topography shows correlation over the phosphate-sugar backbone but anticorrelation over the base pairs. This relationship may be due to the different chemical characteristics of parts of the molecule. Further investigation of this phenomenon should lead to a better understanding of the physics of imaging adsorbates with the STM and may prove useful in sequencing DNA. The improved resolution compared with previously published STM images of DNA may be attributable to ultra-high vacuum, high data-pixel density, slow scan rate, a fortuitously clean and sharp tip and/or a relatively dilute and extremely clean sample solution. This work demonstrates the potential of the STM for characterization of large biomolecular structures, but additional development will be required to make such high resolution imaging of DNA and other large molecules routine.\r"

Whereas there has been much work on the latter topic since the elucidation of the double-helical structure of DNA, comparatively little has been done on structural and/or functional models, probably owing to the lack of self-organizing molecular systems. Here we present a class of artificial systems, the nucleohelicates, which are of interest from both points of view because they combine the double-helical structure of the double-stranded metal complexes, the helicates, with the selective interaction features of nucleic-acid bases. These functionalized species allow the study of structural effects on the formation of the double helix and on the binding to other entities, in particular to nucleic acids.\r"

In visual cortex, cells in layers 2 and 3 project to other cortical areas, whereas cells in layers 5 and 6 project to subcortical targets such as the lateral geniculate nucleus. The proper development of these projections is crucial for correct functioning of the visual system. Here we show that specific connections are established in an organotypic culture system in which rat visual cortex slices are co-cultured with another slice of the visual cortex or with a thalamic slice. The laminar origin and cellular morphology in vitro of cortical projections to other cortical regions or to subcortical targets are remarkably similar to those seen in vivo. In addition, axons of projecting cells are not restricted to particular pathways, but appear instead to grow directly towards their appropriate target. These observations raise the possibility that chemotropic attraction from the target areas may play an important part in the development of the cortical projection pattern.\r"

  ".U": "90326187\r", 
  ".W": "The gene responsible for cystic fibrosis (CF) has recently been identified and is predicted to encode a protein of 1,480 amino acids called the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Several functional regions are thought to exist in the CFTR protein, including two areas for ATP-binding, termed nucleotide-binding folds (NBFs), a regulatory (R) region that has many possible sites for phosphorylation by protein kinases A and C, and two hydrophobic regions that probably interact with cell membranes. The most common CF gene mutation leads to omission of phenylalanine residue 508 in the putative first NBF, indicating that this region is functionally important. To determine whether other mutations occur in the NBFs of CFTR, we determined the nucleotide sequences of exons 9, 10, 11 and 12 (encoding the first NBF) and exons 20, 21 and 22 (encoding most of the second NBF) from 20 Caucasian and 18 American-black CF patients. One cluster of four mutations was discovered in a 30-base-pair region of exon 11. Three of these mutations cause amino-acid substitutions at residues that are highly conserved among the CFTR protein, the multiple-drug-resistance proteins and ATP-binding membrane-associated transport proteins. The fourth mutation creates a premature termination signal. These mutations reveal a functionally important region in the CFTR protein and provide further evidence that CFTR is a member of the family of ATP-dependent transport proteins.\r"

In its progressive form, the disease destroys kidney function leading to uraemia and death, unless dialysis therapy or kidney transplantation is available. The pathogenesis of glomerulonephritis is incompletely understood, but the eliciting factor is thought often to be an immunological injury to mesangial and/or other resident cells in the glomeruli. We have used an animal model of acute mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis to show that this disease is associated with increased production and activity of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), an inducer of extracellular matrix production. Here we report that administration of anti-TGF-beta 1 at the time of induction of the glomerular disease suppresses the increased production of extracellular matrix and dramatically attenuates histological manifestations of the disease. These results provide direct evidence for a causal role of TGF-beta 1 in the pathogenesis of the experimental disease and suggest a new approach to the therapy of glomerulonephritis.\r"

In endoplasmic reticulum vesicle preparations from rat exocrine pancreas, an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate(InsP3)-sensitive, as well as an InsP3-insensitive, Ca2+ pool has been characterized. But Ca2+ channels in the endoplasmic reticulum of rat exocrine pancreas have not been demonstrated at the level of single-channel current. We have now used the patch-clamp technique on endoplasmic reticulum vesicles fused by means of the dehydration-rehydration method. In excised patches, single Ba2(+)- and Ca2(+)-selective channels were recorded. The channel activity was markedly voltage-dependent. Caffeine increased channel open-state probability, whereas ruthenium red and Cd2+ blocked single-channel currents. Ryanodine, nifedipine and heparin had no effect on channel activity. The channel activity was not dependent on the free Ca2+ concentration, the presence of InsP3, or pH. We conclude that this calcium channel mediates Ca2+ release from an intracellular store through an InsP3-insensitive mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "Apolipoprotein B (apo B) is crucial for the transport of cholesterol in humans. It is a large secretory protein that mediates the uptake of low-density lipoproteins and renders several forms of lipid droplets soluble in the blood. The binding of lipid by apo B also prevents this hydrophobic protein from precipitating in aqueous solution. In the endoplasmic reticulum, nascent secretory proteins must be translocated through an aqueous channel in the membrane into the aqueous lumen, so some novel form of processing may be necessary to maintain the solubility of apo B during its translocation. We have discovered that the biogenesis of apo B in cell-free systems does indeed involve a new variation on protein translocation: unlike typical secretory proteins, apo B is synthesized as a series of transmembrane chains with large cytoplasmic domains and progressively longer amino-terminal regions that are protected against added proteases during the translocation process. In contrast to typical transmembrane proteins, these transmembrane chains are not integrated into the bilayer. Moreover, the transmembrane chains with the shortest protected domains are precursors of forms whose protection is progressively extended to cover the length of the protein. This stepwise conversion occurs post-translationally for the most part. We propose a model on the basis of these findings for the biogenesis of apo B.\r"

  ".W": "Disease-resistance genes introduced into cultivated plants are often rendered ineffective by the ability of pathogen populations to overcome host resistance. The bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pathovar vesicatoria causes bacterial spot disease of tomato and pepper, and this pathogen has been shown to overcome disease resistance in pepper (Capsicum annuum) by evading the recognition and defence response of the host plant. Numerous resistance genes to bacterial spot have been identified in pepper and its wild relatives, each providing resistance to specific races of X.c. vesicatoria. The resistance gene Bs1, for example, provides resistance to X.c. vesicatoria strains expressing the avirulence gene avrBs1; Bs2 provides resistance to stains expressing avrBs2 and so on. We now report that avr Bs2 is highly conserved among strains of X.c. vesicatoria, and among many other pathovars of X. campestris. Furthermore, we find that avrBs2 is in fact needed for full virulence of the pathogen on susceptible hosts. This implies that plants carrying Bs2 can recognize an essential gene of the bacterial pathogen, which may explain why Bs2 confers the only effective field resistance to X.c. vesicatoria in pepper.\r"

Stable interactions with the common TATA element lead both to template commitment and to the assembly of the other general factors into a functional preinitiation complex. Consistent with its key role in the promoter activation pathway, human TFIID also seems to be a target for some regulatory factors, as evidenced both by physical and functional studies of interactions between these components. The evolutionary conservation of functional properties led to the purification and cloning of yeast TFIID, the identification of presumptive structural motifs, and direct structure-function studies. Here we report the cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a functional human TFIID. This reveals an evolutionarily conserved core which corresponds precisely to the 180-residue DNA binding/activation domain determined for yeast TFIID, a near absolute conservation of component structural motifs (direct repeats, central basic core/lysine repeat, and sigma homology), providing further support for their functional importance, and a unique N-terminal structure that suggests involvement in species-specific regulatory factor interactions.\r"

Nine members were variously affected. The condition was bilateral, had a dominant inheritance and started in middle age with a slow-developing macular lesion. Visual functions were often minimally disturbed for 2 or 3 decades. The flavimaculatus flecks which differed in number appeared only as secondary phenomena yet increased in number and size. At the onset of the disease, the ERG and EOG as well as colour vision were normal and became altered only in the course of a very slow process.\r"

In collagen gels, RPE cells sent out processes which were able to retract the gels. In a glycerinated model of contraction, RPE cells contracted and aggregated into clusters in response to the addition of ATP to the media. This contraction was very likely mediated by contractile proteins which are arranged in circumferential microfilament bundles in RPE cells. SDS-PAGE analysis of the RPE cell cytoskeletal elements showed protein bands of 200 kD and 43 kD, probably heavy-chain myosin and actin, respectively; in human RPE, cells bands of 58 kD and 52 kd, representing intermediate filament subunits, were evident; in bovine cells the 58-kD band was observed.\r"

Sixteen eyes had worn rigid contact lenses (13 eyes, polymethylmethacrylate; three eyes, gas-permeable), and five eyes had worn soft contact lenses. Initial corneal topographic patterns were characterized by the presence of central irregular astigmatism, loss of radial symmetry, and frequent reversal of the normal topographic pattern of progressive flattening of corneal contour from the center to the periphery. A correlation was noted between the initial corneal topography and the resting position of the contact lens on the cornea for nine of the 16 eyes with rigid contact lenses. Initial topography for each of these corneas showed relative flattening of the corneal contour underlying the resting position of a decentered contact lens. Superior-riding lenses produced a topography that simulated early keratoconus. After cessation of contact lens wear, 16 of 21 eyes had a change in corneal shape to a topography that was consistent with a normal pattern. Five corneas stabilized with an abnormal topographic pattern. A much longer time without contact lenses than had been previously reported, up to 5 months, was required for a return of a stable corneal topography in eyes with contact lens-induced corneal warpage caused by rigid lenses.\r"

The substantial depth of focus, large field of view, co-axial illumination, low light levels, real-time television operation, and videorecording with immediate recall provide advantages not available with conventional photographic methods. Video techniques give a resolution slightly inferior to photography, but this is unlikely to be significant in clinical practice. A technique of traversing the entire anterior episcleral vasculature has been developed to give a comprehensive and reproducible angiographic record. Previous fluorescein studies suggesting the primary importance of retrograde (centrifugal) flow in the perforating anterior ciliary arteries were not supported; methodologic explanations are advanced. Several principles are proposed to improve techniques of anterior segment angiography.\r"

Among all patients and among patients with only one type of cataract, cortical opacities occurred most frequently and posterior subcapsular opacities least frequently. In patients with bilateral cataracts there was a high degree of concordance of cataract type and severity. The high degree of concordance of cataract type between eyes and the decreasing prevalence of unilateral cataract with increasing age suggest that patients with unilateral cataract are at high risk of developing the same opacity in the fellow eye. Cortical cataracts were found more frequently in women, and in patients with unilateral cataract, the left eye was more frequently affected. Clinic-based data on the distribution of cataract may be of assistance in planning future clinical studies of cataract.\r"

All patients underwent the same operation--a penetrating keratoplasty combined with insertion of an open-loop AC IOL. Pseudophakic patients had an IOL exchange at the time of surgery. Thirty-six patients have been followed an average of 15 months. Thirty-two (89%) of the grafts are clear. Preoperatively, 100% of eyes had visual acuity less than 20/200. Postoperatively, 11 eyes (31%) have visual acuity better than 20/40 and 23 eyes (64%) have visual acuity better than 20/100. The most common causes for visual acuity less than 20/200 were cystoid macular edema, glaucoma, and immunologic graft failure. Using open-loop AC IOLs in patients with pseudophakic or aphakic bullous keratopathy can give good postoperative results and functional vision.\r"

Adjustments were made for known prognostic factors including age, tumor location, tumor height, and clinical estimate of tumor diameter (for enucleated patients this was estimated in a regression equation relating histologic to clinical measurement). The overall rate ratio for all cause mortality was 1.2 (95% confidence interval, 0.9-1.6) for the concurrent enucleation series versus proton beam, and 1.6 (95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.1) for the earlier enucleation series versus proton beam. Relative rates of metastatic death, cancer death, and all cause mortality comparing alternative treatments were found to vary with time after treatment. Interval-specific rate ratios were evaluated using proportional hazards models fitted to separate time intervals after treatment. For all three outcomes, rate ratios were over two and statistically significant for the first 2 years after treatment and closer to one and nonsignificant after year 6 comparing the two enucleation groups with proton beam. Results suggest that treatment choice has little overall influence on survival in patients with uveal melanoma.\r"

Recurrences were seen in 23% of eyes; all resolved spontaneously or with a single reoperation. Final visual acuity was improved by two or more lines in 13 eyes (56%), stable in 8 (35%), and worse in 2 (9%). The efficacy of this surgical technique supports the hypothesis that an abnormality of transscleral protein transport plays a primary pathophysiologic role in this disorder.\r"

  ".W": "The anatomic and visual results of vitreous surgery in 140 eyes of 108 children with stage 4 and 5 retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) were reviewed. Macular attachment was achieved in 9 (64%) of 14 eyes with stage 4. In stage 5 eyes, partial posterior attachment was obtained in 38 (31%) of 121 eyes and complete posterior attachment was obtained in 11 eyes (9%). Final visual acuity of fix and follow or greater occurred in 6 (43%) of 14 eyes with stage 4 and in 13 eyes (11%) with stage 5 ROP. Retinal detachment (RD) funnel configurations were classified according to the International Committee on ROP. The funnel type which was wide anteriorly and wide posteriorly had the best anatomic (63%) and visual (19%) success. Reoperation rarely improved visual acuity (4%), although reattachment was possible in 6 (22%) of 27 eyes. All children in this series underwent surgery by 2 years of age. Anatomic and visual success was achieved less often in children who underwent surgery at age 6 months or younger.\r"

  ".W": "To produce a test of visual acuity for young children that is more sensitive to amblyopia than current preschool vision tests, the authors surrounded four Allen pictures with \"crowding\" bars. This modified Allen test was evaluated by measuring acuity of amblyopic children (n = 28) and children (n = 10) and adults (n = 5) with normal eyes. Mean acuities of amblyopic eyes for the modified pictures was 0.8 octaves or nearly three logMar Snellen lines poorer than for the isolated pictures. For nonamblyopic and normal eyes modified picture acuity averaged 0.1 to 0.4 octaves poorer than isolated picture acuity. Average acuities of amblyopic eyes (n = 22) for the modified pictures agreed with line letter acuities. These results suggest that the modified picture test induces contour interaction similar to that of line letter tests, and thus, is a more sensitive test of amblyopia in the preschool child than isolated symbols.\r"

The muscular forces of 60 subjects were measured in standard manual muscle testing positions with a hand-held dynamometer. Scapular abduction in standing was measured with a tape measure. Each measurement was taken twice, and the measurements were shown to be reliable. The correlation between scapular abduction and middle trapezius muscle force was .20. The correlation between scapular abduction and pectoralis minor muscle force was .14. The correlation between scapular abduction and a ratio of middle trapezius muscle force to pectoralis minor muscle force was .01. The results indicate that no relationship exists between the position of the scapula in standing subjects and the muscular force produced by the middle trapezius and pectoralis minor muscles. Clinical practices based on an assumed relationship between these variables (eg, the practice of using middle trapezius muscle strengthening exercises to correct a forward shoulder position) should be reexamined in light of these findings.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between direction of lateral lumbar shift (LLS) and 1) the occurrence of symptoms during the side-bending movement test and 2) the location of symptoms in patients with low back pain syndrome (LBS). Twenty-four patients with LBS (17 male, 7 female) with an observable LLS were studied. Side-bending movement tests were performed bilaterally, and the results were recorded as positive if symptoms occurred during the movement. The location of symptoms (right side or left side) was obtained from the patient history. Use of the chi-square statistic revealed a statistically significant relationship between the direction of the LLS and the direction of the positive side-bending movement test. Seventeen tests (71%) were positive to the contralateral side of the LLS, and 5 (21%) were positive to the ipsilateral side. Two tests (8%) were negative in both directions. There was no significant relationship between the side of symptoms and the direction of the LLS. The determination of presence and direction of an LLS is necessary in certain physical therapy management approaches. Pain or restricted side-bending movement has been used to confirm the presence of an LLS. This study confirms the clinical usefulness of the side-bending movement test for determining the presence and direction of an LLS.\r"

Self-selected walking velocities (S-SWVs) and stride length for each crutch type were determined for a two-point, non-weight-bearing, swing-through gait in 24 healthy volunteers. Relative exercise intensity, oxygen uptake (VO2), and gait efficiency were assessed for each crutch type at both S-SWVs. Subjects negotiated two architectural barriers (stairs and ramp) and completed a subjective questionnaire concerning crutch preferences. Walking with either crutch type resulted in slower S-SWVs, greater VO2, higher relative exercise intensity, and reduced gait efficiency compared with values for normal unassisted ambulation. An analysis of variance for these variables revealed nonsignificant between-crutch differences. Based on the subjective data, a preference for the standard single-tip crutch was evident. Within the scope of the study, the results supported no apparent advantage relative to energy expenditure to using the rocker-bottom crutch.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined three factors related to exercise with an Exercycle, a motordriven upper and lower body exercise machine. We examined the effects of Exercycle training on peak oxygen consumption (VO2), peak heart rate, peak minute ventilation, and peak respiratory exchange ratio. We compared the physiologic responses to graded exercise between the Exercycle and a standard lower extremity (LE) cycle ergometer. We also compared the difference in training responses between male and female subjects. A 6-week cardiorespiratory training program was completed by 20 healthy untrained adults (9 male, 11 female), aged 18 to 53 years. Pretraining and posttraining testing was completed on the Exercycle and on an LE cycle ergometer using a graded protocol. Absolute peak VO2 improved by 14% for men and by 7% for women after training based on Exercycle testing and by 6% for both men and women based on LE cycle ergometer testing. The posttraining submaximal heart rates were lower at any given absolute peak VO2 level for the Exercycle but not for the LE cycle ergometer. Exercycle testing revealed a larger peak VO2 than did LE cycle ergometer testing for both genders. The Exercycle appears to be effective for promoting cardiorespiratory fitness in healthy, untrained adults. The authors found comparable submaximal physiologic responses to graded exercise between the Exercycle and the LE cycle ergometer.\r"

  ".W": "Isokinetic trunk ergometers are relatively new devices. Because the stresses on the cardiovascular system when using these types of devices were unknown, the purpose of this study was to document the heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) responses during a typical exercise session. Twelve subjects participated in three sessions of trunk flexion and extension exercises conducted on separate days. Exercises at one speed (ie, 60 degrees, 90 degrees, or 120 degrees/sec) were performed at each session. During each session, five 30-second exercise periods were separated by 60-second rest intervals. There were no differences in the HR and BP responses between exercise sessions at the three speeds. There was a progressive increase in HR to a value approximating 77% of predicted maximal HR by the end of the exercise sessions. Systolic blood pressure did not change from rest to exercise; diastolic blood pressure decreased initially and remained stable at the lower value throughout the exercise sessions. Several subjects reported light-headedness and dizziness during rest intervals. Because of the symptoms reported, we recommend that therapists monitor BP and observe patients for signs and symptoms of exercise intolerance when performing this type of exercise.\r"

We examined the within-rater and between-rater reliability of the assessment using a clinically feasible method, the video-goniometric measurement method, to analyze the task. Two variables were measured to characterize the sit-to-stand movement: 1) joint angles for four body segments (head, trunk, knee, and ankle) and 2) three events (maximal trunk flexion, lift-off, and maximal trunk extension). High reproducibility was found for all joint angles, except for the head angle. Both within-rater and between-rater goniometric measurements were highly reliable (ICC greater than .80). Identification of the events was reproducible within raters and between different raters. We conclude that this method can lead to reliable assessments of a healthy population. The reliability data established in this study can be used to help clinicians determine the impairments of patients.\r"
