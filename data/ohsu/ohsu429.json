  ".W": "Heme oxygenase, the rate-limiting enzyme for heme degradation, can be inhibited by several new synthetic metalloporphyrins. Under certain conditions, a depression in heme oxygenase activity has important clinical significance in the treatment of hyperbilirubinemia, and, in this regard, tin-protoporphyrin has been shown to decrease the production of bilirubin in vitro as well as in vivo. Similarly, our study was concerned with finding a new metalloporphyrin which will inhibit heme oxygenase. Many of the synthetic heme analogs that we analyzed were quite effective inhibitors of heme oxygenase, but the most powerful inhibitor was found to be zinc-deuteroporphyrin IX, 2,4-bisglycol. This metalloporphyrin almost completely inhibits liver heme oxygenase at concentrations as low as 0.5 microM. Its potency as an inhibitor was found to be greater than that of tin-protoporphyrin; the Ki of zinc-deuteroporphyrin IX, 2,4-bisglycol was calculated to be 0.003 microM. In conclusion, we demonstrated that zinc-deuteroporphyrin IX, 2,4-bisglycol has potent inhibitory effects on human liver, kidney and brain heme oxygenase so that this metalloporphyrin can be considered as an alternative to tin-protoporphyrin in the treatment of hyperbilirubinemia.\r"

  ".W": "Spontaneously hypertensive mice have been characterized as more sensitive to environmental heat than normotensive mice. A breeding program was therefore initiated to examine the possible genetic link between thermosensitivity and hypertension. Crossbreeding of spontaneously hypertensive mice with randomly bred normotensive mice produced F1 hybrids, which were then intercrossed to create a F2 population. Thermosensitivity was measured with a noninvasive method. The rate of body temperature increase was significantly (p less than 0.001) higher in the hypertensive mice (1.74 +/- 0.04 degrees C/min) compared with normal controls (1.13 +/- 0.03 degrees C/min). The frequency distribution of the rate of body temperature increase among the progenies was consistent with the hypothesis that a single gene locus determines the observed difference in thermosensitivity between normal and hypertensive mice. The allele that determines the rate of body temperature increase in normal mice was dominant in relation to the allele contributed by hypertensive mice. In the F2 population, a bimodal distribution determined two phenotypes: less than 1.40 degrees C/min and greater than 1.40 degrees C/min. A significant difference (p less than 0.01) in blood pressure of 11 mm Hg was observed between these two phenotypes. In addition, a positive correlation (p less than 0.01) was noted between the rate of body temperature increase and blood pressure in the F2 progeny. We conclude that there is possibly a single locus controlling thermosensitivity, which exhibits additive-dominance inheritance. Alleles of this particular trait segregate in part with an increment in blood pressure. The results support the possibility that the increased thermosensitivity seen in hypertensive mice is associated with one of the genes that contributes to their high blood pressure.\r"

Under baseline conditions in the normotensive and hypertensive groups at mean aortic pressures of 96.3 and 128.6 mm Hg, aortic compliance averaged 1.47 and 0.80 ml/mm Hg, respectively. Compliance in the hypertensive group at a diastolic pressure of 99.4 mm Hg (which was nearly equal to the mean normotensive pressure) was 1.072 ml/mm Hg--still significantly lower than in the normotensive group. During nitroprusside infusion, however, the compliances in the hypertensive group increased to levels equal to or greater those in the normotensive group. Thus, these data confirm that aortic compliance is lower in hypertensive than in normotensive humans. They further demonstrate that the lower compliance cannot be attributed entirely to the elevated blood pressure, suggesting that excess smooth muscle tone may be partly responsible.\r"

Perfusion of intact arteries with a solution of papain and collagenase produced dense populations of viable cells (more than 10(4) cells/ml) that remained relaxed in the presence of physiological levels of calcium. Contractile responses of smooth muscle cells from the SHR were significantly more sensitive to noradrenaline, potassium depolarization, and the calcium channel agonist Bay K 8644 compared with those from WKY rats. Enhanced sensitivity to calcium in the SHR was also observed on readdition of calcium to cells preincubated in noradrenaline or KCl in a calcium-free medium.

Ca2+ activity was quantitated at each point within vascular muscle cells loaded with fura-2 at fluorescence excitation wavelengths of 340, 360, and 380 nm, and fluorescence emission at 510 nm (all filters were +/- 5 nm) quantitated by a digital photon-counting camera. Measurements of fluorescence intensity ratio in central and subsarcolemmal areas showed that calcium release, in response to 30 or 100 mM K+ with Ca2+ agonist or during spontaneous contractions, was principally from sarcoplasmic reticulum. Addition of the Ca2+ agonist Sdz 202-791, S (+) stereoisomer (SdzS), caused a dose-dependent increase of Ca2+ in both SHR and WKY rats. Intracellular calcium release sites were defined by \"hot spots\" of high fluorescence intensity ratio in both central and peripheral regions of the sarcoplasm. The size and intensity of hot spots increased, and there was an initial transient activation of subsarcolemmal calcium pools in response to high K+ with 1 microM Ca2+ agonist. In contrast, treatment of the cells with the R (-) stereoisomer of Sdz 202-791 (SdzR), a Ca2+ antagonist, prevented the increase in Ca2+ and the increase in hot spot size by either K+ alone or with agonist. Antagonist decreased central core Ca2+ release and fragmented the subsarcolemmal hot spots.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The present work, performed as an ancillary study to an epidemiological survey on an entire population, aimed to investigate the existence of a similar abnormality in human hypertension. Calcium binding to the erythrocyte membrane was measured in clinically healthy normotensive (n = 12) and hypertensive individuals (n = 24). For this purpose, a filtration technique was used, based on the determination of 45Ca bound to the erythrocyte membrane in the presence of free calcium concentrations (40 nmol/l and 1 mumol/l), which are similar to those of the intracellular environment. The intra-assay technical error was determined on 35 duplicate samples and, when expressed as percent of the mean, was 24.1 at the 40 nmol/l concentration and 16.8 at the 1 mumol/l concentration. Membranes of untreated hypertensive patients, at both calcium concentrations, bound significantly less calcium than the control group. Treated and untreated hypertensive individuals had comparable values of membrane calcium binding capacity. Membranes of the treated hypertensive group bound less calcium than those of the normotensive group at both calcium concentrations, but the difference was statistically significant only in the presence of 40 nmol/l free calcium. A significant positive correlation was observed between the calcium binding capacity at 40 nmol/l concentration and that at 1 mumol/l in the treated and untreated hypertensive groups (r = 0.73 and 0.75, respectively; 0.51 for the normotensive group). These findings support the hypothesis that a cell membrane abnormality is detectable in some hypertensive patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirty-four healthy men ages 21-35 years were selected such that 17 were at high risk for hypertension (positive parental history and screening blood pressures of 135/85-155/95 mm Hg) and 17 were at low risk (negative parental history and no pressures above 132/84 mm Hg). Testing consisted of quiet rest (20 minutes); oral placebo (grapefruit juice) or caffeine administration (3.3 mg/kg in grapefruit juice); rest during a postdrug absorption period (40 minutes); work on an unsignalled simple reaction time task (15 minutes); and quiet rest (20 minutes). Blood pressures were recorded at 2-minute intervals, and blood samples were withdrawn via an indwelling catheter at the end of the baseline, drug absorption, task, and recovery periods. The combination of task plus caffeine produced the highest blood pressures in men at risk for hypertension. Cortisol levels were found to be sustained during rest in members of the high risk group after they had consumed caffeine, whereas members of the low risk group showed a modest decline. The high risk subjects also showed a significant rise in cortisol during (+3.7 micrograms/dl) and after (+4.0 micrograms/dl) work on the reaction time task after caffeine consumption.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It is not known if this reflects greater sympathetic neural outflow. We directly recorded muscle sympathetic nerve activity (microneurography) in 15 normotensive and 12 borderline hypertensive age-matched men to determine whether borderline hypertensive individuals have elevated sympathetic nerve activity. Supine heart rate, blood pressure, plasma norepinephrine, and efferent muscle sympathetic nerve activity (peroneal nerve) were measured after 6 days of both low and high dietary sodium intake (10 and 400 meq sodium/24 hr). Sympathetic nerve activity was elevated significantly in borderline hypertensive individuals on both low (37 +/- 1 in borderline hypertensive individuals vs. 29 +/- 1 bursts/min in normotensive individuals; p less than 0.01) and high (25 + 1 in borderline hypertensive individuals vs. 16 +/- 1 bursts/min in normotensive individuals; p less than 0.01) sodium diets. The borderline hypertensive group had higher systolic (p less than 0.01) and diastolic (p less than 0.05) blood pressures independent of sodium intake. Across both groups, high sodium intake reduced muscle sympathetic nerve activity (p less than 0.001), plasma norepinephrine (p less than 0.001), diastolic blood pressure (p less than 0.02), heart rate (p less than 0.002), and increased weight (p less than 0.005). A significant (p less than 0.05) group-by-diet interaction was observed for plasma norepinephrine levels. Specifically, compared with the normotensive group, plasma norepinephrine levels in the borderline hypertensive group tended to be higher on low sodium diet (p = 0.08) and lower on high sodium diet (p = 0.23).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies demonstrate that bilateral renal denervation enhances urinary sodium excretion and delays the onset of hypertension in young (7-week-old) spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) maintained on ordinary laboratory chow. We interpret these data as suggesting that increased renal nerve activity in this model contributes to hypertension by causing excess sodium retention. More recent studies show that dietary NaCl supplementation increases blood pressure and peripheral sympathetic nervous system activity in NaCl-sensitive SHR (SHR-S). The present study tests the hypothesis that the renal nerves contribute to the rise in arterial pressure caused by dietary NaCl supplementation in this model. SHR-S were fed a high (8%) or basal (1%) NaCl diet beginning at age 7 weeks. Bilateral renal denervation was carried out 2 weeks after the initiation of the diets, at which time systolic blood pressure was significantly higher in the high (compared with the basal) NaCl group. Systolic blood pressure was reduced slightly less in denervated SHR-S on the high (compared with basal) NaCl diet during the following 5 weeks. Renal denervation performed 1 week before initiation of the diets attenuated the subsequent development of hypertension equally in both groups. Both renal denervation and the high NaCl diet increased alpha 2-adrenergic receptor numbers in the kidney; renal denervation caused an approximately equal increase in alpha 2-adrenergic receptor binding in SHR-S on high and basal NaCl diets. The high NaCl diet increased plasma noradrenaline concentration, and renal denervation lowered mean arterial pressure but did not decrease circulating catecholamines in either diet group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We compared blood pressure, hindquarter vascular resistance properties, left ventricular weight, and norepinephrine kinetics, in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and weight-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats at 4, 9, 14, 20, 30, and 50 weeks of age. At 4 weeks, systolic and mean blood pressure measurements were the same in both strains, but the vascular resistance of the fully dilated hindquarter bed was significantly higher in SHR than in WKY rats, with a much larger difference during maximum constriction. Plots of resistance at maximum dilatation and at maximum constriction against body weight suggest that a component of the increase in vascular muscle mass in SHR occurred in the neonatal period preceding hypertension followed by a later component related to the rise in blood pressure. By contrast, left ventricular hypertrophy was minimal at 4 weeks and most of its development paralleled the rise in blood pressure. Sympathetic activity, assessed by norepinephrine fractional rate constant, was higher in SHR than in WKY rats in the left ventricle and kidney through most of the period between 4 and 50 weeks, but was similar in both strains in the muscle bed. This pattern of sympathetic activity will accentuate hypertension once cardiac and vascular hypertrophy are fully established. In all regions, norepinephrine tissue concentration was higher in young SHR and could potentiate the trophic effects of growth factors in early vascular hypertrophy. We suggest that the initial (primary) component of vascular hypertrophy precedes the rise in blood pressure and may be critical in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Possible reasons for the short delay in the rise in blood pressure in young SHR, once the vascular \"amplifier\" has been established, include high vascularity, immaturity of smooth muscle, and delay in the development of left ventricular hypertrophy.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of one-kidney, one clip Goldblatt hypertension on aortic atherosclerosis have been studied in the Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbit. Renovascular surgery was performed on WHHL rabbits at 3 months of age, and the rabbits were followed for periods of 3-6 months. Aortic atherosclerosis was assessed by measurement of intimal surface involvement with atherosclerotic lesions, determination of aortic free and ester cholesterol content, and microscopic examination. Systolic blood pressure increased by approximately 40-60 mm Hg in the renovascular surgical group as compared with the sham-operated group, but body weight, heart rate, serum cholesterol, and serum triglyceride were unaffected. Aortic atherosclerosis was increased in the hypertensive rabbits, even after 2-3 months of hypertension. At 3 months after renovascular surgery, the aortic surface area covered by atherosclerotic disease averaged 77 +/- 4.4% in hypertensive as compared with 16 +/- 3.3 in control rabbits. At 6 months after surgery, the values were 62 +/- 8.2% and 30 +/- 5.3% in the hypertensive and control rabbits, respectively. The differences in surface involvement and cholesterol content as a result of hypertension were particularly prominent in the descending thoracic aorta. Atherosclerotic lesions in the descending thoracic and abdominal aortic regions of normotensive WHHL rabbits were localized primarily to the ostia of branch vessels, but in the hypertensive rabbits, the involvement was typically very diffuse. No major differences in the nature of atherosclerotic lesions of comparable size were apparent by light microscopy. The results indicate that hypertension accelerates atherogenesis in the WHHL rabbit and suggest that this model may be valuable for studying the mechanisms by which such acceleration is induced.\r"

Levels were compared in normotensive and untreated and treated hypertensive individuals by glucose tolerance category and smoking, after adjustment for sex, age, and body mass index. In the presence of normal glucose tolerance, lipid levels in the nonsmoking normotensive and treated hypertensive groups were similar, whereas in the smoking, treated hypertensive group, lipids were significantly affected, as indicated by the respective adjusted mean levels (mg/dl): total cholesterol, 219, 221, and 240; high density lipoprotein cholesterol, 45.0, 43.6, and 42.0; ratio, 5.2, 5.3, and 6.0; and triglycerides, 114, 107, and 144. In individuals with glucose intolerance, trends were the same with the exception of triglycerides, which were significantly elevated in the nonsmoking, treated hypertensive group also; the respective values were 217, 225, and 257 for total cholesterol; 45.1, 44.9, and 41.4 for high density lipoprotein cholesterol; 5.2, 5.5, and 6.8 for the ratio; and 133, 152, and 187 for triglycerides. Lipid disturbances in treated smokers were not due to heavier smoking or differences in dietary intake. We conclude that disturbance of plasma lipid profile in treated hypertensive individuals may be mainly due to an interaction with smoking, with an additional effect of glucose intolerance.\r"

Data used were from the baseline examination of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in (Young) Adults Study (CARDIA). CARDIA is a longitudinal study of lifestyle and evolution of cardiovascular disease risk factors in 5,116 young adults, black and white, men and women, aged 18-30 years, of varying socioeconomic status. Young black adults had higher mean systolic blood pressure and slightly higher mean diastolic blood pressure than young white adults. For both men and women, the blood pressure differences between blacks and whites tended to be greater for the age group 25-30 than for the age group 18-24 years. Among the variables studied, body mass index, duration of exercise on the treadmill, number of cigarettes smoked per day, and number of alcoholic drinks per week were consistently associated with blood pressure. The blood pressure differences were greatly reduced after adjusting for these variables. Black participants had lower mean pulse rate than white participants. The differences tended to be greater for the age group 18-24 than for the age group 25-30 years. Among the variables studied, only duration on treadmill and number of cigarettes smoked per day were consistently correlated with pulse rate. With adjustment for duration on treadmill, the differences in pulse rate increased. These results suggest that differences in ethnic pattern of blood pressures and pulse rate with age may be due in part to obesity, physical fitness, alcohol consumption, and cigarette smoking.\r"

Multivariate analysis of variance indicated that there was a significant reduction in headache frequency, duration and peak intensity following treatment for both treated groups. These reductions were maintained at six months follow-up. Treatment for the minimal-contact group was significantly more cost-effective than for the clinic group.\r"

Wait list subjects ultimately received treatment identical to that offered to subjects in the group treatment condition. Treatment outcome measures included the Brief Symptom Inventory, the McGill Pain Questionnaire, and several measures calculated from self-monitoring data. Tentative support was found for the hypothesis that CBT as provided in this study is effective in the treatment of chronic headache. There was no evidence that group versus individually treated subjects differed significantly on any of the measures used, although the small N and large variance among subjects limit us to preliminary conclusions for our findings.

As many menstrual migraine headaches are refractory to abortive therapy, prophylactic therapy is often needed. Ergonovine maleate, an ergot derivative with vasoconstrictive properties, has been used with some success in migraine headache patients. Forty patients who were treated with intermittent prophylactic ergonovine were studied over six months. The patients ranged in age from 22 to 40 years, and all suffered with menstrual migraine headaches which were refractory to abortive therapy. Each patient took ergonovine maleate 0.2 mg three to four times daily during menses and recorded headache occurrence and severity. After three months, 24 patients (60%) reported significantly less severe attacks, six patients (15%) reported less frequent headaches and 14 patients (35%) reported no improvement. After six months there was a decrease in effectiveness with 20 patients (50%) reporting significantly less severe headaches and two patients (5%) reporting less frequent headaches. This limited study suggests that ergonovine maleate may be of value in the treatment of difficult menstrual migraine patients.\r"

Flunarizine was added to his phenytoin therapy; it controlled both paroxysmal disorders. After six months, flunarizine was discontinued and during a one year follow-up the patient remained symptom-free. This calcium channel blocker can be regarded as an ideal drug in patients suffering from both cluster headache and epilepsy; it controls this headache syndrome and is a useful add-on to standard anti-convulsant therapy.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether and how the strength of coupling between respiratory and stepping rhythms varies depending on locomotor patterns, correlation analysis was done of diaphragmatic and gastrocnemius muscle activities. In spontaneously breathing cats decerebrated at the precollicular-post-mammillary level, tonic electrical stimulation was delivered to the mesencephalic locomotor region to induce locomotion on a treadmill. Electromyograms were recorded from the left hemidiaphragm and the bilateral gastrocnemius muscles. Various locomotor patterns were elicited by changes in the belt speed of the treadmill and in the intensity of stimulation of the mesencephalic locomotor region. Cross-correlograms between diaphragmatic and gastrocnemius activities showed that coupling was absent or weak when the cats walked slowly. The strength of locomotor-respiratory coupling tended to increase as the mean stepping interval shortened. When the animals were galloping, the respiratory rhythm was entrained 1:1 with the stepping rhythm. This study showed that the strength of coupling between respiratory and stepping rhythms varied depending on the locomotor patterns elicited, especially on whether the animals were running.\r"

  ".W": "Eight healthy men cycled at a work load corresponding to approximately 70% of maximal O2 uptake (VO2max) to fatigue (exercise I). Exercise to fatigue at the same work load was repeated after 75 min of rest (exercise II). Exercise duration averaged 65 and 21 min for exercise I and II, respectively. Muscle (quadriceps femoris) content of glycogen decreased from 492 +/- 27 to 92 +/- 20 (SE) mmol/kg dry wt and from 148 +/- 17 to 56 +/- 17 (SE) mmol/kg dry wt during exercise I and II, respectively. Muscle and blood lactate were only moderately increased during exercise. The total adenine nucleotide pool (TAN = ATP + ADP + AMP) decreased and inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP) increased in the working muscle during both exercise I (P less than 0.001) and II (P less than 0.01). Muscle content of ammonia (NH3) increased four- and eight-fold during exercise I and II, respectively. The working legs released NH3, and plasma NH3 increased progressively during exercise. The release of NH3 at the end of exercise II was fivefold higher than that at the same time point in exercise I (P less than 0.001, exercise I vs. II). It is concluded that submaximal exercise to fatigue results in a breakdown of the TAN in the working muscle through deamination of AMP to IMP and NH3. The relatively low lactate levels demonstrate that acidosis is not a necessary prerequisite for activation of AMP deaminase. It is suggested that the higher average rate of AMP deamination during exercise II vs. exercise I is due to a relative impairment of ATP resynthesis caused by the low muscle glycogen level.\r"

By localizing osmotic stimuli to central nervous system tissues, this study assessed the role of central stimulation on sweating in a heat-stressed nonhuman primate. Lenperone-tranquilized patas monkeys (Erythrocebus patas n = 5), exposed to 41 +/- 2 degrees C, were monitored for calf sweat rate, rectal and mean skin temperatures, oxygen consumption, and heart rate during infusions (255-413 microliters) of hypertonic artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) into the third cerebral ventricle. ACSF made hypertonic with NaCl to yield osmolalities of 800 and 1,000 mosmol/kgH2O significantly decreased sweat rate compared with control ACSF (285 mosmol/kgH2O), achieving maximal reductions during infusion of 37 and 53%, respectively. Rectal temperature significantly increased during the recovery period, reaching elevations of 0.69 and 0.72 degrees C, respectively, at 20 min postinfusion. In contrast, ACSF made hypertonic with sucrose (800 mosmol/kgH2O) failed to change sweat rate or rectal temperature during infusion in three animals. Thus, intracerebroventricular infusions of hypertonic ACSF mimicked dehydration-induced effects on thermoregulation. The reduction in heat loss during infusion appeared to depend on an elevation in cerebrospinal fluid [Na+] and not osmolality per se.\r"

This study determined the potential role of two neuropeptides, angiotensin II (ANG II) and arginine vasopressin (AVP), in mediating this response. Artificial cerebrospinal fluid, containing either ANG II or AVP, was infused into the third cerebral ventricle of lenperone-tranquilized monkeys (n = 4) exposed to 41 +/- 2 degrees C. Solutions were infused at 16.5 microliters/min for 25 min (total vol approximately 413 microliters). ANG II (1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 ng/microliters) tended to decrease .msw. However, during infusion, only the decline at 10 min associated with the 1.25-ng/microliters dose (26%) was different (P less than 0.004) from control. This dose elevated (P less than 0.004) core rectal temperature by 1.14 degrees C at 20 min postinfusion. In contrast, AVP (0.5 and 1.5 micrograms/microliters artificial cerebrospinal fluid) had no significant effect on .msw compared with control infusions. Both doses of AVP produced a slight but significant increase in rectal temperature of 0.14 and 0.22 degrees C, respectively, at 20 min postinfusion. In conclusion, the magnitude and time course of the change in .msw with central ANG II suggest that it does not act as the sole mediator of the decline in .msw observed with elevated cerebrospinal fluid [Na+]. The minimal effects produced by third ventricular AVP exclude this route as a means by which AVP could modulate .msw during dehydration.\r"

Concurrently, a factorial estimate of the energy expenditure of the platoon was conducted. Also, a food intake-energy balance study was conducted for the platoon. Mean daily energy expenditure by the doubly labeled water method was 4,750 kcal (range 4,152-5,394 kcal). The factorial estimate of mean daily energy expenditure was 4,535 kcal. Because of inherent inaccuracies in the food intake-energy balance technique, we were able to conclude only that energy expenditure, as measured by this method, was greater than the estimated mean daily intake of 4,040 kcal. The doubly labeled water technique was well tolerated, is noninvasive, and appears to be suitable in a wide range of field applications.\r"

  ".W": "Oscillatory flow in the lung is studied using an order-of-magnitude analysis and flow visualization experiments in a single bifurcation with lung-like geometry. The results are used to obtain a classification scheme that identifies three major flow regimes, distinguished on the basis of whether the flow is dominated by unsteadiness, viscous effects, or the effects of convective acceleration. The unsteady regime is found to exist for values of a dimensionless stroke length (L/a, i.e., stroke volume/local cross-sectional area) less than or equal to 3 and for values of a dimensionless frequency (alpha 2 = alpha 2 omega/nu, where alpha is airway radius, omega the oscillatory frequency, and nu the kinematic viscosity) less than or equal to 10 in basic agreement with previous studies. The viscous regime is found when alpha 2(L/a)(a/R)1/2 less than 10 and alpha 2 less than 10 where R is the local radius of curvature in the bifurcation; the convective regime is found when alpha 2(L/a)(a/R)1/2 greater than 10 and L/a greater than 3. This same approach yields scaling laws for the magnitude of secondary flow velocities and shows that the ratio of secondary-to-axial velocity is small everywhere outside of the convective regime where it scales with (a/R)1/2. Comparison of these results to related simple flows shows that many of the features observed can be attributed to the effects of curvature, suggesting that the influence of the flow divider and of area change may be of lesser importance than previously thought.\r"

Test-retest correlation coefficients for peak VO2 (r = 0.95, run 1 with run 2; r = 0.92, run 1 with run 3; r = 0.92, run 2 with run 3) were similar to previously reported values. Variance component distributions suggested that the underlying physiological mechanisms of response for peak VO2, TMILLTM, and HRmax were different from those of FREQ, Rmax, and LACDIF. Minimum detectable differences for peak VO2 (ml.kg-1.min-1, n = 5, minimum detectable within subject difference, 11.5%; minimum detectable among subject effects, 21.3%) indicated a need for careful attention to research design in future studies.\r"

Reference standards were obtained from the postmortem scale weight of the frozen lungs (Wscale) and compared with the CT lung weights measured in the living dog (WCT-38) and the frozen carcass (WCT-cold). WCT-cold did not significantly differ from Wscale [-2 +/- 9% (SD), P = 0.7]. WCT-cold was 10% greater than WCT-38 (0.10 greater than P greater than 0.05), suggesting an increase in lung weight despite immediately commencing freezing after death. WDME measured 64 +/- 6% and WC2H2 56 +/- 12% of WCT-38. Serial multiple measurements in three dogs over 14 wk showed a coefficient of variation (CV) of 10 +/- 2% for WDME, 18 +/- 2% for WC2H2, 4.1 +/- 0.9% for WCT, 2.6 +/- 0.8% for CT density, and 3.5 +/- 1.6% for functional residual capacity (FRC) by CT. FRC calculated from CT consistently underestimated FRC measured by rebreathing helium by 18 +/- 8% (P less than 0.005). This error, despite good agreement between WCT and Wscale, was explained by underestimation of CT total lung volume and overestimation of lung density by factors known to affect CT readings, such as partial volume effects, beam hardening, and limited number of input signals. These data show that CT scanning can provide serial measurement of the mass, density, and volume of the lungs with a CV in the order of 5%, but the rebreathing of soluble gases gives more than double this variability. Measurements of WDME performed on the same day had a CV of 3 +/- 1%, so that WDME provides a precise noninvasive means to measure lung weight in acute studies.\r"

Contraction was elicited at lower frequencies [half-maximal response to electrical stimulation (ES50) = 6.7 +/- 0.05 Hz] in 2ws than in 10ws (ES50 = 9.1 +/- 0.4 Hz; P less than 0.01). Despite substantial differences in morphometrically normalized cross-sectional area in 2ws (0.012 +/- 0.003 cm2) and 10ws (0.028 +/- 0.001 cm2; P less than 0.01), maximal active tension elicited by parasympathetic stimulation was similar (12.4 +/- 3.2 g/cm in 2ws vs. 13.3 +/- 2.3 g/cm in 10ws; P = NS). In separate in vitro studies in 25 tracheal smooth muscle strips from 10 swine, concentration-response curves generated with potassium-substituted Krebs solution (KCl) were similar in 2ws and 10ws. In 58 other strips (10 swine), maximal active force elicited with acetylcholine (ACh) in 2ws was significantly greater than for 10ws (P less than 0.001). Removal of the epithelium had no effect. However, cholinesterase inhibition with 10(-7) M physostigmine augmented the response to ACh in 10ws (P less than 0.02) but not 2ws. We demonstrate increased force generation and sensitivity to vagal stimulation in 2ws vs. 10ws, which corresponds to increased reactivity to ACh in vitro. The relative hyperresponsiveness in 2ws is specific for cholinergic response and is attenuated at least in part by maturation of the activity of acetylcholinesterase enzyme.\r"

All TSM strips were contracted to similar active tensions [target tension (TT) = 50% of the maximal active tension elicited by 127 mM KCl] with ACh, HIS, 5-HT, or KCl and relaxed with either ISO, forskolin (FSK), N6,2'-O-dibutyryladenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (db-cAMP), or 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IMX). The concentrations of ISO causing 50% relaxation from TT (RC50) were ACh (2.9 +/- 1.1 x 10(-6) M) greater than 5-HT (8.4 +/- 1.5 x 10(-8) M) approximately KCl (8.1 +/- 2.1 x 10(-8) M) greater than HIS (1.6 +/- 0.2 x 10(-8) M). FSK and IMX relaxed TSM in the same rank order of potency as ISO. In contrast to the contractile agonist-dependent relaxation elicited by ISO, FSK, and IMX, db-cAMP was nearly equipotent in relaxing similarly contracted strips. These results are consistent with contractile agonist-specific interaction with cAMP production by ISO and FSK. These data demonstrate that the phenomenon of contractile agonist-dependent relaxation by ISO is not related specifically to the beta-adrenoceptor.\r"

Studies were performed while the animals were hyperventilated to apnea and, in addition, when breathing was stimulated by inhalation of 7% CO2 or by N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) applied to the ventral surface of the medulla. When the cats were hyperventilated to apnea with O2, injection of capsaicin into the right atrium increased tracheal tone and slightly raised nasal resistance. However, when the animals were ventilated with 7% CO2 in O2 or respiratory activity was stimulated by the application of NMDA, administration of capsaicin eliminated spontaneous phrenic nerve activity and caused an abrupt decrease in tracheal tone but still increased nasal resistance. Similar responses were also obtained with right atrial injection of phenyldiguanide. These results showed for the first time that in the cat the direction of the reflex effects on tracheal tone but not nasal resistance depends on the preexisting level of respiratory drive and on cholinergic activity to airway smooth muscle.\r"

The frequency of stimulation was adjusted to produce 40% of maximal tetanic tension at supramaximal voltages. After 30 min of stimulation, analysis of twitch characteristics between control and experimental groups indicated a prolongation of contraction time of 9% (P less than 0.05), an increase in relaxation time of 75% (P less than 0.05), and a decrease in twitch tension by 78% (P less than 0.05). Similarly, reductions (P less than 0.05) in isometric force output at high stimulation frequency (100 Hz) of 58% and at low frequency (20 Hz) of 67% were also noted. These changes were accompanied by an approximately 60% reduction in the maximal velocity of shortening. No difference was observed for any of the mechanical measures between experimental conditions. After 30-min stimulation, decreases of between 43 and 46% were noted for ATP (P less than 0.05) and increases of between three- and fourfold noted for IMP (P less than 0.05). No changes were found for either ADP or AMP. Total adenine nucleotide concentrations declined (P less than 0.05) an average of 24%. As with the mechanical data, no differences were found between the different stimulation conditions. It is concluded that for the conditions studied, fatigue mechanisms become manifest early in the stimulation period and are only minimally altered by the duration of specific contractions provided the relaxation period is of equal duration.\r"

Five normal, healthy subjects (4 male, 1 female) underwent a 6-h primed, constant-rate infusion of L-[1-13C]leucine after 5 days of twice daily oral use of 80 mg propranolol and a placebo. Leucine turnover was determined by tracer dilution and leucine oxidation by 13C enrichment of the expired CO2. Propranolol decreased the total daily energy expenditure from 1,945 +/- 177.5 to 1,619 +/- 92.5 kcal/day (P less than 0.05). A fasting associated decrease in blood glucose and an attenuated rise in free fatty acids and ketones were observed during beta-blockade. Propranolol also increased plasma leucine concentrations (73.1 +/- 8.7 to 103.4 +/- 7.3 mumol/l; P less than 0.05) and leucine oxidation (13.2 +/- 1.2 to 17.1 +/- 1.3 mumol.kg-1.h-1; P less than 0.05), although leucine turnover was not significantly altered (100.5 +/- 7.3 vs. 126.0 +/- 12.3 mumol.kg-1.h-1). In addition, the urinary urea nitrogen-to-creatinine ratio was greater during propranolol administration (0.24 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.34 +/- 0.02 mol/g; P less than 0.05). These data suggest that the beta-adrenergic system plays a role in the modulation of whole-body leucine metabolism in humans. Whether these changes are the result of a direct effect on skeletal muscle or an indirect effect mediated by altering the fuel supply to skeletal muscle cannot be discriminated by the present study.\r"

  ".W": "Computed tomography scans of isolated dog lung lobes at different lobe volumes were used to determine the variability of parenchymal tissue density and the variability of parenchymal volume changes on the scale of a voxel, a cube 1.5 mm on a side. The variability of tissue density increased with decreasing lobe volume. The variability of tissue density of neighboring voxels was positively correlated; the spatial correlation decreased exponentially with distance with an exponential scale of 0.3 cm. The ratio of the volume of the parenchyma within a voxel to its volume at total lobe capacity was calculated from the tissue density data at two lobe volumes. At a lobe volume of 40% total lobe capacity, the local fractional volumes were 0.42 +/- 0.12. The variability of ventilation that corresponds to this variability of fractional volume is large enough to explain the inefficiency of mixing in the isolated lobe and the slope of the alveolar plateau of nitrogen concentration in the expirate after a breath of oxygen. These results are consistent with data reported earlier on the variability of parenchymal volumes at a scale of 1-10 cm3.\r"

  ".U": "89340257\r", 
  ".W": "The purpose of this study was twofold: one concerns carotid blood flow and tissue PO2 and the other the effect of chronic hypoxic hypoxia on enhanced catecholamine content. The rationale was that chronic CO inhalation would not mimic the effect of hypoxia on the carotid body if its tissue blood flow is sufficiently high to counteract the effect of CO on O2 delivery and, hence, on tissue PO2. The differential effects of CO on the carotid body and erythropoietin-producing tissue would also indicate that the effect of hypoxic hypoxia on the carotid body is the result of a direct action of a local low O2 stimulus rather than secondary to a systemic effect initiated by other O2-sensing tissues. To test these alternatives we studied the effects of chronic CO inhalation on carotid body catecholamine content and hematocrit in the rats, which were exposed to an inspired PCO of 0.4-0.5 Torr at an inspired PO2 of approximately 150 Torr for 22 days. The hematocrit of CO-exposed rats was 75 +/- 1.1% compared with 48 +/- 0.7% in controls. Dopamine and norepinephrine content of the carotid bodies (per pair) was 5.88 +/- 0.91 and 3.02 +/- 0.19 ng, respectively, in the CO-exposed rats compared with 6.20 +/- 1.0 and 3.29 +/- 0.6 ng, respectively, in the controls. Protein content of the carotid bodies (per pair) was 18.4 +/- 1.6 and 20.5 +/- 0.9 micrograms, respectively. Thus, despite a vigorous erythropoietic response, the CO-exposed rats failed to show any significant stimulation of carotid body in terms of the content of either catecholamine or protein. The results suggest that carotid body tissue PO2 is not compromised by moderate carboxyhemoglobinemia because of its high tissue blood flow and that the chronic effect of hypoxic hypoxia on carotid body is direct.\r"

Biceps CSA was obtained from computer tomographic scanning and corrected for noncontractile tissue. Biceps CSA was twofold greater in MB relative to FB and strongly correlated to lean body mass (R = 0.93). Biceps CSA expressed per kilogram lean body mass (LBM) or per centimeter body height (BH) was 35% greater in MB compared with FB. Most of the gender difference in muscle CSA was because of greater absolute mean fiber areas in MB (9,607 microns2) relative to FB (5,386 microns2); however, MB also had a significantly greater population of small type II fibers (less than 2,000 microns2) compared with FB. Type II fiber area/LBM averaged 1.6-fold greater in MB compared with FB; however, type I fiber area/LBM was similar between groups. Biceps CSA was positively correlated to fiber CSA (R = 0.75) and fiber number (R = 0.55). This suggests that adaptations to resistance training may be complex and involve fiber hypertrophy and fiber number (e.g., proliferation). Alternatively, since the muscle characteristics before training are not known, these apparent adaptations might be genetically determined attributes.\r"

During 1 night, subjects were allowed to sleep normally, whereas during the other night all sleep was prevented. The six asthmatic patients demonstrated progressive increases in lower airway resistance (Rla) on both nights, but the rate of increase was twofold greater (P less than 0.0001) during the sleep night compared with the sleep prevention night. However, overnight decrements in forced expired volume in 1 s (FEV1) were similar over the 2 nights. The asthmatic patients maintained their minute ventilation as Rla increased during sleep, demonstrating a stable tidal volume with a mild increase in respiratory frequency. We conclude that in asthmatic patients with nocturnal worsening 1) Rla increases and FEV1 falls overnight regardless of sleep state, 2) sleep enhances the observed overnight increases in Rla, and 3) sleep does not abolish compensatory ventilatory responses to spontaneously occurring bronchoconstriction.\r"

  ".W": "A new system was developed in our laboratory to continuously monitor intra-arterial pressure, heart rate, and sympathetic nerve activity in unanesthetized rats. The animals were prepared 24 h before the start of the experiments. Sympathoneural traffic was measured at the level of splanchnic nerve. The amplitude of the spikes recorded at this level was utilized to express sympathetic nerve activity. The amplitude of the residual electroneurogram signal present 30 min after the rats were killed was 32 +/- 2 mV (mean +/- SE; n = 11). For analysis, these background values were subtracted from values determined in vivo. The nerve we studied contains postganglionic fibers, since electrical activity decreased in response to ganglionic blockade with pentolinium (1.25 mg/min iv for 4 min). The amplitude of spikes fell by 43 +/- 4% (n = 4). Sympathetic nerve activity was highly reproducible at a 24-h interval (104 +/- 26 vs. 111 +/- 27 mV for the amplitude of spikes; n = 11). Dose-response curves to the alpha 1-stimulant methoxamine and to bradykinin were established in four rats. The increase in blood pressure induced by methoxamine caused a dose-dependent fall in sympathetic nerve activity, whereas the blood pressure reduction resulting from bradykinin was associated with a dose-dependent activation of sympathetic drive. These data therefore indicate that it is possible with out system to accurately measure sympathetic nerve activity in the awake rat, together with intra-arterial pressure and heart rate.\r"

In anesthetized cats, we tested the hypothesis that intra-arterial injections of lactic and hydrochloric acid, which created levels of these substances in muscle similar to those seen during contraction, reflexly increased cardiovascular and ventilatory function. Hydrochloric acid (32 and 57 mM; 1 ml) injected into the arterial supply of the triceps surae decreased intramuscular pH from 7.26 +/- 0.05 to 7.17 +/- 0.05 (P less than 0.01) and reflexly increased arterial pressure (23 +/- 7 mmHg; P less than 0.01), heart rate (11 +/- 2 beats/min; P less than 0.001), and ventilation (187 +/- 72 ml/min; P less than 0.05). Static contraction of the triceps surae decreased intramuscular pH from 7.28 +/- 0.06 to 7.13 +/- 0.06 (P less than 0.01). Lactic acid was more potent in causing reflexes than was equimolar HCl. For example, lactic acid containing 4 mM lactate and 0.87 mM H+ reflexly increased arterial pressure, heart rate, and ventilation, whereas 0.87 mM HCl did not. Intra-arterial sodium lactate (13 and 33 mM) at a neutral pH had no effect on these variables. We conclude that contraction-induced accumulation of H+, especially that arising from lactic acid, might provide a metabolic stimulus to evoke reflex autonomic effects.\r"

  ".W": "Rowing is a unique exercise for humans, and the imposed biomechanical motion may alter both respiratory mechanics and timing. To investigate the ventilatory patterns of competitive rowers while rowing, we studied the pulmonary function of eight members of the University of Washington Women's Crew and one former member of the 1984 Women's Olympic Rowing Team on a rowing ergometer. Ventilatory performance of the oarswomen was compared both with their performance to exhaustion on a cycle ergometer and with the ventilatory response of six untrained controls on a rowing and a cycle ergometer. We found rowing elicited a higher ventilatory response in both the oarswomen and controls in submaximal and maximal work loads (P less than 0.001). Both oarswomen and controls had higher maximal breathing frequencies when rowing compared with cycling [rowers, 54.7 +/- 1.9 vs 49.8 +/- 0.09 (SE) breaths/min, P less than 0.05; and controls, 53.6 +/- 2.5 vs. 49.2 +/- 4.7, P less than 0.05] and lower maximal tidal volumes (rowers, 1.94 +/- 0.12 vs. 2.21 +/- 0.09 liters, P less than 0.01; controls, 1.59 +/- 0.09 vs. 1.68 +/- 0.19, difference not significant). Both oarswomen and controls were more hypocapnic while rowing compared with cycling (rowers, P less than 0.001; controls, P less than 0.02), although oarswomen were less hypocapnic while rowing than nonrowers (P less than 0.03). These results indicate that rowing causes hyperventilation with a higher breathing frequency and lower tidal volume. This alteration of pattern is possibly secondary to a change in mechanics, which possibly arises from the generation of high exercise ventilation in a variable seated position.\r"

We therefore measured electromyographic activation of the masseters during inspiratory resistance loading and compared it with activation of chin muscles and alae nasi in 10 normal subjects. We observed no masseter activation during quiet unloaded breathing, but as pharyngeal pressure became lower there was a significant increase in masseter activation in all subjects. The change in masseter activation relative to pharyngeal pressure was similar to that of chin muscles and alae nasi. Activation of the masseter preceded the fall in pharyngeal pressure as also occurred in the chin muscles and alae nasi. We conclude that the masseters are activated by inspiratory resistance loading and have respiratory activity similar to pharyngeal airway muscles.\r"

The subjects (6/group) were tested four times: twice at rest for 60 min (5 and 22 degrees C) and twice in a progressive exercise test (5 and 22 degrees C). At rest at 22 degrees C AW had a lower O2 uptake (VO2) than M and lower rectal (Tre) and finger temperatures than EW. At rest at 5 degrees C both AW and EW had lower skin temperature (Tsk) than M, but there were no group differences in peripheral Tsk sites. M increased VO2 after 10 min and EW after 20 min of cold stress; however, AW did not increase metabolism until 60 min. In the two exercise tests Tre increased in proportion to relative work load; in the 5 degrees C test there was little evidence that exercise increased Tsk sites above rest levels. Few of the metabolic or thermal differences could be accounted for by body fatness, body surface area (BSA), or BSA/kg. The data support the hypothesis that M, EW, and AW have different responses to cold stress.\r"

  ".W": "We recently found [at approximately 90% maximal O2 consumption (VO2max)] that as inspiratory PO2 (PIO2) was reduced, VO2 and mixed venous PO2 (PVO2) fell together along a straight line through the origin, suggesting tissue diffusion limitation of VO2max. To extend these observations to VO2max and directly examine effluent venous blood from muscle, six normal men cycled at VO2max while breathing air, 15% O2 and 12% O2 in random order on a single day. From femoral venous, mixed venous, and radial arterial samples, we measured PO2, PCO2, pH, and lactate and computed mean muscle capillary PO2 by Bohr integration between arterial (PaO2) and femoral venous PO2 (PfvO2). VO2 and CO2 production (VCO2) were measured by expired gas analysis, VO2max averaged 61.5 +/- 6.2 (air), 48.6 +/- 4.8 (15% O2), and 38.1 +/- 4.1 (12% O2) ml.kg-1.min-1. Corresponding values were 16.8 +/- 5.6, 14.4 +/- 5.0, and 12.0 +/- 5.0 Torr for PfVO2; 23.6 +/- 3.2, 19.1 +/- 4.2, and 16.2 +/- 3.5 Torr for PVO2; and 38.5 +/- 5.4, 30.3 +/- 4.1, and 24.5 +/- 3.6 Torr for muscle capillary PO2 (PmCO2). Each of the PO2 variables was linearly related to VO2max (r = 0.99 each), with an intercept not different from the origin. Similar results were obtained when the subjects were pushed to a work load 30 W higher to ensure that VO2max had been achieved. By extending our prior observations 1) to maximum VO2 and 2) by direct sampling of femoral venous blood, we conclude that tissue diffusion limitation of VO2max may be present in normal humans. In addition, since PVO2, PfVO2, and PmCO2 all linearly relate to VO2max, we suggest that whichever of these is most readily obtained is acceptable for further evaluation of the hypothesis.\r"

The exercise protocol began at 30 W with the power output being increased 15 W.min-1 until volitional fatigue. Ear and finger probe pulse oximetry measurements of available hemoglobin (%Spo2) were compared with arterial oxyhemoglobin fraction of total hemoglobin (%HbO2) measured directly from arterial blood samples using a CO-oximeter. To provide a wide range of %HbO2 values, four subjects exercised under hypoxic conditions [inspired partial pressure of O2 (PIo2) = 107 Torr], while the remaining six subjects exercised under normoxic conditions (PIo2 = 150 Torr). Because carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO) or methemoglobin (MetHb) is not measured by pulse oximeters, %HbO2 was corrected for HbCO and MetHb and expressed as percent arterial O2 saturation of available Hb (%Sao2). Small and insignificant differences (P greater than 0.05) existed between SpO2 (all 3 instruments) and %SaO2 at the lowest work rate and the highest power output achieved. Regression analyses of %SpO2 vs. %SaO2 produced correlation coefficients of r = 0.82 [standard error of the estimate [(SEE) = 1.79], r = 0.89 (SEE = 1.48), and r = 0.93 (SEE = 1.14) for the Biox IIa, Ohmeda 3700 (ear), and the Ohmeda 3700 (finger) pulse oximeters, respectively.

Recently, it has been suggested that vascular pressures may rise to levels that damage the vessels, leaving the patient at risk for further edema development. The objective of this study was to determine if pulmonary vascular protein permeability is increased in a canine isolated perfused left lower lung lobe (LLL) preparation by pressure transients that may occur in NPE. Venous pressure (Pv) was transiently raised to values ranging from 8 to 102 Torr in 19 LLL. One Pv transient was studied per LLL. After Pv was returned to normal, the osmotic reflection coefficient (sigma d) for total proteins was determined by the hematocrit-protein double indicator technique. No reduction in sigma d was observed until microvascular pressure exceeded 70 Torr. The average sigma d for the 11 LLL in which the peak microvascular pressure was less than 70 Torr was 0.74 +/- 0.03 (SE). Above this level sigma d fell linearly with increasing Pv, with a value of 0.26 being observed after the highest Pv transient. These results suggest that protein permeability may increase in patients with NPE who develop very large increases in pulmonary vascular pressures but may not be a universal occurrence in this disorder.\r"

  ".W": "We asked 1) whether newborn rats respond to chronic hypercapnia with a persistent increase in ventilation and 2) whether changes in lung mass were accompanying the respiratory adaptation to chronic hypercapnia, as previously observed during neonatal chronic hypoxia. Five litters of rats were kept in 7% CO2 (with 21% O2) from day 1 to 7 after birth (CO2exp) and compared with six litters of control rats growing in normocapnia-normoxia (C). Body weight was similar between the two groups. Ventilation, measured by flow plethysmography, increased in CO2exp from day 2 and remained steadily elevated, and at day 7 it almost doubled (174%) the C value because of the large increase in tidal volume and mean inspiratory flow (192 and 189%, respectively) with no changes in respiratory frequency. Two days after return to normocapnia, ventilation was still 33% higher than in C; at this time, acute exposure to hypercapnia increased ventilation relatively less in the CO2exp than in C because of a lower increase in tidal volume. Neither the lung weight-to-body weight nor the heart weight-to-body weight ratios increased in CO2exp. We conclude that 1) chronic hypercapnia in newborn rats induces a steady increase in ventilation, which persists at least 2 days after return to normocapnia with a reduction in the acute response to CO2, and 2) hyperventilation per se is not the cause of the increased lung mass observed during chronic neonatal hypoxia.\r"

The effect of pyocyanin was slower in onset, 600 ng causing 60% reduction in tracheal mucus velocity at 3 h, and no recovery occurred. A combination of pyocyanin and 1-hydroxyphenazine produced an initial rapid slowing equivalent to the same dose of 1-hydroxyphenazine given alone, but the later slowing attributed to pyocyanin was greater than the same dose administered alone.

  ".W": "Oxygen consumption (VO2) and shivering movements were recorded in adult, conscious cats in a thermoneutral (24-27 degrees C) and in a cold (3-8 degrees C) environment during normoxia, hypoxia, or hyperoxia for 55 min. In the cold environment, VO2 correlated with shivering index (SI) under conditions of normoxia or ambient hypoxia (FIO2 = 0.12). During normoxia, VO2 was 63% higher in the cold than the thermoneutral environment. Ambient hypoxia acutely reduced VO2 in cold and thermoneutral environments, the decrement being greater for the former than the latter. Similarly, the variation in VO2 for unit change in SI was greater in hypoxia than normoxic conditions, suggesting that hypoxia influenced nonshivering as well as shivering components of cold-induced VO2. Hypoxia induced by CO (FICO = 0.002) also reduced VO2 and SI, a result that is consistent with previous results indicating that carotid body chemoreceptors do not mediate the suppression of shivering by ambient hypoxia. Hyperoxia increased VO2 and SI in the cold, and the effects of both hypoxia and hyperoxia in the cold were antagonized by increasing FICO2 to 0.03. The results demonstrate that hypoxia suppresses VO2 in the cold by reducing the intensity of shivering and, probably, by an action on metabolic rate that is unrelated to cold-induced calorigenesis.\r"

Forearm blood flow and muscle mass were measured by venous occlusion plethysmography and magnetic resonance imaging, respectively. Metabolic measurements and flow were determined at rest and during submaximal exercise in both forearms. After a warm-up period, six normal right-handed male subjects performed 7.5 min of wrist flexion exercise in the magnet (1 contraction every 5 s), first with the ND forearm and then with the D forearm, at 23, 46, and 69 J/min. At rest, there were no differences between forearms in Pi/PCr or pH. However, at each work load the D forearm demonstrated significantly lower Pi/PCr and higher pH than the ND forearm. Blood flow was not significantly different between the forearms at rest or during exercise. Because these subjects were not engaged in unilateral arm training, we conclude that 1) Pi/PCr is lower and pH is higher in the D compared with the ND forearm in normal subjects during submaximal exercise, 2) these differences are independent of muscle mass and blood flow, and 3) the cumulative effect of long-term, low-level daily activity provides an adequate training stimulus for muscular metabolic adaptations.\r"

Seven subjects had normal heart function and no evidence of coronary artery disease (CAD); three patients had CAD. High-fidelity multisensor catheters were employed to simultaneously record right and left heart pressures before PASG inflation and after inflation to 40, 70, and 100 mmHg. A thermal dilution catheter was used to obtain pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and cardiac output. Counterpressure increases greater than or equal to 40 mmHg were associated with significant changes in left and right heart pressures. Right and left ventricular end-diastolic pressures increased 100% (P less than 0.01); mean pulmonary arterial and aortic pressures increased 77 and 25%, respectively (P less than 0.01); systemic vascular resistance increased 22% (P less than 0.05) and pulmonary vascular resistance did not change in normal subjects at maximum PASG inflation. Heart rate, cardiac output, and aortic and pulmonary arterial pulse pressures did not change during inflation in either group. Right and left ventricular end-diastolic pressures and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure were greater (P less than 0.05) in the CAD group compared with the normal subjects during PASG inflation. The data suggest that the primary mechanism whereby PASG inflation induces changes in central hemodynamics in normovolemic subjects is through an acute increase in left ventricular afterload. PASG changes in afterload and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure imply that these devices should be used with caution in patients with compromised cardiac function.\r"

The animals were maintained for 11 days in an intensive care unit. Light microscopically, animals ventilated with 40 and 80% O2 showed mild lung injury, consisting mostly of an increase in alveolar macrophages in peribronchiolar sites and focal alveolar wall widening. The 100% O2-oleic acid, 100% O2, and 80% O2-Pseudomonas-treated baboons showed mixed exudative-reparative diffuse alveolar lesions. Ultrastructurally, the type II cells of these three groups had significantly altered morphology with aberrations of lamellar body configurations. Morphometric findings showed increases in type II and interstitial cells and decreases in type I and endothelial cells in these injured animals. A striking finding was that the physiological, morphological, and morphometric changes of an 80% O2-Pseudomonas insult was as injurious as 100% O2. This synergistic effect of hyperoxia and infection very likely reflects the most frequent evolution of adult respiratory distress syndrome in patients in intensive care units.\r"

After 4-5 days of exposure to 100% O2, disaturated phophatidylcholine (DSPC) decreased to 87% of control, whereas the ratio of phosphatidylglycerol to phosphatidylinositol (PG/PI) was 37% of control. Longer periods of ventilation with 100% O2 resulted in DSPC falling to less than 40% of control. The injury was not reversed by reducing the O2 to 50%; rather, a progressive deterioration ensued. Acute respiratory failure (ARF) induced by 5 days of bacterial infection was very similar to that seen after 5 days of exposure to 100% O2. Ventilation with 80% O2 for 6 days resulted in smaller changes in DSPC but with differences in PG/PI comparable to those seen with 100% O2 or infection. We conclude that the ability of the type II cell to synthesize surfactant of normal composition is significantly impaired in these models of ARF. The earliest index of biochemical modification is the substantial change in PG/PI, which may be predictive of early lung injury. Further exacerbation of the injury could result in the reduction of DSPC content, with subsequent changes in lung mechanics and gas exchange.\r"

  ".W": "Effect of upper airway pressure changes on thoracic inspiratory muscles has been shown to depend on the time of application during the breathing cycle. The present study was designed to investigate the importance of the time of application of upper airway negative pressure pulses on upper airway muscles. The upper airway was functionally isolated into a closed system in 24 anesthetized spontaneously breathing rabbits. Negative pressure pulses were applied in early (within the first 200 ms) and late (greater than or equal to 200 ms) inspiration, while electromyograms (EMG) of the diaphragm (Dia), genioglossus (GG), alae nasi (AN), and/or posterior cricoarytenoid (PCA) muscles were simultaneously monitored. When negative pressure pulse was applied in early inspiration, the increase in GG activity was greater [0.49 +/- 0.37 to 4.24 +/- 3.71 arbitrary units (AU)] than when negative pressure was applied in late inspiration (0.44 +/- 0.29 to 2.64 +/- 3.05 AU). Similarly, increased activation of AN (2.63 +/- 1.01 to 4.26 +/- 1.69 AU) and PCA (3.46 +/- 1.16 to 6.18 +/- 2.93 AU) was also observed with early inspiratory application of negative pressure pulses; minimal effects were seen in these muscles with late application. An inhibitory effect on respiratory timing consisting of a prolongation in inspiration (TI) and a decrease in peak Dia EMG/TI was observed as previously reported. These results indicate that the time of application of negative pressure during the breathing cycle is an important variable in determining the magnitude of the response of upper airway muscles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The increase in lobar vascular resistance in response to sympathetic nerve stimulation was reduced by prazosin and to a lesser extent by yohimbine, the respective alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists. Moreover, in animals pretreated with a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist to prevent an interaction between alpha- and beta 2-adrenoceptors, responses to nerve stimulation were reduced by prazosin, but yohimbine had no significant effect. On the other hand, in animals pretreated with a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine had an inhibitory effect on responses to tyramine and to norepinephrine. Propranolol had no significant effect on the response to nerve stimulation, whereas ICI 118551, a selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, enhanced responses to nerve stimulation and injected norepinephrine. The present data suggest that neuronally released norepinephrine increases pulmonary vascular resistance in the cat by acting mainly on alpha 1-adrenoceptors and to a lesser extent on postjunctional alpha 2-adrenoceptors but that this effect is counteracted by an action on presynaptic alpha 2-receptors. The present studies also suggest that neuronally released norepinephrine acts on beta 2-adrenoceptors and that the response to sympathetic nerve stimulation represents the net effect of the adrenergic transmitter on alpha 1-, alpha 2-, and beta 2-adrenoceptors in the pulmonary vascular bed.\r"

Intravenous injections of PAF caused dose-dependent increases in lung resistance (RL) and decreases in dynamic compliance (Cdyn) and systemic arterial (aortic) pressure (PAO). The increases in RL and decreases in Cdyn in response to PAF were markedly reduced by sodium meclofenamate, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, whereas the decreases in PAO were unchanged. Increases in RL and decreases in Cdyn but not PAO in response to PAF were reduced by SQ 29,548, a thromboxane (Tx) receptor blocking agent. CV 3988, a PAF receptor antagonist, reduced bronchoconstrictor and aortic depressor responses to PAF but had no effect on responses to the Tx mimic, U 46619, or to the prostaglandin precursor, arachidonic acid. The present studies suggest that bronchoconstrictor responses but not the hypotensive response to PAF are mediated in large part by the release of arachidonic acid from cell membrane phospholipids and the formation of cyclooxygenase products including TxA2. These data indicate that although airway and vasodepressor responses to PAF in the cat are mediated by different mechanisms, a similar PAF-CV 3988-sensitive receptor is involved.\r"

When the animals were exposed to a low ambient temperature of 9 degrees C, concurrently with a hypergravic field of 2.1 G, Tc of rats raised at 1 G fell markedly by approximately 6 degrees C (to 30.8 +/- 0.6 degrees C) while that of the rats raised at 2.1 G remained relatively constant (falling only approximately 1 degree C to 36.4 +/- 0.3 degrees C). Thus prior acclimation to a 2.1-G field enabled rats to maintain Tc when cold exposed in a 2.1-G field. To maintain Tc, thermogenic mechanisms were successfully activated in the 2.1-G-acclimated rats as shown by measurements of VO2. In contrast, VO2 measurements showed that rats reared at 1 G and then cold exposed at 2.1 G did not activate thermogenic mechanisms sufficiently to prevent a fall in Tc. In other experiments, rats acclimated to either 1 or 2.1 G were found to lack the ability to maintain their Tc when exposed to a 5.8-G field or when exposed to prolonged cold exposure at 1 G. Results are interpreted as showing that when placed in a 2.1-G field, rats acclimated to 2.1 G can more closely maintain their Tc near 37 degrees C when cold exposed than can rats acclimated to 1 G. However, this enhanced regulatory ability of 2.1-G-acclimated rats over 1.0-G-acclimated rats is restricted to 2.1-G fields and is not observed in 1.0- and 5.8-G fields.\r"

A FORTRAN-77 program has been developed for estimating the optimal parameters and the coordinates of the separation point(s). A few sets of data illustrating this kind of problem in the analysis of thermoregulation, osmoregulation, and the neuronal responses are discussed.\r"

For these studies, airway responsiveness was determined from slopes of carbachol dose-response curves (DRC) performed at base line (prechallenge) and 2 h after Ascaris suum antigen challenges in the following three protocols: 1) antigen challenge alone (control trial), 2) WEB-2086 (1 mg/kg iv) given 30 min before antigen challenge (WEB pretreatment), and 3) WEB-2086 given 2 h after antigen challenge, immediately before the postchallenge DRC (WEB posttreatment). Airway inflammation was assessed by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) before antigen challenge and after the postchallenge DRC for each trial. A. suum challenge resulted in acute increases in specific lung resistance that were not different among the three trials. Antigen challenge (control trial) caused a 93% increase (P less than 0.05) in the slope of the carbachol DRC when compared with the prechallenge value. WEB pretreatment (1 mg/kg) reduced (P less than 0.05) this antigen-induced hyperresponsiveness, whereas pretreatment with a 3-mg/kg dose completely prevented it. WEB posttreatment was ineffective in blocking this hyperresponsiveness. BAL neutrophils increased after antigen challenge in the control trial and when WEB-2086 was given after antigen challenge (P less than 0.05). Pretreatment with WEB-2086 (1 or 3 mg/kg) prevented this neutrophilia. This study provides indirect evidence for antigen-induced PAF release in vivo and for a role of endogenous PAF in the modulation of airway responsiveness and airway inflammation after antigen-induced bronchoconstriction in sheep.\r"

We examined their metabolic relationship by in vivo labeling studies and by physical manipulation, cycling the surface area in vitro in an attempt to convert one subtype into another. Labeling studies indicated rapid quantitative progression of surfactant through ultraheavy, heavy, and light subtypes in sequence. To mimic the in vivo conversion of subtypes in vitro we \"cycled\" the surface area of surfactant in plastic tubes. Newly secreted surfactant obtained from incubated lungs, as well as surfactant obtained by alveolar lavage and lamellar bodies, exhibited conversion of material from heavier to lighter subtypes. The conversion between subtypes was quantal and was dependent on cycling, temperature, and time. We conclude that the three subtypes are discrete forms of alveolar surfactant that evolve from one into another. Cycling may provide a means to study the mechanisms of their interconversion in vitro.\r"

Measurements of regional ventilation (V) and perfusion (Q) were included to analyze whether these indexes are influenced by the same confounders. We studied 39 males and females between 21 and 67 yr of age. Average PCl of the lungs was 0.85 +/- 0.25%.min-1. There was a significant difference between PCl of the central and peripheral parts of the lungs (P less than 0.01). Regional V and Q were greater in the lower than in the upper halves of the lungs (P less than 0.01). There was no relation between PCl, V, or Q and the sex, age, and height of the individuals. It is concluded that when measuring PCl in adult individuals anthropometric measurements need not be considered.\r"

Although only approximately 13% of the labeled surfactant phosphatidylcholine was recovered by alveolar wash at 24 h, there was no significant loss of the labeled phosphatidylcholine from the lungs. Labeled palmitic acid intravascularly injected at 1 h of age comparably labeled lung phosphatidylcholine in the three groups of lambs at 5 h; however, only approximately 0.5% of the labeled phosphatidylcholine was secreted to the air spaces of surfactant-treated lambs at 24 h. Labeled lysophosphatidylcholine given with the natural sheep surfactant was taken up by the lungs, converted to phosphatidylcholine with 30-40% efficiency, and resecreted to the air spaces, demonstrating recycling of a phospholipid. The large surfactant aggregates recovered from alveolar washes by centrifugation were surface active and contained approximately 76% of the air-space phosphatidylcholine in both surfactant-treated groups. Although clinical status was comparable, alveolar washes and surfactant subfractions from Surfactant TA-treated lambs had better surface properties than did sheep surfactant-treated lambs. These studies identified no detrimental effects of surfactant treatments on endogenous surfactant metabolism and indicated that the surfactants used for treatments were recycled by the preterm ventilated lamb lung.\r"

The drug ingestion increased the total 3-h energy expenditure by 18.6% compared with that of the placebo ingestion in the cold (P less than 0.01). By means of the nonprotein respiratory exchange ratio to calculate the rates of substrate oxidation, it was found that the drug ingestion increased carbohydrate oxidation by as much as 41.7% above that of the placebo (P less than 0.05). In contrast, the drug mixture had no significant influence on lipid or protein metabolism. The results demonstrate that the ingestion of an ephedrine-caffeine mixture improves cold tolerance in humans by significantly increasing body temperatures in the cold. These improvements were not caused by an increased conservation of heat but by a greater energy expenditure, which appears to be dependent on an enhanced carbohydrate utilization.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this study was to develop an empirical model relating human running performance to some characteristics of metabolic energy-yielding processes using A, the capacity of anaerobic metabolism (J/kg); MAP, the maximal aerobic power (W/kg); and E, the reduction in peak aerobic power with the natural logarithm of race duration T, when T greater than TMAP = 420 s. Accordingly, the model developed describes the average power output PT (W/kg) sustained over any T as PT = [S/T(1 - e-T/k2)] + 1/T integral of T O [BMR + B(1 - e-t/k1)]dt where S = A and B = MAP - BMR (basal metabolic rate) when T less than TMAP; and S = A + [Af ln(T/TMAP)] and B = (MAP - BMR) + [E ln(T/TMAP)] when T greater than TMAP; k1 = 30 s and k2 = 20 s are time constants describing the kinetics of aerobic and anaerobic metabolism, respectively, at the beginning of exercise; f is a constant describing the reduction in the amount of energy provided from anaerobic metabolism with increasing T; and t is the time from the onset of the race. This model accurately estimates actual power outputs sustained over a wide range of events, e.g., average absolute error between actual and estimated T for men's 1987 world records from 60 m to the marathon = 0.73%. In addition, satisfactory estimations of the metabolic characteristics of world-class male runners were made as follows: A = 1,658 J/kg; MAP = 83.5 ml O2.kg-1.min-1; 83.5% MAP sustained over the marathon distance. Application of the model to analysis of the evolution of A, MAP, and E, and of the progression of men's and women's world records over the years, is presented.\r"

Despite direct contact between the cartridges and the egg, minute movements of the egg attributable to cardiac contractions of the embryo (ballistocardiogram, BCG) could be simultaneously detected from at least three points. The results showed that the amplitude of BCG waves was dependent on the site of detection, indicating that the BCG was a directional wave. The cartridge system for BCG measurement was incorporated in the electrocardiography and arterial catheterization to acquire simultaneously electrocardiogram (ECG), BCG, and blood pressure from the embryo confined in the egg. Isochronal comparison of these waves indicated that the ballistic movements of the embryo might be caused not only by the ventricular contraction but also by the atrial excitation, i.e., the BCG comprised waves appearing in the ventricular presystolic, contraction, and ejection periods. For wide changes in the heart rate, the approximate isometric ventricular contraction period remained almost constant.\r"

In 100% O2-equilibrated media, the mean basal glucose consumption calculated from the rate of 2-[1,2-3H]deoxy-D-glucose phosphorylation and its specific activity in the incubation media was 61 nmol.g tissue-1.min-1 in the carotid body and 42 nmol.g tissue-1.min-1 in parallel experiments with nodose ganglia. Low PO2 (20% O2-equilibrated media in vitro) increased glucose consumption in the carotid body by 44% but did not alter glucose metabolism of nodose ganglia. Autoradiographic data showed that preneural type I parenchymal cells are the principal site of glucose consumption in carotid chemosensory tissue. The mechanisms responsible for the hypoxia-induced increase in glucose consumption by the type I cells are discussed in relation to sensory transduction by the carotid body chemoreceptors.\r"

This allows the direct measurement of alveolar pressure during spontaneous breathing. We measured alveolar pressure in normal dogs using this technique while suddenly interrupting flow at the trachea during passive expiration. Tracheal pressure exhibited a very rapid rise immediately on interruption that we showed to be composed of two distinct and roughly equal parts: one was the resistive pressure drop across the airways, and the other was a resistive pressure drop across tissues. By simultaneously measuring pleural pressure we showed that the tissues responsible were only in the chest wall and not in the lungs.\r"

  ".W": "In 20 runners the intra-arterial blood pressure changes determined by a long-distance run and by a maximal bicycle ergometric test were recorded by means of the portable Oxford system. A peculiar pattern of the phasic waves was observed throughout the run: continuous rhythmic pulse pressure oscillations ranging in frequency between 4 and 28/min and unrelated to respiration were detected. The shape of these oscillations prompted us to investigate whether they were due to a \"beat\" phenomenon, that is, to the combined effect of two waves with a nearly equal frequency. To test this hypothesis, during the run 10 athletes carried a fluid-filled container around the chest. The pressure waves recorded in the container were added by computer to those recorded intra-arterially during bicycle ergometry. The resultant harmonic showed a pattern similar to that recorded in the athlete's radial artery during running. Conversely, by subtracting the pressure waves recorded in the container from those simultaneously recorded at the radial artery during running, nearly flat tracings were obtained. The source of the beat phenomenon has therefore been identified in the wave, which generates inside the aorta and the great vessels at each foot-strike shock.\r"

Mean tissue PO2 (PtiO2) was significantly lower (C, 78.4 +/- 3.0 Torr; H, 65.3 +/- 4.8; P less than 0.01). Except for two experiments with good autoregulation, the decrease in PtiO2 correlated with the reduction in blood pressure (r = 0.791, P less than 0.005). Measurements of O2 disappearance curves (DCs) and sinus nerve discharge (ND) were obtained after blood supply was occluded for 30-45 s (56 C DCs, 44 H DCs). Disappearance rates (dPO2/dt) were significantly slower after hemorrhage (C, -7.52 +/- 0.47 Torr/s; H, -6.60 +/- 0.44; P less than 0.01), decreasing by 0.656 Torr/s for each 10 Torr fall in PtiO2 (r = 0.626, P less than 0.05). Resting ND before occlusion increased during hypotension (11.6 +/- 2.9% of control, P less than 0.01) and correlated with the decrease in PtiO2 (r = -0.792, P less than 0.005). A computer simulation was performed for a two-cytochrome metabolic model with a second, low-O2-affinity oxidase in addition to normal oxidative metabolism. The effects of cat oxyhemoglobin and blood pH on the O2 DC measurement were also taken into account. The simulation for the two-cytochrome model was consistent with our experimental data and predicts reductions in blood flow and O2 metabolism with hypotension after hemorrhage that have similarities, as well as aspects that disagree, with previous reports in the literature.\r"

One set of rats aged 6 and 18 mo were assigned to an exercise group (treadmill running) or an age-matched sedentary control group. After 6 mo (at the ages of 12 and 24 mo), LP and levels of alpha-tocopherol and its oxidized form, alpha-tocopheryl quinone, were measured. The extent of LP was determined in homogenates by measuring the content of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances. After homogenization, the muscles were immediately evaluated for basal LP and also incubated in the presence of oxidant stressors for 2 h to assess antioxidant capacity (AOC) and for 24 h to estimate total peroxidizable lipid (TPL). Basal LP was not affected by age or exercise. AOC was not affected by exercise at either age. However aging significantly decreased AOC and increased alpha-tocopheryl quinone in both sedentary and exercised groups. TPL was not affected by age, but was increased by exercise training (P less than 0.05). Another set of rats was divided into the following three groups at 3 mo of age: sedentary, fed ad libitum (S); sedentary, caloric restricted by alternate day feeding (R); and exercised by forced treadmill running (E). Two years later, when the rats were 27 mo of age, the extent of LP was assessed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The present study examined PMN kinetics in vivo to determine if this sequestration was specific to the lung. Venous or arterial injections of radiolabeled PMNs were given to animals receiving infusions of zymosan-activated plasma (ZAP) or saline, and the PMN distribution was evaluated 10 min later. In control animals, the relative size of the marginated and circulating PMN pools was similar after venous or arterial injection and regional PMN retention increased as blood velocity slowed. ZAP infusion produced threefold increases in PMNs within pulmonary capillaries after venous injection and PMN retention was independent of blood velocity. After arterial injection, ZAP infusion produced PMN sequestration in all organs. Rigid (glutaraldehyde-fixed) PMNs injected into control rabbits showed increased lung recoveries similar to those of fresh PMNs injected into ZAP-treated rabbits. We conclude that activation of the complement system causes PMN sequestration in both the pulmonary and the systemic microvasculature and that the decrease in PMN deformability that occurs with activation of the PMN may be important in the genesis of PMN sequestration.\r"

  ".W": "Normovolemic polycythemia did not improve the ability of either resting muscle or gut to maintain O2 uptake (VO2) during severe hypoxia because of the adverse effects of increased viscosity on blood flow to those regions. The present study tested whether increased metabolic demand would promote vasodilation sufficiently to overcome those effects. We measured whole body, muscle, and gut blood flow, O2 extraction, and VO2 in anesthetized dogs after increasing hematocrit to 65% and raising O2 demand with 2,4-dinitrophenol (n = 8). We also tested whether regional denervation (n = 8) and hypervolemia (n = 6) affected these responses. After raising hematocrit and metabolism, the dogs were ventilated with air, with 9% O2-91% N2, and again with air for 30-min periods. Reduced blood flow and increased O2 demand, caused by increased blood viscosity and 2,4-dinitrophenol, respectively, increased O2 extraction so that muscle VO2 was nearly supply limited in normoxia. Denervation showed that vasoconstriction had increased in gut and muscle with hypoxia onset but this was overcome after 15 min. By then, muscle was receiving a major portion of cardiac output, whereas gut showed little change. With hypervolemia cardiac output increased in hypoxia but neither gut nor muscle increased blood flow in those experiments. Because regional and whole body VO2 fell in all groups during hypoxia to the same extent found earlier in normocythemic dogs, any real benefit of polycythemia under the conditions of these experiments was dubious at best.\r"

The fractures had been treated initially by closed reduction and immobilization in a cast, external fixation followed by immobilization in a cast, fixation by pins incorporated in a plaster cast, minimum internal fixation and immobilization in a cast, dynamic compression plating, or intramedullary nailing with or without reaming. After the initial treatment had failed, intramedullary nailing with reaming was done to gain union. Although closed nailing of the tibia was preferred, in thirty-three patients, the site of the non-union was opened to improve alignment by performing an osteotomy or to remove failed hardware. Bone grafts from the iliac crest were used in ten patients, and a fibular ostectomy or osteotomy was done in thirty-three. Of thirty-four open fractures (fourteen grade I, seven grade II, and thirteen grade III), eight were infected at the time of intramedullary nailing. The average time of the diagnosis of a non-union was 9.6 months; the average length of follow-up after nailing was twenty months. In forty-nine (96 per cent) of the fifty-one patients, tibial union occurred at an average of seven months postoperatively. Complications included persistent infection (three patients), acquired infection after intramedullary nailing with reaming (three patients), fracture of the nail that necessitated an additional operation (two patients), shortening of more than one centimeter (two patients), malrotation of more than 15 degrees (one patient), peroneal palsy (one patient), and amputation (one patient). When used to treat non-union of the tibia, intramedullary nailing with reaming can produce union as effectively as other alternatives, while enabling the patient to function more normally without external immobilization or walking aids.\r"

  ".W": "An experiment was designed to determine whether the material properties of fracture callus can be predicted by the measurement of mineral density. Rat tibiae that had a closed fracture were used to obtain uniform specimens of fracture callus at sequential stages of healing. An in vitro indentation test was done and tissue was biopsied, using a trephine, to determine the hardness and calcium content of a standardized area of callus tissue. The hardness of the callus was correlated with the mineral density of the local tissue, which initially had been measured non-invasively with single-photon-based micro-bone densitometry. The progress of differentiation and remodeling of callus was determined by comparative planimetric and microradiographic analyses of tissue. Determinations of density showed a linear correlation with concentrations of a hydroxyapatite equivalent solution (r = 0.997, p less than 0.001), with the ash weight of control specimens of cortical-trabecular bone (r = 0.998, p less than 0.001), and with the calcium content (micrograms per cubic millimeter) of the fracture callus (r = 0.854, p less than 0.001). The hardness of the callus had a non-linear relationship (r = 0.959, p less than 0.005) with the mineral density per volume of tissue, as measured by micro-bone densitometry. Clinical Relevance: The appearance of fracture callus on conventional radiographs is an important clinical finding in the assessment of fracture-healing. It is, however, an unreliable predictor of the strength of the union of the fracture. Three-dimensional imaging and quantification of bone mineral provide additional data about the quality and geometry of fracture callus. Our study showed that mineral content per unit of volume is a good index of hardness of the fracture callus. Thus, quantitative imaging may be useful clinically for monitoring fracture-healing.\r"

Most of the fractures occurred two years or less after the initial operation. Fourteen knees were rated fair or poor and twenty-two, good or excellent. None of the thirty-six implants had been aligned in the neutral range. In sixteen knees, the alignment had a minor variation from the neutral range--that is, the knees were in minor malalignment. In general, these knees had the least severe fractures and the best over-all results. All had a good or excellent result except one, which was revised because of a loose patellar component. That knee was rated as fair at the latest follow-up. There was a major discrepancy in the alignment of twenty implants. These knees had more severe fractures and less satisfactory results than those in the other group. In two of these knees, the fracture was treated non-operatively; one had a good and the other, a poor result. Twelve of the remaining knees, which were treated surgically, were rated as fair or worse. Two knees that had revision of three components and restoration of alignment to the neutral range had an excellent result. The results of this study indicate that the alignment and fit of a component are important in determining the severity of a fracture of the patella after condylar total knee replacement and the long-term results after treatment of the fracture.\r"

Thirty of the patients had an associated laminar fracture. Eleven of the thirty, all of whom had a lumbar fracture and a preoperative neurological deficit, were noted at operation to have dural laceration. In four of the patients who had dural laceration, neural elements were entrapped between the fragments from the laminar fracture. None of the remaining thirty patients who did not have a laminar fracture had dural laceration (p = 0.0002). Univariate and multivariate statistical analysis revealed no significant association of the dural laceration with the patients' age or sex, or with the radiographic characteristics of the spine. There was a significant association between dural laceration and neurological deficit (p = 0.0001). In our series, the presence of a preoperative neurological deficit in a patient who had a burst fracture and an associated laminar fracture was a sensitive (100 per cent) and specific (74 per cent) predictor of dural laceration. The presence of this fracture pattern and an associated neurological deficit also predicted a risk of dural laceration with entrapped neural elements. This information may influence decisions as to whether an anterior or a posterior surgical approach should be used in such patients.\r"

The average postoperative score was 84 points; there were eight good or excellent results and three failures. The latter three patients had an additional operation: one each for dislocation, loosening of the humeral component, and deep infection. Salvage of supracondylar non-union by means of a total elbow arthroplasty is a technically demanding procedure. Strict indications for selection of patients must be followed. A semiconstrained implant is recommended, with preservation of the epicondyles and their muscular attachments in order to achieve balance of the soft tissues.\r"

  ".W": "We reviewed the clinical charts and spinal radiographs of fifty-one boys who had Duchenne muscular dystrophy, had not had surgical treatment of the spine, and had been followed until death. All had scoliosis. None of the following variables was useful in predicting which curves would become severe: age when the patient initially walked, age when he ceased walking, age at onset of spinal collapse, surgical release of the iliotibial bands, or age at the time of death. Radiographs were made within eighteen months before death for thirty-three patients; in thirty-one of them, the final curve exceeded 40 degrees and in seventeen, 90 degrees. For the remaining eighteen patients, final radiographs were made more than eighteen months before death; at that time, eight of them already had a curve of more than 90 degrees. Although there was a relationship between extension of the lumbar spine and severity of scoliosis at the time of final follow-up, early maintenance of the lumbar spine in extension rarely prevented the development of a severe curve. For most of the patients who had a severe curve, sitting was difficult and was accompanied by breakdown of the skin and pain. When a patient's curve exceeded 35 degrees, the vital capacity usually was less than 40 per cent of the predicted normal value. Therefore, when walking becomes impossible for boys who have Duchenne muscular dystrophy, routine spinal arthrodesis should be considered.\r"

  ".W": "The electromyographic activities of six muscles of the thigh were recorded, using bipolar surface electrodes, during active extension of the knee by six healthy men. The signal amplitudes were normalized to those recorded during isometric maximum voluntary contractions. Extension of the knee from 90 to 0 degrees (full extension) was performed at the rate of 10 degrees per second with the leg unimpeded and with weights of 1.8, 3.6, 5.4, or 7.2 kilograms attached to the ankle. The hamstrings were found to coactivate with the quadriceps during the terminal phase of extension. Coactivation of all three hamstrings was found to occur at joint angles of as much as 9 degrees, with the maximum at full extension of the knee and the strength of the signals ranging to as much as 20 per cent. The signals of all of the flexors and extensors increased with increasing loads on the ankle and, with the exception of the rectus femoris at 9 degrees of flexion, they also increased as the knee extended. The results of this study support the hypothesis that the hamstrings function synergistically with the anterior cruciate ligament to prevent the anterior tibial displacement that is produced by active contraction of the quadriceps in the terminal degrees of extension of the knee. This information is important for the physical conditioning of healthy individuals in preparation for athletic endeavors. Furthermore, if coactivation of the hamstrings with the quadriceps is mediated by sensors other than, or in addition to, those of the anterior cruciate ligament, then strengthening of the hamstrings appears to be an important adjunct to rehabilitation programs after repair or reconstruction of that ligament.\r"

In all other respects, the knees were treated in an identical fashion. Of the 111 patients, 107 were re-examined forty-five months or more after operation. At the most recent follow-up, the knees that had been treated by repair and augmentation of the anterior cruciate ligament were significantly more stable and had had significantly fewer subsequent meniscal tears. Sufficient instability to necessitate late reconstruction was also less frequent in the patients who had had an augmented repair. These patients had better function of the knee and a higher level of activity than the patients in the other two groups. Sixty-four per cent of these patients who had a rupture of the anterior cruciate also had a meniscal tear, and primary care was indicated for more than 50 per cent of the tears. Therefore, we believe that early arthroscopic examination is essential for patients who have an acute rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament.\r"

We also determined the anterior tibial displacement and anterior compliance, using the Lachman test. The subjects were divided into groups according to the type of autogenous intra-articular substitute (either the central one-third of the patellar tendon or the semitendinosus tendon) that had been used for the anterior cruciate ligament and according to the duration of follow-up (range, twenty-four to 101 months). Lachman tests were performed, applying sixty-eight and ninety newtons of force, and indices for anterior compliance were calculated. Although significantly more anterior laxity was demonstrated with both sixty-eight and ninety newtons of force in the reconstructed knees than in the contralateral, normal knees (p less than 0.001), thirteen subjects, of whom eight lacked full extension of the reconstructed knee, had more anterior laxity in the normal knee. Analyses of variance showed no significant differences in the results of the Lachman tests as related to either the type of reconstruction or the length of postoperative follow-up. The results suggested that the two types of ligamentous substitute that were used in this study were equally efficient in limiting anterior tibial displacement, as demonstrated by the Lachman test. The study also demonstrated that the substitutes did not elongate significantly during the period of the study.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective review was conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of a temporary subarachnoid shunt to treat patients who have a leak of cerebrospinal fluid after a spinal operation. The shunt is percutaneously inserted in the lumbar spine and is removed after four days. This technique was used in nineteen patients over a ten-year period. Of the seventeen patients who had the shunt in place for the full four days, fourteen had resolution of the drainage of cerebrospinal fluid from the wound. One of two patients whose shunt was removed early also had a successful result. Eleven of the fifteen patients who were successfully treated were available for follow-up, and none had any adverse effects related to the original cerebrospinal-fluid leak or its treatment. The four patients who had a persistent leak were successfully treated with reoperation and direct repair of the dura. Eleven (58 per cent) of the nineteen patients had transient complaints of nausea and vomiting while being treated with subarachnoid drainage. Two of the nineteen patients had evidence of an intradural infection after placement of the catheter; the infection resolved in both patients after removal of the catheter and treatment with appropriate antibiotics. Closed subarachnoid drainage, when properly performed and monitored, is a reasonably effective and safe method for treating dural-cutaneous cerebrospinal-fluid leaks after a spinal operation. It may be considered as a non-operative alternative to the standard procedure of reoperation and direct repair of the dura. A good result is still possible in patients in whom this technique fails and who eventually need surgical management.\r"

We now describe one parathyroid adenoma in which a molecular cytogenetic approach revealed clonal loss of one chromosome 11. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the patient's normal leukocyte DNA demonstrated heterozygosity at four loci (PTH, INT2, APOA1, and ETS1) that span the length of chromosome 11. However, the adenoma DNA showed clonal deletion of one allele, i.e. loss of heterozygosity, at each locus. Use of five nonpolymorphic probes from chromosome 11 was consistent with 50% loss of total chromosome 11 DNA in the adenoma. No tumor-specific loss of heterozygosity was observed when restriction fragment length polymorphisms from five other autosomes (no. 1, 5, 6, 7, and 12) were analyzed, and an X-chromosome probe also showed no tumor DNA loss. We have demonstrated tumor-specific chromosome loss in a parathyroid adenoma; such a lesion has been described only rarely in benign tumors. Our finding adds to the evidence for monoclonality in parathyroid adenomatosis, indicates that only one PTH gene copy is sufficient for hyperparathyroid tumor function, and raises the possibility that a tumor-suppressor gene important in the development of nonfamilial parathyroid neoplasia is located on chromosome 11.\r"

This study was undertaken to determine the mechanism(s) responsible for bromocriptine resistance in patients with a PRL-secreting macroadenomas (n = 5) or microadenomas (n = 3). Their mean basal plasma PRL value was 807 +/- 220 (+/- SE) micrograms/L before treatment, and their nadir mean value was 354 +/- 129 micrograms/L during chronic therapy with 15-30 mg bromocriptine daily; four of the eight patients had an increase in tumor size during therapy. In cultures of prolactinoma cells from patients normally responsive to bromocriptine therapy (n = 10), considered as controls, 10(-9) mol/L bromocriptine inhibited PRL release by 71 +/- 6% (+/- SE), and the half-inhibitory dose was 7 x 10(-11) mol/L. In contrast, in cultures of prolactinoma cells from five patients resistant to bromocriptine, PRL release was inhibited by only 3-42% at 10(-9) mol/L bromocriptine. This partial inhibition was reversed by a 100-fold excess of haloperidol. In contrast, the effects of other inhibitors of PRL release (10(-8) mol/L T3 and 10(-8) mol/L somatostatin) or of a stimulator (10(-8) mol/L angiotensin-II) on cells from resistant and normally responsive patients were similar. In cell membranes from five bromocriptine-responsive adenomas the density of dopaminergic binding sites, labeled by [3H] spiroperidol was 243 +/- 65 (+/- SE) fmol/mg protein. In adenomas from the eight patients resistant to bromocriptine therapy the density of [3H]spiroperidol-binding sites lower (145 +/- 31 fmol/mg protein). In adenomas from five resistant patients whose tumor had grown during therapy the density of binding sites was 25 +/- 3 fmol/mg protein, 10% of that in normally responsive patients. The effects of dopamine on adenylate cyclase activity also were different in the three groups of adenomas. Dopamine inhibited adenylate cyclase activity by 28.8 +/- 5.6% in five bromocriptine-responsive tumors and by 16.5 +/- 4.3% in adenomas from eight resistant patients. In contrast, in the five patients whose tumors grew during therapy dopamine paradoxically stimulated adenylate cyclase activity (+26.4 +/- 9.8%). There was a very good correlation between the density of dopaminergic binding sites and maximal inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity in bromocriptine-responsive prolactinoma patients (r = 0.90) and resistant patients who had no tumor growth during therapy (r = 0.94).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We injected a highly purified preparation of the beta-core molecule, a fragment of hCG beta excreted in pregnancy urine, into five men and three women to determine its kinetic parameters, MCR, and urinary clearance. The beta-core molecule was distributed in an initial volume [1950 +/- 156 (mean +/- SEM) mL/m2 body surface area] approximately equal to the estimated plasma volume. Its disappearance was multiexponential on a semilogarithmic plot, with a rapid phase t1/2 of 3.5 +/- 0.7 min and a slow phase t1/2 of 22.4 +/- 4.2 min. The transit time (the mean time spent by a molecule of beta-core in transit) was 20.6 +/- 2.1 min. The MCR was 192.0 +/- 8.0 mL/min.m2 body surface area. About 5% of the injected dose of beta-core was excreted into the urine in the first 30 min after injection, and low levels of excretion persisted for up to 7 days. The urinary clearance rate of beta-core was 13.7 +/- 1.4 mL/min.m2, accounting for about 8% of the elimination of beta-core from the plasma. The beta-core immunoreactivity in serum and urine was characterized by gel filtration and three independent RIA systems to show that its properties were indistinguishable from those of the injected beta-core. Serum levels of beta-core in pregnant women were less than 0.2 ng/mL, while the amounts excreted in their urine were as much as 5 mg/day. Based on these clearance parameters of beta-core in normal subjects, less than 0.2% of the beta-core excreted in pregnancy urine is derived by urinary clearance of plasma beta-core. Therefore, more than 99% of the beta-core excreted in pregnancy urine is derived from beta-core in a compartment separate from plasma. In particular, these data indicate that there is relatively little placental secretion of beta-core into plasma and that placental secretion does not account for the vast majority of beta-core in pregnancy urine. These findings are consistent with previous data that point to renal parenchymal degradation of hCG and hCG beta as the major source of urinary beta-core in pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "Several groups of investigators have previously reported that small amounts of hCG are present in blood and urine of nonpregnant eugonadal women and men. We have developed highly sensitive and specific, two-monoclonal antibody, sandwich-type assays which can quantify both hCG and LH in sera from postmenopausal women, women at all phases of the menstrual cycle, and men. Using these assays we have also reported that hCG is secreted in a pulsatile fashion in postmenopausal women, is stimulated by GnRH in both men and postmenopausal women, and is suppressed by a GnRH agonist in castrate men. Employing these same sandwich assays, we report herein that hCG is secreted in a pulsatile manner during the follicular and luteal phases of the normal menstrual cycle. During the follicular phase 0.68 +/- 09 (+/- SEM) pulses of hCG occurred each hour, while 0.62 +/- 0.08 pulses of LH occurred. Pulse durations during the follicular phase for hCG and LH, respectively, were 38.3 +/- 4.4 and 62.5 +/- 11.1 min (P less than or equal to 0.05). During the luteal phase there were 0.42 +/- 0.16 pulses/h of hCG and 0.38 +/- 0.08 pulses of LH (P greater than 0.05). Pulse durations were 22.3 +/- 7.5 and 126.4 +/- 19.0 min for hCG and LH, respectively (P less than 0.01). The t1/2 of hCG disappearance was 37.2 +/- 3.8 min during the follicular phase and 22.9 +/- 4.6 min during the luteal phase. The t1/2 values of LH were 82.9 +/- 5.7 and 67.5 +/- 5.12 min during follicular and luteal phases, respectively. The t1/2 of LH was greater than the t1/2 of hCG (P less than 0.01). We conclude that small amounts of hCG are secreted in a pulsatile manner during follicular and luteal phases of the human menstrual cycle.\r"

In this study we used a specific T3 sulfate (T3S) RIA to address this question. Eight normal subjects were given oral T3 (1 microgram/day.kg BW) for 7 weeks. During the fifth week they also received propylthiouracil (PTU; four doses of 250 mg/day) for 2 days and during the seventh week iopanoic acid (IOP; 1 g/day) for 3 days. The mean pre-T3 serum iodothyronine values were: T4, 92 +/- 6 (+/- SE) nmol/L; rT3, 0.24 +/- 0.02 nmol/L; T3, 2.30 +/- 0.10 nmol/L; and T3S, less than 0.1 nmol/L (at or below the detection limit of the RIA). After 4 weeks of T3 administration the mean serum values were: T4, 39 +/- 6; rT3, 0.11 +/- 0.01; T3, 5.31 +/- 0.39; and T3S, 0.10 +/- 0.01 nmol/L. After 2 days of PTU administration, mean serum T4 increased to 48 +/- 7 (P less than 0.005), rT3 to 0.20 +/- 0.03 (P less than 0.025), and T3S to 0.13 +/- 0.01 nmol/L (P = NS), but serum T3 did not change (4.91 +/- 0.35 nmol/L). The effect of IOP was more pronounced; after its administration for 3 days the mean serum T4 was 49 +/- 8 (P less than 0.001), rT3 was 0.48 +/- 0.09 (P less than 0.005), and T3S was 0.29 +/- 0.04 nmol/L (P less than 0.005), and serum T3 decreased to 3.95 +/- 0.25 nmol/L (P less than 0.005). The T3S/T3 ratio was increased by PTU from 0.018 +/- 0.003 to 0.024 +/- 0.004 (P less than = NS) and by IOP to 0.055 +/- 0.007 (P less than 0.005). In conclusion, 1) serum T3S is virtually undetectable (less than 0.1 nmol/L) in normal subjects; 2) low serum T3S concentrations are detected in humans given T3; 3) serum T3S in T3-treated subjects is increased by inhibition of type I deiodinase activity with PTU and especially IOP; and 4) in comparison with previous estimates of the serum T3S/T3 ratio in rats, the low ratio in humans may indicate that sulfation is not an important mechanism of T3 metabolism in humans and/or the kinetics of plasma T3 and T3S differ in humans and rats.\r"

SMS (100 micrograms) or placebo was injected sc 45 min before a standard breakfast. Gallbladder volume (ultrasonography), plasma cholecystokinin (CCK), and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) were measured until 120 min after the meal. SMS completely suppressed the postprandial gallbladder contraction, despite a blunted, though still statistically significant, increase in plasma CCK from 1.6 +/- 0.2 pmol/L to an average of 3.7 +/- 1.7 pmol/L (P less than 0.01). The postprandial plasma PP peak after placebo was replaced by a slight but statistically significant decrease after SMS (P less than 0.05). A statistically significant correlation between the plasma CCK values and corresponding gallbladder volumes was seen only after placebo injection, not in the SMS study. We conclude that during long term treatment of acromegalics with SMS, an injection of 100 micrograms, sc, completely abolishes gallbladder contraction for at least 2 h after a standard breakfast, despite blunted, but still significant, CCK release. The data suggest a decreased sensitivity of the gallbladder to endogenous CCK during long term treatment with SMS. Careful control of patients with respect to the formation of gallstones is recommended.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the mechanisms subserving physiological alterations in circulating GH concentrations during puberty, we assessed the GH pulse characteristics of 60 24-h serum GH profiles obtained from healthy male volunteers of normal stature (aged 7-27 yr) whose physical development spanned the entire pubertal range. Subjects were divided into five study groups based on degree of sexual maturation. The mean 24-h concentration of GH was greater in late pubertal boys than in all other groups (P less than 0.001). This elevation primarily reflected a greater size, rather than number, of GH pulses, whether assessed as mean GH pulse area (P = 0.004 vs. all other groups), mean GH pulse amplitude (P = 0.001), or sum of the GH pulse areas (P less than 0.001). GH pulse frequency was indistinguishable among all groups (P greater than 0.05). However, circadian GH rhythms varied significantly in amplitude and mean values (but not in phase) throughout puberty. Plasma insulin-like growth factor-I levels were greatest in the late pubertal boys (1.98 +/- 0.15 U/mL) and remained elevated in the postpubertal group (1.44 +/- 0.18). The mean value for the adult men (0.74 +/- 0.06) was indistinguishable from that of prepubertal boys (0.90 +/- 0.13). In addition, all assessed characteristics of GH pulses and circadian rhythms in adults were equal to or less than corresponding values in prepubertal boys. We conclude that circulating GH concentrations transiently increase during mid- to late puberty in normal boys, primarily through augmentation of the size of GH pulses, but return to or below prepubertal levels during early adulthood.\r"

Eleven normal subjects received graded infusions of citrate or calcium on separate days to produce linear rates of decrease or increase in calcium. After discontinuation of the infusions, the return of calcium toward baseline was followed. Six subjects were given an infusion of citrate after the calcium infusion to speed the recovery of calcium toward baseline. Citrate-induced hypocalcemia produced a rise in serum PTH levels from 28.1 +/- 3.6 to 69.4 +/- 4.8 ng/L as calcium fell from 1.26 +/- 0.01 to 1.06 +/- 0.02 mmol/L. As calcium returned toward baseline, PTH levels fell dramatically, reaching levels indistinguishable from baseline despite persistent hypocalcemia. Slopes of regression lines defining the PTH-calcium relationships during decreasing and increasing calcium levels were significantly different. Those subjects receiving a calcium infusion alone showed a prompt suppression of PTH levels. As calcium returned toward baseline after the infusion, a modest decline in calcium produced no significant change in the PTH-calcium relationship. When citrate was used to return calcium to baseline, PTH levels rose from 7.8 +/- 2.0 to 55.0 +/- 6.8 ng/L as calcium fell from 1.42 +/- 0.02 to 1.26 +/- 0.02 mmol/L and defined a regression relationship significantly different from the period of increasing calcium. Thus, a hysteretic relationship between ionized calcium and levels of intact PTH can be induced in normal humans by reversing the direction of change in calcium. Therefore, the role played by calcium concentration per se in controlling PTH secretion may be part of more complex and dynamic regulatory mechanisms.\r"

Accordingly, we performed immunoblot analyses of cultured retroocular and pretibial fibroblasts. Retroocular connective tissue was obtained during orbital decompression surgery (n = 7) and at autopsy from normal individuals (n = 2). Pretibial skin biopsies were obtained from patients with pretibial dermopathy (n = 3) and at autopsy (n = 2). In addition, biopsies from other regions [extraocular muscle (n = 6), thyroid (n = 2), and abdominal skin (n = 3)] were also collected at surgery or autopsy. Serum samples were obtained from patients with severe Graves' ophthalmopathy (n = 31), hyperthyroid Graves' disease without overt ophthalmopathy (n = 13), nodular thyroid disease (n = 7), Hashimoto's thyroiditis (n = 7), rheumatoid arthritis (n = 5), and systemic lupus erythematosus (n = 3) and from normal individuals (n = 33). Electrophoresed fibroblast proteins were immunoblotted with 1:100 dilutions of sera using an antihuman immunoglobulin G-alkaline phosphatase conjugate. Antibodies against a 23kDa fibroblast protein were present in the sera from 24 of 44 (56%) of patients with Graves' disease with or without ophthalmopathy, 0 of 7 nodular thyroid disease, 0 of 7 Hashimoto's thyroiditis, 0 of 5 rheumatoid arthritis, 0 of 3 systemic lupus erythematosus, and 5 of 33 (15%) normal subjects. Significant differences in the observed frequency of antibodies existed between the Graves' disease group and the normal control group (P less than 0.01) or those patients with the other conditions (P less than 0.01). This 23kDa antigen was apparent in fibroblasts derived from individuals with Graves' disease as well as normal individuals and was present in fibroblasts from all anatomical sites studied. It was the sole protein uniquely recognized by sera from patients with Graves' disease. However, this serum reactivity did not appear to be related to the presence of clinically overt ophthalmopathy or pretibial dermopathy. Subcellular localization studies disclosed that the antigen was present in the supernatant but not the pellet resulting from a 100,000 x g centrifugation of whole cell sonicates. Antibodies against a 23kDa fibroblast protein are present in the majority of sera from patients with Graves' disease and rarely in sera from either normal individuals or those with other thyroid disorders or autoimmune diseases.

  ".W": "Systolic time intervals (STI) were measured directly from concurrent aortic and mitral valve echocardiographic tracings in 127 subjects to assess their utility as an index of peripheral tissue thyroid functional status. The subjects were categorized according to clinical symptoms and the results of thyroid function tests into the following 7 study groups: normal subjects (n = 34), overt hyperthyroid subgroup I (n = 12), overt hyperthyroid subgroup II (n = 28), subclinical hyperthyroid (n = 15), subclinical hypothyroid (n = 22), overt hypothyroid subgroup II (n = 6), and overt hypothyroidism subgroup I (n = 10). Compared with normal subjects, overt hyperthyroid subgroup I patients had a significantly shortened mean isovolumetric contraction time (ICT), preejection period (PEP), and PEP/LVET (LVET = left ventricular ejection time; P less than or equal to 0.0005); the overt hypothyroid subgroup I patients also had significantly lengthened mean ICT (P less than or equal to 0.005), PEP, and PEP/LVET (P less than or equal to 0.0005). Compared with normal subjects, overt hyperthyroidism subgroup II patients also had a very significant shortening of ICT (P less than 0.0005) as well as a significantly shortened PEP and PEP/LVET (P less than or equal to 0.005), whereas subclinical hyperthyroid patients (with normal serum free T4 index and total T3, and suppressed TSH by immunoradiometric assay) also had ICT, PEP, and PEP/LVET STI values which were significantly shortened (P less than 0.05) values. Compared to normal subjects, the overt hypothyroid subgroup II patients (who were clinically asymptomatic with reduced serum free T4 index and elevated TSH) had a prolongation of ICT, PEP, and PEP/LVET (P less than or equal to 0.05), whereas the values in subclinical hypothyroid patients were similar to those in normal subjects. From these observations we conclude that in the absence of underlying heart disease, the echocardiographic method used is a rapid, reliable, and sensitive technique for determining STI and provides direct information on peripheral tissue thyroid functional status.\r"

However, conflicting results have been reported as regards the function and mechanism of the action of IGF-I at the thyroid level. This study was designed to determine whether normal human thyroid cells have IGF-I receptors and whether IGF-I could act on such cells through an autocrine mechanism. Human thyroid follicular cells in primary culture, not contaminated by fibroblasts, were used. They had specific and saturable binding sites for IGF-I, as revealed by radiolabeled binding method, and displayed an average receptor number of 2000/cell. Under the same experimental conditions, insulin receptors were not detectable. Human thyroid follicular cells secreted IGF-I into the culture medium, as assessed by a specific chemiluminescent immunoassay. The IGF-I secretory process was detectable for at least 12 days of culture, but a high degree of variability has been found among individual samples. Acid-gel chromatography demonstrated that IGF-I and a higher mol wt IGF-I, most likely IGF-I bound to its binding protein, were secreted by human thyroid cells. TSH stimulated the secretion of the two molecules in normal human thyroid cells. The TSH effect on IGF-I secretion was concentration dependent between 0.1 nmol/L and 0.1 mumol/L. GH stimulated IGF-I synthesis by thyroid cells in a concentration range from 20-200 micrograms/mL. Since binding studies demonstrated the presence of IGF-I receptors on human thyroid cells, IGF-I probably regulates human thyroid function through an autocrine mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "It is well known that many hormones are secreted in a pulsatile fashion. Changes in pulse frequency and/or amplitude can have severe physiological and pathological consequences. Attempts to assess the short term secretion pattern of the pineal hormone melatonin (MLT) provided inconsistent results. The development of objective statistic- and computer-based pulse detection programs and the advent of more precise and specific MLT assay systems during recent years prompted us to reexamine the short term secretion of the pineal hormone. We investigated 16 healthy volunteers (8 males and 8 females), aged 28.1 +/- 6.7 yr (mean +/- SD). Five-milliliter blood specimens were collected at 10-min intervals from 1900-0900 h (n = 8), 3-min intervals from 2300-0300 h (n = 4), 10-min intervals from 0800-2200 h (n = 2), and 3-min intervals from 1100-1500 (n = 2). The serum MLT concentration in each specimen was measured with a previously described RIA. The sensitivity of the assay varied between 3.0-7.5 pg (0.013-0.033 pmol) MLT/tube. The intrassay variance was assessed on 10 serum pools to which varying amounts of MLT had been added, covering the entire range of the standard curve; the coefficient of variance varied between 16.6-6.1%. The sequence of MLT levels in each subject was examined for the existence of pulses by visual inspection and by the computer programs Pulsar and Cluster. Apart from the circadian rhythm, the three methods did not reveal clear pulses but, rather, continuous release of the pineal hormone during the day and night. We conclude that the pineal hormone MLT is, in contrast to many other hormones, secreted in an apulsatile manner. Very frequent blood sampling may be unnecessary for full characterization of the secretion pattern without loss of information. In addition to the circadian pacemaker, the pineal does not appear to be under the control of the proposed hypothalamic or an intrinsic pulse generator.\r"

It was concluded that this decrease in ACTH concentration was due to short loop ACTH autoregulation. The present study demonstrates that the decrease in ACTH concentration measured by IRMA was due to an artifact of the IRMA. We injected 250 micrograms ACTH-(1-24), iv, into five normal male volunteers after overnight 2.5-g metyrapone administration. The ACTH concentration measured by IRMA decreased from 59.6 +/- 9.7 pmol/L before to 4.8 +/- 2.0 pmol/L 1 min after ACTH-(1-24) injection. The ACTH concentration measured by IRMA increased thereafter in a mirror image of the decline in ACTH-(1-24) measured by RIA. Addition of ACTH-(1-24) to plasma in vitro resulted in a decrease in the ACTH concentration measured by IRMA which was of similar magnitude to that observed in vivo. ACTH-(1-24) infusion in vivo or addition to ACTH-(1-39)-containing plasma in vitro decreased ACTH-(1-39) measured by IRMA by binding to N- but not C-terminal antibody without forming a detectable sandwich complex. We conclude that although ACTH short loop feedback may exist, it cannot be detected after ACTH-(1-24) injection with the use of a two-site IRMA.\r"

Most patients with overt hyperthyroidism had undetectable TSH concentrations in the chemiluminescent assay. Three groups of patients were identified, in which a large subgroup had undetectable values in the immunoradiometric assay and detectable values in the chemiluminescent assay (12 of 17 patients under treatment for hyperthyroidism who had recently normalized their serum thyroid hormone levels, 33 of 68 patients taking L-T4, and 4 of 8 patients with endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism). In addition, several patients with undetectable basal and detectable TRH-stimulated TSH values in the immunoradiometric assay had detectable basal TSH values in the chemiluminescent assay. The utility of first generation TSH immunometric assays was their ability to distinguish hyperthyroidism from euthyroidism. The clinical utility of increasingly sensitive TSH assays will be to distinguish degrees of thyrotroph suppression in subclinical hyperthyroidism.\r"

Mature fat did not inhibit preadipocyte replication within the 6-d period studied. Preadipocyte differentiation, as assessed by both cytoplasmic lipid accretion and an increase in glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) activity, was significantly stimulated by the presence of mature fat tissue or isolated adipocytes. The proportion of cells containing visible lipid droplets by oil red O staining was 47 +/- 10 to 58 +/- 10% (depending on the site of origin of the preadipocytes) when cocultured with mature fat compared with less than 1 to 2 +/- 1% when cultured in medium alone, while GPDH activity was 344 +/- 9 compared with 43 +/- 3 nM NADH/min per mg protein, respectively. This effect was not due to release of triacylglycerols from damaged adipocytes. Fatty acids added to the medium promoted lipid accumulation but did not stimulate a rise in GPDH activity. We concluded that mature adipocytes may release factor(s) that promote preadipocyte differentiation (and maturation).\r"

FACS analysis of these cells preincubated in Hashimoto's serum revealed approximately 100-fold greater fluorescence compared with controls, indicating that recombinant TPO is expressed on the cell surface. Particulate antigen was extracted from these cells and studied by Western blot analysis using a panel of Hashimoto's sera of known antimicrosomal antibody (anti-MSA) titer. Under nonreducing conditions a broad, immunoreactive band of approximately 200 kD was observed, as well as a doublet of approximately 110 kD. All of the 36 Hashimoto's sera tested reacted with these bands, most in proportion to their anti-MSA titer. Six normal sera tested against this antigen(s) were nonreactive, as were the Hashimoto's sera tested against nontransfected CHO cells. Western blots under reducing conditions revealed a considerably diminished signal, with some of the sera of lower anti-MSA titer becoming negative, the loss of the 200-kD broad band, and the apparent conversion of the 110-kD doublet into a single band. Preincubation of cells in tunicamycin revealed no decrease in TPO immunoreactivity. In conclusion, we expressed enzymatically active human TPO in nonthyroidal eukaryotic cells. Our data prove that functionally active TPO is a major component of the thyroid microsomal antigen.\r"

  ".W": "Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is a potent vasopressor and antidiuretic neurohormone. However, when administered intravenously to humans, AVP causes forearm vasodilation. This effect has been attributed to sympathetic withdrawal, secondary to AVP-induced sensitization of baroreceptors. The possibility that AVP also causes forearm vasodilation directly has not been examined. Accordingly, the direct effect of AVP was determined by studying the forearm blood flow (FBF) response to intraarterial (IA) AVP infusion (0.01-1.0 ng/kg per min). Infusion of IA AVP increased FBF (96%) in the infused arm, but not the control arm, in a dose-dependent manner. The role of specific AVP V1 receptors in mediating this FBF response was determined before and after pretreatment with a V1 antagonist (AVP-A). AVP-A alone had no effect on FBF, but coadministration of AVP and AVP-A potentiated the vasodilatory response (223%). IA infusion of the V2 agonist, 1-desamino[8-D-arginine] vasopressin, caused a dose-dependent increase in FBF. These findings suggest that AVP causes direct, dose-dependent vasodilation in the human forearm that may be mediated by V2 vasopressinergic receptors. In contrast, AVP infusion caused digital vasoconstriction that was blocked by AVP-A, whereas dDAVP did not affect digital blood flow. Thus, AVP induces regionally selective vascular effects, with concurrent forearm vasodilation and digital vasoconstriction.\r"

  ".W": "The CD36 leukocyte differentiation antigen, recognized by MAbs OKM5 and OKM8 and found on human monocytes and endothelial cells, has been implicated as a sequestration receptor for erythrocytes infected with the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum (IRBC). CD36 is also expressed on platelets and appears to be identical to platelet glycoprotein IV. We investigated receptor activation of monocytes and platelets by anti-CD36 MAbs and by IRBC. Incubation of human monocytes with anti-CD36 MAbs or IRBC resulted in stimulation of the respiratory burst as measured by reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium and generation of chemiluminescence. Incubation of human platelets with anti-CD36 MAbs resulted in platelet activation as measured by aggregation or ATP secretion. Activation of monocytes and platelets required appropriate intracellular transmembrane signaling and was inhibited by calcium antagonists or by specific inhibitors of protein kinase C or guanine nucleotide binding proteins. Soluble CD36 inhibited binding of IRBC to both monocytes and platelets, suggesting that these interactions are mediated by the CD36 receptor. Using a cytochemical electron microscopic technique, the presence of reactive oxygen intermediates was identified at the interface between human monocytes and IRBC. These data provide support for the hypothesis that reactive oxygen intermediates produced by monocytes when IRBC ligands interact with cell surface receptors may play a role in the pathophysiology of falciparum malaria.\r"

  ".W": "TR- mutant rats have an autosomal recessive mutation that is expressed as a severely impaired hepatobiliary secretion of organic anions like bilirubin-(di)glucuronide and dibromosulphthalein (DBSP). In this paper, the hepatobiliary transport of glutathione and a glutathione conjugate was studied in normal Wistar rats and TR- rats. It was shown that glutathione is virtually absent from the bile of TR- rats. In the isolated, perfused liver the secretion of glutathione and the glutathione conjugate, dinitrophenyl-glutathione (GS-DNP), from hepatocyte to bile is severely impaired, whereas the sinusoidal secretion from liver to blood is not affected. The secretion of GS-DNP was also studied in isolated hepatocytes. The secretion of GS-DNP from cells isolated from TR- rat liver was significantly slower than from normal hepatocytes. Efflux of GS-DNP was a saturable process with respect to intracellular GS-DNP concentration: Vmax and Km for efflux from TR- cells was 498 nmol/min.g dry wt and 3.3 mM, respectively, as compared with 1514 nmol/min.g dry wt and 0.92 mM in normal hepatocytes. These results suggest that the canalicular transport system for glutathione and glutathione conjugates is severely impaired in TR- rats, whereas sinusoidal efflux is unaffected. Because the defect also comes to expression in isolated hepatocytes, efflux of GS-DNP from normal hepatocytes must predominantly be mediated by the canalicular transport mechanism, which is deficient in TR- rats.\r"

  ".W": "The binding of specific ligands to neutrophil cell surface receptors and the association of these receptors with the cytoskeleton may represent an essential step in activation. To identify surface proteins that are linked to the cytoskeleton during activation, neutrophil 125I-surface labeled plasma membranes were extracted with Triton X-100, and the soluble and insoluble (cytoskeleton) fractions analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The major cell surface proteins recruited to the cytoskeleton after activation with Con A, FMLP, zymosan-activated serum, or immune complexes possessed a relative molecular mass in the range of 80 to 13 kD. In addition to these proteins, WGA stimulates the recruitment of a 140-kD protein (GP 140) to the cytoskeletal fraction. That GP 140 is a WGA-binding protein was verified by Western blotting and WGA-Sepharose affinity chromatography. The Coomassie blue staining pattern of the WGA cytoskeletal fraction revealed major protein bands at apparent molecular weights of greater than 200 (approximately 250, 240, 235), 200, 115, 82/78 (a doublet), 56, 43, 36, and 18 kD. Labeling cells with 32PO4 before WGA treatment indicated that the cytoskeletal proteins with molecular weights of 115, 82/78, and 72 kD, and a 40-kD detergent soluble protein, are phosphorylated during activation. The 78 kD cytoskeletal phosphoprotein co-migrates with the lower subunit of erythrocyte (RBC) band 4.1 and shows strong cross-reactivity with RBC anti-band 4.1 antibody. Phosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins like 4.1 may be involved in the regulation of interactions between GP 140 and the actin-containing cytoskeleton. Unlike the C3bi receptor, GP 140 is a major surface component of unactivated PMNs, has no stoichiometrically related 95-kD subunit, and has two isoforms with pIs in the range of 6.4 to 6.6. Under conditions that result in an increased expression of the C3bi receptor (such as treatment with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187), the amount of GP 140 on the PMN cell surface appears to be significantly reduced. The interaction of GP 140 with the cytoskeleton during activation suggests that GP 140 may play an important role in neutrophil functional responses.\r"

The mutant allele is characterized by a 9.5-kb deletion extending from intron 15 to exon 18. Molecular cloning and sequencing of a cDNA segment corresponding to the deleted allele indicated that the mutant receptor differs radically from the normal one because of loss of the domains encoded by exons 16, 17, and 18. The carboxy-terminal portion of the normal receptor, comprising the amino acids 750-839, has been replaced by an unrelated stretch of 55 amino acids. The mutant allele was found to occur in 23 (50%) of 46 unrelated FH patients with an established functional defect in the LDL receptor. In cultured fibroblasts from the FH patients with the 9.5-kb deletion, both receptor-mediated binding and internalization of 125I-LDL were lower than normal, the former, on average, by 25%, and the latter, on average, by 50%. This combined functional defect probably results from both impaired attachment and impaired internalization of the mutated receptor. It remains to be investigated whether this Finnish type of LDL receptor gene mutation, here designated FH-Helsinki, occurs in other ethnic groups.\r"

Using a similar model in awake, closed-chest dogs, we tested the following hypotheses: (a) treadmill exercise promotes the development of cyclic flow variations in dogs with coronary stenoses and endothelial injury; (b) ventricular pacing does not induce cyclic flow variations in the same dogs; and (c) TXA2 and/or serotonin are important mediators of exercise-induced cyclic flow variations in this model. The surgical preparation consisted of the application of a hard, flow-limiting constrictor and a Doppler ultrasonic flow probe around the left coronary artery of 11 dogs. Treadmill exercise resulted in the prompt development of cyclic flow variations in all 11 dogs. Ventricular pacing at rates as high as 170 beats/min induced cyclic flow variations in only one of five dogs. Exercise-induced cyclic flow variations were abolished by TXA2 and/or serotonin receptor antagonists in all but one dog. Thus, (a) treadmill exercise promotes the development of cyclic flow variations in dogs with coronary stenoses and endothelial injury; (b) ventricular pacing does not induce cyclic flow variations in most dogs in the same model; and (c) TXA2 and/or serotonin are important mediators of cyclic flow variations in this model.\r"

When fed at the 20% level, fish oil reduced plasma LDL-cholesterol levels by 38% primarily by increasing LDL receptor activity in the liver. Dietary safflower oil also increased hepatic LDL receptor activity; however, since the rate of LDL production also increased, plasma LDL-cholesterol levels remained essentially unchanged. Hydrogenated coconut oil had no effect on LDL receptor activity but increased the rate of LDL-cholesterol production causing plasma LDL-cholesterol levels to increase 46%. Dietary fish oil had no effect on the receptor-dependent transport of asialofetuin by the liver, suggesting that the effect of fish oil on hepatic LDL receptor activity was specific and not due to a generalized alteration in the physical properties of hepatic membranes. Finally, dietary fish oil increased hepatic cholesteryl ester levels and suppressed hepatic cholesterol synthesis rates, suggesting that the up-regulation of hepatic LDL receptor activity in these animals was not simply a response to diminished cholesterol availability in the liver.\r"

Human mononuclear and platelet MCP is dimeric with molecular weights of 68,000 and 63,000 and is expressed in three phenotypic patterns. To further determine its tissue distribution, surface-labeled human fibroblast, epithelial, and endothelial cells and cell lines were assessed for the presence of MCP by iC3 affinity chromatography and by immunoprecipitation with a monospecific anti-MCP rabbit polyclonal antibody. All sources of adult and fetal fibroblast and epithelial cells and cell lines examined and umbilical vein endothelial cells expressed MCP. The molecular weight and phenotypic patterns of MCP were similar to those of peripheral blood cells. MCP was synthesized by fibroblast and epithelial cell lines. Solubilized extracts of these cell lines expressed factor I-dependent cofactor activity for the first cleavage of iC3/C3b which was abrogated by removal of MCP. Expression of MCP was modulated by SV40 transformation of two fetal fibroblast lines. There was a 5- to 10-fold increase in expression of MCP and a preferential expression of the lower species such that the phenotypic designation was changed. The wide tissue distribution and activity profile of MCP suggest that it is likely to play an important role in the regulation of the complement cascade.\r"

  ".W": "An adhesive interaction between activated platelets and mononuclear phagocytes may contribute to the role these cells play in regulating inflammation, thrombosis, and atherosclerosis. We have previously shown that this adhesive interaction is mediated by the expression of the glycoprotein thrombospondin (TSP) on the surface of activated platelets. We now show that TSP-dependent platelet-monocyte interactions are mediated by glycoprotein IV (GPIV), an intrinsic membrane protein recently identified as a cell surface TSP receptor. Monoclonal antibodies to GPIV bound to cells of the human monocytoid line U937 as assessed by flow cytometry and inhibited the binding of 125I-TSP to the cell surface by 83%. U937 cells preincubated with anti-GPIV were not rosetted by thrombin-stimulated platelets (72% inhibition compared with control anti-monocyte antibodies). In addition, when platelets were stimulated in the presence of saturating concentrations of monoclonal antibodies to GPIV, only 18% of U937 cells were rosetted (78% inhibition). Control antibodies including anti-GPIb did not inhibit rosette formation. These data suggest that TSP can cross-link platelets and monocytes via an interaction with GPIV on the surface of both cells. This molecular bridge may mediate platelet-macrophage communication in various pathophysiologic settings.\r"

We measured pulmonary vascular pressures, lung lymph flow, and concentrations of protein in lymph and plasma of 10 chronically catheterized preterm lambs (gestation 133 +/- 1 d) for 2-4 h before and for 4-8 h after delivery by cesarean section. All lambs were treated with mechanical ventilation after birth and received a constant intravenous infusion of glucose-saline solution at an hourly rate of 10 ml/kg. Respiratory failure developed in six lambs, in which there was a sustained threefold postnatal increase in lung lymph flow and lymph protein flow, with an even greater increase in pleural liquid drainage. Concentrations of protein in lymph and pleural liquid were almost identical, averaging approximately 75% of the plasma protein concentration. In the four preterm lambs without lung disease, lymph flow and lymph protein flow were either near or below fetal values by 6-8 h after birth, and there was little or no pleural liquid drainage. Extravascular lung water averaged 7.3 +/- .8 g/g dry lung in lambs with respiratory failure compared to 4.8 +/- .5 g/g dry lung in lambs without lung disease. Thus, pulmonary edema with abnormal leakage of protein-rich liquid from the lung microcirculation into the interstitium is an important pathological feature of the respiratory disease that often occurs after premature birth.\r"

During spontaneous breathing, MU that (a) were active during inspiration only (I-MU) and (b) were active during both inspiration and expiration (I/E-MU) were identified. I-MU had a later inspiratory onset time and a shorter duration of inspiratory firing than did I/E-MU (P less than 0.002 and P less than 0.0001, respectively). I-MU were usually quiescent whereas I/E-MU were usually active during the last 20% of inspiration. I/E-MU fired more rapidly (P less than 0.00001) and for relatively longer periods of time (P less than 0.00001) during inspiration than during expiration. End-expiratory airway occlusion (preventing lung expansion during inspiration) augmented the inspiratory activity of both I-MU and I/E-MU. Conversely, end-expiratory airway occlusion reduced the absolute and relative firing durations (P less than 0.002 and P less than 0.00002, respectively) and the firing frequency (P less than 0.001) of I/E-MU activity during expiration. These results indicate that (a) the complex pattern of pharyngeal dilator muscle activity is due to the integrated activity of a heterogeneous group of MU, (b) changes in the degree to which pharyngeal dilator muscles are active result from combinations of MU recruitment/decruitment and modulations of the frequency and duration of MU firing, and (c) gating of lung-volume afferent information occurs during the respiratory cycle.\r"

The rise in arterial pressure was associated with a 22 +/- 3.4% increase in systemic vascular resistance (P less than 0.01) and no change in cardiac output (-2.8 +/- 4.3%, P = NS). Plasma norepinephrine levels rose by 40 +/- 14% from 105 +/- 9 pg/ml (P less than 0.05) and epinephrine levels by 119 +/- 31% from 37 +/- 9 pg/ml (P less than 0.01). Right atrial infusion of adenosine produced insignificant hemodynamic effects, suggesting that systemic spillover of adenosine was not responsible for the observed effects. In 20 cardiac transplant patients with denervated hearts, LAD infusion of adenosine (2.2 mg/min) produced no change in systolic pressure (-0.1 +/- 1.6 mmHg from 139 +/- 3.4 mmHg, P = NS) and a decrement in diastolic pressure (-4.7 +/- 1.2 mmHg from 98 +/- 2.5 mmHg, P less than 0.01). Thus, infusion of adenosine into the LAD coronary artery causes a reflex increase in arterial pressure due to a rise in systemic vascular resistance, probably as a result of increased sympathetic discharge. This reflex pathway may be of importance in disease states such as myocardial ischemia, in which myocardial adenosine levels are elevated.\r"

Using monoclonal anti-DAF antibodies in conjunction with anti-smooth muscle cell (SMC)-specific myosin antibodies, it was found by immunohistochemistry that vascular SMC in advanced human carotid atherosclerotic lesions express DAF antigen. The percentage of DAF-positive SMC ranged from 20 to 60% between different patient samples and SMC DAF expression was limited to SMC in the lesion proper. Normal arterial wall SMC exhibited no DAF-specific immunostaining. Essentially 100% of passaged cultured vascular SMC derived from normal human uterine artery, or from umbilical vein, expressed DAF as assessed by immunocytochemistry. A 68-kD band was observed on SDS-PAGE autoradiograms of DAF-immunoprecipitated radiolabeled cultured SMC extracts. Sensitization of rabbit erythrocytes with DAF-containing SMC extracts conferred protection against complement-mediated hemolysis in normal human serum and the protective effect could be reversed by treatment with anti-DAF antibodies. We conclude that DAF is induced on vascular SMC during atherogenesis and in culture.\r"

A 48-h fast decreased total IGF-I mRNA levels by approximately 80% in lung and liver, approximately 60% in kidney and muscle, and only approximately 30-40% in stomach, brain, and testes. In heart, IGF-I mRNA levels did not change. The levels of the different splicing variants, however, were essentially coordinately regulated within a given tissue. Specific 125I-IGF-I binding in lung, testes, stomach, kidney, and heart was increased by fasting by approximately 30-100%, whereas in brain 125I-IGF-I binding did not change in response to fasting. In tissues in which fasting increased IGF-I receptor number, receptor mRNA levels increased approximately 1.6- to 2.5-fold, whereas when IGF-I receptor number was unchanged in response to fasting, receptor mRNA levels did not change. These data demonstrate that the change in IGF-I and IGF-I receptor mRNA levels during fasting is quantitatively different in different tissues and suggest that regulation of IGF-I and IGF-I receptor gene expression by fasting is discoordinate.\r"

  ".W": "The molecular basis of autoantibody reactivity with components of the SSA/Ro-SSB/La particle exhibited by sera of mothers of infants with severe and permanent manifestations of neonatal lupus (NLE) was investigated using immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. The characteristics of NLE that were studied included congenital complete heart block (CCHB), second degree heart block, and hepatic fibrosis. Antibodies specific for one or more components of the SSA/Ro-SSB/La particle were found in sera from all 20 mothers of permanently affected infants. However, no antibody specific for a single peptide of this particle was common to all sera. Using tissue extracts from a human cell substrate, 80% of these sera had antibodies to one or more components of the SSA/Ro particle demonstrable by immunoblotting. The predominant antibody response in the NLE group was to the newly recognized 52-kD SSA/Ro peptide component. In contrast, antibodies to the 60-kD SSA/Ro component although present, were the least represented and not significantly increased in frequency among mothers of these infants, compared with a group of 31 mothers with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythromatosus (SLE) but who had healthy offspring. Antibodies directed to the 48-kD SSB/La antigen were demonstrated in 90% of the NLE mothers often accompanying antibodies against the 52-kD SSA/Ro component. The combination of antibodies to 48- and 52-kD structures was significantly increased in the NLE group, with an odds ratio of 35. The type of cell or tissue substrate was shown to influence detectability of antibodies. The 52-kD SSA/Ro peptide and the 48-kD SSB/La peptide were abundant in cardiac tissues from fetuses aged 18-24 wk, further supporting the possible relevance of these peptides to heart block.\r"

The proband, a 9-yr-old boy with a plasma cholesterol value greater than 500 mg/dl, is homozygous for a point mutation that changes Ser156 to Leu in the LDL receptor. This substitution in the fourth repeat of the ligand binding domain slows the transport of the protein to the cell surface. The defective receptor cannot bind LDL, which contains apo B-100, but it does bind beta-migrating VLDL, which contains apo E in addition to apo B-100. Although the mother is heterozygous for this mutation, her LDL-cholesterol concentration is consistently in the 28th percentile for the population. Through direct examination of genomic DNA, we identified the mutant gene in heterozygous form in 17 of the mother's relatives, five of whom had normal LDL-cholesterol values. The pedigree was consistent with dominant transmission of a single gene that ameliorates or suppresses the hypercholesterolemic effect of the LDL receptor mutation. Through linkage analysis, we excluded the possibility that this suppressor gene was an allele at the LDL receptor locus. We also excluded the genes for the two ligands for the LDL receptor, apo B-100 and apo E. The existence of this putative suppressor gene may explain the occasional observation of normal LDL-cholesterol concentrations in heterozygotes for LDL receptor mutations.\r"

Acid and neutral metalloproteinases and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) were extracted with 2 M guanidine. Methods were developed to selectively destroy either proteinases or TIMP to prevent cross-reaction during assay. Acid and neutral proteinases were elevated approximately 150% in OA; TIMP was elevated approximately 50%. A positive correlation (r = 0.50) was found between acid and neutral proteinase activities in OA, but not in controls. Both proteinases were elevated two-to threefold in zones A, B, and C. However, the self-active form of the acid metalloproteinase was elevated only in zones A and B (200%); it correlated well with the Mankin scores, whereas the total activities did not. TIMP was elevated (50%) only in zones A and B. Both the proteinase levels and the Mankin score were elevated to a greater extent in the medial, than in the lateral, compartment. Titration of TIMP against the two metalloproteinases indicates that there is a small excess of inhibitor over enzymes in normal cartilage. In OA, TIMP does not increase to the same extent as the proteinases; the resultant excess of proteinases over TIMP may contribute to cartilage breakdown.\r"

Recently we isolated a heavy chain V (Vh) gene, designated Humhv3005, that is 99% homologous to the 1.9III Vh gene and can encode an anti-DNA antibody. To study the relation between these two genes, different DNA fragments from the isolated Humhv3005 clone were used to probe Southern blots of human genomic DNA. A 1.6-kb Eco RI fragment (designated hv3005/E1.6) was found to hybridize with only one band in Eco RI-digested DNA, and with two major bands in Bam HI-digested DNA. Importantly, the sizes of the latter two bands were indistinguishable from the corresponding Bam HI fragment sizes of the isolated hv3005 clone and the isolated 1.9III clone, respectively. Population and family studies with the hv3005/E1.6 probe revealed five different hybridization patterns of these two characteristic bands, which defined nine possible genotypes for two human Ig Vh gene loci. Together the data demonstrate that hv3005/E1.6 is a highly informative probe for an autoantibody-associated Vh gene(s), and should prove useful in elucidating the role of Ig Vh genes in autoimmune diseases.\r"

During a 4-d fast mean blood glucose declined by 48 mg/dl; proinsulin mRNA signal density remained normal while proglucagon mRNA signal density more than doubled. At the end of a continuous 12-d insulin infusion blood glucose averaged 53 +/- 12 mg/dl; proinsulin mRNA signal density declined to 30% of controls while proglucagon mRNA signal density more than doubled. In insulinoma-bearing NEDH rats blood glucose averaged 34 +/- 3.5 mg/dl; the proinsulin mRNA signal was virtually undetectable and proglucagon mRNA signal density was more than twice the controls. There was no detectable change in either beta-cell area or islet number in rats subjected to fasting or insulin infusion, but in insulinoma-bearing rats beta cell area was markedly reduced. Thus compensation during 4 d of starvation involves an increase in glucagon gene expression without change in insulin gene expression or beta cell mass. In moderate insulin-induced hypoglycemia glucagon gene expression is increased and insulin gene expression decreased. In more profound insulinoma-induced hypoglycemia, in addition to the foregoing changes in hormone gene expression, there is a profound reduction in the number of insulin-expressing cells.\r"

The two forms have similar binding characteristics for folates, are immunologically cross-reactive and based upon limited amino acid sequence data, are nearly identical. Based upon pulse-chase experiments, a precursor-product relationship has been suggested. The membrane form has been shown to mediate the transport of folate in cells grown in physiological concentrations of folate. A function for the soluble form has not yet been identified. We constructed a cDNA library from a human carcinoma cell line, Caco-2, which expresses the membrane form abundantly. The library was screened and a near full-length cDNA for the folate binder was isolated. Transfection of COS cells with the cDNA inserted in an expression vector resulted in marked overexpression of a membrane-associated folate binder as assessed by direct binding of radiolabeled folate and by indirect immunofluorescence. The deduced amino acid sequence is not consistent with a typical membrane spanning domain but rather with a signal for anchoring via a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol linkage. Release of the binder with a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C strongly supports this hypothesis.\r"

The final marker, D4S125, represents a recently discovered VNTR locus. All four loci map closer to the HD gene and to the telomere than D4S10, the original linked marker for HD. In combination with two multiallele RFLPs previously identified for D4S43 and another linked locus, D4S95, these five new multiallele markers will dramatically improve the speed and accuracy of predictive testing in HD, and increase its applicability by maximizing the chances of an informative test for anyone with appropriate family structure.\r"

  ".W": "Transforming growth factor alpha (TGF alpha) shares with epidermal growth factor (EGF) structural homology (35%), a common cell-surface membrane receptor (TGF alpha/EGF receptor), and a nearly identical spectrum of biological activity, including inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Herein, we report expression of TGF alpha mRNA in normal gastric mucosa of the adult guinea pig, rat, and dog. TGF alpha mRNA was also detected in matched surgically resected gastric mucosa and adjacent gastric carcinoma from 10 patients, and in gastric mucosa adjacent to a benign ulcer from an additional patient. TGF alpha protein was quantitated by radioimmunoassay and was present in tumor and adjacent mucosa. TGF alpha/EGF receptor mRNA was also detected in gastric mucosa from all species studied. Localization of TGF alpha and TGF alpha/EGF receptor mRNA expression was examined in samples of unfractionated guinea pig gastric mucosa and from chief cell-enriched and parietal cell-enriched fractions. All samples exhibited TGF alpha and TGF alpha/EGF receptor expression. The TGF alpha signal was greatest in the parietal cell fraction (5.8-fold increase), but was also enhanced in the chief cell fraction (1.9-fold increase) relative to the unfractionated gastric mucosa. Like TGF alpha expression, TGF alpha/EGF receptor mRNA expression was most intense in the parietal cell-enriched fraction (7.8-fold increase), but was also increased in the chief cell-enriched fraction (2.7-fold increase) relative to the unfractionated guinea pig gastric mucosa. We conclude that TGF alpha and TGF alpha/EGF receptor genes are expressed in normal adult mammalian gastric mucosa. These findings, when interpreted in light of described actions of TGF alpha and EGF, provide evidence that local production of TGF alpha could play an important role in the regulation of acid secretion and mucosal renewal in the stomach.\r"

Cytogenetic and carrier studies revealed structurally normal chromosomes for this patient and her parents and demonstrated that this mutation arose through a de novo gametic event. Comparison of this patient's DNA with the DNA of her parents revealed that a microdeletion, which occurred within a maternal gamete and involved the entire HPRT gene, was partially responsible for the disease in this patient. Somatic cell hybrids, generated to separate maternal and paternal X chromosomes, showed that expression of two additional X-linked enzymes, phosphoglycerate kinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, were expressed only in cells that contained the maternal X chromosome, suggesting the presence of a functionally inactive paternal X chromosome. Furthermore, comparison of methylation patterns within a region of the HPRT gene known to be important in gene regulation revealed differences between DNA from the father and the patient, in keeping with an active HPRT locus in the father and an inactive HPRT locus in the patient. Together these data indicate that nonrandom inactivation of the cytogenetically normal paternal X chromosome and a microdeletion of the HPRT gene on an active maternal X chromosome were responsible for the absence of HPRT in this patient.\r"

Platelets and monocyte/macrophages accumulate at these sites and release a variety of growth factors that are thought to initiate and sustain the repair. Often the involved tissue contracts, a process that can markedly reduce the amount of fibroplasia and angiogenesis necessary for the reestablishment of organ integrity. Such tissue contraction occurs over hours or days, a much slower time course than the rapid, reversible contraction of muscle tissue. Fibroblasts, which are rich in f-actin bundles, appear to be responsible for wound contraction. However, the signals that stimulate contraction are not known. Using cultured fibroblasts, which are also rich in f-actin bundles, we demonstrate the platelet and monocyte isoforms of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF; AB and BB) but not PDGF-AA, can stimulate fibroblasts to contract collagen matrix in a time course similar to that of wound contraction. In addition, PDGF appears to be the predominant fibroblast/collagen gel contraction activity released from platelets. Vasoactive agonists known to stimulate smooth and striated muscle contraction do not stimulate fibroblast-driven collagen gel contraction.\r"

This compound has been used to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with renal failure, but in some patients prolonged treatment with 1,25-(OH)2D3 results in hypercalcemia. An analogue of 1,25-(OH)2D3 with little or no calcemic activity, 22-oxacalcitriol (OCT), was recently developed. We confirmed this lack of calcemic activity by acute and chronic administration to normal rats. A single intraperitoneal injection of vehicle (propylene glycol), OCT, or 1,25-(OH)2D3 (1.0 micrograms/rat) increased calcium by 0.32, 0.30, and 1.40 mg/dl, respectively. When rats were given daily injections of vehicle or 0.5 micrograms of either 1,25-(OH)2D3 or OCT for 4 d, calcium did not change in the rats receiving vehicle or OCT, but increased from 8.4 to 11.4 mg/dl in the rats treated with 1,25-(OH)2D3. In primary cultures of bovine parathyroid cells, 10 nM OCT was as active as 10 nM 1,25-(OH)2D3, suppressing PTH release by 33%. This suppression is due, at least in part, to blocking of transcription of the PTH gene. Using a probe prepared by random prime labeling of an Msp I fragment of plasmid PTHm122, we found that a single 40-ng dose of OCT or 1,25-(OH)2D3 depressed PTH mRNA levels by 70-80% by 48 h when compared with vehicle. Thus, OCT is a very effective suppressor of PTH secretion with virtually no calcemic activity. This analogue may be a valuable tool for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism.\r"

The activation of such clones was studied after mice were immunized with GT in CFA, HP20 (an anti-Id MAb carrying the internal image of GT in the D region), and a synthetic peptide corresponding to the D segment of HP20. Our results indicate that immunized mice produced both GT- and self-reactive antibodies. Study of the immunochemical properties of MAb showed that they exhibit multispecific properties and bind with similar-affinity constants to GT or self-antigens such as DNA, Smith antigen (Sm), and IgG2a. An important fraction of antibodies obtained from MRL/lpr mice immunized with HP20 expressed pGAT IdX and some of these antibodies share IdX expressed on anti-DNA, Sm, and rheumatoid factor (RFs) antibodies. The hybridomas producing multispecific autoantibodies use heavy-chain- (VH) and light-chain-variable region (VK) genes from various V gene families, suggesting that they do not derive from the pool of GAT precursors. Sequencing of VH and VK genes of two antibodies show that they can use closely related VHJ558, unmutated VK1, or different VK genes than those used by anti-GT antibodies. Our data demonstrate that clones producing antibodies binding to GT and self-antigens with similar-affinity constants can be activated by foreign or anti-Id antibodies carrying the internal image of the antigen or even by a synthetic peptide corresponding to the D segment of anti-Id antibodies.\r"

Xanthine oxidase (0.003 and 0.012 U/ml) caused lung edema that was attenuated by coinfusion of washed human platelets. Platelets that were incubated with DEA to inhibit G-6-PD activity augmented xanthine oxidase-induced lung edema and pulmonary hypertension at both doses of xanthine oxidase. Infusion of papaverine to maintain stable pulmonary artery (PA) pressures, incubation of G-6-PD-inhibited platelets with acetylsalicylate, or infusion of a thromboxane-prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor site antagonist, SQ 29548, into the lung perfusate prevented augmentation of lung edema and the PA pressor response by G-6-PD-inhibited platelets. It was concluded that antioxidant-intact platelets attenuate oxidant-induced lung edema by preventing increased membrane permeability, and that G-6-PD-inhibited platelets augment lung edema through hydrostatic mechanisms mediated by release of platelet cyclooxygenase products.\r"

  ".W": "Because metabolic acids stimulate bone resorption in vitro and in vivo, we focused on the cellular events produced by acidosis that might be associated with stimulation of bone remodeling. To this end, we exposed isolated chicken osteoclasts to a metabolic (butyric) acid and observed a fall in both intracellular pH and cytosolic calcium [( Ca2+]i). These phenomena were recapitulated when bone resorptive cells, alkalinized by HCO3 loading, were transferred to a bicarbonate-free environment. The acid-induced decline in osteoclast [Ca2+]i was blocked by either NaCN or Na3VO4, in a Na+-independent fashion, despite the failure of each inhibitor to alter stimulated intracellular acidification. Moreover, K+-induced membrane depolarization also reduced cytosolic calcium in a manner additive to the effect of protons. These findings suggest that osteoclasts adherent to bone lack functional voltage-operated Ca2+ channels, and they reduced [Ca2+]i in response to protons via a membrane residing Ca-ATPase. Most importantly, acidosis enhances formation of podosomes, the contact areas of the osteoclast clear zone, indicating increased adhesion to substrate, an early step in bone resorption. Thus, extracellular acidification of osteoclasts leads to decrements in intracellular pH and calcium, and appears to promote cell-matrix attachment.\r"

Substance P (10(-16) M) increased coughing compared with its vehicle. Enkephalinase (120 micrograms) inhibited cough induced by subsequent exposure to substance P compared with the response to substance P alone, but after further exposure to the enkephalinase inhibitor leucine-thiorphan (10(-5) M), substance P increased cough significantly. Similar results were obtained for capsaicin-induced cough. In pathogen-free guinea pigs, after they inhaled inactive recombinant enkephalinase (33 micrograms), capsaicin (10(-13) M) increased cough significantly. In contrast, after they inhaled active recombinant enkephalinase (33 micrograms), capsaicin increased cough only slightly. These results suggest that aerosolized enkephalinase reaches the sites of release or actions of endogenous neuropeptides and, by degrading them, prevents cough induced by their release. Furthermore, these studies suggest that recombinant enkephalinase might be useful in the treatment of cough and other symptoms of diseases involving peptides cleaved by this enzyme.\r"

The fractional catabolic rate (FCR) of autologous 125I-LDL was calculated both from elimination curves of plasma radioactivity and from urine/plasma (U/P) radioactivity ratios. Within 1-2 d of onset of estrogen therapy a more rapid decay of plasma radioactivity occurred, and FCR measured from U/P ratios increased by 20%. Concomitantly, LDL cholesterol levels decreased by 16%. After 3-6 mo of treatment FCR determined by both techniques was almost doubled, and LDL cholesterol was reduced by 34%. This occurred despite a 29% increase in the calculated synthesis rate of LDL. Tissue culture studies demonstrated that the receptor affinity of LDL isolated from patients on long-term estrogen therapy was reduced. We conclude that a profound increase in LDL catabolism is induced through administration of pharmacological doses of estrogen in males, and hypothesize that this is the consequence of an increased expression of hepatic LDL receptors. This enhanced catabolism of LDL leaves LDL particles in plasma with lower affinity for the LDL receptor.\r"

According to gallbladder ultrasonography, after 1 yr new gallstones had developed in 5 of 28 estrogen-treated patients, compared with 0 of 26 orchidectomized patients (P = 0.03). Estrogen therapy for 3 mo increased the relative concentration of cholesterol and cholesterol saturation of bile by approximately 30% (n = 10). Serum LDL cholesterol was reduced by approximately 40%, and its relative change related inversely to that of bile cholesterol (Rs = -0.77). There were no changes in biliary or serum lipids after orchidectomy (n = 9). Secretion rates of biliary lipids were measured with a duodenal perfusion technique. Patients on chronic estrogen therapy (n = 5) had approximately 40% higher biliary excretion rates of cholesterol than age-matched controls (n = 7). Phospholipid secretion was also higher, but no difference in bile acid secretion was found. We conclude that an increased hepatic secretion of cholesterol results in increased cholesterol saturation of bile and an enhanced rate of gallstone formation during estrogen treatment. The changes in bile cholesterol seem to be related to the induced changes in serum lipoprotein metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "To examine mechanisms whereby the abundance of functional Ca channels may be regulated in excitable tissue, Ca channel number was estimated by binding of the dihydropyridine (DHP) antagonist 3H (+)PN200-110 to monolayers of intact myocytes from chick embryo ventricle. Beta adrenergic receptor properties were studied in cultured myocytes using [3H]CGP12177, an antagonist ligand. Physiological correlates for alterations in DHP binding site number included 45Ca uptake and contractile response to (+)BAYk 8644, a specific L-type Ca channel activator. All binding and physiological determinations were performed in similar intact cell preparations under identical conditions. 4-h exposure to 1 microM isoproterenol reduced cell surface beta-adrenergic receptor number from 44 +/- 3 to 17 +/- 2 fmol/mg (P less than 0.05); DHP binding sites declined in number from 113 +/- 25 to 73 +/- 30 fmol/mg (P less than 0.03). When protein kinase A was activated by a non-receptor-dependent mechanism, DHP binding declined similarly to 68% of control. Exposure to diltiazem, a Ca channel antagonist, for 18-24 h had no effect on number of DHP binding sites. After 4-h isoproterenol exposure, 45Ca uptake stimulated by BAYk 8644 declined from 3.3 +/- 0.2 nmol/mg to 2.9 +/- 0.3 nmol/mg (P less than 0.01) and BAYk 8644-stimulated increase in amplitude of contraction declined from 168 +/- 7 to 134 +/- 11% (P = 0.02). Thus, elevation of [cAMP] in myocytes is associated with a time-dependent decline in Ca channel abundance as estimated by DHP binding and a decline in physiological responses that are in part dependent on abundance of Ca channels. Binding of a directly acting Ca channel antagonist for 18-24 h does not modulate the number of DHP binding sites.\r"

RNA encoding the type I IGF receptor, the receptor thought to mediate the mitogenic effects of IGF-I and IGF-II, also was uniformly expressed in these cells. To assess the role of IGF-II in the growth of these tumor cells, we have used the SK-N-AS cultured neuroblastoma cell line, which can be continuously propagated in mitogen-free medium, as a model system. Our results strongly suggest that IGF-II, synthesized by SK-N-AS cells and acting through type I IGF receptors, contributes to the autonomous growth of this tumor cell line. (a) SK-N-AS cells synthesized large amounts of IGF-II RNA and secreted greater than 50 ng/ml of IGF-II (as determined by specific radioimmuno- and radioreceptor assays). Little, if any, IGF-I RNA or immunoreactive IGF-I were detected. (b) SK-N-AS cells possess type I IGF receptors. (c) Exogenous IGF-I and IGF-II stimulated DNA synthesis in SK-N-AS cells, and this stimulation was abolished by a blocking antibody to the type I IGF receptor. (d) This anti-receptor antibody also abolished the multiplication of SK-N-AS cells in the absence of added mitogens. We conclude that IGF-II is an autocrine growth factor for SK-N-AS cells and suggest that this mechanism may contribute to the growth of some adrenal medullary tumors.\r"

We studied the specific effects of AII on AII binding in rat mesenteric artery vascular smooth muscle cells in culture. Incubation with unlabeled AII at 21 degrees C resulted in time- and concentration-dependent decreases in AII surface binding at 4 degrees C, with a 30% reduction after exposure to 300 nM AII for 15 min. Reductions in cell surface binding were due to decrements in receptor number rather than changes in binding affinity. Loss of surface receptors was mediated by receptor internalization as maneuvers that blocked ligand internalization (cold temperature and phenylarsine oxide [PAO]) attenuated AII-induced loss of surface receptors. After removal of AII, recovery of surface binding was rapid (t1/2 = 15 min) and was mediated by reinsertion of a preexisting pool of receptors into the surface membrane rather than by new receptor synthesis. To determine the role of receptor cycling on AII-induced surface receptor loss, cells were incubated with the endosomal inhibitor chloroquine during exposure to AII at 21 degrees C. Incubation with AII plus chloroquine resulted in a 70% greater loss of surface binding than after incubation with AII alone. To determine the role of receptor cycling on uptake of ligand, cells were incubated with PAO or endosomal inhibitors during exposure to AII at 4 and 21 degrees C. Compared with buffer these agents did not alter AII uptake at 4 degrees C, but decreased uptake by 12-50% at 21 degrees C. These results indicate that after binding AII receptors cycle and that receptor cycling attenuates AII-induced losses of surface receptors and enhances ligand uptake by providing a continuous source of receptors to the cell surface.\r"

The anti-LDL receptor antibody used was shown to be monospecific and did not react with striated muscle, a tissue which has a very low level of LDL receptors. Similarly, cerebral cortex showed only faint reactivity and that was to an area previously demonstrated to have LDL receptors. Adrenal gland was intensely reactive with the zona fasciculata, having a greater density of receptors than the zona reticularis. In normal liver, LDL receptors were present on the sinusoidal membranes and were sparse in the areas of hepatocyte-to-hepatocyte contact without an obvious portal to central gradient. LDL receptors were present throughout the intestine. In jejunum, staining was most intense at the base of the villus and extended up toward the villus tip. At the base of the villus, the receptor was primarily at the basal lateral membrane, but toward the villus tip, there was appreciable intracellular staining. Staining in crypts was more faint; in duodenum, staining in crypts equaled that in the villus region in intensity. In colon, there was intense staining throughout the epithelial cells. These results provide new information about the cellular and subcellular localization of LDL receptors and raise the interesting possibility that there is a role for LDL-derived cholesterol in new lipoprotein formation.\r"

Basolateral (blLPM) and canalicular (cLPM) liver plasma membrane vesicles were purified to the same degree from normal and cholestatic rat livers and the membrane bound cBSTP identified and quantitated using polyclonal anti-cBSTP antibodies. Cholestasis of 50 h resulted in an increased release of cBSTP into bile, thereby decreasing its in vivo half-life from 65 to 25 h. Furthermore, a significant portion of cBSTP accumulated at the basolateral surface and in intracellular vesicles of cholestatic hepatocytes. This redistribution of cBSTP was functionally paralleled by decreased and increased electrogenic taurocholate anion transport in cLPM and blLPM vesicles, respectively. These results demonstrate that biliary obstruction causes a reversal of the bile salt secretory polarity of rat hepatocytes. The resulting increase in basolateral (sinusoidal) bile salt efflux might protect hepatocytes from too high an accumulation of toxic bile salts within the cell interior.\r"

Pertussis toxin only marginally affected phagocytosis of IgG- and C3bi-opsonized particles and the associated formation of second messengers. Forskolin, which induced a threefold rise of cellular cAMP, however, markedly inhibited both C3bi- and IgG-mediated phagocytosis as well as the particle-induced formation of inositol phosphates and diacylglycerol. These observations are in contrast to what was found to occur with chemotactic factors and indicate that chemotactic and phagocytic signaling can be regulated independently in human neutrophils. Since C3bi-mediated phagocytosis has been shown to occur at vanishingly low cytosolic free calcium levels, calcium-depleted cells were used to study the importance of the inositol cycle for the engulfment of C3bi-opsonized particles. Despite a total lack of receptor-induced formation of inositol phosphates, a significantly increased accumulation of diacylglycerol accompanied the ingestion of C3bi-opsonized particles. These data show that the engulfment of C3bi-opsonized particles can occur independently of both a calcium transient and an increased inositol phosphate production. However, the observed accumulation of diacylglycerol, not derived from phosphoinositides, suggests that this second messenger play a role in the control of the engulfment process.\r"

After exposure to air or to cigarette smoke we measured the change in total pulmonary resistance (RL) induced by increasing concentrations of aerosolized substance P in the absence or presence of the NEP inhibitor phosphoramidon. In the absence of phosphramidon the bronchoconstrictor responses to substance P were greater in cigarette smoke-exposed guinea pigs than in air-exposed animals. Phosphoramidon did not further potentiate the responses to substance P in smoke-exposed guinea pigs, whereas it did so in air-exposed animals. In the presence of phosphoramidon, bronchoconstrictor responses to substance P in animals exposed to air or to cigarette smoke were not different. Aerosols of SOD delivered before cigarette smoke exposures dramatically reduced smoke-induced hyperresponsiveness to substance P, whereas heat-inactivated SOD had no effect on smoke-induced hyper-responsiveness to substance P. Cigarette smoke solution inhibited NEP activity from tracheal homogenate in a concentration-dependent fashion, an inhibitory effect that was mostly due to the gas phase of the smoke, but not to nicotine. The mild chemical oxidant N-chlorosuccinimide mimicked the concentration-dependent inhibitory effect of smoke solution on airway NEP activity. We conclude that cigarette smoke causes enhanced airway responsiveness to substance P in vivo by inactivating airway NEP. We suggest that cigarette smoke-induced inhibition of airway NEP is due to effects of free radicals.\r"

Collagen and protein contents per cell were low in the callus tissues and collagen I and III were overmodified as evidenced by an elevated level of hydroxylysine. The degree of lysyl hydroxylation was highest in those regions that appeared most immature by histological examination. Lysyl hydroxylation approached normal levels in collagen from the stationary callus and from the center of the growing callus. Overmodification of collagen was not seen in compact bone or cell cultures (neither skin fibroblasts nor callus cells) from the patient. Elevation of hydroxylysine in collagen from OI patients is generally attributed to mutations that delay triple helix formation. Our observations suggest that the varying degree of collagen modifications may occur in consequence of regulatory mechanisms during bone development and tissue repair. These mechanisms may be defective in some patients with OI as seen in this case with hyperplastic callus formation.\r"

Physiologic and morphometric techniques were used serially before, and 12 and 36 mo post-TLI to characterize the course of glomerular injury. Judged by a progressive reduction in the density of glomerular cells and immune deposits, glomerular inflammation subsided. A sustained reduction in the fractional clearance of albumin, IgG and uncharged dextrans of radius greater than 50 A, pointed to a parallel improvement in glomerular barrier size-selectivity. Corresponding changes in GFR were modest, however. A trend towards higher GFR at 12 mo was associated with a marked increase in the fraction of glomerular tuft area occupied by patent capillary loops as inflammatory changes receded. A late trend toward declining GFR beyond 12 mo was associated with progressive glomerulosclerosis, which affected 57% of all glomeruli globally by 36 mo post-TLI. Judged by a parallel increase in volume by 59%, remaining, patent glomeruli had undergone a process of adaptive enlargement. We propose that an increasing fraction of glomeruli continues to undergo progressive sclerosis after DPLN has become quiescent, and that the prevailing GFR depends on the extent to which hypertrophied remnant glomeruli can compensate for the ensuing loss of filtration surface area.\r"

  ".W": "Using continuous microperfusion techniques, we studied the load dependence of bicarbonate reabsorption along cortical distal tubules of the rat kidney and their bicarbonate permeability. Net bicarbonate transport was evaluated from changes in tracer inulin concentrations and total CO2 measurements by microcalorimetry. Bicarbonate permeability was estimated from the flux of total CO2 along known electrochemical gradients into bicarbonate-and chloride-free perfusion solution containing 10(-4) M acetazolamide. Transepithelial potential differences were measured with conventional glass microelectrodes. Significant net bicarbonate reabsorption occurred at luminal bicarbonate levels from 5 to 25 mM, and at perfusion rates from 5 to 30 nl/min. Bicarbonate reabsorption increased in a load-dependent manner, both during increments in luminal bicarbonate concentration or perfusion rate, reaching saturation at a load of 250 pmol/min with a maximal reabsorption rate of approximately 75 pmol/min.mm. Rate of bicarbonate reabsorption was flow dependent at luminal concentrations of 10 but not at 25 mM. During chronic metabolic alkalosis, maximal rates of reabsorption were significantly reduced to 33 pmol/min.mm. The bicarbonate permeability was 2.32 +/- 0.13 x 10(-5) cm/s in control rats, and 2.65 +/- 0.26 x 10(-5) cm/s in volume-expanded rats. Our data indicate that at physiological bicarbonate concentrations in the distal tubule passive bicarbonate fluxes account for only 16-21% of net fluxes. At high luminal bicarbonate concentrations, passive bicarbonate reabsorption contributes moderately to net reabsorption of this anion.\r"

  ".W": "Since platelet hemostatic functions are mediated in part through the binding of adhesive proteins containing an RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) recognition sequence, and since platelet reactions may be inhibited in vitro by RGD-containing peptides, we assessed in vivo the antithrombotic activity of RGDV (Arg-Gly-Asp-Val) tetrapeptide using a baboon thrombosis model. Thrombus formation was induced by a device consisting of a tubular segment coated with type I collagen, followed by two regions of expanded diameter exhibiting disturbed flow and stasis. The thrombogenic device was incorporated into femoral arteriovenous shunts under conditions of intermediate wall shear rate (100 s-1). Thrombus formation was measured by scintillation camera imaging of 111In-platelets and by counting of 125I-fibrinogen/fibrin. Thrombus that formed on the collagen substrate was rich in platelets, while thrombus formed in the disturbed flow regions was rich in fibrin and red cells. RGDV peptide was infused proximal to the thrombogenic device to maintain local plasma concentrations of 25, 50, and 100 microM. Infused RGDV decreased the accumulation of both platelets and fibrin on the collagen substrate in a dose-response manner. At the highest dose platelet and fibrin deposition after 40 min was reduced by greater than 80% (P less than 0.01). In the region of disturbed flow, RGDV (100 microM) reduced platelet deposition by 85% (P less than 0.01) but did not reduce the accumulation of fibrin (P less than 0.3). Similarly, the peptide inhibited the release of granular proteins from platelets associated with thrombus (platelet factor 4, beta-thromboglobulin; P less than 0.01), but did not prevent the appearance of fibrinopeptide A in circulating blood (P greater than 0.1). No systemic alterations in blood pressure, bleeding time, or platelet aggregation ex vivo were produced by locally infused RGDV. The antithrombotic effects of RGDV peptide disappeared within 5 min after discontinuing the infusion. In control studies infused RGEV (Arg-Gly-Glu-Val, 100 microM) showed no antithrombotic activity. Thus, RGDV selectively blocks platelet-dependent thrombus formation in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "When applied to the basolateral (serosal) side of the T84 colonic epithelial monolayer, taurodeoxycholate caused net Cl- secretion in a dose-dependent manner with a threshold effect observed at 0.2 mM. In contrast, when applied to the apical (luminal) surface, concentrations of taurodeoxycholate below 1 mM had little or no effect. Only when the concentration of taurodeoxycholate present on the apical side was greater than or equal to 1 mM did apical addition results in an electrolyte transport effect. This apical effect on electrolyte transport was associated with an abrupt increase in the permeability of the monolayer. Cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP in the T84 monolayers were not increased by the bile salt, but in the presence of extracellular Ca2+, free cytosolic Ca2+ increased with a graded dose effect and time course that corresponded approximately to the changes in short circuit current (Isc). The results suggest that luminal bile salts at a relatively high concentration (greater than or equal to 1 mM) increase tight junction permeability. Once tight junction permeability increases, luminal bile salts could reach the basolateral membrane of the epithelial cells where they act to increase free cytosolic Ca2+ from extracellular sources. The resulting increases in free cytosolic Ca2+, rather than in cyclic nucleotides, appear to be involved in transcellular Cl- secretion.\r"

It has been proposed that the high frequency is due to a founder effect. In this paper, we characterized 24 mutant LDL receptor alleles from 12 Afrikaner individuals homozygous for FH. We identified two mutations that together makeup greater than 95% of the mutant LDL receptor genes represented in our sample. Both mutations were basepair substitutions that result in single-amino acid changes. Each mutation can be detected readily with the polymerase chain reaction and restriction analysis. The finding of two common LDL receptor mutations in the Afrikaner FH homozygotes predicts that these mutations will predominate in the Afrikaner population and that the high frequency of FH is due to a founder effect. The increased incidence of ischemic heart disease in the Afrikaner population may in part be due to the high frequency of these two mutations in the LDL receptor gene.\r"

  ".W": "We used soluble, C-fixing antibody/dsDNA IC to investigate immune complex (IC) handling and erythrocyte (E)-to-phagocyte transfer in chimpanzees. IC bound efficiently to chimpanzee E in vitro and showed minimal release with further in vitro incubation in the presence of serum in EDTA (less than or equal to 15% within 1 h). These IC also bound rapidly to E in vivo (70-80% binding within 1 min) and did not show detectable release from E in the peripheral circulation after infusion in vivo (less than or equal to 2% within 1 h). Despite such slow C-mediated release of IC from E, IC were rapidly stripped from E by the mononuclear phagocyte system (T50 for E-IC1500 = 5 min) without sequestration of E. Treatment of the chimpanzees with the anti-Fc gamma RIII MAb 3G8 impaired the clearance of infused IC. This effect was most evident on the fraction of IC500 which did not bind to E and which presumably had captured less C3b (pre-MAb 3G8 T50: 45 min vs. post-MAb 3G8 T50: 180 min). With IC bound in vitro to E before infusion, anti-Fc gamma RIII MAb treatment led to significant amounts of non-E bound IC detectable in the circulation. Thus, the anti-Fc gamma RIII MAb appeared to interfere with the ability of fixed tissue mononuclear phagocytes to take up/or retain IC after their release from E. Both rapid stripping of IC from E, despite slow complement-mediated release of IC from E in the peripheral circulation, and blockade of IC clearance with anti-Fc gamma RIII MAb indicate that the interaction of IC with the fixed tissue phagocyte involves qualitatively different mechanisms than the interaction of IC with E. Fc gamma receptors appear to play an important role in the transfer and retention of IC by the phagocyte.\r"

We used probes from within the breakpoint region on 7q-chromosomes (7q22-34) that detect restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) to investigate three families in which two siblings developed myelodysplasia with monosomy 7. In the first family, probes from the proximal part of this region identified DNA derived from the same maternal chromosome in both leukemias. The RFLPs in these siblings diverged at the more distal J3.11 marker due to a mitotic recombination in one patient, a result that suggested a critical region on 7q proximal to probe J3.11. Detailed RFLP mapping of the implicated region was then performed in two additional unrelated pairs of affected siblings. In these families, DNA derived from different parental chromosome 7s was retained in the leukemic bone marrows of the siblings. We conclude that the familial predisposition to myelodysplasia is not located within a consistently deleted segment on the long arm of chromosome 7. These data provide evidence implicating multiple genetic events in the pathogenesis of myelodysplasia seen in association with bone marrow monosomy 7 or 7q-.\r"

Relative Pi depletion was achieved through dietary restriction and phosphate binders, whereas a Pi-repleted state was produced by oral Pi supplementation. ATP was radioactively labeled by the infusion of [8(14)C]adenine. Fructose infusion was used to produce rapid ATP degradation during Pi depletion and repletion states. Baseline measurements indicated a significant decrease of Pi levels during phosphate depletion and no change in serum or urinary purines. Serum values of Pi declined 20 to 26% within 15 min after fructose infusion in all states. Urine measurements of ATP degradation products showed an eightfold increase within 15 min after fructose infusion in both Pi-depleted and -supplemented states. Urinary radioactive ATP degradation products were fourfold higher and urinary purine specific activity was more than threefold higher during Pi depletion as compared with Pi repletion. Our data indicate that there is decreased ATP degradation to purine end products during a relative phosphate repletion state as compared to a relative phosphate depletion state. These data show that ATP metabolism can be altered through manipulation of the relative Pi state in humans.\r"

Using the pH sensitive fluorescent dye 2'-7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6,-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) and quantitative spectrofluorometry to measure intracellular pH in isolated perfused OMCDi, we have characterized basolateral transport processes responsible for regulation of intracellular pH. Experiments suggesting the existence of basolateral Cl-/base exchange were performed. In HCO3- containing buffers, bath Cl- replacement resulted in reversible alkalinization of the OMCDi from 7.22 +/- 0.05 to 7.57 +/- 0.12. Similarly 0.1 mM bath 4',4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid (DIDS) alkalinized the OMCDi from 7.14 +/- 0.09 to 7.34 +/- 0.09 and blocked further alkalinization by bath Cl- removal (delta = + 0.02 pH units). The concentration dependence kinetics of Cl-/base exchange revealed a K1/2 of 10 mM for external Cl- with a Vmax of 0.50 pH U/min. Experiments suggesting the existence of basolateral Na+/H+ exchange were also performed. Replacement of bath Na+ by tetramethylammonium resulted in reversible cell acidification (7.14 +/- 0.09 to 6.85 +/- 0.1). Tubules that were acidified by a brief exposure to NH4Cl displayed recovery of cell pH back to baseline at a rate that was highly dependent on bath Na+ concentration. Half maximal recovery rate was achieved at 7 mM bath Na+ and Vmax was 0.605 pH U/min. The Na+-dependent rate of cell pH recovery after acidification was blocked by 0.2 mM bath amiloride. These results suggest that intracellular pH in the OMCDi is regulated by parallel basolateral Na+/H+ exchange and Cl-/base exchange.\r"

Microbiological samples were taken from the environment and from gloves, hands, and protective clothing of staff. Glove punctures were also recorded and a plastic isolator evaluated. Bacterial counts in the air were low and related more to the number of people in the room than to the air exchange rate. There was little evidence of the production of aerosol containing bacteria, although splashing occurred while intestines were being washed out. Surfaces often remained contaminated with Gram negative bacilli after cleaning but numbers were considerably reduced on drying. Decontamination of instruments was satisfactory. A wide range of disinfectants and concentrations was used, but none showed evidence of contamination. Gloves were heavily contaminated after use, and occasionally the hands of the wearer after removal of the gloves. Washing the hands effectively removed residual transient organisms, irrespective of the agent used. The incidence of glove punctures was higher among technicians (38%) than pathologists (12%). The plastic isolator reduced smells and limited environmental contamination but visibility and acceptability were poor. The results of the study suggest that there is little evidence of risk of infection to staff, providing basic hygienic precautions are taken, but consideration should be given to the prevention of glove punctures.\r"

Ten cases were of chronic lobular hepatitis, 10 of chronic persistent hepatitis, and 30 of chronic active hepatitis. Ten cases were delta antigen positive and showed high grade lobular activity but no evidence of HBV-DNA episomal forms or HBcAg reactivity. Twenty one cases showed HBV-DNA replicative intermediate forms; 19 had high grade lobular activity, which occurred in five cases without evidence of free viral DNA. Of the 21 biopsy specimens with HBV-DNA episomal forms, 14 were positive for HBcAg; only one of the 19 cases without detectable viral DNA was positive for such antigen. These data indicate that the presence of HBV or HDV active infection correlates with the histological finding of prominent lobular necrosis. Moreover, intrahepatic HBV-DNA seems to be a more sensitive marker than the presence of viral antigens for indicating HBV replication.\r"

Twenty three cases with benign lymphadenopathies were analysed in a similar way. Except for endemic Burkitt's lymphoma most of the tumours were diploid. Near-diploid aneuploidy (with a DNA index ranging from 1.06 to 1.26) was also found in endemic Burkitt's lymphoma as well as in six non-endemic Burkitt's lymphomas and in eight cases of Hodgkin's disease but was absent in nasopharyngeal carcinomas. Tetraploid aneuploidy was seen in three cases of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Five of the 23 cases of lymphadenopathy also showed near-diploid DNA, one of which subsequently developed into a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

  ".W": "Creatine kinase activity was measured in 28 patients in the steady state of sickle cell disease and ranged from 4-45 IU/l, comparable with that found in healthy adult caucasians. Creatine kinase activity was also measured in 14 patients admitted consecutively for the treatment of vaso-occlusive sickle cell crises. Creatine kinase activity remained within the normal range in eight of these 14 patients throughout their admission; none had muscle pain or a chest syndrome. In the remaining six, three with muscle pain and three with a chest syndrome, increased activity was found on one or more days. A further 17 patients with vaso-occlusive sickle cell crises, associated with muscle pain, were studied. Creatine kinase activity was significantly raised in all 17, the mean creatine kinase activity for men was 578.8 IU/l and 210.6 IU/l for women, with the highest values (up to 1790 IU/l) found in those who had exercised before admission. Measurement of creatine kinase activity may therefore be a useful marker of muscle perturbation due to sickling.\r"

Platelets from patients with Raynaud's phenomenon had significantly greater responses to all the 5-HT concentrations tested (p less than 0.001 for 10 microM; p less than 0.01 for 1 microM; p less than 0.05 for 0.1 microM; p less than 0.02 for 0.025 microM) and to low doses of adenosine diphosphate (p less than 0.01 for 1 microM; p less than 0.02 for 0.5 microM) but normal responses to collagen, adrenaline, and high doses of adenosine diphosphate. Patients with secondary Raynaud's phenomenon were significantly more hypersensitive to 0.5 microM adenosine diphosphate than patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon. In patients with secondary Raynaud's phenomenon there was a significant correlation between the extent of 5-HT aggregation and the duration of the disease. The finding that platelets from patients with Raynaud's phenomenon have enhanced responses to 5-HT and adenosine diphosphate, but normal responses to adrenaline and collagen, is consistent with a role for 5-HT in this disease.\r"

Sera were tested for the presence of IgG and IgA antibodies by a conventional indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In patients with confirmed Campylobacter pylori associated gastritis, raised IgG antibody titres were indicated by absorbance values of greater than or equal to 500, greater than or equal to 500, and greater than or equal to 1500 for the SA, AGE, and UP, respectively. Corresponding values for the IgA assay were greater than or equal to 500, greater than or equal to 500, and greater than or equal to 1000. The specificity of the IgG assays were 94%, 92%, and 90% for the AGE, SA, and UP, respectively. In contrast, the UP was the most sensitive (97%); the other two antigen preparations gave values of 82%. In the IgA assay the UP showed the greatest specificity (90%) and sensitivity (90%). The predictive value for a true positive for the IgG assay was the same for all antigens (93%), whereas the UP gave a predictive value for a true negative of 96% compared with 79% for the other two antigen preparations. Of the patients with gastric or duodenal ulcers, raised antibody titres to SA were found in 72% (IgG) and 73% (IgA), to AGE in 75% (IgG) and 63% (IgA), and to UP in 77% (IgG) and 75% (IgA). The use of a urease antigen preparation to determine IgG antibody is recommended for screening patients undergoing endoscopy.\r"

These included medullary, mucoid, tubular, cribriform and lobular invasive cancers, and non-invasive cancers. Excluding these special histological types, the overall number successfully identified (malignant plus suspicious) by fine needle aspiration was 940 (84%), although in only 820 (73%) was malignancy definitely diagnosed. The results for the special types were variable, the mucoid and medullary cancers being consistently identified while the other types were not. For tubular and cribriform, lobular and non-invasive ductal cancers a malignant diagnosis was made in 30% to 40% of cases, although inclusion of suspicious results gave identification figures of 60% to 70%. Particular cytological patterns are characteristic of some special histological cancer types but lesion cellularity, size, and physical definition are all intrinsic factors influencing success of FNA diagnosis. About 10% of all primary breast cancers seem to have certain histological properties which further reduce the success of fine needle aspiration.\r"

It was possible to differentiate the two cyst types in every case by the pattern of staining using the monoclonal antibody LP34 for cytokeratins of intermediate molecular weight. The monoclonal antibody CAM 5.2 for cytokeratins of low molecular weight was not discriminatory. Such a clear distinction may prove useful diagnostically in distinguishing between two cysts of similar appearance but very different behaviour.\r"

Tissue was systematically sampled from 16 normal and 26 fibrotic livers taken at necropsy. The volume fraction of subcapsular and intralobar non-parenchyma and the capsule thickness were determined by morphometry on histological sections. The volume fraction of intralobar non-parenchyma not only correlated well (tau = 0.7, p less than 0.001) with but was also equivalent in each case to the actual volume fraction of subcapsular non-parenchyma. Morphologically, the intralobar and subcapsular areas were remarkably similar. The volume fraction of intralobar non-parenchyma also correlated well (tau = 0.5, p less than 0.001) with capsule thickness. These results show that pathological changes in liver architecture were essentially similar in the intralobar and subcapsular areas and that capsule thickness reflected intralobar non-parenchymal changes.\r"

Undecalcified tissue sections stained by the von Kossa silver method and counterstained with haematoxylin and eosin were used for quantitation. The SPT region was most representative of the iliac bone profile, in particular the structural parameters of mineralised bone, trabecular thickness, and trabecular spacing and resorption surface. Most parameters in the regions studied showed inconsistent and variable results when compared with those of the iliac crest. There was only a weak association, therefore, between the histomorphometric parameters of the iliac crest and the proximal femur despite the appeal of the use of the iliac biopsy specimen as a simple clinical test.\r"

To improve the rates of detection of CMV-IEA and EA the wax embedded material was pretreated with 0.4% pepsin/HCl at 37 degrees C for 30 minutes. This pretreatment was also advantageous for in situ hybridisation. In the patients with histological evidence of CMV infection or positive viral culture from the lung tissue, or both, viral proteins and nucleic acids were detected in lung, as well as in other organs. Immunohistochemical techniques proved superior in heavily infected but necrotic tissues. In control patients (patients who had died from interstitial pneumonia without any evidence of CMV, or with no interstitial pneumonia at all) in situ hybridisation showed no positive signal, while immunohistochemical techniques showed only a few positive cells in lung tissue of one of nine patients. In addition to CMV-DNA analysis, formaldehyde-fixed, paraffin wax embedded tissue is amenable to immunohistochemical analysis with CMV monoclonal antibodies.\r"

Interference with the bone surrounding the ectopic tooth may compromise the adjacent teeth and bone level. Pressure against the root of the impacted tooth may cause resorption. If the buccal or labial plate is removed, orthodontic movement will be impeded. Specific biochemical changes in bone are induced by the application of orthodontic forces. In these cases, creating space with coiled spring appliances resulted in remarkable reorientation and proper eruption of ectopic, impacted teeth. When surgical intervention is required in cases involving ectopic teeth, close collaboration between orthodontist and oral and maxillofacial surgeon is imperative to achieve successful results without negative sequelae.\r"

  ".W": "After a decade spent establishing the safety, efficacy, and optimal techniques for venom immunotherapy, we have begun a series of studies to determine how long venom immunotherapy must be continued. In retrospective surveys, patients who had stopped venom immunotherapy after 1 to 2 years had a substantial risk (25%) of systemic sting reactions, but this was less than 50% of the risk in untreated patients. In this first prospective study, 30 patients elected to stop venom immunotherapy after at least 5 years of therapy. Skin test sensitivity had decreased significantly during therapy in 18/30 patients but remained clearly positive in 23/30 (seven patients became equivocal or negative). Serum venom-specific IgE antibodies were at the lower limit of detection (1 ng/ml) in 11/30 patients. After stopping treatment, the mean serum venom-specific IgG antibody level declined from 5.5 +/- 0.6 micrograms/ml to 2.4 +/- 0.3 micrograms/ml by 9 months, which is the same as the mean venom IgG in untreated patients. After 12 months without therapy, live sting challenge caused no systemic reaction in 29 patients. The mean venom IgG level 1 month after the sting had risen significantly to 4.1 +/- 0.5 micrograms/ml, but there was no significant increase of venom IgE. These results suggest that prolonged venom immunotherapy leads to isotype-specific suppression of the venom IgE antibody response and may provide persistent clinical protection by mechanisms other than IgG blocking antibodies. The observations are to be interpreted very cautiously. Further investigations are needed to extend these observations in additional patients and for longer periods of time, and to examine possible mechanisms for this apparent loss of clinical reactivity.\r"

Fifteen subjects were tested on the back to 10 mg/ml of histamine phosphate and 50% glycerosaline by prick technique with a smallpox needle (SN), bifurcated needle (BN), Greer \"pen\" (GP), and blood lancet, and by puncture with the Morrow-Brown needle (MB) and Multi-Test (MT). Five devices were tested in quintuplicate to histamine and once to glycerosaline in each subject; with MT, five histamine and three glycerosaline sites were used. Analysis of the wheal areas obtained with SN, BN, GP, and MB demonstrated comparable degrees of precision (coefficient of variation). The precision of MT was less than the other devices (p less than 0.05). The blood lancet demonstrated intermediate precision. Twenty-two of 45 (49%) of the glycerosaline skin tests performed with MT were falsely positive, significantly more than the other devices (p = 0.0001). We conclude that MB, BN, GP, and SP are comparable devices for use in immediate hypersensitivity skin testing. The low precision and reliability of MT used for testing on the back would appear to make this device less than adequate for diagnostic or research studies. Its high rate of false positive reactions requires caution in interpretation of results when it is used in the clinical diagnosis of allergy.\r"

IgE antibodies to cross-reacting allergens in caddis flies, mussels, oysters, shrimps, crabs, honeybee, and yellow jacket venoms were determined by RAST, RAST inhibition, and immunoblot studies with sera from three different sources: (1) sera of patients with well-defined inhalant atopy to caddis fly, (2) sera with IgE anti-CCD antibodies from subjects without known exposure to caddis fly, and (3) hyperimmune antisera with IgG anti-CCD antibodies raised as a result of immunization of rabbits with grass-pollen extract, buckwheat glycoprotein, or with honeybee venom. Sera from groups 2 and 3 reacted with Sepharose-coupled caddis fly extract in a RAST-type assay and elicited virtually identical patterns on immunoblots of caddis fly extract separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, whereas the sera from group 1 atopic patients did not react with CCD-rich material. However, indications for other types of cross-reacting antibodies were detected. The IgE antibodies of one of the patients studied (who was allergic not only to caddis fly but also to shellfish) were found to detect a cross-reacting homologous protein in extracts of mussel, oyster, shrimp, crab, honeybee, and yellow jacket venom. Preliminary results suggest that this cross-reacting 13 kd protein, the most prominent caddis fly allergen, is an invertebrate hemoglobin (erythrocruorin)-like molecule. These studies suggest the possibility that patients sensitized by exposure to caddis fly antigens could develop allergic reactions during their first exposure to shellfish or to their first bee sting.\r"

The respiratory parameters and the arterial blood gases during work demonstrated values as in healthy individuals, and no differences between groups with mild and severe asthma during childhood were observed. The alveolar-arterial oxygen difference was normalized, compared to that at 10.9 years. Only a few subjects still had exercise-induced asthma with a postexercise fall of greater than 20% in FEV1 compared to childhood. The mean FEV1 values for the whole group after exercise were lowered and had not returned to the baseline level even after 20 minutes. Oxygen pressure (tension), arterial, measured during 20 minutes after work, demonstrated continuously decreasing values. This might reflect a persisting disturbance in the pulmonary ventilation perfusion relationship caused by the underlying asthma disease.\r"

Skin biopsies were performed before and 1, 6, and 24 hours after ragweed injection. OKY-046 was infused (100 micrograms.kg-1.min) from 1 hour before until 6 hours after intracutaneous ragweed in five dogs. The early clinical response to ragweed (wheal at 20 minutes) was not changed by OKY-046. A late-phase response (induration at 6 hours) was not observed in any of the OKY-046-treated dogs but was present at 6 hours in 4/5 dogs without OKY-046. Typical mast cells responded similarly in both groups with progressive degranulation during 24 hours. Maximal degranulation of atypical mast cells was delayed to 6 hours with OKY-046, whereas these cells responded completely at 1 hour without OKY-046. The inflammatory response to ragweed followed the same pattern in both groups, but the numbers of each cell type were decreased with OKY-046. With OKY-046, the cutaneous response to histamine was not changed significantly from baseline at 6 hours but was increased (p less than 0.05) at 24 hours, whereas without OKY-046, histamine response was significantly increased at 6 hours (p less than 0.001) and 24 hours (p less than 0.01). We conclude that OKY-046 alters the antigen-induced response of atypical mast cells, the subsequent cellular and clinical late-phase response, and prevents the increase in histamine response.\r"

The present studies explored the induction of lung injury induced by short-term intermittent TMA inhalation, a model more likely to simulate short-term industrial exposures during inadvertent spills of TMA. Sprague-Dawley rats inhaled TMA powder (500 micrograms/m3) on days 1, 5, and 10, and were necropsied on day 30, 18 hours after a 6-hour TMA-inhalation challenge on day 29. Rats were bled every second day and at necropsy. Serum IgG, IgA, and IgM antibody to trimellityl rat serum albumin was measured by ELISA. There was a rise in IgM and IgA antibody to trimellityl rat serum albumin starting at day 5 that peaked at day 20 with a decline in IgM by day 30. IgG antibody rose at day 7, peaked at day 20, and plateaued. The IgG antibody level was 10 times higher than the IgA or IgM level. In a second experiment, 18 rats were administered TMA-inhalation exposure on days 1, 5, and 10, and a TMA challenge on day 22. The number of hemorrhagic foci, lung weights, and lung-displacement volumes at necropsy on day 23 were highly correlated with IgG, IgA, and IgM serum-antibody levels. In a final experiment, rats developed a mean of 112 hemorrhagic foci per lung on day 30 after receiving only two TMA-inhalation exposures on days 1 and 5 with a rechallenge on day 29.

  ".W": "The efficacy of nedocromil sodium (NED) (4 mg twice daily) and beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) (200 micrograms twice daily) in controlling the symptoms of asthma, the pulmonary function, and bronchial responsiveness to histamine was assessed in a double-blind, double-dummy, crossover study of 39 adult patients with chronic asthma. The patients, most of whom were assessed to be affected to a moderate degree, were insufficiently controlled in their current regimen of inhaled and/or oral bronchodilators. A 2-week baseline period preceded 6 weeks of treatment with each of the study drugs. Both treatment groups demonstrated improvements from baseline in clinical assessment of lung function performed after the first 6 weeks of treatment. No significant differences were observed when the effects of the treatments were compared on FEV1, FVC, and peak expiratory flow. Bronchial reactivity to histamine, measured as the amount of histamine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20), decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) after 6 weeks of treatment with BDP compared to the effect of NED treatment. Asthma severity, symptom score, and inhaled bronchodilator use demonstrated significantly better results with BDP. After crossover of treatment, the group transferring from NED to BDP continued to improve, whereas the group crossing from BDP to NED tended to demonstrate a major deterioration during the first 3 weeks, after which a stabilization or an increase in FEV1, FVC, and ln PC20 appeared to occur. It is concluded that NED for inhalation is a potent new drug for treatment of both atopic and nonatopic subjects with asthma. With the number of patients and dosages used, the effect on the pulmonary function was not significantly different from that of BDP after the initial 6 weeks of treatment, but BDP had a better effect on asthma severity, overall opinions, symptom score, bronchodilator use, ln PC20, and morning peak expiratory flow.\r"

In this study, 582 sera, contributed by 22 physicians from 18 Gulf Coast cities, were examined by ELISA for IgE directed against determinants in an aqueous extract of PH pollen, and these were compared to an extract of western ragweed (Ambrosia psilostachya [AP]). Overall, 65.6% of the sera tested were positive for one or both of the pollen extracts examined. Thirty-five percent of the sera were sensitive to PH and 57.6% were sensitive to AP. Thirty percent of the sera were positive to AP only, 8.0% were positive to PH only, and 27.9% of the sera were positive to both extracts. ELISA-inhibition analysis demonstrated that PH and AP extracts contained unique allergenic epitopes. Clinical correlation of in vitro reactivity with skin testing and patients' symptoms confirmed that PH sensitivity by ELISA was related in many cases to fall seasonal symptoms. These data demonstrate by in vitro analysis the presence of IgE directed against an extract of PH pollen in a significant number of patients with fall seasonal pollinosis in the U.S. Gulf Coast. Thus, allergic reactivity to PH may be a significant contributor to fall allergic disease in the U.S. Gulf Coast.\r"

Food group and subgroup contributions to 11 nutrients were calculated. The intake patterns of Mexican Americans demonstrated both an adherence to traditional or familiar Mexican food items, such as beans and tortillas, and a preference for foods not previously reported to be commonly consumed by that ethnic group, specifically beef. The current study provides a base of information necessary to implement dietary changes acceptable within the context of a particular culture's world view. Results revealed differences in food intake patterns that would be helpful in designing practical nutrition education programs specifically targeted toward these ethnic groups. For example, inadequate sources of nutrients were identified, as were sources of excess fat.\r"

We found that the accepted procedures for arraying individuals along a continuum, based on their positions within distributions of intakes of specific nutrients, simultaneously array them on other dietary characteristics. A unidimensional approach to dietary assessment could confound cancer risk assessments, and the effects could differ for men and women. We found that men consumed more calories and energy-containing nutrients than women, who were more likely to consume larger amounts of vitamins A and C. Dietary variety was similar for men and women, despite compositional differences in diet. Diets of men contained proportionately more meats, grains and nuts, and alcohol. Diets of women contained more fruits, vegetables, and poultry and fish. Among men, we found stronger intercorrelations among energy intake and intakes of fat, fiber, and vitamin C and among fat intake and intakes of fiber and vitamins A and C. Compositional differences in diet across quartiles of nutrient intake were not consistent for men and women, suggesting that the constellation of dietary risk factors may differ for the two sexes. Men in the lowest quartiles of energy, fiber, and vitamin A intakes had the greatest percent contribution of alcohol to the diet. This pattern was not observed for fat intake levels. Measures of dietary patterns may be needed for more accurate descriptions of the associations of cancer risk and diet.\r"

A three-part survey was developed which included the 30-item Job Characteristics Inventory, 6 items related to job satisfaction, and 7 demographic items. Separate written questionnaires were administered to 32 managerial and 147 non-managerial employees of a large state university foodservice department. The response rate was 98% (32 managers and 143 non-managers). The reliability for the instrument, as determined by Cronbach's alpha, was 0.88 for employees and 0.91 for supervisors. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to test research hypotheses at a significance level of p less than or equal to .05. There was a positive relationship between job characteristics (autonomy, task identity, feedback, variety, dealing with others, and friendship opportunities) and job satisfaction for both employees and supervisors. Feedback and dealing with others were the individual job characteristics that were significant. Only one job characteristic, dealing with others, was rated higher by managerial than by non-managerial employees. There was no difference in job satisfaction by role (managerial vs. non-managerial) or demographic variables, except age for non-managerial employees. Older, non-managerial employees tended to be more satisfied with their jobs than did younger employees. Dietitians and foodservice managers can use the findings for implementing job design strategies, such as job enrichment and job rotation, to improve employee satisfaction.\r"

Eating problems were identified in 27 patients.

  ".W": "A study was conducted to evaluate the impact of the Higgins Nutrition Intervention Program of individual nutritional assessment and rehabilitation on pregnancy outcome in a group of urban low-income women. Developed as an adjunct to routine prenatal care, the Higgins program utilizes an individualized approach to dietary treatment that combines an assessment of the risk profile for the presenting pregnancy with the application of specific nutritional rehabilitation allowances to compensate for the negative impact of diagnosed risks. This report presents results of analyses evaluating differences in birth outcomes between 552 sibling pairs; each mother had participated in the Higgins program during the pregnancy of the second-born, but not of the first-born, member of her pair. After adjustment for parity and sex, the intervention infants weighed an average of 107 gm more than their matched siblings at birth (p less than .01). The rate of low birth weight was 50% lower among the intervention infants than among their siblings (p less than .01); rates of intra-uterine growth retardation and perinatal mortality were also lower in the intervention group. The high risk of poor pregnancy outcome in this group of urban low-income women was reduced by the Higgins program.\r"

Treatment requires use of special foods that are \"yang\" in nature. This article investigated the use of such blood-building foods in seven contemporary Chinese populations throughout the world. Analysis of questionnaires from 379 respondents indicated that high-protein foods, such as pork liver and other meats, were recommended most often. Although these and other foods recommended were primarily yang, only 8.1% of respondents considered weak blood a \"yin\" condition. Comparison of 717 responses concerning foods that should be used to treat weak blood showed more similarities than differences between Chinese populations in different parts of the world. Strong adherence to cultural practices was also evident. Self-diagnosis and self-prescription are common modes of treating symptoms in the Chinese and other cultures. Knowledge of beneficial food-related health practices can enable practitioners to counsel their clients more effectively and to develop bilingual educational materials that incorporate familiar cultural practices.\r"

Fructosamine assays objectively monitor short-term glycemic control and, when used in conjunction with HgA1C, enhance the clinical information obtained and greatly aid in the clinical management of diabetes. Because they rely on glycation of serum proteins, the clinical utility of these assays in the elderly may be altered secondary to the hypoproteinemia that often is seen in these states. Therefore, we investigated the role of glycated serum proteins (ie, fructosamine level) in monitoring elderly diabetics over a 4-month period of observation. We found that the fasting blood glucose over the 4-month period correlated well with the serum fructosamine activity (r = 0.79, P less than .001) and HgA1C (r = 0.78, P less than .001). In addition, we found that the mean daily glucose, as determined by outpatient monitoring, correlated well to both the fructosamine activity (r = 0.66, P less than .001) and HgA1C (r = 0.74, P less than .001). We found no effect on the measurement of the fructosamine assay by the level of albumin seen in these patients. Our study suggests that serum fructosamine and HgA1C are equally effective in monitoring the elderly patient, as has been established in the younger diabetic, and no correction need be made in the fructosamine assay to compensate for variable serum protein levels seen clinically in the elderly.\r"

One of the main neuropathological correlates of the disease is a drop-out of cholinergic neurons within the central nervous system. The neuropeptide that is responsible for water homeostasis and defense against dehydration, vasopressin, is also under direct cholinergic control. Several studies have suggested that in Alzheimer's disease there has been a trend toward lower vasopressin levels than in age-matched controls. In order to improve discrimination of normal from diminished vasopressin levels, nine subjects with Alzheimer's disease (mean age 65 +/- 2 years) and nine age- and sex-matched controls (68 +/- 3 years) underwent a mild provocative challenge of overnight fluid restriction. Individuals with Alzheimer's disease had a greater degree of dehydration, with overnight serum osmolality of 313 +/- 4 vs 300 +/- 3 Mosmol/kg, P = .01, and diminished \"thirst\" as measured by water ingested in one hour of ad libitum water intake. Eight of the nine with Alzheimer's disease had levels of vasopressin which, by extrapolation, appear to be subnormal for their serum osmolalities, whereas seven of the nine control subjects has vasopressin levels within or above the reference range (P less than .05). Elderly individuals with Alzheimer's disease may be at increased risk of dehydration during periods of fluid restriction due to the loss of normal physiological responses of \"thirst\" and vasopressin secretion.\r"

In the present study, the EASI was group-administered to 146 elderly persons attending senior centers and completed individually without examiner intervention by 19 outpatients at a memory disorders clinic. Participants were 60 to 95 years old with 5 to 18 years of education. The EASI demonstrated good internal consistency and test-retest reliability and was significantly correlated with the Mini-Mental State Exam and the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, both widely used screening instruments. Neuropsychological measures of memory, attention, and verbal fluency correlated as well with the EASI as with the examiner-administered screening instruments, suggesting that the EASI may provide an efficient method of screening for cognitive impairment.\r"

  ".W": "The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) has been shown to be an effective screening test for depression in selected geriatric populations. However, it has not been evaluated as a screening test for depression among elderly adults with dementia of the Alzheimer type. Over a two-year period 283 patients were seen in a geriatric assessment center and were screened for depression using the Geriatric Depression Scale. They also received a clinical psychiatric diagnosis by one of two geropsychiatrists. Patients with a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) of 0 (cognitively intact) (n = 70) and those with mild Alzheimer's disease (CDR of 1) (n = 72) were selected for comparison. The data were analyzed using Receiver Operating Characteristic Curves (ROCs) in order to compare the utility of the Geriatric Depression Scale in these two groups. ROC curves, which plot sensitivity against false positives, have come into increasing use as a method of examining the clinical performance of tests. The area lying beneath the curve (AUC) can be estimated and used as a quantitative measure of test performance (equivalent to the Wilcoxon rank sum). In the intact group, the Geriatric Depression Scale produced a ROC curve with an AUC of 0.85 (percent score = 1), which is significant (z = 7.28, P less than .0001). In the group composed of those with Alzheimer's disease, the Geriatric Depression Scale yielded a ROC curve with an AUC of 0.66, which was not significantly different from chance (z = 1.92, P = NS). This study provides empirical evidence that while the Geriatric Depression Scale is an accurate screening test for depression in cognitively intact geriatric populations, it does not maintain its validity in populations that contain large numbers of patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type.\r"

Using the less stringent blood pressure definition (systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 90 mmHg), 884 (34.2%) participants were normotensive and 1,700 (65.8%) were hypertensive at an initial screening. The average annual incidence of hypertension over the subsequent eight years was 13.2%, and life tables demonstrated a gradual risk of developing hypertension. The development of hypertension was not associated with gender or age; while older age groups had a greater chance of developing hypertension than younger, the difference did not reach statistical significance.\r"

This study documents presenting symptoms of pneumonia in 48 patients, aged 65 or older, admitted to the medical service at a Veterans Administration Medical Center. Seventeen subjects (35%) had a classic constellation of symptoms which included both fever and cough. A chief complaint suggestive of pneumonia, defined as cough, fever, or shortness of breath, occurred in 27 subjects (56%). Five subjects (10%) had no symptoms suggestive of pneumonia even with a detailed history. Absence of a classic constellation of pneumonia symptoms correlated with advanced age (P = .0045), cognitive impairment at admission (P = .022), and baseline functional impairment (P = .028). Neither nutritional status as measured by serum albumin nor medical status as measured by number of medical problems and number of medications predicted an atypical presentation of pneumonia. Nineteen subjects (39%) did not have a documented fever, and 15 subjects (31%) did not have a leukocytosis. Absence of fever or leukocytosis did not correlate with age, number of medical problems, number of medications, cognitive status, functional status, or serum albumin. We conclude that a classic constellation of symptoms, signs and laboratory findings is frequently absent but some suggestive symptom is usually present in this population of elderly veterans with community-acquired pneumonia. Patients with advanced age, cognitive impairment at admission, and baseline functional impairment are most likely to have an atypical presentation of pneumonia.\r"

  ".U": "89341213\r", 
  ".W": "Cancer screening in the elderly presents several unique challenges. There are no prospective trials of any cancer screening exam that have conclusively demonstrated efficacy in this age group. Any assessment of cancer screening in the elderly must include measuring an improvement in quality of life and functional status as well as decreased mortality from early cancer detection. Older patients usually prefer improved quality over quantity of life; they may be less interested in a trade-off of months or years of life in exchange for the side effects of cancer treatment. The elderly may need more home assistance during the treatment of the detected cancers; physicians should arrange for this. All of these variables must be included in studies of cancer screening in the elderly; the need for these studies is great. The following recommendations are probably the most reasonable in view of the currently inadequate knowledge base. Screening for breast cancer has demonstrated efficacy, with growing evidence for a cumulative effect from monthly breast self-examination, yearly breast examination by a physician, and yearly or biennial mammography. There may be no need to screen for cervical cancer in women after age 65 who have had regular Pap smear screening; however, older women who have never had Pap smears should have regular Pap smears for several years. Finally, because of the high frequency of colorectal and prostate cancers in the elderly, physicians should probably perform yearly rectal examinations with stool guaiac and regular sigmoidoscopy in this age group until definitive data support continuing or discontinuing these screening examinations. Physicians should educate their elderly patients to the importance of regular cancer screening and cancer risk-factor modification and should offer cancer screening examinations and counseling to elderly patients on a regularly scheduled basis.\r"

Since steroids can provoke amebic activity and even cause a fulminating colitis, it is necessary to determine that amebae do or do not exist. Furthermore, amebae can be easily eliminated by drug therapy but it is hard to eradicate IBD. Despite the above, diagnostic modalities for IBD are as effective as those for amebiasis, particularly for Crohn's disease with ileal involvement. Problems in differential diagnosis arise with IBD grossly limited to the colon. In these cases, false negative stool studies are increased by diarrhea and preparation for examinations, and both stool studies and serologies are compromised by steroids. If the clinical course of IBD is downhill, the clinician is justified in starting steroids even if evaluation for amebiasis incomplete. If, however, the index of suspicion is high, concomitant treatment with Metronidazole would be reasonable.\r"

Duodenal and jejunal wall biopsy from 13 patients revealed normal myenteric and submucous plexuses. A follow-up study of 16 patients was performed after 7 years. At follow-up, the weight loss seen preoperatively had been corrected. However, symptoms were essentially similar to those found at the original examination. Only the frequency of the most distressing symptom, vomiting, was significantly decreased (p less than 0.05). The most striking features in the production of the \"pincher mechanism\" of the duodenum were found to be a short aortomesenteric distance together with sagittal parallelism between aorta and superior mesenteric artery. In conclusion, we recommend a conservative attitude in the treatment of SMAS. Surgical treatment with duodenojejunostomy may be indicated only if vomiting is a predominant symptom and proper conservative treatment has failed.\r"

We suggest that enterovesical fistula by itself is not an indication for surgical intervention.\r"

Seventeen patients (14 men and three women) had developed enterovesical fistulas: 16 had pneumaturia. The barium radiographs demonstrated the fistula in only 37%. All had received sulfasalazine, and most were treated with corticosteroids and antibiotics intermittently; two had successful control of their urinary symptoms on this regimen. Eight patients who received 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) in addition tolerated the urinary fistula well, so that we encourage a trial of 6-MP for this complication of Crohn's disease. Six patients continue on medical therapy alone after a mean of 5.3 years. There were no instances of pyelonephritis during 60 patient years. Eleven patients eventually underwent bowel resection, but in only two was persistence of the enterovesical fistula the primary indication for elective surgery, and in both, it was the patient's choice. Visualization of the fistula on barium enema radiograph or presence of a connection between the sigmoid and the bladder were not associated with adverse outcome. An enterovesical fistula in Crohn's disease rarely leads to serious complications and can often be treated successfully with medical therapy alone: by itself, it need not serve as an indication for surgery.\r"

The 140 normal controls were neighbors identified by the cases.

The mean number of pregnancies among the Crohn's disease patients (1.75 +/- 0.12) was significantly lower than the number for controls (2.14 +/- 0.11), p less than 0.02. The reduction in the mean number of pregnancies among patients with ulcerative colitis (1.77 +/- 0.18) was not significantly different from controls (p less than 0.07). Analysis of waiting time to conception showed that fecundability (the probability of pregnancy in a menstrual cycle) was not different in spouses of IBD patients and controls. We conclude that the overall reproductive capacity of men with IBD is not markedly diminished.\r"

All were having gastrointestinal symptoms, but in none was there objective clinical, radiologic, or endoscopic features of bowel disease, and manometry of the stomach and proximal small bowel was normal. We quantitated certain parameters of fasting intestinal motility and postprandial antral and jejunal motility. There were no significant differences in the interval between interdigestive motor complexes (IMC), duration, propagation velocity, or maximum number of contractions during phase III of the IMC, or postprandial antral and jejunal motility indices. The postprandial indices show a very similar distribution in each decade. Thus, in selected patients with unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms but no objective features of gut disease, quantifiable gastric and small bowel motility parameters do not differ in the age groups 18-39 and 40-69 years.\r"

Extremely elevated serum levels of D-lactate (but not L-lactate) confirm the diagnosis, but currently D-lactate is not clearly established as the putative neurotoxin. We describe a patient who repeatedly developed D-lactate encephalopathy after surgical removal of nearly the entire jejunum and ileum. Markedly elevated D-lactate serum levels were documented during an encephalopathic episode. Potential pathophysiologic mechanisms and the treatment rationale are discussed.\r"

Out of the two lines (HI and HII) selected for their high antibody responses and bearing H-2q, only one (HI) developed arthritis. Both the lines with amplified high or low antibody responses (HG and LG), and the lines differing in the levels of cell-mediated immunity (Hpha and Lpha), failed to develop arthritis. Collagen II autoantibodies were found in all the lines: the responses being high (HI and HG), low (LI, LII and LG), or intermediate (HII, Hpha and Lpha). The level of IgG2a autoantibodies, presumed to be the most pathogenic, was low in two (HI and LII) of the three arthritic lines, and was high in the unaffected HG line. These results show that this arthritis is not solely restricted to H-2q and H-2r haplotypes, and argue against a correlation between collagen autoantibody levels and disease incidence.\r"

Of sera from lupus patients with anti-Sm 18/65 (28%), and 6/55 (11%) of sera without anti-Sm had anti-P as determined by an ELISA using a recombinant P2-beta-galactosidase fusion protein as Ag (p less than 0.05). The levels of anti-P were significantly higher in sera containing anti-Sm (0.37 +/- 0.45) than in sera without anti-Sm antibodies (0.18 +/- 0.20) (p less than 0.01). Similarly, a significantly higher proportion of anti-P positivity was found in autoimmune MRL/Mp-lpr/lpr mice positive for anti-Sm (11/53 = 21%) compared to age- and sex-matched mice without anti-Sm (3/53 = 6%) (p less than 0.05). The IgG subclass distributions for anti-Sm and anti-P antibodies were similar in the MRL mice (IgG2a greater than IgG2b greater than IgG3 greater than IgG1). The association did not reflect polyclonal B cell activation in a proportion of MRL mice because no significant differences were observed in anti-DNA, antichromatin or total serum IgG levels in mice with and without anti-Sm or, in mice positive for both anti-P and anti-Sm compared to mice positive for anti-Sm alone. Cross-inhibition experiments excluded the possibility that the Sm and P protein Ag shared a common epitope. Longitudinal measurement of anti-P and anti-Sm antibody levels by ELISA in three mice indicated that both antibodies first appeared at about 3 to 4 mo of age and fluctuated two- to threefold over 3 to 8 mo with independent peaks of activity. Recent observations regarding a relationship between anti-Sm and autoantibodies to other ribosomal proteins suggest that the association may be explained by an immune response to epitopes coassociated on the ribosome.\r"

  ".W": "Pregnancy losses from gram negative bacterial infections could be caused by direct effects of LPS on placental cells, or indirectly via LPS activation of macrophages in the uteroplacental unit. To evaluate those alternatives, LPS, LPS-activated peritoneal cells, conditioned medium from LPS-activated peritoneal cells, and some purified and recombinant molecules known to be secreted by activated macrophages were tested for their abilities to modify DNA synthesis by rat trophoblast cells. Three trophoblast cell lines derived from midgestation placentas of outbred and inbred rats were used for the experiments. Although the 80-kDa LPS-binding protein was demonstrated on trophoblast cells, LPS alone had no effect on the ability of trophoblast cells to synthesize DNA. In cocultures, trophoblast cell DNA synthesis was slightly enhanced by low concentrations of both unstimulated and LPS-activated peritoneal cells. At higher concentrations, LPS-activated cells caused significant inhibition of DNA synthesis by trophoblast cells. Conditioned media from LPS-activated peritoneal cells were highly inhibitory to trophoblast cell DNA synthesis. When specific molecules likely to be components of those media were tested, IL-1 was found to have a modest but reproducible stimulatory effect and PGE2 did not change trophoblast cell incorporation of [3H]TdR. In contrast, trophoblast cell DNA synthesis was markedly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by both TNF-alpha and TGF-beta 1. No differences in the sensitivity of trophoblast cells from outbred and inbred rats were observed. Given the limitations of the experimental model system, the results suggest that in cases of infection by gram-negative bacteria LPS may have an adverse effect on pregnancy by stimulating resident macrophages to generate and release molecules that are inhibitory to trophoblast cell DNA synthesis.\r"

  ".U": "89341400\r", 
  ".W": "Human Fc gamma RIII (CD16), a low-affinity receptor expressed on several different cell types, has a polymorphism on polymorphonuclear cells (Fc gamma RIIIPMN) identified by the NA1 and NA2 markers. Inasmuch as this polymorphism has functional consequences, an understanding of the structural biology of Fc gamma RIII may provide important insight into receptor function. We analyzed Fc gamma RIIIPMN by SDS-PAGE and found that receptor from individuals allotyped for either NA1 or NA2 contained only one protein after removal of N-linked glycosylations (19 and 21 kDa respectively) whereas receptor from NA1/2 individuals contained both bands. Because some reports indicate that digestion of Fc gamma RIII on NK cells (Fc gamma RIIINK) with N-glycanase also results in two bands on SDS-PAGE, we investigated Fc gamma RIIINK to explore the possibility of a corresponding allelic polymorphism in this receptor. Contrary to expectation, Fc gamma RIIINK from all donors irrespective of their NA allotype contained two bands (20 and 24 kDa) on SDS-PAGE after deglycosylation. In addition, those distinct epitopes on the extracellular domain of Fc gamma RIIIPMN found with mAb B73.1 and CLB gran 11 in association with the NA allotypic differences are expressed (or not expressed) on Fc gamma RIIINK independent of donor NA allotype. Fc gamma RIIIPMN and Fc gamma RIIINK differ at the protein level as they have different m.w. (glycosylated and deglycosylated), different epitopes in the extracellular domain (not attributable to tissue-specific glycosylation), and differential expression of the NA allelic protein polymorphism. Although the membrane anchor of Fc gamma RIIIPMN is a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C sensitive glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol linkage, Fc gamma RIIINK is insensitive to phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. However, a form of Fc gamma RIIINK is released from NK cells upon incubation at 37 degrees C. Thus, the basis for the two bands in Fc gamma RIIINK after N-linked deglycosylation is neither coexpression of two molecular isoforms with different membrane anchors nor an identifiable allelic polymorphism in m.w. restricted to Fc gamma RIIINK (p less than 10(-6)). The differences between the two receptors indicate that, independent of cell anchor type, PMN and mononuclear cells must have different molecular isoforms. The allelic variants, different isoforms, alternative anchor mechanisms and release processes provide for an extensive genetic and regulatory diversity in Fc gamma RIII function.\r"

  ".W": "Mastoparan, a tetradecapeptide toxin from wasp venom stimulates secretion in mast cells and enhances GTPase activity of several purified guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins (G proteins). This suggests that this toxin may effect cellular functions through activation of G proteins. In this report, we probed the effects of mastoparan on cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) and inositol trisphosphate (IP3) formation in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). At noncytotoxic concentrations up to 35 microM, mastoparan induced a dose-dependent elevation in [Ca2+]i in PMN, as determined by the fluoroprobe Fura 2. The increase in [Ca2+]i was attained through two discrete processes involving an initial rapid and transient calcium rise followed by a slower sustained increase. The initial but not the second [Ca2+]i increase was absent in PMN pretreated with pertussis toxin. The second but not the first [Ca2+]i rise required external calcium. The kinetics of [Ca2+]i changes and dependency on extracellular calcium induced by mastoparan correlated with the production of IP3. Pertussis toxin inhibited only the initial phase of IP3 production. The ability of pertussis toxin to ADP-ribosylate Gi-like proteins in PMN membrane was potentiated in the presence of mastoparan. Thus, mastoparan activates phospholipase C in PMN through two independent mechanisms. The first pathway is similar to that induced by chemoattractant receptors in that the rapid and transient activation of phospholipase C is dependent on a pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi protein. The second pathway is delayed, sustained, insensitive to pertussis toxin, and requires extracellular calcium.\r"

Of 981 isolates, 591 (60%) were classified as subgroup A and 383 (39%) as subgroup B. The prevalence of subgroups varied both between and within yearly outbreaks. In 1983-84 and 1984-85, both subgroups circulated concurrently and in almost equal proportions; in 1981-82, 1982-83, and 1985-86 subgroup A was dominant, accounting for 93% of all RSV isolates; and in 1986-87 subgroup B accounted for 89% of all RSV isolates. In some outbreaks both geographic and temporal clustering of subgroups occurred. No major differences in age, gender, or frequency of nosocomially acquired RSV between infants infected with either subgroup were seen, either overall or between or within yearly outbreaks. An expanded panel of monoclonal antibodies revealed further heterogeneity among subgroup A isolates. Comparison of these results with similar studies from other geographic locations indicated that the pattern of RSV subgroup prevalence is a localized phenomenon.\r"

Ferrets were immunized intramuscularly with intact inactivated MDCK- or egg-grown virus and were subsequently challenged with infectious virus grown in either host cell type. MDCK-grown-virus vaccine induced higher mean serum hemagglutination-inhibiting (HAI) and neutralizing antibody titers than did egg-grown-virus vaccine and induced superior protection of ferrets against subsequent challenge with infectious virus grown in either host cell type. These results suggest that human influenza viruses that are antigenically and structurally similar to viruses grown in mammalian cells may be more efficacious as vaccines than some variants selected in eggs.\r"

The antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seroconversion rates did not differ in the groups receiving the rHBV vaccine and the subjects receiving the plasma-derived vaccine. Both vaccines elicited levels of antibodies to HBsAg in greater than 90% of the participants. Geometric mean titers of antibodies to HBsAg induced by the 10- and 20-micrograms doses of the rHBV vaccine did not differ from that induced by the plasma-derived vaccine and were higher than those induced by the 2- and 5-micrograms rHBV vaccine doses. The striking feature of the rHBV vaccine compared to the plasma-derived vaccine was an early and high production of antibodies to PreS2, which may constitute an advantage in prevention of hepatitis B virus infection.\r"

In contrast, there was only a two- to threefold mean increase (range, less than 1- to 78-fold) in about half of the patients who had a detectable antibody response to J5 core determinants and in the third who responded to Re core determinants (range, 1- to 20-fold). All but one of the infective strains of bacteria were smooth on analysis with SDS-PAGE and with rough-specific phages. Humans infected with bacteria that had a rough LPS phenotype, however, did elicit antibody similar to that induced in rabbits after immunization with J5 vaccine. Thus, the human antibody response to natural infection with gram-negative bacilli appears to be directed primarily at homologous, strain-specific epitopes, and the response to the epitopes of LPS core antigens is not against widely shared determinants.\r"

The sensitivity and specificity of the IgG-ELISA were 90% and 99%, respectively, comparable to those obtained with the IgG-IFA. The IgG-ELISA was more sensitive than the IHA test (74%) and was more suitable than the IgG-IFA as a serologic screening test for melioidosis. The IgM-ELISA was compared with the IgM-IFA as a marker of disease stage in patients with melioidosis. There was good diagnostic agreement between the tests; 92% of patients with active disease gave IgM-ELISA titers greater than or equal to 1:5,120 and 93% of patients with subclinical melioidosis had IgM-ELISA titers less than or equal to 1:1,280. Of the overlap group of patients with a borderline IgM-ELISA titer of 1:2,560, approximately 33% were clinical cases. An uncommon disease stage consisting of a self-limited, short-term, flu-like, pyrexial illness accompanied by elevated serum IgM-ELISA titers (greater than or equal to 1:5,120) was seen in a small number of patients residing in endemic Australia.\r"

Bacterial clearance, histopathology, cell recovery by bronchoalveolar lavage, serology, and splenocyte blastogenesis to heat-killed L. pneumophila were studied in cortisone-treated rats and normal controls. Corticosteroid administration resulted in a dosage-related defect in the clearance of L. pneumophila. Cortisone-treated animals had a diffuse, progressive pneumonitis, but the influx of neutrophils to the lung, the serum antibody response, and the sensitization of splenocytes to L. pneumophila were not impaired by corticosteroids. The marked lymphocyte depletion observed in cortisone-treated animals may have contributed to defective expression of cell-mediated immunity. This model may be useful in further studies of the pathogenesis and treatment of legionellosis in the compromised host.\r"

In Texas a seasonal incidence was observed; 45% of all previously reported and current patients had undergone mammaplasty in April, May, or June. Although these findings suggested a possible common source, analysis of 35 available isolates revealed 19 different phenotype patterns. Five different taxonomic groups were represented, although most isolates (70%) were Mycobacterium fortuitum biovar fortuitum. Plasmid bands were identified in 10 of 15 strains studied, with nine different profiles. An additional 11 cases of breast infection due to rapidly growing mycobacteria not associated with augmentation were also identified, of which nine came from the same states that contributed mammaplasty cases. Rapidly growing mycobacterial infections of the breast are endemic in Texas and other southern coastal states, and the heterogeneity of the isolates suggests that most cases are unrelated.\r"

Eighty-eight cases of giardiasis (defined by presence of clinical symptoms or results of stool examination) were identified from groups associated with the nursing home including 35 in nursing home residents, 15 in children in day care, and 38 in employees (including kitchen staff and child care providers). Multiple modes of transmission of Giardia lamblia, including food-borne and person-to-person transmission, occurred for these groups. Evidence of transmission by food included a significant association between sandwich consumption and illness in nursing home staff (P = .04) and a significant lack of illness among nursing home residents who consumed only a pureed diet (P = .007), where all food items are cooked before serving. The primary case among the food handlers, whose illness began in mid-April, had an infected child in the day care center. Person-to-person transmission is supported by a significant association between illness and physical contact with children from the day care facility through an \"adopted grandparent\" program (P = .03). This is the first reported outbreak of giardiasis in a nursing home, and these findings have implications for disease control in other facilities that combine child day care and care of the elderly.\r"

T. gondii infection reactivated, manifested primarily as pneumonia. Lung macrophages supported the growth of T. gondii before, during, and after T. gondii reactivation. Peritoneal macrophages inhibited the growth of T. gondii as pneumonia developed and became permissive as pneumonia resolved. Mice with latent T. gondii infection could survive larger doses of MCMV than could controls. Thus, MCMV infection led to reactivation of latent T. gondii infection in mice.
