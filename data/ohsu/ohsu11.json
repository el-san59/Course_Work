  ".W": "We surveyed 399 patients of family physicians in two rural Canadian towns to determine what help with 30 psychosocial problems they wanted from their physicians. The patients completed a self-administered questionnaire in which they could choose from four levels of physician involvement: no involvement, knowledge of the problem but no help, knowledge of the problem and referral to a specialist, and treatment by the physician. Half of the patients wanted help with life-cycle problems, and over half desired treatment for sleeping problems, anxiety and depression. However, close to 50% of the patients desired no help for interpersonal problems, and over 50% wished to see a specialist for help in coping with a physical illness and long-term pain. Interestingly, English-speaking patients wanted significantly more physician involvement than did French-speaking patients. The results were similar to those of an earlier study of urban patients. Implications for family medicine training are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-four children aged 3 months to 18 years (median, 12 years) were treated for neurogenic sarcoma at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Cancer Research Center from 1958 through 1984. Sixteen patients had neurofibromatosis (NF). The tumors arose in an extremity or in the trunk (15 patients), the retroperitoneum-pelvis (6), or other sites (3). Twelve children underwent grossly complete excision of localized sarcoma; of them, five had no known residual tumor and seven had proven microscopic residual disease. Ten of the remaining 12 patients had grossly visible, residual localized disease, and two had lung metastases. After operation, nine were treated on a protocol with local radiation therapy (4000-6000 rad) plus vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide with or without Adriamycin (doxorubicin). The other 15 were treated variably. At 3 years, the proportion of tumor-free survivors was 9 of 24 (37.5%). The significant favorable factors were the initial surgical removal of all gross tumor (9 of 12 with tumor excision were tumor-free survivors at 3 years compared to none of 12 with gross residual sarcoma; P less than 0.01), and a tumor mitotic rate under one per high-power field. No significant correlation was found between tumor-free survival expectancy and age, race, sex, the presence of NF, the site and size of the primary tumor, or use of the chemoradiotherapy regimen. More effective treatment programs are needed for children with neurogenic sarcoma, especially for those with unresectable tumors.\r"

By contrast, 11 of 13 intestinal type carcinomas were aneuploid and two were diploid.

Comparison of histologic and cytometric analysis showed that all 23 benign tumors were diploid (normal DNA content), whereas the malignant group included both diploid and aneuploid (abnormal DNA content) lesions. There appeared to be a relationship between tumor grade and ploidy level in that 92% of Grade II, 28% of Grade III, and 11% of Grade IV lesions were diploid. Cell distribution analysis, feasible in 51 cases, disclosed that diploid lesions had a low proportion of S and G2 + M cells and most aneuploid lesions a high proportion, indicating a relationship between ploidy level and proliferative activity. The current study shows that solid mesenchymal tumors may be analyzed by DNA flow cytometry. Regardless of histogenetic type, it appears that benign and low-grade tumors are diploid and high-grade tumors, in general, are aneuploid. As to exceptions, DNA analysis may prove to give information beyond that obtained by subjective histologic interpretation. Thus, adequate follow-up might show that high-grade lesions with a diploid DNA content are associated with a better prognosis than expected from histologic classification.\r"

  ".U": "87077800\r", 
  ".W": "In the first Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study (IRS-I), it was found that, of 57 patients with nonorbital cranial parameningeal sarcoma treated from 1972 to 1976, 20 patients (35%) developed meningeal sarcoma and 90% (18/20) died of this complication. Since about half of these 20 patients had received inadequate radiation therapy and all had radiation therapy delayed until week 6, the treatment program was modified in December 1977 to begin radiation therapy on day 0 to the entire neuraxis and the primary tumor for all patients presenting with one or more risk factors indicating a high risk of meningeal involvement, and to administer periodic intrathecal medications to the same patients. The risk factors were intracranial extension of tumor, bony erosion at the cranial base, and cranial nerve palsy. In this report, the prognoses of two groups of patients with nonorbital cranial parameningeal sarcoma are compared: 95 patients treated before modification of the protocol in December 1977 with chemotherapy and nonintensive meningeal radiotherapy (preintensive group) and 68 patients treated subsequently with intensive meningeal radiotherapy and chemotherapy (intensive group). All patients received vincristine and actinomycin D (dactinomycin) with or without cyclophosphamide and Adriamycin (doxorubicin), according to the protocol. Radiation therapy consisted of 4000 to 5500 rad to the primary tumor in 5 to 6 weeks for most patients. The intensively treated patients also received intrathecal drugs via lumbar puncture and whole cranial or craniospinal radiation when one or more meningeal risk factors were present. In the preintensive group, the complete remission rate was 68% (65/95); the percentages of patients tumor free or alive at 3 years were 33% and 41%, respectively. In intensively treated patients, the complete remission rate was 76% (52/68); the percentages of patients tumor free or alive at 3 years were 57% and 68%, respectively. The improvements in the percentages of intensively treated patients tumor free or surviving were highly statistically significant (P less than 0.01 for both comparisons). Within the intensive treatment group, meningeal involvement at diagnosis was an unfavorable prognostic sign, since patients with no meningeal involvement had much better tumor-free survival at 3 years (81% vs. 51%) and survival (90% vs. 57%) than patients with evidence of meningeal involvement; the differences were highly statistically significant (P = 0.01).\r"

To determine the dose-limiting toxicity and optimal method of administration, 24 patients were treated with continuous infusions of cisplatin at a dose rate of 25 mg/M2/day in a limited Phase I trial. A total of 47 courses were given. Nine patients received 13 courses of 4 days duration, 19 received 29 courses of 5 days duration, and five received courses of 6 or 7 days duration. Dose-limiting toxicity was found to be leukopenia: 42% of patients receiving the 5-day treatment developed a nadir count of less than 3000 cells/mm3. Nausea and vomiting were easily controlled. Minimal nephrotoxicity occurred in five patients and was associated with daily volume expansion with 2 l of 0.9% NaCl solution in four patients. All other patients were given 3 l of daily volume expansion during treatment. Responses were seen in 6 of 22 evaluable patients (27%). It is concluded that continuous infusion cisplatin at a dose rate of 25 mg/M2/day can be given safely for 5 days as a single agent if concomitant volume expansion with at least 3 l of 0.9% NaCl solution is given daily. Phase III comparative trials with a conventional bolus and newer high-dose regimens for response and toxicity are indicated.\r"

Five (12%) patients died prior to hospital discharge. All ten of these patients had known, widely metastatic cancer. Among the ten patients who died more than 2 months after filter placement, six had well-differentiated, slow growing tumors. Only three of these patients had brain metastases. Among the 21 survivors only two suffered from cancer. Strict adherence to accepted indications for vena cava filter placement required operative procedures on a small but significant number of patients who demonstrated no significant improvement in quality of life or time out of hospital. Filter placement in patients with aggressive cancers and proven metastases should be performed only after analysis of predicted survival and after detailed discussions with patients and referring physicians. Filter placement in patients with aggressive metastatic cancer may cause discomfort, risk, and expense with little hope for improvement of hospital course, longevity, or quality of life.\r"

  ".W": "Clinical courses of 67 patients with carcinoma in situ (CIS) of the urinary bladder during 14 years from 1971 to 1984 were investigated according to the clinical type of CIS and treatment methods. CIS was classified into four types: the primary group included 18 patients who had neither prior nor simultaneous tumors of the urinary tract; the secondary group included 10 patients who had CIS diagnosed subsequent to the treatment of superficial papillary bladder tumor; the concurrent group included 14 patients who had CIS concomitantly with superficial papillary bladder tumor; and the nonpapillary T1 group included 25 patients who presented with CIS with concomitant nonpapillary T1 tumor. As a rule, the initial treatment was conservative (transurethral resection [TUR] or intravesical chemotherapy) for the primary, secondary, and concurrent CIS groups, whereas treatment was radical (total cystectomy or irradiation) for the nonpapillary T1 group. Five-year survival rates of the primary, secondary, concurrent, and nonpapillary T1 groups were 41%, 100%, 49%, and 68%, respectively. Secondary CIS revealed a rather good prognosis, probably due to the early detection of CIS and early application of intravesical chemotherapy when compared to other groups. Except for patients with nonpapillary T1 tumors, the 5-year rate of malignant progression (invasion or metastasis) and multiple recurrences leading to delayed cystectomy was 81% in 16 patients treated by TUR, whereas it was 39% in 21 patients treated by instillation therapy. It appears likely that intravesical chemotherapy was preferable to other conservative therapies as an initial treatment of CIS. Radical therapy, however, may be the choice for CIS with nonpapillary T1 tumors, ab initio.\r"

Both the 5-year actuarial survival and disease-free survival for all 38 patients were 83%.

Of these six relapses, three patients have died of Hodgkin's disease, one patient has been salvaged, and two patients currently are under treatment for salvage. One patient has developed acute nonlymphocytic leukemia and died of this disease. Extensive disease, as estimated by the number of sites of involvement at presentation, degree of splenic involvement, extent of intra-abdominal disease or mediastinal involvement, did not reveal statistically significant prognostic subgroups for relapse.

  ".W": "Severe enteritis and death consistently occur within 150 hours of a single intraperitoneal dose of 25 mg/kg methotrexate given to rats fed an elemental diet. Rats fed a regular chow diet show no clinical evidence of gastrointestinal morbidity or mortality at this dose. The etiology of this enhanced toxicity is not clear, however. It this study rats were randomized to receive an elemental diet (n = 45) or a regular chow diet (n = 45) for 7 days. They were then given a bolus dose of 3H methotrexate (25 mg/kg) intraperitoneally. At 20 and 40 minutes and at 1, 2, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours after injection, five animals from each group were anesthetized, and mean methotrexate levels in bile and serum, and tissue methotrexate concentrations in proximal, mid, and distal small intestine and in liver were obtained. Mean methotrexate levels in bile were significantly elevated in rats fed an elemental, chemically defined diet at 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours compared with regular diet fed rats. Mean serum methotrexate levels were elevated in both the inferior vena cava (IVC) and portal vein (PV) at 12 (IVC), 24 (PV), and 48 hours (IVC) in elemental, liquid diet fed rats. There were no statistical differences between methotrexate levels in rats fed an elemental diet or a regular chow diet in proximal or mid small intestine at any of the time points measured. In the distal small intestine, methotrexate levels were significantly elevated at 24 hours in rats fed an elemental, chemically defined liquid diet (P less than 0.03) compared with regular diet fed rats. Methotrexate levels in liver of rats fed an elemental, chemically defined liquid diet were significantly elevated at 24 and 48 (P less than 0.05) hours. Administration of an elemental, chemically defined liquid diet prolongs the enterohepatic circulation of methotrexate in rats and delays clearance of the drug from the systemic circulation. Thus, prolonged exposure of methotrexate to the cells of the intestinal mucosa explains the increased gastrointestinal side effects of the drug in rats fed an elemental, chemically defined liquid diet. If these results are applicable to man, elemental, chemically defined liquid diets are contraindicated as the sole nutritional source in patients receiving methotrexate. Such qualitative alteration of dietary intake may be a factor in the unpredictability of gastrointestinal side effects associated with high dose methotrexate administration.\r"

The human hybridoma nature of the fusion products was confirmed by chromosomal analysis and HLA typing. The hybridomas are stable over a year of growth, and can be frozen, thawed and regrown. The carcinoma cells of the patient harbor mouse mammary tumor virus (MuMTV) cross-reacting antigens. The patient's serum and the purified monoclonal antibodies reacted with MuMTV polypeptides. Radioimmunoprecipitation studies using labeled MuMTV confirmed the binding of the patient's serum to the viral proteins. None of the control immunoglobulins reacted with the virus. No binding of the hybridoma immunoglobulins was observed with two other retroviruses (avian myeloblastosis virus and simian sarcoma virus). The ligand binding characteristics of the monoclonal antibodies suggest binding to epitopes on the various structural virus polypeptides. These monoclonal antibodies may serve as a probe to analyze the MuMTV-human breast carcinoma relationship.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the results of therapeutic advances in the treatment of small cell carcinoma of the lung (SCCL) achieved during the past 15-year period at a single large institution, 508 patients treated between 1968 and 1982 were divided into two groups: 157 patients (66 in the category of limited-stage disease and 91 in the extensive-stage disease category) treated with low-dose small-volume radiotherapy (RT) (time dose fractionation [TDF] 49-66) and with cyclophosphamide alone or a COPP program during the first period of 7 years (1968-1974); 351 patients (180 in limited and 171 in extensive stage) treated with multidrug chemotherapy (CT) and high-dose large-volume RT (TDF 73-89) during the second period of 8 years (1975-1982). For patients with limited-stage cancer, 5-year actuarial survivals were 3% versus 7% for the periods 1968-1974 versus 1975-1982, respectively, P less than 0.01. For patients with extensive-stage cancer, the median survival time (MST) and 2-year actuarial survivals were 5 months and 2% versus 7 months and 4% for the periods 1968-1974 versus 1975-1982, respectively. To evaluate the outcome of a contemporary approach, i.e., CT alone, with RT reserved for locoregional failure, 180 patients with limited-stage cancer who were treated (1975-1982) were further analyzed for MST, 2- and 5-year actuarial survival figures, and local-tumor control rates according to the therapeutic approaches employed: CT + RT (112); CT alone (36); RT alone (17); and surgery (S) +/- CT +/- RT (15). Although the 36 patients in CT alone seems a small number, 17 of the 36 patients were enrolled in this approach in 1981-1982, reflecting a shift of emphasis from RT to CT. The MST and 2-year actuarial survival figures were 11 months and 0% versus 13 months and 21% for CT alone versus CT + RT respectively, P less than 0.05. CT + RT achieved a 5-year cure rate of 8%. S +/- CT +/- RT or RT alone also achieved 5-year cure rates of 8% and 10.5%, respectively, in selected subsets of patients. Local relapse rates were 80% (29/36) versus 25% (28/112) for CT alone versus CT + RT. These data emphasize the importance of thoracic RT given at the early phase of treatment to improve long-term survival for patients with limited-stage SCCL.\r"

Mean +/- SD activity (pmol porphyrin/mg protein/hr) at diagnosis (n = 24), on relapse (n = 14) and during active disease (n = 14) were 31.7 +/- 19.8, 31.7 +/- 27.2 and 29.4 +/- 18.5, respectively. These values were significantly higher than the enzyme activity during remission (14.1 +/- 4.0), which was in the normal range (14.5 +/- 3.8). Abnormally high activity was found in 65.4% of determinations at diagnosis, on relapse and during active disease, compared to 5.5% during remission (P less than 0.001). Significant association of abnormal URO-S activity was found with advanced clinical stage (P less than 0.01), spleen enlargement (P = 0.048), involvement of bone marrow (P = 0.02), as well as lymphoma cell spread to peripheral blood (P = 0.03). Highly significant correlation (r = 0.65, P less than 0.001) was found between URO-S activity and serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. Excessively high levels of URO-S activity were found only in patients with lymphoma cells in peripheral blood. No association was found with histopathologic classification and liver size. The authors conclude that URO-S activity is a biochemical indicator for patients in all stages of NHL and seems to be a specific marker for the extensiveness of the disease.\r"

The series comprised 31 male and 4 female patients with a median age of 32 years. Twenty patients had Ann Arbor Stage I disease; 5, Stage II; 8, Stage III; and 2, Stage IV. Eight cases showed a multifocal epithelioid histiocytic reaction; six of these had advanced-stage (III or IV) disease (P = 0.003). Five cases contained relatively frequent atypical mononuclear cells; four of these were Stage III or IV (P = 0.017). A purely diffuse growth pattern was also associated with high stage (P = 0.031). Presence of nodularity correlated with low stage (P = 0.031). During follow-up (median, 4 years; range, 2.5 months-18 years) there was a high incidence of second neoplasms (2 large cell lymphomas, 3 non-hematologic malignancies). LPHD manifests greater diversity of stage at presentation than originally thought. A high content of epithelioid histiocytes, relatively frequent atypical mononuclear cells, and diffuse histology appear to define subsets associated with advanced-stage disease. The correlation of nodular growth pattern with low-stage disease is consistent with the distinctive behavior and derivation of nodular LPHD.\r"

The natural history and response to multimodal therapy of these rare tumors are described. The pathologic material was reviewed and evidence for the differentiating potential of undifferentiated (embryonal) sarcoma is presented. At diagnosis, disease was restricted to the right lobe of the liver in three patients, was bilobar in four patients, and extended from the left lobe into the diaphragm in one patient. Lung metastases were present in two patients at diagnosis. All three patients with rhabdomyosarcoma had intrahepatic lesions without involvement of the biliary tree. Survival ranged from 6 to 73 months from diagnosis (median, 19.5 months); two patients are surviving disease-free for 55+ and 73+ months, and one patient recently underwent resection of a recurrent pulmonary nodule 22 months from initial diagnosis. Three patients died of progressive intrahepatic and extrahepatic abdominal tumors, and two patients, who died of progressive pulmonary tumor, also had bone or brain metastasis but no recurrence of intra-abdominal tumor. Six patients had objective evidence of response to chemotherapy. The authors suggest an aggressive multimodal approach to the treatment of these rare tumors in children.\r"

After 1 month, 83% of hydrazine and only 53% of placebo patients completing repeat evaluation maintained or increased their weight (P less than 0.05). In addition, appetite improvement was more frequent in the hydrazine group (63% versus 25%, P less than 0.05). Although caloric intake was only slightly greater in hydrazine-treated patients, an increased caloric intake was more commonly associated with weight gain in patients receiving hydrazine compared with those receiving placebo (81% versus 53%, respectively). Hydrazine toxicity was mild, with 71% of patients reporting no toxic effects. Hydrazine sulfate circulatory levels were obtained from a subset of 14 patients who completed 30 days of treatment, with a single sample obtained in the morning at least 9 hours after the last dose. Mean maintenance hydrazine sulfate levels, determined using a spectrofluorometric assay, ranged from 0 to 89 ng/ml (mean 45 +/- 16 ng/ml). These data, which demonstrate an association between 1 month of hydrazine sulfate administration and body weight maintenance in patients with cancer, suggest future clinical trials of hydrazine sulfate are indicated to definitively assess its long-term impact on important clinical outcome parameters in defined cancer populations.\r"

A dose-effect relationship of 40 carcinomas/10(4) persons/Gy for a median follow-up period of 41 years for the area exposed was calculated. The severity of radiodermatitis is associated with a higher prevalence of skin cancer. The number of radiation-induced skin cancers rises with the post-treatment time. Because of these late radiation effects, radiotherapy of benign skin lesions is contraindicated, especially now that other therapy modalities are available.\r"

Approximately 2% of the cancers analyzed contained HPV DNA. These included carcinomas of the lung, cecum, tongue, and neck. Three of four cancers contained HPV-16-related nucleotide sequences. Thus, in addition to previous data demonstrating the association of HPV DNA with certain cancers of the skin and genital tract, data is presented that indicates that several additional human cancers also contain HPV-related nucleotide sequences.\r"

On the whole, of eight cases, two showed vascular invasions at a distance, five (including the preceding ones) showed invasion of medium-sized blood vessels in the peripheral parts of the lesion, and three showed older invasions in their center; only two had no vascular lesions. To the authors' knowledge, vascular invasion at a distance has been reported only once to date. An inflammatory origin for these cytologically benign lesions remains possible, although a striking resemblance with intravascular fasciitis can also be shown. These lesions should be treated by radical and precocious surgery.\r"

The anatomical radius and medial thickness of the cross-sectioned arteries were determined in a standardized state of the circularly stretched, internal elastic membrane. It was shown that not only the medial smooth muscles were extremely hypoplastic in arterioles contained in the carcinoma, but the media of tumor-supplying host arteries was also significantly thinner than in the controls, even in segments distant from the tumor, showing more or less lowered regulatory activity of the whole tumor-bearing arterial tree. Under these circumstances, dissection of the host arteries was frequently found to arise, evolving into the typically non-muscularized tumor vessels. The authors consider the abnormal hemodynamics of cancer to be fully explainable from these vascular alterations.\r"

Young male Fischer rats, which were recipients of normal bladders, were divided into three groups; the first group received 0.5 mg of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) into HTBs for six doses, a second, 0.05 mg for six doses and the third, 1 mg for three doses. Separately, a group of animals received bladders from rats treated with 0.05% N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine (BHBN) in drinking water for 4 weeks; the transplanted bladders then were treated with 0.5 mg of MNU for six doses. Treatment with the larger dose of MNU resulted in a significant increase in tumor incidence and frequency of invasive carcinomas. The combination carcinogen treatment induced more invasive carcinomas than the single treatment. The data suggest that deeply invasive carcinomas may develop in two ways: the first is by emergence of a more anaplastic cell population within a pre-existing noninvasive carcinoma and the second is by the de novo development of an invasive carcinoma directly from a severely dysplastic urothelium, which is acceptable as carcinoma in situ. Squamous differentiation was characteristic of deeply invasive carcinomas. The dose of carcinogen(s) is a determinant of aggressiveness of bladder carcinomas.\r"

The alveolar subtype had the highest proportion of distant metastases and the lowest occurrence of local progression alone from the primary site. More distant metastases were observed among the patients with extremity primary, and the frequency increased significantly with the alveolar histologic subtype. Parameningeal tumors, irrespective of their histologic subtypes, showed a high incidence of direct extension from the primary lesion especially into the CNS. The lung was the most common site of metastasis at death, followed by the regional lymph node, bone, liver, and brain.

Carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater could be divided into four stages (I, II, III and IV), according to the microscopically verified extent of involvement by the tumor. All 12 patients with a Stage I tumor, defined as one restricted to within the muscle of Oddi as a boundary, showed no lymph node involvement and carried an excellent life expectancy with a relative 5-year survival rate of 85%. Thus, categorization of such a tumor as early carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater is valid. Excluding two unclassifiable cases, the remaining 95 patients with Stage II, III, or IV tumors extending beyond the boundary of Oddi carried relative 5-year survival rates of 11%, 25%, or 24%, respectively. Of the 109 carcinomas, 20 had areas of unequivocal adenoma at the margins, and of the five adenomas, two larger ones had foci of atypical epithelium suggestive of carcinoma in situ. These findings show the close relationship between adenoma and adenocarcinoma of the ampulla of Vater.\r"

Mitotic count, degree of pleomorphism, cellularity, and amount of tumor matrix in the sarcomatoid areas, and similar morphologic parameters in the carcinomatous component all failed to correlate with prognosis, as did tumor size and renal vein involvement by tumor. Clinicopathologic stage was a most significant prognostic factor, with a survival of 49.7 months for Stage I and 6.8 months for combined Stages II, III, and IV. Tumor necrosis in the sarcomatoid area and proportion of sarcomatoid components were also poor prognostic factors. When these factors were compared to the stage, necrosis was an independent variable, however, proportion of sarcomatoid components was a poor prognostic indicator only for Stages I and II.\r"

The degree of atypia of the epithelial and mesenchymal elements was assessed on the basis of the cytologic features and mitotic activity. Twenty-three percent of the cases contained high-grade epithelial elements, whereas high-grade mesenchymal elements occurred in 18% of the cases; in addition there were nine cases classified as showing frankly malignant teratomatous elements. The presence of cytologically disturbing epithelial and mesenchymal elements (which, however, lacked an invasive malignant pattern) correlated with an increased incidence of recurrent teratoma compared to less atypical teratomatous elements (23% vs. 6% for epithelial elements, and 18% vs. 9% for mesenchymal elements, respectively). This difference, however, was not statistically significant (P greater than 0.05). There was no correlation between teratomatous atypia and recurrent, non-teratomatous germ cell tumor. The presence of an invasive malignant pattern did identify patients at significantly increased risk for recurrent teratoma-derived tumor. The authors conclude that cytologic atypia in the absence of invasion is not sufficient justification for altering the usual therapeutic strategies for patients with teratomatous metastases.\r"

Of these 71 cases, 21 cases were multiple intramucosal cancers. These 21 cases of multiple intramucosal cancers were compared with 49 cases of single intramucosal cancers of glandular type in terms of the maximum diameter of each lesion and the location within the stomach.

All patients treated for relapse by chemotherapy and surgery entered a complete remission for at least 1 year. It proved impossible to establish criteria for prediction of a subsequent relapse. Both serum tumor marker assays and roentgenography are important aids in diagnosing a relapse.

To identify risk factors for these events, we first matched the 37 patients who demonstrated occlusion on the immediate preangioplasty repeat angiogram with 37 patients who did not. Matching was based on the time interval between angiograms, the date of the procedure, and the site of the lesion. Preangioplasty occlusion patients did differ from controls by age (47 +/- 11 vs 54 +/- 8 years, P less than .01), smoking status (34/37 vs 24/37, P less than .01), and angina class (2.6 +/- 1.0 vs 2.3 +/- 0.7, P less than .10) at the time of the first angiogram. Second, we pooled the data of the 37 preangioplasty occlusion patients with those of the 13 patients with preangioplasty myocardial infarction. The 50 cases with complication (coronary occlusion or myocardial infarction) were younger (47 +/- 12 vs 54 +/- 8 years, P less than .01), more often smokers (42/50 vs 24/37, P less than .05), and more symptomatic (2.7 +/- 0.8 vs 2.3 +/- 0.7, P less than .05) than the 37 controls. This study suggests that young smokers with severe angina are at high risk of preangioplasty occlusion and/or myocardial infarction; prompt management of these patients, when considered for PTCA, seems advisable.\r"

This was repeated after 5 min to assess the reproducibility of the changes. The maximal hyperemic response lasted from 24 until 37 sec after papaverine administration. There was no significant difference between the two consecutive hyperemic responses (Student's t-test for paired observations). The mean difference between first and second hyperemic responses at 30 sec was 7.0% (SD +/- 6.2%). In conclusion, 10 mg of intracoronary papaverine is a short-lasting and reproducible means of inducing a maximal hyperemic response in the coronary vascular bed and therefore appears to be the ideal agent for investigating coronary flow reserve.\r"

The intravenous infusion of dipyridamole (0.56 mg X kg-1) is considered to elicit maximum coronary vasodilation. The present study was designed to compare coronary flow and resistance responses to intravenous dipyridamole and intracoronary injection of contrast medium (ioxaglate), this latter technique being frequently used in digital radiology to stimulate hyperemia. The comparison was performed in seven normal patients, nine patients with coronary artery disease, and 16 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Coronary flow reserve was calculated as the ratio of peak flow after dipyridamole or contrast medium to control flow, and coronary resistance reserve was calculated as the ratio of minimal to control coronary resistance after each stimulus. Although flow reserve after dipyridamole was approximately twice that obtained after contrast medium in the normal group (4.01 +/- 0.56 vs 2.02 +/- 0.24) there was a close and linear relationship between coronary flow and resistance reserve estimated by both techniques (r = 0.846, p less than 0.001 for flow reserve ratios, and r = 0.844 p less than 0.001 for resistance reserve ratios). However, contrast-induced hyperemia identified 13/25 (52%) of patients with coronary artery disease or dilated cardiomyopathy as having a reduced flow reserve, while dipyridamole revealed a restrained coronary flow reserve in 20/25 (80%) of these patients. Similar proportions were obtained when using coronary resistance reserve (56% for contrast vs 80% for dipyridamole). (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study examined the relation between left ventricular diastolic performance and exercise tolerance in 63 patients with left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction less than 50%) due to known or suspected coronary artery disease. The 51 men and 12 women, aged 54 +/- 8 years (mean +/- standard deviation), underwent symptom-limited upright exercise testing on a bicycle ergometer. The exercise end-points were angina (n:5), dyspnea (n:16), and fatigue (n:42). The patients were divided into three groups: group 1 (n:28) with normal exercise tolerance (9.5 +/- 2.4 minutes), group 2 (n:18) with mild exercise intolerance (5.8 +/- 0.5 minutes), and group 3 (n:17) had severe exercise intolerance (3.7 +/- 0.9 minutes). The three groups did not differ in age, ejection fraction, end-diastolic volume, exercise end-point, exercise heart rate, and left ventricular peak filling rate at rest. The exercise peak filling rate was, however, significantly higher in group 1 (p = 0.03). Stepwise multivariate discriminant analysis of important variables identified the exercise peak filling rate as the only predictor of exercise tolerance (F = 6.0). Thus, variation in exercise peak filling rate may in part explain the variability of exercise tolerance in patients with left ventricular dysfunction; patients with preserved exercise capacity have higher exercise peak filling rate than those with exercise intolerance.\r"

The arterial stenoses were created in arteries and tubes of similar size to human coronary arteries and were perfused in vitro at pressures and flows typical of those in the human circulation. At very low flow rates, flow and peak velocity are linearly related, and thus peak velocity measurement can predict internal cross-sectional areas accurately. With higher flow rates, the intravascular velocities are not linearly related to flow and cannot be used to measure internal cross-sectional area. This is due to flattening of the velocity profile at both more severe stenoses and higher flow rates.\r"

The coronary dilatation catheter was passed through the guiding catheter into the internal mammary artery. This technique permitted successful access into the ipsilateral mammary artery in eight patients, the left internal mammary artery graft in five and the right in three patients. The angioplasty procedure was successfully performed in seven of eight cases (spasm of the left internal mammary artery precluded successful dilatation catheter passage in one case). No brachial artery complications were encountered. In two cases, angioplasty was successfully performed in additional coronary vessels. Follow-up of 1-16 months (mean: 7.7 months) revealed no clinical evidence of restenosis. The ipsilateral brachial artery approach utilizing preshaped guiding catheters for visualization and introduction of dilatation catheters into the internal mammary artery graft is a safe and successful approach, and it is an acceptable alternative to the femoral technique.\r"

In publications, the most critical problems mentioned are severe systemic hypotension and bradycardia due to stasis of blood flow. A triple-lumen balloon was developed to allow more rapid inflation and deflation and to preserve the preexistent forward blood flow during maximal inflation. Only a slight systemic hypotension and no bradycardia were seen in the first two patients with pulmonary valve stenosis treated with this type of balloon. Thus, the maximal inflation time is not a critical parameter, whereas with the former types of balloon, maximal inflation times were critical, and, if longer than 5 to 10 sec, severe systemic hypotension was registered. We conclude that the triple-lumen pulmonary valve-dilatation balloon catheter is superior to the single-lumen balloon catheter used up to now.\r"

Exposure to the Na ionophore, monensin, was used to induce creep currents in isolated atrial cells. The sensitivity of myocardial creep currents to three compounds that have been shown to be inhibitors of Na-Ca exchange flux activity in isolated sarcolemmal vesicles was assessed. Dodecylamine, quinacrine, and the amiloride analog, 3',4'-dichlorobenzamil block creep currents at concentrations well below those required to block Na-dependent Ca uptake in sarcolemmal vesicles. The estimated Ki's for inhibition of myocardial creep currents were 3 microM for dodecylamin, 10 micron for quinacrine, and 4 microM for 3',4'-dichlorobenzamil. The sensitivity of creep currents to these compounds is consistent with the hypothesis that creep currents may represent the electrogenic activity of a Na-Ca exchange carrier. In an additional series of experiments, the relative specificity of these compounds was tested by examining their effects on myocardial membrane channels. Both dodecylamine and 3',4'-dichlorobenzamil were found to inhibit myocardial Ca and K currents over the same range of concentrations in which block of exchange activity occurs. These results seriously question the use of these exchange carrier inhibitors as selective experimental probes for defining the role of Na-Ca exchange in various physiological processes.\r"

In Tyrode solution containing 5.4mM [K+]o, 10(-6) M norepinephrine decreased aiNa, whereas in K+-free solution 10(-6) M norepinephrine did not lower aiNa. 16.2 mM [K+]o decreased aiNa from 8.8 +/- 0.9 mM to 6.5 +/- 0.5 mM (mean +/- SD, n = 5). Exposure to 10(-6) M norepinephrine in the presence of high [K+]o further decreased aiNa by 0.7 +/- 0.4 mM. This further decrease was prevented by exposure to 2.5 X 10(-6) M strophanthidin (n = 4). Blockade of the fast sodium channel with 5 X 10(-6) M tetrodotoxin lowered aiNa from 8.5 +/- 1.3 mM to 7.4 +/- 1.1 mM (n = 4). Exposure to 10(-6) M norepinephrine in the presence of tetrodotoxin further lowered aiNa by 0.9 +/- 0.2 mM. We also studied the effects of the analogues of adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate, N6, 2'-0-dibutyryladenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate, and 8-(4-chlorophenylthiol)-adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate on aiNa and twitch tension. Both analogues lowered to aiNa and increased twitch tension mimicking the effects of norepinephrine. Our results support the hypothesis that norepinephrine lowers aiNa by stimulating the Na+-K+ pump in this tissue. This stimulation appears to be mediated by adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate and does not appear to be due to intercellular K+ accumulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We also examined the effect of hypoxia on the slope and intercept of the vascular pressure-flow (P/Q) relation. In 14 lungs, we used the micropipette servonulling technique to measure pressures in 20-80 micron subpleural arterioles and venules during normoxia and hypoxia at constant blood flow. In 5 other lungs, we used radiolabelled microspheres to determine the effect of hypoxia on regional distribution of blood flow. Under baseline normoxic conditions, segmental pressure drops in arteries, microvessels, and veins were approximately equal. During hypoxia pulmonary artery pressure always increased, resulting in a 60% increase in total vascular resistance. All segmental pressure drops increased with hypoxia. Arterial and venous pressure drops increased by 80 and 70% respectively, contributing almost equally to the increase in total pulmonary vascular resistance. Regional distribution of blood flow was uniform during normoxia and was unchanged during hypoxia. Hypoxia increased both the slope and intercept of the P/Q relation significantly, with an increase in fluid filtration rate. We conclude that in the newborn lamb alveolar hypoxia leads to pulmonary arterial and venous constriction, resulting in increased microvascular pressure and fluid filtration.\r"

Studies were made in chronically prepared unanesthetized sheep with lung lymph fistulas. Control thrombin challenged sheep (n = 5) were compared to animals infused with SOD (the SOD-thrombin group, n = 5) or animals infused with SOD linked to high molecular weight Ficoll (the Ficoll-SOD-thrombin group, n = 6). The Ficoll-SOD-thrombin animals were also compared to animals infused with Ficoll alone (the Ficoll-thrombin group, n = 4). In the control-thrombin group, thrombin induced sustained increases in the pulmonary transvascular protein clearance (pulmonary lymph flow X lymph/plasma protein concentration ratio) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). In the SOD-thrombin group, thrombin initially increased both pulmonary transvascular protein clearance and PVR; however, the later increases in protein clearance and PVR were blunted. The pulmonary reflection coefficients for total protein (sigma), a measure of vascular permeability to protein, decreased from a value of 0.70 +/- 0.03 in normal sheep to 0.60 +/- 0.01 following thrombin challenge (p less than 0.05) indicating an increase in lung vascular permeability. The sigma value in the SOD-treated animals was 0.70 +/- 0.02, indicating a protective effect of SOD. The infusion of the Ficoll-SOD complex also attenuated the increases in pulmonary transvascular protein clearance and PVR after thrombin. However, the infusion of Ficoll alone induced a similar protection. The lymph from the SOD-thrombin and Ficoll-SOD-thrombin groups prevented the reduction of ferricytochrome C by xanthine/xanthine oxidase, whereas, the lymph from the Ficoll-thrombin animals did not have this effect, indicating SOD activity was present in the animals receiving the enzyme but not in the group infused with Ficoll alone. Differences in the degree of intravascular coagulation could not explain the response to Ficoll since the decreases in fibrinogen concentration following the thrombin were similar in all the groups. Since Ficoll and related dextrans may modify neutrophil function, in particular neutrophil adherence to the endothelium, we examined the effects of Ficoll on neutrophil adherence. The results indicated that when Ficoll was added to the endothelial medium Ficoll reduced the increase adherence of neutrophils to the endothelial cell monolayer. Therefore, Ficoll as a carrier for SOD may provide a direct protection in models of lung vascular injury that are dependent on neutrophils.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Delayed afterdepolarizations and triggered activity may be particularly important in the pathogenesis of arrhythmias in the ischemic heart. The present study was performed to determine whether lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), at concentrations comparable to those present in ischemic myocardium, can induce delayed afterdepolarizations and/or triggered activity in normoxic canine Purkinje fibers. In the present study, as little as 75 microM LPC was found to induce delayed afterdepolarizations and as little as 100 microM LPC was found to induce delayed afterdepolarizations and triggered activity even at low cycle lengths. The amplitude of the induced delayed afterdepolarizations was enhanced by augmentation of the extracellular concentration of calcium (7 mM) or by exogenous epinephrine (10(-9) to 10(-6) M). The amplitude was decreased by verapamil (1 mg/l) or Mn++ (2.5 mM). Epinephrine at a concentration of 10(-6) M also initiated triggered activity in Purkinje fibers exposed to LPC (75 microM), a response blocked by l-propranolol (2 X 10(-7) M and 10(-6) M) but not by the alpha 1-adrenergic blocking agent BE-2254 (10(-6) M). Delayed afterdepolarizations induced by LPC (75 microM) and epinephrine (10(-6) M) persisted even in the presence of acidosis (pH 6.7) and hyperkalemia ([K+]o = 7 mM). Thus, delayed afterdepolarizations and triggered activity induced by LPC may contribute to the induction and/or maintenance of arrhythmias early after the onset of myocardial ischemia. However, because of the reversal of these effects after superfusion with media devoid of LPC, they may occur with ischemia in vivo but not be seen in tissue isolated from ischemic regions and evaluated in vitro.\r"

  ".U": "87078720\r", 
  ".W": "Adenosine has a negative dromotropic effect and modulates hypoxia-induced atrioventricular (AV) conduction delay. To further characterize the negative dromotropic effect of adenosine in the guinea pig heart, we determined the site of adenosine-induced AV conduction block; the effect of uptake and deamination of adenosine on its concentration-negative dromotropic effect, and the adenosine receptor that mediates this action. In isolated AV node preparations (n = 16), adenosine in a dose-dependent manner decreased significantly the duration and amplitude of the action potential of atrionodal and nodal cells and, in addition, markedly depressed the maximum rate of rise of the action potential of nodal cells. At high concentrations (greater than 20 microM), adenosine rendered nodal cells inexcitable. In isolated perfused hearts (n = 7), adenosine (5.7 microM) prolonged total AV conduction time by 21 +/- 2 msec. Of this prolongation, 83% was due to an increase in the nodal-to-His-bundle interval and the remaining 17% to an increase in the atrionodal to nodal interval. Infusion of adenosine to cause a 50% increase (EC50) in atria-to-His bundle (AH) interval prolongation resulted in a perfusate (arterial) adenosine concentration of 5.0 +/- 0.6 microM and effluent (venous) adenosine concentrations of 2.8 +/- 0.4 microM, i.e., an arteriovenous difference of 44% (n = 4). When adenosine uptake and deamination were inhibited with dipyridamole (0.5 microM) plus erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine (5 microM), respectively, the EC50s were 0.28 +/- 0.02 (perfusate) and 0.32 +/- 0.03 microM (effluent). These data indicate that when nucleoside metabolism is inhibited, arterial and venous concentrations of adenosine reach equilibrium. In an additional 10 hearts, the following rank order of potency of adenosine agonists in causing AH interval prolongation was found: N6-cyclopentyladenosine greater than N6-(L-2-phenyl-isopropyl)adenosine greater than 5'-N-ethylcarboxyamidoadenosine greater than or equal to 2-chloroadenosine greater than adenosine, which is compatible with activation of an A1-type receptor. In summary: the site of adenosine-induced AV conduction block is the nodal zone of the AV node, when adenosine uptake and deamination are inhibited, adenosine in concentrations similar to that released by hypoxia causes significant AH interval prolongation, and the adenosine receptor mediating the negative dromotropic effect of adenosine is of the A1-type.\r"

  ".W": "Adenosine as well as hypoxia and ischemia are known to cause atrioventricular conduction block. To test the hypothesis that adenosine is the primary mediator of hypoxia-induced atrioventricular conduction delay in isolated perfused guinea pig hearts, we characterized a) the time courses of hypoxia-induced adenosine release and delay in atrioventricular conduction, b) the relationships between oxygen tension, adenosine concentration in the effluent, and atria-to-His-bundle interval, and c) the adenosine receptor mediating the negative dromotropic effect of hypoxia. Oxygen tension and effluent adenosine levels were linearly related with a correlation coefficient (r) of -0.85 and a slope of -6.3 +/- 0.37 pmol/min/g/torr. Likewise, oxygen tension and atria-to-His-bundle interval prolongation were linearly related with r = -0.85 and a slope of -0.180 +/- 0.013 msec/torr. The EC50 of effluent adenosine in causing atria-to-His-bundle prolongation was 0.26 +/- 0.02 microM. Adenosine deaminase, an enzyme that deaminates adenosine to inosine and is limited to the extracellular space, significantly attenuated (61%) the atria-to-His-bundle interval prolongation caused by hypoxia. This prolongation was further reduced (81%) by a combination of adenosine deaminase and theophylline, an adenosine receptor blocker. Adenosine deaminase also reduced (by 95%) the atria-to-His-bundle interval prolongation in normoxic recipient hearts caused by the effluent of hypoxic donor hearts. Several adenosine antagonists, i.e., theophylline, 8-phenyltheophylline, and 8-(p-sulfophenyl)theophylline antagonized in a dose-dependent manner the negative dromotropic effect of exogenous adenosine and hypoxia. Schild analysis of the antagonism of hypoxia-induced atria-to-His-bundle interval prolongation by 8-(p-sulfophenyl)theophylline yielded the following pA2 values: 5.30 +/- 0.25 and 5.28 +/- 0.31 using oxygen tension and effluent adenosine vs. AH interval prolongation, respectively. 8-(p-Sulfophenyl)theophylline also antagonized to an equal extent atria-to-His-bundle interval prolongations of similar magnitude caused either by adenosine or hypoxia. We conclude that 1) adenosine is the primary mediator of hypoxia-induced atrioventricular conduction delay, and 2) the adenosine receptor that mediates the negative dromotropic effect of hypoxia is similar to that of exogenous adenosine.\r"

  ".W": "Voltage-clamp experiments were performed on isolated single frog (Rana catesbeiana or Rana pipiens) atrial cells to determine the voltage-contraction relations of the single cardiac cell. The contractile responses of the single cell associated with long duration (3 second) depolarizing steps consisted of a rise to peak (phasic) followed by a decay to a sustained contraction (tonic). These phasic-tonic type contractile responses could be obtained under conditions where membrane potential was well controlled along the entire length of the cell. Thus, the data obtained on the single cell indicate that the phasic-tonic contractile response is the characteristic contractile response of frog atrial tissue. The voltage dependence of the extent of relaxation to the tonic component following the peak of the contraction was affected dramatically by the intracellular sodium concentration. This result indicates that both the relaxation following peak contraction as well as the tonic contraction are related to calcium control via the sodium-calcium exchanger. The data also indicate that calcium entry via the inward calcium current is required for the contractile response to have a phasic component. These data indicate that calcium entry via the inward calcium current followed by the sodium-calcium exchanger first reducing and then maintaining the intracellular calcium level produces the characteristic phasic-tonic contractile response.\r"

We observed a shift of the ventricular isomyosin of adult spontaneously hypertensive (H) rats of both sexes to the V3 form and a decreased myofibrillar ATPase activity in the H animals when compared to normotensive (N) controls. Compared to the male H rats, age-matched female H animals revealed a lower blood pressure, the same or even an elevated magnitude of cardiac hypertrophy, a different ventricular isomyosin pattern, and a higher myofibrillar ATPase activity. In female H rats the V1 and V3 isomyosins were equally distributed (35% V1 and 35% V3), but in male H animals the V3 was predominant (24% V1 and 45% V3). The Ca2+-regulated Mg2+-dependent myofibrillar ATPase of the rat ventricle correlated positively with the amount of V1 when measured at pCa 5 (maximum activation). At submaximum Ca2+-concentrations (pCa 6.9-5.9) the myofibrillar ATPase activities were not changed with the proportion of V1. The cooperativity of the Ca2+-activation of the myofibrillar ATPase increased with increasing amount of V1 (Hill-coefficient 3.7 with 100% V1) and decreased with increased proportion of V3 (Hill-coefficient 1.3 at 45% V3). Two myosin isoenzymes were detected in the aorta of rats, a slow migrating (S2) and a fast migrating (S1) form having both a higher mobility than the ventricular isomyosins. Only one band was observed in the portal vein, which revealed the same mobility as S2. Hypertension did not change the appearance of these vascular smooth muscle isomyosins neither in male nor in female animals.\r"

  ".W": "Whether large coronary artery dilation induced by beta-adrenergic stimulation is mediated by beta 1- or beta 2-adrenergic receptors remains controversial. This problem is particularly difficult to address in vivo due to the concomitant increase in coronary blood flow with beta-adrenergic stimulation, which by itself can dilate large coronary arteries. To reconcile this problem, 5 calves were instrumented with intraaortic and intracoronary (i.c.) catheters, ultrasonic diameter transducers, Doppler flow transducers, and hydraulic occluders on the left circumflex coronary artery. Two to six weeks following surgery, beta-adrenergic agonists were administered i.c. to avoid complicating systemic effects. Isoproterenol (0.0025 micrograms/kg, a beta 1 + beta 2-adrenergic agonist) increased coronary diameter (7.1 +/- 0.8% from 5.80 +/- 0.58 mm) (p less than 0.01). Similar increases (p less than 0.01) in coronary diameter occurred with prenalterol (0.4 micrograms/kg, beta 1-adrenergic agonist) (9.5 +/- 1.4%) and pirbuterol (0.25 micrograms/kg, beta 2-adrenergic agonist) (8.1 +/- 1.2%). When coronary blood flow was prevented from rising with the hydraulic constrictor, increases in coronary diameter to all three beta-adrenergic agonists were not attenuated. Large coronary artery dilation with prenalterol and pirbuterol was abolished with beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor blockade, respectively, while neither beta 1- nor beta 2-adrenergic blockade alone abolished the large coronary artery dilation with isoproterenol. To identify the predominant subtype of beta-adrenergic receptor, competitive inhibition curves utilizing 125I-cyanopindolol (125I-CYP) as the radiolabel versus isoproterenol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine were generated in membrane preparations from calf heart (predominant beta 1), calf lung (predominant beta 2) and calf coronary artery. The coronary artery membrane preparations demonstrated an intermediate pattern. Competition curves with selective beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor agonists and antagonists again demonstrated a pattern for coronary artery intermediate to that of heart and lung, further confirming the presence of both beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes in large coronary arteries, with a ratio of beta 1: beta 2 of 1.5-2.0:1.0. Thus, large coronary arteries of the calf contain both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors identified utilizing ligand binding techniques, and stimulation of both receptor subtypes in the intact conscious animal results in large coronary artery dilation, independent of blood-flow-mediated vasodilation.\r"

  ".W": "To test whether extracellular adenosine participates in the local regulation of intestinal blood flow during nutrient absorption, the serosa of the jejunum was continuously suffused with adenosine deaminase (7 micrograms protein/ml) or theophylline (10(-4) M) in Ringer's solution. Using video microscopy, blood flow was calculated in submucosal arterioles from diameter and red cell velocity measurements. After a steady-state baseline, oleic acid (20 mM) + glucose (56 mM) were added to a bile salt solution suffusing the mucosa. Baseline arteriolar diameters and blood flows were 52 +/- 2 micron and 20 +/- 2 nl/sec with the serosal suffusate containing Ringer's; these values were not significantly altered by theophylline or deaminase treatment. During suffusion of the mucosa with a nutrient solution, diameter and blood flow transiently increased and these responses were not altered by deaminase or theophylline. Thereafter, diameter and blood flow stabilized at lower values for the duration of absorption. Diameter and blood flow were increased to 111 +/- 1% and 134 +/- 5% of control during absorption with Ringer's; the corresponding values were significantly lower with deaminase or theophylline. After absorption, diameter and blood flow stabilized near baseline with Ringer's within 7-12 minutes; the corresponding values were significantly lower with deaminase or theophylline for at least 30 minutes. Since deaminase and theophylline produced similar effects on absorptive hyperemia, adenosine might participate with other factors in the local regulation of that response. Adenosine applied to the serosa caused dose-dependent increases in calculated blood flow with a threshold near 10(-5) M and a maximum near 10(-3) M. In contrast, even 10(-2) M adenosine in the mucosal suffusate did not increase blood flow above baseline.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Echocardiographic measures of heart size, obtained according to the recommendations of the American Society for Echocardiography, were compared across the entire systolic and diastolic blood pressure distributions. Echocardiographic indexes of left heart size varied as a function of both blood pressure levels and body size. Significant positive correlations were present between systolic blood pressure and different measures of left ventricular size. Left ventricular wall thickness in systole correlated with systolic blood pressure (r = .42, p less than .0001), and persistence of this relationship was noted after adjustment for body size. Left ventricular wall thickness in diastole correlated with blood pressure before adjustment (r = .31, p less than .0001), but the relationship was not significant after adjustment for body size. The ratio of left ventricular thickness to chamber size (systole) correlated with systolic blood pressure levels both before and after adjustment for body size (r = .20 and r = .22, p less than .001). Male subjects of both races demonstrated significantly higher adjusted left ventricular mass, left ventricular wall thickness, and left ventricular chamber size. Adjusted left ventricular wall stress was significantly related to both systolic (r = .14) and diastolic blood pressure levels (r = .14, p less than .001). Measures of left ventricular wall thickness increased throughout the entire blood pressure distribution, indicating a consistent trend rather than a threshold effect seen only in the highest blood pressure groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purposes of this study were: (1) to analyze left ventricular mechanics, including regional wall motion, in infants with ALCA, (2) to determine if the pattern of wall motion in infants with ALCA distinguishes these patients from those with congestive cardiomyopathy of other causes, and (3) to evaluate the potential for recovery of left ventricular function after successful restoration of a dual coronary artery system. Left ventricular mechanics were studied before and serially after surgery in six infants (2 to 13 months old) with ALCA. Fifteen age-matched normal subjects and seven age-matched patients with idiopathic congestive cardiomyopathy were also studied for comparison. Preoperatively, the end-diastolic volume in infants with ALCA was about four times larger than normal and did not differ from that in infants with CM; the myocardial volume was also about three times larger than normal, similar to that in the patients with CM. The myocardial volume/end-diastolic volume ratio was extremely low in patients with ALCA and in those with CM. The infants with ALCA did not exhibit specific segmental wall motion abnormalities but rather had global hypokinesis indistinguishable from that in the patients with CM. After successful repair, end-diastolic volume index rapidly decreased, reaching near normal values by 7 to 22 months after surgery, while myocardial volume index decreased at a slower rate, leading to an early phase of \"overshoot hypertrophy,\" but reaching normal values by 7 to 22 months after surgery.+\r"

Stepwise logistic regression analysis resulted in rejection of an association between coronary artery disease and HDL cholesterol, plasma triglyceride, VLDL triglyceride, or LDL triglyceride.

The data reveal a prominent circadian variation of sudden cardiac death, with a low incidence during the night and an increased incidence from 7 to 11 A.M. The pattern is remarkably similar to that reported for nonfatal myocardial infarction and episodes of myocardial ischemia. The finding that the frequency of sudden cardiac death is increased in the morning is compatible with hypotheses that sudden cardiac death results from ischemia or from a primary arrhythmic event. Further study of the physiologic changes occurring in the morning may provide new information supporting or refuting these hypotheses, thereby leading to increased understanding and possible prevention of sudden cardiac death.\r"

Therefore, we performed electrocardiographically gated radionuclide ventriculography with a respiratory gating technique in nine healthy subjects during quiet breathing and during expiration against a 24 cm H2O expiratory threshold load. During expiration, respiratory loading caused an increase in stroke counts by 29.4% (p less than .001) due to an increase in end-diastolic counts of 26.1% (p less than .001). End-systolic counts also rose 18.8% (p less than .05). The ejection fraction did not change significantly. These findings indicate that the increase in left ventricular stroke volume that occurs during the first 1 or 2 beats of a loaded expiration is due to an increase in left ventricular filling and not to augmentation of left ventricular ejection. This immediate increase in pulmonary venous return may reflect increased distensibility of the left ventricle due to decreased filling of the right ventricle.\r"

Five (25%) of 20 patients in the placebo group and 14 (73.7%) of 19 patients with confirmed infarction in the timolol group developed a left ventricular apical thrombus as detected by two-dimensional echocardiography from 2 to 10 days after inclusion (p less than .005). Patients received anticoagulants only after a left ventricular thrombus had been diagnosed. Only one patient with thrombus suffered peripheral embolization (timolol group). The treatment groups were comparable with respect to location of regional left ventricular dysfunction, electrocardiographic changes, and infarct size estimated by creatine kinase release. However, computer-assisted regional wall motion analysis demonstrated significantly reduced apical wall motion in the timolol group compared with the placebo group (p less than .01). Also, the mean heart rate during the first 10 days after the acute infarction was reduced by 13% in the timolol group (p less than .001). The reduction in heart rate and left ventricular apical wall motion caused by timolol in patients with acute anterior myocardial infarction may increase the occurrence of left ventricular thrombi.\r"

The ratio of circulating platelet aggregates, platelet aggregation to increasing concentrations of ADP (0.455 to 1.82 micrograms/ml), and platelet thromboxane B2 production in vitro were also tested. The two groups of patients were statistically similar in terms of sex distribution, age, presence of risk factors, use of medication, extent of coronary artery disease and history of previous myocardial infarction. Mean plasma levels of fibrinopeptide A were 2.7 +/- 0.4 ng/ml (geometric means +/- SEM, range 1.5 to 5.5) in patients with stable angina vs 5.5 +/- 1.8 ng/ml (range 2.4 to 32; p less than .001) in those with unstable angina. In the latter group, after 6 to 8 days, fibrinopeptide A levels decreased to 3.6 +/- 0.5 ng/ml (range 1.5 to 9.3; p less than .04 vs admission). All other variables measured were statistically identical in the two groups. We conclude that plasma fibrinopeptide A levels, as opposed to platelet factors, discriminate between patients with unstable and stable angina, indicating an activation of the coagulation system in unstable angina.\r"

Twenty-five patients were found to have limited flow reserve during rapid atrial pacing after administration of 0.15 to 0.30 mg iv ergonovine, associated with precipitation of chest pain and hemodynamic and metabolic evidence of myocardial ischemia. No significant narrowing occurred in epicardial coronary artery luminal diameter. An additional 15 patients had no chest pain during pacing; because they developed significantly higher great cardiac vein flow and lower coronary resistance they were considered to have normal vasodilator reserve. After administration of dipyridamole (0.5 to 0.75 mg/kg iv), the lowest absolute levels to which coronary resistance fell (0.79 +/- 0.23 vs 0.47 +/- 0.12 mm Hg X min/ml; p less than .001) and the maximal absolute levels to which great cardiac vein flow rose (134 +/- 34 vs 202 +/- 45 ml/min; p less than .001) were impaired in the 25 patients with ergonovine-induced flow limitation compared with the 15 patients without flow limitation after ergonovine. In addition, 18 of the 25 patients with limited flow reserve after dipyridamole experienced chest pain despite an increase in coronary flow. In these patients, dipyridamole-induced increased flow across small prearteriolar coronary arteries, which were narrowed because of abnormal tonus or sensitivity to vasoconstrictor stimuli, could have resulted in a transmural redistribution of blood flow away from the subendocardium, precipitating subendocardial ischemia. These studies suggest that patients with anginal chest pain despite normal epicardial coronary arteries may have exaggerated coronary responses to vasoconstrictor stimuli, which can result in myocardial ischemia during stress, as well as attenuated responses to coronary vasodilator stimuli.\r"

Sixty-five patients had no mitral regurgitation by both color Doppler and angiography and 82 patients had mitral regurgitation by both techniques. Thus the sensitivity and specificity of color Doppler for the detection of mitral regurgitation was 100%. Three two-dimensional echocardiographic planes (parasternal long and short axis, apical four-chamber view) were used to analyze variables of the mitral regurgitant jet signals in the left atrium. The best correlation with angiography was obtained when the regurgitant jet area (RJA) (maximum or average from three planes) expressed as a percentage of the left atrial area (LAA) obtained in the same plane as the maximum regurgitant area was considered. The maximum RJA/LAA was under 20% in 34 of 36 patients with angiographic grade I mitral regurgitation, between 20% and 40% in 17 of 18 patients with grade II mitral regurgitation, and over 40% in 26 of 28 patients with severe mitral regurgitation. Maximum RJA/LAA also correlated with angiographic regurgitant fractions (r = .78) obtained in 21 of 40 patients in normal sinus rhythm and with no evidence of associated aortic regurgitation. Other variables of the regurgitant jet such as maximal linear and transverse dimensions, maximal area, or maximal area expressed as a percentage of the LAA in one or two planes correlated less well with angiography. Color Doppler is a useful noninvasive technique that is not only highly sensitive and specific in the identification of mitral regurgitation but also provides accurate estimation of its severity.\r"

A 1.5 to 2 hr rest period was permitted between exercise tests, each of which consisted of a symptom-limited constant speed (3.0 mph) Balke protocol with 2 min stages commencing at 0.0% grade with increments of 2.5% at end of each stage. Compared with findings during fixed-rate VVI pacing, VVI-Act pacing was associated with greater exercise-induced positive chronotropic response (mean maximum heart rate VVI-Act 128 +/- 15.3 beats/min vs VVI 90 +/- 28.4 beats/min; p less than .01), prolongation of exercise duration (VVI-Act 10.2 +/- 3.8 min vs VVI 7.7 +/- 2.5 min; p less than .01), increased peak oxygen consumption (VVI-Act 1617 +/- 656 ml O2/min vs VVI 1325 +/- 451 ml O2/min; p less than .01), and onset of anaerobic threshold at a higher oxygen consumption (VVI-Act 1208 +/- 343 ml O2/min vs VVI 1064 +/- 377 ml O2/min: p less than .01). Additionally, of 44 comparable exercise stages tested in the two pacing modes, perceived exertion (assessed by a numerical grading system) was lower in 38 of 44 instances during VVI-Act compared with VVI pacing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Preliminary reports have documented the utility of balloon aortic valvuloplasty as a palliative treatment for high-risk patients with critical aortic stenosis, but the effect of this procedure on cardiac performance has not been studied in detail. Accordingly, 32 patients (mean age 79 years) with long-standing, calcific aortic stenosis were treated at the time of cardiac catheterization with balloon dilatation of the aortic valve, and serial changes in left ventricular and valvular function were followed before and after valvuloplasty by radionuclide ventriculography, determination of systolic time intervals, and Doppler echocardiography. Prevalvuloplasty examination revealed heavily calcified aortic valves in all patients, a mean peak-to-peak aortic valve gradient of 77 +/- 27 mm Hg, a mean Fick cardiac output of 4.6 +/- 1.4 liters/min, and a mean calculated aortic valve area of 0.6 +/- 0.2 cm2. Subsequent balloon dilatation with 12 to 23 mm valvuloplasty balloons resulted in a fall in aortic valve gradient to 39 +/- 15 mm Hg, an increase in cardiac output to 5.2 +/- 1.8 liters/min, and an increase in calculated aortic valve area to 0.9 +/- 0.3 cm2. Individual hemodynamic responses varied considerably, with some patients showing major increases in valve area, while others demonstrated only small increases. In no case was balloon dilatation accompanied by evidence of embolic phenomena. Supravalvular aortography obtained in 13 patients demonstrated no or a mild (less than or equal to 1+) increase in aortic insufficiency. Serial radionuclide ventriculography in patients with a depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (i.e., that less than or equal to 55%) revealed a small increase in ejection fraction from 40 +/- 13% to 46 +/- 12% (p less than .03). In addition, for the study group as a whole there was a decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (113 +/- 38 to 101 +/- 37 ml/m2, p less than .003), a fall in stroke-volume ratio (1.49 +/- 0.44 to 1.35 +/- 0.33, p less than .04), and no immediate change in left ventricular peak filling rate (2.05 +/- 0.77 to 2.21 +/- 0.65 end-diastolic counts/sec, p = NS). Serial M mode echocardiography and phonocardiography showed an increase in aortic valve excursion (0.5 +/- 0.2 to 0.8 +/- 0.2 cm, p less than .001), a decrease in time to one-half carotid upstroke (80 +/- 30 to 60 +/- 10 msec, p less than .001), and a small decrease in left ventricular ejection time (0.44 +/- 0.03 to 0.42 +/- 0.02 sec, p less than .001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

All subjects were randomly assigned to a double-blind, placebo controlled, Latin-square design study in which five 1 week periods of drug or placebo administration were separated by 2 week washout periods. Laboratory evaluations were conducted at the end of each treatment period, and included multistage exercise stress testing; questionnaire assessments of mood state, sexual function, and sleep habits; tests of psychomotor function; and overnight polysomnographic measures of sleep. Significant effects on sleep continuity were observed for each of the lipophilic drugs, as reflected in the number of awakenings (pindolol = 6.4 +/- 5.0; propranolol = 6.3 +/- 3.2; metoprolol = 7.2 +/- 4.7; atenolol = 3.6 +/- 2.9; placebo = 3.9 +/- 2.7) and time of wakefulness (pindolol = 20.6 +/- 27.0 min; propranolol = 15.5 +/- 23.0 min; metoprolol = 19.5 +/- 24.3 min; atenolol = 10.2 +/- 11.6 min; placebo = 9.2 +/- 74.5 min). Only pindolol significantly affected rapid eye movement (REM) sleep time (pindolol = 54.5 +/- 21.9 min; placebo = 74.5 +/- 74.5 min) and REM latency (pindolol = 175.0 +/- 60.7 min; placebo = 95.4 +/- 43.8 min).

We investigated effects of norepinephrine (11 dogs) and isoproterenol (seven dogs) on the pulmonary vascular PAP-CO relationship in a model of pulmonary hypertension produced by injection of autologous blood clots. Multiple PAP-CO coordinates were obtained with and without drug infusion. CO was varied by opening systemic arteriovenous fistulas. PAP-CO relationships were well described by a linear equation (mean r value .964 +/- .032). Isoproterenol increased mean CO by 61% (p less than .01), and calculated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) decreased by 31% (p less than .05), corresponding to a 35% decrease (5.1 +/- 2.0 to 3.3 +/- 0.9 mm Hg X liter X min-1; p less than .01) incremental resistance. In the first seven dogs to receive norepinephrine, despite a 25% increase in blood pressure (p less than .01) no significant effects on CO, PAP, PVR, or PAP-CO relationship were observed. In the next four dogs, norepinephrine was infused at a lower dose to increase blood pressure 50% and a higher dose to ensure an increase in CO. In both conditions, calculated PVR fell (p less than .05) compared with that before norepinephrine. However, measured incremental resistance and effective outflow pressure did not change.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To investigate the possible role of platelets in arterial spasm following arterial injury induced by angioplasty, quantitative platelet deposition of the dilated arterial segment and the degree of vasoconstriction (average percent diameter narrowing just proximal and distal to the dilated segment) produced during angioplasty of the common carotid arteries were studied in 42 heparinized normal pigs that were killed immediately after the angioplasty procedure. Angiographic films of the carotid arteries were taken before and after the dilatation to assess the vasoconstriction. Vasoconstriction was greater (40% vs 19%, p less than .002) when platelet deposition (X 10(6)/cm2) was in excess of 10, and the severity of vasoconstriction in vivo had a close positive exponential correlation (r = .77, p less than .001) with extent of platelet deposition in 24 untreated pigs. Platelet deposition and vasoconstriction were greater with severe arterial wall injury than with mild injury (58.8 versus 6.9, p less than .0001; 37% vs 21%, p less than .001, respectively). After severe injury in 18 pigs pretreated with 1 mg/kg/day aspirin, platelet deposition decreased (from 58.8 to 19.6, p less than .02) and vasoconstriction decreased (from 37% to 21%, p less than .003) relative to control. After mild injury, platelet deposition and vasoconstriction were mild and unchanged by aspirin. Thus, local vasoconstriction is influenced by the degree of platelet deposition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Fourteen mongrel dogs of both sexes were studied. The animals were instrumented for the recording of electrocardiogram, arterial blood pressure, and left circumflex coronary arterial blood flow. A critical level of coronary stenosis was achieved with an adjustable occluder placed just distal to the flow probe. Anger was induced in the instrumented animals by having another dog challenge their access to food. In the absence of coronary artery stenosis, provocation of anger increased heart rate from 107 +/- 6 to 215 +/- 15 beats/min, arterial blood pressure from 95 +/- 4 to 142 +/- 5 mm Hg, and coronary blood flow from 31 +/- 5 to 72 +/- 9 ml/min. These variables returned to the preanger levels within 2 to 4 min. Induction of anger was repeated after a critical stenosis was applied to the left circumflex coronary artery. Anger increased heart rate from 112 +/- 6 to 210 +/- 16 beats/min, arterial blood pressure from 99 +/- 3 to 142 +/- 6 mm Hg, and coronary arterial flow from 23 +/- 5 to 35 +/- 7 ml/min. Within 2 to 4 min after the bout of anger, all dogs exhibited significant reductions in coronary arterial flow (35% of baseline; p less than .001), increases in coronary vascular resistance (557% of baseline; p less than .002), and ischemic ST segment changes in leads II, III, and aVF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Five regions may be distinguished, each of which contributes mesenchyme to pharyngeal (branchial) arches 1 through 4 and 6. Ablation of arch 3, 4, and 6 regions resulted in a high incidence of persistent truncus arteriosus (PTA) associated with anomalies of the aortic arch. Dextroposed aorta (DPA) or anomalies of the inflow tract were found in all ablation groups. Although anomalies of the aortic arch arteries were induced in all ablation groups and were usually associated with intracardiac anomalies, those of the third and right fourth aortic arch were most frequent in the arch 4 and arch 4 + 6 groups. Anomalies of the sixth aortic arch were most frequent after extensive ablations that included the arch 6 region. We speculate that PTA is a direct result of the decreased population of mesenchymal cells derived from the arch 3 through 6 neural crest regions. DPA or anomalies of the inflow tract may be related to altered hemodynamics due to anomalies induced by neural crest ablation. Anomalies of the aortic arch arteries may be caused by either the direct or indirect process.\r"

To evaluate the pharmacologic actions of the metabolite, we gave single intravenous doses (10 or 25 mg/kg) of amiodarone or desethylamiodarone to anesthetized dogs. The resulting plasma and myocardial concentrations of both agents were similar to levels achieved with long-term oral amiodarone therapy in man. Amiodarone and desethylamiodarone produced frequency-dependent slowing in ventricular and atrioventricular nodal conduction and increased atrial and ventricular refractory periods. The relative effects of these agents on fast- and slow-channel tissues differed, with amiodarone producing significantly greater prolongation of Wenckebach cycle length and desethylamiodarone producing larger increases in QRS duration, atrial refractory period, and ventricular refractory period. We conclude that desethylamiodarone has substantial electrophysiologic effects at clinically relevant concentrations and has relatively greater effect on fast-channel tissue in vivo than does amiodarone. The accumulation of desethylamiodarone probably accounts for some of the delayed electrophysiologic effects in patients receiving long-term treatment with amiodarone.\r"

In two other dogs a cylindrical probe (40 X 3 mm) was used. Electrical stimuli were delivered at 66 endocardial, midwall, or epicardial sites in the left and right ventricular walls and the septum. Mechanical stimuli were also applied at various epicardial sites. On-line mapping of equipotential contour lines on the surface of the probe invariably revealed a clear-cut potential minimum on the electrode that faced the pacing site. Time of appearance of potential minimum was 3 to 5 msec after endocardial stimuli, 10 to 25 msec for midwall and epicardial pacing, and 30 msec or more for right ventricular stimulation. Simultaneous stimulation at two sites 1.2 cm apart gave rise to two separate minima on the maps. \"Pseudoisochrones\" derived from electrograms recorded by the new probe were slightly less accurate in indicating the site of origin of extrasystoles. We conclude that equipotential and \"isochrone\" contour maps recorded from an array of semidirect electrodes, regularly distributed on the surface of an intraventricular probe, provide information on the site of origin (location and intramural depth) of ectopic paced beats in a normal dog heart.\r"

  ".W": "It has been suggested that the beneficial effects of reperfusing ischemic myocardium might be in part reversed by the occurrence of \"reperfusion injury.\" One possible mechanism could be the generation of oxygen free radicals. Superoxide dismutase enzymatically scavenges superoxide radicals by dismutation to hydrogen peroxide. This study tested the hypothesis that administration of recombinant human superoxide dismutase (h-SOD) at the time of reflow after a period of prolonged global ischemia would result in improved recovery of myocardial metabolism and function by preventing or reducing a potentially harmful component of reperfusion. We also sought to determine whether catalase, an enzymatic scavenger of hydrogen peroxide, was a necessary addition for optimal benefit. Langendorff perfused rabbit hearts were subjected to 30 min of normothermic (37 degrees C) total global ischemia. At the moment of reperfusion, 12 control hearts received a 10 ml bolus of normal perfusate followed by 15 min of reperfusion with normal perfusate (group I), 12 hearts received 60,000 IU of h-SOD as a bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 100 IU/ml for 15 min (group II), and 12 hearts received 60,000 IU of h-SOD and 60,000 IU of catalase as a bolus followed by 100 IU/ml of both enzymes for 15 min (group III). Myocardial ATP and phosphocreatine (PCr) content and intracellular pH during ischemia and reperfusion were continuously monitored with 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. During 30 min of normothermic global ischemia intracellular pH dropped from 7.11-7.18 to 5.58-5.80 in all three groups of hearts. Likewise myocardial PCr content fell rapidly to 7% to 8% and ATP fell more slowly to 29% to 36% of preischemic control content. After 45 min of reperfusion PCr recovered to 65 +/- 5% of control in untreated (group I) hearts compared with 89 +/- 8% in h-SOD-treated (group II) hearts (p less than .01 vs group I) and with 83 +/- 6% of control in h-SOD/catalase-treated (group III) hearts (p less than .05 vs group I). Recovery of isovolumic left ventricular developed pressure was 68 +/- 5% of control in h-SOD-treated (group II) hearts and 66 +/- 6% of control in h-SOD/catalase-treated (group III) hearts after 45 min of reflow, compared with 48 +/- 6% of control in untreated (group I) hearts (p less than .005 for groups II and III vs group I).

New Zealand white rabbits were fed a 2% cholesterol-enriched diet for 3 days (plasma cholesterol 329 +/- 70 mg/dl), or maintained on the control diet (plasma cholesterol 67 +/- 12 mg/dl). Temporary (30 min) coronary artery occlusion was performed in open-chest rabbits with a suture snare. The snare was released to permit reperfusion. When the animals were killed 5.5 hr later, left ventricles were cut into 3 mm slices. Infarct size was determined by planimetry of tetrazolium-stained slices while the area at risk of infarction (hypoperfused zone) was determined by planimetry of the \"cold spots\" on autoradiograms of the slices that contained 99m Tc-labeled microspheres that had been injected 1 min after occlusion. Infarct size, expressed as percent of the hypoperfused zone, was 42.8 +/- 1.3% (n = 10) in the control group and was increased by approximately 100% in cholesterol-fed animals to 83.7 +/- 2.0% (n = 10, p less than .001). To test the hypothesis that vascular obstruction (no reflow) might account for the larger infarct size, thioflavin S was injected immediately before the animals were killed to demarcate perfused myocardium in three additional groups of animals: standard chow-fed rabbits (n = 5), cholesterol-fed rabbits (n = 5), and standard chow-fed rabbits that, in addition, received an infusion of isoproterenol (0.1 microgram/kg/min, n = 6), an intervention believed to increase infarct size through a mechanism not dependent on the no-reflow phenomenon.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We studied the effect of very early reperfusion with myocardial salvage and \"late\" reperfusion without myocardial salvage on infarct expansion and aneurysm formation. Sixty-eight rats underwent left coronary artery ligation and were randomized to 30 min reperfusion, 2 hr reperfusion, or permanent coronary artery ligation. The animals were killed and the hearts examined at 2 weeks. Thirty minute reperfusion reduced infarct size, extent of transmurality, and infarct expansion. Two hour reperfusion reduced neither infarct size nor transmurality but inhibited infarct expansion. The results of this study in the rat preparation suggest a beneficial effect of \"late\" reperfusion on infarct expansion independent of myocardial salvage. If these results are confirmed in human beings, the period after myocardial infarction during which a patient can be considered for thrombolytic therapy or reperfusion by percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty could be greatly prolonged.\r"

Adrenergic coronary vasoconstriction was observed to operate even in the presence of coronary stenosis to limit oxygen delivery to the heart and increase myocardial oxygen extraction, but this vasoconstrictor effect did not result in myocardial lactate production. During constant coronary pressure perfusion the transmural distribution of alpha-receptor coronary vasoconstriction was determined with microspheres. A uniform transmural distribution of alpha-receptor-mediated vasoconstriction was observed at normal and subnormal perfusion pressures. During constant flow hypoperfusion, which permits transmural coronary steal, the left ventricular inner/outer blood flow ratio was more favorable with alpha-receptors intact than with alpha-receptors blocked. These findings indicate that alpha-receptor-mediated coronary vasoconstriction has an unexpected beneficial effect by lessening transmural steal during coronary hypoperfusion.\r"

Eight weeks of DOC/salt administration induced a significant increase in aortic smooth muscle cells with tetraploid nuclei from 9.7 +/- 0.8% (mean +/- SE) in control animals to 26.6 +/- 2.4% with DOC/salt. The tetraploid cells appeared approximately 60% larger in size than diploid cells as estimated by forward light scatter. Prolonged reversal of hypertension by withdrawal of DOC/salt for 3 months did not reduce nuclear tetraploidy significantly but appeared to prevent further increases. The results suggest that hypertension influences the growth cycle of aortic smooth muscle cells and increases nuclear polyploidy and cellular hypertrophy. Preliminary studies have also been performed to measure transmembrane potential in isolated viable aortic smooth muscle cells with a lipophilic cationic fluoroprobe, 3,3 dipentyloxacarbocyanine, which distributes into cells in a potential-dependent manner. Norepinephrine (10(-6)M to 10(-3)M) appeared to produce a concentration-dependent reduction in membrane potential that was blocked by equimolar concentrations of prazosin but not of yohimbine. The studies suggest that norepinephrine can cause depolarization of smooth muscle cells through an alpha 1-mediated mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "Acute increases in arterial blood pressure, beyond the autoregulatory capacity of cerebral blood vessels, produce an increase in cerebral blood flow, passive dilatation of cerebral arterioles and venules, and disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Stimulation of sympathetic nerves during acute hypertension attenuates the increase in cerebral blood flow and protects the BBB. It has been assumed that the protective effect of sympathetic stimulation is accomplished by constriction of large cerebral arteries, protecting downstream arterioles and capillaries. We have found, however, that sympathetic stimulation does not attenuate increases in pial arteriolar pressure accompanying acute hypertension. We now suggest that the protective effect of sympathetic stimulation may be accomplished by attenuation of increases in pial venous pressure. In chronic hypertension, blood pressure is sufficiently elevated that one might expect an increase in cerebral blood flow and disruption of the BBB. However, cerebral blood flow is normal and the BBB is intact in chronic hypertension. Protection of the cerebral circulation during chronic hypertension is accomplished in part by a trophic effect of sympathetic nerves, which promotes hypertrophy of cerebral blood vessels. Vascular hypertrophy attenuates increases in microvascular pressure accompanying hypertension. Thus, stimulation of sympathetic nerves protects cerebral vessels during acute hypertension, perhaps by attenuation of increases in cerebral venous pressure, and a trophic effect of sympathetic nerves promotes vascular hypertrophy and protects cerebral vessels during chronic hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Over the past several years, a growing body of information has confirmed and extended our initial concept that nonhemodynamic as well as hemodynamic factors are responsible for the development of left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertension. We reported the dissociation of these factors in the regression of left ventricular mass and hypertrophy with antihypertensive therapy. Several lines of clinical and experimental studies have been pursued to determine whether cardiac performance, myocardial contractility, and reserve are normal with regression of ventricular mass with treatment. Too few studies have been conducted in vivo, and in the conscious state, and at pretreatment pressures to conclude at this time that normal cardiac function and performance is restored or maintained. Until such data are available, we must conclude that although left ventricular hypertrophy confers a risk, in and of itself, to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, we do not know whether pharmacologic reversal of cardiac hypertrophy is a desirable therapeutic goal. Several years ago we were convinced that a new and impressive body of information emanating mostly from our laboratories strongly indicated a new concept previously unexpressed by others. We suggested that increasing ventricular mass in hypertension (i.e., left ventricular hypertrophy), although dependent in part on arterial pressure and other hemodynamic factors, was also dependent on participation of a number of \"nonhemodynamic\" mechanisms. Our early findings, supported by associated reports, suggested that in addition to left ventricular afterload, factors including other pressor mechanisms (e.g., adrenergic function and norepinephrine levels, humoral substances, the renopressor system), aging, race, gender, coexisting diseases, pharmacologic agents, and others may also participate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These different modalities of exercise were used to test the hypothesis that endurance training leads to capillary proliferation in the heart. The findings indicate that treadmill running produces right ventricular hypertrophy exclusively, which is accompanied by lengthening of the myocytes. Furthermore, a moderate running program results in an increase in the numerical density, luminal surface, and total length of capillaries in the right ventricle. In contrast, strenuous exercise with or without a preconditioning period produces a relative decrease in capillary luminal volume, surface, and numerical density. In the former case the diffusion distance for oxygen is decreased and in the latter it is increased. These data suggest that moderate exercise affects the microvasculature in ways that improve the efficiency of tissue oxygenation in the myocardium, whereas strenuous exercise has the opposite effect.\r"

This report summarizes the significance of the disturbance in baroreceptor function that is associated with alterations in Na+ homeostasis and assesses the possible mechanisms in a study of the interaction of the carotid sinus and vagal afferent reflexes in dogs exposed to sodium depletion or sodium loading. We also discuss the relationship between acute changes in cerebrospinal fluid Na+ concentration and sympathetic nerve activity in both the absence and presence of cardiopulmonary reflexes and after blockade of the systemic effects of vasopressin. The studies provide important evidence for a previously unsuspected action of Na+ upon the central circuits involved in integrating the interaction between low- and high-pressure baroreflexes.\r"

Changes in cardiac performance as determined by vasodilators equipotent in relation to blood pressure reduction were found to have markedly different effects on aortic distensibility; volume distensibility was unchanged by cadralazine but was improved by calcium entry blockers and isosorbide dinitrate. Our findings suggest that alterations in the buffering function of the large arteries, as indicated by decreased volume distensibility, participate in the increased afterload in patients with essential hypertension and thus influence the degree of cardiac hypertrophy and changes in cardiac function and selective use of antihypertensive drugs may influence cardiovascular morbidity and mortality by their differential effect on large-vessel distensibility.\r"

These drugs may indirectly affect coronary blood flow by their effects on the peripheral circulation, effects that modify myocardial oxygen demand. They also have direct effects on the coronary circulation, with some drugs affecting mainly the large epicardial coronary arteries and others affecting mainly the small resistance vessels. Some coronary stenoses are compliant and are capable of changes in caliber. Drugs that dilate large coronary arteries, such as nitroglycerin and the calcium channel-blocking agents, can dilate these stenotic segments. This dilation may contribute to the relief of myocardial ischemia by increasing coronary blood flow. Alternatively, drugs that dilate resistance vessels without an effect on large coronary arteries may cause passive narrowing or collapse of coronary stenoses and could potentially worsen myocardial ischemia. Therefore, in the presence of coronary stenoses, a vasodilator may be beneficial or harmful depending, at least in part, on the site of action of the drug in the coronary circulation.\r"

However, potential negative inotropic effects could have an adverse effect on myocardial performance. In this study, we evaluated the hemodynamic response to the prototypic calcium-channel antagonist, verapamil, in patients with moderate-to-severe hypertension. We gave incremental infusions of verapamil in subsystemic doses into the brachial artery of an isolated forearm preparation. The response to 10 micrograms/min/100 ml revealed a reduction in forearm vascular resistance from 55 to 21 units and an increase in forearm blood flow from 3.57 to 7.54 ml/min/100 ml (both p less than .01). Intravenous administration of verapamil as a bolus (0.15 mg/kg) and continuous infusion (1 or 2 mg/min) resulted in a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance as well as a significant increase in cardiac index and stroke volume index. This occurred without a significant increase in pulmonary wedge pressure. One week of oral therapy resulted in a significant reduction of mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance both at rest and at peak exercise, associated with a significant increase in stroke volume index and no increase in pulmonary wedge pressure. These findings document the direct vasodilator effects of the prototypic calcium-channel antagonist verapamil in patients with moderate-to-severe hypertension. In addition, these data show that myocardial performance can improve during therapy, when myocardial reserve is sufficient, and the adverse effects of systemic vasoconstriction are reversed by therapy.\r"

Offspring and offspring spouses (1718 men and 1892 women; age 17 to 75 years) were similarly studied. The severity of echo LVH, as reflected by left ventricular mass indexed to body surface area, ranged from 101 g/m2 (women) and 132 g/m2 (men) to more than 400 g/m2. The prevalence of electrocardiographically assessed LVH increased proportionately with increased echocardiographic left ventricular mass. Women with echocardiographic left ventricular mass indexes exceeding 200 g/m2 were three to four times more likely to have electrocardiographic LVH than men with similar elevations of echocardiographic left ventricular mass index. The prevalence of echo LVH ranged from 6.6% in the younger (offspring study) women to 33% in the older (original cohort) women (8.6% and 23.7%, respectively, for men) and included a spectrum of forms--eccentric-dilated, eccentric-nondilated, concentric, and disproportionate septal thickness--which varied in prevalence in the various age-sex groups. Each of these forms of echo LVH was associated with higher systolic blood pressures at the time of echocardiographic examination and over the previous 30 years when compared with blood pressures of Framingham subjects without echo LVH.\r"

There was no difference in chamber size and systolic shortening in the two groups, but peak normalized lengthening rate [endocardial (+) VCF] was less than normal in the group with hypertrophy (4.8 +/- 1.4 and 3.1 +/- 0.9 sec-1, respectively, p less than .05). These results were contrasted with midwall (+) VCF data derived from two models that take into account nonuniform thickening across the left ventricular wall. Both models assume a constant left ventricular mass. The first allows changes in long axis and muscle cross-sectional area; the second assumes a constant cross-sectional area. Peak midwall (+) VCF with the first model was 2.1 +/- 0.5 sec-1 in the normal group and 1.4 +/- 0.3 sec-1 in the group with hypertrophy (p less than .01); with the second model peak midwall VCF was 2.8 +/- 0.6 and 1.4 +/- 0.4 sec-1 (p less than .01) in the two groups. The time to peak VCF and the dimension at the instant of peak (+) VCF were similar in the two groups. Phase-plane plots of length and velocity (dimension vs dD/dt) allow visual inspection and quantification of the relationships between instantaneous dimension, rate of change of dimension, and time in normal and hypertrophic hearts. These plots indicate abnormal filling of the left ventricular chamber and lengthening of midwall fibers in left ventricular hypertrophy.\r"

The relative importance of these factors is emerging from studies performed at various centers. Of these, the adrenergic drive, coronary blood flow, heart rate, afterload, and calcium reuptake mechanisms seem to be important. Physiologically, the index of left ventricular filling should therefore be normalized to allow comparison between different individuals. Using a normalized index (filling rate/emptying rate), we found in a small group (n = 13) of hypertensive patients that the increase in total peripheral resistance during head-up tilt was blunted in those with reduced left ventricular filling, suggesting that this abnormality in diastolic function accompanying hypertension plays a role in cardiovascular regulation by altering sensitivity of cardiopulmonary reflexes.\r"

We evaluated the hypothesis that the increased systemic reaction to adrenergic stimulation is shared by the pulmonary vessels. For this purpose we investigated nine normotensive subjects and 24 patients with moderate primary hypertension during mental arithmetic and the cold pressor test. Both groups responded to both stimuli, with a pressure reaction that during arithmetic was mediated through an increase of cardiac output, and a reaction during the cold pressor test mediated through a predominant rise in systemic vascular resistance. The pressure changes were emphasized in the hypertensive population. Pressure in the pulmonary artery in normotensive subjects was not affected by cold and was slightly raised (systolic) during arithmetic. In hypertensive patients, on the other hand, systolic and diastolic pressures were consistently augmented by both tests, and pulmonary arteriolar resistance rose by 42% and 29% of control during the cold pressor test and arithmetic, respectively. Changes in resistance reflected neurally mediated vasoconstriction and not variations in the passive relationship between pressure and flow, since during arithmetic, for a similar rise in flow the driving pressure across the lungs was steady in normotensive subjects and rose significantly in hypertensive patients. In these same patients pressure was augmented by cold in the absence of substantial changes in flow. At baseline and during tests pulmonary wedge pressure, pleural pressure, arterial blood gases, and pH were similar in the two populations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In normal hearts, pacing-induced tachycardia at a rate of 250 beats/min does not alter coronary reserve in the outer half of the left ventricular wall. Pacing produces a linear decrease in coronary reserve in the inner half, although the decrease is attenuated if perfusion pressure is elevated, as in systemic hypertension. Strenuous exercise can quadruple coronary flow, but modest coronary flow reserve is preserved in normal hearts. Whether this occurs when there is ventricular hypertrophy is unknown and requires study. The concept of coronary flow reserve is important to the understanding of pathophysiology, but data must be interpreted with caution because pharmacologic agents may produce more vasodilatation than can be attained by endogenous stimuli, even when there is marked ischemia.\r"

Two distinct patterns of hypertrophy are discussed, pathologic and physiologic, which differ in their mechanical and biochemical features. Evidence is presented that supports the following hypotheses: the nature of the hypertrophy reflects the nature of the stimulus; the function of the hypertrophied heart reflects its biochemistry; and the degree of responsiveness of the heart varies with species and with age.\r"

  ".W": "Vascular stiffening and a modest increase in cardiac mass with advancing age in man resemble similar alterations accompanying chronic arterial hypertension. In both hypertensive and elderly normotensive individuals, systolic pump function at rest is not altered, while early filling rate and volume are decreased. Although this abnormality is often attributed to the cardiac hypertrophy per se, prolonged isometric relaxation, which occurs with aging in man and animals and in some types of experimental hypertension, is an equally plausible mechanism. In the aged rat, prolonged relaxation can be attributed to a prolonged myoplasmic Ca++ transient with excitation. This occurs amidst a constellation of other cellular changes, among which are a markedly prolonged transmembrane action potential, diminished sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca++ pumping rate, and altered myosin isozyme composition. Many of these changes occur in cardiac muscle of younger animals with cardiac hypertrophy due to chronic increased afterload. While the magnitude of these alterations with advanced age is as great as those with chronic hypertension in younger animals, the magnitude of left ventricular hypertrophy with aging is far less than that in experimental hypertension. Furthermore, with aging, these alterations occur not only in the myocardium of the left but also of the right heart (which does not hypertrophy). Thus, myocardial hypertrophy per se does not appear to be the common link between cellular changes due to aging and those due to hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This elevation of aortic pressure raised intraventricular pressure development, coronary flow, and oxygen consumption. The effect of aortic pressure on protein turnover was dissociated from intraventricular pressure development, contractile activity, and oxygen consumption by use of beating-drained and arrested-drained preparations. Results of other experiments argued against coronary flow as a determinant of rates of protein synthesis and degradation. These results indicated that effects of elevated aortic pressure on protein turnover were caused by stretch of the ventricular wall via its engorgement with blood, the so-called erectile properties of the heart or \"garden-hose effect.\" These effects on protein turnover may be of importance in initiating hypertrophy of the heart secondary to pressure or volume overload.\r"

Infusion in vivo of norepinephrine but not epinephrine increased blood pressure slightly. However, both agents increased significantly the frequency of tetraploidy of smooth muscle cells up to 14.9 +/- 0.6% (mean +/- SE) and 9.2 +/- 0.5% compared with saline (6.5 +/- 0.7%). Exposure in vitro to norepinephrine (10(-6)M) increased the frequency of tetraploidy and octaploidy of smooth muscle cells from SHR up to 14.2% and 2.1%, respectively, compared with nonexposed cells (8.1% and 0.2%).

Since the creatine kinase reaction replenishes hydrolyzed ATP so rapidly, early studies detected only creatine phosphate hydrolysis during muscular contraction. Direct observation of ATP hydrolysis required creatine kinase inhibition and suggested that creatine phosphate provided an energy reserve. Elegant studies with isolated heart mitochondria provided evidence that the creatine kinase reaction regulates the rate of oxidative phosphorylation. The 31P nuclear magnetic resonance technique of magnetization transfer permitted the direct investigation of the creatine kinase reaction in intact organs and confirmed the classic observation that chemical flux through the creatine kinase reaction is coupled to mitochondrial energy production. Hearts from 18-month-old spontaneously hypertensive rats have as much as a 50% decrease in mitochondrial creatine kinase activity. Preliminary magnetization transfer studies in such a heart show a depressed relation between creatine kinase flux and cardiac performance. The results suggest that creatine kinase flux, as measured by magnetization transfer, is determined in part by creatine kinase isozyme composition and that these biochemical changes are associated with long-standing cardiac hypertrophy.\r"

The splint is constructed from three Kirschner wires and is activated by a single rubber band. The effect of this force couple is present through a complete range of joint motion, thereby allowing active flexion and extension of the joint during bone and soft tissue healing.

  ".W": "Perilunate dislocations of the wrist have a common pathway of disruption that occurs from extensive dorsiflexion injuries. Open reduction and internal fixation of these injuries is required to provide accurate alignment and the option for ligament repair. Both dorsal and palmar surgical incisions may be indicated. Associated injuries to the median nerve must be recognized. Treatment includes scaphoid and radial styloid stabilization with multiple K-wires or internal compression screw (Herbert or Association for the Study of Internal Fixation [ASIF] screws). In these injuries, the lunate must be reduced first and stabilized. The scaphoid proximal segment follows the lunate unless the scapholunate (SL) ligament is torn. The distal scaphoid fragment, capitate, and triquetrum are reduced and aligned with the lunate and need to be held with K-wires. Ligament repair and augmentation may be necessary at both scapholunate and lunotriquetal areas if there has been serious ligament injury. Palmar ligament repair is often required, and we recommend a palmar exploration in most patients along with release of the median nerve. Surgical treatment results of perilunate fracture-dislocations of the wrist appear better than conservative treatment methods, but complications following both indicate the need for improved internal fixation and fracture-dislocation realignment. These fractures are a real challenge to the treating surgeon who must use patience, precise surgical techniques, and careful roentgenographic study (including tomograms and traction views) to assure the best result.\r"

Investigations into the pathomechanics of these injuries highlight the problems of arthritis, pain, swelling, weakness, limited range of motion and instability associated with nonanatomic reduction of both intraarticular fragments and their associated ligaments. Factors affecting the prognosis for these injuries include degree and location of articular involvement and the energy of the precipitating force as well as the anatomy of reduction. Operative treatment is reserved for displaced intraarticular fractures. Those extremely comminuted fractures are best fixed with distraction and external fixation. The operative approach to these fractures is dependent on the anatomy. Ligamentous instability, in particular with radial styloid fractures, must be sought and treated. Kirschner wires can be used as \"joy sticks\" to control unstable carpal bones or fracture fragments prior to fixation. Plates and screws are useful in the stabilization of volar and dorsal rim fractures. The use of intraoperative radiographs is emphasized. Postoperative early range of motion, when possible, greatly improves the long-term results.\r"

A servohydraulic test machine (Materials Test Systems, Minneapolis, MN) simultaneously measured axial loads, torque, and displacement during insertion and pull-out. Kirschner wires of each tip configuration were also placed in seven canine metacarpals for a three-week in vivo test. After the animals were killed, peak pull-out forces were measured and compared with in vitro results. The trochar-tipped wire displayed the highest required torque and axial load to penetrate bone. It also demonstrated the highest pull-out force immediately after drilling, especially when inserted at the low drill speed. After placement for three weeks, pull-out force of the diamond-tipped wire equaled the trochar. The homemade cut wire consistently yielded inferior holding properties. For immediate and sustained strong fixation in bone, a wire with a trochar tip configuration should be inserted at low drill speeds.\r"

The cervical spine of the older subjects displayed narrowing of intervertebral discs and osteophytoses (posterior osteophytes as well as anterior osteophytes) at the levels of C5-6 and C6-7, where the range of motion was decreased. Such degenerative changes resulted in vertebrolisthesis, especially retrolisthesis, predominantly at the levels of C3-4 and C4-5, where intervertebral disc space was well maintained and mobility was well preserved. Both static and dynamic anteroposterior canal diameter decreased with age. Throughout the aging process the dynamic canal became much narrower than the static canal, except at C2-3. Posterior osteophytes at C5-6 or C6-7 and retrolisthesis at C3-4 or C4-5 were major levels of stenosis associated with changes in the dynamic canal. Following the same evaluation system, 20 elderly patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy were assessed. Based on the above-noted characteristics of the aging process, patients with myelopathy had smaller static and dynamic canal measurements than normal subjects. The development of cervical myelopathy, however, was not always based on critical static or dynamic canal stenosis (10% in this series) and might involve other factors.\r"

The fiber distribution of the multifidus and semispinalis muscles was studied in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Compared with sex- and age-matched controls, a \"normal\" percentage of Type 1 fibers was found on the convex right side and significantly smaller percentage of Type 1 fibers on the concave side. Boys with AIS showed the same pattern as girls. In two patients with double major curves, the same pattern could be seen on the convexity of both curves. Patients with congenital scoliosis or scoliosis with early onset showed a different pattern with a \"normal\" percentage of Type 1 fibers on the concave side but a significantly greater percentage of Type 1 fibers on the convex side. In AIS, the deviation in the fiber distribution may constitute a primary factor in the pathogenesis of scoliosis. In congenital scoliosis the differences in fiber distribution between the convex and concave sides are considered secondary in the pathogenesis of the spinal curvature.\r"

Fractures at the base of the proximal phalanx. Fractures at the base of the proximal phalanx have low incidence of complications if they are treated closed. Fractures at the shaft carry a much larger risk of complications with either type of treatment.

  ".W": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on the hips of 25 patients with suspected ischemic necrosis of the femoral head. Twenty-six femoral heads manifested MRI changes of ischemic necrosis: diminished bone marrow signal in a ringlike, focal, or diffuse pattern. Plain radiographs were normal in 13 of 26 MRI-positive hips; six were asymptomatic. MRI was more effective in detecting early cases than conventional 99mTc-diphosphonate or 99mTc-sulfur colloid (SC) bone scanning. There were no false-negative MRI examinations, but diphosphonate scans were negative in nine hips with normal radiography and abnormal MRI. Sulfur colloid scans were normal in only two hips with positive MRI, but SC scan results were often equivocal because isotope deficits were bilaterally symmetric. The results of this preliminary investigation imply that MRI has extraordinary sensitivity for the detection of early ischemic necrosis. Unlike radionuclide scanning, MRI shows the exact location and extent of femoral head necrosis. Because MRI is expensive, it should be used in a cost-effective manner. Therefore, MRI is best suited for the diagnosis of early cases where less expensive tests are negative or equivocal and as a precursor to more costly interventional procedures, such as core biopsy study or decompression.\r"

The nerve is situated predominantly posterior to the tibia. The pin should be passed through the middle of the tibia (in cross section) strictly in the coronal plane to avoid neural damage.

The hypothesis tested in this study is total hip articular replacement by internal eccentric shells (THARIES) resurfacing hip arthroplasty is a sufficiently durable alternative to conventional total hips in patients younger than 40 years old. Survivorship analysis techniques were applied to 106 THARIES and 98 conventional hip replacements. The primary outcome variable investigated was time to failure, as measured by the need for revision of the prosthesis in the absence of sepsis. Other definitions of prosthesis failure were also investigated. Analysis revealed that even within this young, high-risk population there were subpopulations with different risks for failure. The lowest risk patients comprised all rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) patients, regardless of age. The intermediate risk patients comprised all non-RA, non-JRA patients older than 30 years of age and the highest-risk patients were all non-RA, non-JRA patients younger than 30 years of age. A comparison of THARIES and conventional prostheses within each of these three subpopulations revealed similar patterns of failure over time, with the conventional total hip replacement having significantly better hip function than the THARIES group only in the highest-risk population, when using a failure definition of revision surgery for aseptic loosening. A broader and more important conclusion was that all acrylic-fixed implants, THARIES or THRs are predicted to undergo early mechanical loosenings in younger-than-30, non-RA, non-JRA patients. In patients younger than 30 years age acrylic fixation of THA is inadvisable.\r"

Nine patients were tested following Girdlestone hip resection arthroplasty, six patients prior to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for unilateral osteoarthritis of the knee, and 49 rheumatoid arthritis patients prior to unilateral TKA; 27 were retested after operation. The results were compared with previously published pre- and postoperative data for total hip arthroplasty (THA) following primary osteoarthritis. There were severe energetic penalties caused by rheumatoid or osteoarthritis involving the hip or knee or following Girdlestone arthroplasty. Walking speed was severely reduced in all groups (range, 33-46 m/minute). The rate of oxygen consumption was not significantly greater than the mean rate of oxygen uptake for normal subjects; however, the oxygen cost per meter travelled was elevated because of the slow walking speed. The heart rate was significantly elevated in all patient groups. The elevated cardiac response can be accounted for on the basis of deconditioning resulting from the patients' pain, limited ambulatory activities, and the systemic effects of rheumatoid disease. In addition, the elevated cardiac response may be caused by added physical exertion by the arms in patients on crutches or walkers. The improvements in speed and energy cost were the same for the group of rheumatoid patients tested after unilateral TKA as in the group of patients tested before and after THA. The clinician can anticipate the same magnitude of improvement from surgery in a rheumatoid patient as in an osteoarthritis patient if the primary joint disease is restricted to a single joint.\r"

An average of 0.44 degrees of outward rotation of the tibia occurred for every degree of supination of the foot. The relationship was linear. There was less transmission of torsion during dorsal extension than during plantar flexion of the ankle. The joint complex of the hind foot somewhat resembles a universal joint except that the distal fork of the universal joint changes its configuration through its range of motion. This distal fork, consisting of the calcaneus, the cuboid, and the navicular, together with the central piece, the talus, constitutes a three-arm link system, which explains the configurational change. The process of balance when standing on one leg and when walking on uneven surfaces, when the torsion-transmitting effect plays a central role, can be controlled as rotations in the hip joint. This torsion-transmitting model helps to elucidate the trauma mechanisms of various ankle fractures. It also may explain why anterior knee pain due to malalignment can be relieved with supinating foot supports.\r"

BMP/TCP implants induced 91%-100% incorporation by deposits of new bone. In comparison, control implants of TCP impregnated with bovine serum albumin (BSA/TCP) induced 0%-8% incorporation, or only marginal host bed reactive bone formation. The retention of unabsorbed TCP in the host bone four months after implantation suggests that further research should be encouraged to obtain a formulation of sintered calcium phosphate that could be resorbed more rapidly and in the process more completely replaced by bone.\r"

The preoperative diagnoses were idiopathic osteoarthritis in 25, chondrocalcinosis in six, rheumatoid arthritis in two, Paget's disease in two, avascular necrosis in two, and congenital dislocation of the hip in one patient. In 16 of the patients with idiopathic osteoarthritis and the two with avascular necrosis, nonviable osteocytes were present in the central regions of many trabeculae, these areas usually being separated by cement lines from viable bone. The pattern suggested previous necrosis of part of the femoral head, with later new bone formation. The pattern was not observed in either control subjects, or patients with known articular disease, such as chondrocalcinosis. Bone collapse of variable severity was apparent radiographically in nine patients with histologic bone death, but not in other patients. Bone death is commonly present in idiopathic osteoarthritis and could be a cause rather than a result of the arthritis.\r"

Screws are indicated for unstable, long oblique or spiral fractures of the metacarpals and phalanges, intraarticular fractures with articular surface involvement in excess of 25% with or without comminution, and intraarticular condylar, T-condylar, and Y-condylar fractures. Plates at the metacarpal level are indicated for segmental defects with substance loss, fractures with extreme comminution, and unstable short oblique or transverse diaphyseal fractures. Plate fixation of phalangeal fractures is seldom necessary but helpful in treating segmental defects or extreme comminution of diaphysis or metaphysis as well as intraarticular T- or Y-condylar fractures. Screw and plate fixation at the metacarpal levels, when appropriately applied, renders rigid osteosynthesis while inflicting little to no interference on the surrounding soft tissues. Screws can be applied with little to no soft tissue interference throughout the proximal phalanx and proximal and distal aspects of the middle phalanx. Plate fixation for middle phalangeal fractures is limited to salvage situations for preservation of skeletal length. The essentials for successful use of implants are a hand surgeon well versed in a variety of internal fixation techniques including the Association for the Study of Internal Fixation (ASIF) technique of screw and plate fixation, a meticulous respect for, and protection of, the soft tissues, and a facility for delivery of functional aftercare.\r"

Indications for its use are rigid stabilization of fracture, osteotomy, and the bony components of composite tissue transfer. The device should be used in deference to other techniques when early active range of motion is pursued. Its best use is in the face of combined injury or osteotomy with tenolyses/capsulotomy. This implant permits stabilization of small epiphyseal fragments with minimal interference of joint function and perhaps a reduction of irritation of the extensor aponeurosis. Disadvantages include the need for careful preoperative planning because of this implant's small size and unforgiving tolerances of application. The data is included for the first 65 consecutive cases of its use. Despite the institution of range of motion therapy within five days in 77% of the cases, there were no nonunions. Two cases of delayed union were successfully treated by addition of cancellous bone grafts without revision of the fixation devices. Problems included malignments (three cases), infections (two cases), and soft tissue coverage (four cases). Aseptic necrosis of bone is associated with metacarpal head fractures and is seen with the use of this implant in treating such intraarticular fractures.\r"

The functional results that have been reported are usually considered good; however, amputation of digits through the proximal phalanges is still a difficult area in which to obtain satisfactory function as measured by proximal interphalangeal joint motion.

This report concerns the use of a unique, expandable intramedullary device for internal fixation of metacarpal or phalangeal shaft fractures that renders enough intrinsic stability that motion may be started early without fear of loss of reduction. The device is applicable for transverse or short oblique fractures and consists of a cylindrical apparatus made of titanium that allows for collapse in the circumferential diameter. It is introduced into the medullary canal in its collapsed state, and then is released to allow reexpansion into its normal diameter in the canal with the fracture reduced over it. This gives excellent fixation and affords stability approaching that of normal bone. Minimal postoperative immobilization is needed and early restoration of motion is possible. The device may also be used to immobilize metacarpal bones or phalanges following osteotomies, and it appears to be excellent for fixation of the bone in digits to be replanted. No complications have occurred in the reported series.\r"

It is particularly useful when extensive wounds prohibit internal fixation and when comminution and bone loss render the fracture difficult to control by other methods. External fixation permits simultaneous wound access and fracture management. It can be used alone or adjunctively with other methods of fixation such as Kirschner wires, screws, or plates for definitive fracture management. Alternatively, external fixation can be used for provisional fracture management until wound conditions permit the application of other means of osteosynthesis.\r"

Measurement of arterial oxygen saturation by means of pulse oximetry offers a physiologic, real time method of monitoring the progress of cardiopulmonary adaptation by which the clinician can evaluate the need for and success of resuscitative efforts. Four preterm infants are reported in whom pulse oximetry was useful in assessing the changes in oxygen saturation during resuscitation.\r"

BP values obtained in the left and right upper limbs and right lower limb were similar for the respective days, with minor variations in pattern. The waking and sleeping heart rate, identical on the first day, also diverged with increase in age but again no significant difference was observed on the first 6 days. There was no correlation between the BP and heart rate on any of the 6 days. However, a positive correlation between the daily mean systolic pressure and heart rate only in the waking state was observed over the course of the 6-day study period.\r"

  ".W": "Detailed analysis of caretaker response to the first infant newly diagnosed with AIDS at a university hospital was done by review of nursing notes for three periods: before diagnosis of AIDS, after diagnosis, and after psychiatric consultation. Five consultation questions were posed, and the findings on investigation of these questions are discussed. It was found that the percentage of time that PRN medication was given dropped after diagnosis of AIDS but rose above the initial level after the consultation. The number of times per shift the nurse touched the baby (TLCs) was not found to be associated with use of PRN medication; rather it was explained by which nurse was caring for the child. This study focuses on variations in nursing care of one infant to illustrate how variation in caretaker response can amplify the range of perturbations of the infant's behavioral response. It is speculated that caretakers of patients with AIDS may normally have feelings considered unacceptable in medical settings, including fear, blaming the patient, or a wish to avoid the patient. Such feelings are more difficult to tolerate in the care of children or infants and are superimposed upon the familiar stains associated with the care of chronically ill or dying pediatric patients.\r"

Local infection did not present serious problems. Sepsis occurred in half the patients but was managed with antibiotics. There was one case of late volvulus of the stomach. All local applications, if used regularly, gave rise to complications. Two cases of hypothyroidism caused by the application of povidon-iodine and one case of alcohol intoxication were observed.

We have studied eight male subjects during infusion of arginine vasopressin (AVP) at 2 units/h for 90 min. Plasma levels of AVP, measured by radioimmunoassay, rose to 68.5 (7.0) pg/ml, mean (SEM). Forearm and finger blood flow was measured with an electronic plethysmograph, hand interdigital skin-fold blood flow with a laser-Doppler blood flow meter and facial temperature with a thermocouple. All subjects developed marked facial pallor during infusion of AVP, facial temperature falling from 34.2 (0.2) to 32.7 (0.1) degrees C (P less than 0.001) then rising to 33.7 (0.1) degrees C (P less than 0.01) after AVP was stopped. Hand interdigital skin-fold blood flow also fell from 2.6 (0.02) to 2.3 (0.02) V (P less than 0.001) and rose sharply to 3.6 (0.2) V (P less than 0.001) on stopping the infusion. There were small changes in forearm and finger blood flow: both rose, from 6.3 (0.1) to 6.9 (0.1) (P less than 0.001) and 46.1 (1.0) to 54.3 (0.7) ml min-1 100 ml-1 (P less than 0.001) respectively. Neither fell when AVP was stopped. Heart rate remained unchanged throughout. These results indicate that high physiological levels of AVP, comparable with those attained during physical stress, produced a fall in blood flow in the face and interdigital skin-fold of the hand consistent with a fall in nutritional blood flow to skin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Plasma urea, creatinine (PCr) and potassium had increased after 7 days; plasma potassium increased much more after 17 days but PCr was slightly lower. Renal failure caused resetting of erythropoietic control to a lower level of packed cell volume (PCV). After 7 days renal failure some rats had a low PCV, whereas others still had a normal PCV apparently due to slower erythrocyte destruction of pre-renal failure cells. After 7 days renal failure, rats with a normal PCV had an increased erythrocyte membrane leak to potassium that resulted in a low erythrocyte potassium [K+]RBC. This was accompanied by an increase in active sodium pump units [increased ouabain sensitive sodium flux (Fo) and its rate constant (ko)] that caused erythrocyte sodium ([Na+]RBC) to fall. The increased active pump units retarded the fall in [K+]RBC and may have extended the life of the normal erythrocytes in the renal failure environment. The PCV was below normal in all rats after 17 days renal failure. [K+]RBC was increased and since ko was normal there appeared to be compensation to produce erythrocytes with reduced membrane leak to potassium with longer standing renal failure. PCr was only related to PCV after 17 days renal failure and not in the earlier phase of erythrocyte destruction. The changes in erythrocyte membrane permeability were very significantly related to PCV after 17 days.\r"

Another TXA2 receptor antagonist L-640,035 increased significantly the diuretic effect of frusemide. Both the sodium excretion rate and urine osmolar excretion rate were significantly increased in rats treated with the TXA2 synthase inhibitor OKY 1581 and frusemide. The data suggest that TXA2 is released during frusemide-induced diuresis in rats, and the released TXA2 has an opposing antidiuretic effect.

  ".W": "The relationship between thirst perception and plasma osmolality was studied during hypertonic and physiological saline infusion in ten healthy volunteers. Thirst perception was quantified using a linear visual analogue scale which volunteers marked at intervals during the infusion periods. Infusion of hypertonic saline caused a steady rise in plasma osmolality together with a progressive linear increase in thirst perception and also plasma arginine vasopressin. No significant changes in thirst, plasma osmolality or plasma arginine vasopressin occurred during infusion of physiological saline. Linear regression analysis of the results defined the functions. Thirst (cm) = 0.3 (plasma osmolality-281) (r = +0.92, P less than 0.001) and plasma arginine vasopressin (pmol/l) = 0.4 (plasma osmolality-285) (r = +0.96, P less than 0.001). The osmolar threshold for thirst onset thus defined (281 mosmol/kg) was much lower than in previous studies and similar to the theoretical osmolar threshold for vasopressin release (285 mosmol/kg). We conclude that thirst perception rises in a progressive fashion throughout a wide range of plasma osmolality and that the osmolar threshold for thirst onset is similar to the theoretical osmolar threshold for vasopressin release. The results are compatible with the concept of either a single osmoreceptor subserving both thirst and vasopressin release, or two osmoreceptors sharing similar functional characteristics.\r"

Such arteries responded in a concentration-dependent manner to noradrenaline and angiotensin II, and the maximal force developed suggested that the vessels were fully viable. Although the biopsies were normally taken during operations under general anaesthesia, biopsies taken under local anaesthesia also appeared to be fully viable, suggesting that this technique may prove useful as a general method for studying the intrinsic vascular properties of humans. Biopsies were taken from 20 patients with uraemia, all of whom were treated with chronic intermittent dialysis, and 11 control subjects; up to three vessels were examined per biopsy. The uraemic state was not associated with changes in vascular morphology, or in vascular reactivity or sensitivity to noradrenaline, angiotensin II, potassium or calcium. However, for the uraemic patients and for the controls there was a positive correlation between mean blood pressure and the ratio of vessel media thickness to lumen diameter, as well as a negative correlation between mean blood pressure and vessel active media stress. The results suggest that uraemia treated with dialysis may not be associated with altered properties of the resistance vasculature. However, it appears that uraemic hypertension is associated with both morphological and functional abnormalities of the resistance vasculature.\r"

Type I and type II mean fibre areas were reduced by 32% and 50%, respectively, when compared with non-prednisone treated patients. The latter group did not differ from the controls in this respect. A correlation was found between the isokinetic muscle strength of the knee extensors and the mean areas of type I and type II in patients treated with prednisone (r = 0.48, P less than 0.05 and r = 0.58, P less than 0.02 respectively). No such correlation was found when using isometric measurements of the knee extensors. A positive correlation was found in both groups of rheumatoid arthritis patients between the areas of the type I and type II fibres (r = 0.66 - 0.68, P less than 0.05 - 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the present study, we infused AVP directly into the artery supplying these organs and tissues in order to determine the relative contribution of local versus systemic mechanisms in the vascular resistance changes previously observed. Regional blood flows were measured with radioactive microspheres in conscious, chronically instrumented dogs before and during intra-arterial infusions of AVP administered into the left axillary artery (n = 6), the left coronary artery (n = 6), and the cranial mesenteric artery (n = 6). The infusion rates were calculated to increase local, target organ plasma concentrations of AVP to the levels reached in our previous study while minimizing systemic changes. Left axillary AVP artery infusion significantly reduced skin and compact bone blood flow, but had no effect on skeletal muscle blood flow. Intracoronary AVP infusion had no effect on myocardial blood flow nor on cardiac output. Intramesenteric AVP infusion had no effect on blood flow to the colon, small intestine and abdominal fat, but significantly reduced blood flow to those areas of the pancreas which received blood from the cannulated artery. Measurements in a limited number of dogs indicated that the local axillary and mesenteric venous levels of AVP were similar when the hormone was infused systemically at a rate of 220 pg min-1 kg-1 or intra-arterially at a lower rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Fatty acid synthesis rates were significantly lower in alcoholic fatty liver than in controls. Fatty acid synthesis rates were similar in controls and patients with diabetic fatty livers.

In the five dogs studied, plasma ammonia was elevated, as was CSF tryptophan, both usual biochemical abnormalities in portosystemic encephalopathy. CSF levels of GABA in five dogs with portosystemic encephalopathy (100 +/- 13 pmol/ml) were not significantly different from those in five control dogs (96 +/- 14 pmol/ml). CSF levels of GABA were not altered after ammonia infusion. If enhanced GABA-ergic neurotransmission, due to influx of gut-derived GABA into the brain, is responsible for the pathophysiology of chronic portosystemic encephalopathy in this model, it is not reflected by increased levels of GABA in CSF.\r"

The rate of efflux was also reduced by 6 mmol/l lactate and pyruvate added to the external medium.

  ".W": "The success of a quality assurance system is contingent on close adherence to each protocol, from preparation of the patient to issuance of the final result. In the event that the system experiences failures at any point, the quality of laboratory data may be jeopardized. Again, the system requires support not just from management and personnel employed at the technical level, but from the entire organization. It requires a complete commitment to quality and to the provision of a high level of service. Such quality assurance programs have been highly successful in the manufacturing industry. For an example, one need look no further than the domination of certain world markets by Japanese industries. Their commitment to quality and their system-wide quality control efforts have been essential to the success and growth of their organizations. Currently, systems that provide high levels of quality assurance are under scrutiny in an effort to reduce costs. As more effort is placed into monitoring an organization's quality, the expenditure of non-revenue producing dollars increases. A large organization should question these expenditures. However, when evaluating such a program, it should be realized that the costs associated with the pursuit of quality are often offset by savings realized through improved processes. Further, quality is a salable commodity. Its lack may be costly. According to Westgard et al., costs of quality can be grouped into prevention costs, appraisal costs, and failure costs. Prevention costs include those costs incurred through the development of sound analytic procedures and adequate training of technical personnel. Appraisal costs comprise those costs incurred as a result of challenging the analytic procedure as well as the entire system. Failure costs represent the dollars spent when out-of-control assays have to be repeated. An important step in evaluating potential savings produced by a quality control program is assigning a dollar value to the cost of repeating an assay. In general, as the quality of an organization's product increases, the expense of providing the product decreases. Likewise, as productivity increases, the cost of testing decreases. Increased quality and productivity provide a higher percentage of profit. As the profitability of an organization increases, the additional resources required to investigate new methods, themselves a valuable contribution to quality assurance, are provided.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In review, one is compelled to the notion that a variety of the aforementioned thoughts become pre-eminent in assuring quality. The selection of the tests available for home testing is crucial. They should be divided into categories of single encounter tests and multiple use tests. The single encounter implies a test that has an extremely high degree of reliability and is likely to achieve an answer to the question asked. This should relate to a disease or process for which potential favorable treatment can be achieved or which may have a major favorable impact on public health. In this category one thinks in terms of the worldwide prevalence of hepatitis B and other infectious diseases that are particularly common in third world countries. Yet, these are not \"markets\" likely to be able to afford this testing. Similarly, these societies are not currently sophisticated in terms of application of preventive measures. On the other hand, major benefits could be projected from the other category of testing, namely, therapeutic monitoring in the hands of individuals who will repetitively test for the same substance in the same manner. This includes not only diabetes but other conditions that are monitored for drug therapy, including seizure disorders and bronchospasm. Inherent in this aspect is the requirement for meaningful and ongoing instruction in proper testing methodology and recording of results. The incorporation of some type of memory device to enforce this aspect of testing appears extremely desirable, if not mandatory. Finally, we must consider the potential for misuse of the single test type of device. One suspects that it would be highly desirable that any test made available for self-testing should also be mandated as accessible through certified laboratories at the request of an individual, which would at least provide reliable performance of the test with a quality result. The development of the concept of quality assurance in home testing is in its infancy and will require continuing evolution.\r"

For those stage I patients at low risk (stage I-A1, I-B1, well or moderately differentiated) for recurrence, the exceeding of 90% survival rates in these carefully staged patients without postoperative radiation or chemotherapy represents significant progress in comparison to results a decade ago. Moreover, those patients thought to be stage I or II but found to have upper abdominal metastasis by careful surgical staging will now receive the best therapy for stage III ovarian cancer. The combination of the small volume of upper abdominal tumor discovered in these latter patients and the effects of receiving the best therapy for stage III disease should result in improved survival for this subset of patients. The impact of cisplatin-based chemotherapy has already impacted positively on improved survival for women with stage III and IV ovarian carcinoma. With more surgeons now trained in the techniques of debulking surgery in advanced ovarian carcinoma, the recent survival rates for patients receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy should improve significantly in the next decade.\r"

Continuous monitoring and display of cardiac output and 20 or more derived variables, together with the predictive index, were a feasible and useful approach. Unlike previously documented series of elective postoperative general surgical patients, our series consisted of patients with multiple trauma, myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other medical emergencies as well as postoperative cardiac and general surgical patients, all of whom had respiratory failure (acute respiratory distress syndrome). In addition to these differences, our patients were invariably admitted to the ICU after the nadir of their hypotensive crisis. To compare the continuous recorded values with previous studies that used intermittent measurements, three comparable time intervals were selected; data at these time intervals and the predictions derived from them were in satisfactory agreement with prior studies. Moreover, therapeutic goals based on the median values of survivors of the present series were similar, but not identical, to prior series despite differences in the clinical mix and the later postresuscitation ICU admissions of our series.\r"

All patients showed a dramatic slowing of heart rate, averaging 54.0 +/- 4.0 beat/min (p less than .001), with only small and transient fall in BP. Seventeen (68%) patients experienced conversion to sinus rhythm, 11 immediately, and six more within 3 h. Time to response averaged 5.1 h with the oral form but was less than 10 min when the drug was given iv. The mean oral dose required was 32.5 mg, and the mean iv dose was 6.5 mg. No patient experienced clinically apparent hemodynamic or respiratory deterioration as a result of metoprolol administration. While arterial pH and PaCO2 were unaltered by metoprolol, mean PaO2 increased by 12.2 +/- 5.8 torr (p less than .05), the increase being greatest in patients with more severe gas-exchange derangement. We conclude that metoprolol is effective in the management of multifocal atrial tachycardia.\r"

The rates of positive PA catheter-aspirate cultures were 30.6% on day 1, 20.4% on day 2, and 32.7% on day 3 (not statistically different). PA catheter-aspirate cultures had a sensitivity of 5.7% and a positive predictive value of 30% for catheter-related infection, and 15% sensitivity and 40% positive predictive value for peripheral bacteremia. While 95% (55 of 58) of the catheter-aspirate cultures were false-positives, only 0.5% (3 of 588) were true-positives. Peripheral blood cultures were positive in 10% of the patients, but the catheter segments were sterile or grew different organisms. Arterial line cultures had zero sensitivity and predictive value to detect catheter-related infection, and 15% sensitivity and 40% predictive value to detect peripheral bacteremia. Thus, PA catheter-aspirate cultures, routine peripheral blood cultures, and arterial cultures cannot be recommended to detect PA catheter-related infection. Catheter-related infection confirmed by catheter-segment cultures was 10.2% when the PA catheters were removed after 73 +/- 6.5 (SD) h. Bacteria from catheter-segment cultures corresponded to those from the primary infection site.\r"

Of the 102 initial survivors, only 15 patients had received full CPR including cardiac compression and/or defibrillation, endotracheal intubation, and cardiotonic drugs. These data were compared with those for 129 patients admitted to our critical care units in 1982 and 1983 in whom CPR was withheld. These patients had been designated \"No CPR\" primarily because of their poor response to therapy. There was an 11% survival rate for patients who had received CPR compared to a 16% survival rate for the \"No CPR\" group. These data suggest that criteria for administering CPR to hospitalized patients should be improved.\r"

Use of a syringe pump for a continuous infusion of ultralow doses of pituitrin produced uniform, constant, and sustained reduction of urinary output, thus facilitating regular fluid replacement. Twelve patients with postoperative DI received iv pituitrin at a dose of 1.6 +/- 0.26 mIU/kg X h (1 to 2 IU/24 h). The antidiuretic effect began at the third hour of treatment, peaked by the sixth hour (diuresis of 37 ml/h, specific gravity of 1.018 +/- 0.002), and was sustained throughout infusion. Polyuria recurred 3 h after the infusion was discontinued; this rapid reversibility is highly advantageous when excessive fluid intake causes overhydration. Pressor effects were not observed during the treatment period.\r"

Thirty-six (69%) catheters were associated with complications of infection and/or thrombosis, a complication rate of 1/48 catheter days. The patients who developed complications were of a significantly lower gestational age and had a lower mean birth weight when compared with those who developed no complications. The incidence of catheter-related sepsis was 69% in the very low birth weight infants and only 20% in the infants with birth weights over 1500 g. Eighteen of the 26 catheter-associated infections were treated with antibiotics without catheter removal. Successful resolution of the infections with retention of the catheter occurred in 14 of the 18 episodes. Infections with Staphylococcus aureus constituted three of four treatment failures. Urokinase infusion was successful in causing thrombolysis in eight of the nine cases. Broviac catheters in neonates, and especially in preterm infants under 1500 g, are associated with a high incidence of complications. Our experience indicates that some complications can be selectively managed without sacrificing the venous access.\r"

The effect of a leaking patient connection on device performance was investigated. Leakage rates were measured routinely in a neonatal ICU and surgery to determine the clinical significance. In the entire tidal volume and temperature range, the unit provided an inspiratory water content in excess of 30 g/m3 when the leak fraction (volume leaked/volume delivered at Y-piece) was less than 15%. This was found in three out of four cases. In about one out of ten cases, the leak exceeded 30%, which invariably led to corrective action, such as repositioning or changing the endotracheal tube. However, even at a 30% leak, a water content of about 26 g/m3 was still available for humidifying the inspired gas, which corresponds to normal physiologic conditions found in the trachea for nasal breathing of room air.\r"

However, AMA offers no recommended course for retraining; no systematic studies of retraining have been conducted on which to base these recommendations. In this paper we review and present our recommendation for a standardized approach to refresher training. Using the goals and objectives of the ACLS training program as evaluation criteria, we tested with the Mega Code a sample population who had previously been trained in ACLS. The results revealed deficiencies in ACLS knowledge and skills in the areas of assessment, defibrillation, drug therapy, and determining the cause of an abnormal blood gas value. We combined this information with our knowledge of other deficiencies identified during actual resuscitation attempts and other basic life-support and ACLS teaching experiences. We then designed a refresher course which was consistent with the overall goals and objectives of the ACLS training program, but which placed emphasis on the deficiencies identified in the pretesting. We taught our newly designed refresher course in three sessions, which included basic life support, endotracheal intubation, arrhythmia recognition and therapeutic modalities, defibrillation, and Mega Code practice. In a fourth session, using Mega Code testing, we evaluated knowledge and skill learning immediately after training. We similarly tested retention 2 to 4 months later. Performance immediately after refresher training showed improvement in all areas where performance had been weak.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "87079671\r", 
  ".W": "Based on the results of experience accumulated in the past 30 years, exenterative pelvic surgery should be a part of the armamentarium of specially prepared oncologic surgeons. It is most frequently indicated for radiation failures in the treatment of carcinoma of the cervix, although it may be justified as primary treatment of selected cases of stage IV lesions without evidence of dissemination outside the pelvis. It is also justified for postirradiation radionecrosis causing sloughing and fistula, provided adequate relief cannot be offered by simple urinary and fecal diversion. For carcinoma of the rectum and pelvic colon, exenteration has a role in the advanced lesions that appear not to have become disseminated outside the pelvis but that involve contiguous viscera. Reoperation for recurrent carcinoma of the rectum is rarely successful, and this dreaded complication is best avoided by a well-planned and adequate standard first operation, or by the early recognition that a more extended operation is necessary. It is to be hoped that adjuvant radiation therapy, either preoperative or postoperative, or both, may be proved effective in preventing recurrence, especially for lesions below the peritoneal reflection, which is the most frequent site of recurrent disease. Finally, ultraradical pelvic surgery has reached its anatomical and pathologic limit. It only remains for the mortality and survival results to be further improved by continued refinements in the technicalities of the operation and in the judgment and selection of patients for it. Multimodal adjunctive therapy has an emerging role, as does selection of patients for functional preservation and reconstruction. The procedures should continue to be done in institutions where special studies are being conducted and where trained and experienced personnel are available with the necessary ancillary services.\r"

We reviewed the records of 54 consecutive patients seen over a five-year period in whom the serum theophylline level was 39 micrograms/ml or higher (range 39-78 micrograms/ml, mean theophylline level 49.5 +/- 9.6 micrograms/ml). Toxicity sought included cardiovascular--major arrhythmias (asystole, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation) and minor arrhythmias, (central nervous system--major [seizures], minor [confusion, agitation]); and gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting and diarrhea). In our sample of patients with extremely high theophylline levels, the incidence of life-threatening complications was low, and the subgroup of patients with high serum theophylline levels who developed life-threatening toxicity could not be easily identified. We conclude that major interventional procedures such as hemoperfusion or hemodialysis should not be used prophylactically in this population of patients of middle age to elderly men with high theophylline levels. We recommend a more conservative approach of using oral activated charcoal therapy in all patients with high serum theophylline levels, and reserving hemoperfusion or hemodialysis for those patients who develop seizures or major arrhythmias.\r"

  ".W": "The criteria of the American Thoracic Society (ATS) for determining the end-point of the forced vital capacity (FVC) maneuver were compared with an algorithm employed by a computer system (Hewlett-Packard), which yields a later end-point. The 150 subjects tested were divided into five groups of 30 on the basis of the following spirometric diagnoses: normal; small airways' obstruction (SAO); mild airways' obstruction (MAO); severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); or restrictive disease. The subjects performed a minimum of three maneuvers according to ATS standards, and the flow-volume curves with the greatest sum of FVC and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV) were chosen for analysis by the two algorithms. Hewlett-Packard (HP) values for FVC and FVC time were always higher than the corresponding ATS values, and the HP values for flows were always lower than the corresponding ATS values. The higher differences were observed in the SAO group. In the group with severe COPD, high FVC differences and low flow differences were observed; on the contrary, in the restrictive group, low FVC differences and high flow differences were present. These results, in addition to the different location of the FVC end point, may be explained by the different morphology of the flow-volume curves. In conclusion, the ATS algorithm caused a systematic underevaluation of FVC and a systematic overevaluation of flows, which cause practical consequences only in the SAO group. In fact, 28 percent (17/60) of the subjects with SAO characteristics were considered \"normal\" using ATS criteria for the end-point.\r"

  ".W": "While a number of recent reports have documented the changing clinical and radiographic spectrum of parenchymal tuberculosis, relatively little attention has been paid to changes in the patterns of pleural tuberculosis. We therefore reviewed the clinical, laboratory, and radiographic characteristics of 26 adult patients with tuberculous pleural effusions. We found that pleural tuberculosis has become a disease of older adults (median age, 56 years) and that 19 percent (5/26) of the cases were due to postprimary (reactivation) disease. This shift in age led to problems in diagnosis, since many of these older patients had underlying or coexisting disease that could have caused a pleural effusion. Both specimens of pleural fluid and pleural biopsy were useful in establishing the diagnosis. Examination of sputum was less helpful. All patients who were not anergic had positive cutaneous reactions to first-strength purified protein derivative of tuberculin. Lymphocytosis of the pleural fluid was not a uniform finding; only 62 percent of our patients had greater than 50 percent lymphocytes on their initial examinations of pleural fluid, and four patients had greater than 90 percent polymorphonuclear cells. All of the effusions were exudates, and four had glucose levels in the pleural fluid that were less than 30 mg/dl. Pleural tuberculosis is an important diagnostic consideration in adult or elderly patients with exudative pleural effusions.\r"

Lymphocyte subsets in BAL and blood were determined by the monoclonal antibodies OKT3 (pan T), OKT4 (helper/inducer), OKT8 (suppressor/cytotoxic), B1 (B-cells), OKIa (HLA-DR antigens), and Leu-7 (natural killer). The BAL lymphocytes were moderately elevated to 15 +/- 8 percent (mean +/- SD) in mixed dust pneumoconiosis, and even more markedly increased to 28 +/- 21 percent in asbestosis. The OKT4/OKT8 ratio in BAL was significantly increased to 4.5 +/- 2.1 in asbestosis, and significantly reduced to 0.9 +/- 0.8 in mixed dust pneumoconiosis. In blood, the ratio of T-cell subsets remained unchanged, though total lymphocytes were decreased in asbestosis. These results suggest altered cellular immune processes in the lungs of patients with pneumoconiosis and may indicate different immunoregulatory changes depending on the nature of the inhaled dust.\r"

When properly performed, these techniques demand care and attention to detail much like the surgeon performing a delicate procedure. Without proper care, these procedures can in fact reflect negatively on the physician performing them and fall in disrepute. CT densitometry and transthoracic needle aspiration biopsy allow effective management of the patient with an SPN with prompt documentation of both malignant or benign lesions. With the proper application of these techniques, the majority of patients with benign disease will not need a thoracotomy for diagnosis with resultant benefits to the patient as well as to third-party payers.\r"

Duty cycle, Pdi/Pdi max, and the tension time index were all lower during exercise after tracheostomy tube removal. We conclude that a deflated and fenestrated tracheostomy tube significantly increases airways resistance and can further limit ventilatory muscle performance in patients with airflow obstruction. Patients requiring intermittent ventilatory support may benefit from permanent tracheostomy fistulas that allow for intermittent self cannulation. This would avoid loading of the respiratory muscles when breathing spontaneously.\r"

Intraoperative echocardiography provides an accurate evaluation of cardiac anatomy, extent of tumor invasion, valvular function and the possible presence of intracardiac communications. Importantly, following tumor resection and a complex operative reconstructive procedure, the echocardiogram can confirm complete intracardiac tumor excision, evaluate post-repair ventricular function, and exclude an intracardiac communication or valvular insufficiency.\r"

We measured SaO2 via ear oximetry and recorded oxygen usage per minute. We compared the oxygen usage required for the two techniques to achieve an SaO2 of 90 percent. The results indicate that the mean oxygen requirement using the DODS to achieve an SaO2 of 90 percent was 211.4 ml/min as compared to SF delivery which required 1,610.9 ml/min. This implies an oxygen savings advantage of the DODS over SF of 7:1. The fact that the DODS oxygen savings extends to exercise conditions lends support to its use in portable oxygen therapy. Widespread use of this and other oxygen savings techniques could result in significant cost savings while maintaining the desired benefits of supplemental oxygen administration.\r"

Using a body plethysmograph and quiet breathing technique, specific airway resistance (SRaw) and reactivity to aerosol histamine were assessed on two days prior to allergenic challenge. The dose of histamine that doubled SRaw (PC200His) was determined by interpolation from histamine dose-response curves. On the day of allergenic challenge, each subject inhaled a concentration that was sufficient to induce a dual asthmatic response. Upon resolution of the immediate asthmatic response (45 to 105 minutes) after allergen, the PC200His in all cases had decreased more than 50 percent of its original value (PC200His for the group was 0.29 +/- 1.42 mg/ml [mean +/- SE], compared to 0.84 +/- 1.23 mg/ml initially). Seven or more days after the allergen, each subject had a PC200His comparable to original values. Our data indicate that airway reactivity in dual-responding asthmatic subjects markedly increases soon after the immediate asthmatic response and much before the late asthmatic response manifests clinically. Whether this early increase in bronchial reactivity is a putative requirement for, or shares common characteristics with the late asthmatic response requires further study.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously shown that one night of sleep deprivation results in significant deterioration of spirometric performance and ventilatory responsiveness to inhaled carbon dioxide in normal people. Since even a small decrease in pulmonary function may be clinically important in patients with chronic limitation of airflow, we undertook the present study to assess the effects of sleep loss on breathing in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Criteria for inclusion in this study were a ratio of the forced expiratory volume in one second over the forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) of less than 60 percent, no hospital admission for pulmonary disease within two weeks of testing, stable (less than 30 percent variation) in tests of pulmonary function on two occasions within three months of testing, and no history of asthma. We studied 15 men (mean age, 57 +/- 3 years) on two consecutive mornings. Patients were studied with and without sleep deprivation in a randomized fashion. Patients were hospitalized for the study so that sleep deprivation, medications, smoking, and diet could be monitored and enforced. We found small but statistically significant falls in FEV1 (1.06 +/- 0.11 to 1.00 +/- 0.09 L; p less than 0.05) and in FVC (2.56 +/- 0.20 to 2.43 +/- 0.17 L; p less than 0.05) following sleep deprivation. Changes of similar magnitude which were not statistically significant occurred in maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV) and response to carbon dioxide. The arterial oxygen (PaO2) and carbon dioxide (PaCO2) tensions were not affected. Maximal expiratory pressure at the mouth increased slightly, but there was a fall in maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) at the mouth. We conclude that sleep loss is associated with small but significant falls in FEV1 and FVC, as well as changes of similar magnitude in MVV, minute ventilation, and MIP in patients with severe COPD. Although the sleep loss which frequently accompanies exacerbations of COPD may be a slight additional stress of pulmonary reserve, a single night's loss of sleep in the patient with stable chronic airflow obstruction does not have major clinical consequences.\r"

In one patient, open lung biopsy was also performed during corrective surgery. Pulmonary arterial changes in the 15 patients were grouped into four classifications as follow: (1) plexogenic pulmonary arteriopathy (six patients); (2) thromboembolism in small pulmonary arteries (three patients); (3) \"musculoelastosis,\" intimal proliferation of longitudinal smooth muscle bundles and elastic fibers (three patients); and (4) combinations of (1), (2) or (1), (3) (three patients). We conclude concerning the operative indication that group 2 patients are operable in all cases and group 1 patients with Yamaki's index of pulmonary vascular disease of 2.2 or less; group 3 patients with the absence of complete occlusion of the small pulmonary arterial lumen are operable, and patients with clear evidence of severe plexogenic pulmonary arteriopathy in group 4 are not operable. Comparative analysis of pulmonary pathology and hemodynamic performance revealed that open lung biopsy should be performed to determine operative candidacy in cases with a pulmonary vascular resistance greater than 8 unit X m2, which is considered to represent the borderline of operability.\r"

During a four-year period, 318 patients with AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma presented to New York University Medical Center; 19 patients were found to have pulmonary involvement. All 19 patients were homosexual men; 18 of these patients presented with cutaneous and/or visceral Kaposi's sarcoma. Seventy-nine percent of patients had previous or concurrent pulmonary opportunistic infections. Clinical presentation of pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma was indistinguishable from opportunistic pneumonia with respect to symptoms, physical examination results, and laboratory findings. Chest roentgenograms revealed a typical nodular pattern in only five patients. In contrast to AIDS-associated opportunistic pneumonia, the yield from fiberoptic bronchoscopy (24 percent) and open lung biopsy (56 percent) was low. Pathologically, Kaposi's sarcoma of the lung is less cellular than the cutaneous lesion. It is focal and scattered throughout the pulmonary interstitium, which may explain the difficulty in pre-mortem diagnosis.\r"

Differences noted among individuals in the magnitude of the bronchial response to a standardized preparation of CBE suggest variable airway reactivity. The mechanism of this response and the reasons for its variability among these naive subjects are unknown. We have studied this problem by performing bronchoalveolar lavage on 13 volunteer subjects with no history of textile dust exposure. Two to three months later, a bronchial provocation with aqueous CBE was performed by an investigator blinded to the lavage results. Subjects with greater than 20 percent drop in flow rate at 40 percent of vital capacity during a partial forced expiration (MEF 40 percent [P]) following CBE had a reduction in total recoverable alveolar macrophages, with a resultant increase in the percentage of recoverable lymphocytes. The magnitude of response (MEF 40 percent [P]) correlated directly with the measured lymphocyte percentage (r = 0.69 p less than 0.01) and inversely with the total numbers of recovered cells.\r"

Seven patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), were compared to 11 normal control subjects, nine patients with sarcoidosis, and six with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Total, differential cell counts and ACE determinations were performed on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in the ARDS group. ACE was detectable in the BAL of all but one ARDS patient. It was concluded that BAL ACE is elevated in some ARDS patients, especially those with infectious causes of lung injury. Increased ACE may reflect endothelial damage or local increase in ACE production in response to sepsis.\r"

Signs of inflammatory pericarditis were noted clinically in four patients and were found at autopsy in one. In the three nonoperated patients who died of aortic rupture leading to fatal hemopericardium, symptoms of pericarditis preceded fatal rupture of the aorta by four to five days. A fourth patient died after surgical repair of aortic dissection 35 days after the onset of pericarditis. In the fifth patient, manifestations of chronic constrictive pericardial disease occurred over a period of seven months after which old aortic dissection was first identified. In each case, the internal tear of classic aortic dissection was located in the ascending aorta. Microscopic evidence of cystic medial necrosis of the aorta was present in each case. In each of two cases, there was a congenital bicuspid aortic valve. The phenomenon observed represents acute aortic dissection in which slow penetration of blood into the pericardial space caused inflammatory pericarditis. The interval between the onset of pericarditis and rupture of the aorta may allow sufficient time for appropriate diagnosis and potentially lifesaving treatment of the aortic disease.\r"

Therefore, when unilateral interstitial pulmonary disease was present, positional change resulted in changes in right-to-left intrapulmonary shunt or low ventilation-perfusion ratios or both. Variability between patients can be explained by the nonhomogeneity of pulmonary disease in patients with respiratory failure.\r"

In addition, CT correctly localized sources of bleeding in 23 (88.5 percent) of the 26 patients in whom a site was identified at bronchoscopy, while CR localization was correct in 17 (65.4 percent) (p less than 0.05). Despite this augmentation of roentgenographic yield, information derived from CT scans influenced the management of only six patients, did not obviate the need for bronchoscopy, and supplemented the combined diagnostic yield of CR and bronchoscopy in only two. Outcome was changed in one patient in whom CT had demonstrated an otherwise unrecognized malignant solitary pulmonary nodule. The chest roentgenogram and fiberoptic bronchoscopy provided all the information essential for diagnosis and therapeutic recommendations in 93.7 percent of these patients. Although the CT provided additional information in over one half of our patients, its overall impact on clinical management was small and does not support routine use of this imaging procedure in evaluation of hemoptysis. The possible role of chest CT in evaluating carefully selected patients with hemoptysis requires further study.\r"

Eight normal subjects were studied on two separate days, before and after the bronchodilators were administered in a double blind manner. Both drugs resulted in significant and equivalent bronchodilatation. However, there were no significant changes in the density dependence of maximal flow or pulmonary resistance with either agent.

There were 35 women and 35 men with a mean age of 39 +/- 0.2 years. Toxic megacolon occurred at the initial episode of colitis in 43 patients (61 percent). Only five patients had a specific colitis: salmonellosis, two; ischemic, two; and pseudomembranous, one. Of the 65 remaining patients with nonspecific colitis, six had to be operated on without delay because of peritonitis. In the remaining 59 patients, toxic megacolon was cured with intensive medical management in nine (15 percent), improved temporarily in 14 (24 percent), and remained unchanged in 36 (61 percent). The postoperative mortality rate was 11 percent for all patients (6/56), 4 percent for patients without perforation (2/50) compared with 27 percent for patients with perforation (4/15). None of the patients who underwent surgery within five days of medical treatment died. When toxic megacolon was complicated by hemorrhage (nine patients) or peritonitis (eight patients), the mortality rate increased to 33 percent and 27 percent, respectively. A one-stage proctocolectomy was performed in 19 patients (32 percent). Of 32 patients in whom the rectum was retained, successful restoration of continuity was possible in only seven (22 percent) within 12 months after surgery. In well-selected patients, a plea is made for rectal preservation to offer an alternative to permanent ileostomy.\r"

Seventeen patients with chronic fistulas were treated by primary fistulotomy with curettage, or incision and drainage with insertion of seton. Patients were followed from three months to ten years with a mean follow-up of three years. No incidences of incontinence were reported in this series. The overall rate of recurrence was 18 percent, and included only patients with posterior abscesses and fistulas. Recurrence was related to the failure to maintain prolonged drainage in the midline after primary fistulotomy. The use of seton for delayed fistulotomy appears to promote wound drainage and precludes premature wound closure. More liberal use of the seton in the treatment of horseshoe abscesses and fistulas is advocated.\r"

The prognosis was worse for all patients treated operatively from 1970 to 1979 compared with 1960 to 1969 (P less than 0.03). After potentially curative resection, survival was worse from 1970 to 1979 compared with 1950 to 1959 (P less than 0.02) and 1960 to 1969 (P less than 0.01), respectively; the corresponding five-year survivals were 72.5 percent, 72.3 percent, and 61.5 percent. The curative resection rate for the three decades was similar (66 to 70 percent). An increase in the incidence of Dukes' Stage C tumors from 23.3 percent to 32.3 percent (P less than 0.01) explains, at least partly, the decreased survival. The worsened survival prospects were not accounted for by changes in referral pattern, tumor site, or in the proportion of sphincter-saving resections performed. The worsening was paradoxically paralleled by earlier symptomatic presentation (P less than 0.001). Analyses of other Australian data are required to test the hypothesis that the worsened survival prospects are consequent to altered tumor biologic aggressiveness, possibly related to differences in the causal factors operating over the 30-year study period.\r"

All patients had diarrhea and/or bloody stools (121 and 36, respectively). Less specific symptoms were common. Most patients had been exposed to multiple antibiotics, but of those who had received only one agent, cephalosporins were most common (21/43). Nineteen patients had cancer chemotherapy. C. difficile toxin assay was positive in 106, culture was positive in 74, and pseudomembranes were seen in six of the 39 patients who underwent endoscopy. Treatment consisted of stopping antibiotic therapy alone (86 percent response), oral vancomycin (88 percent response) or metronidazole (82 percent response). The overall mortality rate was 23 percent, due to C. difficile colitis in three of 31 cases. Many patients were receiving medications or had other diseases associated with fecal stasis. There is much circumstantial evidence to support a role for fecal stasis in the pathogenesis of C. difficile disease. Patients predisposed to colonic stasis who are receiving antibiotics should be considered at risk for this disease, and preventative measures should be taken to decrease stool transit times.\r"

In the cancer family syndrome group there were significantly more mucinous carcinomas (35 to 39 percent vs. 20 percent; P less than 0.05-0.01), and also more poorly differentiated tumors (24 vs. 12 percent) than in the control group. The differences could not be explained by the site or stage of the tumors or by the age or sex of the patients. Additional adenomas occurred quite often both in cancer family syndrome patients (19 percent) and in the controls (16 percent). In the cancer family syndrome group, however, there were more adenomas with moderate or severe dysplasia (P less than 0.01) and more adenomas with villous features (P less than 0.05) than in the control group. Mucinous histologic features in colorectal carcinoma, although not fully specific, might be characteristic of cancer family syndrome, and thus serve as one sign in the identification of the syndrome. The presence of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence in cancer family syndrome also was supported, and the histologic aggressivity of the associated adenomas might signify an accelerated advancement of this phenomenon in cancer family syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "The geographic and temporal variations in mortality from Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis were investigated. The validity of mortality data as indicators of morbidity was tested by comparing the death rates and incidences among different countries. Death rates from Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis were high in England, Germany, and the Scandinavian countries, and low in the Mediterranean countries. There was a significant correlation between the incidence and mortality of both diseases among different countries. In addition, the incidence and mortality of Crohn's disease were correlated with those of ulcerative colitis. In countries with a low mortality rate from Crohn's disease, the death rates in men tended to be higher than those in women. In contrast, countries with high death rates from Crohn's disease showed female predominance. No such relationship existed for ulcerative colitis. The overall change in mortality rates during the last 20 to 30 years was characterized by a rise of Crohn's disease and a marked fall of ulcerative colitis. In countries with a high mortality rate from Crohn's disease, the death rates started to fall in recent times. The significant correlations between incidence and mortality show that the death rates from both diseases represent reliable indicators of the morbidity and that the severity of the two diseases is similar in different countries. The marked temporal and geographic variations in both incidence and mortality suggest that environmental factors play an important role in the etiology of both diseases.\r"

The mean duration of follow-up to development of pelvic recurrence was 22 months. Depth of tumor invasion, presence of lymph node metastasis, and colloid features were found to correlate with pelvic recurrence. The recurrence rate in patients having anterior resections was the same as that of patients undergoing abdominoperineal resections. Patients having anterior resection with distal margins of 1 cm or less had an extremely high recurrence rate (36 percent). Pelvic recurrent did not continue to improve when the distal margins were extended over 2 cm. Microscopic lateral tumor extension, which is not removed during operation, appears to be the major determinant of local recurrence in rectal cancer.\r"

Preoperative urine putrescine levels were elevated similarly in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and malignancy. Polyamine levels were increased in all three groups in the early postoperative period. Urinary polyamine excretion did not correlate with serum CEA levels, tumor volume, or stage of disease in patients with cancer. Because elevated levels of urinary polyamines are not specific for malignancy and do not correlate with other prognostic indicators, such measurements are unlikely to be useful in tumor detection and determining prognosis. Polyamine levels, however, may prove useful in monitoring response to therapy and detecting recurrences in individual patients.\r"

The performance of these examinations was an individual effort on the part of the trainee without verbal or mechanical assistance from the instructor after the initial ten examinations. All were performed with an instructor viewing through a teaching attachment. Total insertion distance was greater than or equal to 30, greater than or equal to 40, greater than or equal to 50, greater than or equal to 60 cm in 65, 60, 46, and 20 percent of examinations, respectively. Overall performance was better in those with prior rigid sigmoidoscopic experience (20 examinations). The mean examination time was 11.8 minutes. These data help to define the appropriate length of fiberoptic sigmoidoscope recommended for use by inexperienced endoscopists.\r"

It often is difficult to maintain proper balance among these dynamic factors; imbalance prevents deep insertion. Over-elongation of the scope leads to insertion failure, particularly if there are adhesions of the sigmoid colon, overextension of the colon, or transverse colon ptosis. Our \"leading cord\" method is an excellent aid to colonofiberscopy. It can be inserted from the clamp hole of a conventional fiberscope and hardened to straighten the scope, thereby permitting deep insertion. With this technique the region from the rectum to the descending colon, as well as a ptosed transverse colon, can be straightened. Our clinical experience indicates that the rate of successful insertions in colonofiberscopy will be increased considerably with this complementary device.\r"

The mean level of the cancer from the dentate line was 9 cm (range, 5 to 16 cm). The mean follow-up has been 29 months (range, four to 58 months). Perioperative mortality was 2.5 percent (two patients). Technical problems related to the stapling technique occurred in 6 percent (five patients). The clinical anastomotic leak rate was 8 percent (six patients). There were 11 local recurrences among 68 curative resections (16 percent). Local recurrence according to individual surgeon showed marked variability (range, 0-43 percent, P greater than 0.05). There were no differences in location, differentiation, or stage in those that recurred. The mean distal resection margin for the recurrent cancer group was 3.0 cm and for the nonrecurrent group, 2.9 cm. Disturbances of continence were seen commonly (56 percent) in the first three months after surgery, but 85 percent of patients became fully continent with an acceptable bowel habit at later follow-up. The double stapling technique is useful for the restorative resection of suitable mid and low rectal cancers. The anastomotic leak rate, local recurrence rate, and functional results are acceptable.\r"

Colonoscopy provided the added advantage of endoscopic polypectomy at the diagnostic session itself. The yield of granulomas in tuberculous lesions was 100 percent, although acid-fast bacilli could not be recovered from any. The endoscopic picture of amebic colitis often resembles that of inflammatory bowel disease; hence endoscopic biopsies are of paramount importance in establishing a correct diagnosis, especially in developing countries where both diseases exist with considerable frequency.\r"

It is as yet unsettled whether these changes represent a real fall in ulcer incidence or are only due to changes in the practices of treatment and coding of gastric and duodenal ulcer. Based on monthly surveys among random samples of office-based physicians from different specialities and regions in the United States, the National Disease and Therapeutic Index (NDTI) publishes annual information on how often physicians were visited for different kinds of diseases. The physician visits for gastric and duodenal ulcer between 1958 and 1984 were used to study the time trends of gastric and duodenal ulcer disease. The visits for duodenal ulcer markedly declined during the past 20 years. The decline in duodenal ulcer involved first and subsequent visits and both sexes similarly. The rate of first visits for gastric ulcer declined in men but remained unchanged in women. From 1958 to 1984, the rate of all visits for gastric ulcer decreased in men and increased slightly in women. The ratio of male over female ulcer disease decreased in both ulcer types. For duodenal ulcer, this change resulted predominantly from a steeper decline in men than in women rather than from an increase of female ulcer disease. For gastric ulcer, the relative rise of female ulcer disease was most marked in the old age groups. The similarity between the temporal trends of visits for gastric and duodenal ulcer and other statistics of ulcer morbidity suggest that these trends reflect real changes in the occurrence of the two diseases.\r"

Medical treatment for this disorder is sometimes not satisfactory. We report the manometric and clinical effects of myotomy in four patients with high-amplitude peristaltic contractions who underwent surgery because of the severity of their symptoms and recalcitrance to various medical treatments. Manometry 1-5 years after surgery showed a reduction in amplitude, duration, and percent bipeaked waves at 5 and 10 cm above the lower esophageal sphincter. Peristalsis was abolished or decreased in the distal 10 cm of the esophageal body but was not affected more proximally. Lower esophageal sphincter pressure was decreased in all patients. The manometric changes were least marked in one patient, who was the only one who had some chest pain when last seen five years after myotomy. We conclude that in severely symptomatic patients with high-amplitude peristaltic contractions, myotomy results in marked manometric changes and marked clinical improvement. Patients with this disorder and whose chest pain is recalcitrant to extensive medical therapy may be successfully treated by surgical myotomy.\r"

Iced water caused reduced strength, increased duration, and reduced velocity of distal esophageal contractions. It also reduced the force of lower esophageal sphincteric contraction, an effect that was more transient than that seen in the esophageal body, but it did not alter the magnitude of sphincteric relaxation. Esophageal responses in normal subjects with water at the two temperatures were not affected by isosorbide denitrate. The responses to iced water in the two patients with esophageal spasm were qualitatively similar to those in normal subjects. These findings indicate that cooling brings about a transient state of relative paralysis in the distal esophagus and lower esophageal sphincter. Taken in conjunction with other observations, they are consistent with the notion that cold-induced chest pain, whether in normal subjects or in patients with esophageal motor disorders, is related to esophageal distension.\r"

NTLI was measured by radioimmunoassay using both specific C and N terminally directed antisera. The results showed: Basal NTLI levels are similar in controls, after PCS, and in CRF. A liquid fat meal produces a single early peak of NTLI and levels are greater after PCS than in controls or CRF. Levels return much more slowly to basal in CRF and after PCS. Thus it is likely that both the liver and kidney are involved in the metabolism and clearance of NTLI.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-five postcholecystectomy (PC) patients who underwent a diagnostic work-up for persistent diarrhea and six control subjects were studied. Fourteen of the 25 patients were also characterized by conditions other than PC which could play a role in the pathogenesis of the diarrhea. However, none of the patients had evidence of ileal disease or resection. The average follow-up of the patients after the study was approximately 4.4 years. Excretion, composition, and aqueous-phase concentrations of fecal bile acids were analyzed using gas-liquid chromatography. Eleven of the 25 PC patients showed an increased fecal bile acid excretion. In three of the 11 patients, the magnitude of the bile acid loss, which ranged from 2.26 to 3.34 mmol/24 hr, indicated the presence of severe bile acid malabsorption. The fecal bile acid composition showed a significant shift from secondary to primary bile acids. In spite of the presence of marked bile acid malabsorption, the aqueous-phase concentrations of the dihydroxy bile acids, chenodeoxycholic and deoxycholic acids, did not, with one exception, reach the secretory level of 1.5 mM. The relatively low aqueous concentrations were the result of low bile acid solubility, due to an acidic fecal pH. Only two of nine patients, one with severe, and the other with equivocal bile acid malabsorption, who were treated with cholestyramine, showed an improvement of the diarrhea. The findings of subsecretory bile acid concentrations in the fecal aqueous phase and of inconsistent therapeutic responses to cholestyramine indicate that, in spite of the presence of bile acid malabsorption, the diarrhea was, with few exceptions, not bile acid-induced. The results of the study also suggest that the diarrhea in many PC patients is multifactorial in origin.\r"

Weight-matched groups of Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into controls fed Rodent-Blox ad libitum; American Institute of Nutrition-76 (AIN-76) diet containing 12% calories as fat with 36% of carbohydrate calories replaced with 5% (weight/volume) concentration of ethanol fed ad libitum pair fed with animals given isocaloric amounts of AIN-76 diet for three to six months. Compared with Rodent-Blox fed controls, tissue content of trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, amylase, and lipase; specific activity and concentration of trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen; and concentration of amylase were decreased at six months in AIN-76 fed controls. These changes did not result from diminished food intake, but were due to adaptation to the liquid diet. Animals fed AIN-76 diet plus ethanol did not show significant difference in the total content, specific activity, concentration, and secretion of digestive enzymes compared with those animals pair fed isocaloric amounts of AIN-76 diet. Activation of trypsinogen by exogenous trypsin was lower in rats fed AIN-76 diet and a similar change was observed in animals fed AIN-76 diet with ethanol for six months. These findings are in contrast to increased secretion of proteases and decreased trypsin inhibitor observed previously in animals fed ethanol in a diet containing \"high\" fat. These data indicate that ethanol effect on the pancreas is modified by dietary intake of fat and/or carbohydrates.\r"

It is not clear whether the effects are mediated by direct or indirect effects. The present study was done to determine the effect of threshold doses of neurotensin in vivo in the rat as well as in vitro to clarify whether the action is direct or indirect. For in vivo studies the pancreatic duct of rats was cannulated and threshold doses of neurotensin and CCK-8 alone or in combination were infused as an intravenous bolus and pancreatic juice collected at 10-min intervals for 1 hr. For in vitro studies dissociated lobules and acini were incubated for 1 hr with 10(-11) -10(-6) M neurotensin with or without 10(-9) M CCK-8 (maximally effective dose). Amylase secretion in the pancreatic juice or in the medium was determined. Neurotensin and CCK-8 at a dose of 50 pM/kg increased pancreatic protein secretion in vivo. Neurotensin in combination with CCK-8 did not potentiate protein secretion. In the pancreatic lobules and acini, neurotensin 10(-11) -10(-6) M alone or in combination with CCK-8 (10(-9) M) did not stimulate amylase secretion above the basal level or that stimulated with CCK-8. The combined data indicate that the effect of neurotensin is not mediated by a direct action on the pancreatic acinar cells.\r"

  ".U": "87079957\r", 
  ".W": "In a dog with megaesophagus, we studied the upper (UES) and lower (LES) esophageal sphincter responses to swallowing, the UES response to intraesophageal balloon distension and acid perfusion, the fasting LES, stomach and upper small bowel motor activity, and the LES response to intraesophageal balloon distension. The findings were compared to those in two normal dogs. In normal dogs, balloon distension (10-40 cc) and acid perfusion (0.1-0.4 N HCl) at 5, 10, and 15 cm distal to the UES produced up to 200% and 100% increases in UES pressure, respectively. Fasting LES activity in these dogs was coupled to the cyclical migrating motor complex (MMC) activity of the stomach and intestine, with phase I, random phase II, and phase III employing 40%, 40%, and 20% of cycle time, respectively. Balloon distension (10-40 cc) at 5, 10, and 15 cm proximal to the LES in phases I, II, and III produced 80-100% relaxation of the sphincter. In the dog with megaesophagus: the UES and LES response to swallowing was normal; balloon distension (10-40 cc) in the upper esophagus produced no significant increase (P greater than 0.05) in UES pressure while acid perfusion (0.1-0.4 N HCl) produced a significant but relatively smaller increase (50%) in UES pressures; phase I MMC activity in this dog was absent or very short in duration (less than 5% cycle time), the activity mostly alternating between phases II and III (75-80% and 20% cycle time, respectively); and balloon distension in the distal esophagus (up to 80 cc) induced no observable relaxation (less than 10%) of the LES. Conclusion: The normal UES and LES response to swallowing and the presence of cyclical MMC activity in the LES indicates that the efferent neural pathways, at least to these areas, are intact in the dog with megaesophagus. Absence or decreased response of the UES and LES to intraluminal stimuli suggests that at least the afferent component of the reflex neural pathways is faulty in idiopathic megaesophagus. The location of the defect is yet to be determined.\r"

  ".U": "87079958\r", 
  ".W": "Eight patients with a short bowel resulting from intestinal resection and clinically stable for at least one year were studied for 10 days. The diet chosen was lactose-free with a low fiber content and contained 22% of total calories as protein, 32% as carbohydrate, and 46% as fat. Total fluid volume was kept constant, and all patients were in positive nitrogen balance. During the 10-day period, blood chemical concentrations, stool, and/or ostomy volume, urine volume, electrolyte excretion, and calorie and divalent cation absorption were measured. In addition it was determined that fluid restriction during meals did not affect these parameters. In these patients the absorptions of fat, carbohydrate, protein, and total calories were 54%, 61%, 81%, and 62%, respectively. Similarly the absorption of the divalent cations, calcium, magnesium, and zinc, were 32%, 34%, and 15%, respectively. We suggest that patients with short bowel syndrome, who have been stable for at least one year and who can tolerate oral diets, do not need to restrict fat or to separate fluids from solids during their meals. Furthermore, they should increase their oral intake to 35-40 kcal/kg ideal body weight in order to counteract their increased losses. The diet should contain 80-100 g protein/day in order to maintain a positive nitrogen balance and a large margin of safety. In addition, these patients may take oral supplementation of calcium, magnesium, and zinc to maintain divalent cation balance.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the role of the substantia nigra (SN) in kindling, electrical stimulation of the SN was delivered at various times before or after stimulation of the amygdala (AM) or pyriform cortex during or after kindling in rats. The results were as follows: Ipsilateral SN stimulation delivered prior to each AM kindling stimulation for 14 days significantly retarded the appearance of Stage 4 and 5 seizures and shortened the afterdischarge (AD) duration. Bilateral SN prestimulation blocked seizure generalization in some AM- or pyriform cortex-kindled animals, prolonged the latency to bilateral forelimb clonus in others, and shortened the AD duration of the kindled seizure in a current intensity-dependent fashion. These effects were only partially antagonized by haloperidol, but were completely abolished by picrotoxin. The picrotoxin alone significantly reduced the latency. Almost no effect was found when the SN stimulation was delivered after the onset of bilateral forelimb clonus. We conclude that the SN might be an important mediator of the early aspects of seizure generalization from limbic epileptic foci. The relative involvements of GABAergic gamma-aminobutyric acid and dopaminergic systems of the SN in this inhibitory function are discussed.\r"

We further investigated the role of the GABA/benzodiazepine/picrotoxinin receptor complex in the epileptic focus and also in other regions of the rat brain. The focus was induced by cobalt implantation to the right motor cortex, and the brains were dissected 16-19 days after the operation. Benzodiazepine (using [3H]flunitrazepam as a ligand; FLU), GABA [3H]muscimol; MUS), and picrotoxinin [( 35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate; TBPS) receptor bindings were measured in different brain areas and the values were compared with glass-implanted controls. In the focal area, the specific receptor binding decreased in the order TBPS greater than FLU greater than MUS. In the perifocal area only TBPS binding decreased, and Scatchard analysis showed a decrease in the number of binding sites (p less than 0.05) without any effect on binding affinity. No change was seen in the binding characteristics of the other areas studied. According to our results, in cobalt-induced epilepsy the GABA/benzodiazepine/picrotoxinin receptor complex is modulated in the focal area; this may lead to a defect in chloride conductance, which in turn induces disturbed control of neuronal activity in the epileptic focus.\r"

There is also the possibility of epileptic fathers or mothers playing a role in the production of congenital malformations in their offspring. We have used the technique of sister chromatid exchange (SCE), a sensitive indicator of mutagenicity, to observe the mutagenic susceptibility in both male and female epileptic patients in different age groups prior to and after anticonvulsant therapy, and with respect to control. The frequency of SCE was significantly higher in all the age groups for treated and untreated cases compared with control. Between treated and untreated subjects in age group 26-50 years, a significantly higher SCE frequency was observed in the untreated patients (p less than 0.01). Similarly, untreated male patients showed a significantly higher SCE frequency (p less than 0.025) compared with treated male patients. Although the results of this study provide a general assessment of mutagenicity in epileptic patients that agrees with other studies and emphasizes the role of the disease in the higher occurrence of congenital malformation in their offspring, the importance of higher SCE frequency in untreated patients remains to be explained in further studies.\r"

Cytosol ERs were measured in endocervical tissue obtained by biopsy within 3 days of ovulation (determined by the endogenous luteinizing hormone [LH] surge) in five infertile women with persistent poor preovulatory CM (group 1) and in endocervical tissue obtained in the late follicular phase in eight ovulatory women with excellent CM (group 2). ER concentrations were measured in Fmol/mg protein by the dextran-coated charcoal separation method (New England Nuclear Kit, Boston, MA). CM score evaluation and measurement of serum estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P) levels were performed concomitantly. Serum E2 levels of 123.4 +/- 29.3 pg/ml (mean +/- standard error of the mean [SEM]) in group 1 were comparable to E2 levels of 123.3 +/- 15.0 pg/ml in group 2. Serum P concentrations of 0.9 +/- 0.27 ng/ml in group 1 were comparable to 0.79 +/- 0.29 in group 2. A CM score of 4.6 +/- 0.69 in group 1 was significantly lower than 11.6 +/- 0.53 in group 2 (P less than 0.01). The cytosol ER was negative in four of five women in group 1, whereas in group 2, ER was positive in six, borderline in one, and negative in one subject. This study suggests that cytosol ER may be deficient in some women with cervical factor.\r"

Tissue samples were obtained from 28 women, grouped as follows: group A, 12 premenopausal controls; group B, 7 perimenopausal women who received estrogen 7 to 11 days before operation; and group C, 9 perimenopausal and postmenopausal women who received estrogen as in group B plus P injection 1 to 3 hours before operation. Estrogen administration resulted in a significant rise in total P receptor levels in the cervix, compared with the endometrium and myometrium. P injection after estrogen priming resulted in down-regulation of the P receptor in the cervix to undetectable levels, whereas in the endometrium and myometrium it resulted only in redistribution of the P receptor, with higher nuclear levels and lower cytosol levels. These results indicate the possibility of a different mechanism of regulation of the P receptor in the human cervix, compared with that in the endometrium and myometrium.\r"
