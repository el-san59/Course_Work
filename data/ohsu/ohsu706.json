They have been made legal documents in 38 states in the United States. Living wills permit advance expression of a patient's wishes, promote effective communication and demonstrate respect for the patient as a person. Problems with legal recognition of such wills include the need for agreement on fundamental terms, possible restriction of patients' rights, limitation of options in decision-making and possible negative effects on the physician-patient relationship. Before legislation is enacted, public and professional attitudes toward the care of terminally ill patients should be assessed. All health care professionals should receive better education in this area, and palliative care services should be made more widely available. Only if these measures fail should living wills be made legal documents in Canada.\r"

The FCA conducted a manual record linkage to link these data to the national registry of reported cases. The rate of underreporting was 12% (8/65) for the VLAS and 18% (12/66) for the TSCS. The specific diagnosis was not related to the rate of underreporting. For the TSCS the rate of underreporting had increased from 0% in 1983-84 to 44% in 1987-88 (p = 0.001). Differences in the observed rates of underreporting between the two studies are likely the result of differences in the reporting responsibilities of physicians involved in the studies.\r"

Three of 295 patients (1.02%) evaluated at Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN) for testicular germ cell malignancy between 1935 and 1944 had evidence of bilateral testicular malignancy. Two of these were synchronous and one metachronous occurring 3 years after the first diagnosis. In all three, the histology was pure seminoma. None of these three had a history of undescended testes. Both patients with synchronous tumours died within 2 years (6 months and 2 years, respectively) in spite of appropriate treatment at that time, and the one with metachronous tumor survived long-term (47 years). During the modern chemotherapy era, 16 of 500 (3.2%) patients evaluated at the Mayo Clinic Rochester between 1977 and 1986 for testicular germ cell malignancy had evidence of bilateral testicular cancers (four of these were synchronous and 12 metachronous [eight seminomas, four non-seminomas]) occurring between 1 to 15 years after the first diagnosis. Only two of 16 had a history of undescended testes surgically corrected while the patients were in their teens. All patients did well after appropriate treatment. This study reemphasizes the small but definite risk for development of a second testicular malignancy and suggests a recent increase in incidence of bilateral testicular tumors as possibly related to improved treatment modalities with a higher cure rate of the original tumor.\r"

The authors examined 1193 cases using light microscopy. Of the 1078 cases with technically acceptable histologic sections, 134 tumors contained 100 or more lymphocytes per 20 high-power (X400) microscopic fields (20 HPF). The prevalence was 12.4%. This was designated the \"high lymphocytic\" group. An equivalent number of cases with fewer lymphocytes comprised the \"low lymphocytic\" group. The survival rate at 15 years was 36.7% for patients in the high lymphocytic group and 69.6% for patients in the low lymphocytic group. Using the Cox model, the authors found that an increased number of lymphocytes per 20 HPF was significantly associated with decreased survival (chi-square = 21.2, P = less than 0.0001). A significant association was observed even when we controlled for other risk factors (chi-square = 6.98, P = 0.008).\r"

Fresh specimens surgically removed from 117 patients with gastric cancer were investigated by flow cytometric study using a monoclonal antibody to bromodeoxyuridine. DNA ploidy patterns were classified into four types according to the bivariate BrdUrd/DNA distribution: D1, tumors with single diploid population; D2, tumors which showed mosaic of diploid and aneuploid population; A1, tumors with single aneuploid population; and A2, several aneuploid populations without diploid population. The numbers of cases of each ploidy pattern were as follows: D1, 36 cases (30.8%); D2, 38 cases (32.5%); A1, 15 cases (12.8%); and A2, 27 cases (23.1%). DNA ploidy pattern and S-phase fraction (SPF) showed no relation with clinicopathologic findings, except for type A2. In type A2, lymph node metastasis and lymphatic vessel invasion were observed more often than type D1. The SPF calculated from the bivariate BrdUrd/DNA distribution was higher in aneuploidy (D2, A1, and A2) than in diploidy (D1) (P less than 0.01). Also, A2 exhibited a higher SPF than A1 (P less than 0.01). Furthermore, SPF correlated with DNA index significantly (P less than 0.01). Patients who showed aneuploid tumors, DNA ploidy type A2, or SPF of more than 10% survived 3 years less than those with diploid tumors, DNA ploidy type D1, or SPF of less than 10%, respectively (P less than 0.05). By analyzing with the Cox's proportional hazard's model, it is revealed that DNA ploidy and SPF are one of the independent factors of prognostic significance. The results indicated that the patients with aneuploid tumors or highly proliferative tumors had a poor prognosis and that DNA ploidy pattern and SPF were useful prognostic factors for gastric cancers.\r"

  ".W": "Regional ploidy variations within individual tumors were analyzed by in-situ cytofluorometry of metaphase cells in Feulgen-stained paraffin sections, using 45 resected stomachs with early and advanced signet ring cell carcinomas. Aneuploid cells were found in one of 30 early cancers and in eight of 15 advanced cancers, and were almost always accompanied by diploid cancer cells in the mucosal part of the cancers. The diploid and the aneuploid cells were generally found to be distributed in different territories in the mucosa, and aneuploid foci were often included in the diploid area. These findings suggest the diploid origin of signet ring cell carcinomas and the occurrence of aneuploidy during the tumor development. Moreover, the aneuploid cells appeared to infiltrate beyond the mucosa more readily than the diploid cells; most of the aneuploid populations already invaded the extramucosal tissue, and the cancer cells infiltrating in the extramucosal tissue were predominantly aneuploid in six of the nine cancers with aneuploidy. Thus, it appears that the occurrence of aneuploid clones may accelerate the progression of signet ring cell carcinomas from early to advanced stages.\r"

The observations included the following: (1) hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) status, (2) histologic types, (3) degree of cellular differentiation, and (4) frequency and types of the accompanying cirrhosis. Serum HBsAg was positive in 56.7% of HCC patients and 5.7% of controls (P less than 0.001). Immunohistochemical localization of HBsAg was positive in 53.3% in normal hepatocytes and in 10% in neoplastic cells. Morphologically, mixed type HCC (48.4%), trabecular (31.4%), and compact variants (13.5%) were predominant. Clear cell and pseudoglandular variants were rare (less than 1%). The majority of tumors (83%) were poorly differentiated HCC (Grades: 2-3, 3, 3-4, and 4). Well-differentiated HCC were extremely rare (0.5%). Fifty percent of HCC arose in a cirrhotic liver, predominantly of the macronodular (67.4%) inactive (55%) type. The micronodular cirrhosis was very uncommon (1.1%). These findings clearly show the excess of poorly differentiated HCC in African patients and suggest a possible link between the morphologic features of HCC in Africa and its extraordinary fast-running course.\r"

Follow-up data were available on 35 patients. Tumors with adenocarcinomatous components, or those resembling small cell carcinomas of the lung, were excluded. Eighty-one tumors were in the rectum and three tumors were in the distal sigmoid colon. Neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin, and Leu-7 were positive in 87%, 58%, and 53% of the tumors, respectively. Hormones were positive in the following percentages: serotonin, 45%; pancreatic polypeptide, 46%; glucagon, 10%; gastrin, 3%; somatostatin, 3%; adrenocorticotrophic hormone, 1%; cholecystokinin, 0%; calcitonin, 0%; and insulin, 0%. Many tumors elaborated more than one hormone. Fifty-five percent of the tumors were argyrophil and 28% were argentaffin. Carcinoembryonic antigen was present in 24% of the tumors; 82% of the tumors contained prostatic acid phosphatase. Three patients had liver metastases; their tumors ulcerated, invaded muscularis propria, and had more than 2 mitoses per 10 high-power fields (HPF). One patient with a 2.5-cm tumor without mitoses had regional lymph node metastases. All non-metastasizing tumors had less than one mitosis in 10 HPF. We conclude that large bowel carcinoid tumors are essentially limited to the rectum and sigmoid, that they are indolent if mitotically inactive and smaller than 2 cm, and that most show production of a selected group of endocrine markers.\r"

The DNA content of 99 ovarian carcinomas was determined by flow cytometric analysis of nuclei obtained from paraffin-embedded tissue. Of the 99 tumors, 51 were diploid and 48 showed one or more aneuploid peaks. The 5-year survival for patients with diploid tumors (50%) was significantly higher than for patients with aneuploid tumors (22%) (P less than 0.01). Other factors which significantly affected survival were clinical stage (P less than 0.001), tumor pattern grade (P less than 0.01), DNA index (P less than 0.01), the presence of ascites (P less than 0.001), peritoneal carcinomatosis (P less than 0.0001), and residual tumor at second-look laparotomy (P less than 0.05). Diameter of the primary ovarian tumor, diameter of the largest peritoneal implant before debulking, and the percent S-phase had no significant correlation with survival. Of 16 patients with aneuploid tumors who underwent second-look laparotomy, nine (56%) had residual tumor, compared to six of 22 of patients with diploid tumors (27%). Of seven patients with aneuploid tumors and a negative second-look laparotomy, four (57%) died from recurrent tumor. By comparison, of 16 patients with diploid tumors and a negative second-look laparotomy, only four (25%) died from recurrent tumor. The determination of DNA ploidy in ovarian carcinomas may be used as an adjunct in predicting tumor behavior, response to chemotherapy, and late recurrence of disease.\r"

Each type of carcinoma constitutes a discrete group in reference to gross features, histologic and ultrastructural cell types, and the nature of the scar. The scar in Type I carcinomas appears mostly desmoplastic. The majority of Type II carcinomas appear to have arisen around a preexisting histoplasmosis granuloma which contains yeast organisms on microscopic examination. Pulmonary scar carcinoma is not a single discrete clinicopathologic entity. It appears that peripheral carcinomas of different histogenesis are incorporated in this category.\r"

Fifty-one patients with breast cancer enrolled in protocols that included the orally administered medications Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide) and/or prednisone were interviewed and assessed at five points in time over a 6-month period. Two summary measures of patient nonadherence derived by self-report were developed: (1) dosage, the overall percentage of drug missed during 26 weeks of treatment; and (2) behavioral, the percentage of behavioral events or prescribing occasions on which a criterion level of drug was missed. Twenty-two patients (43%) met criteria for noncompliance according to both behavioral and dosage definitions. Univariate analyses showed more nonadherence in the clinic and private community settings than in the academic setting. Stepwise multiple logistic regression analyses assessed the contribution of patient demographic, psychologic, and physical symptom factors on patient noncompliance. In the regression analyses patient noncompliance was associated with (1) treatment location, more nonadherence in the private community-based treatment sector than in the academic setting; and (2) income, more nonadherence among those having lower incomes. In assessing total dose requirements in clinical research trials, rates of patient nonadherence need to be considered, and treatment location controlled.\r"

Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seropositivity was confirmed in five of the cases, and tissue HBsAg was shown in four of these using the Shikata's orcein stain. An associated maternal HBsAg seropositivity was shown in two of the seropositive children. The youngest seropositive patient who developed PHC was 7 years old. The mother of this patient was also seropositive. These observations support a causal relation between childhood Hepatitis B virus infection and PHC. The importance of vertical or perinatal transmission of HBV in the causation of childhood PHC and the prophylactic role of childhood vaccination is emphasized. Attention is also drawn to the relative short malignant transformation time seen in some of these patients.\r"

  ".U": "90090374\r", 
  ".W": "The incidence and mortality rates of primary liver cancer (PLC) among residents of Brooklyn, New York, were studied for 1976 through 1983. Standardized race and sex-specific incidence and mortality rates and rate ratios were computed and compared with overall US rates as reported by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. The results indicate a significant excess of PLC among all race and sex groupings. A comparison of the degree of agreement between incidence and mortality data for Brooklyn residents showed excellent agreement among male patients with PLC and adequate agreement among female patients with PLC. Next, the effect of occupation on PLC mortality among Brooklyn residents was assessed. Specific occupations found to be at excess risk for PLC are private household workers (ratio of observed to expected cases [O/E] = 4.34; P less than 0.0001), non-domestic cleaning and food and beverage service workers (O/E = 2.59; P less than 0.0001), protective service workers (O/E = 1.78; P = 0.035), and transport equipment operatives (O/E = 1.52; P = 0.027). Since the distribution of Brooklyn workers employed in these occupations was found to be similar to the distribution of all US workers employed in these occupations, it is unlikely that these occupational risk factors can explain the observed excess of PLC among Brooklyn residents. The effects of non-occupational risk factors for PLC were then assessed using multiple regression analysis. The only non-occupational risk factor found to be associated with PLC among Brooklyn residents was cirrhosis of the liver (P = 0.0072). It is interesting that of the four occupations found to be at excess risk for PLC in this study, three have been previously shown to be at excess risk for cirrhosis mortality. Moreover, Brooklyn residents have cirrhosis mortality rates that are approximately two times higher than US rates. These facts, coupled with the findings of this study, support the hypothesis that the excess of PLC observed among Brooklyn residents might be related to an excess of cirrhosis of the liver in the same population, and thus provide support for an etiologic role of cirrhosis in the pathogenesis of PLC.\r"

The strongest predictor was the patient perception item, \"perception of needs addressed that day.\" Other predictors were perception of emotional support provided by the physician, age (older), and one physician behavior, \"discusses treatment.\" Patient perceptions of needs met or emotional support provided were predicted by perceptions of the occurrence of physician behaviors involving information such as the diagnosis and tests and treatment. Overall, patient perceptions of physician behaviors were stronger predictors of patient satisfaction than the actual occurrence or absence of those behaviors.\r"

Only one child, who had been symptomatic for 1.5 years, had a scan positive for metastasis at diagnosis. Scans in three additional children became positive (in one after the development of metastatic disease involving bone and soft tissue but not bone marrow 2 years after the diagnosis of retinoblastoma, and in two others after the development of osteosarcoma at 10.5 and 16 years from the diagnosis of retinoblastoma). Our data indicate that bone scans should not remain as part of the initial staging of patients with bilateral retinoblastoma unless there is clinical or pathologic evidence of extraocular disease at diagnosis. The performance of skeletal scintigraphy also is not warranted, with the expectation of diagnosing a second malignant neoplasm (namely osteosarcoma).\r"

T-staging of NPC was made according to the International Union Against Cancer (UICC) TNM classification system, depending on clinical findings and conventional radiograph examinations (not including CT). CT images were valuable for detection of the primary tumor involvement of the skull base region in NPC. Furthermore, bone target CT images were better for searching for subtle bony changes. Therefore, we recommend that CT should be used in T-staging of NPC systematically. When CT is used as one of the staging criteria, some patients with NPC with subtle bony changes will be upstaged.\r"

Fourteen have borne 22 children after treatment. Seventeen women in the series have died, 11 from dysgerminoma. Actuarial survival, only counting deaths from dysgerminoma, was 83% at 5 years. No patient has died of dysgerminoma since 1963 when radiotherapy with megavoltage x-rays was introduced.

The authors conclude that the combination of mitoxantrone and high-dose cytosine arabinoside has significant activity in adults with refractory acute lymphocytic leukemia. The addition of colony-stimulating growth factors to the intensive chemotherapy, and the use of the combination regimen as part of front-line maintenance intensification therapy may further improve the prognosis in these patients.\r"

A limited battery of immunocytochemical stains, including kappa (k) and lambda (l) light chains and Leu-4, was performed in 104 aspirates. On hundred twenty-eight of the FNA were diagnostic of or consistent with lymphoma, and three were diagnostic of carcinoma. Twenty-eight were considered negative for malignancy and 79 were suspicious for lymphoma or were nondiagnostic. For 135 of the FNA, a histologic biopsy specimen was available for comparison purposes. Overall, only one false-positive result was seen in a specimen lacking immunocytochemical data. The sensitivity of FNA lymphoma diagnosis was 66%. False-negative results due to sampling error were not uncommon, giving a predictive value of a negative result as 42%. The classification of the lymphomas by FNA was identical to that of the surgical biopsy in 86% of specimens and concurrently discrepant in 6%. We conclude that the routine performance of immunocytochemical studies on FNA of IA/RP masses is a feasible and valuable technique. Whereas suboptimal sensitivity and sampling error may make a negative diagnosis unreliable, lymphoma marker studies (combined with morphology) allow for an accurate and confident diagnosis and subclassification of lymphoma in the majority of cases.\r"

Interferon was given through an Ommaya reservoir connected by a catheter to the tumor cavity. Side effects of interferon therapy occurred in only one patient and consisted of nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills after each treatment, presumably due to rapid diffusion of interferon into ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Problems with the Ommaya reservoir (obstruction in two patients and infection in four patients) led to six patients being terminated from the study, and represent the major difficulty with this form of therapy. Although this was primarily a study of interferon toxicity, of 12 evaluable patients, 3 had stable disease for 148, 192, and 539 days; 9 had progressive disease. In addition, we tested the effect of IFN-beta ser17 on the growth of early passage in vitro cultures of malignant gliomas established from patients. Growth inhibition varied from 0% to more than 50%. In all cultures evaluated, the combination of recombinant gamma-interferon plus IFN-beta ser17 enhanced growth inhibition. Further clinical and laboratory study is necessary to better define the therapeutic efficacy of IFN-beta ser17 and the role of combinations of interferons in the treatment of malignant gliomas.\r"

The authors report an increase in specific binding of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligands in certain human brain tumors using computer assisted quantitative image analysis of autoradiograms. Higher densities of binding sites to a 3H-labeled selective peripheral benzodiazepine ligand, PK11195 [1-(2-chlorophenyl-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide] were observed in human gliomas as the malignancy of these tumors increased. Specific binding was also present in some non-glial tumors but little binding was demonstrated in necrotic tissue or normal brain. In in vitro binding studies in rats, there was a significant increase in Bmax (1089.3 +/- 232.2 fmol/mg tissue) in C6 glial tumors and LK Walker 256 metastatic tumors (924.2 +/- 183.7) compared with normal brain (62.1 +/- 12.8 fmol/mg tissue). Binding affinities were, however, similar (Kd = 2.09, 2.17, and 2.04 nmol/l, respectively). These findings suggest that the number of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors are increased in brain tumors. These receptors could be utilized in positron emission tomography to image brain tumors.\r"

Different tumor cell lines were injected into the systemic arterial circulation of syngeneic or nude mice, and they were killed at timed intervals after injection or when they became paraplegic. The following observations were made. The tumor cells lodged and grew in the hematopoietic bone marrow of the vertebrae. Cancer cells in the vertebral marrow cavity invaded into the spinal canal through the foramina of the vertebral veins rather than destroying the cortical bone. Tumor cell lines that grew in an infiltrative fashion migrated toward a posterior location in the spinal canal, and compressed the spinal cord from a posterior direction. Tumor cell lines that grew as compact tumors formed a tumor mass at the same location from which the cells emerged from the vertebra, and compressed the cord predominantly from an anterior direction. Radiographic evidence of vertebral metastasis was a late event, and commonly associated with significant compression of the cord and extraosseous tumor. These experimental findings may help to establish better diagnostic and treatment strategies for patients with metastatic disease of the spine.\r"

Ninety-two patients, aged 80 or older (mean age, 84 +/- 3.7 years) and all severely incapacitated (18 with an associated pathologic condition or in critical condition with terminal heart failure), underwent a valvuloplasty procedure. Femoral access was used in all cases except seven (8%), in whom the femoral route had to be abandoned and the brachial approach was used due to severe arterial tortuosity. Peak-to-peak ventriculoaortic gradient decreased from 71 +/- 27 to 27 +/- 15 mm Hg, and the aortic valve area increased from 0.48 +/- 0.16 to 0.91 +/- 0.35 cm2 (p less than 0.01). Thirty-two percent had a postprocedure aortic valve area more than or equal to 1 cm2. The final valve area was less than or equal to 0.7 cm2 in 30% of the patients. There were three deaths (ages, 82, 92, and 98 years) in the procedure room. One stroke occurred 1 day after the procedure. Hematoma or thrombosis at the femoral puncture site was observed in 14 cases (15%), requiring surgical repair in only five cases. Three patients died in the hospital; the total in-hospital mortality was 6.5%. Among the 62 patients about whom information could be obtained at a mean follow-up interval of 13 +/- 5 months, there were 18 late deaths (mean age, 85 +/- 11 years). The majority of the surviving 44 patients experienced marked symptomatic improvement. The results indicate that balloon valvuloplasty can be offered to very elderly patients with severe aortic stenosis and can produce improvement in hemodynamic and clinical status.\r"

The mean diameter of the interatrial septal defect detected by transesophageal two-dimensional echocardiography was 1.8 +/- 1.0 mm. The mean velocity of left-to-right shunting flow measured by high-pulse repetition frequency Doppler technique was 0.83 +/- 0.38 m/sec. One week after the procedure, left-to-right shunt flow was detected in 11 (73%) patients. One month after valvuloplasty, left-to-right shunting flow was detected in seven (47%) of 15 patients. There was a significant decrease in the diameter of an interatrial septal defect between 1 day and 1 week (p less than 0.01), between 1 week and 1 month (p less than 0.01), and between 1 month and 6 months (p less than 0.05). Six months after valvuloplasty, left-to-right shunting flow remained in three (20%) patients. By using transthoracic color Doppler echocardiography, we detected left-to-right shunting flow in two patients on 1 day after the procedure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Sixteen patients with drug-refractory supraventricular tachycardia underwent catheter ablation of the atrioventricular junction using radiofrequency energy. A standard 7F quadripolar electrode catheter was positioned to record the largest unipolar His potential (580 +/- 640 microV) from the distal electrode. An electrocoagulator (Microvasive Bicap 4005) supplied continuous, unmodulated energy at 550 kHz. One to 14 applications of radiofrequency current were delivered between the distal electrode and a large-diameter chest wall electrode. Transient, mild chest discomfort was reported by seven of 16 patients. None had significant arrhythmias or blood pressure changes during radiofrequency ablation. Complete atrioventricular block was produced in nine of 16 patients and high-grade second-degree atrioventricular block was produced in one patient with radiofrequency current. Attenuated His bundle electrograms could still be recorded in the remaining six patients, four of whom underwent successful atrioventricular junctional ablation using direct-current shock during the same session. Atrioventricular block persisted in all 10 patients successfully treated with radiofrequency ablation during a mean follow-up of 4.2 months. Compared with a group of historic control subjects treated with direct-current shock ablation, the 10 patients successfully treated with radiofrequency current had significantly less creatine kinase-MB isoenzyme release (5.7 +/- 5.1 vs. 22 +/- 13 IU, p = 0.006). A junctional escape rhythm was present in all patients after radiofrequency-induced atrioventricular block. In contrast, three of 10 control patients had an idioventricular escape after direct current shock ablation, and four patients had no escape rhythm at all.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Exogenous adenosine has been shown to have potent electrophysiologic effects and antiarrhythmic properties within the atrioventricular (AV) node. Endogenous adenosine, a nucleoside with an increased release signaled by ischemia and hypoxia, is not believed to exert significant effects during homeostatic conditions. Recent experimental evidence suggests, however, that under normoxic conditions, the amount of adenosine released may be sufficient to mediate some of its physiologic effects. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that in humans the electrophysiologic effects of endogenously released adenosine on AV nodal conduction can be demonstrated under normoxic conditions by inhibiting uptake and degradation of the nucleoside. In the first protocol, the effects of intravenous dipyridamole (0.56 mg/kg bolus i.v., 5 micrograms/kg/minute infusion), a nucleoside-transport blocker that elevates endogenous plasma levels of adenosine, on AV nodal conduction were evaluated in seven patients. At a constant atrial paced cycle length, dipyridamole increased the AH interval from 110 +/- 19 to 164 +/- 26 msec, p = 0.002 (+/- SEM). Aminophylline (5.6 mg/kg i.v.), a competitive antagonist of adenosine, completely reversed the effects of dipyridamole on AV nodal conduction. Similarly, dipyridamole increased the cycle length at which pacing-induced AV nodal Wenckebach occurred, from 348 +/- 31 (control) to 388 +/- 33 msec (dipyridamole) (p = 0.002). In a second protocol, the effects of intravenous dipyridamole were evaluated in another group of six patients who had supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) in which the AV node was part of the reentrant circuit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients who had revascularization procedures within 1 year of PTCA were not included in the analysis. Mean time to recurrent ischemia was 30.8 +/- 17.4 months (range 12-89 months). At follow-up, 47 patients had angina, 13 had atypical chest pain, two had acute myocardial infarction, and four had positive exercise tests without symptoms. No patient showed spontaneous regression in the extent of coronary artery disease (CAD). As compared with the extent of CAD immediately after PTCA, the extent of CAD at follow-up did not change in 26 patients (39%); it increased by one vessel in 30 (45%), by two vessels in seven (11%), and by three vessels in three (5%). The pattern of CAD seen at follow-up compared with that seen after PTCA was as follows: 18 patients (27%), no change; seven (11%), restenosis only; 30 (45%), progression of CAD at other sites only; and 11 (17%), a combination of restenosis and progression of CAD at other sites. The time to recurrence of ischemia was significantly different between those with restenosis only versus those with progression only (20.1 +/- 9.2 vs. 38.3 +/- 18.5 months) (p less than 0.009). Progression of CAD was equally distributed between dilated and nondilated vessels; however, when progression occurred in the PTCA vessel, it was significantly more likely to be distal to the PTCA site (p less than 0.008).\r"

After excluding those with interim interventions (64), medical events (36), or medical contraindications to follow-up testing (25), both a treadmill test and a cardiac catheterization were completed in 144 patients, 88% of those eligible for this assessment. Four patients with left bundle branch block or pacemaker rhythm at the time of treadmill testing were also excluded from analysis. Of six follow-up clinical and treadmill variables examined by multivariable logistic regression analysis, only exercise ST deviation was independently correlated with restenosis at follow-up (chi 2 = 5, p = 0.02). The clinical diagnosis of angina at follow-up, although marginally related to restenosis when considered by itself (p = 0.04), did not add significant information once ST deviation was known. The sensitivity of ST deviation of 0.10 mV or greater for detecting restenosis was only 24% (13 of 55 patients), and the specificity was 88% (75 of 85 patients). The sensitivity of exercise-induced ST deviation for detection of restenosis was not affected by extent or severity of wall motion abnormalities at follow-up, by the timing of thrombolytic therapy or of angioplasty, or by the presence of collateral blood flow at the time of acute angiography. A second multivariable analysis evaluating the association of the same variables with number of vessels with significant coronary disease at the 6-month catheterization found an association with both exercise ST deviation (p = 0.003) and exercise duration (p = 0.04). Angina symptoms and exercise treadmill test results in this population had limited value for predicting anatomic restenosis 6 months after emergency angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction.\r"

Therefore, we performed a blinded prospective study to assess the value of cine MRI determination of CABG patency in 20 patients with 45 CABG proximal anastomoses who were undergoing repeat angiography. Ten normal subjects served as controls to define normal intrathoracic vascular patterns. There were 21 left anterior descending (LAD) grafts, of which four were left internal mammary (LIMA), 12 left circumflex (Cx), and 12 right coronary (RCA) grafts. After localizing spin-echo coronal images were obtained, multiple axial multislice interleaved cine MRI acquisitions, each consisting of two to four 5-10-mm-thick slices at eight to 24 frames per cardiac cycle, were obtained from the superior main pulmonary artery to the inferior left ventricle. Each acquisition took 5-8 minutes with a subsequent 5-10 minutes of computer image reconstruction. Total study time per patient was 50-75 minutes. Known to cine MRI interpreters were the original surgical CABG insertions but not the angiographic findings. A graft was called patent if a bright graft flow signal, not corresponding to a normal vessel, was identified on multiple frames at multiple levels abutting the great vessels or epicardial surface of the heart. Angiographically, there were 33 patent grafts, of which 29 were identified as patent by cine MRI (sensitivity, 88%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether compensatory enlargement of atherosclerotic coronary arteries occurs and to what degree it affects the angiographic assessment of coronary artery disease, we performed postmortem coronary angiography of 30 human hearts with suspected coronary artery disease and studied 70 histologic cross sections of the proximal left anterior descending artery and proximal right coronary artery. Angiographic and morphometric analyses of 50 stenoses in proximal and middle sections of the left anterior descending artery, right coronary artery, and left circumflex artery were performed. The control group of 10 human hearts without suspected coronary artery disease was evaluated in the same way. For this purpose, coronary arteries were filled with a methylmethacrylic radiopaque resin at a pressure of 100 mm Hg and closely embedded in a methylmethacrylic resin by use of which shrinkage and mechanical artifacts could be avoided. The area circumscribed by the internal elastic lamina was taken as a measure of the area of the arterial lumen if no plaque had been present. The angiographic and corresponding morphometric degree of stenosis was assessed. A significant correlation (r = 0.85, p less than or equal to 0.0001) was found between the internal elastic lamina area and the area of the plaque (lesion area), suggesting that coronary arteries may enlarge as lesion area increases. With the morphometric degree of stenosis, the expected anatomic diminution of the coronary artery was abolished (r = 0.79, p less than or equal to 0.0001), indicating compensatory enlargement in atherosclerotic segments. Accordingly, the degree of stenosis assessed from in vitro angiograms was underestimated. Compensatory coronary enlargement of the stenotic segment was the main reason for angiographic underestimation. The underestimation factor of up to 3.50 for very mild stenoses decreased to 1.37 at an angiographic degree of 50% area stenosis and 30% diameter stenosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A group of 40 patients with syndrome X was followed for several years to determine their long-term prognosis. In 27 patients pulmonary artery pressure and in 19 patients left ventricular ejection fraction were reassessed during rest and exercise approximately 4 years after the initial examination. In patients with stress-induced ST-segment depression, these variables did not change during the observation period. In patients with constant or rate-dependent left bundle branch block, however, there was significant deterioration of left ventricular performance during rest (pulmonary artery mean pressure, 16 +/- 3 vs. 17 +/- 4 mm Hg, p = NS; left ventricular ejection fraction, 62 +/- 5% vs. 55 +/- 5%, p less than 0.05) and exercise (pulmonary artery, 30 +/- 6 vs. 39 +/- 10 mm Hg, p less than 0.005; left ventricular ejection fraction, 59 +/- 6% vs. 49 +/- 5%, p less than 0.01). These findings suggest that in syndrome X two subgroups with distinctly different prognoses may be defined: In patients with stress-induced ST-segment depression during exercise, left ventricular performance remains well preserved; however, in patients with either constant or rate-dependent left bundle branch block, there is significant deterioration of left ventricular function within several years.\r"

The mean plasma FPA levels (ng/ml) at 2:00 PM, 6:00 PM, 10:00 PM, 2:00 AM, 6:00 AM, and 10:00 AM were 4.6 +/- 1.0, 3.1 +/- 0.5, 6.1 +/- 1.6, 9.9 +/- 2.4, 8.7 +/- 1.4, and 4.2 +/- 0.8 in patients with variant angina (p less than 0.01) and 1.8 +/- 0.2, 2.3 +/- 0.3, 1.9 +/- 0.3, and 2.3 +/- 0.2 in those with stable exertional angina. In seven patients with variant angina, we also examined the effects of heparin (3,000 units), given subcutaneously at 6:00 PM, 10:00 PM, and 2:00 AM, on the plasma FPA levels and the anginal attacks. Although heparin suppressed the elevation and circadian variation of plasma FPA levels, it did not suppress the attacks and their circadian variation in these patients. Plasma FPA levels increased significantly from 3.7 +/- 0.5 to 12.5 +/- 2.7 ng/ml during or immediately after an attack in the seven patients with no heparin. On the other hand, the plasma levels of BTG and PF4 were increased in patients with variant angina as compared with those with stable exertional angina but did not show a significant circadian variation in both groups. We conclude that 1) plasma levels of FPA, BTG, and PF4 were increased in patients with variant angina as compared with those with stable exertional angina; 2) there was a significant circadian variation in the plasma levels of FPA in parallel with that of the frequency of the attacks with the peak level occurring from midnight to early morning in patients with variant angina; and 3) elevated levels of plasma FPA are the result and not the cause of coronary spasm.\r"

We tested the hypothesis that exercise capacity 1 month after myocardial infarction provides additional information in patients with a low LVEF and therefore assists in risk stratification. One hundred fifteen patients, with documented myocardial infarction and LVEF less than 35% by gated radionuclide scan 1 month after acute myocardial infarction, were followed up for 2 months to 7 years. Exercise capacity was estimated from a treadmill test 1 month after infarction. Using the Cox proportional hazards model, exercise capacity was a significant predictor of death or reinfarction. The relative risk of death, based on a comparison between the lowermost quintile (less than 4 METS) and uppermost quintile (greater than 7 METS), was 3.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-9.7); the relative risk in the fourth, third, and second quintile was 2.7, 2.1, and 1.6, respectively. In a multivariate analysis, the observed effect of a good exercise capacity was independent of LVEF. These data indicate that in patients with a low LVEF after myocardial infarction, useful prognostic information can be obtained from exercise testing.\r"

Of the 31 patients with CAD, 20 developed evidence of myocardial ischemia during exercise (group 2), typical angina occurring in 20 of 20 and ischemic ST segment changes in 13 of 20, whereas 11 patients developed no evidence of ischemia (no chest pain or electrocardiographic changes) (group 3). Exercise resulted in increased total and cardiac NE spillover in all groups of patients. Basal cardiac NE spillover was similar in the three groups (group 1, 5 +/- 1 ng/min; group 2, 8 +/- 1 ng/min; group 3, 7 +/- 2 ng/min; p = NS), but during exercise, cardiac NE spillover was greater in patients who developed angina (group 2, 30 +/- 5 ng/min) than in those who did not (group 1, 17 +/- 2 ng/min; group 3, 17 +/- 2 ng/min; p less than 0.05). The increases in total NE spillover were similar in the three groups. Supine bicycle exercise increases cardiac and overall sympathetic tone in normal control subjects and in patients with CAD. The occurrence of angina selectively enhances the cardiac sympathetic response to exercise. In the absence of angina, patients with CAD and control subjects without CAD have similar sympathetic responses to exercise.\r"

Waves were ensemble-averaged into age-decade groups. Characteristic changes were noted with increasing age. In all sites, pulse amplitude increased with advancing age (carotid, 91.3%; radial 67.5%; femoral, 50.1% from first to eighth decade), diastolic decay steepened, and diastolic waves became less prominent. In the carotid pulse, there was, in youth, a second peak on the downstroke of the waves in late systole. After the third decade, this second peak rose with age to merge with and dominate the initial rise. In the radial pulse, a late systolic wave was also apparent, but this occurred later; with age, this second peak rose but not above the initial rise in early systole, even at the eighth decade. In the femoral artery, there was a single systolic wave at all ages. Aging changes in the arterial pulse are explicable on the basis of both an increase in arterial stiffness with increased pulse-wave velocity and progressively earlier wave reflection. These two factors may be separated and effects of the latter measured from pressure wave-contour analysis using an \"augmentation index,\" determined by a computer algorithm developed from invasive pressure and flow data. Changes in peak pressure in the central (carotid) artery show increasing cardiac afterload with increasing age in a normal population; this can account for the cardiac hypertrophy that occurs with advancing age (even as other organs atrophy) and the predisposition to cardiac failure in the elderly. Identification of mechanisms responsible offers a new approach to reduction of left ventricular afterload.\r"

Because adrenoceptors may down-regulate in response to chronic stimulation, we investigated the activity of alpha 2-receptor-mediated vasoconstriction in patients with congestive heart failure, who had increased levels of plasma norepinephrine. We used the isolated forearm model and intra-arterial infusions of subsystemic doses of yohimbine, a specific alpha 2-blocker, in 11 patients with heart failure and in 15 normal subjects. Yohimbine produced a dose-related increase in forearm blood flow and decrease in forearm vascular resistance. These findings were consistent with a direct vasodilator effect mediated by blockade of the postsynaptic alpha 2-vascular receptor. Furthermore, the vasodilator responses in patients with heart failure were similar to the normal subjects in terms of the percent increase in forearm blood flow, the dose-response relation, and the fractional response to hyperemia and phentolamine; thus, alpha 2-receptor-mediated vasoconstriction is neither enhanced nor down-regulated in heart failure. In addition, in patients with heart failure and in normal subjects, yohimbine produced an increase in the forearm venous norepinephrine concentration, consistent with an inhibition of the presynaptic alpha 2-receptor resulting in an augmented release of norepinephrine into the synaptic cleft. Thus, these data suggest that the postsynaptic alpha 2-receptor is an important mediator of vasoconstriction in patients with heart failure. Despite chronic elevations in plasma norepinephrine in patients with heart failure, alpha 2-receptor mechanisms subserving vasoconstriction and inhibition of norepinephrine release into the synaptic cleft are still functional in heart failure.\r"

The difference between light absorption at 760 and 800 nm was used to assess hemoglobin-myoglobin oxygenation. Initial studies conducted in isolated canine gracilis muscle demonstrated that 760-800-nm absorption correlated closely (r = -0.97 +/- 0.01) with venous hemoglobin O2 saturation when the muscle was stimulated to contract at 0.25-5.0 Hz. In normal subjects (n = 6) and patients with heart failure (n = 8), 760-800-nm absorption changes from the vastus lateralis muscle were monitored at rest, during progressive maximal bicycle exercise, and during thigh cuff inflation to suprasystolic pressure, an intervention designed to assess minimal hemoglobin-myoglobin oxygenation. Absorption changes were expressed relative to the full physiologic range noted from rest to thigh cuff inflation. During exercise, normal subjects exhibited an initial increase in hemoglobin-myoglobin oxygenation followed by a progressive decrease in oxygenation to 27 +/- 13% of the physiologic range at the peak exercise workload of 140 +/- 9 W. In contrast, patients exhibited an initial decrease in hemoglobin-myoglobin oxygenation with the first workload, followed by a progressive further decrease to 26 +/- 13% of the physiologic range at a peak exercise workload of 60 +/- 8 W, less than half the peak workload noted in the normal subjects. At all exercise loads, hemoglobin-myoglobin oxygenation was significantly less in the patients than in the normal subjects. These data suggest that near-infrared spectroscopy can detect impaired skeletal muscle O2 delivery in patients with heart failure. This technique could provide a valuable method of assessing muscle O2 delivery in patients, particularly before and after therapeutic interventions.\r"

Twenty-one cardiac arrests occurred in 20 of 216 (9%) such patients during a 4-year period. Heart failure was due to coronary artery disease with prior myocardial infarction in 13 patients and nonischemic cardiomyopathy in seven patients. The rhythm at the time of arrest was severe bradycardia or electromechanical dissociation (BA/EMD) in 13 (62%) patients. The precipitating cause of the BA/EMD arrest was coronary artery thrombosis or embolism in two patients, pulmonary embolism in one patient, hyperkalemia in two patients, and unexplained hypoglycemia in one patient. In seven of 13 (54%) patients, a precipitating cause of the bradycardia arrest could not be established. Only eight of 21 (38%) arrests were due to ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation (VT/VF), and all occurred in patients with prior myocardial infarction (p = 0.02 vs. BA/EMD arrests). Two VT/VF arrests were due to acute or recent infarction, and one patient had hyperkalemia. The patients who suffered a BA/EMD arrest were similar to those who had a VT/VF arrest in age, ventricular arrhythmia history, ventricular function, and serum potassium levels. Serum sodium levels were lower in patients with BA/EMD arrests (129 +/- 3 vs. 133 +/- 4 meq/l, p = 0.025).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Between January 1983 and December 1987, 62 patients underwent an arterial switch operation for transposition of the great arteries with ventricular septal defect or double outlet right or left ventricle. There were three hospital deaths (4.8%), and no deaths occurred in neonates (less than 1 month of age, n = 18). There were three late deaths, one due to coronary obstruction and two due to pulmonary vascular obstructive disease. One child has been lost to follow-up. We have prospectively evaluated the remaining 55 survivors by clinical evaluation, echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, and limited electrophysiologic studies. The mean length of follow-up has been 27 +/- 16 months since surgery. One child has required reoperation for a residual ventricular septal defect; no child has undergone reoperation for supravalvar pulmonary or aortic stenosis. Aortic regurgitation was identified in 12 children (22%), which was mild in 11 and moderate in one. One child has asymptomatic occlusion of the left main coronary artery, one child has a tiny right coronary artery-to-pulmonary artery fistula, and one child has abnormal left ventricular wall motion according to follow-up angiography. No other abnormalities of systemic (left) ventricular function have been identified at late follow-up. In addition to the two late deaths due to pulmonary vascular obstructive disease, three children, all of whom were repaired at more than 6 months of age, have elevated pulmonary vascular resistance. Notable postoperative arrhythmias include complete heart block in four patients and nonsustained supraventricular or ventricular tachycardia early after surgery in eight patients (all resolved without medication at later follow-up). Only two patients have evidence of sinus node dysfunction and have not required treatment. The low hospital mortality and encouraging early follow-up data represent a significant improvement over atrial level repairs, supporting the arterial switch operation as the procedure of choice for children who have transposition of the great arteries with ventricular septal defect or double outlet ventricle. Because of the potential for the development of early pulmonary vascular obstructive disease in these patients, repair is recommended within the first 2 months of life.\r"

The prevalence of residual ductal shunting and the main pulmonary arterial flow patterns were recorded. Residual ductal shunting in group 1 was 38% on day 1, decreasing slowly to 31% at 3 months, 27% at 6 months, and 19.7% at 1 year or more due to further spontaneous shunt resolution. The residual shunting rate in group 2 (6%) was significantly lower than that at 1 year or more in group 1 (p less than 0.001). Successful reocclusion in 5 of 6 in a subset of patients in group 1 followed for 1 year or less reduced further the prevalence of residual shunting. Residual shunting after patent ductus arteriosus occlusion is more common than after ligation, but continues to decrease during follow-up.\r"

All flow velocity waveforms were obtained with a mechanical sector scanner combined with a pulsed and continuous Doppler system with a carrier frequency of 3.5 and 3.0 MHz. Normal pregnancy was characterized by low fetal and placental vascular resistances. The peak systolic velocity in the ascending aorta was significantly higher compared with the pulmonary artery. In patients with intrauterine growth retardation, reduced end-diastolic flow velocities were documented in fetal descending aorta, umbilical artery, and maternal uteroplacental artery, reflecting raised umbilical placental and uteroplacental vascular resistances. Raised end-diastolic flow velocities were observed at the cerebral level, reflecting reduced cerebral vascular resistance (\"brain sparing\" effect). Reduced peak systolic flow velocities documented at the cardiac level may be secondary to reduced volume flow, increased valve or vessel size, or raised afterload. The noninvasive nature of this study did not allow differentiation between these variables.\r"

The coronary epicardial arteries were sectioned at 5-mm intervals, and a Movat-stained section of each segment of artery was prepared and analyzed using a computerized morphometry system. Within the AMI group and within the SCD group, there were no differences in plaque composition among any of the four major epicardial coronary arteries. Within both groups, plaque morphology varied as a function of cross-sectional-area narrowing of the segments. In both groups, the amount of dense relatively acellular fibrous tissue, calcified tissue, and pultaceous debris (amorphous debris containing cholesterol clefts, presumably rich in extracellular lipid) increased in a linear fashion with increasing degrees of cross-sectional-area narrowing of the segments, and the amount of cellular fibrous tissue decreased linearly. In the AMI group, the percentage of plaque consisting of pultaceous debris and of cellular fibrous tissue separated significantly narrowed (greater than 75% cross-sectional area) segments from less narrowed (less than 75%) segments. A comparison of the AMI group to the SCD group showed significant differences. The percentage of plaque consisting of pultaceous debris (16% in the AMI group and 7% in the SCD group), of cellular fibrous tissue (11% vs. 18%), and of heavily calcified tissue (8% vs. 16%) were significantly different in the severely narrowed segments in the AMI and SCD groups. When all arteries containing thrombi were deleted from the analysis, there were no significant changes in the results. Occlusive coronary thrombi were present in 13 of the 15 AMI patients and in one of the 12 SCD patients. Thus, the frequency of coronary thrombi and plaque composition differ in patients with AMI and in those with SCD without AMI.\r"

However, it is not clear whether prolongation of tau represents abnormal myocardial physiology or the effect of excessive load associated with a particular disease process. Accordingly, we evaluate the effect on tau of an isolated decrease in preload induced by inferior vena cava occlusion before the appearance of reflex changes in six patients designated as normal by catheterization criteria. A computer-based digitization routine identified cardiac contractions in all patients early after inferior vena cava occlusion where left ventricular end-diastolic pressure decreased (18.3 +/- 6.3 to 9.3 +/- 5.8, p less than 0.05) while left ventricular systolic pressure (113.3 +/- 13.8 to 111.8 +/- 14.0, p = NS) and heart rate (66.0 +/- 10.0 to 65.9 +/- 10.3, p = NS) did not change. After this alteration in preload, no change in tau from baseline, as calculated by the logarithmic (TL), derivative (TD), or method of Mirsky (T1/2), was noted: TL, 47.4 +/- 6.5 to 44.6 +/- 7.6; TD, 39.3 +/- 8.1 to 39.8 +/- 8.4; T1/2, 33.0 +/- 4.0 to 31.8 +/- 4.6; all p = NS. The baseline pressure extrapolated from isovolumetric relaxation did not change in these preload beats compared with baseline (+4.26 +/- 6.20 to -0.80 +/- 4.87, p = NS). Subsequent beats were identified where left ventricular systolic pressure showed a numeric decrease compared with baseline (113.3 +/- 13.8 to 100.8 +/- 14.3, p = NS) despite no change in heart rate (66.0 +/- 10.0 to 66.8 +/- 10.5, p = NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Both antibodies abolished thrombus formation with a mean dose of -0.2 mg/kg. Ex vivo platelet aggregation was not always abolished at doses that abolished thrombus formation; similarly, bleeding times were only moderately prolonged (9.1 +/- 1.4 minutes) at these doses. Increasing the dose above that required to abolish thrombus formation consistently produced abolition of ex vivo platelet aggregation, marked prolongation of the bleeding time (14.2 +/- 1.5 minutes), and nearly quantitative blockade of GPIIb/IIIa receptors. We conclude that in a significant percentage of animals, the extent of GPIIb/IIIa blockade required to prevent vasoocclusive thrombus formation in this model is less than that required for abolition of platelet aggregation, and that the preservation of only a minority of functional GPIIb/IIIa receptors might be adequate to maintain a nearly normal bleeding time.\r"

Circumflex or left anterior descending arteries were randomly occluded (at proximal or distal sites) for 3 minutes in reflex-blocked (n = 6, hexamethonium/vagotomy) and unblocked (n = 7) animals. Pressure-volume data were obtained by the conductance-catheter technique, with ESPVRs determined by transient inferior vena caval occlusion. Ischemic zone size was estimated for each occlusion by radiolabeled microspheres. The relative influence of each variable on ESPVR change with ischemia was determined by multiple regression analysis. As in previous studies, regional ischemia displaced ESPVRs to the right by an amount that varied directly with ischemic bed size (y = +0.48x, r = 0.76, p less than 0.001). However, in contrast to previous data, coronary occlusion also reduced the ESPVR slope (end-systolic elastance, Ees) in the majority of cases. The extent of slope change was primarily dependent on the baseline elastance (Eesbase), such that the higher the initial elastance, the larger its subsequent reduction for any amount of ischemia (delta Ees = -0.78Eesbase, r = 0.94, p less than 0.001). Active reflexes added an offset constant to this relation (+3.15 mm Hg/ml, p less than 0.001). In addition, Ees fell slightly more with larger ischemic regions. Thus, although previous studies have reported primarily rightward parallel shifts in ESPVR with regional ischemia, the present data also demonstrate that the slope of the relation is often reduced. Greater baseline elastances typical of in situ, as opposed to isolated, ventricles probably explain the differences in apparent responses.\r"

  ".W": "The relation between the extent of myocardial injury sustained during reperfusion and total glutathione (GSH) content in the ischemic myocardium was examined in anesthetized open-chest pigs subjected to coronary occlusion for 45 minutes and reperfusion for 2 hours. In pigs infused with saline during reperfusion (n = 6) there was a decrease in myocardial GSH content from 380 +/- 48 micrograms/g in normally perfused myocardium to 182 +/- 36 micrograms/g in the ischemic reperfused myocardium (p less than 0.02). Myocardial infarct size (expressed as a percentage of the ischemic area) was 12.5 +/- 0.8%. There was a delay of recovery of contractile function before returning to 60% of preocclusion value. In pigs pretreated with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) (n = 5), an inhibitor of cellular GSH synthesis, there was reduction in GSH content to 215 +/- 25 micrograms/gm in normally perfused myocardium and to 77 +/- 8 micrograms/gm in the ischemic reperfused myocardium. The extent of injury was greater as evidenced by an increase in infarct size to 30.4 +/- 4.0% (p less than 0.001), severe destructive changes in subepicardial ultrastructure, which were absent in saline-infused pigs, and persistence of dyskinesia throughout reperfusion. In pigs infused with glutathione intravenously (0.8 gm/kg) at a rate of 6.5 mg/kg/min (n = 6), 5 minutes before and continuously during reperfusion, there was an increase in GSH content to 582 +/- 67 micrograms/g in normally perfused myocardium and to 312 +/- 80 micrograms/g in ischemic reperfused myocardium. The increase in myocardial GSH was associated with a reduction in infarct size to 7.5 +/- 1.3% (p less than 0.05, compared with saline-infused pigs) and an early recovery of contractile function of the ischemic myocardium. GSH infusion into pigs pretreated with BSO (n = 4) failed to increase myocardial GSH content and failed to reduce the extent of myocardial injury. Thus, the extent of myocardial injury sustained during reperfusion is very dependent on the effectiveness of its antioxidant defenses. Markedly increased susceptibility to injury occurs when the GSH content in the ischemic myocardium becomes depleted.\r"

  ".U": "90090945\r", 
  ".W": "In many experimental models of ischemia and reperfusion, reperfusion is performed abruptly, allowing full reactive hyperemia to occur. In the clinical setting, however, reperfusion after thrombolysis is often limited by residual stenosis. Some experimental models attempt to mimic this situation with a \"critical stenosis\" (defined as a coronary constriction sufficient to abolish reactive hyperemia without altering baseline flow). The purpose of this study was to determine whether preventing reactive hyperemia during the initial phase of reperfusion would modify the transmural distribution of myocardial blood flow or the myocardial accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). The left circumflex artery was occluded for 90 minutes and then reperfused for 60 minutes in anesthetized, open-chest dogs. Autologous PMNs were isolated, labeled with 111In, and reinjected 1 hour before coronary occlusion. 125I-labeled albumin was injected simultaneously to correct for 111In associated with plasma proteins and to permit calculation of the number of PMNs in the inner, middle, and outer thirds of nonischemic and ischemic-reperfused tissue. The presence of a critical stenosis abolished reactive hyperemia during the first 5 minutes of reperfusion, but did not substantially affect blood flow measured after 55 minutes of reperfusion. In both groups, there was a significant accumulation of PMNs in all layers of the ischemic-reperfused bed compared with the nonischemic bed, and the magnitude of this PMN accumulation was not altered by the presence of a critical stenosis. Moreover, infarct size, estimated by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) loss after 60 minutes of reperfusion, was not affected by the presence of a critical stenosis. Thus, the presence of a critical stenosis abolished the hyperemic blood flow after reperfusion but did not influence the early PMN response to ischemia and reperfusion or the early loss of TTC staining.\r"

The size of the ischemic risk region was the same in the control (41.6 +/- 1.0%) and neutropenic (41.8 +/- 2.1%) groups. Collateral blood flow to the risk region was the same in control (0.15 +/- 0.03 ml/min/g) and neutropenic (0.13 +/- 0.03 ml/min/g) groups. Among dogs with collateral flow less than 0.2 ml/min/g, infarct size was reduced in the neutropenic group (27.7 +/- 6.7% of risk region, n = 8), compared with control dogs (52.5 +/- 5.7%; n = 7; p = 0.02). Multiple linear regression described the relation between infarct size, risk region size, and collateral flow in the control group, and the same regression relation was used to predict infarct size for the neutropenic group. Mean predicted infarct size in the neutropenic group (n = 11) was 16.8 +/- 3.4% of left ventricle, whereas mean observed infarct size was 9.6 +/- 3.1% (p less than 0.01). The extent of the no-reflow zone (absence of thioflavin-S-fluorescence) was also less in the neutropenic than the control group (2.2 +/- 0.8% vs. 8.1 +/- 2.7% of the risk region, p less than 0.05). Neutropenia limited to the reperfusion period is associated with significant reductions in the extent of the infarct and no-reflow zones after 90 minutes of ischemia. These findings support the hypothesis that reperfusion necrosis occurs after prolonged myocardial ischemia and indicate that neutrophil leukocytes are important mediators of such reperfusion injury.\r"

Activated neutrophils release mediators such as metabolites of oxygen that can compromise myocellular integrity and provoke cardiac dysfunction. Although it is established that leukopenia reduces infarct size, the role of leukocytes and the source of free radicals in postischemic contractile dysfunction is unresolved. A carotid left anterior descending coronary-artery extracorporeal circuit without (n = 8) or with a Leukopak filter (n = 6) to deplete the leukocytes and platelets from blood entering the left anterior descending artery was established in the anesthetized, open-chest dog 30 minutes before ischemia. Subendocardial segmental function was monitored by sonomicrometry, and ischemia was produced by stopping flow for 15 minutes followed by 3 hours of reperfusion. Depleting leukocytes by 90 +/- 3.2% and platelets by 100% improved segmental function (from 30.5 +/- 7% to 74.1 +/- 12.7% for control versus leukocyte-depleted dogs, respectively) at 15 minutes of reperfusion. In the leukopenic group, however, there was a progressive decline in contractility to 32.5 +/- 13.8% by 3 hours of reperfusion that was associated with a return of leukocytes and, to a lesser extent, a return of platelets in the extracorporeal blood to 70.2 +/- 21.9% and 15.5 +/- 4.3% of systemic values, respectively. Removal of leukocytes and platelets from blood perfusing the coronary vascular bed only at reperfusion improved contractile function to 67.7 +/- 6.9% at 15 minutes and 54.7 +/- 12.1% at 3 hours (n = 6).

The aim of this study was to assess postischemic recovery of myocardial performance and energy metabolites in rat hearts with left ventricular hypertrophy pretreated either chronically or acutely with verapamil. Left ventricular hypertrophy was induced by suprarenal constriction of the abdominal aorta. Hemodynamics and phosphorus 31 magnetic resonance spectra were monitored simultaneously in the isolated hearts during control perfusion, after 30 minutes of global ischemia, and after 30 minutes of reperfusion. All hypertrophied hearts had significantly higher rate-pressure products than normal hearts. Compared with normal hearts, oxygen consumption was significantly lower in all hypertrophied hearts, especially untreated hypertrophied hearts. Also, before ischemia all normal or hypertrophied hearts (treated or untreated) began with comparable phosphorylation potentials (i.e., the supply of energy was not significantly different). Postischemic recovery was not related to energy supply-oxygen demand before onset of ischemia. Furthermore, it was not related to energy levels or intracellular pH during ischemia. For postischemic recovery, the rate-pressure product was 40 +/- 5% in the hypertrophied heart, 83 +/- 5% in the normal, 100 +/- 3% in the hypertrophied heart chronically treated with verapamil, and 82 +/- 5% in the hypertrophied heart acutely treated with verapamil. The degree of recovery was related to coronary flow both before and after ischemia. The latter is important for flushing deleterious metabolites and ions from the interstitial space as well as for delivery of oxygen and substrate to the myocardium.\r"

  ".W": "The \"no-reflow\" phenomenon, the occurrence of areas with very low flow in hearts reperfused after ischemia, is thought to be largely established at the time of reperfusion as a result of microvascular damage induced by ischemia. In the present study we sought to determine whether additional impairment of tissue perfusion might also occur during the course of reperfusion. Open-chest dogs were subjected to 90 minutes of left circumflex coronary artery occlusion and reperfused for 2 minutes (n = 7) or 3.5 hours (n = 8). Myocardial perfusion was visualized in left ventricular slices following in vivo injection of the fluorescent dye thioflavin-S just before killing. The area of impaired perfusion (absent thioflavin) averaged 9.5 +/- 3.0% of the risk region in dogs reperfused for 2 minutes, whereas it was nearly three times as large in dogs reperfused for 3.5 hours (25.9 +/- 8.2% of the risk region, p less than 0.05). Serial measurements of flow by microspheres during reperfusion demonstrated zones within the postischemic myocardium that were hyperemic 2 minutes after reperfusion, with adequate flow still present at 30 minutes, but with a subsequent marked fall in perfusion. After 3.5 hours these areas showed negligible flow (0.13 +/- 0.3 ml/min/g) and no thioflavin uptake. Tissue samples showing postischemic impairment in perfusion has received virtually no collateral flow during ischemia (less than 0.01 ml/min/g), whereas collateral flow was significantly higher in adjacent thioflavin-positive zones (0.04 +/- 0.01 ml/min/g in endocardial samples and 0.07 +/- 0.02 ml/min/g in samples from the midmyocardium, p less than 0.001 vs. thioflavin-negative areas). Areas that showed late impairment of flow invariably demonstrated contraction band necrosis, which contrasted with the pattern of coagulation necrosis observed in areas of \"true\" (i.e., immediate) no-reflow. Intracapillary erythrocyte stasis and marked intravascular neutrophil accumulation (to levels greater than 20-fold that found after 2 minutes reperfusion) were typically observed in areas of delayed impairment to flow. Obstruction to flow at the capillary level was confirmed in additional dogs in which the heart was injected postmortem with silicone rubber to delineate the microvascular filling pattern. Areas of absent capillary filling were much more extensive after 3.5 hours than after 2 minutes reperfusion. Thus, this study shows that the occurrence of areas of markedly impaired perfusion in postischemic myocardium is related only in part to an inability to reperfuse certain areas on reflow. A more important factor is represented by a delayed, progressive fall in flow to areas that initially received adequate reperfusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The mechanisms underlying this effect are unclear. It is not known whether this effect is a manifestation of verapamil-induced reduction in baseline cardiac work before the reduction in coronary flow, is dependent on a selective depression of contractility within the low-flow region, or is independent of an effect on myocardial work. This study was performed to determine the relations between changes in regional contractility and [K+]e before and after verapamil (0.2 mg/kg followed by 6.5 micrograms/kg/min) when left anterior descending (LAD) coronary flow is progressively reduced and when verapamil-induced alterations in baseline myocardial work are prevented by atrial pacing and by dobutamine (4.3 +/- 2.2 micrograms/kg/min) to maintain systemic arterial blood pressure and contractility. Before verapamil-dobutamine, myocardial [K+]e rose and regional contractility fell when LAD coronary flow was reduced to 87.7 +/- 9.6% and 83.4 +/- 7.4%, respectively, of the unrestricted control value (p = NS). After verapamil-dobutamine, the threshold flow for rise in [K+]e decreased to 56.4 +/- 13.5% of the unrestricted control flow (p = 0.003), but the threshold flow for regional contractility fall was unchanged (84.8 +/- 11.3%). Our results indicate that the protective effect of verapamil on preventing ischemia-induced [K+]e release is not dependent on a reduction in baseline myocardial work. In this setting, calcium channel blockade by verapamil results in a dissociation between the ionic and mechanical events that occur when coronary flow is reduced.\r"

Experiments in dogs have demonstrated that these responses are due to stimulation of afferent vagal fibers that are located mainly in the inferior wall of the heart. Prostaglandins are released during myocardial ischemia and possibly during reperfusion. Prostaglandins stimulate chemosensitive but not mechanosensitive endings in the ventricles. Our studies determined whether blockade of prostaglandin synthesis with indomethacin or sodium meclofenamate decreased the reflex inhibitory responses to coronary occlusion and reperfusion. Experiments were done in alpha-chloralose-anesthetized dogs after sinoaortic baroreceptor denervation. Occlusion of the circumflex coronary artery for 5 minutes resulted in decreases in arterial pressure and in renal sympathetic nerve activity. During the first 5 minutes after release of the occlusion, renal nerve activity remained inhibited. After treatment with indomethacin (n = 6, 5 mg/kg i.v.) or sodium meclofenamate (n = 3, 4 mg/kg i.v.), coronary occlusion resulted in significantly less inhibition of renal nerve activity. Renal nerve activity returned to control during the first minute of reperfusion. In six additional experiments the responses to coronary occlusion and reperfusion were not altered by treatment with vehicle. Our data suggest that prostaglandins serve as the major stimulus to ventricular sensory endings during myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. Our data further suggest that reflex inhibitory responses during ischemia and reperfusion are due mainly to stimulation of chemosensitive endings.\r"

The purpose of this study was to investigate the causes of this difference in LIF. Helium-cadmium laser-induced (325 nm) fluorescence was recorded from pure samples of known constituents of normal and atherosclerotic artery including collagen, elastin, calcium, cholesterol, and glycosaminoglycans. Similarities between the LIF spectra of atherosclerotic plaque and collagen and normal aorta and elastin were noted. LIF spectroscopy was then performed on specimens of atherosclerotic aortic plaque (n = 9) and normal aorta (n = 13) and on their extracted lipid, collagen, and elastin. Lipid extraction did not significantly alter atherosclerotic plaque or normal aortic LIF, suggesting a minor contribution of lipid to arterial LIF. The LIF spectra of normal aorta wall was similar to the spectra of the extracted elastin, whereas the LIF spectra of atherosclerotic aortic plaque was similar to the spectra of the extracted collagen. These observations are consistent with the reported relative collagen-to-elastin content ratio of 0.5 for normal arterial wall and 7.3 for atherosclerotic plaque. A classification algorithm was developed to discriminate normal and atherosclerotic aortic spectra based on an elastin and collagen spectral decomposition. A discriminant score was formed by the difference of elastin and collagen (E-C) coefficients and used to classify 182 aortic fluorescence spectra. The mean E-C value was +0.83 +/- 0.04 for normal and -0.48 +/- 0.07 for atherosclerotic aorta (p less than 0.001). Classification accuracy was 92%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Calcium channels play a central role in the regulation of intracellular calcium (Ca2+) concentration, and their function is subject to control by voltage-regulated, receptor-regulated, or voltage- and receptor-regulated mechanisms. Three types of calcium channels have been described. These are the T (transient or \"fast\"), the N (neuronal), and the L (long lasting or \"slow\") channels. The L channels appear to be heterogeneous and have different properties in different tissues. Intracellular calcium-ion concentration can be increased by three types of receptor mechanisms. In the heart, L channels can be phosphorylated by a cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase after beta 1-adrenergic receptor stimulation. In vascular smooth muscle, the postjunctional alpha 2-adrenergic receptor is coupled to a Ca2+ channel by a G protein; receptor stimulation facilitates calcium influx. This channel might be a form of L channel. A third receptor mechanism, especially active in vascular smooth muscle, is typified by the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor that, when stimulated, will activate phospholipase C. This leads to an increase in intracellular inositol trisphosphate (IP3), which is an intracellular messenger that can induce calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Thus, release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerves in the cardiovascular system stimulates the heart and vessels to contract by increasing Ca2+; however, the mechanism by which this occurs is different, depending on whether the noradrenergic agonist interacts with beta 1-, alpha 2-, or alpha 1-adrenergic receptors.\r"

In vitro investigation of its pharmacology was undertaken to determine the foundation of this effect. Based on contractile responses of rabbit arteries to high potassium and norepinephrine, TA-3090 has some selectivity for cerebral and renal artery potential-sensitive and cerebral receptor-operated calcium-dependent mechanisms. It has no effect on arterial contraction to sympathetic nerve stimulation. It prevents the increase in uptake of 45Ca2+ in response to K+ (80 mM) in rabbit thoracic aorta and antagonizes the contractile effect of the putative cerebrovascular spasmogen alpha-thrombin on the femoral artery. All these effects take place in concentrations below those that significantly depress the action of the rabbit atrium. TA-3090 has little or no effect on other factors known to regulate cerebral blood flow (e.g., stretch-induced contraction and flow-induced contraction and dilation). This spectrum of pharmacologic activity suggests that TA-3090 would selectively block Ca2+ entry into cerebrovascular smooth muscle through potential-sensitive and receptor-operated Ca2+ channels that would be expected to increase in subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral ischemia. The action would occur using doses that have little effect on other factors that contribute to the control of cerebral blood flow.\r"

Average gain in length was 5.0 cm per segment (15% of original bone length). All lengthened segments healed without bone grafting or internal fixation. Healing index was 32 days per centimeter gained. The device was well tolerated and easily removed in the clinic setting. There were 13 minor complications, managed without hospitalization. Three angular deformities required manipulation under anesthesia. One angular deformity remains uncorrected, and one patient lacked 1.1 cm of achieving the desired length. All other patients gained the desired length. There were no refractures, deep infections, or other complications. Limb lengthening by the De Bastiani method is a satisfactory procedure for the pediatric and adolescent patient with moderate limb-length discrepancy.\r"

There were 16 male and 13 female patients aged ten to 36 years (mean, 18 years). The total lengthening in each segment ranged from 5 to 16 cm (mean, 9 cm) and mean treatment time from four to 14 months (mean, eight months). The average follow-up time was 2.7 years (range, 0.5-5.5 years). Functional and aesthetic results were all graded as excellent or good. There were no cases of osteomyelitis or deep infection. Three patients sustained neuropraxias that subsequently resolved completely. There were seven fractures in six patients following removal of the apparatus. Five were treated with casts and two with replication of the apparatus. All healed uneventfully. Humeral lengthening can be safely performed with excellent clinical results using the Ilizarov technique.\r"

Only 18 of the 38 procedures were uncomplicated. The main complication was related to the osteosynthesis with plates and screws in the second stage of the method, i.e., six broken plates, six minor pin-tract infections, two deep infections. The results were good in 28 procedures. To treat a leg length inequality, the physician must consider several treatment modalities, such as a lift for the short side. Each patient must be individually evaluated to select the adequate modality of surgical treatment including shortening or epiphysiodesis of the sound limb or lengthening of the shortened limb, procedures with relatively low morbidity.\r"

Rural-dwelling Eskimos had a higher incidence than urban-dwelling Eskimos. Eskimo subpopulations had a greater incidence than Athabascan Indians.

Injection should be performed using proper technique by physicians skilled in carpal tunnel surgery. A soluble preparation of dexamethasone is recommended. Immediate paresthesia in the median nerve distribution or exacerbation of symptoms beyond 48 hours following injection is suspect for inadvertent nerve injury; therefore, early surgical decompression is indicated.\r"

Simultaneous cocontraction of the multiarticular muscles inhibits voluntary movement of the fingers and causes rigidity and involuntary movements.

The average postoperative score of the original group was 83 (range, 52-99 points). There were nine excellent, three good, and four poor results. The average postoperative score of the second group was 89 (range, 73-99 points). There were 24 excellent, 18 good, and four fair results. Giving way was absent in 93% of the patients postoperatively; 88% had a negative pivot-shift test. Sixty-eight percent of the patients no longer used a brace for sports, 24% wore a brace for protection only, and 8% used it for instability. Improvement of at least one grade in the Lachman and anterior drawer tests was found in 61% and 85% of the patients, respectively. Pain was the major reason for fair and poor results. All but one had previous meniscectomy. There were no fair or poor results with menisci intact. So far, there has been no deterioration with time. The procedure remains ideal for recreational athletes who cannot afford a long absence from work and for those patients whose daily activities are compromised by recurrent knee instability.\r"

There have been no previous reports regarding the use of internal fixation in the treatment of nonunion occurring after tibial osteotomy performed proximal to the tibial tubercle. In this report, the results of internal fixation in the treatment of six cases of nonunion after proximal tibial osteotomy are analyzed with regard to functional and roentgenographic results. Healing of the nonunion was obtained in all six patients. Realignment of angulatory deformities was uniformly achieved. Achievement of union and correction of axial malalignment, in addition to creating an improved substrate for later TKA, provided other objectives as well. Elimination of pain and instability at the nonunion site allowed these patients to derive some of the intended benefits from the original osteotomy.\r"

The aim of the study was to determine the relative prognostic accuracy of preoperative versus postoperative scintimetry. A ratio between the radionuclide uptake over the femoral head on the fracture side and the contralateral side exceeding 1.9 at the preoperative scintimetry and 1.2 at the postoperative scintimetry was associated with a high incidence of union, whereas a lower ratio often predicted subsequent complications (redisplacement, nonunion, or late segmental collapse). Prognostic accuracy was higher for scintimetry of fractures treated with closed reduction and internal fixation (0.70) than for untreated fractures (0.53). These results suggest that scintimetry is useful postoperatively to complement roentgenographic examination in assessing the prognosis of femoral neck fractures.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-nine patients with tibial plateau fractures and concomitant ligament injury were evaluated at least one year after injury. Ligamentous injury was determined by stress roentgenograms, plain roentgenograms, operative findings, and Pelle-grini-Stieda's ossification. There were 22 isolated medial collateral, eight lateral collateral, one isolated anterior cruciate, and eight combined ligament injuries. All types of tibial plateau fractures were associated with ligamentous injury, although split compression and local compression were most common. Twenty patients (Group 1) did not have operative repair of the injured ligaments, and 19 patients (Group 2) had primary repair of the injured ligaments. Open reduction and internal fixation of the plateau fracture(s) were performed in 13 patients in Group 1 and 19 patients in Group 2. Follow-up evaluation (100-point scale), including subjective, functional, and anatomic factors, revealed 12 excellent and good, four fair, and three poor results in the 19 patients with ligamentous repair. There were ten excellent and good, two fair, and eight poor results in those without ligament repair. Ten of the 12 patients with 10 degrees or more of instability had poor results. These poor results included five unrepaired medial collateral ligaments, two unrepaired lateral collateral ligaments, and three patients with cruciate ligament injury. This study confirms the view that instability is a major cause of unacceptable results in tibial plateau fractures. Operative repair of medial and lateral collateral ligaments, with appropriate treatment of the bony plateau fracture, may reduce late instability and may improve overall morbidity in these concomitant injuries. Cruciate ligament injury associated with a tibial plateau fracture carries a poor prognosis.\r"

After resection of the sequestra, all four patients had significant bone defects of the anterior tibial cortex extending to the ankle joint. The average number of failed previous surgical procedures was 5.8. The average patient age was 35.3 years. The intervals of nonunion averaged 24.8 months. In two patients, the hBMP, including other low molecular weight bone matrix noncollagenous proteins (hBMP/NCP), was implanted across the fracture site in polylactic-polyglycollic acid strips (1 X 13 cm) as an onlay graft. In one patient, the BMP was implanted in the fracture gap in absorbable gelatin (No. 5 capsules). In another patient, the BMP/NCP was also implanted in the form of a composite of cortical allogeneic bone in addition to a capsule of BMP/NCP. In all four cases, alignment was restored and the bone ends were stabilized with internal fixation. Preoperatively, the ankle joints were ankylosed and painful. Healed fractures and functional ankle joints were observed in three of four patients at an average of 4.4 months. In one patient, the fracture healed but the joint remained ankylosed. Although a randomized double-blind consecutive series of matched cases is necessary to prove the efficacy of hBMP, implants of hBMP combined with skillful surgical treatment are under investigation in the interim as an alternative to amputation.\r"

  ".W": "Synovial biopsies were performed on 84 patients with monoarticular synovitis from 1960 to 1984. Twenty-seven (32%) of 84 patients were pathologically differentiated; however, the other patients remained classified as nonspecific monoarthritic. Follow-up studies of nonspecific monoarthritis ranging from five to 25 years (average, 15 years) were carried out in 34 patients. Five patients (15%) disclosed polyarticular involvement and were diagnosed as having classic rheumatoid arthritis (RA) within five years after initial biopsy (RA group). In the remainder (non-RA group), 19 patients recovered completely and nine of ten patients complained of a slight degree of joint involvement. A good prognosis was observed in younger patients and in those who showed minimal histologic changes in the synovium. Initial laboratory examinations, including a white cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and agglutination test, did not show any differences between the RA and the non-RA groups. To determine predicting factors for RA, a comparative histologic study of the initial specimens was performed. Specimens from the RA group showed a predominant appearance of lymphoid aggregates, high endothelial postcapillary venules, and proliferative plasma cell infiltration. These histologic features suggest the future appearance of RA; therefore, careful observation and early treatment should be considered for these patients.\r"

All eight were of similar age (range, 14.2 to 19 years), body build (asthenic), and clinical presentation. The presentation included nausea and intermittent, voluminous, bile-stained vomiting, despite intervening periods of normal appetite and bowel sounds. The average delay in diagnosis was five days. Nasogastric drainage and intravenous fluids were the mainstay of treatment and were successful in every case. Fifty percent of the patients had more than one episode requiring treatment; each episode resolved with simple treatment. Two of three patients with body casts required cast removal. No patient required intravenous hyperalimentation, removal of spinal instrumentation, or abdominal surgery to relieve the obstruction. Three of the eight patients had not had spinal surgery or cast immobilization.\r"

Sixty patients having clean total joint surgery were randomly divided into two preoperative skin preparation groups (30 in each). In one group, the skin was prepared with a traditional five-minute aqueous iodophor scrub followed by the application of an aqueous iodophor solution as a paint. In the other group, the skin was prepared with a one-step application of a water-insoluble iodophor-in-alcohol solution applied as a paint. Bacterial colony counts were made by sampling the incision area with culture plates before skin preparation and just prior to wound closure. The one-step application of a water-insoluble iodophor-in-alcohol solution was equally as effective as the traditional scrub-and-paint preparation in reducing the number of bacteria about the operative site. The water-insoluble preparation also resulted in significantly improved drape adhesion as compared to the standard scrub-and-paint procedure. The one-step water-insoluble iodophor-in-alcohol solution fulfills the requirements for an operative site skin preparation and significantly improves drape adhesion. It is more convenient, easier to apply, less time consuming, and potentially less expensive than the traditional scrub-and-paint method.\r"

Dual energy gadolinium-153 photonabsorptiometry was used to measure distal leg bone loss at a skeletal segment distant from the fracture to exclude callus formation. Total bone mineral (TBM) and bone mineral density (BMD) of the tibia and fibula both in the fractured leg and in the healthy contralateral leg were measured on Days 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, and 120 after trauma. TBM and BMD of the healthy contralateral leg did not present any significant modifications at the different observation times. Both TBM and BMD of the fractured leg showed a progressive reduction that reached statistical significance starting on Day 30 with maximum reduction on Day 120 when TBM and BMD were reduced to almost one-half the initial value.\r"

During the 20-year follow-up period, humerus function was restored. Roentgenograms showed incorporation of the graft without any recurrence of the disease. This experience and reports in the literature show that only predominantly cortical autogeneic bone grafting has been successful. This could be due to the intrinsic characteristic of cortical bone. In fact, it seems that cortical bone shows greater resistance to erosion than cancellous bone to the lymphangiomatous osteolytic tissue. Therefore, autogenous bone grafting could be considered as a reasonable alternative to radiotherapy, particularly in young people with monostotic disease localized in bones that are easily operable and have no soft-tissue involvement.\r"

The lengthening procedure was applied for various periods through the Ilizarov system on the forearms of mature dogs. Bone was sectioned either by corticotomy, preserving the nutrient artery integrity, or by osteotomy. When an osteotomy was performed, the marrow cavity was in some cases plugged with either resorbable bone wax or nonresorbable material. Under distraction, both periosteal and medullary callus on either side of the gap gave rise to new bone trabeculae. The trabeculae on either side were oriented along the direction of distraction and progressively approached one another. This striated callus emerging from both sides was the most characteristic pattern of bone regeneration subsequent to distraction lengthening. Fusion was achieved approximately four weeks after the end of the lengthening period. Most of the new bone was formed by membranous ossification; some cartilaginous nodules developed. Corticalization of the bone trabeculae that had begun at three months was not fully achieved at five months after the lengthening period. There were no differences found in the pattern of bone healing and the amount of newly formed bone after corticotomy or osteotomy with or without resorbable bone wax plugging.\r"

Four dogs each were killed on Days 7, 14, 21, and 28 of distraction in order to correlate QCT with microradiology, nondecalcified histology, quantitative calcium analysis, and scanning electron microscopy. It was consistently found that intramembranous ossification proceeded centripetally from each corticotomy surface toward the central fibrous interzone. Bone columns crystallized along longitudinally oriented collagen bundles, expanding circumferentially to surrounding bundles. As the distraction gap increased, the bone columns increased in length and in diameter, while the fibrous interzone remained about 4 mm long. Histologically, the bone columns resembled stalagmites and stalactites, as seen by microradiography and scanning electron microscopy, that projected from each corticotomy surface toward the center. These cones reached maximum diameters of 150-200 mu at the corticotomy surfaces. Radiodensity (QCT) increased gradually from the central fibrous interzone toward each corticotomy surface. Mineral density, as determined by calcium quantification, reflected the microscopic geometry and radiographic polarity.\r"

There was a statistical difference between fixators in all modes of loading with respect to stiffness, shear, and axial motion. The fixators were graded to determine their relative stiffness, shear rigidity, and axial rigidity. The EBI Orthofix proved to be the most rigid fixator relative to the configurations tested with minimal shear or axial motion at the fracture site. The Ilizarov tibial configuration was the least rigid, demonstrating more shear and axial motion at the fracture gap. The Ilizarov femoral system combined excellent stability and shear resistance with preservation of axial dynamization. Fixators with a high stiffness provide less motion at the fracture site, which may cause stress shielding of the osteotomy. Fixators that provide more motion at the fracture gap are less stable. These data may be useful in determining which fixator may be ideal for a particular clinical situation.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine the relationships among force, stiffness, and distracted length in a patient whose leg was lengthened 50 mm with the Ilizarov procedure. A modified Ilizarov apparatus with force transducers in its three columns was surgically applied to the left tibia of an 11-year-old female patient after corticotomy of the proximal metaphysis. The leg was distracted 0.25 mm four times daily for 50 days, commencing six days after surgery. At approximately weekly intervals, forces at rest were recorded before and after distraction. Resting predistractional force magnitudes increased almost linearly during the first three weeks of lengthening, from 49 N to 223 N. The rate of increase slowed markedly thereafter with a further force increase of 11 N in the next three weeks. The stiffness of the limb, derived from the change in force accompanying the 0.25-mm change in length, increased by approximately 3.9%/mm of distracted length with 95% confidence limits of 6.8% and 0.9%. These results show marked differences from the nonlinearly increasing force-displacement relationship during in vitro limb distraction.\r"

In the patient study, both slow distraction rates and low constant distraction loads were applied. For all the distraction regimens, it was not possible to lengthen the limb significantly without evidence of fracture as demonstrated by a sudden decrease in distraction force. Growth plate failure was observed from 600 to 800 N, these levels being lower than those recorded from the in vitro tests. In the animal study, three distraction regimens (0.13, 0.26, and 0.53 mm/day) were applied across the upper tibial growth plate of New Zealand white rabbits close to skeletal maturity. Distraction was applied and force measured using a strain-gauge dual-frame external fixator. The force-time results revealed two distinct patterns. One pattern, in which the forces rapidly increased to maximum values of approximately 25 N and then suddenly decreased, indicated fracture of the growth plate, which was confirmed histologically. In the other pattern, forces increased steadily throughout distraction, reaching maximum values at the end of distraction of approximately 16 N. Histologic observations indicated hyperplasia of the growth plate without fracture, however, only a small increase in limb length was detectable. Hence, if a significant increase in leg length is required close to skeletal maturity, then fracture of the growth plate must occur.\r"

Another group of three animals whose femurs were lengthened at a rate of 0.5 mm/day was killed ten days postoperatively. Roentgenologic, specimen measurements, and histologic studies were performed on all animals. The results obtained showed that the basic mechanism for lengthening is the production of a physeal fracture between degenerative and calcified layers; this finding was consistent. It was also observed that the lower the rate of distraction employed, the greater was the short- and long-term viability of the growth cartilage. More specifically, optimal viability was observed when a distraction rate of 0.5 mm/day was employed.\r"

The following study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that children with PBHS have underlying autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction. Five patients (age 29-79 months old) who had experienced PBHS were evaluated at a time when they were clear of spells for ANS dysfunction. A battery of clinical bedside tests were given. The results were compared with test results of a control group of children (age 18-104 months) who had not experienced PBHS. Data collected included blood pressure, pulse rate, mean arterial pressure, the 30:15 R-R ratio upon standing, the expiratory:inspiratory (E:I) R-R ratio, pupillary response to conjunctival pilocarpine instillation, and plasma norepinephrine levels upon standing. Breath-holders displayed a statistically significant (p less than 0.05) percent decrease in mean arterial pressure (-10.2% PBHS vs. -4.1% controls) and an unsustained increase in pulse rate during the lying to standing maneuver. Two children with PBHS had \"positive orthostatic signs,\" and one child with PBHS had a plasma norepinephrine level of 94 pg/ml (60% below the mean for both groups). There is evidence to suggest a subtle, underlying, generalized autonomic dysfunction in children with PBHS. A strong familial tendency toward syncope, breath-holding spells, and seizures was recognized in nine of ten subjects. Additionally, there was a strong influence from the maternal side of the family in seven of nine subjects.\r"

The treatment of choice is surgical excision. Inadequate primary excision results in a 4 to 10 percent recurrence. Hence, a thorough preoperative evaluation is essential to delineate the exact site and extension of the tumor and to plan the appropriate surgical approach. Computerized tomographic (CT) scans are useful in visualizing bony defects, but are not well suited for soft tissue imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers superior soft tissue contrast, without ionizing radiation. This is a report of a neonate with unexplained early respiratory distress. On day 5, a soft nasal mass became apparent. CT scans were inconclusive, so MRI scan was used to demonstrate intracranial extension. MRI is superior for imaging brain tissue, so it should be used preferentially to delineate intracranial extension and to help guide the surgical approach.\r"

Serum concentrations of the drug and of its probable metabolite were monitored in eight patients after a 25 mg oral dose, in six patients after a 50 mg oral dose, in four patients after repeated administration of 50 mg, and in two patients after a small intravenous dose. Urinary excretion of drug and metabolite for 24 hours was measured in one of the patients who received a small intravenous dose. The serum half-life was 1.59 +/- 0.15 hours (mean +/- SEM) after the 25 mg dose, 2.14 +/- 0.24 hours after the 50 mg dose, and 2.91 +/- 0.39 hours after continuous treatment. After intravenous administration, clearance was above 600 ml/min in both patients, and oral bioavailability was calculated at below 5%. Urine recovery was less than 3% of the dose. The low bioavailability of tacrine hydrochloride is partly explained by presystemic metabolism.\r"

Competitive inhibition may therefore be possible when these substances are used concomitantly in patients with hyperlipidemic disorders. The aim of this study was to determine, in six healthy subjects, whether nicotinic acid steady-state levels and total clearance are affected by concomitant aspirin administration. Steady-state nicotinic acid concentrations were obtained in all six volunteers by infusion of nicotinic acid solutions at constant rates (0.075 to 0.100 mg/kg/min) for 6 hours; aspirin (1 gm) was administered orally 120 minutes after the beginning of the infusion of nicotinic acid. Plasma samples were analyzed for nicotinic acid, nicotinuric acid, and salicylic acid. After aspirin administration an immediate marked decrease of nicotinuric acid levels could be observed in all six volunteers, whereas nicotinic acid concentrations increased. We hypothesize that salicylic acid causes a concentration-dependent decrease of total nicotinic acid clearance that results in the saturation (and effective elimination) of the nicotinuric acid conjugation pathway.\r"

Dilevalol was given as a single 50 mg intravenous dose and as a 400 mg daily oral dose for 7 days. To study the effects of hepatic enzyme inhibition, each subject received dilevalol in the presence of and absence of cimetidine. Cardiac beta-blockade was assessed by use of standardized treadmill tests for 48 hours after oral dilevalol. The three-compartment model analysis showed that systemic clearance (29.8 +/- 5.7 ml/min/kg), volume of distribution (16.6 +/- 4.1 L/kg), and terminal half-life (11.7 +/- 2.7 hours) were not altered by cimetidine. However, there was a 20% increase in the area under the curve (p less than 0.05) and an 11% increase in systemic bioavailability (p less than 0.05) after oral administration. Dilevalol caused significant cardiac beta-blockade for more than 24 hours, but these effects were not altered by cimetidine. The pharmacokinetic changes are consistent with a decrease in first-pass extraction of a high clearance drug.\r"

  ".W": "Suprofen, a new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, was marketed in early 1986 as an analgesic agent. Until physicians began reporting an unusual acute flank pain syndrome to the spontaneous reporting system, 700,000 persons used the drug in the United States. Through August 1986, a total of 163 cases of this syndrome were reported. To elucidate the epidemiology of the syndrome, a case-control study was performed, comparing 62 of the case patients who had been reported to the spontaneous reporting system to 185 suprofen-exposed control subjects who did not have the syndrome. Case patients were more likely to be men (odds ratio, 3.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-12.1), suffer from hay fever and asthma (odds ratio, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-11.9); to participate in regular exercise (odds ratio, 5.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-30.7), especially in the use of Nautilus equipment (p = 0.02); and to use alcohol (odds ratio, 4.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-17.5). Possible risk factors included young age, concurrent use of other analgesic agents (especially ibuprofen), preexisting renal disease, a history of kidney stones, a history of gout, a recent increase in activity, a recent increase in sun exposure, and residence in the Sunbelt. These were findings that were suggestive but did not reach conventional statistical significance. These findings are consistent with the postulated mechanism for this unusual syndrome: acute diffuse crystallization of uric acid in renal tubules.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of an antacid (Maalox) and ranitidine administration on the absorption of ciprofloxacin was evaluated in healthy male volunteers who were enrolled in three separate studies. Each study was designed at a three- or four-period crossover and included the administration of 750 mg ciprofloxacin alone as a control treatment. Treatments that were evaluated included the administration of ciprofloxacin 5 to 10 minutes, 2 hours, 4 hours, and 6 hours after a single 30 ml dose of antacid; the administration of antacid 2 hours after ciprofloxacin was given; and the administration of ciprofloxacin 2 hours after a 200 mg ranitidine tablet. Administration of antacid within 4 hours before ciprofloxacin dose resulted in a significant decrease in ciprofloxacin absorption (p less than 0.05). Percentages of relative bioavailability compared with control values were 15.1%, 23.2%, and 70% for the 5 to 10 minute, 2 hour, and 4 hour antacid pretreatments, respectively. Administration of antacid 6 hours before or 2 hours after the ciprofloxacin dose did not affect absorption. Ranitidine did not alter ciprofloxacin absorption. Antacids that contain magnesium and aluminum salts may reduce the absorption of ciprofloxacin. The extent of this interaction appears to increase as the time between administration of the two drugs decreases. Ranitidine is suggested as an alternative to antacids for patients receiving treatment with ciprofloxacin.\r"

Rabbit skin erythema scores were obtained 1, 24, 48 and 72 h after application of the undiluted substances for 4 h. The uridine uptake inhibition assay on KB cells was included as a cytotoxicity test. Results obtained for both protocols on humans are compared with each other and with the test data obtained on rabbits, and with the cytotoxicity data. Application of the undiluted substances for 48 h on human skin or for only 3 h at a 10% dilution resulted in the same ranking between the substances. The CBFV in the human correlated very well (r = 0.99) with erythema scores obtained on rabbits. A poor correlation was observed between the in vitro and the in vivo results. From this study, it can be concluded that CBFV measurement is a valid method for the detection of erythema at subclinical concentrations.\r"

In 70% of 300 patients evaluated, dermatitis started on the earlobes and was related to the regular wearing of cheap earrings. At the same time, 62% of 735 young schoolgirls were found to have dermatitis of their earlobes and all regularly wore cheap earrings. 9 clasps and clips commonly used in earrings released high quantities of nickel ions (between 49 and 103 micrograms/12 h), having been stored in synthetic sweat. A round piece cut from a clasp was taped to the skin of 30 nickel-sensitive patients, previously tested with 20 microliters of NiSO4 5%, 2.5%, 1% aq. solutions, giving a response similar to that caused by the 5% solution. High daily absorption of Ni ions through the skin follows its repetitive exposure to cheap earrings, causing, firstly, a direct inflammatory reaction, then followed, in our opinion, by sensitization.\r"

The estimated intra- and inter-individual variations, by sites, were 15.5% and 84.5%, respectively, the sum of the 2 components always being 100%. With the exclusion of the 2 most distal sites near the wrist, which had significantly higher baseline TEWL values and fluctuations in TEWL, an improvement in the intra-individual variation was obtained. Thus, of the 6 sites, the estimated intra- and inter-individual variations were 8.4% and 91.6%, respectively. This finding supports the exclusion of these most distal sites for future investigations. The estimated intra- and inter-individual variations, by days, were 20.6% and 79.4%, respectively. The low site-to-site (8.4%) and day-to-day (20.6%) intra-individual variations, as compared to the large inter-individual variations of the same (91.6% and 79.4%), indicate that baseline TEWL is a stable personal characteristic. Thus, individual susceptible to irritant contact dermatitis (ICD), due to occupational exposure, may be reliably characterized by utilizing their baseline TEWL values, for \"prediction\" of risk in epidemiological field studies.\r"

A subset of patients had 24-h Holter monitoring. SPECT scan was performed within 24 h of injury. Seventy-five patients had positive scans and 48 had negative. Two studies could not be completed. Eleven patients with positive studies developed serious arrhythmias (multiple premature ventricular beats or atrial fibrillation). None of these patients had a prior history of cardiac disease. While three patients with negative SPECT scans had arrhythmias, each had a prior history of cardiac disease and two were on chronic antiarrhythmia therapy. Neither ECG findings, creatinine phosphokinase (CPK), nor CPK-isoenzymes distinguished between those patients who did and did not develop arrhythmias. We conclude that SPECT scan is useful in screening patients at risk of developing arrhythmias from cardiac contusion. Utilization of SPECT scan allows early discharge of a significant number of patients with blunt chest trauma who would otherwise require hospitalization for arrhythmia monitoring.\r"

Not all software approaches are equally well suited to the task. Twenty-one specific software characteristics were identified that promote efficient development and support clinical needs. Using a software tool that satisfied these characteristics, we developed a computerized medical chart system that physicians can use to write notes and document patient encounters. The success of this system was due to a good fit between the basic capabilities of the software approach and the requirements of the project. These criteria can serve as the starting point for evaluating or developing other software applications that depend on physician input of clinical information.\r"

All patients had dyspnea, pulmonary rales, hypoxemia, tachycardia, hypotension, overhydration, radiologic evidence of engorged pulmonary vasculature, and Kerley-B lines. Systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures, cardiac output (by thermodilution), and intrapulmonary shunt fraction (Qsp/Qt) were determined and chest x-ray was obtained at the beginning and the end of UF. Average duration of the treatment was 150 +/- 28 min; UF volume averaged 3000 +/- 170 ml. UF reduced the Qsp/Qt by 58% from control condition, and did not significantly affect hemodynamic variables. Chest x-rays documented clearing of alveolar edema and venous congestion. These changes were associated with unequivocal clinical improvement and no mechanical ventilation was necessary to improve gas exchange. Short-term fluid subtraction did not result in undesired circulatory alternations. Because the ultrafiltrate composition is similar to plasmatic fluid, no modification in the plasma osmolarity was detected. In conclusion, UF may be considered an effective tool for the treatment of acute pulmonary edema refractory to drug therapy, as an alternative to mechanical ventilation, and as a remedy for excessive extravascular lung water.\r"

Electrolyte and digoxin levels were obtained from 99 patients during resuscitative efforts. Measurements were examined for association with pre and postarrest values, outcome from arrest, and presence or absence of refractory ventricular arrhythmias. While BUN and creatinine (Cr) values correlated closely with pre and postarrest levels (r2 greater than 50%), Na, K, and Ca measurements were less reflective (r2 less than 50%). When electrolyte levels obtained during CPR were correlated with outcome, linear regression showed a consistent trend for higher levels in patients who subsequently died (K p less than .001; Mg p less than .02; Na p less than .025; Ca p less than .02; BUN p less than .02; Cr p less than .025). Finally, among the 12 patients with documented refractory ventricular arrhythmias, there appeared to be little association with K, Mg, and digoxin abnormalities observed during resuscitative efforts. These results suggest that electrolyte levels during CPR are strongly affected by metabolic disturbances and therapeutic interventions, and consequently, the clinical usefulness of these measurements may be limited.\r"

Variations in piperacillin disposition were best explained by serum concentrations of albumin, total protein, and bilirubin, and the amount of urea nitrogen excreted daily in urine. Age and renal function were moderately associated with piperacillin elimination rate and clearance. Altered piperacillin disposition thus appeared to occur as secondary to changes in the patients' physiologic and metabolic state caused by injury-related stress and fluid/colloid therapy. These alterations may necessitate dosage modifications to achieve optimal patient response when treating patients with piperacillin as well as with other similar drugs eliminated via renal and nonrenal routes.\r"

Vit E, lipoperoxides (LP), total lipids, and fatty acid plasma levels were measured in 12 patients with ARDS (PaO2 less than or equal to 60 Torr with FIO2 0.6 on mechanical ventilation). At the onset of ARDS (T0), the decrease in Vit E plasma level was significant (p less than .001) 7.73 +/- 0.54 (n = 12) vs. 11.46 +/- 0.55 mg/L (n = 7) in the control group (healthy subjects breathing room air).

Over 12 months, 92 patients with LBPF admitted to a Level I trauma center were prospectively evaluated. Arterial blood gases, Hct, platelet count, serum fibrinogen, serum lipase, and urinary fat bodies (UFB) were determined serially from admission through the fifth hospital day. Patients were evaluated daily by chest x-ray, vital signs, mental status, and presence of petechiae. Four patient groups were established: No Qsp, Qsp with pulmonary injury (Qsp + PI), Qsp without pulmonary injury or petechaie (FES - P), and Qsp without pulmonary injury and with petechiae (FES + P). Qsp indicated by an alveolar/arterial PO2 gradient greater than 100 torr developed in 49 (53%) of the patients. Pulmonary injury was present in 39 (81%) of those 49 and was at least partially responsible for the shunt. The remaining ten patients were diagnosed as having FES; four had petechiae (FES + P) and six were without petechiae (FES - P). The minimum incidence of FES in LBPF is therefore 11%.\r"

Because the dosage and timing of these agents are considered critical factors in their efficacy, we investigated both dosage and timing of naloxone. Thirteen consecutive patients with documented septic shock and resistance to a one-liter fluid challenge underwent invasive hemodynamic monitoring and the administration of naloxone by initial bolus of 0.03 mg/kg followed by infusion at a rate of 0.2 mg/kg.h over one hour. During the one-hour observation period, iv fluid administration, concomitant pressor agents, and respirator values were constant. After infusion, adjustments in fluid administration, respirator status, and pressor agents were made as required by the clinical situation. A significant increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP) over baseline (60 +/- 3 mm Hg) was noted at 5 min (77 +/- 6 mm Hg, p less than .005) and at 30 min (73 +/- 6 mm Hg, p less than .025). Similarly, a significant increase in systolic arterial pressure was noted over prenaloxone levels (89 +/- 3 mm Hg) at 5 min (114 +/- 6 mm Hg, p less than .001), 30 min (107 +/- 8 mm Hg, p less than .05), and at one hour (106 +/- 8 mm Hg, p less than .05). There was a moderate nonsignificant increase in cardiac index, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and systemic vascular resistance. No side-effects to naloxone were noted in our group. No effect on survival could be demonstrated. We found no overall effect on mortality. However, by its increase of MAP, naloxone may serve as a temporizing agent during the treatment of critically ill patients with septic shock.\r"

  ".W": "Previously, we determined that a colloid concentration of about 3% was optimal for resuscitation of lethal ischemic intestinal shock model in rats. Maximal volumes of lactated Ringer's solution (RL) alone only expanded plasma volume (PV) to 80% of preshock level, while increasing volumes of 3% albumin (ALB) in RL linearly expanded PV up to twice the preshock level. This study compares the effect of RL and ALB on survival and PV in 175 rats. The solutions were given in volumes to induce suboptimal PV expansion, requiring 10 and 44 ml/100 g body weight (bwt) of ALB and RL, respectively. ALB (20 ml/100 g bwt) was then given to induce a PV above the preshock level. Shock was induced by exteriorizing the small intestine and occluding the superior mesenteric vessels for 75 min. PV was estimated using Hct. Therefore, infusions were given continuously for 6 h in volumes that maintained a stable Hct. Untreated shocked animals developed hemoconcentration (Hct 58%) corresponding to a PV of 56% of preshock level, with 2% (1/53) of the animals surviving 24 h. The maximum effect of RL (44 ml/100 g bwt) was to expand PV to 80% of preshock level, with a 32% 24-h survival rate. Only 23% as much ALB (10 ml/100 g bwt) was needed to induce similar blood volume expansion with 24-h survival rate of 46%. When the larger volume of ALB (20 ml/100 g bwt) was used, PV expanded to 115% of preshock level, and 24-h survival to 76%, greater than that achieved with either the smaller volume of ALB or RL alone (p less than .01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After tracheostomy, rats were randomized to spontaneous breathing (S) or mechanical ventilation with paralysis (V). Five animals were studied in each group. The V animals were paralyzed with pancuronium bromide to eliminate respiratory effort. Mechanical ventilation consisted of controlled ventilation using a rodent respirator with periodic adjustment of minute ventilation to maintain PaCO2 and pH within normal range. Arterial and central venous blood gases and thermodilution cardiac output were measured at baseline before abdominal surgery, and sequentially at 0.5, 3.5, and 6 h after surgery. At 6 h, cardiac output was 193 +/- 30 ml/kg.min in S animals and 199 +/- 32 ml/kg.min in V animals (NS). The central venous oxygen saturation was 27.4 +/- 4.7% in S animals and 30.0 +/- 6.4% in V animals (NS). Systemic oxygen extraction was 70 +/- 5% in S animals and 67 +/- 6% in V animals (NS). Arterial lactate was 2.4 +/- 0.4 mmol/L in S animals and 2.2 +/- 0.5 mmol/L in V animals (NS). The S animals developed lethal hypotension at 6.6 +/- 0.4 h compared to 6.8 +/- 0.4 h in V animals (NS). These data suggest that mechanical ventilation does not decrease systemic oxygen extraction or ameliorate the development of lactic acidosis during septic shock.\r"

This system was evaluated in three different human studies. In the first two studies, the accuracy of the system was compared with He dilution and body plethysmography in 12 spontaneously breathing normal volunteers and in 12 spontaneously breathing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. In the third study, the reproducibility and efficacy of using the system in the ICU was tested in 12 adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients who were mechanically ventilated with PEEP. In the normal volunteers, there was no significant difference between the three measurement techniques. In the COPD group, there was an overall significant difference between measurement techniques (F[2,28] = 17.18, p less than .0001) and the rank of the magnitude of the FRC measurements from lowest to highest was SF6 washout, He dilution, and body plethysmography. There was a significant difference in accuracy between the COPD and normal volunteer groups (F[2,28] = 12.24, p less than .0002). There were a total of 1,227 FRC measurements made on the 12 ARDS patients. The number of FRC measurements per patient was 102 +/- 13 (SEM). The \"stable\" periods were 14 +/- 2 h long and ranged from 60 min to 63.5 h. The reproducibility for all 12 patients was 188 +/- 17 ml or 11.7 +/- 0.7%.

  ".W": "We measured breathing patterns utilizing a respiratory inductive plethysmograph (RIP) in seven healthy nonsedated lambs after an iv infusion of oleic acid (50 mg/kg) to induce acute pulmonary edema. Our single position graphic (SPG) calibration technique was employed for gain factor calculation. Accuracy was validated by the simultaneous volume measurement of RIP and integrated pneumotachography (PNT). Of a total 840 validation breaths, 467 (56%) were within 5% of PNT, 734 (87%) were within 10%, and 834 (99.9%) were within 20%. In each study baseline physiologic and breathing pattern data were collected and also at 15, 30, 60, 90, 150, and 210 min postoleic acid infusion. Validation of RIP accuracy before each data collection revealed 29% required new gain factor calculation. Recalibration was done within 5 min. Excluding respiratory frequency, which remained at 30% above baseline, variables were not significantly different than baseline measurements at the 210-min interval. Results suggest that calibration of RIP using our SPG technique is a time-efficient method and that RIP can accurately measure breathing patterns, providing an additional tool for assessment of experimental lung injury in lambs.\r"

  ".U": "90091539\r", 
  ".W": "Endotracheal intubation is not without complications, among the most serious of these being misplacement of the endotracheal (ET) tube. Unrecognized esophageal placement is a lethal complication, but even when placed in the trachea, ET tubes can be displaced distally and enter a mainstem bronchus. Correct positioning of an ET tube is usually defined as the placement of the tube within the trachea approximately 5 cm above the carina. Chest x-ray is the most common and a reliable method of demonstrating correct positioning, particularly in ICU patients. Using transillumination by means of a flexible stylet (lightwand), we investigated whether transillumination could position an ET tube consistently within 5 +/- 2 cm of the carina. Ten human cadavers of varied weight and body habitus were intubated under direct vision and 10 ml of a radiopaque dye was injected down the tube as a marker for the carina. A premeasured flexible lighted stylet was then inserted into the inplace tube so that the bulb was positioned at the tube's distal opening. The brightest transilluminated glow produced by the bulb was then positioned at the sternal notch. A chest x-ray was taken and the distance of the tube tip from the carina was calculated. In each case the tube tip could be placed consistently at a level 5 +/- 1 cm from the carina by observing the maximal transilluminated glow at the sternal notch. We conclude that transillumination of the neck using a flexible lighted stylet can accurately and consistently position an ET tube at an appropriate distance above the carina.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Data were collected by a mailed symptom questionnaire. The prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome in the gynecological group was 37.3% compared with 27.7% in controls (P = 0.003). Approximately 50% of women referred with abdominal pain, dyspareunia, and dysmenorrhea had symptoms compatible with irritable bowel syndrome (P less than 0.005), whereas the prevalence in those referred for cervical abnormalities, termination/sterilization or perineal problems was similar to that of controls (28%). Patients referred with urinary symptoms, heavy periods, nonmenstrual bleeding, vaginal discharge, and infertility had an intermediate prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (35-45%). This study suggests that either many women with irritable bowel syndrome are being wrongly referred to gynecologists or raises the possibility that symptoms currently regarded as indicative of irritable bowel syndrome may be associated with certain gynecological disorders.\r"

  ".W": "Concentration and voltage dependence of unidirectional Mg fluxes across the rat colon ascendens were measured in a modified Ussing chamber. Mucosa (M) to serosa (S) Mg flux exhibits a cellular component, whereas SM flux is totally diffusive. At all the concentrations between 0.125 and 8 mmol/liter MS Mg transport is higher than the flux in the opposite direction, resulting in Mg absorption. In contrast to Mg, in Ca transport a cellular component is involved in both directions across the tissue, 1 alpha, 25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 has no influence on the Mg transport. Mg (5 mmol/liter) remarkably decreases MS Ca flux and reduces Ca absorption by 70%. The parallel decrease in MS Ca flux with that of the simultaneously measured paracellular marker mannitol and the voltage clamp experiments reveal that Mg has no influence on cellular Ca transport but only reduces diffusive MS Ca flux, possibly by decreasing transepithelial fluid absorption. The experiments demonstrate that the colon ascendens of the rat is capable of absorbing Mg at rates comparable to that found for Ca. There is evidence that Mg and Ca are transported by separate cellular mechanisms. Diffusive movement across the paracellular route plays an important role on net transport of both earth alkali ions.\r"

  ".W": "The course of 205 patients with Crohn's disease at one gastroenterological center was studied in patients with conservative drug treatment or with operative management of their disease. The decision for one or the other treatment regimen was made by an interdisciplinary team of gastroenterologists and surgeons. Using life-table analysis the 205 patients showed a clinical relapse rate of 27% after two years and 38% after four years. Clinical relapse was defined by a Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) over 150. We used a standardized drug regimen of salazosulfapyridin and prednisone; the indication for excisional surgery was limited strictly to life-threatening situations, absolute nonresponse to drug treatment, and severe intervisceral fistulae. The operated patients (N = 93) had a lower relapse rate than the patients treated conservatively (N = 112), 20% and 51%, respectively, after four years. There were considerably fewer relapses in Crohn's colitis patients who were operated upon than in conservatively treated patients (18% versus 67% after four years); the same was found for ileocolitis (20% vs 49% after four years), but there was no difference between the treatment groups in ileitis (25-30% relapses for both after four years). In addition the patients with Crohn's disease of the colon had a more favorable course after resection with respect to symptoms, clinical and laboratory findings, and CDAI in remission. This paper gives data only for surgery in severe clinical situations and does not give a rationale for earlier surgery. This problem should now be studied in a randomized trial.\r"

After three weeks of treatment with a high-dose antacid, there was no detectable change in the total capacity of the mucosa for prostaglandin synthesis, but the prostaglandin profile was markedly altered. The relative amounts of PGE2 and PGF2 alpha synthesized by antral and duodenal mucosa increased at the expense of the prostaglandins A2/B2, thromboxane A2, and prostacyclin. In a short-term study, this change was not observed following a single antacid dose within 1 hr after application. It is concluded that long-term antacid treatment may alter the prostaglandin pattern formed by gastroduodenal mucosa and this may be related to its therapeutic effect.\r"

  ".U": "90091709\r", 
  ".W": "Protection of the gastric mucosa may be the result of either increased cellular resistance to injury (cytoprotection) or, alternatively, decreased exposure of mucosal cells to the damaging agent. To determine whether decreased exposure of mucosal cells to damaging agents plays a role in mucosal protection by 16,16-dm PGE2 or sodium thiosulfate, we estimated the intramucosal concentration of 22NaCl and measured its absorption from the gastric lumen into the systemic circulation 1 and 5 min after intragastric administration of hypertonic (25% w/v) 22NaCl. In an attempt to explain the differences observed, we also measured the net transmucosal water flux in control animals and rats pretreated with the protective agents. Administration of hypertonic NaCl rapidly (within 1 min) induced extensive hemorrhagic mucosal lesions that were significantly reduced by pretreatment with 16,16-dm PGE2 or sodium thiosulfate. Ultra-low temperature autoradiography indicated that luminal hypertonic 22NaCl penetrates the upper layers of the mucosa in relatively high concentrations (12.5% w/v) within 1 min but its concentration decreases rapidly and reached low levels (3.12% w/v) by 5 min. Absorption of NaCl from the gastric lumen into the systemic circulation 1 and 5 min after hypertonic NaCl was lower in both pretreatment groups than in the control. Net gastric transmucosal water flux (from serosa to mucosa) increased (P less than 0.05) from 100 +/- 2 in controls, to 1470 +/- 8 and 715 +/- 9 microliters in rats pretreated with 16,16-dm PGE2 and sodium thiosulfate, respectively. We conclude that 16,16-dm PGE2 and sodium thiosulfate protect the gastric mucosa against hypertonic NaCl, diminish mucosal penetration of NaCl, decrease mucosal absorption of NaCl, and significantly increase serosal to mucosal transmucosal water flux.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Closely spaced strain gauge transducers and a computerized method were used to analyze motor patterns of the duodenum and the adjacent jejunum. Compared with an acaloric meal, nutrients shortened the length of contraction spread in the duodenum from 5.2 +/- 1.0 to 3.8 +/- 0.5-2.8 +/- 0.6 cm and in the jejunum from 10.5 +/- 3.0 to 7.4 +/- 1.3-5.2 +/- 0.8 cm. Additionally, contraction frequency was reduced. Basic differences were found between duodenal and jejunal motility. They were most marked in absence of nutrients. The duodenal motor pattern was characterized by a lower contraction frequency (8.0 +/- 2.2 vs 11.1 +/- 1.8/min), a shorter length of contraction spread (5.2 +/- 1.0 vs 10.5 +/- 3.0 cm), and a higher incidence of stationary contractions (50% vs 34%). On the duodenal bulb 72% of contractions represented contraction waves, whereas in the mid-duodenum the predominant feature was stationary contractions (57%) promoting the mixing of chyme with secretions. The characteristic duodenal motor patterns might be related to special functions of the duodenum for transport and digestion.\r"

Adenosine A2 receptor is stimulatory to adenylate cyclase, whereas adenosine A1 receptor is inhibitory to adenylate cyclase. We investigated the effect of adenosine and its analogs on [14C]aminopyrine accumulation by rabbit parietal cells. Rabbit gastric mucosal cells were isolated by enzyme digestion. Parietal cells were enriched by nonlinear percoll gradients. [14C]Aminopyrine accumulation was used as an indicator of acid secretion. The effect of 2-chloroadenosine on histamine-stimulated [14C]aminopyrine accumulation was studied. The effects of N-ethylcarboxamideadenosine, 2-chloroadenosine, stable analogs of adenosine, and adenosine on [14C]aminopyrine accumulation were assessed. Cyclic AMP content of parietal cells was determined by radioimmunoassay. Histamine and carbachol, known secretagogues, stimulated [14C]aminopyrine accumulation. 2-Chloroadenosine did not suppress histamine-stimulated [14C]aminopyrine accumulation. 2-Chloroadenosine, N-ethylcarboxamideadenosine, and adenosine dose dependently increased [14C]aminopyrine accumulation. The order of potency was N-ethylcarboxamideadenosine greater than 2-chloroadenosine greater than adenosine. 8-Phenyltheophylline and theophylline, adenosine-receptor antagonists, or cimetidine did not have significant effects on the increase of AP uptake induced by 2-chloroadenosine. Coadministration of dipyridamole, and adenosine uptake inhibitor, augmented the effect of adenosine on [14C]aminopyrine accumulation. 2-Chloroadenosine, N-ethylcarboxamideadenosine, and adenosine each induced a significant increase in cellular cyclic AMP. We conclude that there may be adenosine A2 receptors on rabbit parietal cells which modulate gastric acid secretion.\r"

A minority of the refluxes were related with symptoms (4.0% and 7.7% in degree I, 14.1% and 12.0% in degree II at 5 and 10 cm respectively), whereas 65.4% and 100% of the symptoms were related with reflux in degrees I and II, respectively, with 76.5% and 35.7% occurring during refluxes reaching the proximal recording site. A relationship of symptoms with reflux is shown, particularly in erosive disease. Some reflux characteristics (extension, duration, acidity) seem to influence symptom occurrence mainly in mild esophagitis; however, more than 85% of the acid reflux episodes are symptom-free, regardless of the severity of the mucosal injury.\r"

Testing for GER included voice analysis, EGD, esophageal manometry, Bernstein test, and ambulatory 24-hr pH monitoring. Six of the 11 (55%) hoarse patients studied had GER by pH monitoring (mean score 105 +/- 23), and most reflux episodes were supine and prolonged (20.9 +/- 8.2% supine pH less than 4.0, longest 129 min). All patients with abnormal pH monitoring had endoscopic esophagitis (Barrett's esophagus in two, peptic stricture in one, and erosive esophagitis in three), while none of the patients with normal scores had esophagitis. Symptoms of throat pain or nocturnal heartburn were more common in the GER-positive patients (6 of 6 vs 1 of 5), and clinically helpful in discriminating which hoarse patients had pathologic GER. Treatment with ranitidine 150 mg per os twice a day for 12 weeks improved esophagitis in all patients, but the voice improved in only one of the two patients with completely healed esophagitis. This study suggests that (1) GER is frequently seen in patients with idiopathic hoarseness (55%), (2) hoarse patients with throat pain or nocturnal heartburn are likely to have severe esophagitis and should be evaluated by EGD, and (3) additional antireflux and voice therapy may be necessary to heal esophagitis and improve the voice.\r"

The possibility that antiandrogens might potentiate this demasculinization process and in so doing augment the hepatic regenerative response was investigated. Adult male Wistar rats were treated with the antiandrogen flutamide (2 mg/rat/day or 5 mg/rat/day subcutaneously) or vehicle for three days prior to and daily after a 70% partial hepatectomy. At various times after hepatectomy, the liver remnants were removed and weighed. Rates of DNA and polyamine synthesis were assessed by measuring thymidine kinase and ornithine decarboxylase activities, respectively. Hepatic estrogen receptor status and the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase, an androgen-sensitive protein, were measured. Prior to surgery, the administration of 5 mg/day flutamide reduced the hepatic cytosolic androgen receptor activity by 98% and hepatic cytosolic estrogen receptor content by 92% compared to that present in vehicle-treated controls. After hepatectomy, however, all differences in sex hormone receptor activity between the treatment groups were abolished. The rate of liver growth after partial hepatectomy in the three groups was identical. Moreover, hepatectomy-induced increases in ornithine decarboxylase activity and thymidine kinase activity were comparable. These data demonstrate that, although flutamide administration initially alters the sex hormone receptor status of the liver, these affects have no effect on the hepatic regenerative response following a partial hepatectomy.\r"

  ".W": "Several studies in the hamster model were undertaken to investigate known and recently disclosed metabolic interactions between bile acids and lipoproteins, particularly between ursodiol and low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) receptors. Three groups of animals, receiving a control 0.027% cholesterol diet, supplementation with 0.1% ursodiol, or supplementation with 0.1% chenodeoxycholic acid, were treated for four weeks. Both bile acids suppressed bile acid synthesis. Chenodeoxycholic acid significantly increased serum total cholesterol compared to ursodiol, and high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol decreased significantly with chenodeoxycholic acid compared to ursodiol and control. Since the rate of bile acid synthesis is known to influence LDL receptor activity, LDL uptake under these conditions of synthesis suppression was measured. The animals received infusions of hamster LDL and methylated human LDL. Uptake of hamster LDL (occurring by both receptor-dependent and receptor-independent mechanisms) was significantly higher in the ursodiol-treated group than in the others. Human LDL uptake (occurring only by receptor-independent mechanisms) was not significantly affected by either treatment. The mechanisms by which ursodiol apparently directly stimulates the LDL receptor remain speculative but may involve alteration of cell membrane fluidity, change in the rate of LDL receptor cycling, and increase in the number of LDL receptors.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of our research was to develop ursodiol analogs that are structurally modified to modulate hepatic side-chain amidation and prevent 7-dehydroxylation by intestinal bacteria while at the same time maintaining the critical micellar concentration (CMC) and hydrophilicity of ursodiol. More than 20 naturally occurring bile acids were screened for physicochemical properties. Then, two generations of analogs were studied, and those with physicochemical properties similar to ursodiol's were analyzed for physiologic properties. The first generation of analogs included molecules with steric and/or electronic hindrance on the side chain; the second group consisted of the same molecules conjugated with glycine or taurine and also \"pseudoconjugated\" analogs (23-hydroxylated, esterified, and amidated with other amino acids). Of the first-generation analogs, only cyclopropane D derivative and trans-olefin were useful to our purposes, being conjugated by the liver and almost completely recovered in bile. These two analogs were deconjugated and 7-dehydroxylated but with slower kinetics. The hydrophilicity of the molecules could be augmented by increasing the polarity of the steroid ring. Among the pseudoconjugated analogs, the CMC values were similar to those of the natural analogs, although hydrophobicity differed among the group. The analogs that were not deconjugated were not 7-dehydroxylated either. All of the pseudoconjugated bile acids were efficiently taken up by the liver, and their recovery in bile was similar to that of glycine and taurine ursodiol. From these studies we now know that side chain configuration and conformation are important in the conjugation and deconjugation processes. Mild modification of the side chain can prevent 7-dehydroxylation and thus yield a bile acid more resistant to intestinal bacteria and more bioavailable. Prevention of hepatic conjugation improves biliary secretion and recovery of many analogs.\r"

In the selection of patients as candidates for this treatment, stone characteristics and the functional status of the gallbladder are the two most important criteria. Small, primarily cholesterol stones (radiolucent on plain film) are the most suitable for oral dissolution therapy. In addition, a functioning gallbladder (as evidenced by visualization on oral cholecystogram) is required to concentrate the ursodiol-enriched bile and effect stone dissolution. Ursodiol should not be used during pregnancy, in women likely to become pregnant, or in severe acute or chronic intrahepatic cholestasis. Acute cholestasis and common bile duct obstruction also preclude this treatment. Screening tests include basic laboratory tests of liver function, sonographic evaluation of the gallbladder and biliary tree, plain film of the abdomen, and oral cholecystogram. Since few patients meet all the selection criteria ideally, the decision to undertake treatment with ursodiol must be based on the entire clinical profile and on the patient's willingness to accept the predicted likelihood of success.\r"

  ".W": "The intuitive assumption that gallstones will rapidly recur in all patients is clearly incorrect. At least 50% of patients do not develop stones within three to five years of complete dissolution, and the risk may decrease after the first two or three years. This is not so surprising when one considers the complexity of the pathogenic process. Bile must be sufficiently supersaturated with cholesterol, an imbalance in nucleating and antinucleating factors must occur, at least transiently, and, for some patients, a defect in gallbladder emptying may be necessary. Occasionally, pathogenic mechanisms that had been present, eg, estrogens, obesity, or medications such as clofibrate, may no longer be active. The best method to reduce the risk of recurrence is to reverse one or more of the essential pathogenic mechanisms. Desaturating bile in cholesterol by oral therapy with a bile acid such as ursodiol should be effective. A search for other safe, effective, and cost-effective approaches persists, eg, for novel bile acids resistant to bacterial degradation and for various dietary regimens. Alteration of cholesterol nucleation with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents is also under investigation. In addition, enhancement of gallbladder emptying is an interesting approach that is worth studying. If stones do recur, the course of action is not always clear. Recurrent stones are usually \"silent,\" and we do not usually treat asymptomatic stones. These small cholesterol stones are temptingly easy to dissolve, however. At least in those patients whose level of surgical risk would be high if symptoms developed, prophylactic dissolution therapy may be desirable.\r"

At four months, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GTP) and leucine aminopeptidase levels had decreased. SGOT and SGPT levels also decreased significantly. Evaluation of histologic changes has not yet been completed. No significant differences in improvement of liver function tests were found in a comparison with 19 historical controls. We also studied eight patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, treated for more than one and a half years with 600 mg of ursodiol per day. At one month, itching diminished in five patients who had pruritus. ALPase and gamma-GTP levels decreased significantly, and GOT and GPT levels were also reduced. IgM levels did not change, but the titer of antimitochondrial body decreased by half in two patients. Levels of glycoursodeoxycholic acid increased, and in three patients follow-up liver biopsy showed marked improvement.

A significant improvement of liver function tests was observed after four weeks of treatment. Saturation index was significantly decreased from 1.23 +/- 0.1 to 0.7 +/- 0.08 (P less than 0.02); this effect was due to the significant decrease of biliary cholesterol concentration from 6.7 +/- 0.36 to 3.6 +/- 0.37 percent molar (P less than 0.02). A significant decrease of cholesterol output (from 88 +/- 9 to 55 +/- 10 mumol/hr, P less than 0.02) was also observed.

These dosages would be considered high for the use of ursodiol in gallstone dissolution therapy. To investigate the dose-response relationship to ursodiol administration, we planned a few studies in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and chronic hepatitis (CH). Patients with PBC were subdivided into two groups on the basis of their serum bilirubin values, with 2 mg/dl as the dividing line. Ursodiol was given at dosages of 250, 500, and 750 mg/day for consecutive periods of two months, the order of treatment being randomly assigned to each patient. The enrichment with ursodiol of biliary bile acids was similar in both PBC and CH and, within the PBC group, in both anicteric and icteric patients. Highly significant decreases in serum enzyme levels were observed in all groups with the 250 mg/day dose, corresponding to about 4-5 mg/kg/day. The two higher doses induced further improvements in serum enzyme levels, especially in patients with PBC, but no significant differences were found between the 500 and the 750 mg/day doses. The improvements were roughly proportional to the enrichment of conjugated biliary bile acids with ursodiol. Serum bilirubin levels, an important prognostic factor in PBC, were also significantly reduced by ursodiol administration in patients with initial serum levels higher than 2 mg/dl. The present study indicated that ursodiol is a potentially useful drug for chronic liver disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It also assessed the effects of aging and heart failure on glucocorticoid responses to acute and chronic stress. Aging in healthy hamsters increased plasma cortisol levels, decreased corticosterone levels, and did not change total glucocorticoid levels. A similar pattern occurred as cardiomyopathic (CM) hamsters aged, until they developed severe heart failure. Plasma cortisol levels fell in CM hamsters with severe heart failure, and corticosterone levels remained low, so total glucocorticoid levels fell. Adrenocortical function similarly declined in very old healthy hamsters near the ends of their lives. Adrenocortical responses to acute and chronic stress were diminished in old healthy hamsters, and heart failure in CM hamsters also reduced the glucocorticoid responses to chronic stress. However, heart failure greatly enhanced the cortisol and total glucocorticoid responses to acute stress, but not that of corticosterone. These data suggest a number of conclusions. First, aging clearly changes the the ratio of corticosterone to cortisol in hamster plasma without changing total glucocorticoid levels and blunts adrenocortical responses to acute and chronic stress. Second, ill health, in the form of severe heart failure in CM hamsters and very old age in health hamsters, decreases adrenocortical function. At the same time, heart failure greatly enhances cortisol responses to acute stress. These results indicate that aging and chronic disease in hamsters have many similar effects on adrenocortical function, but that disease alone sensitizes them to the effects of acute stress.\r"

  ".W": "The concentrations of ACTH and cortisol both rise in the plasma of fetal lambs during late pregnancy, reflecting maturation of the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and providing the stimulus for parturition. The failure of rising cortisol to suppress plasma ACTH may be due to altered sensitivity of glucocorticoid negative feedback. To examine the possibility that this effect might be mediated through changes in the number of glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in the fetal hypothalamus and pituitary, we measured changes in GR number in these tissues from fetuses at discrete times of pregnancy between day 60 and term (day 145) and from newborn lambs and adult sheep. We also determined the effect of intrafetal ACTH administration in amounts known to produce premature parturition on GR number in fetuses at days 125-130 of gestation. Binding of [1,2,4-N-3H]triamcinolone acetonide to dispersed cell preparations of fetal pituitary and hypothalamus was saturable, temperature dependent, glucocorticoid specific, and of high affinity (2-3 X 10(-9) M). The number of GR in the pituitary always exceeded that in the hypothalamus. In both tissues GR number rose between days 60-70 to highest values on days 100-110, then decreased until day 125. GR number in the pituitary rose again at term, paradoxically at a time of rising endogenous glucocorticoid levels. However, after ACTH administration, there was a significant decrease in GR number in both hypothalamus and pituitary. These results indicate that altered efficacy of glucocorticoid negative feedback in term fetuses is not due to a decrease in pituitary or hypothalamic GR number. The rise in GR number at term and the fall after intrafetal ACTH treatment raises the possibility that mechanisms exist in the fetus allowing normal autoregulation of GR to be overridden at term.\r"

We have examined the ontogeny of glucagon and related peptides in developing rat hypothalamus and have developed a fetal rat hypothalamic cell culture model to study the synthesis and secretion of these peptides in cells of neural origin. Fetal rat hypothalamus (19-21 day gestation) was found to contain glucagon-like immunoreactive (GLI) peptides including glucagon. The relative amounts of two of the GLI peptides (glicentin and oxyntomodulin) increased with development such that adult hypothalamus contained a predominance of these peptides over glucagon. The ratio of GLI peptides to glucagon increased from 2.6 +/- 0.5 in fetus to 46 +/- 11 in adult (P less than 0.001). When fetal rat hypothalamic cells (FRHC) were placed into primary culture for 7 days, the presence of neurons, glial cells, and glucagon-containing cells was detected by immunohistochemical staining. Analysis of proglucagon gene expression in FRHC cultures by Northern blotting demonstrated the presence of a single proglucagon messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript identical in size and sequence to that detected in fetal pancreas and intestine. RNase protection analysis of RNA from FRHC cultures, brainstem, and intestine confirmed that the proglucagon mRNA transcripts present in these three tissues were identical. Analysis of FRHC content of GLI peptides and immunoreactive glucagon demonstrated that peptide levels were not significantly different from those of whole fetal rat hypothalamus, and did not vary significantly throughout 2 weeks in culture. FRHC cultures were found to contain substantial amounts of glucagon after 1 week of culture. Release of the GLI peptides on day 7 of culture was increased 3-fold (P less than 0.001) by treatment of FRHC for 1 h with 5 mM (Bu)2cAMP. Rat hypothalamus therefore appears to undergo unique changes in posttranslational processing of proglucagon during development. Primary cultures of FRHC thus provide a promising in vitro model to study the molecular control of proglucagon biosynthesis and GLI peptide secretion in the brain.\r"

Intracerebroventricular administration of the antimineralocorticoid RU 28318 (10 ng) decreased blood pressure, while the antiglucocorticoid RU 38486 (10 ng) caused an increase, which was slower in onset and of longer duration. The effect of the antimineralocorticoid was maximal at 8 h and had disappeared after 24 h. The antiglucocorticoid had a significant effect 24 and 48 h after injection. Neither antagonist was effective when administered sc at the same dose (10 ng). Intracerebroventricular administration of aldosterone (10 ng) and the selective glucocorticoid agonist RU 28362 (10 ng) increased and decreased blood pressure, respectively. Corticosterone given intracerebroventricularly (10-100 ng) did not affect blood pressure unless the dose was increased to 1 microgram. Two weeks after adrenalectomy a decrease in blood pressure was observed when the rats were given 0.9% saline instead of water to drink. Replacement therapy with corticosterone (12.5-mg steroid pellet, sc) restored blood pressure to the level in the sham-operated controls. The chronically elevated level of circulating corticosterone produced by a 100-mg sc corticosterone pellet increased blood pressure. The 12.5-and 100-mg sc corticosterone pellets resulted in plasma corticosterone levels of approximately 3 and 20 micrograms/100 ml, respectively. Intracerebroventricular administration of the glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid antagonists (10 ng) increased and decreased, respectively, the blood pressure of the adrenalectomized rats receiving corticosterone substitution. From these data we conclude that corticosteroids can affect the central regulation of blood pressure. The mineralo- and glucocorticoids have opposite effects, which differ in onset and duration. The mineralocorticoids increased blood pressure, whereas the glucocorticoid decreased it.\r"

PKC activity was measured by incorporation of 32P from [gamma 32P]ATP into histone in the presence of cytosolic and detergent-solubilized membrane fractions purified by diethylaminoethyl cellulose chromatography. Basal PKC activity was higher in cytosol than in membranes (1,000 +/- 57 and 413 +/- 14 pmol P incorporated/mg.min, respectively). After incubation of the cells with AII for 5, 15, 30, and 60 min, PKC activity in the cytosol decreased by 5, 18, 25, and 27%, respectively, while in the membrane there was a transient increase of 15% at 15 min returning to basal by 60 min. Incubation of the cells with 100 nM 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) resulted in transient translocation of PKC activity to the membrane (15 min) which was followed by a 64% decrease in total cellular enzyme activity after 3 h. In PKC-depleted cells, the aldosterone response to ACTH was increased by 25% but AII-stimulated steroidogenesis was unchanged. In contrast, in cells in which PKC was translocated to the membrane by a 15 min preincubation with TPA, aldosterone response to AII was enhanced by 40%, while the response to ACTH was reduced by 30%; under these conditions membrane PKC levels rapidly returned to basal. However, the changes in aldosterone response were still evident when addition of AII or ACTH was delayed for up to 30 min after removal of TPA, indicating a persistent modification in the cell membrane secondary to PKC activation. Aldosterone responses to potassium were not altered by preincubation of the cells with TPA. The inactive phorbol ester analog, 4 alpha-hydroxyphorbol-12,13-dibutyrate, had no effect on the steroid responses to either stimulus. The small but significant translocation of PKC activity from cytosol to membrane after treatment of rat adrenal glomerulosa cells with AII suggests that AII activates PKC. However, the fact that aldosterone responses to AII are potentiated during TPA-induced PKC translocation to the membrane suggests that AII and phorbol esters do not share the same mechanism of action in the regulation of steroidogenesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A1 inhibitory adenosine receptors are present in cultured Sertoli cells. Activation of these receptors by short term exposure to adenosine agonists attenuates the adenylate cyclase activity and reduces FSH stimulation of androgen aromatization to estrogen. In the present study it was investigated how long term activation of the adenosine inhibitory system affects the responsiveness of the Sertoli cell. Sertoli cells from 15- to 17-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were incubated with medium containing adenosine deaminase (1 IU/ml) in the presence or absence of 100 nM N6-2-phenyl-isopropyl-adenosine (PIA) for 24-48 h. At the end of this pretreatment medium was changed, and cell responsiveness was measured in terms of cAMP and estrogen production. In control cells, FSH-stimulated cAMP and estradiol production were inhibited by PIA, with an EC50 of 0.70 +/- 0.13 nM. This inhibitory effect was reduced in cells that had been pretreated for 24-48 h with 100 nM PIA. The PIA concentration-response curve of pretreated cells was shifted to the right, with a 4-fold increase in the EC50. Similar effects were also evident when adenosine itself or nonmetabolizable adenosine analogs other than PIA were used in the pretreatment. In addition to these changes in the inhibitory responses, PIA pretreatment increased the response of the Sertoli cell to FSH and forskolin in terms of both cAMP accumulation and estradiol production. Potentiation of the hormonal response was due to an increase in basal and maximal stimulation without significant changes in the total stimulation. This effect was dependent on the concentration of PIA used during the pretreatment. The increase in estradiol production was also evident when cells were stimulated with (Bu)2cAMP, suggesting that adenosine analog pretreatment affects steps distal to cAMP accumulation. Moreover, the responses to both the PIA inhibitory signal and FSH stimulation were restored to control levels when pretreated cells were incubated in fresh medium in the absence of PIA for 24 h. The long term PIA effects were also blocked by pretreatment in the presence of the A1 receptor antagonist 8-[4-([([ (2-amino-ethyl)amino]carbonyl)methyl]oxy)phenyl]1,3- dipropylxanthine. These results indicate that the A1 adenosine system present in the Sertoli cell becomes refractory after prolonged exposure to adenosine analogs. Furthermore, PIA pretreatment produced a potentiation of the Sertoli cell response to stimulatory signals by affecting several steps of the cAMP-dependent pathway.\r"

  ".W": "An estrogen-responsive uterine proenzyme of a proteinase in the immature rat uterus has been known for some time. Its mol wt is 77,000, its N-terminal amino acid sequence is the same as prothrombin's for 15 residues, it contains gamma-carboxyl glutamate residues, its biosynthesis is prevented by warfarin, it cross-reacts with antibodies to human and rat prothrombin, and it can be activated by human factor Xa or a uterine procoagulant. The products of activation, when separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-gels, react with antibodies to human or rat prothrombin to give bands that have mol wt corresponding to those of the products of activation of prothrombin. These activation intermediates hydrolyze synthetic substrates specific for thrombin and have the same mol wt as the activation products of prothrombin. The proteinase generated in the activation has the following properties of thrombin: it is inhibited by hirudin and PheProArg-chloromethyl ketone, it has kinetic constants similar to those of thrombin with tripeptide p-nitroanilides as substrates, and it digests actin to give the same peptides as thrombin. We conclude that the uterine proenzyme is prothrombin. The time course of the prothrombin response to estrogen suggests that prothrombin enters the uterus as part of the transudation of plasma proteins that occurs after estrogen stimulation. A membrane-bound uterine procoagulant that activates uterine prothrombin also increases in response to estrogen stimulation. We propose that the simultaneous increase in these two activities results in a localized generation of thrombin, a well characterized mitogen in fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Our results suggest that thrombin may have a vital function as a mitogen in the early steps of the estrogen-stimulated hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the immature uterus.\r"

  ".W": "An estrogen-responsive procoagulant activity is present in the plasma membrane fraction of immature rat uterus. This procoagulant has many of the properties of tissue factor, a widely occurring, integral membrane protein which initiates the intrinsic pathway of coagulation. Procoagulant activity was demonstrated to activate prothrombin in rat uterus, to activate human coagulation factor X, and to cause clot formation by human plasma. Procoagulant activity could be solubilized from the plasma membrane by the detergent octyl glucoside and had an apparent mol wt of 20,000-40,000 by gel filtration. Procoagulant activity was increased 4-fold within 3 h after immature rats were injected with estradiol. The increase was tissue- and hormone specific and was not affected by a warfarin-induced vitamin K deficiency. Coagulation factor VII was required for clot formation by the procoagulant. These properties are consistent with identification of the procoagulant as tissue factor. mRNA for tissue factor was increased in the uterus 3 h after estrogen stimulation. In the preceding paper we showed that prothrombin is increased in the immature uterus within 3 h of estrogen stimulation. The presence of increased amounts of a tissue factor-like procoagulant in the same time period suggests a functional relationship between these two proteins and a possible role for both in uterine development. Thrombin is a growth factor in fibroblasts and endothelial cells. We propose that after estrogen stimulation, prothrombin enters the uterus with the influx of plasma proteins and is activated by the procoagulant to thrombin. We suggest that thrombin might act as a paracrine factor early in the estrogen-stimulated development of the uterus.\r"

  ".U": "90091944\r", 
  ".W": "It is well known that the estrogen-induced LH surge in ovariectomized (ovx) rats is invariably far less in magnitude than the preovulatory LH surge or that induced by progesterone (P) in estrogen-primed ovx rats. Recent studies show that a decrease in hypothalamic inhibitory opioid tone by the neural clock (NC) is responsible for the induction of the preovulatory LH surge on proestrus. Therefore, we hypothesized that the diminished LH response in estrogen-treated ovx rats may be due to an inadequate reduction in opioid tone. To test this hypothesis the effects of transiently decreasing the opioid tone with an opiate receptor antagonist, naloxone (NAL), on LH secretion in estrogen-primed, short term (5 days) and long term (4 weeks) ovx rats were examined. NAL (2 mg/h) was infused iv from 1100-1400 h on day 2 in rats receiving either sc implants (two, 15 mm each) filled with 17 beta-estradiol (300 micrograms/ml in oil) or sc estradiol benzoate (EB; 10 micrograms/rat) injections at 1000 h on day 0. For comparison of NAL- and P-induced LH responses, EB-primed short and long term ovx rats received P injection (2 mg/rat, sc) instead of NAL infusion at 1100 h. Estrogen treatment alone induced a spontaneous rise in plasma LH on the afternoon of day 2, with peak LH levels ranging between 1.5-2.4 ng/ml. NAL infusion markedly enhanced the LH surge in both groups of ovx rats. In short term ovx rats NAL-induced peak LH levels (5-6 ng/ml) were less than those observed in rats receiving supplemental P treatment or that observed previously on proestrus (10-15 ng/ml). However, in long term EB-primed ovx rats, NAL infusion evoked LH surges equivalent to those observed after P injection. In addition, analysis of the episodic LH secretion pattern showed that NAL infusion accelerated the frequency and amplitude of LH discharge and significantly changed the contour of LH episodes. These results show that a transient decrease in inhibitory opioid tone before a spontaneous LH rise in estrogen-treated ovx rats can accelerate episodic LH secretion to culminate in LH surges that resemble those induced by P and the preovulatory LH surge. Therefore, these observations are in accord with the view that the NC-induced curtailment in the inhibitory opioid tone may be inadequate in estrogen-treated rats; NAL infusion and P treatment intensify decrements in inhibitory opioid tone to reinstate the preovulatory-type LH surge in these rats.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effect of 5,5'-diphenylhydantoin (phenytoin, DPH) on the metabolism of thyroid hormones, the intracellular concentration of T4, and the source and concentration of T3. Two groups of six male Wistar rats received a continuous infusion of 10 ml saline/rat. day. One group received DPH in their food (50 mg/kg BW) for 20 days. For both groups [125I]T4 and [131I]T3 were added to the infusion fluid for the last 10 and 7 days, respectively. At isotopic equilibrium the rats were bled and perfused. Compared to the controls, plasma T4 and T3 in the DPH group were reduced (22% and 31%, respectively); TSH did not change. The rate of production of T4 and the plasma appearance rate for T3 were decreased. Thyroidal T3 production was markedly reduced. From the increased [125I]T3/[125I]T4 ratio for plasma, it follows that total body conversion was enhanced. The tissue T4 concentrations decreased in parallel with the plasma T4 level. Total T3 was reduced in all organs. In tissues in which local conversion does not occur, i.e. heart and muscle, the decrease reflected the decrease in plasma T3. In the liver both plasma-derived T3 and locally produced T3 were diminished. In cerebellum and brain the plasma-derived T3 pool was even smaller than was expected from the decrease in plasma T3. This was partly compensated by an increase in local conversion. Only for these two organs was the decrease in the tissue/plasma ratio for [131I]T3 significant. Our results suggest tissue hypothyroidism, caused by a decrease in the production of T4 and T3, which is partly compensated by increased conversion in several organs. The transport of T3 into cerebellum and brain is disturbed, which can be attributed to the mode of action of DPH.\r"

Standard preparations of the subunits of hCG purified from pregnancy urine were found to exhibit heterogeneity on reverse phase HPLC chromatography, complicating efforts to characterize such forms of hCG. The same type of chromatographic heterogeneity was observed when the hormone was reduced and S-carboxymethylated (RCM) and its RCM subunits separated on HPLC. One major and one minor peak were observed in the alpha- and beta-subunits from both native and RCM hormone, with a ratio of between 5:1 and 10:1. Development and application of a high resolution, semimicrobore HPLC fingerprint technique used together with an examination of selected peptides by amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry defined the differences between these forms as oxidation. Using each of the isolated RCM subunit's major and minor HPLC peaks, the oxidation was shown to be reversible and probably due to interconversion of methionine with its sulfoxide form.\r"

To investigate whether these receptors are subjected to autologous regulation by thyroid hormones, the effect of T4 on the binding capacity (Bmax), dissociation constant (Kd), and receptor occupancy were followed in intact rat pups at various ages. Hyperthyroidism (by daily injection of T4 0.1 micrograms/g body wt to intact pups starting 4 days before death at 5, 10, 15, and 20 days of age) increased while hypothyroidism (by propylthiouracil feeding) decreased the total T3 binding capacity during preweaning ages (mean maximal binding capacities as estimated by Scatchard analysis, at 30 C for 14-20 days old eu-, hyper-, and hypothyroid pups: 186, 229, and 129 fmol/mg non-histone protein (NHP). The thyroid conditions also affected the percentage of T3 receptor occupancy but not the affinity of binding (as measured by Kd). Concomitantly, these conditions also caused corresponding changes in pancreatic weights, DNA and protein contents, and the concentrations of amylase, trypsinogen, and lipase. The postnatal developmental retardation induced by 6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil treatment was reversed by T4 replacement. The results suggest that rat pancreatic T3 nuclear receptors during postnatal ages are modulated by T4, and such modulation apparently in turn affects the development of the exocrine enzymes.\r"

Incorporation of [3H] proline into collagenase-digestible protein (CDP) and noncollagen protein (NCP), and percent collagen synthesis (PCS) were measured in both systems. Incorporation of [3H]thymidine and cAMP production were measured in fetal rat calvariae. Production of prostaglandin E2 and I2 and bone resorption, as assessed by release of previously incorporated 45Ca, were measured in mouse parietal bones. The effects of PTHrP and PTH were qualitatively similar. At 96 h CDP in rat calvariae was decreased by PTH at a concentration as low as 0.01 nM, while similar effects were seen with PTHrP at 0.1 nM. Effects on NCP were small, so PCS was reduced. At 24 h [3H]thymidine was not altered, but CDP and PCS were decreased by both PTH and PTHrP. cAMP production was increased in fetal rat calvariae at 30 min. Both PTH and PTHrP increased 45Ca release at low concentrations and prostaglandin production at high concentrations in mouse parietal bones. While PTH was about 10-fold more potent than PTHrP, there was no qualitative difference in the responses. These studies further suggest that PTHrP affects bone through the PTH receptor.\r"

  ".W": "The release of preaccumulated tritium-labeled dopamine [( 3H]DA) was examined in isolated nerve terminals (synaptosomes) prepared from the median eminence (ME) and corpus striatum (CS) of young (2-3 months), middle-aged (11-12 months), and old (19-21 months) male rats. Fractional release of [3H]DA was measured over 1- to 10-sec time intervals under basal (5 mM K+) and depolarizing (75 mM K+) conditions in the presence of calcium. No differences in the rate of basal efflux between the age groups were observed in either ME or CS preparations. Fast-phase evoked [3H]DA release (0-1 sec) from CS synaptosomes was unchanged from young to middle-aged, but was decreased in old preparations. These data demonstrate that the nigrostriatal nerve terminal has a diminished ability to respond fully to depolarizing stimuli in advanced age. Mean serum PRL levels in old rats were 2.3-fold greater than those in both young and middle-aged rats, while serum LH levels were decreased 2.0-fold in middle-aged and old compared with those in young rats. The fact that LH levels were already decreased in middle-aged rats while PRL levels had not yet increased suggests that decreased gonadotropin titers in old rats do not result from the coincident hyperprolactinemia. In ME synaptosomes, depolarization-induced [3H]DA release was decreased at all time points in middle-aged preparations compared to that in young preparations. The reduced fractional release from the middle-aged ME synaptosomes was due to a depressed rate of release during the initial second of depolarization. Evoked release from ME terminals of old rats was comparable to that measured in the young group. Thus, there occurred an age-related biphasic change in the initial rate of evoked DA release from ME synaptosomes. Diminished response of ME dopaminergic terminals to depolarizing stimuli during middle age may be important in the later development of hyperprolactinemia in aging male rats. The increased PRL available for feedback on the tuberoinfundlbular dopaminergic neurons may, in turn, be associated with the apparent recovery of evoked [3H]DA release from ME synaptosomes of old rats.\r"

We have, therefore, developed an in vitro model of hormone action based upon examining the effects of sex steroids on SV-40-transformed fetal rat hypothalamic cell lines. Using serum-free growth factor-deficient conditions the effects of 17 alpha- and 17 beta-estradiol, testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and tamoxifen on survival of two estrogen-binding rat hypothalamic cell lines were examined. In one cell line, RCF-8, both 17 beta-estradiol and testosterone increased survival at picomolar concentrations. This effect was blocked by tamoxifen, but could not be reproduced by the nonaromatizable androgen DHT or the inactive isomer 17 alpha-estradiol. In the other cell line, RCA-6, addition of 17 beta-estradiol led to inhibition of cellular proliferation, which was reversed by the addition of tamoxifen. In an estrogen receptor-negative hypothalamic cell line, RCF-12, estradiol had no net effect on the growth pattern. In summary, the estrogen-binding capacity and the responsiveness to physiological concentrations of estradiol and testosterone, but not DHT, make the RCF-8 cell line a potential in vitro model of hypothalamic sexual differentiation. The use of estrogen-sensitive hypothalamic cell lines provides a unique opportunity for studying the cellular mechanisms underlying this process.\r"

Basal and forskolin-, guanylylimidodiphosphate- and isoproterenol-stimulated cyclase activities were decreased by 30-40% after castration and restored to control values after testosterone treatment. In addition, Mn2+ + forskolin-stimulated activity in the presence or absence of GDP beta S was lower (-30%) after castration and normalized after testosterone treatment. Finally, the effects of testosterone described above were completely abolished when the potent androgen receptor antagonist RU 23908 was administered together with testosterone. These results indicate that both the inhibitory and stimulatory responses of adenylate cyclase are promoted by testosterone through an androgen receptor-dependent mechanism; promotion of the inhibitory response concerns specifically the alpha 2-receptor-mediated pathway, whereas promotion of the stimulatory response appears unspecific and mainly due to increased activity of the cyclase catalytic subunit.\r"

This study examined the role of progesterone in maintaining elevated PRL release during the plateau phase and its effect on dopaminergic (DA) neuronal activity. Immature rats were injected with PMSG on day 28, and blood was collected during the periovulatory period. Plasma estradiol levels were elevated before and during the PRL peak and declined during the plateau. Plasma progesterone levels were low before and during the peak, rose 4- to 5-fold during the plateau, and decreased to basal levels at the termination phase. In a second experiment rats were subjected to acute ovariectomy (OVEX) or sham surgery (SHAM) just before the onset of the PRL surge. Some OVEX rats were either immediately implanted with an estradiol-containing capsule or given three injections of progesterone during the time of the plateau phase. Blood PRL levels in SHAM rats showed the typical peak, plateau, and termination phases. The PRL peak was evident, but the plateau was missing in OVEX rats with or without estradiol treatment. Replacement with progesterone restored the plateau. In a third experiment, the stalk-median eminence, posterior pituitary, and striatum were removed during the time of the midplateau phase. Tyrosine hydroxylase activity was determined in tissue homogenates by a coupled hydroxylation-decarboxylation assay. Tyrosine hydroxylase activity in the stalk-median eminence of SHAM and progesterone-treated OVEX rats was similar, but was significantly lower than that in OVEX rats with or without estradiol. Tyrosine hydroxylase activity in the posterior pituitary and striatum was unchanged. To assess the functional DA input to the anterior pituitary, haloperidol, a DA antagonist, was injected during the midplateau phase. It induced a 12- to 17-fold rise in plasma PRL in both untreated and estradiol-treated OVEX rats, but failed to increase PRL above the plateau levels in SHAM and progesterone-treated OVEX rats. We conclude that the plateau phase of the preovulatory PRL surge is dependent on the concomitant rise in progesterone. Progesterone probably acts by reducing the DA neuronal activity in the SME, resulting in an absence of functional DA input to anterior pituitary lactotrophs.\r"

The effect of IGF-I on cAMP production by cells stimulated with ACTH or forskolin was also examined. IGF-I inhibited ACTH-, forskolin-, and (Bu)2cAMP-induced corticosterone production in a concentration-dependent manner. IGF-I (30 ng/ml) also significantly inhibited ACTH-induced cAMP production. However, the peptide had no significant effect on forskolin-induced cAMP production. IGF-I suppressed ACTH-induced cAMP production both in the presence and absence of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, suggesting that IGF-I acts to inhibit the formation of cAMP rather than the stimulation of cAMP degradation. The observation that IGF-I inhibited steroidogenesis induced by (Bu)2cAMP strongly suggests that one site of inhibition is at some step(s) distal to cAMP formation. However, the inhibition of cAMP production after stimulation with ACTH also suggests a plasma membrane site of action for IGF-I in adrenocortical cells.\r"

  ".W": "In female rats the mating stimulus induces a bimodal pattern of PRL secretion. A surge of PRL occurs at approximately 0300 h, called the nocturnal surge (N). Another surge occurs at 1700 h on the same day, called the diurnal surge (D). By lowering dopaminergic tone pharmacologically, we have recently demonstrated the existence of an endogenous rhythm stimulatory to PRL secretion in female rats. The periods of this stimulatory influence coincide with the periods of the N and D surges of PRL that occur in mated rats. In addition, we have shown that the 0300 h component of this endogenous rhythm is regulated by oxytocin (OT) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and the 1700 h component is regulated by OT and serotonin (5-HT). In this study, we investigated the roles of OT, VIP, and 5-HT in controlling the N and D surges of PRL in ovariectomized (OVX) rats receiving a physiological dopamine-lowering stimulus, copulomimetic stimulation. Blood samples were obtained the day before the experiments between 1700 and 1900 h to verify that the rats used were having surges of PRL in response to cervical stimulation (CS). The role of OT was studied by infusing the OT antagonist 1-deamino-2-D-Trp4-Val8-Orn-OT (OT-A; 0.5 micrograms/kg.min) beginning at either 0100 or 1500 h and continuing for 5 h on day 2 after the last CS. Serial blood samples were obtained immediately before infusion and 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240, and 300 min after the start of infusion. The samples overlapped either the N or D surge of PRL. All rats used in these studies demonstrated D surges of PRL the day before the experiment. Saline infusion had no effect on either the N or D surge of PRL in OVX-CS rats. However, infusion of OT-A completely blocked both the N and D surges of PRL. The role of VIP was studied by infusing the VIP antagonist [4-D-Cl-Phe6-Leu17]VIP (VIP-A; 01 micrograms/kg.min) beginning at either 0100 or 1500 h and continuing for 5 h. VIP-A completely blocked both the N and D surges of PRL. To study the role of 5-HT, rats received an acute treatment with p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA; 250 mg/kg, sc) at either 0100 or 1500 h, and blood samples were taken as before. PCPA had no effect on the N surge of PRL.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Immunohistochemistry was performed in the adult rat GIT with a panel of characterized monoclonal antibodies to the GH receptor. The most intense and heterogeneous immunoreactivity was observed in epithelial cell subpopulations of GIT mucosa. Mesenchymal elements of the GIT were homogenously and moderately immunoreactive. Intense immunoreactivity was observed in the ductal epithelium of the sublingual gland, scattered basal epidermal cells of the esophageal mucosa, zymogen cells of the gastric glands, scattered surface epithelial cells of the stomach, and scattered peripheral pancreatic acinar groups. Scattered enteroendocrine cells and parietal cells, crypt and villous columnar cells of the small intestine, surface columnar cells of the cecum/colon, crypt base columnar cells of the colon, and contiguous peripheral cords of pancreatic islet cells displayed strong immunoreactivity. No immunoreactivity was detectable in the mucous and serous acini of the sublingual and submandibular gland, respectively, mucous-secreting cells of the base of the cardiac and pyloric glands, surface epithelial cells of the fundus, paneth cells, goblet cells of cecum/colon, or mucous cells at the base of the cecal crypt. Other elements of the GIT were moderately or weakly immunoreactive. In support of our localization we can detect high affinity binding (Ka = 3 x 10(9] of [125I]human GH with ovine GH as displacing ligand to crude homogenates of adult rat stomach and intestine. We conclude that discrete epithelial cell subpopulations of the GIT and its derivatives are directly responsive to GH action. GH may, therefore, act independently of or synergistically with hepatic insulin-like growth factor-I in executing its physiological and/or growth-promoting role in the GIT.\r"

In the search for specific markers for each of the three types of binders (glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors and the transcortin-like intracellular binder), we have found that a conjugated steroid, cortisol-21-sulfate, binds preferentially to the transcortin-like binder, but not to the two receptors. Using this steroid, in combination with the pure synthetic glucocorticoid RU 28362, we were able to clearly discriminate between the three types of corticosteroid binders in bovine aorta.\r"

The present study was undertaken to investigate the role of hypo- and hyperthyroidism on the GH receptor. Seven-week-old rats were rendered either hypothyroid, by methimazole, or hyperthyroid, by a daily overdose of T4, during weeks 7-14 of life. Livers were homogenized and overlaid on sucrose discontinuous density gradient. Removal of endogenous ligand from the receptor was performed by exposing the membranes to MgCl2. hGH was used with excess ovine PRL to characterize somatogenic specific binding. Lactogenic specific binding was calculated by subtracting somatogenic specific binding from the total specific binding. Creatine kinase was also measured in homogenized livers. Liver membranes of the hypothyroid rats showed a significant decline in somatogenic and lactogenic binding of hGH. This was true for both the free unoccupied binding sites and total binding after dissociation of the endogenous ligand. Replacement of T4 for 2 weeks restored hGH binding to control values. Hyperthyroid rats had high somatogenic and lactogenic hGH binding. Creatine kinase activity decreased significantly in liver homogenates of hypothyroid rats, was restored by T4 replacement, and increased significantly in hyperthyroid rats. Thus, lactogenic and somatogenic receptors are directly related to the thyroid status in vivo.\r"

  ".U": "90091968\r", 
  ".W": "Substance P-like immunoreactivity (SP-LI) is present in the rat anterior pituitary (AP) and in hypothalamic neurons that may be involved in the control of AP secretion and/or reproductive function. The presence of multiple SP-encoding mRNAs and tachykinin peptides and their regulation by steroid hormones were examined in APs and hypothalami from normal, gonadectomized, and steroid-treated male and female rats. SP-encoding mRNAs were identified by nuclease protection assays of RNA, and tachykinin peptides were identified by combined HPLC-RIA of tissue extracts, beta- and gamma-preprotachykinin (PPT) mRNAs and SP, neurokinin A, and neuropeptide gamma peptides were identified in the AP. The alpha-, beta-, and gamma-PPT mRNAs and SP, neurokinin A, neuropeptide gamma, neuropeptide K, and neurokinin B peptides were present in hypothalamic tissue. Previous studies have established that in the AP, SP is differentially regulated by gonadal steroids; estrogen decreases and androgen increases AP SP. Steroid effects were further analyzed in experiments using RIAs to measure SP levels in the AP and median eminence (ME) of steroid- and oil-treated gonadectomized rats. To assess whether steroids alter steady state PPT mRNA levels and presumably SP synthesis in these tissues, potential effects on AP and hypothalamic SP-encoding mRNAs were determined. Ovariectomized rats treated for 10 days with estradiol benzoate showed a 50% decrease in AP SP and a 90% decrease in AP beta- and gamma-PPT mRNAs compared to ovariectomized oil-treated controls. Estradiol benzoate replacement had no effect on SP levels in the isolated ME, but did cause a 50% increase in alpha-, beta-, and gamma PPT mRNAs in the hypothalamus. Although there was no significant effect of testosterone propionate on AP SP levels in castrated males, 10 days of testosterone propionate replacement did cause a significant increase in beta- and gamma PPT mRNAs in the AP. No androgen effects were seen on either ME SP or hypothalamic SP-encoding mRNAs. These data demonstrate that estrogen up-regulates SP-encoding mRNAs in the hypothalamus, whereas it down-regulates SP-encoding mRNAs in the pituitary. These results implicate SP and other tachykinins derived from the SP gene as steroid-regulated modulators of AP secretion and possibly reproductive function.\r"

Thus, an investigation was made to identify such a protein in the fetal genital tract and to test whether this protein can produce masculinization in vitro. Fetal tracts (15/batch) containing genital ducts and urogenital sinus from male, female, and testosterone-exposed (40 mg/kg.day, from days 13-17 of gestation) female embryonic mice on day 18 of gestation were fractionated using Bio-Rad P-100 gel filtration, DEAE-cellulose, and carboxymethyl-Sephadex chromatography. Phospholipase-A2 (PLA2) stimulatory activity was identified at every step of purification. The final preparation stimulated both bee venom and mouse genital PLA2; however, it had no effect on PLC. The preparation lost its PLA2 stimulatory activity after pronase treatment. The partially purified PLSP fraction produced two bands (63K and 55K), as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, and its PLA2 stimulatory activity appeared at the region of 55K on a P-100 gel filtration column. PLSP was also identified in female and testosterone-exposed female genital tracts. However, the specific activity of the female PLSP was much lower than that of the male or testosterone-exposed females. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel analysis of 2-3 micrograms partially purified PLSP revealed the presence of a faint 55K band in the females compared to the presence of a darker 55K band in the male and testosterone-exposed female. The intensity of the 63K band was similar in both sexes. PLSP from the male and testosterone-exposed females maintained and stimulated the Wolffian duct, whereas PLSP from the female tract had no masculinizing effect. Thus, the masculinizing activity of the PLSP preparation appears to correlate with its PLA2 stimulatory activity and 55K band intensity, suggesting the role of PLA2 stimulatory protein in masculine differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "The rat ovary is innervated by sympathetic nerve fibers. Since the development and survival of peripheral sympathetic neurons innervating nonreproductive organs have been shown to depend on the production of nerve growth factor (NGF) by the innervated tissues, the present experiments were undertaken to determine if the immature rat ovary has the capability of synthesizing NGF. Blot hybridization of ovarian polyadenylated RNA (A+-RNA) to a NGF cRNA probe revealed the presence of a 1.3- to 1.4-kilobase (kb) mRNA species similar to mature NGF mRNA detected in mouse submaxillary gland, a source rich in NGF. Quantitation of NGF protein by a sensitive and specific two-site enzyme immunoassay demonstrated the presence of NGF in juvenile ovaries at levels comparable to those found in other sympathetically innervated tissues. Neither denervation of the ovary nor treatment with gonadotropins (hCG and FSH) or somatomammotropins (PRL and GH) affected the levels of NGF mRNA. However, denervation significantly increased NGF levels, suggesting that, as in other target tissues, denervation prevents the retrograde transport of NGF by the sympathetic terminals and leads to accumulation of the protein at its site of production. It is concluded that 1) the developing ovary is able to both transcribe the NGF gene and translate its mRNA into NGF protein; and 2) the NGF content in the ovary is regulated by its innervation. The results provide the biochemical basis for the concept, elaborated in the companion paper, that NGF through its trophic actions on ovarian sympathetic neurons contributes to the regulation of ovarian development and, hence, to the acquisition of female reproductive capacity.\r"

  ".W": "The ovary is innervated by noradrenergic and peptidergic fibers. Treatment of neonatal rats with antibodies to nerve growth factor (NGF Ab) resulted in failure of the sympathetic (noradrenergic and neuropeptide-Y) nerves to develop. Partial loss of sensory innervation, represented by calcitonin gene-related peptide fibers, was also observed. Follicular growth was stunted, and production of androgens and estradiol was reduced. The timing of first ovulation was delayed, estrous cyclicity was disrupted, and fertility was compromised. Plasma LH levels were elevated, and LH pulsatility was enhanced, suggesting primary ovarian failure. A normal appearance of tyrosine hydroxylase-, LHRH-, and neuropeptide-Y-immunoreactive neurons in the hypothalamus, as determined by immunocytochemistry, suggested that neonatal immunosympathectomy did not directly affect hypothalamic reproductive function. In vitro release of LHRH from median eminence nerve terminals in response to prostaglandin E2 was, however, reduced in NGF Ab-treated rats. Normalization of the response by prior in vivo exposure of the animals to physiological estradiol levels, suggested that the diminished LHRH output was due at least in part to estrogen deficiency. Although ovarian dysfunction induced by immunosympathectomy may be related to alterations in vascular tone, the striking loss of perifollicular noradrenergic innervation caused by NGF Ab suggests that the absence of the nonvascular norepinephrine stimulus to follicular steroidogenesis is a primary factor responsible for the alterations observed. The results indicate that development of the sympathetic innervation of the ovary is NGF dependent and that NGF, by supporting the differentiation and survival of the innervating neurons, contributes to the acquisition of mature ovarian function.\r"

  ".W": "hCG is a member of a family of glycoprotein hormones which share a common alpha-subunit, but differ in their hormone-specific beta-subunits. The CG beta-subunit is unique in that it contains a hydrophilic carboxyl-terminal extension with four serine O-linked oligosaccharides. To examine the role of the O-linked oligosaccharides and the carboxyl-terminal extension of hCG beta on receptor binding, steroidogenesis in vitro, and ovulation induction in vivo, site-directed mutagenesis and gene transfer methods were used. Wild-type hCG alpha and hCG beta expression vectors were transfected into an O-glycosylation mutant Chinese hamster ovary cell line to produce intact dimer hCG lacking the beta-subunit O-linked oligosaccharide units. In addition, a mutant hCG beta gene (CG beta delta T) was generated which contained a premature termination signal at codon 115. This gene was cotransfected with the hCG alpha gene into Chinese hamster ovary cells to produce hCG dimer which lacked the carboxyl-terminal amino acids 115-145 of hCG beta (truncated hCG). The O-linked oligosaccharide deficient or truncated hCG derivatives were examined for their ability to bind to the mouse LH/hCG receptor and stimulate cAMP and steroidogenesis in vitro. These studies show that the O-linked oligosaccharides and carboxyl-terminal extension play a minor role in receptor binding and signal transduction. In contrast, comparison of the stimulatory effects of truncated and wild-type hCG in a rat ovulation assay in vivo via either intrabursal or iv injection revealed that the truncated derivative was approximately 3-fold less active than wild-type hCG. These findings indicate that the carboxyl-terminal extension of hCG beta and associated O-linked oligosaccharides are not important for receptor binding or in vitro signal transduction, but are critical for in vivo biological responses.\r"

  ".W": "The rate-limiting event for combination of hCG alpha- and beta-subunits in JAR choriocarcinoma cells is the rate of disulfide bond formation in the beta-subunit. This is accompanied by a conformational change that produces a combination-competent form of the beta-subunit. The combination reaction, however, is incomplete, and 50% of the synthesized beta molecules remain uncombined (free). In addition, 70% of biosynthetically labeled free beta is degraded in the cell. Possible explanations for incomplete dimer formation include 1) biochemical differences between the free and combined beta-subunits that limit combination of free beta, and 2) an inefficient combination reaction due to low intersubunit affinities or limiting concentrations of combination-competent subunits within the cell. To examine whether the biochemical differences between free and combined beta-subunits that we have previously observed affect the combined beta-subunits that we have previously observed affect the combination competence of free beta, free and dimer beta-subunits were purified from the culture medium and lysates of JAR cells and examined for their ability to combine with alpha purified from pregnancy urine in an in vitro combination assay. Secreted free and dimer beta obtained from culture medium combined to the same extent with urinary alpha. Although the combination efficiencies were lower for the intracellular forms, the free and dimer beta-subunits purified from cell lysates also combined to the same extent with urinary alpha. Thus, biochemical differences that exist between the beta forms do not prevent combination of free beta with alpha in an in vitro combination assay. To examine the second possibility, we speculated that if high concentrations of hCG subunits remained in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for extended periods of time, the extent of dimer formation would increase in the cell. To increase the residence time of hCG subunits in the ER, JAR cells were treated with carbonyl cyanide trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, an agent that inhibits the translocation of hCG subunits from the ER to the Golgi. Treatment of cells with trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone in long and short term pulse-chase labeling studies did not result in an increase in the extent of dimer formation. Thus, the subunit combination reaction in JAR cells may be incomplete due to subtle conformational differences in the free beta-subunit; however, these differences do not inhibit the combination of the free beta-subunit in vitro.\r"

Unlabeled IGF-I displaced 125I-IGF-I with high affinity at Mr 260,000 and 130,000 and with lower affinity at Mr 240,000. Unlabeled IGF-II preferentially displaced either radioactive ligand at Mr 240,000, but at high concentrations displaced 125I-IGF-I at all binding sites. Furthermore, mannose-6-phosphate enhanced binding by both 125I-IGF-I and 125I-IGF-II at Mr 240,000, and antibody to the rat IGF-II receptor prevented binding only at this location. The relative affinities of IGF-I and IGF-II for the primary IGF-I receptor correlate with their anabolic activities in bone cultures and suggest that the IGF-I receptor mediates the growth-promoting effects of both agents in bone.\r"

  ".W": "In the present manuscript we demonstrate that ectocervical epithelial cells (ECE cells) retain a high degree of differentiated function when cultured using feeder layers. We characterize the cultured cells with respect to morphology, expression of cytokeratins, responsiveness to sex steroids, and the presence of estrogen-binding sites. Like ectocervical cells in vivo, the cultured cells display a typical epithelial cell morphology and undergo extensive stratification and envelope (superficial cell) formation. Like the in vivo ectocervical epithelium, the cultured ECE cells express type I cytokeratins K13, K14, K16, K17, and K19 and type II cytokeratins K5 and K6. Under normal culture conditions, however, cytokeratins K1, K2, K4, K11, and K15, which are expressed in vivo, are not expressed. An interesting finding is that ECE cells, in contrast to endocervix and epidermis in vivo and cultured epidermal keratinocytes, express very abundant levels of K13. In fact, K13 appears to be a specific marker of ECE cells in the female reproductive tract. When incubated with 10 nM diethylstilbestrol, ECE cell envelope production increased 3-fold, while incubation with 100 nM progesterone decreased envelope formation 3.4-fold. Simultaneous incubation with progesterone antagonized the diethylstilbestrol stimulation. Thus, in vivo-like sex steroid regulation of ECE cell differentiation is maintained in culture. In addition, the cells possess a high affinity, limited capacity binding site for estradiol that has a Kd of 1.2 +/- 0.1 nM. This system is likely to provide a useful model for the study of sex steroid regulation of normal ectocervical epithelial cell function.\r"

  ".U": "90091978\r", 
  ".W": "The mechanisms involved in mediating desensitization and down-regulation of renal PTH receptors have not been defined. Recent studies indicate that PTH binding promotes not only stimulation of adenylate cyclase and activation of protein kinase-A (PK-A), but also, stimulation of phospholipase-C, leading to activation of PK-C. PK-C has been shown to alter both receptor and adenylate cyclase function in other systems. Therefore, the present studies were conducted to test whether PK-C might play a role in the regulation of the PTH receptor-cyclase system after exposure to PTH. Exposure of confluent cultures of opossum kidney (OK) cells to rat PTH-(1-34) (100 nM) for 6 h resulted in a 48 +/- 8% (n = 5) decrease in stimulation of cAMP accumulation in response to further exposure to PTH. PTH receptor binding, assessed with 125I-[Nle8,Nle21,Tyr34]rat PTH-(1-34)NH2 as radioligand, was decreased to a similar extent. Phorbol ester (4 beta-12,13-didecanoate; 1 microM) treatment of the cells in the absence of PTH caused a 58 +/- 3% decrease in PTH-stimulated cAMP production, but equilibrium PTH receptor binding was not different from the control value. Both 50 microM H-7 and 0.5 microM Staurosporine (inhibitors of PK-C) completely blocked the effects of phorbol ester. Pretreatment with PTH, however, in the presence of H-7 or Staurosporine resulted in a completely normal cAMP response to restimulation with PTH. Thus, two inhibitors of PK-C completely prevented desensitization to PTH. The decrease in equilibrium PTH binding, seen after incubation with PTH alone, was also blunted by the inhibitors of PK-C. These data indicate that activation of PK-C by stimulation with PTH may play a role in the regulation of the PTH receptor-cyclase system in OK cells.\r"

The aims of this research were to localize the effect of TGF beta on bone matrix formation and to determine if this effect was dependent on increased cell replication, using histomorphometry and autoradiography of bone organ cultures. Half-calvariae of 21-day-old fetal rats were cultured with native or recombinant TGF beta 1 for 24 h and labeled either with [3H]proline for 0-24 or 24-48 h or with [3H]thymidine for the last 6 h of culture. Bones were fixed in glutaraldehyde, embedded in glycol methacrylate, and processed for autoradiography. Bone matrix formation was assessed as the matrix apposition rate per day and the percentage of [3H]proline-labeled bone surface. Cell replication was evaluated based on the number and percentage of [3H]thymidine labeled cells in the osteoblast cell zone, the osteoprogenitor cell zone, and the pericranial fibroblastic periosteum. Both native and recombinant TGF beta at 1-30 ng/ml increased bone matrix formation by 25-40% (P less than 0.05). At 30 ng/ml, TGF beta had a generalized mitogenic effect as cell replication increased by approximately 2-fold in all cell zones of the pericranial periosteum. TGF beta had specific effects on bone cell differentiation. The number of unlabeled cells lining the bone surface increased, and the number of osteoclasts on bone decreased. Inhibition of cell replication by hydroxyurea only partially blocked the stimulatory effect of TGF beta on bone matrix formation, suggesting that TGF beta may have independent effects on cell replication and differentiated bone cell function. In summary, TGF beta had a generalized mitogenic effect on the pericranial periosteum and specific stimulatory and inhibitory effects on bone cell differentiation and function.\r"

The explants prepared from pregnant mice were cultured first for 4 days under nonlactogenic conditions to reduce the initial level of beta-casein transcripts and then induced to express beta-casein gene in the presence of insulin, hydrocortisone, and PRL for up to 3 days. Among the six different combination of hormones tested in the first incubation period, the combinations of insulin and epidermal growth factor was found to reduce the residual level of beta-casein transcripts in cultured explants to a nearly undetectable level and allow the highest induction in the second incubation period. The increase in beta-casein transcripts was detected as early as 30 min of induction with insulin, hydrocortisone, and PRL, and its level increased more than 100-fold over the initial level at 24 h. The increase in beta-casein transcripts was blocked by concomitant addition of the protein synthesis inhibitors cycloheximide or puromycin with the three hormones. Cycloheximide inhibited the increase in beta-casein gene transcription that was elicited by insulin, hydrocortisone, and PRL, but did not alter the stability of beta-casein transcripts. These results suggested that protein synthesis was required for hormonal activation of beta-casein gene transcription.\r"

  ".W": "Microsomal membranes from chicken liver and cerebellum specifically bind 125I-labeled avian pancreatic polypeptide (APP) with widely different affinities. To understand further the structural basis for this affinity difference as well as to determine the nature of the PP receptor, certain biochemical characteristics of chicken cerebellar and liver membrane [125I] APP-binding sites were determined. Trypsin digestion markedly reduced liver and cerebellar membrane binding of [125I]APP. Neuraminidase did not alter binding, while phospholipase-C lowered liver specific [125I]APP binding via a nonspecific digestion of the membrane. Cerebellar [25I]APP binding was unaltered by phospholipase-C. Dithiothreitol significantly inhibited liver and cerebellar specific [125I]APP binding without altering affinity. N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM) potently inhibited specific cerebellar [125I]APP binding and affinity and increased liver [125I]APP binding without altering affinity. NEM inhibited [125I]APP degradation by both liver and cerebellar membranes. NEM caused significant dissociation of [125I]APP from cerebellar membranes. Collectively, these studies indicate that chicken liver and cerebellar membrane [125I]APP-binding sites (either the putative receptors per se or the surrounding membranes) are proteinaceous and possess disulfide bonds important in ligand binding. Free thiol groups appear essential for cerebellar [125I]APP binding, while in liver membranes, free thiol groups interfere with binding or play no role in the binding process per se. These studies provide a foundation for a more precise molecular definition of the structures of PP receptors.\r"

  ".W": "The regulatory effect of insulin on plasma membrane (Ca2+ + Mg2+)ATPase activity in target tissues for insulin was proposed to be of importance in mediating the hormone's cellular action. Consequently, polyclonal insulin receptor antibodies from patients with type B insulin resistance (B7 and B10) were used as probes to further explore a possible role for this ATPase in insulin action. The antibodies B7 and B10 obtained during the active phase of the disease manifested insulinomimetic actions in rat renal cortical basolateral membranes by displacing [125I]insulin bound to the membranes and stimulating the tyrosine kinase activity of solubilized insulin receptors in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, these antibodies had insulin antagonistic effects on the membrane (Ca2+ + Mg2+)ATPase activity. While insulin stimulated, both antibodies inhibited the ATPase basal activity in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the stimulatory effect of insulin on the ATPase was completely abolished by the antibodies. Immunoglobulin fractions obtained from patient B10 in the clinically inactive phase of the disease and from pooled normal human sera did not affect basal or insulin-stimulated ATPase activity. The effects of insulin receptor antibodies on basal and insulin-stimulated (Ca2+ + Mg2+)ATPase activities were specific. The receptor antibody did not affect PTH-stimulated (Ca2+ + Mg2+) ATPase activity, nor did it affect other kidney basolateral membrane ATPase basal activities. The data reveal that insulin receptor antibodies have a direct regulatory effect on the plasma membrane (Ca2+ + Mg2+) ATPase. We suggest that the insulin antagonistic effects of the insulin receptor antibodies on the ATPase might explain in part the impaired insulin action in type B insulin resistance.\r"

  ".W": "To describe the T3 kinetics in a recirculating rat liver perfusion system, we have developed a mathematical two-pool model consisting of medium and liver. It appeared that all parameters of the model could be fully resolved by using the time-dependent disappearance of radioactive T3 (2 nM) from the medium only. The model calculates the T3 medium pool, the T3 liver pool, and the amount of hormone metabolized at different times after the start of the perfusion. To check the validity of the model, metabolism was also estimated from the appearance of labeled metabolites (glucuronides, sulfates, and I-) in the medium and the cumulative excretion of T3 and metabolites into the bile. The medium pool was also estimated by the product of medium volume and remaining T3 concentration, and the liver pool as the amount of T3 at time zero minus medium pool minus T3 metabolized). These results were in excellent agreement with the predicted values from the model. Taking the metabolites appearing in medium and bile together, about 38% of the total amount of T3 metabolized during 60 min was converted into T3 glucuronide, 12% into T3 sulfate, and 48% into I-, respectively, while about 3% was excreted in the bile unaltered. The results show that not all T3 transported to the liver is being metabolized, but part is bound outside the cellular compartment. This latter pool of T3 is dependent on the albumin concentration in the medium. The amount of T3 metabolized is solely determined by the free T3 concentration and is independent of total T3 or albumin concentration in the medium.\r"

First we have studied the effect of lithium on TSH-induced iodide uptake. Significant suppression was seen at 0.1 mmol/liter, and half-maximal suppression was obtained at the pharmacological concentration reported in patient serum. The suppression was dose dependent and reversible. Besides the suppression of cAMP production stimulated by TSH, lithium also inhibited iodide uptake stimulated by forskolin or 8-bromo-cAMP. These results demonstrated that lithium inhibits TSH-induced iodide uptake not only by reducing cAMP production, but also by acting on the steps of post-cAMP production. Next, we studied the effect of lithium on DNA synthesis of the cultured porcine thyroid cells. Lithium stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation of the thyroid cells in the basal condition (0.5% fetal calf serum) as well as those stimulated by insulin-like growth factor-I (100 micrograms/liter). The minimal concentrations for the significant increase were 0.5 and 0.1 mmol/liter, respectively. These results suggest that lithium might contribute to the formation of the goiter directly at the cellular levels in patients treated with the agent.\r"

Radioactively labeled proenkephalin prepared with this system was also cleaved; however, under identical conditions bovine proinsulin was not cleaved.

Recent studies with isolated granules, however, have suggested that granule storage forms may be relatively osmotically inactive due to oligomerization involving hormonal intermolecular disulfide bonds. Thus, expenditure of metabolic energy by the cell in order to maintain granule integrity would be reduced. When secretion is stimulated, oligomer depolymerization by thiol exchange mechanisms has been proposed to occur before or even concomitant with exocytosis. The present studies were designed to investigate the influence of metabolic inhibitors, thiols, and divalent cations on PRL storage in situ, rather than in isolated granules. The results suggest that 1) PRL granules require little energy to maintain their structure, since a combination of azide (10 mM), fluoride (10 mM), and cyanide (1 mM) had no effect on PRL granule morphology in normal anterior pituitary cells in primary culture; 2) disulfide linkages are involved in the osmotic activity of the PRL granule contents, since thiols induced granule swelling in lightly fixed cells; and 3) thiols and divalent cations are capable of altering the arrangement of stored hormone molecules, since PRL immunoactivity could be modified by these agents in glycol methacrylate-embedded exposed granule cores.\r"

  ".W": "The central site of action and the cellular mechanism by which progesterone stimulates respiration were studied in ovariectomized cats that were anesthetized, paralyzed, and ventilated and in which respiratory sensory feedback mechanisms were either eliminated or controlled. Phrenic nerve activity served as an index of central respiratory output. Progesterone did not stimulate respiration in ovariectomized cats not pretreated with estrogen. In contrast, repeated doses of progesterone (0.1-1.0 microgram/kg, iv, cumulative) caused a sustained (greater than 45 min) dose-dependent facilitation of phrenic nerve activity in animals primed 3 days before study with 17 beta-estradiol (20 micrograms/kg, sc). Estrogen exposure is, therefore, a prerequisite for the respiratory response to progesterone in ovariectomized cats. This estrogen-dependent respiratory response to progesterone was attenuated in animals pretreated with either the estrogen receptor antagonist CI628 or the progesterone receptor antagonist RU486, indicating that the respiratory response is mediated by both estrogen and progesterone receptors. Inhibitors of protein (anisomycin) and RNA (actinomycin-D) synthesis caused a diminution of the respiratory response to progesterone, implicating a requirement for gene expression in the response. Midcollicular decerebration (which removed the diencephalon) attenuated, whereas decortication (which spared the diencephalon) did not affect the respiratory response to progesterone. Thus, the diencephalon appears to be a critical neuroanatomical substrate for the response. These results indicate that the respiratory response to progesterone is mediated, at a hypothalamic site, via a genomic mechanism with characteristics consistent with the prototypic mechanism for progesterone actions.\r"

  ".W": "17 beta-Estradiol (E2) alters different functions of pituitary cells, including cell sensitivity to several neurohormones such as LHRH, TRH, somatostatin, or dopamine, presumably by affecting receptor coupling mechanisms. Attempting to pinpoint the membrane processes underlying this modulation, we studied the effect of E2 on pituitary kinase-C (PKC) activity, a major signal transduction enzyme. The distribution of calcium- and phospholipid-dependent partially purified PKC (chromatography on DEAE-52 cellulose columns) was evaluated in membrane and cytosol fractions from anterior pituitaries of ovariectomized (OVX) or OVX plus E2-treated rats. E2 administration by implants to OVX animals increased significantly both soluble and particulate enzyme activity. The effect increased progressively from 24 h to 5 days after E2 treatment. Administration of 17 alpha-estradiol, an inactive stereoisomer of E2, was ineffective, pointing to stereospecific interaction. Total destruction of neural connections to the pituitary (complete hypothalamic lesions) did not modify the enzyme response to E2 administration, indicating a direct effect of the steroid on pituitary PKC activity. A direct E2 (10(-9) M) effect was confirmed in primary mixed cultures of pituitary cells; it was time dependent (15-96 h) and specific, and reflects a genomic E2 action. E2 treatment for shorter times had no effect on the enzyme levels or the membrane redistribution of PKC activity. In contrast, under the same experimental conditions phorbol esters (12-O-tertadecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA] induced a rapid and sustained translocation of the enzyme. PKC activity was found in all pituitary cell types, with maximal activity in fractions of gonadotropes and thyrotropes, as evaluated in cultures enriched in certain types of pituitary cells separated by means of unit gravity gradient sedimentation. E2 treatment (10(-9) M; 72 h) significantly increased both soluble and particulate enzyme levels in all cell types. In addition, administration of E2 (10(-9) M; 72 h) to cell cultures strongly increased the TPA-evoked LH and PRL release. These results indicate that E2-induced changes in pituitary function include selective effects of the steroid on PKC activity involved at different levels in the coupling mechanisms.\r"

Incubation of both neuronal and glial cells derived from neonatal rats with 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate induced a time- and dose-dependent increase in the steady state levels of GT1 mRNA. In glial cells, this corresponded to an increase in both the level of GT1 protein and glucose transporter activity, as demonstrated by Western blot analysis and [3H]2-deoxyglucose (dGlc) uptake studies. In contrast, in neuronal cells 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate had no effect on either the concentration/level of the GT or [3H]dGlc uptake. These results suggest that phorbol esters regulate dGlc uptake at the transcriptional level in both neuronal and glial cells, but that the increase in expression of the GT1 gene is dissociated from posttranscriptional events involved in dGlc uptake in neuronal cells.\r"

  ".W": "As we previously obtained evidence that insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) inhibits T3-induced GH secretion and GH mRNA expression without affecting basal GH secretion in thyroidectomized rat pituitary cells grown in hypothyroid medium, we examined changes in IGF-I receptors in the pituitary gland, as induced by thyroid hormone. Thyroidectomized rats and a quantitative receptor autoradiographic method were used. The density of [125I]IGF-I-binding sites in the anterior pituitary gland decreased 4 weeks after thyroidectomy; that is a significant decrease in the number of the receptors compared to findings in control rats (P less than 0.01). The affinity (Kd) remained unchanged. There were no changes in binding parameters in the ventroposterior thalamic nucleus in the brain, renal cortex, and liver parenchyma. The ip administration of T4 once a day (48 micrograms/kg) for 1-2 weeks compensated for the decrease in the binding capacity of [125I]IGF-I-binding sites to that of the control values (P less than 0.01). We propose that IGF-I receptors in the anterior pituitary gland may be regulated by thyroid hormone.\r"

  ".U": "90092000\r", 
  ".W": "To investigate a possible role of catecholamines in mammary gland growth and differentiation, we have studied the characteristics of a specific beta-adrenergic receptor population during the different reproductive phases of the rat mammary gland, namely pregnancy and lactation. The functional response to mammary beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation was assessed by measurement of adenylate cyclase activity during the same physiological states of the gland [125I]Cyanopindolol (CYP) binds specifically to membranes prepared from lactating mammary glands. Scatchard analysis of the binding data shows the presence of a single class of high affinity sites, with an apparent Kd value of 25.0 +/- 0.4 pM and a binding capacity of 32.5 +/- 1.2 fmol/mg protein in lactating mammary glands at random stages of lactation. The order of potency of a series of agonists to compete for [125I]CYP binding is consistent with the interactions with a beta 2-subtype receptor. The binding of [125I]CYP to mammary glands also shows a marked stereoselectivity; the (-)isomers of isoproterenol and propranolol are more potent than their respective enantiomers. The radioautographic localization of [125I]CYP reveals the presence of specific beta-adrenergic receptors in the epithelial cells, alveoles, ducts, as well as adipocytes. [125I]CYP binding shows a 2- to 3-fold increase during pregnancy. Such a result correlates with parallel increases in stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity, the cytosolic progesterone receptor concentration, as well as plasma 17 beta-estradiol and progesterone levels. At parturition, a sharp decline in beta-adrenergic receptor concentration is observed, a finding concomitant with a drop in progesterone receptor levels as well as plasma estradiol and progesterone concentrations. During midlactation, beta-adrenergic receptors reach their maximal levels. The presence of specific beta-adrenergic receptors functionally coupled to the adenylate cyclase system and the marked changes in receptor capacity and distribution measured during the different physiological states of the mammary gland suggest that the mammary beta-adrenergic receptors are highly sensitive to changes in the hormonal milieu and provide a mechanism for a direct catecholaminergic influence on mammary gland growth and differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "To gain further knowledge on the role of ovarian hormones in the regulation of mammary beta-adrenergic receptors, virgin animals were killed during the various phases of the estrous cycle as well as after ovariectomy and treatment with sex steroid. beta-Adrenergic receptor levels fluctuate in the rat mammary gland during the estrous cycle, with higher receptor numbers during the proestrous and estrous phases of the cycle. Ovariectomy caused an almost 50% loss of beta-adrenergic receptor concentration in the mammary gland of virgin rats. Treatment of ovariectomized animals with 17 beta-estradiol or progesterone alone or in combination for 3 weeks induced a marked increase in beta-adrenergic receptor concentration, while administration of the androgen dihydrotestosterone did not modify mammary beta-adrenergic binding sites. While levels of beta-adrenergic receptors in control lactating animals (10 days of lactation) were elevated, chronic treatment with the dopaminergic-mimetic agent 2 alpha-bromoergocryptine (CB-154; for 7 days) reduced beta-adrenergic receptor concentration. Castration of lactating animals decreased beta-adrenergic receptor number to approximately 30% of the value in intact controls, while combined withdrawal of circulating ovarian hormones and inhibition of plasma PRL levels caused an almost complete inhibition of beta-adrenergic receptor concentration. Scatchard analysis of the binding data revealed that the observed alterations in beta-adrenergic receptors resulted from changes in the number of beta-adrenergic binding sites, with no change in binding affinities. The present findings indicate that the beta-adrenergic receptor population of the rat mammary gland is under the control of ovarian hormones and PRL and suggest that circulating or locally released catecholamines could interact with sex steroids and PRL in the regulation of mammary gland growth, differentiation, and activity.\r"

Since IL-6 is not normally detectable in the blood, we hypothesized that IL-6 may be produced by the anterior pituitary in situ and thereby affect hormone secretion through paracrine or autocrine mechanisms. The present study demonstrates that cultured anterior pituitary cells spontaneously secrete large quantities of IL-6 in vitro. IL-6 was detectable in the incubation medium within 2 h, and by 8 h of culture had attained concentrations of 2000-4000 U/ml.4 x 10(5) cells. IL-6 production was stimulated by phorbol myristate acetate (10-100 nM) approximately 2-fold and by lipopolysaccharide (0.001-10.0 micrograms/ml) 4-fold during 4-h incubations. In contrast, the cytokine recombinant human IL-1 alpha had no effect on IL-6 release by cultured pituitary cells. Freshly dissected hemipituitary tissue also secreted more than 3000 U/ml IL-6 during a 4-h incubation. This secretion was enhanced 3-fold by 10 micrograms/ml lipopolysaccharide. Our results suggest that the anterior pituitary may produce IL-6 in situ, where it may function as an intrapituitary releasing factor.\r"

  ".W": "To better understand the possible roles and interactions of transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF alpha) and its receptor, the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor in human breast epithelium, we have studied the expression of TGF alpha and the EGF receptor in a series of normal human mammary epithelial cells derived from reduction mammoplasty before in vitro propagation, during short term proliferation in vitro, and after immortalization. Increased TGF alpha mRNA expression coincided with conversion of the cells to a proliferative state in vitro. After establishment, propagation, and proliferation in vitro, the cells expressed high levels of both TGF alpha and EGF receptor mRNAs. Addition of diverse growth inhibitory agents, including 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), TGF beta, and sodium butyrate, to one of these rapidly proliferating cell populations (no. 184) failed to reduce the expression of either TGF alpha or the EGF receptor. Likewise, cessation of growth associated with both senescence and confluence of the 184 cells did not result in reduced expression. However, regulation of TGF alpha mRNA could be demonstrated by withdrawal of EGF from the medium or by antibody-mediated blockade of the EGF receptor in 184 cells. Antibody-mediated EGF receptor blockade also results in inhibition of growth and [3H]thymidine labeling. An autoregulatory autocrine loop appears operant in proliferating breast epithelial cells. Both growth and levels of TGF alpha mRNA expression are controlled by binding of ligand to the EGF receptor. These studies suggest a role for the TGF alpha/EGF receptor pathway in normal breast cell physiology.\r"

  ".W": "The feedback effects of GH on its own secretion were studied in conscious male rats receiving intermittent iv infusions of human GH. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (150-180 g) were implanted with double bore iv cannula. Infusions of human GH (hGH) or buffer were given for up to 32 h, while frequent microsamples (20 microliters) of blood were withdrawn simultaneously using an automatic blood-sampling system. The endogenous GH pulses became synchronized to pulsatile hGH infusions (2.1 U/kg.infusion) given at 3-h intervals. After two or more hGH infusions episodic GH release was present in most rats, and all endogenous pulses occurred concomitantly with the hGH infusions. After 24 h of hGH treatment the endogenous pulses were still synchronized to the every 3 h hGH infusions. In addition, the pulse amplitude was lower than that in vehicle-treated animals (74 +/- 12 vs. 215 +/- 35 ng/ml; P less than 0.01). At this time a complete (1.5-h) phase shift of the 3-hourly hGH infusions markedly suppressed endogenous GH pulses in all rats. In another experiment where the same daily dose of hGH was given in iv infusions every 1.5 h instead of every 3 h, the endogenous GH pulses were irregular, infrequent, and suppressed. Infusions at 3-h intervals of a lower dose of hGH (0.42 U/kg.infusion) did not affect the timing or amplitude of endogenous GH pulses compared to those in buffer-infused animals. The endogenous GH pulses were not synchronized between animals given 0.42 U/kg hGH or buffer at 3-h intervals. It is concluded that the endogenous GH pulses in male rats became synchronized to intermittent infusions of hGH at 3-h (but not 1.5-h) intervals. The fact that there were no endogenous pulses between the 3-hourly infusions suggests that the feedback effect of a GH pulse lasts for approximately 3 h. This mechanism may be involved in the control of the GH secretory pattern in male rats.\r"

  ".W": "To continue our studies on the influence of T3 on TSH regulation in the Walker 256 carcinoma-bearing rat model of nonthyroidal disease, we measured the effect of T3 on pituitary content of beta TSH mRNA and rat (r) TSH in hypothyroid control (C) and tumor-bearing (T) rats. The effect of T3 on TSH regulation was compared to effects on GH mRNA and rGH in the same animals. mRNA content was normalized to a pool of pituitaries from euthyroid rats (= 1.0). beta TSH mRNA increased 18-fold in both hypothyroid C and T rats and then decreased similarly with increasing T3 infusion to a value of 0.1. GH mRNA content decreased to 0.11 +/- 0.01 in hypothyroid C rats, but to only 0.38 +/- 0.02 in T rats (P less than 0.001). The pituitary contents of GH mRNA and rGH in hypothyroid T rats was significantly greater than those in C rats at all T3 infusion rates. These data together with our previous report of decreased nuclear T3 in T rats suggest that regulation of beta TSH mRNA by T3 is intact in T rats, but occurs at a lower concentration of nuclear T3. In contrast, the GH mRNA response is enhanced, displaying differential regulation of these two T3-responsive gene products in this model of nonthyroidal illness.\r"

GH acutely regulated the abundance of multiple IGF-I RNA transcripts and resulted in a 2-fold increase in secreted immunoreactive IGF-I (iIGF-I) polypeptide in medium conditioned for 48 h by preadipocyte cultures relative to those not receiving GH. Immunocytochemical data indicated that IGF-I is synthesized by presumptive and mature adipocytes. The effect of GH on iIGF-I secretion was observed in cultures derived from both fetal and postnatal animals, while secreted IGF-binding protein activity was increased due to GH only in cultures from fetal animals. The increase in local IGF-I production in response to GH was associated with a decrease in adipocyte development, suggesting that local IGF-I may contribute to suppression of differentiated phenotype.\r"

Rabbit ovaries were perfused with hCG alone or with hCG plus at 10, 10(2), or 10(3) ng/ml. PRL at 10(3) ng/ml directly inhibited the degeneration and decomposition of surface epithelial cells induced by hCG exposure. The subsurface connective tissue was visualized by treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate, which removed surface epithelial cells from the ovary, thereby exposing collagen fibrils and the basal lamina. Sodium dodecyl sulfate treatment revealed inhibition of connective tissue disruption at the apex of the follicle wall in PRL-treated ovaries. PA activity in mature follicles in perfused rabbit ovaries exposed to hCG increased from 1.40 +/- 0.08 to 28.4 +/- 4.25 IU/g tissue after 4 h of perfusion. The addition of PRL to the perfusate inhibited the hCG-stimulated increase in intrafollicular PA activity in a dose-dependent fashion. Although at 7 h mature follicles treated by hCG alone showed greater intrafollicular PA activity than those treated with hCG plus PRL, this difference was not significant. These results suggest that PRL may act directly by interfering with mechanical events within the ovary that are required for the rupture of mature Graafian follicles, probably via the inhibition of intrafollicular tissue PA activity.\r"

Kinetic studies conducted at 4 C showed the binding reactions to be reversible. Competition studies showed recombinant human IGF-I (rh-IGF-I) to be 8-, 18-, and 1000-fold more potent at inhibiting [125I]rh-IGF-I binding than recombinant bovine IGF-II (rb-IGF-II), multiplication-stimulating activity, and insulin, respectively. rbIGF-II was 1.8- and 6-fold more potent at inhibiting [125I]rbIGF-II binding than rhIGF-II and multiplication-stimulating activity. Specific binding of [125I]IGF-I and -II was measured in microsomes prepared from cows (n = 47) ranging from 138 days prepartum to 411 days postpartum. IGF-I binding declined during the prepartum period, increased 75% with the onset of lactation, and then declined during the postpartum period. Scatchard analysis showed the presence of a single class of high affinity binding sites for both ligands, with type II receptors being about 10-fold more prevalent than type I receptors. The survey and Scatchard data support the conclusion that the onset of lactation coincides with an increase in the number of type I receptors present in mammary tissue. This increase supports the contention that IGF-I may play an important role in modulating the metabolic activity of the bovine mammary gland.\r"

In serum, it occurs complexed to a 30-kDa nonglycosylated IGF-binding protein (IGFBP) that is immunologically related to the IGFBP in BRL-3A rat liver cells (rIGFBP-2). Levels of rIGFBP-2 and IGF-II decrease in rat serum after birth. Using a recently isolated cDNA clone for rIGFBP-2 as hybridization probe, we now compare the expression of rIGFBP-2 and IGF-II in fetal tissues and the effects of hypophysectomy and fasting on the abundance of these mRNAs in adult rat liver. rIGFBP-2 mRNA is expressed at high levels in term gestation liver and at lower levels in other tissues. The ratio of rIGFBP-2 to IGF-II mRNAs in stomach, kidney, and lung is similar to that seen in liver, whereas IGF-II mRNA is more abundant than rIGFBP-2 mRNA in muscle, intestine, heart, and skin. Both mRNAs are more abundant in fetal tissues than in the corresponding tissues from adult rats. Dexamethasone treatment of 4-day-old rats for 4 days caused a greater (90%) decrease in hepatic IGF-II mRNA than in rIGFBP-2 mRNA (50%), suggesting subtle differences in the developmental regulation of the two mRNAs. Even more striking differences were observed in the regulation of the two mRNAs in adult rats after hypophysectomy or fasting. Hepatic rIGFBP-2 mRNA was increased 10- to 20-fold compared to age-matched control rats, whereas IGF-II mRNA was not increased. A parallel increase in serum rIGFBP-2 was observed, suggesting that this regulation may result at least in part from the increased abundance of rIGFBP-2 mRNA. Thus, in addition to modulating the stimulation of growth and differentiation by IGF-II in fetal tissues, rIGFBP-2 may play a homeostatic role during catabolic states in the adult rat.\r"

Daily measurements of ovarian aromatase activity appear to follow a similar pattern, suggesting a potential regulatory role for the enzyme. To examine this hypothesis, mature rats were killed at various times, and ovarian microsomes were assayed for aromatase activity, while androstenedione, testosterone, estradiol, and estrone levels were measured in ovarian cytosol by RIA. The ovarian aromatase activity reached a peak about 9 h after the onset of the light period on the day of proestrus, and then began to decrease gradually to 75% lower levels by the morning of estrus. Similarly, the estradiol levels also peaked at about 9 h, but then dropped sharply; at 18 h the estradiol levels were reduced 90-95%, while aromatase activity was still close to its peak value. In contrast, the androstenedione and testosterone levels remained high for 3-4 h after the estradiol levels began to decrease. Estrone levels varied considerably less than those of estradiol, reaching lower peak values, but then decreasing only 50-75%. The dissociation between product levels and enzyme activity cannot be explained by a change in the Km of aromatase, which was about 20 nM for androstenedione throughout this period. Therefore, it appears that the decrease in estradiol levels from the peak of the surge may in part be a consequence of a shift in the ratio of the estrogen products synthesized by the ovary, rather than a decrease in the ovarian capacity for estrogen production, although other factors appear to be involved as well.\r"

  ".W": "In primary cultures of sheep pituitary cells extracellular nucleotides stimulated rapid increases in inositol tris- and bisphosphate, accompanied by intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. A similar stimulation of inositol phosphate production by extracellular nucleotides was observed in rat and baboon pituitary cells. The inositol phosphate response to nucleotides was greater than that elicited by any of the known hypothalamic releasing peptides. UTP, ATP, and ATP gamma S were the most potent agonists, with EC50 values for inositol phosphate production of 1.2, 2.6, and 2.7 microM. The relative potencies of a range of nucleotides indicates that the pharmacological specificity of the pituitary nucleotide receptor is different from that of the previously characterized P2X and P2Y purinoceptors present in other tissues. Increasing extracellular Mg2+ concentrations caused a shift to the right of the ATP dose-response curves, indicating that the predominantly active agonist species is not MgATP and may be ATP4-. In the absence of both Ca2+ and Mg2+ (1 mM EDTA) ATP stimulated inositol phosphate production with high potency (EC50 = 200 nM), indicating that an ectokinase or ecto-ATPase reaction is not involved in its mode of action. Phosphoinositidase-C activation by ATP was insensitive to pertussis toxin. The magnitude of the inositol phosphate and 45Ca2+ responses to extracellular nucleotides indicates that a substantial fraction of the cells in primary pituitary cultures bears nucleotide receptors. None of the major pituitary hormones appear to be released by extracellular nucleotides. The cell types in the pituitary that bear these nucleotide receptors are at present unidentified.\r"

We studied the in vitro effects of PRL on splenocytes from ovariectomized (OVX) rats and discovered that PRL induced the formation of interleukin-2 (IL-2) cell surface receptors. However, PRL did not induce IL-2 secretion. This response, which was dependent on the concentration of PRL, also depended upon the estrogen status of the splenocyte donor; thus, splenocytes from OVX rats or rats in diestrus responded to PRL, whereas those from estrogen-treated OVX rats or rats in estrus did not. We propose that in vivo exposure of PRL, under certain physiological conditions, may prime a pool of splenocytes to express IL-2 cell surface receptors, allowing these cells to be responsive to variations in local concentrations of IL-2.\r"

  ".W": "In a previous study it was demonstrated that spermatogenesis can be maintained quantitatively with exogenously administered testosterone in adult intact rats that lack LH. The studies described herein were designed to examine the extent to which spermatogenesis can be maintained quantitatively with exogenously administered testosterone in adult rats that lack all pituitary hormones. Adult male rats were hypophysectomized and testosterone was administered at the time of hypophysectomy via sustained release polydimethylsiloxane (PDS) capsules of increasing lengths. We used the PDS capsules to clamp testosterone at defined concentrations within the seminiferous tubule fluid over a 2- to 3-month treatment period. Mean testis weights and advanced spermatid numbers per testis stabilized by 8 weeks of testosterone treatment regardless of testosterone dose. Both testis weight and advanced spermatid number responded to testosterone dose, reaching plateaus of 1.2 g and 170 x 10(6) per testis, respectively. These values were 60% of, and significantly less than, the respective control values. This result was in striking contrast to the results of our previous study of LH-suppressed intact rats, in which exogenously administered testosterone resulted in testis weights and advanced spermatid numbers that plateaued at values not significantly different from those in controls. These different effects of testosterone in intact and hypophysectomized rats occurred despite the fact that the seminiferous tubule fluid testosterone concentrations achieved in the hypophysectomized rats (up to 25 ng/ml) were greater than the minimal testosterone concentration found previously to be required to maintain spermatogenesis quantitatively in LH-suppressed intact rats (13 ng/ml). Taken together, these results demonstrate clearly that intratesticular testosterone doses that are as high as or higher than those that maintain spermatogenesis quantitatively in intact rats lacking LH fail to maintain spermatogenesis quantitatively in rats lacking all pituitary hormones.\r"

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography demonstrated the site of the fistula in 22 cases. Sphincterotomy or biliary stent placement resulted in rapid resolution of the fistula in 16 of 24 patients. Failures were attributed to exclusion of the injured intrahepatic bile duct in two cases, insufficient dilation of a bile duct stricture in one, the large size of the bile duct defect in two, and associated lesions in three (cirrhosis, arterial trauma, subhepatic abscess). Endoscopic management of biliary fistulae requires: (1) visualization of the location of the fistula by retrograde cholangiography especially in case of an intrahepatic lesion, (2) prior percutaneous drainage of associated subhepatic or subphrenic abscesses, and (3) appropriate relief of distal biliary obstruction in order to reduce the intraductal biliary pressure. The outcome is uncertain when endoprostheses are used to bridge large bile duct defects.\r"

The mucosal abnormalities seen in the small intestine of all three patients were similar to those within the stomach and are thought to represent an extension of congestive gastropathy and to be contributing to the blood loss. We propose that the term \"congestive gastropathy\" be replaced by a more comprehensive term, \"congestive gastroenteropathy.\" The cause of these mucosal abnormalities remains unclear. Attempts at endoscopic therapy of these extensive abnormalities should be avoided until a greater understanding of the underlying pathophysiology is reached.\r"

Recent claims of a high frequency of erosions, ulceration, and bleeding in the esophagus, ascribed to repeated, self-induced vomiting, prompted us to investigate by endoscopy the upper gastrointestinal mucosa in 37 consecutive patients with long-standing bulimia nervosa. The endoscopic appearance of esophageal and gastric mucosa was normal in 23 patients. Signs of mild esophagitis observed in eight patients were not related to the duration or severity of bulimic behavior or to symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux; two of these eight patients had sliding hiatal hernias. The remaining six patients were found to have superficial mucosal erythema in the stomach or duodenum, but none showed actual erosions, ulcers, or bleeding. Our observations suggest that, in contrast to reports by others, mucosal injury consequent to chronic, self-induced vomiting in patients with bulimia nervosa is relatively infrequent and limited.\r"

Central apneas occurred in 13 of the patients undergoing colonoscopy during the medication period; however, only 8 of these patients with apneas experienced desaturation greater than or equal to 4% and the periods of desaturation did not correlate with the periods of apneas. Oxygen desaturation greater than or equal to 4% occurs frequently during both upper endoscopy and colonoscopy in this elderly population. This is related to the effects of sedation; the procedure itself worsened the desaturation in only 16% of the patients. Furthermore, the desaturation did not correlate with changes in the breathing patterns of the patients. Low-flow oxygen and/or close monitoring of patients during and subsequent to administration of medication is advised.\r"

However, there was no difference in the improvement achieved by one method compared with the other. The tumor probe was not difficult to use and complication rates were comparable. In the Atkinson tube group, two patients developed complications related to the position of the prosthesis and in three others food blocked the tube. Treatment with the tumor probe needed repeating at intervals (median, 28 days; range, 2 to 86 days) in all but four individuals to maintain palliation, with each patient needing a median of two treatments (range, 1 to 8). The probe may have advantages in very high esophageal lesions and may facilitate the treatment of tumor overgrowth or undergrowth of a tube. The prosthetic tube may give long-lasting relief of dysphagia and remains the treatment of choice for bronchopulmonary fistulas.\r"

It is not clear whether physical characteristics other than particle size affect emptying of indigestible solids from the fasting human stomach. We studied gastric emptying of three differently shaped particles, (cubes, spheres, rods) of either hard or soft consistency during the fasting state in human volunteers. The shape of indigestible particles did not affect their emptying. The area under the gastric emptying curve (AUC: particles x hour) was for hard cubes 24.7 (2.2), for hard spheres 27.9 (1.6), for hard rods 26.9 (2.7). All soft particles emptied faster than their identically shaped hard counterparts, but there was no difference among the three shapes (AUC for soft cubes: 29.2 (3.0), for soft spheres 32.0 (1.8), for soft rods 34.1 (1.2). If gastric emptying of hard and soft particles was compared independently of their shape, soft particles emptied significantly faster than hard ones: AUC 31.8 (1.2) v 26.5 (1.3) (p less than 0.01). In conclusion, the consistency but not the shape significantly affects gastric emptying. Specific physical characteristics other than size and shape may affect gastric emptying of indigestible particles which may be of importance in the design of drugs.\r"

  ".W": "A series of three experiments were performed on healthy adult volunteers to investigate the possible role played by beta-adrenoreceptor mediated pathways in the disturbance of human upper intestinal motor function by hand immersion in cold water. In the first experiment, (an extended pilot study on one individual), orocaecal transit of a standard meal was measured on 36 occasions with and without cold water stimulation and with and without a series of alpha and beta blocking drugs. Cold water stimulation consistently delayed transit in this individual, an effect which was attenuated by prior beta-blockade. In a double blind trial of the effect of beta-blocker atenolol v placebo on transit in nine individuals, a consistent reduction in the cold water induced transit delay was observed (p less than 0.01) independent of any direct effect of beta-blockade. In the third experiment seven individuals underwent repeated studies of antroduodenal pressure activity comparing the effects of cold and warm water stimulation with and without beta blockade to determine whether the observed transit effect could be related to an action on gastrointestinal motility. Cold water stimulation reduced antroduodenal motility, but no consistent effects of previous beta blockade were noted. These studies indicate the presence of a beta-adrenoreceptor mediated pathway in the cold water induced delay of orocaecal transit but not in the inhibition of gastroduodenal motility. Further studies are indicated to determine the site and mode of action of this transit effect more precisely.\r"

  ".W": "Patterns of oesophageal motility were recorded in 17 healthy volunteers and 12 patients with the irritable bowel syndrome. Recordings were taken at rest and under stress by hyperventilation, a dichotic hearing challenge and a cold pressor test. In healthy volunteers the dichotic hearing challenge was associated with a significant increase in the mean amplitude of oesophageal peristalsis from 69.9 mmHg to 82.4 mmHg (p less than 0.01) and in the percentage of simultaneous waves from 9.7% to 24.5% (p less than 0.01). The cold pressor test increased the peristaltic amplitude from 69.9 mmHg to 87.1 mmHg (p less than 0.001) and the percentage of simultaneous waves from 9.7% to 34.4% (p less than 0.01). Both manoeuvres were associated with increases in pulse and blood pressure. In patients with irritable bowel syndrome, the resting mean oesophageal peristaltic amplitude was higher than that seen in normal volunteers (95.9 mmHg v 69.9 mmHg p less than 0.05). Changes in oesophageal motility during stress were similar in these patients to those seen in normal subjects although the changes were not significant. This study refutes the hypothesis that symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and their association with stress are attributable to increased sensitivity of oesophageal motility to disruption by stressful stimuli.\r"

Using an ex vivo gastric chamber preparation, we studied the effect of sucralfate on gastric mucosal blood flow in rats by laser doppler flowmetry. Under both fasting and fed states, measurements of gastric mucosal blood flow and damage were made in rats after topical application of absolute ethanol alone or after pretreatment with sucralfate. Gastric mucosal damage was assessed by measuring the total area of haemorrhagic mucosal lesions. Ethanol induced gastric mucosal lesions were significantly less with sucralfate pretreatment than without (p less than 0.008). Mucosal blood flow significantly fell after ethanol application (p less than 0.001). The fall was significantly less in fed than in fasted rats (p less than 0.05), and after pretreatment with sucralfate 100 mg or 200 mg than without in both fasted (p less than 0.0008 and 0.00001, respectively) and fed (p less than 0.002 and 0.001, respectively) rats. Graded doses of sucralfate (25-400 mg) resulted in an increase in gastric mucosal blood flow in a dose dependent manner (r = 0.731, p less than 0.001). In conclusion that sucralfate increases gastric mucosal blood flow in rats and lessens the fall in blood flow in rats treated with ethanol, and this action may contribute to its protection against the vascular damage of mucosa by ethanol.\r"

After BII-gastrectomy bile acid reflux (median 16.1 mumol/h) was significantly higher (p less than 0.0001) than after RY-gastrectomy (0.1 mumol/h). Campylobacter pylori was present in the preoperative biopsies of all 17 patients. After RY-gastrectomy biopsies of all eight patients were positive for Campylobacter pylori, but was detected in only five of the nine patients with BII-gastrectomy. Preoperative scores of gastritis grading were similar in both groups and no significant differences were found postoperatively. Gastritis scores of the anastomotic mucosa in patients with BII-gastrectomy were significantly higher (p less than 0.02) than in the RY-gastrectomy group. Moreover, the reflux gastritis score in the four BII-gastrectomy patients cleared from Campylobacter pylori was significantly higher (p less than 0.02) than in the postgastrectomy patients harbouring Campylobacter pylori. The results suggest that reflux gastritis and Campylobacter pylori related gastritis are distinct microscopic entities and that bile reflux may play a role in the eradication of Campylobacter pylori after gastrectomy.\r"
