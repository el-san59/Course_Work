  ".W": "The effect of PEEP on the arterial minus end-tidal carbon dioxide gradient (PaCO2-PetCO2) was evaluated in 13 adult patients with acute respiratory failure. The morphologic study of the pressure-volume (P-V) curves allowed separation of the patients into two groups: group 1 (n = 7) with initial inflection point in the (P-V) curve, and group 2 without inflection point. We hypothesized that the profile of the PaCO2-PetCO2 gradient would indicate an appropriate PEEP level only in patients with recruitable air spaces. We ventilated group 1 patients with zero end expiratory pressure (ZEEP), PEEP corresponding to inflection point pressure (PEEPPi) and PEEP5 cm H2O above PEEPPi, and group 2 patients with ZEEP, 6 cm H2O PEEP and 12 cm H2O PEEP. The PaCO2-PetCO2 gradient changed significantly in group 1 (ZEEP: 13.59 mm Hg; PEEPPi: 8.33 mm Hg; PEEPPi + 5 cm H2O: 10.54 mm Hg), but not in group 2 (ZEEP: 14.15 mm Hg; PEEP 6 cm H2O: 14.20 mm Hg; PEEP 12 cm H2O: 16.53 mm Hg). Our results show that the PaCO2-PetCO2 gradient may be useful in selecting a PEEP level which produces alveolar recruitment, but only in those patients with initial inflection point in the P-V curve.\r"

  ".W": "Patients who require long-term ventilator care in an acute care setting may have a problem because diagnosis-related group (DRG) payments are less than the cost of their medical care. An alternative for quality medical care at lower cost includes admission to a long-term ventilator facility. In Chicago, only two dedicated long-term ventilator programs exist, with only 33 beds. Within 50 to 150 miles of the immediate Chicago area are three more units, with only 42 operational beds. All of the long-term care beds are full, and over 50 patients await transfer. Since acute care is reimbursed on a DRG designation and long-term ventilator care has no DRG category, there is a bias in acute care settings against these patients. Medicare patients are reimbursed up to 100 days, after which patients become eligible for public aid. Unfortunately, long-term ventilator patients often wait in acute care settings for this 100 days to elapse, even though medical care may be superior in a long-term ventilator unit. In addition to not providing the best care, this situation is economically wasteful. Solutions to these problems will require a coordinated national, state, and local plan. National medical societies should be consulted regarding solutions to health care problems that provide the best medical care at a reasonable cost for patients on long-term ventilation.\r"

Misoprostol inhibited histamine-stimulated acid secretion in a dose-dependent and noncompetitive manner. A concentration of 2-3 X 10(-9) M misoprostol inhibited maximal histamine-stimulated acid secretion by one half. Misoprostol had little to no effect on acid secretion stimulated by carbachol and dibutyryl cAMP, had no effect on the acid secretion directly stimulated by pentagastrin, and only modestly inhibited acid secretion stimulated by forskolin. Misoprostol noncompetitively inhibited cAMP formation in response to histamine, with an IC50 value similar to that for the inhibition of histamine-stimulated acid secretion. These results indicate that: (1) misoprostol specifically inhibits histamine-stimulated acid secretion in parietal cells, and (2) the antisecretory action of misoprostol is closely related to the reduction of histamine-stimulated cAMP formation with the site of major action most likely in the coupling process between histamine H2 receptor sites and histamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase.\r"

  ".W": "FSH bioactivity was measured by means of FSH-dependent aromatase activity (conversion of androgen substrate to estradiol). Assay sensitivity was optimized by the use of immature (7-10 days old) rats as Sertoli cell donors, serum-free medium for incubation, phosphodiesterase inhibitor (methylisobutylxanthinine), serial dilution of FSH in medium containing 1% BSA, delayed addition of FSH for 72 h after cell plating, and 19-hydroxyandrostenedione (2.5 X 10(-6) M) as the aromatizable androgen substrate. The method consisted of subjecting the decapsulated immature rat testes to a 2-step collagenase dispersion, plating the cells in medium [Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium-Ham's F-10 (1:1)] containing growth factors and methylisobutylxanthinine for 72 h, adding increasing doses of FSH to the standard curve or small volumes of serum to the test vials as well as 19-hydroxyandrostenedione for 24 h, and measuring estradiol by RIA in dilutions of the medium. Using NIAMDD human (h) FSH-2 as the bioassay standard, the useful range of the assay was 0.01-5.0 ng/ml. Specificity was determined by the addition of graded doses of hLH, hTSH, ACTH, hGH, hPRL, and hCG. The minor degree of FSH bioactivity observed in a few hormone preparations was accounted for by the degree of FSH contamination in them. Mean intra- and interassay coefficients of variation were 9% and 11%, and the index of precision was 0.049. This bioassay was used to determine the bioactive FSH content of pituitary extracts, tissue culture media, elutions from columns, and isoelectrically focused samples. More importantly, small quantities of human sera gave responses parallel to the standard curve in a minimum of two dilutions. The bio- to immunoreactive ratios, expressed as the mean +/- SEM (NIAMDD-hFSH-2), were 0.66 +/- 0.2 in boys (n = 6), 0.78 +/- 0.2 in pubertal girls (n = 6), 1.18 +/- 0.2 in men (n = 13), 1.24 +/- 0.1 in postmenopausal women (n = 30), 1.94 +/- 0.3 in the follicular phase (n = 19), 6.2 +/- 1.4 in the ovulatory phase (n = 19), and 1.6 +/- 0.4 in the luteal phase (n = 19) of the normal menstrual cycle. These results indicate that the bio- to immunoreactive hFSH ratio in the circulation, is dependent upon the hormonal milieu of the subject.\r"

  ".W": "Although the amino acid sequence of the alpha- and beta-subunits of glycoprotein hormones in various species has been deciphered, data on their tertiary structure are not abundant. This impedes correlation between structure and function. The availability of monoclonal antibodies to human TSH (hTSH) offers the opportunity to enumerate the antigenic determinants present on the surface of hTSH and its subunits and to examine their spatial relationships. Twenty-eight monoclonal antibodies to hTSH were obtained from several fusions, and screens carried out separately in the laboratories involved in this study. Affinities for hTSH ranged from 10(8)-10(11) M-1. Cross-reactivity with bovine TSH (bTSH), human gonadotropins (hLH, hFSH, and hCG), and the alpha- and beta-subunits of hTSH distinguished 10 groups of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) according to their main cross-reactions: 1) hTSH alpha, hLH, hFSH, and hCG; 2) hTSH alpha, bTSH, hLH, hFSH, and hCG; 3) hFSH; 4) bTSH and hFSH; 5) bTSH, hLH, and hFSH; 6) bTSH, hLH, hFSH, and hCG; 7) hTSH beta; 8) hTSH beta and bTSH; 9) hTSH beta and hFSH; and 10) hTSH beta, hLH, hFSH, and hCG. mAb were incorporated into 2-site binding assays to probe hTSH by a 28 X 28 matrix, the free alpha-subunit by a 4 X 4 matrix, and the free beta-subunit by a 18 X 18 matrix. Regarding intact hTSH, 12 different clusters of mAb were distinguished and interpreted as reflecting 12 distinct antigenic regions on the surface of the hTSH molecule. Two of them were localized on the alpha-subunit, and 6 on the beta-subunit; 4 were only expressed by the holo-hormone and, thus were designated conformational antigenic regions (alpha beta). Surface mapping of the free alpha- and beta-subunits was virtually identical to that observed with the holo-hormone. Modification of the operative conditions of mAb reacting only with holo-hTSH shows that they recognize the alpha-subunit, but not the beta-subunit of hTSH. These results indicate that 1) hTSH beta presents epitopes that are evolutionary conserved; 2) hTSH alpha presents several epitopes that are species specific and 2 that are not hormone specific; 3) dissociation of hTSH does not modify the antigenic surface expressed by both subunits when they are associated; and 4) some of the conformational determinants expressed only by holo-hTSH are more likely derived from the alpha-subunit than from the beta-subunit.\r"

  ".U": "87303980\r", 
  ".W": "In teleosts, the pituitary contains a single glycoprotein gonadotropic hormone (GTH) composed of two dissimilar alpha- and beta-subunits. The European eel, Anguilla anguilla L, is sexually immature at the silver stage due to a deficiency in GTH synthesis and secretion. In previous studies we (S.D., YA.F.) have demonstrated a strong stimulatory action of estradiol (E2) on eel pituitary GTH content. In contrast, we (R.C., M.J.) have shown that in the rat E2 negatively regulates gonadotropin subunit synthesis via changes in specific mRNA levels. The purpose of our present work was to check for such effects of E2 on the synthesis of GTH alpha- and beta-subunits in the European eel. Eel pituitary mRNA was translated in a cell-free system in the presence of [35S]Met + Cys. We demonstrate that one of the translated polypeptides, characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography, cross-reacts with an antiserum to denatured bovine alpha-subunit. Its apparent mol wt (18.5K), which is slightly higher than that of the corresponding rat alpha-precursor, suggests that it represents the precursor of the alpha-subunit of eel glycoprotein hormones. The specificity of immunoprecipitation was confirmed by competition with ovine alpha (but not with ovine LH beta or bovine TSH beta). Quantitative evaluation of the putative eel alpha-subunit precursor showed that it represents 0.2% of the total protein translated by RNA from the normal silver eel. Chronic treatment of eels for 3 weeks with 17 beta-E2 increased by 8.0- to 8.5-fold the proportion of the putative alpha-subunit precursor among translation products. Due to the lack of cross-reactivity with the presumed GTH beta precursor, no radioactive material could be specifically detected in translation medium of eel pituitary mRNA using antisera to either denatured bovine LH beta or ovine FSH beta. Our data suggest that E2, depending on vertebrate group and probably on sexual status, may exert either positive or negative control on gonadotropin synthesis by opposite effects on the levels of specific mRNA.\r"

  ".W": "The findings of specific binding of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] in normal rat pituitary tissue and selective effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on gene expression in clonal pituitary tumour cells have suggested that vitamin D may regulate pituitary function. Therefore, the in vitro effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on normal pituitary cells was investigated. Primary anterior pituitary cell cultures prepared from female rats were maintained in experimental medium +/- 10(-8) M 1,25-(OH)2D3 for up to 24 h and then incubated with fresh experimental medium containing TRH (10(-10)-10(-8) M) or vehicle for 1 h. Pretreatment with 1,25-(OH)2D3 for 24 h led to increased TSH release at all TRH concentrations tested (P less than 0.0001), a decrease in the half-maximal stimulatory dose of TRH for TSH release from 2 X 10(-9) M to 0.4 X 10(-9) M, a 22% increase in maximal TSH release (P less than 0.01), and an 81% increase in TSH release at 10(-9) M TRH (P less than 0.001). 1 X 10(-9) M 1,25-(OH)2D3 increased TRH (10(-9) M)-induced TSH release by 20% (P less than 0.05) but 10(-7) M and 10(-6) M 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25-OH D3) had no effect. The effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on TRH (10(-9) M)-induced TSH release was evident within 8 h and was maximal by 16 h. There was no effect on basal TSH release, TSH accumulation in the medium in the preceding 24 h nor on cell-associated TSH. 1,25-(OH)2D3 pretreatment had no effect on TRH-induced PRL secretion, PRL accumulation in the medium nor on cell-associated PRL. We have shown that 1,25-(OH)2D3 acts selectively on the thyrotroph to enhance in vitro responsiveness to physiologically relevant concentrations of TRH. These findings are consistent with the reported autoradiographic localization of [3H]-1,25-(OH)2D3 in the thyrotroph and support a permissive or regulatory role of vitamin D in the normal pituitary gland.\r"

The treatment of cells with ANF (1 X 10(-8)M) resulted in a 3- to 4-fold increase in progesterone secretion compared to the controls. ANF in combination with LH (200 ng/ml) increased progesterone secretion more than six-fold over controls. Concomitantly, ANF stimulated the accumulation of cGMP 30-fold, whereas the level of cAMP was either unchanged or fell slightly (10-15%). Mono[125I]-iodo-ANF bound to G-L cell surface specific receptors with a Kd of 1.8 X 10(-10)M at a density (Bmax) of 160,000-190,000 sites/cell. The binding of [125I]-iodo-ANF was competed by unlabeled ANF in a dose-dependent manner, and hormones unrelated to ANF, such as angiotensins, ACTH or LH, were unable to compete with [125I]-iodo-ANF. The results indicate that ANF can stimulate progesterone secretion and cGMP accumulation in ovarian G-L cells without affecting the level of cAMP and that the stimulatory effects of ANF on G-L cell steroidogenesis may proceed via mechanism(s) involving an intracellular messenger other than cAMP.\r"

Here, we examine the effects that CRF, the principal neurohormone in control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, exerts on pulsatile gonadotropin secretion and the role that the endogenous opioid peptides may play in this phenomenon. Ovariectomized rhesus monkeys were given a 5-h continuous iv infusion of physiological saline (2 ml/h), human CRF (100 micrograms/2 ml . h), or hCRF plus the opiate receptor antagonist naloxone (2 mg/2 ml/h; 5 mg in two experiments; n = 7 experiments/group). LH and FSH concentrations were measured at 15-min intervals for a 3-h preinfusion baseline control, during the 5-h infusion, and during a 2-h postinfusion observation period, while cortisol concentrations were measured at frequent intervals during the entire experiment. CRF infusion produced a progressive and significant decrease in both LH and FSH. Mean areas (+/- SE) under the LH and FSH curves during the 5-h CRF infusion, expressed as a percentage of preinfusion baseline, were 59.9 +/- 4.6% and 83.0 +/- 3.1% (+/- SE), respectively (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.01 vs. saline controls). Large amplitude LH pulses were abolished during the CRF infusion. However, after cessation of CRF infusion, there was a rapid resumption of LH pulsatile release in four of the seven experiments. Addition of naloxone to CRF prevented the CRF-mediated suppression of LH and FSH release. Mean areas for LH and FSH during the 5-h combined infusion were 100.3 +/- 6.6% and 99.6 +/- 4.3% of the preinfusion baseline, respectively (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.05 vs. CRH alone; NS vs. saline), and pulsatile LH secretion was maintained. Regardless of whether naloxone was administered, CRF increased cortisol levels significantly. Mean cortisol levels at the end of the CRF and CRF plus naloxone infusions were 48.2 +/- 10.4 and 52.9 +/- 7.4 micrograms/dl (+/- SE), respectively, compared to 21.0 +/- 3.0 with saline (P less than 0.05). These results demonstrate that in the ovariectomized rhesus monkey, CRF suppresses the secretion of both LH and FSH, and this effect can be sustained. They also indicate that the CRF inhibitory action on gonadotropin is primarily mediated by endogenous opioid peptides, independent of glucocorticoid levels.\r"

Gel filtration, reversed phase HPLC, and ion exchange HPLC indicated that there were similar quantities of immunoactive ANP in the right and left atria at various ages, and that the major molecular form of the peptide in the heart is chromatographically indistinguishable from ANP(1-126). Cultures of dissociated cells were prepared from pooled left and right atria derived from 1 day postnatal animals. A complete serum-free medium was developed which resulted in the maintenance of high levels of immunoactive ANP in the cultures. As determined by RIA, the cellular content of ANP increased in the cultures as a function of time through 7 days in vitro. The quantity of immunoactive ANP in the cultures increased approximately 2- to 3-fold between days 3 and 7. When the cultures that had been maintained for 7 days were submitted to immunocytochemistry using an ANP-specific monoclonal antibody, distinct colonies of spindle-shaped cells stained positively. In situ hybridization, utilizing an 35S-labeled ANP messenger RNA probe, demonstrated that these colonies of myocytes expressed the ANP message. Using quantitative dot-blot hybridization it was shown that the ANP mRNA level increased approximately 50-fold between days 1 and 7 in culture. These studies indicate that the serum-free culture medium allows continued accumulation of both ANP and the ANP message in culture and will provide a useful model system to characterize factors that regulate the biosynthesis and secretion of this hormone.\r"

To investigate the nature and site of such an action, plasma ACTH was measured in four groups of unanesthetized adult female rats with an indwelling carotid cannula. Sequential 300-microliter blood samples were taken 60 min, 30 min, and immediately before an intracerebroventricular (icv) infusion of 2.5 microliter adrenaline or noradrenaline and 5, 15, 45, 60, and 120 min after the infusion. The four groups were: 1) intact rats; 2) rats infused 7 days after undergoing a discrete bilateral lesion of the ventral noradrenergic ascending bundle caused by 6-hydroxydopamine, which depleted their hypothalamic adrenaline and noradrenaline levels by 90% and 80%, respectively; 3) rats infused 30 min after pretreatment via the icv route with either prazosin or propranolol; and 4) rats infused 16 and 2 h after two successive intracarotid injections of an anti-rCRH-41 serum. In another group, the effects of icv catecholamine administration were compared with those of an intracerebral (ic) microinfusion close to a single paraventricular nucleus (PVN). Finally, in two additional groups blood was sampled at the above-mentioned times before and after a 2-min ether inhalation by intact rats or prazosin- and/or propranolol-pretreated rats. In the intact rats (group 1), a stress-like stimulatory dose response was noted after both adrenaline and noradrenaline infusions, with a half-maximal effect at concentrations of about 0.6 nmol and a maximal effect at 2.7 nmol or more. At maximally effective doses, adrenaline was significantly more active than noradrenaline. In the rats with ventral noradrenergic ascending bundle lesions (group 2), 2.7 nM adrenaline or noradrenaline stimulated ACTH release as in the controls without lesions. In group 3, prazosin blocked the ACTH responses to both adrenaline and noradrenaline, whereas propranolol only blocked the response to adrenaline. In group 4, i.e. rats pretreated with an anti-rCRH-41 serum, the amplitude of the ACTH surge after icv adrenaline or noradrenaline infusion was halved. A unilateral ic catecholamine microinfusion next to the PVN (half the icv dose given in group 1) led to a rapid ACTH release that peaked at half the response measured in the icv infused rats. Ether stress-induced ACTH release was decreased by 50-60% after icv pretreatment with 1 or 10 micrograms prazosin, 1 or 6.5 micrograms propranolol, or a combined dose comprising 1 microgram of both. The following conclusions were reached.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The role of calcium in the stimulation of ACTH secretion by CRF and other regulators was studied in rat anterior pituitary cells. Incubation of cultured pituitary cells in normal calcium with CRF, vasopressin, angiotensin II, or norepinephrine increased the rate of ACTH release for up to 45 min and then became constant for up to 3 h. In the absence of extracellular calcium, the initial rate of stimulated secretion was unaffected, but after 45 min the secretion rate decreased by 40% for CRF and to a greater extent for the other stimuli. Addition of calcium after 90 min in calcium-free medium restored the CRF-stimulated ACTH release rate to the control value. The absence of extracellular calcium had no effect on CRF-stimulated cAMP accumulation, but intracellular calcium depletion by preincubation of the cells with EGTA completely inhibited CRF-stimulated cAMP production and ACTH release. The voltage-dependent calcium channel antagonist nitrendipine and the calcium channel agonist BK 8644 had little effect on the CRF-stimulated ACTH release rate, while they, respectively, inhibited and enhanced the stimulation by vasopressin and high potassium. In calcium-depleted cells incubated with the calcium ionophore A23187, CRF stimulation of cAMP production and ACTH release were dependent upon extracellular calcium concentrations from 0.1-100 microM. These findings have defined two phases in the stimulation of ACTH release by CRF and cAMP-independent stimuli in cultured pituitary cells: an early phase with a rapid increase in the ACTH release rate which is independent of extracellular calcium, and a late phase of constant secretion rate, with partial extracellular calcium dependence for the stimulation by CRF and complete calcium dependence for the stimulation by non-cAMP-mediated stimuli.\r"

  ".U": "87304003\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on the spontaneous and TRH-induced TSH release were investigated in vitro on perifused rat pituitaries. The dynamic pattern of TSH release was measured in response to a 6-min pulse of TRH (10 nM) with or without GABA addition. GABA had no effect on spontaneous TSH release but exhibited a dual effect on TSH-stimulated release according to the dose (as calculated by the induced-basal ratio): a potentiation of the TSH response to TRH at the lowest concentrations tested (less than or equal to 10 nM) and an inhibition for GABA concentrations equal or higher than 100 nM. The GABA potentiation was mimicked by muscimol (10 microM) and isoguvacine (10 nM) but not by baclofen (1 microM). Bicucullin (1 microM) or picrotoxin (1 microM) added 15 min before GABA was unable to reverse the GABA potentiation of the TSH response, although SR 95103 (1 and 10 microM), a specific GABA A antagonist, partially or totally antagonized this response. Diazepam (7 nM) was able to potentiate the TSH response by 216% when GABA was added to the system at a concentration (60 nM) which does not modify by itself the TSH response. The inhibitory effect of GABA (100 nM) was completely abolished by bicucullin (1 microM), by picrotoxin (1 microM), and by SR 95103 (1 microM). Picrotoxin not only blocked the inhibitory action of GABA but significantly (P less than 0.05) potentiated the TSH response to TRH. Our data suggest a dual GABA-ergic control of TRH-stimulated TSH release directly on the pituitary, probably mediated by two different kinds of GABA receptors: a GABA A receptor site mediating the inhibitory effect and a nonclassical GABA A receptor site of higher affinity for its stimulatory action.\r"

  ".U": "87304005\r", 
  ".W": "We have shown previously that the rat hypothalamus retains in vitro its capacity of generating pulsatile release of GnRH. The present study evaluated if pulsatile release of GnRH in vitro was influenced by metabolic conditions (calcium and glucose availability) and the possible self-regulatory role of GnRH in its pulsatile secretion. In the presence of a calcium-chelating agent (EGTA, 20 mM) or a calcium-channel blocker (D-600, 0.1 mM), the release of GnRH induced by a depolarization (veratridine, 50 microM) was markedly and reversibly decreased. In addition, frequency and amplitude of GnRH secretory pulses were significantly reduced (P less than 0.05). When glucose use was inhibited using 2-deoxyglucose (5.6 mM) the release of GnRH induced by veratridine and the frequency of GnRH pulses were also blunted (P less than 0.05). Superactive agonists of GnRH (Buserelin and D-TRP6-PRO9-N-ET, 10 nM) caused a prompt decrease of GnRH release in basal conditions and in the presence of veratridine. A significant inhibition (P less than 0.05) was observed using buserelin concentrations greater than 0.01 nM, whereas two GnRH analogs without biopotency (Leu8-GnRH, Des-gly10-N picolylamide GnRH, 100 nM) did not affect GnRH release. The two agonists of GnRH reduced by 43% to 66% (P less than 0.05) the occurrence of significant GnRH pulses. We conclude that, in vitro, the hypothalamic neuronal circuitry resulting in GnRH pulsatile secretion is dependent on calcium and glucose availability and is sensitive to an ultrashort-loop inhibitory feedback mechanism.\r"

  ".U": "87304078\r", 
  ".W": "The objective of the study was to determine whether contemporary feline models of petit mal (systemic penicillin epilepsy) or temporal lobe epilepsy (amygdala kindling) resemble human seizure disorders with respect to disturbances of sleep and waking states, the state dependency of seizures, and transference of seizure susceptibility. These variables were examined in 6-h polygraphic recordings before and during exposure to both seizure models in 24 cats; 12 cats had intramuscular (i.m.) injections of 300,000 or 400,000 IU/kg of penicillin prior to kindling, and 12 were kindled before penicillin challenge. Results were as follows. First, penicillin increased light slow wave sleep (SWS) and drowsiness, during which spike-wave (SW) activity was maximal. Generalized tonic-clonic convulsions (GTCs) occurred predominantly in drowsiness after awakening from SWS. Second, kindling produced more deep SWS than did penicillin; susceptibility to kindled GTCs peaked during deep SWS, especially in transition to rapid eye movement sleep (REM). Third, penicillin did not influence subsequent sleep disorders or seizure susceptibility during kindling; kindling interfered with penicillin-induced GTCs, SW activity, and sleep disorders. Collectively, the findings suggest distinct state disorders and state-dependent seizure profiles in the two models. These differences parallel human analogues and may have contributed to the transference results. Kindling is a chronic model with persistent sleep and seizure abnormalities that differ from and may have discouraged penicillin epilepsy. Penicillin is an acute model with transient state and seizure disorders, a fact that may account for the absence of penicillin transference to kindling.\r"

  ".U": "87304090\r", 
  ".W": "The clinical identification of neonatal seizures is critical for the recognition of brain dysfunction; however, diagnosis is often difficult because of the poorly organized and varied nature of these behaviors. Current classification systems are limited in their ability to communicate motor, autonomic, and electroencephalographic features of seizures precisely and to provide a basis for uniform effective diagnosis, therapy, and determination of prognosis. Recent investigations of neonates, utilizing bedside electroencephalographic/polygraphic/video monitoring techniques, have provided the basis for improved diagnosis and classification of seizures in the newborn. These studies have demonstrated that not all clinical phenomena currently considered to be seizures require electrocortical epileptiform activity for their initiation or elaboration. In addition, the specific clinical character of the phenomena considered to be seizures, the clinical state of the infant, and the character of the EEG indicate the probable pathophysiological mechanisms involved and suggest probable etiologies, prognosis, and therapy. Similarities between animal models that demonstrate reflex physiology and neonates with motor automatisms and tonic posturing suggest that these clinical behaviors may not be epileptic in origin but, rather, primitive movements of progression and posture mediated by brainstem mechanisms. Although not all clinical behaviors currently considered to be neonatal seizures may have similar pathophysiological mechanisms, they are clinically significant because they all indicate brain dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "In vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) and gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) are used to treat intractable infertility in women with no distortion of the pelvic viscera, despite the lack of controlled trials demonstrating efficacy. The mechanism of any purportedly enhanced cycle fecundity in ovulatory women without significant distortion of the pelvic viscera is unclear, but both GIFT and IVF-ET increase the number of male and female gametes at the site of fertilization. Intrauterine insemination (IUI) during human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG)-stimulated superovulatory cycles has similar potential but does not require oocyte retrieval. To evaluate the possibility that simply increasing the number of gametes at the site of fertilization might account for pregnancies attributed to IVF-ET and GIFT, the authors retrospectively analyzed the outcome of couples undergoing IUI during hMG cycles between 1983 and 1986 in women with normal pelvic anatomy. IUI during hMG-stimulated cycles yielded a cycle fecundity (f) of 0.17 for endometriosis, 0.29 for cervical factor, and 0.19 for idiopathic infertility, which approaches the fecundity of normal women and equals or exceeds that reported for IVF-ET and GIFT. The authors conclude that treatment with IUI in hMG cycles, alleviating the need for invasive oocyte retrieval, should be considered for inclusion in a randomized, controlled trial in comparison with IVF-ET and GIFT.\r"

The hFSH protocol was associated with significantly more uniform folliculogenesis and more effective steroidogenesis than the one using hMG. In addition, the hFSH protocol showed a trend toward more oocytes per laparoscopy and more embryos per transfer than the hMG group, although the difference was not statistically significant. More oocytes in the hMG group were classified as immature when compared with the hFSH group (P less than 0.05). Pregnancy rates in both groups were not significantly different. An allergic drug reaction that occurred in one patient on the hFSH protocol is the first such reaction reported with hFSH in the literature. The hFSH protocol is associated with a trend toward parameters that correlate with improved success rates in the IVF-ET program.\r"

Thirty-one patients undergoing induction of ovulation in an in vitro fertilization (IVF) unit participated in the study. From day 3 of the menstrual cycle until the day of hCG administration, morning blood samples and morning urine specimens were collected for the determination of serum 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and urine E1-3-G, respectively. A good correlation was noted between E2 measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and the E1-3-G measured by chemiluminescence immunoassay (CIA), from day 5 up to the day of hCG administration (0.6 less than r less than 0.85, P less than 0.001). It is evident from this study that the CIA measurement of E1-3-G in morning urine is an accurate and rapid (2.5 hours) method and is convenient for monitoring induction of ovulation with human menopausal gonadotropins.\r"

Specific monoclonal antibodies were used in an indirect immunoperoxidase technique. In normal tissues, T lymphocytes (Leu 4-positive cells) were present in the rete testis with a preponderance of cells of the suppressor/cytotoxic phenotype. In contrast, no lymphocytes were detected within the peripheral portions of the testis. Cells reacting with the anti-Leu M3 monoclonal antibody, which defines monocytes/macrophages, were detected in appreciable numbers in peripheral testis with a specific location around the seminiferous tubules. HLA-DR-positive cells (human leukocyte antigens--class II [DR] determinants of the major histocompatibility complex) also were identified and showed a similar pattern of distribution to that of the Leu-M3 positive cells. While no lymphocytes were seen in the normal peripheral testis, T lymphocytes were detected in testicular biopsies from subfertile patients. Suppressor/cytotoxic T cells (Leu 2a-positive) predominated in patients with oligozoospermia and obstructive azoospermia while T cells of the helper/inducer phenotype predominated in patients with unilateral testicular obstruction and in postvasectomy patients. Sperm antibody measurements correlated with these findings.\r"

Three days before and 3 days after treatment, monkeys received vehicle alone. On experiment days 4, 7, 10, 13, and 16, 100 micrograms of GnRH was administered intravenously (IV) and blood drawn at 0 and 30 minutes. Before treatment, tonic follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were 248 +/- 105 and 178 +/- 31 ng/ml, respectively; after 0.3 mg/kg/day of GnRH antagonist, FSH and LH decreased to 30 +/- 6 and 41 +/- 4 ng/ml, respectively. After treatment with either 1 mg/kg/day or 3 mg/kg/day of GnRH antagonist, both gonadotropins were undetectable in serum. Monkeys with lower initial levels of gonadotropins were suppressed by 48 hours after GnRH antagonist, while those with higher tonic gonadotropins were suppressed 6 days later (FSH: r = 0.992; LH: r = 0.833). The data show that initial physiologic status is predictive of the rapidity of the suppression response induced by a GnRH antagonist and that, after achieving pituitary suppression, responsivity to an IV GnRH challenge test may be restored before normal tonic FSH/LH secretion is regained.\r"

Gastrointestinal ulceration in prostaglandin E2-immunized rabbits was not prevented by oral enprostil. Gastrointestinal ulcers occurred as early as 6 wk after beginning immunization and often perforated with resulting fatality. Neither prostaglandin E2 antibodies nor ulcers developed in rabbits immunized with thyroglobulin vehicle (controls). Passive immunization of unimmunized rabbits with prostaglandin E2-hyperimmune plasma led to acute gastric ulcers within 9 days, whereas passive transfer of nonimmune plasma did not produce ulcers. This latter finding suggests that prostaglandin E2 antibodies per se were responsible for ulcer formation.\r"

  ".W": "Endoscopy is commonly used in the management of patients with radiographically benign gastric ulcers to detect occult malignancy. Clinical studies examining the cost-effectiveness of using endoscopy in such patients, however, have not been done. To address this issue using probability analysis, a probability tree was designed incorporating the possible clinical courses of patients with radiographically benign gastric ulcers managed with and without endoscopy, and probability estimates for each course were derived by compiling data from the literature. Probability and sensitivity analysis was used to compare the impact on overall mortality rate and cost-effectiveness of six commonly practiced methods of using endoscopy to manage patients with radiographically benign gastric ulcers: (1) all follow-up by upper gastrointestinal x-ray only; (2) endoscopy for nonhealing ulcers only; (3) endoscopy for all ulcers before medical therapy with all follow-up by upper gastrointestinal x-ray; (4) endoscopy for all ulcers after an initial trial of medical therapy; (5) endoscopy for all ulcers before therapy and for nonhealers; (6) endoscopy before therapy, and all follow-up by endoscopy. This analysis predicts that the greatest decrease in mortality rate occurs when endoscopy is used before medical therapy and for all follow-up, reducing the estimated number of deaths per 1000 patients with radiographically benign gastric ulcers from 36.7 with follow-up by upper gastrointestinal x-ray only to 27.2. However, initial endoscopy with all subsequent follow-up by upper gastrointestinal x-ray increased the overall death rate by only a small amount, to 28.0, and was consistently the most cost-effective method, requiring 116 endoscopies and approximately 60,000 diagnostic dollars per additional 5-yr survivor.\r"

We have attempted to analyse this practical problem by using an in vivo perfusion technique in healthy volunteers to study Na+, water and nutrient absorption from a short (25 cm) segment of jejunum during perfusion of an isotonic solution of the elemental diet Vivonex. Further solutions made from the amino acid and carbohydrate components of Vivonex were also perfused in part I of the study in order to determine the causes of the marked Na+ and water secretion seen during Vivonex perfusion. Low initial Na+ concentration was found to be the major determinant of net Na+ secretion, initial Na+ concentration correlating significantly with Na+ absorption (r = 0.95, n = 7 p less than 0.001). Water absorption correlated with net absorption of NaCl (r = 0.82, n = 7 p less than 0.01). There was, however, a better correlation with total absorption of NaCl plus amino acids (r = 0.99, n = 7, p less than 0.01). In part II of the study separate isotonic solutions of NaCl, glucose, and the polymeric diet, Ensure were also studied. Net sodium secretion occurred during glucose and Ensure perfusion, as predicted from their low Na+ concentration. Owing to rapid sucrose absorption from Ensure there was substantial luminal disappearance of osmotically active particles and hence marked water absorption, which was accurately predicted using the regression equation for water absorption derived in part I, substituting sucrose absorption for amino acid absorption.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Weight gain was significantly less in the group fed Vivonex HN than that of any other groups. The bulkless Vivonex HN and Ensure increased proximal jejunal mass compared to Enrich with 9% bulk or to normal rat chow. Jejunal mucosal DNA and protein levels also tended to be higher in Ensure and Vivonex HN fed animals, as was jejunal sugar absorption. In the terminal ileum, however, total weight was decreased by both elemental and complete feeds with and without bulk, but particularly by the elemental diet. Bulkless feeds therefore increase jejunal and reduce terminal ileal mass. The striking atrophy of the terminal ileum produced by the elemental diet may be important for its efficacy in treating inflammatory bowel disease.\r"

The expression of 4F2 and T9 antigens was greatly increased--in the peripheral blood and in the intestinal lamina propria whereas the proportion of interleukin-2 receptor bearing cells was much less pronounced. The counts of early activation antigens bearing cells in the lamina propria were quite comparable with those of the autologous peripheral cells. In the peripheral blood counts of 4F2 and T9 positive cells were very high in patients with active Crohn's disease but patients with quiescent disease also had a significantly raised proportion of 4F2 and T9 bearing cells. Only in those patients with no evidence of macroscopic disease (namely those resected without recurrence) the counts of early activation antigens bearing cells were within the normal range. The in vitro mitogen induced expression of early activation antigens on either peripheral and intestinal mononuclear cells of patients with Crohn's disease proved to be both quantitatively and qualitatively similar to that of the controls showing the full expression of 4F2, transferrin receptor, and interleukin-2 receptor. While demonstrating that in Crohn's disease there was no intrinsic defect of generation and expression of growth factors receptors by peripheral and intestinal lymphocytes, these results showed that there was a divergence in the expression of early activation antigens in vivo and in vitro.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The NE infusion was continued at the highest dose and an additional infusion of sodium nitroprusside was started to titrate mean BP in 30-minute intervals down to control values; a mean sodium nitroprusside dose of 0.95 micrograms/kg/min restored mean BP to 93 +/- 4 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), decreased plasma immunoreactive ANP to basal values (51 +/- 4 pg/ml; p less than 0.001), increased heart rate (p less than 0.001), and left plasma levels of NE largely unchanged. Plasma protein and hematocrit rose about 5 to 6% (p less than 0.001) during the NE infusion and then decreased about 3 to 4% (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.01) when sodium nitroprusside was added.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Blacks showed a 13.9% higher erythrocyte Na+ (7.63 +/- 0.19 vs 6.70 +/- 0.11 [SEM] mEq/L; p = 0.0001) and a 16.1% lower erythrocyte ghost Na+,K+-ATPase activity (140.3 +/- 4.2 vs 167.3 +/- 4.7 nmol inorganic phosphate/mg protein/hr; p = 0.0002) than whites. Male subjects demonstrated a 6.4% higher erythrocyte Na+ (7.35 +/- 0.17 vs 6.91 +/- 0.14 mEq/L; p = 0.043) and an 11.5% lower Na+,K+-ATPase activity (145.7 +/- 3.7 vs 164.7 +/- 5.5 nmol inorganic phosphate/mg protein/hr; p = 0.0015) than female subjects. Significant (p less than 0.001) negative correlations were identified for the systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure levels and the erythrocyte ghost Na+,K+-ATPase. These findings were complemented by positive correlations for the blood pressure levels and erythrocyte Na+ concentrations. The body mass index was negatively correlated with erythrocyte ghost Na+,K+-ATPase and it accounted for 6.7%, 5.6%, and 6.1% of the variabilities in the systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure levels, respectively. Variabilities of 1.4% systolic, 12.3% diastolic, and 11.1% in mean arterial pressure were attributable to the erythrocyte ghost Na+,K+-ATPase activity. Provided that findings in erythrocytes also reflect the relative status of the vascular smooth muscle cell Na+,K+-ATPase, the predisposition of black, male, and obese persons to hypertension may relate, among other factors, to a lower activity of this enzyme system, which results in an increased vascular tone.\r"

Measurement of immunoreactive ANP in plasma provided a sensitive marker for the severity of hypertension and the associated cardiac overload. Long-term treatment with nisoldipine prevented the development of hypertension, the associated heart failure, and the increase of plasma levels of ANP in SHR but had no effect on systolic blood pressure, heart weight, and plasma levels of ANP in WKY. In addition, nisoldipine had a therapeutic effect in old SHR with manifest cardiac failure in end-stage hypertension, as evidenced not only by the reduction of blood pressure but also by the reduction of cardiac hypertrophy, of elevated immunoreactive ANP in plasma, and of increased plasma renin activity.\r"

We investigated the effects of specific rabbit antiserum against alpha-rat atrial natriuretic peptide on hemodynamics, diuresis, and natriuresis in anesthetized rats. A significant rise in mean blood pressure lasted for about 60 minutes after intravenous administration of the antiserum, with the maximal increment being approximately 7%. Similarly, a significant increase in cardiac output was obtained 20 minutes after injection at an increment of approximately 11%. Heart rate, however, remained unchanged. On the other hand, significant reductions in urine output and urinary sodium and potassium excretion lasted for about 20 minutes after administration of the antiserum, with maximal decrements being 63%, 63%, and 60%, respectively. No significant effects on hemodynamics, diuresis, and natriuresis were observed following injection of normal rabbit serum. These results indicate that endogenous atrial natriuretic peptide has an important physiological role in the regulation of hemodynamics and water-electrolyte balance.\r"

Multipoint pulmonary vascular pressure-cardiac index (P/Q) plots were constructed during normoxia in conscious dogs by step-wise constriction of the thoracic inferior vena cava to reduce Q. In intact dogs, bradykinin (2 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1 iv) caused systemic vasodilation, i.e., systemic arterial pressure was slightly decreased (P less than 0.05), Q was markedly increased (P less than 0.01), and mixed venous PO2 and oxygen saturation (SO2) were increased (P less than 0.01). Bradykinin decreased (P less than 0.01) the pulmonary vascular pressure gradient (pulmonary arterial pressure-pulmonary capillary wedge pressure) over the entire range of Q studied (140-60 ml X min-1 X kg-1) in intact dogs. During cyclooxygenase pathway inhibition with indomethacin, bradykinin again decreased (P less than 0.05) pulmonary arterial pressure-pulmonary capillary wedge pressure at every level of Q, although the magnitude of the vasodilator response was diminished at lower levels of Q (60 ml X min-1 X kg-1). Following combined administration of sympathetic beta-adrenergic and -cholinergic receptor antagonists, bradykinin still decreased (P less than 0.01) pulmonary arterial pressure-pulmonary capillary wedge pressure over the range of Q from 160 to 60 ml X min-1 X kg-1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The interactive effects of upper airway negative pressure and hypercapnia on the pattern of breathing were assessed in pentobarbital-anesthetized cats. At any given level of pressure in the upper airway, hypercapnia increased respiratory rate, reduced inspiratory time, and augmented tidal volume, inspiratory airflow, and the peak and rate of rise of diaphragm electrical activity. Conversely, at any given level of CO2, upper airway negative pressure decreased respiratory rate, prolonged inspiratory time, and depressed inspiratory airflow and diaphragm electromyogram (EMG) rate of rise. Application of negative pressure to the upper airway shifted the relationship between tidal volume and inspiratory time upward and rightward. The relationship between inspiratory and expiratory times, however, was linearly correlated over a wide range of chemical drives and levels of upper airway pressure. These results suggest that in the anesthetized cat upper airway negative pressure afferent inputs 1) interact in an additive fashion with hypercapnia to alter the pattern of breathing, 2) interact multiplicatively with CO2 to influence mean inspiratory airflow and diaphragm EMG rate of rise, 3) depress the generation of central inspiratory activity, 4) increase the time-dependent volume threshold for inspiratory termination, and 5) affect the ratio between inspiratory and expiratory times in a similar manner as alterations in PCO2.\r"

We wished to determine whether the presence of the VT plateau is due to a tachypneic influence related to very high levels of exercise or whether it represents a stereotypic response of the respiratory system at high levels of VI. We therefore compared breathing pattern in six subjects during maximal incremental exercise (ME) with that in the same subjects when similar levels of VI were obtained by a combination of submaximal exercise and hypercapnia (E/CO2). A VT plateau was seen in all ME and E/CO2 tests. There was no significant difference in the level of the VT plateau between the ME (2.93 +/- 0.17 liters) and E/CO2 (2.97 +/- 0.12 liters) tests. We conclude that the presence and level of the VT plateau during ME is not due to a tachypneic stimulus related to very high levels of exercise but is a function of the level of VI.\r"

The maximal levels of cAMP occurred at far less than maximal levels of cyclooxygenase products. Next, we infused A 23187 to release endogenous pulmonary AA. This led to elevations in cAMP that were from conversion of this endogenous AA to cyclooxygenase products. The level of these products was far less than maximal levels from exogenous AA. However, maximal levels of cAMP from conversion of endogenous AA were similar to maximal levels of cAMP from conversion of exogenous AA. We conclude that maximal levels of pulmonary cAMP from endogenous or exogenous AA are from conversion of the AA to far less than maximal levels of pulmonary cyclooxygenase products. This indicates that levels of cAMP rather than levels of cyclooxygenase products are a potential rate-limiting step in cAMP-linked pulmonary actions of such products from pulmonary conversion of endogenous or exogenous AA.\r"

Performance of reasoning tasks, such as AB logic problems, was significantly slowed at the higher levels of CO2, with a threshold at end-tidal PCO2 close to 51 Torr. Accuracy of reasoning and short-term memory were not significantly affected. More prolonged studies with inhalation of 6.5% CO2 showed that after the first 10 min ventilation tended to increase, end-tidal PCO2 to fall, and slowing of reasoning to recover, but substantial decrement in performance continued for 80 min, by which time performance virtually stabilized. On return to air breathing, preexposure performance was resumed within 10 min. Also caused by 6.5% CO2 was a significant rise in subjectively assessed irritability and discomfort, with no significant change in alertness or in either registration or recall of long-term memory.\r"

The diaphragmatic force was assessed from transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) developed at functional residual capacity against an occluded airway during cervical phrenic nerve stimulation. In a first group of five dogs, Pdi-stimulus frequency relationships were compared before and after administration of ouabain in doses of 0.01, 0.02, and 0.04 mg/kg. In a second group, diaphragmatic fatigue was produced by bilateral phrenic nerve stimulation at 30 Hz. Ten seconds of stimulation and 15 s of mechanical ventilation were repeated for 30 min. The rates of decrease in Pdi were compared between two groups, one of 0.05 mg/kg deslanoside-treated dogs (n = 7) and one of nontreated dogs (n = 7). After ouabain administration Pdi was significantly greater at each frequency in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, the rate of decrease in Pdi in the deslanoside group was significantly smaller than that in the nontreated group, whereas deslanoside did not greatly change the Pdi-frequency curves in fresh diaphragm. We conclude that ouabain improves contractility of the fresh diaphragm and that deslanoside has a protective effect against fatigability.\r"

Both tracers disappeared in a monoexponential fashion over 30 min with calculated first-order rate constants (control; n = 11) of 0.0008 +/- 0.0002 and 0.0027 +/- 0.0008 min-1 for inulin and mannitol, respectively. The ratio of the rate constants (3.1 +/- 0.5) was not significantly different from the ratio of diffusivities of mannitol:inulin (3.7). Addition of PMA (250 micrograms) significantly (n = 9, P less than 0.05) increased the rate constants for both inulin and mannitol to 0.0024 +/- 0.0007 and 0.0087 +/- 0.0025 min-1, respectively, while not affecting their ratio (4.3 +/- 0.5). Addition of human leukocytes (4-8 X 10(8)/l) to the perfusate did not exacerbate the effect of 250 micrograms PMA (n = 3). The addition of catalase (n = 7) completely inhibited the effect of 250 micrograms PMA. PMA (250 micrograms) did not significantly affect perfusion pressure but increased wet-to-dry weight ratios. Light microscopic histology showed damage to epithelial and endothelial cells after 250 micrograms PMA which was not seen after coinstillation of catalase. Catalase sensitivity of functional and structural effects of PMA suggests that the effect was secondary to production of hydrogen peroxide. Since this effect was noted in lungs not perfused with neutrophils and addition of leukocytes did not exacerbate the increase in permeability, we hypothesize that an undetermined pulmonary cell type was the source of hydrogen peroxide. Finally, we found no evidence for restrictive pores with radii of 0.4-1.4 nm.\r"

  ".W": "High-frequency chest percussion (HFP) with constant fresh gas flow (VBF) at the tracheal carina is a variant of high-frequency ventilation (HFV) previously shown to be effective with extremely low tracheal oscillatory volumes (approximately 0.1 ml/kg). We studied the effects of VBF on gas exchange during HFP. In eight anesthetized and paralyzed dogs we measured arterial and alveolar partial pressures of CO2 (PaCO2) and O2 (PaO2) during total body vibration at a frequency of 30 Hz, amplitude of 0.17 +/- 0.019 cm, and tidal volume of 1.56 +/- 0.58 ml. VBF was incrementally varied from 0.1 to 1.2 l.kg-1.min-1. At low flows (0.1-0.4 l.kg-1.min-1), gas exchange was strongly dependent on flow rate but became essentially flow independent with higher VBF (i.e., hyperbolic pattern). At VBF greater than 0.4 l.kg-1.min-1, hyperventilatory blood gas levels were consistently sustained (i.e., PaCO2 less than 20 Torr, PaO2 greater than 90 Torr). The resistance to CO2 transport of the airways was 1.785 +/- 0.657 l-1.kg.min and was independent of VBF. The alveolar-arterial difference of O2 was also independent of the flow. In four of five additional dogs studied as a control group, where constant flow of O2 was used without oscillations, the pattern of PaCO2 vs. VBF was also hyperbolic but at substantially higher levels of PaCO2. It is concluded that, in the range of VBF used, intraairway gas exchange was limited by the 30-Hz vibration. The fresh gas flow was important only to maintain near atmospheric conditions at the tracheal carina.\r"

Fibrinogen (6-10 mg/ml) dissolved in 0.055 M sodium citrate was injected into the cisterna magna of six New Zealand White rabbits. Six additional rabbits were injected with saline to control for the effects of intracranial hypertension and pulmonary vascular hypertension. The fibrinogen-sodium citrate solution or sodium citrate alone, as opposed to saline, produced systemic and pulmonary vascular hypertension, pulmonary edema, hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and acidosis. The lungs from fibrinogen-injected rabbits were edematous, congested, and liverlike in appearance. Tracheal froth that was blood tinged and protein rich was present in five of the six rabbits. Microscopic examination of lung biopsies revealed erythrocytes and plasma in the alveoli and focal injury to the pulmonary microvascular endothelium. Fibrinogen-sodium citrate increased (P less than 0.05) the extravascular lung water (EVLW) (10.3 +/- 2.0 vs. 5.5 +/- 0.6 g, means +/- SE), lung blood weight (9.7 +/- 1.3 vs. 3.8 +/- 0.6 g), total dry lung weight (3.2 +/- 0.4 vs. 2.0 +/- 0.1 g), and the EVLW-to-blood-free dry lung weight ratio (7.0 +/- 0.8 vs. 4.0 +/- 0.3 g) from saline-control values. There was no difference in the blood-fre dry lung weight (1.4 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.3 +/- 0.1 g) between the two groups. These findings demonstrate that pulmonary congestion, pulmonary vascular hypertension, and focal endothelial injury contribute to the development of NPE.\r"

During hypovolemia, reflex increases in mesenteric arterial tone may preferentially reduce gut blood flow so that the onset of O2 supply dependence occurs in the gut before other regions. We compared the critical O2 delivery (QO2c) and critical extraction ratio (ERc) of whole body and an isolated segment (30-50 g) of small bowel in seven anesthetized paralyzed dogs ventilated with room air. Systemic QO2 was reduced in stages by controlled hemorrhage as arterial O2 content was maintained, and systemic and gut VO2 and QO2 were measured at each stage. Body QO2c was 7.9 +/- 1.9 ml X kg-1 X min-1 (ERc = 0.69 +/- 0.12), whereas gut O2 supply dependency occurred when gut QO2 was 34.3 +/- 11.3 ml X min-1 X kg gut wt-1 (ERc = 0.63 +/- 0.09). O2 supply dependency in the gut occurred at a higher systemic QO2 (9.7 +/- 2.7) than whole-body QO2c (P less than 0.05). The extraction ratio at the final stage (maximal ER) was less in the gut (0.80 +/- 0.05) than whole body (0.87 +/- 0.06). Thus during reductions in systemic QO2, gut VO2 was maintained by increases in gut extraction of O2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Although the influence of altitude acclimatization on respiration has been carefully studied, the associated changes in hypoxic and hypercapnic ventilatory responses are the subject of controversy with neither response being previously evaluated during sleep at altitude. Therefore, six healthy males were studied at sea level and on nights 1, 4, and 7 after arrival at altitude (14,110 ft). During wakefulness, ventilation and the ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia were determined on each occasion. During both non-rapid-eye-movement and rapid-eye-movement sleep, ventilation, ventilatory pattern, and the hypercapnic ventilatory response (measured at ambient arterial O2 saturation) were determined. There were four primary observations from this study: 1) the hypoxic ventilatory response, although similar to sea level values on arrival at altitude, increased steadily with acclimatization up to 7 days; 2) the slope of the hypercapnic ventilatory response increased on initial exposure to a hypoxic environment (altitude) but did not increase further with acclimatization, although the position of this response shifted steadily to the left (lower PCO2 values); 3) the sleep-induced decrements in both ventilation and hypercapnic responsiveness at altitude were equivalent to those observed at sea level with similar acclimatization occurring during wakefulness and sleep; and 4) the quantity of periodic breathing during sleep at altitude was highly variable and tended to occur more frequently in individuals with higher ventilatory responses to both hypoxia and hypercapnia.\r"

VT was normalized to anatomic plus instrument dead space (VT/VD) for analysis. Arterial PCO2 was maintained at or below CV levels by HFV with VT/VD less than 0.5 and fR = 9 and 12 s-1 but not at fR = 6 s-1. For 0.4 less than or equal to VT/VD less than or equal to 0.85 and 3 s-1. less than or equal to fR less than or equal to 12 s-1, increased VT/VD was twice as effective as increased fR at decreasing arterial PCO2, consistent with oscillatory dispersion in a branching network being an important gas transport mechanism in birds on HFV. Ventilation of proximal exchange units with fresh gas due to laminar flow is not the necessary mechanism supporting gas exchange in HFV, since exchange could be maintained with VT/VD less than 0.5. Interclavicular and posterior thoracic air sac ventilation measured by helium washout did not change as much as expired minute ventilation during HFV. PCO2 was equal in both air sacs during HFV. These results could be explained by alterations in aerodynamic valving and flow patterns with HFV. Ventilation-perfusion distributions measured by the multiple inert gas elimination technique show increased inhomogeneity with HFV. Elimination of soluble gases was also enhanced in HFV as reported for mammals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

With the dynamic end-tidal CO2 forcing technique the ventilatory response after a square-wave change in end-tidal PCO2 (PETCO2) was partitioned into a central and a peripheral part using a two-compartment model. With almitrine administered intravenously (0.6 mg/kg followed by a maintenance dose of 0.4 mg.kg-1 X h-1) the CO2 sensitivity of the peripheral chemoreflex increased on the average from 0.315 to 0.564 l.min-1 X kPa-1 (P less than 0.001, 6 cats, 73 runs), whereas the CO2 sensitivity of the central chemoreflex remained the same (P = 0.87). The extrapolated PETCO2 at zero ventilation (apneic threshold) of the (total) steady-state response curve decreased on the average from 3.50 to 2.36 kPa (P less than 0.001). With the artificial brain stem perfusion technique it was confirmed that almitrine did not affect ventilation by administering it to the blood perfusing the brain stem. We conclude that almitrine bismesylate during normoxia enhances the CO2 sensitivity of the peripheral chemoreflex loop and decreases the apneic threshold due to an action located outside the brain stem.\r"

The results were analyzed to determine which factors most closely related to ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) during exercise. Heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), oxygen uptake (VO2), minute ventilation (VE), and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) were evaluated at rest, 3.0 mph/0% grade, the gas exchange anaerobic threshold (ATge), 80% of placebo maximal O2 uptake, and maximal exercise. Both beta-adrenergic and calcium channel blockade significantly reduced heart rate and systolic blood pressure relative to placebo; these effects were more profound during beta-adrenergic blockade and as exercise progressed. Correlation coefficients and estimates of slope were derived for changes in RPE during exercise vs. changes in HR, VO2, VE, and VCO2 during the three treatments (r = 0.76 to 0.92, P less than 0.001). Although RPE was significantly correlated with HR during placebo and diltiazem therapy (r = 0.45, P less than 0.01), this was not the case during beta-adrenergic blockade (r = 0.31, NS). Slope of the regression lines between RPE and VO2, VE, and VCO2 did not differ between the three treatments. Slope of the regression lines between RPE and HR differed only during calcium channel blockade. Because the presence of atrial fibrillation and beta-adrenergic blockade altered the associations between RPE, VO2, and HR, these results suggest that VE is more closely related to RPE than the other parameters.\r"

Analysis of the plasma GH response to GHRH was performed in 394 validated prepubertal children; these children were subdivided into 3 groups according to the degree of GH deficiency assessed within 6 months by conventional provocative tests (insulin, arginine, etc.): normal GH status (n = 210), partial GH deficiency (n = 73), or severe GH deficiency (n = 111). The mean peak GH values (+/- 2 SEM) after GHRH treatment in the three groups were 45.8 +/- 4.8, 29.2 +/- 6.3, and 16.8 +/- 3.1 microU/mL, respectively, and were greater than those after the conventional tests. The GH responses were consistent with the degree of GH deficiency based on the responses to the conventional tests. In addition, the areas under the GH response curves in the three groups were significantly different (P less than 0.0001). Among children with severe idiopathic GH deficiency 77% had a peak plasma GH level after GHRH above 10.0 microU/mL and 39% had a peak GH above 20.0 microU/mL. In these children, a single GHRH injection provides information on both their GH secretory capacity and the putative supresellar etiology of their GH deficiency, and may be of potential therapeutic value.\r"

The concentrations of LH, FSH, PRL, and the prostanoids prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), PGF2 alpha, PGI2 (as 6-oxo-PGF2 alpha), and thromboxane A2 (as TXB2) in the FF were measured by RIA and related to the degree of maturation of the oocyte-corona-cumulus complex mass (OCCC). FF obtained from follicles with immature OCCC contained significantly lower concentrations of all four prostanoids (median concentrations, picograms per mL: PGE2, 88; PGF2 alpha, 85; 6-oxo-PGF1 alpha, 40; TXB2, 50) than those with intermediate OCCC (PGE2, 175; PGF2 alpha, 325; 6-oxo-PGF1 alpha, 130; TXB2, 65) and mature OCCC (PGE2, 425; PGF2 alpha, 860; 6-oxo-PGF1 alpha, 235; TXB2, 78; all P less than 0.01). There were no significant differences between the maturity of the complexes and the concentrations of LH, FSH, or PRL. There were significant correlations between the FF concentrations of LH and FSH and those of all of the prostanoids, but not with PRL, concentrations. These results indicate that the synthesis of prostanoids in the human Graafian follicles may be modulated by gonadotropins and consolidates the view that prostanoids may play a role in human oocyte maturation and ovulation.\r"

  ".W": "Leydig cells were purified on discontinuous Percoll gradients after collagenase digestion of human or rat testes. Leydig cells from both species were found in three bands. As determined by positive staining for 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, band 1 (lowest density cells) from both species contained only 12-28% Leydig cells. However, while band 3 was the most Leydig cell-enriched fraction in rat cell preparations (70-90% Leydig cells), human band 2 (48-70% Leydig cells) was consistently more Leydig cell enriched than was band 3 (30-56% Leydig cells). Despite their slightly different fractionation pattern, Leydig cells prepared from five men with prostatic carcinoma were similar to those from the rat, both in terms of the amount of testosterone produced basally per 10(6) Leydig cells (80-234 ng/20 h) and in terms of the magnitude of their response to hCG (764-1342 ng/10(6) Leydig cells X 20 h; 5- to 17-fold stimulation above basal). Cells prepared from five other men with prostatic carcinoma produced much lower amounts of testosterone, but still had up to a 6-fold response to hCG. Plasma LH, FSH, and testosterone concentrations in the latter group could not be distinguished from those in the group whose Leydig cells produced large amounts of testosterone in vitro. Morphologically, the testes from the latter group appeared to contain more darkly staining than lightly staining Leydig cells than did the former group. Rat Leydig cells responded in a dose-dependent fashion to hCG over the range 0.03-0.5 mU/mL, whereas human Leydig cells were 10- to 100-fold less sensitive, responding to hCG in the range 0.4-100 mU/mL. The number and affinity of Leydig cell LH (hCG) receptors were assessed from Scatchard analysis of [125I]hCG binding. Compared with rat cells, human Leydig cells contained approximately 20% of the number of LH receptors, while the affinity of the receptors (Kd, approximately 10(-10) M) was similar to that in rats. In conclusion, a method for the isolation of highly responsive human Leydig cells has been developed. The results so far suggest that the function of human Leydig cells may be more similar to that of the rat than thought previously.\r"

In this study the effects of PD (60 mg, orally) on both basal and GHRH (1 microgram/kg)-induced GH secretion in seven children with familial short stature (FSS), six with GH deficiency (GHD) and 10 with constitutional growth delay (CGD) were studied and compared with results obtained by stimulation with insulin-induced hypoglycemia (IH) and GHRH alone. The mean peak plasma GH levels were variable, but individual values were frequently low in all groups after both IH [FSS, 9.7 +/- 1.3 (+/- SEM) ng/mL; GHD, 1.6 +/- 0.4 ng/mL; CGD, 7.0 +/- 0.8 ng/mL] and GHRH (FSS, 23.8 +/- 6.6 ng/mL; GHD, 11.1 +/- 5.8 ng/mL; CGD, 15.1 +/- 4.5 ng/mL) administration. PD induced GH responses (FSS, 14.5 +/- 1.6 ng/mL; GHD, 3.8 +/- 0.8 ng/mL; CGD, 18.3 +/- 3.2 ng/mL) that in many children in the FSS and CGD groups were higher than those after IH and GHRH treatment. PD clearly increased the GH response to GHRH in all children [FSS, 69.5 +/- 9.4 ng/mL (P less than 0.01 vs. other stimuli); GHD, 18.0 +/- 7.5 ng/mL; CGD, 50.0 +/- 8.5 ng/mL (P less than 0.01 vs. other stimuli)]. We conclude that in children with short stature, as in adults, enhancement of cholinergic tone increases both basal and GHRH-induced GH secretion, and that PD plus GHRH is the best provocative stimulus for evaluating the somatotroph response.\r"

Luteal phase deficiency has been reported to be associated with increased gonadotropin pulse frequency and inadequate preovulatory follicular development. In this study we induced in normal women a supraphysiological gonadotropin pulse frequency in the follicular phase to determine its effect on follicular development and corpus luteum function. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that a supraphysiological GnRH pulse frequency would result in deficient luteal phase production of progesterone. The subjects were six normal ovulatory women (age range, 23-35 yr). They were initially studied during a control cycle (cycle 1). Then, 25 ng/kg GnRH was administered iv every 30 min from the early follicular phase of the next cycle (cycle 2) until ovulation occurred. GnRH administration resulted in increased follicular phase plasma LH and FSH levels and LH to FSH ratios, multiple preovulatory follicles (mean, 2.8) with increased mean integrated estradiol [1302 (pg/mL)day (cycle 1) vs. 2550 (pg/mL)day (cycle 2); P less than 0.05; 4780 vs. 9360 (pmol/L)day, Systeme International units], spontaneous ovulation, decreased luteal phase plasma immunoreactive and bioactive LH levels, decreased luteal phase length [13.5 days (cycle 1) vs. 8.8 days (cycle 2); P less than 0.05], and decreased mean integrated progesterone secretion [152 (ng/mL)day (cycle 1) vs. 66 (ng/mL)day (cycle 2); P less than 0.01; 482 vs. 209 (nmol/L)day, Systeme International units]. We conclude that high frequency LH and FSH secretion during the follicular phase can induce inadequate progesterone secretion during the subsequent luteal phase, and we infer that the pathophysiological basis for this induced luteal phase deficiency is decreased LH support of corpus luteum function.\r"

Basally, mean plasma LH levels were 46.3 +/- 3.5 (+/- SE) and 53.4 +/- 4.6 mIU/mL in the BCT and placebo groups, respectively. Mean LH pulse frequencies were 4.2 +/- 0.3 and 4.0 +/- 0.4 pulses/4 h, mean pulse amplitudes were 19.2 +/- 1.9 and 20.1 +/- 1.5 mIU/mL, and mean interpulse intervals were 54.3 +/- 3.1 and 54.6 +/- 3.2 min in the two groups, respectively. BCT administration induced no significant changes in mean plasma LH levels, but it significantly (P less than 0.01) decreased LH pulse frequency (1.7 +/- 0.3 pulses/4 h) and amplitude (12.7 +/- 0.8 mIU/mL) and significantly (P less than 0.01) increased mean interpulse interval (126.1 +/- 17.5 min). Placebo administration did not induce any significant changes in pulsatile LH release. These results demonstrate that in postmenopausal women LH secretion is circhoral, and BCT administration can blunt LH pulsatility, suggesting dopaminergic regulation of the GnRH-LH pulse generator.\r"

Plasma 17 beta-estradiol, testosterone, and androstenedione levels were measured in the first sample. Ovarian size was measured by ultrasound. According to their mean plasma LH levels, the adolescents were divided into two groups, those with a high plasma LH level (2 Sd or greater than the mean adult value) and those with a normal plasma LH level. The mean plasma estradiol (P less than 0.001) and testosterone (P less than 0.05) levels were higher in the women with high plasma LH levels compared to those in women with normal plasma LH levels. The LH pulse amplitude was greater (P less than 0.05) and the interpulse interval shorter (P less than 0.025) in the high LH group compared to those in the normal LH group. A 24-h periodicity with the highest plasma LH levels and the greatest pulse amplitude in the afternoon was found in high LH group. In the normal LH group, the highest plasma LH levels and greatest pulse amplitude occurred in the first hours of the morning. An accentuated 24-h LH periodicity is typical of puberty, but disappears in adulthood. We have recorded the persistence of pronounced LH circadian changes in anovulatory adolescent women which might be a marker of a continuing maturational process. Furthermore, LH circadian changes have opposing profiles according to the mean LH values, suggesting the presence of different central nervous system pubertal programs.\r"

The results indicate that the mean fractional catabolic rate (FCR) of apoA-I/HDL was significantly faster [0.63 +/- 0.07 (+/- SEM) vs. 0.39 +/- 0.02 1/day; P less than 0.001] and the apoA-I/HDL synthetic rate greater (29.4 +/- 2.9 vs. 22.9 +/- 1.3 mg/kg X day; P less than 0.02) in patients with NIDDM than in normal subjects. Furthermore, there were statistically significant inverse relationships between apoA-I/HDL FCR and plasma levels of both HDL cholesterol (r = -0.71; P less than 0.001) and apoA-I (r = -0.63; P less than 0.001). In addition, the increase in apoA-I/HDL FCR was directly related to fasting plasma glucose (r = 0.78; P less than 0.001) and insulin (r = 0.76; P less than 0.001) concentrations. These data support the view that the decrease in plasma HDL cholesterol and apoA-I levels commonly found in patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes is due to an increase in the catabolic rate of apoA-I/HDL secondary to the defects in carbohydrate metabolism present in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of age and sex on human GH secretion is controversial. In previous studies, serum GH responses to arginine and insulin-induced hypoglycemia were significantly higher in pre- and postovulatory women than in men. In contrast, recent studies suggest that GH responsiveness to GHRH is higher in normal young men than in age-matched women. To clarify the question of sex and age influence on GHRH-(1-44)-stimulated GH secretion, we studied 116 normal women and men (with body mass indexes of 18-25 and 19-26, respectively) between the ages of 18 and 95 yr. The peak serum GH increments after GHRH administration were significantly higher in premenopausal women than in age-matched men (P less than 0.003 for the age group 18-30 yr and P less than 0.03 for the age group 30-50 yr, as assessed by analysis of variance). The responses were not different in postmenopausal women and age-matched men. Multiple regression analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between GHRH-induced GH responses (integrated area under the curve) and age in both women (P less than 0.002) and men (P less than 0.001). In addition, we determined basal serum testosterone, estradiol, cortisol, and PRL levels in all subjects. Multivariate regression analysis of the GH responses to GHRH administration revealed a significant positive correlation (P less than 0.01) between serum estradiol and both GH increase and the area under the GH response curve. No correlation was found between GHRH-stimulated GH secretion and basal serum cortisol, testosterone, or PRL concentrations. Our data clearly demonstrate a marked influence of both sex and age on GHRH-stimulated GH secretion. We found a higher GH increase in premenopausal women compared with age matched-men and an age-dependent decrease in GHRH-stimulated GH secretion in both sexes. Furthermore, in women a significant influence of estradiol on GH secretion after GHRH administration could be demonstrated.\r"

Low density lipoproteins appear to be the major contributor of cholesterol for steroid synthesis in man. Patients with disorders of low density lipoproteins or the low density lipoprotein receptor have reduced cortisol production in response to ACTH. Therapeutic agents designed to lower plasma cholesterol could, therefore, adversely affect steroid hormone production. Lovastatin (mevinolin) is a new hypolipidemic agent which blocks cholesterol synthesis by competitive inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. In beagle dogs, lovastatin at 40-180 times the clinically effective dose in man, has been associated with an increase in spontaneous testicular atrophy. Accordingly, the effect of lovastatin on testicular function and lipoprotein levels was studied in 16 hyperlipidemic men in a randomized, double blind, cross-over study with another hypolipidemic agent, neomycin. Serum testosterone, PRL, LH, and FSH; LHRH-stimulated LH and FSH concentrations; and testicular size were measured, and semen analyses were made. We found no evidence that lovastatin had adverse effects on testicular function despite significant alterations in plasma lipoprotein concentrations.\r"

  ".W": "Constant infusion of GnRH agonist (GnRH-A) leads to far greater suppression of spermatogenesis and gonadotropins in the monkey than its intermittent administration. We assessed if greater suppression of gonadotropins and spermatogenesis could also be achieved in man by continuous GnRH-A administration. Seven normal men were given 400 micrograms GnRH-A daily by constant sc infusion using a mechanical pump device and bimonthly injections of 200 mg testosterone (T) enanthate for 16 weeks. Basal serum LH, FSH, T, and estradiol concentrations were measured every week during a 5-week control period, daily on treatment days 0, 1-11, 14, 18, 22, 26, 28, and every week thereafter until day 56, and every 2 weeks thereafter during the remainder of the treatment phase and during the 14-week recovery phase. Detailed analysis of LH and FSH secretion during the 24-h period was performed by multiple blood sampling on days 0, 1, 10, 28, 56, 84, and 112. Semen analyses were performed every week during the control phase and every 2 weeks during the treatment and recovery phases. The mean sperm count declined by 93% to a nadir of 6 +/- 3 (+/- SE) million/mL between weeks 14-16. Four men had sperm counts less than 1 million/mL, and three subjects were azoospermic during treatment. Basal serum immunoreactive LH concentrations, after an early increase, declined to near baseline by day 14. The basal and 24-h integrated serum LH concentrations and 24-h urinary LH excretion were not significantly lowered by treatment. Bioassayable serum LH concentrations, however, after an early rise, declined significantly below baseline by day 28 and remained low thereafter. The frequency and amplitude of LH pulses were reduced by GnRH agonist infusion. Basal and 24-h integrated serum FSH concentrations, after a brief initial increase, declined to baseline by day 10, but were not significantly below baseline by day 112. Serum T concentrations did not fall into the hypogonadal range at any time during the treatment period. After discontinuation of treatment, serum LH and FSH and sperm counts returned to normal in all men. Thus, this regimen, employing constant infusion of 400 micrograms GnRH agonist daily plus T led to a greater suppression of spermatogenesis than the previous regimen employing single daily injections of 200 micrograms of the same agonist plus T. Whether the higher dose or the constant infusion was responsible for the greater inhibition of spermatogenesis is not clear. It is conceivable that a still higher dose of the agonist, given by constant infusion, might induce azoospermia in all men.\r"

Glucose disposal, oxidative and nonoxidative glucose metabolism were determined. GS, PFK, and PDH were assayed in skeletal muscle under each condition. Glucose disposal rates were 2.37 +/- 0.11, 3.15 +/- 0.19, 6.71 +/- 0.44, and 11.7 +/- 1.73 mg/kg X min; glucose oxidation rates were 1.96 +/- 0.18, 2.81 +/- 0.28, 4.43 +/- 0.32, and 5.22 +/- 0.52. Nonoxidative glucose metabolism was 0.39 +/- 0.13, 0.34 +/- 0.26, 2.28 +/- 0.40, and 6.52 +/- 1.21 mg/kg X min. Both the proportion of active GS and the proportion of active PDH were increased by hyperinsulinemia. PFK activity was unaffected. Activation of GS was correlated with nonoxidative glucose metabolism, while activation of PDH was correlated with glucose oxidation. Sensitivity to insulin of GS was similar to that of nonoxidative glucose metabolism, while the sensitivity to insulin of PDH was similar to that of glucose oxidation. Therefore, the activation of these enzymes in muscle may regulate nonoxidative and oxidative glucose metabolism.\r"

Since diabetes mellitus is associated with glomerular hyperfiltration and volume expansion, we investigated the relationship between ANP and GFR in diabetic rats given insulin to achieve stable moderate hyperglycemia or normoglycemia. At 2 wk after induction of diabetes, moderately hyperglycemic diabetic rats exhibited elevations of plasma ANP levels averaging 281 +/- 28 pg/ml vs. 158 +/- 15 pg/ml in normoglycemic diabetic rats. In hyperglycemic rats, the GFR was also elevated on average to 2.24 +/- 0.28 ml/min as compared with 1.71 +/- 0.13 ml/min in normoglycemic diabetic rats. To test further the relationship between ANP and GFR in diabetes, moderately hyperglycemic diabetic rats were infused either with a specific ANP antiserum or with nonimmune serum. The infusion of specific ANP antiserum uniformly reduced the GFR on average from 2.38 +/- 0.1 ml/min to 1.60 +/- 0.1 ml/min, whereas the infusion of nonimmune serum was without effect. It is concluded that elevated endogenous ANP levels contribute to the hyperfiltration observed in early diabetes in the rat.\r"

Preincubation of blLPM vesicles with UDCA (0-500 microM) resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in initial rates of amiloride-sensitive pH-driven Na+ uptake, with a maximal effect at 200 microM. UDCA (200 microM) increased Vmax from 23 +/- 2 (control) to 37 +/- 7 nmol/min per mg protein; apparent Km for Na+ was unchanged. Preincubation with tauroursodeoxycholate (200 microM), taurocholate (10-200 microM) or cholate, chenodeoxycholate, or deoxycholate (200 microM) had no effect on pH-driven Na+ uptake. UDCA (200 microM) had no effect on either membrane lipid fluidity, assessed by steady-state fluorescence polarization using the probes 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene, 12-(9-anthroyloxy) stearic acid, and 2-(9-anthroyloxy) stearic acid (2-AS), or Na+,K+-ATPase activity in blLPM vesicles. In cLPM vesicles, UDCA (0-500 microM) had no stimulatory effect on initial rates of HCO3(-)-driven Cl- uptake. Enhanced basolateral Na+:H+ exchange activity, leading to intracellular HCO3- concentrations above equilibrium, may account for the bicarbonate-rich choleresis after UDCA infusion.\r"

Isolated rat kidneys were clamped for 1 h and reperfused for 30 min without therapy and then perfused with either 0 (control) or 100 micrograms/dl AP-III. In this system AP-III significantly improved renal plasma flow (39.6 +/- 2.4 vs. 32.2 +/- 2.1 ml/min per g; P less than 0.05) inulin clearance (182.6 +/- 49.2 vs. 24.6 +/- 6.2 microliters/min per g; P less than 0.05), urine flow (52.9 +/- 12.1 vs. 7.1 +/- 0.8 microliters/min per g, P less than 0.01), and net tubular sodium reabsorption (21.2 +/- 6.6 vs. 2.9 +/- 0.9 mumol/min per g, P less than 0.05) as compared with control. A second series of in vivo studies experiments were performed using 1 h of bilateral renal artery clamping followed by an intravenous infusion of either saline alone (control) or AP-III (0.20 microgram/kg per min) for 60 min. The results demonstrated that inulin clearance (244.4 +/- 25.1 vs. 15.8 +/- 8.2 microliters/min per 100 g; P less than 0.01), urine flow (23.1 +/- 5.9 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.5 microliters/min per 100 g; P less than 0.01), and net tubular sodium reabsorption (38.9 +/- 4.7 vs. 4.3 +/- 1.6 mumol/min per 100 g; P less than 0.01) were significantly higher in AP-III-treated rats than controls during the hour of AP-III infusion. In 1 h posttreatment study this significant protective effect of AP-III was documented to persist. In more chronic studies animals treated acutely with AP-III had lower serum creatinine concentration at 24 h (1.8 +/- 0.3 vs. 3.3 +/- 0.4 mg/dl; P less than 0.01) and 48 (1.0 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.4 +/- 4.0 mg/dl; P less than 0.01) after the 60 min of ischemia than controls. Renal adenosine triphosphate regeneration as assessed by P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance during reflow was also significantly improved in AP-III-treated animals at 1 h (3.03 +/- 0.30 vs. 1.45 +/- 0.40 mumol/g dry wt; P less than 0.05) and 2 h (3.98 +/- 0.46 vs. 1.80 +/- 0.05 mumol/g dry wt; P less than 0.01) or reflow as compared with control rats. Thus, AP-III significantly ameliorates ischemic acute renal failure both in vitro and in vivo in the rat.\r"

  ".W": "The regulation of renin secretion was studied in continuous culture of human juxtaglomerular cells (JGC), which provided a permanent source of human renin production (Pinet, F., M. T. Corvol, F. Dench, J. Bourguignon, J. Feunteun, J. Menard, and P. Corvol, 1985, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 82:8503-8507). 95% of the renin species secreted was prorenin, and therefore this study concerned primarily prorenin secretion. Renin production was stable, since the cells had been maintained in culture for more than two years. In culture, these human cells formed colonies of smooth musclelike cells, and electron microscopy showed the presence of cytoskeleton structures including myofibrils and attachment bodies. This human model was used to investigate the control of prorenin secretion in vitro at cellular level. Various pharmacological agents known to stimulate or inhibit renin secretion were tested in the cell cultures. The variations in prorenin secretion were measured in the supernatant. Forskolin, an independent receptor activator of adenylate cyclase, stimulated prorenin secretion in a dose-dependent manner and this stimulation was mediated by 3',5' cyclic-AMP (cAMP). Angiotensin II (AII) was found to inhibit prorenin secretion directly in a dose-dependent manner and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), whose effects on human JGC were characterized for the first time, was also shown to exert such inhibition. When the effects of this inhibition by AII and ANF were tested on forskolin-mediated stimulation of prorenin secretion, the latter was inhibited and no change occurred in cAMP release. When JGC were treated with histamine, bradykinin, or one or two bradykinin analogues, the responses suggested that in these cells, H2-histamine receptors and kinin receptors are dependent on adenylate cyclase. One peptide, substance P, had an inhibitory effect on prorenin secretion but it was less important than AII and ANF. The present results demonstrate that the adenylate cyclase system of human JGC remains intact during culture and supports the hypothesis that cAMP is the second messenger and Cai2+, the final messenger involved in renin secretion. The cell system used here permits the evaluation of cellular responses and intracellular events in granulated cells in a human model.\r"

  ".W": "Mounting evidence suggests that opiate addiction and stress are associated with impaired cell-mediated immunity. We tested the hypothesis that morphine and the endogenous opioid beta-endorphin (beta-END), a pituitary peptide released in increased concentrations during stress, can suppress the production of the key macrophage-activating lymphokine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) by cultured human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC). Using a radioimmunoassay to measure IFN-gamma, we found that exposure of PBMNC to biologically relevant concentrations of both opioids significantly inhibited IFN-gamma generation by cells stimulated with concanavalin A and varicella zoster virus. Studies of the mechanism of suppression revealed (a) a classical opioid receptor is involved (suppression was antagonized by naloxone and was specific for the NH2 terminus of beta-END), (b) monocytes are the primary target cell for opioids (monocyte-depleted lymphocyte preparations showed little suppression), and (c) reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) and prostaglandin E2 are important mediators (scavengers of ROI and indomethacin eliminated the suppression). Based on these findings we suggest that opioid-triggered release of inhibitory monocyte metabolites may play a role in the immunodeficiency associated with narcotic addiction and stress.\r"

  ".U": "87308823\r", 
  ".W": "To study vascular actions of synthetic alpha-human atrial natriuretic polypeptide (alpha hANP) in man, forearm blood flow (FBF) was measured by strain-gauge plethysmograph during the continuous infusion of 100 ng/min alpha hANP dissolved in 5% dextrose into the brachial artery in healthy subjects. alpha hANP increased FBF, with the concomitant increase in ipsilateral limb venous plasma concentrations of alpha hANP. Overall, there was a significant linear correlation between the decrements of ipsilateral forearm vascular resistance (FVR) during infusions of alpha hANP and initial FVR levels (r = -0.883, P less than 0.01). Moreover, alpha hANP, at the stepwise increasing doses of 20, 100, and 500 ng/min, increased FBF in a dose-related fashion: alpha hANP elicits a concentration-dependent vasodilation of forearm vascular beds. Concomitantly, infusions of alpha hANP caused a dose-dependent increase in ipsilateral limb venous plasma cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cyclic GMP). Overall, there were direct correlations of FBF either to ipsilateral venous plasma alpha hANP (r = 0.724, P less than 0.01) or to cyclic GMP concentrations (r = 0.637, P less than 0.01). Subsequently, isoosmolar CaCl2 solution was infused into the same brachial artery at a rate of 0.09 meq/min, and then, with a 2.5 +/- 0.2-mg/dl increase in ipsilateral venous serum calcium concentrations the incremental responses of both FBF and plasma cyclic GMP to alpha hANP were severely blunted. There was also a significant positive linear correlation between FBF and venous plasma cyclic GMP during infusions of alpha hANP with the simultaneous administration of CaCl2 (r = 0.807, P less than 0.01). Finally, the addition of CaCl2 infusion did not change the slope of the regression line of the FBF-plasma cyclic GMP relationship during infusions of alpha hANP. Evidence presented suggests that alpha hANP acts directly on the forearm vascular beds in man, eliciting its vascular relaxant effect, possibly by increasing cellular levels of cyclic GMP. Moreover, modest elevations of serum calcium inhibit the alpha hANP-dependent vasodilation, possibly through the suppression of cyclic GMP activation.\r"

  ".W": "The chromatin-bound enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (ADPRP) is strongly stimulated by DNA with single- or double-stranded breaks, and transfers the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD to nuclear proteins. The activation of ADPRP is important for DNA repair and replication, and also has been postulated to play a role in the pathogenesis of lymphocyte dysfunction associated with chronic inflammatory diseases, and inborn errors of nucleoside metabolism. We have detected high titers of IgG autoantibodies to the ADPRP protein in six patients with rheumatic complaints. No other autoantibodies were detected in any of the six sera. The specificity of the anti-enzyme antibodies was established by (a) immunoprecipitation of ADPRP activity, (b) immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting of both the native 116-kD enzyme and its proteolytic digestion products. ADPRP was purified from human thymus and calf thymus. The autoantibodies reacted equivalently with both enzymes. The anti-ADPRP antibodies had a distinctive immunofluorescent pattern with HEp-2 cells, reacting intensely with nucleoli and metaphase chromosomes, and diffusely with the nucleus. Autoantibodies to ADPRP have not been described previously. The presence of a specific immune response against an enzyme that has been associated with various immunodeficiency syndromes raises intriguing possibilities concerning the relationship between DNA damage, immunodeficiency, and autoimmunity.\r"

Changes in the cellobiose:mannitol ratio often occur in coeliac disease, but some patients with abnormal permeability have normal jejunums by routine microscopy. Using computed morphometry the perimeter:lamina propria area index of jejunal biopsy samples was measured and compared with the cellobiose:mannitol ratio in three groups of patients: (i) those with coeliac disease with villous atrophy; (ii) those with normal jejunums and sugar test results: and (iii) those with normal jejunums but abnormal sugar test results. In addition to the expected difference in perimeter:lamina propria area index between patients with coeliac disease and those with normal findings (p less than 0.001), the index was also abnormal in patients with normal jejunums but abnormal sugar test results: (p less than 0.001 compared with group 1) and (0.01 greater than p greater than 0.001 compared with group 2). There was a significant overall correlation between the perimeter:lamina propria area index and cellobiose:mannitol ratio (p = 0.001). This study shows that computed jejunal morphometry can identify patients with subtle morphological changes that are related to abnormal intestinal permeability.\r"

After inoculation deep into the agar medium, the gonococci themselves create the required microaerophilic environment. Inoculated smear material can therefore be transported without loss. Our experience, which has lasted for more than 3 years and which has included more than 4000 patients, showed that in 98% to 99% of cases of suspected gonorrhea, gonococci can be detected with a contamination rate of less than 3%.\r"

The dose dependency of coronary recanalization and of effects on plasma proteins was evaluated for the new rt-PA. Four groups of patients were studied: Study 1, 80 mg old rt-PA infused intravenously over 3 hours (n = 113); Study A, 80 mg new rt-PA over 3 hours (n = 47); Study B, 100 mg new rt-PA over 3 hours (n = 83); and Study C, 150 mg new rt-PA over 6 hours (n = 62). With equal doses of 80 mg, coronary recanalization rates at 90 minutes of infusion, determined angiographically, averaged 62% (Study 1) and 45% (Study A) with no overlap of 95% confidence limits. Increasing the dose of the new rt-PA to 100 mg, recanalization rates at 90 minutes averaged 71% (Study B), similar to those observed in Study 1. An increase to 150 mg resulted in higher recanalization rates at 30 minutes of infusion, 42% compared with 24% in Study 1 with no overlap of 95% confidence limits, and comparable rates at 90 minutes, 76 versus 62%. A linear trend test indicated a significant relation (p less than 0.01) between the dose of the new rt-PA and the rate of coronary recanalization at 30, 60 and 90 minutes of infusion. The new rt-PA affected plasma proteins of the fibrinolytic system less than the old form. There was a dose-dependent relation (p less than 0.001) in the effect of the new rt-PA on the plasma proteins. The frequency of bleeding complications was similar in the four study groups. These results indicate that the new rt-PA is less potent than the old rt-PA, in relation to both coronary reperfusion and systemic fibrinogenolysis. A higher and longer dosage regimen caused more rapid recanalization with similar effects on fibrinogenolysis.\r"

Because rt-PA converts plasminogen to plasmin, which is known to activate complement in vitro, we tested the hypothesis that rt-PA can induce in vivo activation of complement. Studies were performed in 12 patients with acute myocardial infarction. Six control patients had patent coronary arteries and did not receive rt-PA; these patients had normal values of the components of the complement system C4a (409 +/- 111 ng/ml) and C5a (8.8 +/- 1.8 ng/ml) with a slight elevation of C3a (204 +/- 6.6 ng/ml) in samples collected before coronary arteriography (253 +/- 25 minutes after onset of pain). After coronary arteriography, there was a slight decrease in the values of C4a (224 +/- 37 ng/ml), C5a (7.3 +/- 1.3 ng/ml) and C3a (164 +/- 35 ng/ml). The remaining six patients had complete coronary occlusion and received rt-PA (80 to 150 mg intravenously). In this treated group, before coronary arteriography the values of C4a (406 +/- 51.6 ng/ml) and C5a (8.1 +/- 1.9 ng/ml) were normal, and those of C3a were slightly elevated (250 +/- 76 ng/ml). All complement values obtained before rt-PA were similar to those in the untreated group. However, after administration of rt-PA (but before any angiographically detectable reperfusion), there was a striking increase in C4a (2,265 +/- 480 ng/ml; p less than 0.01), C3a (600 +/- 89 ng/ml; p less than 0.05) and C5a (30.0 +/- 4.5 ng/ml; p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Exercise performance was assessed 2 to 4 hours after initial application and after 1 week of each treatment given in random order with a 3 day interval between treatments. Exercise time to onset of angina, total exercise duration and time to 1 mm ST segment depression were all significantly increased after initial application during the continuous and intermittent treatment periods. These increases were maintained after 1 week of intermittent but not continuous treatment. Thus the benefit of initial application of transdermal nitroglycerin is maintained with intermittent treatment and a daily nitrate-free interval, whereas tolerance to antianginal effect occurs with continuous treatment.\r"

Patients were classified into two groups on the basis of their ability to meet established criteria for malnutrition and the use of preoperative or postoperative TPN. The control group consisted of 44 patients who received TPN only after surgery or for less than 5 days preoperatively. The experimental group consisted of 26 patients who received treatment for at least 5 days before surgery and/or after surgery. Nutrition parameters measured included serum albumin, total lymphocyte count, hemoglobin, weight, and percent weight loss. Major septic complications (MSC) considered were intra-abdominal sepsis, wound dehiscence, septicemia, and pneumonia. Other complications included respiratory failure, congestive heart failure, fistulas, urinary tract infection, shock, and death. The experimental group showed improvements after surgery in the nutritional parameters listed and had a lower incidence of morbidity and mortality. Deficits in serum albumin, total lymphocyte count, and weight losses greater than or equal to 10% have been significantly (p less than .01) linked to the incidence of MSC. MSC also has been more frequently noted among patients who did not have TPN prior to surgery and who died following surgery. Therefore, preoperative TPN does appear to make a difference in the outcome of surgery.\r"

This article describes the development, implementation, and evaluation of a procedure used to nutritionally screen and assess geriatric patients in extended care at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Houston. As we developed the system, we considered the special needs and characteristics of geriatric individuals and incorporated them into two forms. Designs were selected to make our method comprehensive, concise, and, ideally, time-efficient. The evaluation of the system included a time utilization study. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficiency of the new system compared with the efficiency of methods used hospital-wide in the past. Results suggest that the new system for reassessing the patient's nutritional status and reevaluating the nutrition care was three times more efficient.\r"

Here we report basal and LHRH-stimulated serum concentrations of the common alpha-subunit of the glycoprotein hormones in 53 of these same men, divided into groups: A, 25 to 49 years, (n = 22); B, 50 to 69 years, (n = 18); and C, 70 to 89 years, (n = 13). There were no significant (p greater than .2) age-related alterations in basal serum concentrations of the alpha-subunit. Using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), we found a significant difference between basal levels and peak responses to LHRH for alpha-subunit in each group (p less than .001); however, age per se did not influence the magnitude of this response (p greater than .1). Frequency distribution analysis of the time of the peak alpha-subunit response across age groups demonstrated a significant age-related delay in the timing of the peak alpha response (p less than .03). These data, in conjunction with our prior observations, suggest that in healthy men there may be age-related alterations in the secretion and/or metabolic clearance of pituitary gonadotropins and their component subunits.\r"

  ".W": "Several studies have documented an increase in sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity, as reflected by either plasma norepinephrine (NE) concentration or NE appearance rate, with aging. Because similar increases have been noted in young obese persons, and because adiposity increases with age, we hypothesized that body composition might be an important determinant of heightened SNS activity. Baseline SNS activity, energy expenditure, and responses to a standard formula \"meal\" were compared in 11 young (31.1 +/- 5 years) (m +/- SD) and 9 old (64.9 +/- 6.3 years) persons. Both baseline NE concentration, p less than .05, and the NE appearance rate, p less than .05, were increased in the elderly group. The percentage of body fat, p = .004, and age, p less than .02, were correlated independently with NE appearance rate but not with NE concentration. Although plasma NE increased after the meal in both groups, NE appearance increased in the young group only. We conclude that NE appearance rate is a better reflection of SNS activity than NE concentration. We also found that the percentage of body fat and age are independent determinants of baseline SNS activity, which together account for 52% of the variability in SNS activity, as reflected by NE appearance rate.\r"

  ".W": "A population of immature mouse thymocytes bears low levels of surface sialic acid and can be separated from the more mature high sialic acid-bearing thymocytes by selective agglutination with the sialic acid-specific lectin, lobster agglutinin 1. These immature thymocytes do not proliferate in response to concanavalin A (Con A). They do not produce interleukin 2 (IL-2), do not provide T cell help to B cells for an in vitro antibody response, and as shown here, do not become cytotoxic T lymphocytes when polyclonally stimulated with Con A + IL-2. We describe here a spleen-derived maturational factor which stimulates these immature thymocytes, in the presence of Con A and IL-2, to become cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The maturational factor is a protein secreted by Con A-stimulated mouse or rat spleen cells; it is apparently neither interleukin 1, IL-2, interleukin 3, gamma-interferon, nor combinations of these cytokines, because these materials do not replace the maturational factor. The active material in Con A-stimulated mouse spleen cell supernatant was recovered from a G-75 column in the 33,000-48,000 m.w. range. These experiments suggest that within the lobster agglutinin 1-negative thymocyte population there are cells which can mature under the influence of a spleen-derived factor. It is possible that these cells represent the small subpopulation of immature cells destined to become immunocompetent peripheral T cells. On the other hand, the factor may be rescuing cells destined to die in the thymus.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated the synergistic effects of phorbol ester and calcium ionophore on human T lymphocyte proliferation and the expression of the proliferation-related genes, c-myc, c-fos, interleukin 2 receptors (IL-2R) and interleukin 2 (IL-2). Incubation of T lymphocytes with both the phorbol ester, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDB), and the calcium ionophore, ionomycin, leads to the expression of a series of proliferation-related genes, followed by T cell proliferation. In contrast, stimulation of T cells sequentially with PDB and then ionomycin did not induce mitogenesis, demonstrating that simultaneous exposure to both agents is necessary for proliferation. Exposure of T cells to both agents together for different time periods resulted in a proliferative response in proportion to the duration of the exposure, with more than 6 hr required for maximum proliferation. In contrast, a 1-hr exposure to both drugs was sufficient for maximum expression of c-fos or c-myc proto-oncogene mRNA. The expression of IL-2R and the production of IL-2 were also dependent on the duration of simultaneous exposure to both phorbol ester and calcium ionophore. Levels of IL-2 mRNA became detectable at 1 hr and peaked at 3 hr after stimulation. The induction of IL-2 mRNA occurred only in the presence of both agents and became undetectable within 2 hr after the drugs were removed. In contrast, the expression of IL-2R mRNA became detectable at 1 hr, but was maintained even after the drugs were removed and reached a peak at 24 hr. Both IL-2 and IL-2R mRNA accumulated in proportion to the duration of the exposure. Augmentation of cell proliferation by exogenous IL-2 was observed in T cells exposed to the drugs for less than 3 hr. These data demonstrated that the induction of maximum expression of the nuclear proto-oncogenes c-myc and c-fos was not sufficient for PDB-ionomycin-induced T cell proliferation. The level of IL-2 mRNA accumulation and resultant IL-2 secretion is one of the limiting factors for proliferation of T cells exposed to the drugs for less than 3 hr, but not for longer exposures. Additional events such as accumulation of IL-2R mRNA and protein triggered by a long exposure to the drugs were obligatory for obtaining maximum proliferation.\r"

The role of T cells in this autoimmune syndrome was studied by in vivo treatment of tolerant mice with anti-L3T4(GK-1.5) or anti-Ly-2 (H-35-17.2) monoclonal antibodies. The treatment of tolerant mice from day 2 to day 21 of life with anti-L3T4 MAb completely prevented the occurrence of circulating immune complexes of anti-ssDNA anti-Sm and anti-hapten (FITC) IgG antibodies as well as the glomerular deposition of Ig that were usually seen in untreated tolerant mice. This effect persisted for at least 6 wk after stopping this treatment. When the injections of anti-L3T4 MAb were delayed until day 15 of life, a very significant decrease of the autoimmune manifestations was still observed. Treatment of tolerant mice with anti-Ly-2 MAb during the same period had no effects on the autoimmune disease as compared with untreated tolerant mice. No effects on the maintenance of tolerance vs H-2b alloantigens were observed after treatment with anti-L3T4 MAb, as followed by the decrease of CTL and CTL-p alloreactivity and by the persistence of F1 donor B cells, indicated by the presence of Ig bearing the Ighb donor allotype. These results suggest the existence of interactions between L3T4+ T cells and persisting autoreactive B cells from F1 donor origin in the development of the autoimmune syndrome after neonatal induction of transplantation tolerance.\r"

  ".W": "The expression of the T cell receptor (Ti)-alpha and -beta subunits in human thymocytes was studied with the use of two rabbit antisera directed at constant regions of human Ti-alpha- and Ti-beta-chains (H36 and H38, respectively). Immunoperoxidase techniques were employed to count by light and electron microscopy the cells, in the various thymocyte subsets, bearing Ti-alpha and Ti-beta subunits. Of the unfractionated thymocytes, 88% +/- 5 SD and 56% +/- 8 SD were labeled by H38 and H36, respectively. More than 90% of cells in cluster of differentiation (CD)-1+ (mainly cortical) and CD1-CD3+ (mainly medullary) subsets were stained with H38. When tested by H36, 51% +/- 6 SD of CD1+ and 81% +/- 8 SD of CD1-CD3+ thymocytes were positive. In the immature CD3-CD1- subpopulation, less than 3% of cells reacted with H36, whereas 15% +/- 3 SD were stained by H38. Flow cytometry revealed that CD1+ (mainly cortical) thymocytes expressed CD3 surface antigen in a percentage similar to that of CD1+ cells positive for Ti-alpha subunits. Indirect double labeling procedures with immunogold- and peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies demonstrated that almost all CD1+/Ti-alpha + cells expressed the surface CD3 antigen, whereas a large proportion of CD1+/Ti-beta + cells did not. These results indicate a sequential expression of Ti-beta and Ti-alpha subunits during intrathymic T cell differentiation. They also suggest that assembly and surface expression of the CD3-Ti complex are linked to the production of Ti-alpha-chains in addition to Ti-beta subunits. Last, the expression of Ti-alpha and Ti-beta subunits was studied in peanut agglutinin (PNA)+, CD1+ blasts representing the main, spontaneously proliferating intrathymic pool. The lack of Ti-alpha and Ti-beta subunits and the absence of surface CD3 antigen on most of these blasts suggest that immature T cells are compelled to proliferate in the thymus in a CD3-Ti complex independent manner.\r"

Fresh thymocytes lack natural cytotoxic activity, and cytotoxicity cannot be stimulated by short term (1 hr) incubation with interferon or recombinant interleukin 2 (rIL-2). In addition, thymocytes are phenotypically devoid of cells bearing the natural killer (NK)-associated markers cluster designation (CD) 16 and NKH-1. After culture for 5 to 8 days with rIL-2, thymocytes display high levels of cytotoxic activity against both NK-sensitive and NK-resistant targets. Thymocytes require slightly more IL-2 than do peripheral blood lymphocytes to generate LAK activity. We have examined the phenotype of the thymocyte LAK precursor and effector cells. Thymocyte LAK precursors are of low to medium density, CD1-negative, and predominantly CD3-negative. Although CD3-positive cells proliferate in response to rIL-2, they are low in cytolytic capabilities. The effector cells, like the LAK precursors, are low to medium density lymphocytes. The cytotoxic cells are predominantly CD3-negative, and cytotoxic activity cannot be blocked with the use of anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies. The effector cells also lack most NK-associated markers (HNK-1, and the CD16 markers Leu-11b and B73.1) but possess the NK-associated marker NKH-1 (N901). The responsive cell appears to be at a very early stage of thymic development, and it does not appear to either require or express the CD3-T cell receptor complex.\r"

  ".U": "87309744\r", 
  ".W": "Interleukin 2 (IL-2) production and recognition are clearly involved in the age-associated proliferative defect of mitogen-stimulated T lymphocytes. The external signal delivered by mitogens is transmitted across the membrane via the release of two messenger molecules, diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), involved in the activation of protein kinase C (PK-C) and the elevation of cytosolic free Ca2+. In that Ca2+ mobilization and PK-C activation appear to be crucial events in the production of IL-2 and the expression of IL-2 receptors, a defect in transmembrane signaling would result in decreased synthesis and response to IL-2. We therefore examined PK-C activity and translocation, generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, and cytosolic Ca2+ levels as a function of age in murine G0 T lymphocytes before and after exposure to mitogenic doses of concanavalin A (Con A). The basal levels and distribution of PK-C before and after direct activation of the enzyme by 2 or 20 nM phorbol myristate acetate were comparable in both age groups indicating no inherent age-associated functional defect in the enzyme. However, the Con A-induced PK-C translocation was reduced by 50% in cells from 24-mo-old animals. The Con A stimulation of G0 T lymphocytes increased free cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and the production of inositol phosphates to the same level, irrespective of the age of the donor. However, basal levels of both of these second messengers were consistently higher in lymphocytes derived from old mice. As a result, the net increase in inositol phosphates and [Ca2+]i was reduced by approximately the same extent as that observed for the translocation of PK-C. These results clearly point to an age-associated defect in the generation of phosphoinositide-derived second messengers and indicate that an alteration in signal transduction plays a primary role in the age-related impairment of the mitogen-induced, IL-2-mediated proliferative response of T lymphocytes.\r"

The soluble form of IL 2R, at least in part, retains its ability to bind to IL 2 and to anti-receptor antibodies, but its exact structure remains unknown. Because systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is associated with T and B cell activation, we have used monoclonal anti-IL 2R antibodies in an ELISA to measure levels of IL 2R in sera of various lupus strains. High levels of the released receptor were found at an active clinical stage in sera of four autoimmune strains of mice homozygous for the lpr (lymphoproliferation) gene that causes T cell expansion, massive lymphoid organ enlargement, and promotes the autoimmune process. High levels were also found in lupus mice characterized primarily by B cell proliferation (BXSB males) and in (NZB X W)F1 mice characterized by T and B cell activation. Similarly high IL 2R serum levels could be induced experimentally in normal mice injected with immunostimulants such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide or Freund's complete adjuvant. The results indicate that IL 2R serum levels may provide a good marker of ongoing lymphoid cell activation/proliferation, and thus might be useful in the follow-up of patients with systemic autoimmune or other lymphoproliferative disorders. The biologic roles, if any, of the soluble form of IL 2R and its effects in normal and abnormal conditions remain to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "Regulation of the immune response in man is largely dependent on interactions between cells of the cluster designation 4+ (CD4+) helper/inducer sublineage and the CD8+ suppressor/cytotoxic sublineage. When cultured with autologous antigen-primed CD4+ lymphocytes, CD8+ cells differentiate into suppressor T cells (Ts) that specifically inhibit the response of fresh autologous CD4+ cells to the priming antigen only. The current study was undertaken to analyze the roles in this suppressor circuit of subpopulations of the CD4+ sublineage distinguished from one another on the basis of their binding (or lack of binding) to monoclonal antibodies against molecules p80 (Leu8) and CD45R (p220/Leu18/2H4). When examined for the proliferative responses to alloantigenic stimuli, each of the four: CD4+p80+, CD4+p80-, CD4+CD45R+, and CD4+CD45R- populations proliferated vigorously, synthesized interleukin 2 (IL-2) and interferon and released soluble IL-2 receptors. However, the responses to soluble antigens such as Candida and diphtheria toxoid were exhibited by CD4+CD45R-, CD4+p80+, and CD4+p80- cells, but not by CD4+CD45R+ cells. When examined for their ability to induced CD8+ Ts in the Candida-driven suppressor-induction culture system, only CD4+p80+ and CD4+CD45R- cells induced strong suppression. Further, when CD4+CD45R- cells were separated into CD4+CD45R-p80+ and CD4+CD45R-p80- subpopulations, despite the ability of both subpopulations to respond to Candida, only CD4+CD45R-p80+ cells induced autologous CD8+ Ts. Activated CD8+ Ts suppressed not only proliferation but also the release of soluble IL-2 receptors by autologous antigen-activated CD4+ cells. Thus, the antigen-specific suppressor-inducer T cells appear to be derived from the CD4+CD45R-p80+ (Leu3+, Leu8+, 2H4-) subpopulation of the CD4+ sublineage.\r"

Our findings indicate that TsF1 is antigen-specific, genetically restricted by I-J in its direct mediation of suppression, and capable of inhibiting the development of interstitial lesions. TsF1 also provides an inducing signal for the activation of effector Ts-2 suppressors following presentation by accessory cells. The induction of a Ts-2 effect, however, requires that the factor-presenting cell and the recipient of such cells share homology at I-J, and that the TsF1, the precursor Ts-2 cells, and the recipient of the Ts-2 effect share the same Igh-V allotype. Finally, the results of this current report clearly demonstrate a possible therapeutic role for soluble suppressor factors in the management of interstitial renal disease.\r"

IL 1 in combination with ionomycin (iono/rIL 1) stimulated a proliferative response that was associated with the production of IL 4 as measured by lymphokine bioassay and mRNA studies. Furthermore, inhibition of this proliferative response with an anti-IL 4 monoclonal antibody or cyclosporine indicated that IL 4 functions as an autocrine growth factor. In contrast, IL 1 synergized with TPA (TPA/rIL 1) to induce proliferation in the absence of either IL 4 or IL 2 gene transcription or lymphokine secretion. The IL 4-independence of this activation mechanism was further supported by the failure of both anti-IL 4 antibodies and cyclosporine to inhibit the response. In addition, activation by TPA/rIL 1 caused no detectable alteration in cytoplasmic calcium levels. Both IL 4-dependent and IL 4-independent activation responses were associated with the expression of functional receptors for IL 2 as well as IL 4. Characterization of these activation responses suggests that the synergistic activity of IL 1 during T cell activation is multipotential. The nature of an IL 1-dependent T cell growth response, therefore, may vary depending on the balance of intracellular signals generated concurrently through the T cell receptor complex and other regulatory surface molecules.\r"

With the use of recombinant IL-1, the IL-1 inhibitor was partially purified by using ammonium sulfate precipitation, anion-exchange, and gel filtration chromatographies. IL-1 inhibitory activity elutes with an 18,000 to 25,000 apparent molecular size. The same fractions also inhibit IL-1 assayed by the proliferation of murine thymocytes and human fibroblasts. Both forms of human recombinant IL-1, IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta, which show only 26% homology, but nevertheless bind to the same receptor, are affected by this natural inhibitor to the same extent. In contrast, human recombinant tumor necrosis factor, which shares some of the biologic activities of IL-1, is not inhibited by the urinary IL-1 inhibitor. This study shows that the various biologic activities of both forms of human recombinant IL-1 are inhibited by a partially purified natural urine-derived factor.\r"

The inhibitor was distinct from IL-1 as determined by both physical parameters (size and antigenicity) and receptor-binding characteristics (apparent affinity and dissociation rate).

  ".U": "87309757\r", 
  ".W": "High concentrations of interleukin 2 (IL 2) were shown to produce a delayed but pronounced proliferation of purified resting T cells in the apparent absence of other activation signals. Because these stimulatory effects of IL 2 occurred in the absence of detectable Tac+ cells, the possibility that IL 2 might be initially interacting with an IL 2 binding protein distinct from the Tac protein was studied. Chemical cross-linking studies with 125I-IL 2 revealed the presence of an IL 2 binding protein distinct from the Tac protein on the surface of these unstimulated T cells. This second IL 2 receptor has an estimated molecular size of 70,000 daltons, lacks reactivity with the anti-Tac antibody, and appears to be identical to the p70 protein recently proposed as a component of the high affinity IL 2 receptor. Scatchard analysis of IL 2 binding assays performed with the unactivated T cells revealed approximately 600 to 700 p70 sites per cell and an apparent Kd of 340 pM. These data indicate that the p70 protein present on resting T cells binds IL 2 with an intermediate affinity compared with the previously recognized high and low affinity forms of the receptor and may account for the high concentration of IL 2 needed to induce resting T cell proliferation. To investigate the early biologic consequences of IL 2 binding to the p70 protein, potential changes in the expression of genes involved in T cell activation were examined. Northern blotting revealed the rapid induction of c-myc, c-myb, and Tac mRNA after stimulation of resting T cells with a high concentration of IL 2. The anti-Tac antibody did not inhibit IL 2 induced expression of these genes, suggesting that the p70 protein rather than the Tac antigen or the high affinity IL 2 receptor complex mediated this signal. However, in contrast to these early activation events, the anti-Tac antibody significantly inhibited IL 2 induced T cell proliferation. This finding implicates the high affinity form of the IL 2 receptor in the proliferative response of the IL 2 activated T cells. Thus these data support a two step model for the induction of resting T cell proliferation by high doses of IL 2 involving the initial generation of an activation or \"competence\" signal through the p70 protein and a subsequent proliferation or \"progression\" signal through the high affinity form of the receptor.\r"

BCGF (m.w. 50,000 BCGF), whereas large B cells from both organs responded directly to the low m.w. BCGF (m.w. 20,000 BCGF). The tonsillar B cells directly responsive to the m.w. 50,000 BCGF express the 4F2 marker and thus belong to a population of in vivo-preactivated B cells. Moreover, this direct responsiveness to the m.w. 50,000 BCGF is localized in Leu-1+ tonsillar B cells. The Leu-1+ and Leu-1- tonsillar B cell subsets do not differ in their responsiveness to the m.w. 50,000 BCGF upon costimulation with anti-mu antibody and to the m.w. 20,000 BCGF regardless of the presence of anti-mu antibody.

One of these antibodies, CLB-CD 27/1 (clone 9F4), was grouped by the Third International Workshop and Conference on Human Leucocyte Differentiation Antigens together with three other monoclonal antibodies (VIT 14, OKT 18A, and S152) in the new cluster CD27. In this paper we show that antibodies belonging to this cluster recognize an antigen present on a large subset of peripheral T lymphocytes and most medullary thymocytes. At least two different nonoverlapping epitopes were identified with directly labeled monoclonal antibodies. Immunoprecipitation studies indicate that the target antigen of CD27 antibodies is a polypeptide of 55 kDa, which appears in the form of a disulfide-linked homodimer on the T lymphocyte membrane (Tp55). Stimulation of T cells via the T3/T cell antigen-receptor complex, with either phytohemagglutinin or CD3 monoclonal antibodies, resulted in a fivefold increase in the membrane expression of Tp55, whereas activation by phorbol myristate acetate caused a marked down-regulation. Moreover, an additional molecule of 32 kDa was precipitated from the membrane of activated but not of resting T cells. Addition of CD27 antibodies to cultures stimulated with either phytohemagglutinin or CD3 monoclonal antibody led to enhanced proliferation, whereas no effect was observed in phorbol myristate acetate or interleukin 2-stimulated cultures. The possible role of the Tp55 antigen in T cell activation is discussed.\r"

The PCA-inducing capability in OKT3 MoAb was abolished by absorption with T lymphocytes or Sepharose-conjugated antibody to mouse IgG. Most of the PCA in PBM was associated with monocytes. There was a dose-dependent increase in PCA when increasing numbers of T cells were added to the monocytes in the presence of OKT3 MoAb. OKT3 MoAb did not induce PCA in either T cells or monocytes alone. T cells pulsed with OKT3 MoAb only in the presence of monocytes could induce PCA in monocytes. Culture supernatants (CS) from PBM stimulated with OKT3 MoAb did not enhance PCA in monocytes; however, it did induce PCA in the human monocyte-like cell line (U937) which differs in some properties from monocytes; this activity could be abolished by the MoAb against human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Nevertheless, neither human IFN-gamma nor interleukin 1 or 2 had significant direct effect in inducing PCA in U937 cells; CS from either monocytes or T cells alone stimulated with OKT3 MoAb did not induce PCA in U937 cells. This apparent discrepancy suggests that there may be factors in CS that induce PCA in U937 cells only in the presence of IFN-gamma. The PCA induced in monocytes or U937 cells was tissue factor-like because of the dependence on coagulation factors V, VII, and X. These observations suggest that OKT3 MoAb is a potent T cell-dependent monocyte PCA inducer and stimulates T cells only in the presence of monocytes. The direct cellular interaction between monocytes and stimulated T cells appears to be necessary to elicit monocyte PCA with OKT3 MoAb stimulation. Thus, monocytes may play a dual role, not only as effector cells, but also as cells that collaborate with T cells after OKT3 MoAb stimulation so as to produce PCA.\r"

  ".U": "87309770\r", 
  ".W": "Human lactoferrin (LF)--a neutrophil glycoprotein, the body fluid levels of which increase in inflammatory conditions--stimulates the phagocytic and cytotoxic properties of macrophages. We found in this work that, whereas the presence of iron in the LF molecule was not required to increase the capacity of mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPM) to take up Trypanosoma cruzi amastigotes (AMA), Listeria monocytogenes, or latex particles, it was necessary for LF to enhance intracellular killing of the two microorganisms. Thus, iron-free human lactoferrin (ApoLF), which did not increase MPM cytotoxicity, after restoration of ferric ions prior to its use in MPM treatments or when ferric citrate was added to the culture medium immediately after ApoLF treatment of the MPM, does increase MPM cytotoxicity. In that iron ions cannot be internalized as such, the latter observation suggested that ApoLF had taken up iron while membrane bound and then enhanced killing. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that comparable proportions of MPM-bound ApoLF or LF at either 20 or 100% iron saturation without appreciable differences in fluorescence intensity. Therefore, reduced binding of ApoLF compared with LF was not a likely explanation for the lack of effect of ApoLF on MPM killing. LF did not enhance AMA killing by MPM in the presence of the iron chelator deferoxamine. Diethylaminetriamine-pentaacetic acid, an iron chelator which is not incorporated into cells, had a similar effect. The iron-binding protein transferrin did not alter the capacity of MPM to either take up or kill the AMA, indicating that the noted LF effects were not shared by all iron-binding proteins. However, prior treatment of MPM with transferrin enabled the cells to display a greater parasite killing capacity after ApoLF treatment, suggesting a role for iron in this activity. Whether iron is required for LF to impart the signal that elicits enhanced killing, to satisfy a biochemical requirement for more effective killing, or both, remains to be clarified. We also found that killing of internalized AMA by LF-treated MPM--previously reported to be mediated in part by H2O2, O2-., and 1O2--was inhibitable by scavengers of OH., and therefore, appears to involve this oxygen metabolite as well.\r"

After in vivo phagocytosis, the rate of in vitro intracellular killing of Listeria monocytogenes by bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-PPD-activated macrophages from CBA mice increased by a factor of 1.7 and that of those from C57BL/10 mice by a factor of 2.0, relative to the rate in normal resident macrophages. The increased listericidal activity of BCG-PPD-activated macrophages could not have been due to an increased number of peroxidase-positive macrophages because exudate macrophages obtained after i.p. injection of proteose peptone into BCG-infected mice or PPD into control mice, killed ingested Listeria about as efficiently as normal resident macrophages did. In contrast, BCG-PPD-activated macrophages from both mouse strains killed Salmonella somewhat less efficiently and Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus with the same efficiency as normal resident macrophages did. These cells, however, inhibited the intracellular replication of Toxoplasma gondii. Activated peritoneal macrophages from listeria-infected mice showed a similar increase of the rate of intracellular killing of Listeria and absence of change in rate of intracellular killing of Salmonella. Consistent with the in vitro findings, the number of viable L. monocytogenes in the spleen and liver of BCG-infected CBA and C57BL/10 mice decreased during the first 2 days after i.v. injection, whereas Salmonella typhimurium proliferated in these organs of both mouse strains. Checking the state of activation of BCG-PPD-activated macrophages showed that these cells displayed enhanced O2-consumption and H2O2 release after stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate compared with resident macrophages. The present findings show that the antimicrobial activity of immunologically activated macrophages is not uniformly increased: for certain microorganisms (L. monocytogenes, T. gondii), this effector function is enhanced, whereas for others (S. typhimurium, S. aureus, E. coli), it is not.\r"

Eighteen hours after i.p. injection of 10 to 1 X 10(4) U rIFN-gamma, resident and exudate peritoneal macrophages which had phagocytosed L. monocytogenes or S. typhimurium in vivo, killed both species in vitro just as efficiently as did resident macrophages of normal mice.

Checking the state of activation of rIFN-gamma-activated macrophages on the basis of two commonly used criteria for macrophage activation showed that rIFN-gamma-activated macrophages inhibited the intracellular replication of Toxoplasma gondii and displayed enhanced O2 consumption and H2O2 release after stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate compared with macrophages from normal CBA and C57BL/10 mice.

To begin to answer this question, we examined mu chain cDNA clones from human hybrid clone C6B2 producing anti-DNA antibodies. The sequence of the 500 base pair restriction fragment containing the variable region (5' terminus) was determined and was sequenced. This antibody uses a VHII heavy chain subgroup gene, a J3 joining segment, a hitherto unknown D segment, and a previously reported leader sequence. Significant homology was found to a mouse anti-DNA antibody sequence in the use of VH subgroup in J3, and in the hypervariable regions with a shared Ser-Tyr construction in CDR1 and an identical five amino acid residue stretch in CDR2. Comparison with the limited sequence data of published SLE monoclonal anti-DNA antibodies, both human and mouse, suggests that this shared Ser-Tyr may be important in some but not all antibodies to DNA.

Group I antibodies predominantly bear the T15 idiotype, and show appreciable affinity for the haptens PC and nitrophenyl PC (NPPC), whereas group II antibodies have appreciable affinity for NPPC only and are T15 idiotype negative. Previous studies indicated that group II binding characteristics may derive from the use of novel V gene segments not observed in group I antibodies. To determine the nature of VH gene usage in the group II antibody response, we examined the VH region of a prototype group II hybridoma, PCG1-1. The nucleotide sequence obtained from the VDJ region indicates that PCG1-1 utilizes a VH gene not observed in the group I response, one that belongs to the Q52 VH family. The PCG1-1 VH nucleotide sequence shares 97% identity with the myeloma M141 VH gene. In addition, PCG1-1 utilizes a D segment most closely related to DSP2.6 rearranged to JH-3. These data indicate that M141, a VH gene not seen in group I anti-PC antibodies is utilized by PCG1-1 to generate a PC-protein-binding group II antibody. PCG1-1 was previously shown to express the V kappa 1-3 light chain, a characteristic shared by several group II hybridomas. Furthermore, here we examined the VH gene rearrangements in four lambda 1-bearing group II hybridomas that share a common JH rearrangement with PCG1-1 by Southern blot analysis. A VH-specific probe that detects M141 VH rearrangements revealed that all four lambda 1 hybridomas as well as PCG1-1 share an identical VH gene rearrangement to JH-3. Thus the M141 VH gene product is able to utilize two distinct light chains to generate group II-like combining sites.\r"

Therefore, experiments were designed to investigate the intracellular signaling molecules regulating the appearance of HLA class II molecules or transcripts. The expression of HLA class II antigen induced by IFN-gamma was blocked by a calmodulin antagonist, W-7, but not by a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, H-7. Furthermore, a direct activator of PKC, phorbol myristate acetate, was not able to induce the HLA class II antigen expression. These results suggest that IFN-gamma induces HLA class II antigens on HL-60 cells via a calcium-calmodulin pathway and not via a PKC pathway. Calmodulin is activated by a transient rise in the cytosolic free calcium. In fact, the measurement of calcium influx into HL-60 cells showed that a remarkable and time-dependent calcium accumulation was caused by IFN-gamma, and that depletion of Ca2+ from culture medium resulted in failure of IFN-gamma to induce class II antigen expression. Furthermore, calcium ionophore, A23187, by itself induced HLA class II antigen expression. These results suggest that IFN-gamma stimulates calcium influx and activates the calmodulin branch of the calcium messenger system, resulting in the induction of class II antigen expression on HL-60 cells. On the other hand, cross-linking of FcR elicited the accumulation of intracellular cAMP, which appeared to suppress the IFN-gamma-induced calcium influx, resulting in annulling HLA class II antigen-inducing activity of IFN-gamma. These intracellular events of HL-60 regulate the expression of HLA class II transcripts and molecules.\r"

  ".W": "Allelic exclusion of immunoglobulin gene products results in the expression of only one of two possible alleles in normal B lineage cells. Attempts to define the role of heavy chain gene rearrangements in this process have revealed the nonexpressed allele to be rarely in its germline context, but rather incompletely rearranged (D/J rearrangements) or completely rearranged (V/D/J rearrangements) and in a context that cannot be expressed as a protein. Nearly all DNA sequences of heavy chain genes from the nonexpressed allele have originated from plasmacytomas, virus-induced pre-B leukemias, and hybridomas--all clonal cell lines perhaps altered by the neoplastic process. In this communication, we present the first examples of isolation and DNA sequence analysis of heavy chain gene rearrangements from the nonexpressed allele of normal B lymphocytes. Splenic B lymphocytes from allotype heterozygous (BALB/c X C57BL/6J)F1 mice expressing the BALB/c IgD allotype were detected with a monoclonal antibody, H10-4.22, to the BALB/c delta chain genetic marker and were isolated with a FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorter). lambda phage clones containing the JH gene region from the sorted cells were isolated, and those containing sequences derived from the C57BL/6J nonexpressed chromosome were identified by a restriction fragment length polymorphism. DNA sequences of seven rearranged clones from the nonexpressed allele are presented. Five of these rearrangements have unexpected compositions. Four of the five clones contain V/D/J rearrangements with no obvious impediments to expression generated by the rearrangements. The novel variable region gene in one of these V/D/J rearrangements is a member of a newly described VH gene family. The fifth clone has a 3.5 kb deletion removing all of the JH gene segments. The remaining two clones contain D/J rearrangements that are typical of the initial stage of variable region assembly. These findings suggest that the mechanisms that generate nontranslatable heavy chains do not exclusively account for allelic exclusion. Rather, several different mechanisms may contribute to the establishment of allelic exclusion in normal B lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "To understand the relative importance of germ-line genes in the generation of the functional human antibody repertoire, it is first necessary to define the number of variable region genes and to determine their fine structure. We have focused on the human VkIII variable region gene family because of its association with autoantibodies. A human genomic library was screened with a VkIII cDNA probe and subsequently with a VkIII germ-line gene probe. Seven different VkIII clones were isolated and characterized by restriction mapping and sequence analyses. Three clones have identical restriction enzyme sites over a 12-kilobase (kb) region, contain identical sequences over an 895-base pair (bp) region, and thus are likely to be different isolates of the same human VkIII gene. Another two clones have identical restriction enzyme sites over a 5-kb region, are identical over a stretch of 905 bp sequenced, and likely represent independent isolates of another human VkIII gene. The remaining two VkIII clones consist of two additional VkIII genes which are homologous to each other, but are quite different from the first two VkIII genes. Thus, four new human VkIII genes were defined. Together with four other VkIII genes previously isolated by other investigators, a total of eight human VkIII germ-like genes have now been described. A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of these genes with the reported amino acid sequences of all human VkIII light chains suggests that at least one additional VkIII gene exists in the germ line. Among the eight identified human germ-line VkIII genes, three are pseudogenes. Of the remaining five potential functional genes, one gene seems to encode a majority of the VkIII light chains which have been sequenced. Possible explanations for this phenomenon are discussed.\r"

Keyhole limpet hemocyanin-specific T helper cells were prepared from the lymph nodes of primed mice and were enriched for T cells. Enriched populations of trinitrophenyl-specific B cells were prepared from spleens of normal mice. In the presence of antigen, the keyhole limpet hemocyanin-specific T helper cells were able to induce proliferation and differentiation of the trinitrophenyl-specific B cells. However, when the T helper cells were first treated with an immunotoxin composed of Fab' fragments of anti-L3T4 antibody coupled to ricin A chain (Fab'-anti-L3T4-A), they failed to induce proliferation and differentiation of the antigen-specific B cells. The concentrations of Fab'-anti-L3T4-A required to inhibit T cell help for the proliferation and differentiation of trinitrophenyl-specific B cells by 50% were 1 X 10(-9)M and 4 X 10(-10) M, respectively.

  ".W": "Cell-surface gangliosides are presumed to play a role in cell growth and differentiation. With the use of monoclonal antibodies directed against GD3, a disialoganglioside expressed predominantly by cells of neuroectodermal origin, we have found that GD3 is expressed by a subpopulation of cells of the immune system including: 1) fetal thymocytes in subcortical regions and near vessels, 2) lymph node lymphocytes in interfollicular areas and near vessels, and 3) a small subset of T cells in the peripheral blood. Mouse monoclonal antibodies (two IgGs, one IgM, and F(ab')2 fragments) reacting with GD3 were found to stimulate proliferation of T cells derived from peripheral blood. Proliferation of T cells was observed even in cultures depleted of macrophages, suggesting that activation by anti-GD3 was not dependent on the presence of accessory cells. T cell proliferation was maximum between days 5 and 7 of stimulation and was preceded by expression of interleukin 2 receptors. No stimulation was observed with control antibodies of the identical isotype or with monoclonal antibodies recognizing the gangliosides GD2 or GM2. During stimulation by anti-GD3 monoclonal antibodies, there was an expansion of the GD3+ pool of T cells, but depletion of GD3+ T cells prior to stimulation abrogated the response. Proliferation induced by binding to GD3 could be augmented by exogenous interleukin 2 and phytohemagglutinin. Anti-CD3 (T3) monoclonal antibodies had little or no effect. These results demonstrate that binding to GD3 on the surface of T cells can elicit signals for T cell proliferation.\r"

  ".W": "Binding of the anti-cluster of differentiation (CD) 2 monoclonal antibody 9-1 causes an increase in the concentration of cytoplasmic-free calcium ([Ca2+]i) in cultured CD3-/CD16+ natural killer (NK) cells. This response did not occur in cultured CD3+/CD16- cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Anti-CD16 antibodies could partially block the calcium response when NK cells were stimulated with intact antibody 9-1, and antigen-binding fragment F(ab')2 of antibody 9-1 did not produce a calcium response. Thus an interaction of the 9-1 antibody with CD16 Fc receptors was required for the functional effect. The dual interaction of antibody 9-1 with both CD2 and CD16 was demonstrated by comodulation experiments. The cytolytic activity of cultured NK cells was increased by antibody 9-1 but not by F(ab')2 fragments of antibody 9-1. The enhanced lytic activity was blocked by anti-CD16 antibody, anti-CD18 antibody, and anti-CD2 antibodies that do not block the binding of antibody 9-1. This pattern was distinct from antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity which was blocked only by the anti-CD16 antibody. Thus antibody 9-1 enhanced cytotoxicity by activating effector cells. There was no enhancement of lytic activity when F(ab')2 of antibody 9-1 were cross-linked with a polyclonal antiglobulin, even though [Ca2+]i was increased. These results show that induction of a [Ca2+]i response is not sufficient to enhance lytic activity in NK cells, and suggest that signals delivered through CD16 are necessary.\r"

  ".U": "87309790\r", 
  ".W": "We had previously demonstrated that expression of the cross-reactive idiotypes (CRI) in the phenyltrimethylammonium (TMA) system depends on the presence of a second-order T helper (Th2) cell. Furthermore, we showed that this cell type can be replaced by an idiotype-specific helper factor derived from either a 24-hr concanavalin A supernatant (Con A) or the T cell hybridoma LOP 1.4. This factor, regardless of its source, is idiotype-specific, I-J+, and promotes in vitro expression of the cross-reactive phenyltrimethylammonium idiotype (CRI+-TMA) found on anti-trinitrophenyl antibodies. Because the expression of this idiotype in antigen-primed immune sera is linked to the Ig-1e heavy chain locus, experiments were conducted to test whether the production of this factor was also linked to the same locus. Of the strains tested, only splenocytes derived from the Ig-1e mice, irrespective of their background genetics, produced the factor upon Con A stimulation. Furthermore, the function of the factor is not major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted because Con A supernatants derived from the C57.Ige (H-2b, Ig-1e), NZB (H-2d, Ig-1e), and A.SW (H-2s, Ig-1e) strains promoted CRI+ trinitrophenyl plaque-forming cells in A/J (H-2a, Ig-1e) cultures. Further experiments were carried out to determine if the idiotype-specific factor could promote CRI+ TNP plaque-forming cells in non-Ig-1e strains. To this end, A/J Con A and LOP 1.4-derived supernatants were added to primed C57Bl/6 (H-2b, Ig-1b) and DBA/2 (H-2d, Ig-1c) splenic cultures, both of which do not express serum CRI-TMA or produce the idiotype-enhancing factor. The cultures from either strain in the presence of the factor produced CRI+-TMA trinitrophenyl plaque-forming cells of comparable numbers to the A/J prototype strain. The results suggest an important regulatory role for this factor in allotype-linked expression of dominant idiotypes.\r"

M.5 cells did not express class II major histocompatibility complex encoded (Ia) antigens constitutively, but these could be readily induced with interferon-gamma. We found that Ia expressing M.5 cells were ineffective in stimulating T cell proliferation when tested in a 4-day primary mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR). However, significant T cell stimulation was obtained when phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) was added either to the M.5-T cell co-cultures, or for a brief period to the M.5 cells prior to adding the responder T cells. Cytofluorographic analysis of M.5 cells disclosed that PMA did not significantly alter the expression of Ia antigens. Additional experiments indicated that interleukin 1 (IL-1) was unlikely to represent the co-stimulatory factor generated by PMA. This was based on the observations that M.5 cells failed to secrete significant IL-1 either spontaneously, or in the presence of various stimuli, and that murine recombinant IL-1 failed to substitute for PMA in the activation of T cells. The nature of the co-stimulatory signal is as yet unknown. We conclude from these experiments that a pure population of thyroid-derived epithelial cells may be able to function, under the described circumstances, as antigen presenting cells.\r"

FK506 inhibited concanavalin A response and allo-mixed lymphocyte reaction of murine splenic lymphocytes in a dose-dependent manner, and at 40- to 200-fold lower concentrations than CsA. Allo-cytolytic T lymphocyte induction from murine thymocytes was also inhibited by FK506, whereas the ability of cytolytic T lymphocyte to lyse targets was not affected by the agent. Immunosuppressive effects of FK506 were further characterized by using antigen specific-proliferative T lymphocyte clones, BC.21 and KO.6. FK506 inhibited the proliferation of T cell clones stimulated with specific antigens in a dose-dependent manner, and at about 100-fold lower concentrations than CsA. However, cloned T cells, once activated, were scarcely affected by the agent; interleukin-2 (IL-2) driven proliferation of cloned T cells was not inhibited. On the other hand, it was found that FK506 inhibited both IL-2 secretion and IL-2 receptor expression of BC.21 after stimulation with the specific antigen. FK506 also inhibited the proliferation of BC.21 stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate plus calcium ionophore, indicating that it directly affected the signaling pathway downward from the perturbation of the Ti/T3 complex. Finally, it was suggested that FK506 and CsA synergistically inhibited the antigen-driven proliferation of cloned T cells. These results indicate that the novel immunosuppressive agent, FK506, affects T cell activation with mechanisms similar to those of CsA but at considerably lower concentrations.\r"

  ".W": "Previous work has demonstrated that Ly-1 B cells from normal C57BL/6J mice help the response of B cell subsets to the 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl hapten (NP). This regulatory cell population, called BH, preferentially helps the expression of plaque-forming B cells which express a predominant set of serologically related determinants collectively known as the NPb idiotype family. The specificity of BH cell activity in the NP system is a reflection of NPb idiotype-specific BH cell surface receptors. Thus, BH cells recognize autologous (i.e., idiotype) antigens. Given these observations and previous associations of increased Ly-1 B cell frequency in autoimmune mice, it was hypothesized that autoreactive Ly-1 BH cells may be present in high frequencies and in an activated state in autoimmune mice. To test this hypothesis the immunologic activity of BH cells in autoimmune viable motheaten (mev/mev) mice was studied. It was determined that splenic BH cells are approximately 10 times more frequent in viable motheaten than normal mice. The fact that BH cells from viable motheaten mice are activated was suggested by the presence of NPb idiotype-specific BH replacing helper activity in sera or B cell supernatants from these autoimmune mice. The soluble helper activities constitutively produced in mev/mev splenic B cell cultures and detected in mev/mev serum were resolved into two moieties, an NPb idiotype-specific immunoglobulin and a nonimmunoglobulin lymphokine(s) fraction. Purified mev/mev B cell-derived B cell maturation factor could substitute for the lymphokine moiety in the NPb idiotype helper cell assay. These results suggest that at least two signals, anti-idiotype immunoglobulin and a late-acting B cell maturation factor, are required for BH-dependent helper activity. The relationships of these results to current concepts of B cell activation mechanisms and the possible association of Ly-1 BH cells with autoimmunity are discussed.\r"

Murine splenic B lymphocytes were purified and cultured with anti-Ig insolubilized onto Sepharose (anti-Ig/Sepharose) for 16 hr and labeled with [35S]methionine. Nuclei were isolated and the nuclear proteins were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Anti-Ig/Sepharose induced a prominent increase in the synthesis and abundance of a 40 kDa/pI 5 nuclear protein (p40/pI-5). Inhibition of anti-Ig/Sepharose-induced mitogenesis by pretreatment of the cells with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate was associated with a specific inhibition (63%) of p40/pI-5. Subcellular fractionation experiments showed that p40/pI-5 is not detected in the soluble fraction of resting or activated B cells, indicating that this protein is located exclusively in the nucleus. Analysis of the expression of p40/pI-5 relative the cell cycle showed that the synthesis of this protein was increased during G1 phase and gradually reduced during S phase of the cell cycle. Abundant amounts of p40/pI-5 were also found in the rapidly proliferating B lymphoma cells, WEHI-231, and growth arrest of these cells by anti-mu was found to be associated with a marked inhibition (68%) of this protein.

Nonadherent low density T lymphocyte-depleted marrow cells were sorted on a Coulter Epics 753 dye laser flow cytometry system with the use of Texas Red-labeled anti-My10 and phycoerythrin conjugated anti-HLA-DR. Cells were separated into populations with nondetectable expression of antigens (DR-My10-) or with constant expression of one antigen and increasing densities of the other antigen. More than 98% of the CFU-GM, BFU-E, and CFU-GEMM were found in fractions containing cells expressing both HLA-DR and My10 antigens. The cloning efficiency (CE) of cells in the DR-My10- cell fraction was 0.01%. In the antigen-positive sorted fractions, the CE was highest (up to 47%) in the fractions of cells expressing high My10 and low DR (My10 DR+) antigens and was lowest (2.5%) in the fraction of cells expressing low My10 and low DR (My10+DR+) antigens. Populations of cells varying in the density of HLA-DR, but not My10, antigens varied in the proportion and types of progenitor cells present. When My10-positive cells were sorted for HLA-DR density expression, the CE for CFU-GM was similar in the DR+ and DR++ fractions, but most of the BFU-E and CFU-GEMM were found in the DR+ fraction. Within the CFU-GM compartment, most of the eosinophil progenitors were found in the DR+ fraction, whereas a greater proportion of macrophage progenitors were detected in the DR++ fraction. CFU-GM and BFU-E in the fractions of cells positive for DR and My10 were assessed for responsiveness to the effects of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-alpha, recombinant human interferon-gamma, and prostaglandin E1. Colony formation from CFU-GM was suppressed by the three molecules, and colony formation by BFU-E was suppressed by recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma and enhanced, in the presence of T lymphocyte-conditioned medium, by prostaglandin E1 in all antigen-positive fractions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The inoculation of B6D2F1 mice with T lymphocytes from the C57BL/6 parental strain induces an \"immunosuppressive\" graft-vs-host reaction (B6 GVH), whereas inoculation of T cells from the other, DBA/2 parental strain induces an \"immunostimulatory\" GVH reaction and a lupus-like disease (DBA GVH). The present study compares cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) function in the spleens of these GVH mice as well as differences in the donor inoculum that could account for these different types of GVH. We observed that the B6 GVH induces an immunodeficiency that encompasses CTL precursors (and possibly T helper cells) and results in suppressor cells that abrogate responses to both trinitrophenyl (TNP)-modified self and third party alloantigens. In contrast, the DBA GVH induces only a T helper cell immunodeficiency and results in suppressor cells selective for class II restricted L3T4+ T helper cells. Chimeric T cells were detected in both types of GVH. In the B6 GVH both L3T4+ and Lyt-2+ donor cells were observed, although Lyt-2+ cells predominated. In the DBA GVH, donor T cells were almost exclusively of the L3T4+ phenotype. The lack of appreciable donor Lyt-2+ cells in the DBA GVH can be explained by a defect in the DBA donor inoculum manifested by a naturally occurring two-fold reduction in Lyt-2+ cell numbers as well as a nine-fold reduction in CTL precursors with anti-F1 specificity. T cells in the DBA inoculum, therefore, are predominantly L3T4+. A similar defect induced in B6 donor cells by anti-Lyt2 antibody and complement not only converted the suppressive GVH to a stimulatory GVH, as measured by anti-DNA antibodies, but also resulted in a T cell immune deficiency characteristic of the DBA GVH, i.e., a selective loss of the TNP-self CTL response. Thus the presence or absence of adequate numbers of functioning Lyt-2+ cells in the donor inoculum is correlated with the development of either a suppressive or stimulatory GVH, respectively. That donor Lyt-2+ cells mediate a suppressive GVH through cytolytic mechanisms is evidenced by greater than 70% reduction in B6 GVH spleen cell numbers and readily demonstrable anti-F1 CTL activity by these spleen cells despite an inability to generate anti-allogeneic or anti-TNP self CTL activity even in the presence of added T helper factors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Several recent reports have shown that diets in which the only source of fat was fish oil can modify the course of diseases with an inflammatory or immune component. In these experiments we examined the effect of a fish oil diet on experimental amyloidosis in mice. In most azocasein-treated mice, amyloid deposits were found in the spleen, varying from a trace to wide and contiguous perifollicular bands. The spleens of mice receiving fish oil had significantly less amyloid than did spleens of mice fed corn oil. A marked increase in spontaneous blastogenesis that occurred in azocasein-treated mice on corn oil was suppressed in azocasein-treated mice on fish oil. Substitution of the unsaturated fatty acids of corn oil with those of fish oil was also found to modify the prostaglandin profile of macrophages. This altered profile may change cellular immune function and/or enhance the processing of serum amyloid A to retard the induction of secondary amyloidosis in mice.\r"

  ".W": "The objectives of these studies were to study the effects of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-induced Fc receptor expression on human monocytes and to examine whether these effects were mediated through stimulation of interleukin 1 (IL-1) production. Fc receptor expression was determined by binding of monomeric monoclonal murine immunoglobulin (Ig)G2a and cytofluorographic analysis. IL-1 activity in monocyte supernatants and lysates was assayed by augmentation of mitogen-induced murine thymocyte proliferation. IFN-gamma induced the expression of Fc receptors on human monocytes that were specific for murine IgG2a. This induction was inhibited by the addition of LPS in amounts as low as 2 to 8 pg/ml. LPS inhibition of IFN-gamma-induced Fc receptor expression was paralleled by the appearance of IL-1 in monocyte lysates and supernatants. The addition of purified human or recombinant IL-1 beta at the initiation of culture similarly inhibited the expression of IFN-gamma-induced Fc receptors on the monocytes. LPS also inhibited Fc receptor expression on the human myelomonocytic cell line THP-1 after induction with IFN-gamma or phorbol myristate acetate alone or with both agents together. This inhibition also was paralleled by the production of IL-1 but the addition of exogenous IL-1 to the THP-1 cells had no effect on IFN-gamma-induced Fc receptor expression. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibited IFN-gamma-induced Fc receptor expression on human monocytes but was much less potent than comparable amounts of IL-1. TNF also did not inhibit Fc receptor expression on THP-1 cells. In fact, IL-1 or TNF led to an enhancement in IFN-gamma-induced Fc receptor expression on THP-1 cells. These results indicate that LPS can inhibit IFN-gamma-induced Fc receptor expression on human monocytes and that IL-1 and TNF may mediate these effects of LPS. Thus, an autocrine or paracrine role is suggested for these cytokines. The possibility exists that intracellular IL-1 resulting from LPS stimulation may be at least in part responsible for inhibition of Fc receptor expression.\r"

In the present study, alpha 2M \"fast\" forms antagonized the increase in MP HLA-DR and Ia expression induced in vitro by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). This effect was observed with human peritoneal MP, as well as MP from peptone-injected and bacillus Calmette-Guerin-infected mice of three strains. alpha 2M-trypsin, which had been reacted with aprotinin and alpha 2M-methylamine, both of which lack proteolytic activity, also antagonized interferon-induced Ia expression. alpha 2M \"fast\" forms also reduced the ability of MP to serve as accessory cells for lectin-induced lymphocyte proliferation. alpha 2M \"fast\" form is an immune modulator of human and murine MP function, probably through a specific receptor-mediated mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "The murine interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor is a 55- to 60-kDa glycoprotein (p58) that binds IL-2 at a high and low affinity. In this investigation, we have identified sublines of EL4 that vary in their capacity to express high affinity IL-2 receptors after transfection of the IL-2 receptor cDNA. These and other cell populations were used to determine whether unique membrane molecules were specifically associated with the high affinity IL-2 receptor. Irreversible chemical cross-linking of [125I]IL-2 to only high affinity IL-2 receptors resulted in detection of IL-2 cross-linked to p58 as a 70- to 75-kDa band and other complexes of 90 to 95 kDa, 115 kDa, 150 kDa, 170 to 190 kDa, and 245 kDa. Antibodies specific for p58 resulted in precipitation of each of these complexes. However, disruption of noncovalent interactions prior to immunoprecipitation resulted in an inability to detect the material at 90 to 95 kDa. Therefore, we conclude that this complex most likely represented IL-2 cross-linked to a 75- to 80-kDa subunit that was noncovalently associated with p58. The other complexes greater than 150 kDa may represent these subunits cross-linked to each other. The detection of all the cross-linked complexes larger than 75 kDa appeared to be directly related to formation of high affinity IL-2 receptors because IL-2 was cross-linked only to p58 for three cell lines that exclusively expressed low affinity IL-2 receptors. Thus, high affinity murine IL-2 receptors are comprised of at least one alpha (p58)- and beta (p75)-subunit. Our data also raise the possibility of a more complex subunit structure.\r"

IL-2R expression was assessed by flow cytometric analysis with a monoclonal antibody to IL-2R (anti-TAC). TNF-alpha, like IL-1 beta, induced increased levels of IL-2R expression on YT cells with similar kinetics of induction. Maximum induction occurred at 20 to 30 hr. On a molar basis. TNF was less active than IL-1 beta. RNA isolated from TNF-alpha- or IL-1 beta-treated YT cells contained increased levels of IL-2R-specific mRNA as indicated by slot blot analysis by using an IL-2R-specific mRNA probe. Kinetic and IL-1 beta mRNA expression studies indicated that the TNF effect was a direct one. Because IL-2R expression is known to be associated with lymphocyte activation, the present results suggest that TNF-alpha may play a role in the regulation of immune responses.\r"

T cell help was provided against the carrier protein, hemocyanin, to which cyt c and its peptides were conjugated by using glutaraldehyde. All the B cells activated by both of the fragments elicited antibodies that reacted with intact cyt c in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, whereas only a fraction of the antibodies elicited by the intact protein reacted with the peptides. However, in general, antibodies reactive with the polypeptide fragments, whether elicited by the intact protein or by the fragments, could not be effectively inhibited from binding plate-bound cyt c in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the presence of soluble native cyt c. This indicates that these antibodies are specific for denatured forms of cyt c that apparently arise during the chemical coupling of cyt c to carrier molecules for immunization and/or during emulsification of the immunogen in adjuvant. Whereas, at most, 5% of the secondary B cells specific for native cyt c could be activated by the 1-80 fragment, even fewer were activated by the 66-104 fragment. Therefore, it is unlikely that smaller peptides which fail to assume native conformation would be effective. Antibodies elicited in vivo in a primary response to the 1-80 fragment also failed to bind native cyt c. These results suggest that linear peptides intended to mimic epitopes on globular proteins, and which have not been engineered to adopt native conformation, will not be very effective either as primary or as secondary vaccines for B cell activation.\r"

Cells expressing V beta 5 gene segments can have cytotoxic or helper function, be of the T4+ or T8+ phenotype, and have specificity for either class I or class II major histocompatibility complex alloantigens. Seven T cell clones were generated, which express V beta 5 and are specific for the HLA-A2 molecule. With the use of these clones, we illustrate how isoelectric focusing can be used to analyze T cell receptor alpha- and beta-chain structure. The seven clones recognize five distinct conformational determinants on HLA-A2. They procure different binding sites by the use of different alpha-chains, J beta sequences, or both.\r"

The results demonstrate that both chains are capable of eliciting antibodies that, after appropriate adsorption, behave like conventional anti-Id62 antibodies prepared against the intact antibody molecule. By direct radioimmunoassay binding, competition of Id binding and Western blot anti-H62 and anti-L62 antibodies identify as Id-positive the same group of IgG1, bind in a reciprocal fashion to H- and L-chains of parental monoclonal antibody 62, and detect Id62-positive polyclonal serum autoantibodies to thyroglobulin. We conclude that monoclonal antibody 62 expresses independently a similar Id on both polypeptide chains and the intact antibody molecule, or its isolated chains, induce qualitatively similar anti-Id responses. These results are discussed in light of the possible structure/function implication such autoantibodies may have within the Id network.\r"

  ".W": "Preexposure of resident mouse peritoneal macrophages for 1 hr to traces of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (less than or equal to 1 ng/ml) rendered the cells refractory to activation by recombinant interferon-gamma (rIFN gamma) or recombinant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (rTNF alpha), as evaluated by release of H2O2 upon stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate. Inhibition persisted for at least 4 days. Fifty percent inhibition of activation mediated by rIFN gamma followed 1 hr exposure to 10 pg/ml LPS. Fifty percent inhibition of activation mediated by rTNF alpha was achieved with 1 hr exposure to 1 pg/ml LPS. Such low levels LPS exposures (concentration X time) are far below those reported for many other actions of LPS on host cells. Inhibition was partially prevented by the cyclooxygenase inhibitors indomethacin, ibuprofen, and acetylsalicylic acid. Exogenous prostaglandins PGE1 and PGE2, and the 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate analog dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), mimicked the inhibitory effect of LPS in a dose-dependent manner, consistent with the hypothesis that formation of endogenous cyclooxygenase products in response to LPS may elevate intracellular cAMP and that the latter may mediate the observed inhibition. In addition, neutralizing antibody against IFN alpha and IFN beta selectively prevented LPS inhibition of activation mediated by rIFN gamma, but not by rTNF alpha. This suggests that IFN alpha and/or IFN beta induced by LPS also contributed to inhibition of activation by rIFN gamma. Thus, release of LPS may afford microorganisms a means by which to interfere with immunologically mediated enhancement of the respiratory burst-dependent antimicrobial capacity of macrophages.\r"

In addition to an analysis of precursor frequency and light chain diversity, we studied sera and culture supernatants containing human anti-influenza antibodies with a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies specific for idiotopes identified on murine anti-PR8 and anti-X-31 antibodies. An idiotypic specificity present on the X-31-specific murine monoclonal PY206 has previously been shown to be shared by murine antibodies specific for PR8, X-31, and other influenza viruses. We observed little correlation among the following parameters: anti-viral titer, serum idiotope content, precursor frequency and immune status. More interestingly, there was a striking predominance of human influenza-specific antibodies that utilized lambda light chains. In addition, 12 of 26 human anti-influenza monoclonals strongly inhibited the binding of one of the murine anti-idiotopes to the labeled murine antibody, PY206. This is the same idiotope that is shared among murine antiinfluenza antibodies and all six individuals studied contained clones reactive with this anti-idiotope. Seven of these 12 idiotope-positive human antibodies gave partial cross-reactivity in a second anti-idiotypic system. These observations imply that a significant level of homology exists between the binding sites of human and murine influenza-specific antibodies and suggest that idiotypic manipulation of the human immune response to influenza virus may have important therapeutic implications.\r"

This immunity can be passively transferred to naive recipients with maximal protection conferred by spleen cells obtained from donors 6 days after immunization. Immunity that can be directly transferred to syngeneic recipients is surprisingly short lived. Cell recipients lose immunity as early as 72 hr after transfer, and recipients express no detectable immunity after 1 wk. This short lived immunity requires both L3T4+ and Lyt-2+ T cell populations for full expression. Both the level of immunity transferred and the duration of the protective response expressed in recipients are dramatically increased if the spleen cell population is cultured in vitro with concanavalin A before cell transfer. Recipients of concanavalin A-activated cells express antigen-specific levels of immunity increased 100- to 1000-fold compared with syngeneic recipients of directly transferred immune spleen cells. In addition, this elevated level of adoptively transferred immunity remains constant for at least 8 wk. Transfer of this culture-enhanced immunity requires only an Lyt-2+ T cell population and is not influenced by cells of the L3T4+T cell subpopulation. Both direct as well as culture-enhanced transfer of immunity require major histocompatibility complex-compatible recipients. These findings suggest that two phenotypically distinct T cell subpopulations function in the development of the immune response to L. monocytogenes and that only one cell subpopulation is required for expression of immunity to this intracellular parasite.\r"

We assayed the effect of IFN-gamma on parasite growth by DNA hybridization using a P. berghei specific DNA probe. The specific activity of IFN-gamma against EEF is very high, and depends upon the time of lymphokine addition. When IFN-gamma is added to HEPG2 cells containing intracellular EEF, 6 hr after sporozoite invasion, parasite DNA replication is inhibited by approximately 75% at 10(3) U/ml and 50% at 1 U/ml. This treatment can either abolish or greatly reduce the infectivity of EEF for mice. When added earlier, 3 hr after completion of sporozoite invasion, IFN-gamma inhibits parasite replication to an even greater degree. The highest levels of inhibition were obtained when IFN-gamma was added 6 hr prior to sporozoite invasion (100% inhibition at 10(2) U/ml, approximately 55% inhibition at 0.1 U/ml, and 17% inhibition at 0.001 U/ml). We found that HEPG2 cells express approximately 44,000 surface receptors for IFN-gamma. These data are consistent with the view that IFN-gamma exerts its antimalarial activity by binding to surface receptors on hepatocytes and inducing intracellular changes unfavorable for parasite development. Tryptophan starvation does not appear to be involved in this process. These findings also support the idea that IFN-gamma, released from immune T cells upon encountering sporozoite antigen, may be an important effector mechanism in sterile immunity to sporozoite challenge.\r"

The results presented herein strongly suggest that the L3T4+ subpopulation play a pivotal role in the immunologic control of BCG infection because the depletion of L3T4+ cells led to a dramatic increase in the number of viable bacteria. Depletion of Lyt-2+ cells had no significant effect on the course of infection. These results were confirmed by using adoptive transfer experiments which showed that protective immunity was mediated by L3T4+ cells generated in the spleen as a result of infection. Moreover, T cells capable of controlling the recurrence of BCG multiplication from residual bacteria remaining in organs after the recovery from infection were shown to belong to the L3T4+ subpopulation.\r"

  ".W": "A monoclonal IgE antibody was prepared by fusion of NS-1 myeloma cells with spleen cells of C3H/He mice immunized with an extract of adult worms of Schistosoma japonicum (Sj). The antibody was able to elicit passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in the rat skin against Sj with the highest titer of 1/256,000 in an ascitic form but did not cross-react with any of antigens extracted from S. mansoni, Fasciola hepatica, Paragoniumus westermani, or Trichinella spiralis. Western blot analysis indicated that the monoclonal IgE antibody recognized epitopes on molecules of 82 kDa, 97 kDa, 160 kDa, and 200 kDa, at least some of which were recognized by IgG antibodies of patients with chronic schistosomiasis japonica. The IgE antibody also recognized a 97-kDa antigen expressed on the surface of mechanically transformed schistosomula. Passive transfer of the antibody into mice in an early stage of challenge infection resulted in a partial but significant reduction of recovery of adult worms. However, similar treatment was not effective for the protection if the antibody was given in the postlung stage of the infection. Moreover, eosinophil-mediated damage to schistosomula was observed in vitro in the presence of the monoclonal anti-Sj IgE antibody, whereas the damage was not observed in the presence of another monoclonal IgE antibody with dinitrophenyl specificity.\r"

No hepatitis B virus envelope antigen-specific cell lines were established. Proliferation in response to recombinant and native HBcAg, but not to native hepatitis B surface antigen containing the pre-S(2) region, confirmed the specificity of the five T cell lines. All cell lines represented mixed populations of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The CD4+ subset provided antigen-specific help to autologous B cells with respect to anti-HBc production and to CD8+ cells with regard to HBcAg-induced proliferation and suppressor activity. The CD8+ subset contained suppressor cells that selectively inhibited the proliferative response of autologous HBcAg-specific CD4+ cells without inhibiting CD4+ cells of unrelated specificity (tetanus toxoid). Moreover, the CD8+ cells were also capable of suppressing HBcAg-stimulated antibody to HBcAg production without showing inhibition of total immunoglobulin production stimulated by pokeweed mitogen. The cytotoxic potential of the T cell lines was established in a lectin-dependent cytotoxicity system; natural killer cytotoxicity was completely absent. Our data suggest that the lesional T cells present at the site of hepatocellular injury in chronic active hepatitis B are primarily HBcAg-specific lymphocytes of the helper and suppressor/cytotoxic phenotypes and that both are functionally competent.\r"

The effects of antiproliferative dosages of stable cAMP-derivative, 8-bromoadenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (8-Br-cAMP), on steady state mRNA expression stimulated by IL-2 was examined. IL-2 stimulated mRNA accumulation of three nuclear proto-oncogenes c-fos, c-myc, and c-myb. 8-Br-cAMP alone stimulated c-fos, c-myb, and IL-2 receptor mRNA accumulation as determined by Northern blot analysis. 8-Br-cAMP, however, markedly inhibited c-myc expression stimulated by IL-2. Furthermore, although c-fos and IL-2 receptor mRNA expression was potentiated by 8-Br-cAMP, suppression of protein synthesis was seen. We show that antiproliferative cAMP stimulates similar mRNA expression as does IL-2, with the exception of c-myc. Although a comparative stimulation of steady state mRNA accumulation of some genes occurs, cAMP may profoundly effect protein synthesis. cAMP, therefore, acts on multiple targets involved in the macromolecular events stimulated by IL-2.\r"

Screening of supernatants with control and IFN-gamma-treated melanoma cells showed that the mAb CL203 and CL207 display preferential reactivity with IFN-gamma-treated melanoma cells. The two mAb recognize the same (or spatially close) determinant on a 96,000 MAA which has a density of 0.36 X 10(6) antigenic sites/cell on untreated melanoma cells Colo 38 and of 1.39 X 10(6) and 1.54 X 10(6) on melanoma cells Colo 38 treated with IFN-gamma (final concentration, 200 U/ml) for 24 and 48 hr, respectively. The effect of IFN-gamma on the 96,000 MAA is dose- and time-dependent, reversible, and blocked by inhibitors of RNA and protein synthesis. Furthermore, the effect of IFN-gamma on the induction of the 96,000 MAA appears to be specific, inasmuch as IFN-alpha and IFN-beta do not induce the expression of the 96,000 MAA. The latter is also induced by IFN-gamma in a variety of carcinoma cell lines, but its level is markedly lower than on melanoma cells. Furthermore, the apparent m.w. of the antigen synthesized by the carcinoma cell lines in the presence of IFN-gamma ranges between 93,000 and 96,000. This molecular heterogeneity appears to reflect differences in the degree of glycosylation of the polypeptide moiety because the antigen synthesized by a variety of cell lines in the presence of tunicamycin has an apparent m.w. of 51,000.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously demonstrated that following the adoptive transfer of immune cells, the regression of established pulmonary metastases from a weakly immunogenic sarcoma, MCA 105, required the collaboration of two T cell subsets. In this study, we found that the critical role played by L3T4+ immune cells was to provide a helper function since tumor regression proceeded in the absence of L3T4+ immune cells if exogenous interleukin 2 (IL-2) was administered. To extend these observations, we analyzed the events leading to the induction and generation of L3T4+ and Lyt-2+ immune T cells after immunization of mice with viable tumor cells admixed with Corynebacterium parvum. The basic protocol involved immunization, surgical excision of the immunization site on day 7, and challenge with viable tumor cells on day 21. The ability of mice to reject tumor challenge provided a means to evaluate the occurrence of a systemic antitumor immunity. With the use of this experimental protocol, we have found that depletion of T cell subsets in vivo with either L3T4 or Lyt-2 monoclonal antibodies after active immunization abrogated the development of antitumor immunity. Mice immunized and depleted of L3T4+ but not Lyt-2+ T cells were able to reject tumor challenge if exogenous IL-2 was given for 7 days. However, the rejection of tumor challenge required 3 days of additional exogenous IL-2 administration. These results indicate that the induction of Lyt-2+ immune T cells depended on the helper function of L3T4+ T cells via the secretion of IL-2. In the absence of L3T4+ immune lymphocytes, the expression of antitumor immunity by Lyt-2+ immune cells could be facilitated by in vivo administration of exogenous IL-2. The induction of L3T4+ immune T cells, on the other hand, occurred independently of the Lyt-2+ T cell response because the transfer of spleen cells from Lyt-2+ cell-depleted, immunized animals was able to restore antitumor reactivity in L3T4+ cell-depleted, immunized mice. These results demonstrate the intricate cellular interactions leading to the induction as well as the expression of antitumor immunity.\r"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate comparative IF titers using human skin (HS) as substrate with variations in the buffers employed. Substrates (ME or HS) were incubated in PBS, Tris-acetate-buffered saline (TAS), TAS with 5 mM CaCl+2 (TAS-Ca+2), and PBS or TAS with 1 mM EDTA, prior to incubation with pemphigus or pemphigoid sera for indirect IF. We examined sera from 11 patients with pemphigus vulgaris (PV), 10 patients with Brazilian pemphigus foliaceus (BPF), and 4 patients with bullous pemphigoid. In 20 of 21 pemphigus sera, endpoint indirect IF titers were highest on normal skin with TAS-Ca+2. Six sera (2 PV and 4 BPF) had endpoints that were 5 double dilutions higher than the endpoints obtained with ME and PBS. Six sera (3 PV and 3 BPF) were 4 double dilutions higher, 7 sera (3 PV and 4 BPF) were 2-3 double dilutions higher, and 2 PV sera were equivalent with both substrate/buffers. Preincubation of either tissue with EDTA prior to indirect IF abolished PV and BPF antibody binding completely. Exposure to EDTA after the tissue was incubated with PV or BPF sera did not affect indirect IF titers. In the presence of Ca+2, the antigen was resistant to trypsin in concentrations of 0.001%; however, in the absence of added Ca+2 it was destroyed by 0.0001% trypsin. These differences were not observed with bullous pemphigoid sera; all 4 sera had similar endpoint indirect IF titers. This study shows a significant increase in the sensitivity of indirect IF assays for pemphigus autoantibodies by the use of Ca+2-supplemented buffers on human skin. This finding may also have implications for procedures designed to purify and/or detect pemphigus antigens.\r"

At a median follow-up time of 45 months, treatment with each of these combinations resulted in the same remission rates (80% and 74%, respectively) and exactly the same progression-free survival and overall survival (median, 26 months). Despite adequate hydration, more renal toxicity was encountered in the CP-treated patients than in those who received CHAP-5. Disabling neurotoxicity and severe myelosuppression were encountered more frequently in the patients treated with CHAP-5. Because the toxicity was lower and CP treatment required shorter hospitalization, the single-day regimen was considered preferable for future use. The Karnofsky index was the only independent predictor for response, whereas both this index and the size of residual tumor before chemotherapy were predictive of survival. After correcting for other prognostic factors, it was determined that tumor size associated with improved survival was less than 1 cm. The site of metastases in International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IV patients did not influence survival within this category. The results of this study confirm our previous findings that patients with microscopic remnants at second-look have a survival similar to that of patients who are histopathologically free of disease. This makes the significance of so-called pathologically confirmed complete remission questionable. The survival benefit of debulking surgery performed during chemotherapy seems only minimal for patients in whom debulking has already been attempted before treatment. Like others, we have found the CP regimen to have a good therapeutic index.\r"

The treatment regimen consisted of 12 cycles of therapy administered every 3 weeks. After evaluation of the tumor response to chemotherapy alone, radiation or surgery was used to eradicate residual sites of metastatic disease where possible. At the present time, 77 patients are evaluable for response to the chemotherapy; 43 of the patients have experienced a significant reduction in the tumor size in response to the chemotherapy alone (39 partial responses [PR] and four complete responses [CR]). Sixteen of 17 patients with Ewing's sarcoma, nine of 13 with rhabdomyosarcoma, four of eight with peripheral neuroepithelioma, three of eight with osteosarcoma, and 11 of 31 with other tumors have responded with a PR or CR. The toxicity of the regimen was acceptable. Moderate or severe toxicity evaluated on a per cycle basis included: neutropenia, 97%; thrombocytopenia, 32%; nephrotoxicity, less than 1%; mucositis, 1%; neurologic toxicity, 2%; nausea and vomiting, 13%; hemorrhagic cystitis, less than 1%. Fever was present after 33% of cycles and sepsis following 7%. One patient died due to sepsis and pancytopenia. At the present time, only seven of the 43 patients who responded to the chemotherapy regimen have relapsed, with a median follow-up of 10 weeks after the response. This drug combination is highly active in the treatment of recurrent sarcomas and other tumors in children and young adults.\r"

  ".W": "We have been able to detect soluble interleukin-2 receptors (IL-2R) in pretreatment sera from 80 patients with undifferentiated lymphoma (predominantly Burkitt's lymphoma) and lymphoblastic lymphoma. The demonstration of IL-2R in lymphoma-derived cell lines by immunoprecipitation and direct staining indicates that IL-2R is synthesized by the tumor cells. Comparisons were made with two other subject groups: 42 sarcoma patients and 17 normal individuals. The distribution of soluble IL-2R values for lymphoma patients (geometric mean, 1,132 U/mL) was significantly greater than that of sarcoma patients (geometric mean, 332 U/mL; P = .0001) or normal individuals (geometric mean, 238 U/mL; P = .0001). Patients with undifferentiated lymphoma stages B, C, and D had significantly higher soluble IL-2R values (geometric mean, 1,648 U/mL) than stages A and AR (geometric mean, 706 U/mL; P = .0001) or lymphoblastic lymphoma (geometric mean, 826 U/mL; P = .0002). Within the lymphoma group, the soluble IL-2R level was found to be the most significant prognostic indicator of disease-free interval and survival when compared with other previously recognized factors such as histology, stage, bone marrow involvement at presentation, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), uric acid (UA), and age. No factor was significantly associated with response to therapy, ie, the initial achievement of complete remission (CR) status, although small numbers of patients with a partial response limit interpretation. Soluble IL-2R levels were measured serially in two patients and were found to be elevated at presentation or relapse and to decrease to normal levels during periods of disease remission. IL-2R appears to reflect tumor burden and may prove to be a useful and specific marker for lymphoid tumors.\r"

The median baseline value for testosterone was 14.4 nmol/L.

Over the 12-wk period elvers given both dietary treatments increased in weight by fourfold. The proportion of arachidonic acid, 20:4n-6, present in polar lipids of elvers fed the diet containing corn oil increased from an initial value of 5% by weight to 12% by weight; the corresponding value for elvers given a diet containing fish oil, with little linoleic acid in it, was less than 4% by weight. The capacity of this fish to modify dietary linoleic acid metabolically was confirmed by examining the metabolic fate of radioactive carbon after giving [1-14C]linoleic acid orally to eels. Seven days after administration of the linoleic acid approximately 10% of the radioactivity recovered in liver fatty acids was present in trienes and tetraenes with about 4% occurring in arachidonic acid. Compositional analyses from the feeding experiment also indicated that dietary docosaenoic acid, 22:1n-11, is preferentially oxidized by eels.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were conducted with young pigs to evaluate the effects of excess lysine when added to diets marginal in arginine. The basal diet was formulated to contain 1.15% lysine and 0.53% arginine. Lysine levels above this were achieved by incremental additions of L-lysine.HCl (experiment 1) or L-lysine acetate (experiment 2). Neither weight gain nor gain-feed ratio was lowered in pigs fed twice the recommended level of lysine (i.e., 2.30%). Lysine levels three or four times the basal level, however, lowered both weight gain and feed intake with no commensurate reduction in feed efficiency. Therefore, lysine appeared to reduce growth via amino acid imbalance rather than antagonism. In pigs equally fed isonitrogenous diets, urea N excretion in the urine was lower in those fed 3.45% supplemental lysine (4.6% total lysine) than in those fed the basal diet. This was offset by a dramatic elevation in urinary excretion of basic amino acids. Urinary excretion of lysine accounted for 26.2% of the lysine consumed by pigs fed 3.45% supplemental lysine. Free lysine levels as well as alpha-aminoadipic acid levels were markedly higher in plasma, liver, kidney and muscle of pigs fed excess lysine than in those fed the basal diet. Tissue levels of arginase and ornithine transcarbamoylase were uninfluenced by the level of lysine ingested.\r"

Before therapy, blood glucose concentration was 608.4 +/- 142.2 mg/dL and base excess -21 +/- 1.9 mmol/L. The calculated volume depletion was 2505 +/- 1005 mL/1.73 m2. At the onset of the study, the plasma concentration of ANP (5.3 +/- 1.2 fmol/L) was low, and concentrations of AVP (159 +/- 44 pg/mL), PRA (59 +/- 19 ng angiotensin l/mL/hr), aldosterone (114 +/- 11 ng/dL), norepinephrine (430 +/- 67 pg/mL), and cortisol (33 +/- 2.1 micrograms/dL) were markedly elevated. Fluid replacement raised plasma ANP concentration, which reached physiologic levels on the first day of therapy. PRA, aldosterone, norepinephrine, and cortisol also normalized during the first 24 hours of therapy, whereas AVP remained above the physiologic range at 20.4 +/- 6.8 pg/mL on the third day. Our data indicate that in diabetic ketoacidosis, volume depletion, enhanced sodium excretion, and hyponatremia activated vasoconstrictor and sodium-retaining hormone systems and that secretion of the natriuretic and vasodilator hormone ANP is suppressed. All of these hormonal alterations seem directed at maintaining adequate fluid volume and sodium homeostasis.\r"

  ".W": "The plasma alpha-atrial natriuretic polypeptide (alpha-ANP) concentration in the peripheral veins of children with congenital heart diseases was measured by radioimmunoassay and compared with cardiac catheterization data. Every patient with heart failure had a higher alpha-ANP concentration (132.1 to 858.7 pg/mL) than the upper limit of the normal range (11.7 to 98.7 pg/mL), whereas more than half of the patients without heart failure had a normal alpha-ANP concentration. Although none of the 13 children with atrial septal defect had heart failure, their mean (+/- SD) plasma alpha-ANP concentration (99.4 +/- 40.7 pg/mL) was significantly higher than that in control children (44.6 +/- 22.3 pg/mL). The plasma alpha-ANP concentration was significantly correlated with the pulmonary blood flow/systemic blood flow (Qp/Qs) ratio in the children with atrial septal defect. In the 34 children with ventricular septal defect the plasma alpha-ANP concentration increased in relation to increasing size of the defect. The plasma alpha-ANP concentration was significantly correlated with the Qp/Qs ratio, pulmonary artery pressure, and left atrial pressure, estimated from mean pulmonary artery wedge pressure, in the children with ventricular septal defect. In the children with tetralogy of Fallot, the mean plasma alpha-ANP concentration was normal, and mean right and left atrial pressures were not increased. The elevated alpha-ANP concentration in the three patients with heart failure decreased after their conditions improved with various treatments. Thus the measurement of alpha-ANP concentration may be valuable in evaluating the presence or absence of heart failure and the response to treatment in children with congenital heart diseases. Distention of the right and left atrial might induce the release of alpha-ANP in patients with atrial and ventricular septal defects, respectively.\r"

Previous studies of humoral immunity in bacterial cell wall induced arthritis were carried out in outbred animals and measured the humoral response to only the eliciting bacteria. We compared the humoral immune responses of arthritis susceptible Lewis and arthritis resistant Fisher rats after the injection of arthritogenic group B Lactobacillus casei cell wall fragments. Both strains developed significant IgG and IgM responses to the Lactobacillus casei cell wall fragments. Neither strain developed a significant immune response to types I, II, IX or 1a2a3a collagens. These data suggest that humoral immune responses to the Lactobacillus casei cell wall fragments and types I, II, IX, or 1a2a3a collagens do not play a significant role in determining the differing arthritis susceptibilities of Lewis and Fisher rats.\r"

Vascular responses are seen late in parallel with osteophyte formation rather than preceding it. Osteophyte ossification is primarily endochondral.

  ".W": "The metalloproteinase collagenase that is synthesized and secreted by synovial cells is responsible for the large amount of connective tissue destruction seen in rheumatoid arthritis. We have used a model system of cultured rabbit synovial fibroblasts to better understand mechanisms controlling both the induction and suppression of collagenase synthesis. Induction of collagenase requires an increase in collagenase mRNA and concomitantly, suppression of collagenase synthesis by retinoids and glucocorticoids is accompanied by a decrease in collagenase mRNA. Another metalloproteinase, activator, which is responsible for the activation of latent procollagenase and which has gelatinolytic ability, is coordinately regulated with collagenase. We conclude that there may exist a family of metalloproteinases that is important in the modulation of connective tissues and that is coordinately regulated at the level of mRNA.\r"

Recombinant Interleukin-1 (IL-1) which stimulates the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), collagenase, and plasminogen activator also stimulates the synthesis of collagen and increases steady-state levels of mRNA in cultured chondrocytes, synovial cells and foreskin fibroblasts if the synthesis of PGE2, which inhibits collagen synthesis, is inhibited by indomethacin. Recombinant immune interferon (IFN-gamma), which does not affect collagenase of PGE2 production, suppresses type II as well as types I and III collagen synthesis and associated mRNA levels. IL-1 and IFN-gamma could therefore have opposite roles in modulating cartilage matrix turnover in joint disease by affecting repair as well as degradation.\r"

Four standardized rating scales were completed by the patients for the evaluations. Expert evaluations of the same house officers were conducted by a trained evaluator who reviewed videotapes of the interview and a faculty member who reviewed the adequacy of the medical history write-ups. Results of the study indicate a high correlation between the patients' and the experts' evaluations of the adequacy of the medical history data collected; less agreement was found in evaluations of the adequacy of the psychosocial data collected. These findings suggest that, if carefully selected and trained, patients with chronic medical conditions can provide reliable and standardized evaluations of house officers' performance at a level consistent with but less expensive than faculty members' evaluations.\r"

As a model for the initial retention of microcrystals by kidney epithelial membranes, crystal-induced membranolysis of red blood cells served as a measure of crystal-membrane interactions. The inhibitors induced changes in hemolytic potential from approximately 320 per cent enhancement to 80 per cent inhibition. No inhibitor behaved the same way for all crystals studied. However, some crystals showed consistent trends in altered hemolytic potential in the presence of inhibitors. These crystals included weddellite and sodium urate, which were inhibited consistently, and apatite and quartz, which were enhanced consistently. Whewellite, uric acid, brushite and struvite exhibited mixed patterns in the altered hemolytic potentials owing to the inhibitors.\r"

  ".W": "The hormonal characteristics of anorchism are elevated basal levels of gonadotropins, especially follicle-stimulating hormone and a low concentration of plasma testosterone that fails to increase after the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin. However, little is known about the dynamics of plasma gonadotropin secretion in infants and children with anorchism. We analyzed plasma gonadotropin concentrations and their responses to luteinizing hormone releasing factor, along with plasma testosterone responses to human chorionic gonadotropin, in 9 children with surgically proved bilateral anorchism. Basal concentrations of gonadotropins, especially plasma follicle-stimulating hormone, are elevated above normal during the first 3 to 4 years of life, decrease gradually to normal prepubertal levels and then increase again after age 9 years. This age-dependent diphasic pattern of gonadotropin secretion is comparable to that described previously in patients with the syndrome of gonadal dysgenesis and it is consistent with steroid-independent central nervous system inhibition of pulsatile luteinizing hormone releasing factor secretion during mid childhood. Moreover, a sex difference in follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone values was observed; the mean follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone concentrations in anorchid boys less than 3 years old were lower than in patients with Turner's syndrome. We suggest that this sex dichotomy is a consequence, at least in part, of the actions of testosterone derived from the fetal testis on the fetal hypothalamus. Luteinizing hormone releasing factor administration to anorchid male subjects resulted in an age-dependent augmented release of gonadotropin, particularly follicle-stimulating hormone. This study emphasizes that the age of the patient must be considered when interpreting basal gonadotropin levels. We also propose that in mid childhood the luteinizing hormone releasing factor test in conjunction with the human chorionic gonadotropin stimulation test is a more accurate hormonal indicator of patients with congenital anorchism than either the human chorionic gonadotropin test or basal gonadotropin concentrations.\r"

Although the prevalence of contamination of intravenous fluid was higher in administration sets replaced at 72-hour intervals (10/664, 1.5%) than in sets replaced every 48 hours (6/710, 0.8%), the difference is not statistically significant. Contamination in both groups was almost exclusively with small numbers of coagulase-negative staphylococci (range, 1 to 27 colony-forming units/mL); no contaminated infusion was associated with clinical signs of sepsis or concordant bacteremia. Contaminants were recovered less frequently from peripheral venous infusions (0.6%) than from infusions used for central venous access or hemodynamic monitoring (1.5%) or total parenteral nutrition (3.6%); infusions in an intensive care unit were more frequently contaminated (2.5%) than infusions on medical and surgical wards (0.9%). These data indicate that extrinsic contamination of intravenous fluid is a rare cause of endemic nosocomial septicemia, and for most infusions it is unnecessary to routinely replace delivery systems more frequently than every 72 hours.\r"

The markers included immunoreactivity in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) quantified in white blood cells with the use of a polyclonal anti-benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide-I-DNA antibody, 4-aminobiphenyl hemoglobin (4-ABP-Hb) adducts measured by negative chemical ionization mass spectrometry, sister chromatid exchange (SCE) in cultured lymphocytes, and cotinine in plasma measured by radioimmunoassay. Several blood samples were drawn from each subject. In blood samples 1 and 3 having detectable levels of DNA adducts, mean femtomole-per-microgram levels were consistently higher among smokers compared to nonsmokers. The borderline significance of this difference may be attributable to the small numbers of subjects. Consistently higher adduct levels were seen in females compared to males. In sample 3, adduct levels were significantly correlated with measurements of active smoking in smokers and with passive smoking in nonsmokers. By contrast to the ELISA data, which may reflect cumulative exposure from multiple background sources, the 4-ABP-Hb assay was able to distinguish clearly between smokers and nonsmokers. SCEs were significantly elevated in the smokers compared to nonsmokers. Also observed were significant correlations between 4-ABP-Hb and both cotinine and SCEs, as well as a positive correlation between the 4-ABP-Hb and DNA adduct levels (sample 3) that was highly significant. The correlation between DNA and 4-ABP-Hb adducts was significant in smokers but not nonsmokers (sample 3). These results support the need for batteries of markers to detect and to quantify the carcinogenic dose to humans resulting from both specific and \"background\" environmental exposures.\r"

  ".W": "A method has been developed by which to amplify expression of phenotypic transformation of C3H/10T1/2 clone 8 mouse embryo cells not otherwise observed in the standard transformation assay. The expression of transformed foci was amplified by subcultivating chemically treated target cells after they had reached confluence and replating them at subconfluent cell densities. Conditions leading to the expression of the highest numbers of transformed foci include a) a cell seeding density for chemical treatment of 1 X 10(4) cells/dish, b) subculture 4 weeks after treatment, and c) replating cells at a density of 2 X 10(5) cells/-dish. Agents capable of inducing transformation in the standard assay (e.g., 4,4'-bis(dimethylamino)benzophenone, benzo[a]pyrene, 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, and others) also yielded transformation in the replating assay. The more marginal transforming activities of chemicals such as ethyl methanesulfonate, 7-(bromomethyl)-12-methylbenz[a]anthracene, and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine were enhanced by the amplification procedure. Compounds that failed to elicit focal transformation in the standard assay (e.g., dibenz[a,h]anthracene, Tris(2,3-dibromopropyl) phosphate, lead acetate, benzidine, propyleneimine, N-hydroxy-2-fluorenylacetamide, and numerous other compounds of various chemical classes) induced significant levels of phenotypic transformation upon amplification. Noncarcinogens (e.g., phenanthrene, anthracene, 2-aminobiphenyl, cycloheximide, and others) failed to cause significant phenotypic transformation even when cells were replated. To further enhance the applicability of this new replating system, an exogenous source of metabolic activation was added: a 9,000 X g supernatant from Aroclor 1254-induced rat hepatic S-9. This activation system was found a) to be only minimally cytotoxic by itself and b) to be able to mediate NADPH-dependent, dose-dependent toxicity, and transformation by activating the procarcinogens dimethylnitrosamine, 2-naphthylamine, 2-aminoanthracene, and aflatoxin B1. With the use of this revised assay, 14 coded and 23 model compounds were tested. Agreement with in vivo results was observed to be over 85%. The marked sensitivity and discriminatory ability of this revised assay procedure suggest its usefulness as a screen for potential carcinogens of diverse chemical structure.\r"

Inhibition of polyamine biosynthesis by alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) on the growth of hamster H2T pancreatic cancer was investigated both in vitro and in vivo. Cell-doubling time (TD) and survival fraction were determined after a single treatment with DFMO (5 mM). We examined the ability of putrescine to reverse the growth-inhibitory effect of DFMO. The TD for cells treated with DFMO in vitro was 49.6 +/- 5.7 versus 25.4 +/- 2.6 hours for control. The addition of putrescine to DFMO-treated H2T cells showed a reversal of the growth-inhibitory effect of DFMO. Cytotoxicity in vitro increased with prolonged treatment; the survival fraction after 24 hours of treatment was 32%; after 48 hours, 19%; after 72 hours, 13%; and after 92 hours, 8%. We performed two separate animal experiments. In experiment I, H2T cells were injected into the cheek pouch of male Syrian golden hamsters; controls did not receive DFMO. Continuous treatment with 3% DFMO in the drinking water was begun 7 days before, on the day of, or 7 days after tumor cell injection. In experiment II, 4 groups were treated identically to those in experiment I. An additional group of 10 hamsters received 3% DFMO and no tumor, and another additional group of 10 hamsters were housed individually with 3% DFMO begun 7 days after tumor cell injection. Tumor size, body weight, water, and food intake were measured. DFMO treatment in vivo significantly inhibited tumor size and inhibited growth of pancreatic cancer by as much as 50% of control. Our results demonstrate a significant antiproliferative effect of DFMO on the growth of pancreatic adenocarcinoma both in vitro and in vivo.\r"

All rats were studied for mammary carcinogenesis for 370 days after the 84th day of age. Three measures of mammary carcinogenesis were studied. These were the incidence of rats with mammary adenocarcinomas, or mammary fibroadenomas, or mammary neoplasia of either type. Each of these measures was studied also for rats with 2 or more or 3 or more mammary neoplasms. Assessment of possible interaction among the three carcinogens with regard to the incidence of neoplasms was done by time-independent or time-dependent methods, both of which gave remarkably consistent results. For rats with 1 or more adenocarcinomas, 1 or more fibroadenomas, or 1 or more adenocarcinomas and/or fibroadenomas, both methods showed no interaction among the carcinogens, which can, therefore, be considered to have produced additive effects. An exception to this finding of additivity was an apparent synergistic interaction between DMBA and PCZ when the measures of rats with 2 or more, or 3 or more mammary neoplasms of either type, or 3 or more fibroadenomas were analyzed; these analyses, however, were based on relatively small numbers of rats with multiple tumors. Since no interactions were found for the usual measure of carcinogenesis, namely, incidence of rats with 1 or more neoplasms, the overall conclusion is that DMBA, PCZ, and x-ray act additively in the induction of mammary neoplasms in the female Sprague-Dawley rat.\r"

  ".W": "Four newly established mammary hyperplastic outgrowth lines were analyzed for their tumorigenic, morphological, and ovarian hormone-dependent growth properties in BALB/cMed mice. The mammary outgrowth lines were designated DIM-1, DIM-2, DIM-3, and DIM-4 to indicate their origin from the mammary cell line COMMA-D. DIM-1, DIM-2, and DIM-3 were classical hyperplastic alveolar outgrowth lines that possessed high tumor-producing capabilities and rapidly evolved by transplant generation (TG) 6 into ovarian hormone-independent populations. DIM-3 was also characterized by extensive formation of dilated (cystic) alveoli. This characteristic did not correlate either positively or negatively with the tumor-producing capabilities of these lines. DIM-4 was a ductal outgrowth line that exhibited a progression in several biological properties. This line progressed morphologically from a ductal outgrowth to a mixed outgrowth of small ducts (ductules) with scattered alveoli and then in subsequent passages to a uniform alveolar outgrowth. Concurrent with these morphological changes, the tumor-producing capabilities of DIM-4 increased from low [40% with the time for 50% of the transplants to produce mammary tumors (TE50) greater than 12 mo] to high (71% with a TE50 of 7.1 mo). The ductal outgrowth line (TG 4) was totally dependent on ovarian hormones for growth; however, later passages (TG 8) of DIM-4 were only partially ovarian hormone dependent for growth and ovarian hormone independent for maintenance of alveolar morphology. In addition, the tumorigenic response to 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (CAS: 57-97-6) was low in the ductal stage (TG 4) and high in the alveolar stage (TG 7). The results demonstrate an enhancement of tumorigenicity with morphological and biological progression in a preneoplastic mammary cell population and support the hypothesis that the cells at high risk for tumorigenesis in the BALB/c mammary gland appear to be the alveolar cell type.\r"

  ".W": "Heart-lung transplantation for treatment of end-stage cardiopulmonary disease continues to be plagued by many problems. Three primary ones are the technical difficulties that can be encountered, particularly in those patients who have undergone previous cardiac operations, the additional restriction on donor availability imposed by the lack of satisfactory preservation techniques, and the need for lung size compatibility. Two of these difficulties and others surfaced postoperatively in a heart-lung transplant recipient who presented a series of unique operative and therapeutic challenges. A 42-year-old woman with chronic pulmonary hypertension and previous atrial septal defect repair underwent a heart-lung transplantation in August 1985. The operative procedure was expectedly complicated by bleeding from extensive mediastinal adhesions from the previous sternotomy and bronchial collateralization. Excessive chest tube drainage postoperatively necessitated reoperation to control bleeding from a right bronchial artery tributary. Phrenic nerve paresis, hepatomegaly, and marked abdominal distention caused persistent atelectasis and eventual right lower lobe collapse. Arteriovenous shunting and low oxygen saturation necessitated right lower lobectomy 15 days after transplantation, believed to be the first use of this procedure in a heart-lung graft recipient. Although oxygenation improved dramatically, continued ventilatory support led to tracheostomy. An intensive, psychologically oriented physical therapy program was initiated to access and retrain intercostal and accessory muscles. The tracheostomy cannula was removed after 43 days and gradual weaning from supplemental oxygen was accomplished. During this protracted recovery period, an episode of rejection was also encountered and successfully managed with steroid therapy. The patient continued to progress satisfactorily and was discharged 83 days after transplantation. She is well and active 20 months after discharge.\r"

The use of Teflon felt as a support appears to redistribute the pressure and thus prevent the sutures from cutting through the vulnerable tissue. In many cases, Teflon felt reinforcement is preferred to direct unsupported closure because of perioperative of immediately postoperative bleeding complications. However, the unavoidable full immobilization of the sutured area, the possible risk of foreign body infection, and the extensive adhesions and calcification in the long term compelled us to search for a better alternative, combining the convenience of both methods and limiting the risks. PDS (polydioxine) resorbable pledgets and strips, provided by Ethicon GmbH, were used as a suture support during the past 2 years for closure of 29 ventricular aneurysmectomies and four ischemic ventricular septal defects, all except one in combination with coronary bypass grafting. The PDS material was easy and efficient to apply and caused no complications during and after the operation. In one case, we had the opportunity to review the supported scar during a second operation for new coronary grafts after 18 months. The formerly feared \"linear scar petrification,\" usual after use of Teflon felt, was absent. The scar was free from difficult adhesions. Our initial experience suggests the further extensive use of this resorbable material as a support for various sutures at risk.\r"

  ".W": "A detailed coagulation and thromboelastographic study was done on the first 50 liver transplantation procedures performed at the Mayo Clinic between March 1985 and June 1986. Most of the patients suffered from primary sclerosing cholangitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, or chronic active hepatitis. Seven patients required a second liver transplantation, and six patients died, none intraoperatively. Most of the patients had distorted hemostatic mechanisms preoperatively, as would be expected because the liver generates most of the clotting factors. The outstanding exception was factor VIII, which was usually in the high-normal range or even more elevated. Substantial deterioration of coagulation factors occurred regularly during reperfusion of the donor liver. In some instances, this trend was corrected within 1 hour, but platelet counts continued to decrease, and some coagulation factors rebounded only partially. Because thromboelastographic tracings are quickly available to the liver transplant team and because they tend to forewarn of impending hemostatic problems, we believe that thromboelastography is a reasonably effective procedure for monitoring coagulation during liver transplantation.\r"

In the hypertensive patients, mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 148 and 101 mm Hg, respectively, and the mean heart rate was 73 beats/min. ANP concentrations were not elevated in the hypertensive group but were actually decreased slightly over those of the control group (27.4 +/- 1.8 pg/ml versus 35.3 +/- 2.4 pg/ml [P less than 0.02]). No relationship was found between ANP levels and diastolic blood pressure, plasma renin activity, urinary sodium excretion, or serum creatinine level. In 8 of the 62 patients with essential hypertension, 6 weeks of treatment with a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, nitrendipine, significantly reduced plasma ANP levels from 28.6 +/- 4.3 pg/ml to 18.7 +/- 1.8 pg/ml (P less than 0.05). In 17 additional patients treated with the hypotensive agent ketanserin, ANP levels were not significantly reduced after treatment. Thus, this study demonstrates that circulating plasma ANP levels are not increased but are slightly decreased in patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension in comparison with normotensive subjects. Furthermore, antihypertensive treatment with a calcium channel antagonist reduced plasma levels of ANP.\r"

Continuous oxygen therapy with use of an ambulatory system consistently provides the greatest benefit. New developments that have facilitated home oxygen therapy are conservation methods that allow flow of oxygen only during inspiration or storage of oxygen during expiration and cosmetic improvements for concealing devices used to administer oxygen. Controlled studies are needed to determine the optimal duration and method of administration of oxygen and the selection of appropriate candidates for long-term home oxygen therapy.\r"

The labelled IL2, which had a high specific activity (100-150 microCi/microgram) and retained its capacity for binding to the IL2 receptor on activated lymphocytes in vitro, was injected intravenously into BB/W diabetes-prone and normal rats. Combined immunoperoxidase staining and autoradiography of organ sections revealed that labelled IL2 bound specifically in vivo to IL2-receptor-positive cells in the spleen of both normal and BB/W rats and to activated lymphocytes infiltrating the pancreas of BB/W rats. The severity of lymphocytic infiltration correlated with the degree of radioactivity in the pancreas of BB/W rats. Time-activity curves, generated over organs of injected rats after gamma camera imaging, confirmed that radioactivity was greater in the pancreas of diabetes-prone than in normal rats. 123I is a suitable isotope for gamma camera imaging, so the intravenous injection of IL2 labelled with iodine-123 may be valuable for the in-vivo visualisation of activated lymphocytes in tissues infiltrated by lymphocytes.\r"

To determine whether recent advances in therapy have been beneficial the results of the 1970-71 and 1981-82 national morbidity surveys in general practice and the Department of Health and Social Security surveys of prescribing for 1968 to 1985 have been examined. Between 1970-71 and 1981-82 the number of asthmatics diagnosed rose by 75%, but, for the average asthmatic, consultation, home visit, and outpatients referral rates fell significantly by 19%, 44%, and 32%, respectively. Over the same period total prescribing for airflow obstruction rose by 76%. The proportion of treatment aimed at attack prevention increased from 10.6% to 19.4%. Thus for the average asthmatic management has improved because fewer consultations are required. Increased use of inhaled topical steroids and sodium cromoglycate is probably responsible for this improvement. Nevertheless preventive treatment remains under-prescribed and asthma is still underdiagnosed.\r"

Although all the women had a normal baseline FSH, 18 had an exaggerated FSH response of 26 mIU/ml or more (over 2 standard deviations above control values); this was regarded as a diminished ovarian reserve (DOR). In the DOR group mean response FSH was 38.9 mIU/ml (SD 13.8) and in 33 women with adequate ovarian reserve (AOR) it was 11.5 (4.9) mIU/ml (p less than 0.0001). In the DOR group 1 of 18 patients and in the AOR group 14 of 33 (42%) conceived (p less than 0.05). It is suggested that despite apparently normal ovulatory cycles, the DOR group has a compromised follicular apparatus. Disparity between normal oestradiol secretory capacity of the granulosa and diminished capacity to secrete inhibin could explain the inappropriately high FSH levels in response to the CC challenge.\r"

Animals were anesthetized and 50% of each tumor was removed when the tumors were 2 cm in diameter. Animals were then randomized to receive 5 mg/kg (group A), 10 mg/kg (group B), or 0 mg/kg (group C) HPD2 intravenously 48 hours after biopsy. The remaining tumor was excised 48 hours post HPD2 injection. All samples were weighed, placed on ice, and frozen to -70 degrees C. ER assay was performed by batch run.

As part of the NF spectrum, many different anatomic abnormalities can develop that cause neurologic problems. The central nervous system may be directly involved or may be affected by tumor impingement. Optic pathway gliomas may also occur. The multiple neurofibromas characteristic of the most common form of NF, Von Recklinghausen disease, have a propensity to grow anywhere along nerve pathways. Therefore, the peripheral nervous system can be extensively involved. The neurofibromas may range in size from small, circumscribed tumors to gigantic plexiform tumors that insinuate into adjacent normal tissues and may compromise their function. Other neurologic problems of a functional nature can occur as well: learning disabilities, seizures, incoordination, and sensory abnormalities, among others. Computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are valuable diagnostic studies for identification and follow-up of tumors and other neurologic problems that may be investigated with these techniques. Plain radiographs are useful for investigating skeletal abnormalities in the skull, the ribs, the spine, and the limbs. Neurologic studies, including electroencephalography (EEG), brain-stem evoked response (BSER) or auditory brain stem response (ABR), visual evoked response (VER), nerve conduction velocity (NCV), and electromyography (EMG) provide additional information regarding specific symptom-indicated problems.\r"

We examine the Medicare payment system, which rests on case-mix adjustment, and identify areas, including outlier payments, in which payment accuracy might be improved without better measurement of the severity of illness. There is no available measure of severity of illness that would produce a large improvement in the accuracy of Medicare payments if used to supplement or replace the system of diagnosis-related groups. Evidence regarding whether better measurement of severity would substantially change the distribution of payments across hospitals is mixed. Considerable evidence suggests that the intensity of medically appropriate treatment for patients in the same diagnosis-related group varies substantially for reasons other than the severity of illness. Despite great demand for measures of the quality of care, important technical problems must be solved before we can be confident that differences in case-mix-adjusted outcomes reflect differences in the quality of care.\r"

The samples from the older patients not colonized with mucoid P. aeruginosa contained antibody specific to the mucoid-exopolysaccharide antigen, which could mediate bacterial killing in conjunction with complement and white cells (titers of 4 to 80). These opsonophagocytic killing antibodies were not detected in samples from the 20 normal controls (P less than 0.0001 vs. noncolonized older patients) or 9 of 10 younger (less than or equal to 11 years) noncolonized patients (P = 0.0072 vs. noncolonized older patients). Although the patients with chronic colonization had higher titers of serum opsonophagocytic killing antibody than did the older noncolonized patients (P = 0.0005), these antibodies were not specific to the mucoid-exopolysaccharide antigen. We conclude that there is an association between mucoid-exopolysaccharide-specific opsonophagocytic killing antibody and a lack of detectable P. aeruginosa colonization in a subset of older, relatively healthy patients with cystic fibrosis.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate possible mechanisms underlying the development of nitrate tolerance, we treated 35 patients who had severe chronic heart failure with a prolonged (48-hour) intravenous infusion of nitroglycerin (6.4 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per minute) given either continuously or intermittently (12-hour infusions separated by intervals of 12 hours). Intravenous nitroglycerin produced immediate hemodynamic benefits in all patients, but the magnitude of this improvement was greatly diminished after 48 hours of continuous therapy with the drug. This attenuation was accompanied by cross-tolerance to oral isosorbide dinitrate and by an increase in heart rate, plasma renin activity, and body weight. In contrast, intermittent therapy with intravenous nitroglycerin was not associated with a loss of hemodynamic efficacy or cross-tolerance to oral nitrates and was not accompanied by changes in neurohormonal activity or body weight. In eight patients in whom nitrate tolerance developed during continuous intravenous therapy, the administration of the sulfhydryl-containing compound N-acetylcysteine (200 mg per kilogram orally) restored the hemodynamic state toward that observed at the start of the infusion of nitroglycerin (partial reversal of tolerance). In contrast, N-acetylcysteine had little hemodynamic effect in patients who were not receiving nitroglycerin. These data support the hypothesis that neurohormonal activation and depletion of sulfhydryl groups may interact to cause the loss of hemodynamic efficacy that occurs during prolonged treatment with intravenous nitroglycerin in patients with heart failure. Evaluation of the suggested role of sulfhydryl depletion in the development of tolerance will, however, require direct studies of vascular tissue.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism by which tolerance to the clinical effects of organic nitrates develops has not been elucidated. This study was done to determine whether an intravenous infusion of nitroglycerin induces tolerance in the coronary vascular bed and whether such tolerance is reversed by the sulfhydryl-group donor N-acetylcysteine. We studied 19 subjects--17 with coronary artery disease and 2 without it--who had a mean age (+/- SD) of 54 +/- 9 years. Coronary sinus blood flow, which approximates blood flow to the left ventricle, was measured before and during intracoronary injections of nitroglycerin (10, 25, 50, and 100 micrograms). The patients then received a 24-hour intravenous infusion of saline (n = 7) or of nitroglycerin, 45 +/- 13 micrograms per minute (n = 12), after which the responses of coronary sinus flow to the same doses of intracoronary nitroglycerin used earlier were measured. In the seven patients given saline, the four doses of intracoronary nitroglycerin caused similar percentage increases in coronary sinus flow before and after the saline infusion. In the 12 patients given intravenous nitroglycerin, the four intracoronary doses caused percentage increases in coronary flow before the infusion of 30 +/- 9, 35 +/- 14, 41 +/- 12, and 52 +/- 15, respectively. After the infusion, the same doses of nitroglycerin caused smaller (P less than 0.05) percentage increases (16 +/- 6, 21 +/- 11, 23 +/- 12, and 27 +/- 11, respectively), indicating the development of partial tolerance. Subsequently, 7 of the 12 patients received N-acetylcysteine, after which intracoronary nitroglycerin caused percentage increases in coronary sinus flow similar to the values measured before the intravenous nitroglycerin was given (34 +/- 13, 32 +/- 8, 38 +/- 11, and 44 +/- 16, respectively). We conclude that the coronary vasodilator effect of nitroglycerin is attenuated by an intravenous infusion of nitroglycerin (that is, partial tolerance develops) and that tolerance to the agent can be reversed by administration of the sulfhydryl-group donor N-acetylcysteine. The mechanism by which N-acetylcysteine reverses tolerance will require further investigation.\r"

Previous examination of the antibodies produced by B-cell hybridomas derived from transgenic M54 mice showed that the presence of the mu transgene grossly altered the immunoglobulin repertoire of unimmunized animals, suggesting that these mice suffer from a serious immunoregulatory perturbation. Studies presented here introduce a new perspective on this functional defect. We show that the lymphoid tissues from these transgenic mice lack virtually all conventional bone-marrow-derived B cells, which constitute the predominant B-cell population in normal mice and which typically produce primary and secondary antibody responses to T-cell-dependent antigens. Moreover, the bone marrow from transgenic M54 mice is depleted of pre-B lymphocytes, indicating a serious defect in early B-cell lymphopoiesis. In contrast, CD5 (Ly-1) B cells, a second B-cell population displaying a characteristic set of cell surface markers which are derived from distinct precursors in the peritoneum, are represented at normal frequencies in these transgenic mice. Thus, the presence of the rearranged immunoglobulin heavy-chain transgene in M54 mice results in an unexpected selective developmental defect that impairs the development of bone-marrow-derived pre-B and B cells without affecting Ly-1 B cells.\r"

Whereas the rhodopsin gene consists of five exons interrupted by four introns, surprisingly the human and hamster beta-adrenergic receptor genes contain no introns in either their coding or untranslated sequences. We have cloned and sequenced a DNA fragment in the human genome which cross-hybridizes with a full-length beta 2-adrenergic receptor probe at reduced stringency. Like the beta 2-adrenergic receptor this gene appears to be intronless, containing an uninterrupted long open reading frame which encodes a putative protein with all the expected structural features of a G-protein-coupled receptor.\r"

Atriopeptin is also present in the brain of the rat. Atriopeptin immunoreactive cell bodies and fibres are found in many areas known to be involved in the central regulation of the cardiovascular system, suggesting that it may be a neuromediator in the central control of fluid and electrolyte balance. The paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, which contains the cell bodies of neurons that secrete vasopressin from the posterior pituitary gland, receives a dense innervation from atriopeptin-like immunoreactive fibres. We have studied the effect of atriopeptin on the electrical activity of single neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of anaesthetized rats and found that atriopeptin is a potent inhibitor of putative vasopressin neurons. Atriopeptin, which has systemic actions that oppose those of vasopressin, may act as a neuromodulator in the brain to prevent vasopressin secretion.\r"

In the thymus, approximately 50% of adult thymocytes that carry neither the CD4 nor the CD8 antigen and day 14-15 fetal CD4-8- thymocytes express receptors for IL-2(IL-2R). The CD4-8- (double-negative) subpopulation of thymocytes contains the precursors of cells that can differentiate along an unknown pathway into thymocytes bearing either CD8 or CD4, with the characteristics of mature T lymphocytes. The basis for IL-2R expression by double-negative thymocytes is unclear as they appear to lack a functional T-cell receptor/CD3 complex through which activation of peripheral T cells is mediated. The argument for a role for IL-2 in thymocyte differentiation has also been complicated by conflicting reports on the inability or capability of double-negative thymocytes to respond to IL-2 in vitro. At present, both the nature of the stimuli within the thymic micro-environment which induce IL-2R expression and its relevance to thymocyte differentiation are not known. We show here that the IL-2R-bearing subset has a greater potential to differentiate into phenotypically mature T lymphocytes than do IL-2R-negative thymocytes. In addition, progeny of IL-2R-negative donor cells transiently express IL-2R in the thymuses of adoptive hosts before generating CD8 and/or CD4-positive thymocytes. These results identify the IL-2R-positive cells as a more differentiated double-negative thymocyte subset on the pathway to mature T lymphocytes.\r"

We now present direct evidence that IL-2 receptors have a function in intra-thymic development by demonstrating that proliferation and the generation of cells expressing the T-cell antigen receptor (alpha beta TCR), which is responsible for the recognition of antigens in the context of MHC, are inhibited when antibodies to IL-2 receptors are added to fetal thymus organ cultures. The inhibition is specific in that it does not affect pre-thymic stem cells and can be partially reversed by addition of exogenous recombinant IL-2.\r"

We demonstrate here that pre-B lymphoid lines synthesize a protein of relative molecular mass (Mr) 18,000 (18K), which we term omega, which forms disulphide-linked mu 2 omega 2 tetramers. This protein could be immunoprecipitated with mu-chain from pre-B lines, but not from T-cell and fibroblast lines that express transfected mu-genes, nor from a pre-B line that synthesizes a D mu-protein (which lacks a V domain). We view the omega-chain as being a pre-B specific surrogate light chain that may be essential for the important regulatory function that the mu-protein is believed to have at this stage of differentiation.\r"

Linked DNA markers will be particularly valuable in BANF, facilitating early detection of tumours and thereby permitting more effective surgical intervention. In view of the reported loss of genes on chromosome 22 in meningiomas and acoustic neuromas, the genetic localization of the primary BANF defect strongly supports the concept that the disease locus encodes a 'tumour suppressor' gene. Isolation of this gene should provide insights into the pathogenesis of acoustic neuromas and other nervous system tumours, as well as into the control of proliferation and differentiation of neural crest cells.\r"

At least some of these cells bear the CD3-associated gamma delta T-cell receptor (TCR gamma delta). Here we describe a second subset of double negative thymocytes which expresses CD3-associated alpha beta receptors (TCR alpha beta). Surprisingly, these cells express predominantly the products of a single V beta gene family (V beta 8). These CD4-CD8-, TCR alpha beta+ cells appear relatively late in ontogeny (between birth and day 5 of life) and thus are unlikely to be the precursors to the TCR alpha beta-bearing cells (CD4+CD8- and CD4-CD8+) already present at birth. They can be selectively expanded in vitro by stimulation with a monoclonal antibody to V beta 8 (F23.1) in the presence of interleukin I (IL-1). We propose that this cell type is a unique T-cell population distinguishable from typical TCR alpha beta+ T cells by its CD4-CD8- phenotype and a restricted TCR V beta repertoire. Analysis of the unique phenotype of these cells suggests that they may represent the normal counterpart of the defective CD4-CD8- T cells found in the lpr autoimmune mouse.\r"

  ".W": "Pseudopodia protrusion is a prominent feature of actively motile cells in vitro and invading tumour cells in vivo; however, the function and regulation of pseudopodia are poorly understood. Tumour autocrine motility factor (AMF) represents a new class of cytokines which are secreted by tumour cells and embryonic cells and induce random motility in the producer cells or in heterologous cells with appropriate receptors. Here we report that a major effect of this factor is to induce the extension of cell pseudopodia before cell translocation. Using a new method to quantify and isolate pseudopodia, we find that human breast carcinoma cell AMF (at concentrations of 1 nM or below) stimulates random pseudopodia formation in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Anti-AMF antibodies inhibit pseudopodia protrusion and cell motility, showing the importance of pseudopodia formation during locomotion. AMF-stimulated motility and pseudopodia formation occur on a wide variety of adhesive substrata which suggests that certain intrinsic motility events are independent of the attachment mechanism. Induced pseudopodia show a prominent axial actin network in the electron microscope. The number of laminin receptor and fibronectin RGD recognition sites is increased by a factor of 20 in the induced pseudopodia when compared to the average distribution in unstimulated cells. Exploratory pseudopodia regulated by cell-derived motility factors contain receptors for matrix proteins and could serve as 'senseorgans' essential to the process of cell locomotion.\r"

Staining and RNA analysis of J11d+ cells suggest that some express receptors of the CD3 gamma delta type, but none express CD3 alpha beta receptors. In fetal thymus organ culture, the J11d+ cells diversify to form 'cortical type' CD4+8+ cells and 'medullary type' cells expressing either CD4 or CD8; in vivo they repopulate the thymus of an irradiated host and seed the periphery with T cells. In contrast, the J11d- subset of CD4-8- thymocytes do not all bear Thy-1 and none express the IL-2R, but some express antigen receptors of the CD3 alpha beta type. They have more limited diversification potential in organ culture, and in vivo fail to recolonize the irradiated host in a homing-independent assay. We conclude that they are not precursor T cells, but rather a side-branch from the main line of T cell differentiation.\r"

Many site-specific recombination systems also exhibit a dependence on homology, although in these systems the requirement is limited to a short region (less than 10 base pairs (bp]. We have used the in vitro phage lambda integration reaction to study the role of homology in this model site-specific recombination system. We find that certain non-homologous pairings which are strongly blocked for complete recombination, nevertheless make one pair of strand-exchanges to generate a joint molecule of the Holliday structure type. This result rules out recombination models in which the only homology-dependent step is synapsis (the juxtaposing of the two recombination sites). Our results also reveal a functional asymmetry in the recombination sites. We present models for bacteriophage lambda integrative recombination which accommodate these findings.\r"

In the other five patients with neuropathy, we found no binding of M proteins to nerve components, but in three patients there were endoneurial IgM deposits in nerve biopsy. Peripheral neuropathy may be related to the antigen-specificity of M proteins.\r"

It was found that, for the entire sample, the responses to each of the stimuli could be described by a continuous function of the basal PRL levels. The present work provides evidence for the following conclusions: 1) The PRL responses to thyrotropin-releasing hormone and to domperidone merely bring additional diagnostic information relative to basal PRL levels in the occasional patients with macroprolactinemia; 2) there is a continuous spectrum of lactotroph activities in women, ranging from normal secretors through an intermediate group of hypersecretors (with progressively increased serum PRL levels and decreased responsiveness to stimuli) to full-blown prolactinomas; and 3) idiopathic hyperprolactinemia is a heterogeneous entity that includes the above intermediate group of patients, women with macroprolactinemia, and patients with undiagnosed prolactinomas.\r"

Autoimmune conditions associated with antiphospholipid antibodies sometimes produce vascular abnormalities in the decidua and placenta; successful pregnancies can be achieved in most of these women by treatment with corticosteroids and low-dose aspirin. Abnormal maternal immune responses to paternal or trophoblast alloantigens, with insufficient production of blocking antibodies or suppressor cells, have also been implicated. Immunization of these patients with paternal or third-party leukocytes has resulted in a number of live births. However, the mechanism of action, effectiveness, and safety of all treatment regimens remain controversial. Present recommendations for the evaluation of recurrent-abortion patients include diagnosis and appropriate treatment of traditional nonimmunologic and more recently recognized autoimmune factors. The remaining patients with no detectable cause for repetitive pregnancy loss are candidates for referral to research centers for further immunologic evaluation and experimental immunotherapy.\r"

If it is assumed that 60% of all children could be vaccinated at 24 months of age, universal vaccination has the highest economic benefits of any single preventive strategy considered (net savings $64.8 million). Rifampin prophylaxis of appropriate household contacts has the highest benefit to cost ratio (59:1), but because rifampin prevents only secondary disease, only half as many cases can be prevented with rifampin prophylaxis of appropriate household contacts (501 cases prevented, $1,994 per case prevented) as with universal vaccination at 24 months (985 cases prevented, $63,484 per case prevented). Single-dose vaccination of day-care attendees at 18 months of age is the most expensive preventive strategy considered ($148,445 per case prevented, 306 cases prevented).

The children ranged in weight from 2.0 to 12.6 kg (median weight, 3.83 kg; fifth to 95th percentile, 2.06 to 11.1 kg) and in age from 1 week to 43.6 months (median age, 2.7 months; fifth to 95th percentile, 0.2 to 25.3 months). Mean weight gain was 11.0 +/- 5.0 g/kg/d; mean nitrogen balance was 242 +/- 70 mg/kg/d. Plasma concentrations of all amino acids except tyrosine were within the normal range (ie, within the 95% confidence limits of the two-hour postprandial plasma concentrations observed in 30-day-old, healthy, normally growing, breast-fed, term infants) throughout the period of study. Mean prestudy and poststudy serum total protein, albumin, and transthyretin (prealbumin) concentrations were not significantly different. However, plasma transthyretin concentration increased in all children with low prestudy concentrations. Mean poststudy serum total bilirubin concentration of the total population was not different from the mean prestudy concentration. This was true also for the 31 children who received the parenteral amino acid mixture for more than ten days. In contrast to the expected 30% to 50% incidence of cholestasis, only one of these 31 experienced an unexplained increase in serum total bilirubin concentration during study, suggesting that normalizing plasma amino acid concentrations and/or providing taurine during parenteral nutrition may decrease the incidence of cholestasis associated with this therapy.\r"

A few studies in newborns have indicated that airway resistance is increased through small endotracheal tubes. This increases the work of breathing and the likelihood of subsequent ventilatory failure. In this study, 27 very low birth weight infants who were 1/2 to 28 days old at the time of extubation were randomly divided into two groups. One group of 13 study infants were extubated directly from intermittent mandatory ventilation rates of six to ten per minute, and the other 14 control infants were placed on continuous positive airway pressure through endotracheal tubes for six hours prior to an attempt to extubate. There was no difference between the two groups in gestational age, postnatal age, weight, or severity of lung disease at the time of extubation. All 13 study infants were successfully extubated without significant apnea or respiratory acidosis. Of the 14 control infants, only seven were successfully extubated; six infants had significant apnea and in one infant respiratory acidosis with pH 7.13 and PCO2 65 developed while receiving continuous positive airway pressure (13/13 v 7/14, P less than .005). The seven infants who failed the preextubation trial of continuous positive airway pressure were later extubated from low intermittent mandatory ventilation rates without significant apnea or respiratory acidosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The translocation of arginine and ornithine has been studied using membrane vesicles of galactose/arginine-grown cells of S. lactis fused with cytochrome c oxidase proteoliposomes by the freeze/thaw--sonication procedure earlier described. In the presence of reduced cytochrome c the fused membranes rapidly accumulate ornithine. Addition of arginine releases accumulated ornithine. Rapid uncoupler-insensitive exchange between external arginine and internal ornithine is seen at rates that are at least 60-fold higher than the rate of protonmotive force-driven arginine translocation. This arginine:ornithine exchange activity was reconstituted in proteoliposomes after solubilization of S. lactis membranes with octyl beta-D-glucopyranoside. These proteoliposomes catalyze a one-to-one exchange between arginine and ornithine. The arginine:ornithine exchange system is the first exchange system for cationic metabolites found in bacteria. Translocation of arginine via this system does not require metabolic energy obtained by arginine metabolism.\r"

(i) What behavioral components are characteristic or predictive of successful courtship? and (ii) How important is the information transmitted in the different sensory channels for courtship success in each sex? These questions were approached by two experimental procedures. Flies having a sensory deficiency (olfactory, auditory, or visual) competed with wild-type flies of the same sex for mates. Males were found to rely upon sensory channels different from those used by females in order to court successfully. In addition, the courtships of pairs of various genotypes were recorded and subjected to multivariate analysis. The multivariate courtship profiles deviated most widely from those of successful wild-type pairs when the male or female was unable to receive information in the sensory channel most important for successful mating by that sex. Both sequential and quantitative courtship properties were altered when one participant was deficient in ability to receive certain sensory information.\r"

  ".W": "To characterize the light chain gene segments involved in the murine immune response to keyhole limpet hemocyanin p-azophenylarsonate (Ars), we have determined the amino acid and/or nucleotide sequences of several anti-arsonate antibodies of the Ars-A family in the A/J, C.AL-20, and BALB/c strains. These structures have been compared to certain BALB/c anti-phenyloxazolone and anti-levan antibodies previously sequenced and to the A/J V kappa 10-Ars-A genomic sequence (where V kappa = kappa chain variable). These primary structural studies were complemented by Southern filter hybridization analyses utilizing V kappa and kappa chain joining (J kappa) molecular probes. We found a surprising uniformity of structure among these antibody light chains derived from different murine strains. Thus, in contrast to the heavy chain variable (Vh) regions of the Ars-A antibody family where the BALB/c strain lacks the VH gene segment utilized in the A/J Ars-A response, the light chain variable region gene segments at the V kappa 10-Ars-A locus appear to be identical between the two strains.\r"

In this report, we provide evidence that the X and Y boxes play an important role in controlling transcription of the murine class II gene E kappa alpha. We have developed transgenic mouse lines that carry E alpha genes cleanly deleted for either the X or Y box and have compared the expression of these mutant transgenes with that of a nondeleted control. Both the X and Y segments appear critical for accurate and efficient transcription of E kappa alpha. The most drastic effect is seen with gamma-interferon-treated macrophages, where deletion of the Y box completely abrogates transcription initiated by the normal promoter. In addition, we identify proteins from nuclear extracts that bind specifically to the X or Y box.\r"

First-passage animals were inoculated with two different stool suspensions obtained from human patients with well-defined ET-NANBH that originated from Burma and Pakistan, where epidemics of ET-NANBH occur. Both inocula contained 27- ato 34-nm-diameter viruslike particles (VLPs) that were specifically aggregated by acute-phase ET-NANBH sera. ET-NANBH was subpassaged in both tamarins and cynomolgus macaques by using pools of stool suspensions from first-passage animals. One additional passage of disease in cynomolgus macaques resulted in a significantly shortened incubation period and increased severity of disease. VLPs similar to those found in the human inocula were observed in stool specimens of first-, second-, and third-passage cynomolgus macaques and in first- and second-passage tamarins. Our findings indicate that cynomolgus macaques are particularly suitable experimental models for studies of human ET-NANBH. The 27- to 34-nm VLPs found in infected human and primate stools appear to be etiologically linked to disease.\r"

  ".W": "We propose a general strategy for dynamic control of information flow between arrays of neurons at different levels of the visual pathway, starting in the lateral geniculate nucleus and the geniculorecipient layers of cortical area V1. This strategy can be used for resolving computational problems arising in the domains of stereopsis, directed visual attention, and the perception of moving images. In each of these situations, some means of dynamically controlling how retinal outputs map onto higher-level targets is desirable--in order to achieve binocular fusion, to allow shifts of the focus of attention, and to prevent blurring of moving images. The proposed solution involves what we term \"shifter circuits,\" which allow for dynamic shifts in the relative alignment of input and output arrays without loss of local spatial relationships. The shifts are produced in increments along a succession of relay stages that are linked by diverging excitatory inputs. The direction of shift is controlled at each stage by inhibitory neurons that selectively suppress appropriate sets of ascending inputs. The shifter hypothesis is consistent with available anatomical and physiological evidence on the organization of the primate visual pathway, and it offers a sensible explanation for a variety of otherwise puzzling facts, such as the plethora of cells in the geniculorecipient layers of V1.\r"

  ".W": "The uptake and expression by plastids isolated from dark-grown cucumber cotyledons (etioplasts) of two pUC derivatives, pCS75 and pUC9-CM, respectively carrying genes for the large small subunits of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase of Anacystis nidulans or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, is reported. Untreated etioplasts take up only 3% as much DNA as that taken up by EDTA-washed etioplasts after 2 hr of incubation with nick-translated [32P]-pCS75. The presence or absence of light does not affect DNA uptake, binding, or breakdown by etioplasts. Calcium or magnesium ions inhibit DNA uptake by 86% but enhance binding (23-200%) and breakdown (163-235%) of donor DNA by EDTA-treated etioplasts. Uncouplers that abolish membrane potential (delta psi), transmembrane proton gradient (delta pH), or both do not affect DNA uptake, binding, or breakdown by etioplast. However, both DNA uptake and binding are severely inhibited by ATP. Presumably this results from the hydrolysis of ATP, because the poorly hydrolyzable analog adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate does not inhibit the uptake or binding of DNA by etioplasts. beta-Lactamase specified by the ampicillin resistance gene of pCS75 can be detected only in EDTA-treated etioplasts that have been incubated with the plasmid pCS75. After the incubation of EDTA-treated etioplasts with pCS75, immunoprecipitation using antiserum to the small subunit of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase from A. nidulans reveals the synthesis of small subunits; these are smaller by 2 kDa than the cucumber small subunit encoded by the nuclear genome. Treatment of etioplasts with 10 mM EDTA shows a 10-min duration to be optimal for the expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase encoded by pUC9-CM. A progressive increase in the expression of this enzyme is observed with an increase in the concentration of pUC9-CM in the DNA uptake medium. The plasmid-dependent incorporation of [35S]methionine by EDTA-treated organelles declines markedly during cotyledon greening in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "In Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts bradykinin stimulated inositol phosphate (InsP) formation and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis. The EC50 values for stimulation of PGE2 synthesis and InsP formation by bradykinin were similar, 200 pM and 275 pM, respectively. Guanosine-5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate stimulated PGE2 synthesis and InsP formation, and guanosine-5'-[beta-thio]diphosphate inhibited both PGE2 synthesis and InsP formation stimulated by bradykinin. Neither bradykinin-stimulated PGE2 synthesis nor InsP formation was sensitive to pertussis toxin. Phorbol ester, dexamethasone, and cycloheximide distinguished between bradykinin-stimulated PGE2 synthesis and InsP formation. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate enhanced bradykinin-stimulated PGE2 synthesis but inhibited bradykinin-stimulated InsP formation. Pretreatment of cells with dexamethasone for 24 hr inhibited bradykinin-stimulated PGE2 synthesis but was without effect on bradykinin-stimulated InsP formation. Cycloheximide inhibited bradykinin-stimulated PGE2 synthesis but was without effect on bradykinin-stimulated InsP formation. When bradykinin was added to cells prelabeled with [3H]choline, the phospholipase A2 products lysophosphatidylcholine and glycerophosphocholine were generated. In cells pretreated with dexamethasone, lysophosphatidylcholine and glycerophosphocholine formation induced by bradykinin were inhibited. Treatment of cells with phorbol ester enhanced bradykinin-induced formation of these metabolites. The data suggest that bradykinin receptors are coupled by GTP-binding proteins to both phospholipase C and phospholipase A2 and that phospholipase A2 is the enzyme that catalyzes release of arachidonate for prostaglandin synthesis.\r"

We have shown that the product of this gene functions as a suppressor in an in vitro assay, and we have proposed that it may donate a modified amino acid directly to protein in response to specific UGA codons. In this report, we show through in vitro and in vivo studies that the human and Xenopus opal suppressor phosphoserine tRNAs are synthesized by a pathway that is, to the best of our knowledge, unlike that of any known eukaryotic tRNA. The primary transcript of this gene does not contain a 5'-leader sequence; and, therefore, transcription of this suppressor is initiated at the first nucleotide within the coding sequence. The 5'-terminal triphosphate, present on the primary transcript, remains intact through 3'-terminal maturation and through subsequent transport of the tRNA to the cytoplasm. The unique biosynthetic pathway of this opal suppressor may underlie its distinctive role in eukaryotic cells.\r"

This differentiation, quantified by the appearance of surface antigens characteristic of mature plasma cells, is impaired by addition to the culture medium of the ADP-ribosyltransferase (ADPRT; EC 2.4.2.30) inhibitors 3-methoxybenzamide or 3-aminobenzamide. These agents also protect the cells against the inhibition of proliferation induced by low doses of interferon alpha. In contrast, the large inhibition of thymidine incorporation into DNA caused by interferon treatment is not affected by the ADPRT inhibitors. The phorbol ester phorbol 12-tetradecanoate 13-acetate induces the same plasma cell surface antigens that are induced by interferon treatment, and this effect is also impaired by the ADPRT inhibitors. These results suggest that interferons and phorbol esters share a mechanism of action that requires ADPRT activity. Protection of the cells against the antiproliferative effect of interferons by the ADPRT inhibitors suggests that growth inhibition may be a consequence of cell differentiation. In contrast, the inhibition of thymidine incorporation alone is not sufficient for the cessation of cell proliferation and is not a true reflection of the rate of DNA synthesis.\r"

Three D. nebulosa P elements appear to have integrated into the same position of a complex, centromeric repeated sequence.

There are striking sequence and conformation similarities between the Glued alpha-helical domains and those found in certain filamentous proteins from various organisms, particularly in muscle fibers and intermediate filaments. The possible role of the Glued polypeptide as an architectural filamentous component of Drosophila cells and tissues is discussed. Two of the five Glued exons are located in the 5' untranslated region of the cDNA. One of the introns interrupting the Glued open reading frame encodes at least two polyadenylylated transcripts, suggesting that other genes might map within the span of the Glued gene.\r"

Our results show that the expression of the lambda cIII gene is subject to specific requirements. Tests of a set of cIII-lacZ gene and operon fusions reveal that a sequence upstream of the cIII ribosome binding site is needed for cIII translation. The sequence contains an inefficient RNase III processing site. Furthermore, expression of cIII is drastically reduced in cells lacking RNase III. We have isolated a phage carrying a mutation (r1), which lies in the upstream sequence, that leads to a reduction in cIII translation and inactivates the RNase III processing site. The r1 mutant is nevertheless still dependent on RNase III for cIII translation; r1 reduces cIII translation by a factor of 3 in wild-type cells and by a factor of approximately equal to 30 in an RNase III mutant host. We propose that RNase III stimulates cIII translation by binding to the upstream sequence and thereby exposing the cIII ribosome binding site. This stimulation does not involve RNA cleavage. Consistent with this hypothesis is our finding that, in vitro, unprocessed cIII mRNA is translated, whereas RNase III-cleaved cIII mRNA is not.\r"

Whereas the electrophoretic mobility and the N-glycosylation of the spleen and lymph-node gamma chains are indistinguishable from those of the reported thymocyte gamma chain, a minor fraction of the T blasts generated by allogeneic stimulation of B10 lymph-node T cells with B10.BR spleen cells seems to express gamma chains with distinct properties.

To provide insulin-producing cells, pancreatic tissue from newborn mice was grafted under the renal capsules in combination with ABMT. The aims of concomitant ABMT are as follows. (i) It induces immunological tolerance to the donor-type major histocompatibility complex determinants and permits the host to accept subsequent pancreatic allografts from the bone marrow donor. (ii) ABMT replaces abnormal stem cells with normal stem cells. After transplantation of bone marrow plus newborn pancreas, NOD mice showed reduction of the glycosuria and a normal response in the glucose-tolerance test. Immunohistological study revealed the presence of clustered insulin-containing beta cells in the grafted pancreatic transplants. ABMT may become a viable treatment of established type 1 diabetes mellitus in humans.\r"

Dopaminergic terminals projecting from the substantia nigra to the corpus striatum were destroyed by unilateral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine into the substantia nigra. Quantitative receptor assays using highly specific radioligands were used to measure the density of striatal mu, delta, and kappa receptors before and after denervation. Denervation caused a 34 +/- 2% loss of striatal mu receptors and a 32 +/- 1% loss of striatal delta receptors on the lesioned side of the brain; in contrast, kappa receptors did not change significantly in density. Quantitative in vitro autoradiography was used to visualize the neuroanatomical pattern of receptors on lesioned and nonlesioned sides of the brain under the light microscope. Loss of mu receptors in striatal patches was striking in the ventrolateral areas of the striatum, whereas the most notable loss of delta receptors was found in the central striatum. Other brain areas did not differ significantly in mu receptor density between the lesioned and nonlesioned sides, as determined by autoradiography. These findings suggest that a high percentage of mu and delta receptors in the striatum are located on the nigrostriatal dopaminergic terminals and support the concept of a modulatory role for mu and delta opioid peptides in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway.\r"

If profit and loss were the only considerations, one would opt for screening with combined examination for all women age 40 and older. If medical and philosophical considerations were to be included in the equation, clinical examination alone at any age cannot be justified. However, one might be able to justify mammography screening. Bierman has stated, \"ultimately, when the scent is of flesh rather than figures, even the economist concedes that it will be important to insulate the individual practitioner (from cost-benefit/cost-effectiveness analysis) on a day-to-day basis because of potential conflict with the commitment to do what is best for each patient. Here is the crux. The economist's reference to the 'nation's health' is at best ambiguous and more likely meaningless. The physician's commitment to the patient's health is neither of these: it is clear, undeniable, and profoundly meaningful.\" Reduction in cancer deaths is not easy to come by.

  ".W": "Template-guided implantation of rigid steel or plastic guide needles for afterloading of radioactive sources is widely used in the treatment of gynecologic, rectal, and urologic malignant neoplasms. Iridium-192 is used almost universally, despite the high cost per implant, due to its short half-life and limited need for a flexible, trimmable source. A reusable afterloading system containing cesium-137 was developed. Each source has an effective active length of 6.8 cm and is encapsulated at the distal end of a 21-cm-long stainless steel tube. The sources can be afterloaded into the same plastic guide needles normally used for Ir-192 ribbons. Physical and dosimetric aspects of these sources are compared with those of Ir-192, and radiation protection and cost effectiveness are also discussed.\r"

  ".W": "In the absence of data on current or likely patterns of use of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, use of computed tomography (CT) at one institution in 1981 and 1984 was analyzed to provide data relevant to current federal deliberations regarding Medicare payment for inpatient MR imaging. Between 1981 and 1984 inpatient CT utilization increased 59%, primarily due to a 265% increase in body CT. In 1984 inpatients who underwent at least one CT procedure were as likely to undergo more than one procedure as to undergo only one. CT procedures were performed in a high proportion of diagnosis-related groups (DRGs), with more than one-half of head CT procedures performed in non-neurologic DRGs. Given the similarities between clinical applications of CT and MR imaging, these findings regarding CT utilization have the following implications: (a) a delay in recalibration of DRG payment rates may not take account of expected growth in utilization of MR imaging, (b) a DRG \"add-on\" for MR imaging should reflect the likelihood that more than one MR imaging procedure will be performed in many hospitalizations, and (c) adjustments in DRG payments for MR imaging should not be limited to the 35 neurologic DRGs.\r"
