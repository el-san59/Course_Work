The diagnosis--based on immunohistologic criteria--was initially difficult to establish, but cytogenetic and DNA studies of the dermal infiltrate supported the clinical suspicion of malignancy. In addition, the T cell receptor beta chain gene showed a clonal rearrangement pattern both in skin and in lymph node, suggesting malignancy. Whether the malignant evolution in our patient took place primarily in the skin or in the lymph nodes is difficult to decide. Further examination of the association between atopic dermatitis and cutaneous T cell lymphoma may lead to insights into both disorders.\r"

In an attempt to understand this interaction, we have studied allergen-specific T cells in vitro. These T cells are derived from rodent-allergic individuals and are specific for a major allergen found in mouse urine (MA-1). Antigen-specific, major histocompatibility complex-restricted, human T cell clones have been generated by limiting dilution from lines derived from the peripheral blood T cells of allergic individuals. Antigen (Ag)-presenting cells are necessary for this response, and they can be modulated by appropriate agents. These clones can be propagated in vitro under conditions of restimulation with Ag in the presence of Ag-presenting cells without the continuous use of exogenous interleukin-2. Most clones are CD3+ or CD4+, but one clone is CD3+ CD8+ by fluorescence-activated cell sorter and monoclonal antibody-killing data. Ag stimulation of these clones induces them to produce interleukin-2 and proliferate. These T cell clones can provide a basis for studying the structure of allergenic epitopes and the potential role of altered Ag in the induction of T cell tolerance. If the determinants of T cell allergen recognition and tolerance are solved, it might provide a basis for a new approach to the immunotherapy of allergic disease.\r"

IL-4 enhanced PMN-mediated killing of opsonized bacteria (by up to 91.6% at 3 units of IL-4; p less than 0.05). IL-4 was a weak secondary granule secretagogue and did not by itself generate a respiratory burst. However, IL-4 did increase in a dose-dependent fashion the respiratory burst mediated by the peptide formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (10(-7) mol/L). Maximal potentiation of PMN activity occurred at 100 units of IL-4 (6.3 nmol superoxide produced without IL-4 to 9.8 nmol at 100 units; p less than 0.01). Enhancement of the respiratory burst was not a generalized phenomenon, since IL-4 did not potentiate the respiratory burst mediated by either phorbol myristate acetate, calcium ionophore A23187, or zymosan-treated serum. Similarly, IL-4 potentiated the formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine-stimulated secretion of both lysozyme (40.2%) and beta-glucuronidase (108.2%). Finally, IL-4 was demonstrated to enhance the ability of PMN to phagocytose sheep erythrocytes opsonized with rabbit IgG (by up to 94.2% at 30 units of IL-4). This increased phagocytosis correlated with the recruitment of a population of PMNs that did not phagocytose targets in the absence of IL-4. In conclusion, IL-4 enhanced neutrophil-mediated bactericidal activity. This increase may have occurred secondary to the stimulation of phagocytosis by IL-4 or by potentiation of degranulation and the respiratory burst.\r"

The ethnic stratum most different from mainstream Australian, non-British migrants with poor English proficiency, was a significant predictor of psychological distress in the context of other relevant variables. Within the four \"ethnic\" strata, network variables were significantly related to psychological distress only for non-British migrants, with relatives being important for those with poor English and nonrelatives for those with good English. For mainstream Australians, female gender, poor health, and specific living arrangements were significant predictors of psychological distress.\r"

By two-color flow microfluorimetric analysis they could be subdivided into CD4-/CD8+ and CD4-/CD8- subpopulations, both of which contained CD3+ cells. Northern analysis of total cellular RNA revealed full-length transcripts of gamma- and delta-message, predominantly the truncated (1.0 kb) beta- and no detectable alpha-message. Taken together, these results show that by culturing 14-day fetal thymus lobes in IL-2, in the absence of deliberate mitogen stimulation, CD3+, TcR-gamma delta-expressing CD4-/CD8+ and CD4-/CD8- T cells are obtained. Such cells may represent the precursors of similar cells found outside the thymus in adult mice.\r"

After culture with anti-Ig and T cell-conditioned media and then fixation, B cells expressed membrane IL-1 and were able to stimulate growth of the IL-1-dependent T cell clone D10. Expression of membrane IL-1 required stimulation of B cells for 2 days before fixation. Significant IL-1 activity was detectable in freeze-thaw lysates of identical B cell preparations by 12 h. B cells also released IL-1 into the culture media. In situ hybridization studies by using probes to murine IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta genes supported these observations. Thus, messenger RNA for IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta rose in parallel, were detected between 6 and 24 h of culture, and declined to low levels by 30 h. Despite the presence of mRNA for IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta, only IL-1 alpha had functional activity as determined by the use of a mAb to IL-1 alpha. IL-2 was found to be an essential component of the T cell-derived supernatant. Although IL-4 or TNF did not induce significant B cell IL-1 expression, they both caused a modest, but reproducible enhancement when added in combination with IL-2. IFN-gamma, by contrast, partially inhibited IL-1 induction.\r"

The development of the thymus was discontinuous, with two well defined growth periods from 13 days to 18 days of fetal life and from 3 days to 6 days after birth, and more progressive growth from day 8 to 2 wk. Cell proliferation started on fetal day 12, 1 day after the arrival of hemopoietic stem cells in the third branchial pouch. These cells were phagocytic glycoprotein 1-positive but IL-2R and Thy-1 negative. Thus, cell proliferation preceded IL-2R expression. Until day 15, CD4-8- thymocytes expanded without differentiation. Then CD4-8+ and CD4+8+ cells appeared; this induction was proliferation dependent and occurred on cells which had already lost IL-2R, but just after maximum expression of this receptor. During several days, the thymus remained of constant size (around 10(7) cells) and behaved like the steady state thymus. On day 3 after birth, expansion started again and was correlated with an increase in CD4-8- proliferation index and IL-2R expression. At the same time, the thymic subset capable of expansion without differentiation was again, transiently, detectable. These results suggest that the inflow of precursor cells into the thymus is permanent but transiently increased at several times during ontogeny. Moreover, the behavior of fetal CD4-8- cells does not appear radically different from that of adult precursors, but the actual difference resides in the variation of the relative proportion of CD4-8- cells at different maturation stages, as revealed by striking variations of IL-2R expression by cycling cells.\r"

  ".W": "We have studied the effects of the steroid hormones, 17 beta-estradiol and dexamethasone, on the relative proportion of thymocyte expression of CD4 (L3T4), CD8 (Ly-2), TCR and IL-2R, used to identify different stages of thymocyte differentiation. After short-term in vivo steroid treatment, a significant decrease in the number and proportion of the CD4+/CD8+, double positive subpopulation was observed in parallel with a proportional increase in the percentage of the CD4+/CD8- single positive, of the CD4-/CD8-, double negative and, to a lesser extent, of the CD8+/CD4- subsets. Either steroid treatment increased the proportion of cells expressing either the epsilon-chain of the CD3 complex and/or the beta-chain of the TCR (beta-TCR) (TCR+/CD3+) and the 55 kDa protein of the IL-2R (IL-2R+), related to the increase of CD4+ SP thymocytes and of DN cells, respectively. Furthermore, the increased proportion of CD3+ cells could also be partially related to the increase of both the CD4+ and DN subsets. A decrease of the effect on either DN/IL-2R+ cells or CD4+ SP cells was selectively observed after long-term treatments with 17 beta-estradiol or DEX, respectively. It is concluded that after short-term administration, different steroid hormones mediate a similar selective depletion of DP, TCR-/CD3-, IL2R- cells presumably in an intermediate stage of differentiation. However, either steroid effects evolve differently in long-term treatment schedules, resulting in different effects on early (DN/IL2R+) and late (SP/IL2R-) steps of thymocyte differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "In order to explore idiotypic, anti-idiotypic, and anti-anti-idiotypic responses to allergens, BALB/c mice were immunized with affinity-purified human idiotypic antibodies directed against a highly purified shrimp allergen. This resulted in the production of anti-idiotypic antibodies which were quantitated by using rabbit idiotypic antibodies raised against the same purified allergen. The mouse anti-idiotypic antibodies recognized shrimp-specific human idiotypic antibodies of the IgE isotype from 18 of 20 individuals, and IgG antibodies from 14 of 20 shrimp-sensitive patients. Immunization of BALB/c mice with affinity-purified, allergen-specific anti-idiotypic antibodies induced anti-allergen IgE and IgG responses in the absence of the allergen. This paper thus presents evidence that anti-idiotypic antibodies raised against allergen-specific idiotypic antibodies may substitute for the original allergen in the induction of allergen-specific idiotypic antibodies. The demonstration of shared idiotopes on IgG and IgE antibodies in the sera of shrimp-sensitive patients supports the use of allergen-specific anti-idiotypic antibodies as surrogate allergens.\r"

Recent evidence indicates that in primates, one type of these molecules may be subsumed under the CD44 grouping of lymphocyte differentiation Ag. Flow cytometric analysis of circulating macaque lymphocytes for expression of these structures revealed a prominent bimodal distribution, defining two subpopulations with a 5- to 10-fold difference in immunofluorescence staining intensity. Studies of lymphocytes from different anatomic compartments revealed marked differences in the relative numbers of these two phenotypes: splenic and peripheral blood lymphocytes were mostly CD44hi, whereas thoracic duct lymphocytes, which have recently exited lymph nodes and Peyer's patches, were predominantly CD44lo, suggesting that these subsets may have different migratory behavior in vivo. Activated lymphocytes, as defined by light scatter measurements, expression of IL-2-R, and CD45R levels, were all CD44hi. Simultaneous three parameter flow cytometric determination of CD44 and CD45R expression, and cell-cycle analysis with 7-amino actinomycin D further demonstrated that intrinsically cycling cells were contained in the CD44hi, CD45R+ subset. After stimulation of CD44lo lymphocytes in vitro with cross-linked anti-CD3 antibodies and PMA, CD44 expression markedly increased. These data indicate that CD44 up-regulation is an early event in T lymphocyte activation in vivo, and support the hypothesis that patterns of lymphocyte traffic are regulated in concert with cell activation, possibly by differential expression of CD44.\r"

  ".W": "A series of permanent IL-3-dependent cell lines have been established from normal BALB/c or C3H bone marrow using alpha-thioglycerol-supplemented culture medium and PWM-stimulated spleen cell-conditioned medium as a source of IL-3. The cell lines and derivatives cloned in agar resembled \"mucosal type\" mast cells with respect to phenotypic and functional properties. In this report we demonstrate that in vitro growth of these mast cell lines was not only dependent on IL-3 and synergistically enhanced by IL-4, but in addition regulated by alpha-thioglycerol which could be replaced by 2-ME or cysteamine. We show that these thiol-sensitive mast cell lines respond to a mast cell growth enhancing activity (MEA) present in spleen cell-conditioned medium and acting in concert with IL-3. Partially purified MEA was not able to stimulate the growth of IL-3-dependent 32Dcl.23 cells, IL-2-dependent CTLL-2 cells or the mouse T cell line F4/4K.6 (L3T4+) adapted to grow in purified IL-4. Moreover, 11B11 hybridoma-derived anti-IL-4 mAb specifically neutralizing mouse Il-4 were unable to abolish the bioactivity of MEA. PWM, CSF-1, GM-CSF, IL-1, IL-2, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IFN-gamma, TGF-alpha, TNF-alpha, NGF, or EPO did not substitute for MEA in our standard proliferation assay.\r"

Both types of clones also induced macrophage mIL-1 by cell-cell contact (i.e., in the absence of lymphokine release).

Separately, immunizations of polyclonal anti-9-40, developed significant anti-Fl serum levels in the secondary (2 degrees) response (50 to 270 micrograms/ml), which decreased in the 3 degrees response (50 to 180 micrograms/ml) and thereafter, although levels of 9-40 idiotypically related antibodies increased. Polyclonal 2 degrees anti-anti-9-40 exhibited variant anti-Fl active sites, was antigenically more cross-reactive than polyclonal 2 degrees anti-Fl, but did not exhibit affinity maturation for fluorescein relative to 1 degrees anti-anti-9-40. In addition, the 9-40 idiotype constituted a small (less than 1.0%) percent of the 2 degrees and 3 degrees anti-Fl (ab1) immune response. When viewed within the context of an antigenic system that possesses widely diverse idiotypy, continued introduction of polyclonal anti-Id appears eventually to: 1) induce polyclonal ab3 with quantitative expression of idiotypically related antibodies in preference to ab3 of ancestral (9-40) antigenic specificity, 2) relative to ab1, induce a 100-fold increase in the level of ab3 antibodies that have both ancestral idiotype and ancestral antigen reactivity, and 3) induce polyclonal ab3 antibodies with a measurably wider range of antigenic reactivities than those of polyclonal ab1. These quantitative data may reflect the natural state of an immune network in a diverse antigenic response.\r"

Fourteen of these clones recognized a synthetic peptide corresponding to the region 170-185 of HLA-A2 in the context of H-2Kd. Moreover, from their activity on P815 cells expressing HLA-Cw3, two subpatterns could be distinguished: subpattern Cw3+, defined by those clones which lysed P815-Cw3, and subpattern Cw3- defined by those clones which did not lyse P815-Cw3. By testing the activity of clones of each subpattern on a series of modified synthetic peptides, we were able to define two epitopes on the same 170-185 peptide of HLA-A2. One of them was dependent on amino acids at positions 173 and 177, whereas the other was dependent on amino acid 177 alone. By using competition experiments, we were also able to define an agretopic region strongly dependent on the amino acid at position 178. Furthermore, experiments with L cells expressing molecules containing recombined sequences between H-2Kd and H-2Dd demonstrated the determinant role of residues 152, 155, and 156 from H-2Kd in the presentation to murine T cells of the 170-185 peptide of HLA-A2.\r"

IL-3 was active on purified basophils and the release process was slower and required more calcium than anti-IgE. Removal of surface IgE from basophils rendered them unresponsive to IL-3. The response could be restored by passive sensitization of basophils with IgE+, IgE known to bind histamine-releasing factors, and not IgE-, IgE unreactive with histamine-releasing factors. Thus, IL-3 uncovers IgE heterogeneity. IL-3 does not, however, directly interact with IgE+. Rather, passive sensitization with IgE+ or stimulation of basophils with low concentrations of several secretagogues renders the cells sensitive to IL-3. IL-3 may well play a pro-inflammatory role by potentiating the effects of IgE+ or various secretagogues.\r"

The homologous peptides, peptide histidine methionine (PHM), growth hormone releasing factor (GHRF), and secretin were all less effective than VIP in competitively inhibiting binding of 125I-VIP to Nalm 6 and Dakiki plasma membranes. The putative receptor was characterized as a 47-kDa protein using covalent cross-linking techniques and VIP stimulated adenylate cyclase in pre-B cells. Human lymphocytes of B cell lineage thus appear to express functional VIP receptors homologous to the receptor identified in T lymphoblasts, brain, pituitary, and intestine.\r"

  ".U": "89235160\r", 
  ".W": "Interaction of specific ligands with TCR initiates a cascade of biochemical events which leads to expression of high affinity IL-2R and subsequent IL-2 secretion. Activation of phospholipase C (PL-C) is considered to be a key event in the initiation of this cascade. However, in addition to this PL-C-dependent pathway, PL-C-independent pathways have been hypothesized. Identification of the steps constituting these PL-C-independent pathways has been difficult because activation of PL-C and the subsequent cascade of events mask the effects of such pathways. Specific inhibitors for PL-C, or mutants defective in, the PL-C pathway would facilitate delineation of alternative activation pathways. We have identified a murine pork insulin/IAd-specific T cell hybridoma, B8P3.11, in which perturbation of the B8P3.11 TCR by either Ag in association with Ia, anti-CD3 antibodies, or a mitogenic lectin does not induce increases in myo-inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate production or cytosolic free calcium, yet it does lead to IL-2 secretion. Treatment of B8P3.11 with pertussis toxin, at concentrations which ADP-ribosylate GTP-binding proteins, inhibits IL-2 secretion. Thus, signal transduction resulting in IL-2 secretion by B8P3.11 likely involves a G protein. In contrast, TCR/ligand interaction activates the PL-C-dependent pathway in LBRM 331A5, a T cell lymphoma. Furthermore, pertussis toxin treatment, which blocks IL-2 secretion by B8P3.11, does not alter IL-2 secretion by LBRM 331A5. However, similar pertussis toxin substrates are present in both cells. Therefore, B8P3.11 T cells should help to elucidate PL-C-independent activation pathways.\r"

  ".W": "A phenotypic and functional analysis has been made of the cellular response in regional lymphoid tissue of C57BL/6J mice infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Massive recruitment of nondividing cells occurred from 3 days after infection, with total numbers of CD8+ T lymphocytes, B220+ B cells, and Thy-1- B220- null cells being high from day 4 to day 6. In contrast, the peak counts for CD4+ T cells were recorded on day 4 and declined dramatically thereafter. Enhanced expression of IL-2R and Ly-24, both of which can be regarded as T cell activation markers, was found for both the CD4+ and the CD8+ subsets, being most prominent for the CD8+ T cells on day 6. Evidence of T cell proliferation was not recognized until days 5 and 6, coincident with enhanced responsiveness of the lymphocytes to rIL-2 and the development of virus-specific cytotoxic activity. Elimination of the CD4+ T cells by treatment of mice with mAb did not modify either the pathogenesis of lymphocytic choriomeningitis, or the expression of activation markers on the CD8+ T cells which are known to be the key effectors in this disease. Thus, the pattern of responsiveness for the CD8+ population is of recruitment to the lymph node, progressive increase in the expression of activation markers and enhanced sensitivity to rIL-2, with late proliferation and generation of cytotoxic activity. This model provides a system for the rigorous in vivo analysis of parameters influencing lymphocyte differentiation and activation in a virus infection.\r"

To develop a polyvalent, synthetic peptide inoculum that can evoke both neutralizing antibodies and T cell proliferative responses to more than one HIV isolate, synthetic peptides containing type-specific neutralizing determinants of gp120 from HIV isolates HTLV-IIIB (IIIB), HTLV-IIIMN (MN) and HTLV-IIIRF (RF) were coupled to a 16 amino acid T cell epitope (T1) of HIV-IIIB gp120 and used to immunize goats. Goat antisera to each T1-SP10 peptide derived from the SP10 region of gp120 of IIIB, MN, and RF neutralized HIV isolates IIIB, MN and RF in a type-specific manner. Moreover, peripheral blood T cells from immunized goats also proliferated in a type-specific manner to peptides derived from gp120 of IIIB, MN, and RF. When combined in a trivalent inoculum, T1-SP10 peptides from HIV-1 isolates IIIB, MN, and RF evoked a high titered neutralizing antibody response to isolates IIIB, MN, and RF in goats and as well induced immune T cells to undergo blast transformation in the presence of peptides derived from gp120 of all three HIV isolates. The T1 portion of the T1-SP10 construct was shown to induce a B cell antibody response against determinants within the T1 peptide in addition to inducing T cell proliferative responses in immune goat T cells. Moreover, the SP10 portion of the T1-SP10 constructs not only induced B cell antibody production but also induced type-specific T cell proliferative responses localized to the C-terminal variable sequences of the SP10 peptides. Finally, the T1-SP10 peptide construct induced memory T cell proliferative responses to native gp120 env protein. Thus, combinations of homologous SP10 region synthetic peptides containing type-specific neutralizing determinants and T cell epitopes of HIV gp120 may be useful in man to elicit high titered neutralizing B cell responses and, as well, T cell responses to more than one HIV isolate.\r"

  ".U": "89235172\r", 
  ".W": "The human TCR-gamma delta occurs in three biochemically distinct forms (forms 1, 2bc, and 2abc). A 40-kDa TCR gamma-chain is disulfide-linked to the TCR delta-chain in form 1, whereas 40-kDa or 55-kDa TCR-gamma polypeptides are noncovalently associated with the TCR delta-chain in forms 2bc and 2abc, respectively. Sequence analysis of TCR-gamma cDNA clones indicates that form 1 utilizes the C gamma 1 gene segment, whereas forms 2bc and 2abc appear to use allelic C gamma 2 gene segments containing either two copies (b and c) or three copies (a, b, and c) of the CII exon, respectively. We transfected TCR-gamma cDNA encoding form 1 or form 2abc into the MOLT-13 cell line that expresses form 2bc. The transfected TCR gamma-chains associate with the resident MOLT-13 TCR-delta, normally part of form 2bc, to yield CD3-associated TCR-gamma delta heterodimers identical to those seen on the donor cell lines (form 1 or 2abc). These transfection experiments show directly that, 1) when a single TCR-delta subunit is available, the presence or absence of disulfide linkage between TCR gamma- and TCR delta-chains is controlled by the TCR gamma-chain, and 2) the difference in the amount of N-linked carbohydrate attached to the transfected TCR-gamma proteins of form 2bc vs form 2abc is influenced by the presence or absence of CII exon copy \"a\" which appears to alter the secondary and/or tertiary structure of these TCR gamma-chain constant regions, thereby affecting the attachment of N-linked glycans. In contrast to the similar structure and usage of C beta 1 and C beta 2, TCR-gamma delta forms show striking differences in structure and are not equally represented in peripheral blood. Although the role of each form is unknown, it is possible that variable or joining-gene segment selection events or functional differences account for their unequal usage.\r"

The leukemic T cell lines PEER and Lyon-1 express such a TCR-gamma delta/CD3 complex at the cell surface. In addition, PEER and Lyon-1 cells transcribe a productively rearranged TCR-beta gene. Introduction of TCR alpha-chain cDNA of human or murine origin resulted in cell surface expression of a TCR-alpha beta/CD3 complex on PEER and Lyon-1 cells. The expression of the TCR-gamma delta/CD3 complex on PEER cells was not affected by introduction of TCR-alpha cDNA. In contrast, introduction of a TCR-alpha cDNA and expression of the TCR-alpha beta/CD3 complex in Lyon-1 cells resulted in the disappearance of the TCR-gamma delta/CD3 complex. These data were confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence, at the protein level and by gene expression analysis. Triggering of the TCR-alpha beta/CD3 complexes by anti-CD3 mAb or anti-TCR mAb resulted in increased internal Ca2+ levels, indicating that these receptors were functional in signal transduction. These results indicate that, besides TCR gene rearrangements, membrane expression of TCR-alpha beta heterodimers may be important in regulating TCR-gamma delta cell surface expression.\r"

To examine any possible polymorphisms in the CR2 gene product we have analyzed the CR2 transcriptional products for variations via alternative exon usage and for the presence of different CR2 alleles within the human population. This analysis has suggested that an exon encoding a 60 amino acid short consensus repeat can be alternatively spliced. Evidence for two transcriptional products has been found in a variety of transformed human B cells and two human tonsils. Interestingly the ratio of the two forms of mRNA, that which includes the alternative exon and that which does not, is not constant when examining the RNA from these sources. In addition to the variation introduced by the alternatively spliced product, there appears to exist in the human population at least three different alleles for CR2. These alleles have been defined by multiple nucleotide changes which are not silent but which alter the amino acid encoded at that site. However, we have not identified allelic variants of CR2 which would produce a product varying in the number of long homologous repeats, as has been identified for the various alleles of the closely related protein, human complement receptor 1.\r"

Each clone displayed a peculiar cytolytic activity ranging from lysis of most targets (PBL clone 4C4) to preferential reactivity on the two autologous metastases (TIL clone 8B3). Blocking and modulation experiments, revealed that the lysis of autologous-Tu cells by TIL clone 8B3, but not by PBL clone 4C4, could be inhibited by mAb to HLA-class I and to CD3 Ag or by CD3 complex modulation. Clone 8B3 was tested also on a panel of 25 tumor clones from Me665/2, revealing that only 4 neoplastic clones were lysed (2/4, 2/14, 2/17, and 2/51). Cold target competition experiments indicated that the uncloned autologous melanomas and one tumor clone (2/17), but no two other tumor clones (2/10, 2/15), could compete with one another for lysis by 8B3. Determination of melanin content of tumor clones from Me665/2 revealed that the four neoplastic clones recognized by 8B3 possessed much lower melanin levels than all the other 20 clones not lysed by this effector.\r"

The B cell deficit associated with the X-linked immunodeficiency of CBA/N strain mice provided a genetic model in which to further test this question. RI-28, a radiation-induced T cell leukemia of the CBA/H strain acquired reduced levels of fluorescence-detected natural antibodies from the serum of X-linked immunodeficiency-bearing CBA/N and male (CBA/N x CBA/J) F1 mice compared with the serum from normals. Threshold s.c. inocula of the RI-28 appeared sooner and produced higher tumor frequencies in the X-linked immunodeficiency-bearing animals. This data coupled with the lack of correlating deficiencies in natural killer cell or activated macrophage activity provide the first genetic evidence for the hypothesis.\r"

  ".W": "The expression of serine protease genes was examined in murine NK cells that were purified by panning spleen cells with PMA. Although unstimulated NK cells were cytolytic, they were found not to express the C11 (chymotrypsin-like) mRNA. Culturing these cells in IL-2 (500 to 800 U/ml) for 5 to 7 days induced both the lytic activities and the protease enzymes by 20- to 30-fold. Concomitant to these activation events, the total steady state mRNA of both C11 and HF (trypsin-like) genes were also elevated. The activation of lysis, serine protease enzymes, and C11 and HF mRNA all peaked around day 5 in culture and was dose dependent. In order to exclude the possibility that PMA synergizes with IL-2 in this system, spleen cells from SCID mice, which contained mainly NK cells, were cultured under the same conditions (800 U/ml IL-2, with or without PMA) and PMA did not appear to enhance the expression of these mRNA. Similarly, IL-2 also induced the lytic activities, enzyme levels, and mRNA in the non-Ag-specific T killer cells isolated from spleens of normal mice. Lytic activity of T killer cells was not as high as the NK cells, however, the addition of PHA into the lytic assay resulted in enhanced lysis comparable to that of NK cells. These results showed that lytic activity increased along with protease enzyme levels and mRNA expression in both NK and resting T cells. Therefore, elevated levels of the protease enzymes could be one mechanism involved in optimal lytic activity of IL-2-induced lymphokine activated killer cells.\r"

As a function of time in culture, 4 of 14 TIL cultures eventually expressed highly specific cytolytic activity against fresh autologous melanoma targets in short term chromium release assays, failing to lyse multiple allogeneic tumors or autologous normal cells. These highly specific TIL were identified as CTL by phenotype (CD3+/CD4-/CD8+/Leu7-) and by function (lysis inhibited by antibodies directed against CD3 and MHC class I molecules). Cell separation experiments using immunomagnetic beads identified a highly tumor-specific CTL subpopulation within a nonspecific TIL culture, suggesting that the lytic activity of tumor-specific CTL may be diluted by the nonspecific killer activity present in heterogeneous TIL cultures. These studies provide evidence for specific MHC-restricted human immune responses against autologous tumor in cancer-bearing patients, and may be of importance to ongoing clinical trials using TIL in the immunotherapy of advanced malignancies.\r"

Three-color flow cytofluorometric analysis demonstrated that freshly isolated CD3+,CD4-, CD8- TCR-gamma delta lymph node cells were predominantly Thy-1+,CD5dull,IL-2R-,HSA-,B220-, and approximately 70% Ly-6C+ and 70% Pgp-1+. After CD3+,CD4-,CD8-splenocytes were expanded for 7 days in vitro with anti-CD3-epsilon mAb (145-2C11) and IL-2, the majority of the TCR-gamma delta cells expressed B220 and IL-2R, and 10 to 20% were CD8+. In comparison to CD8+ TCR-alpha beta T cells, the population of CD8+ TCR-gamma delta-bearing T cells exhibited reduced levels of CD8, and about 70% of the CD8+ TCR-gamma delta cells did not express Lyt-3 on the cell surface. Functional studies demonstrated that splenic TCR-gamma delta cells proliferated when stimulated with mAb directed against CD3-epsilon, Thy-1, and Ly-6C, but not when incubated with an anti-TCR V beta 8 mAb, consistent with the lack of TCR-alpha beta expression. In addition, activated CD3+,CD4-,CD8- peripheral murine TCR-gamma delta cells were capable of lysing syngeneic FcR-bearing targets in the presence of anti-CD3-epsilon mAb and the NK-sensitive cell line, YAC-1, in the absence of anti-CD3-epsilon mAb. Finally, activated CD3+, CD4-,CD8-,TCR-gamma delta+ splenocytes were also capable of producing IL-2, IL-3, IFN-gamma, and TNF when stimulated in vitro with anti-CD3-epsilon mAb.\r"

  ".W": "Cross-linking class I MHC molecules on human T cell clones by reacting them with various mAb directed at either monomorphic or polymorphic determinants on class I MHC molecules followed by cross-linking with GaMIg stimulated a rise in intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i), and induced proliferation and IL-2 production. T cell clones varied in the mean density of class I MHC molecules and the capacity to respond to mAb to class I MHC molecules. However, the functional responses of the clones did not correlate with class I MHC density or the CD4/CD8 phenotype. mAb to polymorphic class I MHC determinants were less able to induce an increase in [Ca2+]i and a functional response in the T cell clones. Additive stimulatory effects were noted when mAb against both HLA-A and HLA-B determinants were employed. Cross-linking class I MHC molecules on Jurkat cells induced a rise by [Ca2+]i and induced IL-2 production upon co-stimulation with PMA. Cross-linking class I MHC molecules on mutant Jurkat cells that expressed diminished levels of CD3 and were unable to produce IL-2 in response to anti-CD3 stimulation triggered both a rise in [Ca2+]i and IL-2 production with PMA co-stimulation. In contrast, cross-linking class I MHC molecules on mutant Jurkat cells that were CD3- stimulated neither a rise in [Ca2+]i nor IL-2 production. The combination of mAb to CD28 or ionomycin and PMA, however, was able to induce IL-2 production by CD3- Jurkat cells. The data demonstrate that cross-linking class I MHC molecules delivers a functionally important signal to T cell clones and Jurkat cells and indicate that class I MHC molecules may function to transduce activation signals to T cells. In addition, the data demonstrate that transmission of an activation signal via class I MHC molecules requires CD3 expression. The data, therefore, support a central role for CD3 in the transduction of activation signals to T cells via class I MHC molecules.\r"

  ".W": "We have used the intra-thymic transfer system to investigate the population dynamics of thymocyte and mature T cell subsets in the absence of continuing precursor input from the bone marrow. We have followed the development and life span of CD4+ and CD8+ thymocyte subsets and mature peripheral T cells from intra-thymically injected adult or fetal CD4-8- thymic precursors. Both precursor types proliferated, differentiated, and exported to peripheral lymphoid tissues alpha beta-TCR+CD4+8- and CD4-8+ progeny which formed a stable, long-lived component of the peripheral T cell pool. The production of phenotypically mature thymocytes and peripheral T cells occurred more rapidly from fetal CD4-8- precursors. CD4+8-:CD4-8+ ratios among peripheral progeny of intra-thymically-injected CD4-8- precursors were initially normal, but they steadily declined among progeny of the fetal precursors. Thus, there appear to be differences in the life span and/or proliferative capacity of mature T cells derived from embryonic vs adult progenitors. In addition to the predominant CD4+8- and CD4-8+ subsets of peripheral T cells, a minor (1 to 20%) population of Thy-1+CD3+4-8- T cells was identified among peripheral progeny of intra-thymically-injected CD4-8- thymocytes, as well as in lymph nodes of unmanipulated animals. A total of 20 to 34% of this subset expressed V beta 8+ TCR and the majority were CD5hi, Pgp-1+, and J11d-. The function and specificity of this newly identified population of thymically derived peripheral T cells remains to be investigated.\r"

  ".W": "Cholera toxin (CT) is a powerful oral immunogen and adjuvant that elicits strong IgG and IgA antibody responses. In our study we investigated whether this property of CT was associated with an effect on B cell isotype differentiation. Initially, we determined the effect of CT on normal LPS-induced Peyer's patch B cells and found that whereas CT is strongly inhibitory of IgM production, it increases by approximately three-fold the number and frequency of IgG- and IgA-producing cells. Subsequently, using cell sorting technology, we demonstrated that CT acts on membrane (m)IgM+, mIgG/mIgA- B cells rather than mIgG/mIgA+ B cells. In addition, we showed that CT does not cause selective inhibition of mIgM, or enhancement of mIgG/mIgA B cell proliferation. In parallel studies we determined the effect of CT on the differentiation of a clonal B cell population, CH12.LX cells, i.e., a population comprised mainly of mIgM+ cells (98%) admixed with a small subpopulation of mIgA+ cells (2%). Here we found that CT (in the absence of LPS) causes a rapid decrease (24 h) in the intensity of mIgM expression as well as a marked increase in the size of the subpopulation expressing mIgA. In addition, we found that CT (in the presence of LPS), inhibits CH12.LX IgM production while increasing the absolute number and frequency of IgA-producing cells. In contrast, CT inhibits IgA production by CH12.LX.A2 cells, a subclone of CH12.LX cells that bears only IgA. Finally, we demonstrated that CT is equally inhibitory of the proliferation of CH12.LX cells and CH12.LX.A2 cells. Taken together, these effects of CT on normal B cells and a clonal B cell line indicate that CT induces substantial numbers of mIgM+ cells to undergo isotype differentiation into mIgG+ or mIgA+ B cells. In a final series of studies we showed that the effect of CT on isotype differentiation was mimicked by the B subunit of CT, i.e., the subunit that does not activate intracellular adenylate cyclase; thus the induction of isotype differentiation by CT is not mediated by a perturbation in cAMP level.\r"

The data indicate that neonatal treatment with three injections of 50 microliters of anti-CD3 epsilon ascitic fluid induce a profound depletion of T cells in the peripheral lymphoid organs but do not modify the absolute number of thymocytes. This treatment completely abolishes the T cell functions of mice at least 3 wk after the last injection of mAb. In the thymus, this suppression is associated with a decrease in the number of TcR/CD3 molecules in the dull CD3+ cells and with a drastic reduction the bright CD3+ population. However, the amount and the size of the TcR alpha,beta and CD3 epsilon mRNA transcripts are not modified, suggesting that the down-regulation of the TcR/CD3 complex induced by anti-CD3 mAb does not exert a feedback inhibition on the transcription of TcR genes. The suppression induced by neonatal injections of anti-CD3 epsilon mAb is reversible and the induction of immune responses requires the reappearance of a minimal number of bright CD3+ cells. However, this suppression can be maintained without side effects for several months provided that anti-CD3 mAb were administered at 7-day intervals from birth. This injection schedule should allow the study of the effect of anti-CD3 antibodies during the T cell ontogeny on the establishment of the B and T cell repertoires.\r"

Preincubation of PBM with IL-4 did, however, inhibit LPS-induced IL-1 and TNF production in a dose- and time-related fashion. Maximal inhibition occurred after 96 h of incubation with 200 U/ml IL-4. RNA hybridization studies demonstrated that IL-4 suppressed the expression of IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and TNF mRNA. These results suggest IL-4 modulates monocyte production of TNF and IL-1 by down-regulation of gene expression.

Because IL-4 can induce the expression of the low affinity FcR for IgE (Fc epsilon RII) the ability of Th cell clones to induce Fc epsilon RII on purified splenic B cells was analyzed. It was found that a TH2 clone could cause a 50- to 100-fold superinduction of Fc epsilon RII after 2 days in culture; after 3 days, the Fc epsilon RII levels had almost returned to base line. The superinduction was inhibited by an anti-IL-4 antibody, 11B11, indicating its dependence on IL-4. A TH1 clone could cause a modest (four fold) induction of Fc epsilon RII, and this induction was not influenced by 11B11. A similar Fc epsilon RII induction was seen when using the supernatant from activated TH1 cells. The component(s) causing this relatively low level Fc epsilon RII induction is not known; a variety of known lymphokines were tested, and only IL-4 demonstrated any capacity for Fc epsilon RII induction on LPS-activated B cells. Addition of rIL-4 at concentrations of 400 U/ml or greater to the TH1 culture was sufficient to cause a Fc epsilon RII superinduction similar to that seen with the TH2 clone, while 40 U/ml was not. In order to determine a potential role for the Fc epsilon RII or its soluble fragment on the IgE synthesis mediated by TH2, a monoclonal anti-Fc epsilon RII, B3B4, was added to the culture. The addition of B3B4 did not have an influence on IgE levels in this system.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of stromal cells in bone marrow to support B lymphopoiesis may be partially mediated by secretion of biologically active factors. The first cytokine with lymphopoietic activity to be molecularly cloned from stromal cells, IL-7, was originally identified by its growth-promoting activity on long term cultured lymphocytes. We now report that murine rIL-7 is a potent proliferative stimulus for B cell progenitors isolated from fresh bone marrow. Proliferation was initially most obvious among large precursor cells which bear the B lineage associated Ag, Ly5/220 and BP1. A majority of these also contained cytoplasmic Ig mu H chains. Extended culture with IL-7 resulted in a predominance of immature c mu- lymphocytes. No effect by IL-7 was observed on the proliferation of mature lymphocytes. It also did not induce maturation in a number of early B lineage cell lines, or promote the formation of LPS-responsive, clonable B cells from precursors. When incorporated into semisolid agar medium, IL-7 specifically and rapidly induced the formation of pre-B cell colonies in a linear fashion with respect to numbers of cells cultured from either purified B cell progenitor preparations or unfractionated bone marrow. In both liquid and agar culture conditions, the IL-7 proliferative activity was inhibitable by two related forms of transforming growth factor (TGF) beta, TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2. Taken together, these results indicate that IL-7 is a stimulus for replication of normal B lineage cells at an early stage of differentiation, and its activity can be modulated by other cytokines. IL-7 also provides a means of studying the progeny of a single B cell progenitor, and of enumerating clonable pre-B cells in the absence of colony formation by other cell types in bone marrow.\r"

  ".W": "mAb to murine TNF (MuTNF) were produced after immunization of Armenian hamsters with purified, Escherichia coli-derived rMuTNF-alpha. Antibody produced from clone TN3-19.12, was purified and was found to inhibit 100% of the lytic activity of either recombinant or natural MuTNF-alpha at an antibody input of 25 ng/U. TN3-19.12 also inhibited all the lytic activity in culture supernatants from a variety of T cell sources, including activated T cell clones and T cell hybridomas (all of which expressed high levels of TNF-alpha and TNF-beta (lymphotoxin, LT) mRNA). Western blot analysis was used to document the physical form(s) of MuTNF recognized by TN3-19.12. Recombinant and macrophage-derived TNF displayed identical patterns of a single band with Mr 17 kDa. In contrast, T cell culture supernatants exhibited patterns consisting of two bands with Mr 17 and 24.7 kDa. The higher m.w. form was glycosylated based on its sensitivity to n-glycanase and displayed a m.w. consistent with that of TNF-beta (LT). These data suggest that TN3-19.12 recognizes both MuTNF-alpha and MuTNF-beta (LT). Monoclonal TN3-19.12 and polyvalent rabbit anti-rTNF were used to establish a MuTNF-specific ELISA capable of detecting picogram quantities of recombinant or natural TNF. This assay was used to detect TNF in the sera of mice challenged with a lethal dose of LPS. Peak TNF serum levels of 11 ng/ml were observed in these animals 90 min after i.p. LPS administration and then rapidly declined to near base line levels by 3 h. These values were confirmed by quantitating levels of TNF functional activity in the same samples. TN3-19.12 injected into mice subsequently treated with LPS prevented the detection of TNF in the circulation by either assay and protected mice from the lethal effects of endotoxin shock. Thus, TN3-19.12 effectively neutralizes endogenously produced TNF in vivo.\r"

Conditioned medium (CM) from one such line (TC-1) stimulated marked proliferation of B cells previously activated by anti-Ig (anti-Ig blasts). Proliferation of anti-Ig blasts was not induced by purified cytokines known to be produced by TC-1 (CSF-1, GM-CSF, or G-CSF) or by IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, or IL-6. Furthermore, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-5, alone or in combination, failed to support proliferation or differentiation of anti-Ig blasts. TC-1 CM enhanced proliferation of B cells that were co-cultured with LPS, anti-Ig, or dextran sulfate; co-stimulation with anti-Ig was unaffected by the presence of monoclonal anti-IL-4. Proliferation of low, but not high, density B cells isolated from spleen was directly stimulated by TC-1 CM. These results suggest that bone marrow stromal cells produce a novel B cell stimulatory factor (BSF-TC) that induces proliferation of activated B cells.\r"

Several plasmid constructs containing soluble receptor sequence were prepared. Only a chimeric gene containing the sequences encoding IL-6 signal peptide and the soluble moiety of Fc epsilon RII could be expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and CHO cells, resulting in the secretion of soluble Fc epsilon RII. The recombinant soluble Fc epsilon RII was also produced in the yeast expression system. The NH2-terminal sequence analysis of the chimeric gene product generated by oocytes demonstrated the correct cleavage of IL-6 leader sequence by a signal peptidase. Moreover, most of CHO cell and all of the yeast-derived recombinant molecules were products identical with the native B cell-derived soluble Fc epsilon RII. These recombinant products as well as the natural soluble receptor derived from a human B cell line could bind both human IgE and two different anti-Fc epsilon RII mAb and could competitively inhibit the binding of IgE to Fc epsilon RII-expressing cells. However, the recombinant soluble Fc epsilon RII and highly purified native molecules did not display any B cell growth-promoting activity.\r"

An IgA-mediated rosetting technique was used to assess the presence of Fc alpha R+ cells in various lymphoid tissues from normal BALB/c mice and mice bearing an IgA plasmacytoma (MOPC 315). Tissues from the MOPC 315-bearing BALB/c mice were found to have a significantly higher percentage of Fc alpha R+ cells; thus, nonadherent spleen cells from MOPC 315-bearing mice were used as a source of Fc alpha R+ cells in these studies. The cells were preincubated with anti-SC and then assayed for the ability of IgA to bind to the Fc alpha R. Antisera to SC from various species inhibited the formation of IgA-mediated rosettes, although preincubation of the Fc alpha R+ cells with antisera directed against other cell surface molecules (e.g., Thy1.2, Lyt1, Lyt2, Fc gamma R, MHC class I and II) or preimmune sera had no significant effect on IgA-mediated rosette formation. Preabsorption of the anti-SC with secretory IgA or with free SC removed the inhibitory effect; preabsorption with myeloma IgA had no effect. These data suggest that SC and Fc alpha R are related serologically and may be structurally related, possible in the IgA-binding region.\r"

In homologous complement-mediated killing two protective proteins, which are anchored to the cell membrane by phosphatidylinositol glycan (PIG) tails, are known. To study whether similar PIG-tailed proteins protect against lymphocyte-mediated killing, nucleated cell lines with a mutation in the biosynthesis of the PIG anchor were used. It was found that PIG-tailed membrane proteins restrict homologous complement-mediated lysis but not three different types of cell-mediated killing or lysis by purified perforin. Furthermore, E from patients with an acquired defect in PIG tail biosynthesis did not differ from normal E in sensitivity to antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, in spite of their increased sensitivity to human C8 and C9.\r"

This cross-reactive determinant was recognized by a murine mAb WW.B1, which was raised against H.MBP. WW.B1 recognized PBMC and the Jurkat T leukemic cell line, immunoprecipitated both H.MBP and a complex indistinguishable from CD3, and possessed the same biologic properties--induction of T lymphocyte proliferation and inhibition of CTL function--as commercially available anti-CD3 antibodies. It is likely, however, that the epitope recognized by WW.B1 is distinct from those recognized by the anti-CD3 mAb OKT3 and anti-Leu-4. Although the biologic importance of this common determinant awaits further clarification, it is conceivable that autoimmunization to MBP could induce similar immunoregulatory antibody specificities.\r"

  ".W": "Histamine releasing factors (HRF) are a group of cytokines that release histamine and other mediators from mast cells and basophils. It has been speculated that HRF might play a major role in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases. Most investigators have studied PBMC as a source of HRF. This study was undertaken to investigate the cellular origin of HRF. Peripheral blood was processed to isolate and purify monocytes, T cells, CD4- T cells, CD8- T cells and B cells by using plastic adherence, 2-aminoethylisothiomonium-treated SRBC rosetting and negative selection with the use of mAb OKM1, OKT11, OKT8, OKT4, and OKB7 plus C. Highly purified subpopulations of PBMC were cultured alone or in the presence of Con A for 24 h. Supernatants were harvested, dialyzed, and assayed for HRF activity in the basophil histamine release test. We found that all subpopulations of PBMC including T cells, CD4- T cells, CD8- T cells, B cells, and monocytes produce variable quantities of HRF. The spontaneous production is very high in B cells but only barely measurable in T cells and monocytes. The synthesis of HRF by B cells was confirmed by abolishing the release of the activity after treatment of B cells with OKB7 mAb and C. Stimulation of cell populations by Con A significantly enhances HRF production by PBMC and T cells but not by B cells and monocytes. In mixing experiments, unstimulated monocytes + B cells showed synergism, but other combinations demonstrated an additive effect. This is the first demonstration of HRF production by human peripheral blood B cells. The results of this study also suggest that histamine releasing cytokines are of multiple cellular origin. This perhaps contributes to their molecular heterogeneity.\r"

Both have second domain sequences homologous to the B1 locus of the DRw52 family (DR3, DR5, and DRw6) and not the B3 locus. However, the 3'UT sequence is homologous to the 3'UT region of the B3 locus of the DRw52 family, and not the B1 locus. The first domain sequences are B1-like as opposed to B3-like and show polymorphism in the region encoding the putative alpha-helical region of the DR beta-chain. The easiest interpretation is that the DRw8 haplotypes constitute a sublineage within the DRw52 group and that this lineage has arisen by a small chromosomal deletion of the region between the B1 locus and the B3 locus. This deletion included the 3'UT region of the B1 locus, the B2 pseudogene, and the 5' end of the B3 locus including the exons encoding the first and second domains. After the deletion, two changes in the first domain arose by a mutational mechanism, possibly gene conversion. One of these changes parallels one seen in the DRw11 lineage.\r"

  ".W": "We have targeted CD4+ cytotoxic Th (Th/c) lymphocytes to a B cell lymphoma, through the use of a bispecific antibody containing binding sites for both the CD3 complex on the Th/c and the Id on the surface Ig of the B lymphoma (anti-CD3-anti-Id). Cloned, keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH)-specific Th/c cells were nonspecifically activated by the anti-CD3-anti-Id conjugate to lyse the Id+ B lymphoma A20-HL. This cytotoxicity was not inhibited by antibodies to CD4 or LFA-1 alpha molecules. The anti-CD3-anti-Id conjugates also induced non-lytic Th clones to become cytotoxic, a function not elicited when these cells were activated specifically by Ag. We compare this model to our previously described system where we targeted the KLH-specific Th/c cells to the Id+ B lymphoma A20-HL via a conjugate consisting of KLH covalently linked to the anti-Id antibody (KLH-anti-Id). The mechanism involved processing and presentation of KLH by the A20-HL target. This Ag-specific cytotoxicity was MHC class II restricted and was inhibited by antibodies to the CD4 molecule. In both systems, activation of the Th/c cells resulted in bystander killing of tumor but not normal targets. These results may have important implications for the use of Th/c cells in tumor immunotherapy.\r"

Studies performed with an Ag-specific T cell hybridoma demonstrated that growth inhibition is an early (within 1 h) manifestation of activation. Experiment in which extracellular Ca2+ was chelated or in which cyclosporine A was included indicated that activation-associated growth inhibition is a two-step process. The first phase is the establishment of a G1/S cell cycle block; it does not require extracellular Ca2+ and is not prevented by the addition of cyclosporine A. The second phase is cell lysis. It can be detected 4 to 6 h after activation, requires the presence of extracellular Ca2+, and is prevented when stimulation occurs in the presence of cyclosporine A. The observation that both Ca2+ depletion and cyclosporine A prevented IL-2 secretion at all time points indicates that the pathways leading to lymphokine secretion and the G1/S block diverge early in the course of the cellular response, and establish the cell cycle block as a distinct activation event with unique characteristics.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the mechanisms whereby human T cells and NK cells are activated and directed to lyse tumor targets through the CD2 (T11/E-rosette) Ag. Using two cloned NK lines, we showed that these cells, as had previously been shown for T cells, could be directed to lyse an \"NK-resistant\" tumor target in the presence of antibody heterodimers. These heterodimers consisted of a (mAb) to CD2 (anti-T11(2) or anti-T11(3] linked to a mAb recognizing the tumor cell (J5, anti-CALLA). However, distinct differences between NK cells and T cells were observed with regard to the requirements for such directed lysis: first, only one epitope of CD2 on NK cells (either T11(2) or T11(3] needed to be recognized by the antibody heterodimer in order for directed lysis to occur, whereas for T cells both T11(2) and T11(3) epitopes had to be recognized. Second, in confirmation of previous data with monomeric anti-T11(2) or anti-T11(3) antibody, heterodimers constructed with these reagents enhanced conjugate formation between NK cells and tumor targets, whereas no such enhancement was seen with T cells. All types of heterodimer directed lysis were dependent on the adhesion molecule LFA-1, as an anti-LFA-1 antibody-blocked lysis. Third, whereas in T cells lysis mediated through CD2 appeared to be regulated by CD3 but not vice versa, all types of lysis by NK cells appeared to be regulated through CD2. Finally we showed that F(ab')2 fragments of the anti-T11(2) and anti-T11(3) antibodies could activate NK cells, but were unable to activate T cells either as cloned cytolytic lines, or in populations of PBL. The implications of our findings with regard to the role of CD2 in the activation of cytolytic cells is discussed.\r"

It reacted specifically with membrane glycoprotein complexes on early haematopoietic cells, T cells, and monocytes. In epidermis, K20 specifically reacted with Langerhans cells and basal keratinocytes, as demonstrated by double labeling experiments. Membrane immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that the antigen identified by K20 on lymphoid cells and epidermal cells was different. While on lymphoid cells, K20 recognized glycoprotein complexes made of a constant 130-kD subunit associated with subunits of higher molecular weight ranging from 150 to 200 kD, a complex of 105-145 kD was precipitated from Langerhans and basal cells. Metabolic labeling studies demonstrated that these proteins were synthesized by the basal cells. The antigen identified by K20 was thought to belong to the integrins, a family of cell surface receptors that play a role in cell adhesion, cell interactions, wound healing, and immune defense mechanisms. K20 is the first monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes a membrane antigen common to Langerhans and basal cells. Additionally, K20 is the first of five reported monoclonal antibodies to have been characterized on the epidermal cells that detect antigens shared by lymphoid subpopulations and normal basal keratinocytes.\r"

Using epidermal cells greatly enriched for DETC and depleted of Langerhans cells, we found that DETC have growth requirements quite different from those of accessory cell-depleted lymph node and splenic T cells. Although the latter cells strongly proliferate in response to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) + ionomycin, DETC, when exposed to interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-3 (IL-3), concanavalin A (ConA), PMA, and ionomycin used either alone or in combination, do not exhibit significant mitotic activity. Recombinant interleukin 2 (rIL-2), albeit ineffective by itself, leads to vigorous proliferation of DETC when used with either ConA or PMA + ionomycin + IL-1. In contrast, the combination of PMA and recombinant interleukin-4 (rIL-4), which triggers growth of lymph node T cells, does not induce proliferation of DETC. Although a portion of proliferating DETC expressed CD8 antigens, essentially none bore detectable amounts of surface-bound CD4 or CD5 antigens, or both. Continuing stimulation of primary DETC cultures with lectin/lymphokine-rich media results in the propagation of cells with the essential phenotypic features of resident DETC.\r"

  ".W": "Dental disorders have been recognized as major sources of infection in patients with hematologic malignancies (HM). Management of severe dental infections usually includes dental extractions (DE), but the safety of extractions in patients with HM who are at risk for bleeding, sepsis, and poor wound healing has not been well established. In conjunction with an aggressive program of dental care, 142 DE were performed in 26 patients with acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, and myeloproliferative disorders. Granulocytopenia (less than 1,000 granulocytes/microL) was present during or within ten days following surgery in 14 patients. In these 14 patients (101 DE), the mean granulocyte count was less than 450/microL, with a median duration of granulocytopenia following surgery of 32 days (range, four to 169 days). Thrombocytopenia (less than 100,000 platelets/microL) occurred during or within two days following surgery in 13 patients (80 DE), with a mean platelet count of 63,500/microL. Transfusions were given for platelet counts less than 50,000/microL. All DE were performed without significant complications. Bleeding was minor to moderate and easily controlled with local measures; no patient required transfusion due to hemorrhage. Average maximum temperature 24 hours after DE was 37.7 degrees C. No episodes of bacteremia were documented within ten days of DE. Minor delay in wound healing was observed in two patients. We conclude that DE can be safely performed in patients with HM in combination with aggressive supportive care.\r"

In two patients, baseline, large focal cortical abnormalities of glucose utilization were reversed during the course of therapy. In the other two patients, the initial PET study did not reveal pronounced focal alterations, while the post-treatment scans showed markedly increased cortical glucose metabolism. The improved cortical glucose utilization was accompanied in all patients by immunologic and neurologic improvement.

  ".W": "Although the distribution of [99mTc]hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HM-PAO) in the brain is said to be in a flow-related manner without temporal change, we present cases with leakage of [99mTc]HM-PAO (filling out phenomenon) in the delayed image of brain single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and clarify its clinical significance. The filling out phenomenon was observed in seven out of 21 cases of cerebrovascular disease and four cases of arteriovenous malformation. The leakage of [99mTc]HM-PAO was also confirmed by visual and semiquantitative analysis. In the pharmacokinetics of [99mTc]HM-PAO in the blood, the percent dose of plasma fraction at 4 hr was reduced to 54% of activity at 30 min. The percent dose of brain blood could be predicted as 3.36%/1 at 30 min and 2.35%/1 at 4 hr after correction with the hematocrit of the brain. The filling out phenomenon of [99mTc]HM-PAO was attributed to a significant reduction of blood activity of [99mTc]HM-PAO in the plasma. Since the initial image might mask reduced rCBF with an increase of rCBV, the late image would have an advantage in accurately evaluating rCBF from the clearance of [99mTc] HM-PAO bound to the plasma. Therefore, the filling out phenomenon of [99mTc]HM-PAO in late images of brain SPECT could show the area of mild cerebral ischemia accompanying cerebral vascular reserve.\r"

We propose that automatic quantification of these images is possible, and here we describe the implementation and validation of a method to perform this task. Automatic computer methods were developed to locate the left ventricular (LV) endocardial surfaces in all time frames of the cardiac cycle. Global, regional, and local motion and volume were computed. Results were displayed using three-dimensional graphics. The methods were validated using phantom, canine, and human studies. Actual phantom values correlated well with experimentally determined volumes, y = 1.01x + 1.29ml, r = 0.99. In the canine model, the LV endocardial surfaces were located to within an average of 1.9 mm and 3.7 mm at end-diastole and end-systole, respectively. Areas of obvious wall motion abnormalities in automatically processed patient studies corresponded well with angiographically documented coronary artery disease. End-diastolic and end-systolic volumes computed automatically from single photon emission computed tomography averaged errors of 9% and 38%, respectively, when compared with contrast ventriculographic volumes. These results indicate that it is possible to automatically identify the left ventricular endocardial surface in gated tomographic radionuclide ventriculograms. The location of these surfaces corresponds well with the location of implanted endocardial markers, and global volume computed from these surfaces corresponds well with known volumes.\r"

The 88Y-SCN-Bz-DTPA-B72.3 yielded 40% ID/g at 5-7 days in the tumors, while the 88Y-SCN-Bz-EDTA-B72.3 and 88Y-CA-DTPA-B72.3 showed only 6-8% ID/g. The yttrium uptake in the bone with the SCN-Bz-EDTA and CA-DTPA conjugated IgG was over 14 and 11% ID/g, respectively, while 88Y-SCN-Bz-DTPA-B72.3 showed only 3% ID/g. In contrast, the 111In-labeled B72.3 uptake in the bone with all three chelate conjugates was 2-3% ID/g. The differences in yttrium- versus indium-labeled MAb biodistributions demonstrate the difficulty in using 111In-labeled MAbs to predict the biodistribution and dosimetry of 90Y-labeled MAbs unless chelate conjugates such as SCN-Bz-DTPA are used.\r"

Considered sequentially are the clinical problem, current noninvasive radionuclide methods, positron emission tomograph, and the cost of PET per study. Also analyzed are the costs of PET versus thallium imaging in the management of chest pain, for screening asymptomatic men at high risk for coronary artery disease and for evaluating myocardial viability after myocardial infarction or thrombolytic therapy. Noninvasive assessment of coronary artery stenosis and myocardial ischemia/viability in symptomatic or asymptomatic subjects remains a major medical problem because the sensitivity and specificity of thallium imaging are only 70-85% and 50-70%, respectively, in recent studies. Cardiac positron imaging has an accuracy for noninvasive diagnosis of coronary artery disease in symptomatic or asymptomatic patients with a sensitivity and specificity of 95-98%. It can also be used for assessing physiologic stenosis severity, for imaging myocardial infarction and viability, for assessing effects of interventions such as thrombolysis, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or bypass surgery on myocardial perfusion, metabolism or coronary flow reserve, for assessing collateral function noninvasively in man, and for diagnosing cardiomyopathy not due to coronary artery disease. Although the cost for cardiac PET with 82Rb may be modestly higher than for 201Tl, the greater diagnostic yield of PET results in comparable or lower overall medical management costs than no diagnostic tests/interventions and lower overall costs compared to thallium imaging for evaluating patients with chest pain, asymptomatic high risk males, and patients after acute myocardial infarction/thrombolysis for myocardial viability.\r"

SETTING AND PATIENTS: Children: a convenience sample of 32 healthy 2-year-old children from diverse locales. Adults: a convenience sample of 16 healthy adults chosen from employees at the Washington University and Tulane University schools of medicine. INTERVENTIONS: PRP or PRP-D vaccine administered to the adults and serum obtained daily for 5 days. PRP vaccine was administered to the children, and serum was sampled 2 or 3 days or 4 or 5 days after immunization, or both. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Decline in serum antibody in all seven (100%) adult recipients of PRP. The nadir occurred on days 1 to 3, and the decrease average 26.0% of the preimmunization concentration. Eight (89%) of nine PRP-D recipients had a similar decline that averaged 25.9%. Of 29 children, 20 (69%) had a decline that averaged 14.7%. The magnitude of anticapsular antibody present before immunization was correlated with the magnitude of the observed decrease. CONCLUSIONS: A decrease in serum anticapsular antibody occurs in most children and adults immunized with PRP (adults and children) or PRP-D (adults). Such a decrease might transiently increase the risk of invasive disease if it occurred during a period of asymptomatic colonization with H. influenzae type b.\r"

During maintenance and 6 months after the completion of therapy, blood and urine were analyzed for calcium and magnesium and blood for osteocalcin, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone. Bone mineral content and bone width of the distal one third of the radius of the nondominant arm was measured by single-photon absorptiometry. During therapy, mild ionic hypocalcemia (less than 1.19 mmol/L) and hypomagnesemia (less than 0.77 mmol/L) were demonstrated in 9 and 8 of 16 children, respectively; hypercalciuria (8/16) and hypomagnesiuria (12/16) were also observed. Plasma osteocalcin values correlated with plasma magnesium levels (r = 0.54; p less than 0.05). Oral magnesium supplements normalized plasma magnesium, calcium, and osteocalcin levels, all of which were normal at the postchemotherapy study. Plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels were nondetectable (less than 8 ng/ml) in 12 of 13 patients receiving therapy and in 7 of 14 patients not receiving therapy; alkaline phosphatase activity increased significantly after therapy (179 +/- 86 to 340 +/- 101 units/L), and parathyroid hormone levels were normal in both studies. Bone mineral content/bone width ratio was less than 1 SD below the mean for age- and sex-related population standards in 70% of patients. These data indicate that alterations in magnesium, calcium, and vitamin D metabolism in children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia may be instrumental in inducing or sustaining altered bone turnover during chemotherapy.\r"

In patients with nonsecondary RP the duration of disease was correlated with the level of Tlco (r = 0.55), probably explained by a higher prevalence of truly primary RP in patients with longstanding nonsecondary RP.

DRw8 incidence correlated with an onset under 5 years, 9 of 12 DRw8+ cases being in this subgroup (Fp = less than 0.06), whereas B5 and C4A QO were prevalent in late onset (greater than or equal to 5 years). Erosions after 5 years associated with HLA-DRw6, and their absence with -Cw1 and -DR5. Genetic susceptibility factors and a further subdivision by onset age are thus demonstrated in this disease.

In 8 sequential trials, 90 Louvain (LOU) rats and 91 Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were immunized with chick type II collagen and given amiprilose HC1 in water (1 mg/ml) or water alone. In the LOU rats, the arthritis incidence was 7/46 (15%) in the amiprilose HC1 group vs 16/44 (36%) in the water group (p less than 0.01). In the SD rats, the incidence was 28/46 (60%) in the experimental vs 33/45 (73%) in the control group (p greater than NS), although the prevalence of arthritis on Days 16 and 21 was significantly (p less than 0.03) lower in the experimental group. Amiprilose HC1 did not affect the antibody titers or delayed-type hypersensitivity to collagen, or T cell subset distribution in the LOU experiments. Two analogues, SM-1211 and SM-1212, did not alter this disease. No toxicity was noted. At a nontoxic concentration of 1 mg/ml, amiprilose HC1 suppressed 3H thymidine incorporation in cultured rabbit synovial fibroblasts by 78% and resulted in the appearance of numerous intracytoplasmic granules/vacuoles. These effects were partially antagonized by indomethacin or dexamethasone at 10(-7) M. SM-1211 was inert in this system. Amiprilose HC1 system also reduced rabbit synoviocyte supernatant prostaglandin E2 levels up to 73% in a dose related fashion, but did not affect collagenase activity. These morphologic changes in synoviocytes, combined with anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects, provide evidence that amiprilose HC1 possesses modest and nontoxic antirheumatic properties. A search for analogues of this sugar with more substantial clinical activities is warranted.\r"

  ".W": "There is marked debate by physicians and policymakers regarding the creation of regionalized acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) centers. A central issue is whether outcomes of care, particularly mortality, differ as a function of hospital experience with patients with AIDS. We evaluated the experience of 257 patients with AIDS and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia treated at 15 California hospitals between October 1986 and October 1987. An overall 15.2% in-hospital mortality rate was observed. However, a markedly lower in-hospital mortality rate was observed in the group of patients treated at hospitals that had a high level of experience with patients with AIDS (greater than or equal to 30 human immunodeficiency virus-related discharges per 10,000 hospital discharges) relative to the group treated at hospitals with less experience (less than 30 human immunodeficiency virus-related discharges per 10,000 hospital discharges): 12% vs 33%. Other factors significantly associated with in-hospital mortality included intensive care unit use, admission from an emergency department or through an interhospital transfer, and a history of hospitalizations. A logistic regression model indicated that, after controlling for severity indicators, AIDS experience remained significantly related to mortality. Our findings suggest that policymakers should consider three options: creating regional AIDS centers, implementing policies that promote a rapid but carefully monitored increase in experience of low-volume hospitals with human immunodeficiency virus-infected individuals, or providing highly focused educational efforts at low-AIDS-experience facilities. Without such policy initiatives, differences in mortality rates like those we have found might persist as cases of AIDS begin to occur in every area of the country.\r"

The Kansas City area is the first of two major metropolitan sites being evaluated in the Midwestern Prevention Project, a longitudinal trial for primary prevention of cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana use in adolescents. The project includes mass media programming, a school-based educational program for youths, parent education and organization, community organization, and health policy components that are introduced sequentially into communities during a 6-year period. Effects of the program are determined through annual assessments of adolescent drug use in schools that are assigned to immediate intervention or delayed intervention control conditions. In the first 2 years of the project, 22,500 sixth- and seventh-grade adolescents received the school-based educational program component, with parental involvement in homework and mass media coverage. Analyses of 42 schools indicate that the prevalence rates of use for all three drugs are significantly lower at 1-year follow-up in the intervention condition relative to the delayed intervention condition, with or without controlling for race, grade, socioeconomic status, and urbanicity (17% vs 24% for cigarette smoking, 11% vs 16% for alcohol use, and 7% vs 10% for marijuana use in the last month), and the net increase in drug use prevalence among intervention schools is half that of delayed intervention schools.\r"

  ".W": "All adult patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (greater than or equal to 15 years old, n = 86) from a defined population (approximately 160,000 population at risk) were followed prospectively over 6 years. The study area comprised 2 health care districts served by only 1 hospital. Retrieval was based on clinical case finding and computerized diagnosis and laboratory registers. The incidence of the disease was 4.0 cases/100,000 adults/year and was stable during the 6 years, suggesting that completeness of retrieval was high. Point prevalence by the end of 1986 was 42 cases/100,000 population at risk and 5-year survival in the prospective group 97%. Immunologically the group was characterized by a high frequency of positive anti-dsDNA (73%), and a low frequency of rheumatoid factor positivity (10%). The frequency of ARA criteria (median, 6) was comparable with previous larger series of selected patients. Sixteen percent of the patients were males, and they had more serositis and renal manifestations than females. In view of the low mortality we studied the more sensitive outcome measures: disease activity, irreversible organ damage, and functional impairment. After the diagnosis year, disease flares occurred with a constant frequency of 0.2 flares/year/patient, even after long duration of disease. Patients with neuropsychiatric disease, history of drug reactions, and immunological abnormalities such as persistent hypocomplementemia, antibodies to dsDNA, and cardiolipin had a high frequency of relapse. In contrast, elderly patients with serositis during their first flare seldom relapsed. The number of gainfully employed individuals was normal. Neuropsychiatric disease and joint involvement were principal causes of long-standing functional impairment. Notably, patients with renal disease usually fared well, as reflected by preserved renal function and little functional by preserved renal function and little functional impairment. Disease duration and glucocorticoid treatment were major denominators for morbidity due to infections and vascular disease with the incidence of myocardial infarctions being 9 times more common than that in a Swedish control population. Prolonged glucocorticoid treatment was also related to mortality, which was predominantly due to cardiovascular or central nervous system disease. The present prospective and epidemiologically based study of outcome in SLE was made possible by a uniquely coordinated health care system, enabling complete identification of the patients within the study area.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The so-called very-late-activation antigen (VLA) family includes at least five distinct heterodimers, each composed of a unique alpha-subunit non-covalently associated with a common beta-subunit. Several members of the family have been shown to bind extracellular matrix proteins, but the function of VLA-4 is so far unknown. VLA-4 is the only member of the family detected on thymocytes and resting T cells. We show here that an antibody which recognizes the beta-subunit of VLA-4 (CD29) on T cells can inhibit CD4+ cell proliferation triggered by CD2 or CD3, and that binding of this antibody to activated T cells leads to an increase in cyclic AMP levels which is comparable to that elicited by forskolin. These negative signalling effects are unique to this antibody: other CD29 antibodies do not affect the growth of activated CD4 cells but enhance the proliferation of whole T cell populations and abrogate the suppressive effects of mitomycin-treated CD8 cells on CD4-cell growth. Taken together, our results indicate that VLA-4 functions in cell-cell interactions and that it is the target for the suppressive effects of CD8 cells on CD4 cells.\r"

The murine T-cell response to staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) has recently been shown to involve only those T cells expressing T-cell receptor V beta 3, 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3 domains, a situation which closely mimics the response to Mls antigens. This paper examines the initial events in SEA and SEB T-cell activation and shows that MHC restriction results from a direct high affinity binding by intact SEA and SEB to the same site on MHC class II HLA-DR antigens.\r"

  ".W": "Most antigens must be processed intracellularly before they can be presented, in association with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules at the cell surface, for recognition by the antigen-specific receptor of T cells. This processing appears to involve cleavage of protein antigens to smaller peptides. Only certain fragments of any protein can serve as T-cell epitopes and this is, at least in part, determined by the requirement that peptides be able to bind the MHC molecules. Class I restricted antigens are derived from proteins, such as viral antigens, that are synthesized within the presenting cell. Many of these antigens are cytosolic proteins and recent evidence suggests that it is in the cytosol that these proteins are processed to produce either the antigenic peptides or processed intermediates. How and where these processed cytosolic antigens cross the membrane of the vacuolar system and bind to the extracellular domain of the class I molecule is not known but one obvious site for this process is the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), because this organelle is specialized to translocate proteins across the membrane from the cytosol into the secretory system. Based on this model, we reasoned that if we could pharmacologically block the movement of proteins out of the ER, endogenous antigen presentation would cease. An agent which causes such an effect is available--the fungal antibiotic Brefeldin A (BFA). Consistent with the above hypothesis, we report that BFA completely abolishes the ability of a cell to present endogenously synthesized antigens to class I restricted cytotoxic T cells.\r"

In turn, decreased immune functioning might lead to more frequent or more severe infectious diseases. Delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity was assessed in young Peruvian children by simultaneous application of seven standardized antigens and a negative control (Multitest CMI). Response to tuberculin was frequent and was higher in children vaccinated with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin, response to tetanus or diphtheria toxoids was also good, especially in children who had received at least two doses of diphtheria-tetanus toxoids-pertussis vaccine. Two summary assessments, the number of positive responses and the sum of indurations of all positive responses provided useful measures of delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity. Responsiveness, as assessed by these summary measures, was inversely related to the incidence of diarrhea, identified by household surveillance for the 6 months after the skin test. Undernutrition, as assessed by weight for age or length for age, was also a significant determinant of the incidence of diarrhea, but not the duration of episodes, in this group of study children. Depressed cell-mediated immunity and malnutrition may be important risk factors for diarrhea in developing country children.\r"

Sixteen had been treated with acyclovir and six with vidarabine. Antiviral susceptibilities were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and are expressed as the 50% inhibitory dose. All HSV isolates had a 50% inhibitory dose for acyclovir of less than 1.0 micrograms/ml. The mean vidarabine 50% inhibitory dose was 11.4 micrograms/ml for pretherapy isolates and 8.9 micrograms/ml for posttherapy isolates. Antiviral therapy did not select for recurrences with HSV resistant to acyclovir or vidarabine.\r"

  ".W": "We have developed a quantitative method for examining the removal of N-methylpurines from specific genes to investigate their possible differential repair throughout the genome. Chinese hamster ovary cells were exposed to dimethyl sulfate, and the isolated DNA was treated with an appropriate restriction endonuclease. The DNA was heated to convert remaining N-methylpurines to apurinic sites to render them alkaline-labile. Duplicate samples heated in the presence of methoxyamine to protect the apurinic sites from alkaline hydrolysis provided controls to assess total DNA. After alkaline hydrolysis, agarose gel electrophoresis, Southern transfer, and probing for the fragment of interest, the ratios of band intensities of the test DNA sample to its methoxyamine-treated control counterpart were calculated to yield the percentage of fragments containing no alkaline-labile sites. The frequency of N-methylpurines was measured at different times after dimethyl sulfate treatment to study repair. We found no differences between the rates of repair of N-methylpurines in the active dihydrofolate reductase gene and a nontranscribed region located downstream from it in treated cells. Also, similar rates of repair were observed in the transcribed and nontranscribed strands of the gene, in contrast to previous results for the removal of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. Thus, there does not appear to be a coupling of N-methylpurine repair to transcription in Chinese hamster ovary cells. However, the repair in the dihydrofolate reductase domain appears to be somewhat more efficient than that in the genome overall. Our method permits the quantifying at the defined gene level of abasic sites or of any DNA adduct that can be converted to them.\r"

  ".W": "Evidence from various antigen systems suggests that antigen processing can be one factor that determines the repertoire of immunogenic peptides. Thus, processing events may account for some of the disparity between the available and expressed helper T-cell repertoires. In this report, we demonstrate that the immunodominant T-cell determinant in ovalbumin [p323-339; ovalbumin-(323-339) heptadecapeptide] is processed differently by two genetically identical antigen-presenting cell lines, M12 and A20. The ovalbumin-specific T-cell-T-cell hybridomas, DO-11.10 and 3DO-54.8, were used to detect processed antigen. These T-T hybridomas have different fine specificities for the p323-339 determinant. A20 cells presented native ovalbumin well to both T-T hybridomas, whereas M12 cells presented native ovalbumin well to 3DO-54.8 but very inefficiently to DO-11.10. M12 and A20 cells effectively stimulated both T-T hybridomas with the same concentrations of the immunogenic synthetic peptide p323-339. Therefore, M12 cells and DO-11.10 can interact with each other, and both T-T hybridomas have similar sensitivities for the same immunogenic peptide. We conclude that genetically identical antigen-presenting cells can display heterogeneity in the fine processing of an immunodominant T-cell determinant, and synthetic model peptides that represent the minimal stimulatory sequence of a T-cell determinant are not necessarily identical to the structure of in vivo processed antigen. Heterogeneity in antigen processing by individual antigen-presenting cells would serve to increase the repertoire of immunogenic peptides that are presented to T cells.\r"

We have studied fetal liver, which was originally considered to contain CEA. A first-trimester cDNA library from fetal liver was screened with CEA-specific probes, and a dominant cDNA clone was identified and sequenced. This 1.7-kilobase cDNA codes for a complete protein of 426 amino acids, of which 34 constitute a leader peptide. Structurally, it can be divided into four immunoglobulin-like domains homologous to CEA (N-A1-A2-B2) and a hydrophobic tail (12 residues). The A and B domains each contain two cysteines; the N domain has none. The protein has seven potential sites for asparagine-linked glycosylation. It is a form of pregnancy-specific beta 1-glycoprotein (PS beta G) but differs from other PS beta G species at the C terminus. The N and A1 domains show 45% and 51% amino acid sequence identity with the corresponding domains of the three CEA family members whose sequences have been determined. Expression studies showed that the cDNA codes for a 72-kDa glycoprotein that reacts immunologically with antisera to CEA, biliary glycoprotein I, and PS beta G. The 72-kDa glycoprotein was released from the transfected cells. At least six mRNA species were identified in human tissues by using this cDNA as a probe. Genomic DNA analysis with an N-domain-specific probe indicated that the number of genes is relatively small.\r"

  ".U": "89240748\r", 
  ".W": "Lipoxin A4 (LXA4) was competitive with [3H]leukotriene D4 (LTD4) for specific binding to cultured rat glomerular mesangial cells. Half-maximal inhibition was obtained with 100 nM LXA4, compared with 10 nM for unlabeled LTD4. At 10 and 50 nM LXA4 induced low, but significant, increases in mesangial-cell inositol trisphosphate generation: 48% and 44% increases as compared to vehicle controls, respectively (compared with 146% and 106% increments obtained for equimolar LTD4), which were abolished in the presence of 100-fold concentrations of the LTD4 receptor antagonist, SKF 104353. In addition, exposure to 100 nM LXA4 prevented mesangial cell inositol trisphosphate generation induced by 10 nM LTD4. To test the in vivo relevance of these results, we established a dose-response curve for the reducing effects of intrarenal arterial LTD4 on glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow in anesthetized rats (LTD4 doses were 0.5, 7.0, 14.0, and 20.0 micrograms/kg per min) without or with LXA4 at 1 microgram/kg per min. Mean percent decreases in glomerular filtration rate/renal plasma flow during LTD4 administration were 27*/24, 25*/40*, 70*/65*, and 73*/70* at the above doses, respectively (*P less than 0.05 versus baseline). With LXA4, these values were as follows: 9/20*, 11/37*, 42*/51*, and 50*/68*, the latter value representing a shift in the LTD4/glomerular filtration rate dose-response curve. Thus, LXA4 competes for [3H]LTD4 binding to mesangial cells, its presence prevents LTD4-induced inositol trisphosphate generation, and its own stimulation of mesangial-cell inositol trisphosphate is blocked by an LTD4 receptor antagonist. In vivo, LXA4 antagonizes LTD4-induced falls in glomerular filtration rate but not renal plasma flow, implying prevention of LTD4-mediated reductions in the glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient, a consequence of mesangial-cell contraction. These results suggest that LTD4 and LXA4 interact at a common site on rat mesangial cells at which LXA4 provokes partial agonist responses and competitively antagonizes both the cellular and physiological actions of LTD4. Moreover, these results provide evidence for a potential counterregulatory interaction between leukotrienes and lipoxins that may be relevant during glomerular inflammation.\r"

Gene constructs driven by the Amy-1a liver promoter thus provide a means of targeting gene expression to the adipocyte cell lineage in transgenic mice. Moreover the high frequency of metastases in the liver, lungs, spleen, heart, and adrenals of these mice provides an experimental system in which to study the development of disseminated malignancy.\r"

The amplitude of potassium increases in the vitreous humor was reduced to approximately 10 percent by 50 micromolar barium, while potassium increases in the inner plexiform layer were largely unchanged. The decrease in the vitreal potassium response was accurately simulated with a numerical model of potassium current flow through Muller cells, the principal glial cells of the retina. Barium also substantially increased the input resistance of Muller cells and blocked the Muller cell-generated M-wave, indicating that barium blocks the potassium channels of Muller cells. Thus, after a light-evoked potassium increase within the retina, there is a substantial transfer of potassium from the retina to the vitreous humor by potassium current flow through Muller cells.\r"

Identification of the region in these molecules that mediates the fusion events is important for understanding and possibly interfering with HIV/SIVmac infection and pathogenesis. Amino acid substitutions were made in the 15 NH2-terminal residues of the SIVmac gp32 transmembrane glycoprotein, and the mutants were expressed in recombinant vaccinia viruses, which were then used to infect CD4-expressing T cell lines. Mutations that increased the overall hydrophobicity of the gp32 NH2-terminus increased the ability of the viral envelope to induce syncytia formation, whereas introduction of polar or charged amino acids in the same region abolished the fusogenic function of the viral envelope. Hydrophobicity in the NH2-terminal region of gp32 may therefore be an important correlate of viral virulence in vivo and could perhaps be exploited to generate a more effective animal model for the study of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Seventeen single-photon emission CT (SPECT) studies were performed after intraperitoneal administration of 99mTc-sulfur colloid in patients with a history of colon cancer to assess the extent of intraperitoneal fluid distribution prior to intraperitoneal chemotherapy. Planar gamma images were also obtained in all patients for correlation with the SPECT findings. Four patients had transmission CT scans of the abdomen after intraperitoneal administration of iodinated contrast material. In seven patients, repeat planar and SPECT studies were performed with the original or a different infusion volume to determine if different volumes altered the fluid distribution qualitatively or quantitatively (using a linear profile method). We found that 360 degrees peritoneal SPECT is easily performed after intraperitoneal administration of 99mTc-sulfur colloid. SPECT provides more detailed anatomic information than planar scans do. Spaces of the upper abdomen, such as the lesser sac, were resolved better with SPECT than with planar imaging. SPECT assessment of intraperitoneal fluid distribution also correlated well with transmission CT scans. Quantitative linear-profile radionuclide plots were reproducible at the same volume and showed no major differences in relative intraperitoneal fluid distribution between the 1.5- and 3.0-l infusion volumes, suggesting that the two delivery volumes were equivalent in relative distribution. SPECT appears to be a useful procedure to define the extent and location of intraperitoneally administered fluids. Thus, it may be of value in determining the intraperitoneal distribution of drugs and radiopharmaceuticals used in the treatment of intraabdominal tumors.\r"

All study participants received an extensive evaluation that included brain CT at baseline and follow-up. Quantitation of ventricular size, using both linear and volume methods, revealed highly significant cross-sectional and longitudinal differences between the Alzheimer patients and control subjects. Specifically, the annual rate of change in ventricular volume was approximately 9% in the Alzheimer patients and approximately 2% in the controls. The presence of age-related white matter lesions had no effect on the clinical course of the patients or on the changes in ventricular size. Among the Alzheimer patients, the rate of clinical decline was strongly related to the rate of change in ventricular size. Baseline ventricular measurements were of no value in predicting the subsequent rate of clinical deterioration or ventricular enlargement. The results suggest that changes in ventricular size closely reflect the clinical changes in Alzheimer patients.\r"

Multivariate analyses showed that age, sex, smoking, alcohol use, marital status, and employment were associated with the levels of BMI and/or the sum of skinfold thicknesses. When three categories of BMI were compared, higher age-adjusted mean serum lipids, blood pressures, glucose, and glycosylated hemoglobin were observed in the obese subjects whereas total energy was decreased. Calorie-adjusted carbohydrate intake was higher in the obese subjects. BMI was an independent and significant predictor of both diabetic and hypertensive status. Obesity is a significant public health problem for Indians and poses particular risks for future chronic diseases.\r"

  ".W": "Monoclonal antibody Leu-22 represents an effective reagent for detection of neoplastic and nonneoplastic T-cells in paraffin sections of routinely processed tissues (242 specimens evaluated). In nonneoplastic tissues, immunoreactivity was localized mainly to lymphoid cells corresponding to a T-cell distribution. Immunoreactivity in lymphoid neoplasms, however, was preferentially, but not exclusively, limited to T-cell populations. Fifty-four of 60 T-cell neoplasms (90%) of various histologic types were Leu-22 positive. The pattern of immunoreactivity consisted mainly of membrane staining, with focal weak cytoplasmic positivity. Twenty-five of 67 B-cell neoplasms (37%) were also Leu-22 positive, with low-grade lymphomas (well/moderately well-differentiated lymphocytic types) representing most immunoreactive cases. In Hodgkin's disease, although most small lymphoid cells were Leu-22 positive, only rare Reed-Sternberg cells were immunoreactive. In all cases, histiocytes and myeloid cells exhibited variable immunoreactivity. The epitope identified by Leu-22 was detectable in formalin- and B5-fixed tissues but apparently was denatured after fixation in Zenker's-acetic acid solution used for bone marrow biopsies. Evaluation of a wide variety of nonhematopoietic neoplasms (64 total) revealed diffuse cytoplasmic staining in a few cases. However, membrane staining, typically noted for lymphoid cells, was not observed. Leu-22 potentially represents a useful marker for lymphoid cells, preferentially of T-cell origin, with optimal applicability as part of a panel that includes an effective pan-B-cell marker.\r"

We report the results of 120 patients with symptomatic internal and mixed hemorrhoid disease treated with direct current (d.c.) via a dual-tipped disposable needle probe (negative electrode). Evaluation and treatment utilized an operative anoscope which visualized one-eighth of the anal canal. Five hundred ninety segments revealed hemorrhoid disease (grade 1 = 114, 2 = 222, 3 = 178, 4 = 76). One or more segments (highest grade) were treated per office visit. Symptoms, frequency, and mean number of treatment applications per patient for complete symptom resolution were: bleeding, 85%, 4.0; protrusion, 58%, 3.9; pain, 52%, 3.6; and pruritus, 49%, 3.9. Ablation of hemorrhoid disease grade was directly correlated with milliampere current and time of application. No major complications occurred. All patients were successfully treated and remained symptom-free at a mean duration of follow-up of 23 months. Direct current electrotherapy is an effective, painless, and safe outpatient treatment approach to all grades of internal and mixed hemorrhoid disease.\r"

In the interstitium, monocytes/macrophages and T cells were the predominant cell types (210 +/- 27 and 171 +/- 25/mm2, respectively); in contrast, very few intraglomerular leucocytes, mostly macrophages (1.0 +/- 0.7 cell/glomerular cross-section), were found. Among the interstitial T-cell population, helper/inducer cells (CD4+) predominated (CD4:CD8 ratio, 2.2 +/- 1.5). Natural killer (NK) cells and B lymphocytes were a minor component of the interstitial infiltrates and were almost absent in the glomeruli. Significantly higher numbers of DR-expressing cells were found in the interstitium (322 +/- 20/mm2) than in controls (109 +/- 30), but tubular DR expression was similar to controls (17 +/- 12 mm2). The numbers of total leukocytes and their subsets CD4+, CD8+, monocytes/macrophages, and B cells all correlated with the degree of renal impairment at the time of biopsy, but surprisingly there was no correlation between interstitial cell numbers and the histological severity of tubulointerstitial lesions. Progressive renal impairment over 5 years was associated with many interstitial T cells and monocytes/macrophages in the initial biopsy. Our results suggest that interstitial mononuclear cells may be important determinants in the pathogenesis of MN. Both cellular and humoral immune mechanisms may play a major role in the initiation of the disease, whereas progression toward renal failure seems to be determined mainly by cell-mediated immunity.\r"

Responses were evaluated with and without carbidopa, which blocks peripheral conversion of 5-HTP to serotonin, and with and without indomethacin to assess the contribution of prostanoids. Both serotonin (0.25-1.0 micrograms) and 5-HTP (50-200 micrograms) decreased blood pressure and renal blood flow and increased renal vascular resistance in dose-dependent fashion. Hypotensive responses with both agents were greater after arterial injections into the aortic arch than after intravenous injections (into the jugular vein). Carbidopa had no significant effects on responses to serotonin but ablated the ability of 5-HTP to increase renal vascular resistance and decrease renal blood flow. Carbidopa did not alter the hypotensive action of 5-HTP. Indomethacin had no significant effect on responses to serotonin or 5-HTP. These results support a direct renal vasoconstrictor effect for exogenous and endogenously formed serotonin and a hypotensive effect probably arising in the central nervous system.\r"

This reagent selectively recognizes human benign and malignant intestinal T lymphocytes, but not benign or malignant lymph node T cells. In all cases, the majority of nonepithelium-associated T cells present in the corium were HML-1 negative. In the eight cases with marked epidermotropism, the intraepidermal (IED) T cells were HML-1 positive in three cases, and HML-1 negative in the remaining five cases. The HML-1 positive IED T cells tended to be localized preferentially in the basal layers, whereas the HML-1 negative IED T cells were more diffusely distributed throughout all epidermal cell layers or formed intra-epidermal aggregates. These findings provide further evidence that mycosis fungoides is not a single entity, but represents a group of neoplasms originating from different T cell subsets that have in common their tropism to epidermis and/or dermis, and thus have a similar clinical presentation.\r"

The measurements were taken to evaluate the effects of fentanyl-midazolam anaesthesia during normothermia and during hypothermic nonpulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass at 26 degrees C venous blood temperature, when a temperature-corrected PaCO2-value of 5.3 kPa was maintained. Anaesthesia with fentanyl 7 micrograms/kg and midazolam 200 micrograms/kg as induction doses, followed by infusions of fentanyl 0.15 micrograms/kg/minute and midazolam 3 micrograms/kg/minute, was characterised by a decrease in fast-wave activity and an increase in high-amplitude, slow-wave activity in the EEG. There was also a decrease in cerebral blood flow (38%), oxygen consumption (22%) and glucose consumption (25%), while lactate and pyruvate production remained unchanged. Hypothermia of 26 degrees C venous blood temperature suppressed EEG almost completely and decreased oxygen and glucose consumption by a further 61% and 54%, respectively, with no changes in lactate and pyruvate production while cerebral blood flow increased by 145%. These results show that the effects of fentanyl-midazolam anaesthesia on cerebral metabolism are enhanced during hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass while the influence of anaesthesia on cerebral blood flow is overshadowed by the practice of a temperature-corrected acid-base management.\r"

  ".W": "The quantitative relation between the concentration of local anesthetic (LA), the length of nerve exposed, and severity of conduction blockade was studied with use of a chamber where exposure length was varied as the concentration of lidocaine was held constant. Recordings of the compound action potential and of single axons established that small variations in the length of nerve exposed to LA strongly modulate conduction block even at exposure lengths in excess of 2 cm. Therefore, exposure length is a significant factor in determining blocking potency, and only at very high concentrations of LA, where voltage-dependent Na conductance is almost completely blocked, is the critical exposure length less than three nodes of Ranvier. The concentration required for 50% block of impulses in single fibers (that is, where 50% of the impulses would fail to propagate through the exposed region of the nerve) diminished as the exposed length of nerve increased, approximately halving as exposure length was changed from 6 mm to 15-25 mm. Conduction latency increased with the exposure length becoming sharply more variable as the critical exposure length for conduction block was approached. The results are consistent with the hypothesis of decremental conduction, where a partial active response in nodes exposed to marginal blocking concentrations extends the decay of the action potential along the axon, and do not support the interpretation that lengths of several centimeters affect blocking concentration because such distances increase the probability that three nodes will be blocked in succession. This study contradicts the broader common assumption that beyond three nodes, the length of nerve exposed is not a factor in nerve block with local anesthetics.\r"

All patients were on maintenance doses of calcium channel blockers and nitrates with the last doses of medications given the morning of operation. All patients were premedicated with flunitrazepam (2 mg orally), piritramide (7.5 mg IM) and promethazine (25 mg IM). Measurements were performed before the induction of anesthesia with the patients premedicated but awake; 20 min after induction of anesthesia with sufentanil plus pancuronium 0.1 mg.kg-1 for muscle relaxation before surgery; and during sternotomy and sternal spread.

Sixty-nine patients underwent intraoperative colonoscopy (84%), six had upper enteroscopy (7%), and seven had total gut endoscopy (9%). Indications were as follows: the inability to fully colonoscope preoperatively (29%), Crohn's disease (19%), malignant polypectomy site (12%), gastrointestinal bleeding (12%), routine screening to rule out synchronous lesions (12%), non palpable colonic lesions (11%), and miscellaneous (4%). Intraoperative endoscopy was successful in 89 per cent of patients. The exams provided information that altered the planned operation in 27 per cent of cases. There were four complications that may have been related to the endoscopic exams. All resolved without the need for further surgery. It is concluded that intraoperative endoscopy can greatly influence the operation performed in a significant percentage of cases. The clear cut indications for its use at this time are location of malignant polypectomy sites, adhesions or tortuous colon that prevents complete preoperative colonoscopy, chronic gastrointestinal bleeding, and location of non palpable bowel lesions. Controversial indications that we feel will prove useful include Crohn's disease and acute gastrointestinal bleeding. Intraoperative endoscopy is best used as an adjunct to preoperative endoscopy and not as a substitute for it.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine if patients initially identified by history, clinical examination, and serologic status as having asymptomatic herpes simplex virus type 2 infection report clinically recognizable genital lesions after having a detailed instructional session on the clinical signs and symptoms of genital herpes. DESIGN: Prospective follow-up of two groups of women. SETTING: Outpatient clinic of an urban city-county hospital. PATIENTS: Two populations of women were recruited. One group was referred because they had documented asymptomatic genital herpes or were suspected of asymptomatically transmitting genital herpes to a sex partner. The other group was recruited from the hospital's general gynecologic clinic and consisted of women with herpes simplex virus type 2 antibodies who denied a history of genital herpes. INTERVENTION: Patients had a one-on-one interview describing the clinical symptoms of genital herpes. MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS: Twelve of nineteen women with herpes simplex virus type 2 antibodies who had documented asymptomatic genital herpes or were suspected of asymptomatically transmitting infection to a sex partner, and 18 of 43 women with herpes simplex virus type 2 antibodies who were recruited from the gynecologic clinic developed clinically recognizable genital lesions during a 5-month follow-up. Symptomatic genital herpes was the most frequent gynecologic complaint identified during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 50% of women with herpes simplex virus type 2 antibodies who do not initially report a history of genital lesions do indeed have clinically symptomatic genital herpes. These women can be accurately counseled and taught to distinguish genital herpes from other genitourinary infections. Identification of symptomatic recurrences and counseling to avoid sexual activity during these episodes may help reduce transmission of genital herpes.\r"

The most frequently recovered isolates were Peptostreptococcus sp, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides sp, Fusobacterium, and enteric gram-negative rods. Twenty-two isolates recovered from 17 wounds (71%) produced beta-lactamase. These included all five isolates of S aureus and nine of 17 (53%) of the Bacteroides melaninogenicus group. The polymicrobial aerobic/anaerobic nature of postoperative wound infections after head and neck cancer surgery and the presence of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria may have important implications for the management of these infections.\r"

  ".W": "The metabolism and mode of action of 9-(4-hydroxy-3-hydroxymethylbut-1-yl)guanine (BRL 39123) were studied in herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1)-infected and uninfected MRC-5 cells and compared with those of acyclovir. In uninfected cells incubated with 10 microM acyclonucleoside for 4 h, no phosphorylation of either BRL 39123 or acyclovir was detected. In contrast, in HSV-1-infected cells, both BRL 39123 and acyclovir were phosphorylated up to the triphosphate esters. Phosphorylation of BRL 39123 occurred much more rapidly and proceeded to a greater extent than did that of acyclovir. Furthermore, following the removal of acyclonucleoside from the culture medium, the intracellular triphosphate ester of BRL 39123 was much more stable than was that of acyclovir, the half-lives being about 10 and 0.7 h, respectively. BRL 39123 treatment effectively inhibited the formation of HSV-1 DNA in infected MRC-5 cells, 50% inhibitory concentrations of BRL 39123 and acyclovir being 0.04 microgram/ml (0.16 microM) and 0.15 microgram/ml (0.67 microM), respectively. In addition, BRL 39123 was shown to be more effective than acyclovir at inhibiting viral DNA synthesis following short treatment times, presumably reflecting the greater stability of BRL 39123 triphosphate. Neither BRL 39123 nor acyclovir inhibited cellular DNA synthesis in uninfected cells at concentrations of up to 100 micrograms/ml.\r"

Anti-infective drug use in the 2-week period before the onset of illness was compared between 251 patients admitted to hospital with agranulocytosis and 1271 controls hospitalized for reasons judged to be unrelated to previous use of anti-infective drugs. Anti-infectives significantly associated with agranulocytosis when used for at least 3 consecutive days were trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (relative risk, 12; 95% confidence interval, 3.9 to 40) and macrolides (infinity). The relative risk estimate for any use of sulfonamides without trimethoprim was elevated, but not statistically significant (3.6; 0.7 to 18). These estimates took confounding by various factors, in particular the use of other drugs, into account. The estimated excess risks of agranulocytosis attributable to the use of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and macrolides in a 2-week period were 1.6 and 7.1 per million, respectively. Anti-infective use during the 29- through 180-day period before hospital admission was compared between 135 patients with aplastic anemia and 1410 controls. Although relative risk point estimates were elevated for trimethoprim/sulfonamides (2.1), other sulfonamides (2.9), and beta-lactams (1.5), none was statistically significant.\r"

Although the silicone oil itself remained clear and without emulsification, the differential diagnosis of this postoperative inflammation included microbial endophthalmitis. These two cases were treated with frequent topical steroids and antibiotics while we closely monitored the retraction of the anterior chamber fibrin. In both cases, clinical improvement and long-term retinal reattachment with satisfactory visual function were achieved. The use of intense scatter laser endophotocoagulation and the presence of impurities in the silicone oil may have contributed to the excessive postoperative inflammation in these cases.\r"

Markedly elevated antibody levels (greater than 4 SD above the normal mean) were observed almost exclusively in sera of patients with SLE. Levels of antibodies to the collagen-like region correlated highly with levels of solid-phase C1q-binding IgG when analyzed by the C1q solid-phase assay for immune complexes (r = 0.87). We previously found that, after sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation, a predominance of the solid-phase C1q-binding IgG in SLE sera sediments as monomeric IgG. These findings, together with the present data, indicate that reactivity of SLE patients' sera in the C1q solid-phase assay reflects primarily the presence of antibodies to the collagen-like region, and not the presence of immune complexes.\r"

We used this cell line to investigate the involvement of IL-6 production in type II collagen-induced arthritis in DBA/1 mice. Only marginal IL-6 activity was detected in sera from DBA/1 mice inoculated with Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA) alone, with an unrelated protein (bovine serum albumin) plus FCA, or with type II collagen plus Freund's incomplete adjuvant. However, enhanced IL-6 activity was observed in DBA/1 mice that had been injected with type II collagen plus FCA to induce arthritis. The elevated level of serum IL-6 activity was associated with high levels of IL-6 produced when lymph node cells from arthritic mice were stimulated in vitro with type II collagen. We also found that the L3T4+ T cell subset is responsible for the enhanced production of IL-6 in arthritic mice. The results are discussed in the context of potential roles of IL-6 in the induction and/or expression of chronic, progressive arthritis.\r"

Thereafter, the rate of PG depletion declined, and by day 42, the maximum loss was 55-60%. The initial loss of PG was accompanied by the appearance of large amounts of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the joint fluid (measured as total sulfated GAGs by dye binding and as keratan sulfate by radioimmunoassay). However, by day 14, the levels of sulfated GAGs in arthritic joint fluid declined to control levels, even though the cartilage demonstrated a sustained depletion of PG. The cartilage PG degradation observed in antigen-induced arthritis could also be produced in normal animals by a single intraarticular injection of recombinant interleukin-1. The acute loss of cartilage PG occurred independently of neutrophil accumulation, both in the case of antigen-induced arthritis and after injection of interleukin-1.\r"

  ".W": "This paper provides basic epidemiological data on smoking and drinking patterns before pregnancy amongst 1117 pregnant women attending a London antenatal clinic. Similar data are already available from North America and surveys have been done in Scotland but there is a dearth of information from England and Wales. In the early stages of pregnancy, prior to recognition, heavy alcohol consumption (in excess of 56 units of alcohol per week) is associated with the Foetal Alcohol Syndrome. More moderate levels of intake (as little as 10 units of alcohol per week) have been associated with Foetal Alcohol Effects such as growth retardation. In our sample 19% of the mothers were drinking more than 10 units of alcohol per week. Six per cent were consuming more than the 14 units of alcohol currently recommended by three of the medical Royal Colleges as 'safe' for non-pregnant women. Average weekly alcohol consumption was related to both the usual frequency and amount drunk, but also to binge drinking, beverage choice and combination, and reasons for drinking. In general, drinking was frequent and light. Those women who drank more per week tended to drink more frequently than those in the lower weekly consumption bands. Fourteen per cent of the sample admitted to binge drinking (more than 14 units of alcohol in a single sitting). Wine was the most popular beverage type. The range of beverages consumed was wider in the higher alcohol consumption bands. Those in the lower bands were more likely to drink only one beverage type. Social reasons for drinking were of far greater importance than reasons which emphasised the effects of drinking. However, heavy drinkers were unlikely to drink solely for social reasons. Seventy-seven per cent of the mothers were non-smokers, but the incidence of smoking increased in the higher alcohol consumption bands. The demographic characteristics of the smokers were in marked contrast to those of the heavier drinkers. Smokers tended to be younger, of lower social status and multiparous, whereas the heavier drinkers were more likely to be older, of higher social status and primiparous. This finding is of fundamental importance to those interested in planning screening or intervention programmes.\r"

Only 12% of mothers were non-drinkers before pregnancy, but 44% abstained in the first trimester, 38% in the second and 50% in the third. Before pregnancy 20% of mothers were drinking more than the recommended 10 units of alcohol per week. This dropped to 6% during pregnancy. Mean consumption at each of the three stages of pregnancy was highest amongst those mothers who were the heaviest drinkers before pregnancy. The heaviest pre-pregnancy drinkers were also the least likely to abstain at any point in pregnancy. Of those mothers who were drinking less than 10 units of alcohol per week before pregnancy, 3% increased during pregnancy. Wine was the most popular beverage choice but heavier drinkers were more likely to drink beers and spirits in addition. Before pregnancy 29% of mothers smoked. This dropped to 23% in pregnancy. Consumption levels fell amongst those who continued smoking. The heaviest pre-pregnancy smokers were the most likely to reduce but the least likely to stop. Smoking was positively associated with the level of both pre-pregnancy and pregnancy drinking. The most commonly cited reasons for changes in drinking and smoking habits in pregnancy were concern for the child, concern for self or concern for both. Feeling sick or ill was a more commonly stated reason for reduction of drinking than smoking. Social pressures were important in reducing smoking, but the mass media were quoted as a more important influence in reducing drinking. Mothers who drank more than 10 units of alcohol per week during pregnancy were more likely to be older, of higher social status and primiparous. In contrast those who smoked in pregnancy were more likely to be younger, of lower social status and multiparous. This has important implications for planning antenatal health education.\r"

  ".W": "Lymphokine-activated killer cells are thought to be important mediators of host tumor defense. In the present study, the cytotoxic potential of lymphokine-activated lymphocytes against different head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines was investigated. Lymphokine-activated killer cells were derived from peripheral blood lymphocytes. Effector peripheral blood lymphocyte cell suspensions were incubated in the presence or absence of recombinant interleukin-2. Cytotoxicity of incubated cells or fresh peripheral blood lymphocytes was determined in a 3-hour chromium 51 release assay. Target cell lines included K562 (a natural killer-sensitive target) and the following head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines: Cal 27, UMSCC-1, UMSCC-8, UMSCC-16, UMSCC-19, and UMSCC-22a. Fresh peripheral blood lymphocytes and peripheral blood lymphocytes cultured in the absence of added interleukin-2 demonstrated minimal cytotoxic effects against the squamous cell carcinoma targets. In contrast, these fresh and incubated lymphocytes showed significant cytotoxic effects against K562. Cells preincubated in the presence of interleukin-2 demonstrated a statistically significant increase in cytotoxic effects against K562 and all squamous cell carcinoma targets. These investigations support the possible role of lymphokine-activated killer cells in host defense against squamous cell carcinoma. In vitro natural killer cell activity against head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines is low; however, significant lymphokine-activated killer cell cytotoxicity is present.\r"

  ".W": "The immune responses produced by four macaques inoculated intradermally with a recombinant vaccinia virus that expresses the envelope gene of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were analyzed. Antibody capable of immunoprecipitating the glycosylated envelope protein precursor gp160 was detected in all animals within 3 weeks after the primary intradermal vaccination. The level of antibody was increased following a booster inoculation, and the sera from three of the four animals were then capable of immunoprecipitating gp120. Sera from two of the macaques with anti-gp120 antibody were able to prevent syncytium formation mediated by the parent HIV but not that induced by an unrelated HIV isolate. The fusion-inhibiting antibody was directed toward the highly variable central portion of the gp120 molecule since the effect was abrogated by incubation with PB1. The latter is a recombinant protein produced in Escherichia coli containing amino acids 295-474, a major neutralizing epitope. Sera from the three macaques with anti-gp120 neutralized HIV infectivity in an isolate-specific manner. The serum with highest neutralizing activity was also best at inhibiting syncytium formation. In contrast to the isolate-specific nature of the neutralizing antibody, T lymphocytes from immunized animals proliferated in response to divergent HIV isolates as well as to purified gp120. These studies provide baseline immunologic information for further development of recombinant vaccinia virus vectors.\r"

  ".W": "The only animal that can be reproducibly infected with HIV, and that thus provides an experimental system for testing the effectiveness of prototype vaccines, is the chimpanzee. We compared proliferative responses to HIV and to vaccinia virus (VV) antigens of lymphocytes taken at various times from chimpanzees vaccinated with recombinant VV expressing different HIV genes. Animals were immunized with the original VV strain, as control, or with constructs expressing gp160 (VV160) given exclusively or in combination with one or two other constructs producing p25 (VV25), F/3'-orf (VVF), or the human interleukin-2 (IL-2) gene, which was included in an attempt to amplify immune responses. Irrespective of the HIV gene utilized, lymphocyte proliferation to HIV was usually weak and rapidly decreased after each inoculation, contrasting with strong and sustained responses to VV. Lack of adequate recall reactivity after challenge with fixed autologous lymphocytes expressing VV-produced HIV antigens indicated that vaccination resulted only in low levels of HIV-specific memory cell priming. The use of IL-2-producing VV did not lead to increased responsiveness. Reactivity to soluble purified gp160, but not to p25, could be detected in PBL from animals that had received both VV160 and VV25, while immunization with VVF resulted in a significant response to this protein in one of two animals. The transient nature of T cell reactivity to HIV might explain why, in similar studies, chimpanzees were not protected from infection with live HIV.\r"

  ".W": "Three-dimensional computer models for two segments of the C terminus of gp41, the transmembrane AIDS envelope protein, which may form amphipathic alpha-helices, have been generated using structure prediction techniques combined with energy minimization and molecular dynamics simulations. Regions gp41(772-790) and gp41(828-848) of the HXB2 strain of HIV-1 display extraordinarily high hydrophobic moment maxima as alpha-helices and when in an antiparallel conformation exhibit charge complementarity, implying that they may bind with each other and associate with the membrane. The feasibility of this hypothesis was tested in a series of computer simulations of these peptides, extended by several residues to include additional charge pairing. Beginning with a trial structure in the form of antiparallel alpha-helices of segments 770-794 and 824-856, systematic axial rotations and displacements were used to generate alternative initial states. Molecular dynamics simulations with alpha-helical torsional restraints yielded several approximately cylindrical dimeric structures highly stabilized by numerous salt links and other hydrogen bonds. This suggests that these two regions may fold back on each other in antiparallel fashion to form a loop in the tertiary structure over residues 770-856, with the loop closed by membrane-associated amphipathic alpha-helices with charged sides facing each other. We speculate that such structures could aggregate to form channels or otherwise destabilize the membrane, thereby contributing to the cytopathic effects of the gp120-gp41 complex.\r"

Selective visceral angiography demonstrated the bleeding lesions in 24 of the 30 patients who underwent this investigation. Six of these 24 patients, however, had a negative angiogram initially and the lesions were only demonstrated on a repeat angiogram. The negative initial angiograms were due to: (1) slow bleeding from lesions in two patients; (2) a small bleeding tumour that caused only intermittent jejunojejunal intussusception in one patient; (3) technical fault in one patient; and (4) spasm of the bleeding vascular lesions and their feeding arteries in two patients. We advocate repeat angiography the following day in all patients in whom profuse bleeding continues, and during the next intestinal bleeding in those whose bleeding stops after the initial negative angiography. In patients who have repeated episodes of massive bleeding, and in whom full investigations fail to reveal the bleeding source, repeat angiography carried out 4 weeks after the bleeding has stopped can sometimes demonstrate the vascular lesions.\r"

  ".W": "The admission rates for duodenal ulcer (DU) and the effect of H2-receptor antagonists (H2RA), introduced in the Trent Region of the UK in 1977, were examined. The admission rates are expressed per 10(6) of resident population. The use of H2RA has risen 3.7-fold (from 1978 to 1983), yet overall admission rates for perforation have changed little: 99 in 1972-76 (pre-H2RA period) compared with 103 in 1977-84 (H2RA period). Admission rates for haemorrhage have risen by 8 per cent, from 130 to 140 (P less than 0.01). However, the overall rates conceal large increases (P less than 0.01) in the admission rates for those aged greater than or equal to 65 years, of 33 per cent (from 264 to 352) for perforation and of 28 per cent (from 381 to 489) for haemorrhage. Emergency admissions for uncomplicated DU were unchanged: 88 in 1972-76 and 89 in 1977-84. However, the proportions operated on fell by 58 per cent (P less than 0.01), from 30 per cent of admissions in the pre-H2RA period compared with only 12 per cent in the H2RA period. Waiting-list admissions for uncomplicated DU fell by 43 per cent, from 187 to 106 (P less than 0.01), and the proportions operated on fell from 162 to 76; the combined effect resulted in a reduction of 53 per cent in the operation rates (P less than 0.01). In Rotherham, the use of H2RA has risen 6.2-fold (from 1978 to 1983) and they were generally used intermittently in 1976-78 and later for maintenance therapy and high-dose treatment. Yet admissions for perforation and for haemorrhage were unchanged. Emergency admissions for uncomplicated DU rose by 40 per cent, from 130 in 1972-75 to 182 in 1976-84, but the proportions operated on fell markedly, from 20 to 6 per cent (P less than 0.01); waiting-list admissions fell in 1976-78 by 29 per cent and in 1979-84 by 73 per cent. The proportions operated on in the three periods fell from 74 to 53 per cent and 25 per cent respectively and these two factors led to decreases in elective surgery of 50 per cent in 1976-78 and 91 per cent in 1979-84 (P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Red cells were labelled in vivo with technetium-99m pertechnetate and serial scans (0-36 h) were taken using a large field gamma camera. Twenty-two men and 15 women, mean age 71.3 years (range 32-91 years), and four children were studied. Forty-three scans were performed in all and there were 31 positive and 12 negative results. In each case the accuracy of the scan in localizing the bleeding site was checked either by independent investigations or at laparotomy. A definite bleeding site was identified in 30 cases and red cell scintigraphy correctly localized 29 of these (sensitivity 97 per cent). In the remaining 13 cases a bleeding site was not identified by any of the independent investigations and in this group there were two false positive scans (specificity 85 per cent). The investigation had a high predictive value when both positive (94 per cent) and negative (92 per cent). These data suggest that technetium-99m-labelled red cell scintigraphy should be used more widely in the investigation of patients with suspected lower gastrointestinal haemorrhage.\r"

Forty-five operations were carried out in patients in whom the diagnosis of von Willebrand's disease was known at the time of surgery. In these patients, the following haemostatic preparations were given: factor concentrate, fresh plasma, tranexamic acid and desmopressin. Haemostatic complications occurred in three of these operations (6.7 per cent); all were managed easily. No mortality was observed. It is concluded that patients with von Willebrand's disease do not carry an increased operative risk if appropriate precautions are taken.\r"

Histologic evidence of inflammation was present in 98% of the culture-positive subjects. Linear regression analysis revealed that the prevalence of C. pylori colonization increased with age. There was no difference in the isolation rate between the two groups when adjusted for age. Four of the six culture-positive volunteers underwent repeat endoscopy and gastric biopsy 1 year later; despite remaining asymptomatic, all still had positive culture results and histologic evidence of gastritis. We conclude that the prevalence of C. pylori-associated gastritis among symptomatic patients increases with age and that the organism may be present in the gastrointestinal tract for prolonged periods without symptoms or evidence of disease progression.\r"

Sixty-four percent of bone marrow cells were replaced with lymphoblasts, and they expressed B-lineage markers (CD19 and HLA/DR). Southern blot analysis demonstrated immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangements (two rearranged and one germline) with the germline configuration of the T-cell receptor beta chain gene. Ten months later he relapsed with blasts of M5 morphologic type and a myeloid phenotype with the germline configuration of the immunoglobulin genes. During the next 2 months, myeloid blasts with immunoglobulin gene rearrangement which was identically rearranged with one of the two rearranged bands detected at diagnosis appeared. The most likely explanation for these findings is that initially the patient seemed to have at least two different clones of blasts, and clonal selections occurred during the treatments.\r"

Simultaneously, epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors (EGF-R) and cytosolic estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and EGF-like activity were determined. All tumors assayed contained a single class of specific iodine 125 (125I)-IGF-1 binding sites (Kd: median 106, range 48-755 pM; n = 32) with limited capacity (Bmax: median 147, range 19-11,900 fmol/mg membrane protein). Seventy percent of 44 tumors (50% ER+, PR+), displayed specific 125I-EGF binding with a wide range of values (median 13, range 2-215 fmol/mg protein, n = 31). A positive relationship was apparent between the amount of IGF-1-R with ER and PR (Spearman; 2P less than 0.02 and 2P less than 0.01, respectively; n = 32), whereas for EGF-R a negative relationship was observed (for both 2P less than 0.01; n = 44). All tumors contained endogeneous IGF-1-like and EGF-like activities as measured by radioreceptor assay on acid-ethanol extracted cytosols (median 15, range 3-131 ng/mg protein, n = 78 for IGF-1; and median 86, range 26-517 ng/mg protein, n = 142 for EGF). Tumor contents of IGF-1-like and EGF-like activities showed a negative relationship with ER (2P less than 0.1 for IGF-1, n = 78; and 2P less than 0.001 for EGF, n = 142), and with PR (2P less than 0.05, n = 78; and 2P less than 0.001, n = 142). No relationship was observed between the tumor contents of IGF-1-like and EGF-like activities. In conclusion, these data support the view that IGF-1 and EGF can act as autocrine or paracrine growth factors in human breast cancer.\r"

French-American-British (FAB) types included four M2, one M3, ten M4, and three M5. Lysozyme was more consistently detectable in skin sections in our cases than Leu-M1, alpha-1-antitrypsin, alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, or chloroacetate esterase activity. Additional extramedullary sites of involvement were present in 16 patients, including meningeal leukemia in six. Two patients had leukemia cutis preceding bone marrow leukemia. Skin was the initial site of relapse in 11 patients, without marrow relapse, occurring as late as 5.5 years after diagnosis. Most patients in this retrospective series were treated with radiation therapy and/or palliative chemotherapy, and did poorly, with prompt bone marrow relapses and serial skin relapses. Long-term disease-free survival was achieved in the one patient whose skin relapse was treated with whole-body electron-beam radiation therapy in conjunction with reinduction and consolidation chemotherapy. Severe skin toxicity was caused by administration of Adriamycin (doxorubicin) 12 days after electron-beam irradiation in one patient, but was not seen when cytosine arabinoside was administered in doses up to 3 g/m2 in conjunction with radiation therapy. This retrospective review suggests that optimal management of AML involving skin might include whole-body electron-beam irradiation in conjunction with induction or reinduction chemotherapy without anthracyclines, followed by consolidation chemotherapy. Additionally, there should be ongoing surveillance for and treatment of extramedullary disease at other sites, including the meninges.\r"

Children with carcinomas of the thyroid and female genital tract have an excellent prognosis with 5-year survival rates of over 90%. The prognosis for other sites was generally less favorable; 60% of children with nasopharyngeal tumors were alive at 5 years from diagnosis but less than 20% of those with carcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract or the adrenal cortex.\r"

Among the asymptomatic patients, 47% received medical and 49% received surgical treatment. In the symptomatic group, 20% received medical and 78% received surgical therapy. The survival rate 5 years after surgery for treatment of left main coronary artery stenosis was 84% for the symptomatic patients and 88% for the asymptomatic patients (p = NS). Medical management of left main coronary artery disease produced a 5-year survival rate of 57% for asymptomatic patients and 58% for symptomatic patients. Within the asymptomatic subgroup, 88% of those surgically treated survived 5 years, whereas only 57% of those medically treated survived 5 years (p = 0.02). Thus, for CASS patients with left main coronary artery disease, the percentage of those that were asymptomatic is low (3.6%); asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with left main coronary artery disease had no significant difference in severity of left main coronary artery stenosis, extent of overall coronary artery disease, or left ventricular function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These levels included the sum of free and bound forms of homocysteine, its disulfide oxidation product, homocystine, and the homocysteine-cysteine-mixed disulfide. Two groups of subjects were studied: apparently healthy individuals (n = 103) and patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) (n = 47). Because age in PAOD patients was higher than in control subjects, the control subjects were subdivided into younger and older groups (aged 60 years or less and more than 60 years, respectively). The H(e) levels in the younger groups were 11.18 +/- 3.58 (mean +/- SD, expressed as homocysteine) and 8.58 +/- 2.82 nmol/ml in men and women, respectively; in the older groups, the levels were 10.74 +/- 2.16 and 9.04 +/- 2.16 nmol/ml in men and women, respectively. There was a positive correlation of H(e) levels with age in the younger control women (r = 0.373; p less than 0.02); no significant correlations were present in the other three control groups. Levels of H(e) in PAOD patients (15.44 +/- 5.76 and 17.04 +/- 8.26 nmol/ml in men and women, respectively) were significantly higher than those indicated above in the older controls. Next, the PAOD patients were assigned to two subgroups: 1) those with normal levels of H(e) (within two standard deviations of the mean of the control values) and 2) those with elevated levels of H(e). Age, cholesterolemia, and the prevalence of smoking and diabetes were similar in both subgroups. These results suggest that elevated plasma H(e) is an independent risk factor for arterial occlusive disease.\r"

We randomized 20 patients with right coronary artery lesions to receive cold blood cardioplegia solution either retrograde through the right atrium (group 1, n = 10) or antegradely (group 2, n = 10). The patients were similar in age, sex, severity of coronary artery disease, cross-clamp time, and completeness of revascularization. Before operation, right ventricular function was assessed by radionuclide ventriculography, and 18-24 hours after operation, right ventricular volumes and performance were assessed at a constant-paced heart rate by simultaneous hemodynamic-radionuclide measurements, before and after a fluid challenge. Intraoperative right ventricular temperatures were not different between the groups. Right ventricular volumes and ejection fractions were not different at baseline. After operation, at similar heart rates and loading conditions, there was a trend for the antegrade group to increase right ventricular end-systolic volume (p less than 0.1) whereas the retrograde group had no change in this parameter from the preoperative state. Postoperative ventricular function curves (p = NS, retrograde versus antegrade) suggest equivalent systolic performance in both groups. Right ventricular diastolic performance showed no significant differences between the two groups, suggesting no detriment to compliance due to right ventricular distension during operation. This suggests that retrograde cardioplegia adequately protects the right ventricular myocardium during bypass surgery and may be used as an alternative procedure in situations where ventricular cooling is inadequate with antegrade delivery due to severe coronary artery disease or aortic valvular disease.\r"

  ".W": "We tested the hypothesis that 99mTc 2-methoxy-isobutyl-isonitrile (99mTc MIBI), a new radiopharmaceutical for myocardial perfusion imaging, provides accurate noninvasive detection of coronary artery disease (CAD). Imaging in patients after exercise and at rest with 99mTc MIBI was compared with imaging after exercise and redistribution with 201Tl in 12 normal subjects and 38 patients with angiographic documentation of CAD (greater than or equal to 50% diameter stenosis). We used single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and computer quantitation of regional tracer distribution. The quality of reconstructed images with 99mTc MIBI judged visually was superior to that of 201Tl in 88% of all studies performed and was comparable in the others. With the limits of normal as 2.5 SD below the mean of gender-matched normal volunteers, 201Tl SPECT identified 32 and 99mTc MIBI identified 36 patients with CAD (p = 0.2). 201Tl SPECT identified 45 of 75 (60%) and 99mTc MIBI identified 59 of 75 (79%) stenosed coronary arteries (p less than 0.05). The quantitative severity of perfusion defects was similar for the two tracers. 201Tl SPECT identified 104 reversibly ischemic myocardial segments compared with 134 with 99mTc MIBI (p less than 0.05). Thus, SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging with 99mTc MIBI and computer quantitation provides an accurate method for the noninvasive detection of significant coronary artery disease. Furthermore, image quality is generally superior to 201Tl, and reversibly ischemic myocardial segments may be better identified with 99mTc MIBI.\r"

The study population consisted of 316 patients from 1980 to 1986; 202 patients (64%) had emergency coronary artery bypass graft surgery and the remainder elective surgery during the same hospitalization. Mean age of the population was 56 +/- 9 years, 69% were male, and 69% had single-vessel disease. The failed percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty occurred most commonly on the first vessel attempted and was usually secondary to coronary artery dissection. Analysis of surgical technique revealed increased use of intra-aortic balloon pump in the emergency group (24% vs. 2% in the elective group, p less than 0.05). Overall, 2.0 +/- 1.0 (mean +/- SD) bypass grafts were placed, with increased use of the internal thoracic artery in the elective (32%) versus the emergency group (20%, p less than 0.05). A new, nonfatal, postprocedural Q-wave myocardial infarction occurred in 18% and developed more frequently in the emergency (27%) than in the elective (4%) cohorts. There were six in-hospital deaths (1.9%), an incidence which did not differ between groups. This analysis revealed a significant difference in operative technique between the emergency and the elective coronary artery bypass graft patients. Preoperative ischemia was significantly related to the development of the Q-wave myocardial infarction, yet not to in-hospital mortality.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Overall, there was a decline in the hospital discharge rate for all causes since 1983. However, the number of discharges with first-listed coronary artery-related diagnoses increased between 1984 and 1986. For men, the estimated number of these discharges increased from 1,161,000 to 1,323,000. For both sexes, there was a decrease for chronic ischemic heart disease; however, the number of discharges for unstable angina pectoris doubled over this period. It is uncertain whether this reflects an increase in disease or is the result of reimbursement policies affecting diagnosis. For both unstable and stable angina pectoris, there was a reversal of the male-female ratio at older ages, with larger numbers of older women than men discharged with these diagnoses. The discharge rates for all-listed acute myocardial infarction remained relatively constant over the past 7 years. However, the average length of stay decreased. Dysrhythmias and heart failure were the most frequent complications listed. The number of coronary artery bypass graft surgery discharges increased from 114,000 in 1979 to 228,000 in 1986. The increase in coronary angioplasty is noteworthy, rising from 2,000 to 133,000 in the same period. For both procedures, the most frequently associated diagnosis was chronic ischemic heart disease. Further monitoring of hospital discharge trends for coronary heart disease and related procedures is indicated.\r"

Actuarial survival was 92% at 1 month and 79% at 1 year. The hazard function for death was highest immediately after operation, had a single phase of decline, and reached a low level only after about 4 months. Risk factors for death included older age at operation, preoperative hemodynamic instability, left main coronary artery disease, ischemic mitral valve disease, important tricuspid valve incompetence, and longer ischemic time. The adverse effect of hemodynamic instability at time of surgery was most pronounced in the elderly (age 70 years or more, 20% 30-day mortality). A favorable risk group includes patients under 70 years of age without left main stenosis, hemodynamic instability, or ischemic mitral valve disease; the 30-day mortality for this subset undergoing isolated valve surgery and CABG is less than 5%. A proper comparison of surgical therapy in differing patient subsets with combined valvular and coronary artery disease should include multivariate analysis in which nondichotomous variables are examined in a continuous manner rather than establishing arbitrary stratifications.\r"

This practice pattern has resulted in a dramatic increase in patient age and disease complexity in those currently referred for coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Since 1980, PTCA success rates have improved and complications decreased due to operator experience and technical innovation. Long-term follow-up studies of patients initially treated with PTCA have documented excellent survival in those with single-vessel disease and milder forms of multiple-vessel disease. The application of PTCA as an initial revascularization strategy in patients with more diffuse and complex multiple-vessel disease is not known and awaits the results of ongoing prospective randomized trials.\r"

  ".W": "The internal thoracic artery has emerged as the coronary bypass graft of choice. Initially it was favored because of proximity to the anterior descending artery, little discrepancy in size between graft and recipient vessels, and high early patency rate. Later investigation showed relative freedom from arterial degeneration. In contrast to the 40-60% patency rate for vein grafts at 10-12 years postoperatively, the arterial graft patency exceeds 90%. Theories about protection from atherosclerosis are now directed toward vasoactive properties of the arterial wall. Exercise scintigraphic studies indicate that flow from a thoracic artery graft to the anterior descending artery relieves ischemia at peak myocardial demand. As expected, an arterial conduit that provides consistently high long-term patency also significantly improves 10-year survival in patients with one-, two-, or three-vessel disease. This extended longevity applies to patients with normal and abnormal left ventricular function. Late myocardial infarction, reoperation, and hospitalization for cardiac causes are significantly reduced by performance of an internal thoracic artery graft to the anterior descending coronary artery. These results have stimulated greater usage of these arterial grafts as bilateral, free, and sequential anastomoses. Preliminary reports indicate that patency related to expanded use is similar to that obtained with an in situ left thoracic artery graft. Indications and relative contraindications to arterial grafting in context of these current findings are discussed in this overview.\r"

In a recent 3-year interval (1985-1987), 240 patients underwent CABG within 30 days of a documented myocardial infarction. Thirty-day mortality was 3.3% (eight patients). Twenty variables were examined by univariate and multivariate analysis for their effects on early mortality. Left main coronary artery disease (p = 0.0003), female sex (p = 0.0059), and preoperative left ventricular dysfunction (increased left ventricular wall motion score) (p = 0.0135) were significant independent predictors of increased 30-day mortality. Postoperative inotropic support for low cardiac output was required for 55.6% of patients operated upon within 24 hours of infarction as compared with 11.6% of patients operated upon between 1 and 30 days (p less than 0.01). Significantly more patients undergoing emergent CABG required postoperative intra-aortic balloon pumping and inotropic support than those patients who underwent urgent or elective operation (23.8% vs. 4.6% and 52.4% vs. 10%, respectively) (p less than 0.01). Other studies confirm that preoperative left ventricular dysfunction, presence of cardiogenic shock, or intra-aortic balloon pumping are important predictors of operative risk. Other variables that may be important include advanced age, female sex, left main coronary artery disease, and anterior transmural infarction. The timing and urgency of operation have not been shown to be significant and independent determinants of increased operative risk.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Age, surgical priority, prior CABG surgery, congestive heart failure (CHF), and type of AMI were associated with increased hospital mortality by logistic regression analysis of nine independent variables. When the analysis was carried out separately for men and women, the same predictive variables were identified for men, but only surgical priority and age were predictive of operative mortality for women. Elective CABG surgery can be carried out at low risk following AMI in stable patients regardless of the interval between AMI and surgery. Patients who undergo urgent or emergency surgery and those who have CHF, Q wave infarction, or a history of prior AMI are at increased risk.\r"

In addition to commonly monitored hemodynamic variables, right ventricular (RV) ejection fraction (EF) was measured by thermodilution technique using a new fast-response thermodilution catheter. In eight patients with concomitant severe stenosis (greater than 89%) of the right coronary artery (RCA), volume loading was followed by a decreased RVEF and cardiac output. In contrast, RVEF in the 17 patients without diseased RCA increased significantly, with an increase in cardiac output. Duration of aortic cross-clamping (i.e., ischemia) was more pronounced in the group with decreased RVEF due to RCA grafting. Increased end-diastolic volume and decreased RV contractility index indicated that patients with myocardial ischemia during cardiac surgery procedures sometimes were unable to make the adaptations required. We conclude that cardiocirculatory dysfunction associated with ECC may be caused by depressed RV function. Acute volume loading in this situation may lead to further deterioration of myocardial function due to RV failure, a condition which cannot be diagnosed readily at the bedside with the usual monitoring techniques.\r"

EGF (10 micrograms/kg BW) did not alter pancreatic weight or protein content. However, this concentration of EGF inhibited [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA by 44%, decreased DNA content by 20%, and increased the concentrations of amylase, chymotrypsinogen, and protein by 106%, 232%, and 42%, respectively. Pancreatic acini prepared from EGF-treated rats exhibited a characteristic secretory response to caerulein that was superimposable to that obtained in acini from saline-treated rats. In both groups of acini half-maximal and maximal stimulation of amylase release occurred at approximately 5 pM and 50 pM caerulein, respectively. In contrast to EGF, caerulein (1 microgram/kg BW) increased pancreatic weight by 29% and protein content by 59%, and enhanced [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA by 70%. Although caerulein increased the concentrations of pancreatic amylase and chymotrypsinogen by 38% and 297%, respectively, pancreatic acini prepared from caerulein-treated rats were less sensitive to the actions of caerulein in vitro when compared with acini from control rats. Indeed, the EC50 was shift from 4.8 pM to 9.8 pM after 4 days of treatment. EGF potentiated the actions of caerulein on pancreatic weight, protein content, and chymotrypsinogen concentration, and prevented the caerulein-induced alteration in the secretory responsiveness of the acinar cell. Conversely, caerulein reversed the inhibitory effect of EGF on thymidine incorporation. These findings suggest that EGF may modulate the trophic effects of certain gastrointestinal hormones, and may participate in the regulation of pancreatic exocrine function in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "The plasma osteocalcin (OC) concentration correlates with histological parameters of bone formation and has been used as an index of osteoblast activity. Although the rate of OC synthesis is likely to be a major determinant of the plasma OC level, the contribution of other processes, for example, OC plasma clearance, should be evaluated if changes in the plasma OC concentration are to be interpreted meaningfully. We have treated oophorectomized sheep with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) and glucocorticoids to alter the plasma OC concentration and used an 125I-OC infusion method to measure changes in the OC plasma clearance (PCR) and to calculate production (PPR) rates. 1,25-(OH)2D3 (8 micrograms/day by iv injection) increased plasma OC levels from 15.8 +/- 2.1 to 52.7 +/- 5.3 ng/ml (n = 10; P less than 0.0005) and the OC PPR from 0.9 +/- 0.08 to 2.6 +/- 0.17 mg/day (n = 5, P less than 0.0005). There was no effect on the OC PCR. Both triamcinolone acetonide (TA) and cortisol, administered by iv infusion, decreased the plasma OC concentration to less than 4 ng/ml and the OC PPR to less than 0.4 mg/day when infused in the doses 0.05-1.0 mg/h (TA) and 2.0 mg/h (cortisol). TA (0.05 mg/h) decreased plasma OC to an undetectable level within 24 h. The effect of cortisol infusion on the plasma OC level and the OC PPR was dose dependent in the range 0.2-2.0 mg/h. TA, infused at the rates of 0.25 and 1.0 mg/h, increased the OC PCR from 3.0 +/- 0.10 to 4.0 liters/h (P less than 0.005; n = 4) and from 2.6 +/- 0.10 to 3.9 +/- 0.10 liters/h (P less than 0.01; n = 3), respectively. It is concluded that the OC PPR and the plasma OC concentration in sheep are responsive to treatment with 1,25-(OH)2D3 and glucocorticoids. Although the changes in plasma OC concentration were attributable largely to effects on OC production, high infusion rates of the glucocorticoid TA led to a highly significant increase in OC plasma clearance. These findings suggest that alterations in OC clearance may contribute to the changes in plasma OC levels seen in some disease states, for example, glucocorticoid excess.\r"

We determined the distribution of EGF receptors in uteri of nonpregnant and pregnant mice during the late preimplantation period (days 4.5-5.0 of pregnancy) using radioautograph and quantitative binding techniques. Radioautography of [125I]EGF binding to cornua from nonpregnant mice showed low levels of specific binding evenly distributed throughout the cornua. In contrast, radioautographs of cornua from pregnant mice showed bands of elevated binding encircling the lumen at sites of preimplantation. Results from radioautography were supported by quantitative analysis of [125I]EGF binding to uterine homogenates from nonpregnant and pregnant mice. Binding of [125I]EGF to uterine membranes was highly specific and time dependent. The average level of specific EGF binding calculated from Scatchard plots of nonpregnant uteri (27 +/- 13 fmol/mg protein) was significantly (P less than 0.05) lower than that in pregnant superovulated uteri (106 +/- 67 fmol/mg protein). Furthermore, specific binding of EGF was significantly (P less than 0.05) higher in preimplantation sites than in the intervening nonimplantation regions from the same uteri (42 +/- 6 vs. 29 +/- 4 fmol/mg protein, respectively). Differences in EGF binding appear to be due to changes in the number of EGF receptors, since half-displacement values (1 nM) were similar in all samples. These results demonstrate that alterations of EGF receptor levels occur at sites where implantation will occur in mouse uteri and support the concept that the transforming growth factor-alpha/EGF receptor and its ligands are involved in implantation of concepti.\r"

  ".W": "Hepatic expression of cytochrome P-450j (alcohol-inducible nitrosamine demethylase; P-450 gene IIE1) and P-450 3 (testosterone 7 alpha-hydroxylase; P-450 gene IIA1) is female predominant in adult rats [female/male greater than or equal to 1.5-2 (P-450j) or 3-4 (P-450 3)]. This sex difference emerges during the postsuckling period, when P-450 3 declines significantly (60-70% decrease) in male, but not female, rats, and P-450j declines in both sexes, but to a lower constitutive level in males than in females. The biochemical factors and regulatory events that control these developmental changes were investigated and found to be distinct from those that regulate expression of the female-specific hepatic enzymes P-450 2d (P-450 gene IIC12) and steroid 5 alpha-reductase. Immunoquantitation of the changes in P-450j and P-450 3 levels in hormonally altered rats established that both P-450s are under gonadal control. However, while androgen and estrogen both suppress P-450j expression, estrogen stimulates and androgen suppresses the expression of P-450 3. Since many of the effects of gonadal hormones on hepatic enzyme levels are mediated by the pituitary, the contribution of pituitary hormones to P-450j and P-450 3 expression was evaluated. Hypophysectomy of adult rats of either sex elevated P-450j to the levels found in immature rats (3- to 5-fold increase). This elevation was largely reversed in both sexes by GH administered either intermittently or continuously, demonstrating that P-450j is under the suppressive control of this pituitary hormone. The regulation of P-450 3 was more complex. Hypophysectomy elevated P-450 3 to prepubertal levels in adult male rats, but had no effect on P-450 3 levels in adult females. In both sexes GH suppressed P-450 3 expression when administered to hypophysectomized rats intermittently, but stimulated P-450 3 expression when infused continuously. Corresponding changes in hepatic microsomal P-450 3-dependent testosterone 7 alpha-hydroxylase and P-450j-dependent aniline hydroxylase activities were observed in response to hypophysectomy and GH replacement, but only after supplementation of microsomal NADPH P-450 reductase [which was 63-77% suppressed by hypophysectomy] with exogenous purified NADPH P-450 reductase. These studies demonstrate that these female-predominant hepatic P-450 enzymes are regulated by different mechanisms, and that both are under hormonal regulatory controls distinct from those that govern expression of the female-specific hepatic enzymes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Recombinant human interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) significantly increased prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in a dose-dependent manner in rat astrocyte culture. The minimum effective dose of IL-1 beta was 10(-10)M. IL-1 alpha also increased PGE2, but at a higher concentration. The minimum effective dose of IL-1 alpha was 10(-8)M, indicating it to be 100-fold less effective than IL-1 beta. On the other hand neither IL-1 beta nor IL-1 alpha increased PGE2 production by neuron cultures at any concentration tested. PGE2 response to IL-1 beta was suppressed by simultaneous addition of CRH, somatostatin-14 and LHRH, while these neuropeptides alone did not alter the basal PGE2 levels. Substance P, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and alpha-MSH altered neither basal nor IL-1 beta-induced increase in PGE2 levels. Angiotensin II (AII) alone also increased PGE2 in cultured astrocytes. Combined addition of AII and IL-1 beta induced a synergistic effect in increasing PGE2 levels. The direct action of IL-1 beta on astrocyte culture suggests that astrocytes may be the target cells for IL-1 beta in the central nervous system. In view of the essential role of central PGE2 in IL-1 beta-induced CRH/ACTH release, these findings suggest the presence of a sophisticated regulatory network in the immune-neuroendocrine interaction.\r"

Since IL-1 has been shown to elevate rat plasma ACTH and both of these cytokines induce similar acute-phase responses, the present studies of TNF were undertaken to characterize the ACTH response to this immune cell product. Human rTNF, administered iv at doses (100-1000 ng) which failed to affect blood pressure, food consumption or prolactin levels, resulted in significant peak elevations of rat plasma ACTH within 20 min (mean +/- SE 304 +/- 94 and 958 +/- 128 pg/ml for 100 and 1000 ng, respectively, compared to 53 +/- 16 pg/ml for vehicle). rTNF from two different sources produced similar elevations of ACTH as an equivalent amount of rIL-1. TNF failed to affect cultured anterior pituicytes, and it did not modify the response to CRF. When administered into the upper third cerebroventricle, TNF 20 ng failed to affect ACTH levels whereas IL-1 30 ng raised ACTH to 638 +/- 79 pg/ml compared to 177 +/- 24 pg/ml for vehicle (p less than .001). Furthermore, intraparenchymal injection of IL-1, directly above the median eminence, elevated ACTH to 484 +/- 93 pg/ml; again, TNF was completely ineffective. Thus, TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta are both potent ACTH secretagogues with complementary modes of action; however, the proximate target of TNF action appears to be peripheral to the CNS and pituitary whereas that of IL-1 appears to be the median eminence.\r"

When supplied with optimal doses of exogenous interleukin 2, lamina propria mononuclear cells isolated from inflammatory bowel disease and control tissue display comparable levels of cytotoxicity in vitro. However, cultures of Crohn's disease- and ulcerative colitis-derived cells contain significantly decreased interleukin 2 activity, suggesting that in vivo the availability of interleukin 2 may be limited, perhaps resulting in impaired cytotoxic function. To test this hypothesis, lamina propria mononuclear cells from inflammatory bowel disease and control patients were stimulated to produce endogenous interleukin 2, which was then used to induce autologous lymphokine-activated killer cells. When tested against K562 and Daudi target cells, Crohn's disease cells, despite producing only one-third of the amount of interleukin 2 generated by control cells, exhibited comparable levels of cytotoxicity. In contrast, ulcerative colitis cells produced substantially less interleukin 2 and exhibited remarkably low lymphokine-activated killer cell activity. When the same cells were supplied with an amount of human recombinant interleukin 2 equivalent to the average titer found in control cultures, similar results were obtained, and Crohn's disease cells even showed a significantly greater cytolytic activity than controls. These results suggest that the observed differences in lymphokine-activated killer cell activity cannot be attributed to the level of interleukin 2 alone, and that response to this lymphokine is different among Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and control intestine. In Crohn's disease, there is either an increased number of interleukin 2-responsive cells or an exacerbated reactivity to interleukin 2. In ulcerative colitis, a loss of interleukin 2-responsive cells, a hyporesponsiveness to interleukin 2, or both might be present. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that reactivity to interleukin 2 distinguishes inflammatory bowel disease from control intestinal mononuclear cells, and, under appropriate experimental conditions, it can be used to uncover abnormalities of intestinal immunity.\r"

We report the results of ipsilateral ascending venography in 312 patients undergoing a wide variety of elective knee operations under tourniquet ischaemia, none of whom received any specific prophylaxis against thromboembolism. Total knee replacement was confirmed to carry a high risk with ipsilateral deep vein thrombosis in 56.4% and symptomatic pulmonary embolism in 1.9%. By contrast, arthroscopy was associated with a low incidence of venous thrombosis (4.2%). Meniscectomy, arthrotomy, patellectomy, synovectomy and arthrodesis were all high-risk procedures, particularly in patients over 40 years of age, and were associated with deep vein thrombosis rates of 25% to 67%. On the basis of these findings, we advise prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism in all patients over 40 years of age undergoing elective knee surgery other than arthroscopy.\r"

A bolus iv dose of 100 micrograms CRH acutely stimulated PRL secretion in both normal and ovariectomized animals. The magnitude of the PRL response was greater in ovariectomized monkeys (212% increase; n = 5) than in normal monkeys (56% increase; n = 5). Naloxone pretreatment inhibited CRH-induced PRL release in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas nalmefene did not, in both normal and ovariectomized monkeys. Administration of nalmefene alone significantly stimulated PRL secretion in normal monkeys (57% increase; n = 10), but not in ovariectomized monkeys (10% increase; n = 10). Naloxone alone had no effect. Since nalmefene has a high affinity for both the kappa- and mu-receptors whereas naloxone binds primarily to the mu-receptor, these results suggest that CRH-induced PRL secretion in monkeys is mediated by an endogenous opiate which binds to an opiate receptor other than or in addition to the mu- and kappa-receptors.\r"

Serum osteocalcin was not detected (less than 0.2 micrograms/L) after the first trimester in the majority of women, and it reappeared within 48 h after delivery. The disappearance of osteocalcin after the first trimester and its rapid reappearance after delivery suggest placental clearance of this peptide. We conclude that serum osteocalcin measurements cannot be used as a marker of bone metabolism during pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "HIV selectively inhibited the proliferative response of clonal CD4+ T lymphocytes to alloantigen while other alloantigen-dependent responses were unperturbed. Specifically, impaired blastogenesis could be dissociated from alloantigen-specific induction of the B cell activation molecule CD23, IL-4 release, and inositol lipid hydrolysis. In addition, membrane expression of pertinent T cell receptor molecules, including CD2, CD3, and T cell antigen receptor (Ti), remained intact. Using two MHC class II-specific human CD4+ helper T cell clones, the proliferative defect was shown to be an early consequence of HIV infection, occurring within 4 d of viral inoculation and preceding increases in mature virion production. It was generalizable to three distinct methods of T cell activation, all independent of antigen-presenting cells: anti-CD3 mediated cross-linking of the CD3/Ti complex; anti-CD2 and phorbol 12-myristic 13-acetate (PMA); and anti-CD28 plus PMA. These abnormalities were not mitigated by addition of exogenous IL-2, even though expression of the IL-2 receptor (CD25) was unaltered. These studies define a selective blockade in T cell function early after HIV exposure that could serve as a model for certain in vivo manifestations of AIDS.\r"

  ".W": "A series of immunological approaches was utilized to identify the molecules involved in cell-substratum adhesion of human endothelial cells (EC) derived from adult large vessels, fat capillaries, and umbilical veins. A polyclonal antibody prepared against partially purified extracellular matrix receptors disrupted adhesion of EC to a wide variety of substrates and identified four groups of glycoproteins migrating with apparent Mr of 150, 125, 110, and 95 kD in immunoprecipitation experiments. Specific monoclonal antibodies identified these proteins as members of the Integrin family of extracellular matrix receptors and included the alpha and beta chains of the fibronectin receptor (alpha 5/beta 1), a collagen receptor (alpha 2 beta 1), a multifunctional receptor that binds to fibronectin, collagen, and laminin (alpha 3/beta 1), as well as a receptor related to platelet IIb/IIIa (alpha v/beta 3). To directly test the importance of these molecules in cell-substratum adhesion, these proteins were purified by a combination of ion exchange, lectin affinity, and immunoaffinity chromatography and used to block the biological activity of the adhesion-disrupting polyclonal antibody. Immunofluorescence experiments further supported the role of these glycoproteins in adhesion. The GPIIb/IIIa-like receptor localized to well-formed adhesion plaques on EC plated on fibrinogen, but not on fibronectin, laminin, or type IV collagen. Receptors containing the beta 1 subunit were visualized as discontinuous fibrils which colocalized with fibronectin fibrils and actin stress fibers.\r"

  ".U": "89255959\r", 
  ".W": "Specific interactions between DNA and transcription factors are necessary for transcription initiation. These interactions provide a potential target for the selective inhibition of eukaryotic gene expression. Mithramycin is a DNA binding antibiotic which, in the presence of Mg2+, binds G-C containing sequences in the minor groove. The SV40 early promoter contains six G-C decanucleotide sequences, which are binding sites for the transcriptional activating factor, Sp1. Each of the six Sp1 binding sites of this promoter is protected from DNAse 1 digestion by mithramycin binding. Mithramycin binding to the G-C rich sequences in the SV40 early promoter prevents subsequent protein binding to these sequences. The gel retardation of the SV40 early promoter fragment incubated with a HeLa cell extract is completely abrogated by pretreatment of the DNA fragment with mithramycin. The functional significance of mithramycin binding is reflected in the ability of mithramycin to block promoter function. Mithramycin inhibits promoter dependent transcription in an in vitro runoff transcription system in a concentration dependent manner. This suggests that mithramycin prevents transcriptional activation of the SV40 early promoter by blocking binding of transcriptional activating proteins to G-C rich promoter regions.\r"

Each patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and concomitant left ventricular myotomy-myectomy or mitral valve replacement. The mean age at operation was 59 years (range 42 to 74). Five patients (18%) died as a result of operation, four in the immediate postoperative period and one at 2 months postoperatively. Three patients died after the immediate postoperative period of causes unrelated to the operation. The mean follow-up period for the 20 currently surviving patients was 4.8 years (range 4 months to 10.8 years). Nineteen of these patients have experienced substantial functional improvement; all are currently asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic. Twenty-one patients underwent cardiac catheterization before and after operation; each experienced relief of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction after operation. Twelve patients had a preoperative outflow gradient greater than or equal to 50 mm Hg (average 86 +/- 7) under basal conditions, which decreased to 3 +/- 1.8 mm Hg postoperatively (p less than 0.001). Nine patients had a severe preoperative gradient only with a provocative maneuver (average 93 +/- 6 mm Hg), which decreased to 24 +/- 8 mm Hg postoperatively (p less than 0.001). Five of the 24 patients undergoing left ventricular myotomy-myectomy incurred an iatrogenic ventricular septal defect. This operative complication occurred primarily in patients with a relatively thin ventricular septum (less than 20 mm) and contributed importantly to postoperative death in two of the patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Evidence of valvular regurgitation was present in 73% of subjects. There were 46 subjects with regurgitation of one valve, 24 with regurgitation of two valves and 3 with regurgitation of three valves. Right-sided regurgitation was significantly more common than was left-sided regurgitation (81 versus 22 valves, p less than 0.01). Regurgitant flow was never detected farther than 1 cm from the valve by pulsed Doppler study. Tricuspid regurgitation was detected in 50 subjects and was characterized by a holosystolic velocity signal; a complete spectral envelope was recorded in 32 subjects. The peak velocity of the regurgitant jet for this group was 1.7 to 2.3 m/s (mean 2.0 +/- 0.2). Thirty-one subjects were found to have pulmonary regurgitation with a peak velocity of 1.2 to 1.9 m/s (mean 1.5 +/- 0.2); no subject demonstrated regurgitant flow in early diastole. There were 21 subjects with mitral regurgitation; continuous wave Doppler signals were always of low intensity with a poorly defined spectral envelope and an absence of high velocities. Peak velocities ranged from 1.1 to 4.4 m/s (mean 2.3 +/- 0.9) and in 19 subjects were less than 3.5 m/s. The mean age of subjects with mitral regurgitation was significantly higher than that of subjects without mitral regurgitation (p = 0.01). Aortic regurgitation was detected in only one subject.

Lymphocytes from the RIIIS mouse strain which possess E alpha yet whose T cells fail to recognize the MAM-E alpha complex were shown not to express V beta 8.1, 8.2 or 8.3 gene products present on the TCR-alpha/beta by virtue of their lack of reactivity with the F23.1 mAb. Because lymphocytes from the congenic B10.RIII mouse strain reacted positively with F23.1, we examined the progeny from (RIIIS x B10.RIII)F1 x RIIIS backcross mice for cosegregation of lymphocytes expressing F23.1-reactive sites and ability to proliferate in response to MAM. Whereas lymphocytes of all mice responded to Con A, only lymphocytes from progeny expressing F23.1-reactive cells responded to MAM. Similar studies were conducted on progeny from the F23.1- SWR mouse which was backcrossed to (SWR x B10.RIII)F1 mice. Of the E alpha-bearing progeny, there was a direct correlation between lymphocyte expression of F23.1 determinants and ability to respond to MAM. These results established that MAM reactivity was dependent upon a product(s) of the V beta locus of the TCR-alpha/beta. Nodal and thymic lymphocytes cultured for 3 days in vitro with MAM exhibited clonal expansion of F23.1 and F23.2-reactive cells as compared with cultures treated with Con A. We also demonstrated that F23.1 and F23.2 mAb inhibited the ability of lymphocytes to proliferate in response to MAM but had little effect on responses to Con A. The combined data suggest that the MAM-E alpha complex can utilize a V beta 8 gene product(s) on the TCR-alpha/beta.\r"

Sepharose conjugated anti-CD3, monocytes, and PMA each could induce the p55 component of the IL-2R as well as responsiveness to exogenous IL-2. Sepharose anti-CD3 did not induce IL-2, although the levels of IL-2 protein and mRNA were 10 to 30 times higher with PMA than with monocytes. Despite these differences in IL-2 production, the amount of DNA synthesis and the number of lymphoblasts were comparable when monocytes or PMA were used as the accessory stimulus, and the responses were equally sensitive to inhibition by an anti-IL-2R antibody. To pursue the functional relevance of the \"supraoptimal\" levels of IL-2 that are induced by PMA, anti-CD3-induced lymphoblasts were isolated free of monocytes and challenged with lymphokines. It could be shown that 1) the small amounts of IL-2 in the monocyte-T cell conditioned medium would drive DNA synthesis, but that 2) higher levels of IL-2 (20 to 100 U/ml) were needed to induce IFN-gamma, as well as the mRNA for IL-4 and the p55 IL-2R. We suggest that the capacity to produce high levels of IL-2, as seen with PMA, is required under physiologic conditions for two reasons: to up-regulate the IL-2R when small amounts of Ag rather than large amounts of anti-CD3 are ligands for the T cell, or to induce the release of lymphokines like IL-4 and IFN-gamma from sensitized lymphoblasts.\r"

The anti-CD45 mAb also inhibited the anti-IgM-induced initial rise in intracellular [Ca2+] and the G0-G1 cell cycle transition of small tonsillar B cells. However, co-stimulation with anti-IgM/anti-CDw40 Ab resulted in the resistance to the anti-CD45 inhibitory effect on proliferation of peripheral blood B cells and the majority of tonsillar B cells. In contrast, B cell proliferation co-stimulated with anti-IgM Ab/and B cell growth factors were always suppressed by the anti-CD45 mAb. These results demonstrate that certain activational signal mechanisms utilized by anti-CDw40/anti-IgM Ab and anti-IgM Ab/B cell growth factors are different in that B cells stimulated with these agents differ in their sensitivity to the anti-CD45 mAb. Moreover, both the activational state of human B cells and the nature of activation signals given determine their response to the inhibitory signals delivered by the anti-CD45 mAb.\r"

The immobilized Ag retains its native structure and will trigger specific, TCR-mediated degranulation of cloned CTL. Stimulation of the response is dependent on the surface density of Ag, and displays a critical threshold density below which response does not occur. Individual clones differ with respect to the threshold density required for activation, but these differences are not large. With one exception, the cloned lines examined respond to Ag densities comparable to that found on normal allogeneic cells, and critical threshold densities varied over about a fourfold range. Coimmobilization of alloantigen and nonantigenic class I protein of a different specificity has the effect of decreasing the threshold density of alloantigen required for response to occur. This augmentation is specific for class I, coimmobilized class II protein does not affect responses, and is very likely mediated by Lyt-2 (CD8) interaction with nonpolymorphic determinants on the class I protein. Thus, class I alloantigen is the necessary and sufficient ligand for activation of most allogeneic CTL clones, and both TCR and Lyt-2 interactions contribute to the response. The results described here for effector CTL are compared with those previously found in examining the ligand requirements for activation of precursor CTL.\r"

  ".W": "We recently generated a series of human alloantigen-specific, CD3+,TCR-gamma,delta+ clones by stimulating CD3+,CD4-,CD8- T cells from normal individuals with allogeneic lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL). As reported previously, these clones display cytotoxic activity against their specific stimulators but not against irrelevant LCL. Further studies of these and other TCR-gamma,delta+ clones, described in this report, indicate that most but not all of these clones express the NK cell associated marker, NKH-1 or Leu-19, and kill NK-sensitive targets such as the K562 and Molt 4 lines, but not an irrelevant LCL or NK-resistant line, Raji. TCR-gamma,delta+ clones which lacked expression of Leu-19 lysed their allospecific targets but had no detectable NK activity. The allospecific cytotoxicity of Leu-19+ and Leu-19- clones was inhibited by mAb to CD3 or the TCR delta-chain. In contrast, the NK-like activity of the Leu-19+ clones was enhanced by these antibodies over a wide range of antibody concentration. Although mAb to LFA-1 markedly inhibited both the allospecific and NK-like activity of these clones, an HLA class I framework specific mAb (W6/32) had no effect on NK-like cytolysis but did inhibit allospecific killing, suggesting that the target structures on the surface of allospecific and NK-sensitive cells are distinct. The receptors utilized by the TCR-gamma,delta+ clones to recognize NK-sensitive and allospecific targets are also distinct, since killing of NK-sensitive targets was blocked by the presence of cold (unlabeled) NK-sensitive cells but not by cold allospecific targets, whereas allospecific cytolysis was inhibited by cold allospecific targets but not by NK-sensitive cells. We conclude that some CD3+,TCR-gamma,delta+ clones exhibit NK-like as well as allospecific killing and that these two activities are mediated by distinct receptor-ligand interactions.\r"

  ".W": "The TCR is comprised of two variable chains that confer specificity, called alpha:beta or gamma:delta, physically associated with five different molecules that comprise the complex known as CD3. Antibodies to this complex are very useful, as they react with all T lymphocytes. A rat mAb to mouse CD3 has been prepared. It reacts with 100% of T cells in all mouse strains tested but with no other cell type. It binds to the CD3 epsilon chain. This antibody activates cloned T cell lines and normal T cells, provided suitable accessory cells and signals are present. This antibody detects a determinant similar to but not identical with those detected by two previously reported hamster anti-CD3 epsilon antibodies. This antibody fixes C efficiently, and it is thus useful for depletion of T cells from bulk populations. Activation of T cells by one of the three different anti-CD3 epsilon antibodies was inhibited by the Fab fragment of anti-CD4, similar to the effects of anti-CD4 Fab on two previously reported anti-TCR V region antibodies that bind a CD3 epsilon-associated epitope. This further defines a site involving TCR V regions and CD3 epsilon with which CD4 appears to associate during T cell activation.\r"

  ".W": "CD43 (sialophorin, gpL115) is a sialoglycoprotein expressed on a wide variety of blood cells including lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, and platelets. L10, an anti-CD43 mAb, has been shown to induce monocyte-dependent activation and proliferation of human T lymphocytes. We have studied the signaling mechanism involved in this activation process. Treatment of PBMC and purified populations of T cells and monocytes with L10 induced the hydrolysis of phosphoinositides with the resultant generation of the phosphoinositide-derived second messengers diacylglycerol and inositol phosphates. This was associated with the translocation of protein kinase C from cytosol to membrane fractions and an increase in free intracellular Ca2+ in treated cells. In human leukemic T cell lines, the magnitude of signaling via CD43 did not correlate with the density of the TCR/CD3 surface expression nor with the intensity of signaling via the TCR/CD3. Moreover, a mutant derived from the leukemic T cell line HPB-ALL that was severely defective in TCR/CD3 surface expression and signaling nevertheless had normal CD43 surface expression and signaling compared with the parent cell line. It is concluded that CD43 is functionally coupled to the phospholipase C/phosphoinositides signaling pathway. In human T cells, signaling via CD43 proceeds independently of TCR/CD3. The widespread expression of CD43 suggests a potentially important role for this molecule in orchestrating the activation of multiple cell types.\r"

  ".U": "89256666\r", 
  ".W": "The ability of mAb to class I MHC molecules, CD3, or CD4/CD8 to stimulate human T cell clones alone or in combination was examined. Cross-linking each of these surface Ag with appropriate mAb and goat anti-mouse Ig (GaMIg) resulted in a unique pattern of increase in intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i) and different degrees of functional activation. Cross-linking class I MHC molecules provided the most effective stimulus of IL-2 production and proliferation. Cross-linking more than one surface Ag induced a compound calcium signal with characteristics of each individual response. Cross-linking CD3 + HLA-A,B,C caused a rapid and prolonged increase in [Ca2+]i and synergistically increased IL-2 production and proliferation of all clones. Cross-linking CD3 + CD4/CD8 also generated a compound calcium signal and increased IL-2 production and DNA synthesis. Purposeful inclusion of CD3 was not required for costimulation as cross-linking HLA-A,B,C + CD4/CD8 also increased [Ca2+]i, IL-2 production, and proliferation. Cross-linking three surface Ag, CD3 + HLA-A,B,C + CD4/CD8, resulted in the greatest initial and sustained [Ca2+]i, IL-2 production, and DNA synthesis. Although there was a tendency for the various stimuli to increase both [Ca2+]i and functional responsiveness, neither the magnitude nor duration of the increased [Ca2+]i correlated with the amount of IL-2 produced or the ultimate proliferative response. To determine whether costimulation required that the various surface molecules were cross-linked together, experiments were carried out using isotype specific secondary antibodies. Augmentation of [Ca2+]i and costimulation of functional responses were noted when class I MHC molecules were cross-linked and CD3 was bound, but not cross-linked. Similarly, costimulation through CD3 and CD4/CD8 was observed when CD4/CD8 was cross-linked and the CD3 complex was engaged by an anti-CD3 mAb which was not further cross-linked. In contrast, costimulation by class I MHC molecules and CD4/CD8 was only observed when these molecules were cross-linked together. These data demonstrate that cross-linking class I MHC determinants or CD4/CD8 provides a direct signal to T cell clones that can be enhanced when CD3 is independently engaged. The results also indicate that T cell clones can be stimulated without engaging CD3 by the combination of signals delivered via class I MHC molecules and CD4/CD8, but only when these determinants were cross-linked together. These studies have demonstrated that these cell surface molecules differ in their capacity to deliver activation signals to T cell clones and also exhibit unique patterns of positive cooperativity in signaling potential.\r"

  ".W": "For therapeutic medical, cosmetic, and recreational reasons, humans expose themselves to increasing amounts of UVA. However, little is known of the photobiologic events associated with cutaneous carcinogenesis and photoaging that occur as a result of UVA exposure. UVB exposure of human skin abrogates the function of epidermal CD1+DR+ Langerhans cells and induces the appearance of CD1-DR+ non-Langerhans cell APC. This non-Langerhans cell APC population activates autoreactive immunoregulatory T cells that lead to suppressor-effector T cell function. In this report we show that, similarly to UBV, UVA exposure abrogates the function of CD1+DR+ Langerhans cells. However, in contrast to UVB, there is rapid recovery of Langerhans cell antigen-presenting cell activity and that CD1-DR+ non-Langerhans cell APC failed to appear to a significant degree. In keeping with the lack of CD1-DR+ epidermal cells, UVA exposed epidermal cells harvested 3 days after exposure functioned similarly to normal epidermis in that they activated alloreactive T cells but not autoreactive T cells in the absence of added Ag. This was in contrast to UVB irradiated epidermal cells that potently activate autoreactive T cells and contain CD1-DR+ cells. Thus, although both UVA and UVB initially depletes and inactivates CD1+DR+ Langerhans cells, the subsequent APC function of epidermal cells exposed to UVA differ profoundly from that of cells exposed to UVB. UVA radiation is less carcinogenic than UVB; differences in host responses to UV tumors may be linked to the rapid recovery of Langerhans cell function and the lack of induction of CD1-DR+ non-Langerhans cell APC after UVA exposure.\r"

  ".W": "Sponge matrix allografts and isografts become extensively encapsulated and neovascularized after s.c. implantation. Sponge allografts acquire alloantigen-reactive T lymphocytes, whereas sponge isografts fail to do so, even though these T cells are continuously circulating in the peripheral blood. We have investigated the possibility that the vascular endothelia regulates lymphocytic accumulation in sponge matrix implants. In normal lymph nodes, specialized high endothelial venules (HEV) regulate lymphocyte extravasation from the blood. We have now identified HEV-like vessels in sponge matrix allografts. These vessels are operationally defined as \"HEV-like\" in that they react with mAb MECA 325 which identifies murine HEV, and bind lymphocytes in ex vivo adhesion assays. In contrast, sponge isografts contain MECA 325 reactive vessels that are significantly smaller than those found in allografts. Further, vessels of sponge isografts do not readily bind lymphocytes in ex vivo adhesion assays. Immunohistologic analysis also revealed that the small MECA 325+ vessels present in sponge isografts are consistently found in close proximity to nerve bundles. Although this MECA 325 reactive vessel-nerve bundle association is also observed in sponge allografts, large MECA 325 reactive vessels are widely distributed in allografts. Our data suggest that small, poorly adhesive MECA 325 reactive vessels develop in sponge isografts and allografts, possibly under the influence of local nerve tissue. These vessels respond to regional alloimmune responses by developing into the larger HEV-like vessels capable of binding lymphocytes in sponge allografts. The value of this experimental system as an in vivo model to evaluate mechanisms involved in neovascularization and endothelial differentiation is discussed.\r"

We uncovered a novel immunomodulatory property of CsA as a potent immunologic stimulator in the murine IgE antibody system. The enhancement of IgE responses was observed in mice receiving as few as three daily i.m. injections before Ag priming. Our studies demonstrate the three points listed below. First, CsA potentiates murine IgE responses regardless of Ag specificities in inbred mice. A hierarchy of immunopotentiation by CsA follows the order of low, intermediate, and high IgE responder mice. Second, CsA, when administered along with Ag, exerts a thorough and long lasting impact on the Ag-specific IgE antibody response, and leads to an Ag-specific breakthrough of IgE antibody synthesis in mice rendered tolerant in the IgE antibody system by soluble Ag pretreatment or neonatal IgE treatment. Third, IgE enhancer cells become sensitive to a low dose of irradiation. Two enhancer cellular components are identified, those of the Th cells and B cells, which appear to favor the induction of IgE responses. Understanding the cellular basis of the immunopotentiating effect of CsA will provide further insight into the murine IgE antibody system.\r"

We found an increase in PBL bearing the Ta1 Ag in untreated patients. The euthyroid patients in remission, induced by antithyroidal drugs, radioisotope therapy, and subtotal thyroidectomy, had lower percentages of Ta1+ cells than did untreated patients. An increased percentage of Ta1+ cells in untreated patients was found in both CD4+ cells and CD8+ cells. The ratio of CD4+Ta1+ cells to CD8+Ta1+ cells in untreated patients was significantly higher than that of normal subjects. There was a positive correlation between the percentage of Ta1+ cells and the level of anti-TSH receptor antibody. In this prospective study, the proportion of Ta1+ cells was decreased in parallel with the reduction in anti-TSH receptor antibody and free T3 levels. In the chronically treated patients, the proportion of Ta1+ cells in the thyroid tissue was, yet similar to that in the peripheral blood, markedly increased in comparison to that of normal subjects. In contrast to Ta1+ cells, the thyroid tissue had a significantly higher percentage of HLA-DR+ T cells than did the paired peripheral blood. The proliferative responses of the Ta1+ cell-enriched population isolated from untreated patients toward thyroglobulin and microsomal Ag were markedly higher than those in a Ta1+ cell-depleted population, but both populations were able to respond equally to PHA. These results suggest that the Ta1+ cells may include Ag-triggered memory cells that are reactive with thyroid-specific Ag. Furthermore, monitoring such cells may provide an objective measure of abnormal immunologic activity.\r"

Moreover, the IL-2R levels were negatively correlated most prominently with CD4 cell counts, with lymphocyte counts, and with a decrease in the CD4-CD8 ratio but not with either WBC counts or B cell counts. As striking elevations of serum IL-2R were noted in AIDS patients with group IVD infection, the serum IL-2R was purified sequentially by using size-exclusion HPLC, high-pressure chromatofocusing, and H48 affinity HPLC. The isoelectric point values of IL-2R were separated into 4.2 and 3.8, whereas the Mr was determined to be only 45 kDa by immunoprecipitation with H48 antibody followed by SDS-PAGE. However, production of cellular and supernatant IL-2R was not elevated in PBMC of patients with AIDS or in any of the 19 HIV-I- or HIV-II-infected cell line cells. In contrast, PBMC from patients with adult T cell leukemia and cell line cells that expressed human T cell lymphotropic virus -I or -II produced soluble IL-2R, constitutively. The mechanisms by which serum levels of IL-2R might be elevated in HIV-infected patients are discussed in comparison with that in adult T cell leukemia patients.\r"

Rather, IgG anti-DNA autoantibodies within an individual autoimmune mouse are oligoclonal and somatically mutated. These results demonstrate that IgG anti-DNA autoantibodies are the products of clonally selective B cell stimulation and exhibit the same characteristics as secondary immune antibodies to conventional immunogens: they are IgG, they are clonally restricted, and they are somatically mutated.\r"

  ".W": "B cell hyperactivity characterizes many autoimmune diseases. In NZB mice this is manifested by a variety of immunologic aberrations, including increased B cell proliferation and hyper IgM and IgA secretion in vitro. Recent studies have shown that IgA secretion can be suppressed or enhanced in an isotype-specific manner by a soluble factor(s), called IgA-binding factor (IgABF), produced by IgA FcR-bearing T cells. We now show that T cells from young NZB mice, cultured with high concentrations of IgA, produce an IgABF that has aberrant biologic activity when compared to IgABF produced from IgA FcR+ T cells of BALB/c mice. Although BALB/c IgABF normally suppresses proliferation and secretion by IgA-producing B cells, neither proliferation nor IgA secretion from normal murine IgA-B cells is suppressed by NZB IgABF. In fact, IgA secretion is significantly enhanced by NZB IgABF. We also present the first evidence of IgA anti-mouse erythrocyte (anti-MRBC) autoantibody-forming cells present in the spleens of NZB mice. Whereas BALB/c IgABF suppresses the in vitro generation of IgA anti-MRBC autoantibody-forming cells by NZB spleen cells, NZB IgABF enhances this response. Of particular interest is the development of IgA anti-MRBC autoantibody-forming cells in cultures of spleen cells from nonautoimmune BALB/c mice in the presence of NZB IgABF. These studies suggest that isotype-specific T cells factors might play an important role in the development of autoantibody-forming cells.\r"

The effects of human rTGF-beta 1 on the production of IL-1 and TNF by activated PBMC were studied. The addition of TGF-beta 1 alone caused an increase in the levels of mRNA for IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and TGF-alpha. This was due to increased transcription rather than enhanced mRNA stability. The induced mRNA were of the appropriate size as assessed by Northern blotting. However, the mRNA did not appear to be translated into protein, inasmuch as the translation products of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha were not detected by RIA or ELISA. Furthermore, in experiments utilizing a neutralizing antibody to TGF-beta 1, we were unable to unmask IL-1 biologic activities and unable to detect TNF biologic activity in the WEHI 164 cytotoxicity assay. TGF-beta inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the induction of IL-1 beta by LPS or TNF but not by PHA and PMA. Similarly, LPS induction of TNF-alpha was blocked by TGF-beta, whereas induction of PMA and PHA was completely resistant. TGF-beta 1 did not increase PGE2 secretion or cause elevated intracellular cAMP; thus, the inhibitory effects of TGF-beta 1 seem not to be mediated by PGE2 or cAMP, which have both been implicated in post-transcriptional control of cytokine gene expression. These findings suggest a dual role for TGF-beta 1 in the regulation of cytokine production at both transcriptional and translational levels.\r"

  ".U": "89256681\r", 
  ".W": "When mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) are cocultured with a confluent layer of mouse 3T3 fibroblasts in the presence of WEHI-3-conditioned medium, the mast cells undergo a phenotypic change toward that of a connective tissue mast cell, and the fibroblasts increase their synthesis of globopentaosylceramide. We now demonstrate that fibroblasts lose their contact inhibition and multiply such that by the 2nd and the 4th wk of coculture there are, respectively, approximately four-fold and six-fold more fibroblasts than in the cultures that are not exposed to BMMC. This in vitro increase in the number of fibroblasts is dependent on the number of mast cells (over the range of 6 x 10(4) to 1 x 10(6) BMMC/culture) initially seeded with the fibroblasts and on the concentration of WEHI-3-conditioned medium present during the coculture. That the fibroblasts also multiply in BMMC/fibroblast cocultures exposed to synthetic IL-3 or to purified IL-3 indicates that IL-3 is a component in WEHI-3-conditioned medium that induces mast cells to produce the fibroblast growth factor. The number of fibroblasts does not increase if fibroblasts are exposed to lysates of BMMC, or to BMMC-derived conditioned medium, or if the two cell types are separated from one another during the coculture with a 3-microns filter or a 0.4-microns filter. Thus, IL-3-activated BMMC must be in proximity to fibroblasts to induce them to multiply. Because of their increased numbers per culture dish, total fibroblasts that were cocultured with mast cells synthesized approximately two-fold more 35S-labeled proteoglycans, incorporated approximately 3-fold more [3H] proline into collagenase-sensitive proteins, and had substantially more alpha 2(I) collagen mRNA than fibroblasts that were maintained in the absence of mast cells. These is vitro studies reveal a sequence by which IL-3-activated mast cells may play a role in the induction of fibrosis.\r"

We have constructed a cDNA clone encoding this region of the protein (residues 1 to 316). Expression of this cDNA in HeLa cells leads to secretion of a soluble IL-1 alpha binding protein into the culture medium. Quantitative binding experiments with the truncated receptor show that it possesses IL-1 binding properties which are indistinguishable from those of full length IL-1R. Gel filtration chromatography experiments show that a complex can be formed between a single truncated receptor molecule and a single IL-1 alpha molecule.\r"

Previous studies have established that CKS-17 conjugated to BSA (CKS-17-BSA) inhibited IL-1-mediated tumor toxicity in melanoma cells and proliferation in murine Th clones. We examined the effects of CKS-17-BSA on IL-1 action. CKS-17-BSA did not bind to IL-1, nor did it affect the number of IL-1 receptors, their binding affinity, or their ability to internalize IL-1. However, CKS-17-BSA inhibited production of IL-2 by murine thymoma cells treated with IL-1 or with 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13 acetate. The potent protein kinase C inhibitor, H7, also inhibited IL-1-mediated responses, while HA1004, a weak inhibitor of protein kinase C, did not. Protein kinase C activity in the cytosolic fraction prepared from thymoma cells was found to be inhibited by CKS-17-BSA in a dose-dependent manner. All of these findings are consistent with the idea that CKS-17-BSA inhibits IL-1-mediated responses by interfering with signal transduction through a protein kinase C pathway.\r"

Addition of IL-1 to such thymocytes renders them about 100-fold more sensitive to IL-6. At all conditions proliferation is inhibitable with antibodies to IL-2 and to the IL-2R. Our experiments show that IL-1-driven proliferation of thymocytes is dependent on endogenous IL-6 production and that in the classical thymocyte assay IL-1 has a dual role: it induces IL-6 production and it greatly increases the sensitivity for IL-6.\r"

We have studied the control of IL-6 expression in human monocytes because they play a key role in the production of this molecule. The effects of adherence and different cytokines including CSF-1, IFN-gamma, IL-1 alpha, and granulocyte-macrophage-CSF were tested on IL-6 expression. IL-6 mRNA was usually not detected in the starting population of PBMC. Adherence induced IL-6 gene expression in monocytes in less than 2 h and subsequently IL-6 secretion. Priming of monocytes by adherence was more efficient for IL-6 overinduction by CSF-1. In contrast, high level induction of IL-6 by IFN-gamma in unfractionated PBMC did not require adherence and in situ hybridization revealed that IL-6 mRNA was present in monocytes but not in lymphocytes. A similar phenomenon was observed for IL-1 alpha and granulocyte-macrophage-CSF. Two cell lines, HL-60 and U937, in which monocytic differentiation occurs after induction by PMA, were subsequently investigated. IL-6 was not constitutively detectable in these two cell lines, whereas PMA treatment induced IL-6 expression. This effect was rapid (30 min) and transitory in HL-60, whereas IL-6 mRNA was still detected after 72 h of induction in U937. Addition of human rIL-6 on U937 and HL-60 cells inhibited their proliferation and enhanced expression of HLA class I Ag.\r"

We compared B cells from spleen and from Peyer's patches either stimulated with LPS or without added polyclonal stimulation. We also compared high density (small) and low density (large) B cells. The effect of lymphokines depended on the size and source of the B cells as well as on whether LPS was added. As expected, small B cells from either lymphoid compartment responded to LPS alone and IL-4 suppressed IgM and IgG3 production and enhanced IgG1. In contrast, when large B cells were examined, the suppressive effects of IL-4 were much less apparent but the enhancement of IgG1 was still marked. IL-5 alone had only minimal effects in LPS-stimulated cultures but the combination of IL-4 plus IL-5 appeared to overcome much of the IL-4-mediated suppression of IgM, and IgA production was enhanced. In the absence of LPS, a quite different profile is seen. First, small B cells make little if any response. Second, there is dramatic synergy between IL-4 and IL-5 in the response of large B cells, which is independent of isotype. Third, IL-4 does not suppress any isotype in the absence of LPS. Fourth, IL-4 plus IL-5 stimulate large Peyer's patch B cells to produce 10 times more IgA but three times less IgM than large spleen B cells. Fifth, Th2 cells directly stimulate both large and small B cells.\r"

We sought to determine whether IL-1 beta could influence platelet and/or megakaryocytes and their progenitor cells following in vivo administration to normal mice. Our results demonstrated that, although administration of IL-1 beta clearly expands the pool of megakaryocyte-CFU and acetylcholinesterase-positive megakaryocytic cells (primarily in the spleen), it causes a transient and dose-dependent reduction of circulating platelets. The associated thrombocytopenia can be abolished by splenectomy before IL-1 beta administration, and is not temporally associated with the development of splenomegaly.\r"

It has been proposed that E (RBC) CR1 act as a shuttle mechanism, binding circulating IC and transporting them to tissue macrophages, thereby preventing their deposition in target tissues. In this study we have established an in vitro model system with which to study the transfer of model IC from CR1 on the RBC surface to phagocytic cells. Aggregated IgG (AHG) was opsonized with C3b, bound to RBC CR1, and the binding of these RBC-bound IC by a human monocyte cell line (U937 cells) was examined. U937 binding of AHG from the RBC surface was complete within 2 min, whereas binding of the same AHG from solution required 30 to 60 min. Despite the difference in kinetics of binding, the total amount of IC bound by U937 cells at equilibrium was the same for RBC-bound AHG and for AHG in solution. The transfer of AHG from the RBC to the U937 cell did not require exogenous factor I and was not accompanied by binding of RBC to U937 cells or by erythrophagocytosis. Our data lend support to the hypothesis that binding of IC to RBC CR1 may facilitate the clearance of IC from the circulation by enhancing their uptake by phagocytic cells.\r"

The second complementarity determining regions of the VH and VL of 87.92.6 share sequence similarity with a determinant on the HA3. We have used synthetic peptides (termed VH, VL, and Reo peptides, respectively) to probe the immunologic significance of this sequence similarity. Antibodies specific for Reo peptide or VL peptide neutralized reovirus type 3 infectivity. Although Reo peptide was an effective immunogen by itself, free VL peptide or VH peptide were unable to elicit antibodies unless they were linked to each other (VH-VL peptide). Immunization with reo peptide, 87.92.6, or the HA3 elicited a specific lymphocyte proliferative response to VH peptide, indicating that VH peptide may bear an important TH determinant. As found previously for 87.92.6, VL peptide elicited a delayed-type hypersensitivity response specific for reovirus type 3. Reovirus type 3 specific cytolytic lymphocytes specifically lysed targets coated with VH-VL peptide, but not VH or VL peptide alone. These results suggest that immune cross-reactivity between an external Ag and an internal image antibody can be understood at the primary structural level. These observations may have important implications for understanding the development of autoantibodies, network interactions, and the regulation of immune responses.\r"

To compare the relative ability of cytoplasts and cells to generate second-messengers (inositol phosphates, Ca2+) in response to stimulation of the high affinity receptor for IgE, we normalized our results per recovered receptor by using the tightly bound IgE as a marker. This marker correlated well with other estimates of plasma membrane recovery. Furthermore, data normalized on this basis correlated well with data expressed as percentage of phosphoinositides hydrolyzed. The purest fraction of cytoplasts (containing about 6% of the receptors) was satisfactorily devoid of organelles and, at early times, generated about 50% as much inositol phosphates per receptor as did the intact, untreated cells. This response of the cytoplasts, like that of the cells, was totally dependent upon aggregation of the receptors. The response by the cytoplasts (in the 5-min time frame which we examined), unlike that of the cells, was not enhanced by the presence of extracellular Ca2+. Furthermore, unlike the cells, the cytoplasts failed to raise their intracellular free Ca2+ levels after addition of polyvalent Ag. This result suggests that aggregation of the receptors may be insufficient, by itself, to open the normal Ca2+ channels.\r"

The mechanisms underlying persistent immunologic unresponsiveness are unclear. We have now studied whether tolerance toward complex viral Ag expressed on Moloney sarcoma virus (MSV)-transformed tumor cells can be induced when given at the time of severe helper cell depletion. Although mice that had been injected with anti-CD4 mAb at the time of immunization regained the ability to recognize MSV Ag, their humoral and cytotoxic immunity to MSV were severely compromised. Ag-specific low responsiveness was maintained for more than 6 mo. To analyze the T cell repertoire of low responder mice we have estimated precursor frequencies of MSV-specific proliferative and cytotoxic T cells after the CD4+ T cell subset was fully reconstituted. There was no difference in the frequencies of control and low responder mice excluding clonal deletion as the mechanism maintaining low responsiveness. In co-culture experiments the defect in low responder mice could be localized to the regenerated CD4+ T cell subset, suggesting the induction of CD4+ suppressor-inducer cells. Alternatively, regenerated CD4+ cells in anti-CD4 conditioned mice had acquired a defect to provide help for MSV-specific responses. In spite of the potentials to induce low responsiveness to selected Ag by anti-CD4 conditioning, the risk to cause persistent virus-specific immunodeficiency might limit the clinical application of anti-CD4 therapy.\r"

Dehydration-rehydration vesicle (DRV) liposomes were used as adjuvants. In optimization experiments phospholipid composition of DRV was varied, and the distearoyl derivative (DSPC) (liquid-crystalline phase transition temperature (Tc) 54 degrees C) of egg lecithin L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine was found to be superior to the dipalmitoyl derivative (DPPC, Tc 41.5 degrees C) and underivatized L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine (Tc -10 degrees C). The criteria studied were in vivo priming for a secondary in vitro proliferative response and the prepatency of lesion onset after L. major challenge of mice immunized once i.v. A single s.c. immunization with SLV39 either free or entrapped within DSPC liposomes primed spleen cells to produce significant levels of IL-3 when stimulated with SLV39 in vitro. In contrast, the i.v. route of immunization with the same Ag preparations led to little or no IL-3 production by the spleen cells. Despite development of significant T cell activation, both SLV39 and SVJ2 administered s.c., either free or entrapped within liposomes, were not protective. However, i.v. immunization four times with SVJ2 entrapped within DSPC liposomes induced a level of resistance comparable with that of 2 x 10(7) gamma-irradiated promastigotes in the stringent BALB/c L. major model. Although significant, protection conferred after i.v. immunization with SLV39/DSPC liposomes was less effective. These data therefore show that DSPC/DRV liposomes, although a good adjuvant for inducing protective immunity to cutaneous leishmaniasis, are not able to overcome the requirement for an i.v. route of immunization with the leishmanial Ag preparation. Additionally, they demonstrate a correlation between IL-3 secretion and non-protection. They also suggest that SVJ2 represents a better source of protective Ag than SLV39.\r"

  ".W": "Viral pathogenicity may be regulated by host defense mechanisms at the virus-immune cell interaction level. The immune system plays an important role in the outcome of acute disease induced by the mouse hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV3) virus. The lymphoid cells act as effectors in the virus elimination as well as targets for viral replication. In order to demonstrate a correlation between MHV3 pathogenicity and viral replication in lymphocytes, genetically-determined resistant A/J and susceptible C57BL/6 mice were infected with pathogenic (L2-MHV3) or nonpathogenic (YAC-MHV3) viral strains. Pathogenicity and histopathologic studies have revealed that lymphoid organs such as thymus and spleen, showed injuries or atrophy in susceptible mice infected with L2-MHV3. No histopathologic lesions in the lymphoid organs occurred in C57BL/6 mice infected with YAC-MHV3 or A/J mice infected with both viruses. The mechanisms involved in the lymphoid injuries were studied regarding viral replication in the lymphoid organs and cells in infected mice. Results indicate that cell depletion in lymphoid organs is caused by a complete viral replication in lymphoid cells. Thy1.2+ and surface IgM+ lymphoid cells from susceptible C57BL/6 mice infected with L2-MHV3 were permissive to viral replication and to subsequent cell lysis. No cell lysis, however, occurred in lymphoid cells from C57BL/6 mice infected with YAC-MHV3 and A/J mice infected with both virus strains. In vitro studies, with purified T and B cell populations were performed to determine the mechanism effecting susceptibility or resistance to viral-induced cell lysis occurring in such cells. A blockade, probably occurring at the viral RNA polymerase activity level, prevents viral replication in resistant cells between the stages of fixation of the virus at the cell-surface receptor and the viral protein translation. These experiments indicate that an intrinsic virus-specific resistant mechanism occurs in lymphoid cells that plays a major role in the viral pathogenicity.\r"

In the cells of HTLV-I-integrated T cell lines, messages of lck were not detected in IL-2-independent lines, although found profusely in IL-2-dependent ones. The results of nuclear transcription assay indicated that lck expression is shut off at the stage of transcription in those cell lines. RNA products of the viral PX region were not detectable in two out of five HTLV-I+, IL-2-independent lines, suggesting that PX gene products themselves exert no direct effect on the block of lck transcription in the HTLV-I-infected T cells. Other T cell populations and a T cell line infected with human immunodeficiency virus, on the other hand, showed significant levels of lck message. These data presented the possibility that lck gene product may be one of the intervening molecules which transduce the signal from the IL-2R into the cell interior, and play an important role in the pathophysiology of adult T cell leukemia, especially in the transition of these leukemias from the IL-2-dependent stage to IL-2-independent one for their growth.\r"

The antibodies were analyzed for the expression of idiotypic families that are enriched in the antibodies to DNA from diseased animals (IdGN2 and IdX), and for the expression of VH and V kappa gene segment subfamilies. Most of the mAb have characteristics similar to those that may be pathogenic because they 1) bound to native DNA, 2) were of the IgG2a or IgG2b isotype, and 3) expressed idiotopes associated with glomerulonephritis in NZB/NZW mice and human lupus. Among the 18 mAb, at least six VH subfamilies and six V kappa subfamilies were expressed. A majority of the antibodies utilized a VH gene segment from the large J558 subfamily. Slot blot analyses of total spleen cell RNA revealed that as NZB/NZW mice aged and developed nephritis, they expressed progressively higher quantities of Ig transcripts. The proportion of these transcripts derived from the VH J558 subfamily also increased. Our results indicate that a diversity of B cell clones participate in the anti-DNA response of a single NZB/NZW mouse. There was no preferential utilization of 3' Ig V gene segment subfamilies. Furthermore, there was no marked difference in the pattern of VH and V kappa gene segment expression in antibodies defined by their isotypes or idiotopes.\r"

We evaluated the number and function of epidermal antigen-presenting cells contained in epidermal cell suspensions obtained from normal and irritant patch test reaction sites. Application of sodium lauryl sulfate or croton oil to human skin in vivo resulted in a progressive depletion in the number of epidermal OKT6+HLA-DR+ (T6+DR+) Langerhans cells (LC) from 3.1 +/- 0.2% of total epidermal cells (EC) to 1.2 +/- 0.1% after 8 d (mean values +/- SEM, N = 9). Between 1-4 d irritant patch test sites demonstrated an influx of non-Langerhans cell T6-DR+ cells. These cells were not DR+ keratinocytes but appeared to be of bone marrow derivation because they expressed the marker, HLe1. Among bone marrow derived cells, the T6-DR+EC appeared to be of monocyte, macrophage lineage, because they expressed the determinant recognized by the OKM5 (M5) antibody. Despite the induction of M5+DR+EC the total number of DR+EC showed progressively decreasing percentages over an 8-d period. Partial recovery to 73 +/- 12% of control value was observed at 2 weeks, with full recovery by 4 weeks after challenge. Concomitantly with the depletion of DR+EC, the capacity of EC to present alloantigens to T cells decreased. This reduction in antigen-presenting cell activity was strongly correlated to the reduction in total DR+ EC (r = 0.94, p less than 0.05). Thus, the capacity of irritants such as croton oil to abrogate the function of epidermal antigen-presenting cells may be related to the tumor promoting potential of these agents.\r"

In contrast to the effects of long-term vitamin excess, a large vitamin A bolus did not cause immune response impairment and, on the contrary, restored normal immune functions in previously vitamin A-depleted chicks. This finding implied a regulatory role for vitamin A in the immune system rather than a constitutive one.\r"

Thirty-four patients, ranging in age from 27 to 61 months, were vaccinated with either Hib polysaccharide (n = 20) or Hib polysaccharide-outer membrane protein conjugate vaccine (n = 14). All but three of the children had normal serum concentrations of immunoglobulins, including IgG2. The geometric mean serum anticapsular antibody concentration of the group given polysaccharide vaccine increased from 0.27 microgram/ml before vaccination to 0.65 microgram/ml 1 month later (p less than 0.05), but the magnitude of the response was nearly 10-fold less than that of 31 age-matched control children given polysaccharide vaccine (6.3 micrograms/ml, p less than 0.001). In contrast, all 14 patients with vaccine failure who were given conjugate vaccine showed increases of fivefold or more in serum anticapsular antibody (geometric means 0.35 and 12.8 micrograms/ml, respectively; p less than 0.001). All patients with vaccine failure who did not respond to polysaccharide vaccine were subsequently given conjugate vaccine, and all had high antibody responses. Most patients tested showed increases in complement-mediated serum bactericidal activity. These data suggest that immunization with conjugate vaccine confers protection against Hib disease to children who, because of genetic or other reasons, cannot respond to the unconjugated form of the polysaccharide vaccine.\r"

The total serum calcium concentration was measured in all patients. The serum ionized calcium concentration was measured in blood samples collected from those 71 (49%) patients who had low total serum calcium values (less than 8.5 mg/dl (2.12 mmol/L). Of the 71 patients, 26 (36.6%) had ionized hypocalcemia. Therefore the prevalence of ionized hypocalcemia was at least 17.9% (26/145). Death occurred in 8 (31%) of 26 patients with ionized hypocalcemia versus 3 (2.5%) of 119 patients with normocalcemia (p less than 0.0001). However, the severity of illness score was higher (p less than 0.05) in the children with ionized hypocalcemia than in normocalcemic children (mean Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System score 33 +/- 17 vs 22 +/- 11, respectively). More of the children with ionized hypocalcemia had sepsis (p = 0.0299) and they required the administration of vasopressor agents more often (p = 0.0002) than their normocalcemic counterparts. Of the 26 patients with ionized hypocalcemia, 17 (65.4%) had biochemical evidence of either absolute or relative hypoparathyroidism, determined by means of an immunoradiometric assay that measures only biologically active parathyroid hormone. We conclude the following: (1) ionized hypocalcemia is common in severely ill children. (2) Patients with ionized hypocalcemia have a higher mortality rate than those with normocalcemia; however, because the former are more severely ill, no causality is apparent or suggested. (3) Functional hypoparathyroidism may occur in critically ill children.\r"

Low baseline hemoglobin level (p less than 0.001) and poor performance status as measured by the Karnofsky scale (p less than 0.01) independently predicted unsuccessful outcome and early death. Low hemoglobin (p = 0.001), low platelet count (p = 0.016), and increased time since PCP (p = 0.008) predicted development of drug toxicity.

For data from April to June 1985, 1986, and 1987, the crude prevalence of anti-HIV-1 was 7.1, 7.7, and 7.0%, respectively. Although one-third of incoming inmates were identified as intravenous drug users (IVDUs), the drug use variable was missing for 70% of the 1985 sample, and 40% of the 1986 sample. Several strategies were used to examined temporal trends in the context of missing data. Univariate analyses suggested no substantial change over time for either HIV-1 seroprevalence or risk of infection among IVDUs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In 79 homosexual men infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), urinary neopterin was significantly higher as compared with 70 HIV-seronegative men in the same cohort (p less than 0.0001). This highly significant association was found both for naturally occurring oxidized (native) neopterin and for total neopterin (native plus chemically oxidized forms). In prospective follow-up for 18 months, the odds that the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) would develop were elevated 25-fold among those whose native neopterin levels were in the highest quartile compared with those with lower neopterin levels, and the corresponding odds ratio for total neopterin was 7.8. Logistic regression analyses indicated that neopterin added useful information to T4-cell count in predicting AIDS onset and that both are statistically significant in the multivariate model. A cross-sectional survey revealed that neopterin levels were correlated with number of receptive anal intercourse partners in the year before HIV seroconversion (r = 0.60, p = 0.0005). Since neopterin may serve as a marker of monocyte/macrophage activation by soluble factors such as gamma-interferon, these data support a growing body of virologic and immunologic evidence that highlights the important role of the monocyte/macrophage in the pathogenesis of AIDS.\r"

Continuously infusing the D1 agonists, SKF 38393, SKF 75670 and Cy 208-243 with the use of implanted Alzet minipumps initially produced rotational behavior, but this effect decreased during the first 2 days and then stopped completely during days 3 to 7 of drug infusion. Infusion of the D2 agonists quinpirole and N-0437 also produced rotational behavior but, in contrast to the results seen with the D1 agonists, the rotational response remained present throughout the 7 days of drug exposure. The desensitization produced by continuous exposure to SKF 38393 was selective for the D1 system, as animals exposed continuously to SKF 38393 failed to rotate to an acute challenge dose of SKF 38393 but had a normal rotational response to quinpirole. SKF 75670 and CY 208-243 were less selective than SKF 38393; continuous exposure to SKF 75670 and CY 208-243 decreased the response to an acute injection of D1-agonists by 98 and 95%, respectively, and to that of D2-agonists by 64 and 38%, respectively. Infusing the peripherally acting D1 agonist, fenoldopam, or the inactive isomer (-)-SKF 38393 failed to produce desensitization, suggesting that SKF 38393-induced desensitization is produced by an action at D1 receptors within the central nervous system. These results demonstrate that the D1 system can be desensitized independently from the D2 system and that there are different mechanisms for the long term regulation of D1 and D2 dopaminergic systems.\r"

These changes were not associated with age differences alone in 2 nonautoimmune strains. Active murine SLE is thus associated with significant depressions in both hepatic cytochrome P-450 levels and microsomal enzyme activities. The metabolism of drugs and endogenous substrates may thus be impaired in active SLE.\r"

The overall incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation was 28.4%, with the major occurrence 2 days after the operation. Both univariate and multivariate studies indicated the patient's age to be the dominant factor promoting postoperative atrial fibrillation, with an increasing prevalence in older patients (p = 0.0001). Multivariate analysis showed that postoperative beta-blocker therapy conveyed considerable protection against postoperative atrial fibrillation (p = 0.001) but was less effective in the older patients. Men were more prone to this arrhythmia (p = 0.02). Although these associations appeared significant, the logistic model proved to be a poor predictor of postoperative atrial fibrillation, which suggests that other factors not studied, or mere chance, may also be responsible.\r"

  ".W": "The excellent results of coronary artery bypass with the internal mammary artery and the increasing numbers of patients who need coronary reoperations, but for whom conventional bypass conduits are not available, have prompted us to evaluate alternative arterial bypass conduits. The right gastroepiploic artery has been used as a coronary bypass graft in 36 patients (32 men), whose ages ranged from 29 to 71 years. Twenty-two patients had had previous coronary bypass grafting and six of these were undergoing their third bypass operation. The right gastroepiploic artery was used as an in situ graft to the right coronary artery or circumflex branches for 17 patients and as an aorta-coronary (\"free\") graft in 19 patients, six to the left anterior descending or diagonal, six to the circumflex, and seven to the right coronary artery. In conjunction with right gastroepiploic artery grafting, 16 patients received bilateral internal mammary artery grafts and 17 received one internal mammary artery graft. Histologically, right gastroepiploic artery segments from 18 patients could not be distinguished from internal mammary artery segments, and no evidence of atherosclerosis was found. Two patients died in the hospital, one intraoperatively and one 3 months after the operation, of a perioperative stroke. Perioperative morbidity included wound complication in three and reexploration for bleeding in two. At late follow-up 1 to 38 months after operation, two late deaths had occurred and 21 patients were free of symptoms. Postoperative angiography (postoperative interval 1 week to 13 months) was performed in nine grafts, three in situ grafts to the right coronary artery and six free grafts that included two to the left anterior descending, three to the circumflex, and one to the right coronary artery. All right gastroepiploic artery grafts were patient. The right gastroepiploic artery is an arterial conduit that can be used as an in situ graft to posterior coronary vessels and as a free graft to any coronary arterial system. Early graft patency has been excellent, and the histologic similarity between the right gastroepiploic artery and the internal mammary artery suggest that the long-term results will be favorable.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of hemoconcentration performed during and after extracorporeal circulation by either centrifugation (cell separation group, n = 20) or hemofiltration (n = 20) were investigated in 40 patients undergoing elective aorta-coronary bypass grafting. Interest was focused on the quality of the blood concentrated from the blood remaining in the extracorporeal circuit and on the reaction of the patients after retransfusion of the concentrated products. Hemofiltration was easy to perform and produced whole blood quicker than the cell separation technique. Coagulation studies revealed no significant differences in heparin concentration, levels of fibrinogen and antithrombin III, or platelet counts. Various coagulation parameters tended to normalize completely and more quickly after hemofiltration than after centrifugation. None of the patients had severe bleeding postoperatively. Free hemoglobin levels were not affected by hemofiltration; elastase concentration was higher only immediately after retransfusion of the concentrated blood, with no effect on organ function. We conclude that both methods were effective means of hemoconcentration during extracorporeal circulation and in salvaging the diluted pump blood after extracorporeal circulation. Loss of plasma fraction is an important disadvantage in the centrifugation technique, which can be avoided by hemofiltration; derangement in colloid osmotic pressure and coagulation parameters was less pronounced after hemofiltration. Costs were lower, as well. Therefore, when a high volume of cardioplegic solution and two-stage cannulation are used, hemofiltration seems to be the method of choice for blood conservation during cardiac operations.\r"

For up to one year, we followed the 475 infants of the 466 seropositive women (5.8 percent of those screened) and the 616 infants of 606 seronegative women matched for age, parity, and hospital. On the basis of clinical criteria, 85 of the seropositive women (18 percent) had the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The infants of seropositive mothers, as compared with those of seronegative mothers, were more frequently premature, had lower birth weights, and had a higher death rate in the first 28 days (6.2 vs. 1.2 percent; P less than 0.0001). The patterns were similar at the two hospitals. Twenty-one percent of the cultures for HIV-1 of 92 randomly selected cord-blood samples from infants of seropositive women were positive. T4-cell counts were performed in 37 seropositive women, and cord blood from their infants was cultured. The cultures were positive in the infants of 6 of the 18 women with antepartum T4 counts of 400 or fewer cells per cubic millimeter, as compared with none of the infants of the 19 women with more than 400 T4 cells per cubic millimeter (P = 0.02). One year later, 21 percent of the infants of the seropositive mothers had died as compared with 3.8 percent of the control infants (P less than 0.001), and 7.9 percent of their surviving infants had AIDS. We conclude that the mortality rates among children of seropositive mothers are high regardless of socioeconomic status, and that perinatal transmission of HIV-1 has a major adverse effect on infant survival in Kinshasa.\r"

  ".W": "The CD2 T lymphocyte-surface glycoprotein serves to mediate adhesion between T lymphocytes and their cognate cellular partners which express the specific ligand LFA-3. In addition, CD2 by itself or in conjunction with T-cell receptor stimulation, transduces signals resulting in T-lymphocyte activation. One or both of these functions seems to be physiologically important, given that certain anti-CD2 monoclonal antibodies block T-cell activation and that antigen-responsive memory T cells express a high level of CD2 relative to virgin T cells, which are largely antigen-unresponsive. Nevertheless, the contribution of the individual CD2 functions in T-cell responses has not been independently examined. To this end, human CD2 complementary DNAs encoding an intact LFA-3-binding adhesion domain, but lacking a functional cytoplasmic signal transduction element (CD2trans-), were introduced into an ovalbumin-specific, I-Ad restricted murine T-cell hybridoma. The antigen-specific response of T hybridoma cells expressing human CD2trans- protein was enhanced up to 400% when the human LFA-3 ligand was introduced into the I-Ad expressing murine antigen-presenting cells. In contrast, no augmentation was observed if human LFA-3 was absent or expressed on a third-party cell lacking the I-Ad restriction element. These results directly demonstrate the functional significance of adhesion events mediated between CD2 on the antigen-responsive T lymphocyte and LFA-3 on the presenting cell in optimizing antigen-specific T-cell activation.\r"

Neuroglia have receptors for neurotransmitters which may be involved in neuron-glia interactions. Recent studies have demonstrated voltage-gated ion channels in glial membranes. In a study of the optic nerve of the frog, small areas of the surface were examined with the loose patch-clamp method, and voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels, presumably located in the membranes of the astrocytes forming the glia limitans, were identified. We now report that nerve impulses in the axons of the frog optic nerve transiently alter the properties of the voltage-dependent membrane channels of the surface glial cells (astrocytes), a demonstration of a new form of neuron-glia interaction.\r"

In HIV-infected humans, T-cell proliferative responses are lost soon after infection. Here we demonstrate that interleukin-2 production is often retained even when proliferative activity is absent, and that it can be used to monitor T-helper cell responses by HIV-seropositive donors. We use this approach to investigate the T-helper cell response of 42 asymptomatic HIV-seropositive patients to four synthetic gp160 peptides and to influenza A virus, an antigen requiring intact CD4 T-helper cell function. As many as 67% of the HIV-seropositive donors who retain responsiveness to influenza A virus respond to a single peptide, and 85-90% responded to at least one of the peptides.\r"

None of the SIV strains characterized so far are closely related to HIV-1. HIV-2, however, is closely related to SIV (SIVmac) isolated from captive rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). SIV infection of feral Asian macaques has not been demonstrated by serological surveys. Thus, macaques may have acquired SIV in captivity by cross-species transmission from an SIV-infected African primate. Sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys), an African primate species indigenous to West Africa, however, are infected with SIV (SIVsm) both in captivity and in the wild (P. Fultz, personal communication). We have molecularly cloned and sequenced SIVsm and report here that it is closely related to SIVmac and HIV-2. These results suggest that SIVsm has infected macaques in captivity and humans in West Africa and evolved as SIVmac and HIV-2, respectively.\r"

The formation of complexes between various immunologically active peptides and different MHC molecules has been demonstrated directly in binding studies between the peptides and solubilized, purified molecules of class II MHC. Studies with intact cells, living or fixed, have not directly demonstrated the binding of the peptides to MHC molecules on antigen-presenting cells, but the formation of such complexes has been shown indirectly through the capacity of antigen-presenting cells to stimulate specific T cells. Here we report evidence that supports directly the binding of radiolabelled influenza matrix peptide 17-29 to products of the human class II MHC locus HLA-DR, on living homozygous B-cell lines, and we show that the kinetics of such binding is much faster with living cells than with fixed cells. Furthermore, whereas the peptide reacts with HLA-DR molecules of all alleles, it binds preferentially to DR1, the restricting element in antigen presentation.\r"

The binding of peptides to MHC class II molecules has been demonstrated directly, and is found to correlate with the ability of specific class II alleles to restrict the T-cell response to specific peptides. By comparison, a direct demonstration of a physical association between antigenic peptides and MHC class I molecules has proved difficult. A recent report shows that it is possible, however, and the three-dimensional structure of a class I MHC molecule illustrates the site where such binding must occur. Here we describe a simple assay which measures the binding of radiolabelled MHC class I molecules to peptides bound to a solid phase support. We find that class I molecules bind specifically to peptides known to be antigenic for class I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Peptides which are recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes bind not only to the restricting MHC class I molecule but also to other class I molecules. Our results suggest that quantitative differences in the peptide/MHC class I interaction may influence the-pattern of MHC restriction observed in vivo.\r"

There were no differences in degree of temperature reduction with acetaminophen between the bacteremic and nonbacteremic groups of infants. Among infants with bacteremia but without meningitis, differences from nonbacteremic children were detected in clinical appearance prior to fever reduction but not following defervescence. All patients with meningitis appeared seriously ill before and after defervescence. It was concluded that clinical improvement with defervescence is not a reliable indicator of the presence of occult bacteremia. Lack of clinical improvement with defervescence may be a reliable indicator for the presence of meningitis. Because there were differences in clinical appearance prior to fever reduction, routine administration of acetaminophen may interfere with the clinical evaluation by the physician.\r"

With this system, a synthetic gene for human epidermal growth factor (hEGF) was expressed efficiently and a large amount (0.24 g per liter of culture) of mature hEGF was secreted into the medium. hEGF purified from the culture supernatant had the same NH2-terminal amino acid sequence, COOH-terminal amino acid, and amino acid composition as natural hEGF, and it was fully active in biological assays. These results, in combination with previous results, showed that mammalian proteins can be produced in active form 10-100 times more efficiently in B. brevis than has been reported in other systems.\r"

By use of an adaptation of the polymerase chain reaction, vWF mRNA was amplified and sequenced from peripheral blood platelets. A silent vWF allele was identified, resulting from a cis defect in vWF mRNA transcription or processing. In two type IIA vWD patients, two different but adjacent missense mutations were identified, the locations of which may identify an important vWF functional domain. Expression in heterologous cells of recombinant vWF containing one of these latter mutations reproduced the characteristic structural abnormality seen in type IIA vWD plasma.\r"

When the labile covalent bonds linking antibody to dextran bridge were stabilized by reduction, the therapeutic efficacy of the conjugate was markedly decreased. These results show that antibodies against the extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor can deliver doxorubicin specifically and efficiently to tumor sites that express high receptor levels exerting a specific antitumor effect.\r"

We now demonstrate that patients produce anti-anti-idiotypic antibodies (Ab3) to their autologous Ab2. Ab3 were demonstrated in culture supernatants of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from five Ab1-treated patients after stimulation of the cells with heterologous Ab2 that functionally mimicked the tumor antigen (Ag) defined by Ab1 and immunologically cross reacted with the patients' Ab2. Ab3 shared idiotopes with Ab1 and were Ab1-like in their binding specificities to tumor cells, Ag, and Ab2. Such antibodies were also elicited by stimulating cells with Ag. However, they were not produced by stimulating posttreatment mononuclear cells with control proteins or by stimulating pretreatment cells with either Ag or Ab2. Our results demonstrate idiotypic cascades in cancer patients treated with monoclonal antibody. Ag-specific Ab3 responses may underlie delayed clinical responses often observed in cancer patients treated with monoclonal antibodies of various specificities.\r"

  ".W": "Stimulated human monocytes/macrophages are a source of mediators such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 1 (IL-1), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which can modulate inflammatory and immune reactions. Therefore, the ability to control the production of such mediators by monocytes/macrophages may have therapeutic benefits, and it has been proposed that glucocorticoids may act in this way. Purified human monocytes, when stimulated in vitro with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or with LPS and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), produce TNF-alpha, IL-1, and PGE2. Cotreatment of stimulated cells with the purified human lymphokine, interleukin 4 (IL-4 greater than or equal to 0.1-0.5 unit/ml; 12-60 pM) dramatically blocked the increased levels of these three mediators; for TNF-alpha and IL-1, the inhibition was manifest at the level of mRNA. Thus, IL-4 can suppress some parameters of monocyte activation and, as for B cells, have opposite effects to IFN-gamma. The effects of IL-4 on human monocytes are similar to those obtained with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (0.1 microM).\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate human umbilical cord blood as an alternative to bone marrow in the provision of transplantable stem/progenitor cells for hematopoietic reconstitution. Although no direct quantitative assay for human hematopoietic repopulating cells is at present available, the granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cell (CFU-GM) assay has been used with success as a valid indicator of engrafting capability. We examined greater than 100 collections of human umbilical cord blood for their content of nucleated cells and granulocyte-macrophage, erythroid (BFU-E), and multipotential (CFU-GEMM) progenitor cells, in many cases both before and after cryopreservation. First it was determined that granulocyte-macrophage, erythroid, and multipotential progenitor cells remained functionally viable in cord blood untreated except for addition of anticoagulant for at least 3 days at 4 degrees C or 25 degrees C (room temperature), though not at 37 degrees C, implying that these cells could be satisfactorily studied and used or cryopreserved for therapy after transport of cord blood by overnight air freight carriage from a remote obstetrical service. Granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells from cord blood so received responded normally to stimulation by purified recombinant preparations of granulocyte-macrophage, granulocyte, and macrophage colony-stimulating factors and interleukin 3. The salient finding, based on analysis of 101 cord blood collections, is that the numbers of progenitor cells present in the low-density (less than 1.077 gm/ml) fraction after Ficoll/Hypaque separation typically fell within the range that has been reported for successful engraftment by bone marrow cells. Another observation of practical importance is that procedures to remove erythrocytes or granulocytes prior to freezing, and washing of thawed cells before plating, entailed large losses of progenitor cells, the yield of unwashed progenitor cells from unfractionated cord blood being many times greater. The provisional inference is that human umbilical cord blood from a single individual is typically a sufficient source of cells for autologous (syngeneic) and for major histocompatibility complex-matched allogeneic hematopoietic reconstitution.\r"

  ".W": "Plant genes usually have multiple potential poly(A) addition signals, and different sites are used for 3' processing of transcripts from a single gene. In contrast, we show here that four barley genes that also have multiple poly(A) addition signals conforming to the plant consensus use only one signal. In each of these genes, the region of cleavage for poly(A) addition is centered on a conserved pentanucleotide. This AGGCA is followed by a conserved sequence homologous to sequences involved in self-cleavage of plant viroid RNA precursors; immediately following, in turn, are four or five nucleotides complementary to the nucleotides immediately preceding AGGCA in each gene. The presence of these conserved sequences and their association with a single region for poly(A) addition in three different gene types (high-pI and low-pI alpha-amylase genes and a thiol protease) that otherwise are not homologous in their 3' untranslated/flanking sequences suggest that they might participate in some common regulatory mechanism shared by these genes.\r"

We report that an 18-amino acid peptide derived from the core nucleic acid binding protein from Rauscher murine leukemia virus binds metal ions such as Co2+ and Zn2+. The absorption spectrum of the peptide-Co2+ complex is highly suggestive of tetrahedral coordination involving three cysteinates and one histidine. Titration experiments indicate that the dissociation constant for the peptide-Co2+ complex is 1.0 microM and that Zn2+ binds more tightly than Co2+. A detailed three-dimensional structure for this domain based on conserved substructures in other crystallographically characterized metalloproteins and on a detailed analysis of the Cys-Xaa2-Cys-Xaa4-His-Xaa4-Cys sequences from retroviruses and other related sources is proposed.\r"

  ".U": "89264563\r", 
  ".W": "The expression of the gamma 2 class of viral genes in cells infected with herpes simplex virus 1 requires viral DNA synthesis and functional viral products made earlier in infection. To identify the sequences required for gamma 2 gene expression, we constructed recombinant viruses in which regions of the thymidine kinase gene (tk), a beta gene normally expressed early in infection, were replaced by specific domains of a gamma 2 gene. The phenotypic attributes examined were (i) sensitivity or resistance of expression in cells exposed to sufficient phosphonoacetate to block viral DNA synthesis, properties of gamma 2 and beta genes, respectively; (ii) expression early in infection, a property of beta genes; and (iii) expression late in infection, a property of gamma 2 genes. We report that replacement of nucleotides -200 to +51 of tk with nucleotides -77 to +104 of the gamma 2 gene conferred upon tk all of the tested attributes of gamma 2 genes. The tk sequence in the 5' transcribed noncoding domain downstream of nucleotide +51 played no apparent role in the expression of the chimeric genes. Similarly, tk sequence downstream of -16 and gamma 2 sequence upstream of -12, when juxtaposed in correct orientations, yielded a chimeric gene that was poorly expressed. In contrast, the chimeric gene consisting of tk sequence upstream of -16 fused to gamma 2 sequence downstream of -12 had the attributes of both beta and gamma 2 genes in that it was expressed both early and late in infection and was partially resistant to phosphonoacetate. The capacity for expression late in infection encoded in the gamma 2 5' transcribed noncoding domain was observed in cells infected with a recombinant virus in which gamma 2 nucleotides +17 to +104 were inserted into the 5' transcribed noncoding domain of the tk gene. We conclude that whereas in the beta genes exemplified by the tk gene the regulatory domains are mainly upstream from nucleotide +51, the sequence(s) that confers gamma 2 regulation is downstream from the TATAA box.\r"

Synthetic phospholipids were added as liposomes. Dilinoleoyl phosphatidic acid or phosphatidylserine or epidermal growth factor stimulated multifold growth. The optimum mitogenic effect of the phospholipids was dependent upon the presence of a polyunsaturated fatty acid esterified to the sn-2 position of the glycerol moiety. Dilinoleoyl phosphatidylcholine also stimulated growth but was generally less stimulatory than phosphatidylserine or phosphatidic acid, and phosphatidylethanolamine did not stimulate growth. Studies using phospholipids radiolabeled in either the sn-2 fatty acyl group or the glycerol backbone showed that the relative effect of phospholipids on growth did not correlate directly with the extent of their incorporation into cellular lipid, indicating that phospholipid turnover was the more important determinant for mitogenesis. Analysis of phosphatidic acid-stimulated growth suggested that both cAMP-dependent and cAMP-independent pathways were involved. Thus, mitogenic phospholipids stimulate proliferation by activating (directly or indirectly) multiple growth-regulatory pathways in mammary epithelial cells.\r"
