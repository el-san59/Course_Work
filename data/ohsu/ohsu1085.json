  ".W": "Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), virus culture (V), antigen detection (Ag), and in vitro antibody production (IVAP) assays may be useful for the early detection of vertically transmitted HIV-1 infection in infants under 18 months of age, when a diagnosis cannot be based on seropositivity because of maternal antibody persistence. To assess the reliability of these procedures and to correlate diagnostic results with infection status, 101 children born to HIV-1-seropositive mothers were evaluated by all these techniques within the first 6 months of life. The children were then followed up to the age of at least 18 months, when diagnosis was made on the basis of AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC) onset or persistence of HIV-1 seropositivity. Out of 27 children classified as infected according to the above criteria, 25 (92.5%) were repeatedly positive in IVAP test, 22 (81.5%) in the first PCR analysis, and only 19 (70.3%) in the initial V assay. On further testing, a total of 24 children (88.9%) were found positive in PCR assay, and 23 (85.2%) in V test. All these assays were found to be more sensitive than antigen detection for HIV-1 infection diagnosis, but the antigenaemia was shown to be a useful prognostic marker of disease onset. We also found that both Ag and IVAP assays could give false-positive results in the first 2 months of life, which severely limits their diagnostic value during this period of time. False-positive results in PCR assay could occur at any time of the tested period and were unrelated to the child's age.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

PMEA causes a dose-dependent suppression of the induction of anti-SIVmacgp120 antibodies in SIV mac-infected rhesus monkeys. Complete suppression of anti-SIVmacgp120 antibodies was achieved in SIV-infected animals treated with PMEA at 2 x 10 or 2 x 5 mg/kg per day for 29 days. No toxic side-effects were noted during this treatment period. Antibodies against SIVmac gp120 appeared 1-2 weeks after PMEA treatment was stopped, but the antibody titre reached in these animals was significantly lower than in the SIVmac-infected animals who had not been treated with PMEA. Our data strongly suggest that PMEA should be pursued for its potential in the treatment of AIDS and other retrovirus infections.\r"

However, unlike findings reported for HIV-1-infected T cells, this decrease was not accompanied by a similar reduction in levels of CD4 transcripts. OKT4 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to CD4 were used in immunoprecipitation experiments to show that intracellular CD4 levels were diminished in U-937 monocytic cells that had been infected by HIV-1. These MAbs also coprecipitated viral gp120, indicating that CD4-gp120 complexes are present in infected monocytes. Our results therefore demonstrate that cell-surface down-modulation of CD4 is exclusively a post-transcriptional event in HIV-1 infected monocytic cells. These data suggest that HIV-1-mediated depletion of cell-surface CD4 in monocytes does not involve transcript down-modulation as has been reported in T lymphocytes.\r"

We investigated the effect of long-term (2-year) zidovudine treatment on these immunological markers in a group of nine asymptomatic p24-antigenaemic men, five of whom progressed to AIDS. A group of 10 untreated HIV-infected men, five of whom progressed to AIDS, was studied as a control. At intake, 1 year before the start of treatment, CD4+ T-cell numbers in the groups were not significantly different. However, at that time progressors already exhibited an extremely low anti-CD3-induced T-cell responsiveness compared with non-progressors. In all people T-cell responsiveness and the number of CD4+ T-cells had improved 6 months after the start of zidovudine treatment. However, CD4+ T-cell numbers were not persistently elevated, and restoration of T-cell responsiveness was of only short duration. Our results show that zidovudine treatment in the asymptomatic phase of HIV infection did not result in a sustained improvement in T-cell function. Furthermore, they suggest that differences in clinical course among zidovudine-treated asymptomatics may be caused by heterogeneity of this group with respect to T-cell functional capacity at the start of treatment.\r"

The method integrated use of a personal computer to find exact matches on names and dates of birth with manual review to assure satisfaction of a match definition. Of the factors examined, white race and homosexuality predicted Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) among people with AIDS (PWAs), and white race predicted non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Earlier reports of a declining proportion of PWAs with KS were confirmed. Lymphoma (mixed lymphocytic/histiocytic type), while not currently diagnostic of AIDS, occurred more frequently among PWAs than in the Illinois population. For the first time, rates of cancers other than KS and NHL were demonstrated to be significantly increased among PWAs compared with general populations. In the light of these findings, reconsideration of current neoplastic definitions may be useful.\r"

A minority of the respondents were in favour of testing all patients. The majority felt that patients in the high-risk groups should be tested. The percentage in favour of anonymous testing was considerably higher among the doctors than among the nurses. Most of the doctors and nurses were concerned about contagion by patients. This concern had a negative influence on their attitudes toward AIDS. Factual information alone does not suffice to dispel excessive concern. In training and educating medical personnel, attention should be devoted to cognitive as well as emotional aspects.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effect of an HIV-1 counselling program on 149 married Zairian couples with discordant HIV-1 serology, the rates of HIV-1 seroconversion and reported condom utilization have been observed during 382.4 person-years of follow-up (minimum follow-up time per couple of 6 months). Before determination of HIV-1 serostatus and counselling, less than 5% of these couples had ever used a condom. One month after notification of HIV-1 serostatus and counselling, 70.7% of couples reported using condoms during all episodes of sexual intercourse. At 18 months follow-up, 77.4% of the 140 couples still being followed reported continued use of condoms during all episodes of sexual intercourse. At the time of notification of HIV-1 serostatus, 18 couples experienced acute psychological distress. Home-based counselling by trained nurses resolved these difficulties in all but three couples who subsequently divorced. Intensive counselling following notification of HIV-1 serostatus led to low rates of HIV-1 seroconversion (3.1% per 100 person-years of observation) in Zairian married couples with discordant HIV-1 serostatus who voluntarily attended an HIV counselling center.\r"

Eight-seven (24.6%) were infected with HIV-2 only, two (0.6%) with HIV-1 only, four (1.1%) had sera showing double HIV-1/HIV-2 reactivity, and 37 (10.4%) were seropositive for HTLV-I. After allowing for socioeconomic and serological variables in a multivariate analysis, HIV-2 infection was associated with serological evidence of a previous episode of syphilis [a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) positive/Treponema pallidum haemagglutination assay (TPHA) positive; odds ratio (OR) = 2.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.19-3.98], with having antibodies against Haemophilus ducreyi (OR = 2.05, 95% CI = 0.89-4.70) or against HTLV-I (OR = 2.17, 95% CI = 0.91-5.19). HIV-2-seropositive prostitutes were three times more likely [17 out of 78 (22%) versus 15 out of 219 (7%), P less than 0.001] to have generalized lymphadenopathy than those who were seronegative. These data suggest that genital ulcer diseases may facilitate the transmission of HIV-2, and that HIV-2 rapidly induces the appearance of generalized lymphadenopathy in a substantial proportion of infected individuals.\r"

Over two-thirds said they never used condoms. More of the black respondents had not been enrolled in treatment. White IVDUs were more likely to report 10 or more partners, anal sex, and a steady drug-injecting partner; black respondents more often reported prostitution. More men said they never used condoms, and more women said they engaged in prostitution. These high-risk sexual behaviors were significantly and independently associated with ethnicity or gender when other sociodemographic variables were held constant. Sexual risk reduction for IVDUs, focusing on condom use, needs to be expanded to reach non-injecting partners. Intervention is critical for the black community, where a high proportion of IVDUs have steady non-injecting partners.\r"

To determine whether these protozoa could transmit HIV, laboratory strains of protozoa were cocultured with cells chronically infected by a highly replicative strain of HIV-1. Entamoeba histolytica, but not Giardia lamblia, took up virus. Immunologically detectable HIV-1 was present in the amebae up to 48 h after exposure to infected cells, but this virus could not be transferred to uninfected human cells. Amebae isolated directly from two HIV-infected individuals were also found to be positive for HIV-1. After lysis of these protozoa and coculture with uninfected peripheral blood mononuclear cells, no transfer of virus to the human cells was observed.\r"

This paper describes the application of recently developed methods to detect epitope specificity of B cells in lymph-node biopsies with antigen-enzyme conjugates. Cryosections of five lymph-node biopsies from HIV-1-infected individuals and four control tissues were stained with a panel of HIV-1 antigen-enzyme conjugates: recombinant HIV-1 proteins (gp 160, gp 120 and p24), labelled with peroxidase, and synthetic peptides representing neutralizing epitopes from gp120 and gp41, labelled with alkaline phosphatase. Antibody-forming cells (AFCs) were detected in all the HIV-1-infected biopsies with gp160, gp120 and/or p24, in numbers up to 350 per section. AFCs producing specific antibodies against peptide 101 (SP 101), representing the neutralizing epitope 586-608 of gp41, were detected in one patient. These techniques allow correlation of in vivo function of B cells with lymph-node pathology, clinical stage of the disease and serological data. Their potential for the elucidation of HIV-related immunopathogenesis and the development of vaccines is discussed.\r"

Using heated samples, neutralizing antibodies were found in 20 out of 20 and 11 out of 19 serum samples of asymptomatic and symptomatic [AIDS, AIDS-related complex (ARC)] HIV-seropositive patients, respectively. In complement-restored samples, neutralizing activity was found in eight sera of asymptomatic patients and in none of the sera of AIDS and ARC patients; enhancing activity could be detected in four and 12 sera, respectively. A significant positive correlation was observed between the titres of neutralizing antibodies measured in the complement-restored samples and the absolute number of CD4+ lymphocytes. These findings indicate that the appearance of complement-dependent enhancing antibodies coincident with the loss of neutralizing antibodies may indicate a poor prognosis in HIV infection.\r"

The current study was designed to determine whether C-mediated 'enhancement' of HIV-1 production was the result of increased virus infection of cells as assessed by provirus formation and virus binding. Virus was incubated with anti-HIV Ab and/or C and added to CR2-positive MT-2 cells. Increased virus expression by MT-2 cells correlated with increased numbers of HIV-immunofluorescent-positive cells at 24 and 48 h and higher levels of provirus detected 8-28 h after infection. MT-2 cells also bound threefold more Ab-plus-C-treated virus than untreated virus. Serial dilutions of C showed that high levels of C with Ab did not enhance but rather suppressed virus expression. Studies were also performed which showed that terminal C components C5 and C8 were not necessary for the enhancing effect. The increased binding of C-coated HIV to CR-positive cells has important implications for the fate of virus in vivo.\r"

Anti-CD4 antibody blocked infection of SW620 cells but had no effect on infection of HT29 cells. In SW620 and HT29 cells transfected with the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) linked to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter gene, an intact HIV-1 enhancer element was required for stimulation of CAT activity by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and phorbol ester. T84 was not able to mediate a TNF alpha or phorbol ester response. These studies provide further evidence that HIV-1 can infect cells by mechanisms other than those mediated by the CD4 receptor and describe complementary models for analyzing HIV-1 infection and expression in colonic epithelial cells.\r"

In HIV-antibody-positive (HIV-Ab+) asymptomatic people, both neopterin and beta 2-microglobulin levels in sera were significantly elevated; in contrast, 2,5A-synthetase activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was not significantly higher than in HIV-antibody-negative controls. The 2,5A-synthetase levels in symptomatic people (AIDS-related complex and AIDS) were significantly higher than in either asymptomatic or control individuals. However, within the group of HIV-infected asymptomatic individuals, all three markers were positively correlated. In this group, neopterin values were negatively correlated with the number of CD4+ lymphocytes while a positive correlation was found between 2,5A-synthetase and the number of CD8+ lymphocytes. Asymptomatic people with detectable serum HIV p24 antigen had significantly higher 2,5A-synthetase, neopterin, beta 2-microglobulin and number of CD8+ lymphocytes. This study suggests that elevated 2,5A-synthetase activity may reflect a different aspect of host response to HIV infection than do elevated neopterin or beta 2-microglobulin.\r"

HIV-1-antibody testing was offered to all women of urban origin delivering a live newborn at the maternity ward of the Centre Hospitalier de Kigali from November 1988 to June 1989; 218 newborns of 215 HIV-positive mothers were matched to 218 newborns of 216 HIV-negative mothers. The matching criteria were maternal age and parity. No differences in socioeconomic characteristics were observed between HIV-positive and HIV-negative women. HIV-positive mothers more frequently reported a history of at least one death of a previously born child (P less than 0.01) and a history of abortion (P less than 0.001). Most of the HIV-positive women were asymptomatic, but 72.4% of them had a CD4; CD8 ratio less than 1 versus 10.1% in the HIV-negative group (P less than 0.001). The frequency of signs and symptoms was not statistically different in the two groups, except for a history of herpes zoster or chronic cough, which was more frequent among HIV-positive women. The rates of prematurity, low birth weight, congenital malformations and neonatal mortality were comparable in the two groups. However, infants of HIV-positive mothers had a mean birth weight 130 g lower than the infants of HIV-negative mothers (P less than 0.01). The impact of maternal HIV-1 infection on the infant seems limited during the neonatal period.\r"

The prevalence of HIV-2 infection was 20.4% (206 out of 1009) and of HIV-2-associated AIDS 4.4% (44 out of 1009). HIV-2 infection was more frequent in women (25%, 110 out of 440) than in men (16.9%, 96 out of 569). HIV-1 infection was diagnosed in one patient only, and one patient (with AIDS) had reactivity to both HIV-1 and HIV-2. Among HIV-2-seropositive patients, AIDS was demonstrated in 21.3% and AIDS-related symptoms (not fulfilling the AIDS criteria) in 19.4%. The frequency of AIDS-associated symptoms was significantly higher in HIV-2-seropositive patients than in seronegative patients. The clinical profile of the HIV-2-associated AIDS cases was very similar to that described in HIV-1-associated AIDS cases in Africa. Seven out of 51 patients fulfilling the clinical criteria for AIDS were HIV-seronegative. The World Health Organization (WHO) clinical case definition for AIDS in Africa had a specificity of 99% and a positive predictive value of 86%. Tuberculosis was more common in HIV-2-seropositive patients (6.3%) than in HIV-2-seronegative patients (2.2%). A history of blood transfusion was a significant risk factor for HIV-2 infection. HIV-2 infection and AIDS are public health problems in Guinea-Bissau.\r"

Sixteen patients with CT and a past history or current manifestations of sulphonamide allergy were desensitized to sulphadiazine from October 1988 to December 1989. The protocol employed the oral administration of gradually increasing increments of sulphadiazine 3-hourly over 5 days. Success was defined as tolerance of 2-4 g oral sulphadiazine per day for at least 7 days until death or the present time without any allergic reactions. Our success rated overall was 10 out of 16 patients (62%). Seven patients achieved a final dose of 4 g/day and three a dose of 2 g/day. Concurrent CS administration did not appear to affect the outcome in the small number of patients studied. Our sulphadiazine regimen rapidly, successfully and safely desensitized patients with CT and sulphonamide allergy, allowing the optimal first-line treatment to continue. The aetiology of allergy in HIV-infected patients and the mechanisms by which desensitization works are unknown.\r"

Four hundred and eight-one pupils from four randomly selected secondary schools, two from Dar-Es-Salaam (a city) and two from Bagamoyo (a semi-rural town), were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Of these, 476 (99.0%) had heard of AIDS, and 447 (92.9%) were able to mention spontaneously at least one sexually transmitted disease (STD), of whom 374 (83.7%) mentioned AIDS. Knowledge was found to increase with age and tended to be higher among women in Dar-Es-Salaam than in Bagamoyo. These data suggest that communication channels directed at women in rural areas should be strengthened. While knowledge of sexual transmission of HIV was generally high, and prevalence of reported misconceptions about modes of transmission was very low, knowledge of non-sexual means of transmission (transfusions, injections, vertical) was lacking. Although 80% of pupils mentioned reduction of number of sexual partners as a means of AIDS prevention, only 22% mentioned condom use, and less than 5% reported that they had ever used a condom. Future research should concentrate on means of promoting sexual behavior change, the ultimate aim of any AIDS prevention strategy.\r"

Symptoms are typically gastrointestinal and pulmonary, with infiltrates often seen on chest radiography. Diagnosis requires stool examination and biopsy of affected sites. Treatment with repeated courses of thiabendazole (25 mg/kg twice daily for 5 days) was successful in our case, but maintenance regimens have not yet been defined. The relative rarity of this complication of AIDS suggests that, where both infections are present, disseminated strongyloidiasis only arises either when HIV-induced immunodeficiency is profound or, possibly, when it is accompanied by impaired granulopoiesis.\r"

The staging systems were applied to 386 HIV-infected men in the San Francisco Men's Health Study cohort who did not have AIDS at the baseline examination. After 48-56 months of follow-up the cumulative incidence of AIDS and the cumulative mortality by stage was determined for each staging. Unlike the other systems, the WRSC could not classify a substantial proportion of HIV-infected men (51.9%). The WRSC and ISS include one or more stages which did not appear to be associated with a prognosis substantially different from that of adjacent stages. The simplified staging system based on CD4+ T-cell depletion and oral disease may be the most effective of the systems studied. A more complete understanding of the pathophysiology during the evolution of HIV infection will be required to define a more detailed staging of this disease.\r"

Both CD4% and rate of change of CD4% in an individual had significant prognostic value in determining AIDS-free survival time. Compared with subjects whose CD4% remained stable, subjects whose CD4% dropped by 7% or more in a year had a relative hazard of 35.1 (95% confidence interval = 11.7-105.6, P less than 0.001) of developing AIDS. Increasing CD4% had a significant protective effect, reducing the risk of developing AIDS. CD4%, CD4 cell count and CD4: CD8 ratios showed steeper declines in subjects who were later diagnosed with AIDS than in those who remained AIDS-free. The rates of immunological change in AIDS-free seroconverters and seropositives were similar, despite indeterminate differences in durations of infections. In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, baseline CD4%, the rate of change of CD4%, and baseline lymphocyte count were associated with AIDS-free survival time. Baseline CD4% had greater prognostic value than baseline CD4 cell count. Baseline CD8%, baseline CD8 count, their rates of change and their mean square errors were not independently significant in this analysis. These findings are important for clinicians monitoring HIV infection in an individual and for entry criteria and monitoring procedures in clinical trials. They also have implications for resource-poor settings; prognosis based on CD4% can be made with a flow cytometer without a full blood count.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of 125 HIV-seronegative subjects, 123 (98.4%) were PCR-negative while 158 (82.7%) of 191 HIV-seropositive subjects were PCR-positive. Fewer of the 33 subjects who were seropositive and PCR-negative were at Centers for Disease Control (CDC) stage IV than the seropositive, PCR-positive subjects (6 versus 25%; P = 0.030). The seropositive, PCR-negative group had higher mean CD4 counts (640 versus 490 x 10(6) cells/l; P = 0.006), higher CD4: CD8 ratios (0.92 versus 0.64; P = 0.004), lower immunoglobulin (Ig) G levels (1290 versus 1645 mg/dl; P = 0.002), lower IgA levels (168 versus 251 mg/dl; P less than 0.001), and lower C1q binding activity (8 versus 14%; P = 0.010) than the seropositive, PCR-positive subjects. The median rate of CD4 cell decline in the 3 years preceding the PCR sample was less marked in the seropositive, PCR-negative group than the seropositive, PCR-positive group (-58 versus -77 x 10(6) cells/l per year; P = 0.028). To control for duration of infection, we restricted the analysis to the subgroups of 11 seropositive, PCR-negative subjects and 34 seropositive, PCR-positive subjects who had seroconverted earlier in the cohort study. Both subgroups had similar durations of infection, yet the same pattern of differences persisted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the interval between HIV-1 infection and the development of clinical AIDS among Italian patients with congenital coagulation disorders, a national cohort study was undertaken in 1988. Information was collected both retrospectively and prospectively on 499 HIV-1-positive patients enrolled in an ongoing national registry of patients with congenital coagulation disorders. Two methods were used to estimate each patient's seroconversion date: the mid-point between the last negative (either known or estimated) and the first positive test, and the median under a Weibull distribution, which was assumed to fit seroconversion data. The two methods of estimating the seroconversion time yielded similar results. The actuarial incidence of AIDS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis at 12.8% (95% confidence interval = 9.7-15.9) over 7 years for Italian haemophiliacs. Progression appears to be slow in the first 5 years after the infection, and to rise steadily thereafter. A strong association between faster progression and older age at seroconversion was found. Zidovudine-treated individuals seem to have a slower progression than untreated individuals, after controlling for CD4, but there was no association between progression and type and severity of the congenital disorder.\r"

Review of records in the city's major hospitals showed that fatality rates (deaths per 1000 admissions) in adult medical patients increased by 54% between 1983 and 1988, with increases of 106 and 98% in men 20-29 and 30-39 years of age, respectively, and 199 and 42% in women of the same age ranges. Mortality rates in surgical patients showed little change, while in children they declined. Over the same period, official mortality statistics for the city showed reduced mortality rates in children and women 20-29 years of age, but an increase in mortality rates of 54% in men 20 years of age and older, and of 28% in women aged 30 years and older. HIV infection may be a major cause of the increased adult mortality documented in hospital and city records, and jeopardizes improved survival from preventive measures such as maternal and child health services.\r"

We examined specific antibody to Treponema pallidum (TP) using the TP haemagglutination (TPHA) and fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption (FTA-ABS) tests in AIDS patients and HIV-antibody-negative controls with a history of syphilis. Tests were carried out on two sera separated by an interval of at least 3 years from each patient. Twelve out of 29 AIDS patients compared with four out of 29 controls showed significant falls in titres of specific antibody as measured by the TPHA, FTA-ABS, or by both the TPHA and FTA-ABS (P = 0.02). Furthermore, in three out of 29 (10%) of the AIDS patients with past syphilis infections both the TPHA and FTA-ABS became non-reactive. We conclude that negative specific serology does not exclude a past syphilis infection in patients with AIDS.\r"

Major blood group cross-matching was done by 9.7% (six out of 62) of the centres. Bacteriological results indicated contamination in 17% (four out of 23) of stocked blood units, 6.4% (four out of 62) of solutions for disinfections, and 22% (13 out of 59) of sterilized instruments (possessed by 59 centres only). Transfusion practices in Kinshasa are associated with considerable health risks.

MAb AH16 was previously shown to inhibit cell-free virus infection using HTLV-IIIB propagated in H9 cells. AH16 showed a concentration-dependent inhibition of the HTLV-IIIB/lyA isolate but did not inhibit the HTLV-IIIB/lyB or the HTLV-IIIB/lyO isolate. Specificity of the MAb-mediated inhibition was shown using A-antigen (tetrasaccharide). Thus, HIV infection of PBMC from donors with blood type A appears to induce expression of host-cell-encoded carbohydrate blood group A epitope on HIV which can be a target for MAb-mediated virus neutralization.\r"

These results point to the early and regular spread of this lentivirus to the brain. Neutralizing activity was studied in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid specimens obtained from these macaques against a selected group of isolates. Cerebrospinal fluid did not show any neutralizing activity. Our findings integrate the observations from HIV-1 infection in man and indicate that SIV infection of macaques is a useful model for studying pathogenic events of brain infection.\r"

Since microalbuminuria is considered an independent predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, studies are currently being undertaken to determine the effect of various antihypertensive agents on UAE, on the assumption that a reduction of UAE might result in improved prognosis in patients with essential hypertension. Twenty-four patients with essential hypertension were randomly divided into two groups of 12. The first group received 20 mg/day enalapril for 8 weeks, followed by 20 to 40 mg/day nitrendipine for 8 more weeks. The second group received nitrendipine for 8 weeks, followed by enalapril. Mean arterial pressure decreased similarly during both therapeutic regimens in the two groups of patients. In patients of group 1, UAE decreased significantly (P less than .01) from 74 +/- 7.0 to 33 +/- 5.8 mg/24 h after 8 weeks of treatment with enalapril; during the following 8 weeks of treatment with nitrendipine, UAE increased to 58 +/- 5.3 mg/24 h (P less than .02). In patients of group 2, UAE did not change during the first 8 weeks of therapy with nitrendipine despite a significant reduction in blood pressure; subsequently, after 8 weeks of therapy with enalapril, UAE decreased from 62 +/- 9.2 to 31 +/- 4.8 mg/24 h (P less than .01). This study demonstrates that enalapril but not nitrendipine may reduce UAE in patients with essential hypertension despite similar antihypertensive efficacy. The significance of microalbuminuria and the impact of the normalization of UAE on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with essential hypertension remains to be determined.\r"

The addition of bendrofluazide did not cause any statistically significant fall in the supine blood pressure compared to treatment with placebo (147.6/90.1 +/- 4.8/2.8 v 150.8/92.6 +/- 4.3/2.3 mm Hg, respectively). Plasma potassium was significantly lower on bendrofluazide as compared to placebo (3.11 +/- 0.14 v 3.62v +/- 0.13 mmol/L, P less than .001) and 10 of 12 patients had a fall in plasma potassium while on diuretic. The results of this study suggest that a thiazide diuretic has little additive effect on blood pressure in patients already on the long-acting dihydropyridine amlodipine, and may cause hypokalemia.\r"

Endothelin immunoreactivity levels in plasma in the four groups were similar, but had a positive correlation with blood pressure in hypertensives although not in normotensives. The concentration in plasma of both C-terminal and N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide also had a positive correlation with blood pressure in these hypertensive patients. We conclude that if plasma immunoreactive endothelin levels represent the result of endothelial production of endothelin, in absence of changes in catabolism of the peptide, essential hypertensive patients do not appear to have increased production of endothelin.\r"

In perfused mesenteric vasculatures prepared from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR, 7 to 10 weeks old) and age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), we have examined the effects of substance P on vascular responsiveness as well as on norepinephrine release from the vascular adrenergic neurons. In preliminary studies with normotensive Wistar rats, pressor responses and endogenous norepinephrine release during electrical nerve stimulation were inhibited by substance P in a dose-dependent manner. However, vasoconstrictor responses to exogenous norepinephrine were not affected by the peptide. In SHR, the stimulation-evoked pressor responses and norepinephrine release were enhanced compared with WKY. Alternatively, the suppression of these responses by substance P was significantly less in SHR than in WKY. These results demonstrate that substance P could have a modulatory effect on noradrenergic activity and cause a decrease in stimulation-evoked norepinephrine release from the vascular adrenergic neurons. The attenuated reduction of pressor responses and norepinephrine release by substance P in SHR might suggest insufficient regulation of vascular adrenergic transmission by the peptide in hypertension.\r"

Accordingly, 75 patients with mild hypertension aged 50 to 70 were randomly divided into three groups for a double-blind 8 week comparison of the actions of placebo, 4 to 8 mg/day perindopril, and 37.5 to 75 mg/day spironolactone. Side-effects caused one patient to withdraw from placebo and one from spironolactone treatment. Mean blood pressure rose by 2.4 mm Hg after placebo but dropped by 7.4 and 8.6 after perindopril and spironolactone (P less than .01). Placebo, perindopril, and spironolactone did not alter blood glucose or plasma potassium, but induced, respectively, variations of -0.09, 0, and +0.34 mmol/L in cholesterol (P = .04), and -0.02, -0.05, and +0.27 mmol/L in triglycerides (P less than .01). After the three treatments, changes in angiotensin converting enzyme activity averaged -1, -6, and -1 mU/mL (P less than .01), in active renin -2, +18, and +28 pg/mL (P less than .01), and in aldosterone, +15, +8, and +95 pg/mL (P less than .01). Placebo, perindopril, and spironolactone did not alter microalbuminuria, but reduced urinary kallikrein activity by 0.9, 1.8, and 5.4 mU/mmol creatinine (P = .04). Although short-term administration of spironolactone raised renin and aldosterone markedly and lipids moderately (possibly because of volume contraction), the present results show that perindopril and spironolactone are both safe and effective for treating hypertension at the age of 50 or older.\r"

A four-week placebo washout was followed by 8 weeks of titration and 12 weeks of maintenance therapy. Quality-of-life evaluation included clinical assessments by the patient and parallel take-home assessments by patient and spouse. Blood pressure was controlled equally in both groups. The total incidence of adverse reactions was similar in both groups, but a greater percentage of nifedipine GITS patients withdrew due to peripheral edema. Patients completing 20 weeks of therapy demonstrated a more favorable quality-of-life profile (P less than .05) for nifedipine GITS over atenolol in psychosocial (P less than .01), well-being (P less than .05), general affect (P less than .05), emotional ties (P less than .01), emotional control (P less than .05), vitality (P less than .05), and leisure (P less than .05) scores. Treatment differences were particularly pronounced for patients over 50 years of age and were not fully detectable until after 14 weeks of therapy. Deterioration in quality of life was associated with withdrawal. Spouses of younger patients receiving atenolol reported deterioration in sexual satisfaction as compared to spouses of patients taking nifedipine GITS (P less than .02). Thus age, length of trial, and third-party observation are important factors in quality-of-life assessment. Comparison of adverse reactions provides an incomplete measure of how well a drug is tolerated. In contrast, findings indicate that even subtle CNS-mediated effects on mood and well-being can be detected by quality-of-life evaluation.\r"

  ".U": "91283098\r", 
  ".W": "The importance of the central nervous system (CNS) in the development of mineralocorticoid hypertension has been well documented. Type I receptors in adrenalectomized rats are concentrated in the hippocampus, amygdala, lateral septum, and hypothalamus, particularly in the periventricular regions, areas known to be or suspected of being important in the regulation of ACTH release, arousal, fluid and fluid osmolality equilibrium, and the maintenance of normal blood pressure. In the rat, ablation of the AV3V area and central, but not peripheral, sympathectomy prevent the development of DOCA-salt hypertension. The continuous intracerebroventricular (icv) infusion of aldosterone in rats or dogs at doses which do not affect the blood pressure when administered subcutaneously (sc) produces significant increases in resting blood pressure. In rats this effect is dose dependent, blocked by the concomitant icv infusion of prorenone, an aldosterone antagonist, and enhanced, but not completely dependent upon renal mass reduction and excess salt consumption. The icv infusion of RU28318, a selective mineralocorticoid antagonist, at doses which are ineffective when administered sc, inhibits the development of hypertension produced by the sc infusion of aldosterone or deoxycorticosterone, as well as that produced by the oral administration of a licorice derivative and of a high salt diet in the Dahl S/JR rat. It is assumed that this effect is mediated through the mineralocorticoid receptor because it is inhibited by mineralocorticoid antagonists and because the icv infusion of RU26988, a selective glucocorticoid agonist, has no effect. The concomitant icv infusion of corticosterone, which is thought to be the primary ligand of the brain mineralocorticoid receptor, antagonizes the effect of icv infusion of aldosterone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The 110 women studied (age = 29.7 +/- 7.2 years, range 20 to 50) were all employed in technical and clerical occupations from the same worksite. They were divided into four groups based on race and how they perceived work stress on the day of study. The results showed that there were no daytime differences in blood pressure levels in blacks or whites, but women who perceived greater stress at work on the day of study had higher pressures during work (123/78 v 115/74; p less than .01). Blacks, however, had higher pressures during sleep than whites, independent of the perception of work stress (109/65 v 104/60; P less than .01). These results suggest that the smaller drop in pressure during sleep in blacks is not related to perceived work stress, but that the effects of perceived stress on daytime pressures is independent of race.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To study the vaginal flora of women in preterm labour (PTL) and determine whether the presence of specific vaginal microflora is significantly associated with onset of PTL. DESIGN--A comprehensive prospective study of the vaginal microflora of women in early labour comparing women in PTL with term controls. Microbiological assessment included cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, yeasts, genital mycoplasmas and Trichomonas vaginalis. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to adjust for confounding obstetric and demographic variables. SETTING--The Queen Victoria Hospital, Adelaide. PATIENTS--428 Women in PTL compared to 568 women in labour at term. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--PTL and preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (PPROM) in relation to specific vaginal microflora. RESULTS--After multiple logistic regression analysis, two distinct bacteriological groupings were associated with PTL less than 37 weeks gestation, namely, the bacterial vaginosis group of organisms, Gardnerella vaginalis and Bacteroides spp., and a group of enteropharyngeal organisms, E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Haemophilus spp. and S. aureus. G. vaginalis was found in 12% of women in PTL compared to 6% at term [regression odds ratio (ROR) 1.8, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.1-3.1] whereas Bacteroides spp. were detected in 45% of women in PTL compared with 35% at term (ROR 1.6, CI 1.2-2.1). The prevalence of G. vaginalis (17%) and Bacteroides spp. (50%) was even higher in women in PTL less than 34 weeks gestation. The enteropharyngeal group of organisms were more commonly present in women in PTL less than 37 weeks (E. coli 10% vs 6%, ROR 1.4, CI 0.8-2.4; Klebsiella spp. 3% vs less than 1%, ROR 5.4, CI 1.1-26.7; Haemophilus spp. 2% vs less than 1%, ROR 5.5, CI 1.1-28.6; S. aureus 6% vs 4%, ROR 1.8, CI 0.9-3.3) and were isolated even more frequently in women in PTL less than 34 weeks (E. coli 15%; Klebsiella spp. 4%; S. aureus 7%). Bacteroides spp., Klebsiella spp., and Haemophilus spp. were all found to be associated with PPROM. CONCLUSION--There are two distinct bacteriological groupings commonly found in women in PTL, especially in PTL less than 34 weeks gestation. These bacteriological groups are women with bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy and women who demonstrate enteropharyngeal bacteria in the vagina.\r"

There was significantly lower binding in the 25 pregnant women who were normotensive (2.3 fmol/10(9) cells) when compared with the non-pregnant women (9.0 fmol/10(9) cells P less than 0.001). Significantly higher platelet AII binding levels were found in the 39 women who had pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) (5.5 fmol/10(9) cells) when compared with the 25 normotensive pregnant women (P less than 0.001). Of the 39 women with PIH, platelet AII binding was higher in the 23 women who had pre-eclampsia (7.0 fmol/10(9) cells), when compared with the 16 who had non-proteinuric PIH, (4.6 fmol/10(9) cells) although the difference was not statistically significant (P less than 0.04). The pressor response to AII is also diminished in pregnancy, yet less so if pregnancy induced hypertension develops. Platelets may provide a readily accessible tissue with which to study AII responsiveness in pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "Uterine activity during the first stage of labour was measured by an intrauterine transducer in 22 women induced with intravaginal PGE2 gel, in 37 induced by amniotomy and intravenous oxytocin, and in nine women in spontaneous labour. The nulliparous women in the PGE2 gel group had a significantly longer pre-established phase of labour and a significantly shorter established phase than nulliparae induced by amniotomy and oxytocin. The mean levels of total uterine activity (kPas) during labour and the uterine activity integrals (kPas/15 min) were significantly lower in nulliparae induced with PGE2 gel than in those induced by amniotomy and oxytocin. These findings suggest that PGE2 gel has a positive, beneficial effect on cervical compliance during the pre-established phase, resulting in less myometrial effort during established labour. These effects were less evident in parous women, probably because of an innate lower cervical resistance due to their previous labours. Uterine activity patterns during the 4 h leading to full cervical dilatation in nulliparae were similar in labours induced with PGE2 gel and spontaneous labours, whereas labours induced by amniotomy and oxytocin exhibited a significantly different pattern. Expulsion of the fetus during normal labour is a function of both uterine contractions and a decrease in the cervical resistance and the data suggest that induction by PGE2 gel more closely mimics spontaneous labour, whereas the predominant effect of oxytocin is to stimulate myometrial activity.\r"

Umbilical artery flow velocity waveforms were recorded using a pulsed Doppler duplex scanner (ATL Mk V) and umbilical artery pulsatility index (PI) and fetal heart rate (FHR) were derived from these recordings. Maternal blood pressure decreased significantly after both drugs. Maternal pulse rate increased after hydralazine but did not change significantly after labetalol. FHR did not change significantly after hydralazine but decreased after labetalol. PI decreased after hydralazine and increased after labetalol--most fetuses showed little change but a few in each group showed large changes in PI, as did two of five additional patients studied. We attributed the decrease in PI in some fetuses after hydralazine to vasodilation, and the increase in PI in some fetuses after labetalol to vasoconstriction in the fetoplacental circulation, suggesting that fetal beta-blockade may occur after maternal treatment with labetalol.\r"

The histological presence and distribution of hPL was investigated in endometrial curettings from 90 patients studied retrospectively (47 had ectopic pregnancies, 14 miscarriages, and 29 legal abortions), and a consecutive, prospective series of 50 patients (40 had miscarriages and 10 had ectopic pregnancies) without chorionic villi in their endometrial curettings. Non-specific background staining was not a problem. The retrospective survey disclosed that hPL was a highly sensitive marker of intrauterine pregnancy (sensitivity = 0.98). In the prospective series, the predictive value of positive staining for hPL for intrauterine pregnancy was 1.00, and the sensitivity of hPL, as an indicator of uterine gestation, was 0.62. In absence of specific hPL-staining, the risk of ectopic pregnancy was about 50%. The immunohistochemical demonstration of hPL is a useful tool for identifying patients who are suspected of having had a miscarriage, but for whom evidence in the form of chorionic villi in endometrial curettings is lacking.\r"

Of the 103 women with bleeding, 93 had dilatation and curettage (D&C) and 10 patients were treated conservatively with a repeat scan in six months. A correlation of ultrasound findings and endometrial histopathology was possible in 94 patients. In 59 of these (63%) the endometrium was atrophic and the ultrasound endometrial thickness was 5 mm or less. In 29 (31%) patients the endometrial histology was abnormal and ultrasound endometrial thickness was greater than 5 mm. In six patients the endometrium was atrophic, but the ultrasonic endometrial thickness was apparently greater than 5 mm due to intracavity fluid. We suggest that an endometrial thickness of 5 mm is an appropriate cut-off level for conservative management of patients with postmenopausal bleeding, or in screening for endometrial carcinoma.\r"

SUBJECTS--29 men with a subsequent diagnosis of gastric cancer and 116 aged matched controls selected from over 22,000 middle aged men participating in two ongoing cohort studies (the British United Provident Association study and the Caerphilly collaborative heart disease study), who had provided blood samples during 1975-1982. RESULTS--20 of the 29 cases (69%) and 54 of the 116 controls (47%) were positive for H pylori specific antibody. The median specific IgG concentration was significantly higher in the cases than controls (90 micrograms/ml v 3.6 micrograms/ml, p less than 0.01). The estimated odds ratio for the risk of gastric cancer in those with a history of infection with H pylori was 2.77 (95% confidence interval 1.04 to 7.97, 2p = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS--H pylori infection may be an important cause of gastric cancer; between 35% and 55% of all cases may be associated with such an infection.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine the changes in incidence of and mortality from gastric cancer in Scotland between 1978 and 1987 and in the operative workload in Lothian between 1979 and 1988. DESIGN--Analysis of national incidence statistics for gastric cancer derived from the Scottish national cancer registry, deaths from gastric cancer recorded by the registrar general for Scotland, and Lothian surgical audit data. SETTING--Scotland and Lothian Health Board area. PATIENTS--Patients in Scotland with gastric cancer during 1978 to 1987 inclusive; patients in Scotland with gastric cancer recorded on their death certificate as cause of death during 1978 to 1987; patients who had an operation in Lothian for gastric cancer during 1979 to 1988. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Changes in incidence of and mortality from gastric cancer in Scotland from 1978 to 1987 and in the number of operations performed for gastric cancer in Lothian from 1979 to 1988. RESULTS--Mortality from gastric cancer in Scotland fell by about 25% over the 10 years. The incidence and standardised incidence of gastric cancer showed a marginal decline of about 9%. The differences in trends between incidence and mortality were significant (p less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS--This study shows that the surgical workload associated with gastric cancer is not declining. This is because the incidence has remained almost static, which may be due to the relative increase in the numbers of older people in the population, who are at greater risk of developing gastric cancer. Gastric cancer should not be regarded as a disease in decline. Incidence and workload should determine resources allocated to this disease rather than mortality statistics.\r"

DESIGN--Test on women presenting to accident and emergency department with gynaecological problems over six months. Results were validated using a quantitative assay for human chorionic gonadotrophin in serum and urine. SETTING--Accident and emergency department and gynaecology wards of a university teaching hospital. SUBJECTS--130 unselected women. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Detection of human chorionic gonadotrophin by one step test, presence of ectopic pregnancy, and results of quantitative analysis of chorionic gonadotrophin in serum and urine. RESULTS--79 women had a positive urine test result and 51 a negative result. All 12 women with ectopic pregnancy had a positive test result, although urinary concentration varied from 191 IU/l to 47,800 IU/l. Only one woman, who had a faintly positive result, was found not to be pregnant on subsequent examination. The sensitivity and negative predictive values of the urine test were 100% respectively. 33 women were sent home from the accident and emergency department with normal clinical findings after a negative urine test result. All these women had undetectable concentrations of chorionic gonadotrophin in matched samples of urine and serum. CONCLUSIONS--A simple, rapid one step test for chorionic gonadotrophin should be available for the initial evaluation of emergency gynaecological problems. The additional cost of the test is offset by not admitting those patients whose clinical findings are normal and who have a negative urine test result and by reducing the number of women requiring quantitative assays of chorionic gonadotrophin.\r"

DESIGN--Postal questionnaires to general practitioners throughout the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS--1268 general practitioners in the Medical Research Council's general practice research framework. RESULTS--1081 (85%) doctors in 220 (95%) practices responded. The doctors were currently prescribing hormone replacement therapy to an estimated 9% of their female patients aged 40 to 64, and 55% of doctors were prescribing opposed hormone replacement therapy (oestrogen plus progestogen) to more patients than a year previously. Over half the doctors would consider prescribing hormone replacement therapy for prevention of osteoporosis (670, 62%) and cardiovascular disease (611, 57%) to asymptomatic women. Overall, 79% of the doctors (851) would definitely or probably consider entering women who have had a hysterectomy into a randomised controlled trial comparing unopposed (oestrogen only) hormone replacement therapy with opposed hormone replacement therapy; 49% (524) would enter patients with a uterus into such a trial. Among a subsample, 85% (180/210) would consider entering patients without menopausal symptoms into a trial comparing hormone replacement therapy with no treatment (unopposed in patients who have had a hysterectomy, opposed in those with a uterus). CONCLUSION--There is considerable uncertainty among general practitioners as to the balance of beneficial and harmful effects of hormone replacement therapy in the long term, particularly relating to its use for prevention of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. Most of these doctors would be prepared to participate in randomised controlled trials to determine the long term effects of this increasingly widely used treatment.\r"

SETTING--Accident and emergency, radiology, and operating theatre departments in a children's hospital. SUBJECTS--50 children reported to have ingested coins. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Radiological investigations performed, position of coin, symptoms of child, and surgical intervention. RESULTS--50 children were recorded to have swallowed coins during 1986-90. Five children had only chest radiography, five only abdominal radiography, and 40 had both. A coin was detected in the oesophagus in 15 children, six of whom had symptoms, and below the cardia in 26, none of whom had symptoms; no coin was seen in nine children. Eleven children had further abdominal radiographs despite the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms; one child had a coin removed from the stomach. CONCLUSIONS--Children are being unnecessarily exposed to radiation and surgical intervention, and a consensus on management of swallowed coins is needed. Most children require only a single chest and neck radiograph.\r"

DESIGN--Cohort study of all women who had entered a donor insemination programme. SETTING--Two fertility clinics serving a large part of The Netherlands. SUBJECTS--Of 1637 women attending for artificial insemination 751 fulfilled the selection criteria, being married to an azoospermic husband and nulliparous and never having received donor insemination before. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--The number of cycles before pregnancy (a positive pregnancy test result) or stopping treatment; and result of the pregnancy (successful outcome). RESULTS--Of the 751 women, 555 became pregnant and 461 had healthy babies. The fall in fecundity was estimated to start at around 31 years (critical age); after 12 cycles the probability of pregnancy in a woman aged greater than 31 was 0.54 compared with 0.74 in a woman aged 20.31. After 24 cycles this difference had decreased (probability of conception 0.75 in women greater than 31 and 0.85 in women 20.31). The probability of having a healthy baby also decreased--by 3.5% a year after the age of 30. Combining both these age effects, the chance of a woman aged 35 having a healthy baby was about half that of a woman aged 25. CONCLUSION--After the age of 31 the probability of conception falls rapidly, but this can be partly compensated for by continuing insemination for more cycles. In addition, the probability of an adverse pregnancy outcome starts to increase at about the same age.\r"

DESIGN--Follow up of draft death entries received by the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys on which one of 11 medical or external causes likely to be related to HIV was stated; letters were sent to the people who signed the certificates. The respondents were invited to report men known to have been HIV positive who were not already on the CDSC register. SETTING--England and Wales. SUBJECTS--Men aged 15-54 who died in February 1989 to July 1989 with one of the 11 selected HIV related diseases as cause of death on their death certificates. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Number of men reported to the CDSC as a result of this follow up; estimate of excess deaths due to an HIV related cause; estimate of the proportion of excess deaths that occurred in those who were not known to be HIV positive at the time of death. RESULTS--Replies were received for 473 deaths (86%). Forty were for men known to have been HIV positive, 31 of whom had been reported to CDSC by the time they died; six were subsequently reported. The respondent did not know that the decreased was HIV positive for 20 (35%) of the 57 excess deaths in men for whom one of the medical causes was stated and 41 (93%) of the 44 excess deaths in men for whom one of the external causes was stated. CONCLUSION--Follow up of death registrations is not an efficient way of increasing the number of cases of HIV infection reported to CDSC. Between 35% and 60% of HIV positive people for whom certain causes are stated may be dying without HIV positivity having been diagnosed. There may be implications for those caring for people with these conditions and those who carry out postmortem examinations.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To monitor trends in mortality and morbidity due to ischaemic heart disease and compare these with observed levels of risk factors from population surveys. DESIGN--Analysis of trends in death rates from ischaemic heart disease in Iceland compared with expected rates computed from population surveys. Risk factor levels together with beta factors obtained from Cox's regression analysis were used to compute expected death rates. Trends in morbidity due to acute myocardial infarction were assessed and secular trends in dietary consumption compared with trends in cholesterol concentrations. SETTING--Reykjavik, Iceland (total population 250,000; over half the population live in Reykjavik). SUBJECTS--12,814 randomly selected residents in the Reykjavik area aged 45-64 (6623 men, 6191 women; 72% and 80% of those invited). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Age adjusted rates of myocardial infarction and deaths from ischaemic heart disease. Expected risk from risk factor levels (smoking, total serum cholesterol concentration, systolic blood pressure) at each unique survey visit. RESULTS--Mortality from ischaemic heart disease has decreased by 17-18% since 1970. During 1981-6 the myocardial infarction attack rate in men under 75 decreased by 23%. A decrease occurred in the level of all three major risk factors after 1968. The fall in the serum cholesterol concentration coincided with a reduction in consumption of dairy fat and margarine. The calculated reduction in risk for the age group 45-64 was about 35%, which was closely similar to the observed decrease in mortality due to ischaemic heart disease in that age group. CONCLUSION--The reduction in mortality from ischaemic heart disease was substantially due to a decreased incidence of myocardial infarction and could be attributed largely to the reduction in risk factors.\r"

DESIGN--Anonymous postal questionnaire sent to all general practitioners in Tower Hamlets and review of consecutive case conferences held by social services for three months in 1989. SETTING--Tower Hamlets health district. SUBJECTS--91 general practitioners, 56 of whom (62%) responded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Number of conferences attended, reasons for non-attendance, and reported confidence in dealing with sexual abuse. RESULTS--General practitioners estimated that 202 child protection conferences had been held in 1989 on their patients and that they had attended 85 of these. Information from social services for three months suggested that general practitioners had attended only nine of the 114 conferences reviewed. Timing of the conference was the most important reason for non-attendance. All respondents wanted access to the minutes of these conferences irrespective of their own attendance. Most general practitioners were very or moderately confident of their ability to detect child sexual abuse and non-accidental injury and to communicate with the family. CONCLUSION--More effort should be made to ensure that general practitioners are notified of case conferences and that the timing and location of conferences is compatible with their other commitments.\r"

DESIGN--Analysis of prospectively collected data for the 12 months from March 1989. SETTING--Same day testing clinic run by the HIV/AIDS team at an urban teaching hospital. PATIENTS--561 consecutive people choosing to attend and proceeding to HIV-I testing. RESULTS--The demand for the service caused it to run to capacity within six months. The median age of those attending was 28 years and 65% (364 patients) were male. The overall prevalence of HIV-I infection was 3.9% (22 patients). The greatest prevalence was in men reporting their primary risk as homosexual contact (11.9%, 13/109). The median CD4 cell count in the 22 patients who had detectable HIV-I antibodies was 0.31 x 10(9) cells/l (normal range 0.5 x 10(9)/l to 1.2 x 10(9)/l). Twenty of these patients were asymptomatic (Centers for Disease Control stages II or III), 14 had CD4 cell counts below 0.5 x 10(9)/l. CONCLUSIONS--There is a recognisable demand for a service providing rapid results of HIV-I antibody testing in this setting. The overall seroprevalence of 3.9% is comparable with the 5.8% reported from freestanding clinics in the United States. Most patients with HIV-I antibodies detected in this way are asymptomatic but could benefit from early medical intervention because of low CD4 cell counts.\r"

DESIGN--Census carried out between 8 am and 8 pm on one day. Participants completed a questionnaire designed to provide data relating to employment history, contact with welfare and health services, social state, prison history, medical history, and health state. SETTING--Sites in Sheffield identified by local workers as being places of residence of homeless people. SUBJECTS--340 single homeless people. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Self reported history of alcohol or drug misuse, existence of a chronic medical condition, and use of general practitioner and hospital services. RESULTS--The mean age of the population was 42.5 years and a quarter of the population were aged less than 30; there were 48 women. Significant differences were noted between men and women with respect to self reported psychiatric illness (77/266 men v 27/42 women), self reported alcoholism (83/273 v 4/44), prison history (152/255 v 8/41), and registration with a general practitioner (73/275 v 38/46). Various chronic medical conditions were reported, and the perceived health state of the population was low; 129 claimed to have been admitted to a psychiatric hospital. 220 people were registered with a general practitioner, and 179 claimed to see their doctor. Sixty five had attended or been admitted to a general hospital in the month preceding the study, 45 for accident and emergency services. CONCLUSIONS--The homeless in this population were younger than those found in previous studies. The prevalence of psychiatric illness was high in the population, and the overall health state was poor. Most subjects obtained health services from general practitioners.\r"

  ".W": "Conventional palliative management of inoperable focal hepatic tumours remains unsatisfactory. Interstitial techniques such as cryotherapy, alcohol injection, low power laser hyperthermia and interstitial radiotherapy offer alternative approaches. Cryotherapy is an effective and precise technique for inducing tumour necrosis. It can only be performed at laparotomy making it relatively invasive and retreatment impractical. Alcohol is cheap and can be injected percutaneously. However, inhomogeneous distribution produces imprecise and nonreproducible lesions. Low power laser hyperthermia produces precise and reproducible areas of necrosis that are roughly spherical in shape. At present, this technique is most effective for small tumours. Interstitial radiotherapy remains the least evaluated of all the interstitial techniques. Unlike cryotherapy and low power laser hyperthermia, the biological effect of ethanol injection and interstitial radiotherapy cannot be monitored in real time by ultrasound. With the exception of cryotherapy, all methods can be applied percutaneously with low morbidity and mortality. None of these techniques is established, but they may offer the prospect of cure in cases where all areas of tumour can be positively identified and fully treated. However, in most instances the intention is to control the growth of relatively small discrete volumes of tumour within the hepatic parenchyma.\r"

This allows binding of the oestrogen-ER complex to DNA via cysteine residues in region C of the ER molecule, which tetrahedrally co-ordinate zinc. This modulates transcription and stimulates cell growth. A number of newly discovered growth factors are also regulated by ER, as is the progesterone receptor. Steroid receptor concentrations in tissues can now be measured on smaller tissue samples using enzyme immunoassay or on cells obtained by fine needle aspiration using monoclonal antibody technology. The prognostic value of steroid receptor is limited, but still constitutes the best marker for predicting response to endocrine therapy. The role of steroid receptors in selecting patients for adjuvant therapy is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-four (3.6 percent) patients with problematical anal fistulae out of 671 with anal fistulae were analysed to assess the reasons for their recurrences and ultimate outcome. Thirteen patients (group A) had recurrent fistulae despite two definitive attempts at surgery at this hospital (median number of previous procedures before referral to this hospital was two, range 0-7; median number of definitive procedures at this hospital was three, range 3-4). In five of these patients, the reason for recurrence was missed primary (four cases) or secondary tracks (one case) at earlier operations. Five patients required multiple operations related to the use of setons. Eleven other patients (group B) required colostomy construction, eight because of severe perianal sepsis, two because of complex fistulae, and one for postrectal dermoid. Fistula healing occurred ultimately in all patients in group A after a median of 14 months (range 4-38 months). In group B, fistula healing occurred in eight patients after a median of 7.5 months (range 2-55 months) after colostomy construction. Only one patient has had a proctectomy, and five still have their colostomy. Of the other 18 patients, continence is normal in 14, there is mucus leakage in two, flatus incontinence in one and faecal incontinence in one. In conclusion, persistent attempts to resolve anal fistulae in difficult cases are frequently successful in the long term and result in good continence.\r"

Seven patients had a simple oversew, four of these having had a delayed diagnosis. In four cases the site of perforation was not identified, but only one patient had conservative treatment. Three patients had drainage and a defunctioning colostomy. There was no significant morbidity following treatment. It is recommended that patients who have had a good bowel preparation should be treated conservatively unless there is a large perforation or an underlying carcinoma.\r"

Ileal motility, both spontaneous and in response to intraluminal volatile fatty acids (VFA), was studied after proctocolectomy in 25 female adult beagles, at least 6 months after ileoanal anastomosis alone (IAA, n = 6), IAA with myectomy (n = 8), IAA with myectomy and an ileal valve (n = 5) or IAA with a duplicated (J) ileal reservoir (n = 6). VFA were found to stimulate ileal motility significantly in each group. Myectomy significantly reduced the number of ileal contractions (P less than 0.01), the mean amplitude of contractions (P less than 0.05) and the motility index (P less than 0.01). The addition of the valve to myectomy made no significant difference.\r"

A multidisciplinary approach to these complex cases, which minimizes the need for repeated surgical interventions, has been pursued. Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy was performed and an extended limb of the jejunum brought to the abdominal wall to allow access for later radiological intervention. Over a 30-month period 58 biliary-enteric anastomoses for benign disease were performed. Seventeen of these 58 patients were managed using the combined approach. Ten of these 17 patients had complex postcholecystectomy strictures and seven had strictures resulting from inflammatory disease, hepatic resection or congenital problems. A new classification of results of management of bile duct strictures is proposed. Seven patients were classified as 'excellent', six 'good', two 'fair' and two 'poor'. Results were obtained at a mean follow-up of 16 months and it seems likely that in some patients major surgical reinterventions were avoided.\r"

Forty-eight symptomatic patients (median age 39 years, range 8-67 years; 30 male) with PSC were reviewed retrospectively. Thirty patients had inflammatory bowel disease. Four patients (8 per cent) developed or had an associated malignancy. Twenty-one (44 per cent) died; overall 5 year actuarial survival was 30 per cent. Twenty-three patients had 27 non-transplant related biliary operations (16 patients specifically for PSC) of whom 12 died. Serum bilirubin was the only parameter to improve after biliary surgery. Seventeen patients (35 per cent) underwent orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) of whom nine are currently alive (1 year projected survival of 55 per cent). Previous biliary surgery correlated with a poor outcome (P less than 0.0001) after OLT. Being male, presence of cirrhosis, duration of symptomatic disease (greater than 3 years) and a serum bilirubin level greater than 100 mumol/l at presentation, were independently associated with a poor outcome (P less than 0.05). These data provide evidence that PSC is a progressive disease and conventional surgical options have little influence on the outcome. Previous biliary surgery adversely affects outcome following OLT. For progressive liver disease, liver transplantation should be considered the treatment of choice.\r"

To address this issue, we studied 218 Sprague-Dawley rats with common bile duct obstruction. Mononuclear phagocyte function, cell mediated immune function, portal-systemic shunt fraction, liver function tests, and liver histology were evaluated in normal (sham) rats, obstructed rats, and at weekly intervals after relief of biliary obstruction. Hepatic uptake of radiolabelled bacteria was 82 per cent in sham rats and 66 per cent in rats 21 days after CBD obstruction (P less than 0.05). Phagocytic activity returned to normal within 7 days after choledochoduodenostomy. Cell mediated immunity, measured by skin graft rejection, was significantly prolonged in the obstructed group (P less than 0.05) but had returned to normal 7 days after biliary diversion. Return of hepatocellular function, as measured by liver function tests, paralleled recovery of immune function. This study demonstrates prompt recovery of the immune system after internal biliary drainage for obstructive jaundice. This finding is in contrast to previous studies that demonstrated persistent immune suppression months after biliary diversion. These data may have implications concerning the usefulness of internal biliary drainage before surgery in patients with obstructive jaundice.\r"

In normal pig liver the effects were studied of low power Nd:YAG laser light (continuous wave; 1.5 W, 10 min, wavelength 1064 nm), administered percutaneously via a 600 micron fibre. Ultrasound images were compared with histopathological findings. Histopathology showed induction of sharply demarcated lesions with a mean diameter of 10-15 mm (days 0 and 7), consisting of coagulative necrosis. Healing of the lesion occurred by granulation, fibrosis and removal of cell debris. Lesions could not be seen by week 4, which suggests complete regeneration. Ultrasonography showed a good correlation with histopathology, especially at 1 week when different histopathological tissue layers could be discriminated by ultrasonography. It is concluded that thermal lesions in liver can be induced via a percutaneous route and that ultrasound imaging is useful in monitoring the lesions during and after the procedure.\r"

With this latter approach, hospital mortality was 4 of 23 patients (17 per cent), but significant morbidity still occurred in 12 of 23 patients (52 per cent). However, recurrent intra-abdominal abscess before discharge occurred in only one patient.

Perforation of the cervical oesophagus is seldom lethal and can be adequately treated conservatively in the majority of cases. Perforations of the intrathoracic oesophagus can be divided into two groups, with or without simultaneous perforation of the parietal pleura. The optimal treatment for the group with pleural perforation seems to be resection of the oesophagus and secondary reconstruction, although primary closure is indicated in selected early cases. Perforations of the intrathoracic oesophagus confined to the mediastinum can be adequately treated conservatively in most patients. Perforation of the intra-abdominal oesophagus should be treated like any other intra-abdominal visceral perforation, by closure or diversion, even if this results in resection of the oesophagus.\r"

There was no correlation with site, size, penetration, lymph node status, length or type of tumour but there was a significant correlation between chylothorax and the type of operative procedure carried out. The incidence in 95 transhiatal resections was 10.5 per cent. The incidence following 442 transthoracic procedures was 0.2 per cent (P less than 0.001) with one chylous fistula occurring after a three-stage oesophagectomy. Initial management was conservative with chest drainage and total parenteral nutrition. Thoracotomy and duct ligation was subsequently carried out in three patients and was successful in two. The third patient died. Conservative management alone was successful in four out of eight patients, with closure of the fistula at a median of 35 days (range 14-42 days). Four patients treated conservatively died. Transhiatal oesophagectomy greatly increases the risk of chylothorax, a condition that carries a high mortality rate (46 per cent in this series) whether managed conservatively or by surgical intervention.\r"

Six valves were studied at intervals between 1 and 112 days after construction. All six were competent by Harvey's test and five were competent at descending phlebography.

  ".W": "Vascular patients under the care of one surgeon over a 5-year period have been reviewed, from computer-based discharge records, with regard to in-hospital measures of outcome to determine whether or not surgery was being performed to an acceptable standard. Out of 466 procedures, 30 per cent of patients had at least one complication, 14 per cent had further surgery and 9 per cent died. Outcome was examined within the following treatment groups: aorto/iliac aneurysm, aortofemoral bypass, femoroproximal popliteal bypass, femorodistal popliteal bypass, femorocrural bypass, embolectomy and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Patients having below-knee bypass surgery were found to have an unacceptably high rate of complications, reoperations and amputations. An overall rate of reoperation for postoperative bleeding of 5 per cent was also considered to be high. With these exceptions, it was concluded that the surgery was being performed to an acceptable standard, but that comparative audit of this type remained difficult while there was a deficiency of national statistics against which the work of individual surgeons could be judged.\r"

  ".U": "91283842\r", 
  ".W": "Low transcutaneous oxygen tension (Ptc,O2) values in the supramalleolar skin of patients with venous disease are often reported. This measurement involves heating the skin to 43 degrees C to cause maximum vasodilatation and is valid only if liposclerotic and normal skin can vasodilate to the same degree. Forty-four limbs were studied, 15 with lipodermatosclerosis (LDS), 14 with uncomplicated varicose veins, and 15 controls. A Ptc,O2 electrode was modified to incorporate a laser Doppler probe. Laser Doppler flux was measured in the supramalleolar skin before and after local heating to 43 degrees C and the relative increase in flux was measured. The Ptc,O2 was then measured at the same site and on the chest. Vasodilatory capacity was expressed as the ratio of peak:basal laser Doppler flow, and the Ptc,O2 was expressed as a leg:chest ratio. Median laser Doppler flow was higher in limbs with LDS (median 67 mV) than in normal limbs (median 40 mV) (P less than 0.03). Ptc,O2 was higher in control limbs (median ratio 0.94) than in limbs with LDS (median 0.53) (P less than 0.006). The microcirculation in LDS had less capacity to vasodilate after heating (median factor of increase 5.4) than normal skin (median factor of increase 12.3) (P less than 0.001). A simple regression analysis was performed on all pairs of data, and revealed a correlation between Ptc,O2 and vasodilatory capacity (r = 0.524, P less than 0.001). The results indicate that low Ptc,O2 levels in venous disease reflect an inability of the microcirculation to increase its flow in response to local heating; inferences about the oxygen content of liposclerotic skin at normal temperatures cannot be drawn using this technique.\r"

  ".W": "Sixty-five patients with suspected deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in 68 limbs were entered consecutively into a study to compare venography with duplex ultrasonography scanning. Both tests were performed on 64 limbs, venography being contraindicated in four. Overall, duplex scanning correctly identified 86 per cent of DVTs diagnosed on venography and correctly excluded 80 per cent with negative venograms. Nearly all errors arose in the diagnosis of calf DVT. In the femoral vein duplex scanning had a specificity of 100 per cent and a sensitivity of 95 per cent. In addition, duplex scanning provided data on the limb not undergoing venography. Of 55 limbs that underwent bilateral duplex scanning, five had thrombus in the femoropopliteal segment and a negative contralateral venogram. In addition, three Baker's cysts were diagnosed. Duplex scanning can be used in patients in whom venography is contraindicated and may also provide information about the contralateral limb. We regard femoropopliteal duplex scanning as sufficiently accurate that treatment can be initiated on the basis of the scan. Duplex scanning should replace venography as the standard method of diagnosing femoropopliteal DVT; radiographic studies should now be required only when the scan result is in doubt.\r"

The repeatability of maximum aortic diameter measurement by ultrasonography was much better for anterior-posterior than transverse diameter, with coefficients of repeatability 3.0-7.5 mm and 10-15 mm respectively. The repeatability of suprarenal aortic diameter measurement was poor. Surprisingly, maximum diameter using ultrasonography was larger than that using computed tomography, the difference being least for anterior-posterior measurements. At best a single, experienced observer, using the same instrument may provide aortic diameters using ultrasonography accurate to within 5 mm, but more commonly such aortic diameter is only accurate to within 8 mm.\r"

The commonest infecting organisms were Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus spp. In 33 patients the infection settled completely after treatment with culture specific antibiotics. These were given intravenously then orally for up to 6 weeks. Sixteen patients required debridement and excision of necrotic wound edges, including one who had an antibiotic infusion into the wound. Graft excision was performed in seven patients of whom five received an extra anatomic bypass. The need for graft excision was much greater (six versus one) for Dacron and/or polytetrafluoroethylene than for vein. In two lymph fistulae sartorius transposition and wound resuture were used. All groins healed, though three extremities were ischaemic following occlusion of the bypass. There were two deaths, one from myocardial infarction and one from pulmonary embolism and no major amputations. These results suggest that most infective groin problems may be successfully managed conservatively and that radical graft excision is only necessary for a few intractable cases.\r"

Most renal artery stenoses were atherosclerotic. Nineteen PTRAs were successful or partly successful and two failed; the patients were operated on without delay. All surgical reconstructions were successful. In the PTRA group six restenoses occurred after 4-24 months. Four were treated with re-PTRA and two were operated on. No recurrence occurred in the operated group. At the end of follow-up (median 48, range 9-84 months) primary patency in the PTRA group was 69 per cent and in the operated group 100 per cent. Secondary patency in the PTRA group was 100 per cent. With regard to hypertension, including primary and secondary results, 19 out of 21 (90 per cent) patients were improved in the PTRA group and 13 out of 16 (81 per cent) in the operated group. The diagnostic and preprocedure costs were the same in both groups, whereas the procedure and postprocedure costs were lower in the PTRA group. However, the follow-up costs were considerably higher because of recurrences and their treatment in the PTRA group. The total median cost of reconstructive surgery was 12 per cent higher than for PTRA, a non-significant difference.\r"

Of the limbs, 180 (82 per cent) had varicose veins without obstruction in the deep veins or reflux in the popliteal or femoral veins while 41 (18 per cent) had deep venous disease. Of the 180 limbs with 'primary' varicose veins 110 (60 per cent) did not have incompetent calf perforating veins (group A) while 70 (40 per cent) did (group B). On the basis of the ambulatory venous pressure after calf muscle exercise and the refilling time, the incompetent calf perforating veins of limbs in group B belonged to three subgroups of different haemodynamic significance. In 20 limbs (30 per cent) they were found to be of no haemodynamic significance, in 25 (35 per cent) of moderate haemodynamic significance and in 25 (35 per cent) of major haemodynamic significance. The last were, on clinical examination, indistinguishable from limbs with deep venous disease although they had patent deep veins with competent popliteal valves.\r"

  ".W": "Characterization of P2-purinoceptor subtypes has facilitated understanding of the many diverse effects produced by purine nucleotides. P2X-Purinoceptors are located on vascular smooth muscle where they mediate vasoconstriction resulting from ATP released as a cotransmitter with noradrenaline from sympathetic nerves. P2Y-Purinoceptors are usually located on the vascular endothelium where they have a role as mediators of vascular relaxation by locally produced ATP. In some vessels, P2Y-purinoceptors are also located on the smooth muscle, perhaps in association with purinergic or sensory nerves, where they can elicit direct relaxation to neuronally released ATP. The net effect of ATP and its analogues on isolated vessels or on vascular beds will be the results of actions mediated by P2X- and P2Y-purinoceptor subtypes, although changes in vascular tone and in integrity of nerves and endothelial cells may alter the balance of the response. Such changes have been observed in diseased states (e.g., atherosclerosis) and may have important implications for the involvement of P2-purinoceptors in, for example, vasospasm. The development of selective and potent antagonists to P2X- and P2Y-purinoceptors has so far remained elusive, and their therapeutic potential can only be guessed.\r"

We used 7- to 9-French fiber-optic angioscopes and 20- to 30-MHz intravascular ultrasound imaging catheters. Three observers assigned an angioscopic and ultrasound image classification to each vessel segment. The image and histological classification categories were then compared. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of both methods separately or in combination for normal vessels were each greater than or equal to 95%. The predictive value was better for angioscopy than for ultrasound due to incorrect ultrasound interpretations of normal anatomy in the presence of thrombus. For stable atheroma the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the individual methods were each greater than 90%. However, both angioscopy and ultrasound had classification errors in that disrupted atheroma was identified and classified as stable atheroma. Consequently, the predictive value was 74% for angioscopy and 78% for ultrasound. For disrupted atheroma the sensitivities for angioscopy and ultrasound were only moderate (73% and 81%, respectively), whereas the specificity, accuracy, and predictive value were each high (greater than 90%). For thrombus detection, the specificity, accuracy, and predictive value were high (greater than 93%) for each method. The sensitivity of angioscopy was 100%. However, sensitivity was lower for ultrasound (57%) due to false-negative interpretation of laminar clots in normal vessels and an inability to distinguish disrupted or stable atheroma from intraluminal thrombus. CONCLUSIONS. Contingency analyses showed that each imaging method alone or combined had significant agreement with the results obtained from histology (p less than 0.001). When assessing all cases in which angioscopy and ultrasound were concordant, there was a 92% agreement with the histological classification.\r"

However, the mechanisms underlying hypercholesterolemia, elevated low density lipoprotein (LDL) in particular, are not well understood. To determine these mechanisms, we studied LDL kinetics in a group of men with primary hypercholesterolemia. METHODS AND RESULTS. LDL kinetics in 134 middle-aged men with high-risk levels of LDL cholesterol (more than 160 mg/dl) were compared with kinetics in 16 men with borderline high-risk levels of LDL cholesterol (120-159 mg/dl) and 14 men with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (non-FH) were further divided into moderate hypercholesterolemia (LDL cholesterol, 160-210 mg/dl; n = 108) and severe hypercholesterolemia groups (LDL cholesterol, more than 210 mg/dl; n = 26). Four factors contributed to increasing LDL cholesterol concentrations above the borderline range to moderately elevated levels: 37 patients had no increase in LDL apolipoprotein (apo) B levels but had abnormally high LDL cholesterol-to-apo B ratios; 14 patients had very low fractional catabolic rates (FCRs) for LDL, similar to FH patients; 35 patients had FCRs for LDL in the borderline range but high production rates for LDL; and 22 patients had a high flux of LDL (high production rates and high FCRs). In general, patients with severe hypercholesterolemia resembled those with moderate LDL elevations, except that their LDL particles were enriched with cholesterol. CONCLUSIONS. Data from the present study reveal that there are several distinct patterns of LDL metabolism responsible for primary hypercholesterolemia. These patterns can serve as the basis for further investigation to determine the molecular defects responsible for each pattern.\r"

We investigated the association of cholesterol concentrations in serum high density lipoprotein (HDL) and its subfractions HDL2 and HDL3 with the risk of acute myocardial infarction in 1,799 randomly selected men 42, 48, 54, or 60 years old. METHODS AND RESULTS. Baseline examinations in the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study were done during 1984-1987. In Cox multivariate survival models adjusted for age and examination year, serum HDL cholesterol of less than 1.09 mmol/l (42 mg/dl) was associated with a 3.3-fold risk of acute myocardial infarction (95% confidence intervals [CI], 1.7-6.4), serum HDL2, cholesterol of less than 0.65 mmol/l (25 mg/dl) was associated with a 4.0-fold risk of acute myocardial infarction (95% CI, 1.9-8.3), and serum HDL3 cholesterol of less than 0.40 mmol/l (15 mg/dl) was associated with a 2.0-fold (95% CI, 1.1-4.0) risk of acute myocardial infarction. Adjustments for obesity, ischemic heart disease, other cardiovascular disease, maximal oxygen uptake, systolic blood pressure, antihypertensive medication, serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations reduced the excess risks associated with serum HDL, HDL2, and HDL3 cholesterol in the lowest quartiles by 52%, 48%, and 41%, respectively. Additional adjustments for alcohol consumption, cigarettes smoked daily, smoking years, and leisure time energy expenditure reduced these excess risks associated with low HDL, HDL2, and HDL3 cholesterol levels by another 26%, 24% and 21%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS. Our data confirm that both total HDL and HDL2 levels have inverse associations with the risk of acute myocardial infarction and may thus be protective factors in ischemic heart disease, whereas the role of HDL3 remains equivocal.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Endurance athletes have higher high density lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations than sedentary controls. To examine the mechanism for this effect, we compared HDL apoprotein metabolism in 10 endurance athletes aged 34 +/- 6 years (mean +/- SD) and 10 sedentary men aged 36 +/- 8 years. METHODS AND RESULTS. Subjects were maintained on controlled diets for 4 weeks, and metabolic studies using autologously labeled 125I HDL were performed during the final 2 weeks. Lipids and lipoproteins were measured daily during these 2 weeks, and the average of 14 values was used in the analysis. HDL cholesterol (58 +/- 14 versus 41 +/- 10 mg/dl), HDL2 cholesterol (26 +/- 10 versus 12 +/- 8 mg/dl), and apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) (144 +/- 18 versus 115 +/- 22 mg/dl) were higher in the athletes, whereas triglyceride concentrations (60 +/- 18 versus 110 +/- 48 mg/dl) were lower (p less than 0.01 for all). Postheparin lipoprotein lipase activity was not different, but hepatic triglyceride lipase activity was 27% lower (p less than 0.06) in the athletes. The athletes' mean clearance rate of triglycerides after an infusion of Travamulsion (1 ml/kg) was nearly twofold that of the inactive men (5.8 +/- 1.5 versus 3.2 +/- 0.9%/min, p less than 0.001). There was no differences in HDL apoprotein synthetic rates, whereas the catabolic rates of both apo A-I (0.15 +/- 0.02 versus 0.22 +/- 0.05 pools per day, p less than 0.01) and apolipoprotein A-II (apo A-II) (0.15 +/- 0.02 versus 0.20 +/- 0.04 pools per day, p less than 0.05) were reduced in the trained men. Apo A-I and apo A-II half-lives correlated with HDL cholesterol in each group (r greater than 0.76, p less than 0.05 for all) but not consistently with lipase activities or fat clearance rates. This relation between apoprotein catabolism and HDL cholesterol was strongest at HDL cholesterol concentrations of less than 60 mg/dl. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that higher HDL levels in active men are associated with increased HDL protein survival. The mechanisms mediating this effect require better definition, and other factors appear to contribute to HDL cholesterol and protein concentrations among individual subjects.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. This study was designed to investigate the relation of a molecular analysis of apolipoprotein B (apoB)-containing atherogenic lipoprotein particles to coronary artery disease (CAD) in middle-aged men. METHODS AND RESULTS. Two groups of men were studied. The first consisted of 97 patients with angiographically documented CAD (greater than 50% stenosis of at least one coronary artery). The second group consisted of 145 subjects without symptomatic CAD, who served as controls. In both groups, measurements were obtained for total cholesterol level, triglyceride level, cholesterol contents in apoB- and nonapoB-containing particles (LpB, LpnonB), total apoB and apolipoprotein AI (apoAI levels), lipoprotein particles recognized by monoclonal antibodies anti-apoB (LpBL3, LpBL5, LpBL7) and anti-apoAI (LpAI-2GII). Taking into account age, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, smoking habits, and drug consumption, the analysis showed that the mean levels of cholesterol were identical in both groups but differed when cholesterol content in LpB and LpnonB subfractions were assessed, thus reflecting an increase in the low density fraction and a decrease in the high density fraction, respectively. This was confirmed by an increase in total apoB and a decrease in total apoAI. Measurements of LpBL3, LpBL5, LpBL7, and LpAI-2GII particles also discriminated between the two groups. After adjustment for cholesterol content in LpnonB particles, a difference in total apoB was no longer significant between groups, whereas LpBL3, LpBL5, and LpBL7 levels remained significantly higher in CAD patients. CONCLUSIONS. The measurement of separate concentrations of apoB in different particles may permit a more-accurate assessment of CAD risk than measurements of total apoB levels.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The value of lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] in the prediction of coronary artery disease risk very early in life remains to be established in different racial groups. METHODS AND RESULTS. Serum Lp(a) distribution and its relation to parental histories of myocardial infarction were examined in 2,438 children (8-17 years old) from a biracial community. Parental myocardial infarction was used as a surrogate measure of future risk of disease in the offspring. Lp(a) levels averaged 1.7-fold higher in blacks than in whites (p less than 0.0001). A small but significant sex difference (females greater than males, p less than 0.05) was seen in both races. Race was the only independent variable that contributed appreciably (9%) to the variability of Lp(a) in serum. White children with parental myocardial infarction (n = 90) had increased levels of Lp(a) compared with those without parental myocardial infarction (22.4 versus 17.1 mg/dl, p less than 0.01). Furthermore, among white children, the prevalence of parental myocardial infarction was higher in those with Lp(a) levels of more than 25 mg/dl than in those with values of 25 mg/dl or less (9.5% versus 5.4%, p less than 0.01). In contrast, the relation of Lp(a) to parental myocardial infarction was not seen in black children. No associations were observed between parental myocardial infarction and serum levels of any of the lipids or lipoprotein cholesterol classes in children of either race. CONCLUSIONS. Serum Lp(a) levels may prove valuable in the assessment of coronary artery disease risk early in life among white populations. These findings also emphasize the need to evaluate the atherogenic potential of Lp(a) in different racial groups.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The somatostatin analogue, ectrootide, is being used to treat postprandial hypotension in patients with autonomic neuropathy. Although the therapeutic effect of the drug is presumably secondary to a splanchnic vasoconstrictor action, its effect on splanchnic hemodynamics has never been characterized in patients with autonomic neuropathy. Moreover, it is unknown whether octreotide acts on other vascular beds in this group of patients or whether it affects cardiac output. We, therefore, measured splanchnic, forearm, and systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output before and after administering octreotide (0.4 microgram/kg s.c.) to patients with idiopathic autonomic neuropathy and diabetic autonomic neuropathy. METHODS AND RESULTS. Splanchnic blood flow was determined from the clearance of indocyanine green in seven patients. We observed that octreotide decreased splanchnic blood flow (from 850 +/- 77 to 664 +/- 48 ml/min, p less than 0.005), increased mean blood pressure (from 97 +/- 6 to 115 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.005), and increased splanchnic vascular resistance (from 0.118 +/- 0.012 to 0.18 +/- 0.018 mm Hg/ml/min, p less than 0.005). Forearm blood flow was measured by plethysmography in 13 patients. Octreotide increased forearm vascular resistance in patients with idiopathic autonomic neuropathy (n = 8) from 19.1 +/- 1.0 to 27.2 +/- 3.8 mm Hg/ml/min/100 ml forearm volume (p less than 0.01) and from 25.2 +/- 3.9 to 41.0 +/- 6.8 mm Hg/ml/min/100 ml (p less than 0.01) in patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy (n = 5). Cardiac output was measured by two-dimensional echocardiography. Octreotide administration increased cardiac output in five of six patients with idiopathic autonomic neuropathy (from 4.4 +/- 0.4 to 5.0 +/- 0.5 l/min, p less than 0.02) and five of five patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy (from 3.8 +/- 0.4 to 5.1 +/- 0.4 l/min, p less than 0.02). Systemic vascular resistance increased in patients with idiopathic autonomic neuropathy from 21.2 +/- 2 to 24.9 +/- 2.6 (p less than 0.05) but did not change in patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy. CONCLUSION. The pressor effect of octreotide in patients with autonomic neuropathy is associated with increased splanchnic and forearm vascular resistance and with increased cardiac output.\r"

Because transesophageal echocardiography selects a patient population with a high prevalence of valvular lesions, we prospectively evaluated the risk of transient bacteremia associated with transesophageal echocardiography in 49 patients. Blood cultures were obtained immediately before transesophageal echocardiography and at 5, 10, and 20 minutes after the start of the procedure. For each culture, 30 ml venous blood was obtained and 10 ml was inoculated into each of an Isolator tube, Septi-chek bottle, and a nonvented Trypticase soy broth bottle. Broth cultures were incubated for 14 days. Blood from the Isolator tube was plated onto appropriate media for recovery of bacteria and fungi. Two patients were excluded from analysis because the final two sets of blood cultures could not be obtained. Among the remaining 47 study patients, two preprocedure control blood cultures were positive, and two of 141 subsequent cultures were positive. All isolates were considered contaminants. Thus, we found no significant bacteremia due to pathogenic oral flora during transesophageal echocardiography (0%; 95% CI, 0.0-7.5%). CONCLUSIONS. Although recommendations for antimicrobial prophylaxis for transesophageal echocardiography should be individualized for each patient, many patients may not require antimicrobial prophylaxis.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The strength-interval relation between the intensity of premature stimulus and the ventricular effective refractory period (VERP) has been well characterized. The effects of variation in the intensity of the basic drive train stimuli (S1) on VERP are not as well defined. This relation was studied in 44 patients undergoing clinically indicated electrophysiological study. METHODS AND RESULTS. The outputs of two stimulus isolation units were connected in parallel, allowing the intensity of S1 to be varied independently of intensity of the extrastimulus (S2). To prevent confounding effects from cycle length change, continuous overdrive pacing was performed for 3 minutes before each measurement of VERP. The effect of S1 intensity on VERP was assessed in 24 patients with S2 intensity kept constant at twice threshold. VERP shortened from 232 +/- 19 msec at an S1 intensity of 1.5 times threshold to 219 +/- 20 msec at 5 mA and 211 +/- 19 msec at 10 mA (p less than 0.0001 for baseline versus 5 mA and for 5 mA versus 10 mA). Autonomic blockade with atropine and propranolol blunted but did not completely eliminate this effect. To assess whether the effect of S1 intensity on VERP was independent of S2 intensity, S2 strength-interval curves were generated in 10 patients at low (1.5 times threshold) and high (10 mA) S1 intensities. All portions of the strength-interval curve were shifted to the left by an increase in S1 intensity. The time course of change in VERP after an abrupt increase in S1 intensity was assessed in an additional 10 patients. VERP changed slowly, requiring 18 +/- 28 seconds to shorten by 2 msec and 64 +/- 46 seconds to decrease by 10 msec after a change in S1 intensity from 1.5 times threshold to 10 mA. In a final group of 10 patients, VERP was measured using an eight-beat drive train and a 4-second intertrain interval. With this more conventional protocol, VERP shortened by 14 +/- 8 msec with an increase in S1 intensity from 1.5 times threshold to 10 mA. CONCLUSIONS. Increasing S1 intensity results in clinically significant, progressive shortening of VERP in man. This effect is independent of S2 intensity. The prolonged time course of the change in VERP after an increase in S1 intensity and the attenuation of this effect by autonomic blockade are consistent with stimulation of sympathetic nerve terminals and catecholamine release as a result of intense stimulation.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Transcatheter electrical ablation has been used in the treatment of arrhythmias, and most experience has been obtained by ablating the normal atrioventricular conduction system. Less information is available on ablation of atrioventricular accessory pathways. METHODS AND RESULTS. Catheter ablation of overt accessory pathways was attempted in 135 patients with 142 distinct pathways, including 21 right parietal or anteroseptal, 47 posteroseptal, and 74 left lateral pathways. We sought to identify the type and value of electrophysiological parameters associated with successful ablation outcome. For this purpose, the unipolar recording mode was used in addition to bipolar anterograde and retrograde parameters. With a mean follow-up of 16 +/- 6 (mean +/- SD) months, fulguration was successful in eliminating preexcitation in 129 patients (96%), including all seven with two distinct accessory pathways. The first ablation attempt was successful in 110 patients, and two or more attempts were performed in 25 patients. Bipolar electrograms associated with success of fulguration showed a shorter atrioventricular conduction time (40 +/- 13 versus 53 +/- 17 msec, p less than 0.0001) and an earlier main ventricular deflection relative to delta wave onset (-1.7 +/- 10 versus 5 +/- 7 msec, p less than 0.001) than electrograms associated with unsuccessful outcome. The only parameter dealing with retrograde conduction (i.e., ventriculoatrial conduction time during reciprocating tachycardia) was not predictive (86 +/- 17 versus 93 +/- 17 msec). Neither was the atrial to ventricular electrogram amplitude ratio. Two unipolar parameters were found to be predictive of successful outcome: 1) The three different patterns PQS, P-QS, P-rS of unipolar waves recorded at the annulus were associated with respective success rates of 97%, 78%, and 55% (p less than 0.001). 2) Intrinsic deflection timing occurred -4 +/- 8 and 6 +/- 7 msec relative to delta wave onset in successful attempts and in failures, respectively (p less than 0.001). Logistic regression analysis revealed a single independent factor predictive of success, the unipolar pattern (p = 0.03), with an odds ratio of 7:1 (PQS pattern versus P-rS pattern). In the group of 18 patients who underwent a first unsuccessful but second successful attempt, comparison of electrograms revealed no difference in the ventriculoatrial conduction time but a significant improvement in anterograde parameters and unipolar pattern distribution. CONCLUSIONS. Some distinctive electrogram patterns concerning anterograde conduction are associated with success of accessory pathway fulguration. The unfiltered unipolar recording mode (PQS pattern) contributes significantly to optimizing the accuracy of accessory pathway localization.\r"

Abnormalities of small coronary vessels have been invoked as a cause of angina. METHODS AND RESULTS. To quantitatively evaluate the morphology of capillaries in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) or the syndrome of angina and small vessel disease (SVD), we performed electron microscopic morphometry of capillaries in right ventricular biopsy samples taken from 32 patients. Ten had angina, normal epicardial coronary arteries, and evidence for SVD; 12 had DCM; and 10 had normal hearts. In patients with DCM, the ratio of microvessels to myocytes was not different than that of controls (0.49 +/- 0.06 versus 0.51 +/- 0.05). Mean cross-sectional areas of the capillaries (lumen plus wall) and lumen were significantly greater than those of controls (45.3 +/- 15.1 versus 22.7 +/- 8.3 micron 2, p less than 0.001; 17.6 +/- 6.9 versus 11.6 +/- 6.2 micron 2, p less than 0.05, respectively).

In contrast, in patients with SVD, the capillary-to-myocyte ratio was reduced (0.33 +/- 0.08, p less than 0.001). Although mean cross-sectional areas of the entire capillary (32.4 +/- 19.7 micron 2) and the lumen (8.9 +/- 7.8 micron 2) were not statistically different than those of controls, there was an absence of capillaries less than 15 micron 2 in cross-sectional area, and the frequency distribution of the lumen area was skewed to the left. Swollen endothelial cells frequently encroached upon the lumen. There was a mild increase in fibrous content (9.5 +/- 3.7%, p less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS. Enlarged capillaries and a normal ratio of capillaries to myocytes appear to be features of DCM. Of the patients with SVD, there was both a relative lack of capillaries and capillary lumen narrowing from swollen endothelium. These changes may induce ischemia and angina and may result in mild fibrosis.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Effects of pacing-induced and coronary occlusion myocardial ischemia on left ventricular (LV) function have been compared only in anesthetized dogs. Diastolic properties of the same LV anterior wall segment were therefore compared in 12 patients with single-vessel proximal left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis at rest, immediately after 7 +/- 1.2 minutes of pacing, and at the end of a 1-minute balloon occlusion of coronary angioplasty (CO). METHODS AND RESULTS. Shifts of the diastolic LV pressure-length relation, derived from simultaneous tip-micromanometer LV pressure recordings and digital subtraction LV angiograms, were used as an index of regional diastolic LV distensibility of the anterior wall segment. Immediately after pacing, LV end-diastolic pressure rose from 13.5 +/- 3.5 to 23.8 +/- 7.0 mm Hg (p less than 0.01 versus at rest) without a significant change of the LV end-diastolic volume index (83.1 +/- 18.9 versus 88.4 +/- 16.5 ml/m2), percentage systolic shortening (%SS) of the ischemic segment fell from 40.1 +/- 10.6% to 25.2 +/- 8.6% (p less than 0.01), and the diastolic LV pressure-radial length (P-RL) plot of the ischemic segment was shifted upward by 7.1 +/- 5.0 mm Hg for portions of the plot that overlapped with the diastolic LV P-RL plot at rest. At the end of CO, LV end-diastolic pressure rose to 20.8 +/- 7.8 mm Hg (p less than 0.01 versus at rest) and the LV end-diastolic volume index rose to 95.6 +/- 16.3 ml/m2 (p less than 0.05 versus at rest, p less than 0.05 versus after pacing). Ejection fraction and %SS of the ischemic segment fell respectively from 76.6 +/- 6.8% to 46.6 +/- 11.4% (p less than 0.01 versus at rest, p less than 0.01 versus after pacing) and from 40.1 +/- 10.6% to 6.4 +/- 8.6% (p less than 0.01 versus at rest, p less than 0.01 versus after pacing). The diastolic LV P-RL plot of the ischemic segment was shifted upward by 3.1 +/- 2.3 mm Hg for portions of the plot that overlapped with the diastolic LV P-RL plot at rest. This upward shift at the end of CO was significantly smaller (p less than 0.05) than that immediately after pacing. At the end of CO, a correlation (p less than 0.03) was observed for the ischemic segment between %SS and upward shift of the diastolic LV P-RL plot. CONCLUSIONS. The upward shift of the diastolic LV P-RL plot, which was used as an index of decreased regional diastolic LV distensibility, was larger immediately after pacing than at the end of CO. Persistent systolic shortening of ischemic myocardium seems to be a prerequisite for a decrease in diastolic distensibility of the ischemic segment because of the higher %SS of the ischemic segment immediately after pacing, and because of the correlation at the end of CO between the upward shift of the diastolic LV P-RL plot and %SS of the ischemic segment.\r"

  ".U": "91284326\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The predilection of the left atrial appendage (LAA) for thrombus formation has long been known. METHODS AND RESULTS. We prospectively studied the two-dimensional echocardiographic and Doppler patterns of LAA function in 82 patients by transesophageal echocardiography. In the 63 patients in sinus rhythm, LAA area was measured during LAA diastole at the onset of the electrocardiographic (ECG) P wave (LAAmax) and after LAA systole at the ECG R wave (LAAmin) and LAA ejection fraction was calculated as (LAAmax-LAAmin)/LAAmax; peak Doppler velocity was recorded from the LAA outlet. The 58 patients in sinus rhythm without LAA thrombus were grouped according to left atrial size on transthoracic echocardiography; 39 patients had a left atrial size of less than 40 mm (group 1) and 19 had a left atrial size of 40 mm or greater (group 2). Five patients in sinus rhythm had LAA thrombus. In the 19 patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter LAAmax was measured independent of the ECG; three of these patients had LAA spontaneous contrast, four had thrombus, and one had both. Patients in sinus rhythm without LAA thrombus demonstrated a characteristic pattern of a contractile LAA apex and a noncontractile base with color flow and pulsed Doppler evidence of LAA emptying that coincided with the P wave. Patients in sinus rhythm with LAA thrombus had a mean +/- SD LAAmax (8.0 +/- 1.5 cm2) larger than that in group 1 (5.0 +/- 1.9 cm2) (p less than 0.01) but not group 2 (6.7 +/- 3.1 cm2), LAAmin (6.5 +/- 1.0 cm2) larger than that in both group 1 (2.3 +/- 1.5 cm2) and group 2 (4.2 +/- 2.7 cm2) (p less than 0.01), and LAA ejection fraction (17 +/- 11%) and LAA velocity (0.24 +/- 0.10 m/sec) less than those in both group 1 (55 +/- 21% and 0.48 +/- 0.24 m/sec, respectively) and group 2 (45 +/- 27% and 0.46 +/- 0.24 m/sec, respectively) (p less than 0.01). Patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter with LAA spontaneous contrast and/or thrombus had LAAmax (10.4 +/- 6.6 cm2) greater than that in patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter without LAA contrast and/or thrombus (6.8 +/- 3.0 cm2) (p less than 0.05). The LAA appeared as a static pouch in seven of eight of the former compared with in two of 11 of the latter. When attempted, Doppler demonstrated a recognizable fibrillatory LAA outflow velocity pattern in none of three in the former versus four of seven in the latter group. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that the LAA has a characteristic pattern of emptying in sinus rhythm. LAA thrombus formation in sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation is associated with both poor LAA contraction and LAA dilation.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The ability to predict outcome after mitral valve replacement remains limited in patients with symptomatic chronic mitral regurgitation. The aims of this study were to determine the preoperative predictors of postoperative cardiac-related mortality and to assess the additive prognostic value of tests performed in such patients. METHODS AND RESULTS. Accordingly, 176 patients (mean age, 57 +/- 14 years) who underwent mitral valve replacement were followed up for 3.8 +/- 0.5 years. Four categories of variables were analyzed to predict postoperative cardiac-related mortality: clinical, laboratory, two-dimensional echocardiographic (2DE), and cardiac catheterization. There were 39 cardiac-related deaths (29 due to congestive heart failure and 10 sudden). When the four categories were analyzed separately, two clinical, one laboratory, two 2DE, and one catheterization variable best predicted postoperative death. When these six variables were examined simultaneously, only three (one clinical and two 2DE) remained significant predictors of cardiac-related mortality: presence of pulmonary rales, left atrial size, and the ratio of left ventricular wall thickness to left ventricular cavity dimension in end systole. A model based on these three variables may predict cardiac-related death with considerable accuracy. Laboratory data did not add to clinical information for predicting death. 2DE variables provided significant additional information in this regard (p less than 0.001). Further addition of catheterization variables was not useful. Prognostic value did not change significantly when 50 patients with prior mitral valve surgery or 49 patients undergoing concomitant aortic valve replacement or coronary artery bypass surgery were excluded from analysis. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that 1) measures of both left ventricular systolic function and left atrial size are equally important in predicting postoperative cardiac-related mortality in patients with symptomatic chronic mitral regurgitation undergoing mitral valve replacement; 2) left atrial size may be important because it reflects the \"history\" (severity and duration) of mitral regurgitation; 3) 2DE assessment of left atrial size and left ventricular function provides prognostic information that is significantly greater than that obtained from clinical and laboratory parameters alone; the addition of catheterization variables does not increase the prognostic value of the clinical and 2DE data.\r"

  ".U": "91284328\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The effectiveness of balloon angioplasty is limited by a restenosis rate of approximately 30%. Recombinant desulphatohirudin (r-hirudin [CGP 39393]) has been found to be highly effective in preventing acute platelet-rich thrombosis after deep arterial injury as compared with heparin. METHODS AND RESULTS. This study evaluated the effect of intravenous r-hirudin, a selective inhibitor of thrombin, on restenosis after balloon angioplasty in 29 rabbits. Focal femoral atherosclerosis was induced by air desiccation endothelial injury followed by a 2% cholesterol diet for 1 month. At angioplasty (2.5-mm balloon with three 60-second, 10-atm inflations 60 seconds apart), the rabbits received heparin (150 units/kg bolus, n = 16) or r-hirudin (1 mg/kg bolus followed by infusions of 1 mg/kg for the first hour and 0.5 mg/kg for the second hour, n = 13). Angiograms performed before and after angioplasty and before death were analyzed quantitatively by a blinded observer. Rabbits were killed 2 hours (n = 14) or 28 days (n = 15) after angioplasty. Femoral arteries were fixed in situ by perfusion of 10% formaldehyde at 100 mm Hg. The mean luminal diameter of the arteries with successful angioplasty (greater than or equal to 20% increase in luminal diameter) in rabbits treated with heparin (n = 8 arteries) increased from 1.18 +/- 0.29 mm before angioplasty to 1.86 +/- 0.24 mm immediately after angioplasty (p less than 0.001) and decreased to 0.94 +/- 0.69 mm (p = 0.0004) at 28 days after angioplasty. In rabbits treated with r-hirudin (n = 11 arteries), the mean luminal diameter increased from 1.14 +/- 0.17 mm before angioplasty to 1.68 +/- 0.20 mm immediately after angioplasty (p less than 0.001) and decreased to 1.37 +/- 0.47 mm (p = 0.01) at 28 days after angioplasty. The mean reduction in luminal diameter by angiography was less in the r-hirudin-treated group than in the heparin-treated group (0.30 +/- 0.33 versus 0.92 +/- 0.61 mm, p = 0.01). Blinded planimetric analysis of stained histological sections of the femoral arteries also showed less cross-sectional area narrowing by plaque in rabbits treated with r-hirudin compared with those treated with heparin (22 +/- 16% verus 48 +/- 29%, p = 0.01). Both groups had similar numbers of arteries with histological evidence of balloon-induced plaque tear (12 of 13 versus 13 of 15). CONCLUSIONS. Rabbits receiving r-hirudin at the time of experimental balloon angioplasty had significantly less restenosis by angiography and by quantitative histopathology than rabbits receiving heparin.\r"

The reductions of myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor density and responsiveness to catecholamines in congestive heart failure are associated with excessive sympathetic stimulation. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the myocardial changes could be prevented by beta-receptor blockade. METHODS AND RESULTS. We administered the oral beta-receptor blocking agent nadolol (40 mg/day) to dogs during an early stage of experimental right heart failure and to sham-operated dogs for 5 weeks. Animals receiving no nadolol were studied concurrently. Nadolol treatment did not prevent right ventricular hypertrophy or elevated concentrations of plasma norepinephrine that occurred in right heart failure, nor did it affect the decrease in myocardial norepinephrine content and norepinephrine uptake activity, suggesting that the hemodynamic stress imposed on the right ventricle of dogs with right heart failure was similar regardless of the presence or absence of beta-receptor blockade. Resting heart rate, right atrial pressure, aortic pressure, cardiac output, right ventricular dP/dt, and left ventricular dP/dt and dP/dt/P measured 5 days after discontinuation of nadolol did not differ significantly from those without nadolol treatment in either right heart failure or sham-operated animals. Sham-operated dogs also showed no changes in myocardial beta-receptor or adenylate cyclase activity after nadolol treatment. However, nadolol treatment prevented the reduction of myocardial beta-receptor density and attenuated the decrease in the cardiac beta-adrenergic sensitivity that occurred in right heart failure. CONCLUSIONS. Excessive sympathetic stimulation may play an important role in the development of beta-receptor downregulation and beta-adrenergic subsensitivity in right heart failure.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. DC shock catheter ablation for the treatment of ventricular tachycardia (VT) may induce VT episodes that disappear within days. METHODS AND RESULTS. A 30-J cathodal shock was delivered to the endocardial left ventricular wall in 15 closed-chest dogs. All dogs had VT during the first day after ablation. Eleven of these dogs were studied on the first day. Extensive epicardial and endocardial activation mapping in vivo, in Langendorff-perfused hearts, and in tissue blocks in a tissue bath localized the site of origin of VT to subendocardial Purkinje fibers in a border zone surrounding the central necrotic ablation lesion. Intracellular recording showed that this zone consisted of a subendocardial superficial layer (SSL) of cells with abnormal characteristics, a resting membrane potential (RMP) of -58 +/- 11 mV (mean +/- SD), and an action potential amplitude (APA) of 61 +/- 20 mV. In addition, the steepness of phase 0 of the action potential was markedly reduced. In three dogs abnormal automaticity was found in a very small area. Immediately below the SSL, cells were normal with an RMP of -78 +/- 5 mV and an APA of 107 +/- 8 mV. Histology confirmed a thin SSL with edematous and necrotic cells, hemorrhage, and infiltration. The other four dogs were studied at 1 week after ablation when VT was absent. Microelectrode impalement in the SSL was either impossible or showed nearly normal action potential characteristics. Histological examination showed a markedly thickened fibrotic subendocardial layer at places where impalement was impossible. Normal subendocardium was found in other areas of the border zone. CONCLUSIONS. Our results indicate that VT after DC shock ablation originates from cells with abnormal automaticity in the superficial subendocardial border zone around the central ablation lesion. Within 1 week edematous and necrotic cells in this border zone are replaced by a fibrotic layer, and this transition is associated with the disappearance of VT.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. We have previously shown, in dogs with severe cardiac depression, that modest cyclic increases in intrathoracic pressure, starting synchronously with left ventricular isovolumic contraction, significantly increase aortic flow and pressure. However, little is known of changes in vital organ perfusion during this technique of assisted circulation. METHODS AND RESULTS. We studied regional organ flow using radioactive labeled microspheres in 13 20-25-kg mongrel dogs. In the control group, after chemical induction of cardiac depression with verapamil and propranolol, coronary flow fell from 129.1 +/- 14.4 to 51.6 +/- 11.3 ml/100 g/min (p less than 0.005) and continued to decline over a 14-minute time period (flow was 32.2 +/- 11.5 ml/100 g/min at 7 minutes and 20.7 +/- 9.5 ml/100 g/min at 14 minutes [n = 6]; all p less than 0.05). In the intervention group, regional blood flow was evaluated before and after the induction of cardiac depression and also during assisted circulation using 400-msec, 20-25-mm Hg intrathoracic pressure increases delivered by a circumthoracic pneumatic vest, starting synchronously with left ventricular isovolumic contraction. In the intervention group, coronary flow fell from 119 +/- 26.7 to 47.9 +/- 13.1 ml/100 g/min 1 minute after the induction of cardiac depression (p less than 0.005). With the initiation of assisted circulation, coronary flow increased to 55.8 +/- 19.2 ml/100 g/min at 7 minutes and fell to 23.1 +/- 15.9 ml/100 g/min on termination of assisted circulation at 14 minutes (p less than 0.05 and p = NS versus control group flows at 1 and 14 minutes, respectively). During assisted circulation, cerebral, renal, and small intestinal flows also increased (all p less than 0.05 versus flows during myocardial depression). No significant increase in hepatic flow was observed. CONCLUSIONS. In the canine model, manipulation of intrathoracic pressure appears to be an effective, short-term, noninvasive means of not only increasing aortic pressure but also increasing vital organ perfusion during cardiogenic shock. Further studies are needed to assess the usefulness of this technique of assisted circulation in humans.\r"

Activated protein C, the body's natural anticoagulant, may play a role in protecting the heart during and following an occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) in the porcine heart. METHODS AND RESULTS. Infusion of 1 unit thrombin over 30 seconds into the LAD of juvenile pigs produced a prolongation of the Xa clotting time (153 +/- 14%) in blood drawn from the anterior interventricular vein (AIV). The action of the anticoagulant was blocked by a polyclonal immunoglobulin G antibody directed against porcine activated protein C. A brief (30 seconds) occlusion of the LAD induced a similar prolongation of the Xa clotting time (138 +/- 11%), which was also blocked by the polyclonal antibody. To determine whether activated protein C helps sustain the heart during and following a 2-minute occlusion, three groups of pigs were studied: 11 controls, six receiving activated porcine protein C, and nine receiving a monoclonal antibody (HPC4) that blocks protein C activation. Relative to the controls, HPC4-treated animals recovered function, as measured by the maximum time derivative of left ventricular pressure and segmental shortening, more slowly and were not able to sustain this recovery. Animals receiving activated protein C recovered more quickly and sustained this recovery. CONCLUSIONS. These data indicate that an ischemic insult induces rapid activation of protein C in the coronary microcirulation and that blocking this activation impairs recovery.\r"

However, coronary vasodilation was only transient perhaps because of tachyphylaxis. In the present study, the steady-state effects of intravenous substance P on systemic and coronary beds were investigated in conscious, instrumented dogs. METHODS AND RESULTS. With intact autonomic reflexes, 5 ng/kg/min i.v. substance P resulted in increases (p less than 0.01) in cardiac output by 22 +/- 5%, in decreases (p less than 0.01) in mean arterial pressure by 9 +/- 2%, and in total peripheral resistance by 23 +/- 4% 7-9 minutes after the beginning of substance P infusion. Heart rate increased (p less than 0.01) by 35 +/- 7% and left ventricular dP/dt (p less than 0.05) by 13 +/- 4%. In this situation, coronary blood flow decreased (p less than 0.01) by 19 +/- 4% and coronary vascular resistance increased (p less than 0.05) by 13 +/- 5%. Myocardial oxygen delivery was reduced (p less than 0.05) by 13 +/- 5% and the arteriovenous oxygen difference widened (p less than 0.01). After ganglionic blockade, increases in cardiac output, heart rate, and left ventricular dP/dt with substance P administration were abolished, but total peripheral resistance and mean arterial pressure decreased (p less than 0.01) by 12 +/- 3% respectively. Under these conditions, coronary blood flow decreased (p less than 0.01) by 37 +/- 5% and coronary vascular resistance increased (p less than 0.01) by 47 +/- 8%, which were more (p less than 0.01) than control responses. In this situation, myocardial oxygen delivery was reduced (p less than 0.01) by 37 +/- 4% and the arteriovenous oxygen difference widened (p less than 0.01). Intracoronary infusion of substance P (0.4 ng/kg/min) resulted in significant and sustained decreases in coronary blood flow, which were similar before and after ganglionic blockade. CONCLUSIONS. Thus, in conscious dogs, systemic vasodilation is the prevailing effect of substance P, but paradoxically, this peptide simultaneously elicits coronary vasoconstriction.\r"

Potentially reversible congestive heart failure accompanies disease states associated with an immune cell myocardial infiltrate such as cardiac allograft rejection and inflammatory myocarditis.

Spontaneous synchronous cell beating produced macroscopic distortion of these membranes. Movement of free-floating membranes anchored within a perfusion chamber was visualized under low-power microscopy and measured from recordings of the rhythmic displacement of membrane-adherent markers. Additions of graded concentrations of isoproterenol to the perfusate produced up to threefold increases in the initial contractile phase velocity (contractile index), with an EC50 of 10(-7) M. When the extracellular Ca2+ concentration was increased from 0.9 to 3.6 mM, 2.43-fold increases in this index occurred. Myocytes incubated for 72 hours in the presence of dilutions of medium conditioned by activated rat splenic macrophages and lymphocytes exhibited an isoproterenol contractile index inhibited by 62% compared with control cells. In contrast, responses of supernatant-exposed and control cells to increased extracellular Ca2+ concentrations were not significantly different. Parallel studies of increases in myocyte intracellular adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate concentrations in response to isoproterenol stimulation demonstrated correlative inhibition that was specific for exposure to medium conditioned by immune cells. CONCLUSION. Thus, a new method of in vitro cardiac contractility assessment that has significant advantages over existing systems has been developed and characterized. This new method has enabled description of an inhibitor of cardiac contractile function produced by activated immune cells.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. We used biochemical and immunohistochemical techniques to investigate the expression and distribution of immunoreactive basic and acidic fibroblast growth factors (bFGF and aFGF, respectively) in the hearts of rat embryos (11-20 days of gestation) and of postnatal rats (1-35 days after birth). Our purpose was to assess the relation between the cellular distribution of these growth factors and histogenetic and morphogenetic events in the developing heart. METHODS AND RESULTS. Western-blot analysis of heparin-bound material from neonatal heart extracts identified a single band with a molecular weight of approximately 18 kD for both bFGF and aFGF. Five antibodies for bFGF and three for aFGF showed superimposable distribution of immunoreactive bFGF and aFGF in the heart at each stage examined. At the cellular level, these peptides were localized in the cytoplasm and extracellular matrix. In the myocytes, immunostaining was positive throughout the embryonic and neonatal periods. In the majority of the mesenchymal cells of the cushions and endothelial cells of endocardium and vessels, staining was also positive. In the smooth muscle cells of the aorta, other large arteries, and coronary arteries, immunostaining was intensely positive at early stages of development but became faint or negative with increasing cell differentiation. CONCLUSIONS. The wide distribution of immunoreactive bFGF and aFGF that we identified in the developing rat heart suggests that these growth factors play an important role in heart cytodifferentiation and morphogenesis. Their superimposable distribution may reflect functional interaction. The progressive changes in their distribution suggest a changing role for these peptides during organogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Creatine kinase (CK) exists as three cytosolic isoenzymes, CK-MM, CK-MB, and CK-BB, and one mitochondrial isoenzyme. Animal and human observations suggest that the CK-MB content of myocardium is dynamic and may increase in response to ischemia, but the response of the myocardial CK system to chronic coronary artery occlusion is not well-defined. METHODS AND RESULTS. We measured serial changes in myocardial total CK, percent CK-MB, and percent CK-BB before and 3 weeks after coronary artery occlusion in 17 pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs. Tissue biopsies were obtained from the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery myocardium, the right coronary artery (RCA) myocardium, and the circumflex coronary artery myocardium at baseline and 3 weeks after LAD occlusion (n = 6), RCA occlusion (n = 5), and no coronary artery occlusion (n = 6). Tissue samples were assayed for total CK, percent CK-MB, and percent CK-BB. Samples were also examined by electron microscopy for evidence of ischemic myopathy. Total myocardial CK activity did not change over 3 weeks. Percent CK-MB increased significantly in the tissue supplied by the occluded artery (4.1-fold in dogs with LAD occlusion and 6.7-fold in dogs with RCA occlusion). Percent CK-BB did not change. Dogs with LAD occlusion had ultrastructural evidence of myopathic fibers interspersed with normal fibers in the LAD myocardium. Dogs with RCA occlusion had no ultrastructural evidence of myopathic fibers in the RCA myocardium. CONCLUSIONS. Chronic coronary artery occlusion causes a pronounced change in the canine myocardial CK system that is limited to the tissue supplied by the occluded coronary artery. These biochemical alterations do not correlate with any cellular ultrastructural changes. Myocardial CK-MB content is dynamic, varies geographically within the heart, and increases rapidly after coronary artery occlusion.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. A brief coronary occlusion before a more prolonged occlusion results in less myocardial infarction than the longer occlusion alone. However, the effects of this preconditioning on recovery of systolic function after coronary occlusion have not been determined. METHODS AND RESULTS. Ultrasonic crystals implanted in rabbit myocardium measured segment length in the distribution of a branch of the left coronary artery that was fitted with a snare occluder. Rabbits were randomly allocated to either nonpreconditioned or preconditioned groups. Rabbits in the latter group underwent preconditioning with a 5-minute coronary occlusion followed by 10 minutes of reperfusion. Then the coronary artery was occluded for 20 minutes in all rabbits, after which it was allowed to reperfuse for 90 minutes. The hearts were then excised, and infarct size was measured by staining with triphenyltetrazolium chloride. During coronary occlusion, all hearts except one demonstrated either akinesis or paradoxical bulging. Five minutes after release of the 20-minute occlusion, active shortening had returned in the preconditioned rabbits and averaged 27.9 +/- 16.6% of baseline shortening. At the same time, paradoxical lengthening persisted in nonpreconditioned rabbits (-15.5 +/- 19.8% of baseline). By the end of the 90-minute reperfusion period, segment shortening averaged 40.1 +/- 8.4% of baseline in preconditioned rabbits and only 6.2 +/- 12.0% in nonpreconditioned rabbits (p less than 0.05). Infarct size as a percentage of risk area was significantly smaller in preconditioned rabbits as well (3.0 +/- 1.6% versus 28.8 +/- 7.0%, p less than 0.002) and likely accounted for the improved shortening. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that a brief coronary occlusion before a more prolonged occlusion results in not only reduced infarct size but also significantly better recovery of systolic function.\r"

This study tests whether adenosine receptors might mediate preconditioning protection. METHODS AND RESULTS. We examined the effect on infarct size of pretreatment with either of two adenosine receptor antagonists in both control and preconditioned in situ rabbit hearts. Hearts underwent 30 minutes of regional ischemia plus 3 hours of reperfusion, and infarct size was measured with tetrazolium. Infarct size averaged 39% of the zone at risk in controls but only 8% in preconditioned hearts. Preconditioned and nonpreconditioned hearts receiving either blocker had infarcts not different in size from the controls. A 5-minute intracoronary infusion of adenosine was as effective as 5 minutes of ischemia in protecting parabiotically perfused isolated hearts against infarction from a 45-minute ischemic insult. Similarly, intracoronary infusion of N6-1-(phenyl-2R-isopropyl)adenosine, an A1-selective adenosine receptor agonist, at a dose that delayed conduction but did not dilate the coronary vessels, also limited infarct size. The protection disappeared when we reduced the coronary concentration of drug by intravenous infusion of adenosine, indicating that cardiac rather than peripheral receptors were involved in the protection. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that adenosine released during the preconditioning occlusion stimulates cardiac A1 receptors, which leaves the heart protected against infarction even after the adenosine has been withdrawn.\r"

  ".U": "91284342\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Left ventricular sympathetic afferent nerves are located mainly in superficial epicardial layers. Reflex excitatory responses mediated by sympathetic afferent nerves have been observed during myocardial ischemia in cats and humans but not in dogs. Previous canine studies have induced ischemia by occlusion of a coronary artery. Extensive collateral circulation in the canine heart may limit ischemia of epicardial layers during simple coronary occlusion, resulting in little stimulation of sympathetic afferent nerves and minimal reflex excitatory responses. METHODS AND RESULTS. In anesthetized dogs with sinoaortic and vagal deafferentation, we determined whether reflex sympathoexcitatory responses mediated by sympathetic afferents occurred during transmural myocardial ischemia. Reflex sympathoexcitation was quantitated by direct recording from either efferent renal (n = 20) or cardiac (n = 5) sympathetic nerves. Responses of arterial pressure and efferent sympathetic nerve activity were measured during simple occlusion of the anterior descending artery (LAD alone) and during LAD occlusion with a circumflex stenosis (LAD + CIRC). This circumflex stenosis was adjusted to abolish coronary vasodilator reserve without reducing basal flow. We observed significantly greater reflex increases in renal (32 +/- 5%) and cardiac (58 +/- 15%) nerve activity during LAD + CIRC than during LAD alone (14 +/- 6% and 8 +/- 7%, respectively). Reflex changes in renal nerve activity during LAD + CIRC were abolished by interruption of cardiac sympathetic afferent pathways (n = 5). In eight experiments, myocardial blood flow was measured during the two coronary occlusions. These experiments confirmed that LAD + CIRC elicited more transmural ischemia in the LAD distribution than did LAD alone. However, these experiments also revealed that LAD + CIRC elicited endocardial ischemia in the circumflex distribution. In five additional experiments, regional sympathetic deafferentation of the posterior left ventricle by epicardial application of 88% phenol along the atrioventricular groove had no significant effect on renal nerve responses to LAD + CIRC (36 +/- 5% increase before phenol versus 31 +/- 3% increase after phenol). These results indicate that endocardial ischemia in the circumflex distribution did not contribute to the reflex increases in nerve activity that were noted during LAD + CIRC. CONCLUSIONS. Reflex sympathoexcitation mediated by cardiac sympathetic afferents can be elicited in dogs. However, these responses are significant only during ischemia that is transmural and involves the superficial epicardial layers of the left ventricle.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. We studied arrhythmogenesis and its underlying pathophysiology during graded reductions of coronary blood flow, superimposed on prior myocardial infarction to test the hypothesis that spontaneous ventricular fibrillation and induced ventricular tachycardia are dependent on different patterns of coronary flow reduction in hearts with prior myocardial infarction. METHODS AND RESULTS. In 10 sham-operated dogs (control group) and 24 dogs with 3-week-old experimental apical myocardial infarction, the left circumflex coronary artery was constricted to produce four grades of flow reduction: 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%. Among the sham-operated control animals, only one of 10 (10%) developed spontaneous ventricular fibrillation and only two of nine (22%) were inducible into sustained ventricular tachycardia during 100% circumflex coronary artery flow reduction. No spontaneous ventricular fibrillation or inducible ventricular tachycardia occurred with lesser grades (25%, 50%, or 75%) of flow reduction among the control animals. In the myocardial infarction group, five of 24 dogs (21%) were inducible before flow reduction. However, 50% flow reduction in the myocardial infarction group resulted in inducibility of ventricular tachycardia in 12 of 24 dogs (50%); nine of 16 (56%) during 75% flow reduction; and six of 11 (55%) with 100% flow reduction. In addition, none of the dogs in the myocardial infarction group developed spontaneous ventricular fibrillation during 25% or 50% flow reduction, whereas six of 22 (27%) developed ventricular fibrillation during 75% flow reduction and 10 of 21 (48%) during 100% flow reduction. In dogs with spontaneous ventricular fibrillation during flow reduction, the total myocardial mass of the ischemic \"risk\" zone and infarcted zone was significantly greater than in those without spontaneous ventricular fibrillation (68 +/- 5% versus 56 +/- 6% [p less than 0.01]). There was no difference in the total myocardial mass of the ischemic risk zone and infarcted zone between dogs with and without inducible ventricular tachycardia during flow reduction. CONCLUSIONS. In canine model of subacute myocardial infarction, superimposed ischemia increased the likelihood of inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia with lesser grades of coronary flow reduction compared with that necessary to allow spontaneous ventricular fibrillation. The underlying pathophysiology appears to differ between spontaneous ventricular fibrillation and electrically induced sustained ventricular tachycardia.\r"

The purpose of the study was to determine whether acute hypercholesterolemia reduced collateral flow to ischemic myocardium and increased infarct size in the awake dog. METHODS AND RESULTS. Acute myocardial infarction was produced in awake dogs by a 4-hour left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion followed by 6-hour reperfusion after either a cholesterol-supplemented diet (n = 14) or a control diet of dog chow (n = 15) for 10 days. Infarct size was determined using nitroblue tetrazolium staining. In two subgroups, a 15-minute transient occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery was produced before the diet treatments and was compared with occlusion after diet treatments, so that the effects of hypercholesterolemia of collateral flow could be determined by paired comparisons. Cholesterol feeding increased plasma cholesterol to 288 +/- 52 mg/dl, which was twofold to threefold that in the control group (127 +/- 35 mg/dl), but had no effects on baseline systemic hemodynamics and myocardial blood flow. Coronary artery occlusion produced similar increases in heart rate, mean aortic pressure, left atrial pressure, and plasma norepinephrine in both groups of animals. However, cholesterol feeding reduced collateral flow to ischemic myocardium and increased infarct size, compared with the control group. The infarct size correlated with ischemic myocardial blood flow in both groups, but the slopes of regression lines relating the two variables did not differ between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS. Short-term, diet-induced hypercholesterolemia increased infarct size in awake dogs. This change results, at least in part, from a decrease in collateral blood flow to ischemic myocardium during coronary artery occlusion.\r"

  ".U": "91284345\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Left ventricular aneurysm formation after myocardial infarction (MI) has been associated with elongation of infarcted tissue in response to wall stress. Such elongation most commonly occurs in acutely infarcted or partially healed regions during the early post-MI period; however, recent reports have indicated that mature (15-week-old) healed infarct regions also undergo elongation after stress. METHODS AND RESULTS. To assess factors contributing to post-MI left ventricular aneurysm formation, we subjected isolated strips (n = 50) of rabbit myocardial tissue from acutely ischemic (noninfarcted left ventricular), acutely infarcted (24 hours after MI), and healed infarct (3 and 15 weeks after MI) regions to a range of loading conditions and measured the reversible and irreversible length changes that occurred. The isolated strips were repetitively stretched for 1 hour at 4 Hz to impose cyclical physiological peak and resting stresses of 2.0 and 0.2 g/mm2. During a second hour, either peak stress (\"afterload\") or resting stress (\"preload\") was tripled, and the increase in strip length (strain) was measured. During a third hour, peak and resting stresses were returned to the initial values to assess the reversibility of length changes occurring during increased load. Elongation was expressed as the increase in natural strain from the first hour. Increasing afterload caused similar irreversible length increases of 4-5%/hr in acutely infarcted and 3- and 15-week-old healed infarct strips; acutely ischemic tissue length increased by 7.4%/hr (p less than 0.05 versus acutely infarcted tissue and scars). Increasing preload in acutely ischemic and acutely infarcted tissue caused a reversible length increase of less than 1%/hr. (Scar strips were not tested for the effect of preload.) CONCLUSIONS. Since an irreversible length increase may represent an early event in aneurysm formation, our results suggest that 1) afterload increases are more likely to lead to aneurysm development than preload increases, 2) acutely ischemic tissue is the most vulnerable to increased afterload, and 3) for a given wall stress level, healing scar tissue is as susceptible to irreversible length changes as is acutely infarcted tissue. The observation that even mature post-MI scar elongated in response to increases in afterload implies that long-term pharmacological management of afterload in post-MI patients may be beneficial in preventing tissue elongation and aneurysm formation and that factors that increase wall stress (e.g., hypertension and exercise stress) have the potential to promote aneurysm formation in healed infarct scars.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Atrial fibrillation is common in advanced heart failure, but its prognostic significance is controversial. METHODS AND RESULTS. We evaluated the relation of atrial rhythm to overall survival and sudden death in 390 consecutive advanced heart failure patients. Etiology of heart failure was coronary artery disease in 177 patients (45%) and nonischemic cardiomyopathy or valvular heart disease in 213 patients (55%). Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 0.19 +/- 0.07. Seventy-five patients (19%) had paroxysmal (26 patients) or chronic (49 patients) atrial fibrillation. Compared with patients with sinus rhythm, patients with atrial fibrillation did not differ in etiology of heart failure, mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure on therapy, or embolic events but were more likely to be receiving warfarin and antiarrhythmic drugs and had a slightly higher left ventricular ejection fraction. After a mean follow-up of 236 +/- 303 days, 98 patients died: 56 (57%) died suddenly, and 36 (37%) died of progressive heart failure. Actuarial 1-year overall survival was 68%, and sudden death-free survival was 79%. Actuarial survival was significantly worse for atrial fibrillation than for sinus rhythm patients (52% versus 71%, p = 0.0013). Similarly, sudden death-free survival was significantly worse for atrial fibrillation than for sinus rhythm patients (69% versus 82%, p = 0.0013). By Cox proportional hazards model, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure on therapy, left ventricular ejection fraction, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation were independent risk factors for total mortality and sudden death. For patients who had pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of less than 16 mm Hg on therapy, atrial fibrillation was associated with poorer 1-year survival (44% versus 83%, p = 0.00001); however, in the high pulmonary capillary wedge pressure group, atrial fibrillation did not confer an increased risk (58% versus 57%). CONCLUSIONS. Atrial fibrillation is a marker for increased risk of death, especially in heart failure patients who have lower filling pressures on vasodilator and diuretic therapy. Whether aggressive attempts to maintain sinus rhythm will reduce this risk is unknown.\r"

  ".U": "91284347\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. We have previously demonstrated that chemotactic factors released from the ischemic canine myocardium peak early during reperfusion and that they elicit neutrophil adherence reactions in vitro that are dependent on the CD18 glycoprotein family. In this study we investigated the hypothesis that neutrophil localization in ischemic canine myocardium in vivo occurs over a similar time course during early reperfusion and involves a CD18-dependent mechanism. METHODS AND RESULTS. We occluded the circumflex coronary artery for 1 hour in acute, open-chest dogs, followed by reperfusion for 1, 2, 3, or 4 hours. Regional myocardial blood flow was determined using radiolabeled microspheres, and localization was traced using technetium-99m-labeled autologous neutrophils. In the first hour of reperfusion, neutrophil localization occurred preferentially within the subendocardial region and was inversely related to flow. Neutrophil localization diminished across the ischemic myocardium from endocardium to epicardium but remained negatively related to flow in the midmyocardial region. Regardless of flow, little neutrophil localization occurred in the subepicardial region. Neutrophil localization was greatest in the first hour of reperfusion and diminished thereafter. By 4 hours of reperfusion, the rate of localization was markedly attenuated relative to 1 hour. Dogs given anti-CD18 monoclonal antibody R15.7 (1 mg/kg i.v.) before occlusion underwent 1 hour of occlusion followed by 1 hour of reperfusion. When compared with 1-hour reperfusion controls, the R15.7-treated dogs demonstrated significant attenuation of neutrophil localization in the subendocardial region. CONCLUSIONS. These data support the concepts that rapid neutrophil localization during reperfusion occurs within regions of previous myocardial ischemia and that neutrophils preferentially localize within the subendocardial region. The rate of neutrophil localization is greatest within the first hour after the initiation of reperfusion, and localization is, at least in part, CD18 dependent. Therapies directed against neutrophil-mediated reperfusion injury should be initiated with these considerations in mind.\r"

To evaluate the relevance of diastolic perfusion time on the mechanisms underlying stress-induced ischemia, 16 patients with coronary artery disease and seven patients with syndrome X underwent five randomized stress tests (upright and supine exercise with and without therapy, transesophageal atrial pacing). METHODS AND RESULTS. Exercise duration Time to 0.1 mV ST segment depression, heart rate, rate-pressure product, and diastolic perfusion time were evaluated for each patient during stress tests. In both groups, variability coefficients of the above-mentioned parameters were not different at rest. At ischemic threshold (0.1 mV ST segment depression) in patients with coronary artery disease, the variability coefficient of exercise duration (40.1 +/- 22.2) was significantly higher (p less than 0.0001) than those of heart rate (12.8 +/- 2.9), rate-pressure product (14.8 +/- 3.3), and diastolic perfusion time (0.39 +/- 0.1). The variability coefficient of diastolic perfusion time was also significantly (p less than 0.0001) lower than those of heart rate and rate-pressure product. Similarly, the variability coefficient of diastolic perfusion time (0.44 +/- 0.1) in syndrome X patients was significantly lower (p less than 0.0001) than those of exercise duration (28.2 +/- 9.4), heart rate (12 +/- 1.4), and rate-pressure product (14.6 +/- 1.3). CONCLUSIONS. Fixed diastolic perfusion time at ischemic threshold, despite different kinds of stress tests and variability of heart rate and rate-pressure product, indicates the relevant role of diastolic perfusion time in determining myocardial ischemia.\r"

Recent reports critical of the performance of heart rate-adjusted indexes of ST depression during exercise electrocardiography have used J-point rather than ST segment measurements. However, no standard exists for the optimal time after the J-point at which to measure ST segment deviation. METHODS AND RESULTS. To assess the effect of ST segment measurement position on performance of standard exercise electrocardiographic criteria, the delta ST segment/heart rate (delta ST/HR) index, and the ST segment/heart rate (ST/HR) slope for the detection of coronary artery disease, the exercise electrocardiograms of 50 clinically normal subjects and 80 patients with known or likely coronary disease were analyzed using ST depression measured at both the J-point and at 60 msec after the J-point (J + 60). A positive exercise electrocardiogram by standard criteria, defined as 0.1 mV or more of additional horizontal or downsloping ST depression at end exercise, had a specificity of 96% when ST depression was measured at either the J-point or J + 60. There was no difference in sensitivity of standard electrocardiographic criteria at J + 60 and J point (both 59%, p = NS). However, at matched specificity of 96%, the delta ST/HR index and ST/HR slope calculated using ST depression at J + 60 were significantly more sensitive (90% and 93%) than when calculated using J-point depression (64% and 61%, each p less than 0.001). Comparison of areas under respective receiver operating characteristic curves confirmed the superior performance of J + 60 as opposed to J-point measurements for both the delta ST/HR index (0.98 versus 0.89, p = 0.006) and the ST/HR slope (0.96 versus 0.87, p = 0.007) and also demonstrated modestly improved overall test performance for standard electrocardiographic criteria using J + 60 measurements (0.88 versus 0.82, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. Use of J-point measurements significantly degrades performance of heart rate-adjusted indexes of ST depression but has less effect on standard criteria.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Conventional cardiac imaging methods do not depict true segmental myocardial shortening, since they cannot determine segment length between fixed points in the myocardium. METHODS AND RESULTS. We used electrocardiographically gated magnetic resonance imaging with spatial modulation of magnetization to noninvasively \"tag\" the myocardium with dark stripes at uniform 7-mm intervals center to center at end diastole. We then determined end-systolic stripe separation and thereby calculated circumferential shortening. When end systole was not reached in the first image series, a second temporally overlapped series starting in late systole was used to determine late-systolic shortening. Septal, anterior, lateral, and inferior segments were assessed at endocardium, midwall, and epicardium on five midventricular short-axis sections each in 10 normal volunteers. A transmural gradient in circumferential shortening was observed, with the percentage of endocardial segment shortening consistently greater than epicardial segment shortening (epicardial, 22 +/- 5%; midwall, 30 +/- 6%; and endocardial, 44 +/- 6%; p less than 0.0001 by analysis of variance). Circumferential shortening varied from apex to base with slices closer to the base of the left ventricle showing less shortening at the midwall (28 +/- 9%) and endocardium (39 +/- 6%) than more apical slices at the midwall (34 +/- 13%) and endocardium (49 +/- 9%) (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01, respectively, by analysis of variance). CONCLUSIONS. Transmural and longitudinal heterogeneity of circumferential shortening is present in the normal human left ventricle. Magnetic resonance imaging with spatial modulation of magnetization is a powerful new tool for assessment of circumferential shortening and provides information unobtainable with conventional imaging methods.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Clonidine, a partial presynaptic and postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptor agonist, has been shown to lower blood pressure in normal subjects but not in tetraplegics; however, the mechanisms of this action have not been elucidated. METHODS AND RESULTS. The hemodynamic and hormonal basis of the hypotensive action of clonidine was investigated in tetraplegics with complete cervical spinal cord transection and preganglionic sympathetic denervation, in patients with unilateral brachial plexus injury and postganglionic sympathetic denervation, and in normal subjects. In normal subjects, the fall in blood pressure after clonidine infusion was accompanied by a reduction in cardiac output that was predominantly due to a fall in stroke volume and in heart rate. The lack of fall in blood pressure, cardiac output, and stroke volume in tetraplegics indicates that these effects are exerted at a supraspinal level and require intact descending sympathetic pathways. After clonidine infusion, digital skin vasodilatation occurred in normal subjects, in the innervated but not the denervated limb of patients with unilateral brachial plexus injury, and in tetraplegics, indicating that this response is due to the central sympatholytic effect of clonidine. Plasma norepinephrine was much lower in tetraplegics compared with normal subjects, and after clonidine infusion, it fell substantially in normal subjects alone. Plasma renin activity did not change. Bladder stimulation in tetraplegics resulted in a rise in blood pressure and vasoconstriction in digital skin vessels. The inability of clonidine to significantly reduce or abolish the pressor and digital vasoconstrictor responses after bladder stimulation in tetraplegics indicates that clonidine does not exert a major effect on spinal preganglionic neurons or peripheral presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors. CONCLUSIONS. Therefore, clonidine is a suitable drug for use in analyzing the central supraspinal levels of control in varying circulatory disorders, such as hypertension and postural hypotension.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Streptokinase (SK) is a bacteria-derived protein and one of the plasminogen activators that is currently available for therapeutic use. Exposure to SK induces synthesis of specific antibodies that may initiate platelet aggregation and paradoxical clot propagation during treatment. METHODS AND RESULTS. Using platelet-rich plasma (PRP), we found that SK (5,000 units/ml) but not urokinase (2,500 units/ml) or recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (2,500 units/ml) caused platelet aggregation in PRP from 14 of 100 normal volunteers. In 13 consecutive patients treated with SK for acute myocardial infarction, SK-mediated platelet aggregation was induced in five patients within 1 week after treatment. SK-mediated platelet aggregation was associated with significantly increased titers of both anti-SK antibodies and SK-neutralizing activity in plasma; it was partially inhibited by aspirin (1 mM) and by aprotinin (500 kallikrein inhibitor units/ml) and completely inhibited by tranexamic acid (1 mM) and by prostaglandin E1 (9 microM). Addition of SK (1,000 or 5,000 units/ml) induce a statistically significant dose-dependent thromboxane B2 release in mixtures of PRP with plasma from subjects with SK-induced aggregation but not in samples of PRP mixed with plasma from nonresponders; addition of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (1 or 50 micrograms/ml) did not induce thromboxane B2 release. Mixing experiments with PRP and immunoglobulin G from reactive and nonreactive donors revealed that SK-induced aggregation requires the presence of anti-SK antibodies. When 125I-SK (50 nM) was used, platelets preincubated with plasminogen (0.5 microM) bound 9,500 +/- 600 (mean +/- SEM, n = 6) molecules SK/platelet, which increased to 25,000 +/- 3,100 molecules/platelet after thrombin stimulation. Tranexamic acid (1 mM) blocked specific binding of SK to resting platelets. CONCLUSIONS. These data demonstrate that SK-induced platelet aggregation is initiated by the binding of anti-SK antibodies to the SK-plasminogen complex located on the platelet surface. SK-induced platelet activation may limit the therapeutic effectiveness of the drug, and in view of the high prevalence of aggregation in a normal population, prospective evaluation of the effects of platelet aggregation during treatment with SK is warranted.\r"

This passive stability is also evident in the glenohumeral joints of anatomic specimens. The translational laxity of anatomic specimen shoulders was measured, and it was demonstrated that this laxity was substantially increased when air was admitted into the capsule. Eight shoulders, aged 57-87 years, including six contralateral pairs, were analyzed using a six degrees-of-freedom force transducer and a six degrees-of-freedom spatial tracker. Capsules were vented by admitting air ad libitum through an 18-gauge needle. Venting reduced the force necessary to translate the humeral head with respect to the glenoid fossa by an average of 15.3 N (55%) for anterior forces, 10.8 N (43%) for posterior forces, and 19.0 N (57%) for inferior forces. It is likely that passive stability will also be diminished by a similar mechanism in patients with intact but excessively lax capsules. The principle of limited joint volume should be considered and tested when investigating glenohumeral stability.\r"

The follow-up period was 12 to 36 months postoperatively (mean, 16 months). There were 22 perioperative complications (27%) and 13 postoperative complications (16.7%).

This technique was preferred as a salvage operation when the surrounding soft tissue envelope was compromised by the initial injury, previous surgical procedures, or infection. Each of the cases was notable for a segmental bone loss, an infected nonunion, or a collapse of the talar body. In the presence of a major soft tissue defect, the internal fixation was accompanied by the application of a microvascular free flap. The postoperative assessment of the posterior arthrodesis with the blade plate fixation was at an average of 33 months. Using a modification of the Boston Children's Hospital ankle scoring system, a preoperative and postoperative assessment was made. The criteria included an objective rating system based on the intensity of pain, the cessation of drainage, the degree of independent ambulation, and the roentgenographic documentation of union. The average preoperative score was 13 (range, 8-16). After arthrodesis, the average score was 44 (range, 40-48), with three patients rated excellent and two rated good.\r"

An acetabular component that is not loose may need to be removed because of infection or malposition. Based on a previous study of torque failure of cemented and uncemented acetabular components in vitro, a pneumatic impact wrench has been developed that delivers repetitive shear loads to the implant-cement or implant-bone interfaces. Eight acetabular components (three polyethylene, two metal backed, and three porous coated) were implanted with polymethylmethacrylate into fresh, unembalmed human anatomic specimen acetabuli. Seven components were easily removed using this new device at an average setting of 16 kg/m of torque. One polyethylene component could not be removed because the studs cut through polyethylene grooves. In one pelvis, a fracture occurred through a pubic anchoring hole when the driver was taken by error through a 40 degrees arc rather than the recommended 15 degrees arc. This device has been used in vivo in four cases, easily removing the components without damage to the surrounding bone.\r"

  ".W": "Morphologic, physiologic, and clinical evidence for the sensory role of the cruciate ligaments is reviewed. The cruciate ligaments accommodate morphologically different sensory nerve endings (Ruffini endings, Pacinian corpuscles, Golgi tendon organlike endings, and free nerve endings) with different capabilities of providing the central nervous system with information not only about noxious and chemical events but also about characteristics of movements and position-related stretches of these ligaments. A survey of available data reveals that low threshold joint-ligament receptor (i.e., mechanoreceptor) afferents evoke only weak and rare effects in skeletomotor neurons (alpha-motor neurons), while they frequently and powerfully influence fusimotor neurons (gamma-motor neurons). The effects on the gamma-muscle-spindle system in the muscles around the knee are so potent that even stretches of the cruciate ligaments at relatively moderate loads (not noxious) may induce major changes in responses of the muscle spindle afferents. As the activity in the primary muscle spindle afferents modifies the stiffness in the muscles, the cruciate ligament receptors, via the gamma-muscle-spindle system, may participate in the regulation and preprogramming of the muscular stiffness around the knee joint and thereby of the knee joint stiffness. Thus, the sensory system of the cruciate ligaments is able to significantly contribute to the functional stability of the knee joint.\r"

The two retrieved uncemented porous-coated tibial components of different designs, and materials were evaluated by microradiography, backscattered electron (BSE) imaging, and light microscopy. The right prosthesis, in place for 25 months, was a Porous-Coated Anatomic (PCA) implant with double-layered, sintered, cobalt-chromium alloy beads. The left prosthesis was a Natural-Knee (N-K) implant with a porous coating of cancellous-structured pure titanium implanted for 19 months. A quantitative microradiographic index, the appositional bone index (ABI), was developed to indicate the probability of bone ingrowth occurring into the porous coating. The ABI is a ratio of bone in apposition with porous coating divided by the total amount of porous coating available. The PCA had an average ABI of 9%, and the N-K, 67%. BSE images of the PCA demonstrated no bone within the porous coating. BSE images of the N-K implant showed bone ingrowth into 22% of the pore volume when porous coating was in apposition to host bone. Histology of the PCA revealed fibrous connective tissue throughout the porous coating and between the porous coating-bone interface. Histology of the N-K implant revealed bone ingrowth and osteoblastic activity along the bone within the porous coating.\r"

The surgical indications for prosthetic hip replacement in all cases were displaced subcapital hip fractures (Garden Types 3 and 4). Postoperative evaluation included D'Aubigne's hip rating system and roentgenograms to assess prosthetic placement, dislocation, disassembly of the components, and the presence of inner and outer bearing motion of the prostheses. Results of the study revealed intact inner bearing motion in all of the devices investigated in the immediate postoperative period. The UHR prosthesis demonstrated a statistically significant lower incidence of dislocation and no incidence of prosthesis disassembly. This study demonstrates the superiority of the bipolar prosthesis when compared to published results of the so-called unipolar prosthesis and also suggests superiority of the design and function of the UHR prosthesis when compared to the Bateman I and Giliberty prostheses. Longer follow-up evaluation is needed to assess the effects of a functioning bipolar prosthesis on acetabular wear.\r"

Primary bone tumors were not included. Nineteen of 22 fractures were treated with intramedullary fixation: 12 of these fractures were also treated with methylmethacrylate. Two patients had compression plating, and the remaining patient had no surgery. Twenty-eight percent had a previously undiagnosed malignancy. Postoperatively, 78% of the patients had only mild or moderate pain. Five patients had progression of local disease postoperatively, two resulting in failure of fixation. Both plates failed. Three patients required additional humeral procedures, one of which was a shoulder disarticulation for pain. Intramedullary fixation of pathologic fractures improves the quality of life by controlling pain for most patients. Complications, treatment failures, and pain are related to a 29% rate of tumor progression and a 23% rate of fixation failure.\r"

These latter specimens were examples of frank pseudarthrosis. The soft tissues lining the large clefts were often considerably eroded. Pseudarthrosis of fracture healing may be a late manifestation of more mobile nonunions that progressively tear apart. Fifty-four additional nonunion or pseudarthrosis specimens from former intraarticular fractures demonstrated the same sequence of changes occurring in 24 of the cases. However, 30 of the intraarticular fractures demonstrated no tissues of a fibrous nonunion, which could indicate that in such locations pseudarthrosis may exist from the date of the original fracture.\r"

A method of ankle arthrodesis using 6.5-mm cancellous screws as the primary fixation hardware was developed. The most important screw is placed from the posterior malleolus into the neck and head of the talus, and medial and lateral malleolar screws are added to secure fixation. Near-normal anatomy is maintained with this technique because little or no bone, only cartilage, is removed. Earlier cases were all done through an anterior approach. Later, special techniques were developed for placing screws and strain-relieving bone grafting was added to promote union. Twenty-three cases that were treated by the earlier technique are reviewed. The overall fusion rate was 74%. Three conditions (avascular talus, pyarthrosis, and spasticity) were identified that placed patients at high risk for failure of fusion. Of the patients who were not in a high-risk group, only one had a delayed union. When the high-risk patients were not included in the statistics, the fusion rate was 93%. The evolved technique shows great promise for accurate and trouble-free ankle arthrodesis.\r"

At present, the determination of its amino acid sequence, which is necessary for its synthesis, and screening for a carrier that allows BMP to be effective in small amounts are unsolved problems. Bone morphogenetic protein is studied here to clarify its clinical applications. BMP was extracted from human and bovine bone matrix with 4 M guanidine-HCl and purified by liquid chromatography. Acrylamide electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and isoelectric focusing (IEF) showed that the purified BMP was homogeneous. We used type I collagen as the carrier in the bioassay. This BMP induced new bone in situ three weeks after implantation in muscle pouches in Wistar rats. The molecular weights of human and bovine bone matrix-derived BMP are 17.0 and 18.0 kDa by SDS-PAGE, and pI values for both are 4.9 by IEF. Human and bovine bone matrix-derived BMP are peptides containing 165 and 163 amino acids, respectively, according to amino acid analysis. The NH2-terminal sequence of bovine bone matrix-derived BMP was obtained from the bovine band, electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, that corresponded to the final purified fraction. The sequence differs from previously designated BMPs25 and other proteins reported to have similar activity, but the physicochemical characteristics are comparable to the native preparations.\r"

Growth occurring at each growth plate was measured in relation to the nutrient foramen. The proportion of growth from each upper extremity growth plate is not equal. Also, growth plate activity is not constant or average throughout the growth period. Growth occurs one or two years earlier in females than in males. Overall, approximately 80% of growth in the humerus occurs at the proximal growth plate. Before the age of two years, less than 75% of growth occurs at the proximal growth plate, increasing to 85% at the age of eight and remaining constant at 90% after the age of 11. For the ulna, approximately 85% of overall growth occurs at the distal growth plate, but by the age of five years, 90% of growth occurs distally. After the age of eight years, 95% of growth occurs at the distal growth plate. For the radius, approximately 80% of overall growth occurs distally.

By implanting C-HA into the femoral condyle of adult rabbits, the capacity for new bone formation and foreign-body reactivity were quantitatively compared with those of HA alone. The compressive strength of C-HA was 4.3 times greater than HA. At four weeks after implantation, the mean areal ratio of the newly formed bone in the C-HA block in each rabbit was 9.9%, which was somewhat less than the 13.7% in the HA block; the mean number of multinucleated giant cells (MGC) per visual field at x25 in the C-HA-implanted specimens in each rabbit was 14.4, significantly larger than the 6.1 in the HA specimens. However, 12 weeks after C-HA implantation, the areal ratio of new bone increased to 32.7%, the number of MGC decreased to 9.4, and the differences compared to the values in HA cases, 31.5% and 6.8, disappeared. These results showed that C-HA is mechanically stronger than HA and that there is no difference between HA and C-HA in capacity for new bone formation or foreign-body reaction.\r"

In the present study, the effects of age on osteoinduction by DBP were evaluated in the rat by varying the age of the donor and the recipient animal. Cartilage and bone formation in subcutaneous pouches was assessed using a histologic grading technique in which a composite score was derived from analysis of multiple histologic sections from each specimen. The results confirm the previously reported decrease in osteoinduction in middle-aged adult animals compared with younger ones. However, DBP prepared from middle-aged adult rats was more inductive than that prepared from either prepubertal or young postpubertal animals. The latter result contradicts the widely held belief that demineralized bone matrix from younger animals is more inductive than that from older ones. This finding may help to further elucidate the mechanism of ectopic bone formation and lead to more inductive bone graft substitutes for human use.\r"

Osteotomies of the distal femur were operatively fixed with cylindrical implants made of SR-PLLA and SR-PDLLA/PLLA (40 PDLLA:60 PLLA). The follow-up times were one, three, six, 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks. Roentgenographic, microradiographic, histologic, histomorphometric, and oxytetracycline-labeling studies were done. Histologically, there was no evidence of inflammation or foreign-body reaction in the bony tissues. Histomorphometric analysis showed that absorption in the SR-PDLLA/PLLA implant was faster than in the SR-PLLA implant. Absorption started peripherally in the implants and continued with subsequent replacement by new bone. At 48 weeks the implant was completely surrounded by a layer of new bone. The SR-PLLA and SR-PDLLA/PLLA implants were visible in all specimens during the 48-week follow-up period. Ninety-five percent of the osteotomies were consolidated. Implants made of SR polylactic acid in rats proved to be biocompatible and slowly absorbable, and they possessed sufficient mechanical properties for fixation of osteotomies.\r"
