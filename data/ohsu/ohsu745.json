  ".W": "This study examines whether oleate may influence the linoleate enhanced metastasis of line 4526 murine mammary tumors. In addition, the in vitro proliferative response of line 4526 to oleate and other selected fatty acids was assessed. Initially, the tumor cells were grown in a defined medium supplemented with palmitate, stearate, oleate, linoleate, linolenate or arachidonate. The unsaturated fatty acids stimulated and the saturated fatty acids inhibited proliferation compared to fatty acid-free medium. Next, we examined the effect of oleate on the linoleate enhanced metastasis of 4526 tumors by substituting oleate for saturated fat in isoenergetic diets containing high or low levels of linoleate. Oleate had no effect on metastasis in mice fed the high linoleate diets but it significantly increased metastasis in mice fed the low linoleate diets. Finally, the fatty acid compositions of tumors and mammary fat pads were compared to diet fatty acid compositions and metastatic frequency. Metastasis corresponded more closely to total unsaturated fatty acids than to total polyunsaturated fatty acids or to any individual fatty acid. These studies suggest that both mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids may stimulate mammary tumor metastasis. However, the influence of dietary oleate probably depends on the level of linoleate and total unsaturated fatty acids in the diet.\r"

Isosulfurous graded increments of OTC and Cys were added to Cys-free purified amino acid diets that were adequate in methionine. Curvilinear responses to both Cys and OTC for chicks and rats were obtained. Hepatic GSH accumulated in chicks only at dietary Cys levels above 0.10%. In rats, hepatic GSH increased linearly as dietary Cys content increased from deficient to adequate and from adequate to excessive. Utilization of OTC by chicks was as efficacious as isosulfurous levels of Cys for growth and hepatic GSH biosynthesis. In rats, OTC was slightly inferior to Cys for growth and hepatic GSH biosynthesis. Exponential regression slope-ratio growth efficacy values for OTC were 78.5% for chicks and 70.2% for rats; multiple linear regression slope-ratio GSH biosynthesis efficacy values were 80.3% for chicks and 83.7% for rats. It is concluded that orally administered OTC is active as a Cys precursor.\r"

Following a 12-wk depletion period, 16 groups of male rats (n = 5/group) were fed experimental diets with or without 20% milk solids and graded levels of folic acid for 4 wk. Total folates were measured in plasma, erythrocytes, liver and kidney. Bioavailability of dietary folate was determined using slope-ratio statistics. Plasma response was found to be the most sensitive indicator of folate bioavailability based on steepness of slope, goodness of fit (r = 0.96, P less than 0.01) and linearity of response over the entire range of folate intakes. Kidney folate concentration also showed a significant linear relationship to total folate intake (r = 0.69, P less than 0.01). Liver and erythrocyte folate concentrations were not correlated with folate intake (r = 0.33 and r = 0.22, respectively). Using plasma folate as the response criterion, dietary incorporation of human milk significantly enhanced folate bioavailability by 75% (P less than 0.01). With kidney as the response tissue, folate bioavailability from diets containing human and bovine milk was significantly enhanced over milk-free diets. These results show that incorporation of human or bovine milk into diets enhances folate bioavailability and that plasma and kidney folate concentrations are sensitive and specific indicators of folate bioavailability.\r"

These studies were designed to determine whether changes in the enzymes involved in synthesis and degradation of PLP in blood are altered during pregnancy. We measured net synthesis of PLP in erythrocytes and the activity of enzymes involved in the regulation of plasma and erythrocyte PLP concentration: erythrocyte pyridoxal kinase (PLK) and neutral phosphatase, and plasma and tissue alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Net synthesis of PLP and activities of erythrocyte PLK and neutral phosphatase in erythrocytes remained unchanged during pregnancy. We were unable to detect any dephosphorylation of PLP in erythrocytes of pregnant or nonpregnant mice. Mouse erythrocytes were devoid of ALP activity; neutral phosphatase was inactive with PLP and PLP was an uncompetitive inhibitor of the enzyme. Plasma ALP activity decreased 50% in the pregnant mice; therefore, it likely does not participate in the reduction of plasma PLP levels during pregnancy. Placenta had high levels of PLP-phosphatase activity (ALP) and, if it is active as an ectoenzyme in this tissue as it is in others, it may be the most important mediator of plasma PLP levels in pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "In contrast to most biologically active molecules, the isomeric form of ascorbate retains significant biological activity. Moreover, in studies in vitro the isomer was found to be an equally effective cofactor in the enzymatic proline hydroxylation reaction. This raises questions about whether the lower biological activity in vivo results from selective transport into the cell, greater instability of the molecule, or stereospecificity by certain enzyme complexes. Distinguishing these possibilities can be accomplished most directly using a cell culture model. In this study primary avian tendon (PAT) cells were used. With PAT cells isoascorbate was shown to be three- to fivefold less active at inducing procollagen production than ascorbate. Isoascorbate was also internalized by the cell at about one-fifth the ascorbate level. In addition, isoascorbate was degraded in the medium at a slightly higher rate (half-life of 1.6 h) than ascorbate (2.1 h). The data are consistent with a model that postulates that once inside the cell isoascorbate is equally effective at inducing procollagen production but selectivity at the transport step restricts the percentage that is actually internalized. In addition, both ascorbate and isoascorbate were found to degrade very quickly inside the cell in the highly oxygenated environment of cell culture (approximately 2 h half-life). When ascorbate was added to the medium (100 micrograms/mL) the level inside the cell quickly reached a maximum (less than 2 h) and declined rapidly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Two experiments based on multiple labeling with stable isotopes were performed. One focused on short-term (7 d, Expt. 1) and the other on long-term (60 d, Expt. 2) relationships. Rats were fed a Torula yeast diet and water supplemented with [76Se]selenite at 0.1 micrograms Se/mL; the in vivo [74Se]selenite tracer was administered orally. Groups of three or four animals were killed at timed intervals and whole carcass or selected organs were analyzed for the stable isotopes 74Se, 77Se and 82Se with hydride generation/inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The value of WSe-EMP was determined from plasma or urine isotope ratios. In Experiment 1, with plasma as the sampling compartment, WSe-EMP at 24 h was 36.5 +/- 1.2% of the baseline value of whole body endogenous selenium (Seend) and 36.3 +/- 1.8% at 7 d. When urine was the sampling compartment, the corresponding values were 3.9 +/- 0.3% and 43.1 +/- 2.8%, respectively. In Experiment 2, WSe-EMP (plasma) was 38.9 +/- 1.3% of Seend at 7 d, increasing to 45.5 +/- 1.6% at 60 d. The corresponding values for urine as the sampling compartment were 45.5 +/- 2.0% (7 d) and 61.5 +/- 1.7% (60 d), respectively.\r"

Hair and nails have been suggested as indices of Se status because they are easily obtained, transported and stored. However, there has been little research on the potential influence of such factors as dietary Se intake or nutritional status on the levels of Se in hair and nails. Here we report the effects of chemical form of dietary Se and of methionine (Met) status on the Se content of rat hair and nails. Rats were fed diets containing 0.5, 1.5 or 2.5 micrograms/g of Se as sodium selenate (Na2SeO4) or L-selenomethionine (SeMet) for 8 wk. Hair and nail Se retention was two- to threefold greater when dietary SeMet was fed. Hair and nail Se levels increased as liver and muscle Se retention increased in rats fed SeMet, whereas in rats fed Na2SeO4, hair, nails and liver accumulated Se but muscle Se levels remained relatively unchanged. In a second experiment, rats were fed diets containing 0.1, 0.5 or 2.5 micrograms/g of Se as Na2SeO4 or SeMet, +/- added Met (0.3%) for 6 (+Met) or 7 (-Met) wk. Hair and nail Se retention was greater when Met was deficient than when this amino acid was not limiting. These results suggest that factors other than dietary Se intake affect hair and nail Se content and that these tissues should be used with caution for Se status assessment purposes.\r"

We monitored Se toxicity in rats fed Torula yeast-based diets containing 0.1, 0.5 or 2.5 micrograms Se/g of diet as either sodium selenate (Na2SeO4) or L-selenomethionine (SeMet). Half the diets were supplemented to contain adequate dietary methionine (Met). Weights were monitored weekly for 6 (Met-adequate) or 7 (Met-deficient) wk, at which time the rats were killed. There were no significant differences in final weight among Met-adequate rats, regardless of level or form of dietary Se. Methionine-deficient rats all gained significantly less weight than their Met-adequate counterparts. Selenosis was most severe in the Met-deficient rats fed 2.5 micrograms Se/g of diet as Na2SeO4, as indicated by significantly impaired weight gains. Nonetheless, Se retention in serum, heart, brain, bone, testes, colon, skin, lungs and pancreas was greater in rats fed SeMet than in those fed Na2SeO4, and Met deficiency further intensified this trend. The kidney was the only organ in which Se levels were markedly higher in the severely poisoned Met-deficient rats fed Na2SeO4. Further research is needed to determine whether elevated kidney Se levels are related to the greater toxicity observed in the Met-deficient rats fed Na2SeO4.\r"

Glutathione concentration was lower in the pigs fed ethanol than in controls. Ethanol consumption did not result in increased lipid peroxidation as assessed by thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances. The ethanol-induced effects on the activities of the superoxide dismutases may be a reflection of available metals and/or a response to increased hepatic concentration of oxygen radicals. Because the protection afforded by the glutathione system was altered, pigs fed ethanol may be at risk of peroxidative damage with continued ethanol exposure.\r"

Livers from rats fed a high carbohydrate diet were found to contain 350- and 100-fold more S14 and FAS mRNA than livers from rats fasted for 48 h. Although feeding a high fat diet increased S14 and FAS mRNA above fasting (P less than 0.05), the level of S14 and FAS mRNAs was only 5% and 4%, respectively, of the amount in the high carbohydrate group. Both S14 and FAS mRNAs accumulated quickly upon intubation of fasted rats with a solution of sucrose. The earliest rise in these mRNAs occurred within 60 min; by 240 min after gavage, each mRNA had increased 30-fold. The rapid induction of FAS and S14 mRNAs was also observed during ingestion of a high glucose meal. Hepatic FAS and S14 mRNA decreased 80-90% and 60%, respectively, during the 21-h interval between meals. This degree of mRNA loss was estimated to require a half-life for FAS and S14 mRNA of less than 8 h and less than 12 h, respectively. Regression analysis of the three dietary studies revealed a correlation coefficient for the relationship between S14 and FAS mRNA abundance ranging between 0.88 and 0.96.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A series of experiments involving adult and weanling rats was designed to examine the ability of saturated (tripalmitin), (n-9) monounsaturated (triolein), (n-6) di-unsaturated (safflower oil), and (n-3) polyenic (fish oil) fatty acids to suppress the gene expression of FAS and S14. Dietary polyunsaturated fats reduced by 75-90% the hepatic abundance of FAS and S14 mRNA. Fish oil, rich in 20- and 22-carbon polyenic fatty acids, was more effective than safflower oil, whereas tripalmitin and triolein were without effect. Polyunsaturated fats were also very effective at preventing the rise in FAS and S14 mRNA associated with weaning. The inhibitory action of polyunsaturated fat was rapidly (less than 3 h) removed by deleting the fat from the meal. Regression analysis revealed a high correlation (0.81-0.94) between FAS and S14 expression among the various dietary studies. These data support the hypothesis that dietary polyunsaturated fats uniquely regulate the gene expression of lipogenic enzymes and that the mediator is likely a specific entity derived from the long-chain polyenic fatty acids. Moreover, the high correlation between FAS and S14 expression supports the hypothesis that S14 is a member of the lipogenic protein family and has potential as a model gene for the study of FAS expression.\r"

SETTING: Seven-bed MICU in a teaching and referral VA hospital. PATIENTS: 295 consecutive patients admitted to the MICU during a ten-month study period. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS: Forty-two patients (14%, 95% confidence interval 13%, 16%) experienced one or more complications during their MICU stays. Compared with other MICU patients, those experiencing complications tended to be older (mean age +/- SD: 63.6 +/- 10.1 years vs 59.3 +/- 14.0 years, p less than 0.02) and more acutely ill (mean Acute Physiology Score +/- SD: 18.3 +/- 8.0 vs 12.5 +/- 8.0, p = 0.0001). These patients also had significantly longer MICU lengths of stay (mean +/- SD: 12.3 +/- 14.7 days vs 3.1 +/- 4 days, p less than 0.0001) and higher hospital mortality rates (67% vs 27%, p less than 0.001). The 67% mortality rate among patients with complications significantly exceeded the expected mortality rate of 46% (calculated from the APACHE risk equation). CONCLUSION: Complications of care in the MICU are not rare and may independently contribute to in-hospital mortality. The potential for complications must be recognized when considering ICU care.\r"

Thirty-three percent of the women interviewed had not had a Pap test in the preceding three years. Variables independently associated with not having a recent Pap test included: having no identifiable source of medical care; having more than one source of gynecologic care; having an internist provide gynecologic care; and perceiving psychological barriers to Pap tests and pelvic examinations.

Among patients to whom \"possibly unflattering\" characteristics were attributed, race was more likely to be specified for blacks (10 of 10) than for whites (4 of 9). These case presentations appeared to show a subtle bias.\r"

SETTING: Two New York City urban teaching hospitals. SUBJECTS: 112 internal medicine and 37 pathology house officers who were on site during the survey period. MAIN RESULTS: Most internal medicine house officers (86%) felt that the autopsy rate was too low and needed to be increased. The most common reason the residents cited for the low rate was the reluctance of families to grant permission. A majority of medicine housestaff (78%) felt they needed more instruction on how to ask for an autopsy, and 34% had never received feedback from the pathology department on autopsy results. Most pathology residents (94%) felt the autopsy rate was too low; the most common reasons they cited for the low rate were reluctance of clinicians to request permission and clinicians' fears of being sued for malpractice. CONCLUSIONS: House officers in internal medicine and pathology agreed that autopsies should be performed more frequently, and identified problems in obtaining autopsies that should be addressed by educational, organizational, and regulatory strategies.\r"

  ".W": "In recent years, the need for increasing the geriatrics component of residency training has been repeatedly addressed; however, there are still many programs that have been unable to meet this need. While alternative sites, such as geriatric evaluation units and nursing homes, may be the ideal sites to teach some aspects of geriatrics, this article argues that the ambulatory care program, required in all residency programs, is the appropriate setting for teaching many of the core skills needed to care for most older adults. Teaching geriatrics in the ambulatory setting, which eliminates the strategic and financial obstacles of developing non-hospital-based sites, can be accomplished with relatively modest additional resources. This article describes the methods used to integrate geriatrics into the ambulatory care component of one internal medicine residency program and the necessary faculty resources as well as the documentation, via chart audit, of the interns' compliance with recommended practice patterns in five categories. With the exception of vaccination status, interns documented 18% or less of possible pieces of information for their patients. While this assessment showed statistically significant improvement in interns' care of older patients after the program intervention, the overall level of performance was still low, underscoring the need for the integration of geriatrics principles in the ambulatory curriculum.\r"

Twenty-two patients (62%) experienced complete remission after one cycle of therapy. Fifteen patients (38%) demonstrated an incomplete response; surgical resection was possible in 14 of these 15 patients. A second cycle of chemoradiotherapy was administered to all 37 patients. After this treatment resection is possible for some patients who are initially inoperable, and surgery is necessary only for those patients (38%) who show an incomplete remission after the first cycle of therapy and for those who present initially with bony invasion. Furthermore, the treatment of cervical nodes and intraoral disease may be divorced and the extent of surgery may be reduced for many patients. A 5-year survival of 76% is predicted for this group of patients. The described protocol shows promise for treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "The water-extractable component of snuff (snuff extract) inhibits the replication of herpes simplex virus (HSV) by suppressing the synthesis of viral DNA. This process probably causes HSV to be oncogenic. To further understand the mechanism of inhibitory action of snuff extract on HSV replication, the effect of snuff extract on the synthesis of viral DNA and proteins in type 1 HSV (HSV-1) infected cells was investigated. Snuff extract inhibited the synthesis of viral DNA and altered the production of certain classes of viral proteins. The syntheses of ICP4, a viral alpha-protein, and ICP8, a beta-protein, were not generally reduced by noncytotoxic concentrations of snuff extract (where ICP = infected cell polypeptide). However, snuff extracts significantly inhibited the production of ICP gC (glycoprotein C), a gamma 2-protein, and the inhibition was in a concentration-dependent fashion: the higher the concentration of snuff extracts, the greater the inhibition. Based on the fact that the production of alpha- and beta-proteins is absolutely necessary for and precedes the viral DNA synthesis and that viral gamma 2-proteins are mostly produced by the newly synthesized viral DNA, it is concluded that snuff extract inhibits HSV-1 DNA replication directly rather than indirectly via the alteration of viral protein synthesis.\r"

Both cell lines were tumorigenic in nude mice. Histologic examination of the mice tumors showed a positive identification with those from the original human squamous cell carcinoma. Electron microscopic examination convincingly demonstrated their epithelial origin. Chromosomal numbers of the OC1 cell ranged from 58 to 78 and of the OC2 cells ranged from 62 to 82. Analysis of cytokeratin showed that all cell lines were positive. The carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) tested negative in these two cell lines. The OC2 cell line showed the presence of HPV16, but the OC1 cell line did not. These cell lines should be useful for investigation of anticancer treatment and for their possible relationship to human papilloma virus (HPV).\r"

  ".W": "Since the middle of 1987, fewer consistently defined AIDS cases have been reported than expected among homosexual and bisexual men in the United States. This \"AIDS deficit\" was greater among homosexual and bisexual men in New York City, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, but was also striking among all homosexual and bisexual men in the United States. Deficits were virtually absent among intravenous drug users (IVDUs) in the United States. Three independent sources of data--placebo-controlled trials, pharmaceutical company reports, and the San Francisco Men's Health Study--were used to demonstrate that the amounts of zidovudine (AZT) given prophylactically to those at highest risk of AIDS since March 1987 have been sufficient to account for most of the observed AIDS deficits. Other advances in the medical care of pre-AIDS patients may have combined with AZT to produce the deficits. Other hypothesized explanations were examined and found insufficient to account for the observed AIDS deficits, including: (a) a sudden halt in new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections during the early or mid-1980s; (b) misspecification of the distribution of AIDS incubation times following HIV infection; (c) increasing delays in the reporting of AIDS cases; (d) changes in the surveillance definition of AIDS in 1987; and (e) evolution of attenuated HIV strains. The hypothesis that therapy is affecting national AIDS rates has important implications. Failure to take the effects of therapy into account can lead to serious underestimates by back-calculation of the cumulative numbers infected with HIV and of AIDS incidence over the longer term. Moreover, it appears that AIDS incidence could be retarded in underserved groups, such as IVDUs, by making AZT and other state-of-the-art treatments readily available to AIDS-free patients with advanced immunodeficiency.\r"

In pretest counseling, males were asked if they had injected nonprescription drugs or engaged in sex with other men since January 1, 1977; if so, they were asked not to participate and were referred elsewhere for testing. Face-to-face interviews and HIV testing were completed for 1,119 subjects with no prior indication of HIV seropositivity. Willingness to participate in the study was significantly greater among women than men and among younger than older persons. After exclusion of two subjects with indeterminate HIV serology, seroprevalence was 6.3% (70/1,117) overall, 7.1% (26/368) among men, and 5.9% (44/749) among women. HIV seropositivity among female i.v. drug users was 37% (27/74). Among heterosexuals without other HIV risk factors, estimated seroprevalences were 2.7% (25/924) overall, 3.3% (10/305) among males, and 2.4% (15/619) among females. Among heterosexual men, the data suggested associations of HIV seropositivity with sex with prostitutes and sex with numerous partners. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that significant predictors of HIV infection among women were a history of sexual contact with a male intravenous drug user, recent last use of intravenous drugs, and long duration of residence in New York City. Sexual intercourse with persons from AIDS risk groups was reported by 11% of men and 18% of women. The modal method of birth control reported by both men and women was \"no method\".\r"

Testing for HIV-1 was performed using an ELISA and those positive were confirmed with envelope- and core-specific ELISAs. Statistical methods for data analysis included Mantel-Haenszel methods on contingency tables. The overall seropositivity rate was 21.1%. Subjects who reported a receptive role (either as predominantly receptive or as mixed receptive-insertive intercourse) had a seropositivity rate of 23.7%, which was significantly higher than the 10.3% found in those reporting predominantly insertive intercourse (RR = 2.30, 95% C.I. = 1.16-4.57). For subjects reporting receptive intercourse, sexual contact with foreign visitors was a significant risk factor for HIV-1 infection (RR = 1.84, 95% C.I. = 1.13-3.00). Factors of borderline significance included having had more than ten homosexual partners in the preceding year (RR = 1.53) and a history of international travel (RR = 1.43). These associations did not hold for those reporting predominantly insertive intercourse. The data indicate the need to monitor the spread of HIV-1 at the international level and provide information on subgroups of high transmission rates.\r"

To evaluate the risk of catheter infection in this group of patients, we reviewed the records of 299 patients with Hickman and Port-a-cath catheters. Patients were stratified into three groups: (a) AIDS (n = 54), (b) non-AIDS immunodeficiencies (n = 102), and (c) immunocompetent (n = 98). The rate of infection per 1,000 catheter days was 2.02, 0.41 (p less than 0.002), and 0.23 (p less than 0.002), respectively. Gram-positive cocci were the predominant isolate. Previous catheter infection and advanced AIDS (as determined by positive p24 antigen and low CD4+ number) were associated with increased risk of infection. Exit, tunnel, and fungal infections required catheter removal. The risk of infection and management were similar in Hickman and Port-a-cath catheters. The mortality was extremely low in all groups. However, the risk of infection associated with indwelling catheters was significantly higher in AIDS patients compared to patients with other immunodeficiencies.\r"

We found that while fresh sera of humans and chimpanzees (among others) did not have antiviral activity, fresh sera of several other mammals, especially those of rodents and felines, showed a dose-dependent viral-inactivating property against cell-free HIV-1; these sera were also capable of inactivating virus preadsorbed to cells, similar to neutralizing antibody. The activity was destroyed by heating to 56 degrees C, required Ca2+ but no antiviral antibody, and therefore apparently involves the classical complement pathway. The activity could not be ascribed to any single fraction of sera separated on a size exclusion HPLC column. Mouse serum (the only one tested) also inactivated HIV-2. The data are consistent with classical C-mediated pathway inactivation of HIV-1 and HIV-2 by animal sera and is the first report of any \"complement-like\" antilentiviral serum factor. Elucidation of this mechanism may aid in understanding the lack of activity of human serum against HIV-1 and may prove useful in combined interventive strategies against HIV-1.\r"

We found that within several days after castration (2-4 days) alcohol, at low to moderate doses, was only modestly effective in suppressing serum LH levels, whereas in sham-operated controls it was maximally effective at all doses tested. Surprisingly, at very high doses (4-6 g/kg), alcohol not only did not depress serum LH levels in long-term castrated rats, but elevated them by 2- to 4-fold when compared to saline-injected controls. The loss of sensitivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis to alcohol observed in castrated rats appeared to be selective, inasmuch as the mortality rate at high doses of alcohol was significantly (P less than .01) greater in castrated rats, when compared to sham-operated controls, and other measures of central nervous system impairment were equivalent in both groups. At the present time, it is difficult to explain this biphasic effect of alcohol on serum LH in the castrated animal, but our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the effects of alcohol on gonadotropin release may be dependent to a significant degree on the steroid milieu at the time of the experiments.\r"

Pretreatment of the iris with 20 micrograms of recombinant enkephalinase (neutral endopeptidase; EC 3.4.24.11) totally abolished the contractile response to substance P. Injection of 10 micrograms of capsaicin into the anterior chamber of atropine-treated rabbit eyes in vivo induced an immediate and intense miosis. Injection of 100 micrograms of recombinant enkephalinase, 1 or 5 min before capsaicin injection, significantly inhibited this miosis. This effect of enkephalinase was totally abolished by preincubating the enzyme with thiorphan, a high-affinity enkephalinase inhibitor. These results show that enkephalinase, which is known to hydrolyze substance P in vitro with high efficiency, also hydrolyzes endogenously released substance P in vivo. Furthermore, our results suggest that enkephalinase application may represent a novel therapeutic approach to treat substance P-mediated pathologies.\r"

The present study examined the reported ability of acute ethanol treatment to directly activate GABAA receptors or to increase GABAA agonist-mediated activation of the GABAA receptor in the myenteric plexus. Direct addition of ethanol to preparations of the guinea pig ileum longitudinal muscle had two effects. Immediately after ethanol (10-300 mM) was added to the tissue bath a concentration-related contractile response was observed which became maximal within 10 sec and then decayed over the next 60 sec. Contractile responses to higher concentrations of ethanol (greater than 100 mM) also were followed by a sustained reduction of longitudinal muscle tone. Contractions evoked by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and GABAA agonists, 3-aminopropane sulfonic acid (APSA) (3-100 microM) or muscimol (0.3-30 microM) developed maximally and decayed within 20 sec. Acetylcholine (0.01-10 microM) induced contractions were sustained over several minutes. Preincubation of tissue strips in ethanol (30 mM) for 1 min did not alter concentration relationships for GABA, muscimol or APSA contractile responses. Furthermore, addition of ethanol (10-100 mM) simultaneously with APSA, or 0.5, 2 or 5 min before the addition of APSA, also failed to consistently enhance contractile responses. Ethanol (30 mM) also did not alter desensitization-induced reductions in contractile responses to muscimol (3 microM) caused by preincubation of tissues with muscimol (1 microM). Finally, contractile responses to ethanol and APSA were completely blocked by atropine (0.1 microM) and tetrodotoxin (0.1 microM).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effects of cocaine on cardiovascular function were studied in six conscious squirrel monkeys. Cocaine (0.01-3 mg/kg i.v.) increased mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate (HR) in a dose-dependent manner. The effect of cocaine on HR reached a maximum at 0.3 mg/kg. Doses of cocaine up to 3 mg/kg did not evoke cardiac rhythm disturbances. Pentobarbital or halothane anesthesia attenuated the pressor and tachycardiac effects of 3 mg/kg of cocaine. Antagonism of the pressor response to cocaine by halothane was significantly greater than that by pentobarbital. Halothane, but not pentobarbital, also significantly reduced the pressor response to norepinephrine (1 micrograms/kg i.v.). Blockade of autonomic ganglia by hexamethonium failed to antagonize the pressor and tachycardiac effects of 3 mg/kg of cocaine. The pressor response to 3 mg/kg of cocaine was antagonized by alpha adrenoceptor blockade with phentolamine, whereas the tachycardiac response to cocaine was antagonized by beta adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol. These results suggest that the blood pressure and HR increasing effects of cocaine in conscious squirrel monkeys are not due to stimulation of the central nervous system-sympathoadrenal neural axis, but are due to its peripheral actions on catecholaminergic systems. The 1- and 3-mg/kg doses of cocaine caused an initial reduction in HR of 5 to 30 beats/min in three monkeys and 90 to 110 beats/min in one animal before the onset of their tachycardiac effect. None of the above pharmacological interventions were effective in preventing this initial, moderate reduction in HR in three monkeys.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A mutual-effect amplification of the PE-induced contractile response was observed with concentration-response curves (CRC) elicited by mixtures of PE and 5-HT, using a novel drug concentration paradigm. The theoretical CRC constructed using the Poch and Holzman method of equiactive agonist substitution demonstrated that the observed mutual-effect amplification was more than the result of simple additivity. Thus, the Leff model of mutual-effect amplification was utilized to predict the location of observed CRCs to mixtures of PE and 5-HT. Efficacy (tau) and slope factor estimates were determined using the Black and Leff operational model of pharmacological agonism and these values were used to predict the location of CRCs elicited by mixtures of PE and 5-HT. We demonstrated that the Leff model was insufficient to explain the observed degree of mutual-effect amplification.\r"

DMAnTX was only weakly effective in eliciting contracture of the frog rectus abdominis and was orders of magnitude less potent than AnTX. Biochemical assay showed that DMAnTX was a weak inhibitor of [125I]alpha-bungarotoxin binding to the receptors in frog muscle and Torpedo electroplaque membranes: the IC50 values were 60 and 14 microM, respectively. A low frequency of single channel currents recorded from isolated interosseal fibers at concentrations from 20 to 100 microM of DMAnTX and the stimulation of [3H]perhydrohistrionicotoxin [( 3H]H12-HTX) binding (half-maximal at 0.3 microM) confirmed the weak activation of the receptor. DMAnTX also exhibited antagonist effects. In muscle twitch assays, 100 microM of DMAnTX effectively decreased the tension induced by nerve stimulation, although DMAnTX did not affect muscle membrane action potentials. The binding of [3H] perhydrohistrionicotoxin was also inhibited at high micromolar concentrations of DMAnTX. Combination of DMAnTX with acetylcholine in single channel current experiments demonstrated that DMAnTX possesses ion channel blocking properties, which become apparent at low micromolar concentrations, and DMAnTX enhances the desensitization induced by acetylcholine above 10 microM AnTX. The difference in agonist potency between AnTX and DMAnTX may be attributed to a change in conformation of the molecular skeleton induced by the N-methyl groups.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of (+)- and (-)-anatoxin-a (AnTX) and N-methylanatoxin (M-AnTX) on peripheral nicotinic ion channel activity were studied using high micromolar concentrations. Whereas (+)-AnTX is an effective agonist at nanomolar concentrations, (-)-AnTX and M-AnTX were effective at low micromolar concentrations. The binding of [3H]perhydrohistrionicotoxin to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-ion channel was stimulated by the above agonist concentrations, but [3H]perhydrohistrionicotoxin binding was inhibited at high micromolar concentrations of each of the toxins. In single channel recordings, these toxins exhibited ion channel blocking properties; the concentration- and voltage-dependent kinetics of each were essentially the same. In the case of (+)-AnTX, desensitization was also present at micromolar concentrations. These data show that ion channel blockade may be a property of many anatoxin-a analogs, and that in the particular case of analogs with low agonist potency, ion channel blockade may be a concomitant primary effect of the toxins. Stereospecificity and number of amine moieties did not influence the ion channel blocking characteristics in this series of molecules, although these factors strongly modified agonist potency.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the role of protein kinase C (PKC) in the control of vessel tone in vivo in genetic hypertension, the vascular effects of phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), a PKC activator, was measured in the autoperfused hindlimb of reserpinized spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). PDBu infusion (1-3000 ng/kg/min) into the hindlimb elevated perfusion pressure in a dose-related manner. Vasoconstriction response characteristics (latency, T1/2 to peak effect, decay of effect) of PDBu were significantly longer (2- to 10-fold) than that produced by membrane receptor agonists; phenylephrine, SKF 89748, a lipophilic alpha-1 agonist, angiotensin II and 5-hydroxytryptamine. The tonic vasoconstriction induced by PDBu was not antagonized by prazosin, rauwolscine, cyproheptadine, [Sar1lle8]-angiotensin II but was inhibited reversibly by microbial PKC-inhibitors, K252a and staurosporine at concentrations (1.56-2.8 micrograms/kg/min) which did not block vasoconstriction by phenylephrine or 5-hydroxytryptamine. The EC50 for PDBu was identical in SHR and WKY. However, the maximal response to PDBu was significantly greater in SHR compared to WKY. Staurosporine lowered mean arterial pressure equally in SHR (20%) and WKY (17%) but reduced perfusion pressure in SHR (13%) to a slightly greater extent than in WKY (5%). Unlike the in vivo response, aortic rings removed from SHR were more sensitive to cumulative doses of PDBu than rings from WKY. It is concluded that PDBu-vasoconstriction in vivo is mediated largely through activation of PKC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

By using a rat tail-flick analgesic assay that utilizes extreme cold as its noxious stimulus (an ethylene glycol-water mixture maintained at -10 degrees C), we have recently reported a dose-related and naloxone-reversible antinociceptive effect for i.c.v. administered dynorphin A(1-17). To elucidate the biochemical mechanism of this antinociception, we designed a push-pull perfusion system which would allow us to measure changes in neuropeptide release in the spinal cord during exposure to noxious heat or cold. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted surgically with two lengths of PE-10 tubing inserted into the spinal subarachnoid space via the cisterna magna, with the push cannula at the level of T-1, and the pull cannula at the rostral edge of the lumbar enlargement. At the time of testing, samples of cerebrospinal fluid were collected both in the presence and absence of a noxious stimulus. Substance P (SP) and somatostatin (SST) levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. Exposing the animal's tail to the noxious cold (30 sec/min for 20 min) resulted in a significant elevation in SP release (69% above base-line levels), but no change in the level of SST release. Conversely, exposure to noxious heat (50 degrees C, 20 sec/min for 20 min) produced a significant increase in SST release (56% above base line), but no change in the level of SP release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Recently, it has been reported that oxytocin (OT) produces diuresis by its interaction with OT receptors in the kidney. LLC-PK1 cells have been used as a model system for renal epithelial cells. To determine if OT stimulates receptor-mediated phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis in LLC-PK1 cells as it does in nonrenal cell systems, we measured the release of PI hydrolysis products in LLC-PK1 cells by OT and a selective OT agonist (AK-2-60) in the absence and presence of a selective OT antagonist (KB-5-21). In addition, we determined the effect of an increase in osmolality of the incubation medium on OT-stimulated PI hydrolysis in LLC-PK1 cells. The methods involved the incubation of LLC-PK1 cells with [3H]inositol for its incorporation into membrane PI and the measurement of the release of [3H]inositol phosphates in the presence of LiCl which prevents dephosphorylation. The osmolality of the incubation media was increased from 300 mOsmol/kg of H2O to 600, 900 and 1200 mOsmol/kg of H2O by addition of NaCl and urea. In an iso-osmotic incubation medium OT (10(-11) M) produced a greater than 100% increase in PI hydrolysis in LLC-PK1 cells. The OT agonist, AK-2-60, produced a significant increase in PI hydrolysis in LLC-PK1 cells at 10(-8) M concentration. The effects of both OT and its agonist were concentration-dependent and were blocked by the OT antagonist, KB-5-21. An increase in osmolality of the incubation media decreased OT-stimulated PI hydrolysis in LLC-PK1 and abolished completely the effect of OT at 1200 mOsmol/kg of H2O.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Genetic polymorphisms control levels of TPMT enzymatic activity in both humans and inbred mice. AKR/J (AK) and C57BL/6J (B6) mice have genetically low, whereas DBA/2J (D2) mice have genetically high levels of hepatic TPMT activity. No biochemical differences in TPMT have been detected among these strains of mouse. That observation increased the possibility that inherited variations in TPMT activity in these animals might be correlated with variations in the quantity of enzyme protein, just as they are in human tissue. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies to partially purified mouse liver TPMT were used to develop an immunoprecipitation assay for the enzyme. The volume of antiserum required to titrate 50% of the TPMT activity (antibody dose 50 or AD50) was used as a measure of immunoreactive TPMT protein. When AD50 values were measured in hepatic preparations from AK, B6 and D2 mice, inherited variations in levels of hepatic TPMT activity in these inbred strains were correlated directly with the quantity of TPMT immunoreactive protein. Identical results were obtained with F1 hybrids derived from AK X D2 and B6 X D2 matings. Finally, TPMT enzyme activity and immunoreactive protein levels were also correlated directly in hepatic preparations from six recombinant inbred (RI) strains derived from AK X D2 (AKXD) and six RI strains derived from B6 X D2 (BXD) matings. In neither AKXD nor BXD RI mice were there significant differences between TPMT homospecific activities in animals homozygous for the alleles for high or low TPMT activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90188896\r", 
  ".W": "Although dopamine is known to be present in sympathetic ganglia, its role and mode of action as a peripheral neurotransmitter are still poorly understood. Dopaminergic agonists have been shown to inhibit adrenal catecholamine release and calcium uptake. However, the specific dopamine receptor subtype mediating these effects and the receptor transduction mechanism remain unknown. We now provide evidence demonstrating 1) that slowly inactivating, voltage-gated calcium channels serve as a target site for dopaminergic modulation of chromaffin cell function and 2) that it is the D2 receptor subtype which mediates dopaminergic inhibitory effects on catecholamine secretion, 45Ca uptake and voltage-gated calcium currents. Whole cell patch clamp electrophysiological techniques were used to monitor directly voltage-gated Ca++ channels. The D2 agonist apomorphine but not the D1 agonist SKF 38393 reduced reversibly a slowly inactivating, voltage-gated calcium current in cultured chromaffin cells and this effect was blocked by the D2 receptor antagonist haloperidol. The presence of D2 but not D1 dopamine receptors on chromaffin cell membranes was demonstrated by radioligand binding methods, using the specific D1 and D2 receptor radioligands, [3H]SCH23390 and [3H]N-methylspiperone, respectively. Nicotine- and KCl (60 mM)-evoked catecholamine secretion and 45Ca uptake were inhibited by the D2 agonist, apomorphine, but not by the D1 agonist, SKF 38393. These inhibitory effects were prevented by the D2 antagonist, sulpiride, but not by the D1 antagonist, SCH 23390. D2 dopamine receptors appear to function as inhibitory modulators of adrenal catecholamine secretion with a mode of action involving inhibition of calcium channel currents.\r"

The structures of these unusual metabolites were established by comparison with spectral data of synthesized authentic standards and by enzymic hydrolysis of the conjugates. The N-glucuronide standards were synthesized by coupling the secondary amines to either glucuronic acid or to methyl tetra-O-acetyl-beta-D-glucopyranuronate. On i.p. dosing of rats with gallopamil or verapamil, 13 and 2% of the dose, respectively, appeared in the bile as the N-glucuronide of the secondary amine metabolite over an 8-hr period. Administration of norgallopamil resulted in approximately 25% of the dose being excreted as N-glucuronide conjugate in the bile. Substantially more of the S- than R-enantiomer of both gallopamil and verapamil was converted to the corresponding secondary amine N-glucuronide. The observed high S/R ratios suggest enantio-selectivity in this pathway could contribute to the observed stereoselectivity in other routes of metabolism of the parent tertiary amines.\r"

The ED50 values from the substitution study were compared to apparent pA2 values determined when antagonists were administered before agonists. Apparent affinities (pA2) for antagonists, estimated by their capacity to prevent the effects of the opioid agonist alfentanil, were: naltrexone = 8.69, naloxone = 7.78, quadazocine = 7.55, nalorphine = 7.31 and naltrindole = 5.29. The pA2 values were highly correlated (r = 0.94) with ED50 values determined in substitution studies. These results demonstrate that substitution by opioid antagonists for the naltrexone discriminative stimulus in morphine-treated monkeys provides a good estimate of affinity for opioid mu receptors as supported by independent pA2 analyses. These data also suggest affinity of opioid antagonists for opioid mu receptors is not changed in monkeys treated daily with 3.2 mg/kg of morphine and, furthermore, support the notion that binding to opioid receptors is the mechanism, by which antagonists precipitate withdrawal in opioid-dependent monkeys.\r"

However, a single challenge with morphine (300 mg/kg) also markedly (P less than .001) increased mortality (94%) of infected mice when the morphine was administered at day 13 postinfection; susceptibility to the lethal effect was not observed until day 9 postinfection, a time when immune reactivity was evident (i.e., 3- to 4-fold splenic enlargement). This lethal effect was attenuated by pretreatment with naltrexone, suggesting involvement of an opiate receptor mechanism. Sulfadiazine treatment abrogated morphine-induced mortality, indicating a prerequisite of an active infectious state. These findings suggest that immune activation by T. gondii infection plays a critical role in morphine-induced mortality in this murine model.\r"

PCP caused a dramatic, reversible and dose-dependent decrease of the current. An analysis of the dose-response relationship suggests a single site of action for PCP with an IC50 of 4.7 microM. Dextrorphan and naloxone also inhibited the current, although their effects were of a lower magnitude than those of PCP. Neither 10 microM dextrorphan nor 100 microM naloxone antagonized the inhibitory action of 10 microM PCP. The analysis of the dose-response curve for PCP in presence of 100 microM naloxone suggested that the two drugs act at the same site. We also investigated the effect of morphine on the K+ current. Morphine, in concentrations up to 100 microM, inhibited the K+ current less than dextrorphan or PCP. The kinetics and voltage dependence of the currents in the presence of morphine suggest that it interacts with a different site or different conformation of the channel than the other three compounds. Our findings show that certain opioids can act on thymocytes through a system completely different from the typical opioid receptors.\r"

Studies evaluated whether the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) mediates directly the ACTH response to nicotine administered i.v. and if regions adjacent to the fourth ventricle (IV) are involved. Direct involvement of the PVN in the release of ACTH in response to i.v. nicotine (0.03 or 0.01 mg/kg b.wt.) was refuted by studies in which the administration of the nicotinic cholinergic antagonist, mecamylamine (20 or 40 micrograms bilaterally adjacent to the PVN), failed to block ACTH secretion. To activate sites distal to the third ventricle, nicotine (0.25, 0.5, 2.5 or 5.0 micrograms) was injected into the IV; ACTH levels peaked between 3 and 7 min. Nicotine 0.25 micrograms injected into the IV elevated ACTH to levels within the range of those produced by i.v. nicotine (0.03 mg/kg b.wt.). To confirm that sites accessible from the IV are involved, mecamylamine was administered i.v. (0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg b.wt.) or into the IV (4 or 40 micrograms) and nicotine was delivered by the opposite route. Intravenous mecamylamine reduced the plasma ACTH response to 0.25 micrograms of nicotine in the IV. Mecamylamine, administered into the IV before i.v. nicotine (0.03 mg/kg b.wt.) antagonized the effect of nicotine. These results indicate that stimulation of ACTH secretion by nicotine delivered i.v. occurs via structures accessible from the IV. In contrast to prevailing ideas, the PVN does not appear to be the direct site of action of nicotine.\r"

  ".W": "Veratrum alkaloids were used to examine the effect of neural stimulation on intestinal ion transport in full-thickness (intact) and serosally stripped (mucosal) preparations of mouse jejunum. When applied to the serosal media of mucosal preparations, veratrine or veratridine evoked a biphasic increase in transmural potential difference and short-circuit current, consisting of phasic and tonic increases of both bioelectric parameters without a change of tissue conductance; these responses were blocked by pretreatment with tetrodotoxin, but unaffected by pretreatment with atropine, naloxone or yohimbine. In ion flux experiments, neural stimulation of mucosal tissues produced changes of unidirectional fluxes that corresponded with an increase in net Cl- secretion and a reduction of net Na+ absorption, supporting a net secretory role for neurons that were associated with the intestinal mucosa. In intact jejunal preparations, neural stimulation by veratrine or veratridine caused a tetrodotoxin-sensitive reduction of basal transmural potential difference and short-circuit current and a significant increase of tissue conductance. Flux studies on intact tissues failed to reveal the ionic basis for the effects of nerve stimulation by veratridine in these tissues. Nonetheless, the neurally evoked reduction of short-circuit current was attenuated by yohimbine pretreatment, but unaffected by naloxone or atropine, suggesting an involvement of alpha-2 adrenoceptors in the mediation of this effect. These findings demonstrate the existence of endogenous neurotransmitter systems that play opposing roles in the regulation of mucosal ion transport in the small intestine of the mouse.\r"

The present study investigated angiotensin metabolism by AmA and AmM activities in rat plasma. Plasma AmA and AmM activities hydrolyzed glutamyl-2-naphthylamide and alanyl-2-naphthylamide at rates of 10.6 and 30.0 nmol/min/ml, respectively. Plasma hydrolysis of AII (4.1 +/- 0.5 nmol/min/ml) was only one-third as rapid as AIII (13.3 +/- 1.7 nmol/min/ml). The Km of AII and AIII for AmA and AmM were 90.3 +/- 14.3 and 29.5 +/- 8.2 microM, respectively. The aminopeptidase inhibitor amastatin was 40-fold more potent as an inhibitor of AmM activity (IC50 = 0.2 microM) than of AmA activity (IC50 = 8 microM). In order to examine metabolism in vivo, blood pressure responses to angiotensins were obtained in anesthesized rats before and during infusion of amastatin (16 nmol/min i.v.). Amastatin specifically inhibited plasma AmM and AmA activities 81 and 10%, respectively. Consistent with the lower inhibition of AmA, the potency of angiotensin I and AII were only slightly increased after amastatin. However, the potency of AIII and des(Asp1)angiotensin I were significantly increased regarding both maximal change in blood pressure and duration of action. These data support an important role for both AmA and AmM activities in the metabolism of circulating angiotensins and establish both the value and limitations of amastatin as an inhibitor of peripheral angiotensin metabolism.\r"

Ablations included: 1) undercutting for removal of all afferent axons; 2) destruction of the raphe nuclei; 3) cortical ibotenic acid injections for removal of neurons and 4) anterior thalamic and caudate nuclei injections of the immunotoxin OX7-saporin which destroys single classes of cortical projection neurons by retrograde axonal transport. Peak paroxetine binding was in layer Ia with low binding in layer Va and moderate amounts in other layers. Undercut lesions reduced binding only in layer Ia by 35%. Major loses were observed after raphe ablations with decreases of 40 to 72% across all layers. Cortical ibotenic acid injections did not alter paroxetine binding. Peak cyanopindolol binding was in layers Ia to Ic. Undercutting decreased binding significantly in layers Ia, Ib, III and IV, whereas after raphe lesions binding was decreased by 34 to 58% in layers Ia to IV. 5,7-Dihydroxytryptamine injection increased binding by 10 to 40% in layers Ib, II, III and IV. Cortical ibotenic acid injections reduced grain density in all layers with a range of 28 to 47%. Peak 8-OH-DPAT binding was in layer Vb. No change was observed after undercut lesions, whereas after cortical ibotenic acid injection, binding reductions of 44 to 75% were observed throughout all nine sublaminae. Thalamic OX7-saporin injections destroyed almost all layer VI neurons, which resulted in a 45% decrease in layer VI 8-OH-DPAT binding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effects of phenobarbital (Pb)-pretreatment and bilateral renal ligation on the disposition of acetaminophen, acetaminophen glucuronide (AG) and acetaminophen sulfate (AS) were examined in serum, bile and urine of rats. Pb-pretreatment significantly decreased the percentage of the acetaminophen dose (100 mg/kg) excreted in bile as the glucuronide and sulfate conjugates in rats with intact kidneys [AG (0.94% vs. 6.49%); AS (1.41% vs. 4.19%)] and in renal-ligated rats [AG (2.22% vs. 7.71%); AS (6.12% vs. 9.13%)], compared to vehicle-pretreated controls. Decreased biliary recovery of AG occurred despite a Pb-induced increase in the fraction of the acetaminophen dose converted to AG. Similarly, biliary recovery of AS was reduced further than expected based on Pb-associated decreases in the fraction of the acetaminophen dose converted to AS. These observations suggest that the hepatobiliary disposition of AG and AS was altered at multiple sites due to 1) direct interactions with Pb (or a Pb metabolite) and/or 2) metabolic induction by Pb. Renal ligation shifted the metabolic pathway toward sulfation, with a subsequent increase in biliary recovery of AS. However, renal ligation did not alter the percentage of the dose excreted as AG in bile despite a marked elevation in AG serum concentrations. Furthermore, biliary excretion rate vs. time profiles of AG and AS in renal-ligated rats exhibited a terminal half-life exceeding that of acetaminophen in serum. These data provide evidence that diffusional barriers between blood and hepatocytes influence the hepatic disposition and routes of elimination of polar metabolites such as AG and AS.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of the present study was to characterize the cardiorespiratory effects of activation of 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT2 receptor subtypes at the intermediate area of the ventral surface of the medulla. The agonists (+/-)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-N-propylamino)tetralin hydrobromide (8-OH-DPAT), 1-[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-piperazine hydrochloride (TFMPP) and (+/-)-1-(2,5-di-methoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane hydrochloride (DOI) were used to activate these receptor subtypes, respectively. Application of each drug to the intermediate area produced a different profile of cardiorespiratory effects. 8-OH-DPAT (0.0625-4.0 micrograms) produced dose-dependent hypotension and bradycardia, which were antagonized by the 5-HT1A antagonists spiperone and spiroxatrine. The bradycardia was blocked by bilateral vagotomy. No significant changes in respiratory motor outflow to the larynx or diaphragm were observed after application of 8-OH-DPAT. TFMPP (10-1000 micrograms) also produced a dose-dependent hypotension and bradycardia. However, these effects were not antagonized by spiperone or blocked by vagotomy. A decrease in the amplitude of the recurrent laryngeal and phrenic nerve signals was observed after application of the highest dose of TFMPP. In contrast to the effects of 8-OH-DPAT and TFMPP, DOI (0.3-100 micrograms) produced an increase in blood pressure without any change in heart rate. Recurrent laryngeal and phrenic nerve activities were depressed, as was respiratory rate, after application of DOI. Both the cardiovascular and respiratory effects of DOI were blocked by the 5-HT2 antagonist ketanserin. These results indicate that activation of ventral medullary 5-HT receptor subtypes produces unique effects on cardiorespiratory activity.\r"

The increase in blood pressure produced by alpha-CH3-5-HT was blocked by the 5-HT2 selective antagonist, LY53857, supporting a role for vascular 5-HT2 receptors in the pressor response to these amines. In contrast, LY53857 did not antagonize tachycardia produced by 2CH3-5-HT. Furthermore, propranolol also did not block 2CH3-5-HT-induced tachycardia, indicating that an indirect neuronal effect to release norepinephrine cannot explain the increase in heart rate to 2CH3-5-HT. Tachycardia to 2CH3-5-HT (as well as to isoproterenol) was modestly inhibited, but never abolished by interruption of the autonomic nervous system with atropine or hexamethonium. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, zacopride, ICS 205-930 and GR38032F, dose-dependently blocked the tachycardia and pressor response to 2CH3-5-HT. These data establish the presence of a 5-HT3 receptor mediating a direct positive chronotropic effect of 5-HT in conscious dogs, an effect that depends, only minimally, on the presence of an intact autonomic nervous system.\r"

  ".U": "90188911\r", 
  ".W": "Our previous studies have shown that a low dose of angiotensin II (Ang II) stimulates fluid and bicarbonate absorption from the apical side of rat proximal tubule (PCT). These effects can be blocked by Ang II antagonist, (Sar1, Ile8)Ang II. The cellular mechanism underlying Ang II action, however, remained unclear. Thus, this study was designed to investigate the possible role of phosphoinositide turnover in mediating this action of angiotensin. Rat PCT was perfused in vivo with Ringer's solution containing [3H]inulin as a volume marker. Bicarbonate flux (JHCO3) was determined by total CO2 changes between the collected fluid and the original perfusate as analyzed by microcalorimetry. Luminal perfusion of 10(-11) M Ang II stimulated both JHCO3 and fluid reabsorption. These effects could be blocked by 10(-3) M amiloride and 10(-5) M ethylisopropylamiloride. Luminal perfusion of 4 beta-phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (10(-8) M) also stimulated both fluid reabsorption and JHCO3. These effects could also be blocked by amiloride and ethylisopropylamiloride. When both Ang II (10(-11) M) and 4 beta-phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (10(-8) M) were perfused together, the stimulatory effects on fluid reabsorption and JHCO3 were not additive. These results suggest that Ang II interacts with its receptors on the apical membrane leading to modulation of the Na-H exchange mechanism in PCT. The phosphoinositide turnover may play an important role in the Ang II action on PCT transport.\r"

Rats were tested in a thermally graded tunnel (thermocline) which allowed for simultaneous measurement of body temperature, ambient temperature selection and general ambulatory activity levels. DAMGO (0.3 micrograms) caused an increase in body temperature which was facilitated by the selection of a warm ambient temperature. Both DPDPE (30 micrograms) and U-50,488H (100 micrograms) caused decreases in body temperature which were accompanied by a selection of a cool ambient temperature. In each case there was evidence for a regulated change in body temperature, with DAMGO increasing thermoregulatory set point and DPDPE and U-50,488H decreasing set point. DAMGO and U-50,488H produced a depression of activity levels for the first 15 min after injection. DAMGO and DPDPE produced increases in activity levels which peaked after body temperature had returned toward base-line levels. These data characterize further the differentiable profiles of physiological effects produced by these three compounds. The central modulation of the control of body temperature by these opioid receptor agonists may reflect a role of endogenous opioids in thermoregulatory control.\r"

The present study examined the role of alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors in sympathetic control of the isolated in situ proximal urethra of the rat. An endogenous alpha adrenergic constriction was demonstrated in the proximal urethra by eliciting dose-related and phentolamine-sensitive increases in UPP after the systemic administration of tyramine. Transient dose-related and hexamethonium-sensitive increases in UPP were also elicited by ganglionic stimulation with 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium (DMPP). Based on the relative sensitivity of the DMPP response to standard autonomic blockers, it was determined that constriction is the predominant autonomic response in the proximal urethra and this response is mediated by alpha adrenoceptor mechanisms. Prazosin, a selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist, substantially reduced (72%) the steady-state increases in UPP elicited by discrete low frequency electrical stimulation of the spinal hypogastric outflow. In contrast, selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor blockade with rauwolscine significantly increased (28%) the UPP response to hypogastric stimulation. Prazosin also abolished the increase in urethral tone elicited by tyramine, whereas rauwolscine had no effect on the tyramine. A different response profile was observed for prazosin and rauwolscine when the steady-state increase in UPP was evoked by simultaneously stimulating the midthoracic and hypogastric spinal outflow. Under these conditions of sympathoadrenal activation, UPP was reduced by both prazosin and rauwolscine (63 and 50%, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It inhibited the specific binding of labeled angiotensin II to its receptor sites in rat adrenal cortical membranes and in cultured rat smooth muscle cells with IC50 values of 19 and 20 X 10(-9) M, respectively. Functional antagonism was demonstrated by its blockage of angiotensin II (3 X 10(-8) M)-induced 45Ca++ efflux in rat aortic smooth muscle cells with an IC50 of 2 X 10(-8) M. In rabbit aorta, DuP 753 antagonized the contractile response to angiotensin II competitively with a pA2 value of 8.48 but had no effect on the responses induced by norepinephrine or KCl. In both in vitro and in vivo assays, no partial agonistic effect was detected even with concentrations of up to 10(-5) M. In addition, this agent (10(-5) or 10(-4) M) exhibited no direct effect on converting enzyme (rabbit lung) or renin (rat plasma). These data demonstrate that DuP 753, is a potent and highly specific angiotensin II receptor antagonist. This agent may be a useful experimental or therapeutic tool for interference with the renin-angiotensin system in health and diseases.\r"

Four autotransplanted mongrel dogs with programmable, implantable pump/catheter systems received a continuous intrarenal heparin infusion which was increased daily in stepwise fashion. Activated coagulation time (ACT) rose linearly with local heparin dose, indicating that heparin clearance remained constant over the dosage range studied. Comparison of these ACT values with those measured during same-dose i.v. infusion and those predicted from i.v. bolus studies revealed that there was little or no first-pass renal extraction of heparin by the transplanted kidney. In nine allografted dogs, the heparin infusion rate was adjusted according to daily ACT to maximize local heparin delivery but still maintain the ACT close to 125% of base line. There was no difference in overall survival between the heparin-treated dogs and a group of 14 untreated controls, and vascular rejection was significantly more intense in the heparin-treated animals. We conclude that intrarenal dosing of heparin to the point of producing systemic anticoagulation is limited by failure of the transplanted kidney to eliminate drug and does not prolong canine renal allograft survival.\r"

  ".W": "The main objective of these studies was to determine whether the basal release of acetylcholine (ACh) from brain slices was subject to modulation by muscarinic receptor blockade. Incubation of striatal slices with the muscarinic antagonist atropine increased ACh release in a concentration-dependent manner with a maximal effect (1.4-1.8 times control release) achieved with 0.1 to 1.0 microM. In contrast, ACh release from hippocampal slices was unaltered by any concentration of atropine tested, indicating that the basal release of neurotransmitter from striatum, but not hippocampus, was subject to modulation by muscarinic receptor blockade. Incubation of striatal slices with 1 microM tetrodotoxin or removal of Ca++ from the medium decreased the basal release of ACh by 20% and abolished the atropine-induced release of ACh; neurotransmitter release from hippocampal slices was unaltered by tetrodotoxin. Thus, part of the basal release of ACh from striatal slices is a consequence of the intrinsic impulse activity of cholinergic neurons and it is this component of release that is atropine-sensitive. Oxotremorine was unable to antagonize the atropine-induced release of ACh, even with concentrations 100 times that of atropine, whereas pirenzepine increased ACh release and, like that of atropine, the effect of pirenzepine was sensitive to tetrodotoxin and resistant to oxotremorine. These results indicate that a component of basal ACh release from striatal slices is subject to modulation by a receptor that is sensitive to atropine and pirenzepine, but not to oxotremorine, suggesting that this site differs from the nerve terminal muscarinic autoreceptor.\r"

  ".U": "90188919\r", 
  ".W": "The addition of both full and partial muscarinic agonists to human SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells resulted in a sustained phosphoinositide (PPI) hydrolysis for up to 2 hr, as monitored either by the accumulation of [3H]inositol phosphates (IP) in the presence of Li+, or alternatively, by an increased labeling of phosphatidate and phosphatidylinositol (PI) from 32Pi. This enhanced PPI hydrolysis was maintained even though 40-50% of cell-surface muscarinic cholinergic receptors (mAChRs) became sequestered. Desensitization of carbachol-stimulated PPI hydrolysis was only detected after a 2-4 hr prior exposure of the cells to the agonist and was accompanied by a comparable reduction in total mAChR number. Prolonged incubation of SK-N-SH cells with the partial agonist bethanechol also resulted in a desensitization of stimulated PPI turnover but at a slower rate than that observed for carbachol and with a loss of fewer mAChR sites. Desensitization of mAChR-stimulated [3H]IP formation appeared to occur more rapidly in mouse NIE-115 neuroblastoma. However, Li+ could not fully prevent the degradation of accumulated [3H]IP in these cells. When an increase in [32P]phosphatidylinositol labeling was used to assess PPI turnover in NIE-115 cells, no desensitization was evident for up to 2 hr. We conclude that 1) in SK-N-SH cells, desensitization more closely parallels the down-regulation than the sequestration of mAChRs, 2) in both neuroblastomas, stimulated PPI hydrolysis desensitizes relatively slowly and 3) the appearance of desensitization can vary as a function of the assay method employed.\r"

The treatment did not modify the vasodilation induced by forskolin (a direct activator of the catalytic subunit of the adenylate cyclase), 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (a phosphodiesterase inhibitor), adenosine or acetylcholine. IS increased (cAMP) cyclic AMP levels dose-dependently in rat aorta, and this effect was reduced markedly in arteries from CLEN-treated rats. By contrast, the treatment did not modify the forskolin-induced cAMP production. The contractile response to (-)-norepinephrine (NE) was inhibited in the presence of IS or CLEN in control aortic rings. However, this modulatory effect was not seen in arteries from CLEN-treated rats. Preincubation of the arteries with either cholera toxin (an activator of the stimulatory guanine nucleotide binding protein, Gs) or forskolin reduced NE-induced vasoconstriction to the same extent in aortic rings from both control and CLEN-treated rats. The chronotropic response to NE in rat atria (beta-1-mediated) was not affected by the treatment. These results suggest that prolonged administration of CLEN to rats induced desensitization of beta-2 adrenoceptor-mediated vascular relaxation by alterations at the level of the beta-2 adrenergic receptor, but not in the mechanisms related to Gs, adenylate cyclase or in those distal to cAMP production.\r"

  ".W": "The muscarinic cholinoceptors in porcine coronary artery were identified and characterized by a binding assay using (-)-[3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) and also by pharmacological method. Specific (-)-[3H]QNB binding in the coronary artery was saturable and of high affinity (Kd = 0.08 nM), and it showed a pharmacological specificity as well as stereoselectivity which characterized muscarinic receptors. Muscarinic antagonists competed with the (-)-[3H]QNB binding in order: nonlabeled QNB greater than dexetimide greater than atropine greater than pirenzepine greater than AF-DX 116 greater than levetimide greater than gallamine. Dexetimide was approximately 2000 times as potent as levetimide. The potencies (pKi) of these muscarinic antagonists in competing for (-)-[3H]QNB binding sites in porcine coronary artery correlated well with their pharmacological potencies (pA2 for antagonistic effect of acetylcholine-induced contraction of coronary artery). The decrease in the (-)-[3H]QNB binding by atropine and pirenzepine was due to a reduction in the apparent affinity with little change in the number of maximal binding sites, suggesting a competitive antagonism. Specific (-)-[3H]QNB binding (Kd and maximal number of binding sites) in porcine coronary artery was not changed by the removal of endothelium. We conclude: 1) (-)-[3H]QNB selectively labels the physiologically relevant muscarinic receptors in porcine coronary artery and 2) the majority of these receptors is localized on vascular smooth muscles and the receptors mediate the acetylcholine-induced contractile response of coronary artery.\r"

  ".U": "90188923\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of quinpirole, a specific dopamine DA2 receptor agonist, were investigated on both cardiovascular responses in conscious dogs and catecholamine release from the adrenal medulla in anesthetized dogs. In conscious normal dogs, i.v. quinpirole (30 micrograms/kg) elicited a decrease in blood pressure and a marked increase in heart rate associated with a rise in plasma catecholamine levels. The increase in heart rate is due to both baroreflex and central mechanisms because a slight but significant positive chronotropic effect persists in sinoaortic denervated dogs (i.e., animals deprived of baroreflex pathways). The central origin of this excitatory effect was confirmed by two subsequent protocols: intracisterna magna injection of quinpirole (5 micrograms/kg) increased blood pressure, heart rate and plasma catecholamines; i.v. domperidone reversed the hypotensive effect of i.v. quinpirole into a pressor response. The rise in plasma catecholamines was associated with an increase in plasma vasopressin levels. In anesthetized dogs, i.v. quinpirole (10 micrograms/kg/min during 12 min), which also decreased blood pressure, failed to modify epinephrine (and norepinephrine) release from the adrenal medulla whatever the stimulation frequencies (1, 3 and 5 Hz) of the sectioned splanchnic nerve. Similar results were obtained with apomorphine (5 micrograms/kg/min during 12 min). These results show that two mechanisms are involved in the action of quinpirole: first, a peripheral depressor action (which elicits the decrease in blood pressure) and secondly, a central pressor component involving an increase in both sympathetic tone and vasopressin release. They also demonstrate clearly that peripheral DA2 receptors are not involved in the control of catecholamine release from the adrenal medulla under in vivo conditions.\r"

Carbachol (0.1 mM) caused a rapid increase in [3H]InsP3 and [3H]InsP2 followed by delayed increases in [3H]InsP1 and [3H]InsP4 accumulation. Analysis of the [3H]InsP3 isomers by HPLC showed an immediate although transient increase in [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 with a progressive and sustained accumulation of [3H]Ins(1,3,4)P3. [3H]Ins(1,3,4)P3 was confirmed as the predominant (greater than 80%) [3H]InsP3 isomer present at 1 and 30 min using an enzymatic method which causes selective hydrolysis of Ins(1,3,4)P3. Lithium enhanced markedly the carbachol-stimulated accumulation of [3H]InsP1 and [3H]InsP2 with a lower potency than that observed in other tissues but had no significant influence on [3H]InsP3 or [3H]InsP4 values.

Compared to a pH equilibrium condition (pHin = 7.4; pHout = 7.4), an outwardly directed OH- gradient (pHin = 7.4; pHout = 5.8) stimulated markedly both lactate and pyrazinoate uptake with overshoots exceeding 2 times that of the steady state. In contrast, neither OH-/urate nor OH-/PAH exchange could be demonstrated. An outwardly directed Cl- gradient (Cl-in = 100 mM; Cl-out = 16.7 mM) increased 2.6-fold 15-sec PAH uptake compared to Cl- equilibrium (Cl-in = Cl-out = 100 mM) but this stimulation was due solely to an effect of membrane potential. Creation of an electropositive intravesicular space, by imposing an inwardly directed K+ gradient (K+in = 0 mM; K+out = 100 mM) in the presence of valinomycin, was very effective to drive uphill PAH and urate accumulation compared to the control condition (no valinomycin). Four-second potential-stimulated PAH uptake was saturable (Km, 0.8 mM; Vmax, 1.7 nmol/mg of protein x 4 sec). Different organic anions cis-inhibited both 4-sec potential-stimulated PAH and urate uptakes in a similar fashion. PAH and urate, moreover, decreased each other's accumulation. In countertransport experiments, PAH and urate uptakes were not significantly stimulated by trans-unlabeled substrate. These results are consistent with the presence, in the pig renal brush border membrane, of a mediated secretory pathway common for urate and PAH, which could be facilitated by the potential difference existing in vivo across the luminal membrane of the proximal tubule.\r"

We now describe two major differences in the effects of muscarinic agonists. First, the greater potency of carbachol in inhibiting cyclic AMP formation (EC50 = 8 nM) than in stimulating the accumulation of inositol phosphates and tension (EC50 = 15 and 2 microM, respectively). Second, carbachol, oxotremorine and pilocarpine were equally effective in eliciting cyclic AMP inhibition but the order of potency for inositol phosphate formation was carbachol greater than oxotremorine and pilocarpine was without effect. The partial agonists, pilocarpine and oxotremorine, inhibited carbachol-mediated inositol phosphate formation. Pirenzepine, selective for muscarinic M1 receptor subtype, displayed a low affinity for antagonizing cyclic AMP inhibition, inositol phosphate generation and tension due to carbachol (Ki = 286, 92 and 110 nM, respectively). AF-DX116 (11-[( 2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1- piperidinyl]acetyl)-5,11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine- 6-one), selective for cardiac M2 receptors blocked cyclic AMP inhibition with high affinity (Ki = 1.14 nM) while it antagonized inositol phosphate formation with low affinity (Ki = 346 nM). Both high (Ki = 1 nM) and low (Ki = 100 nM) affinities were displayed by AF-DX116 in antagonizing contractions due to carbachol (24 and 76% inhibition, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

NT was more potent in releasing DA from the substantia nigra than from the nucleus caudate (EC50%, 1.1 microM in substantia nigra and 9.8 microM in nucleus caudate). In vitro, in superfused rabbit brain slices, NT enhanced the depolarization-evoked release of DA and exerted a direct releasing effect. The latter was greater in the substantia nigra, and the former in the nucleus caudate. The direct releasing effect of NT was not inhibited, but enhanced by nomifensine (3 microM). Sulpiride, a D2 DA receptor antagonist, failed to modify NT-induced DA release; in addition, NT did not affect the inhibition of DA and acetylcholine release produced by LY-171555, a D2 DA agonist. In both the substantia nigra and the nucleus caudate, desensitization to the releasing effect of NT was observed, either after 2.5, 5, or 10 min of exposure to the peptide. A synergistic interaction on DA release was observed between NT and potassium (K+), and between NT and electrical stimulation. Greater synergism was observed with high extracellular K+. Pretreatment of striatal slices with 15 mM K+ produced a 9-fold enhancement of NT-induced DA release. When K+ (25 mM, 2 min) was given together with NT there was a 2- to 3-fold increase in DA release compared to the release evoked by K+ in the absence of NT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

DMI alone had no effect on [3H]5-HT binding but reduced [3H]ketanserin binding in cortical membranes, 5-HT-stimulated inositol phosphate (IP) formation in cortical slices and the degree of inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase by 5-HT in hippocampal membranes. Li alone reduced [3H]5-HT binding and the degree of inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase by 5-HT in hippocampal membranes, and also reduced [3H]ketanserin binding and 5-HT-stimulated IP formation in the cortex. The two treatments combined in general produced effects similar to those of Li alone, but the decrease in [3H]ketanserin binding in cortical membranes was significantly greater than that given by Li alone, whereas the reduction in the degree of inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase by 5-HT in hippocampal membranes was significantly greater than that produced by DMI alone. It is concluded that the therapeutic action of Li when added to tricyclic antidepressants in the treatment of refractory depression may partly have its basis in potentiation of effects on the serotonergic system in the brain.\r"

Application of cromakalim (greater than 3 microM) generated an outward current, the reversal potential of which (-79 mV) was almost the same as the theoretical K equilibrium potential (-80 mV) under the experimental conditions used. When the Ca in the physiological salt solution (PSS) was replaced with Mn, the cromakalim-induced outward current was inhibited markedly. When 4 mM ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether(N,N'-N,N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) was added to the pipette solution (bath solution, Ca-free PSS + Mn), cromakalim inhibited the outward current evoked by command pulses. Using a pipette solution containing high Cs with 4 mM EGTA and a bath PSS containing 2.5 mM Ca with 1 microM tetrodotoxin, the Ca inward current was isolated. Cromakalim (greater than 3 microM) inhibited the Ca inward current in a voltage- dependent manner. Cromakalim (30 microM) inhibited the Ca inward current to 0.6 times the control. The decay of the inward Ca current comprised fast and slow components. Cromakalim inhibited the latter component and shifted the voltage-dependent inactivation curve of this current to the left (more hyperpolarized direction) in a parallel manner and delayed recovery from inactivation as estimated using a double pulse protocol. By using a pipette solution containing high Cs with 4 mM EGTA and Ca-free PSS containing 2.5 mM Mn in the bath, Na inward currents, blocked by tetrodotoxin (IC50 = 10 nM), were evoked by depolarizing pulses. Cromakalim (up to 30 microM) had no effect on the Na inward current.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The present study correlates the PTH-induced vasodilatory effect with the biochemical changes in cyclic AMP (cAMP) content and Ca++ uptake in the vascular tissue. Synthetic fragment bPTH-(1-34) (1.2 X 10(-7) M) significantly inhibited the contraction of the isolated tail artery of rat induced by KCl (30-80 mM). It also relaxed KCl (40 and 60 mM)-induced contractions in a concentration-dependent manner [2.7 X 10(-9) to 3.7 X 10(-8) M)]. In addition, the concentration-contraction curve of Ca (0.3-3.0 mM) was shifted to the right by PTH in 40 mM KCl Krebs-Henseleit solution. These suggest the blocking effects of PTH on Ca entry. This hypothesis was supported by a study in which PTH inhibited KCl-enhanced 45Ca uptake, an effect similar to that of D600. In the experiment with matched tissue, PTH increased tissue cAMP content whereas KCl did not. These suggest that the vascular actions of PTH may involve both cAMP and Ca entry blocking. It is important to know that PTH was capable of stimulating cAMP content in Ca-free medium, suggesting that the increase in cAMP level by PTH may not be secondary to the change in Ca++ uptake.\r"

We reinvestigated if it was possible to reveal this phenomenon by carefully choosing a concentration of the alpha adrenoceptor blocker prazosin that would give a significant displacement while it still was possible to completely surmount the blockade by reasonable concentrations of norepinephrine. Both inotropic and lusitropic dose-dependent responses to norepinephrine in rabbit heart papillary muscles were recorded. In the presence of 3 X 10(-9) M prazosin there was a significant rightward shift of a component corresponding to about 20% of the total inotropic response to norepinephrine. The prazosin-sensitive component was shifted significantly more to the left by 3 X 10(-5) M cocaine than the nonsensitive component. The maximal inotropic response to norepinephrine was increased at lower prazosin-concentrations (3 X 10(-9) M), whereas at 10(-7) M prazosin the maximal response was unchanged compared to the absence of prazosin. The maximal lusitropic response to norepinephrine was increased monophasically and dose-dependently by prazosin. Thus, by carefully considering the relative potencies of the agonist and the antagonist it was possible to demonstrate an alpha adrenoceptor blocker sensitive component in the inotropic response to norepinephrine in rabbit heart. The effect of cocaine upon the prazosin-sensitive component would indicate that the alpha adrenoceptor population in rabbit myocardium is located more closely to the sympathetic nerve endings than the beta adrenoceptor population.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Bestatin has been effectively used by p.o. administration, but the mechanisms of intestinal absorption remain to be solved. The present study was undertaken to examine whether bestatin, a dipeptide containing an unusual amino acid, is transported via dipeptide carriers in intestinal brush-border membranes, by using cephradine as a probe for the H+/dipeptide cotransport system. The initial uptake of cephradine in the presence or absence of an inward H+ gradient, driving force, was inhibited by bestatin and this inhibition occurred in a competitive manner (Ki = 0.47 mM). The uptake of cephradine was stimulated by the countertransport effect of bestatin, the definitive criterion for ascertaining a common transport system. These findings indicate that bestatin, as well as cephradine and other p.o. cephalosporins, can be transported via dipeptide carriers in intestinal brush-border membranes.\r"

  ".W": "Effects of opioids and opioid antagonists on citric acid-induced cough and reflex bronchoconstriction have been examined in conscious guinea pigs. Airway reflexes produced by inhaled citric acid are mediated by capsaicin sensitive sensory neurons, and we examined particularly the possibility that inhibitory effects of opioids can be exerted locally in the airway. As expected, systemically administered codeine (1-10 mg/kg), meperidine (3-30 mg/kg) and morphine (1-10 mg/kg) dose-dependently inhibited cough and bronchoconstriction. However, inhalations of nebulized codeine (10-100 mg/ml) and morphine (10-30 mg/ml) also produced these effects. The potency and rapid onset of action of inhaled codeine suggest that it exerted its effects without first being metabolized to morphine. The opioid receptor antagonist naloxone completely (10-100 micrograms/kg), and nalorphine (a mixed agonist/antagonist) (1-3 mg/kg) partly, inhibited codeine's antitussive and antibronchoconstrictor effects. Nalorphine alone (3-30 mg/kg) inhibited citric acid induced reflexes, whereas naloxone was without effect. Prior inhalation of a quaternary opioid receptor antagonist, levallorphan methyl iodide (10 mg/ml), abolished the inhibitory effects of inhaled codeine (30 mg/ml). The present data suggest that inhibition of cough and reflex bronchoconstriction can be produced by opioids, acting on mu and kappa receptors located in the guinea pig tracheobronchial tree. The possible existence in the airways of a unique opioid receptor mediating inhibition of cough (as described in the central nervous system) cannot be excluded.\r"

  ".W": "It has been proposed that ethanol and aging may interact synergistically to impair brain function through effects on central muscarinic receptors. Previous studies have investigated the effect of either chronic ethanol treatment or aging, but not both factors simultaneously, on brain muscarinic receptors. We have studied brain muscarinic receptors in animals treated with ethanol for up to 25 months. Ethanol consumption for 3 and 9 months resulted in increased density of quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) binding sites in cortex, coinciding with an increase in high-affinity pirenzepine binding sites and low-affinity carbachol binding sites. Upregulation of QNB binding sites in striatum and hippocampus became obvious after further ethanol treatment (15 and 21 months, respectively). Affinity of QNB binding sites and carbachol binding sites was not altered by ethanol treatment. However, there was an ethanol-related decrease in affinity of low-affinity pirenzepine binding sites in cerebral cortex. Density of QNB binding sites and low-affinity pirenzepine binding sites decreased with age in three brain areas investigated. There were age-related changes in receptor affinity in hippocampus and striatum, but not in cortex. Ethanol-related upregulation of muscarinic receptors was superimposed on age-related loss of receptors. We conclude that acceleration of the aging process associated with ethanol abuse is unlikely to be explained on the basis of alterations in receptor density or affinity.\r"

  ".W": "We have recently shown that a cytochrome P-450-based mechanism is important for the generation of contractile tension by the ductus arteriosus and have now examined whether the same mechanism operates in the ductus venosus. Carbon monoxide (CO/O2 ratio, 0.27) and cytochrome P-450 inhibitors [metyrapone; 4-phenylimidazole; 14-isocyano, 15-(methoxymethyleneoxy)-5Z,8Z,11Z- eicosatrienoic acid; alpha-naphthoflavone] were tested in vitro on the ductus venosus sphincter from mature fetal lambs. Each preparation was precontracted with indomethacin (2.8 x 10(-6) M). Carbon monoxide completely relaxed the ductus, and its action was reversed by illumination with monochromatic light. Peak photocontraction occurred at 450 nm. With the exception of alpha-naphthoflavone, all cytochrome P-450 inhibitors were also relaxant agents. Alpha-naphthoflavone (the sole type I inhibitor tested) produced instead a modest contraction that was often transient. Relaxation brought about by both carbon monoxide and drugs was fully reversed by the thromboxane A2 analog 9,11-epithio-11,12-methano-thromboxane A2 and by excess potassium (55 mM). Carbon monoxide was equally effective in the intact ductus and the ductus denuded of endothelium, whereas cytochrome P-450 inhibitors were marginally less effective in the latter preparation. These findings indicate that the ductus venosus sphincter, like the ductus arteriosus, relies on an intramural cytochrome P-450 mechanism to develop its contractile tone. The actual constrictor remains to be characterized in both vessels.\r"

Inhibition of [3H]Ro5-4864 binding by unlabeled Ro5-4864, PK11195, midazolam, diazepam, clonazepam and flumazenil indicated that [3H]Ro5-4864 bound to specific receptors and binding was reversible. Scatchard analysis indicated a single class of binding site, with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 12.8 +/- 2.1 nM with maximum binding capacity of 2.6 +/- 0.6 pmol/mg of protein for human lung and Kd of 8.4 +/- 1.5 nM and maximum binding capacity of 3.5 +/- 0.3 pmol/mg of protein for guinea pig lung. Autoradiograms showed specific labeling over discrete structures in both human and guinea pig lung. Labeling was particularly dense over submucosal glands in intrapulmonary bronchi of human. Airways were also labeled, with epithelium having a higher grain density than smooth muscle. Labeling over smooth muscle was denser in small compared to large airways. Vascular smooth muscle was not labeled in either human and guinea pig. The alveolar walls were uniformly labeled in both species. The functional significance of pulmonary peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors remains to be determined.\r"

To learn about the relationship between phosphoinositide metabolism and the modulation of cardiac rhythm, we used phospholipase C to activate phosphoinositide hydrolysis in an alpha-1 receptor-independent fashion and determined whether this intervention modulated automaticity. We used standard microelectrode techniques to study automaticity in adult Purkinje fiber bundles, fluorescence microscopy to study fura-2 fluorescence in isolated Purkinje and ventricular myocytes and standard biochemical techniques to measure inositol phosphate production in ventricular myocytes. Phospholipase C increased Purkinje fiber automaticity, a process that was enhanced by 10 mM lithium (which had no effect alone) and suppressed by verapamil or ryanodine (both 10 microM). Superfusion with 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate phorbol ester, phospholipase D and A2, as well as L-alpha-phosphatidic acid, trypsin and D-myo-inositol-1-phosphate, D-myo-inositol-1,4-bisphosphate, IP3 and D-myo-inositol-1,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate did not affect automatic rate or transmembrane potentials. Biochemical studies of ventricular myocytes demonstrated a phospholipase C-induced increase in intracellular and extracellular IP3, D-myo-inositol-1,4-bisphosphate and D-myo-inositol-1-phosphate at 3 min, with the extracellular increase persisting thereafter. Fluorescence microscopy with fura-2 revealed that phospholipase C increased systolic-free calcium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

With the monoclonal antibodies OKIa (MHC Class II determinants), RFD1 and L25 (both specific for \"active\" human dendritic cells) we identified large numbers of dendritic cells. With the monoclonal antibody HECA 452 [specific for a putative adhesion molecule notably present on high endothelial venules (HEV)], a subset of dendritic cells could be detected. HECA-452 positive dendritic cells were found in 2 basic patterns: (1) associated with small lymphoid cell clusters in the neighborhood of vessels with flat, HECA-452 negative endothelium, (2) at the periphery of dense organoid lymphoid infiltrates, surrounding HECA-452 positive HEV-like vessels. Our data suggest that the influx of HECA-452, L25, RFD1 and MHC Class II positive dendritic cells is an early event in the development of the inflammatory infiltrate found in the rheumatoid synovial membrane. The formation of organoid lymphoplasmacellular infiltrates with high endothelial venules would be secondary to this event.\r"

The rate of cortisol catabolism obtained with the RA group was not significantly different from that obtained with the control group. The catabolism of cortisol by lymphocytes of the SLE group was significantly higher than both the control group (p less than 0.05) and the RA group (p less than 0.01). A significant correlation was demonstrated between the SLE disease activity index and rates of cortisol catabolism attained by lymphocytes of SLE patients (p less than 0.001).\r"

Eleven of the 12 patients with SLE were tested for aCL and all but one was positive. Most of them (n = 8) had both IgG and IgM isotype aCL. The one who was negative had had a positive VDRL and prolonged APTT 15 months earlier, coinciding with the episode of transverse myelitis. One patient died before she was tested for aCL but she also had a false positive VDRL. Thus, all 12 patients with SLE with transverse myelitis had evidence of aPLA.

  ".W": "From examination of the articular tissue of 35 animals from the Caribbean Primate Research Centre, we identified the epidemiological and histomorphometric features of the spontaneous osteoarthritis (OA) that affects the free-ranging rhesus macaques. The frequency of this disease increases with aging, and in females, with increased parity. Histological and morphological studies demonstrate that as in humans, the disease is characterized by persistence of the chondrocyte density typified by the cartilage of young animals. Owing to its epidemiologic and histologic resemblance to the disease in man, we conclude that degenerative arthritis affecting rhesus macaques provides a useful model for the study of factors contributing to the pathogenesis of OA.\r"

A cerebral angiogram revealed widespread irregular areas of narrowing and dilatation, highly suggestive of vasculitis. The hypertension was treated successfully. A repeat angiogram 9 days later was almost completely normal. As this course is inconsistent with isolated cerebral vasculitis, and because the angiogram normalized with antihypertensive therapy, it is likely that the angiographic findings were secondary to hypertension. Experimental data in fact show that acute hypertension can produce areas of cerebrovascular spasm and dilatation. Recognition that angiographic findings suggestive of cerebral vasculitis are nonspecific and may be due to hypertension should prevent unnecessary treatment for vasculitis in such patients.\r"

  ".W": "Females in western societies have higher plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) than males. The difference in plasma lipids between the sexes is believed to contribute to differences in risk of heart disease. The evidence reviewed here demonstrates that plasma levels of HDL-C are also associated with factors influencing risk of breast cancer, a leading cause of death in women in western societies. Both breast cancer risk and HDL-C levels are higher in women who live in northern European countries than in those who live in Asia, in women who have never been pregnant compared with those who have, and in women of higher socioeconomic status. HDL-C levels are also affected by several other known or suspected factors in breast cancer risk; these include dietary fat intake, alcohol consumption, endogenous hormones, and premenopausal leanness. Increases in any of these factors are known to increase the level of HDL-C. Preliminary work has also shown HDL-C levels to be higher in subjects with mammographic dysplasia and a family history of breast cancer. Further, in serum-free culture systems, HDL-C appears to possess biologic properties that may be relevant to carcinogenesis. In other areas, evidence of a relationship between increased HDL-C levels and increased breast cancer risk is either incomplete or contradictory. These areas include obesity (in the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer), use of exogenous hormones (oral contraceptives or postmenopausal estrogens), and physical exercise. In addition, both elevated and depressed levels of HDL-C have been reported in women with breast cancer. Our findings suggest an association between high HDL-C levels and the epidemiology of breast cancer risk. We recommend additional studies of plasma lipid level as a possible risk factor for this disease.\r"

  ".U": "90189209\r", 
  ".W": "In a prospective phase I trial involving 35 patients with metastatic carcinoma, we tested a pharmacokinetic strategy for guiding dose escalation of the anthracycline 4'-iodo-4'-deoxydoxorubicin (I-DOX), a new analogue reported to be more potent and less toxic than doxorubicin. This strategy is potentially a safe and more rapid way of determining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of anticancer agents. Retrospective studies have shown that the total plasma drug exposure after a dose lethal to 10% of mice (LD10) is approximately equivalent to the total exposure produced in humans by the MTD. Thus, we intended to aim dose escalation in humans to achieve the area under the curve for I-DOX plasma concentration x time (AUC) equivalent to that produced in mice by an LD10. However, differences in I-DOX pharmacokinetics and metabolism in BDF1 mice and humans at the initial dose prevented immediate application of this strategy. Therefore, we escalated the dose by the modified Fibonacci scheme while investigating the pharmacology of I-DOX and its major plasma metabolite 4'-iodo-4'-deoxy-13-dihydrodoxorubicin (I-DOXOL). Plasma pharmacokinetics was characterized by rapid elimination and extensive metabolism of I-DOX to I-DOXOL. The ratio of I-DOXOL to I-DOX plasma AUC was 12.8 +/- 7.3 SD. The plasma pharmacokinetics of I-DOX and I-DOXOL were linear in the range of tested doses (2-90 mg/m2). The LD10 in mice was 6.8 mg/kg for I-DOXOL and 6 mg/kg for I-DOX, and the concentration of drug that inhibited by 50% (IC50) the growth of human granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM) was 80 nM for I-DOXOL and 50 nM for I-DOX. From these findings, we concluded that the toxic effects of I-DOX and I-DOXOL are equivalent and reset the pharmacokinetic target of escalation to the sum of I-DOX and I-DOXOL AUCs at I-DOX LD10. Then we safely applied pharmacokinetically guided escalation to determine the MTD (80 mg/m2). The plasma AUC of I-DOX and I-DOXOL at the human MTD is 71% of the AUC at mouse LD10. The only dose-limiting toxic effect was severe granulocytopenia.\r"

Cumulative doses to the thyroid were estimated to be of the order of 14 cGy and 5 cGy, respectively. Personal interviews and physical examinations were conducted, and measurements were made of serum thyroid hormone levels, urinary iodine concentrations, and chromosome aberrations in circulating lymphocytes. For all nodular disease, the prevalences in the high background and control areas were 9.5% and 9.3%, respectively. For single nodules, the prevalences were 7.4% in the high background area and 6.6% in the control area (prevalence ratio = 1.13; 95% confidence interval = 0.82-1.55). There were no differences found in serum levels of thyroid hormones. Women in the high background region, however, had significantly lower concentrations of urinary iodine and significantly higher frequencies of stable and unstable chromosome aberrations. Increased intake of allium vegetables such as garlic and onions was associated with a decreased risk of nodular disease, which seems consistent with experimental studies suggesting that allium compounds can inhibit tumor growth and proliferation. The prevalence of mild diffuse goiter was higher in the high background radiation region, perhaps related to a low dietary intake of iodine. These data suggest that continuous exposure to low-level radiation throughout life is unlikely to appreciably increase the risk of thyroid cancer. However, such exposure may cause chromosomal damage.\r"

We fed diets to mice and rats for 12 weeks beginning at 3 weeks of age. Hyperplasia developed in both sigmoid and ascending colon of mice and rats with lengthening of colonic crypts. Hyperproliferation developed in the sigmoid colon of mice and rats, and in the ascending colon of rats, with increased [3H]thymidine-labeling of epithelial cells. Thus, in colonic mucosa, the nutritional stress diet, which included risk factors of a Western-style diet, induced changes that occur in carcinogen-induced rodent models and in humans who are at increased risk for colonic neoplasia.\r"

One obstacle to effective use of this therapy is ignorance about the events that follow contact of the LAK cells with glioma tissue. We used multicellular spheroids grown from human glioma cell lines as targets to study, in vitro, the effect of LAK cells against three-dimensional glioma tissue. Here we describe the ultrastructural changes in spheroids of H-2 glioma cells incubated in pellets of LAK cells for up to 24 hours. In H-2 spheroids, cellular damage was not restricted to the effector cell-target cell (effector-target) contact; it extended farther, at least partly because of nonspecific changes in the spheroid micromilieu. Formation of cytoplasmic blebs, a characteristic effect of T cells, natural killer cells, and LAK cells on single target cells, also occurs in H-2 spheroids, and it is not limited to the effector-target contact area either. These findings suggest that LAK cells release membrane-damaging agents that remain active outside the effector-target area, in the micromilieu of H-2 spheroid tissue.\r"

Treatment with these agents resulted in early activation events similar to those observed in normal B cells. However, in contrast to their growth-promoting effect on normal human B lymphocytes, exposure to these phorbol esters induced profound growth inhibition of the three B-cell-derived lymphoma lines. Maximal inhibition was achieved within 24 hours of culture initiation and could be reversed if the phorbol ester was removed after 12, but not 20, hours in culture. Cell-cycle analysis of phorbol ester-treated lymphoma cells revealed a G1/S block in one line, whereas cells from the other two lines accumulated in G2/M. These data demonstrate that protein kinase C-binding phorbol esters can interrupt the cell cycle in two places in actively dividing human B-lymphoma cells. These findings may prove valuable with regard to potential therapy of human malignant lymphomas.\r"

Our analysis shows a consistent, statistically significant, positive association between breast cancer risk and saturated fat intake in postmenopausal women (relative risk for highest vs. lowest quintile, 1.46; P less than .0001). A consistent protective effect for a number of markers of fruit and vegetable intake was demonstrated; vitamin C intake had the most consistent and statistically significant inverse association with breast cancer risk (relative risk for highest vs. lowest quintile, 0.69; P less than .0001). If these dietary associations represent causality, the attributable risk (i.e., the percentage of breast cancers that might be prevented by dietary modification) in the North American population is estimated to be 24% for postmenopausal women and 16% for premenopausal women.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-three women with breast cancer were treated with a new 16-week dose-intense, chemotherapy regimen. Patients with operable breast cancer with 10 or more histologically positive axillary nodes were treated with this five-drug regimen that incorporated the concepts of weekly chemotherapy, sequential administration of antimetabolites, and continuous infusion of fluorouracil (5-FU). The chemotherapy regimen consisted of eight cycles (each of 2 wk duration) of 100 mg of cyclophosphamide/m2 orally on days 1-7, 40 mg of doxorubicin/m2 intravenous (IV) on day 1, 100 mg of methotrexate/m2 IV on day 1 with 10 mg of leucovorin rescue/m2 every 6 hours for six oral doses on day 2, 1 mg of vincristine IV on day 1, and 600 mg of 5-FU/m2 IV at hour 20 over 2 hours. A continuous infusion of 300 mg of 5-FU/m2 per day was given IV on days 8-9 of each 2-week cycle. The doses and schedule of drug administration were designed to minimize dosage reduction and treatment delay. At a median follow-up of 17 months, there have been eight relapses in the 53 patients. The actuarial 3-year disease-free survival is 80% (95% confidence interval, 62% to 90%). The major side effects were attributable to myelosuppression. Absolute neutrophil counts less than 250/microL were noted in 12 (23%) patients; seven patients (13%) required hospitalization for management of neutropenic fever. No treatment-related deaths occurred. Ninety-four percent of the planned doses were administered, and only 5% of the courses were delayed because of toxic reactions. The encouraging therapeutic data, manageable side effects, and our ability to deliver over 90% of the planned doses provide the rationale for a phase III comparison of this new dose-intense regimen and standard chemotherapy in patients with operable disease and positive axillary nodes.\r"

This study involved linkage of records of the almost 70,000 male farmers identified on the 1971 Census of Agriculture and the corresponding Census of Population to mortality records. Pesticide exposure indices for individual farm operators for the year 1970 were derived from the 1971 Census of Agriculture records. Although the cohort as a whole had no excess mortality for any specific causes of death, including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, significant dose-response relationships were noted between risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and acres sprayed in 1970 with herbicides, as well as with dollars spent on fuel and oil for farm purposes in 1970. Using Poisson regression modeling, we found that relative risks for the highest level of herbicide use (greater than or equal to 250 acres sprayed) and fuel purchased in 1970 (greater than or equal to $900) on farms less than 1,000 acres total area were 2.2 (95% confidence interval = 1.0-4.6) and 2.3 (95% confidence interval = 1.1-4.7), respectively.\r"

Bayes' theorem indicates that laboratory assays will be accurate in the prediction of clinical drug resistance in tumors with high overall response rates (e.g., previously untreated breast cancer) only when the assays are extremely (greater than 98%) specific for drug resistance. We developed a highly specific drug-resistance assay in which human tumor colonies were cultured in soft agar and drugs were tested at high concentrations for long exposure times. Coefficients for concentration x time exceeded those reported in contemporaneous studies by about 100-fold. We reviewed 450 correlations between assay results and clinical response over an 8-year period. Results were analyzed by subsets, including different tumor histologies, single agents, and drug combinations. Extreme drug resistance (an assay result greater than or equal to SD below the median) was identified with greater than 99% specificity. Only one of 127 patients with tumors showing extreme drug resistance responded to chemotherapy. This negligible posttest probability of response was independent of pretest (expected) probability of response. Once this population of patients with tumors showing extreme drug resistance had been identified, posttest response probabilities for the remaining cohorts of patients varied according to both assay results and pretest response probabilities, precisely according to predictions based on Bayes' theorem. This finding allowed the construction of a nomogram for determining assay-predicted probability of response.\r"

  ".W": "Binding of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) and steroid receptors was studied in cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of pituitaries from castrated rats, in rats subjected to acute (60 min) or short-term (4 days) estradiol (E2) treatment, and in diethylstilbestrol-induced pituitary tumors (DES-T). E2 receptors were primarily in nuclear extracts in all animals that were given estrogens, whereas cytosolic receptors were low to absent. Contrarily, castrated rats showed high quantities of cytoplasmic receptor but little in nuclear sites. The progestin receptor was induced only in 4-day E2-treated rats and in DES-T. cAMP binding was stimulated in cytosol from 4-day E2-treated rats and in DES-T, but a significant reduction in binding was also noted in nuclear extracts from DES-T. Scatchard analysis for the cytosolic cAMP-binding activity demonstrated a two-component system, and the increased cAMP binding obtained in DES-T seemed to be caused by an increase in the low-affinity, high-capacity binder [regulatory type II (RII) subunit of protein kinase]. Suggestion of the preferential estrogenic induction of RII was also obtained by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, which provided separation of RI and RII subunits. The results suggest that sustained estrogenization leads to induction of cytosolic cAMP-binding protein and increased levels of nuclear E2 receptor. In DES-T, this effect resulted in an inverse subcellular distribution of both binding proteins, which may be related to abnormal growth of the pituitary, as has been postulated for hormone-dependent mammary tumors.\r"

  ".W": "We have shown previously that fatty acid synthetase (FAS) is specifically induced by progestins in human breast cancer cell lines. To test the potential value of FAS as a clinical marker in breast diseases, we measured FAS expression in frozen sections of 22 benign and 27 malignant mammary tumors using in situ hybridization with the [35S]UTP alpha S-labeled FAS anti-sense mRNA. The hybridized RNA was quantified with an IMSTAR computerized image analyzer. We found FAS RNA in epithelial cells, but no labeling was detected in the connective tissue. In breast cancer, we found no correlation between FAS expression and estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor concentrations or status. However, the level of FAS was significantly (P less than .02) higher in premenopausal than in post-menopausal patients and increased with the grade of tumor differentiation (P less than .005 between the poorly and well-differentiated tumors). In benign mastopathies, high levels of FAS RNA were found in some cysts (mostly with apocrine metaplasia). In lobules, the FAS RNA level increased proportionally to the degree of proliferation determined by histological examination (P less than .015) and correlated with the H4 histone level measured in an adjacent section using in situ hybridization (r = 0.85, P less than .001). In ductal structures, a lower correlation (r = 0.64, P less than .01) was found between FAS and H4 RNA levels. We conclude that FAS RNA is overexpressed in some mammary tumors and may be useful in predicting high-risk mastopathies and less aggressive breast cancers.\r"

The cause of this resistance was investigated in a series of Chinese hamster ovary cell lines that had survived exposure to multiple lethal doses of radiation. These cell lines had increased levels of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), the multidrug-resistance-associated membrane glycoprotein. Consistent with the classic multidrug resistance phenotype, they exhibited cross-resistance to multiple drugs, as well as sensitivity to reversal of vincristine resistance by verapamil. However, the cell lines showed no change in their sensitivity to x rays. Pgp overexpression occurred in these cells, despite a lack of Pgp gene amplification or of significant alteration in Pgp messenger RNA levels. Although the cause of increased Pgp levels is not yet known, these data suggest a biological basis for the clinical problem of drug resistance that can occur in previously irradiated tumors.\r"

  ".W": "Undifferentiated carcinoma of nasopharyngeal type (UCNT) is a geographically endemic, Epstein-Barr virus-related carcinoma of epidermoid origin with reported 5-year survival rates of 15%-40% when treated with radiotherapy alone. Although UCNT can be well controlled locally by radiation therapy, in advanced nodal stage N3 [International Union Against Cancer-American Joint Committee on Cancer (UICC-AJCC, 1987)] the survival rate is below 20%, primarily because of metastatic spread in 80% of the fatalities. We report a pilot study of 41 patients with nonmetastatic, locoregionally advanced disease (85% of the patients had a nodal status greater than or equal to N2C-N3; 43% had T4 primaries), during which we used a combination of 100 mg of cisplatin/m2 on day 1, 15 mg of bleomycin by intravenous push and 12 mg/m2 by continuous infusion on days 1-5, and 70 mg of epirubicin/m2 on day 1 every 21 days for three cycles before definitive radiation therapy with 70 Gy for 7 weeks. Twenty-seven of 41 patients (66%; 95% confidence interval = 52.5%-80.5%) achieved a clinical complete response, and 40 of 41 (98%) had a major objective response after chemotherapy. Two deaths were treatment related, but side effects were moderate, and the overall treatment sequence was feasible. At the end of radiation therapy, all 39 assessable patients were in complete response, with a median follow-up of 21+ months (greater than 10-greater than 31); 33 (80%) patients had no evidence of disease. We believe that such a complete response rate in a high-volume disease with the use of combined modality treatment indicates a therapeutic gain in UCNT. Researchers performing a multicenter international controlled trial will test this hypothesis and compare local control, disease-free, and overall survival of the therapeutic sequence presented here with radiotherapy alone.\r"

Although there was no difference in the mean Trauma Score in the patients with primary repair in the two time periods, the Injury Severity Score (mean +/- sd) in the patients without colostomy in the later periods was significantly higher (17.8 +/- 2.1 vs. 20.2 +/- 5.1) (p less than 0.001). No patient suffered because of the increased incidence of primary repairs. These patients had five abdominal abscesses and only one leak, whereas the patients with colostomy had 15 intraperitoneal abscesses. Because of the safety when primary repair is performed, more liberal use of primary colonic repair following penetrating trauma is warranted.\r"

Therefore we reviewed the charts of 90 consecutive patients admitted to the University of Washington Burn Center between 1980 and 1986 looking at neurologic consequences. Electric injuries accounted for 4% of 2,305 admissions. The mean age was 31 +/- 13 years, total body surface area involved (TBSA), 6 +/- 11%, and length of stay, 13 +/- 20 days. There were 82 males and eight females. There were four deaths, for a mortality rate of 4%. Fourteen patients had 18 amputations. Twenty-two patients sustained low-voltage injury; 50% had immediate neurologic symptoms which resolved in nine of 11 patients. Eleven patients (50%) were asymptomatic. Sixty-four patients sustained high-voltage injury and 33% were asymptomatic. Forty-three patients (67%) had immediate central and/or peripheral neurologic symptoms. Loss of consciousness accounted for the largest fraction of CNS sequelae in the high-voltage group (45%). Twenty-three patients (79%) recovered consciousness before arrival at the hospital. Six patients remained comatose, three died, and three awoke but had neurologic sequelae. Twenty-two patients in the high-voltage group had one or more acute peripheral neuropathies. Sixty-four per cent of these neuropathies resolved or improved. Five patients had transient initial paralysis, but there were no delayed spinal cord symptoms. Eleven patients developed one or more delayed peripheral neuropathies. Half of these delayed neuropathies resolved or improved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The goal of the current study was to examine the effects of the local (BF) and systemic (burn serum or plasma) burn microenvironment on PMN activation as assessed by complement receptor expression and morphology. Induction of CR1 (C3b) and CR3 (iC3b) receptor expression of normal PMNs after incubation in medium, BF, or plasma (serum) from healthy volunteers or burned patients was measured using monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry. BF (10% v/v, 37 degrees C) induced 25% more CR1 receptor expression than control or burn plasma (p less than 0.05), while the levels of CR3 expression of PMNs incubated in BF (10% or 80% v/v at 37 degrees C) was more than 300% that found when the PMNs were incubated in medium, burn, or patient plasma (p less than 0.05). The electron microscopic appearance of PMNs incubated in these fluids documented that degranulation was greater when cells were incubated in BF than medium, control, or patient plasma. These results indicate that PMN activation (CR1 and CR3 expression) is greater in cells exposed to the local (BF) than the systemic (plasma) humoral microenvironment shortly after thermal injury.\r"

These epidermal cell sheets were cultivated according to the feeder layer technique as described by Rheinwald and Green. After dispase treatment and detachment from the culture vessel, the cell sheets, mounted on a polyamide mesh, were ready for grafting. Patients with wounds excised at an early stage, prepared with human cadaver allografts or synthetic dressings, showed a significantly better graft take than nonexcised, chronic granulating wounds which were grafted at a later stage (47% versus 15%; p less than 0.002). Sandwich treatment of expanded mesh autografts and cultured autograft overlay did not improve the graft take, although in some cases wound healing was accelerated. The graft take was inversely correlated with the age of the patient (p = 0.01), and showed a weak inverse correlation with the day of first (and subsequent) culture grafting (p = 0.07). Wound infection was the main cause of graft failure. Up to 4 years after grafting, the grafted areas showed continued stability and the regenerated skin became supple, smooth, and pliable. Hypertrophic scar formation was less than observed in comparable areas treated with meshed grafts. Wound contraction occurred approximately to the same extent as in split-thickness skin grafts. We emphasize that by a better control of wound infection the graft take, also in secondary-stage procedures, can significantly improve.\r"

  ".W": "Pigs were used for studies of effects on the peripheral nervous tissue of pressure waves induced by impact and passage through the left thigh of high-energy missiles. The short-lasting pressure waves were demonstrated to move close to the speed of sound and to have a spectrum of high frequencies and large amplitudes. The sciatic nerve in the contralateral leg showed no hemorrhage or major deformation. Both immediately after the missile impact and after 48 hr the myelin sheaths in the contralateral sciatic nerve showed deformation. Myelin was bulging into the axon, dislocating the axoplasm. The nodes of Ranvier could be exposed to an increased extent. Electron microscopic examination revealed decreased number of microtubules immediately after the trauma, persisting even after 48 hr in the largest axon. Schwann cells showed, especially after 48 hr, signs of damage and swelling. Similar changes, although less extensive, were noticed in the phrenic nerves as well as in unmyelinated axons in both sciatic and phrenic nerves. It is concluded that a high-energy missile hit in the thigh of a pig, caused structurally demonstrable dislocations of myelin sheaths, and disarrangement of cytoskeleton and endoplasmic reticulum in axons as well as other signs of damage. The changes may interfere with the normal functions of peripheral and autonomic nerves.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of the present study was to investigate if distant effects could be detected within the central nervous system after impact of a high-energy missile in the left thigh of young pigs. Pressure transducers implanted in various parts of the body of the animal, including the brain, recorded a short-lasting burst of oscillating pressure waves with high frequencies and large amplitudes, traversing the body tissue with a velocity of about that of sound in water (1,460 m/s). The distance between the point of impact and the brain and cervical spinal cord is in the range of 0.5 m. Macroscopic examination revealed that there was no gross brain tissue disruption or visible blood-brain barrier dysfunction. Light microscopic examination demonstrated myelin invaginations in the largest axons and shrinkage of axoplasm. Electron microscopic examination revealed a reduction in the number of microtubules, especially in the larger axons in the brainstem. Disintegration of Nissl substance, i.e., chromatolysis, was noticed after 48 hr in many Purkinje nerve cells in the cerebellum, concomitantly with the appearance of an increased frequency of association between lamellar bodies and mitochondria. Changes could also be observed in the cervical spinal cord and, at reduced frequency and extent, in the optic nerve and in other parts of the brain. These effects were evident within a few minutes after the trauma and persisted even 48 hr after the extremity injury. It is concluded that distant effects, likely to be caused by the oscillating high-frequency pressure waves, appear in the central nervous system after a high-energy missile extremity impact.\r"

  ".U": "90189254\r", 
  ".W": "In limb injuries (amputation, laceration injuries, or compartment syndrome), a circulatory insufficiency with a total or subtotal ischemia may occur and jeopardize the result of reconstructive surgery. Transcutaneous oxygen monitoring has been shown to reflect tissue perfusion and has been advocated to predict the final outcome of major vascular trauma of the limb. Unfortunately, in normal atmospheric conditions, this test is not sufficiently discriminative; we evaluate the effect of hyperbaric oxygen on the efficiency of this test. 23 patients with major vascular trauma of the limbs were evaluated by clinical examination and transcutaneous oxygen pressure (PTCO2) measurements. Sixteen had arterial repair and seven had clinical evidence of peripheral ischemia without an arterial lesion. In normal air, the transcutaneous oxygen values in the traumatized limb, of these 23 patients, were significantly lower than in the nontraumatized limb. But neither the absolute PTCO2 value nor the ratio between the traumatized limb's PTCO2 and that of the nontraumatized one can predict the final outcome (amputation). In hyperbaric oxygen (2.5 ATA), this ratio is significantly higher in the group where the surgery will succeed than in the group where final amputation will be needed (81.2 +/- 26.0 vs. 15.2 +/- 13.1; p less than 0.01). The overall sensitivity and specificity of prediction of the limb's final outcome when the bilateral PTCO2 ratio in 2.5 ATA pure oxygen is less than 0.40, are 100% and 94%, respectively. But what is perhaps more interesting is that, when considering a ratio value of less than 0.20, amputation can be predicted with a 100% true predictive value.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Seventy-two patients were involved in traffic accidents; 44 of them were victims of motorcycle accidents. Twenty patients sustained open fractures. Fifty patients had associated injuries, 41 of them had multiple fractures. There were 13 patients referred for management of complications. The followup periods ranged from 1 to 10 years (4.6 years). Seventy-nine patients had excellent/good results. Eighty-one patients achieved sound union. Stiffness of knee, nonunion, delayed union, and infection were the major complications. Careful selection of the patients, adherence to the principles of anatomic reduction and rigid fixation, and early mobilization are essential for satisfactory outcomes.\r"

  ".W": "Over an 8-year period, 49 patients were treated for iliac vein injuries with 25 (51%) deaths. The iliac vein injuries and their mortality rates (MR) were: common iliac vein--40% (6/15), internal iliac vein--65% (9/14), external iliac vein--29% (4/14), and two or more iliac veins--100% (6/6). This MR (51%) was much higher than those (18% to 38%) found in other series. The factors associated with this significantly increased MR were: Trauma Score less than 11 (MR = 71% or 24/35), initial OR systolic BP less than 70 mm Hg (MR = 89% or 15/17), ISS greater than 28 (MR = 65% or 24/37), 10 or more units of blood in the first 24 hours (MR = 65% or 22/34), and no obtainable BP on admission to the ED (MR = 65% or 15/22). Although the overall calculated probability of survival (Ps) by TRISS methodology was 0.43, several deaths might have been prevented by more complete resuscitation including restoration of core temperature above 34 degrees or 35 degrees C, and by packing the pelvis and closing rather than allowing three or more separate additional hypotensive episodes to occur while attempting definitive control of bleeding vessels.\r"

This study was designed to evaluate the results of a large series of autogenous interposition vein grafts used for arterial trauma. The charts of 191 patients with 192 arterial injuries repaired with an autogenous vein graft were reviewed. Specific areas of interest included graft-related complications such as thrombosis, infection, rupture, incidence of amputation, and mortality. Seventy-six per cent of the injuries were due to penetrating trauma. Forty-five per cent involved the upper and 51% the lower extremity. Shock (B. P. less than 80) occurred in one third of the patients. There were 23 (12%) graft-related complications. Sixteen (8.3%) of the grafts thrombosed. Three of these patients required an amputation and one a nephrectomy. Seven grafts (3.6%) became infected; all seven eventually ruptured. Five of these patients required an amputation. Eighteen patients (9.4%) required amputation; however, only eight (4.2%) of these cases were graft related. One patient died from non-graft-related multiple organ failure, establishing a mortality rate of 0.5%. Based on the data reported in this series, it is concluded that autogenous grafts continue to provide a safe, readily accessible, and effective means by which selected arterial injuries can be repaired.\r"

The objectives of this study were to determine the percentage of chemically dependent adolescent women in a residential treatment center at risk for rubella infection and to correlate their immune status with history of immunization. Although only one individual was reported as not having been vaccinated for rubella, 12.4% of the 129 subjects were found to be nonimmune by titer. No statistical relationship was found between self- or parent-reported immunization status and actual titer finding. Of the 16 women found to be not immune, only 56% were successfully vaccinated. Patient history appears to be of little value in establishing immunization status in this population. We recommend vaccination of young women in residential treatment centers who do not have documented histories of vaccination.\r"

Two patients (4%) eventually required an open operation: 1 required ureterolithotomy for a large impacted stone overlying the bony pelvis after a ureteroscope could not be advanced to this level and 1 had a good initial result with the laser but a persistent ureteral stricture developed and he required ureteroureterostomy 4 months later. Both open procedures were necessitated by mid ureteral stones, and the ureteral stricture was believed to be related to ureteroscopy and the impacted nature of the stone, rather than any damage by the laser probe.\r"

  ".W": "The pathogenesis of interstitial cystitis currently is unknown. A possible etiology is that the transitional epithelium is defective, leading to molecular leaks that initiate the disease complex. An important surface defense mechanism is the glycosaminoglycans or polysaccharides that line the bladder epithelium and act as a nonspecific antiadherence factor blocking access of bacteria, microcrystals, proteins and ions to the underlying transitional cells. We examined the excretion of urinary macromolecular uronic acid and glycosaminoglycans in normal individuals and those with interstitial cystitis. A total of 37 controls had a mean macromolecular uronic acid level of 56 nmol. per mg. creatinine, compared to 40.2 nmol. per mg. creatinine in 43 patients with active disease (differences were significant, p equals 0.03). The median excretions of glycosaminoglycan uronate for controls and patients were 15.1 and 11.1 nmol. per mg. creatinine, respectively. (There was an over-all tendency to decrease excretion in patients with a p value of 0.06.) Specimens obtained at cystoscopy from patients with active interstitial cystitis had ureteral macromolecular uronic acid levels of 40.5 nmol. uronate per mg. creatinine compared to 43.6 nmol. uronate per mg. creatinine from the bladder. Interstitial cystitis patients had 16.0 nmol. glycosaminoglycan uronate per mg. creatinine compared to 14.6 nmol. per mg. creatinine in normal controls. Neither of these differences was statistically significant. It would appear that there is a tendency to lower macromolecular uronic acid and polysaccharide excretion in individuals afflicted with this syndrome.\r"

No correlation was found among the presence of neuron specific enolase or human chorionic gonadotropin and T category, deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy, percentage of cells in the S phase, presence of metastatic disease or response to therapy. The prognosis for patients with muscle invasive disease and tumors positive for neuron specific enolase or human chorionic gonadotropin was similar to that for patients with tumors negative for these substances. When a possible new marker or prognostic factor is evaluated, it is important to investigate whether the new marker adds information on prognosis to what already is known by established standard methods. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical importance of human chorionic gonadotropin (and neuron specific enolase) as a marker in urothelial cancer with regard to prognosis and response to therapy.\r"

Subsequent progression of disease (muscle infiltration, metastasis or local progression) occurred in 13 patients (46%). Of the 15 patients (54%) without progression 10 (36%) had a complete response and 5 (33%) had new tumors, and they were rendered free of disease after transurethral resection. The median duration of response to course 1 of bacillus Calmette-Guerin was shorter for patients with disease progression after course 2 than for those with no progression (15 and 27 months, respectively, p equals 0.05). The median followup after course 2 was 31.2 months (range 15.6 to 56.4 months). The median interval between courses 1 and 2 of intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin was 21.6 months (range 3.6 to 78.8 months). The interval from course 2 of bacillus Calmette-Guerin to progression correlated with the duration of response to course 1 of treatment (p equals 0.01).

Mitoxantrone (5 to 10.5 mg.) was instilled in the bladder via catheter and was left in situ for 2 hours. Each patient received 6 treatments at 1-week intervals. Pharmacology studies were conducted in a subset of consenting patients. Dysuria, urinary frequency and hematuria were dose-limiting at 10 to 10.5 mg., the dose recommended for our phase 2 studies. One patient treated with 7.5 mg. mitoxantrone had bladder contracture after severe bladder injury caused by the drug. The interval free of recurrence increased in 5 of 8 patients treated with 10 to 10.5 mg. mitoxantrone and in 6 of 19 treated at lower dose levels. One patient who had residual evaluable tumor in the bladder at treatment experienced a complete remission for 16 months. Only 1 of 18 patients who underwent pharmacology studies had any mitoxantrone detectable in the blood after intravesical administration. This patient had severe irritative symptoms at treatment. No systemic toxicity was noted in any patient. Of the mitoxantrone instilled into the bladder 33 to 100% (mean 75%) was recovered in the specimen voided at the end of treatment. In summary, intravesical mitoxantrone is reasonably well tolerated and should be studied further at a dose of 10 mg. per week for 6 weeks. Caution should be exercised, since bladder contracture was seen in 1 patient. Systemic absorption and toxicity are negligible.\r"

  ".W": "Based upon a large body of experimental and clinical data, it is evident that multiple malignant events are necessary for a normal cell to give rise to a fully malignant cancer cell. A critical issue with regard to human prostatic carcinogenesis is the clinical significance of the large number of cancers that are present histologically in the elderly male prostate gland. A possibility is that these histological prostate cancers already have undergone all of the malignant events necessary to produce clinically manifest cancer and, thus, only further tumor growth is required to produce a clinical tumor. Alternatively, these histological cancers may have undergone some but not all of the events necessary to produce clinical disease and, therefore, despite host longevity the cancer will remain clinically silent as long as no further malignant changes occur. This issue has importance clinically with respect to the diagnosis, therapy and possible prevention of prostatic cancer. Clinical observations and the mathematical relationship between prostate cancer prevalence and host age (time) support the fact that, in addition to growth, histological prostate cancer requires further malignant events to produce clinical disease. A better understanding of the events involved in prostate cancer development will be necessary to have a greater impact on this disease in the future.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the usefulness of serum prostate specific antigen in the preoperative staging of prostate cancer we examined tumor volume and differentiation, as well as benign prostatic hyperplasia volume to determine their influence on serum antigen levels. Serum prostate specific antigen was measured in 350 men with clinically localized prostate cancer and preoperatively in 72 men with documented benign prostatic hyperplasia. Although the mean antigen levels increased with advancing pathological stage, the usefulness of prostate specific antigen to predict pathological stage for an individual patient was limited: 1 of 102 men (0.9%) with prostate specific antigen levels of less than 2.8 ng./ml. had positive lymph nodes and 5 of 5 men with levels of greater than 100 ng./ml. had either seminal vesicle or lymph node involvement. However, for the majority of men (greater than 70%) with prostate specific antigen values between these 2 extremes the antigen levels did not accurately predict pathological stage. Because serum prostate specific antigen levels correlated with morphometrically determined tumor volume (r equals 0.535, p less than 0.01) they should, in fact, be predictive of pathological stage. However, most men with prostate cancer also have varying degrees of benign prostatic hyperplasia tissue in the gland producing prostate specific antigen. We have found that serum prostate specific antigen does not correlate with the volume of benign hyperplasia within the gland (r equals 0.21, p greater than 0.05). In addition, immunohistochemical studies have suggested that the lack of correlation between pathological stage and serum prostate specific antigen might be explained by a decrease in the production of antigen with increasing histological grade. Our findings of a negative correlation (r equals -0.37, p less than 0.01) between serum prostate specific antigen levels and Gleason score adjusted for tumor volume confirmed this suggestion. Consequently, serum prostate specific antigen levels do not reflect tumor burden and pathological stage accurately in individual patients for 2 reasons: 1) the unpredictable contribution from the benign prostatic hyperplasia component of the gland and 2) the decreasing production of prostate specific antigen by higher grade lesions as tumor volume increases.\r"

The risk factors for anastomotic stricture and the treatment outcome in these patients were analyzed. Excessive intraoperative blood loss, extravasation of urine at the anastomotic site and a prior transurethral prostatic operation significantly contributed to the development of stricture. More than half of the patients did not respond to simple dilation alone. Cold knife incision of the stricture by itself was effective in only 62% of the patients. The remaining patients required periodic dilation to maintain an adequate urine flow. Incision of the stricture with electrocautery resulted in urinary incontinence in all patients.\r"

Of the 40 patients with bladder exstrophy 8 had undergone ureterosigmoidostomy after failure of other types of urinary tract reconstruction (6 had upper tract dilatation before ureterosigmoidostomy). Three patients with previously damaged upper urinary tracts required early postoperative conversion because of severely increasing kidney dilatation. Three other patients required conversion after a mean of 10 years to preserve kidney function. One patient died after 16 years of a cause not related to ureterosigmoidostomy. The remaining 39 patients were alive with a functioning ureterosigmoidostomy after a mean followup of 14.7 years. The daytime continence rate was 97.4% (38 of 39 patients) and the complete continence rate was 92.3% (36 of 39).

The unique features of the operation are the use of a flap of preputial skin to construct the vestibule and the anterior vaginal wall, and the universal use of the urogenital sinus to form the distal urethra, which avoids creation of female hypospadias. The new introitus is ample and, because there is no cut-back of the urogenital sinus, we avoid accidental incision of the urethral sphincter and the potential for urinary incontinence. There is no pull-through of the vagina because the introitus is created by mobilization of anterior and posterior skin flaps. The clitoris and the neourethra are exteriorized through the folded preputial skin, which simulates the normal female anatomy. The cosmetic and functional results in 9 children who have undergone this procedure have been excellent.\r"

In both types of preparation, contractions elicited by K+, carbachol or electrical field stimulation were depressed in the presence of the K(+)-channel openers. Responses induced by K+ or electrical stimulation were more reduced in the hypertrophied than in the normal detrusor. Both K(+)-channel openers increased the efflux of 86Rb+ in a concentration-dependent way and this increase was similar in normal and hypertrophied detrusor.

In preparations pretreated with atropine, the response to electrical field stimulation was completely abolished by nifedipine. The converse was also true; in preparations pretreated with nifedipine the response was fully blocked by atropine. The nifedipine-resistant response was greatly potentiated by the anticholinesterase eserine. The blocking action of nifedipine on motor transmission was partially antagonised by raising Ca2(+)-concentration. Acetylcholine concentration-response curve was shifted to the right by nifedipine. It is concluded that the non-cholinergic motor neurotransmitter evokes contraction of the rat detrusor smooth muscle by activating external Ca2(+)-transport channels whereas the cholinergic contraction is mediated partly or wholly by alternative mechanisms.\r"

The cat has been used extensively for in-vivo studies of spinal and supra-spinal micturition reflexes. In contrast, the rabbit has been used extensively for the in-vitro study of bladder function. In order to determine if the results obtained using one species can be applied to another, we have compared the in-vitro physiology and pharmacology of the cat and rabbit bladder using isolated strips and whole bladder preparations. The results can be summarized as follows: 1) The cat displays significant spontaneous activity during in-vitro cystometry, but the rabbit shows no such activity (whole bladder studies). 2) Although the bladder weights of the cat and rabbit are similar, the rabbit bladder has a capacity three times that of the cat. 3) The maximal response to field stimulation was obtained at one gram of passive tension for the rabbit isolated strips, whereas five grams of passive tension was required for the cat strips. 4) Atropine inhibited the response of isolated strips of cat bladder to field stimulation by approximately 13% whereas the response of rabbit bladder strips was inhibited by approximately 45%. 5) The magnitude of the response of rabbit bladder strips to ATP was similar to the response to field stimulation in the presence of atropine; the response of cat bladder strips to ATP was only 20% of the response of that of the rabbit bladder strips, and approximately 10% of the response of the cat strips to field stimulation in the presence of atropine. 6) Field stimulation produced a 10fold greater rise in intravesical pressure in the cat isolated bladder than in the isolated rabbit bladder; in response to bethanechol, the cat bladder generated a 6-fold greater response than the rabbit bladder. It is clear that the in-vitro pharmacological responses of the cat urinary bladder are qualitatively and quantitatively different from that of the rabbit bladder.\r"

Tubules were perifused with Minimum Essential Medium containing 3H-testosterone or 3H-sucrose. 14C-polyethyleneglycol was included in the perifusion fluid as a marker for contamination of intraluminal fluid by interstitial fluid. Radioactivity of isotopes in perifusion and intraluminal fluids was determined at one and two hours after perifusion and the percentage of peritubular isotopes appearing in intraluminal fluid was determined. Net entry of 3H-sucrose into the seminiferous and epididymal tubules was significantly reduced. Proluminal movement of 3H-androgen across the seminiferous epithelium was also restricted. In contrast, intraluminal 3H-androgen concentrations in caput epididymal fluid were 200 to 300% of those in peritubular fluid at both one and two hours after perifusion. Similar results were found in the corpus epididymidis. 3H-androgen concentrations in cauda epididymal fluid were approximately 125% of peritubular isotope concentrations. The exact mechanism underlying this uphill proluminal movement of 3H-androgen into the rat epididymal lumen remains to be elucidated.\r"

Both fragment stones by producing a plasma-mediated shockwave. Recently, a plasma shield consisting of a hollow spring and a metal end cap has been described for use with the laser and EHL devices in an attempt to minimize tissue damage without adversely affecting stone fragmentation rates. The tissue effects produced by a pulsed dye laser and an EHL device with and without plasma shields were examined and compared using rabbit urinary bladders. If blood was present, the unshielded laser perforated the bladder wall in two pulses. However, in the absence of blood, over 100 pulses were needed for the laser to perforate the bladder. A mean of six pulses were required to perforate the bladder wall with a shielded laser. The unshielded EHL perforated the bladder wall in two pulses, whereas, the shielded EHL required a mean of 35 pulses. Microscopically, areas of exposure revealed hemorrhage and tissue ablation. We conclude that all devices examined can produce significant tissue damage when discharged directly onto bladder epithelium.\r"

When cultured baboon aortic endothelial cells were incubated with segments of freshly endarterectomized baboon aorta for 20 minutes in vitro, 3.8 x 10(5) endothelial cells/cm2 became attached. The endarterectomized surface treated with endothelial cells showed the presence of rounded, unspread endothelial cells with intervening bare areas of vascular media. Platelet deposition onto the endothelial cell--treated surface during exposure to blood under high flow conditions for 1 hour in vivo was markedly reduced by the attached but unspread endothelial cells. Moreover, these attached endothelial cells underwent spreading on the endarterectomized surface in the presence of high shear blood flow to form a confluent endothelial monolayer at the end of 1 hour. Thus acutely attached cultured endothelial cells form a durable thromboresistant monolayer on surgically denuded vascular surfaces during exposure to arterial blood flow.\r"

Ages ranged from 8 to 81 years (median, 38 years). Eight patients had superior vena cava syndrome (benign, six; malignant, two). Two other patients had membranous occlusion of the inferior vena cava; four had iliocaval venous thrombosis; one had excision of the iliac veins for pelvic neurilemmoma; and one had inferior vena cava injury during orthotopic liver transplantation. The superior vena cava was reconstructed with spiral saphenous vein grafts in five patients and with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene in three. One spiral saphenous vein graft and one expanded polytetrafluoroethylene graft required revision; seven of the eight grafts were patent at follow-up, but one bifurcated spiral saphenous vein graft occluded at 3 months. The inferior vena cava and its tributaries were reconstructed with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene in five patients, spiral saphenous vein graft in two, and Dacron in one. At follow-up four of the expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts were patent. In contrast, one of the spiral saphenous vein grafts was occluded, and results of imaging studies of the other were inconclusive. Three of the five expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts had a concomitant temporary arteriovenous fistula at the groin; two had documented patency at follow-up. At the present time, spiral saphenous vein graft is our first choice for superior vena cava replacement. However, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts are good alternatives and in the abdomen appear to perform better than spiral saphenous vein graft. These clinical results encourage us to perform further caval grafting in selected patients.\r"

Seventy-two 4F Becton-Dickinson, Edwards, Electro-Catheter, and Shiley catheters were studied. In vitro studies of penetration forces demonstrated that the forces required for arterial puncture were greatest for Shiley (295 +/- 22 gm) and least for Edwards catheter tips (217 +/- 11 gm) (p less than 0.05). This indicates that the Shiley catheter is least likely to puncture vessels in patients. Studies of balloon eccentricity showed that none of the balloons distended with excessive eccentricity. Studies of balloon emptying time demonstrated that the silicon Becton-Dickinson balloon required more than two times as long (5.7 +/- 1.2 seconds) as all other balloons to empty. Balloon emptying time reflects the ability of the surgeon to rapidly adapt the balloon to changing vessel diameter in patients. Shear forces were studied in cylindrical segments of arteries in vitro. Initial shear forces were significantly different among all catheters, Becton-Dickinson greater than Edwards greater than Shiley greater than Electro-Catheter (p less than 0.05). In contrast, during catheter withdrawal dynamic shear forces were similar among the four brands of catheters. Balloon embolectomies were performed in vivo in the common carotid and common femoral arteries in 18 anesthetized dogs. Histologic examinations of the vessels exposed to 50, 100, and 200 gm shear forces showed that myointimal hyperplasia increased with rising shear forces for all catheters (p less than 0.05), but that there were no differences in the degree of myointimal hyperplasia elicited by the different brands of catheters.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The most common patterns were isolated reflux in the superficial femoral vein (51%), and combined reflux in the superficial femoral and the deep femoral veins (44%). Isolated deep femoral vein reflux occurred in 5%. As the degree of reflux in this vein varied considerably, a grading system for classification of deep femoral vein reflux was proposed. Depending on variations in the deep femoral vein anatomy, four different patterns could be distinguished. This study demonstrated that contrast filling of the deep femoral vein during ascending phlebography may indicate the presence of reflux in this vein. Complete visualization of the deep femoral vein is a new diagnostic sign that strongly correlates (p less than 0.001) with reflux in the deep femoral vein. The mean number of valves in the superficial femoral vein was reduced with increasing degree of reflux compared with a reference group consisting of 41 extremities without reflux. The diameter of the popliteal vein was significantly increased in the presence of pathologic reflux, which may indicate that vein wall dilation is a major cause of primary nonthrombotic deep venous incompetence.\r"

Six patients with an infrarenal dissection were treated by replacement of the aorta with a Dacron prothesis, and one patient with an suprarenal dissection was treated conservatively. With a mean follow-up of 3 years, all patients were alive and free of symptoms. These results favor graft replacement in case of infrarenal aortic dissection and more selective surgical indications in suprarenal aortic dissection.\r"

The other limb was sham-seeded with culture medium only. The effect of seeding was studied by use of indium 111 radiolabeled platelets and external gamma camera scanning at 1, 4, and 12 months after surgery. No complications ascribable to the seeding procedure were seen. During the first year after surgery a gradual decrease in platelet accumulation occurred over the whole vascular prosthesis. At all time points studied the seeded graft limbs exhibited significantly less deposition of radiolabeled platelets than did control limbs. The observed difference in platelet accumulation on autologous endothelial seeding-treated graft segments merits further investigation of this technique in humans.\r"

The interstitial pressure was recorded with a bioelectronic strain-guage pressure monitor with the patient in the horizontal position with complete muscle relaxation.

Results demonstrate the following: (1) Primary varicose veins (an exclusively epifascial abnormality) were consistently associated with an increased resting interstitial pressure of the subfascial tissues in the supramalleolar area of the leg. (b) The subfascial resting interstitial pressure was elevated in all stages of varicose veins, even those with short duration of the disease and with no symptoms at all. (c) In all three groups there was a significant increase in the subfascial interstitial pressure between the affected and contralateral extremity. In patients with trophic changes (group III) this increase was significantly higher than in the remaining groups, although there was no significant difference between the increased pressure of the remaining groups (groups I & II).\r"

In search of a possible biochemical explanation of the low degree of atherosclerosis in the internal mammary artery we compared the chemical compositions of human internal mammary artery and saphenous vein obtained from 37 patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery. The levels of esterified cholesterol and free cholesterol were higher in the internal mammary artery than in the saphenous vein (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.01, respectively), but lower than the levels reported in previous studies for coronary arteries. The amount of collagen was higher in the saphenous vein (p less than 0.001). Heparan sulfate was the major glycosaminoglycan fraction in the internal mammary artery, probably reflecting the higher cellularity and thicker media in the arterial rather than in the venous tissue. The level of dermatan sulfate was higher (p less than 0.001) in the saphenous vein than in the internal mammary artery. This difference is in a direction that could favor atherogenesis in the saphenous vein graft.\r"

Herein we report the cerebrospinal fluid and hemodynamic alterations that occurred in 11 patients who had 30 mg of a specially prepared papaverine hydrochloride 10% dextrose solution injected before aortic cross-clamping and also had cerebrospinal fluid drainage. A mean of 26.6 ml (SD +/- 7.1 ml) was drained before and 34.6 ml (SD +/- 24.1 ml) was drained during aortic cross-clamping. The cerebrospinal fluid pressure increased significantly with anesthetic induction (p less than 0.03), during the period between anesthetic induction and cerebrospinal fluid drainage (p less than 0.005), and with aortic cross-clamping (p less than 0.05). These cerebrospinal fluid pressure alterations were similar to central venous pressure increases with a significant linear correlation between cerebral spinal fluid pressure and central venous pressure before anesthetic induction (r2 = 0.81, p less than 0.005), and both before (r2 = 0.94, p less than 0.005) and after (r2 = 0.74, p less than 0.005) aortic cross-clamping. As expected, cerebrospinal fluid pressure was significantly reduced by cerebrospinal fluid drainage before aortic cross-clamping (p less than 0.001). The administration of intrathecal papaverine had no significant effect on mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, cerebrospinal fluid pressure, nor the pH of cerebrospinal fluid. Neither were there any complications noted related to the technique. All the patients survived, and no new immediate postoperative paraparesis or paraplegia occurred.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Two patients had acute rupture of the aneurysm, and at operation chronic contained rupture was found along with the recent hemorrhage. One patient died after surgery. The remaining patients underwent successful resection with long-term survival and regression of symptoms. Consideration of sealed abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture should be included when examining elderly patients with history of unexplained back pain or femoral neuropathy.

For this purpose photoplethysmographic recovery times were assessed from three different parts of the lower leg, that is, anterior midcalf level, medial midcalf level, and medial malleolar level. In patients with documented venous disease, regional photoplethysmographic findings were compared with results from venous pressure measurements, ascending/descending phlebography, foot volumetry, venous plethysmography, and Doppler investigation of the anterior tibial veins. The best correlation with pressure and volume recordings at the foot was obtained at the medial malleolar level. Only photoplethysmographic recovery times recorded at the anterior aspect of the leg were influenced by reflux in the anterior tibial veins. The present results indicate that photoplethysmographic recovery times reflect regional venous hemodynamics rather than overall venous hemodynamics in the limb. Photoplethysmographic recovery times were also found to be more related to superficial than to deep venous insufficiency. The results might have clinical implications when evaluating patients with regional venous dysfunction and in follow-up studies after venous surgery.\r"

Adenosine triphosphate-magnesium chloride resulted in the salvage of skeletal muscle, 57% +/- 12% versus 44% +/- 14% (p less than 0.05, n = 6 pairs). Reperfusion with the solution alone increased the resulting necrosis (42% +/- 13% vs 60% +/- 20%, n = 6 pairs). Adenine nucleotide stores were not increased, but oxygen consumption was increased by magnesium chloride-adenosine triphosphate (p less than 0.05, analysis of variance [ANOVA]). A clear relationship was demonstrated between the fall in energy stores, as measured by a change in energy charge potential from preischemia to end ischemia levels, and the extent of resulting necrosis (p less than 0.01). In summary, the addition of 2 mmol/L to an infusion of Krebs-Henseleit solution during reperfusion results in significant salvage of skeletal muscle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Edema of a lower extremity after femoropopliteal bypass surgery is a common problem. To study the causes of this phenomenon we evaluated 72 patients before and after surgery with noninvasive venous testing and venography. We also obtained postoperative lymphangiograms of a sample of 16 patients, eight with and eight without postoperative edema. Patients were sequentially assigned to one of four treatment groups: group A, a lymphatic-preserving inguinal dissection with conventional popliteal dissection; group B, a lymphatic-preserving popliteal dissection with conventional inguinal dissection; group C, lymphatic-preserving inguinal and popliteal dissections; group D, conventional inguinal and popliteal dissections. Twenty-nine (40%) of the 72 patients had postoperative edema. A similar proportion of patients with edema had deep venous thrombosis as patients without edema (3/29 [10%] vs 3/43 [7%], respectively). Patients in group D showed the highest incidence of edema, 17/20 or 85%, a rate significantly higher than the rates in the other three groups (p less than 0.001). Results of lymphangiograms were normal in six of the eight patients without edema (the other two had slight disruption), whereas they showed severe lymphatic disruption in all eight patients with edema. No association was found between edema and type of graft used or severity of preoperative symptoms. This study indicates that deep venous thrombosis is not an important cause of edema that occurs after bypass surgery and that intraoperative lymphatic disruption probably causes most cases of this complication.\r"

An endothelialized mesoatrial graft was implanted in a patient with Budd-Chiari syndrome caused by a primary inferior vena caval leiomyosarcoma. During the initial surgery a Dacron vascular graft was preclotted with plasma and then lined with microvascular endothelial cells derived from the patient's subcutaneous adipose tissue. The patient did well initially but 9 months later required resection of a mechanical stricture of the graft that occurred as it passed beneath the costochondral junction. Grossly, the luminal surface of the resected graft was free of thrombus, with a smooth, glistening, white surface. Light microscopy demonstrated a surface layer of cells morphologically consistent with an endothelial cell monolayer, a subendothelial layer composed of extracellular matrix and spindle-shaped cells, and granulation tissue around the Dacron fabric. Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy confirmed the presence of vascular endothelium on the luminal surface. This report documents the successful achievement of a human endothelial cell monolayer that persisted for 9 months in the midportion of a Dacron vascular graft.\r"

The presentation and clinical course of our patients recently treated are presented, and perioperative care and immunosuppressive management are outlined. As the number of long-term survivors after cardiac transplantation increases, the incidence of other atherosclerotic complications including abdominal aortic aneurysm is likely to become more common, requiring extended cardiovascular follow-up.\r"

Voluntary reporting, an important part of postmarketing surveillance that signals potential problems with marketed drugs, historically has been underused by physicians. After 2 years, there was a more than 17-fold increase in reports submitted directly from Rhode Island compared with the yearly average before initiation of the project. Increases in the total numbers of reports were paralleled by significant increases in the numbers of reports of severe reactions. Similar increases were not experienced nationally. Physicians in Rhode Island were surveyed before and 2 years after interventions began to determine changes in knowledge and attitudes about reporting of adverse drug reactions. Significant gains in knowledge and positive attitudes toward the reporting system occurred. We conclude that physicians can be stimulated to increase their reporting of suspected reactions, thereby improving the viability of the federal reporting system.\r"

To evaluate this issue as well as the risk of hypertension following other current non-ESWL treatment options for urolithiasis (percutaneous nephrostolithotomy [PCNL], combined PCNL and ESWL, ureteroscopy, and spontaneous stone passage), detailed blood pressure measurements were made in 961 patients at least 1 year after treatment. All follow-up blood pressures were measured with random-zero blood pressure devices. This study includes 731 patients who received ESWL only (with an unmodified lithotriptor), 171 patients treated with ureteroscopy or spontaneous stone passage (control subjects), 25 patients who received PCNL only, and 34 patients treated with both ESWL and PCNL. In patients who received ESWL only, the annualized incidence of hypertension (2.4%) did not differ significantly from that in control patients (4.0%). Among patients who received ESWL, no correlation was found between the incidence of hypertension and unilateral vs bilateral treatments, the number of shock waves administered, the kilovoltage applied, or the power (number of shock waves times kilovoltage). However, there was a significant rise in diastolic blood pressure after treatment with ESWL (0.78 mm Hg), but not in the control group (-0.88 mm Hg). The long-term significance of this change in diastolic blood pressure following ESWL is unknown and requires further study.\r"

After comprehensive blood pressure screening of male employees (N = 2556) at the work site, 87 cases of hypertension and a random sample of 128 controls were studied. In a multiple logistic regression model, job strain was significantly related to hypertension, with an estimated odds ratio of 3.1, after adjusting for age, race, body-mass index, type A behavior, alcohol intake, smoking, work site, 24-hour urine sodium excretion, education, and physical demand level of the job. Controlling for the above variables in subjects aged 30 to 40 years with job strain, we found that the echocardiographically determined left ventricular mass index was, on average, 10.8 g/m2 greater than in subjects without job strain. We conclude that job strain may be a risk factor for both hypertension and structural changes of the heart in working men.\r"

  ".W": "The vaginal douching habits of 100 consecutive municipal hospital patients with verified pelvic inflammatory disease (cases) were compared with those of 762 randomly selected controls (random controls) and 119 women thought to have pelvic inflammatory disease but in whom the diagnosis was not confirmed by laparoscopy and/or endometrial biopsy specimen (internal controls). Because patients had been symptomatic for no more than 3 weeks, current douching was arbitrarily defined as any douching during the previous 2 months. Current douching was more common among those with pelvic inflammatory disease than among random controls or internal controls. Among current douchers, pelvic inflammatory disease was significantly related to frequency of douching. For example, when cases were compared with random controls, those who douched three or more times per month were 3.6 times more likely than those who douched less than once per month to have confirmed pelvic inflammatory disease. A logistic regression model was used to adjust for demographic, behavioral, and other possible confounding variables. Even after adjustments, douching during the previous 2 months remained associated with pelvic inflammatory disease. These data suggest that among these women vaginal douching may be a risk factor for pelvic inflammatory disease.\r"

  ".W": "A case-control design was used to investigate the effects of preexisting chronic conditions on in-hospital mortality in adult trauma patients. Cases consisted of all trauma deaths (n = 3074) that occurred in 1983 in any of the 331 acute care hospitals in California. Three to four control patients (injured survivors) were matched to each case patient on the basis of injury severity, age, and individual hospital (n = 9869). The data source consisted of hospital discharge abstract data uniformly collected on all admissions to acute care hospitals in the state. Conditional logistic regression techniques were used to estimate the relative odds of dying for patients with and without one or more of 11 preexisting chronic conditions identified as potentially detrimental to outcome. The presence of cirrhosis (relative odds = 4.5), congenital coagulopathy (relative odds = 3.2), ischemic heart disease (relative odds = 1.8), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (relative odds = 1.8), and diabetes (relative odds = 1.2) all significantly increased the risk of dying. These data provide statistical evidence to support the recommendation of the American College of Surgeons that the presence of underlying disease be considered in decisions to triage and transfer patients to trauma centers. They also underscore the importance of underlying disease in the case-mix adjustment of case-fatality rates and the identification of unexpected deaths for quality assurance review.\r"

Mortality among Chinese (n = 1288) dips by 35.1% in the week before the Harvest Moon Festival and peaks by the same amount (34.6%) in the week after. We chose to study mortality among Chinese and a Chinese holiday for two reasons. First, the holiday moves around the calendar, thus allowing separation of the effects of the holiday from fixed, monthly mortality effects. Second, the holiday appeals strongly to one (experimental) group and not to others (which can be used as control groups). In terms of percentage, cerebrovascular diseases displayed the largest dip/peak pattern, followed by diseases of the heart, and then malignant neoplasms. The dip/peak mortality pattern does not appear in various non-Chinese control groups. The statistical significance of the findings was demonstrated with linear and curvilinear regression analysis and with two nonparametric tests. After testing alternative explanations for the findings, we concluded that the dip/peak pattern occurs because death can be briefly postponed until after the occurrence of a significant occasion.\r"

Twelve cases of drownings in these large-capacity buckets constituted 24% of all infant and toddler (age less than 3 years) drownings investigated by the Cook County (Illinois) Medical Examiner's Office from January 1985 to June 1989. The buckets, all with 5-gal and 18-kg capacity, are constructed of heavy, rigid plastic and are intended for industrial use. Home use, typically as mop buckets, was associated with the toddlers' death. The large size and heavy construction of these buckets as well as the toddlers' cephalad center of gravity and undeveloped coordination prohibit the toddlers from extricating themselves after peering into and falling inside the buckets. Parents and public health officials should be advised that domestic use of these containers poses a serious threat to the safety of curious toddlers. Adults should never leave toddlers unattended around even small amounts of water.\r"

  ".W": "Hyperlipidemia is common in chronic renal failure (CRF), but the underlying mechanisms are not clearly defined. Certain data points toward a potential role for the state of secondary hyperparathyroidism of CRF in its pathogenesis. We examined the effects of parathyroid hormone (PTH) on lipid metabolism utilizing intravenous fat tolerance test (IVFTT) and post-heparin lipolytic activity in five normal dogs, in six animals with CRF and secondary hyperparathyroidism (NPX) and in six normocalcemic-thyroparathyroidectomized dogs (NPX-PTX) with comparable degree and duration of CRF. NPX dogs had fasting hypertriglyceridemia (82 + 6.0 mg/dl vs. 49 +/- 2.7 mg/dl in normal dogs, P less than 0.01), abnormal IVFTT, and reduced post-heparin plasma LPL activity (151 +/- 10 vs. 275 +/- 15 mumol fatty acids/ml/min in normal dogs, P less than 0.01). The NPX-PTX dogs had normal fasting levels of serum triglycerides (42 +/- 0.6 mg/dl), normal IVFTT, and normal post-heparin plasma LPL (317 +/- 19 mumol fatty acids/ml/min) despite CRF. Post-heparin HL activity in plasma was not different between NPX and NPX-TPX dogs. The results show that excess blood levels of PTH and not other consequences of CRF are mainly responsible for the abnormalities in lipid metabolism. The data are consistent with the notion that excess PTH reduces post-heparin LPL activity in plasma, which in turn results in impaired lipid removal from the circulation and consequently hyperlipidemia.\r"

These regulators appeared in the liver on the third day after this nephrectomy, decreased on the seventh day, and disappeared by the fourteenth day. The growth stimulatory activity, termed a tubular cell growth factor (TuCGF), was a heat- and acid stable 15 to 20 KDa protein. The additive effects of TuCGF on the epidermal growth factor (EGF), the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), and the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) were observed; the results suggest that TuCGF differs from EGF, IGF-I, or FGF. In contrast, the growth inhibitory activity, termed a tubular cell growth inhibitor (TuCGI), was a heat- and acid-labile protein with a molecular weight of about 150 to 200 KDa. This factor potently inhibited the DNA synthesis of tubular cells in the presence of insulin and EGF. These results suggest that TuCGI is not identical with transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). The regulation of these activities by target cell density is also discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Abnormalities in lipid metabolism frequently accompany renal disease and may be important in the pathogenesis of progressive renal injury. In the present study, the effects of a high cholesterol diet on renal histology, cortical lipids, and glomerular hemodynamic function were examined in normal rats with and without reduced renal mass. Cholesterol feeding for 19 weeks increased serum cholesterol from 66 +/- 10 mg/dl to 256 +/- 93 mg/dl in two-kidney rats, and from 73 +/- 15 mg/dl to 407 +/- 274 mg/dl in nephrectomy rats (P less than 0.01). Both sham-operated and unilateral nephrectomy rats fed a high cholesterol diet had a greater amount of glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial damage than rats fed standard chow. Cortical cholesteryl esters were increased by the cholesterol diet, and correlated with the amount of glomerulosclerosis (r = 0.90, P less than 0.01) and tubulointerstitial injury (r = 0.64, P less than 0.05). Cholesterol feeding and nephrectomy both caused alterations in tissue essential fatty acids, and a panel of specific monoclonal antibodies indicated that renal injury and cortical lipid alterations were associated with an increase in glomerular macrophages. Finally, micropuncture experiments carried out in a separate group of rats fed high cholesterol for 8 to 10 weeks demonstrated increases in glomerular capillary pressure. These results suggest that additional investigations may ultimately determine how cholesterol deposition, altered fatty acid metabolism, macrophages, and increased glomerular pressure might combine to cause chronic progressive renal injury.\r"

  ".W": "This study addresses mechanisms of the clinical, encephalopathic uremic illness and its suppression by dialysis. Renoprival rats were treated with peritoneal dialysis (8 exchanges per day, 30 min dwell), or untreated (attrition group), and their EEG's were automatically sampled overnight and subjected to power spectrum analysis as an index of encephalopathy. As in man the background rhythm of the quantified EEG (Q.EEG) in the attrition group slowed with time as extracellular fluid composition became increasingly abnormal; these changes were normalized by therapeutic dialysis (TD) using standard, commercial dialysate. However, Q.EEG slowing was only partially normalized by solute-specific dialysis using \"mock uremic dialysate\" (M-UD), prepared from laboratory chemicals to equal plasma concentrations in preterminal uremic rats of urea, creatinine, potassium, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, bicarbonate, sodium, and chloride. When only phosphate was added to TD, the Q.EEG slowed to the same level achieved after M-UD. We conclude that uremic encephalopathy in this model is produced by an unknown neurotoxin and augmented by one or more of the M-UD solutes, phosphate being a likely candidate. To localize the encephalopathic effect, regional brain glucose uptake was estimated in 20 discrete brain areas. Significance of reduced uptake in three areas is discussed.\r"

All kidneys were histologically examined and scored for degree of cyst formation using a semi-continuous (0 to 4+) grading scheme. Results suggested that this condition is a multifactorial threshold trait. For each strain, estimates of the mean and standard deviation of normally distributed liability were determined by maximum likelihood methods. Concomitant analyses showed: 1) a significant environmental effect related to drug source; 2) a variation in thresholds ranging from 0.94 (N = 46) for the B10.M strain to -0.71 (N = 297) for the C57B1/6J strain; and 3) three groups of strains with different susceptibility to PKD. These results are consistent with a multifactorial basis for susceptibility to PKD. Quantitative analysis of thresholds and liability distributions reveals that genetic, environmental and random elements all contribute to the expression and extent of the cystic trait.\r"
