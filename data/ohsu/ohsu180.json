  ".W": "Laser-assisted arterial anastomoses can now be performed with satisfactory short-term patency. This study was undertaken to evaluate patency and aneurysm formation with a 1-year follow-up. A microscopically guided CO2 laser was used to anastomose 1.5 to 2.0 mm carotid arteries in 24 rabbits. Under X6 to X40 magnification, 60 to 70 mW were delivered with a spot size of approximately 0.32 mm. One carotid artery underwent laser anastomosis; the opposite served as a sutured control (10-0 nylon sutures). The 48 end-to-end anastomoses were evaluated for patency and aneurysm formation at 3, 6, and 12 months. Aneurysms were defined as a 1.5 times increase in diameter at the anastomotic site. The vessels underwent microscopic examination. All laser-assisted and sutured anastomoses were patent up to 1 year. At 3 months, one of eight sutured and one of eight laser anastomoses were aneurysmal; stenosis was noted in one laser anastomosis. At 6 months, one of eight laser and 0 of eight sutured anastomoses were aneurysmal. At 12 months, one of eight rabbits had died; of the remaining seven, three of seven laser and zero of seven sutured anastomoses were aneurysmal. In total, five of 23 (21.7%) aneurysms developed with the laser technique and one of 23 (4.3%) with the suture technique (p less than 0.05). Laser-assisted anastomoses are technically feasible, and patency at 1 year is equal to those performed with the suture technique. Aneurysm formation is a consistent problem that demands further investigation.\r"

  ".W": "Porcine Pseudomonas adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been shown to respond to combination therapy of 150 mg of cimetidine, 12.5 mg/kg of ibuprofen, 10 mg/kg of diphenhydramine, 0.2 mg/kg of ketanserin, and 30 mg/kg of methylprednisolone (CIDKM or Poly-5) given at 20 and 120 minutes after the onset of a continuous infusion of liver Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 5 X 10(8) colony-forming units (CFU) ml at 0.3 ml/20 kg/min. The present study was designed to determine the minimal, effective therapy by selective deletion of individual agents from CIDKM. Eight groups were studied: saline control (S, n = 9), Pseudomonas control (P, n = 8), and the following Pseudomonas plus treatment groups (each n = 5): CIDKM (cimetidine, ibuprofen, diphenhydramine, and ketanserin), CID (cimetidine, ibuprofen, and diphenhydramine), IC (ibuprofen and cimetidine), ID (ibuprofen and diphenhydramine), and CD (cimetidine and diphenhydramine). Pseudomonas alone produced severe ARDS with significant (p less than .05) decreases in PAO2 cardiac index, and systemic arterial pressure and significant increases in pulmonary artery pressure, extravascular lung water (EVLW) and scintigraphically determined pulmonary albumin flux measured as slope index (SI). Full therapy, CIDKM or Poly-5, showed significant improvement in all parameters. Deletion of methylprednisolone did not significantly effect any parameter measured. The deletion of ketanserin, leaving CID, did not alter treatment efficacy, except for a significant decline in cardiac index at 3 hours. Deletion of ibuprofen from CID resulted in a failure to reverse pulmonary arterial hypertension, hypoxemia, elevated EVLW, and increased SI. Removal of either cimetidine or diphenhydramine from CID resulted in significant increases in EVLW compared with control levels and SI compared with both control levels and CID. These results indicate that a combination of both histamine H1 and H2 receptor blockers and the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, ibuprofen, is effective and essential in the treatment of hypoxemia, early pulmonary hypertension, and pulmonary microvascular injury in this fulminant model of porcine Pseudomonas ARDS.\r"

Since tumor growth rate may be stimulated by total parenteral nutrition (TPN), we investigated the effect of the glutamine antimetabolite, acivicin, on methylcholanthrene sarcoma growth in rats maintained on TPN or on rat chow. Acivicin treatment significantly reduced tumor growth by 67% in rats receiving TPN and by 71% in rats maintained on chow. Carcass weights were significantly increased by TPN in both acivicin-treated and saline solution-treated tumor-bearing rats. Tumor-carcass ratios were significantly decreased in both groups of acivicin-treated tumor-bearing rats. Acivicin treatment or a similar approach may therefore be useful for stabilizing tumor growth in patients receiving TPN.\r"

The results were compared with data obtained from healthy women of similar age. The total body clearance of ethinyloestradiol was significantly higher in the patients with cystic fibrosis (0.61 (SD 0.19) l/h/kg) than in control women (0.32 (0.16) l/h/kg; p less than 0.02). In addition, the oral bioavailability of ethinyloestradiol was greater in women with cystic fibrosis than in controls (76.9% (11.7%) compared with 47.3% (7.5%); p less than 0.001). As a result of these two changes, the area under the plasma concentration--time curve after an oral dose of ethinyloestradiol was similar in patients and controls. The pharmacokinetics of levonorgestrel did not differ significantly between patients with cystic fibrosis and healthy women. The data suggest that women with cystic fibrosis will receive similar contraceptive protection from these steroids as do healthy women.\r"

  ".W": "We conclude that, although many therapies have been advocated, no regimen has proved to be consistently effective in the treatment of idiopathic male infertility. Couples in which the husband is identified as having idiopathic infertility should be advised of the inconsistent and often low conception rates obtained with medical therapy. This should be weighed against the possibility of greater success with in vitro fertilization and the likelihood of success with artificial insemination by donor. Matson and colleagues performed in vitro fertilization on 75 couples in which the husband was oligospermic. When the husband was moderately (5.1 to 11.9 million motile sperm per milliliter) or severely (less than or equal to 5 million motile sperm per milliliter) oligospermic, fertilization rates were 56 and 30 per cent, respectively. This is in comparison to a fertilization rate of 72 per cent in normospermic couples. Following embryo transfer, pregnancy rates were similar in all groups. In vitro fertilization, although expensive and often not covered by insurance policies, may yield results in 1 month. Pharmacologic treatment of the male, which is less expensive, requires several months before improvement might be expected. The decision as to which course to recommend should be made after careful consultation with the couple. If empiric therapy is decided upon, the choice of an agent is somewhat arbitrary. Reasonable initial choices for the oligospermic patient are tamoxifen (or clomiphene citrate) or HCG (HCG may also be used in the patient with idiopathic asthenospermia). Testosterone rebound, with its risk of permanent azoospermia, is not an acceptable initial therapy. Similarly, the results of studies of testolactone, GnRH, pentoxifylline, and kallikrein either demonstrate low pregnancy rates or are too preliminary to recommend at this time. Regardless of the choice of therapy, it should be administered for at least 3 months to include the length of one spermatogenic cycle. The performance of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over studies of present and future treatments will allow more definite conclusions to be drawn.\r"

Care must be taken in reviewing the literature regarding antisperm antibodies in men, since many studies are based on measurement of antibodies in the circulation or have utilized antigens (such as solubilized or fixed sperm) that are not on the sperm surface. The results of these assays that are not measuring antibodies against the sperm plasma membrane may not be clinically significant, since the sperm plasma membrane remains intact in sperm participating in in-vivo fertilization until after the acrosome reaction. Treatment of antibody-mediated infertility in the male is difficult at the present time, although newer techniques are promising.\r"

Data on mortality from the available randomized trials of thrombolytic therapy, intravenous beta blockers, hyaluronidase, intravenous nitrates and calcium channel blockers in acute myocardial infarction, are systematically reviewed. Analyses confirm that intravenous streptokinase reduces mortality by about 25% but suggests that measures to prevent reinfarction may be required after thrombolytic therapy. beta blockers reduced mortality by approximately 15%. The pooled data from the existing trials of hyaluronidase and intravenous nitrates are consistent with a 15% to 20% decrease in mortality; ideally this should be confirmed in future large randomized trials. Currently, there is no evidence either from individual studies or the aggregate of all the trials that calcium channel blockers reduce mortality. The collective experience from the trials carried out over the last 2 decades suggests that most interventions in acute myocardial infarction have, at best, only moderate effects with a 10% to 20% reduction in mortality. Current and future trials that assess the effects of cardiovascular treatments on mortality should therefore aim to randomize 10,000 to 20,000 average risk patients or a few thousand high risk patients.\r"

  ".W": "The most critical substrate lacking in infarcting myocardium is oxygen and early reperfusion would appear to be the most promising approach to infarct reduction. The efficacy of thrombolytic therapy has been shown by an increase in the global ejection fraction assessed by angiography or gated blood pool techniques and also by a decrease of almost 50% in the radioisotope perfusion defect after 3 to 4 weeks. Functional results in a group of patients subdivided according to success of thrombolysis and plasma creatine kinase levels showed that, among patients with successful thrombolysis, those with the least ischemic damage had experienced shorter ischemic periods and had significantly more collateral vessels supplying the infarcting area. It is recommended that the ischemic period should not extend beyond 3 to 5 hours before therapy is begun. The combination of intravenous streptokinase followed by intracoronary streptokinase was found to lead to a significant shortening of the ischemic period when compared with intracoronary streptokinase alone. Reocclusion of the infarct vessel has been shown to occur in 10% to 30% of patients after successful reperfusion, especially in arteries with severe residual stenosis, but immediate revascularization carried out after reperfusion in such patients can bring about a substantial decrease in the 1 year mortality rate. Successful reperfusion showed particular benefit in patients with previous myocardial infarction in another area, in patients with large left ventricular perfusion defects and in patients with predominantly right ventricular infarction.\r"

A coronary angiogram was recorded at the end of the infusion in 119 patients. Central assessment of the angiograms revealed a patent infarct-related artery in 78 patients (patency rate 66%, 95% confidence limits 57 to 74%). Patients with a patent infarct-related artery at the first angiogram were randomized in a double-blind manner to receive a subsequent 6-hour infusion of either 30 mg of rt-PA or placebo. All patients had received an initial bolus of 5,000 IU of heparin and then 1,000 IU/hour until a second angiogram was recorded 6 to 24 hours after the start of the second perfusion. At central assessment of the second coronary angiogram the reocclusion rate was 2 of 36 patients who received rt-PA at the second infusion and 3 of 37 patients not receiving this drug (or the 2 groups combined 7%, 95% confidence limits 2 to 15%). Three of 60 patients (5%, 95% confidence limits 1 to 14%) with patent arteries on both previous angiograms had a later occlusion as judged on the angiogram recorded at hospital discharge. No difference in late reocclusion rates between the 2 treatment groups was observed.\r"

On commencing therapy, active patches significantly prolonged exercise time (3.5 hours after patch application) in comparison with placebo, with an accompanying reduction in ST-segment depression at maximal common workload. Patients then received continuous or 12-hour-daily intermittent patch therapy, in a double-blind fashion, for 7 days. Exercise testing was repeated before and after active patch application, on the eighth day of each treatment phase. During continuous therapy, beneficial effects on exercise time and ST depression were abolished. By contrast, during intermittent therapy, prolongation of exercise time and reduction in ST-segment depression still occurred, on testing 3.5 hours after active patch application. These results confirm previous studies showing a high degree of tolerance during continuous therapy with nitroglycerin patches and suggest that tolerance can be prevented by 12-hour-daily intermittent therapy.\r"

Admissions were classified as: primarily for treatment of arrhythmias (171 patients); primarily for treatment of arrhythmias but with serious concurrent illnesses that prolonged hospitalization (43 patients); or primarily for nonarrhythmic problems with electrophysiologic study an incidental part of hospitalization (8 patients). Based on allowable length of stay for the applicable DRGs, actual hospitalizations exceeded Medicare allowable length of stay by 50 to 500%. Retrospective review of hospital charts indicated that 3 clinical factors serve as effective markers in determining length of stay: need for amiodarone, induction of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF), and presence of serious other medical problems that require stabilization before electrophysiologic testing. Our data indicate that 3 classes of patients can be identified: I. DRG A (45%)--those who did not have sustained VT or VF induced, did not require amiodarone and had no serious concurrent illnesses. The mean length of stay was 7.1 days. II. DRG B patients (21%)--those who had sustained VT or VF induced, but did not require amiodarone and had no serious concurrent illnesses. The mean length of stay was 13.7 days. III. DRG C patients (34%)--those who either had a serious concurrent illness or required amiodarone. The mean length of stay was 19.7 days. This classification schema might allow a more appropriate system for determining reimbursement.\r"

Before long-term therapy in 56 patients, oral enoximone was shown to augment cardiac output by more than 30%. In 13 outpatients enoximone was initiated without hemodynamic monitoring. Within 12 weeks of therapy the majority of surviving patients were improved by at least 1 New York Heart Association functional class. In a subset of 30 patients who were able to perform reproducible treadmill exercise before entry, average maximal O2 uptake increased from 14.9 ml/kg/min at baseline to 17.6 ml/kg/min (p less than 0.05) at 2 to 4 weeks and remained increased at 17.4 ml/kg/min (p less than 0.05) at 12 weeks. Adverse gastrointestinal effects occurred in 11 patients and were generally mild. The 12 month survival rate was 44%; etiology of death was cardiogenic shock in 17 patients and 10 patients died suddenly while at home. Thus, improvements in symptoms and maximal VO2 were observed in many patients with moderate to severe heart failure during long-term therapy with enoximone. Controlled trials will be needed to establish the safety and efficacy of this promising new drug.\r"

Nineteen patients had idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and 11 had ischemic heart disease. Patients were receiving maintenance therapy of digitalis and diuretics. Cardiac function was assessed at 12 week intervals (physical examination, exercise testing, chest x ray, echocardiography, radionuclide angiography, 24-hour Holter monitoring and blood chemistry). During a mean follow-up of 40 weeks, 6 patients died, due to noncardiac (n = 1) and sudden death (n = 1) and to cardiac failure (n = 4) within 36 weeks of drug treatment. In the remaining patients New York Heart Association class improved in 18, was stationary in 5 and deteriorated in 1. Exercise capacity increased during the first 26 weeks and was maintained improved thereafter. Clinical improvement appeared not to wane with time. No change in heart rate, blood pressure and cardiothoracic ratio was observed. Echocardiographic left ventricular dimensions did not change significantly; however, the fractional shortening increased from baseline (14%) to 19% after 12 weeks, 17% after 26 weeks and 21% after 52 weeks (p less than 0.05). The preejection period/left ventricular ejection time ratio decreased from 0.74 to 0.35, 0.44 and 0.43 (p less than 0.05), respectively.

Twelve-hour aliquots for urinary nitrogen, creatinine, and 3-methylhistidine were collected during the final 36 h of oral feeding and IVF. During these experimental periods, indirect calorimetry was utilized to determine resting oxygen consumption and that occurring during a 1-h period of submaximal (40% of maximal) upright, bicycle exercise. Despite differences in the route of nutrient delivery, oxygen uptake during a fixed rate of exercise (75 W) was similar during oral (16.7 +/- 0.4 mL X kg-1 X min-1) and IVF (14.7 +/- 1.0 mL X kg-1 X min-1). When compared with basal urinary losses, submaximal exercise resulted in diminished nitrogen (p less than 0.01, oral) and 3-methylhistidine (p less than 0.05, oral; p less than 0.01, IVF) excretion during a 12-h post-exercise recovery period.\r"

Pentane was analyzed by a Porasil-D column with a derived calibration curve. The mean excretion of pentane in 10 normal adults was 6.34 +/- 0.96 pmol X kg-1 X min-1 (mean +/- SEM) and was significantly higher in five patients with plasma vitamin E deficiency (15.39 +/- 1.84 pmol X kg-1 X min-1). There was a significant negative correlation between pentane output and plasma vitamin E levels (r = -0.66, p less than 0.01). Moreover, breath pentane excretion was significantly decreased after a 10-d supplementation with vitamin E in five normal subjects. We conclude that breath pentane output is a sensitive, noninvasive, functional test for assessing vitamin E status.\r"

To establish an antigenic profile of EN as an aid in the differential diagnosis of these histologically similar nasal tumors, immunostaining was performed for the following intermediate filaments: keratin, neurofilament, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and desmin; neuron-specific enolase (NSE), S-100 protein, chromogranin, human common leukocyte antigen (HLE), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), myoglobin, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) on 21 primary nasal tumors: eight EN, five lymphoepitheliomas, two small cell carcinomas, three lymphomas, and three rhabdomyosarcomas. Keratin and CEA stained only the carcinomas (6/7+, 4/7+), respectively; desmin and myoglobin only rhabdomyosarcoma (3/3+, 1/3+); and HLE only lymphomas (3/3+). Chromogranin and neurofilament staining occurred exclusively in one case each of EN. S-100 and NSE commonly stained EN (5/8+, 6/8+), but carcinomas (1/7+, 2/7+) and rhabdomyosarcomas (1/3+, 3/3+) were also positive. Despite the apparent nonspecificity of NSE and S-100, an antigenic profile of positive NSE of S-100 staining with negative epithelial, muscle, and lymphoid antigens uniquely identified six of eight EN. Chromogranin and neurofilament positivity was further evidence for EN in two cases. This antigenic profile is a helpful adjunct in the diagnosis of EN and other primary malignant nasal tumors.\r"

To further investigate this suggestion, the authors measured kallikrein inhibition in 19 patients with the lupus inhibitor. They found that kallikrein inhibition was greater than 100% of that of a normal plasma pool in all patients and greater than 125% in 11 of 19. Kallikrein inhibition was significantly correlated with C1-esterase inhibitor (C1S-INH) concentration, which they measured by rocket immunoelectrophoresis (r = +0.55, P less than 0.05). In three patients the C1S-INH was more than 30% greater than the kallikrein inhibition. Crossed immunoelectrophoresis for C1S-INH in these patients' plasma revealed an electrophoretic mobility identical with that of the normal plasma pool. The authors suggest that C1S-INH-mediated kallikrein inhibition, in conjunction with other coagulation abnormalities, predisposes patients with the lupus inhibitor to thrombosis.\r"

Placebo produced no significant change in mucosal blood volume and mucosal Hb-SO2. These findings suggest that misoprostol may have the potential effect of accelerating gastric ulcer healing by improving gastric mucosal hemodynamics, in addition to its gastric acid antisecretory activity.\r"

  ".W": "Misoprostol, a synthetic methyl ester analogue of prostaglandin E1, inhibits basal, nocturnal, and stimulated gastric acid secretion. In doses of 400 to 1,200 micrograms daily, misoprostol accelerates the healing of duodenal and gastric ulcers in humans. In addition to its antisecretory actions, misoprostol has gastroduodenal mucosal protective (cytoprotective) effects in animals and in humans. In humans, these cytoprotective actions have been demonstrated in acid-dependent studies using non-antisecretory doses and in acid-independent studies using antisecretory doses. Patients with peptic ulcer disease may have a relative deficiency of mucosal prostaglandin synthesis as compared with nonulcer control subjects. In addition, patients who consume nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and those who are cigarette smokers may also have depressed gastric mucosal prostaglandin synthesis. There is some evidence that misoprostol reverses the deleterious effect of smoking on duodenal ulcer healing and that it is effective in treating and preventing mucosal damage induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and alcohol.\r"

Several multicenter double-blind, placebo-controlled trials confirmed the efficacy of misoprostol in the treatment of duodenal ulcer when administered at 800 micrograms in two or four divided doses daily. This report summarizes three cimetidine-controlled trials conducted in three separate geographic areas (Europe, Argentina, and Japan). The trials were double blind, randomized, and endoscopically controlled. In all studies, healing was defined as the absence of ulcer on endoscopy. The efficacy of misoprostol in the treatment of duodenal ulcer was shown to be equivalent to that of the histamine H2-receptor antagonist. In the Argentine study, the rate of disappearance of mucosal erosions was significantly greater for misoprostol than for cimetidine. Misoprostol was well tolerated. Mild and transient diarrhea not necessitating treatment or withdrawal occurred in 4 to 9 percent of the misoprostol-treated patients. These results indicate that misoprostol has a unique anti-ulcer action and represents a significant addition to the physician's armamentarium in the total medical management of duodenal ulcer.\r"

Misoprostol was significantly superior to placebo in healing duodenal ulcers (achieving a healing rate of 37 percent versus 22 percent in the placebo group [p = 0.02], and in relieving ulcer pain [p = 0.01]). Healing also occurred more frequently with misoprostol than with placebo in patients with subgroups of particularly resistant ulcers. In the treatment of ulcers refractory to at least eight weeks of histamine H2-blocker therapy, misoprostol achieved a healing rate of 42 percent versus 20 percent with placebo. In the treatment of pyloric channel ulcers, 28 percent of patients in the misoprostol group showed healing as compared with 20 percent in the placebo group. Diarrhea was reported by 15.4 percent and 3.4 percent of patients receiving misoprostol and placebo, respectively, and was usually mild and transient. Misoprostol is safe and effective therapy for duodenal ulcers that have not healed during the course of H2-blocker therapy.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine whether lower subantisecretory doses of misoprostol protect the gastric mucosa in this single-dose aspirin model. Protection was defined as no more than 10 hemorrhagic spots and no more than two hemorrhagic streaks. A total of 140 men participated in the two phases of the study. In the first phase, groups of 10 subjects each received placebo or misoprostol in doses of 200 micrograms, 100 micrograms, 50 micrograms, or 25 micrograms in a double-blind design. All misoprostol doses protected 50 to 70 percent of subjects as compared with 20 percent of subjects in the placebo group. To expand the number of observations, 90 additional subjects in groups of 30 each were evaluated after receiving misoprostol 50 micrograms or 25 micrograms or placebo. Misoprostol 50 micrograms protected 14 of 30 subjects (47 percent), 25 micrograms protected 11 of 30 (37 percent), and placebo protected six of 30 (20 percent). The dose-response trend was statistically significant (p less than 0.05). It is concluded that misoprostol protects the gastric mucosa against a single 1,300-mg dose of aspirin and that there is a significant dose-response relationship.\r"

Gastroscopy was performed before and after the treatment period and the mucosa was assessed for erosive and petechial lesions according to a predetermined scoring scheme. Of 25 evaluable subjects, 12 were treated with misoprostol and 13 were treated with placebo. The mean overall endoscopic score was 1.24 +/- 0.09 with placebo and 0.26 +/- 0.07 with misoprostol. The difference, 0.98, was highly significant (p less than 0.001), with 95 percent confidence limits of 0.74 to 1.22. All subjects in the placebo group had higher mean scores than any in the misoprostol group. The scores for erosive and bleeding lesions in the antrum and corpus/fundus of the stomach were all reduced by administration of misoprostol. In conclusion, the results clearly demonstrate that misoprostol protects the gastric mucosa of humans against naproxen-induced damage.\r"

When used at recommended anti-inflammatory dose levels, however, they often produce injury to the gastric and duodenal mucosa and concomitant blood loss. A double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of misoprostol, a synthetic analogue of prostaglandin E1, in preventing gastrointestinal blood loss induced by acetylsalicylic acid in patients with degenerative joint disease. Forty-five arthritic patients (22 women and 23 men) were admitted to the study. All patients had received treatment with 3,900 mg of acetylsalicylic acid per day in four divided doses for at least two weeks and continued to receive that regimen for the duration of the study. Red blood cells were tagged with chromium-51, and fecal blood loss was determined from Days 4 to 7. Patients with a mean blood loss of at least 1.5 ml per day were randomly allocated to receive either placebo or 200 micrograms of misoprostol four times daily for seven days. Fecal blood loss was measured daily, and the results were compared with baseline determinations. Of 41 patients who completed the study, 19 were treated with misoprostol. Of these, 11 patients (57.9 percent) had at least a 50 percent reduction in blood loss. Of 22 patients receiving placebo, only one had a 50 percent reduction in blood loss (p = 0.003; Fisher's exact test). Mean blood loss in patients using misoprostol was reduced from 3.65 +/- 2.51 to 1.57 +/- 0.86 ml per day, whereas among those taking placebo, mean blood loss did not significantly change (2.98 +/- 1.24 to 2.79 +/- 1.63 ml per day). The difference in blood loss between the misoprostol and placebo groups was significant (p = 0.0023; Wilcoxon test). In those patients who completed the study, no significant changes were detected on laboratory tests. In conclusion, misoprostol effectively reduced fecal blood loss in arthritic patients treated with acetylsalicylic acid.\r"

A total of 162 separate clinical treatment courses were evaluated in the 157 patients for the period May 1, 1981 to May 6, 1986. Misoprostol was administered orally or via nasogastric tube, 800 micrograms to 1,200 micrograms daily in four to six divided doses, for periods of from one day to 17 months. Patients were considered to have a favorable clinical outcome if they achieved significant improvement in symptoms, hemorrhagic status, or appearance of their condition on endoscopy. Favorable clinical outcomes were observed in 52 of 83 treatment courses (63 percent) involving UGI hemorrhage and in 44 of 79 treatment courses (56 percent) for long-standing nonhemorrhagic UGI disease. A total of 116 treatment courses were for patients with a single UGI entry diagnosis; 28 treatment courses were for patients with two UGI entry diagnoses; four courses were for patients with three UGI entry diagnoses; and 14 treatment courses were for miscellaneous UGI entry diagnoses. Treatment outcomes were analyzed by the four most commonly treated UGI entry diagnoses; patients who had an initial diagnosis of refractory duodenal ulcer (n = 28), refractory gastric ulcer (n = 41), reflux esophagitis (n = 23), or hemorrhagic gastritis (n = 63) had favorable clinical outcomes of 71 percent, 58 percent, 61 percent, and 62 percent, respectively. Misoprostol was well tolerated, with the most common adverse experience being mild to moderate diarrhea. It is concluded that in humanitarian clinical trials, misoprostol was frequently associated with symptomatic relief, with improvement in UGI hemorrhage, or with endoscopic improvement in severe UGI disease that had proven refractory to available medical therapy.\r"

These patients comprised a selected population of patients with very active disease, as shown by a mean 20-fold increase of serum alkaline phosphatase levels before aminohexane diphosphonate therapy. Aminohexane diphosphonate induced a striking reduction of serum alkaline phosphatase and urinary hydroxyproline levels sustained for up to 18 months after withdrawal of treatment. Two patients had a relapse 14 to 16 months after treatment, and received a second course of aminohexane diphosphonate with the same efficacy. This was accompanied by marked clinical improvement, a reduction of the radioisotope uptake by pagetic bones, and radiologic healing of osteolytic lesions in some cases. Iliac crest biopsy specimens taken after tetracycline double-labeling showed no impairment of bone mineralization. No clinical or biochemical adverse effects have been observed.\r"

The response of prolactin to gonadotropin-releasing hormone stimulation was compared with that of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone obtained simultaneously. Basal serum prolactin increased significantly (p less than 0.001) in response to estrogen treatment, and a positive correlation was found between the serum concentrations of estradiol and prolactin (r2 = 0.266; p = 0.0011). Gonadotropin-releasing hormone induced a significant increase in serum prolactin concentrations, which was greater after 5 to 10 days of estrogen treatment compared with that in the estrogen-depleted state (p = 0.031). No correlation was found between gonadotropin-releasing hormone-stimulated prolactin and luteinizing hormone or follicle-stimulating hormone release. These data demonstrate that estrogen treatment of previously hypoestrogenemic postmenopausal women potentiates gonadotropin-releasing hormone-stimulated prolactin release. Furthermore, our data suggest that the previously described paracrine interaction between the gonadotropins and lactotropes exerted by gonadotropin-releasing hormone does not appear to be mediated via increased gonadotropin release.\r"

Patients were treated with 2.2 to 3.0 mg of indomethacin/kg body weight/day. The treatment was started at an average gestational age of 24 +/- 0.5 weeks and continued for 2 to 11 weeks. All patients had significant improvement with a simultaneous reduction in amniotic fluid volume, fundal height, and umbilical perimeter. All patients were delivered satisfactorily at an average of 39 weeks' gestation. The fetuses were within the normal body weight range of 2750 to 3600 gm and showed normal development during the neonatal period of 2 to 6 months. Before delivery without indomethacin, the polyhydramnios reformed. Adverse effects or intolerance to the drug was avoided by either a reduction in the dose or cessation of indomethacin therapy.

Several factors must be considered (for instance, in vivo and in vitro efficacy, patient allergies, side effect profiles, status of host defenses, the total cost of therapy, and the risk of selecting resistant organisms that cause superinfections) before prescribing prophylactic antibiotic drugs for this indication. Moreover, medical-legal consequences associated with potential postpartum infections must be considered in assessing the costs and impact of a prophylactic regimen. Results of comparative antibiotic trials in indigent patients undergoing cesarean section demonstrated differing rates of successful antibiotic prophylaxis: piperacillin, 98%; cefoxitin, 91%; cephalothin and ceftazidime, 82%; cefotaxime, 80%; and ampicillin, 77%. Although the acquisition costs of antibiotics vary greatly, these costs are dwarfed by the substantial cost savings that can be realized by use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, which, in our hands, have resulted in reduced laboratory and pharmacy expenses and decreased hospital stays for both mother and neonate. Controlled studies designed to investigate microbiologic as well as clinical efficacy of antibiotics are indicated. Further refinements in individualizing antibiotic regimens according to patient population should be sought.\r"

  ".W": "Sixty-three well characterized B-cell lymphomas, with diagnoses previously established by conventional cryostat immunocytochemistry or limited paraffin immunocytochemistry, were studied. The tumors encompassed most of the Kiel subtypes and included the newly recognized entity, sclerosing mediastinal B-cell lymphoma. by the avidin-biotin peroxidase complex technique, each tumor was stained with a panel of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies reactive in routinely fixed wax-embedded tissues. The panel included four reagents recognizing probable T-cell and B-cell restricted leukocyte common moieties (UCHL1, MT1, MB1, 4KB5), three antibodies to B-cell-related antigens (KiB3, MB2, LN1), and one to a macrophage-related antigen (Mac411). Other antibodies employed included anti-mu chain, anti-kappa, anti-lambda, and seven antibodies to non-phenotype-associated antigens, including HLA-DR (TAL-1B5, LN3, LN2, MB3), CD15 (C3D-1), and CD30 (BER-H2). Monotypic surface or perinuclear space and cytoplasmic immunoglobulin were detected in 80% of cases. Distinctive immunocytochemical profiles were demonstrable in many tumor categories by means of the panel of antibodies, thus facilitating the differential diagnosis of tumors of similar morphology. These results, together with our work on T-cell lymphoma in paraffin sections, show that accurate phenotypic analysis of lymphoma is now possible in routinely processed tissues.\r"

In 14 test rabbits (61%) malignant tumors developed of decidual type cells not heretofore described. The deciduosarcomas were composed of anaplastic cells that invaded the uterine walls, uterine lymphatics, and in 4 of 13 (31%) rabbits that survived 2 years of treatment, the tumors metastasized to the lungs. Several deciduosarcomas appeared to arise within the spleen or other abdominal organs. Other drug-related lesions included uterine or vaginal polyps, endometrial atrophy, and focal necrosis and mineralization of the uterine wall. Cells from several deciduosarcomas failed to produce tumors in nude mice or to colonize on soft agar. No decidualization or decidual neoplasms were seen in the controls.\r"

  ".U": "87296237\r", 
  ".W": "The local response to a single intradermal injection of 10 micrograms recombinant gamma-interferon (rIFN gamma) has been studied in 17 patients with lepromatous leprosy. Of these, 2 patients additionally received two intradermal injections of 10 micrograms rIFN gamma at another site. The results were compared with those of 3 patients who received three injections of the same dose at a single site in an earlier study. One to 7 days after lymphokine administration 4-mm punch biopsies were obtained and examined for cellular alterations in the dermis and epidermis. This allowed a kinetic analysis of mononuclear cell infiltration, keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, and Langerhans cell redistribution. At 24 hours, the migration of large numbers of helper T cells and monocytes was already prominent and associated with induration. Mononuclear cell accumulation peaked at 72 hours but then persisted for 5-7 days. Only small numbers (one-third or less of total T cells) of suppressor/cytotoxic T cells were present at any time, and granulocytes were absent. Two daily injections of rIFN gamma led to a more intense accumulation of cells. Ten micrograms of rIFN gamma resulted in enhanced keratinocyte proliferation, Ia expression, and thickening of the epidermis. At 24-48 hours major histocompatibility Class II (Ia) antigen was first noted on the dividing cells of the basal layer. By 72-96 hours the entire epidermis exhibited strong expression of Ia antigen on cell surfaces. Repeated doses of lymphokine accentuated these changes and resulted in a more prompt keratinization and sloughing of this layer. Whereas a single dose of rIFN gamma resulted in the upward movement of T6+ Langerhans cells (LCs) in the epidermis, two injections led to a 50% reduction in their numbers and three doses were associated with an almost total loss of detectable T6+ LCs from the epidermis. These are probably sloughed along with keratinocytes. In contrast to the situation with a delayed immune response in the skin (purified protein derivative), no LCs accumulated in the dermis in association with helper T cells.\r"

Ultimately, it is only the explicit recognition by the medical profession, government agencies, corporate insurers, and the general public of the nature and significance of this market failure and foregone benefits which can lead to remediation.\r"

Based upon data from 93 hospitals and 205,000 admissions, we used a multiple regression model to adjust the hospitals crude death rate. The adjustment process used age, origin of patient from the emergency department or nursing home, and a hospital case mix index based on DRGs (diagnostic related groups). Before adjustment, hospital death rates ranged from 0.3 to 5.8 per 100 admissions. After adjustment, hospital death ratios ranged from 0.36 to 1.36 per 100 (actual death rate divided by predicted death rate). Eleven hospitals (12 per cent) were identified where the actual death rate exceeded the predicted death rate by more than two standard deviations. In nine hospitals (10 per cent), the predicted death rate exceeded the actual death rate by a similar statistical margin. The 11 hospitals with higher than predicted death rates may provide inadequate quality of care or have uniquely ill patient populations. The adjusted death rate model needs to be validated and generalized before it can be used routinely to screen hospitals. However, the remaining large differences in observed versus predicted death rates lead us to believe that important differences in hospital performance may exist.\r"

The analysis is derived from epidemiological projections and cost information for the United States population in 1983. Estimated costs include both direct medical care and social support costs, as well as indirect costs, such as support services provided by family or volunteers, and the value of lost economic productivity in Alzheimer's Disease patients. Mid-range estimates of net annual expected costs for an Alzheimer's Disease patient, excluding the value of lost productivity, are $18,517 in the first year and $17,643 in subsequent years, with direct medical and social services comprising about half of these costs. Under base case assumptions, the total cost of disease per patient in 1983, was $48,544 to $493,277, depending upon patient's age at disease onset. The estimated present value of total net costs to society for all persons first diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease in 1983 was $27.9-31.2 billion. Development of a public or private insurance market for the economic burdens of Alzheimer's Disease would fill some of the gaps in the current US system of financing long-term chronic disease care.\r"

One injury occurred for every 5.8 males and every 7.5 females. On the average, an injury resulted in 8.1 days of missed practice, 8.7 days for males and 6.6 days for females. Sprinting events were responsible for 46% of all injuries. The majority (83%) of injuries involved the lower extremities. Management of these injuries varied greatly. A direct correlation was noted between performance level of the athlete and incidence of injuries. The average noninjured athlete ranked at the 57.4 percentile based on best seasonal performance while the average injured athlete ranked at the 75.4 percentile. This direct relationship was present for both sexes and within all events, although some variation was noted within these separate groups.\r"

After induction of anesthesia with diazepam and fentanyl, mean CBF was 25 ml X 100 g-1 X min-1 and cerebral oxygen consumption, 1.67 ml X 100 g-1 X min-1. Cerebral oxygen consumption during nonpulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass at 26 degrees C was reduced to 0.42 ml X 100 g-1 X min-1 in both groups. CBF was reduced to 14-15 ml X 100 g-1 X min-1 in the non-temperature-corrected group (n = 21), was independent of cerebral perfusion pressure over the range of 20-100 mm Hg, but correlated with cerebral oxygen consumption. In the temperature-corrected group (n = 17), CBF varied from 22 to 32 ml X 100 g-1 X min-1, and flow/metabolism coupling was not maintained (i.e., CBF and cerebral oxygen consumption varied independently). However, variation in CBF correlated significantly with cerebral perfusion pressure over the pressure range of 15-95 mm Hg. This study demonstrates a profound reduction in cerebral oxygen consumption during hypothermic nonpulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass. When a non-temperature-corrected PaCO2 of approximately 40 mm Hg was maintained, CBF was lower, and analysis of pooled data suggested that CBF regulation was better preserved, i.e., CBF was independent of pressure changes and dependent upon cerebral oxygen consumption.\r"

Before induction the inspiratory capacity of each patient was determined. After induction of anesthesia and tracheal intubation patients breathed spontaneously except for three manual inflations to each patient's predetermined inspiratory capacity at the beginning and end of surgery. Arterial blood gas tensions were measured before and 5 min after each set of mechanical deep breaths and each hour during surgery, the mean duration of which was 2 +/- 0.09 hr. Spontaneous sighs occurred in 13 of 21 patients. The average frequency was 6 +/- 4 sighs/hr. At FIO2 = 0.5, nonsighing patients had an initial PaO2 of 229 +/- 59 mm Hg and sighers had an initial PaO2 of 162 +/- 57 mm Hg (P less than 0.05). Arterial oxygen did not change in sighing patients during the course of surgery, while in nonsighing patients the PaO2 decreased from the initial value of 229 +/- 60 mm Hg to 170 +/- 63 mm Hg (P less than 0.05). Mechanical deep breaths administered at the end of surgery produced no improvement in oxygenation in either sighers or nonsighers. The presence or absence of sighs did not correlate with PaO2 or PACO2. Though the results suggest that spontaneous sighs in some patients may function to help maintain arterial oxygenation, all patients maintained their PaO2 while breathing spontaneously under general anesthesia in the supine position.\r"

Pupillary diameter and the ventilatory sensitivity to CO2 were measured in six healthy volunteers at various times (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20 hr) in two sessions, separated by at least 1 week, at which either epidural morphine, 4 mg, or epidural buprenorphine, 0.15 mg, was administered randomly in a double-blind manner. Three of the six volunteers received 0.3 mg buprenorphine epidurally in a third session. Pupillary diameter was measured with a modified Essilor pupillometer. The ventilatory CO2 sensitivity was measured by a modified Read rebreathing technique. The ventilatory parameters measured were mouth occlusion pressure during the first 0.1 sec of inspiration (P0.1), end-tidal CO2 (PETCO2), tidal volume (VT) and respiratory rate (RR). Slopes of the linear regression lines (P0.1/CO2, VT/CO2, VE/CO2, and RR/CO2) and the intercept values of the regression lines and PETCO2 = 7.2 kPa (P0.1:7.2, VT:7.2, VE:7.2, and RR:7.2) were calculated. Pupillary diameter after epidural morphine was smallest at the second hour and had returned to normal after eight hours. After epidural buprenorphine there were two periods of miosis, one at 1-3 hr, the other at 10 hr. With epidural morphine, a statistically significant correlation (P less than 0.05) was found between pupillary diameter and VE/CO2, VE:7.2, P0.1:7.2, and VT:7.2. With epidural buprenorphine 0.15 mg a significant correlation was found between pupillary diameter and VE:7.2 and P0.1:7.2. With epidural buprenorphine 0.3 mg the correlations between pupillary diameter and VE:CO2, VE:7.2, and P0.1:7.2 were significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients were randomly assigned to receive one of four epidural regimens for the relief of postoperative pain: 5 mg morphine (n = 32), 4 mg butorphanol (n = 30), 2 mg butorphanol (n = 29), or 1 mg butorphanol (n = 31). Epidural morphine provided satisfactory analgesia with slow onset and long duration of approximately 21 hr. When butorphanol was administered, analgesia of rapid onset was seen with increasing duration and effectiveness observed with increasing dose; approximately 8 hr when using 4 mg. Sixty-two percent of the patients who received morphine had pruritus. Somnolence was the main side effect encountered in patients who received epidural butorphanol. The ventilatory response to CO2 was depressed after morphine and after 2 and 4 mg butorphanol, but the duration of depression was more prolonged after morphine. It is concluded that epidural butorphanol is effective in providing pain relief after cesarean section with minor side effects. However, patients must be observed closely because of possible respiratory depression.\r"

Eighty subjects with exercise-induced bronchospasm participated in a randomized parallel group study comparing albuterol (180 microgram) and cromolyn (20 mg) administered 15 minutes prior to a standardized treadmill challenge. The cromolyn group was restudied after 2 and 4 weeks of 4 times/day cromolyn therapy. The albuterol group was also studied at 2 and 4 weeks, but they only used their inhaler as needed between study visits. The mean maximum FEV1 drop post-exercise in the albuterol group improved from 33% (screening visit) to 6% (treatment day 1). The cromolyn group showed significantly less (P less than .01) improvement than the albuterol group (31% drop at the screening visit to 14% drop at treatment day 1). When 2 or 4 weeks of continuous cromolyn therapy was given in addition to a dosage 15 minutes prior to exercise, there was no significant difference compared with acute cromolyn administration alone. In summary, acute administration of albuterol was better prophylaxis for exercise-induced bronchospasm than acute or chronic cromolyn treatment.\r"

The effect of sodium cromoglycate was to prevent the appearance of complexes. This was associated with absence of symptoms. It is suggested that a local IgE-mediated mechanism acts as a \"trigger\" for the entry of antigen and the formation of immune complexes by altering the permeability of the gut mucosa.

  ".W": "The relative oxidative and microbicidal activities of human blood monocytes compared with those of alveolar macrophages (AM) are poorly defined. Furthermore, the comparative efficiency of recombinant gamma interferon (rIFN gamma) to enhance microbicidal function of these 2 cell populations is uncertain. In this study, blood monocytes and AM were obtained concomitantly from 10 healthy, nonsmoking human subjects. Cells were adjusted to equivalent cell concentrations and assayed for respiratory burst activity (superoxide anion production) during soluble (Concanavalin A) or particulate (bacteria) stimulation. Microbicidal activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeria monocytogenes, and Candida albicans was also determined for each cell type. Finally, the capacity of rIFN gamma treatment (200 U/ml for 24 h) to enhance these cellular activities was determined. Oxidative activity of AM was greater than that of blood monocytes (p less than 0.01, bacteria; p less than 0.02, Con A). Likewise, AM exhibited greater killing of P. aeruginosa (p less than 0.01) and L. monocytogenes (p less than 0.01) than did monocytes. Neither cell killed C. albicans. Treatment with rIFN gamma greatly enhanced both respiratory burst and microbicidal activity of blood monocytes, but had no effect on AM respiratory burst. Despite this, rIFN gamma-treated AM did exhibit some enhanced killing of L. monocytogenes (p less than 0.05). We conclude that oxidative microbicidal activity of resident AM greatly exceeds that of blood monocytes, but that blood monocytes are relatively more susceptible to activation by rIFN gamma.\r"

The specificity of EIA was equal to that of the other serologic tests. We conclude that EIA is a useful screening test for serum antibodies to H. capsulatum and B. dermatitidis that avoids some of the problems associated with other sensitive assays such as RIA. A negative EIA result is evidence against invasive histoplasmosis or blastomycosis and suggests an alternative diagnosis.\r"

To gain more insight into the mechanisms of this alveolar hypoventilation, breathing patterns were studied in 5 patients with end-stage renal failure during HD using acetate-buffered dialysate, which induces CO2 unloading, or bicarbonate without CO2 loss. Ventilation was continuously measured with calibrated respiratory inductance plethysmography using techniques of multiple linear regression analysis. At regular intervals, arterial blood gas was sampled and expired air was analyzed. Breathing patterns were analyzed for VE, VT, TI, TE, and VT/TI. All data were compared with the respective starting value and with the respective value in the other setup. A greater decrease in ventilation was seen during HD with an acetate-containing dialysate because of irregular breathing patterns that resulted in a prolongation of expiratory time. Important variations in tidal volumes, striking apnea periods, and occasional periodic breathing were observed. We suggest that these irregularities are due to CO2 unloading leading to the point where ventilation is totally mediated through the output of the peripheral chemoreceptors.\r"

PGH synthase generates superoxide in the presence of NADH or NADPH. Lipoxygenase also produces superoxide under similar conditions, but it is a much less important quantitative source for this radical. Radicals from the PGH synthase pathway are produced in vivo during topical application of arachidonate or bradykinin, a polypeptide that releases endogenous arachidonate from tissues. The vascular changes in response to arachidonate and bradykinin consist of functional, morphological, and biochemical alterations. Oxygen radicals from this pathway appear to play a role in the cerebral vascular changes in acute, severe hypertension and in fluid percussion brain injury.\r"

Depending on the cell type, AA can be metabolized by 3 pathways: cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenases, and cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases. Disease states, injury, and stress, will influence the enzymes that regulate the breakdown of AA and may favor the generation of products not usually associated with a tissue. Studies on renal eicosanoid mechanisms (all AA metabolites) can serve as a paradigm for other tissues and organs. Discrete stimulation of renal AA metabolism can occur-localized to specific cells within segments of the nephron; for example, cells of the medullary segment of the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (mTALH) have high cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase activity, through which novel AA metabolites are formed. These metabolites have characteristic biologic activities, inhibition of Na+-K+-ATPase activity and relaxation of blood vessels, and can be stimulated by peptide hormones. Cytochrome P-450-dependent monooxygenases are also present in the lung where, in their suggested capacity as oxygen sensors, they generate metabolites of AA that modify pulmonary vasomotion.\r"

We have assessed the effect of the introduction of a third immunosuppressive agent, azathioprine, on the rate of decline in airflow variables in eight heart-lung transplant recipients with obliterative bronchiolitis, and have compared this rate with that in five patients who did not receive augmented immunosuppressive therapy. Specifically, the rate of decline in forced expiratory flow rate between 25% and 75% of vital capacity improved considerably after institution of this therapy (-5.25 +/- 2.85 compared with -0.27 +/- 0.66 [mean +/- SD]; p less than 0.005), whereas the effect on the ratio of forced expiratory volume in one second to forced vital capacity was more modest (-3.61 +/- 1.52 compared with -0.54 +/- 0.93; p less than 0.005). The rate of decline in airflow variables was similar in both groups before the institution of therapy with azathioprine. These results show that augmented immunosuppressive therapy is capable of slowing the rate of progression of obliterative bronchiolitis in this population; they also suggest that the obliterative bronchiolitis may represent a form of chronic pulmonary allograft rejection.\r"

Calculation of the free T4 index partially but not completely corrected for the apparent decrease in thyroxine-binding globulin, as determined by a relatively small decrease in the free T4 index compared with a large decrease in T4. Sequential sampling, using three separate methods, showed reduced thyroxine-binding globulin levels. The mechanism for these changes is unknown, but the fact that these patients were essentially euthyroid needs emphasis because the use of combined colestipol and niacin therapy is becoming more widespread.\r"

Blood samples were analyzed for serum concentrations of PCBs and for biochemical and hematologic parameters at the time of the fire and 9 to 12 mo later. Firefighters and individuals who were in the building for 25 hr or more were also asked about post-fire symptomatology and examined after 1 yr for disorders of the skin, eyes, liver, and neurologic system. The results indicated that reported exposure was positively related to mean serum PCB levels (p = .004). The means and individual values, however, were within the range reported by other studies of persons with no unusual exposures. Significant correlations were observed between serum PCB concentrations and levels of liver enzymes and lipids, but mean levels of these biochemical parameters were not associated with reported exposure after adjustment for relevant covariables. Approximately one-half of those examined had skin lesions, but no cases of chloracne were detected, and there was no clinical evidence of any other exposure-related systemic disorder. The data suggest that exposure to contaminants from the building did not result in substantial absorption or cause any major short-term health effects.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously shown, in an animal model, that viable indigenous bacteria will cross the intact gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa and spread systemically, a process termed bacterial translocation, if the normal bacterial ecology of the gut was sufficiently disrupted to allow bacterial overgrowth or if the animals were severely immunosuppressed. Starvation or protein malnutrition disrupts the normal indigenous GI tract microflora and impairs host antibacterial defenses. Consequently, we tested the effect of the combination of starvation or protein malnutrition plus burn trauma in promoting bacterial translocation from the GI tract. Bacterial translocation was measured by quantitatively culturing the mesenteric lymph nodes, spleens, livers, blood, and peritoneal cavities of normal or burned (30% of total body surface area) CD1 mice deprived of food for three days or fed a low-protein (0.03%) diet. The effect of starvation or protein malnutrition on the gut microflora was determined by quantitatively measuring the levels of bacteria present in the ceca. Both starvation and protein malnutrition increased the cecal levels of gram-negative enteric bacilli and decreased the levels of lactobacilli and strict anaerobes. Surprisingly, neither starvation nor protein malnutrition promoted bacterial translocation, even though these animals lost over 20% of their body weight and the ecology of the gut microflora was disrupted. In fact, the protein-malnourished animals exhibited lower incidences of bacterial translocation than normally nourished animals when both groups were monoassociated with Escherichia coli C-25 or monoassociated and burned. Thus, it appears that protein malnutrition does not promote bacterial translocation, even when combined with burn trauma.\r"

  ".W": "This study examines the oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) occurring before, during, and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and whether they correlate with changes in cardiac output. Twenty-three patients undergoing open heart surgery were studied. Group 1 (N = 11) received fentanyl citrate, 50 micrograms/kg, intravenously during the induction of anesthesia. Group 2 (N = 12) received 100 micrograms/kg of fentanyl citrate intravenously. We measured VO2, VCO2, as well as hemodynamic and biochemical factors. Initial statistical analyses failed to show any differences in the VO2, VCO2, hemodynamic, or biochemical factors between groups 1 and 2. Therefore, the data from both groups were combined. In comparing the average (for all data) of the post-CPB with the pre-CPB periods in both groups for the metabolic factors, there were 9.0%, 11.5%, and 2.4% increases in the VO2, VCO2, and respiratory quotient, respectively. There was an 80% increase in total serum lactate levels seen in the post-CPB periods when compared with the pre-CPB periods. Serum triglyceride and free fatty acid levels measured in the post-CPB period decreased 39% and 25%, respectively, when compared with the pre-CPB periods. Although there were no changes in the cardiac outputs following CPB, the post-CPB periods showed a 37% increase in central venous pressure when compared with the pre-CPB periods. These data suggest that although there are significant metabolic and biochemical sequelae to CPB, the modest increases in post-CPB VO2, and VCO2 did not affect cardiac output following cardiovascular surgery. Increasing doses of narcotic do not have an effect on those relationships.\r"

The pathologic findings in these patients were compared with those in a matched group of 58 patients without PDD, who were simultaneously undergoing a similar investigation for the same clinical presentations. Pathologic findings in the pancreas and/or biliary tree were detected in 70.7% of all patients with PDD, compared with 39.7% in the control group. In patients with PDD, pancreatobiliary anomalies were detected in all patients who presented with jaundice, 85% of patients with pancreatitis, and 27.8% of patients with abdominal pain, as compared with 60%, 40%, and 17%, respectively, in the control group. In 23 patients, ERCP findings demonstrated pancreatobiliary abnormalities that were not detected by other imaging modalities. Fifteen of the patients with PDD and pancreatobiliary anomalies had undergone cholecystectomy between six months and five years previously. We conclude that ERCP is essential in the investigation of all patients with PDD, especially those presenting with jaundice or pancreatitis. Biliary surgery in patients with PDD and a dilated bile duct should include a biliary drainage procedure to prevent recurrence of pancreatobiliary disease.\r"

  ".W": "We analyzed the histopathologic findings of arthritis in 3 rat models: adjuvant arthritis induced by active immunization to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MT) antigens, arthritis produced by passive transfer of an intrinsically arthritogenic line of anti-MT T lymphocytes, and bystander arthritis produced by intraarticular injection of a foreign antigen, ovalbumin, into rats with T lymphocyte line cells specific for the ovalbumin antigen. The histopathology of the tibiotarsal and knee joints was studied by light microscopy and the articular surface of the cartilage by electron microscopy after labeling with cationized ferritin. The lesions in the 3 models of arthritis were compared. In active adjuvant arthritis, inflammatory lesions and cartilage destruction were found as early as 9 days after immunization, and persisted for as long as 11 months. Similar, but somewhat milder, lesions were found in arthritis produced by transfer of anti-MT T lymphocytes. Inflammatory signs were present at 4 days, when there was no evidence of joint edema. Severe inflammatory lesions were found in arthritis induced by transfer of anti-ovalbumin T lymphocytes that was followed by ovalbumin injection into the knee. Pathologic changes were found to be similar in all 3 models. Thus, the changes could be attributed to the action of T lymphocytes, irrespective of whether the target antigen was intrinsic to the joint.\r"

A special \"zero sweep rate\" tympanometric procedure was developed in order to improve the accuracy of measurement. The respiratory carbon dioxide tension was recorded, and swallowings were indicated automatically. Results showed that the pressure in the majority of ears remained slightly above the atmospheric pressure. In some ears, the pressure increased during periods of drowsiness or sleep when the end-expiratory carbon dioxide tension was rising and the number of swallowings declined. In two ears, the middle-ear pressure showed a slow continuous increase during a two-hour observation period. The present results indicate that the gas turnover in the middle ear by diffusion shows a positive balance during basal conditions. Our findings thus speak against the common belief that the middle-ear gas is continuously being absorbed.\r"

AZT was intentionally discontinued for three weeks over which the platelet count declined to 70,000/mm3. After reinstitution of AZT, the platelet count rose once again and remained near normal levels for over one year. We conclude that AZT may have efficacy against the thrombocytopenia observed in some patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The pathogenesis of ART and the mechanisms of action of AZT in this condition remain unknown.\r"

Subjects received one of several doses which ranged from 1,000 to 2,000,000 units per square meter body surface area. Toxicity at high doses consisted of flu-like symptoms and hypotension at highest doses. Partial objective tumor regression was observed in three patients with Kaposi's sarcoma. Seventeen patients had progression of disease (new opportunistic infection or increase in Kaposi's sarcoma) during therapy. No improvement in immunologic status was observed. This study does not suggest a role for single-agent rIL-2 therapy of established AIDS but its use in less symptomatic persons or in conjunction with antiretroviral agents such as azidothymidine should be investigated.\r"

Monocyte/macrophages infected with HIV may serve as a reservoir of HIV, may function abnormally and may transmit infection to other susceptible cells, thus playing a central role in the development of the immunodeficiency of AIDS. Quantitative analysis of surface antigens and measurement of HIV antigens in infected cells have been difficult using the conventional approach of immunofluorescent staining of cells on slides. We have developed a system that maintains monocyte/macrophages in suspension culture for at least four months. Through immunocytofluorographic single cell analysis we have shown that CD4 antigen is present on monocytes, and that a tenfold increase in expression occurs during the first two weeks in culture. In contrast, LeuM3 antigens decreased to background levels in the course of long-term culture. Using anti-HIV p24 antibody, we have demonstrated that monocyte/macrophages can be infected with HIV. Up to 70% of cells from individual donors could be infected. The techniques herein described allow in vitro quantitation of some of the mechanisms by which HIV infection of monocyte/macrophages may contribute to the immunodeficiency states associated with AIDS.\r"

All patients had normal resting pressures in the cardiac chambers and no clinical evidence of heart failure. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide rose significantly from the superior vena cava into the right atrium and right ventricle. The increase into the right atrium was variable, with no increase in three subjects, but there was a consistent increase in all subjects from the superior vena cava to to the right ventricle. These findings in the right atrium are probably caused by inadequate mixing and streaming of blood from the coronary sinus containing high concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide. There was no increase in the concentration of natriuretic peptide from the pulmonary artery to the left ventricle, but the concentrations in the left ventricle were significantly higher than in the superior vena cava. These findings demonstrate that the heart secretes atrial natriuretic peptides in the absence of cardiac failure. Studies based on sampling of the right atrium will not accurately measure cardiac secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide and will therefore be likely to obscure the mechanisms responsible for regulating its secretion. The right ventricle and pulmonary artery are the best sampling sites to measure atrial natriuretic peptide release from the right atrium.\r"

Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations were raised in all but four patients, and were higher in patients with known heart disease than in those without. The concentrations were higher with ventricular tachycardia than with atrial fibrillation or supraventricular tachycardia, and in acute versus chronic tachycardia. There was only a weak positive relation between ventricular rate and atrial natriuretic peptide (r = 0.31); but there was a closer inverse correlation between atrial natriuretic peptide and systolic arterial pressure (r = -0.60). Conversion to sinus rhythm was associated with a definite fall in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations. Despite very high baseline concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide only two patients reported polyuria. It is likely that atrial pressure rather than ventricular rate determines atrial natriuretic peptide release during tachycardia. Despite the absence of polyuria in all but two patients in this study atrial peptides could still contribute to, or cause, the polyuria of tachycardias.\r"

No significant differences between healthy and psoriatic individuals were detected, but a slight decrease in acid hydrolase activity was found in PMNL of psoriasis patients during PUVA therapy. PUVA treatment of PMNL in vitro at intensities that may be achieved in situ in the epidermis led to intracellular inactivation of acid hydrolases, which was not due to secretion of the enzymes or cell damage. The decrease in PMNL hydrolase activity appeared to be evoked by PUVA-generated reactive oxygen species because reduced glutathione prevented this decrease. The activity of free extracellular acid hydrolases was not affected by PUVA, and the superoxide production of PUVA-treated PMNL was increased. These results suggest that intracellular inactivation of acid hydrolases and possibly other lysosomal enzymes in PMNL or monocytes infiltrating the epidermis may contribute to the antipsoriatic activity of PUVA therapy.\r"

There was no statistical difference in the subjective response to treatment between the two groups. After 6 weeks of treatment there was a greater reduction in the number of pad changes/24 h in the oestrogen-treated patients that approached statistical significance but, because of a marked response in the placebo group, this difference was not significant after 3 months of treatment. There were also no significant differences between the two groups with respect to the UPP or Urilos measurements but the vaginal cytology and hormone profiles were significantly affected by oestrogens. In view of the possible risks of oestrogen therapy its use in genuine stress incontinence is limited.\r"

Levels of the receptor showed a clear relationship to disease stage, as follows: B-ALL greater than stage III or IV diffuse small noncleaved-cell NHL greater than stage III or IV lymphoblastic NHL greater than stage I or II NHL. Soluble IL2R levels were also closely correlated with serum lactic dehydrogenase levels (r = 0.7, P = .0001), a recognized indicator of tumor cell burden. Children with higher soluble IL2R levels (greater than 1,000 U/mL) were significantly more likely to fail treatment (P = .001), even when the analysis was limited to those with more advanced disease: stages III and IV NHL and B-ALL (P = .02). In a multivariate analysis, soluble IL2R level was found to have greater predictive strength than either serum lactic dehydrogenase level or disease stage. Thus, the measurement of soluble IL2R in children with NHL could be expected to improve existing methods of risk assignment in this disease.\r"

In this report we demonstrate that thrombocytopenia in the neonate is characterized by increased platelet destruction as shown by shortened homologous 111In-oxine-labeled platelet life spans. Thirty-one prospectively studied thrombocytopenic neonates were investigated by measuring the 111In-labeled platelet life span, platelet-associated IgG (PAIgG), and coagulation screening tests. In every infant, the thrombocytopenia was shown to have a destructive component since the mean platelet life span was significantly shortened to 65 +/- 6 (mean +/- SEM) hours with a range of one to 128 hours compared with adult values (212 +/- 8; range, 140 to 260; gamma function analysis). The platelet survival was directly related to the lowest platelet count and inversely related to both the highest mean platelet volume and duration of the thrombocytopenia. In 22 infants the percent recovery of the radiolabeled platelets was less than 50%, which suggested that increased sequestration also contributed to the thrombocytopenia. Infants with laboratory evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (n = 8) or immune platelet destruction evidenced by elevated levels of PAIgG (n = 13) had even shorter platelet survivals and a more severe thrombocytopenia compared with the ten infants in whom an underlying cause for the thrombocytopenia was not apparent. Full-body scintigraphic images obtained in 11 infants showed an increased uptake in the spleen and liver, with a spleen-to-liver ratio of 3:1. This study indicates that thrombocytopenia in sick neonates is primarily destructive, with a subgroup having evidence of increased platelet sequestration.\r"

Mitogen-free T cell-derived conditioned medium acts synergistically with PMA in inducing proliferation of B-PLL cells but does not enhance the PMA-stimulated outgrowth of nonmalignant B cells. Interleukin 2 (IL-2) has no effect on the outgrowth of B-PLL cells, and monoclonal antibodies against the IL-2 receptor do not influence the response to PMA and conditioned medium. Recombinant interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), in contrast, is a potent enhancer of PMA-induced proliferation of B-PLL cells. With gel filtration techniques and with the use of anti-IFN-gamma antibodies, it is shown that IFN-gamma in the conditioned medium is responsible for the observed increase in B-PLL cell proliferation. Preincubation of B-PLL cells with IFN-gamma induces responsiveness to PMA, whereas IFN-gamma alone had no effect on these cells when pretreated with PMA. The combined data show that, in the presence of PMA, native and recombinant IFN-gamma are growth factors for B cells from a B-PLL patient and that IL-2 is not involved in this process.\r"

Significant inhibition of interleukin-3 (IL-3), colony-stimulating factor 1, and lung conditioned media-induced clonal agar growth of normal murine hematopoietic cells by 10 mmol/L nicotinamide (NAM), 10 mmol/L 3-aminobenzamide (3AB), and 5 mmol/L N1-methylnicotinamide (1MN) was noted. Nicotinic acid, a related compound that does not inhibit ADP ribosylation, failed to inhibit the growth factor-mediated proliferation. NAM (10 mmol/L), 3AB (10 mmol/L), and 1MN (5 mmol/L) also prevented IL-3 and phorbol ester-stimulated 3H-thymidine incorporation into the IL-3-responsive FDC-P1 cell line. Exposure of FDC-P1 cells to 10 mmol/L NAM led to a significant decrease in nuclear poly-(ADP-ribose) levels. Exposure of FDC-P1 cells to 5 mmol/L 1MN did not affect the interaction of the phorbol ester receptor, protein kinase-C (PK-C), with the cell membrane as determined by assay of phorbol ester binding in cytosol and membrane preparations. Nor did it affect the catalytic activity of PK-C as determined by assaying the in vitro phosphorylation of histone H1 by cytosolic kinase preparations from FDC-P1 as well as EL4 thymoma cells. 1MN markedly enhanced the inhibitory effects of phorbol esters on DNA synthesis of EL4 cells even at concentrations (1.25 mmol/L) that had no effects on DNA synthesis in the absence of phorbol esters. Our findings demonstrate that (a) active ADP ribosylation inhibitors interfere with growth factor-induced proliferation of murine hematopoietic cells and (b) the inhibition occurs at a step that follows the activation and translocation of PK-C and is more closely linked to DNA synthesis.\r"

Both the number of adherent cells and the protein per dish decreased with increasing radiation doses. The dose of radiation decreasing the number of adherent cells by 37% on days 4 and 6 postirradiation was 29 Gy. Four hours postirradiation there was a small decrease in PMA-induced H2O2 production for doses of 7.5 Gy or greater; levels returned to normal by eight hours and increased at 24 hours postirradiation. By day 4 postirradiation significant increases in PMA-induced H2O2 production were noted at all radiation doses (2.5 to 50 Gy). This increase was not due to a shift in the PMA dose-response curve, a change in the time course of the PMA response, or an effect of decreased cell density on the assay system. Superoxide levels were not significantly changed in cells exposed to 20 Gy. Catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase levels also were unchanged. Culturing irradiated cells with gamma-interferon increased PMA-induced H2O2 release, which indicated that irradiated cells retained their capacity to respond to gamma-interferon. These data demonstrate that irradiation affects the PMA-induced H2O2 production of human monocytes in a time- and dose-dependent manner. An increase in the release of reactive oxygen intermediates by the macrophage may play a role in enhancing the deleterious effects of radiation in vivo.\r"

Eight of 24 autoantibody eluates tested agglutinated 3 of 10 anti-Rh(D) sensitized RBCs. The agglutinating activity was inhibited specifically by preincubation of the autoantibody eluate with the reactive anti-D. The reaction did not require the Fc domain of the anti-Rh(D), since autoantibody eluates agglutinated RBCs coated with F(ab')2 prepared from the reactive anti-D sera. These findings indicate that the RBCs of some antiglobulin-positive blood donors contain an immunoglobulin auto-antiidiotype (Ab 2) against the RBC autoantibody (Ab 1) which is demonstrable through its cross-reactivity with selected Rh(D) alloantibodies. Identification of auto-antiidiotypes in RBC autoimmunity lends support to the idiotype-antiidiotype network hypothesis of immune regulation and is consistent with the bizarre and complex serology of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The absence of clinical hemolysis in antiglobulin-positive normal blood donors suggests that immunoglobulin idiotype-antiidiotype interactions may play a role in modulating the effects of RBC autoimmunity.\r"

  ".W": "The extracellular matrix (ECM) of cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEs) was analyzed by immunoblotting and reverse fibrin autography and shown to contain type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1). Most PAI-1 in the ECM formed complexes with exogenously added tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), demonstrating that this PAI-1 was functionally active. The resulting tPA/PAI-1 complexes were recovered in the reaction solution, indicating that the PAI-1 in such complexes no longer bound to ECM. The PAI-1 could not be removed by incubating ECM in high salt (2 mol/L NaCl), sugars (1 mol/L galactose, 1 mol/L mannose), glycosaminoglycans (10 mmol/L heparin, 10 mmol/L dermatan sulfate), or epsilon-aminocaproic acid (0.1 mol/L). However, PAI-1 could be extracted from ECM by treatment with either arginine (0.5 mol/L) or potassium thiocyanate (2 mol/L), or by incubation under acidic conditions (pH 2.5). ECM depleted of PAI-1 by acid extraction was able to bind both the active and latent forms of PAI-1. In this instance, most of the bound PAI-1 did not form complexes with tPA, indicating that the latent form was not activated as a consequence of binding to ECM. Although the PAI-1 activity in conditioned medium decayed with a half-life (t 1/2) of less than 3 hours, the t 1/2 of ECM-associated PAI-1 was greater than 24 hours. These data suggest that PAI-1 is produced by cultured BAEs in an active form and is then either released into the medium where it is rapidly inactivated or into the subendothelium where it binds to ECM. The specific binding of PAI-1 to ECM protects it from this inactivation.\r"

Lactoferrin (LF) content of NG suspensions (cord blood or peripheral blood cells) was profoundly diminished (mean +/- SD 51% +/- 18% of normal) as compared with healthy adult granulocytes (AGs). Despite diminished cellular content, LF release by NG suspensions in response to fMLP was comparable to that of AGs. In contrast, LF release by NG suspensions was significantly diminished in response to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or calcium ionophor A23187 and/or during stimulated cell spreading, experimental conditions promoting overall greater LF depletion than chemotactic stimuli. In addition, NGs demonstrated an impaired capacity to upregulate fMLP receptors in response to PMA or A23187 when tested under the same experimental conditions. Baseline expression of the adhesive glycoproteins Mac-1 alpha and beta on NG surfaces was normal, but induction or upregulation of these proteins by chemotactic concentrations of fMLP, C5a as well as secretory (high) concentrations of PMA and A23187, was significantly diminished as compared with AGs. In contrast, chemotactic induction of the surface expression of the complement receptor-1 (CR-1) on NGs was normal. An impaired induction of Mac-1 alpha or beta was directly related to an impaired enhancement of adherence of NG in response to fMLP over a chemotactically relevant concentration range (10(-10) to 10(-7) mol/L). Moreover, in blocking-incubation experiments using anti-Mac-1 alpha/beta monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), significantly less inhibition of adherence by these MAbs was evident with fMLP-stimulated NG as compared with AG suspensions. Under selected chemotactic conditions, ultrastructural assessments of NGs demonstrated diminished peroxidase-negative granule loss in association with diminished granule-membrane fusion and the \"addition\" of plasma membrane. These studies suggest that abnormal expression of multiple surface determinants derived from peroxidase-negative granules or other intracellular pools may contribute to deficient chemotaxis or other inflammatory functions of NGs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Extracellular and intracellular prothrombin were detected by immunoprecipitation with affinity-purified antiprothrombin antibody. Incorporation of 35S-methionine into prothrombin was monitored by counting specific bands excised from 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Prothrombin represented 0.3% to 0.7% of total newly synthesized protein secreted into the media. Warfarin had no effect on total prothrombin synthesis (extracellular plus intracellular). However, warfarin inhibited secretion of newly synthesized prothrombin by 58% to 73% over a 2 to 4 hour period. This was accompanied by the intracellular accumulation of an immunoprecipitable species of prothrombin of 78 kd, 6 kd less than extracellular prothrombin. At the end of the 4-hour incubation with warfarin, intracellular prothrombin increased from 44% to 82% (twofold) of total prothrombin, whereas extracellular prothrombin decreased from 56% to 19% (threefold) of total prothrombin. After 24-hour incubation with warfarin, intracellular and extracellular immunoprecipitable prothrombin approached control values. Deglycosylation of extracellular and intracellular prothrombin with hydrofluoric acid (HF) resulted in a decrease in mol wt for both species to 66 kd. Endoglycosidase-H treatment, which digests \"early mannosyl\" residues, resulted in a decrease in the mol wt of the intracellular species of 8 kd with no effect on the extracellular species. Thus, the lower mol wt intracellular species that accumulates following early warfarin treatment is due to the presence of incompletely processed carbohydrate chain. The data are compatible with the hypothesis that optimum glycosylation and secretion require Vitamin K-dependent carboxylation.\r"

Labeled arachidonate was taken up rapidly and incorporated into phospholipids. Phospholipid radioactivity was preserved and spatially fixed during tissue processing for electron microscopy. Analysis of autoradiographs showed that following a brief exposure to 750 nmol/L [3H]arachidonate, there is selective labeling of an internal membrane compartment composed of the dense tubular system and the open canalicular system. The plasma membrane, platelet granules, and nonmembranous cytoplasm were not labeled. Since the open canalicular system is continuous with the plasma membrane and since phospholipids in continuous membranes are freely diffusible, our observations indicate that [3H]arachidonate was incorporated into phospholipids within the dense tubular system and not the open canalicular system. Thus, the dense tubular system, known to contain cyclooxygenase activity, incorporates arachidonate selectively following brief exposure to this fatty acid, presumably to concentrate it in proximity to enzymes for icosanoid synthesis.\r"

When corrected to a PCO2, of 40 torr (5.32 kPa) internal carotid artery blood flow was 286 +/- 16 ml min-1 (mean +/- s.e.m.). Specific CO2 reactivity (the change in flow per torr change in CO2) was 8.16 +/- 0.69 ml min-1 torr-1 which was equivalent to 2.0 +/- 0.1 per cent of the flow at 40 torr per torr change in CO2 (percentage CO2 reactivity). The mean value and the CO2 reactivity compare favourably with previously reported measurements by other techniques. These data suggest that the non-invasive measurement of internal carotid artery blood flow by Doppler ultrasound scanning is an assessment of cerebral blood flow that can be used to study both normal and pathological changes within the cerebral circulation.\r"

An animal model has been developed in the young pig which demonstrates these two complications. Five female piglets, of Landrace Large White Cross variety weighing 4.5-5.9 kg, received nutritional support for 2 weeks with a continuous infusion of TPN solution at a dose of 150 kcal kg-1 day-1. The solution was 35 per cent dextrose, 5 per cent L-amino acids with conventional electrolyte, mineral and vitamin additives. No lipid was used in the solution. Five weight-matched animals were used as controls. All animals in the TPN group developed 'sludge' in their gallbladders, decreased basal bile flow, decreased bile salt excretion and a diminished response to bile salt stimulated bile flow, as compared with controls. There was no abnormality in routine liver function tests or liver histology. It is concluded that TPN therapy in this animal model is associated with the appearance of gallbladder 'sludge', and cholestasis as demonstrated by direct bile flow studies. It is suggested that this bile flow abnormality is due to a decrease in bile salt dependent and bile salt independent fractions of canalicular bile flow. The model provides the opportunity to investigate TPN related hepatobiliary dysfunction in an animal that has similar liver function to man and comparable nutritional requirements.\r"

On each occasion the resting metabolic rate and the increase in metabolic rate after ingestion of a liquid test meal were measured by indirect calorimetry. In absolute terms the resting metabolic rate increased steadily during pregnancy but when expressed per unit of body weight no change was found. The energetic response to a mixed constituent meal was significantly reduced by 28% in the middle trimester of pregnancy. These findings suggest a possible maternal adaptation to increase energetic efficiency at a time when the energy demands of the fetus are high.\r"

Frequencies of the S2 allele were 14% for diabetics with coronary heart disease compared with 2% for non-diabetics with no clinical evidence of occlusive vascular disease. No subject with the S2 allele was detected among a further group of matched diabetics without clinical features of macrovascular disease. The results suggest that a genetic component contributes to the susceptibility to coronary heart disease in non-insulin-dependent diabetics. Whether the observed deoxyribonucleic acid variant is aetiological for atherosclerosis or in linkage disequilibrium with other atherogenic loci on chromosome 11 remains to be clarified.\r"

  ".U": "87300500\r", 
  ".W": "A total of 4470 pregnant women were screened for bacteriuria by the dipslide method and significant growth found in 226 (5.1%). In 198 cases the urine was re-examined, in 119 by using suprapubic aspiration or catheterisation (62 (52%) samples contained bacteria) and in 79 by using midstream urine samples (26 (33%) samples contained greater than 10(8) colony forming units/1), showing the maximum prevalence of confirmed bacteriuria to be 2.6%. Overt urinary tract infection developed later in four of 80 patients with proved bacteriuria who had been given antibiotics, in one of eight untreated patients with bacteriuria, in one of 110 patients with unconfirmed bacteriuria, and in one of 226 non-bacteriuric controls. A history of urinary tract infection was given by 18% of controls and 42% of women with confirmed bacteriuria. Screening for bacteriuria and treatment with antibiotics to prevent later overt infection is expensive. Whether it is worth while and cost effective depends largely on the prevalence of bacteriuria in the local population and the proportion who develop overt infection. The screening and treatment programme reported here appeared to prevent only six cases of overt infection.\r"

Twenty (2.8%) subsequently died and 654 (90.3%) were followed up at a median age of 3 years 3 months. Fifty five (7.6%) survivors had major neurodevelopmental handicaps not attributable to congenital anomalies. Increasing prevalence of major handicap was found with decreasing birth weight and gestation. Children with birth weights of less than 1251 g had a higher incidence of all major disabilities. Handicapped children with a birth weight less than 1251 g were more likely to have blindness, deafness, multiple disabilities, and more severe cerebral palsy. There were 146 (20.2%) children with minor disabilities: neurological impairments (n = 11), borderline results on psychometric testing (n = 18), visual impairments (n = 52), hearing impairments (n = 40), and speech impairments (n = 71). Children weighing less than 1251 g at birth had a higher incidence of minor visual and hearing impairments. In 389 children the mean Griffiths quotient was 101.6 (SD 17.2) (range 50-147), and 158 children had a mean Wechsler preschool and primary intelligence quotient of 101.8 (13.2) (range 56-127): these quotients did not vary with birth weight or gestation but did vary with socioeconomic group, schooling, and family structure. During the study period an improving prognosis in terms of both survival and handicap was observed in children weighing less than 1251 g at birth.\r"

  ".W": "In its first year 747 diabetics were entered into a comprehensive shared care scheme in which general practitioners agreed to follow up their own patients. After two years patients were recalled to hospital for review through a computer based recall system. Analysis of the first 209 patients reviewed showed that the recall system worked well with failure to trace only eight patients. Six new cases of foot ulcer, 15 of retinopathy, 14 of macular degeneration, and 15 of raised blood pressure requiring treatment were detected at review. Sixty four patients appeared to have had no check on their diabetes during the two years. Of the 117 with written evidence in their cooperation books that they had received some diabetic supervision, many had had no measurement of weight (32), blood pressure (49), or urine (68) or blood glucose (70), and only 55 had had foot and 65 eye examination. This erratic and generally poor standard of supervision suggests that much tighter organisation is required within each practice, with time being set aside specifically for care of diabetics. Practice nurses could have an important role in the delivery and organisation of care.\r"

Relative to the United Kingdom, there are fewer barriers of access to the courts, although the role of contingency fees has probably been exaggerated. Given the great institutional differences between the UK and the USA, the crisis seems unlikely to be replicated here unless there are further moves towards privatising both the costs of providing health care and the costs of its failures. It is concluded that a marginal change in the frequency or average cost of claims could have a serious impact on National Health Service resources, the medical defence societies, recruitment to specialties, and clinical practice. Debate over possible reforms is compromised by the dearth of good empirical data. Any changes, however, must address both the deterrence of bad practice and the compensation of injured patients.\r"

  ".W": "Recurrent cyanotic episodes associated on some occasions with loss of consciousness due to cerebral hypoxia were investigated by long term tape recordings of breathing activity, oxygen saturation, air flow, electrocardiographic activity, and in some cases electroencephalographic activity. In 51 infants and children the mechanisms for the cyanotic episodes were identified (prolonged expiratory apnoea in 45, sleep related airway obstruction in three, seizure induced apnoea in one, behaviour induced apnoea in one). In one child apnoea was suspected as being caused by suffocation (smothering) by the mother. This was confirmed after enlisting the help of the police, who undertook covert video surveillance during cyanotic episodes. Each cyanotic episode was associated with a pattern of disturbance on the multichannel tape recordings which may be pathognomonic of this type of apnoea. A second infant with cyanotic episodes in whom smothering was suspected was referred for similar investigation after the availability of video recordings became established. Maternal smothering was again supported by specific patterns on multichannel tape recordings and confirmed by video surveillance. Diagnosis by video surveillance produces unequivocal evidence in these cases and avoids the need for medical and nursing staff to confront the mother with a possibly incorrect suspicion or in a court of law.\r"

  ".W": "In a study of 2000 unselected pregnant women the development of a mature placental appearance (grade 3) on ultrasonography by 34-36 weeks' gestation, observed in 15% of cases, was associated with maternal smoking, low parity, low maternal age, and being white. These women had an increased risk of problems during labour and their babies had an increased risk of low birth weight, poor condition at birth, and perinatal death. The women were randomly allocated to two groups: in one group the result of the placental grading was reported to the clinician responsible for care; in the second the result was noted but not reported. There was a significant decrease in the risk of perinatal death in the group where the grading was known. This reduction was responsible for a difference in the principal outcome index, a heterogeneous group of measures of mortality and morbidity, but this difference was not significant. This study alone does not justify routine late scanning, and further, larger trials are required. Nevertheless, the results do provide a basis for the reporting of placental grading when ultrasound examination is performed during the third trimester.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 2176 consecutive patients who had had one previous caesarean section were studied retrospectively. A repeat elective caesarean section was performed in 395 (18.2%). Labour started spontaneously in 1363 patients, 301 of whom were given oxytocin to accelerate inert labour, and was induced by amniotomy and infusion of oxytocin in 418 women; 1618 of these 1781 patients (90.8%) delivered vaginally. Patients who had had a previous vaginal delivery were more likely to deliver vaginally again. Those women in whom the initial caesarean section had been performed during labour before the cervix was 4 cm dilated were less likely to deliver vaginally than those who had progressed further in labour or those who had had an elective caesarean section. Similarly, those who received oxytocin to stimulate inert labour were more likely to require a repeat caesarean section than those who did not. The uterine scar ruptured in only eight (0.45%) of the 1781 patients allowed into labour. The risk of rupture of the scar was not increased by the use of oxytocin alone either to induce or to accelerate labour. The combination of oxytocin to accelerate labour and epidural analgesia to provide pain relief, however, was associated with an increased incidence of scar rupture. Labour may be safely allowed in women who have had a previous caesarean section, most of whom will deliver vaginally. Induction of labour does not increase the risk of either a repeat caesarean section or rupture of a uterine scar.\r"

  ".U": "87300531\r", 
  ".W": "Patients with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus who develop proteinuria may die prematurely, whereas those who do not develop this complication have a comparatively normal life span. The excess mortality in diabetics with proteinuria is from cardiovascular as well as renal disease, but the reason is unclear. Risk factors for vascular disease were therefore assessed in 22 insulin dependent diabetics with proteinuria, but not renal failure, who were matched for sex, age, duration of diabetes, and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1) values with a similar number who had normal urinary albumin excretion rates. Macrovascular disease (ischaemic heart disease and peripheral vascular disease) was present in 10 patients with proteinuria but in only three with normal albumin excretion rates, and proliferative retinopathy was detected in 11 and four patients in the two groups. There was no significant excess of smokers in the group with proteinuria. Blood pressure was, however, higher in the patients with proteinuria--mean systolic pressure 161 (SD 18) mm Hg compared with 135 (19) mm Hg (95% confidence interval of difference between means 15 to 38 mm Hg); mean diastolic pressure 90 (SD 12) mm Hg compared with 79 (15) mm Hg (confidence interval 3 to 19 mm Hg). The concentration of serum high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol isolated by precipitation was lower in the patients with proteinuria (confidence interval 0.02 to 0.41 mmol/l). Their concentration of HDL2 cholesterol isolated by ultracentrifugation was also decreased (confidence interval 0.02 to 0.40 mmol/l), whereas HDL3 cholesterol tended to be increased (confidence interval -0.01 to 0.23 mmol/l). There was also a trend for serum cholesterol concentrations to be higher in the presence of proteinuria (confidence interval -0.39 to 1.20 mmol/l). The aggregation of risk factors for atherosclerosis in insulin dependent diabetes mellitus complicated by proteinuria helps to explain the increased prevalence of ischaemic heart disease and peripheral vascular disease reported in these patients. Early renal disease in insulin dependent diabetes may have an important role in hypertension and altered lipoprotein metabolism.\r"

  ".U": "87300532\r", 
  ".W": "The relation between diabetic microangiopathy and macroangiopathy was studied by analysing the relative mortality from cardiovascular disease in patients with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus with and without persistent proteinuria. The study group comprised 2890 diabetics diagnosed between 1933 and 1972 before the age of 31, and the study was conducted by using the linear logistic discrete failure time model. In patients with proteinuria the relative mortality from cardiovascular disease was 37 times that in the general population; in patients without proteinuria it was 4.2 times that in the general population. In both groups women had a relative mortality twice to 2.6 times that of men. In neither group was relative mortality correlated with duration of diabetes, suggesting that the association between diabetes and cardiovascular disease may be conferred by factors other than hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia. The high relative mortality from cardiovascular disease in diabetics with proteinuria indicates a strong association between diabetic microangiopathy and macroangiopathy, suggesting a common (pathogenetic?) mechanism for these two late diabetic complications.\r"

The frequency in these patients of the well defined symptoms and signs suggested to be important by the preliminary report of the Department of Health and Social Security's multicentre study of postneonatal mortality was recorded. During the study period there were 161 infants of this age in the practice, who gave rise to 69 consultations with acute illness. Thirty eight of these were given drug treatment and five were referred to a paediatric unit, one of them on social grounds. There were no infant deaths in the practice (total population 11,400), but two occurred in the Gosport area (total population 83,000). It would be unrealistic to refer all patients with any one of the symptoms and signs, even when well defined, in the age group 6 months or less. Analysis of the symptoms and signs found in those children who required admission did not show any pattern differentiating them from those who did not. Although the symptoms and signs studied are of value in assessment and should be sought in these patients, they cannot be used singly or in any pattern to indicate referral per se.\r"

Patients, their contacts, doctors and their staff, and the common good are most likely to be best served if that tradition continues to be honoured.\r"

Of the 17 cases diagnosed, five were fatal. Factors associated with a favourable outcome were a typical rash and Koplik's spots, which were accompanied by a detectable serum antibody response and the disappearance of measles giant cells from nasopharyngeal secretions. Pneumonitis severe enough to require assisted ventilation was invariably fatal. Pneumonitis and encephalitis were the main complications. Treatment included immunoglobulin, interferon, and ribavirin, but none could clearly be shown to be effective. The comparatively low mortality in this series may have been due to the extensive use of the fluorescent antibody technique in Newcastle during the study period and therefore detection of less severe cases as compared with other reports.\r"

Over the 11 years reviewed 1043 children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia were referred to these centres. Fifty one (4.9%) died while in first remission and 15 (29.4%) of these deaths were due to measles or its complications: 12 cases of pneumonia, 10 of them fatal; and six cases of encephalitis, five of them fatal and the sixth child left severely handicapped. These children would have had at least a 50% chance of long term survival. The severity of measles in the immunocompromised patient reinforces the need to improve the poor uptake of measles immunisation in Britain.\r"

  ".U": "87300587\r", 
  ".W": "The activity of the hypothalamic gonadotrophin releasing hormone pulse generator in women with regular ovulatory and anovulatory menstrual cycles was assessed to see whether changes therein are important determinants of normal and impaired ovarian function. Endogenous gonadotrophin releasing hormone secretion was inferred by measurement of the pituitary luteinising hormone response by characterisation of pulsatile luteinising hormone release over eight hours on three occasions during the course of follicular development and once during the luteal stage of the same cycles. In 13 ovulatory cycles (serum progesterone concentration greater than 25 nmol/l) confirmed by ovarian ultrasonography a pronounced variability in luteinising hormone pulse patterns among subjects was compatible with ovulation. In the luteal stage of ovulatory cycles the luteinising hormone interpeak interval (85 min, range 42-125) was significantly longer than that during the early follicular (64 min, 40-103), mid-follicular (62 min, 37-107), and late follicular (59 min, 39-80) stages of the same cycles. Thus in ovulatory cycles no increase in frequency of the gonadotrophin releasing hormone pulse generator was detected during follicular development, though this activity decreased in the luteal stage. In five late follicular stage studies in which part of the preovulatory luteinising hormone surge was captured no change in pulse frequency of luteinising hormone was detected compared with the mid-follicular stage of the same cycles or when compared with the late follicular stage of other cycles when no luteinising hormone surge was captured. Though mean luteinising hormone concentrations in luteinising hormone surge series (36 IU/l) were high, the amplitude of luteinising hormone pulses (165%) was only slightly greater than during non-surge late follicular stage studies (145%). Hence no change in hypothalamic gonadotrophin releasing hormone activity is required to generate the preovulatory discharge of luteinising hormone in man, which occurs as a result of the sensitising action of rising oestradiol concentrations on pituitary responsiveness to the same hypothalamic input signal. Luteinising hormone pulse frequency, peak amplitude, and mean serum luteinising hormone concentrations in seven anovulatory cycles (progesterone concentration less than 10 nmol/l) were not different from those at comparable stages of ovulatory cycles. These data suggest that the primary abnormality in this group of regularly menstruating anovulatory women lies in the ovary rather than in the hypothalamic control of the anterior pituitary.\r"

The results of Finnish studies indicate that random breath testing deters social drinkers and detects problem drinkers. Problem drinkers are more likely to be driving in morning traffic, when vulnerable road users such as children are about, and are more likely to be detected by random breath testing than by any other police activity. Random breath testing is a popular measure and has not only saved lives but has paid for itself by savings in health service and other resources. Introducing random breath testing into Britain could save at least 400 lives a year. The main recommendation of the Blennerhassett report of 1976--discretionary testing--is compared with the success of random breath testing in Finland.\r"

The doubly labelled water method was used to measure, simultaneously and non-invasively, energy expenditure, energy intake, milk volume intake, energy deposition, and the energy content of breast milk in 12 \"free living\" breast fed babies at 5 and 11 weeks of age. The validity of this new approach was assessed in a parallel study in 12 formula fed infants. The babies who were exclusively breast fed expended 1.28 and 1.68 MJ/day at five and 11 weeks and had intakes of 1.81 and 2.22 MJ/day; these intakes were associated with normal growth but were well below those recommended previously. At five and 11 weeks the calculated energy content of breast milk was 0.24 and 0.25 MJ/100 ml, which is substantially lower than that commonly reported in milk obtained unphysiologically by expression of the breast. These data cast doubt on the widely used published standards for infant feeding.\r"

No positive cases were present in the 54 healthy subjects of the control group. Three patients who had IgA nephropathy and IgA-antigliadin antibodies underwent jejunal biopsy, and two showed mucosal atrophy. In these two patients urinary abnormalities, together with the IgA-antigliadin antibodies, disappeared completely after three months and five months, respectively, of following a gluten free diet. Circulating IgA immune complexes were found in most patients who had coeliac disease and Berger's disease associated with IgA-antigliadin antibodies, suggesting overactivity of the B cells producing IgA in both conditions. By contrast, a circulating IgA rheumatoid factor was detectable in three of the four patients who had IgA nephropathy and asymptomatic coeliac disease but was always absent in children who had coeliac disease but did not show signs of renal disease. These results suggest that a more complex abnormality in the IgA immune response is necessary for renal disease to become manifest in patients who have gluten enteropathy.\r"

Data were obtained from 41 women with a first diagnosis of cirrhosis who had no evidence of non-alcohol-related cirrhosis; three matched controls were interviewed for each case. Significant increases in the risk of cirrhosis were detected at levels of consumption between 41 and 60 g daily; above this level a dose-response relation was observed. The risk of cirrhosis did not appear to be influenced by other nutritional factors or history of liver disease or use of hepatotoxic drugs. One per cent of Australian women consume more than 40 g alcohol daily, yet more than 90% of women identified with cirrhosis consumed alcohol at this level. Preventive interventions to reduce alcohol consumption in the small group of women who consume more than 40 g daily have the potential to reduce substantially the incidence of alcohol related cirrhosis.\r"

This relation is new evidence that poor health and physique of mothers are important determinants of the risk of stroke among their offspring.\r"

The presence of ischaemic heart disease was determined at initial examination and the men were followed up for an average of 6.2 years for morbidity and mortality from myocardial infarction and for sudden cardiac death. Non-manual workers had significantly higher scores (more type A) than manual workers and the score decreased (less type A) with increasing age. After adjustment for social class and age men with higher scores had higher prevalences of ischaemic heart disease less marked for electrocardiographic evidence and more marked for response to a chest pain questionnaire (angina or possible myocardial infarction). A man's recall of a doctor's diagnosis of ischaemic heart disease, however, did not relate to his Bortner score. There was no significant relation between the Bortner score and the attack rate or incidence of major ischaemic heart disease events. In this study type A behaviour, as measured by the Bortner questionnaire, did not predict major ischaemic heart disease events in British middle aged men.\r"

Throughout this period the incidence of lethal malformations, excluding neural tube defects, remained relatively constant at around 1.8 per 1000 births. Analysis of the malformations present in 201 lethally malformed babies showed that 147 (73%) had a disorder carrying a recurrence risk of 1% or greater. Only 7% of these malformations might have been predicted from the family history or advanced maternal age. The incidence of lethal malformations was significantly increased in the Asian population, largely because of an excess of autosomal recessive disorders. The contribution of lethal malformations to perinatal mortality has almost doubled over the past 10 years and is likely to increase despite prenatal diagnosis and improvements in obstetric and paediatric services.\r"

The primary parent tumor was shown to release more or less Type IV collagenolytic activity compared with its sublines (derived from lung nodules that developed after resection of the primary tumor). Normal baby hamster kidney and hamster embryo fibroblasts did not secrete detectable amounts of BM collagenase, whereas normal hamster lung fibroblast secreted intermediate levels of Type IV collagenase activity. The collagenase IV activity of the parent tumor and its in vivo and in vitro derived sublines was assayed in vitro and compared with the ability of the cells lines to spontaneously metastasize in vivo. No correlation between the ability to secrete type IV collagenase and metastatic propensity was detected. Although all cell lines secreted type IV collagenase, the highest activity was recorded for a nonmetastatic variant.\r"

The persistence of sensitivity to either DBM or busulfan was shown in a quantified fashion. Despite initial reports of the alleged unique effectiveness of DBM in treating chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), this study did not disclose any advantage of DBM over busulfan. Multivariate analysis investigating the importance of prognostic factors in CML indicated that age, sex, splenomegaly, and initial platelet count were important for predicting survival. Determination of such factors in CML are valuable in deciding those patients who could benefit from alternative forms of therapy. It also insures that study results are related to treatment rather than selection of patients with favorable or unfavorable prognostic factors.\r"

Blood and local cultures from two patients contained Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and local cultures from another patient grew both P. aeruginosa and Proteus rettgeri. Early recognition and aggressive antibiotic and surgical treatment with granulocyte recovery were fundamental factors in resolution of the gangrene in three of the four patients. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy, never reported in hematologic patients, was also very useful in one patient in whom the clinical course was particularly acute.\r"

  ".W": "Conventional external beam irradiation, using modern megavoltage techniques and doses that do not harm bladder function, will permanently eradicate local bladder cancer in 30% to 50% of patients, compared with 70% to 90% with cystectomy. In appropriately chosen patients, open surgery can safely provide excellent exposure for the selective delivery of more radiant energy directly to the tumor and less to the uninvolved portion of the bladder. Intraoperative radiation therapy, by either a removable radium or iridium implant or a large single dose of electrons, has been reported to be safe and can permanently cure the bladder of cancer and also preserve bladder function in more than 75% of patients with solitary tumors that invade into but not beyond the bladder muscle. With the increasing interest in and availability of intraoperative radiation therapy in the US, this curative and bladder-sparing treatment for operable patients with bladder cancer invading the trigone is appropriate for careful clinical trial.\r"

Elective pelvic node irradiation was given to 247 patients (45%). Follow-up for all surviving patients ranged from 16 to 201 months (median, 6.5 years; mean, 7 years). The 5-, 10-, and 15-year uncorrected actuarial survival rates were 72%, 47%, and 27%, respectively. Disease-free survival rates were 59%, 46%, and 40% at the corresponding times. Actuarial local control rates were 88%, 81%, and 75% at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. Disease-free survival was adversely affected by high pathologic grade, disease fixed to the pelvic sidewall, invasion of the bladder, prior transurethral resection, hydronephrosis, and elevated serum levels of prostatic acid phosphatase and creatinine. Elective pelvic node irradiation did not improve the outcome. Complications of treatment were acceptable: minor anorectal and/or urinary symptoms, 11%; mild to moderate complications, 19%; serious problems requiring surgery, 3%. It is concluded that localized, high-energy external beam irradiation provides excellent local control of disease, low morbidity, and 5-, 10-, and 15-year survival rates that have not been rivaled by other treatment.\r"

This represents all the gliomas examined post mortem over 25 years at one hospital. Two hundred and one cases (85%) were apparently solitary tumors; of the 40 cases with multiple tumor foci, 23 (9.5%) were true multicentric gliomas. After excluding cases in which there was concomitant disease (neurofibromatosis, tuberose sclerosis, or multiple sclerosis), 18 cases of multicentric tumor (7.5%) remained. Multicentric tumors with different histologic appearances accounted for 2.9% of the series. Celloidin-embedded whole brain sections proved invaluable for the detection of microscopic neoplastic foci and unsuspected diffuse spread. The estimated incidence of multiplicity in gliomas is higher than in most series, but the findings suggest that detection of multifocal neoplastic change in these tumors is directly related to the extent to which the brain is sampled, and that figures obtained in this study may well underestimate the true incidence.\r"

  ".W": "Ewing's sarcoma (ES) of bone may occasionally display rosette-like textures mimicking Homer-Wright ones, as seen in neuroectodermic neoplasms (neuroblastoma, peripheral neuroepithelioma). Of a group of 39 cases of ES, reviewed with electron microscopic study, the authors have isolated five atypical ES, which histologically also possessed neuroectodermic traces. These tumors were composed of small round blue cells with rosette-like figures and cytoplasmic glycogen. The immunohistochemical analysis showed positivity for neuron-specific enolase (NSE) as well as for HNK-1 (leu-7) monoclonal antibody. Electron microscopic examination confirmed the tumor cell as being of small round type, with a dense chromatine pattern and the presence of isolated dendritic processes, as well as synaptic-like buttons; intermediate filaments, neurotubuli, and dense-core neurosecretory granules also were seen. Moreover, in two cases basement-like condensations surrounded some cells. Scanning electron microscopic study in one case confirmed the presence of rosette-like figures and cell elongations with short dendritic projections of the cytoplasm. Clinically and radiologically these cases showed features similar to ES of bone; one case, located in the chest wall, had a local relapse after treatment, with the histologic features of a pleomorphic neuroblastoma. The authors conclude that these tumors resemble closely immature neuroepithelioma of soft tissue but, being primary to bone, are superimposable on those described as \"neuroectodermal tumors of bone.\"\r"

A statistical correlation was found between tumor size and acute phase protein level, which, however, was ascribed to nonspecific inflammation in the tissues surrounding the tumor. The patients who subsequently could not be radically treated by surgery had higher concentrations of orosomucoid and ceruloplasmin than the radically treated patients. No difference in acute phase protein concentration was found between benign and malignant disease. The glycan-dependent microheterogeneity of orosomucoid and ceruloplasmin was analyzed by crossed affinoimmunoelectrophoresis with lectins, and the patterns of the patients with benign inflammation and malignant disease were different. The heterogeneity of ceruloplasmin was also analyzed by crossed immunoelectrophoresis without lectin. This analysis, combined with the total serum concentration of ceruloplasmin, made it possible to discriminate the 54 cases of malignancy from the 46 cases of nonmalignancy with a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 93%. It is suggested that the simple electrophoretic analyses of (micro-)heterogeneity is a valuable supplement to the acute phase profile in isolating high-risk patients and in monitoring radically treated cancer patients for relapse.\r"

  ".U": "87302095\r", 
  ".W": "To test the ability of regenerated endothelium to evoke endothelium-dependent relaxations, male Yorkshire pigs underwent balloon endothelial denudation of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery. Endothelium-dependent responses were examined in vitro, in rings of coronary segments taken from the denuded area or from the proximal left circumflex coronary artery. The experiments were performed 8 days or 4 weeks after the denudation. Endothelial regrowth was confirmed by histologic examination 8 days after the denudation and by demonstrating the presence of endothelium-dependent relaxations to bradykinin; at that time aggregating platelets evoked normal endothelium-dependent responses. However, 4 weeks after the denudation, the relaxations to aggregating platelets were markedly depressed although continuous endothelial lining was present, and the endothelium-dependent responses to bradykinin, adenosine diphosphate, the Ca2+-ionophore A23187, platelet activating factor, and thrombin were unaltered. Four weeks after denudation, endothelium-dependent relaxations to serotonin were depressed. Higher concentration of serotonin induced endothelium-dependent contractions in quiescent rings with regenerated endothelium, suggesting that regenerated endothelial cells may produce endothelium-derived constricting factor(s) and release less endothelium-derived relaxing factor(s) when exposed to the monoamine. The endothelium-dependent relaxation to serotonin was not reduced by the S2-serotonergic antagonist ketanserin but prevented by the combined S1- and S2-serotonergic blocker methiothepin. The platelet-induced relaxation was due to released serotonin and adenine nucleotides in control left circumflex coronary arteries, but in left anterior descending coronary artery with regenerated endothelium, it was due solely to the latter. The platelet-induced contractions were due to activation of receptors on the smooth muscle cells. Four weeks after denudation, regenerated endothelial cells were morphologically different from native cells; they were elongated and cuboidal, and the number of the cells had increased twofold. At this state, eccentric myointimal thickening was present in the previously denuded portion. These experiments indicate that the protective role of endothelial cells against the vasoconstriction induced by aggregating platelets is depressed in the chronic regenerated state. A lack of responsiveness to serotonin appears to be the cause for the endothelial dysfunction.\r"

Treatment with cimetidine potentiated contraction in the strips with intact and damaged endothelium to a similar extent and attenuated relaxation. Removal of endothelium abolished relaxation and potentiated contraction in the cimetidine-treated strips. Methylene blue increased the contractile response to histamine in the strips with endothelium but did not alter the response in the damaged-endothelium strips. Histamine-induced relaxations in the intact strips were suppressed or abolished by treatment with ETYA, AA861, a lipoxygenase inhibitor, and by chlorpheniramine but were unaffected by indomethacin. Chlorpheniramine also abolished amine-induced contraction. It may be concluded that histamine-induced contraction in human coronary arteries is mediated by H1 receptors in smooth muscle, and relaxation is mediated by H2 receptors in smooth muscle and H1 receptors in endothelium. Also, stimulation of the endothelial H1 receptor liberates vasodilator substance and possibly activates smooth muscle guanylate cyclase to accumulate cellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate.\r"

Since the discovery of compactin, the first HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, by Endo et al. in 1976, several other inhibitors have been described. Those that have been investigated in the clinic include mevastatin (compactin), lovastatin (mevinolin), simvastatin (synvinolin), eptastatin (CS-514, SQ-31,000), and SRI-62320. These compounds are competitive inhibitors, with Ki values of the hydroxyacid forms of around 10(-9) M. Lovastatin (mevinolin, Mevacor), which is in the late stages of clinical development and has been administered to over 1000 subjects for up to 4 years, is the inhibitor on which the most information is available. It is given in single or divided doses of 20 to 80 mg/day, and is a very effective and usually well-tolerated lipid-lowering agent. At 40 mg bid, lovastatin produces the following approximate mean changes: total plasma cholesterol, -33%; low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, -40%; very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, -35%; plasma triglycerides, -25%; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, +10%; apolipoprotein B, -20%. The substantial reduction in both LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B (the principal protein component of LDL) indicates a reduction in the number of circulating LDL particles. The mechanism probably involves both decreased LDL production and increased LDL clearance.\r"

This region was selected as a representative area where the national CCP was implemented effectively. Comparison with a serologic survey performed in the same region before the CCP disclosed a reduction in seropositive subjects from 47.8% to 17.1% (p less than .001), most marked amongst children and teenagers from 29.9% to 1.9%, suggesting that transmission of the disease had diminished. Similar seropositivity changes after the CCP were observed nationwide. Because decreased superinfection would also be expected to occur, we tried to ascertain whether the clinical outcome of seropositive individuals living in Roscio county had improved. The mean age of seropositive subjects between both surveys increased significantly from 34.9 +/- 17.3 to 46.7 +/- 15.1 years (p less than .001). Additionally, we examined clinically and obtained electrocardiograms from 775 seropositive subjects. They were classified as asymptomatic (group A, n = 614) or as symptomatic, having mild-to-moderate heart symptoms (group B, n = 99) or having advanced congestive heart failure (group C, n = 62). Their electrocardiograms were compared with those of 923 seronegative subjects collected simultaneously and with published data obtained before the CCP. Comparison of the age-related rates of electrocardiographic abnormalities of seropositive individuals before and after the CCP showed that they did not differ significantly by linear regression analysis, by the Kruskal-Wallis test, or by the normal approximation to the binomial distribution.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Although positron-emission tomography (PET) with labeled fatty acid delineates infarct size and permits qualitative assessment of fatty acid utilization, quantification of oxidative metabolism is limited by complex alterations in the pattern of utilization of fatty acid during ischemia and reperfusion. Because metabolism of acetate by myocardium is less complex than that of glucose or palmitate, we characterized kinetics of utilization of radiolabeled acetate in 37 isolated rabbit hearts perfused with modified Krebs-Henseleit buffer and performed a pilot tomographic study in man. Results of initial experiments with carbon-14-labeled acetate (14C-acetate) indicated that the steady-state extraction fraction of acetate averaged 61.5 +/- 4.0% in control hearts (n = 4), 93.6 +/- 0.9% in hearts rendered ischemic (n = 4), and 54.8 +/- 4.0% in hearts reperfused after 60 min of ischemia (n = 3). Oxidation of 14C-acetate, assessed from the rate of efflux of 14CO2 in the venous effluent, correlated closely with the rate of oxygen consumption under diverse metabolic conditions (r = .97, p less than .001). In addition, no significant differences were observed between rates of efflux of total 14C in all chemical species (reflecting total clearance of tracer from myocardium) and efflux of 14CO2. Clearance of 11C-acetate, measured externally with gamma probes in normal and ischemic myocardium, correlated closely with clearance of 14C-acetate measured directly in the effluent (r = .99, p less than .001) and with overall myocardial oxygen consumption (r = .95, p less than .001). Accumulation and clearance of 11C-acetate from human myocardium with PET demonstrated kinetics comparable to those seen with radiolabeled acetate in vitro. Thus externally detectable clearance of 11C-acetate provides a quantitative index of myocardial oxidative metabolism despite variation in the patterns of intermediary metabolism that confounds interpretation of results with conventionally used tracers such as glucose and fatty acid.\r"

ANP was infused as a bolus directly into the left circumflex coronary artery in doses ranging from 0.05 to 5 micrograms in nine open-chest, anesthetized dogs. Coronary flow was measured with an electromagnetic flowmeter. Regional transmural myocardial blood flow and distribution were measured with 11.3 +/- 0.25 micron radionuclide-labeled microspheres. No significant change was noted in systemic hemodynamics (heart rate, arterial pressure, left atrial pressure, or cardiac output) during the course of the studies. ANP produced a transient vasodilatation of coronary resistance vessels and increased flow by 41% after both the 2.5 and 5 micrograms doses. The vasodilatation occurred uniformly throughout the ventricular wall so that the endocardial/epicardial flow ratio remained constant. There was no evidence of coronary vasoconstriction. The peak vasodilatation response occurred 28 +/- 7 sec after the beginning of the infusion of ANP and lasted approximately 3 min. These data support the hypothesis that ANP administration is associated with a vasodilator response in the coronary resistance vessels that may be modulated through either the release of another vasodilator substance or another mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the response of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) to rapidly changing right atrial pressures in vivo, we measured ANP levels in 15 patients undergoing the Fontan procedure and compared them with control levels in nine patients undergoing cardiac surgery for lesions not associated with atrial hypertension. There were no significant differences in preoperative ANP levels: 57 +/- 15 pg/ml for patients undergoing the Fontan procedure, 43 +/- 8 pg/ml for control patients. There was no significant change in ANP during surgery or in the postoperative period in control patients. In contrast, ANP increased significantly to 333 +/- 70 pg/ml (p less than .0025) after establishment of right atrial-pulmonary artery continuity with the Fontan procedure and was related to right atrial pressure, which increased from 5 mm Hg before to 14 mm Hg after the Fontan procedure (p less than .001). There was no significant change in left atrial pressure. During the first postoperative day, ANP levels fell to 141 +/- 34 pg/ml (p less than .01) but later increased to 290 +/- 80 pg/ml (p less than .025), a finding that may suggest depletion of a readily releasable intracellular pool of ANP before mobilization of a storage pool. There was no direct relationship between ANP levels and effusions in patients undergoing the Fontan procedure. Pharmacologically significant increases in ANP occur in patients undergoing the Fontan procedure, correlating with increased right atrial pressures, but the relationship between ANP and the fluid derangements after the procedure remains unclear.\r"

  ".W": "To see whether or not the fibrin-stabilizing factor is involved in the pathogenesis of renal damage, we analyzed by IF the glomerular deposition of factor XIII (subunits A and S) in 161 patients with various renal diseases. In 4 out of 5 cases of thrombotic microangiopathy (80%), F XIII deposits were found in a continuous subendothelial pattern, in association with deposition of fibrinogen and FDP, suggesting the occurrence of intraglomerular coagulation. In 22 out of 45 patients with membranous GN (idiopathic or SLE-associated), F XIII deposits were found along the capillary walls in a subepithelial location. These findings were not correlated with the presence of particular histological or clinical features, nor with IF positive for fibrinogen, FDP and factor VIII, suggesting alternative pathways of fibrin formation or local collagen synthesis. Finally, in proliferative GN, either idiopathic (acute post-infectious and membranoproliferative) or systemic (SLE and vasculitis), as in other glomerular and non-glomerular diseases, the presence of F XIII deposits was negligible, even in cases positive for fibrinogen, FDP and factor VIII.\r"

  ".W": "X-linked hypophosphatemic (Hyp) mice are a model of human sex-linked vitamin D-resistant rickets. Young adult Hyp mice are characterized by osteomalacia and decreased bone mineral content. However, older heterozygous Hyp female mice increase in bone mineral content with age so that by one year of age the bone mass/mm femoral length equals or exceeds normal females. To test for the occurrence of this mineral accretion in Hyp male mice and in homozygous Hyp female mice, femora from all 3 Hyp genotypes as well as normal male and female mice were analyzed at various ages from one to 52 weeks of age. Compared to normal mice, all three Hyp genotypes were depressed in bone ash, femoral length, and ash/length ratio at 13 weeks of age. After that age the femora of both heterozygous and homozygous Hyp females showed a slow mineral accretion and, by 52 weeks of age, a normal ash/length ratio. However, the femora of Hyp males, as well as those of normal males, failed to increase in bone mineral content or ash/length ratio after 13 weeks of age. The differences between male and female Hyp mice could not be explained by differences in the plasma levels of calcium, phosphate, or alkaline phosphatase. Increased bone mineral content in older Hyp mice was seen in both heterozygous and homozygous females but not in hemizygous males. Thus, the basis for this increase is not incomplete dominance of the Hyp gene in females nor the Lyon hypothesis. The accretion of mineral in older female Hyp mice despite lifelong reduced plasma phosphate levels suggests that there are factors other than phosphate that also regulate mineral accretion in this bone disease.\r"

Throat cultures were routine 2 to 7 days after the start of therapy and 2 days and 14 days after the end of therapy. The bacterial cure rates were 85 percent (51/60) for cefuroxime axetil, and 88 percent (29/33) for phenoxymethyl penicillin treated patients.

Meningococci were grown from eye exudates of all three infants and from the blood of one. Since Neisseria species other than gonococci can sometimes cause neonatal ophthalmia, an etiologic diagnosis should not be made until microbiologic identification is complete. Before the results of definitive bacteriologic studies are known, care should be taken in discussing the cause of the infection with family members and in planning their medical management. Since systemic infections may occur in some infants with ophthalmia due to Neisseria species, blood and spinal fluid in addition to eye exudate cultures may be indicated, and patients should be managed with parenteral antibiotics.\r"

The level of consciousness was monitored by a modified Glasgow Coma Scale, and the response to the intravenous administration of up to 1 mg flumazenil or placebo was followed for periods between 1 and 24 hours. The increases in the glasgow coma scale at 5 minutes in the flumazenil-treated group were significant in the group as a whole (+4.9; P less than 0.005), in those who had taken benzodiazepines only (+5.3; P = 0.005), and in those with mixed overdosages (+5.6; P less than 0.005). There were no significant changes in the placebo-treated group. Some patients with overdosage with ethanol also responded to flumazenil, but there was no effect in patients with overdosage of barbiturates alone or tricyclic antidepressants. Flumazenil was well tolerated although three patients had mild withdrawal reactions. The need for intensive physiologic support was avoided in several cases, and the differential diagnosis of the unconscious patient was facilitated.\r"

The ratio of 1,2-glyceryl dinitrate to 1,3-glyceryl dinitrate (dinitrate ratio) was determined for each subject after each dose and was found to vary with route of administration. Dinitrate ratios were 7.36, 4.60, 3.86, and 1.99 for intravenous, sublingual, topical, and oral doses, respectively. Nonspecific metabolism of nitroglycerin would result in twice as much of the 1,2-dinitrate as the 1,3-dinitrate (i.e., a dinitrate ratio of 2.0, such as that produced after oral administration). A high ratio (e.g., after intravenous administration) indicates that the metabolism was more specific. These results indicate that metabolite formation depends on route of administration, implying different metabolic specificity of enzymes in the gut, liver, skin, sublingual mucosa, and blood vessels.\r"

The plasma drug disappearance curve was triphasic, with a t1/2 alpha of 8 +/- 5 minutes, t1/2 beta of 102 +/- 48 minutes, and t1/2 gamma of 15.2 +/- 5.7 hours. The AUC was 373 +/- 336 (micrograms/ml) hr (normalized to a dose of 200 mg/m2), volume of distribution by the area method (Varea) was 25.2 +/- 16.1 L/m2, total clearance (CL) was 14 +/- 8 ml/min/m2, and renal clearance (CLR) was 8 +/- 6 ml/min/m2. Four patients who received 190 to 200 mg/m2 did not develop severe toxicity. However, three patients who received 120 to 210 mg/m2 developed severe myelosuppression, skin rash, and stomatitis. This latter group had significantly longer terminal half-lives, greater AUCs, smaller Vareas, and lower rates of CL and CLR. One of these patients received an unusually large total amount of trimetrexate (470 mg) because of his obesity. The remaining two patients had renal problems. One developed toxicity despite having received a reduced dose (120 mg/m2) because of impaired renal function. The other patient, with normal renal function, had ascites and had undergone a unilateral nephrectomy for renal carcinoma. These data suggest that prolonged exposure to high trimetrexate levels may lead to increased toxicity. Dosage adjustment may have to be considered for patients who have renal dysfunction.\r"

Among 1,941 patients who only received monitoring services on admission to the ICU, 1,358 (70 percent) were predicted to have less than a 10 percent risk of requiring subsequent active ICU treatment. Only 58 (4.3 percent) of these low-risk patients actually received active treatment. The identification of low-risk patients was equally accurate in estimation and validation data sets. Our methods should allow physicians and hospitals to assess their current ICU utilization and, if appropriate, guide reductions in use.\r"

  ".W": "Studies were performed measuring parameters of respiratory and circulatory function at rest and during maximum tolerable constant work rate treadmill exercise in 16 clinically well patients who had undergone heart-lung transplantation for end stage pulmonary hypertension. Ten patients were studied before and within eight weeks following transplantation. Long-term function with exercise was further evaluated with follow up studies at one year (n = 10) and two years (n = 6), posttransplantation. Posttransplant gas exchange and ventilation during exercise are essentially normal with neither being limiting to maximal exercise. Exercise capacity is significantly improved posttransplant, primarily as a result of improvement in the circulation over that found pretransplant in uncorrected pulmonary hypertension. Although improved, circulatory limitations of maximal exercise may still persist. Cardiorespiratory function at maximum tolerable exercise is well maintained following heart-lung transplantation for at least two years, providing no complications occur. This suggests that denervation of the heart and lungs, disruption of the bronchial circulation and pulmonary lymphatics, and the graft ischemia encountered at the time of transplantation impose no serious limitations on long-term cardiopulmonary function. The overall functional capacities of the transplanted heart and lungs are more than adequate for meeting the activities of normal life.\r"

To evaluate this relationship in chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), we studied eight patients with chronic CHF at baseline and during treatment with nitroglycerin. The resting DO2 and VO2 were 10.7 +/- 2.3 ml/min/kg and 3.8 +/- 0.87 ml/min/kg, respectively. In our eight patients, we found a significant relationship between changes in VO2 and in DO2 (delta VO2 = 0.16 + 0.34 X delta DO2, r = 0.84, n = 29). There was no significant relationship between DO2 and mixed venous oxygen tension (PvO2, r = 0.16), nor was there a significant relationship between cardiac output (Qt) and PvO2 (r = 0.21). We conclude that in patients with chronic CHF, changes in VO2 appear to be dependent on changes in DO2. This may represent an adaptive tissue response to chronically reduced systemic oxygen transport.\r"
