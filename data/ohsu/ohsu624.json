  ".W": "Genetic distances among speakers of the European language families were computed by using gene-frequency data for human blood group antigens, enzymes, and proteins of 26 genetic systems. Each system was represented by a different subset of 3369 localities across Europe. By subjecting the matrix of distances to numerical taxonomic procedures, we obtained a grouping of the language families of Europe by their genetic distances as contrasted with their linguistic relationships. The resulting classification largely reflects geographic propinquity rather than linguistic origins. This is evidence for the primary importance of short-range interdemic gene flow in shaping the modern gene pools of Europe. Yet, some language families--i.e., Basque, Finnic (including Lappish), and Semitic (Maltese)--have distant genetic relationships with their geographic neighbors. These results indicate that European gene pools still reflect the remote origins of some ethnic units subsumed by these major linguistic groups.\r"

The contour of the foot widens with age and may have increased forefoot height in the presence of toe deformities. Sensory acuity diminishes, as does joint mobility, muscle-force production, and ability to withstand stress. The elderly person's gait is slower and less forceful, with shorter strides. Visual loss affects footwear donning and toenail trimming. Older individuals on a limited income are less likely to have appropriate shoes and hose. Preventive care begins with good hygiene and continues with selection of suitable hosiery and shoes. Conservative management of the podiatric conditions most often seen in geriatric patients (eg, metatarsalgia and hallux valgus) should be based on relating the pathomechanics of the disorder to the options available in shoe selection, modification, and insert design.\r"

The patient was a 69-year-old man with diabetes mellitus for 24 years, insensitive feet, and a right plantar ulcer at the first metatarsal head for 21 months. He had a fixed equinus and rear-foot varus deformity, which seemed to place increased pressure on his forefoot. The patient was treated with total contact casting and showed progressive healing until he refused additional casting. One week later, the ulcer was considerably larger. He consented to resume casting, and the ulcer was completely healed in 85 days from the initial treatment. We provided the patient with extra-depth shoes with rigid rocker-bottom soles and a polyethylene-lined ankle-foot orthosis. The ulcer remained healed at one-week and six-month follow-up visits. The primary cause of diabetic plantar ulcers is often excessive pressure on an insensitive foot, and physical therapists should utilize biomechanical principles to reduce these excessive plantar pressures.\r"

Cleavable affinity labels were used to selectively introduce a thiol into the combining site of the immunoglobulin A MOPC 315. This thiol acted both as a nucleophile to accelerate ester thiolysis 60,000-fold and as a handle for selectively derivatizing the antibody with additional functional groups. For example, derivatization of the antibody with a fluorophore made possible a direct spectroscopic assay of antibody-ligand complexation. This chemistry should not only extend our ability to exploit antibody specificity in chemical catalysis, diagnostics, and therapeutics, but may also prove generally applicable to the functional modification of other proteins for which detailed structural information is unavailable.\r"

Thus, the low molecular weight material derived from the I-Ad isotype was efficient in inhibiting the binding of 125I-labeled I-Ad-specific peptide to I-Ad, but did not significantly inhibit the binding of an I-Ed-specific peptide to I-Ed; the reciprocal isotype-specific inhibition was demonstrated with low molecular weight material derived from I-Ed. The inhibitory material was predominantly peptide in nature, as shown by its susceptibility to protease digestion. It was heterogeneous as measured by gel filtration (mean molecular weight approximately 3000), and when characterized by high-performance liquid chromatography, it eluted over a wide concentration of solvent. Such self peptide-MHC complexes may have broad significance in the biology of T cell responses, including generation of the T cell repertoire, the specificity of mixed lymphocyte responses, and the immune surveillance of self and nonself antigens in peripheral lymphoid tissues.\r"

Because most poisonous plant alkaloids are intensely bitter, bitter taste warns animals of potentially hazardous foods. To investigate the mechanism of bitter taste transduction, a preparation of dissociated rat taste cells was developed that can be studied with techniques designed for single-cell measurements. Denatonium, a very bitter substance, caused a rise in the intracellular calcium concentration due to release from internal stores in a small subpopulation of taste cells. Thus, the transduction of bitter taste may occur via a receptor-second messenger mechanism leading to neurotransmitter release and may not involve depolarization-mediated calcium entry.\r"

When expressed in Escherichia coli and purified, the Xenopus FGF induced mesoderm in animal cell blastomeres as measured by muscle actin expression. Immunoblots with an antibody to a Xenopus FGF peptide show that the oocyte and early embryo contain a store of the FGF polypeptide at high enough concentrations to induce mesoderm. The presence of FGF in the oocyte, together with the apparent lack of a secretory signal sequence in the protein, suggest that the regulation of mesoderm induction may involve novel mechanisms that occur after the translation of FGF.\r"

Thus, mutations of developmental origin can be reconstituted in vitro by fusing mutant lymphoid cells with differentiated cell lines of the proper lineage.

Anion exchange chromatography separated from normal neutrophil cytosol a 47-kilodalton neutrophil cytosol factor, NCF-1, that restored activity to defective neutrophil cytosol from most patients with autosomally inherited CGD in a cell-free O2.--generating system. A 65-kilodalton factor, NCF-2, restored activity to defective neutrophil cytosol from one patient with autosomal CGD. NCF-1, NCF-2, and a third cytosol fraction, NCF-3, were inactive alone or in pairs, but together replaced unfractionated cytosol in cell-free O2.- generation. Neutrophils deficient in NCF-1, but not NCF-2, did not phosphorylate the 47-kilodalton protein. It is proposed that NCF-1, NCF-2, and NCF-3 are essential for generation of O2.- by phagocytic cells and that genetic abnormalities of these cytosol components can result in the CGD phenotype.\r"

This expression system allows the simultaneous characterization of ligand-gated ion channels by electrophysiology and by pharmacology. Thus, coexpression of the alpha and beta subunits of the GABAA receptor generated GABA-gated chloride channels and binding sites for GABAA receptor ligands. Channels consisting of only alpha or beta subunits could also be detected. These homomeric channels formed with reduced efficiencies compared to the heteromeric receptors. Both of these homomeric GABA-responsive channels were potentiated by barbiturate, indicating that sites for both ligand-gating and allosteric potentiation are present on receptors assembled from either subunit.\r"

The purpose of this in vitro study was to quantitatively determine three dimensional movements of the occiput-C1 and C1-C2 joints. Ten fresh cadaveric whole cervical spine specimens (occiput to C7) were studied, using well-established techniques to document the movements in flexion, extension, left and right lateral bending, and left and right axial rotation. Pure moments of a maximum of 1.5 N-m were applied incrementally, and three-dimensional movements of the bones were recorded using stereophotogrammetry. Each moment was applied individually and in three load/unload cycles. The motion measurements were made on the third load cycle. Parameters of neutral zone, elastic zone, and range of motion were computed. Neutral zones for flexion/extension, right/left lateral bending, and right/left axial rotation were, respectively: 1.1, 1.5, and 1.6 (occiput-C1); and 3.2, 1.2, and 29.6 degrees (C1-C2). Ranges of motion for flexion, extension, lateral bending (one side), and axial rotation (one side) were, respectively: 3.5, 21.0, 5.5, and 7.2 degrees (occiput-C1 joint) and 11.5, 10.9, 6.7, and 38.9 degrees (C1-C2 joint). The greatest intervertebral motion in the spine was axial rotation at the C1-C2 joint, with the neutral zone constituting 75% of this motion.\r"

All others attained solid union with appropriate immobilization. Morphologically, one presented with an impacted fracture of the occipital condyle (Type I), one with a basilar skull fracture that included an occipital condyle fracture (Type II), and four had avulsion fractures of the occipital condyle. The latter are potentially unstable since loss of integrity of alar ligaments may coexist. Type I and II are stable, and the authors recommend treatment with a semiconstrained cervical orthosis. Type III injuries, which are potentially unstable, require rigid immobilization.\r"

In the tracer study reported, lanthanum penetrated through the marginal glia to the normal and pathologic spinal cord. Reaction products of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were mainly in the extracellular space of the normal spinal cord. The pathologic spinal cord, however, allowed the passage of HRP into the parenchyma through the extracellular space of the marginal glia. Consequently, the extracellular space of the spinal cord surface constitutes a pathway for cerebrospinal fluid solutes. Either metrizamide or iotrol thus diffuses into the spinal cord from the subarachnoid space.\r"

We retrospectively reviewed 236 patients with 319 cervical spine injuries. Fractures included 50 of the dens, 21 hangman, 4 Jefferson, 29 burst, 24 compression, 32 corner/teardrop, 65 facet, 24 lamina, and nine pedicle. Dislocations included one occipitoatlantal, two atlantoaxial rotatory, and 28 facet. Pleuridirectional tomography performed in 137 cases and computerized tomography was performed in 26. The cases were divided into three groups according to the significance of their radiographic findings: Group I: no additional information was added by the additional radiographic studies compared to the plain radiographs. Group II: the additional radiographic studies changed the extent or type of injuries seen on the plain radiographs. Group III: plain radiographs were negative. The abnormalities were only found on the additional radiographic studies. Results of 137 patients undergoing tomography: 62 were in group I, 64 were in group II, and 11 were in group III. Of the 26 patients undergoing computerized tomography, 13 were in group I, 13 were in group II, and no patients were in group III. Specific fracture types were reviewed according to the distribution of the three groups. We concluded that pleuridirectional tomography appears to be particularly advantageous in patients with injuries involving the facets. Computerized tomography appears to add the most additional information in patients with laminar and posterior element fractures and C1 fractures. We feel that timely and accurate diagnosis of cervical spine injuries is essential.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Roentgenographic lateral views were taken in active flexion and extension as well as in passive maximal flexion and extension. Measurements using the techniques of Penning and Buetti-Bauml were made by three observers independently. There was a highly significant difference between the active and passive segmental ranges of motion in healthy adults. Based on the normal values obtained in this study, 19 hypermobile segments could be diagnosed during the active examination, while 31 hypermobile segments were found during the passive examination. In addition, the active examination found 60 hypomobile segments, while the passive examination showed only 43 hypomobile segments. The Penning Method of measurement was found to be more reliable than that of Buetti-Bauml. If possible, the functional roentgenogram examination of the cervical spine in the sagittal plane should be performed by including passive movement and the range of motion should be compared with the normal values obtained by passive examination.\r"

Recognition is based on a detailed history, weakness of neck extension, electrodiagnostic studies, and muscle biopsy. A mildly elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) was the only consistent laboratory finding. Appropriate surgical correction of severe deformity involves anterior surgical release of contracted sternomastoid muscles, halo-dependent traction, posterior vertebral inferior facet resection, and spinal fusion over an adequate length, supplemented with internal fixation. Where extension correction involves extensive vertebral body separation anteriorly, additional anterior keystone strut grafting is indicated.\r"

The authors report on 47 cases of TRD (35% of all severe lower cervical spine injuries) (follow-up: 6 months to 7 years). TRD occurs only when two lesions are present: an anterior lesion in the disk and ligaments, and a posterior lesion of the articular process, as the authors confirmed earlier in an experimental study on monkeys and specimens. Depending on the nature of the posterior lesions, three anatomoclinical types occur: 1) posterior capsular lesions cause unilateral facet dislocation (UFD): ten cases; 2) bony lesions of the articular process cause unilateral facet fracture (UFF): 28 cases; 3) double bony lesions, which can set free the articular facets, are called fracture separation of the articular pillar (FSAP): nine cases. The common radiographic characteristic of these three lesions is slight anterior displacement (or antero-listhesis), which is well seen on the lateral film; only tomograms or CT scans can show the posterior lesions. Instability, as defined by Roy-Camille, Denis and our experiments, was obvious on X-rays: soon after the injury, for UFD, and some time later, for 18 UFF and three FSAP. Statistically, 25% of all cases of TRD are associated with another traumatic lesion of the lower or upper cervical spine. Clinically, there is a 30% rate of radicular complications in TRD: this figure is higher than that of other injury types.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cervical laminoplasty, until recently, has only been performed for myelopathy secondary to ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) or cervical stenosis. The purpose of this report is to compare the results and complications of 45 patients with a least a 2-year follow-up who had undergone anterior fusion, cervical laminectomy, or cervical laminoplasty for the surgical management of multiple level cervical radiculopathy due to cervical spondylosis. 18 patients (58 levels) underwent anterior fusion, 12 patients (38 levels) had a cervical laminectomy, and 15 patients (57 levels) underwent a cervical laminoplasty. Roentgenograms indicated spinal stenosis (sagittal diameter less than 12 mm) at 28 levels (15 patients) for the anterior fusion group, 14 levels (9 patients) in the laminectomy group, and 24 levels (13 patients) in the laminoplasty group. Subluxation (2 mm or less) was present at 14 levels (13 patients) in the anterior fusion group, nine levels (9 patients) in the laminectomy group, and 15 levels (8 patients) in the laminoplasty group.

They were found to have an increased prevalence of lower cervical spondylosis that significantly correlated with physical findings consistent with cervical myelopathy.

This type of myelopathy hand they have termed \"amyotrophic type of myelopathy hand.\" Because it is similar to the hand of a patient suffering from motor neuron disease, and yet is treatable, the authors thought it worthwhile to report this type of hand in detail. The main clinical features are localized wasting and weakness of the extrinsic and intrinsic hand muscles, but not accompanied by either sensory loss or spastic quadriparesis. For an accurate diagnosis, attention should be paid to the narrow anteroposterior (AP) canal diameter of the cervical spine (less than 13mm), multisegmental spondylosis in C5-6 and C6-7 disc levels and a reduced transectional area of the spinal cord at the C7, C8, or T1 spinal cord segments. To date the authors have seen 15 patients with this hand; seven underwent either spondylectomy or laminoplasty. In six patients who were satisfied with surgical results, recovery from muscle wasting and weakness was seen.\r"

Cervical spinal segments and C4-5 functional spinal units were tested statically, and C4-5 functional spinal units were tested cyclically in evaluation of 1) the intact cervical spine, 2) Rogers' wiring method, 3) Bohlman's triple-wire technique, 4) sublaminar wiring, 5) anterior cervical plate instrumentation, and 6) posterior hook plate stabilization. Anterior cervical plate instrumentation proved inadequate, and was the least rigid, with axial and flexural loading (P less than 0.05). There was no significant difference between each of the three posterior wiring methods, and all generally restored stability to equal that of the uninjured intact cervical spine. Posterior hook plating with an interspinous bone graft serving as an extension block was the most effective method in reducing flexural stress across the injured C4-5 segment (P less than 0.05). Cyclical in vitro testing was the most sensitive method in highlighting mechanical differences between instrumentation systems, particularly with \"on-line\" continuous measurement of anterior and posterior strains. Anterior cervical plate stabilization does not appear to confer enough stability in cervical facet injuries to obviate the need for posterior cervical stabilization procedures. The recently developed posterior hook plate technique offers biomechanical advantages that should be weighed against the greater technical precision needed for insertion and the increased potential for neurologic and vascular complications.\r"

Three injuries, in addition to sham, were investigated: 1) transection of supra- and interspinous ligaments at C4-C5; 2) laminectomy at C4; and 3) bilateral facetectomy at C4-C5. Standardized functional flexion/extension stereo-radiographs of the cervical spine were obtained before injury and at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 weeks postinjury. The authors found decreased ranges of motion (ROM) at the C4-C5 level for all injuries, including the sham. The decreases, in general, seemed to be in direct proportion to the severity of the injury. When the ROM were normalized to that of the sham at each time point, the relative ROM at C4-C5 increased for Injury 1, remained the same for Injury 2, and decreased for Injury 3. The relative ROM remained the same or increased at C3-C4, and increased at C5-6 for all injuries. It should be emphasized that care should be taken in extrapolating any data from this animal study to the human cervical spine.\r"

Motion analysis in a two-dimensional plane after facetectomy indicated an anterior displacement of the instantaneous axis of rotation (IAR) with a resultant increased load on the vertebral bodies and disc. This anterior shift of the IAR in the horizontal plane was significantly but not completely resolved by wire fixation of the facet joints. These fixation techniques, consisting of either facet to facet or facet to spinous process wiring, demonstrated a similar capability to restore strength to the functional units as well as reducing excessive motion in the vertical and anterior axes induced by the facetectomies.\r"

Plate fixation of the posterolateral masses has been advocated for such injuries. The purpose of this biomechanical study was to test the relative stiffness provided by different posterior fusion constructs, including lateral mass plating. All testing was performed on fresh, unembalmed cadaveric spines divided into two vertebral segment units. Muscular tissue was stripped from the specimens, but all discal and ligamentous structures were preserved. Four different posterior fixation constructs were tested. These included 1) Rogers interspinous wiring, 2) Halifax laminar clamps, 3) bilateral 1/3 tubular plates on the lateral masses, using unicortical screws, and 4) bilateral 1/3 tubular plates on the lateral masses, using bicortical screws. Stiffness measurements were taken in both flexion and extension on all specimens. Yield strength and fatigue strength of the spines were not measured. It was found that 1/3 tubular plates secured with bicortical screws to the lateral masses provided the highest mean stiffness. Less stiffness was found in spines stabilized by Halifax clamps, interspinous wiring, and plates secured with unicortical screws. There was, however, no statistically significant difference in stiffness provided by any of these four implants. It was concluded that there is no advantage in plate fixation over standard fusion constructs in augmenting the stiffness of posterior fixation of the cervical spine.\r"

The surgery enabled the authors to decompress the spinal cord and the nerve roots and at the same time restore stability in the affected spine. Patients suffering from severe pain and spinal cord and/or nerve root compression secondary to involvement of a single vertebral body particularly benefited from this surgery. The rates of positive recovery were as follows: 94.1% for pain relief, 91.7% for motor recovery, and 87.5% for ambulation. The surgical efficacy was maintained until the terminal stage. Tumor recurrence took place in five cases--two anterior, and three posterior. Anterior recurrence caused a marked instability, whereas posterior recurrence did not affect stability.\r"

  ".W": "Based on a review of previous studies and our opinion, biomechanical considerations suggest the following guidelines for the surgical management of CSM. It is not recommended that the dura mater, the pia mater, and the dentate ligaments be transected in the surgical treatment of CSM. Anterior decompression and fusion, preferably with the Smith-Robinson technique, is recommended for patients with anterior impingement of the spinal cord at one or two levels in the absence of a narrow spinal canal. This procedure is also advantageous when there is significant radiculopathy associated with the level(s) of pathology. Posterior decompression is recommended when there are three or more levels involved, and particularly when there is developmental stenosis of the canal, ie, a DAD below 13 mm and a SAD below 11 mm. Laminectomy and laminoplasty for CSM may not be any different as regards surgical outcome. One well-controlled study showed only one difference, a decrease in the ability of the laminoplasty patients to extend the neck. If there is evidence of instability or a potential for it, posterior decompression procedures should be accompanied by a facet fusion, or in the case of laminoplasty, some fusion modification such as that described by Itoh and Tsuji. There may also be circumstances in which significant multilevel anterior spur formation and compression in association with a stenotic canal should be treated with anterior and posterior surgery with appropriate attention to maintaining adequate stability. The advantages and disadvantages of these various surgical procedures and their relative appropriateness in various clinical situations will be gradually clarified through well-designed and executed laboratory and clinical investigations.\r"

  ".W": "No firm statistical evidence exists establishing the superiority of the anterior or the posterior approach in the management of spondylostenosis, although some sense of order is evolving. In general the consensus suggests that in spondylostenosis, the anterior approach may be preferred for disc or segmental osteophyte intrusions limited to one or two levels. Laminectomy is the preferred procedure in patients with a narrowed canal and multiple level involvement. The surgeon's personal preference and experience remains the dominant factor. Patients with congenital stenosis involving all of the major segments, with or without superimposed developmental changes, require more extensive laminar decompression with proper attention to the craniocervical junction where anomalies may occur. The success of laminectomy is dictated by the preservation of cervical lordosis. In patients with major dorsally located abnormalities such as hyperlordosis, shingling, and arthrosis with hypertrophy of the yellow ligaments, posterior decompression is essential. Subsequent stabilization is rarely required with proper surgical and postoperative care. Both an anterior and posterior approach may be indicated in unique circumstances of spondylostenosis complicated by subluxation and instability.\r"

  ".W": "The varied blood supply of the colon and rectum has been described. It may be stated that the efficiency of any surgeon's hand is primarily dependent on the knowledge that guides it. Significant anatomic facts are described herein. An important blood supply to the terminal ileum comes from the generally unknown ileal artery, which, when absent, creates a critical, poorly vascularized area and thus an inappropriate area for an anastomosis. This right colic artery may be absent in 2 per cent. It may arise in common with the middle colic trunk (52 per cent). The middle colic artery is absent in 3 per cent. It occurs as a separate branch in 44 per cent and may be derived from celiac artery rarely. The inferior mesenteric artery divides into the left colic, which ascends to the splenic flexure, and a descending branch that continues downward as the superior rectal artery. The left colic artery may not reach the splenic flexure. The marginal artery may be interrupted or weakly represented at the splenic flexure. Therefore, one should perform a ligation of the left colic vessel before its bifurcation if the splenic flexure is to be preserved. The superior rectal artery is the main blood supply of the rectum. Its branching on the rectum is varied, but it has a rich anastomosis with the other rectal arteries, namely, the middle rectal and inferior rectal arteries. Sudeck's point is not critical. The middle rectal artery varies in number and origin and is not essential provided the inferior rectal artery is intact. The anatomy of the anal canal is described. The rectum is for a short distance surrounded by the anal canal with the external sphincter. The internal sphincter is the end of circular muscle of the rectum. The external sphincter can be thought of as one continuous muscle divided by longitudinal bands into three main parts: subcutaneous, superficial, and deep. Below the pectinate line in the anal canal, the nerve supply, lymphatic drainage, blood supply, and epithelium are different from that in the rectum.\r"

Polypoid or plateau-like tumors not larger than 3 cm in which palpation, CT, and endoluminal sonography findings suggest only a slight depth of invasion may be treated by limited surgery. According to tumor size, macroscopic appearance, and site, one can decide whether to choose endoscopic polypectomy, per anal submucosal or full-thickness disc excision, or trans-sphincteric excision. After local excision, careful pathologic examination of the specimen is essential in deciding whether the limited procedure can be regarded as curative or whether a radical resection must be added. When average operative risk is present, carcinomas limited to the submucosa (pT1 or early carcinomas) with good prognostic histomorphologic features (grade 1 or 2; no lymphatic invasion) are suitable for treatment by limited surgery. If strict selection criteria are implemented, 5-year survival rates of better than 90 per cent can be achieved. The complication rate is low, and the postoperative mortality rate, even in elderly patients, is minimal.\r"

When functioning, a number of clinical syndromes (for example, hyperinsulinism, Zollinger-Ellison and Cushing's syndromes) may be evident. Fifty-eight patients surgically treated between 1965 and 1984 were retrospectively analyzed. The purpose of this study was to determine the distribution of functioning versus nonfunctioning tumors and the response to type of therapy. Mean postoperative follow-up was 7.4 years. Survival and prognostic indices were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with log-rank tests. Of the group, 54% had functioning and 46% nonfunctioning tumors. Gastrinomas were the most common functioning tumors encountered (19%). Of interest was the finding that nonfunctioning tumors increased steadily during the last 15 years of the study (25% to 65%). Curative resections were performed in 15 (26%) and noncurative procedures in 43 patients (74%), with an overall operative mortality rate of 3%. Symptomatic improvement was achieved in 90% (curative) and 51% (noncurative). Survival at 3 years was 87% and 66% for the curative and noncurative groups, respectively (p less than 0.1), with an overall 5-year survival of 42%. The absence of hepatic metastases was a major predictor of survival at 3 years (82% vs 56%, p less than 0.05). Survival was statistically better at 3 years in those patients with gastrinomas compared with patients with nonfunctioning tumors (91% vs 58%, p less than 0.05). Although surgical cure is rare, significant long-term palliation may be achieved in a large percentage of patients with an aggressive surgical approach, occasional total gastrectomy, combination chemotherapy, H2 blockade, when indicated, and, most recently, with the new long-acting analogue of somatostatin.\r"

SMS 201-995 produced a prompt and sustained decrease in pancreatic blood flow in all treated groups compared with control animals without alteration of systemic hemodynamics.

In contrast, pancreastatin inhibited with histamine-(10(-6), 10(-5) mol/L; p less than 0.005) and carbachol-(10(-5), 10(-4) mol/L; p less than 0.001) stimulated 14C-AP uptake in a dose-dependent manner. Neither forskolin-(10(-6), 10(-4) mol/L; p greater than 0.50) or 8-Br-cAMP-(10(-5), 10(-4) mol/L; p greater than 0.30) stimulated 14C-AP uptake were influenced by pancreastatin. Pancreastatin had no effect on somatostatin release from glands. These data suggest that pancreastatin probably acts at receptor or membrane level, inhibiting both histamine- and carbachol-stimulated 14C-AP uptake. These effects are not mediated by D cell somatostatin release. It is possible that pancreastatin acts as a paracrine or endocrine inhibitory regulator of parietal cell secretion.\r"

  ".W": "We report the first establishment and characterization of functioning gastrinoma from a human being transplanted into nude mice. Tissue was obtained at operation from a gastrinoma liver metastasis from a patient with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The tumor was implanted subcutaneously in five athymic nude mice. Serum gastrin was measured by means of radioimmunoassay in specimens of mouse blood taken before and 5 minutes after intraperitoneal injection of secretin (100 micrograms/kg). In a second experiment serum gastrin was measured 30 minutes after injection of somatostatin analogue, SMS 201-995 (300 micrograms/kg). Studies were also done in 10 control mice. At passage, the fundus of each tumor-bearing mouse was weighed and examined microscopically. The gastrinoma (tumor line, PT) has been maintained for 34 months through four passages with a tumor doubling time of 37 to 45 days. The histology is similar to the original tumor. Immunocytochemistry showed that PT contained gastrin. In two mice metastasis developed 9 months after implantation. Gastrin levels in mice bearing PT have ranged from 216 to 12,000 pg/ml. Gastrin levels of control mice ranged from 0 to 63 pg/ml. Secretin increased gastrin levels in three of five mice tested and decreased gastrin levels in two mice. Repeat secretin tests showed identical results. SMS 201-995 decreased gastrin levels from basal values. Fundic weight of mice bearing PT (397 +/- 93 mg) was significantly greater than control fundic weight (180 +/- 26 mg). Gastrinomas growing in nude mice produce physiologically active gastrin as shown by elevated serum gastrin levels and by hyperplasia of the stomach. Two distinct subpopulations of gastrinoma cells respond differently to secretin. This model should provide important information on mechanisms of growth control and on gastrin release by gastrinomas in human beings.\r"

  ".W": "Multicentric gastric carcinoids develop infrequently in association with atrophic gastritis, achlorhydria, and hypergastrinemia. These unusual tumors, thought to arise from proliferation of enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells, have not been shown to secrete any measurable biogenic amines and usually grow slowly. Hypergastrinemia, which results from antral G cell stimulation secondary to atrophic gastritis, is believed to be the trophic stimulus, but alternative explanations include production of gastrin-releasing factor (GRF) or gastrin per se by the tumor. We recently encountered two patients with pentagastrin-resistant achlorhydria and multiple gastric carcinoids. Neither had symptoms of carcinoid syndrome. Urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and serum human pancreatic polypeptide, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and motilin values were normal. Fasting gastrin values were nearly 1800 pg/ml. Antrectomy and regional lymphadenectomy was performed in each patient. The tumors were locally invasive with penetration through the submucosa. One patient had regional lymph node involvement, and one had an isolated hepatic metastasis. Immunohistochemical stain tests were positive in both patients for neuron-specific enolase and chromogranin, with focal positive staining for gastrin and serotonin. Serum gastrin levels decreased to less than 25 pg/ml after antrectomy. Evaluation with upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and biopsy examination 4 to 6 months after antrectomy showed complete regression of disease in one patient and residual neoplasm in one patient, despite normal serum gastrin levels. Additional studies with careful long-term follow-up will be needed to determine whether antrectomy eliminates the hypergastrinemia associated with enterochromaffin-like hyperplasia and leads to regression of disease.\r"

In 15 patients (27%) no tumor was found and postoperative serum gastrin, basal acid output (BAO), and maximal acid output (MAO) were unchanged. Twenty-one patients (38%) had gastrinomas resected and were biochemically cured. Median fasting gastrin, median delta secretin, mean BAO, and mean MAO decreased 89%, 94%, 80%, and 43%, respectively, at 3-month follow-up in these patients. In 19 patients gastrinomas were resected, but patients were not cured, and median fasting gastrin, median delta secretin, mean BAO, and mean MAO decreased 47%, 10%, 26%, and 25%, respectively. Forty percent of patients with gastrinoma resected and cured and 81% of patients with gastrinoma resected but not cured continued to hypersecrete acid (BAO greater than 10 mEq/hr) at 3- to 6-month follow-up. Acid control was managed perioperatively during gastrinoma resection by continuous intravenous infusion of H2 receptor antagonists at a dose established by preoperative titration to decrease acid output to less than 10 mEq/hr. Thirty patients were treated with cimetidine at a mean dose of 3.2 mg/kg/hr for a mean of 13.8 days. Twenty-one patients were treated with ranitidine at a mean dose of 1.1 mg/kg/hr for a mean of 8 days. No patients suffered any complications related to acid hypersecretion or side effects of the H2 antagonists. Patients undergoing gastrinoma resection can be managed safely by continuous infusion of H2 antagonists. Successful gastrinoma resection can reduce acid output, but even 40% of biochemically cured patients will continue to hypersecrete acid at short-term follow-up and will require continuation of antisecretory medication.\r"

All patients had elevated preoperative plasma catecholamine levels that increased during induction of anesthesia, intubation, and skin incision, but mean values did not become significantly higher than preoperative values until tumor manipulation. Episodes of hypertension were associated with increased plasma catecholamine levels, and plasma catecholamine levels and blood pressure decreased dramatically after tumor resection. NE and EPI were usually secreted simultaneously, but release of either NE or EPI alone occurred on some occasions. There were marked variations in the concentration ratio of NE to EPI in plasma at different periods of observation, which suggests that pheochromocytomas release varying amounts of catecholamines in a random fashion. Studies of the effect of the duration of preoperative preparation on intraoperative blood pressure, pulse rate, and cardiac arrhythmias failed to demonstrate that treatment for 14 days or longer was more effective than treatment for 4 to 7 days. Neither the brief nor the prolonged period of therapy prevented development of severe hypertension during tumor manipulation.\r"

The patients were 28 to 89 years of age (median, 72 years). There were seven male and six female patients. The treatment was as follows: right hemicolectomy, 5; transverse colectomy, 1; left hemicolectomy, 1; low anterior resection, 2; abdominal-perineal resection, 1; and in 3 patients with rectal tumors, biopsy examination only was performed. Microscopic stages were as follows: Dukes' stage B, 1; stage C, 6; stage D, 5; and stage indeterminate, 1. By light microscopy, the tumors showed solid clusters or ribbons of round to fusiform, small to intermediate-sized cells with variably abundant mitoses. Eight tumors had foci of glandular and/or squamous differentiation. By immunohistochemistry, all tumors showed one or more neuroendocrine markers, including neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin, synaptophysin, serotonin, and various neuropeptides. By electron microscopy, single membrane-bound neurosecretory granules were noted. The sites of metastases included regional nodes, 8; liver, 5; bone, 1. Four patients were treated with a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. These tumors were, as a group, aggressive, with eight patients dead within 12 months of diagnosis. Median survival was 7 months, with three patients alive at 2, 38, and 68 months, respectively. Specifically, small- and intermediate-cell neuroendocrine carcinomas of the colon and rectum behaved very aggressively and displayed numerous structural and functional similarities with their bronchopulmonary counterparts.\r"

  ".W": "The role of surgery in the management of patients with primary lymphoma of the thyroid gland has been addressed after review of 61 patients treated at Princess Margaret Hospital between 1958 and August 1982, 46 of whom had clinical stage I and II disease confined to the thyroid gland or lymph nodes or both above the diaphragm. Postoperative radiation therapy was used in 34 patients, radiation therapy and chemotherapy in 11 patients, and chemotherapy alone in 1 patient. Analysis of disease progression, local relapse, and distant disease recurrence indicated that postoperative residual disease bulk predicted strongly for both local and distant disease progression. Overall cause-specific survival was 59% at 5 years, with a relapse-free rate of 46% at 5 years. Of those with less than 2.5 cm of residual disease after surgery, 80% achieved lifelong local disease control compared with 40% for those with residual disease in excess of 2.5 cm after surgery. Distant relapse rates were 7% and 23% for those with less than 2.5 cm and greater than 2.5 cm after surgery, respectively. The long-term survival rate for those with disease progression during this period was approximately 10%, with a median survival expectancy of 18 months. It is suggested that those patients without an antecedent cytologically based diagnosis of lymphoma undergo biopsy and removal of operable tumor without compromise of parathyroid glands, recurrent laryngeal nerves, or appearance. Those patients with an existing cytologic diagnosis of lymphoma and bulky and/or inoperable tumor may be more effectively managed with a combined chemotherapy-radiation therapy program.\r"

Constriction of the upper airway by the growing goiter may be indication for operation, but the residual problem of tracheomalacia after thyroidectomy is a life-threatening postoperative complication. Examples of postoperative tracheomalacia in patients with neglected goiters endemic in the third world or recurrent goiter with airway compromise in a western medical center referral practice are described for development of management methods. Two patients with lethal postthyroidectomy tracheomalacia led me to anticipate this complication in certain identifiable high-risk patients in my own practice, and the cases of five patients are described for whom several techniques of tracheal support were attempted. One patient, for whom staged tracheoplasty was planned, opted for tracheostomy, whereas four patients have had adequate tracheal airways restored by extrinsic support. One was treated by subtotal thyroidectomy with tracheal suspension; one by staged thyroid reductions; two were treated by creation of extrinsic tracheal neo-rings constructed of surgical wire and vascular prostheses. The patient with the most dramatic airway impairment from the most extensive tracheomalacia experienced very satisfactory airway security. A second patient was also supported by the prosthetic rings but extruded one of them, possibly because of tracheostomy contamination. Until tracheal replacement or better tolerated prosthetic or biologic supports are devised, tracheomalacia will remain a vexing problem complicating thyroidectomy for long-standing or recurrent airway-compressing goiter.\r"

This is a report of complications in 200 consecutive thyroidectomies performed by residents with attending surgeons' assistance. There were 128 female and 72 male patients, ranging in age from 16 to 89 years. Ten patients had undergone previous thyroid surgery. There were 40 total thyroidectomies, 38 subtotal thyroidectomies, and 122 lobectomies with isthmusectomy. Preoperative and postoperative evaluation of the vocal cords was a standard routine. Identification of the recurrent laryngeal nerve was routine except in patients with large goiters, who underwent intracapsular subtotal thyroidectomy. An attempt was made to identify and preserve all four parathyroid glands. Even in lobectomy procedures, the ipsilateral parathyroids were identified and preserved. Parathyroid autotransplantation into the sternomastoid muscle was performed in thirteen instances, whenever any of the parathyroids was devascularized. Complications included superior laryngeal nerve palsy (one case) and temporary recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (one case). There was only one patient in whom temporary hypoparathyroidism developed. In three patients hematomas developed in the recovery room and reexploration was required. Two diabetic patients had wound infections develop that required drainage. Seromas and minor wound collections were noted in 6% of the patients. The incidence of major postoperative complications of thyroidectomy is low, even when residents are the primary surgeons. Thyroidectomy appears to be a safe operation in the hands of residents with close supervision and assistance by the attending surgeons.\r"

  ".W": "Flow cytometric analysis of the nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) content of parathyroid glands excised from patients with hypercalcemic hyperparathyroidism has identified three distinct DNA patterns. The most frequent pattern showed a high percentage of cells with tetraploid DNA, which indicated an increase in the G2 and M phase of the cell cycle. Thirty-four patients were found to have abnormal tetraploid DNA content. One patient had a normal diploid pattern, and seven were found to have an aneuploid DNA population in their excised parathyroid glands. This unexpected finding of aneuploid DNA appears to be an unique feature of these endocrine glands because they have no histologic or clinical characteristics of malignant change. All patients have remained normocalcemic and clinically well after excision of only grossly enlarged glands. Postoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were correlated in 17 patients with DNA analyses of biopsy specimens from 30 normal-sized glands which were left in situ. Seven patients with elevated PTH postoperatively had high tetraploid or aneuploid DNA in all 13 glands from which biopsy specimens had high tetraploid or aneuploid DNA in all 13 glands from which biopsy specimens had been taken. In 10 patients with normal PTH levels, six had normal diploid patterns, whereas four had high tetraploid DNA in their gland biopsy specimens. DNA content present in biopsy specimens of normal-sized, in situ glands was predictive (p less than 0.042) of parathyroid gland secretory activity. These findings suggest that the stimulus for parathyroid gland hyperfunction often affects more than a single enlarged gland and persists after clinical cure, as shown by a more rapid cell turnover in some remaining glands and continued hypersecretion of hormone.\r"

Higher rates for persistent hypercalcemia and postoperative hypoparathyroidism are seen in multiple-gland hyperplasia and in bilateral neck exploration. Hyperparathyroid patients undergoing unilateral neck exploration with removal of a single parathyroid adenoma have a rapid clearance of parathyroid hormone (PTH) that declines to undetectable levels within hours after successful parathyroid surgery. We have taken advantage of a sensitive immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) for the secreted biologically active, intact PTH-(1-84) molecule and demonstrated a decline of PTH to less than 40% of baseline values 15 minutes after successful parathyroid adenomectomy in 12 patients. Intraoperative measurement of PTH by modification of this IRMA may complement surgical skill and histopathologic information and has the potential for providing guidance regarding the extent of neck exploration necessary for determining surgical care of hyperparathyroidism.\r"

The criterion based on UcAMP to predict successful outcome was a 50% decline in intraoperative UcAMP levels from the median baseline level after removal of abnormal parathyroid tissue. Standard surgical criteria were resection of four abnormal glands for hyperplasia and resection of one abnormal gland and biopsy examination of one normal gland for adenoma. In 15 patients (60%) surgery was terminated on the basis of UcAMP criterion. In one patient elevated UcAMP levels never changed and correctly predicted unsuccessful surgery. In nine patients surgery was terminated on the basis of surgical criteria, and each of these patients had a successful outcome. Operative UcAMP levels dropped after the completion of the procedure in six of these latter nine patients. Three patients did not show a significant decrease in UcAMP levels despite successful surgery, and one patient displayed an early false-positive decrease in UcAMP level. The intraoperative UcAMP criterion accurately predicted outcome in 21 of 25 patients (84%). Sensitivity of the UcAMP criterion was 87% and specificity was 50%. The results indicate that by either method a reliable prediction of the outcome of reoperative parathyroid surgery may be made. Intraoperative determination of UcAMP levels will allow successful termination of the reoperation in some patients before operative identification of adequate parathyroid tissue necessary to confidently establish the pathologic diagnosis.\r"

  ".U": "89058814\r", 
  ".W": "Measurement of serum ionized calcium has been shown to be more sensitive a method of diagnosing primary hyperparathyroidism than total calcium in patients with subtle or intermittent elevations of total calcium. The measurement of ionized calcium, however, is technically difficult. The measurement of serum ultrafiltrable calcium would circumvent technical difficulties because atomic absorption spectroscopy would be used to measure the calcium of a filtrate produced by passing serum through a filter which excludes protein-complexed calcium (Worthington ultrafree filter). The normal range for ultrafiltrable calcium (4.7 to 6.8 mg/dl) was determined in 138 patients by nonlinear least-squares analysis and chart review. The serum concentration of ultrafiltrable calcium correlated well with ionized calcium (r = 0.91). Previous studies have demonstrated no benefit in measuring ionized calcium, as opposed to total calcium, in the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism unless there was subtle, intermittent, or no elevation of the total calcium. This comparative study of ultrafiltrable, ionized, and total calcium was, therefore, done in six patients with primary hyperparathyroidism who exhibited intermittent, minimal, or no elevations in serum total calcium. All six patients had symptoms referrable to hyperparathyroidism. All six underwent parathyroid surgery, and a parathyroid adenoma was found in each case. These six patients had a total of 24 concurrent preoperative determinations of ionized, ultrafiltrable, and total calcium levels. The total calcium value was elevated in only 9 of these 24 determinations (38%), ultrafiltrable calcium was elevated in 15 (63%), and ionized calcium was elevated in 23 (96%). The values of ionized calcium were elevated more frequently than both total calcium (p less than 0.0005) and ultrafiltrable calcium (p less than 0.025). The values for ultrafiltrable calcium were more frequently elevated than those for total calcium; this difference, however, was not significant. This study confirms our previous reports showing that ionized calcium is a more sensitive indicator of primary hyperparathyroidism in patients with intermittent or borderline elevation of the total calcium and extends those observations to show that ionized calcium is also a more sensitive indicator of primary hyperparathyroidism than ultrafiltrable calcium in this group of patients.\r"

  ".W": "We report on 49 patients younger than 18 years at diagnosis, of 776 patients with thyroid cancer, seen in our institution in the last 17 years. Female/male ratio was 2.2:1. Histologic type was papillary in 44, follicular in 4, and medullary in 1. Initial treatment was near-total thyroidectomy with or without neck dissection. Surgical complications (vocal cord palsy, permanent hypoparathyroidism, or both) were found in 25 patients and were usually associated with more advanced primary tumors. At surgery, node metastases were present in 73% of the patients and lung metastases, detected by chest x ray films, in 6%. Patients were treated with thyroid suppressive therapy and, except the one with medullary cancer, with radioiodine (131I) therapy. After a mean follow-up of 7.7 +/- 4.4 years (range, 1 to 17 years), one patient with lung metastases died of respiratory failure. Of 36 patients who have been followed up more than 4 years, 22 (61.1%) are now cured, and 14 have metastases (to lymph nodes, 2; to nodes and lung, 10; and to lung, 2). Since 1977 serum thyroglobulin (Tg) was used routinely as a tumor marker for differentiated thyroid cancer. After operation, Tg was elevated in all patients both not receiving (mean +/- SE, 902 +/- 380 ng/ml) and receiving (44 +/- 15 ng/ml) suppressive therapy; after 131I treatment, serum Tg dropped to 104 +/- 50 and 7.3 +/- 1.7 ng/ml, without and with suppressive therapy, respectively. Of 11 patients with lung metastases treated with 131I, respiratory function, as assessed by means of spirometry, was normal in three, mildly reduced in six, and severely impaired in two (including the one who died). In conclusion, our study indicates that thyroid cancer in young patients is rather advanced at initial examination and usually associated with node and, less frequently, lung metastases. Total thyroidectomy, radioiodine treatment, and thyroid suppressive therapy represent an effective combination of treatments for this disease and allow a good quality of life. The most serious adverse effect is represented by the high incidence of surgical complications and by pulmonary restrictive disease in relation to lung metastases.\r"

  ".W": "The management of differentiated thyroid cancer in childhood is controversial. In particular, the role of aggressive surgical treatment has been questioned. This study was performed to identify those factors that are predictive of recurrence and morbidity following treatment through use of a multivariate model. The records of all patients 17 years of age or less admitted in the last 35 years with histologically confirmed differentiated thyroid carcinoma were reviewed. Data were sufficient for multivariate analysis in 93. The mean age at diagnosis was 13.3 years, and the median period of follow-up was 20 years. Seventy-one percent of the patients had nodal metastases. There were no deaths from thyroid carcinoma in this series, and the overall recurrence rate after initial treatment was 34%. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that only age (p less than or equal to 0.07) and histologic subtype (p less than or equal to 0.01) were predictive of time to recurrence. Major morbidity was a function of age (p less than or equal to 0.007) and extent of thyroid surgery (p less than or equal to 0.01). Probability of minor complications was predicted by use of radical neck dissection (p less than or equal to 0.02). Use of total or subtotal thyroidectomy or of radical neck dissection in children does not prevent recurrence and is associated with an increased risk of complications. We conclude that these procedures should be avoided in pediatric patients.\r"

At initial evaluation, mean tumor size (+/- SD) was greater in children (3.1 +/- 1.7 cm) than in adults (2.1 +/- 1.7 cm) (p less than 0.001); tumor DNA content was nondiploid in 10% of 39 children and in 25% of 110 adults (p = 0.047). Neck node metastases at diagnosis were detected in more children (89.7%) than adults (34.7%) (p less than 0.0001), but extrathyroidal invasion was not significantly more frequent in children (24.1%) than adults (15.8%) (p = 0.095). Distant metastases at diagnosis were detected in more children (6.9%) than adults (2.1%) (p = 0.022). Postoperatively, neck node metastases recurred more frequently in children (30%) than in adults (7%) (p less than 0.001), but local neck recurrences were not significantly more frequent in children (12%) than in adults (5%) (p = 0.083). Postoperative distant metastases occurred with similar frequency in children (6%) and adults (5%) (p = 0.98). Survival (all causes of death) for both adults and children up to 30 years after the initial surgery was no different from expected survival rates. Only adults aged more than 40 years had a significantly higher mortality from PTC than did children (p less than 0.0001). Fourteen percent of children had died of PTC by 15 years after diagnosis of distant metastases, whereas 68% of similarly affected adults were dead at 15 years (p = 0.014). PTC was more often metastatic to neck nodes and lungs before initial surgery and more often recurrent in neck lymph nodes postoperatively. However, PTC tended to be less fatal in children, and this may be related to the infrequency of nondiploid DNA content in the childhood PTC tumors.\r"

There were also 23 anaplastic, 8 medullary, and 3 Hurthle cell carcinomas. These patients were followed up from 3 to 31 years, with a mean range of 10 years. Fifty-three patients with well-differentiated tumors underwent total thyroidectomies, and 179 underwent subtotal thyroidectomies (excluding anaplastic, medullary, and Hurthle cell tumors). Regional lymph node involvement was commonly found but appeared not to affect survival; tumor size and local spread and extent of thyroid gland involvement did affect survival. A small percentage of well-differentiated thyroid tumors do, in time, undergo anaplastic change that leads to metastasis and death. There was no 30-day mortality rate. The late mortality rate was 2% for papillary and 14% for follicular carcinomas. Papillary tumors are becoming more common. Older aged patients and male patients appear to carry poorer prognoses for survival. The total thyroidectomy procedure has not improved survival over subtotal thyroidectomy and carries a higher complication rate.\r"

  ".W": "There continues to be controversy about every aspect of management of differentiated thyroid carcinoma. In an age-based risk group previously described, low-risk patients made up 62% of cases and had a death rate of only 1%. Recent reports from the Mayo Clinic have expanded the concept of the low-risk group to include 86% of all cases with a 2% death rate by utilizing several anatomic and pathologic criteria of risk. We offer here another multifactorial system for the identification of low-risk patients who made up 89.4% of all patient seen between 1961 and 1980 and who have a death rate of only 1.8%. The resultant high-risk group constitutes 11% of cases but carries a 46% mortality rate. The risk-group definition is completely clinical and is based on age, presence of distant metastases, and the size and extent of primary cancer. It can be used confidently at the operating table to select conservative surgical procedures in patients with negligible risk of death. Through the succeeding decades analyzed, from 1941 to 1980, the effectiveness of this clinical categorization has increased substantially in separating patients at high and low risk, so that a mortality rate ratio of 26:1 now exists between high- and low-risk groups, respectively.\r"

  ".W": "From a multivariate analysis of more than 20,600 patient-years' experience with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), we devised a prognostic scoring system based on patient age, tumor grade, extent, and size (AGES). This scoring system was used as an adjustment variable for analyzing the role of different types of surgical treatment in the development of local recurrence (LR) in 963 PTC patients who underwent unilateral (15%), bilateral subtotal/near-total (69%), or total thyroidectomies (16%) from 1946 through 1975 at the Mayo Clinic. In 866 patients with AGES scores of 3.99 or less, the risk of LR developing at 10, 20, and 30 years was 7%, 14%, and 14% after unilateral resection and 1.5%, 2%, and 4% after bilateral resection (p less than 0.001). In 97 patients with AGES scores of 4 or more, the comparable rates were 26%, 45%, and 59% after unilateral resection and 13%, 20%, and 20% after bilateral resection (p less than 0.001). In neither the low- nor the high-risk group was there a significant difference in the frequency of LR comparing total thyroidectomy with bilateral subtotal/near-total thyroidectomy. At 30 years after diagnosis of LR, mortality from PTC was 48%; the risk of cancer death with an LR located outside the thyroid remnant was much greater than with a remnant recurrence alone. In this series of 52 patients, followed up for as many as 41 years, no patient with tumor recurrence limited to the thyroid remnant died of thyroid cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Four patients with a histologically distinctive thyroid carcinoma--which recently has been referred to as poorly differentiated (\"insular\") carcinoma--are reported. This study confirms the previous conclusions that patients with this neoplasm often experience an aggressive clinical course, with focal recurrences and distant metastases common, which results in death in the majority of patients. Such aggressive behavior may occur even when the insular component accounts for only a small percentage of an otherwise well-differentiated carcinoma, as seen in one of our patients. After subtotal or total thyroidectomy, three of the four patients have experienced local recurrence (1) and metastases to lung (3), mediastinum (1), and bone (1). All three of these patients died within 2 years of the diagnosis of insular carcinoma. The remaining patient is alive without evidence of disease 1 year after total thyroidectomy. Histologically, this neoplasm is characterized by well-defined nests (insulae) that are composed of relatively small, uniform cells and sometimes associated with small, thyroglobulin-containing follicles. Tumor necrosis is often present. Insular carcinoma may comprise the entire neoplasm (2 patients) or be associated with well-differentiated follicular (1 patient) or papillary (1 patient) carcinoma. The rapid and often fatal course associated with insular carcinoma warrants aggressive treatment at the time of initial diagnosis, including total thyroidectomy and node dissection (if involved), as well as possible iodine-131, external beam irradiation and chemotherapy.\r"

The primary lesion is usually not palpable, and although the clinical behavior usually follows a benign course, tumors with unfavorable histologic features (invasiveness, multifocality) or extrathyroidal disease or a combination of both may not do so. In this report six cases are presented to illustrate this entity. No patient had a history of irradiation to the head or neck. All had primary lesions smaller than 1.5 cm. None had a palpable nodule or abnormal thyroid scan results, and the diagnosis of thyroid cancer was based on cervical lymph node or lung biopsy specimens, which revealed papillary thyroid cancer. All of the patients underwent total or near-total thyroidectomies and were found to have small, invasive papillary lesions with additional metastases to cervical nodes noted at the time of thyroidectomy. Adjunctive treatment consisted of a 5 mCi iodine-131 scan, ablative iodine-131 therapy, and suppression with L-thyroxine. Although distant metastasis to lung or other organs is uncommon and the mortality rate is low (as in larger papillary cancers), these invasive lesions--despite their small size--have a high propensity for recurrence and should be considered to behave more like encapsulated papillary tumors with extrathyroidal extension than like their small, unencapsulated intrathyroidal counterparts.\r"

  ".U": "89058825\r", 
  ".W": "Recent investigations suggest that although thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is the major regulator of thyroid gland function, it is not the only hormone that regulates the thyroid gland. Another factor regulating thyroid gland function is vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), which is present in nerves that innervate thyroid blood vessels and follicles. Previous studies have documented that VIP stimulates adenylate cyclase (AC) activity in cultured normal and hyperplastic (Graves) thyroid tissue, thus increasing intracellular cyclic AMP concentration. To our knowledge, however, there is no information concerning the effect of VIP on neoplastic thyroid tissue. Therefore we studied the effect of VIP on normal and neoplastic human thyroid tissue from 10 patients (follicular adenomas, 4; follicular carcinomas, 3; and papillary carcinomas, 3). Adenylate cyclase activity was measured in a 8000 g membrane preparation in the basal state and when incubated with VIP, TSH, and both. VIP increased AC activity in normal tissue and tumor in a dose-dependent manner, with maximal stimulation at 10(-6) mol/L (p less than 0.05). In normal tissue, 10(-6) mol/L VIP and a maximally stimulating concentration of TSH (300 mU/ml) stimulated AC to the same degree. In tumors, although both TSH and VIP increased AC activity, the response to TSH was greater (p less than 0.01). VIP and TSH had an additive effect in normal tissue (p less than 0.05), whereas in tumors the AC response to VIP and TSH was the same as with TSH alone (p = 0.66). This study documents that VIP is a potent stimulator of adenylate cyclase in both normal and neoplastic human thyroid tissues. The magnitude of this effect is similar to that produced by TSH, which implies that VIP plays a physiologically important role in the regulation of the secretion and growth of normal and neoplastic thyroid tissues.\r"

Since malignant tumors with irradiation as an initiator often contain DNA aberrations, the DNA content of well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma in patients with a prior history of low-dose head and neck irradiation was determined and compared with similar nonradiation-associated lesions. The DNA content of thyroid cancers from 53 patients was determined with use of flow cytometry. Sixteen radiation-associated thyroid carcinomas (11 papillary, 3 follicular, and 2 medullary) all were diploid. In a group of 37 nonradiation-associated tumors, 10 were aneuploid (10 of 29 papillary carcinomas and 0 of 2 follicular or 6 medullary carcinomas). This difference in DNA content is significant (p less than 0.02, Fisher's exact test). These findings were unexpected and suggest that if the initiating irradiation causes a DNA aberration, this aberration is not reflected in DNA content as measured by means of flow cytometry.\r"

Two patients, a 43-year-old man and a 53-year-old woman, had similar thyroid tumors, both about 4 cm in diameter. The cut surfaces of the resected tumors were indistinguishable from a common microfollicular adenoma of the thyroid. Microscopically, the tumors were uniformly composed of fusiform cells without any follicle formation. Neither amyloid deposition nor calcification was found. Although some kind of C cell tumors were suggested, the exact nature was debatable. However, extremely high levels of calcitonin (1330 and 2065 pg/ml, respectively; normal level, less than 170 pg/ml) were found in the stored sera taken preoperatively. Serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were normal in both patients. Immunohistochemically, the tumor tissues were positive for calcitonin and neuron-specific enolase but negative for CEA with a monoclonal anti-CEA antibody. No somatostatin, glucagon, or adrenocorticotropic hormone activity was found. It is highly probable that such tumors have not been closely studied and have been regarded as eccentric adenomas of the thyroid or simply as the so-called medullary carcinomas of the thyroid.\r"

Whole surfactant and purified surfactant lipids suppressed the proliferative response to phytohaemagglutinin in a dose dependent manner. The purified lipid fraction appeared to cause more suppression than whole surfactant in all the species. There was significant suppression of the proliferative response to B cell mitogens, T cell mitogens (pokeweed mitogen and phytohaemagglutinin), and alloantigens as tested by allogeneic mixed lymphocyte cultures. These results suggest an immunoregulatory role for pulmonary surfactant, most likely due to the lipid fraction.\r"

It is based on the administration of aerosolised albumin labelled with technetium-99m using a special inhalation technique to produce central airway deposition. The method was evaluated as a measure of mucociliary clearance by recording the movement of radioactivity in the airways of 11 healthy, non-smoking subjects on two separate days. A series of bronchoscintigrams was acquired at five minute intervals for two hours after termination of the inhalation. After the first bronchoscintigram 1.25 mg terbutaline or placebo was administered from a metered dose inhaler (five puffs) according to a randomised, double blind, crossover design. The scintigrams were evaluated blind. After terbutaline the segmental bronchi were no longer visible after a median time of 10 minutes, the lobar bronchi after 20 minutes and the main bronchi after 30 minutes. In six cases the trachea was cleared after two hours. After placebo the segmental bronchi disappeared after a median of 15 minutes, but at two hours half the lobar bronchi remained visible. In only two cases was it no longer possible to see the main bronchi or the trachea. It is concluded that bronchoscintigraphy can be used to examine regional mucociliary clearance in healthy subjects and that terbutaline significantly increases the clearance of the deposited radioactive aerosol.\r"

The number of nucleolar organiser regions in samples taken from 10 patients with normal pleura (mean 1.04 (95% confidence interval 0.96-1.12] was less than the number seen in samples from 10 patients with \"reactive\" (inflammatory) pleural disease (1.75 (1.34-2.16); p less than 0.001). This is the first demonstration of increased numbers of nucleolar organiser regions in an inflammatory condition. In specimens from 25 patients with mesothelioma the corresponding numbers of nucleolar organiser regions were: tubulopapillary (n = 10) 5.43 (4.42-6.44); undifferentiated (n = 5) 5.00 (3.29-6.71); sarcomatous (n = 5) 7.52 (3.96-11.08); and mixed histological types (n = 5) 4.94 (3.2-6.68). All these values differ significantly from those for both normal and \"reactive\" tissue (p less than 0.001). It is concluded that the AgNOR technique separates \"reactive\" pleural disease from mesothelioma with a high degree of confidence and is an important advance in the diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma.\r"

  ".W": "After investigation of one worker with occupational asthma, all 51 employees of a pharmaceutical company processing the macrolide antibiotic spiramycin were investigated to determine the frequency of the condition and the risk factors. The antibiotic was produced for short periods four to five times a year. The first part of the investigation, conducted before a production period, consisted of the following: questionnaire, skinprick tests, blood sample, spirometry, assessment of bronchial responsiveness to methacholine, and monitoring of peak expiratory flow rates (PEF). The second part of the survey was carried out in 48 of the 51 workers during the production period, and included the same assessments except for skin testing. No FEV1 values had changed by more than 9% or PEF by more than 19%. Inhalation challenge with spiramycin was performed in 12 of the 14 individuals who had a history of occupational asthma, a provocative concentration of methacholine (PC20) of 16 mg/ml or less, or a PC20 that fell by 2.5 fold or more during the production period (or a combination of these). Three subjects experienced immediate bronchoconstriction. All reported symptoms, and all had a fall in PC20 methacholine during the production period. It is concluded that the minimum frequency of occupational asthma in this company processing spiramycin is 4/51 (7.8%). The combination of a positive response to the questionnaire and a change in bronchial hyperresponsiveness during the production period appeared to be the best detector of individuals with occupational asthma, as confirmed by inhalation challenge with spiramycin.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the effect of corticosteroids on bronchial hyperresponsiveness, a randomised, double dummy, single blind crossover study was performed in 18 subjects with chronic asthma, comparing the effect of three weeks' treatment with inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate, 1200 micrograms daily, and oral prednisone 12.5 mg daily. The 12 week study began with a three week run in period of baseline treatment, which was continued unchanged throughout the study, and the two treatment periods were separated by a three week washout period. Patients kept daily Airflometer readings and attended the laboratory every three weeks for spirometry and a histamine inhalation test for determining the provocative dose of histamine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PD20). The mean FEV1 at the start was 1.9 litres (56% predicted). There was no significant change in PD20 with prednisone treatment, the mean PD20 being 0.56 and 0.59 mumol before and after treatment. There was, however, a significant improvement in PD20 with beclomethasone dipropionate treatment, the geometric mean PD20 being 0.38 and 1.01 mumol before and after treatment (p less than 0.001). There was a small but significant improvement in mean FEV1 after beclomethasone dipropionate treatment--from 1.9 to 2.2 litres--but no change after prednisone. Both medications produced significant and similar improvements in morning and evening Airflometer readings, post-bronchodilator improvement, and diurnal variation. Thus at doses that had similar beneficial effects on lung function beclomethasone dipropionate caused a significant improvement in bronchial hyperresponsiveness whereas prednisone caused no change. The superior topical anti-inflammatory effect of beclomethasone dipropionate may account for the different effects on bronchial hyperresponsiveness.\r"

In study 1, where 12 patients performed 12 walks over three consecutive days, five minute walking distance increased by 33% between walks 1 and 12, half of the increase occurring after the first three walks. In study 2, where 24 patients performed 12 walks over four consecutive weeks, five minute walking distance increased by 8.5% between walks 1 and 12. A learning effect was seen over the first nine walks. Static visual clues to performance did not affect the distance walked. Spirometric measurements showed no order effect in either study. Although walking distance correlated significantly with FEV1, forced vital capacity, and peak expiratory flow, these measurements were poor predictors of exercise performance. The learning effects seen on repeated performance of walking tests over short intervals should be considered when an individual's response to treatment is being interpreted. When walking tests are used in clinical trials a placebo group or randomised crossover design is essential.\r"

Twenty two subjects performed a methacholine inhalation test before and after smoking a single cigarette. Ten of the subjects took part in a further study in which propranolol was inhaled before the smoking challenge to diminish the baseline beta adrenergic tone of the airway. After they had smoked a single filtered or non-filtered cigarette the indices of bronchial responsiveness (the cumulative dose of methacholine starting a decrease in the reciprocal of resistance, Grs (Dmin), and the cumulative dose causing a 35% drop in the Grs (PD35Grs)) did not change significantly. With the inhalation of propranolol mean (SD) log Dmin decreased from 1.37 (0.44) units to 0.74 (0.57) (p less than 0.01) and log PD35Grs from 1.93 (0.38) to 1.51 (0.38) (p less than 0.01). Smoking a single cigarette after the inhalation of propranolol did not, however, cause any further change in bronchial responsiveness. This study suggests that smoking a single filtered or non-filtered cigarette does not change bronchial responsiveness in non-smokers, and that changes in beta adrenergic tone of the airway do not modify the effect of smoking a single cigarette on bronchial responsiveness.\r"

Patients recorded symptom scores for asthma and peak expiratory flow rate daily for 11 months. In addition, they reported for detailed clinical, functional, and virological study every four weeks and as soon as possible after the onset of worsening asthma or symptoms suggesting a respiratory tract infection. Thirty viral identifications were made, of which 18 (60%) were associated with an exacerbation of asthma. Viral respiratory tract infection was identified in 18 (10%) of the 178 exacerbations of asthma, and in 10 (36%) of the 28 severe exacerbations. The frequency of viral identifications in 16 non-asthmatic, control subjects during the same period was similar. It is concluded that viral respiratory tract infections may cause or be associated with exacerbations of asthma in adults, and that they are an important factor in severe exacerbations.\r"

The asthmatic patients had a baseline FEV1 greater than 60% predicted and a PD20FEV1 (provocative dose of methacholine causing a 20% fall in FEV1) of 0.006-3.7 mg. The 20 control subjects had normal pulmonary function and a PD20FEV1 above the maximum cumulative dose of methacholine of 6.4 mg. Bronchoalveolar lavage of a middle lobe segment (lingula in four subjects) was performed with three sequential 60 ml aliquots of sterile saline. Cellular metabolic activity was stimulated with latex in aliquots of resuspended cells, and measured by means of luminol enhanced chemiluminescence to assess neutrophil activity and lucigenin enhanced chemiluminescence to assess macrophage activity. Mean absolute total cell counts were similar in the asthmatic and control groups but there were differences in differential cell counts, with a significant increase in eosinophil (p less than 0.05) and lymphocyte (p less than 0.005) counts in asthma. PD20FEV1 was negatively correlated with percentage neutrophil counts (p less than 0.005). Luminol enhanced chemiluminescence/1000 neutrophils was increased about twofold in asthmatic subjects (p less than 0.001), but was not correlated with PD20FEV1 Lucigenin enhanced chemiluminescence/1000 macrophages was increased nearly fourfold in asthmatic patients (p less than 0.001) and showed a negative correlation with PD20FEV1 (p less than 0.01). The macrophage count was increased twofold in current smokers in both groups, but other cell numbers were not altered significantly. Smoking did not affect cellular metabolic activity in either group. This study supports the idea that an inflammatory process is present in the airways of those with asthma, and suggests a relation between bronchial responsiveness and both neutrophil numbers and macrophage activity.\r"

Mean PEF had fallen by 60 l/min (13%) 30 minutes after the start of dialysis. In 10 of the 30 patients the fall in PEF was over 15%, the maximum fall being 32%. After the initial fall PEF increased throughout the next 2.5 hours of haemodialysis, but it fell again at five hours in the 14 patients who had been dialysed for four hours. During dialysis there was a reduction in blood white cell and platelet counts and in arterial oxygen tension at 30 and 60 minutes (p less than 0.05) and the white cell count and arterial oxygen tension were still reduced at three hours. The coincidence of the fall in PEF at 30 minutes and the fall in arterial oxygen tension suggests that bronchoconstriction might contribute to dialysis induced hypoxaemia by causing ventilation-perfusion disturbances. Appreciable airway dysfunction occurred in all the patients undergoing regular haemodialysis with new cuprophan dialysers and acetate buffered dialysate.\r"

They have been shown to cause allergic symptoms in Scottish farmworkers exposed to stored hay, but whether farmworkers who grow and store grain are also at risk is unknown. One hundred and one farmworkers on 22 Essex farms with grain storage facilities (88% of the available workforce) participated in a survey of respiratory symptoms, with skin tests and determination of serum levels of IgE specific for mite species, including storage mites. Of the 101 workers, 21 reported attacks of cough, wheeze, or breathlessness after exposure to stored grain and 15 reported nasal symptoms after grain exposure. Storage mite specific IgE was found in 59% of farmworkers with work related respiratory symptoms, in 60% with work related nasal symptoms, and in only 9% of symptomless farmworkers. Work related respiratory and nasal symptoms were also significantly associated with atopy, and with positive skin test responses and serum IgE specific for Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus. Storage mites were found in grain samples from 16 farms in which grain was sampled, whereas D pteronyssinus was not found in any. The close association between serum storage mite specific IgE and occupational respiratory symptoms suggests that storage mites may be responsible for respiratory symptoms in these Essex farmworkers exposed to grain.\r"

A study in rats was carried out to investigate this question. Rats from the Hilltop (H) strain are known to develop more severe pulmonary hypertension as a result of chronic hypoxia than rats from the Madison (M) strain despite having virtually identical arterial and mixed venous oxygen tensions. Rats from H and M strains were exposed to hypoxia (0.5 atm) for 3-21 days and lung and serum ACE activities were determined. After three days' hypobaria lung ACE activity was significantly lower and serum ACE significantly higher in H than in M rats. Linear regressions for lung ACE activity and right ventricular:body weight ratios showed significant inverse correlations and were similar in the two strains. The results suggest that pulmonary hypertension and not hypoxia determines the reduction in lung ACE activity, possibly by releasing ACE into the blood stream.\r"

The impairment of lung function in the two disorders has been compared in more detail in 29 patients with asbestosis and 25 with fibrosing alveolitis, arterial oxygen desaturation during exercise being used to define the severity of the disorders. Arterial oxygen saturation (ear oximeter) and oxygen uptake were measured during incremental exercise on a cycle ergometer. TLCO (single breath technique) and total lung capacity (TLC, plethysmograph) were measured. Chest radiographs were graded for profusion according to the ILO international classification. Patients with asbestosis had significantly higher mean values for TLCO and TLC and lower mean profusion scores than those with fibrosing alveolitis. When stratified for the degree of arterial oxygen desaturation, however, no significant differences were found in TLCO, TLC, or profusion score between the two disorders. To the extent that arterial oxygen desaturation with exercise reflects the morphological severity of the disease, these results suggest that, for a given degree of interstitial lung disease, asbestosis and cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis are functionally and radiologically similar.\r"

Total RBC transfusion rates (total RBCs transfused/1000 hospital admissions) increased between 1980 and 1982 but remained nearly constant between 1982 and 1985. Plasma transfusion dynamics followed a similar pattern, whereas the preoperative deposit of autologous blood by patients accelerated rapidly after 1982. These changes appear to reflect responses to the acquired immune deficiency syndrome epidemic. In contrast, total platelet transfusion rates grew by 76 percent during the 6-year period, approaching total RBC rates by 1985. This is the first reported evidence in such a large sample of transfusions that total RBC transfusion rates have moderated.\r"

With this technique RBCs from normal, healthy donors gave a mean value of 106 +/- 60 molecules of IgG per RBC, 4.5 +/- 3 molecules of IgM per RBC, and 37 +/- 28 molecules of C3 per RBC, respectively. The RBCs of hospital patients, particularly of those with infections or inflammatory conditions, contain increased amounts of nonspecifically bound immunoproteins. The availability of a common method to quantitate RBC-associated IgG, IgM, and C3 allows easy monitoring or study of the immune mechanism of autoimmune hemolytic anemia.\r"

  ".W": "Human stroma-free hemoglobin (Hb) was crosslinked with 2-nor-2-formylpyridoxal 5'-phosphate (NFPLP), purified over crosslinked dextran, and eluted with a linear salt gradient. The oxygen dissociation curve of this crosslinked hemoglobin appeared to be shifted to the right with a standard P50 of 49 torr (PO2 for 50% saturation with oxygen at a pH of 7.40, a PCO2 of 40 torr, and a temperature of 37 degrees C) compared with a P50 of 12 to 15 torr for the unmodified Hb. The Hill coefficient n of HbNFPLP was 2.1, versus 2.8 for Hb. The proton Bohr factor of HbNFPLP, calculated from P50 values in the pH range of 7.1 to 7.7, was found to be -0.19, versus -0.29 for unmodified Hb. The oxygen capacity of HbNFPLP was not affected by the crosslinking and was found to be 1.410 ml of O2 per g of HbNFPLP, versus 1.407 ml of O2 per g of Hb for unmodified Hb. Four derivatives of HbNFPLP, i.e., deoxyhemoglobin, oxyhemoglobin, carboxyhemoglobin, and methemoglobin, were prepared, and the light adsorption spectra were recorded in the region of 480 to 680 nm. No differences were detected in comparison with the spectra of unmodified Hb. The alpha and beta chains of the tetramer were separated by reverse-phase chromatography. Comparison of the elution patterns of the chains of Hb and HbNFPLP revealed a retardation of the beta chains due to crosslinking with NFPLP. This indicates that the binding of NFPLP to Hb occurred only between the beta chains.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Respondents placed a high value on the relevance of TM to patient care, although they rated their knowledge and learning opportunities as only moderate. They rated senior residents as the most useful educational resource, with undergraduate medical school education, formal conferences, and journals and library resources being the three next most useful. Residents had the greatest confidence in using packed red cells, platelets, and fresh-frozen plasma. Surgery and anesthesiology residents generally had greater confidence in using blood bank resources than internal medicine residents. The findings of the survey can be used, along with the results of medical care evaluations of transfusion practice and opinions of education experts, to create an optimally relevant and effective curriculum for resident education in transfusion medicine.\r"

Temperatures were categorized at 10-degree intervals from 15 degrees F to 75 degrees F. Donors failing the hemoglobin screening then underwent a microhematocrit evaluation. Of the 65,531 donors seen at this blood center, 4537 were deferred, for an annual deferral rate of 6.7 to 7.2 percent (p less than 0.1). Deferrals for low hematocrit were significantly higher for both sexes at and above 45 degrees F. Similar experiences were also observed in 79,563 donors who came to the bloodmobiles over 19 months in 1983 and 1984. The percentages of deferrals at the blood center for low hematocrit in 1984 were 1.22, 2.6, and 3.5 for men and 6.7, 11.3, and 13.2 for the women at monthly average temperatures of 15.1 to 45 degrees F, 45.1 to 65 degrees F, and 65.1 to 75 degrees F, respectively. These differences of deferral rates are significant (p less than 0.05-0.001). Although other personal demographics remained constant, more of the donors deferred in this study had also been deferred in the past. The climatic changes had a significant effect on the blood composition that resulted in the deferral of blood donors with a borderline low hematocrit.\r"

A passive latex agglutination test (CMV Scan, Hynson, Wescott & Dunning, Baltimore, MD) has been shown to be an acceptable method of screening sera from the blood donor population. The procedure for this test, however, does not permit the testing of stored donor blood products. To evaluate the feasibility of testing blood components at various times during storage, the authors examined 25 CMV-positive and 25-CMV negative samples of CPDA-1 plasma from 50 units each of platelets and red cells. Plasma samples from platelets stored at 22 degrees C were tested on each of the 5 days of storage. Samples from red cell units stored at 2 to 6 degrees C were tested on storage Days 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14. Of 250 tests done on plasma from platelet units, there were 123 true-positive and 123 true-negative results (sensitivity and specificity, 98.4%). Of 400 tests on plasma from red cell units, there were 200 true-positive and 198 true-negative results (sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 99.5%). These data show that the CMV Scan test can be used reliably to test segments of CPDA-1 plasma from platelets stored for up to 5 days and from red cells stored for up to 14 days.\r"

The characteristics of both platelet concentrates were studied. White cell contamination in the nonpelleted PCs was below the threshold of detection by a microcell counter (less than 300 cells/microliter of concentrate); in the pelleted PCs, it was 3 +/- 1 x 10(7) cells per concentrate. The difference between the white cell contamination in pelleted PCs and nonpelleted PCs was significant (p less than 0.001). The degree of aggregation induced in pelleted PCs by ADP (9 microM) and collagen decreased to 33 and 55 percent, respectively, of that in platelet-rich plasma. The secondary wave of platelet aggregation induced by ADP and epinephrine was absent in pelleted PCs, and ATP secretion from these platelets by ADP stimulation also decreased remarkably. However, the degrees of aggregation and ATP secretion in nonpelleted PCs were similar to those in platelet-rich plasma. Furthermore, it was found that the amount of platelet factor 4 release seen in pelleted PCs was large in comparison to that in nonpelleted PCs and platelet-rich plasma. These results suggested that the deterioration of platelet function might have resulted from the platelet activation induced by pellet formation during the preparation of PCs from platelet-rich plasma.\r"

However, thawing by waterbath (WB) requires about 30 minutes, which is too slow in emergency situations and carries the risk of bacterial contamination of the FFP. There are conflicting data about the use of microwaves for thawing. Therefore, we examined a new microwave oven (MWO; 2450 +/- 50 MHz), which was developed with our cooperation and allows thawing of FFP in 5 minutes, heating FFP to a surface temperature of 21.5 degrees C. A shaking WB (30 min, 37 degrees C) was also used in parallel for comparison. We measured activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), nonactivated PTT (NaPTT), fibrinogen, factors VIII:C, X, and XI, fibrinopeptide A, beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TG), thrombin-AT III-complexes, factor VIII-related antigen, C3c, C4, and the plasticizer di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) in 84 units of FFP as paired samples from 42 double aphereses. Immediately after thawing there was no significant difference in the coagulation test results of FFP with low-cell contamination, regardless of the thawing procedure. Two hours later, after storage at room temperature, FFP thawed by MWO showed even less change than that thawed by WB (NaPTT, p less than 0.01; FX, p less than 0.01). The differences became more evident in comparison with FFP with higher cell contamination and could be observed immediately after thawing (FVIII:C p less than 0.001; FXI, p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Standard clinical instrumentation and equipment and on-line computer interfacing were used to monitor and control the interface position. The data provided a quantitative description of its dynamics in the SS I and the SS II chambers. In the SS I chamber, adjustments in the flow rate caused the interface to move very slowly and in a complex manner from one steady-state operation position to another. Such behavior made both manual and computer-controlled operation very difficult. By contrast, the SS II chamber was inherently unstable for most operating conditions. We demonstrated, however, that a feedback controller could be used easily to adjust or maintain the interface position, and this system moved from one steady-state operating condition to another 10 times as fast as the system using the SS I chamber. Also, the manner in which the controller allowed the system to respond to operator requests was much simplier than that for the SS I system.\r"

The relationship of blood transfusion to malignancy was investigated in 354 patients with colorectal cancer, matched by age and sex to control subjects with hernia (105 patients) or gallbladder (249 patients) disease. The incidence of prior blood transfusion was significantly lower in the cancer patients than in the control group (9 versus 17%, chi-square = 9.98, p less than 0.01). Control subjects differed from cancer patients by having more prior transfusions for major joint, cardiac, and urologic procedures. The mean intervals between transfusion and operation were 11.7 years for the cancer patients, 9.7 years for the gallbladder patients, and 7.4 years for the hernia patients. A comparison of cancer patients with and without prior blood transfusion revealed no differences in age, sex, stage of disease, tumor location, or tumor differentiation. Cancer has recurred in 33 percent of patients with previous transfusion and in 18 percent of those without previous transfusion (p = 0.2). This study does not support an association between prior blood transfusion and the development of colorectal cancer.\r"

Long-segment coronary stenoses with diffuse irregularities (type IIB morphology) have been shown to be more prevalent than focal irregular lesions (type IIA morphology) in survivors of cardiac arrest without acute myocardial infarction. To further understand the pathogenetic importance of type IIB morphology, the clinical and angiographic characteristics in 59 such patients were analyzed. Type IIB lesions accounted for 63% of all type II lesions. Type IIB patients were older than type IIA patients (p less than 0.05). There was a tendency for type IIB morphology to be associated with more extensive disease than other types of lesion morphology (p less than 0.10). Type IIB morphology probably reflects more advanced atherosclerosis. Platelet microemboli may precipitate spasm and/or acute ischemic ventricular tachyarrhythmias. It is possible that long-segment coronary ulcerations are associated with a higher risk for local coronary thromboembolism, and hence with sudden death, than focal lesions.\r"

Programmed electrical stimulation may offer a means of identifying lower risk patients who are less likely to benefit from antiarrhythmic therapy and who could potentially be spared the risk of adverse drug effects. Therefore 72 consecutive patients referred for management of severe heart failure (left ventricular ejection fraction 0.18 +/- 0.06) were studied. The mean age was 47 +/- 12 years; 45 (61%) patients had idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and 24 (33%) had coronary artery disease. Fifty-eight (82%) patients had nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Following adjustment of vasodilators and diuretics, programmed stimulation was performed from the right ventricular apex with one, two, and three extrastimuli. Sustained ventricular tachycardia was initiated in nine (13%) patients and all received chronic antiarrhythmic drug therapy. During follow-up of 176 +/- 187 days, 1 of 13 patients treated for inducible ventricular tachycardia and 13 of 63 noninducible patients died suddenly (p = 0.20). The actuarial risk of sudden death in the noninducible patients was 13% at 6 weeks and 30% at 6 months. The only independent predictors of sudden death were pulmonary artery systolic pressure greater than 55% mm Hg and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure with vasodilator therapy greater than 16 mm Hg. Of the 63 noninducible patients, 11 (17%) received long-term antiarrhythmic agents due to atrial fibrillation or referring physician preference, and antiarrhythmic therapy was not associated with a lower risk of sudden death in these patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

During the follow-up period 39 patients died, 14 of congestive heart failure and 25 suddenly. The incidence of cardiac death after 1 year was 18%, after 2 years 35%, and after 4 years 39%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified four independent prognostic factors: left ventricular ejection fraction, cardiac index, number of ventricular pairs/24 hours, and atrial rhythm (sinus rhythm or atrial fibrillation). With the final model of logistic regression 77 of 88 patients (88%) could be classified correctly as being at risk for death from chronic heart failure or sudden cardiac death. Patients who were likely to die of congestive heart failure were characterized by a markedly impaired left ventricular function (measured in terms of left ventricular ejection fraction, cardiac index, or both) and a low number of pairs/24 hours. The association between frequent complex ventricular arrhythmias and depressed left ventricular function identifies patients who are at risk for sudden death. The presence of atrial fibrillation significantly increases the risk of sudden death and death from congestive heart failure.\r"

This indicated a significantly higher pressure in early diastole in the sequestered apical cavity. Filling of the apical chamber occurred late in diastole and during isovolumic ventricular contraction. The observations by Doppler of complete intraventricular systolic and partial diastolic obstruction in apical hypertrophy are new and may have significant clinical implications.\r"

The results of the exercise test were compared with the independent clinical estimation of NYHA class and data of measurements obtained at rest. The NYHA classification separated the patients with a mild to moderate impairment of aerobic capacity from patients with a moderate to severe impairment of aerobic capacity very well, but 32% of the NYHA class II patients had a near normal aerobic capacity, and 29% of the NYHA class III patients had a very severe impairment of aerobic capacity, more compatible with NYHA class IV. Only data from exercise measurements showed differences between groups. The determination of maximal aerobic capacity for an objective assessment of patients' performance at exercise is necessary for a proper selection procedure of patients for heart failure studies.\r"

  ".U": "89060024\r", 
  ".W": "Under sterile conditions, dogs were instrumented for continuous measurement of hemodynamics, and an Ameroid constrictor was positioned around the left carotid artery to produce slowly progressive narrowing of the vessel. In the awake, unsedated state, carotid cyclical blood flow reduction abruptly appeared on day 5.1 +/- 0.6 (mean +/- S.E.M.) at a frequency of 6.7 +/- 0.6 cycles per 30 minutes and usually remained present for only 1 day. The vessel was totally occluded on day 7.9 +/- 0.8. No focal neurologic deficit was observed. Following administration of the new thromboxane receptor antagonist, BM 13.505 (4-[2-(4-chlorobenzene-sulfonamide)-ethy]-benzene acetic acid), 50 and 100 micrograms/kg intravenously, the cyclical reduction in carotid blood flow was abolished for 30 +/- 5 and 45 +/- 15 minutes, respectively. No changes in systemic hemodynamics were observed over the course of the experiment. It is concluded that slowly progressive constriction of the carotid artery may provide an in vivo model for the study of perfusion deficits present in transient ischemic attacks. In addition, the results support the hypothesis that platelet aggregation plays a major role in cyclical carotid flow reduction, and the phenomenon can be eliminated by treatment with a new thromboxane receptor antagonist, BM 13.505.\r"

Of the 20 UMI patients, six had died and one with left bundle branch block was excluded. The remaining 13 UMI patients and 26 control patients underwent 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring (AECG) for SI. Two patients (one from each group) with angina were excluded from the AECG analysis. Only two (15.4%) of the UMI patients and two (7.7%) of the control patients had any AECG evidence of SI. These preliminary results suggest that routine monitoring for SI is not indicated in asymptomatic long-term survivors of UMI or in asymptomatic patients without prior MI but with otherwise similar risk profiles.\r"

We therefore evaluated the relationship between clinical characteristics and apparent Kd in 328 patients with AMI without evidence of recurrent infarction. Patients with a history of cigarette smoking within 6 months had higher rates of disappearance of CK-MB, but no relationship was found between renal function and apparent Kd. Slower rates of disappearance of CK-MB were correlated with longer times from the onset of symptoms to peak CK-MB value (p less than 0.001), while higher peak CK-MB levels were not correlated with apparent rates of enzyme clearance. Decreased rates of disappearance of CK-MB were found in patients who had congestive heart failure during or after the hospitalization (both p less than 0.05), and who died during the hospitalization or during study follow-up (both p less than 0.05). Slower rates of disappearance were also significantly correlated with lower ejection fractions on radionuclide ventriculography at 10 days (p less than 0.001) and at 3 months (p less than 0.05) after AMI. These data suggest that patients with slower rates of disappearance of CK-MB may have poorer prognoses, perhaps reflecting continuing necrosis and enzyme release from jeopardized myocardium.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine which predischarge exercise thallium-201 imaging pattern(s) best correlate with myocardial salvage following intravenous streptokinase therapy (IVSK). Myocardial salvage was defined as improvement in regional left ventricular function determined by two-dimensional echocardiography between the time of admission and time of discharge in 21 prospectively studied patients receiving IVSK within 4 hours of chest pain. All patients had coronary angiography 2 hours following IVSK. Whereas 16 of the 21 patients (76%) had patent infarct-related vessels, only seven (33%) showed significant improvement in regional function at hospital discharge. Eleven patients demonstrated persistent defects (PD), and five each showed delayed and reverse redistribution. Patients with both delayed and reverse redistribution demonstrated significant improvement in regional left ventricular function score, while those with PD did not (+3.9 +/- 3.3 versus -0.5 +/- 2.9, p = 0.004). All other clinical, exercise, electrocardiographic, scintigraphic, and angiographic variables were similar between all patients, with the exception of the interval between chest pain and the institution of IVSK, which was longer in patients with reverse compared to delayed redistribution (3.5 +/- 0.4 versus 2.2 +/- 0.4 hours, p = 0.001). It is concluded that both delayed and reverse redistribution seen on predischarge exercise thallium-201 imaging are associated with myocardial salvage, defined as serial improvement in regional systolic function. Despite a high infarct vessel patency rate in patients with acute myocardial infarction receiving IVSK within 4 hours of onset of symptoms, only one third demonstrated improvement in regional function that was associated with either delayed or reverse redistribution seen on predischarge exercise thallium-201 imaging.\r"

With early reperfusion the extent of the scar, as a percentage of left ventricular (LV) circumference, was reduced compared to the extent of the scar in rats with permanent occlusion (27 +/- 3% vs 42 +/- 2%, p less than 0.01). Early reperfusion also preserved LV topography by preventing dilation of the LV cavity and thinning of the healed free wall. Late reperfusion (90 minutes) did not reduce the extent of the scar (35 +/- 3% vs 42 +/- 2% of LV circumference, p = NS) or prevent dilation of the LV cavity compared with permanent occlusion. However, the healed free wall/noninfarcted septum ratio was significantly greater in rats with late reperfusion than in those with permanent occlusion (0.98 +/- 0.06 vs 0.73 +/- 0.07, p less than 0.05). Thus early reperfusion completely inhibited scar thinning and dilation of the LV cavity, maintaining normal LV topography. Late reperfusion, too late to reduce infarct size, still contributed to improved healing of the myocardium by resulting in a thicker scar.\r"

To establish whether a similar functional border zone exists in the conscious animal during acute regional ischemia and to determine its spatial dimensions and temporal changes, we performed simultaneous two-dimensional echocardiography and radioactive microsphere studies in nine chronically instrumented dogs. We produced circumferential flow-function maps at 22.5-degree intervals over the full circumference of the left ventricle at the midpapillary muscle level during control conditions, 5 minutes after left circumflex occlusion, and 2.5 hours after left circumflex occlusion. After occlusion there was no change in left ventricular end-diastolic area, an increase in left ventricular end-systolic area (p less than 0.01), and a decrease in left ventricular area ejection fraction (p less than 0.01). The circumferential extent of left ventricular dysfunction was 197 +/- 11 degrees (mean +/- SEM) at 5 minutes of left circumflex occlusion, whereas the extent of subendocardial hypoperfusion was 144 +/- 6 degrees (p less than 0.0005). This produced a functional border zone measuring 54 +/- 8 degrees, or 25% of the nonischemic myocardium, which did not change over the 2.5-hour occlusion period. Despite a modest but significant decrease in wall thickening (70 +/- 6% to 43 +/- 6%; p less than 0.01) in the functional border zone, there was no difference in subendocardial blood flow between the functional border zone and the control nonischemic area. We conclude that a discrete functional border zone exists in the conscious dog during acute regional ischemia produced by circumflex coronary occlusion, which does not change during the early evolution of myocardial infarction. The functional border zone likely contributes to minor overestimation of infarct size in the early hours after myocardial infarction if extent of left ventricular dysfunction is used as an index of infarction in humans.\r"

  ".W": "This study in dogs was designed to determine the effects of residual stenosis on infarct size and on the transmural distribution of coronary flow in the central and peripheral ischemic perfusion bed. A plastic shunt containing a Doppler flow probe was inserted between the left anterior descending coronary artery and the subclavian artery. The dogs were divided into two groups. Group 1 (N = 7) underwent total shunt occlusion for 2 hours followed by reperfusion at 50% of control flow for 2 hours. Group 2 (N = 8) underwent 2 hours of total occlusion followed by 2 hours of total reperfusion. Regional blood flow was measured by radiolabeled microspheres, and infarct areas were quantitated with triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining. Infarct sizes expressed as a percentage of the left ventricle or as a percentage of perfusion territory were significantly (p less than 0.05) smaller in animals with total reperfusion (group 2) than in dogs with partial reperfusion (group 1). Endocardial flows in the central infarct zone were significantly higher in dogs with total reperfusion than was observed with partial reperfusion; epicardial flows were not significantly different. In the peripheral region both endocardial flows and epicardial flows with total reperfusion were significantly higher than with partial reperfusion. These studies suggest that residual stenosis after thrombolysis may increase infarct size and reduce endocardial flow in the central infarct zone and transmural flow in the peripheral zone.\r"

The importance of this after acute coronary occlusion was examined in eight open-chest, anesthetized dogs. The left anterior descending artery was ligated while sonomicrometric segment lengths in the ischemic (IZ) and nonischemic zones (NZ) were measured. Sodium methylglucamine diatrizoate (Renografin-76, 1 ml/kg) was rapidly injected over 3 seconds. Fifteen minutes later, the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was rapidly increased to the level reached during injection. Injecting the contrast increased the LVEDP (7.3 +/- 2.5 to 20.1 +/- 2.9 mm Hg, p less than 0.0001) to the same extent as raising LVEDP (7.6 +/- 2.5 to 10.1 +/- 2.9 mm Hg, p less than 0.0001). Injecting the contrast medium increased IZ total percent systolic shortening (% delta L) (-3.90 +/- 4.43% to -2.68 +/- 4.77%, p less than 0.001) by decreasing isovolumic bulging (-6.68 +/- 4.09% to -5.49 +/- 3.33%, p less than 0.001) with little change in ejection % delta L. NZ total % delta L tended to increase (19.03 +/- 6.53% to 19.94 +/- 6.27%, p = 0.015) because of augmented ejection % delta L (13.12 +/- 2.51% to 13.71 +/- 3.10%, p = 0.017) by the Starling mechanism. Increasing the LVEDP had the same effect on IZ and NZ regional shortening as injecting contrast. Thus regional shortening after acute coronary occlusion is affected by the changes in loading conditions with ionic contrast ventriculography.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The dextrorotatory isomer of sotalol (d-sotalol) has class III antiarrhythmic properties with known action potential duration (APD) prolonging effects, and is largely devoid of beta-adrenergic blocking activity. We studied its electrophysiologic effects and the mechanism of its APD prolonging effects in sheep Purkinje fibers by means of standard microelectrode techniques. At all concentrations (10(-6) to 10(-4) mol/L), d-sotalol had no effect on Vmax. At 10(-6) mol/L, d-sotalol had no effect on APD. A concentration-dependent effect of 10(-5) to 10(-4) mol/L d-sotalol was found on APD. At peak effect, APD was prolonged by 56% and 49% at 50% (APD50) and 90% (APD90) of repolarization (p less than 0.01). Early afterdepolarizations (EADs) were noted at high concentration of d-sotalol (10(-4) mol/L). These EADs were increased in number by epinephrine. To assess the mechanism of APD prolongation, verapamil (2.0 X 10(-6) mol/L) was added before and after d-sotalol treatment. In the presence of verapamil, no APD prolongation was observed even at the highest d-sotalol concentration (10(-4) mol/L). Next, during APD prolongation at the highest d-sotalol concentration, we added verapamil, noticing a remarkable shortening of APD. In addition, d-sotalol-induced EADs disappeared with addition of verapamil. Thus (1) verapamil blocks d-sotalol-induced APD prolongation and EADs and (2) this may be consistent with a mechanism via slow inward current.\r"

This procedure was performed in two neonates with excellent immediate clinical results and objective improvement in the pressure gradient. The mechanism of relief of obstruction appears to be ductal dilatation, which allows bypassing the posterolateral shelf of aortic coarctation. This technique is recommended in neonatal coarctations with open ductus arteriosus, especially if the femoral artery cannot be catheterized for performing conventional transfermoral balloon coarctation angioplasty.\r"

  ".W": "Palliation of hypoplastic left-heart syndrome involves use of the morphologic right ventricle as the systemic ventricle and the tricuspid valve (in cases of mitral atresia/stenosis) or the common atrioventricular valve (in cases of malaligned atrioventricular canal) as the systemic atrioventricular valve. To determine the relationship between tricuspid or common atrioventricular valve function and the ultimate outcome of palliative surgery, 100 patients with hypoplastic left-heart syndrome were evaluated preoperatively by Doppler echocardiography to determine the degree of tricuspid regurgitation. These patients were then followed serially to assess changes with time in the functional status of the tricuspid or common atrioventricular valve and to determine the correlation of tricuspid or common atrioventricular valve regurgitation with survival. We discovered that tricuspid or common atrioventricular valve regurgitation is common in hypoplastic left-heart syndrome. Thirty-seven percent of the patients had mild, 13% had moderate, and 3% had severe tricuspid or common atrioventricular valve regurgitation on their preoperative Doppler echocardiograms. Throughout the first 2 postoperative years most patients had no significant change in the degree of tricuspid or common atrioventricular valve regurgitation when findings were compared to those of the preoperative echocardiogram. Patients with moderate or severe tricuspid or common atrioventricular valve regurgitation preoperatively had a significant reduction in their survival when contrasted with patients with no or mild atrioventricular valve regurgitation. We therefore conclude that tricuspid or common atrioventricular valve competence is a significant factor in long-term survival after palliative surgery for hypoplastic left-heart syndrome. This function, however, appears to be unaffected by palliation and remains relatively constant over the first 2 postoperative years.\r"

Results of studies performed during the first 10 days of life showed no significant difference in transmitral flow velocity or velocity-time integral measurements between full-term and preterm neonates. Values for transtricuspid velocity measurements were slightly lower in preterm infants, but E/A velocity ratio and relative contribution of E and A components to the total velocity-time integral were unchanged. Within the group of preterm infants gestational age did not affect any of the diastolic flow parameters. As preterm infants aged velocity of flow increased, but no changes were noted in the relative contributions of rapid ventricular filling and atrial contraction, either in terms of velocity of flow-velocity integral measurements. Doppler assessment of diastolic ventricular filling can provide an accessible method for serial evaluation of preterm infants. Values noted in \"normal\" premature infants resemble those found in full-term infants.\r"

  ".W": "To overcome the assumptions and approximations mandated by the use of traditional wall motion methodologies, a method was recently developed for measuring ventricular shape based on quantitative curvature analysis of ventricular outlines. This study was designed to assess prospectively the performance of this algorithm, to compare it to traditional wall motion measurements (centerline method), and to determine the comparative degree to which each method mimicked the interpretation of wall motion by clinical observers. Semiquantitative visual grading of regional function in 52 patients was performed by four independent observers on two occasions. Anterior, apical, or inferior segments were judged to be normal (0 points) or abnormal (1 point) based on viewing nonrealigned, end-diastolic and end-systolic ventricular silhouettes from cineventriculograms obtained in the 30-degree right anterior oblique projection. Each segment was assigned a collated score ranging from 0 (all observers felt the region was normal on both readings) to 8 (all observers felt the region was abnormal on both readings). Quantitative regional curvature analysis and wall motion analysis (centerline method) were performed. Quantitative shape and wall motion scores correlated equally well with the semiquantitative visual scores. When a visual score of greater than or equal to 4 was used to designate an abnormal segment, both quantitative approaches demonstrated comparable sensitivity, specificity, and concordance rates. Both methods achieved optimal performance when maximum and minimum deviations from normal were recorded. Under these circumstances, the shape analysis demonstrated a greater concordance with the clinical diagnosis than did wall motion analysis (99% vs-93%, p less than 0.04).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate whether patients with silent myocardial ischemia during exercise testing are at increased risk for developing a subsequent acute myocardial infarction or sudden death, the data on 424 such patients with proven coronary artery disease (CAD) from the Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS) registry were analyzed. These patients (group 1) were compared with 456 other patients with CAD (group 2) who had both ischemic ST depression and angina pectoris during exercise testing and with 1,019 control patients without CAD. The probability of remaining free of a subsequent acute myocardial infarction or sudden death at 7 years was 80 and 91%, respectively, for group 1, 82 and 93%, respectively, for group 2 (difference not significant, compared with group 1), and 98 and 99%, respectively, for the control patients (p less than 0.001), compared with group 1 or 2). Among patients in group 1, the probability of remaining free of myocardial infarction and sudden death at 7 years was related to the severity of CAD and presence of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, and ranged from 90% for patients with 1-vessel CAD and preserved LV function to 38% for patients with 3-vessel CAD and abnormal LV function (p less than 0.001). Thus, patients with either silent or symptomatic ischemia during exercise testing have a similar risk of developing an acute myocardial infarction or sudden death--except in the 3-vessel CAD subgroup, where the risk is greater in silent ischemia. The risk of patients with silent myocardial ischemia is based primarily on angiographic variables.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis under investigation was that the beneficial effect of type A behavioral counseling on survival after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was conditional on the functioning of the cardiovascular system, as determined by the severity of the prior AMI. Subjects were 862 nonsmoking coronary patients in the San Francisco Bay Area, randomized in 1978 to receive, over 4.5 years, cardiac counseling or cardiac counseling plus type A behavioral counseling. Sixteen baseline factors plus an interaction term (severity of AMI X behavioral counseling) were evaluated for their prognostic significance. Behavioral counseling was not a significant predictor of coronary death in the total cohort, but the interaction between counseling and severity of the prior AMI was (p less than 0.05). Thus, the total cohort was divided into 2 subgroups of mild or serious prior AMI, and independent predictors of survival were isolated within each subgroup. In the subgroup with mild prior AMI, independent predictors were anterior AMI (p = 0.02), plasma cholesterol (p = 0.02) and behavioral counseling (p = 0.05). In the subgroup with serious prior AMI, none of the factors evaluated made a significant independent contribution. These findings suggest that a reduction in type A behavior may exert the greatest protection against coronary death in that subgroup of patients for whom the biologic aspects of coronary artery disease are not advanced. They also demonstrate the importance of considering the level of cardiac functioning before determining predictors of survival or optimum postcoronary care.\r"

Coronary arteriography was performed in all patients 5.4 +/- 2.4 days after admission. There was no difference in clinical, exercise or scintigraphic variables between patients with stenoses less than 50% and patients with 1-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) defined as a diameter stenosis greater than or equal to 50%. Patients with 3-vessel CAD had a significantly shorter exercise duration than patients with less than 50%-diameter narrowing (5.5 +/- 2.2 vs 8.3 +/- 3.3 minutes, respectively), lower exercise heart rate (119 +/- 20 vs 149 +/- 22 beats/min) and systolic blood pressure (156 +/- 29 vs 166 +/- 33 mm Hg), more frequent chest pain (76 vs 20%) and more pronounced ST depression (-1.48 +/- 1.37 vs -0.33 +/- 0.72 mm). In addition, thallium defect size on exercise was greater in the patients with 2-vessel CAD (159 +/- 132 degrees) and 3-vessel CAD (255 +/- 132 degrees) than in patients with no CAD (28 +/- 319 degrees) or 1-vessel CAD (73 +/- 78 degrees), p greater than or equal to 0.05. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that thallium defect size was the best predictor of extent of CAD, with exercise heart rate and presence of chest pain during exercise also predictive of extent of CAD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy of these contractility indexes were compared with angina and ST depression during exercise. Thirty consecutive patients referred for chest pain performed symptom-limited bicycle exercise and had coronary angiography within 3 months. Twenty-two had angiographically significant coronary artery disease and 8 had normal coronary anatomy. Systolic BP was measured by sphygmomanometry; LV ejection fraction and end-systolic volume were obtained by nuclear ventriculography. Normal values for contractility indexes were defined as LV ejection fraction greater than 52% at rest and increment of greater than or equal to 5% during exercise, and systolic BP to end-systolic volume ratio greater than 2.2 mm Hg/ml at rest and greater than 3.0 mm Hg/ml during exercise. The sensitivity of systolic BP to end-systolic volume ratio to identify patients with coronary artery disease at rest was 71 vs 33% for LV ejection fraction. During exercise, each contractility index had a sensitivity of 95% and there was a combined sensitivity of 100%. This compares with 71% for ST depression and 48% for exercise-induced angina. Thus, 52% had no angina and 36% of them were also silent by electrocardiography. Among the patients with symptomatic ischemia, 20% had no ST-segment depression. Measurement of contractility indexes enhanced the detection of silent myocardial ischemia and provided information on LV function vital to prognosis and management of patients with coronary artery disease.\r"

While recent studies have demonstrated that 2-dimensional echocardiographic monitoring of left ventricular (LV) function after intravenous dipyridamole has a sensitivity somewhat less than that of thallium perfusion imaging, none has examined the usefulness of Doppler evaluation of aortic blood flow in this setting. One hundred patients undergoing dipyridamole-thallium imaging for clinical indications were studied. Technically adequate Doppler echocardiographic studies were obtained in 97 patients. LV ejection fraction, peak aortic velocity and acceleration, as well as segmental LV wall motion, were analyzed before and at peak dipyridamole effect. Thallium perfusion images were normal in 41 and abnormal in 53 patients studied. A statistically significant difference in percent change from baseline to peak dipyridamole effect in velocity, acceleration and ejection fraction was seen between the 2 groups (26 vs -2%, 51 vs -2% and 16 vs 4%, respectively, all p less than 0.05). Comparison of 2-dimensional wall motion analysis to thallium yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 74 and 80%, respectively. In the group of patients who underwent cardiac catheterization, 2-dimensional wall motion analysis yielded a sensitivity of 64% in the detection of CAD. The combination of 2-dimensional and Doppler echocardiographic parameters increased the sensitivity in the detection of CAD to 85%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

There was no significant difference in the 3-year actuarial recurrence rate between the positive and negative outcomes (32 vs 24%, respectively). At 3 years, patients with positive outcomes had higher rates of sudden death than patients with negative results (48 vs 9%, respectively, p less than 0.002). The 3-year total mortality rate was also markedly higher in patients with positive results than among those with negative outcomes (61 vs 15%, respectively, p less than 0.001). Multivariate analyses showed mortality to be independently associated with unsustained ventricular tachycardia on prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring. It was concluded that patients with electrophysiologically positive results had high rates of sudden death and total mortality that have not been previously well recognized.\r"

The SN effective refractory period (ERP) is defined as the longest premature interval resulting in an interpolated atrial return response. In the present study, SNERP was analyzed in 71 subjects--51 control persons and 20 patients with evidence of SN dysfunction. SNERP could be measured in 40 of 51 control subjects and was shown to prolong at shorter basic pacing cycle lengths. At a basic cycle length of 600 ms, SNERP was 330 +/- 40 ms, whereas at 500 ms it was 350 +/- 50 ms (p less than 0.05). At a basic cycle length of 600 ms, SNERP was measured in 31 control subjects and 7 patients with SN dysfunction. The values of 330 +/- 40 and 520 +/- 20 ms, respectively, in these 2 groups suggested that this method can be used to differentiate patients with SN dysfunction (p less than 0.001). In 12 control subjects, SNERP was measured before and after partial autonomic blockade with propranolol and atropine. SNERP shortened from 360 +/- 40 to 320 +/- 40 ms (p less than 0.05). It shortened with atropine and prolonged with propranolol. Thus, SNERP prolongs with a shorter basic pacing cycle length and is affected by autonomic manipulation, in a fashion analogous to the atrioventricular node.\r"

Using a standard quadripolar catheter with high amplification and low-pass filters, SN electrograms were recorded in 11 of 26 (42%) pediatric cardiac patients (age range 10 months to 18 years) with normal SN function. The sinoatrial conduction time was measured directly from the SN electrogram and estimated indirectly by the premature stimulation and continuous pacing methods. The direct sinoatrial conduction time (15 to 91 ms) in these 11 patients (ages 1 to 18 years) correlated well with that estimated by the premature stimulation method (r = 0.81, n = 9, p less than 0.01). There was a poor correlation between the direct and continuous pacing methods (r = 0.53, n = 8, p = 0.17).

To investigate the return of atrial transport function and its relation to the duration of the arrhythmia, Doppler echocardiography was performed after conversion in 18 patients with acute AF (less than or equal to 1 week duration), 14 patients with chronic AF (greater than 1 week duration) and 15 control patients. Flow velocities during rapid filling (E wave) and atrial systole (A wave) were measured in both left and right ventricles. Patients in the acute AF group had left ventricular A waves (49 +/- 4 cm/s) and A/E ratios (0.97 +/- 0.1) similar to those of the control patients (55 +/- 7 cm/s, 0.87 +/- 0.08, respectively). In contrast, patients in the chronic AF group had much smaller A waves (19 +/- 5 cm/s) and A/E ratios (0.30 +/- 0.08) than those in the other 2 groups (p less than 0.001). Five patients with chronic AF (36%) had complete left atrial paralysis (A/E = 0) despite normal sinus P waves. Measurements in the right ventricle showed similar differences among the groups. Patients with chronic AF who maintained sinus rhythm showed an increase in A/E ratio to control levels, from 0.45 +/- 0.1 to 0.93 +/- 0.1 (p = 0.003) at 48 days (average) after conversion. Thus, atrial transport function is normal after brief periods of AF, but reduced or absent when conversion is achieved after the arrhythmia has been sustained greater than 1 week.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this study, the clinical features and arrhythmic outcome of 43 survivors of VF without inducible VT at control programmed stimulation were examined. In 38 patients, factors that may have played a potentiating role in the genesis of VF included ischemia in 15, proarrhythmia in 18, rapid rate response to atrial fibrillation in 3 and acute alcoholism in 2. Three patients required antiarrhythmic drugs for supraventricular tachyarrhythmia and 40 patients were discharged without antiarrhythmic therapy. At 32 +/- 21 months (range 1 to 82), 37 (92%) have remained free of arrhythmic recurrence while 3 have had sustained subsequent major arrhythmic events (syncope 1 patient, VF 1, sudden cardiac death 1). Thus, survivors of VF without inducible VT at drug-free control programmed stimulation are characterized by (1) potentiating factors--often identifiable and correctable--that may be important to the genesis of VF; (2) generally low risk of arrhythmic recurrence; and (3) effective long-term management often achieved without the use of additional antiarrhythmic drugs or antitachycardia/defibrillation devices.\r"

At peak dopamine level, cardiac index increased by 14% from baseline (1.95 +/- 0.55 to 2.27 +/- 0.45 liters/min/m2, p less than 0.05), stroke volume index increased by 14% (22.4 +/- 6.0 to 25.9 +/- 5.8 ml/min/m2, p less than 0.01).

There was no significant change from baseline in heart rate, mean arterial pressure, right atrial pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance and rate-pressure product. In addition, as the arterial dopamine level increased there was a concomitant decrease in plasma norepinephrine level that was sustained for the period of observation. In a subgroup of 8 patients, there was no change in coronary sinus blood flow, myocardial oxygen consumption, myocardial oxygen extraction, lactate extraction and transmyocardial release of catecholamines after levodopa. These findings suggest that oral levodopa, 1.5 g, can improve left ventricular function without adversely affecting myocardial energetics and catecholamine balance.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with heart failure frequently report leg fatigue during exercise. At present, however, there is no objective method of detecting leg muscle abnormalities in such patients. To determine if phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy can provide such information, this technique was used to compare calf responses to stair climbing and plantarflexion in 20 patients with heart failure (peak oxygen consumption (VO2) of 13.6 +/- 5 ml/kg/min, ejection fraction 20 +/- 5%) and 9 age-matched normal subjects. Work was quantified by measuring VO2. At rest, both groups exhibited similar inorganic phosphorus to phosphocreatine (Pi/PCr) ratios (patients with heart failure 0.21 +/- 0.07, normal subjects 0.21 +/- 0.06, difference not significant) and pH levels (patients with heart failure 7.06 +/- 0.17, normal subjects 7.05 +/- 0.11, difference not significant). In both normal subjects and patients with heart failure, exercise resulted in a progressive rise in Pi/PCr as VO2 increased. However, examination of the relation of VO2 versus Pi/PCr revealed steeper slopes in patients with heart failure during both stair climbing and plantar-flexion. Neither form of exercise decreased calf pH in normal subjects. In the patients with heart failure, significant decreases in pH were noted during the highest work level of plantarflexion (pH of heart failure patients 6.86 +/- 0.20, pH of normal subjects 7.07 +/- 0.14, p less than 0.01). Metabolic recovery time was also prolonged in the patients with heart failure versus normal subjects (3.3 +/- 0.8 vs 2.1 +/- 0.5 minutes, respectively, p less than 0.002). These findings indicate that phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance provides objective evidence of leg muscle abnormalities in patients with heart failure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "An analysis of the mechanisms of action of balloon valvuloplasty in adult aortic stenosis (AS), based on postmortem studies on fresh specimens and on clinical experience with 300 consecutive cases, is reported. When maximally inflated, a 20-mm diameter balloon (occupying a 3.14 cm2 cross-sectional area) significantly enlarges the stenosed valve orifice by 3 mechanisms: stretching of valve tissue, rupturing of commissural fusion and breaking of calcific deposits. These last 2 mechanisms are the most effective, in both tricuspid and bicuspid forms of AS, to render the cusps more flexible and able to open during systole and to close at the time of ventricular diastole. The marked increase in valve area obtained by the dilatation procedure was clearly demonstrated on fresh postmortem specimens and also on postmortem examination of cases that had had balloon valvuloplasty during life. Stretching alone may give only a temporary increase in valve area with an elastic return of the leaflets to their initial stenosing position and may explain, at least in part, the occurrence of restenosis. Inflation of the balloon is well tolerated with no deleterious decrease in blood pressure in two-thirds of the cases because the balloon opens the commissures, allowing blood ejection through these openings. It does not produce calcific emboli, probably because calcium deposits remain imbedded in the leaflets, covered by the endothelium. Finally, it very infrequently produces acute severe aortic regurgitation. Careful choice of balloon size is necessary to obtain on effective opening; most often a 20-mm diameter balloon but sometimes a balloon up to 23 mm is used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The hemodynamic effects of intravenous disopyramide were determined in 43 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and pressure gradients at rest (resting obstruction). The basal subaortic pressure gradient decreased in all patients by a mean of 61 mm Hg (range 16 to 123); in 35 patients the gradient was abolished (less than 20 mm Hg). The reduction in pressure gradient was achieved through a decrease in left ventricular systolic pressure, from 178 to 135 mm Hg (p less than 0.0001), and a rise in aortic systolic pressure, from 105 to 123 mm Hg (p less than 0.0001). Left ventricular ejection time was reduced from 326 to 273 ms (p less than 0.0001). Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure decreased from 19 to 16 mm Hg (p less than 0.0001). In a subgroup of 13 patients, cardiac output was unchanged after disopyramide, despite a prolongation of the pre-ejection period from 104 to 137 ms (p less than 0.0001) indicating a decrease in contractility. The maintenance of cardiac output, despite a decrease in contractility, may reflect a decrease in mitral regurgitation resulting from the reduction of systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve by disopyramide. These results indicate that disopyramide produces predictably favorable hemodynamic effects in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and resting obstruction to left ventricular outflow.\r"

  ".W": "Atrioventricular (AV) discordance with ventriculoarterial (VA) concordance is a rare form of congenital heart disease that consists of 5 different anatomic types. The salient therapeutic consideration uniting these 5 different anatomic entities is that anatomic correction can be achieved by an atrial switch procedure with closure of any associated septal defect. Three patients who had AV discordance with VA concordance are presented, with emphasis upon 2-dimensional echocardiographic diagnosis and surgical management. One of these patients had ventricular inversion with inverted normally related great arteries in situs solitus (i.e., [S,L,I]), thus representing a form of congenital heart disease that until now has not been documented anatomically. Although these are complex defects, multiple-plane imaging with 2-dimensional echocardiography was found to be extremely reliable in ascertaining the anatomy when a comprehensive, segmental analysis is applied. This approach includes determination of visceroatrial situs, ventricular loop and great arterial position and alignment. A surgical approach to closure of the ventricular septal defect through the left-sided infundibulum in isolated ventricular inversion afforded excellent exposure of the defect and avoided AV conduction block.\r"

In ligand competition experiments, nifedipine and nitrendipine completely displaced binding with partial displacement by verapamil and 35% enhancement of binding by 10(-5) M diltiazem at 37 degrees. Analyses of right atrial appendages obtained at open heart surgery from 5 coronary artery bypass patients provided similar results (KD = 0.2 +/- 0.03 nM, Bmax = 42 +/- 2 fmol/mg protein). In addition, no significant differences in KD or Bmax were found in 3 hamster hearts assayed at the time of death or up to 18 hours postmortem at either 4 or 25 degrees. In contrast, there was a significant increase in Bmax (110 fmol/mg protein) with no change in KD (0.3 nM) in a myomectomy specimen from a patient with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy compared with either autopsy or surgical specimens. These studies illustrate the feasibility and potential advantages of studying calcium channels directly in human hearts.\r"

The standard 12-lead electrocardiogram is the easiest and most widely used noninvasive method for the diagnosis of LV hypertrophy; unfortunately, the diagnostic accuracy of commonly used electrocardiographic criteria remains unsatisfactory. Body surface potential maps contain diagnostic information not present in conventional lead systems. The present investigation combines the increased information content of surface maps with the power of multivariate statistical techniques in order to identify practical subsets of electrocardiographic leads that would allow improved diagnosis of LV hypertrophy. Discriminant analysis was performed on 120-lead data simultaneously recorded in 250 normal subjects and 214 patients with LV hypertrophy using as features instantaneous voltages on time-normalized P, PR, QRS and ST-T waveforms as well as the duration of these waveforms. Leads and features for optimal separation of 173 normal subjects aged greater than or equal to 30 years from 122 patients with pure LV hypertrophy were selected. A total of 6 features from 5 torso sites accounted for a specificity of 97% and a sensitivity of 94%. The single most potent discriminator was the duration of the P wave; voltages were measured in mid and late P on leads located in the lower left parasternal area, the left precordial region and the upper right back, in mid-QRS on a lead positioned 10 cm below V1 and slightly before the peak of the T wave on a lead in the lower left flank.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In an attempt to extend the benefits of angioplasty and valvuloplasty to patients with more advanced coronary and valvular heart disease, semipercutaneous cardiopulmonary circulatory support has been used as an adjunct to these interventions. In our initial experience with supported angioplasty/valvuloplasty, 11 vessels in 9 patients and 6 aortic valves were successfully dilated. Complete cardiopulmonary support was achieved in all cases, permitting prolonged balloon inflations; intraprocedural complications were limited to vessel injury and blood loss. One patient each died after angioplasty and valvuloplasty. Symptomatic improvement was observed in all surviving patients.\r"

Most patients were admitted within 2 hours of onset of symptoms and received 1.5 million units of streptokinase over a 30- to 60-minute period. Clinical observations and serial creatine phosphokinase-MB were indicative of vessel patency in 115 (88%) of the patients after initiation of thrombolysis. Of this group, 105 underwent catheterization, and recanalization was demonstrated in 97 (92%). Fifty percent of the patients who underwent reperfusion were subsequently maintained with medical therapy; 50% underwent either percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery. Major morbidity was confined to hematomas; no cerebral bleeding was encountered. There was 1 early death from cerebral thrombosis and 2 late deaths, 1 to cancer and 1 to myocardial infarction. These findings suggest the benefit of intravenous streptokinase thrombolysis in patients with acute myocardial infarction presenting within 3 hours of onset of pain, unless specific potential bleeding problems exist or in the case of certain very elderly persons. In addition, the trial demonstrated the feasibility of triaging patients who have undergone lytic therapy to a central facility for catheterization and management.\r"

Paraffin-embedded sections of a comprehensive panel of 113 lung carcinomas were analyzed for the expression of three general markers common to all NE cells, namely, chromogranin A, Leu-7 and neuron-specific enolase (NSE), five specific NE secretory products, and four other tumor markers by immunohistochemistry using the sensitive avidin-biotinylated peroxidase technique. The authors were able to demonstrate the following: (1) most, but not all carcinoids and SCLCs expressed multiple NE markers in a high percentage of tumor cells; (2) up to a half of NSCLC cases contained small subpopulations of cells expressing NE in a high percentage of tumor cells; (2) up to half of NSCLC cases contained small subpopulations of cells expressing NE markers; and (3) occasional NSCLCs showed staining patterns indistinguishable from SCLC. Specifically, 7 of 77 NSCLCs expressed four or more NE markers. NE markers in NSCLCs were more commonly expressed in adenocarcinomas and large cell carcinomas and rarely in squamous cell carcinomas. For comparison, the mean number of NE markers expressed by all cases of NSCLC was 1.5, carcinoids 6.0, and SCLCs 3.8. Individual \"marker counts\" were not useful in categorizing lung tumors as carcinoids and SCLC versus NSCLC. Instead, 95% of the tumors were correctly classified, applying a statistical model created from staining indices of the three general NE markers (chromogranin A, Leu-7, NSE) and three other tumor markers (carcinoembryonic antigen, keratin, vimentin). Because NSCLCs with NE features might have different clinical characteristics than other NSCLCs, immunohistochemistry provides an effective manner to identify this biologically interesting subset of NSCLCs in routine paraffin sections.\r"

Twelve cases of CS were analyzed by immunohistochemical methods with a broad panel of routinely used antibodies. The epithelial elements were classified as tubuloglandular components, stromal cells, and solid nests. The authors' results indicated the following: (1) The inner cell layers of tubuloglandular components have distinct epithelial features with cytokeratin (CK), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) positivity. (2) The outer cell layers had negative results for muscle-specific actin (MSA), desmin, CEA, EMA, and CK (if antibody AE1/3 was used) and had positive results for vimentin, S-100 protein, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and in three cases for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). (3) The stromal cells and, to a lesser extent, the solid nests expressed immunophenotypes similar to those of the outer cell layers. These data suggest that the stromal components may derive from the outer cells of the tubuloglandular elements but derive from the outer cells of the tubuloglandular elements but do not confirm their exclusive myoepithelial origin.\r"

DNA ploidy did not have significant association with prognosis, but the two patients with aneuploid lymphoma who died had the largest DNA indices measured (1.63 and 2.03). Patients with lymphoma with greater than 10% S phase cells had poorer crude survival rate (P = 0.01) and survival rate corrected for known intercurrent deaths (P = 0.002) than patients with lymphoma with less than 10% S phase cells. In multivariate analysis, age at diagnosis, sex, histologic subtype, and S phase fraction had independent prognostic value.\r"

  ".W": "Peripheral natural killer (NK) cells were identified by their morphologic appearance as large granular lymphocytes (LGLs) in a cytocentrifuged or spun blood film but not in thin wedge blood film. The authors studied the effect of different methods of sample preparation and staining on the enumeration of peripheral human LGLs as a routine test. In the blood film made from anticoagulated venous blood, LGLs were scattered in a field and sometimes deformed by compression of erythrocytes. In a blood film made from mononuclear cells, LGLs were shrunken, rendering it difficult to always identify cytoplasmic granules. In contrast, LGLs were easily and accurately identified in a blood film made from leukocyte-rich plasma, displaying none of the above artifacts. As well, the percentage of LGLs obtained was similar to that obtained from a blood film made from anticoagulated venous blood. In addition, May-Grunwald-Giemsa (MGG) stained azurophilic granules more clearly than did Giemsa above. As a result of these observations, a blood film that was made from leukocyte-rich plasma and that was stained by MGG was considered to be most suitable for the routine enumeration of LGL. Using this method, the authors found a significant correlation between the percentages of LGLs and Leu-7+ cells in the same subjects (r = 0.71; n = 22; P less than 0.001) and also a significant sex difference in the percentages of peripheral LGLs, which were significantly lower in women (17.0 +/- 3.6%; n = 35; P less than 0.05) than in men (19.5 +/- 5.3%; n = 20). Furthermore, the percentage of LGLs with abundant cytoplasmic granules, which might have greater NK activity, was also significantly lower in women (15.9 +/- 3.1%; n = 35; P less than 0.01) than in men (17.9 +/- 4.0%; n = 20).\r"

Forty-eight subjects were found to be leukopenic at the time of the study, and two subjects were found to have hairy cell leukemia. All subjects had positive exposure histories and were healthy at the time of the study. Review of peripheral smears identified the patients with marrow abnormalities. Bone marrow cultures revealed several patients with possible marrow suppression. Chromosome studies were not diagnostic. Five-year follow-up health questionnaires revealed no significant health problems; the two workers with hairy cell leukemia are alive and fully functional. Leukopenia in itself does not appear to be a risk factor for poor health, and it is unknown whether or not it may be a useful screening tool to identify workers at risk in toxic environments. Careful evaluation of blood cell counts and peripheral smears should be sufficient to identify people with potential marrow abnormalities.\r"

In the authors' study, cation-exchange column chromatographic GHb values on 84 nondiabetic patients heterozygous for Hb S, 28 AS diabetic patients, and 23 nondiabetic patients heterozygous for Hb C were calculated to account for the percentage of abnormal Hb, and the resulting values were compared with the GHb values obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). There existed a good correlation between the calculated GHb and the GHb obtained by HPLC (r = 0.92 for AS and r = 0.94 for AC). In patients with elevated Hb F, chromatographic GHb values are falsely high. In such cases, correction can be made by subtracting the Hb F value from the observed GHb. In laboratories where cation exchange chromatography is used, accurate determination of GHb can be made by adjusting observed values for portion of the abnormal Hb present.\r"

Specimens were drawn proximal to the IV line, while the solution was infusing, and at 1, 2, and 3 minutes after discontinuance of the infusion and assayed for glucose, sodium, chloride, and red blood cell (RBC) count. Control samples were obtained simultaneously from the opposite arm to determine any residual or dilutional effects from the infusing solution. Statistical analysis using the paired sample t-test showed no significant difference of RBCs between arms at or beyond 1 minute. Statistical power analysis reveals that there is a 95% level of certainty that there is less than 1% dilution of the test arm specimen. Analysis of sodium and chloride levels showed no contamination of the test arm specimen at 1 minute, but glucose concentrations still showed an average elevation over control of 5% at 3 minutes. The authors concluded that the drawing of blood specimens proximal to an IV infusion, 3 minutes after its discontinuance, has a clinically negligable dilutional effect but substances present at relatively high levels in the infused solution may still be detected.\r"

The CSF TRAP enhances patient care by decreasing the need for repeat lumbar punctures and providing reserve fluid for the following: (1) further CSF testing; (2) repeating questionable test results; and (3) laboratory accidents. The CSF TRAP has been approved for third-party payment because it promotes efficient laboratory utilization by encouraging clinicians to review initial CSF findings before ordering low-yield CSF assays such as the venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) and cryptococcal antigen latex agglutination tests. Currently, CSF TRAP samples are being obtained with 40% of all CSF acquisitions at the Duke University Medical Center. The availability of the CSF TRAP was associated with a significant decrease in the ordering of CSF VDRL and cryptococcal antigen assays (P less than 0.05); however, there was no significant change in the proportion of those studies being performed on normal CSF. The CSF TRAP procedure provides the framework for an overall restructuring of CSF testing that is being investigated.\r"

GM was identified in 25 subjects (22%). Eighty-three subjects (72%) had histologic duodenitis, but in only 10 did the infiltrate include neutrophils (grade 2 duodenitis). C. pylori was found in the stomach in 36 subjects (31%), all of whom had gastritis, but was not identified histologically in the duodenum. There were no significant differences between the overall frequency of duodenitis and either GM or antral C. pylori. Although the frequency of severe (grade 2) duodenitis was not significantly different between those with and those without GM, grade 2 duodenitis was found in 9 of 36 subjects with antral C. pylori but in only 1 of 80 without antral C. pylori (P less than 0.001). These findings suggest that gastric metaplasia is a common finding in the normal population and that grade 1 duodenitis is most likely clinically unimportant, whereas grade 2 duodenitis is usually associated with antral C. pylori.\r"

We conclude that IgM-enriched immunoglobulin therapy in conjunction with antibiotic therapy significantly reduces mortality from neonatal sepsis.\r"

The remaining 40% of the group had low to normal TSH values. High TSH levels were predominant in patients under 4 years of age (94 children), ie, during the phase of active growth, and showed a declining trend with increasing age. All 94 infants had delayed growth of all parameters including head circumference, height, and weight, as compared with normal infants, and growth was particularly retarded in patients with TSH levels greater than 5.7 mU/L. Thyroid dysfunction, expressed as a high TSH concentration, is associated with growth retardation in children with Down's syndrome who are younger than 4 years.\r"

Multivariate techniques were used to assess the association between behavior and injuries while controlling for social, demographic, and psychological characteristics. Boys' behavior at age 5 years was more strongly predictive of injuries in the subsequent five years than was girls' behavior. The odds of experiencing injuries resulting in hospitalization in boys with high aggression scores was 2.4 times that of boys with low aggression scores. The identification of high-risk children provides the foundation for understanding the behavioral mechanisms that contribute to injuries and for developing preventive strategies tailored to the needs of these children.\r"

To determine whether spontaneous GH secretion is normal after treatment, we assessed GH secretion before and after a four- to five-month course of testosterone enanthate in eight adolescents with CD. Before testosterone therapy, the mean (+/- 1 SD) 24-hour integrated concentration of GH (IC-GH) by constant blood withdrawal technique was 1.7 +/- 1.0 micrograms/L (normal range for age, 3.2 to 11.5 micrograms/L), and the IC-testosterone was 1.8 +/- 2.7 nmol/L. Two patients restudied during treatment had normal IC-GH values. After testosterone treatment, the mean IC-GH of the entire group was 3.3 +/- 2.6 micrograms/L, and the IC-testosterone was 6.5 +/- 5.3 nmol/L. Five of eight patients had IC-GH values that were again subnormal. A subnormal IC-GH associated with CD may persist after testosterone therapy is discontinued. Deficiency of spontaneous GH secretion may contribute to short stature and slower growth rates in this patient group. Whether GH therapy in these patients would have a beneficial effect on final height is unknown.\r"

The mechanism for zinc deficiency in certain patients with SCD is unknown, although renal loss of zinc has been suggested as a contributing factor. The zinc status of 29 subjects with SCD and 18 black controls was studied. No evidence of zinc deficiency in our population with SCD was found when plasma and cellular zinc levels were measured. Likewise, levels of two zinc-dependent enzymes, alkaline phosphatase and delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, were normal in these subjects with SCD. Although adolescent subjects with SCD tended to be shorter than control subjects, there was no correlation between the height-forage z score and plasma zinc levels (r = -.31). It was concluded that zinc deficiency was not present in our population with SCD, and that there was no correlation between plasma zinc levels and the height-for-age z score in growing adolescent patients with SCD. These findings suggested that zinc supplementation may not be necessary in all patients with SCD.\r"

At the time of analysis, recurrent disease was found in 86 of 380 colon cancer patients and 21 of 72 rectal cancer patients. Local recurrence, defined as tumor within 400 cm2 of the primary, was present in 38 of 86 colon, and 11 of 21 rectal cancer patients. Of those 49 local recurrences, 15 were intraluminal, 6 of which were initially detected by a follow-up endoscopy program. Time to diagnosis, stage of disease, and survival were similar for patients whose lesions were detected by routine endoscopy versus those found by other means. New primary (metachronous) lesions defined as an intraluminal lesion occurring at least 5 cm beyond the surgical anastomosis were identified in six colon cancer patients and no rectal cancer patients. Of these six lesions, four were discovered during routine endoscopy. Thus, a routine follow-up endoscopy program is an important tool for the detection of intraluminal recurrence of colon and rectal cancer in patients who have undergone curative resection. However, routine follow-up endoscopy should not be the sole method of follow-up, since the incidence of intraluminal recurrence is small, and may initially be detected by other means in the majority of cases.\r"

Two definitions of orocecal transit time by the hydrogen breath test were evaluated: the time from lactulose ingestion to a sustained increase of over 5 ppm above fasting levels in the end-expiratory hydrogen concentration (definition A) and the interval to that of over 10 ppm (definition B). The orocecal transit time measured by the radiologic method was 63 +/- 9 min (mean +/- SEM), whereas that using definition A of the hydrogen breath test was 74 +/- 9 min, and that using definition B was 87 +/- 10 min. Transit times determined by both definitions closely correlated with that obtained by the radiologic method (A, r = 0.86, p less than 0.01; B, r = 0.81, p less than 0.01). Therefore, elevation of end-expiratory hydrogen concentrations seemed to coincide with cecal appearance of the head of the lactulose load. When the mean transit times were compared with findings in case of the radiologic method, definition A rather than B appeared to be more appropriate to determine orocecal transit time.\r"

SPGE studies were performed pre-bubble implantation and repeated within 2 wk after bubble implant. There was no significant difference between study patients pre-bubble insertion emptying time and the normal population curve. Emptying time was found to be significantly increased, post-bubble implant, compared with pre-bubble implant over five time periods of testing. The Garren-Edwards gastric bubble has been used as a method for inducing early satiety for the morbidly obese patient. It has been postulated that delay of SPGE would be associated with satiety. Our patients experienced satiety despite their more rapid SPGE. Thus, the satiety which was experienced by our subjects was not on the basis of delayed SPGE, as previously thought.\r"

The endogastric pH was continuously recorded for 12 h (8 PM-8 AM) after random, single-blind administration of one of the following drug regimens: 20 mg famotidine, 150 mg ranitidine, 50 mg pirenzepine, 20 mg famotidine plus 50 mg pirenzepine, and 150 mg ranitidine plus 50 mg pirenzepine. Six patients with a basal acid output:peak acid output BAO:PAO greater than 0.3 were considered \"vagal hypertone\" subjects. Night gastric acidity inhibition was -39.6% with pirenzepine (p less than 0.001) and -73.7% and -71.5% with famotidine or ranitidine (p less than 0.001 vs. pirenzepine). The simultaneous administration of pirenzepine with famotidine or ranitidine provoked only a slight, insignificant increase in percent suppression, 5.1% and 6.3%, respectively, and did not modify either the time lag to onset of anti-H2 action or the duration of action. Patients with a BAO:PAO greater than 0.3 were not more sensitive to anticholinergic treatment than other duodenal ulcer patients. Our study furnishes evidence that combined administration of anti-H2 and anticholinergics is not significantly better than anti-H2 alone, in active duodenal ulcer patients.\r"

The occurrence of reflux, as assessed by the level of decrease in esophageal pH, correlated significantly with the change in LES pressure.

All patients had corresponding segmental abnormalities on video-esophagograms augmented with a solid bolus; in four patients, the solid bolus caused reproduction of symptoms during the esophagography.

Analysis of molecular size distribution of IgA anti-HBc by high performance liquid chromatography showed that the elevation of polymeric IgA anti-HBc was significantly greater than that of monomeric IgA anti-HBc in the acute exacerbation phase (p less than 0.05), although there was an increase in both monomeric and polymeric IgA anti-HBc. Thus, the elevation of polymeric IgA anti-HBc suggests that the focal immune response against HBcAg in the liver and secretory IgA anti-HBc is an important marker of acute exacerbation in patients with HBsAg-positive chronic liver disease.\r"

Repeat endoscopy revealed a recurrent fistula with an intramural mass in the mid-esophagus, oozing blood with adherent clot. These findings are the earliest endoscopic features of aortoesophageal fistula described, and this is the only case with subsequent reendoscopy, demonstrating previously reported findings in an advanced stage of fistula formation.

She became severely constipated and had left lower abdominal colic pain. Five days later, she had to be admitted to the hospital, because she had had no bowel movements for 12 days and the abdominal pain was severe. On the day after admission, she had frequent painful bowel movements. The stool was blood-tinged, but pathogenic bacteria were nil. Ischemic colitis of the stricture type was identified. She was treated with hyperalimentation and anticholinergic agents. At 3 months and 5 days after discharge from hospital, danazol 400 mg per day was readministered, and 11 days later, the patient again became constipated and complained of the same pain in the left flank. We consider that danazol-induced constipation played a role in the onset of the ischemic colitis.\r"

Persistent renal visualization 48 hours after the gallium injection, a positive scintigram, was graded as + (less than), ++ (equal to), and +++ (greater than) the hepatic uptake. Positive scintigrams were seen in ten of 16 cases of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, six of 11 cases of proliferative glomerulonephritis, and one case of minimal change, and one of two cases of membranous nephropathy; also in three of six cases of sickle glomerulopathy, two cases of diabetic neuropathy, one of two cases of amyloidosis, and one case of mild chronic allograft rejection. The 25 patients with positive scans were younger than the 20 with negative scans (31 +/- 12 v 42 +/- 17 years; P less than 0.01), and exhibited greater proteinuria (8.19 +/- 7.96 v 2.9 +/- 2.3 S/d; P less than 0.01) and lower serum creatinine values (2 +/- 2 v 4.1 +/- 2.8 mg/dL; P less than 0.01). The amount of proteinuria correlated directly with the intensity grade of the gallium image (P less than 0.02), but there was no correlation between the biopsy diagnosis and the outcome of the gallium scan. It was concluded that gallium scintigraphy is not useful in the differential diagnosis of the glomerular diseases under discussion. Younger patients with good renal function and heavy proteinuria are likely to have a positive renal scintigram regardless of the underlying glomerulopathy.\r"

A silicone dual-lumen catheter with a Dacron cuff placed in the internal jugular or subclavian vein was evaluated as a means of obtaining short-term vascular access. Sixty-two catheters in 54 patients provided a cumulative experience of 206 patient-months. Blood flow rates greater than or equal to 200 mL/min were achieved, with a mean recirculation of 2.1%. Catheter function was better with placement on the right side. Exit-site infections developed in nine patients, for a rate of 5.3 episodes per 100 patient-months; all resolved with antibiotics. Catheter-related bacteremia occurred in one patient, for a rate of 0.49 episodes per 100 patient-months, a rate much lower than rates reported for polyurethane and Teflon catheters. Clotting occurred in 24.5% of catheters, and thrombolytic therapy was always successful in restoring function. Because of the lower rate of complications, the silicone dual-lumen catheter with a Dacron cuff provides a safer alternative for short-term hemodialysis vascular access than the Teflon and polyurethane catheters.\r"
