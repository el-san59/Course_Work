When subjects with symptoms who had not had treatment were asked why they had not sought treatment, most responded that it was not a problem or they could live with the symptoms. Thus, most subjects with clinically detectable dysfunction are functioning adequately without significant symptoms and do not need treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Negative U waves on the surface electrocardiogram are reported to be a specific marker of myocardial disease. In the setting of ischemia, they correlate with stenosis of the left main and left anterior descending coronary arteries. To determine whether U wave changes are unique for anterior ischemia, the development of new U waves on the intracoronary electrogram was correlated with the location and magnitude of ischemia during coronary balloon angioplasty. Recordings were obtained during dilation of 43 vessels in 37 patients. New negative U waves developed during dilation of 12 vessels (7 of the left anterior descending, 4 of the left circumflex and 1 of the right coronary artery). New positive U waves developed during dilation of 18 vessels (12 of the left anterior descending, 3 of the left circumflex and 3 of the right coronary artery). The magnitude of ST segment change was 10.9 +/- 6.7 mm in the presence of a new U wave but only 3.4 +/- 2.8 mm in the absence of a new U wave (p less than 0.001). It is concluded that 1) negative U waves on the intracoronary electrogram are not specific for anterior ischemia; 2) new positive U waves on the intracoronary electrogram are as sensitive as new negative U waves for acute ischemia; 3) the development of a new positive or negative U wave is associated with the magnitude of myocardial ischemia; and 4) the recording of U waves may be related to the proximity of the recording leads to the location of ischemia.\r"

Of 471 patients with aortic stenosis identified by Doppler echocardiography (peak systolic flow velocity greater than or equal to 4 m/s) from January 1984 through August 1987, 143 were asymptomatic and had isolated valvular aortic stenosis. Thirty patients underwent aortic valve intervention within 3 months (group 1); the remaining 113 patients did not have an intervention within 3 months (group 2). Follow-up information was available for all patients; the mean duration of follow-up study was 20 months (range 6 to 48). Three cardiac events occurred in the 30 group 1 patients after operation (two deaths, one reoperation). Among the 113 group 2 patients, three had cardiac death presumed to be a result of the aortic stenosis; all three developed symptoms at least 3 months before death. The actuarial probability of remaining free of symptoms of angina, dyspnea or syncope for group 2 was 86% at 1 year and 62% at 2 years. For this group, the 1 and 2 year probabilities of remaining free of cardiac events, including aortic valve intervention or cardiac death, were 93% and 74%, respectively. Of all clinical and echocardiographic variables (group 2), only Doppler flow velocity (p = 0.004) and ejection fraction (p = 0.01) were independent predictors of subsequent cardiac events. Among the 44 patients (groups 1 and 2) with a flow velocity greater than or equal to 4.5 m/s, the relative risk of sustaining a cardiac event (by Cox regression analysis) was 4.9 (p = 0.004).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90187558\r", 
  ".W": "To assess the presence of viable myocardium salvaged by coronary artery reperfusion, 17 patients with acute anterior myocardial infarction were studied. Each received intravenous thrombolysis within the first 3 h of symptoms and underwent two-dimensional echocardiography before and during dobutamine infusion (10 micrograms/kg per min) 7 +/- 4 days after admission and positron emission tomography 9 +/- 5 days after admission. Echocardiography and positron emission tomography were again performed 9 +/- 7 months later. Six comparable segments specific for the territory of the left anterior descending artery were selected for comparison of the two techniques. Wall thickening was evaluated by using an echocardiographic score index. Segmental perfusion and glucose uptake were measured and normalized to the peak activity. A ratio of glucose uptake to perfusion was calculated for each segment. Concordant interpretation of the two techniques was found in 79% of affected segments for both acute and follow-up studies. Positron emission tomography revealed the presence of viable myocardium in 11 patients (group 1); perfusion was within normal limits in 5 of these (group 1A). Myocardial thickening improved with dobutamine infusion in these five patients, the echocardiographic score index decreasing from 12 +/- 2 at rest to 7.8 +/- 1.3 during dobutamine infusion (p = 0.003). Functional recovery was demonstrated in all five patients (follow-up score index 7.4 +/- 1.7). Six patients exhibited decreased perfusion but an abnormally high glucose to perfusion ratio (group 1B); their score index improved with dobutamine from 14.8 +/- 2.2 to 12 +/- 2.1 (p = 0.05), but late functional recovery was found in only one of the six patients (mean follow-up score index in group 1B 16 +/- 1.7). In the six remaining patients in whom no viable myocardium was detected with positron emission tomography (group 2), the echocardiographic score index did not change with dobutamine (15 +/- 0.9 to 14.7 +/- 0.8, p = NS) and there was no functional recovery (follow-up score index 15.5 +/- 1.0). Echocardiography during dobutamine infusion is a promising method to unmask viable myocardium in acute myocardial infarction. Early recovery of perfusion in the area at risk is associated with a good functional outcome, whereas a high glucose to perfusion ratio indicates jeopardized myocardium that frequently loses viability.\r"

  ".W": "Evaluation of regional myocardial blood flow by conventional scintigraphic techniques is limited to the qualitative assessment of regional tracer distribution. Dynamic imaging with positron emission tomography allows the quantitative delineation of myocardial tracer kinetics and, hence, the measurement of physiologic processes such as myocardial blood flow. To test this hypothesis, positron emission tomographic imaging in combination with N-13 ammonia was performed at rest and after pharmacologically induced vasodilation in seven healthy volunteers. Myocardial and blood time-activity curves derived from regions of interest over the heart and ventricular chamber were fitted using a three compartment model for N-13 ammonia, yielding rate constants for tracer uptake and retention. Myocardial blood flow (K1) averaged 88 +/- 17 ml/min per 100 g at rest and increased to 417 +/- 112 ml/min per 100 g after dipyridamole infusion (0.56 mg/kg) and handgrip exercise. The coronary reserve averaged 4.8 +/- 1.3 and was not significantly different in the septal, anterior and lateral walls of the left ventricle. Blood flow values showed only a minor dependence on the correction for blood metabolites of N-13 ammonia. These data demonstrate that quantification of regional myocardial blood flow is feasible by dynamic positron emission tomographic imaging. The observed coronary flow reserve after dipyridamole is in close agreement with the results obtained by invasive techniques, indicating accurate flow estimates over a wide range. Thus, positron emission tomography may provide accurate and noninvasive definition of the functional significance of coronary artery disease and may allow the improved selection of patients for revascularization.\r"

Quantitative measurements of stenosis severity distinguished patients with ischemic (group 1) from normal (group 2) exercise echocardiographic responses as follows: minimal luminal diameter (mm), group 1 1.0 +/- 0.4 versus group 2 1.7 +/- 0.4, p less than 0.0001; minimal cross-sectional area (mm2), group 1 0.9 +/- 0.6 versus group 2 2.5 +/- 1.1, p less than 0.0001; percent diameter stenosis, group 1 68.3 +/- 14.2 versus group 2 42.2 +/- 12.1, p less than 0.0001; and percent area stenosis, group 1 87.5 +/- 7.8 versus group 2 64.8 +/- 15.9, p less than 0.0001. These data validate the utility of exercise echocardiography by demonstrating that 1) coronary stenosis severity measured by quantitative angiography is closely related to wall motion abnormalities detected by exercise echocardiography, and 2) exercise echocardiography can be used as a noninvasive means to assess the physiologic significance of coronary artery lesions.\r"

  ".W": "The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of alterations in loading induced by lower body negative pressure on aortic blood flow velocity and acceleration. Twenty-seven normal men were studied during various levels of lower body negative pressure (0 to -60 mm Hg) during which echocardiographic, Doppler and hormonal measurements were obtained. Lower body negative pressure induced a decrease in left ventricular diastolic diameter from 5.18 +/- 0.08 to 4.41 +/- 0.1 cm (p less than 0.0001) and in left ventricular systolic diameter from 3.33 +/- 0.09 to 2.84 +/- 0.1 cm (p less than 0.0001). Shortening fraction remained unchanged. The decrease in diastolic diameter resulted in a reduction in flow velocity integral from 13.8 +/- 0.8 to 7.5 +/- 0.4 cm (p less than 0.0001) and, therefore, in stroke volume from 89.6 +/- 4.7 to 49.5 +/- 2.8 ml (p less than 0.0001). Heart rate reflexly increased from 62.5 +/- 1.9 to 82.2 +/- 2.3 beats/min (p less than 0.0001) as did systemic vascular resistance from 1,280.8 +/- 69.5 to 1,863.4 +/- 121.4 dyne.s.cm-5 (p less than 0.0001). The increase in heart rate was insufficient to maintain cardiac output, which decreased from 5.53 +/- 0.29 to 3.99 +/- 0.21 liters/min (p less than 0.0001). Systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure was maintained. The negative pressure resulted in a concomitant significant increase in norepinephrine levels from 1.46 +/- 0.09 to 2.056 +/- 0.2 nmol/liter (p = 0.0019) but no change in plasma epinephrine: 0.845 +/- 0.22 to 0.78 +/- 0.11 nmol/liter (p = NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

No patient had a history of documented or suspected sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation occurring greater than 48 h after infarction. During initial programmed ventricular stimulation, 21 patients had induction of sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation (Group I), and 35 patients had induction of either nonsustained ventricular tachycardia or no ventricular tachycardia (Group II). Repeat programmed ventricular stimulation in Group I patients induced sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation in 16 of 21 patients (reproducibility 76%); the maximal induced response in the other 5 patients was nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in 2 patients and fewer than six repetitive ventricular responses in 3 patients. The day to day reproducibility was significantly higher for inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia of cycle length greater than or equal to 240 ms compared with rapid sustained ventricular tachycardia of cycle length less than 240 ms (100% versus 44%, p less than 0.009) or ventricular fibrillation (100% versus 43%, p less than 0.009). Repeat programmed ventricular stimulation in Group II patients did not induce sustained ventricular arrhythmias in 31 of 35 patients (reproducibility 89%).

No patient had organic heart disease, and 31 had clinical atrial fibrillation before study. These 79 patients were then compared with a control group of 53 patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome in whom atrial fibrillation could not be induced. Ninety-five of the 103 episodes were technically suitable for analysis. Atrial fibrillation invariably began with rapid atrial tachycardia that became progressively disorganized within 10 to 20 cycles. It was initiated during right atrial stimulation (n = 52), right ventricular stimulation (n = 8), reciprocating tachycardia (n = 33) and spontaneously (n = 2). Most episodes started at a high right atrial site regardless of accessory pathway location, with only 19% of episodes starting at the electrode closest to the accessory pathway. During reciprocating tachycardia (n = 33), either atrial (n = 8) or ventricular (n = 5) extrastimuli initiated atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation started at the accessory pathway site in 6 of 20 episodes occurring spontaneously during reciprocating tachycardia. Patients with atrial fibrillation had a longer PA interval (54 +/- 14 versus 42 +/- 12 ms, p less than 0.0001), shorter atrial functional refractory period (226 +/- 38 versus 240 +/- 30 ms, p = 0.049) and shorter anterograde effective refractory period of the accessory pathway (279 +/- 26 versus 304 +/- 75 ms, p = 0.03).

Only five requests (0.27%) were denied because of an inappropriate indication for pacing. On a second review of these records, an additional eight pacemaker insertions (0.43%) were deemed to have been inappropriately approved. Comparison of the annualized number of pacemaker requests for the study period with those of the 3 years before mandatory approval revealed a reduction of only 3.7%. Thus, contrary to previous findings in other areas of the country, in Massachusetts, inappropriate pacemaker insertions are rare and the effect of the prior approval process is minimal.\r"

After a mean follow-up period of 12.5 +/- 8.7 months, a high incidence of hypertension was observed in 57 (67%) of the patients, and 42 (71%) of the 57 had developed new hypertension. None of the pretransplant and posttransplant cardiovascular risk factors were significantly associated with posttransplant hypertension. Faster deterioration of renal function, as assessed by intraindividual variations of serum creatinine values, was demonstrated in hypertensive patients and appeared as an early indicator of cyclosporine nephrotoxicity in patients at risk for hypertension. Serial echocardiographic evaluations demonstrated an early increase in left ventricular mass and fractional shortening in both hypertensive and normotensive heart transplant recipients. Fractional shortening further diminished significantly in normotensive patients but remained elevated in hypertensive patients, demonstrating sustained enhanced contractility in this group. Further studies will help to determine the exact relation between cyclosporine dosages and hypertension and their respective roles in the development of renal insufficiency and left ventricular hypertrophy after cardiac transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "Preliminary findings from clinical trials of percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty and intraoperative debridement of calcific deposits in patients with aortic stenosis have suggested that calcified, congenitally bicuspid aortic valves may be less amenable to these techniques than are calcified tricuspid aortic valves. Accordingly, we evaluated the histoarchitecture of calcific deposits in 30 operatively excised aortic valves. Light microscopic sections taken through the calcified aortic valve leaflets disclosed two principal types of histoarchitecture. In 11 aortic valves nodular calcific deposits were superimposed on an underlying fibrotic aortic valve leaflet (type A); in 17 valves calcific deposits were diffusely distributed throughout the body (spongiosa) of the aortic valve leaflets (type B). Two aortic valves could not be classified histologically. These histologic subtypes were not randomly distributed with regard to gross valvular morphology. All 14 bicuspid valves (100%) were type B; in contrast, 11 (69%) of 16 tricuspid aortic valves were type A, and only 3 (19%) of 16 tricuspid valves were type B (p less than 0.01). Both valves with nonclassifiable histologic features were tricuspid on the basis of gross examination. Thus, the histoarchitectural distribution of calcific deposits is different for bicuspid than for tricuspid stenotic aortic valves. The more diffuse distribution of calcium throughout the body of calcified bicuspid aortic valve leaflets may render these valves less amenable to operative and percutaneous valvuloplasty than are calcified tricuspid aortic valve leaflets on which calcific deposits are typically superimposed in nodular form.\r"

Arteries were dilated in patients with tetralogy of Fallot (n = 49), tetralogy of Fallot/pulmonary atresia (n = 64), isolated peripheral pulmonary artery stenoses (n = 58) and \"other\" lesions (the majority had truncus arteriosus or single ventricle and surgically induced pulmonary artery stenoses (n = 47). Mean age at dilation was 6.6 +/- 6.3 years (range 1 month to 38.5 years). The mean diameter of the lesion increased from 3.8 +/- 1.7 to 5.5 +/- 2.1 mm with dilation (p = 0.001). The overall success rate was 58% (127 of 218 dilations), assessed by the following criteria: an increase greater than or equal to 50% of predilation diameter, an increase greater than 20% in flow to the affected lung or a decrease greater than 20% in systolic right ventricular to aortic pressure ratio. Success did not correlate with patient age. Mean balloon to artery ratio was higher in successful (4.2) than in failed (3.0) angioplasty procedures (p = 0.0001). There were four early deaths: two of the patients had pulmonary artery rupture with angioplasty performed less than 1 month after pulmonary artery surgery. An aneurysm occurred in 11 arteries and transient pulmonary edema in four patients. At angiography performed a mean of 10 months (range 1 to 54) after dilation, the mean diameter of 57 arteries was unchanged (5.5 versus 5.4 mm). However, 5 of 32 initially successfully dilated vessels had returned to predilation size as a result of restenosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The adaptation of the vasculature to positive inotropic intervention was examined in 10 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy to test the hypothesis that increased myocardial contractility is matched by complementary changes in aortic impedance that optimize ventricular-vascular coupling and maximize power transfer to the circulation. High fidelity intravascular recordings of aortic pressure and flow were obtained at baseline study and during infusion of dobutamine to derive the aortic input impedance spectrum. In eight patients in whom increased staged infusion of dobutamine resulted in a significant increase in stroke volume (22.3 +/- 14.5 ml/beat increase over baseline), the significant (p less than 0.05) increase in the maximum of the first derivative left ventricular pressure pulse (dP/dt) was accompanied by significant decreases in characteristic impedance of the aorta (138 +/- 88 to 92 +/- 44 dyne.s.cm-5) wave reflection index (238 +/- 144 to 109 +/- 59 dyne.s.cm-5), and low frequency moduli of impedance. Effective positive inotropic therapy with dobutamine in the setting of congestive heart failure is accompanied by complementary changes in the aortic impedance spectrum, which represent a matching of impedance to the increased contractile state of the ventricle and facilitation of ventricular-vascular coupling.\r"

The most frequently involved vessel was the left anterior descending coronary artery. In 11 patients (58%), attempted atherectomy preceded coronary angioplasty. In 6 of the 11, angioplasty was used after the atherectomy catheter could not be positioned across the lesion; 4 patients underwent \"rescue\" angioplasty after developing vessel occlusion related to atherectomy and 1 patient had an unsatisfactory result of atherectomy. The success rate of the combined intervention was 82% for these 11 patients. In eight patients (42%), atherectomy was performed after initial angioplasty. In four of the eight, atherectomy was a rescue procedure to manage vessel occlusion by thrombus or intimal dissection and was successful in three. In the other four, angioplasty was performed to establish an easier passage for the atherectomy catheter and was successful in three. Thus, the success rate of the combined intervention was 75% for these eight patients. The overall success rate for all 19 patients was 79%; there was one in-hospital death and one non-Q wave infarction, and one patient required immediate coronary artery surgery. Two other patients underwent coronary artery surgery before hospital discharge. Combined intervention with coronary angioplasty and atherectomy seems to be a relatively safe and effective approach in selected patients when either of these procedures alone is unsuccessful or is accompanied by acute coronary complications.\r"

Decreases in systolic blood pressure to less than or equal to 70 mm Hg occurred in 11 patients (39%), but augmented diastolic pressure was greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg at all times. No deaths or myocardial infarctions occurred within 72 h of coronary angioplasty. Vascular complications requiring surgical repair occurred in three patients who had good operative results and no need for transfusions. Thus, intraaortic balloon pump support in patients with high risk features undergoing elective coronary angioplasty appears effective and relatively benign, although definite benefit cannot be proved without a randomized study. Newer techniques, such as in-laboratory cardiopulmonary bypass, must be compared with the results obtained with intraaortic balloon pump support alone.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis that abnormally increased myocardial oxygen demands may contribute to increased vulnerability to ischemia during exercise in the chronically pressure-overloaded hypertrophied left ventricle was tested. Myocardial oxygen consumption was measured during a five stage graded treadmill exercise protocol in eight normal dogs and nine adult dogs in which a 90% increase in left ventricular mass was produced by banding the ascending aorta at 8 weeks of age. Heart rate increased progressively during exercise in both groups of dogs, but was significantly faster than normal in the group with aortic banding. Coronary blood flow increased progressively with exercise in both groups, but was significantly greater than normal in dogs with aortic banding during each exercise stage. Coronary sinus oxygen tension decreased significantly and similarly during exercise in normal and hypertrophied hearts. In dogs with hypertrophy, oxygen consumption per gram of myocardium averaged 52% greater than normal during exercise. This excess myocardial oxygen consumption in dogs with aortic banding resulted from an abnormally large increase in oxygen consumption per beat during exercise and from the faster heart rate in this group of dogs. Measurements of myocardial blood flow with microspheres demonstrated a lower subendocardial/subepicardial blood flow ratio in dogs with hypertrophy; this ratio decreased significantly during exercise in dogs with hypertrophy, but not in normal dogs. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that increased vulnerability to ischemia in the pressure-overloaded hypertrophied left ventricle is the result of both increased myocardial oxygen demands during exercise and abnormalities of myocardial perfusion.\r"

However, the nature and extent to which diastolic filling is altered have not been well described. Acute severe left ventricular dysfunction was induced in 21 dogs by severe left ventricular global ischemia produced by left main coronary artery microsphere embolization until left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was greater than or equal to 18 mm Hg. Dobutamine was infused in seven dogs until the peak positive first derivative of left ventricular pressure (dP/dt) increased by greater than or equal to 33%. Nitroprusside was infused in seven dogs until left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was less than 15 mm Hg. Seven dogs were observed for 1 h after the induction of acute severe left ventricular dysfunction and served as the control group. In all groups of dogs, severe left ventricular dysfunction resulted in left ventricular dilation, reduction in area ejection fraction, elevation of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and an early redistribution of diastolic filling (increased 1/3 and 1/2 filling fractions) despite a markedly abnormal time constant of relaxation. No changes were noted in any variable after 1 h of observation in the seven control dogs. Nitroprusside reduced left ventricular size and filling pressure, increased cardiac output, improved relaxation and redistributed diastolic filling to later in diastole as characterized by a reduced 1/3 filling fraction (19.4 +/- 7.4% versus 51.4 +/- 10%, p less than 0.001). The pressure-area curve was shifted downward and leftward.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Fluid dynamics suggests that orifice geometry is a determinant of discharge properties and, therefore, should influence empiric constants in formulas (such as the Gorlin formula) to calculate stenotic valve area. An in vitro study utilizing a model of transmitral flow was conducted to investigate how the discharge coefficient changes with 1) orifice eccentricity (ratio of long to short diameter), 2) absolute area, 3) the presence of a nozzle-like inlet, and 4) varying flow. Twenty-three orifices with areas varying between 0.3 and 2.5 cm2 and eccentricities from 1:1, or circular, to 5:1, or elliptic, were tested. The calculated discharge coefficients ranged between 0.675 and 0.93. For a given area, the discharge coefficient decreased by a mean value (+/- SD) of 5.5 +/- 1.3% between circular orifices and 5:1 ellipses. Discharge coefficients increased by a mean of 8.9 +/- 3.5% from 0.3 to 2.5 cm2 area within each eccentricity class. A gradually tapering inlet (nozzle) raised the discharge coefficient by 8.8 +/- 3.9%, leading to a discharge coefficient between 0.81 and 0.93 for round orifices. The discharge coefficient did not change appreciably with flow. The concept of the discharge coefficient and its role in assessing restrictive orifices in general by hydraulic formulas (for example, the Gorlin and pressure half-time calculations) are discussed.\r"

Preliminary to a trial of such a treatment strategy, paramedics evaluated the characteristics of 2,472 patients with chest pain of presumed cardiac origin; 677 (27%) had suitable clinical findings consistent with possible acute myocardial infarction and no apparent risk of complication for potential thrombolytic drug treatment. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) of 522 of the 677 patients were transmitted by cellular telephone to a base station physician; 107 (21%) of the tracings showed evidence of ST segment elevation. Of the total 2,472 patients, 453 developed evidence of acute myocardial infarction in the hospital; 163 (36%) of the 453 had met the strict prehospital screening history and examination criteria and 105 (23.9%) showed ST elevation on the ECG and, thus, would have been suitable candidates for prehospital thrombolytic treatment if it had been available. The average time from the onset of chest pain to prehospital diagnosis was 72 +/- 52 min (median 52); this was 73 +/- 44 min (median 62) earlier than the time when thrombolytic treatment was later started in the hospital. Paramedic selection of appropriate patients for potential prehospital initiation of thrombolytic treatment is feasible with use of a directed checklist and cellular-transmitted ECG and saves time. This strategy may reduce the extent and complications of infarction compared with results that can be achieved in a hospital setting.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-nine consecutive patients with symptomatic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and a mean age of 44.8 +/- 12.2 years (range 21 to 63) underwent complex invasive and noninvasive testing to identify a risk profile for syncope. Clinical, morphologic, electrophysiologic and hemodynamic variables at rest and at a symptom-limited pacing rate were analyzed for a significant association with syncope. Exact stepwise logistic regression analysis identified three variables as significant independent predictors of syncope in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: 1) age less than 30 years (beta = 4.803; p = 0.0007); 2) left ventricular end-diastolic volume index less than 60 ml/m2 (beta = 3.302; p = 0.006); and 3) nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on 72 h ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring (beta = 2.5909; p = 0.03). The combined occurrence of all three variables had a sensitivity and specificity of 100% in identifying eight patients with syncopal events. Thus, the risk for syncope in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is high in young patients with the combination of low left ventricular filling volume and episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. This finding might also explain the mechanism of syncope in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as low input-low output failure induced by a sudden increase in heart rate in the presence of a low filling volume.\r"

To evaluate the high gain signal-averaged electrocardiogram (ECG) in this setting, 64 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and 50 age- and gender-matched control subjects were studied. An abnormal signal-averaged ECG was more common in patients than in control subjects: 13 (20%) of 64 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy had abnormalities compared with 2 (4%) of the 50 control subjects (p less than 0.001). There was a significant association between the presence of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on 48 h ECG Holter monitoring and the presence of an abnormal signal-averaged ECG: 8 (47%) of the 17 patients with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and 6 (86%) of 7 patients with more than three episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia per 24 h had signal-averaged ECG abnormalities. There was no association between an abnormal signal-averaged ECG and a family history of premature sudden cardiac death, a history of syncope, symptomatic status, maximal left ventricular wall thickness, the presence of systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve or maximal rate of oxygen uptake on exercise. However, of four patients with a history of cardiac arrest, three had an abnormal signal-averaged ECG. Sensitivity was 50%; specificity was 93% and positive predictive accuracy was 77% for the signal-averaged ECG in detecting patients with electrical instability (defined as a history of cardiac arrest or the presence of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, or both).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Outcome was assessed on the basis of exercise testing, integrating the measurements into a single outcome measure consisting of three categories (positive, n = 79; negative, n = 42; no change, n = 35). This composite criterion served as the end point for determining the predictability of a positive (training success) and negative (training failure) outcome. With use of logistic regression analysis, the baseline variables of clinical information, exercise data and psychosocial variables were able to identify patients with training success, as well as patients with failure (correct classification rates 81% and 85%, respectively). The characteristics of patients for whom training was beneficial differed from those of patients with a negative outcome. Work status before infarction was the single most important predictor of success, but it did not determine failure. Psychologic variables (type A behavior, well-being, depression) were important for predicting failure, but not for predicting success. Cardiac state and physical fitness largely determined training success. It is concluded that the physical benefit of exercise training in patients after myocardial infarction is highly predictable. Validation will make it possible to optimally apply exercise training as a therapeutic modality in these patients.\r"

During all phases of exercise in patients with heart failure, pulmonary wedge pressure and systemic vascular resistance were higher and pulmonary vascular resistance remained markedly elevated compared with values in control subjects. Cardiac output was lower in the patients with failure, but appeared to have the same physiologic distribution in both groups during exercise. Although arterial-femoral venous oxygen content difference was higher in patients with heart failure, this increase did not compensate for the reduced blood flow. Even though the maximal oxygen consumption was significantly reduced, femoral venous lactate and pH values were higher than values in control subjects, but femoral venous pH was similar in both groups at their respective levels of maximal exercise. Ejection fraction was lower in those with heart failure at rest and did not increase with exercise.

In 84 patients (60%), ischemia during radionuclide angiography was silent (silent ischemia group), whereas 56 patients experienced angina during the test (symptomatic group). Work load and antianginal medication were similar in both groups. Critical cardiac events (unstable angina, myocardial infarction, cardiac death) occurred in 27% of patients in the silent ischemia group and 16% of those in the symptomatic group (p = NS); however, myocardial infarction or death was more frequent in patients with silent ischemia (22% versus 9%; p less than 0.05). If there was additional exercise-induced ST segment depression, the rate of critical events was further increased (p less than 0.05). The difference in critical cardiac events seemed to be influenced by the higher incidence of revascularization procedures in symptomatic patients, whereas medical therapy had no similar effect. Thus, these findings suggest that patients with documented severe ischemia should undergo left heart catheterization and revascularization irrespective of symptoms to improve their prognosis.\r"

Hay fever was common in all groups with severe asthma, increasing from 25% of the control group to 67% of the group with the most severe asthma, class V. Eczema was uncommon at this age in all groups. IgE levels, peripheral blood eosinophil counts, and skin reactions were significantly (p less than 0.05) higher in class V than in the control group. Increasing age was associated with a progressive fall in eosinophil counts and an increase in skin reactivity to common allergens. No change in IgE levels was observed from 21 to 28 years. A general relationship between bronchial hyperreactivity and atopic markers was found. However, only the occurrence of hay fever was significantly related to reactivity when account was taken of severity of asthma. The results indicate that the relationship between asthma and atopy observed at earlier reviews continues into adult life and that bronchial hyperreactivity and atopy are not directly linked.\r"

  ".W": "Based on membrane receptors, metabolic activity, and cell density, human eosinophils (EOSs) are a heterogeneous population of leukocytes. EOS heterogeneity translates into biologic significance, since low density cells can be metabolically more active and thus more capable of causing tissue injury. Efforts to identify mechanisms that lead to the development of hypodense EOSs have found that an in vitro exposure to cytokines reduces cell density and is associated with increased cell activity. Consequently, we evaluated the effect of an in vivo administration of interleukin-2 (IL-2) on the cell counts and density of circulating EOSs in six patients who received IL-2 as cancer biologic-modifier therapy. To determine the pattern of EOS density in relationship to IL-2 treatment, granulocyte suspensions were isolated from peripheral blood and then centrifuged over multiple discontinuous density Percoll gradients. During IL-2 treatment, the percentage of circulating hypodense EOSs increased significantly (p less than 0.01) until nearly all (97.6 +/- 1.6%) EOSs were hypodense (density less than 1.095 gm/ml). Similarly, the absolute blood EOS counts significantly increased throughout treatment. On completion of IL-2 therapy, the EOS counts and density distribution returned to pretreatment values. In contrast, no increase in blood EOS counts was observed in similar patients receiving interferon (gamma or beta) therapy. Our observations support a hypothesis that IL-2, either directly or, more likely, through the generation of other factors, participates in a change in EOS density that may, in turn, establish a subpopulation of cells with altered metabolic activity.\r"

The predominant IgG subclass produced was IgG1, representing nearly 80% of all IgG anti-ATG activity present. The appearance of IgG anti-ATG antibodies and C1q-containing immune complexes was closely correlated with symptoms of SSX. Although other antibody isotypes were present and may have contributed to the patients' symptoms, it is evident that IgG1 is the predominant IgG subclass produced in human SSX caused by a heterologous protein.\r"

The patients were young, atopic, and immunocompetent. All three patients demonstrated pansinusitis with nasal polyps and underwent multiple surgical procedures. Pathologic features included a characteristic mucoid exudate containing eosinophils, Charcot-Leyden crystals, and fungal hyphae. In two cases there was bony erosion revealed by computed tomography scan but no histologic evidence of direct fungal invasion into the mucosa or bony trabeculae. Immunologic features, including total eosinophil count, total serum IgE, immediate and late-phase skin response to B. spicifera, serum precipitins, and specific IgE and IgG to B. spicifera, are described. B. spicifera is a previously unrecognized cause of allergic fungal sinusitis that may be an underdiagnosed disorder. This diagnosis should be considered in atopic patients with nasal polyps and pansinusitis unresponsive to conventional medical therapy. Diagnostic criteria include characteristic histologic allergic mucin, culture identification of fungus, positive immediate cutaneous reactivity to fungal extract, positive serum precipitins, and elevated specific IgE and IgG antibodies.\r"

Of the 81 workers, 84% completed a questionnaire to assess work-related respiratory symptoms, 79% underwent skin prick testing to latex and six other workplace chemicals, and 62% performed workshift spirometry. Seven workers had spirometric changes consistent with asthma, of whom five had greater than or equal to 15% fall in FEV1 during the workshift. Six of these workers underwent methacholine-challenge testing, and three were found to have a significant improvement in responsiveness to methacholine away from work, suggestive of occupational asthma. Two of these workers had positive skin test responses to latex. Including the index case, 6% of workers who had pulmonary function testing had findings of latex-related occupational asthma. Skin test responses to latex occurred in 11% of workers tested. Our findings suggest that latex should be considered among the causes of occupational asthma.\r"

Sera from three patients, occupationally exposed to a reactive dye, Remazol black B (Chemical Abstract registry number 17095-24-8), were used. Directly dyed disks, that is, disks without any carrier protein, resulted in poor and unreliable measures of specific IgE. In contrast, optimized preparation of conjugates between the dye and human serum albumin resulted in efficient binding of specific IgE. The patients' RAST results were strongly positive, whereas sera from 36 exposed workers but without symptoms and sera from unexposed subjects with high levels of total IgE were negative. The hapten and carrier specificity of the IgE antibodies was studied by direct RAST and RAST inhibition. In one patient, the antibodies were principally hapten specific, whereas another patient was found to have antibodies with a high degree of specificity to the carrier. The third patient's antibodies were intermediate between the other two patients' antibodies in this respect, suggesting that antibody specificity is dependent not only on the nature of the hapten but also on individual immune response factors. The study demonstrates that it is important to use an optimized preparation of dye-protein conjugates to elicit reliable results and a high degree of specific IgE binding in the RAST.\r"

  ".W": "Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a potent inflammatory mediator that can cause bronchoconstriction and airway hyperresponsiveness in selected human subjects and animals. The mechanism by which PAF induces these changes is not clearly understood. We therefore studied the effects of intratracheal instillation of PAF (30 micrograms/kg) on airway resistance and airway responsiveness in allergic sheep (n = 7) and attempted to modulate these effects with the specific PAF antagonist, WEB-2086, and the antiasthmatic agent, nedocromil sodium (NED). Specific lung resistance (SRL) was measured to assess bronchial responses to PAF, and airway responsiveness was determined by deriving a provocative dose of carbachol in breath units causing an increase in SRL to 4 L times centimeters of H2O per liters per second (PD4) from carbachol dose-response curves. PAF instillation increased mean +/- SD SRL to 228 +/- 134% above baseline. Two to 4 hours after PAF instillation, PD4 decreased by 55 +/- 9% from a baseline of 39 +/- 9 breath units (p less than 0.05). Airway responsiveness remained increased at 24 hours but returned to baseline by 48 hours. Pretreatment with WEB-2086 (3 mg/kg, intravenously) or NED (1 mg/kg, nebulized) blocked (p less than 0.05) PAF-induced bronchoconstriction and PAF-induced airway hyperresponsiveness. Instillation of lyso-PAF (30 micrograms/kg) did not cause bronchoconstriction or airway hyperresponsiveness. Thus, instilled PAF causes bronchoconstriction and airway hyperresponsiveness in allergic sheep by a receptor-mediated mechanism that likely involves the release of secondary mediators, the latter process being sensitive to NED.\r"

Hospital records were then examined to determine outcomes: death in the emergency room, death during consequent hospitalization, or live discharge. Complete information was obtained for all 117 nursing-home residents and for 580 of 588 nonresidents. When attempted resuscitation was begun in a nursing home, only two patients survived to hospital discharge, whereas 61 nonresidents (11%) survived after a mean stay of 14 days. Of the 115 nursing-home residents who did not survive to hospital discharge, 102 (89%) were pronounced dead in the emergency room, two (2%) more died within 24 hours of admission, and the remaining 11 (9%) died after an average stay of five days. Of the 519 nonresidents who died before discharge, 433 (83%) were pronounced dead in the emergency room, 16 (3%) died in the first 24 hours, and 70 (14%) lived an average of nine days. One of the two nursing-home residents who survived was an 87-year-old woman who spent 30 days in the hospital and died eight months after returning to the nursing home, demented, cachectic, with a large sacral pressure sore.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A significantly higher prevalence of frequent ventricular ectopic beats (VEB greater than 100 per recording) was found in hypertensive and normotensive groups age greater than or equal to 70 years compared to age 60-69 years (44% vs 15%, P less than .01, and 28% vs 9%, P less than 01, respectively). Complex ventricular ectopy was found to be significantly increased only in the hypertensive group greater than or equal to 70 years compared to 60-69 years (53% vs 28%, P less than .05). No significant difference for any type of ventricular ectopy was found between treated and untreated hypertensive subjects. Analysis of variance of frequent ventricular ectopy showed a significant effect of age (P less than .001) but not of hypertension. Multivariate regression analysis with frequent ventricular ectopy as the dependent variable confirmed this relationship. For complex ventricular ectopy, analysis of variance showed a significant effect of hypertension (P less than .001) and age (P less than .05). Multivariate regression analysis confirmed that complex ventricular ectopy was significantly associated with hypertension (P less than .01) and age (P less than .05). In elderly subjects aging alone is associated with increased frequency of ventricular ectopy, whereas complex ventricular ectopy is more significantly related to the hypertensive process than to age.\r"

To address this, both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of alcohol use in 270 healthy elderly persons over a seven-year period (1980-1987) were performed. Alcohol consumption was assessed by three-day diet records. One hundred sixty-five subjects (61.1%) remained in the study until 1987; 143 (53%) completed diet records for every year. Longitudinal analysis showed a statistically significant decline in the percent of subjects consuming any alcohol over time (slope = -2% per year; 95% confidence interval -2.8, -1.1%). A cross-sectional analysis of the 1980 data revealed a similar decline in percent drinkers with increasing age (slope = -2.7% per year; 95% confidence interval -4.4, -1.1%). Mean alcohol intake for those who continued to drink did not change over time except among heavy drinkers (consumption of greater than 30 g per day in 1980), who did show a significant decline in mean alcohol intake (P = .02). Thus, in our population the decline in percent of drinkers with age found by a cross-sectional analysis was confirmed in longitudinal analyses, suggesting that this represents a true age-related decline rather than a cohort effect.\r"

Nineteen patients established firm to hard erections lasting an average of 16 minutes and were able to have satisfactory coitus with vaginal ejaculation an average of three times per month. The penile-brachial pressure index, supine and after exercise (a measure of the adequacy of penile arterial flow), exhibited a significant increase following six month's use of the vacuum tumescence device. The only significant complications were mild, self-limited hematomas on three occasions of use. Thus in this limited series the vacuum tumescence device provided a well-accepted, relatively inexpensive therapeutic approach to impotence.\r"

Existing instruments designed to quantify behavior disturbance among patients with dementia tend to be quite heterogeneous, including many items that do not refer to behavioral disturbance as such, but rather to cognitive, psychological, or somatic symptoms, or functional impairments. A 28-item Dementia Behavior Disturbance (DBD) scale was developed to avoid some of the problems encountered with the older instruments. In two samples of patients with dementia (n = 50 and n = 46), the most common symptoms were repetitive questions, losing or hiding things, lack of interest in daily activities, nocturnal wakefulness, unwarranted accusations, excessive daytime sleeping, and pacing. The coefficient of internal consistency was greater than .80 in both samples, and the correlation between scores obtained from the same subjects at a two-week interval was moderately high (Pearson's correlation coefficient = .71). There was a relatively high correlation between DBD scores and scores on Greene's Behavior and Mood Disturbance scale, and higher DBD scores were associated with increased duration and severity of disease. These preliminary results indicate that the DBD may be a useful and valid measure of one dimension of the dementia syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "The majority of research on \"caregiver burden\" focuses on mental health consequences. These stresses are associated with psychotropic drug use among some caregivers. The purposes of this paper are to identify the correlates of psychotropic drug use among caregivers of demented older adults and to determine whether or not certain types of psychotropics (ie, antianxiety, antidepressant, and sedative/hypnotic agents) have common or unique correlates. The prevalence of psychotropic drug use among caregivers in the sample (n = 510) is substantially higher than previously reported prevalence rates in the general population and among community-dwelling elderly. Using logistic regression techniques, caregiver characteristics (eg, gender, health, relationship to the patient) rather than severity of the patient's condition emerge as predictors of antianxiety, antidepressant, and sedative/hypnotic use. The caregiver's perception of how well he or she is supported in the caregiving role emerges as an important correlate of psychotropic drug use in general and especially of antidepressant consumption. Results suggest that caregivers are a high-risk group for the development of emotional symptoms such as nervousness, exhaustion, decreased appetite, and difficulty sleeping, symptoms that may or may not constitute a psychiatric disorder. Characteristics of the caregiver, especially aspects of the support system, should be important considerations in decisions to prescribe psychotropic drugs.\r"

At 22 degrees C, the amount of radioactivity associated with platelets from older subjects increased continuously for more than 2 hours. The same amount of radioactivity was displaced by addition of unlabeled AII at 30 min and 60 min. In the presence of phenylarsine oxide, in the cold, or when labeled antagonist was the ligand, binding came to equilibrium by 30 min. High pressure liquid chromatography demonstrated that 125I-AII was the major radioactive compound in the supernatant and platelets after incubation, but the platelets also contained radiolabeled AII fragments. Thus, some degradation accompanied interaction of AII and platelets. Phenylarsine oxide did not prevent degradation of bound AII, suggesting that degradation precedes internalization. On average, maximum binding was greater in older subjects whether platelets were incubated with 125I-AII alone, with 125I-AII and phenylarsine oxide to prevent internalization, or when the competitive inhibitor 125I-sar1,ile8-AII was the radioligand. Variability of binding among subjects also increased with age. Thus, platelets bind, degrade, and internalize AII, and the three processes occur to a greater extent in platelets from some, but not all older subjects.\r"

The median length of life of ad libitum CV and GF rats was 31.0 and 33.6 months respectively, while DR increased the median length of life of CV and GF rats to 38.6 and 37.8 months respectively. DR reduced the frequency or postponed the occurrence of diseases which eventually lead to death in the Lobund-Wistar rat. This was especially true of prostate adenocarcinoma, prostatitis, and mammary fibroma. The reduced early food intake and smaller body weight of adult GF rats may be the reason ad libitum fed GF rats live slightly longer than their CV counterparts, but GF life was without additional effect on life span when food intake was restricted.\r"

The change in each variable over time, i.e., the beta coefficient of linear regression, was calculated for each animal, and a matrix of correlations among the variables was constructed. Eight variables correlated well with the first principal component of the matrix. These variables (rate of fingernail growth, blood lymphocytes, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, immunoglobulin A, and serum sodium, chloride, total protein, and creatinine) represented the best subset of the potential biomarkers analyzed to produce an index covering a range of morphologic and functional systems that change with age. A similar set representing a wider range of systems and measured over a larger fraction of the life span should provide a valid index of an individual's rate of biological aging.\r"

However, the effects of age and existing disease on this association have not been adequately addressed. We studied the association between cell-mediated immunity and subsequent morbidity and mortality in 273 initially healthy persons 60 years of age and older. In 1979, two tests of cell-mediated immunity were conducted--mitogen stimulation with phytohaemagglutinin, and delayed hypersensitivity skin testing. The study group was followed annually for development of pneumonia, cancer, and death. Anergy was associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio of 2.16; 95% confidence interval [1.10,4.28]). When the results were adjusted for age, the resulting hazard ratio was 1.89;[0.94,3.79]. A relationship was also suggested between anergy and cancer mortality although this association was not statistically significant. Response to phytohaemagglutinin was a poorer predictor of mortality than was response to delayed hypersensitivity skin testing. The results show that anergy may be a good indicator of subsequent all-cause mortality, and perhaps cancer mortality, in elderly who lack other indicators of poor health.\r"

When standing on one leg with eyes open, the correlation coefficients for radial area per second with the mobility indices ranged from -0.59 to -0.64 (p less than .001). Knee range of motion and stride length correlated with performance on the mobility index. Knee range of motion correlation coefficients ranged from 0.47 to 0.54 (p less than .001), whereas the range was 0.62 to 0.68 (p less than .001) for stride length. These data demonstrate that biomechanics platform measures of sway and videotaped measures of gait are associated with subject performance on a clinical mobility index and may themselves also be predictive of persons susceptible to falling.\r"

Alzheimer's disease is a major public health problem, yet little is known about the potential oral consequences of the disease. Because saliva is believed to be essential for the preservation of oral health and function, salivary gland fluid output was evaluated in a population of essentially healthy patients with early-stage DAT. Unstimulated and stimulated parotid and submandibular salivary gland secretions were collected from 28 nonmedicated and otherwise healthy DAT patients, and 35 age-matched healthy controls. Submandibular saliva flow rates were significantly lower among the patients with DAT compared to controls, while parotid flow rates did not differ. The results suggest a selective impairment in submandibular gland function in essentially healthy patients with early-stage DAT.\r"

Based on these self-reports, the prevalence of urinary incontinence was 18.9% in men and 37.7% in women. One-year incidence rates of about 20% among women and about 10% among men were found. One-year remission rates were about 12% for women and about 30% for men. When becoming incontinent, respondents were most likely to develop mild incontinence. Those who changed their severity level were most likely to progress from mild to moderate.\r"

The purpose of this study was to obtain a normative data base for the speech production characteristics of a group of very old men. Fourteen veterans 87 to 93 years old served as subjects, producing a total of 40 sentences at a conversational rate. Wide-band (300 Hz) spectrograms were created from high-quality tape recordings. Specified acoustic measures were made (consonant, vowel, and voice-onset time durations; and vowel formant frequencies and trajectory slopes) via digitizer and microcomputer Sonogram Analyzer program. Descriptive analysis of the selected measurements was performed to obtain a profile of speech production behavior for these subjects. Data were also compared to those of the young adult, Parkinson's disease patients, and younger elderly subjects studied by Weismer (1984a) and Weismer, Kimelman, and Gorman (1985). Performance of the older subjects was similar to that of the younger elderly in many cases, but in certain cases bore notable similarities to Parkinsonian speech. Theoretical implications of aging and disease are addressed.\r"

The other tradition regards control as a personality or trait variable and has been concerned with the development and validation of scales to measure it. Linking these two traditions would help determine if people differentially react to control-enhancing manipulations because of control predispositions. This study reports on an investigation into this topic. A sample of 209 subjects responded to the Levenson I-E scale and a control-enhancing manipulation (vs placebo contact and no contact control samples) within the context of a longitudinal assessment of stress and mental health in older adults. Variables assessed included personal mastery and mental health. The results showed significant interactions of the trait and manipulated variables. Control enhancement was most effective for those high in control beliefs. Some positive benefits of the placebo contact also were found. Subjects low in control beliefs did not respond strongly to control manipulations, while those high in control did. Directions for additional research are discussed.\r"

The cue/target relationship was one of three types: categorically related (high integration condition), visually interacting (high integration condition), or unrelated and noninteracting (low integration condition). Cued recall of the targets was tested. The results indicated that the poorly integrated target-context relationship produced the largest age difference, supporting the integration hypothesis.\r"

However, little is known about the \"typical\" rate of decline, the degree of individual heterogeneity evident in decline, or the types of factors that influence such decline. This study investigated these questions in a sample of 106 patients with Alzheimer's disease, assessed at 1-5 points in time, spanning up to three years. At each time point, the Mini-Mental State Exam, a measure of global cognitive function, was administered to all patients. Measures of behavioral disturbance (including the presence/absence of hallucinations, depression, incontinence, wandering, and agitation), health status (including presence/absence of neurological, cardiovascular, and other diseases), and descriptive information (such as gender, age at time of onset, and duration of deficits) were obtained at entry into the study. A two-stage random effects regression model was fit to the data and then used to assess the effect of these behavioral, health, and descriptive measures on the rate of decline. Results indicate that the rate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease is quite variable. Patients with various health and behavioral problems declined at a rate between 1.4 and 5 times faster than patients without such problems. Alcohol abuse, additional neurological disease, and agitation were significantly related to rate of decline. Overall number of problems was not. The association of these problems with accelerated decline may have prognostic and treatment implications.\r"

No age differences were found during intake for the number of physical coping strategies. Elderly patients named fewer cognitive strategies. No age differences were detected in the percentage of patients offered treatment, who agreed to enter treatment, or who completed treatment. Although older patients more frequently had abnormal physical findings, there were no significant differences on measures of self-reported activity, pain severity, life interference, emotional or worry reactions in response to pain. Both age groups had comparable scores on measures of social support and perceptions of how others react to their pain. The present research suggests that there are relatively few factors distinguishing pain patients based on age. Moreover, age should not be a significant factor to consider when offering patients multidisciplinary treatment for chronic pain that focuses on psychological as well as physical modalities.\r"

Maximum likelihood factor analysis revealed a two-factor structure, consisting of memory-attention and verbal-comprehension factors that were highly correlated (.69). The results suggest that the somewhat longer MMSE may be preferred for bedside mental status testing, as it clearly measures an additional dimension of cognitive ability, while the BOMC is primarily a unidimensional test. The theoretical and clinical implications of bedside mental status testing of elderly patients are discussed.\r"

Liang's (1986) specification of self-reported physical health is a relatively complex multiple indicators model which may not be practical in actual application. To simplify this formulation, a two-stage strategy was used. First, reliability was estimated for each composite to fix the measurement error variance and the regression of the composite on the latent variable. Second, the model was reestimated by constraining these parameters. Regression analyses were undertaken to assess the impact of using composites instead of multiple indicators. Parameter estimates for causal linkages and residual error variances based on multiple indicators approach were closely reproduced by using composites, thus providing justification for the proposed strategy.\r"

This article analyzes the incidence and determinants of functional disability in a cohort of 1,001 females and males hospitalized with angina or other acute coronary diseases in 1976-77 and followed through 1985. Proportional hazards and logistic models are utilized to examine sex interactions in long-term disability outcomes. Female survivors with angina are shown to be at significantly higher risk for diminished functional capacity when compared to men as well as to women with other heart disease. Thus, the extended survival and higher incidence of angina among elderly women will likely result in an increased societal burden of disablement in the aged population.\r"

Residualized multiple regression analysis showed that Time 2 values of our dependent variables were significantly predicted by their Time 1 values. Age predicted declines in activity levels, while less educated subjects and those reporting lower levels of functional health were more likely to report declines in self-rated health. Less educated subjects were also more likely to report increased psychological distress. Finally, declines in life satisfaction were associated with higher initial levels of psychological distress. These findings are generally in agreement with those found by Palmore et al. (1985) in a different population of older people.\r"

Combining the patch-clamp techniques of recording with immunological methods, we have analyzed the expression and the involvement of these channels during defined steps of LPS-induced B cell activation. We show that the number of K+ channels increased strongly when B cells entered in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The involvement of ion channels in B cell proliferation was assessed using channel blockers that inhibit the K+ current. It was first found that TEA, but not TMA, quinine and verapamil totally suppressed both K+ current and DNA synthesis by stimulated lymphocytes as measured by [3H]TdR uptake or propiedium iodide staining. The drugs affected neither the induction by LPS of activation markers such as Ag of the murine class II MHC and type II receptor for the Fc region of IgG nor the initial cell enlargement that occur early during activation. These data indicate that functional K+ channels are not essential for the transition from the G0 to the G1 phases. In contrast, the same channel antagonists blocked the induction of transferrin receptor expression, characteristic of the final stages of G1. These drugs acted on cells already in G1, because their addition 30 h after LPS still suppressed DNA synthesis, and because they inhibited the proliferation of purified B cell blasts. The effect of tetraethylammonium was reversible, a lag period of 12 h occurring before the cells start DNA synthesis after drug removal. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the proliferation of LPS-stimulated B cells requires functional ion channels at a critical period in the G1 phase, taking place before transferrin receptor expression and the entry into the S phase. The involvement of voltage dependent K+ channels at this particular point is suggested by the parallel effects of the drugs used on K+ currents and DNA synthesis.\r"

In applying the long term culture method, we have established a cloned B cell line named B19-1d, B19-1d cells are specific to MOPC104E or J558 cross-reactive Id and they express surface mu, lambda but no Ly-1. B19-1d do not spontaneously secrete Ig but produce them upon stimulation with bacterial LPS. The effect of B19-1d cell line on idiotypic antibody production was tested. Addition of only 10 to 100 B19-1d cells into dextran-immune B cell culture greatly enhanced the Id+ antidextran antibody responses. On the contrary, the antidextran antibody production was suppressed by the higher doses of B19-1d cells. The effective cooperation between dextran-immune B cells and B19-1d cloned B cells was restricted to class II MHC. The role of idiotypic- and antiidiotypic B-B cell interaction in immune regulation and repertoire generation was suggested.\r"

In addition, T cell clones recognized TSST-1 without processing by APC. These results suggest that the ability of TSST-1 to polyclonally activate T cells is dependent on TCR recognition of the intact toxin molecule bound to a nonpolymorphic region(s) of the Ia molecule resulting in the same activation events induced by Ag recognition.\r"

In these activated hybridomas, we found that DNA was fragmented into 180- to 200-bp multiples. DNA fragmentation was not observed when T cells were maintained after killing with anti-Thy-1 plus C or with heat treatment at 45 degrees C, nor when T cells were incubated with fixed anti-CD4 antibody. Furthermore, fragmentation was detectable at 6 h after incubation when almost all of the cells were still viable as evaluated by trypan blue dye exclusion test. Cell death was prevented by addition of EGTA, cycloheximide, actinomycin D, and zinc, suggesting that the induction of cell death requires Ca2+ influx, newly synthesized protein(s), and involvement of endonuclease.\r"

  ".U": "90187848\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously shown that IL-4 is an essential mediator for the synthesis of human IgE in vitro. In this study we demonstrate that prior physical contact with T cells is required by B cells to synthesize IgE in response to IL-4. Both autologous and allogeneic freshly prepared T cells were consistently able to support IL-4-dependent IgE synthesis, provided that they were added to B cells together with, or before, the addition of IL-4. In addition, most CD4+, as well as a proportion of CD8+, PHA-induced T cell clones (TCC) established from two HLA-DR incompatible donors, supported, in the presence of exogenous IL-4, the synthesis of IgE in B cells from the majority of individuals tested including both donors of cloned T cells. An alloreactive TCC able to produce IL-4 in response to HLA-DR4+ B cells and to induce HLA-DR4+ B cells to synthesize IgE, acquired the ability to support IgE synthesis by B cells lacking the appropriate alloantigen provided that exogenous IL-4 was added. Although the ability of freshly prepared T cells to support IgE synthesis was consistently abrogated by fixation with paraformaldehyde (PF), such a treatment variably affected the IgE-inducing ability of TCC. Preactivation with anti-CD3 before treatment with PF maintained or even enhanced the ability of TCC to support IL-4-dependent IgE synthesis. More importantly, preactivation with anti-CD3, followed by fixation with PF, enabled TCC, apparently devoid of IgE-inducing activity in unfixed condition, to support IL-4-dependent IgE synthesis. Taken together these data suggest that at least two signals are involved in the triggering of human B cells to IgE production: the first is delivered by a T-B cell contact and the second by IL-4. The physical signal delivered by T cells does not necessarily consist of cognate interaction. Non-cognate contact-dependent induction of B cells to IgE synthesis in response to IL-4 appears to be related to molecule(s) distinct from the TCR/CD3 complex, but fully expressed on the membrane of TCR/CD3-activated T cells.\r"

The IgE response of MNC was IL-4 dose-dependent, increasing linearly with IL-4 concentrations between 0.2 and 2.5 ng/ml and plateauing at concentrations of 5 ng/ml or more. rhIL-4-induced IgE synthesis was first detected at 9 days after stimulation and supernatant IgE concentrations reached a maximum on day 18. rhIL-4 stimulated IgE synthesis by MNC from all donors tested, with peak supernatant IgE concentrations ranging from 3 to 372 ng/ml. The nonatopic group (n = 15) geometric mean peak concentration was 24.0 ng/ml and that of the atopic group (n = 19) was 20.0 ng/ml (p = NS). rhIL-4 also stimulated IgG synthesis by MNC from some (but not all) donors in quantities comparable to those induced by PWM. Maximum supernatant IgG concentrations in responders were found 18 days after stimulation. When PWM was added to the IL-4-stimulated cultures, it completely inhibited rhIL-4-induced IgE and IgG synthesis. rhIL-4 also completely inhibited PWM-induced IgG synthesis. Stimulation of IgE synthesis by rhIL-4 required the presence of T cells. T cell clone supernatants did not support rhIL-4-induced IgE synthesis by B cells. T cells from atopic and nonatopic donors restored rhIL-4-stimulated IgE synthesis by B cells from either source to a similar extent.\r"

Whereas the involvement of the cell-mediated manifestations in the pathogenesis of diabetes has been clearly demonstrated, the origin and the relevance of the humoral manifestations is still unclear. In the present study, we have tried to determine whether the humoral manifestations observed in NOD mice were secondary to the cell-mediated antiislet reaction, or whether they resulted from an autonomous polyclonal activation of B cells, a possibility suggested by the notorious presence of antilymphocyte antibodies with thymocytotoxic properties, in the serum of old NOD females. To discriminate between the two alternatives, we have followed the titers of thymocytotoxic autoantibodies in aging males and females, as well as in F1 hybrids where the organ-specific disease is recessive, and in back-crossed mice where the susceptibility genes responsible for insulitis and diabetes have segregated. In addition to thymocytotoxic antibodies, we have also screened the sera of these animals for hyperglobulinemia, antiinsulin, and anti-DNA autoantibodies that are classically associated with polyclonal B cell activation in autoimmune strains of mice. The results indicate that these humoral anomalies are clearly disconnected from the occurrence of diabetes and even of insulitis. Lymphocytotoxic antibodies appear several weeks after the onset of insulitis in NOD mice, are not correlated with disease occurrence and have no predictive value for its onset. The humoral manifestations that include, beside thymocytotoxic antibodies, antiinsulin antibodies, hyperglobulinemia, but no anti-DNA antibodies, are found at the same frequency in F1 mice as in parental mice in spite of the fact that the former are practically free of insulitis lesions. These anomalies are also randomly distributed among back-crossed mice independently of the presence and the severity of the organ-specific lesions. Altogether, these results suggest that NOD mice, like other autoimmune strains, suffer from a genetically inherited defect of B cell regulation resulting in the hyperproduction of natural autoantibodies.\r"

We further analyze the various steps of the Ab responses (Ab1, Ab2, and Ab3) in terms of poly-, mono-, and autospecificities for the pathogenic epitope of the Tg molecule and for the idiotope of the related Ab.\r"

This grouping was made according to their hematologic features, i.e., number of peripheral white blood cells, existence of blastoid cells, presence of STLV-1 Ag on PBL and anti-STLV-1 antibody titers. None of the STLV-1 carriers showed any clinical signs, but STLV-1-specific killer T cells was detected in these PBL without in vitro stimulation. In vitro studies on Ag stimulation showed that the STLV-1-specific killer T cells had been fully activated in vivo, and that no augmentation of in vitro stimulation with STLV-1 Ag was necessary, and that primary in vitro stimulation of normal control PBL was not sufficient to induce specific killer T cells. In addition NK cell activity in PBL of infected monkeys were significantly higher than those in the uninfected.\r"

  ".W": "IL-1 alpha and IL-beta are distinct cytokines, produced by activated macrophages. The temporal sequence in the processing and secretion as well as the mechanism(s) by which IL-1 is secreted from the cells remain undefined. Here we have studied the production of IL-1 from murine macrophages after stimulation with LPS or Listeria monocytogenes by two distinct methods: i) immunoprecipitation of radio-labeled IL-1 peptides from culture supernatants, and ii) determination of IL-1 activity by neutralization with monospecific antisera to either form of IL-1. We confirmed that precursor and mature forms of both IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta can be detected in the culture supernatants after stimulation of the macrophages with 10 to 20 micrograms LPS/ml but, in addition, we report the novel finding that IL-1 beta is exclusively secreted in its unprocessed precursor form after stimulation of the cells with either 0.5 to 1 microgram LPS/ml or with L. monocytogenes. Exposure of the cells to increasing amounts of LPS led to the appearance of a 20-kDa IL-1 beta peptide in the culture supernatants concomitant with the release of a processing activity for the IL-1 beta precursor. These data therefore suggest that, in a first step, IL-1 beta is secreted as an unprocessed precursor protein that in a second, postsecretory step is cleaved by a LPS-inducible protease, thus generating the 20-kDa IL-1 beta peptide. The latter represents the biologically active IL-1 beta inasmuch as the generation of IL-1 beta activity in the culture supernatants strictly correlated with the appearance of the 20-kDa IL-1 beta peptide.\r"

  ".W": "Rabbit antisera raised to human and chicken MHC molecules were used to immunoprecipitate cross-reactive molecules from biosynthetically and cell surface-labeled spleen and/or blood cells of representative vertebrate species. Five major points emerged: 1) There were many nonspecific cross-reactions using these techniques, so various criteria were developed to distinguish these from true MHC-like molecules. 2) Only very small subpopulations of immunogen-specific antibodies cross-reacted with MHC-like molecules in other nonmammalian species. These subpopulations were different for each species and even within a species, sometimes being so limited as to behave like alloantisera. This led to a very scattered pattern of true cross-reactions that sometimes failed to reflect the properties of the bulk antibody population. 3) Antisera containing antibodies to class II beta- and class I alpha-chains cross-reacted better and more widely than those to B-G, class II alpha and, in general, beta 2-microglobulin. 4) Some cross-reactive antibodies were clearly directed to epitopes on the surface of the mature heterodimers, but many seemed to recognize nonlinear cryptic determinants, presumably in the contact regions between the chains. These latter antibodies recognized biosynthetic intermediates and also a variety of unusual cell surface MHC-like molecules present in reptile and amphibian, but absent in the mammal and chicken cells tested. These included E homodimers whose relationship to chicken B-G molecules is unknown. 5) MHC-like molecules were identified in a bird, three reptiles, and two amphibians, but no molecules with the expected properties were found with these reagents in any of the fish tested.\r"

Those that bound were used to immunoprecipitate cross-reactive molecules from biosynthetically or cell surface-labeled spleen or blood cells. In addition, mAb to human MHC molecules were screened by Western blots. As expected from the results with xenoantisera, there were few mAb that cross-reacted, and many of these cross-reactions were not specific for MHC-like molecules. Less than 10% of the mAb tested bound to the cells of any particular species, with very few positive for more than one species. Of those mAb that bound cells, many failed to precipitate any radioactive bands, and most bands precipitated were not recognizable as MHC-like molecules. Five mAb reacted with Xenopus class II, one of which also immunoprecipitated axolotl class II. Another of these reacted with a candidate for class II in the lamprey, but this molecule had features unlike those expected for mammalian class II molecules. Four other mAb reacted with candidate molecules. in the trout and shark. None of the mouse alloantibodies immunoprecipitated nonmammalian vertebrate MHC-like molecules. In contrast to the results with most xenoantisera, the mAb cross-reacting with amphibian class II molecules recognized a number of different linear epitopes on the surface of the polymorphic non-Ig beta 1 domain of class II molecules. Few mAb recognized bands in Western blots of nonmammalian vertebrate cells and the candidate molecules from fish had features different from known mammalian MHC molecules.\r"

  ".W": "The serum lectin, mannan binding protein (MBP), was isolated in a yield of 40 micrograms/liter from pooled normal human serum by affinity chromatography on mannan-Sepharose, followed by gel-filtration and ion-exchange chromatography and finally by passage down an anti-IgM Sepharose column. A rabbit antiserum was prepared against the purified MBP and an enzyme-linked immunoassay developed that used both the specificity of the polyclonal antibody and the Ca+(+)-dependent carbohydrate binding property of MBP. Assay of the sera from 103 blood-donors showed a wide range of MBP levels, ranging from 0 to 870 micrograms/liter. MBP, after interaction with zymosan, caused efficient activation of a C1r2 125I-C1s2 complex that was prepared by incubation of 125I-C1s2 with serum, from a patient with a complete genetic deficiency of C1q, followed by gel-filtration on Sepharose 6B. The purified MBP is composed of a mixture of trimers, tetramers, pentamers, and hexamers of an approximate 90-kDa structural unit as judged by chromatography, SDS-PAGE and electron microscopy studies. Only the molecules in the pentamer/hexamer fraction, which have a similar overall structure to that of C1q, appeared to cause efficient, zymosan-dependent, activation of C1s within the C1r2C1s2 complex. The pentamer/hexamer form of MBP may therefore play an important role in antibody-independent activation of the C system during the early stages of certain infections.\r"

  ".W": "The Third and Fourth International Workshops on Leucocyte Differentiation Antigens identified six mAb, designated CDw32, reacting with human Ig FcR type II (FcRII). We have examined the immunohistochemical and immunocytologic reactivities of these antibodies and find that the antibodies could be divided into three classes of reactivity: 1) antibodies IV.3, CIKM3, and CIKM5 reacted with monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils; 2) antibodies KB61 and 41H.16 gave strong reactions with B lymphocytes, placental and hepatic endothelium, and weaker reactions with monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils; 3) antibody 2E1 gave an intermediate reaction pattern. Immunoprecipitation from U937 cell lysates showed that antibodies KB61 and 41H.16 recognized Mr 41,000 and Mr 37,000 molecules whereas the other antibodies detected a Mr 42,000 molecule. Preclearing with antibody KB61 removed the Ag recognized by the other five antibodies confirming the identity of the Ag and demonstrating reactivity of KB61 with the Mr 42,000 molecule. Antibodies KB61 and 41H.16 precipitated a Mr 41,000 molecule from B lymphocytes. Flow cytometry and immunoprecipitation studies of cells transfected with cDNA clones coding for two isoforms of FcRII showed that all six of the antibodies react with both transfectants but the only immunoprecipitations were obtained using KB61 and 41H.16 and one of the transfectants. The protein sequence of KB61 Ag isolated from leukemic B cells showed close homology with the proteins encoded by the cDNA clones but diverged in the intracytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal region. It was concluded that preferential recognition of one or more of the numerous isoforms of FcRII underlies the differing reaction patterns of CDw32 antibodies.\r"

  ".W": "Membrane cofactor protein (MCP) of the C system is a widely distributed regulatory molecule with C3b/C4b binding and factor I-dependent cofactor activity. A rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against purified human MCP, and it was found to also immunoprecipitate C4b-binding protein (C4bp). Other related complement regulatory proteins, factor H, C3b/C4b receptor, and decay-accelerating factor, were not recognized by this polyclonal antibody to MCP. The cross-reactive epitope was sensitive to reduction with 2-ME and about 3% of the anti-MCP antibody reacted with C4bp. The amino-terminal 48,000-Da, chymotryptic fragment of C4bp was recognized by the antibody to MCP. This fragment of C4bp contains a seven-amino acid peptide that is identical, in its sequence and its location in the third short consensus repeat, to one found in MCP. Two polyclonal antibodies to C4bp, one raised to native and the other to reduced C4bp, did not cross-react with MCP. In addition to this one-way cross-reaction with C4bp, a protein with a m.w. of approximately 60,000 (p60) was found in two of three C4bp preparations that also cross-reacted with antiserum to MCP. p60 was present in trace quantities in the C4bp preparation and was successfully isolated from plasma by C3b affinity chromatography. Its Mr was distinct from that of MCP and other known C3b/C4b binding proteins. Furthermore, p60 was isolated by two different procedures and such material possessed no detectable cofactor activity. Based on these results, p60 is a plasma C3b-binding protein that shares epitopes with C4bp and MCP, and is probably not a soluble form of MCP.\r"

  ".W": "Triggering of eosinophil secretory and cytotoxic functions by stimulation of the IgG and IgE FcR is thought to have major importance in the pathophysiology of tissue eosinophilia. We studied the ability of human rIL-4 to regulate this triggering event in human eosinophils. At doses ranging from 0.1 to 10 pg/ml, IL-4 suppressed eosinophil secretion of beta-glucuronidase and arylsulfatase by up to 65% after stimulation with IgG-coated Sepharose beads. This effect required prolonged preincubation (16 h) of eosinophils with IL-4; no effect was detected after 1 h preincubation. Enzyme secretion stimulated by IgE-coated beads was not affected. Further, IL-4 (after 16 h preincubation), suppressed eosinophil antibody-dependent killing of schistosomula (Schistosoma mansoni) targets by 24 to 39% in four experiments (p less than 0.05). Flow microfluorimetry analysis showed that IL-4 reduced the expression of IgG FcR, but not IgE FcR, suggesting that this mechanism underlies the suppression of IgG-mediated secretion. Taken collectively, these results demonstrate a mechanism for T lymphocyte suppression of IgG-stimulated eosinophil functions via IL-4.\r"

  ".U": "90187879\r", 
  ".W": "The current studies explore the role of phospholipase D (PLD) in mast cell activation. Although most investigators believe that receptor-mediated accumulation of 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) occurs by phospholipase C hydrolysis of phosphoinositides, our previous work indicated a modest role for these substrates and suggested that phosphatidylcholine (PC) is the more likely substrate. PLD cleaves the terminal phosphodiester bond of phospholipids to yield phosphatidic acid (PA), but in the presence of ethanol, it transfers the phosphatidyl moiety of the phospholipid substrate to ethanol producing phosphatidylethanol (PEt); a reaction termed transphosphatidylation. In purified rat mast cells prelabeled with [3H]arachidonic acid, [3H]palmitic acid, or 1-O-[3H]alkyl-lysoPC, a receptor-associated increase in PLD activity was initially suggested by the rapid accumulation of labeled PA, although other mechanisms might be involved. PLD activity was assessed more directly by the production of labeled PEt by PLD-mediated transphosphatidylation in the presence of ethanol. IgE receptor cross-linking resulted in a 3- to 10-fold increase in PLD activity during the 10 min after stimulation, approximately 50% of which occurred during the first two min. PEt formation was dependent on the concentration of ethanol and was maximal at 0.5%. At concentrations of ethanol greater than or equal to 0.2%, receptor-dependent formation of PA was reduced suggesting that the ethanol promoted transphosphatidylation at the expense of hydrolysis. The dose-related decline in PA accumulation seen in the presence of ethanol was similar to ethanol-mediated inhibition of exocytosis suggesting that receptor-mediated PA formation may be of regulatory importance. These observations indicate that PLD-mediated formation of PA occurs in stimulated mast cells and, in conjunction with separate findings of PA phosphohydrolase conversion of PA to DAG in mast cells, suggest that a major mechanism of DAG formation during mast cell activation is PC----PA----DAG.\r"

  ".W": "In the present report we have examined expression of the gene encoding the inflammatory monokine TNF-alpha in murine peritoneal macrophages treated with different forms of low density lipoprotein (LDL). LDL modified by oxidation in vitro is unable to stimulate inflammatory gene expression in peritoneal macrophages. However, treatment of macrophage cultures with oxidized LDL for 6 h or more resulted in a concentration and time-dependent suppression of TNF-alpha mRNA expression induced in response to stimulation with either LPS or maleylated BSA. This suppression was maximal after 12 h of exposure to oxidized LDL and at a concentration of 100 to 200 micrograms LDL cholesterol/ml of culture medium. The suppressive effect was restricted to oxidatively modified LDL as treatment with native LDL or acetylated LDL did not affect TNF-alpha mRNA expression, despite the fact that both acetylated and oxidized LDL lead to intracellular lipid accumulation. The expression of maleyl albumin-stimulated TNF-alpha mRNA expression could be reproduced by lipid extracts of oxidized LDL provided to macrophages at the same cholesterol concentration as from the intact lipoprotein particle. Extracts from native LDL were ineffective. These results suggest that oxidized lipid accumulation in monocytes infiltrating the arterial wall may lead to the suppression of certain inflammatory functions which, in turn, may influence the development of mature atherosclerotic lesions.\r"

BTX and Ver responses were concentration-, time-, temperature-, and Na(+)-dependent. The Na+ channel antagonist tetrodotoxin (1 microM) blocked BTX and Ver responses. Ver (100 microM) produced significant inhibition of cytotoxicity when purified NK cells were incubated with K562 tumor target cells in a 4-h 51Cr release cytotoxicity assay. The effect was blocked by tetrodotoxin. These results strongly suggest presence of functional Na+ channels in NK cells. Activation of voltage-dependent Na+ channels depolarizes cells and reduces their in vitro cytotoxic function.\r"

  ".W": "Chemotactic factor inactivator (CFI) can decrease the neutrophil chemotactic activity of C5a. Gc-Globulin (GcG) can function as a cochemotaxin for C5a by binding to C5a or C5a des Arg and enhancing its chemotactic potency. We hypothesized that CFI might interact with GcG and thus decrease the chemotactic activity of C5a. CFI was found to markedly inhibit the neutrophil chemotactic activity of partially purified C5a containing GcG (p less than 0.01). Addition of GcG was able to reverse the capacity of CFI to inhibit C5a-directed neutrophil chemotaxis (p less than 0.01). CFI had no significant effect on neutrophil chemotaxis when incubated with C5a depleted of GcG or C5a des Arg. CFI was also able to inhibit the interaction of C5a with GcG adsorbed to plastic. To determine if CFI interacted with GcG, a sandwich ELISA was used. These ELISA tests demonstrated that CFI directly interacted with GcG in a dose-dependent manner that was both heat and pH sensitive. To investigate the possibility of enzymatic degradation of C5a by CFI, CFI preparations were analyzed for carboxypeptidase activity, aminopeptidase activity, and for the capacity to cleave dansylated C5a. No enzymatic activity or cleavage was observed. Furthermore, the direct interaction of CFI with C5a and C5a des Arg was assessed by ELISA tests and column chromatography and no interaction was observed. These results suggest that CFI modulates C5a-directed neutrophil chemotaxis by interacting with GcG and preventing GcG from enhancing the chemotactic potency of C5a.\r"

  ".W": "We recently purified human monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) from culture fluids of either human glioma cell lines or mitogen-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes. It has now been shown that MCP-1 is the product of the gene JE, which was first recognized by its expression in fibroblasts stimulated with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). We therefore studied secretion of MCP-1 by three human fibroblast cell lines. Monocyte chemotactic activity was found in culture fluids of all three lines after growth to confluence in DMEM-10% FCS, and the amounts secreted per cell were comparable for the three lines. The MRC-5 line was chosen for further study. Monocyte chemotactic activity secretion by confluent MRC-5 cultures continued after a switch to serum-free medium and was not inhibited by anti-PDGF antibody, indicating that secretion may not have been caused by autocrine release of PDGF. When concentrated serum-free MRC-5 culture fluid was injected into an HPLC gel filtration column, only one chemotactic activity peak was observed, which was in the same location as glioma-derived MCP-1. The activity was completely absorbed out by an anti-MCP-1 affinity column, which indicates that all the chemotactic activity in MRC-5 culture fluid was accounted for by MCP-1. PDGF caused a marked increase in chemotactic activity over that found in serum-free culture fluid of MRC-5 or 501T cells. Immunoprecipitation by anti-human MCP-1 showed two bands, corresponding to the two forms of MCP-1 previously described (MCP-1 alpha and beta); and the amounts increased in response to PDGF stimulation. Thus, the reported increase in human fibroblast JE mRNA in response to PDGF-containing serum stimulation is reflected in increased secretion of the MCP-1 gene product.\r"

PWM-stimulated culture produced higher titer anti-HBc (mean % inhibition +/- SD = 73 +/- 23%, p less than 0.001) than anti-HBe (34 +/- 17%). HBcAg stimulation elicited greater anti-HBc response (43 +/- 26%, p less than 0.001) than did HBeAg for anti-HBe (26 +/- 12%). Both HBcAg and HBeAg induced equivalent anti-HBe response. Anti-HBc production in response to HBcAg was higher in CAH patients (51 to 55%) than in asymptomatic carriers of hepatitis B surface Ag (22 to 28%) irrespective of their HBeAg/anti-HBe status, but reflecting serum anti-HBc value. Similar findings were noted in HBeAg-stimulated anti-HBe production for the two patient groups. In HBeAg- and anti-HBe-positive CAH, HBcAG-stimulated anti-HBc production was similar in T (1.4 x 10(6)) and B (0.6 x 10(6)) cells coculture, and B cells (2 x 10(6)) alone culture. However, in the HBeAg-stimulated culture, T plus B cells produced significantly higher titer anti-HBe than B cells alone did. These results indicate that HBcAg has a relatively higher immunogenicity in terms of antibody production as compared to HBeAg. Furthermore, HBcAg was shown to function as a T cell-dependent and -independent Ag, whereas HBeAg is T cell-dependent during chronic hepatitis virus B infection in man.\r"

The isolation of a quasi-ubiquitously expressed, poorly polymorphic class I gene of the T1a region of the H-2d mouse MHC, namely gene 37 (or T18d), has been recently reported. We describe the nucleotide sequence of a closely related gene, T10c gene, the counterpart of the gene 37 in the large duplicated parts of T1a region of the BALB/c (H-2d) MHC. The T10c gene structure and sequence are very similar to those of gene 37, but T10c gene is most likely a pseudogene. In A/J mouse strain, there appears to be a single gene related to 37, which is also found expressed in a variety of tissues. We show that this gene is likely to be a chimeric one derived from T10c for its 3' part, and from a gene closely related to gene 37 for its 5' part, which potentially encodes for an unusual class I molecule composed of the first two domains. Finally, Southern blot analysis of a number of wild mice and related animals suggests that a gene closely related to the present T10c gene may be the ancestor of this subfamily of class I genes characterized by the presence of an unusual second domain.\r"

It was therefore presumed that these inhibitory mAb were specific for the target cell Ag necessary for effector cell recognition. mAb 1D4 and 7C6 bind to NC-37 cells but do not inhibit fish cytotoxic activity. We now report the isolation and purification of the Ag recognized by mAb 18C2 (inhibitor) and 1D4 (noninhibitor) by affinity chromatography of solubilized NC-37 target cell extracts. The 18C2-purified soluble target Ag (STAg) caused inhibition of cytotoxicity when preincubated with fish NCC. This inhibitory activity was reversible and dose-dependent ranging from 20 to 70% inhibition with 25 to 100 micrograms 18C2 purified STAg/10(6) NCC. STAg purified by 1D4 affinity chromatography had no effect on fish cytotoxicity. mAb 18C2 and 1E7 preabsorbed with 18C2 STAg lost their inhibitory activity when tested in the fish NCC cytotoxicity assay. Preabsorption of the same mAb with 1D4 STAg had no effect on their activity.\r"

In four patients, who together received seven cycles of high doses of IL-2 (up to 12 x 10(6) U per m2 per day), and who developed these side effects, we observed an unexpected increase in plasma levels of C3a, indicating activation of the complement system. C3a levels markedly increased during IL-2 therapy from 4 nmol/liter (mean level) before therapy to 23 nmol/liter at the end of the cycle. Activation of C3 occurred via the classical pathway inasmuch as C4a levels also increased during therapy. Mean daily C3a levels correlated with signs of the VLS, such as daily weight gain (p less than 0.001) and albumin levels (inverse correlation, p less than 0.001). In five additional patients, who together received seven cycles of lower doses of IL-2 (2 x 10(6) U per m2 per day) and who did not develop a VLS, only moderate increases in C3a levels (up to 13 nmol/liter) were observed. The highest levels at the first day of the regimen (mean: 7 nmol/liter) occurred 8 h after the IL-2 infusion. Thus, administration of IL-2 induces a dose-dependent activation of the complement system in vivo, which appeared to be related to the development of side effects of this therapy, such as the VLS.\r"

  ".W": "The emergence of Id variants is a major escape mechanism from anti-Id therapy of human B cell malignancies and of the murine B cell lymphoma 38C13. To determine what impact the epitope specificity of anti-Id antibodies has on the prevention of emergence of such Id variants in the 38C13 lymphoma, anti-Id mAb of varying epitope specificity for the Id of 38C13 tumor cells were produced and studied. Some antibodies, produced by immunizing mice with both the wild-type 38C13 IgM and variant IgM, cross-reacted with wild-type 38C13 IgM and with all four members of a panel of variant IgM. These anti-Id did not react with separated 38C13 IgM H or L chains by Western blot, but did react with the cytoplasmic H chain of the surface Ig- variant cell line T2D that expresses the same H chain as wild-type 38C13 in its cytoplasm but does not express any associated L chain. In contrast, anti-Id of narrower specificity did not react with this H chain. This indicated that the broadly cross-reactive antibodies recognized a stable epitope on 38C13 H chain. When a broadly cross-reactive antibody MS11G6 was compared to S1C5, an antibody of narrower specificity, MS11G6, was superior at preventing tumor growth in mice inoculated with 38C13 cells. Moreover, no surface Ig+ variants emerged in escaping tumors in the MS11G6-treated group, whereas such variants were common in the S1C5 treated group. Both anti-Id were of equal efficacy in eliminating wild-type 38C13 cells by using 38C13 cells in tumor inoculums that had just been cloned in vitro, but MS11G6 was also capable of preventing the growth of several surface Ig+ variant cell lines in vivo. We conclude that anti-Id recognizing more stable Id determinants can limit the emergence of Id variants and therefore be more effective therapeutic agents. This finding is of additional importance as additional in vivo and immunophenotypic studies demonstrated that the generation of Id variants was an ongoing process both in cloned parental 38C13 cells and its variants.\r"

To define whether this treatment activates complement in normal skin and senile hemangioma, we analyzed complement deposition in blood vessels by immunofluorescence. C3 fragments, C8, and C9 were detected with specific polyclonal antibodies. The membrane attack complex of complement (MAC) was demonstrated with a monoclonal antibody which reacts only with a neoantigen of MAC. Amplification of C3 deposition by the alternative pathway was determined on cryostat sections by indirect immunofluorescence with use of C4 deficient guinea pig (GP) serum. Normal skin and hemangiomas from three individuals were studied. In PTLD-irradiated normal skin, the main findings were as follows: 1) C3 fragments, C8, C9, and MAC were deposited in vessel walls; 2) these deposits were not due to denaturation of the proteins since they became apparent only 7 min after irradiation, contrary to immediate deposition of transferrin at the sites of erythrocyte coagulates; 3) the C3 deposits were shown to amplify complement activation by the alternative pathway, a reaction which was specific since tissue necrosis itself did not lead to such amplification; 4) these reactions preceded the local accumulation of polymorphonuclear leucocytes. Tissue necrosis was more pronounced in the hemangiomas. The larger angiomatous vessels in the center of the necrosis did not fix complement significantly. By contrast, complement deposition in the vessels situated at the periphery was similar to that observed in normal skin with one exception: C8, C9, and MAC were detected in some blood vessels immediately after laser treatment, a finding consistent with assembly of the MAC occurring directly without the formation of a C5 convertase. These results indicate that complement is activated in PTDL-induced vascular necrosis, and might be responsible for the ensuing inflammatory response.\r"

In vitro studies have demonstrated delivery of the peptide across mouse but not rat skin. This variation in permeability of skin of animal models prompted us to use human skin in vitro. The melanotropin was applied to the surface of human skin samples through a permeation apparatus and allowed to penetrate for 24 h at 36 degrees C. Passage of the analogue was shown by both bioassay and radioimmunoassay. These assays correlated well and demonstrated both the presence and the biologic integrity of the peptide after transdermal passage. Regional differences were noted in the degree of transdermal penetration. In addition, split thickness skin allowed greater penetration suggesting dermal binding of the hormone. This study is the first to show that a melanotropic peptide can be delivered transdermally through human skin in vitro. This has potential importance in the development of therapies for hypopigmentary disorders and for the stimulation of skin tanning without ultraviolet light.\r"

On day 7, the mice were challenged with 1% TNCB to one ear. Ear swelling responses (as an index of sensitization), serum histamine levels, and biopsy specimens of challenged ears were evaluated in groups of cimetidine- or saline-treated mice at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h after challenge. Additional controls included mice injected with saline or cimetidine and challenged with, but not sensitized to, TNCB (irritant controls). Treatment with cimetidine during the induction but not the elicitation of allergic contact hypersensitivity (ACH) produced a significant enhancement of the response throughout the first 48 h. There was no effect of cimetidine on antigen-presenting cells within the epidermis which might account for this enhancement. Similarly, no difference in mast cell morphology or serum histamine levels between cimetidine- and saline-treated groups was observed. Histologically, the cimetidine-treated animals showed a more intense cellular infiltrate, which was most noticeable at 24 to 48 h, at which time numerous subcorneal and perifollicular neutrophilic abscesses were observed. To further investigate the mechanism of action of cimetidine, mice were injected with cyclophosphamide (150 mg/kg) 2 d prior to sensitization. Mice treated with cyclophosphamide alone or in combination with cimetidine showed no additive or synergistic effect upon the ear swelling response. We conclude that enhancement of ACH by cimetidine is independent of any effect on mast cells or antigen-presenting cells, but may relate to a cimetidine-induced inhibition of the induction of T-suppressor cells at the time of sensitization.\r"

Specifically, it has recently been discussed as a growth promoting agent in keratinocytes. Our aim was to find out whether epidermal cells possess specific receptors for 12-HETE which would mediate the effects of this eicosanoid in skin, including the putative growth stimulating activity. We could identify specific binding sites for 12(S)-HETE on the human epidermal cell line SCL-II. The analysis of binding data revealed a single class of binding sites with a Kd of 2,6 nM and a Bmax of 216,000 sites per cell. The binding was saturable, readily reversible, and specific for 12(S)-HETE with lower affinities for other monoHETE. We failed to detect any significant proliferative activity of 12(S)-HETE in the same epidermal cell line, although we applied three independent methods for evaluation of cell growth and used a concentration of 12(S)-HETE which should enable an optimal receptor occupancy. Thus, epidermal cells possess high-affinity 12(S)-HETE binding sites which are likely to be involved in the effects of this eicosanoid in epidermis. However, biologic effects other than direct growth stimulation seem to be transduced by 12(S)-HETE receptors in epidermal cells which need further investigation.\r"

Membrane expression of BE-2 surpasses that of the membrane receptor for IL-2, another T-cell activation marker, at day 5. The peak expression of BE-2 appears at day 6-8. The appearance of BE-2 could also be demonstrated after anti-CD3 and allogeneic stimulation. Long-term T-cell clones derived from normal donors and maintained in culture with periodic stimulation were also found to express BE-2 continuously. Thus, BE-2 is a late activation marker not expressed on normal peripheral blood lymphocytes and pathologically expressed on circulating malignant cells in the disease CTCL.\r"

Notably, the S-phase data of the upper follicular segments (subdermal 2.4%, infundibular 2.4%) were found to be similar to those of the epidermis (2.5%). This study supporting and supplementing former autoradiographic investigations on human hair matrix epithelium clearly demonstrates the main proliferative activity of the anagen hair follicle being localized in the bulbar segments below Auber's level. Moreover, the method described is well suited for studying the effects of agents influencing cell growth (e.g., hormones or drugs) on the cell kinetics of different anagen hair compartments.\r"

A positive reaction in the dermis, in the basal lamina (lamina densa, lamina lucida), intracellularly and within the plasma membrane including the desmosomes was obtained after incubation with Con A and WGA. PNA binding sites were found predominantly in the plasma membrane between the desmosomes. The labeling with Con A, WGA, and PNA was most pronounced in the upper stratum spinosum and granulosum. Incubation with UEA revealed heavy labeling of the keratohyalin granules and the cytoplasm of the corneocytes. Incubation with DBA and SBA revealed weak labeling of the keratinocytes.

  ".U": "90187942\r", 
  ".W": "Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is characterized by infiltration of the skin by activated CD4+ T lymphocytes. The mechanism by which these T lymphocytes achieve and maintain their activated state is unknown. Antigen-specific activation of T lymphocytes is dependent upon antigen-presenting cells which express HLA-DR class II major histocompatibility complex molecules, such as epidermal Langerhans cells. In addition to CD1+DR+ Langerhans cells, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma lesional epidermis contains major histocompatibility complex class II positive non-Langerhans cell populations, including CD1+OKM5+ bone-marrow-derived cells and DR+ keratinocytes. We asked whether any of these epidermal cell populations demonstrate capacity to activate T lymphocytes. Various numbers of epidermal cells from uninvolved and involved cutaneous T-cell lymphoma plaques were therefore used to stimulate autologous CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in the absence of exogenous antigen. Involved epidermal cells potently induced proliferation of CD4+ T lymphocytes (S.I. +/- SEM = 466 +/- 45). In contrast, uninvolved epidermal cells only induced background levels of proliferation (S.I. +/- SEM = 2 +/- 0.5, N = 8, p less than 0.01). Neither involved nor uninvolved epidermal cells were able directly to activate CD8+ lymphocytes. The capability of involved epidermal cells to activate CD4+ T lymphocytes was dependent upon CD1+DR+ leukocytes and not DR+ keratinocytes, because depletion of either HLA-DR+, CD1+ or HLe1+ epidermal cells totally abrogated the T-lymphocyte proliferation. Interestingly, on a cell per cell basis CD1+DR+ cells obtained from involved skin, demonstrated relative to CD1+DR+ cells from uninvolved skin, enhanced capacity to activate CD4+ T lymphocytes. Furthermore, CD1+OKM5+ cells from involved epidermis stimulated autologous CD4+ T lymphocytes. This indicates that a unique hitherto undescribed CD1+OKM5+ epidermal antigen-presenting cell population may participate in T-lymphocyte activation. These findings provide support for the concept that the epidermal cells in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma patients, particularly the antigen-presenting cells, may contribute significantly to the activation of CD4+ malignant and/or non-malignant inflammatory T lymphocytes within the skin.\r"

  ".W": "Leukocyte trafficking in normal and diseased skin appears to be initially governed by endothelial surface glycoproteins that promote adhesive interactions with circulating leukocytes. In a separate study, we have demonstrated that one of these glycoproteins, endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1), is rapidly induced on postcapillary dermal venules as a direct consequence of experimentally-elicited degranulation of adjacent mast cells (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 86:8972-8976, 1989). A principle endogenous mediator of mast cell degranulation is the neuropeptide substance P. In this study, we exposed organ cultures of neonatal human foreskins for 45 min to substance P or to a substance P analogue (D-pro4, D-trp7,9)SP(4-11) that binds to the identical mast cell surface receptor but which does not provoke histamine release. Dermal mast cells were uniformly degranulated only in explants exposed to substance P, as judged by ultrastructural analysis. After subsequent culture in medium alone for 6 h, superficial venules of explants exposed to substance P showed evidence of ELAM-1 induction, as documented histochemically using H4/18 monoclonal antibody. ELAM-1 was not induced by substance P analogue. Furthermore, preincubation of explants with analogue or with the mast cell inhibitor, cromolyn sodium, abrogated the ability of substance P to induce ELAM-1. From these results we suggest that substance P endogenously released by dermal nerve fibers upon physiologic or electrical stimulation may be important in the regulation of endothelial-leukocyte interactions in vivo. This concept provides further evidence for a neurogenic and psychogenic modulation of the immune response, and may be relevant to the course of naturally occurring dermatoses (e.g., psoriasis) that are commonly exacerbated by emotional stress.\r"

The levels are less than those in the epidermis, thus excluding selective drug distribution as a prime explanation for drug function. Oral isotretinoin markedly increases retinol levels and decreases dehydroretinol levels in the skin while on therapy. The effect is more pronounced in sebaceous glands than in epidermis and dermis. The increased retinol levels probably reflect a metabolic interference with endogenous vitamin A, since isotretinoin cannot be converted into retinol in vivo. Previous studies have shown that dehydroretinol accumulates in hyperproliferative, keratinizing skin lesions and so its reduction with isotretinoin therapy may relate to a reduction in cell proliferation or to dedifferentiation. However, the precise interrelationships of these observations need further elucidation.\r"

Serum samples from 725 adults and 130 children were tested for markers of HBV infection, and histories of exposure to HBV were obtained by interview. The overall prevalence of past or present HBV infection was 26%; prevalence was 9% among whites, 5% among Hispanics, 30% among blacks, and 57% among Haitians. Prevalence of HBV infection was 3% in children aged 2-10 years and increased to 31% in adults greater than 17 years. Of adults seropositive for HBV, only 5% had homosexual partners or used parenteral drugs, but 47% had a positive serologic test for syphilis. Factors associated with HBV infection in adults were positive serologic test for syphilis (odd ratio [OR] = 3.1; 95% confidence limits [CL] = 2.0, 4.8), and having had two or more lifetime heterosexual partners (OR = 3.2; 95% CL = 1.6, 6.4). In this community, HBV infection was transmitted predominantly by heterosexual contact.\r"

Early in the convalescent phase of infection, while HBsAg was present in the serum, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stimulated with preS2 peptide or hepatitis B surface protein. Specific IgG directed to different components of HBsAg was produced without a polyclonal increase in total IgG production. Stimulation with preS2 peptide produced IgG to the preS2 peptide (anti-preS2) and to the S antigen (anti-HBs). Hepatitis B surface protein stimulation produced anti-HBs but not anti-preS2. After this initial reactive phase, the PBMCs did not produce specific antibody when stimulated with either component of HBsAg; this effect lasted greater than 1 year. At some time 1-2 years after acute infection, the pattern of in vitro S antigen- and preS2 antigen-stimulated anti-HBs response reemerged in the PBMCs. Reemergence of sustained preS2 peptide-stimulated anti-preS2 response was not observed.\r"

CD4+ T cells from patients with chronic active hepatitis type B (CAH-B) exhibited a significant proliferative response to HBcAg, especially in hepatitis B envelope antigen (HBeAg)-positive patients. In contrast, there was no apparent T cell reaction to HBcAg in patients with CAH non-A, non-B, HBeAg-positive healthy carriers and in healthy volunteers. The proliferative response to CD4+ cells to bacterial extracts of Escherichia coli was always insignificant in all patients and healthy volunteers. The CD8+ cells did not proliferate in response to HBcAg in any subject, even in the presence of autologous irradiated CD4+ responder cells. The CD8+ cells, preactivated with HBcAg and HBcAg-reactive irradiated autologous CD4+ cells, suppressed the proliferative response to autologous CD4+ cells to HBcAg but not the response to phytohemagglutinin in HBcAg-responder CAH-B patients. CD4-mediated HBcAg-specific enhancement and CD8-mediated HBcAg-specific suppression in the peripheral blood compartments of HBcAg-responsive CAH-B patients are possible.\r"

Prevalence of anti-p40tax was significantly higher in female (62.6%) than in male subjects (51.0%; P less than .05). Anti-p40tax status did not change in most during the observation period. There were significantly more HTLV-1 carriers among children of anti-p40tax-positive mothers (45.3%) than among those from anti-p40tax-negative mothers (20.0%; P less than .01). However, no significant difference was observed between wives of p40tax-positive and -negative men. The p40tax antibody may be a marker of relative infectivity of HTLV-1, albeit an imperfect one.\r"

Of 107 men who were HIV-1 antibody-negative, 105 (98%) were PCR-negative. Two who were initially PCR-positive antibody-negative were PCR- and antibody-negative on repeat testing of both the same specimen and specimens drawn 8-10 months later; this suggests that the first PCR results were false-positive. Of 90 men who were antibody-positive, PCR was positive in 87 (97%), including all 13 with AIDS, all 22 with AIDS-related conditions, all 11 with generalized lymphadenopathy only, and 41 (93%) of 44 without signs or symptoms of HIV-1 infection.

  ".W": "Previous studies of adults challenged with human rotavirus (CJN strain) showed that 74% became infected and 55% of those infected experienced illness. Protection against infection correlated with rotavirus antibody, most significantly (P = .005) serum rotavirus IgG. In this study, 20 previously challenged subjects were reinoculated with the same virus 9-12 months after their initial challenge. Only 1 of 8 subjects not infected after the initial challenge and 2 of 12 infected after the first inoculation became infected after reinoculation; none became ill. Titers of rotavirus antibodies (serum, jejunal, and stool) at the time of reinoculation were about as high as or higher than they were before the initial inoculation. This correlated with greater protection, but the extent of protection was significantly greater (P less than .0001) than predicted based on a previous model relating protection and preinoculation titers of serum rotavirus IgG. Thus, inoculation with human rotavirus provided homotypic protection for at least 9-12 months, and protection remained correlated with higher concentrations of rotavirus antibody. However, the specific relationship between protection and rotavirus antibody was altered after the initial inoculation.\r"

The differences in mean titer among groups were insignificant (P greater than .01). The titer significantly decreased during the first 3 years after the revaccination but remained stable for at least 30 years thereafter (geometric mean titer, 10.5; 95% confidence interval, 6.8-16.4). The results suggest that there is probably no need for routine revaccinations beyond the primary and two revaccinations; nevertheless, persons at high risk should be revaccinated regardless of their vaccination status.\r"

Subjects with symptomatic CMV infection were more likely than asymptomatic subjects to have positive cultures of leukocytes (17/18 vs. 9/17, P = .01). In contrast, symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects did not differ in their IgG or IgM CMV antibody test responses. In subjects with symptomatic infection, viral shedding typically began early in the course of infection, often preceding symptoms, while the serologic response usually followed the appearance of symptoms. With the use of the shell vial procedure to facilitate detection of positive cultures, symptomatic CMV infections following kidney or liver transplantation can be recognized earlier and more reliably using viral culture than by serologic testing.\r"

All infected family contacts had diagnostically elevated serologic tests for pertussis at the time the index case was diagnosed. Culture identified only 20% of infected contacts. Infected individuals had a mean of 5.5 of 10 antibody tests diagnostic for recent infection. ELISA assay for IgG to pertussis toxin and assay for IgA to filamentous hemagglutinin on serum and nasal secretions were the most discriminating diagnostic tests. Index cases and immunized contacts had different type and timing of antibody responses, making a single assay or sampling unable to identify all infected individuals. Symptomatic infection was characterized by higher magnitude of pertussis toxin antibody response and asymptomatic infection by filamentous hemagglutinin. After pertussis immunization, immunity to disease is greater than is protection from infection.\r"

Transplacental pertussis IgG antibody concentrations in newborns were found to be comparable to corresponding maternal concentrations and to decline with a half-life of approximately 6 weeks. By the age of 4 months, most infants had no detectable antibodies to LPF or FHA. Higher concentrations of maternally derived antibody to LPF were associated with a significantly weaker antibody response to conventional vaccine. In contrast, acellular vaccine stimulated superior antibody production, regardless of antecedent concentrations of antibody to LPF. The data support continuation of the current schedule of pertussis immunization and further efforts to develop an acellular vaccine for use in young infants.\r"

Of 9780 Shigella-infected inpatients, 889 (9.1%) died; 32.3% of deaths occurred in children less than 1 year of age. Fatality rates were highest (10.3%) in Shigella sonnei-infected patients and lowest (6.7%) in Shigella dysenteriae type 1-infected patients. Age less than 1 year, lack of breast feeding in patients 1-2 years of age, hypothermia, severe malnutrition, severe dehydration, altered consciousness, abdominal distension, thrombocytopenia, hypoproteinemia, hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, renal failure, and bacteremia were all significantly more common in case patients. In a multivariate analysis, younger age, decreased serum protein, altered consciousness, and thrombocytopenia were predictive of death. Thus in Bangladesh the fatality rate for hospitalized patients infected with any species of Shigella remains high despite relatively intensive inpatient care, and young, hypoproteinemic patients are at greatest risk of fatal illness.\r"

Patient-to-patient transmission was proved by restriction enzyme analysis of bacterial DNA. Between patients the endoscope had been mechanically cleaned using a detergent and treated with 70% ethanol.

The other patients, remaining in an infectious state without clear exacerbations for longer periods, were persistently infected by a particular H. influenzae strain (median persistence time, 5.5 months; range, 2-23 months). Of 8 antibiotic-treated patients, 7 remained infected by H. influenzae with the same DNA fingerprint, although all strains were sensitive to the antibiotics prescribed.

Gram stains of vaginal secretions were evaluated for bacterial vaginosis. Among 166 cases and 175 controls, infection with N. gonorrhoeae was associated with preterm birth. Four percent of controls and 11% of cases were infected with N. gonorrhoeae (odds ratio 2.9, 95% confidence interval 1.2-7.2). This association was independent of age, rupture of membranes, and hypertension. Other STDs were not associated with preterm birth. The attributable risk of gonococcal infection was 14%. Gonococcal infection appears to be responsible for a substantial proportion of premature births and is theoretically preventable by antenatal case detection and treatment.\r"

Blood samples were obtained before administration and serially thereafter for the assessment of serum pharmacokinetics, nephrotoxicity, and biochemical parameters. Before drug treatment, diabetic rats demonstrated marked increases in serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels compared with levels in nondiabetic rats. A significant increase in serum creatinine levels was observed in nondiabetic rats given free AmB but not in other groups. Whereas AmB pharmacokinetics were significantly altered in diabetic rats administered free AmB, no kinetic differences were found between groups given L-AmB. Renal AmB levels were markedly increased in nondiabetic rats given free AmB compared with those in all other groups. Furthermore, significantly greater concentrations of free AmB were found in lung tissue of rats administered L-AmB independent of disease state. Hepatic levels of AmB were reduced in diabetic rats administered free AmB. The disposition and nephrotoxicity of L-AmB were independent of vascular lipid composition.\r"

During a 9-month period, stool specimens from 188 patients with acute diarrhea and 108 healthy age-matched control children were examined for enteric bacterial pathogens, protozoa, enteric adenovirus, and rotavirus. An enteropathogen was identified in 75 patients (40%) and in 21 controls (20%). A random sample of specimens without an identifiable pathogen was then examined for SRV particles by immune electron microscopy (IEM) using commercial human gamma globulin. Viruses of 26-30 nm diameter that were not enteroviruses were detected in specimens from 9 (12.5%) of the 72 patients and 1 (1.8%) of the 53 control subjects (P less than .04). Of 6 patients with available acute and convalescent sera, 4 demonstrated a significant immune response when tested by IEM. All patients experienced a mild, self-limited (1-3 days) illness. These findings suggest that SRV may be endemic in the Baltimore community and may result in clinically significant diarrheal illnesses.\r"

We injected either group B Streptococcus or phosphate-buffered saline solution intraperitoneally into adult and newborn rats. Human granulocytes, labeled with chromium 51, were transfused seven hours later. When the newborn rats were killed 13 to 19 hours after injection, they had 10(2) to 10(6) cfu/gm Streptococcus organisms in both lung and brain. Only one third of the adult rats had 10(2) to 10(4) cfu/gm Streptococcus organisms in either lung or brain. A greater proportion of the transfused granulocytes was present in lung and brain tissue of newborn rats, compared with adult rats (p less than 0.05), irrespective of infection. Granulocyte transfusion did not change the peripheral blood leukocyte count in adult rats but increased the count in newborn rats (p less than 0.05). The immature myeloid pool in the bone marrow of adult rats increased significantly with either infection or transfusion (p less than 0.01). The immature pool in newborn rats increased significantly only with infection (p greater than 0.001), although the combination of infection and transfusion also had a significant effect on the pool (p less than 0.01). Infection and both infection and transfusion, but not transfusion alone, significantly affected the mature myeloid bone marrow pool in adult and newborn rats (p less than 0.001). The depletion of the mature myeloid elements of the bone marrow in response to infection was dramatic in neonatal rats, compared with that in adult rats. Both transfused granulocytes and hematogenously spread streptococci lodge in the brains and lungs of neonatal rats more effectively than in those of adult rats.\r"

  ".W": "Current teaching concerning the frequency of abnormal results secondary to chance alone in a multichannel panel is theoretically based on the binomial distribution. However, this distribution can be used only when the probability of an abnormal result (pi) is the same for each test in the panel. In modern-day multichannel testing, pi varies from test to test and most often is less than the usually reported 0.05. On the other hand, a test such as cholesterol may have a pi level as high as 0.55. Theoretically the only distribution that can take this variability into consideration is the Lexis distribution, a form of the binomial distribution that allows for varying pi s. Since no formula is available to calculate this distribution, we wrote a computer program to generate it. We arranged 18-test panels from 203 normal patients in a frequency distribution. This was then compared with the theoretical Lexis and binomial distributions. This analysis showed that although there was a 50% chance of having one abnormality per panel and a 16% chance of having two abnormalities per panel, there was less than 4% chance of having three or more abnormalities per 18-test panel. In addition, most of the abnormalities noted were minor and were thought to be clinically unimportant.\r"

When endothelial cell ATP levels were depressed to 0.93 +/- 0.14 pmol/micrograms protein (compared with 4.96 +/- 0.6 pmol/micrograms protein in control cells) by hydrogen peroxide generated with 25 mU/ml glucose-glucose oxidase over 45 minutes, ATP levels returned to 1.73 +/- 0.21 pmol/micrograms protein during a 3-hour recovery period after oxidant injury ceased. When 25 microM ATP, ADP, AMP, or adenosine was added to the recovery media, intracellular ATP was significantly (p less than 0.001) increased to greater than 4.4 pmol/micrograms cell protein for each metabolite. HPLC of supernatants from oxidant-injured endothelial cells incubated with ATP, ADP, and AMP demonstrated extracellular metabolism of the adenine nucleotides to adenosine. When adenosine transport was inhibited with dipyridamole and nitrobenzylthioinosine, recovery of intracellular ATP by exogenous ATP, ADP, AMP, and adenosine was significantly (p less than 0.001) inhibited. Such cells were intact, as demonstrated by lack of LDH release. When oxidant stress was prolonged to 90 minutes, ATP depletion was irreversible, regardless of exogenously supplied adenosine; such cells demonstrated loss of cell integrity as demonstrated by release of intracellular LDH. Our results demonstrated that exogenous adenine nucleotides enhance recovery of oxidant-induced ATP depletion through metabolism to adenosine and subsequent adenosine uptake. Prolonged oxidant injury resulted in irreversible ATP depletion and loss of cell integrity that was not altered by exogenously supplied adenosine.\r"

  ".W": "Preceding studies showed that fibrin-monomer of the type lacking only fibrinopeptide A (alpha-fibrin) cleared from the circulation more rapidly than a tighter aggregating form of monomer that lacks both fibrinopeptides A and B (alpha beta-fibrin). The rapid clearance of alpha-fibrin may be related to the high dissociability of the soluble complexes that it forms with fibrinogen in blood. In this study, we use cross-linking by factor XIIIa to suppress dissociation of fibrin complexes and examine the effect of the cross-linking on the circulatory half-life of the fibrin. Incubation of alpha-fibrin-monomer/fibrinogen solutions with factor XIIIa before injection in rabbits increased the circulatory half-life of the fibrin (range, 2 to 16 hours) in proportion to the percentage conversion of monomer to cross-linked dimers and small oligomers. Electrophoretic analyses of plasma samples confirmed that, compared with non-cross-linked monomer, cross-linked dimers and small oligomers were long lived and, further, were not degraded. The inhibition of clearance through cross-linking occurs only under conditions that produce partial cross-linking of the fibrin. An opposite effect occurs when cross-linking is allowed to approach completion, as a result of polymerization of the fibrin into large fibers that disappear almost immediately after injection. Cross-linking elicited in vivo with injected factor XIIIa has an inhibitory effect on clearance of injected monomer similar to the effect produced by partial cross-linking in vitro. It is proposed that the prolonged survival of cross-linked dimers and small oligomers in the circulation provides a partial explanation for the frequent prevalence of cross-linked rather than non-cross-linked complexes in blood of human subjects with vascular disease.\r"

  ".W": "C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute-phase protein whose serum concentration can rise dramatically after onset of inflammation. Although the precise physiologic role of elevated CRP is not known, in vitro studies have shown that CRP potentially has both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties. We hypothesized that an elevation in serum CRP may be a mechanism to control acute inflammation by down-regulating some neutrophil functions. Therefore, elevated serum CRP levels in an inflammatory state in the lung, such as the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), may have a protective effect. We observed that highly purified CRP, at levels greater than 25 micrograms/ml, inhibited both random neutrophil movement and C5a-induced chemotaxis. Neutrophils incubated with CRP showed a dose-dependent diminution of migration toward chemotactic stimuli, with complete inhibition occurring at 100 micrograms/ml. This inhibitory effect of CRP on neutrophil movement was only partially reversed by washing the CRP-treated cells before assaying their chemotactic movement to 1 nmol/L C5a. Next we examined the neutrophil chemotactic activity of serum collected from normal nonsmokers, from patients at high risk for developing ARDS, and patients with ARDS. Both high-risk and ARDS serums has significantly less (p less than 0.001) neutrophil chemotactic activity than serums from normal subjects. In addition, serums from high-risk and ARDS patients had significantly elevated (p less than 0.001) levels of CRP compared with normal subjects. Anti-CRP treatment of ARDS and high-risk serum samples resulted in a significant increase (p less than 0.05) in the neutrophil chemotactic activity. Finally, addition of highly purified CRP to normal serum significantly reduces its neutrophil chemotactic activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The levels of CSF Enk and X-Enk before surgery in patients with Parkinson's disease were significantly less than those observed in control patients (Enk, 166 +/- 38 vs 264 +/- 44 pg/ml; X-Enk, 794 +/- 416 vs 1497 +/- 153 pg/ml). NPY levels did not differ (221 +/- 25 vs 193 +/- 23 pg/ml). After surgery, lumbar CSF samples were taken at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, and 9 months.

  ".W": "The disordered production of extracellular inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) by cartilage contributes to calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal formation and associated diseases. We have previously shown that a factor(s) derived from human platelets markedly stimulates the accumulation of PPi in the media of porcine articular cartilage in organ culture. This is the first known physiologic modifier of PPi production by cartilage. We report herein that platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) is not the platelet factor responsible for PPi stimulation and that the active factor is not mitogenic for chondrocytes. PDGF added to the media of articular cartilage explants in the presence of 0.5% (platelet-poor) plasma (PPP) produces 3.92 +/- 1.6 mumol/L PPi compared with 2.85 +/- 0.7 mumol/L PPi in cartilage exposed to PPP alone. The platelet extract (PE) and PDGF are mitogenic for adult articular chondrocytes in high-density monolayer cultures. Anti-PDGF antibodies block the mitogenic effects of PDGF and PE. The uptake of thymidine labeled with tritium is 157% of control in cells exposed to PE, PPP, and polyclonal goat immunoglobulin G (IgG); 114% of control in cells exposed to PE, PPP, and anti-PDGF antibody; 148% of control in cells treated with PDGF, PPP, and goat IgG; and 98% of control in cells treated with PDGF, PPP, and anti-PDGF antibody. However, anti-PDGF antibody has no effect on PPi accumulation. PPi levels are 17.22 +/- 1.6 mumol/L in media from cartilage treated with PPP, goat IgG, and PE and 17.62 +/- 2.2 mumol/L in cartilage exposed to PE, PPP, and anti-PDGF antibody. We have further characterized the platelet factor responsible for the stimulation of PPi by cartilage. It is not mitogenic for chondrocytes, and it is not PDGF.\r"

  ".W": "Damage to the endothelial surface of an artery invokes a hemostatic response that causes platelet deposition and activation of the coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways on the exposed subendothelial surface. Plasma fibrinogen is rapidly adsorbed at the site of injury. To gain insight into fibrinogen uptake, undamaged and de-endothelialized rabbit thoracic aortas were pretreated with various concentrations of thrombin and then incubated with fibrinogen labeled with iodine 125 in vitro. Uptake of fibrinogen by the subendothelium was not affected by low thrombin concentrations (less than 10 nmol/L), probably because of the antithrombin capacity of the vessel wall to inactivate any thrombin adsorbed. Over the thrombin concentration range of 10 to 90 nmol/L. fibrinogen binding increased linearly as binding of thrombin labeled with iodine 131 increased. In contrast, treatment of the subendothelium with enzymatically inactive thrombin did not enhance fibrinogen binding. Fibrinogen binding was inhibited by exposing the thrombin-treated subendothelium to hirudin or phenylalanyl-prolyl-arginyl-chloromethyl ketone. High thrombin concentrations (greater than 100 nmol/L) caused either a steadily decreasing uptake of fibrinogen with low fibrinogen concentrations or fibrin coagulation on the subendothelial surface from a high fibrinogen concentration. Glycyl-prolyl-arginyl-proline (0.1 mg/ml), a selective inhibitor of fibrin polymerization, inhibited 72% to 78% of fibrinogen uptake by the thrombin-treated subendothelium. Fibrinogen uptake was Ca2(+)-dependent, but ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (10 mmol/L) did not displace subendothelium-bound fibrinogen. Plasmin effectively removed at least 75% of bound fibrinogen, indicating an extracellular location for the protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Monomeric subunits of the globular domain of type IV collagen from human renal basement membrane were isolated and characterized. The monomers, M24, M26, M28+, and M28 , which have been identified previously in human glomerular basement membrane, were characterized by amino acid analysis, amino-terminal sequencing, and electrophoretic mobility. The results indicate that M24 and M26 are derived from alpha 1(IV) and alpha 2(IV) collagen chains, respectively. Amino-terminal sequencing revealed that M28+, and M28 correspond to the globular domain of novel collagen chains. M28 has been characterized as the principal target antigen in Goodpasture's syndrome and antiglomerular basement membrane (GBM) nephritis, and both M28 species are absent from the GBM in Alport familial nephritis. The cationic charge of M28 appears to be a consequence of a relatively high concentration of basic amino acids when compared with other monomers. Previous studies of bovine GBM have demonstrated chains with amino-terminal sequence homology to M28+ and M28 .\r"

Of the 108 patients whose fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) showed granulomatous changes, 68 had subsequent surgery and histological confirmation of the cytological appearance. Sixty-three had TBLN, thus the specificity of FNAC was 93 per cent in diagnosing tuberculous related granulomatous lymphadenopathy. One false positive FNAC was reported histologically to be metastatic mucoepidermal carcinoma. Of the 1,193 patients, 90 patients had subsequently TBLN confirmed histologically. Of these 90 patients, FNA from 69 showed granulomatous changes or acid fast bacilli (AFB), thus the sensitivity of FNAC in detecting tuberculous lymphadenopathy was 77 per cent. Fifty-two cytological smears were stained for acid fast bacilli. Nineteen (37 per cent) contained AFB. It is evident from this review that FNAC is an efficient way to detect cervical tuberculous lymphadenopathy.\r"

Although these modalities confirm the diagnosis and give anatomical information to facilitate accurate staging, they do not provide functional data. The use of radionuclide scintigraphy can add an extra physiological dimension to glomus tumour imaging. Iodine-131/123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is a tumour imaging agent which has been used to diagnose head and neck neuroendocrine tumours to include paragangliomata and medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (MCT). However, it is expensive and the new head and neck tumour imaging agent technetium-99 m (Tc99m) (v) dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) has superceded it as the imaging agent of choice to evaluate MCT. We report a patient with a glomus jugulare tumour which was evaluated with I131/I123-MIBG and Tc99m (v) DMSA. The tumour was functional and is the first reported case exhibiting positive accumulation of both I131-MIBG and Tc99m (v) DMSA. The patient was subsequently treated with a therapeutic dose of I131-MIBG. The significance of these results is discussed.\r"

Parental smoking was an important determinant of middle ear underpressure and effusion, and accounted for much of the associations observed with dampness, crowding and rented accommodation. Gas cooking was associated with a higher prevalence of effusion, but a lower prevalence of underpressure; this may deserve further study. After adjustment for seasonal variation, tenure and household smokers, the weekly mean temperature in the bedrooms of 34 children with Type B tympanograms was 18.2 degrees C, compared to 17.9 degrees C for 190 children with Type A tympanograms. The equivalent figures for bedroom relative humidity were 51.8 per cent and 52.7 per cent. It is unlikely that heating or ventilation of the home is an important determinant of middle ear effusion and underpressure in this age-group.\r"

The most valuable items for making the diagnosis were classified according to their sensitivity, specificity and predictive value. Among the 278 patients, 100 individuals had myocardial infarctions (MI), 47 had unstable angina, 25 had stable angina and 106 patients had a non-coronary disease. The twelve most sensitive items for distinguishing MI from other conditions were the following: sudden onset of pain (70%); duration of more than 60 min (88%); constriction and squeezing (79%); oppression (75%); prior anginal attacks (61%); sex male (72%); age over 60 years (74%); abnormal heart auscultation (62%); abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) (98%); segment (ST) disturbances (86%); increased glucose level (77%); CKMB fraction greater than 6% of total creatine kinase (CK) level (63%). Among the twelve most specific items, also with the best positive predictive value, irradiation in the right arm is of most importance; among the 51 patients with right arm involvement, 48 suffered from a coronary disease and 41 from a myocardial infarction. The largest extension of pain was reported in the latter group. It is concluded that chest pain with a wide irradiation involving the right arm strongly suggests that a myocardial infarction is ongoing.\r"

Body composition, regional adipose tissue distribution, regional fat cell sizes and metabolic variables were followed before treatment, after 5% weight loss and at the stage when there was no further weight loss. Premenopausal women lost less body fat and relapsed earlier after treatment, compared with menopausal women. Fat loss appeared to be more uniform, and included several adipose tissue regions in postmenopausal women, while younger women seemed to lose fat mainly from the epigastrial fat cells. Higher baseline levels of thyroid hormones were associated with increased fat loss and a tendency to lose less lean body mass. Waist/hip and waist/thigh ratios did not change in response to weight loss. The addition of fibre to the diet did not affect the rate of relapse. These results suggest that obesity treatment by implementation of a negative calorie balance might be more successful in postmenopausal than in younger women, perhaps due to the more uniform availability of body fat in the former.\r"

In patients treated with ASA, median serum TXB2-levels were 4% and TXB2-levels in bleeding-time blood were less than 16% of the corresponding levels in patients without ASA (P less than 0.01). The results show that in elderly atherosclerotic patients very low doses of ASA substantially suppress TXB2 formation, not only in serum but also at the site of local haemostasis. The extent of suppression is comparable to that previously reported from young healthy subjects.\r"

Hospital mortality was 12.9% in all patients and 8.9% in patients under 70 years of age. Six hundred and six patients were discharged from the hospital and followed up for 2 years. The 2-year mortality in ischaemic heart disease was 14.4% in all patients and 9.5% in patients under 70 years of age and, including all causes of death, 20.3% and 14.6%, respectively. Our policy for medical treatment included frequent use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, even in heart failure, and restricted use of antiarrhythmic drugs and digitalis. A short delay of admission may have been beneficial for the result of different kinds of anti-ischaemic intervention. Furthermore, a routinely performed exercise ECG before discharge and after 6 weeks, as part of a structured follow-up, has improved our ability to detect complications at an early stage and to optimize medical treatment.\r"

The study was repeated after 5-7 weeks of therapy with the bile acid-binding resin, cholestyramine. The rate of synthesis of VLDL triglyceride was increased by 85% (P less than 0.05) during resin therapy. Simultaneously, the fractional catabolic rate of VLDL was increased by 40% (P less than 0.02), so that only a moderate increase in plasma concentration was observed. Repeated measurements of VLDL size by electron microscopy (before, 1 week, and 5-7 weeks after initiation of therapy) indicated that a transient increase in VLDL size occurred in response to cholestyramine. The results are consistent with a stimulatory effect of bile acid sequestrants on VLDL triglyceride production and indicate that, in most subjects, a compensatory increase in VLDL triglyceride removal occurs.\r"

  ".W": "Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) is currently used in the treatment of various malignant tumours. Development of different autoimmune disorders has been reported in some patients during IFN-alpha therapy. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) after treatment with IFN-alpha has not been described, although a majority of SLE patients have demonstrable serum levels of IFN-alpha, which correlate with disease activity and have been suggested to be of pathogenetic significance. In this paper we describe a patient with a malignant carcinoid tumour who developed a SLE-like syndrome during treatment with leucocyte IFN-alpha. The patient developed myalgia and low grade arthritis in multiple joints together with a high titre of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and anti-dsDNA antibodies. After the treatment was stopped, the symptoms subsided although a moderate ANA titre persisted. However, the tumour continued to regress despite cessation of IFN-alpha therapy. During a short course with recombinant IFN-alpha the syndrome relapsed, supporting the concept that the SLE syndrome was precipitated by IFN-alpha. A connection between IFN-alpha treatment, the induced autoimmune disorder and regression of the carcinoid tumour is suggested.\r"

Blood from seventy-eight of the victims was screened for carboxyhemoglobin at the Institute for Forensic Sciences in Puerto Rico and was then sent to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, Maryland, for analysis of carboxyhemoglobin and cyanide concentrations. The blood data indicated that carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide, singly or combined, were probably not responsible for the majority of the deaths that occurred in the badly burned victims. On the other hand, the significantly higher carboxyhemoglobin in the nonburned victims indicated that carbon monoxide alone or combined with hydrogen cyanide probably played a major role in the cause of their deaths.\r"

Three patients had early life meningitis and developed symptoms of syringomyelia eight, 21, and 23 years after the acute infection. One patient had a spinal dural thoracic AVM and developed a thoracic syrinx 11 years after spinal subarachnoid haemorrhage and five years after surgery on the AVM. A fifth patient had tuberculous meningitis with transient spinal cord dysfunction followed by development of a lumbar syrinx seven years later. Arachnoiditis can cause syrinx formation by obliterating the spinal vasculature causing ischaemia. Small cystic regions of myelomalacia coalesce to form cavities. In other patients, central cord ischaemia mimics syringomyelia but no cavitation is present. Scar formation with spinal block leads to altered dynamics of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow and contributes to the formation of spinal cord cystic cavities.\r"

The mean (SD) duration of the disease was 10 (6) months. None of the patients had been previously treated with levodopa or other anti-parkinsonian drugs. The results show VEP and PERG abnormalities that are spatial stimulus dependent, with higher frequencies being more involved and also indicate that VEP changes are not entirely dependent on alterations at the retinal level.\r"

  ".U": "90188420\r", 
  ".W": "The relationship between thermographic asymmetry in various parts of the face and indices of ocular sympathetic outflow was examined in 80 patients with unilateral migrainous headache. Both during and between episodes of headache, the pupil on the symptomatic side dilated more slowly and less extensively in darkness than the opposite pupil, indicating that ocular sympathetic outflow was compromised in some patients. In such cases the upper forehead and orbital region were warmer on the symptomatic side during migraine. In contrast to these signs of a reduction in cervical sympathetic outflow, eyelid separation was greater on the symptomatic side in patients with headache on the side that was usually affected. During the headache-free interval no consistent thermographic asymmetry was detected and eyelid separation was similar on both sides. These findings suggest that extracranial vascular changes and ocular sympathetic dysfunction during migraine are secondary to activation of trigeminal-vascular reflexes or to antidromic release of vasoactive substances from trigeminal nerve terminals. A secondary deficit in the sympathetic pathway to the symptomatic pupil could also prevent the expression of an increase in sympathetic outflow during headache.\r"

In some instances co-contraction of the elbow agonist and antagonist (measured just before the onset of movement) decreased with time after stroke.

There was no difference between the two groups for age or length of time after the acute herpes zoster infection. The PHN group showed significant changes in all sensory threshold measurements when the affected area was compared with the mirror-image area on the unaffected side, while the NoPHN group exhibited no threshold changes. Mechanical allodynia was present in 87% of the PHN group; half of the 12 patients with ophthalmic PHN showed extension of allodynia to the maxillary distribution. No differences in skin temperature were recorded between affected and unaffected regions in either group. Our findings show a deficit of sensory functions mediated by both large and small primary afferent fibres and also suggest major central involvement in the pathophysiology of the condition. If PHN does not occur following acute herpes zoster, recovery of neural functions appears to be good.\r"

In addition to healthy subjects, patients with schizophrenia were also studied. A total of 447 rCBF studies were carried out during the following conditions: the Wisconsin Card Sort Test, a numbers matching test, a symbols matching test, Raven's Progressive Matrices, an auditory discrimination test, an auditory control task, two versions of a visual continuous performance task, line orientation, semantic classification, and resting. On the whole, those tasks that seem to require or allow for internal verbalisation resulted in the greatest activation of the left hemisphere compared with the right; right hemisphere activation predominated only in the two tasks primarily involving attention and vigilance. Furthermore, a consistent regional topography of normal cerebral functional laterality was seen: under most conditions left prefrontal cortical activity exceeded that of right prefrontal cortex; during all non-auditory tasks, parieto-occipital cortical activity had an opposite pattern-greater right than left. During most conditions the schizophrenic patients displayed the same pattern. While several cognitively specific between-group differences were found, no single cortical region was consistently implicated and no specific direction of abnormal asymmetry predominated. These data suggest that there is a predominant task-independent functional pattern of cortical activity emphasising relatively greater left anterior and right posterior activation. This pattern may reflect the verbal and attentional primacy of these areas, respectively.\r"

  ".W": "A quantitative study has been made of the number of neurofibrillary tangles and of the choline acetyltransferase activity in several sites in the cerebral hemispheres of eight patients who had had Alzheimer's disease. The neurofibrillary tangles were maximal in structures in the medial temporal lobe (uncus, amygdala, hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus), severe in the neocortex on the lateral surface of the temporal lobe, moderate in the \"association cortex\" of the parietal and frontal lobes and minimal in primary somatic and visual sensory areas. There was a significant decrease in choline acetyltransferase activity in almost all areas, and the means of the percentage decreases for the different groups of areas correlate well with the counts of the neurofibrillary tangles. These results support the hypothesis that the pathological process in Alzheimer's disease may spread along a sequence of corticocortical connections between the main sensory areas and the hippocampal formation. The disease process may also spread along the reciprocal connections between the amygdala and the neocortex because the numbers of tangles in different areas of the neocortex closely parallel the density of their connections and the amygdala.\r"

Time series, a statistical technique that may be appropriate when data are measured repeatedly and at nearly equal intervals of time, has potential research applications in the study of chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and herpes simplex. Both intervention models and multivariate models are covered, with examples illustrating the utility of time series techniques in chronic disease research. Time series modeling of a subject with diabetes before and after being placed on a regimen of chlorpropamide is used to demonstrate the potential of intervention analysis. Multivariate time series techniques are illustrated by modeling the relationship between exercise and blood glucose, and by modelling the relationship between psychosocial distress and lymphocyte subsets of the cellular immune system.\r"

The Center tries to adapt to the changing needs of the potential users of their data, including health planners and policy analysts, and academicians. This is illustrated by the increasing emphasis on medical care utilization, especially in long term care, on disease prevention and health promotion issues and on international comparisons. Clinical investigators should be familiar with the NCHS reports, if only to avoid duplication of effort. But beyond that, the information they present can be used to develop hypotheses, estimate variances for sample size determinations, and provide useful model instruments and methods. Beyond that, the NCHS does not analyze and report exhaustively on these data, if only because of lack of resources, so that it makes most of these data available for further research at a nominal charge. Many doctoral dissertations have been based on these tapes as the primary data source for detailed content analysis and/or for methodologic innovation.\r"

  ".W": "In a French case-control study of 1010 women with breast cancer and 1950 controls with nonmalignant disease, the variations of the effects of 8 risk factors for breast cancer as a function of age at diagnosis, were analysed by tests of homogeneity and trend. The risks associated with a late age at first full-term pregnancy and with nulliparity were different between age-groups (test of homogeneity: p = 0.03), and the highest risks for these two factors were observed in women 45-54 years old. The risks associated with Quetelet index were also found to vary with age at diagnosis (test for trend: p = 0.008). A high Quetelet index decreased the risk of breast cancer in the younger age-groups; this decrease of risk became progressively less important with advancing age, and no such effect was found in the oldest age-group. Inverse results were observed for a tall stature (test for trend: p = 0.04): a tall stature increased the risk of breast cancer in the younger age-groups, and the figures suggested a reverse effect in the oldest group. No large variation with age was found for the effects of age at menarche, history of breast cancer death in mother or sisters, prior biopsy for benign breast disease, and weight. In conclusion, the relative importance of certain risk factors for breast cancer is closely related to age at diagnosis. Nulliparity and a late age at first birth appear to be major risk factors only for middle-aged women, whereas a low Quetelet index and a tall stature appear to increase the risk of breast cancer only for younger women.\r"

The cohort (n = 120, 852) of 55-69 year old men (48.2%) and women (51.8%) originates from 204 computerized municipal population registries. At baseline, participants completed a self-administered questionnaire on diet and potential confounding variables. In addition, about 67% of the participants provided toenail clippings. Cancer follow-up consists of record linkage to a pathology registry and to cancer registries. The initial interest is in stomach, colorectal, breast and lung tumors. A case-cohort approach is applied, in which detailed follow-up information of a random subcohort (n = 5000) provides an estimate of the person-time experience of the cohort. Exposure data of the subcohort will be combined with those of incident cases, yielding exposure-specific incidence rate ratios. The intraindividual variation in determinants is estimated by annually repeated measurements (n = 250) within the subcohort. The rationale, efficiency aspects and study characteristics are discussed.\r"

The KDQ is available in a 26-item version or as two parallel 13-item tests. Psychometric evaluations indicate that all versions show high levels of reliability. Initial validity tests are also promising. The KDQ is able to discriminate individuals well informed about kidney disease and its treatment from those who are not so well informed. It is also sensitive to the effects of an experimental education program and to ESRD-related knowledge that is acquired as a result of starting dialysis. Data and issues related to the administration, readability, demographic correlates, and a French translation of the KDQ are also presented and discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Information on the past medical history of the mothers of a population-based series of 177 children with soft tissue sarcoma was obtained by interview and from medical records. Eight mothers developed breast cancer, six premenopausally, compared with 3.26 expected (P = .04), but no excess of other types of cancers was detected. High breast cancer risk was associated with the following factors in the index child: age at diagnosis less than 24 months (relative risk [RR], 7.84), embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (RR, 3.74), and male sex (RR, 3.02). Characteristics in the mother associated with high breast cancer risk were the following: late age at first birth (RR, 5.13), late age at birth of index child (RR, 5.69), and high birth-rank order of index child (RR, 4.08). The results suggest there may be a subset of childhood soft tissue sarcoma with a predominantly genetic etiology. The association between premenopausal breast cancer in the mother, late age at birth of index child, and early onset of soft tissue sarcoma in the index child suggests that these three events are not independent and that interactions between genetic and other factors may be important. The identification of a group of women at high risk for breast cancer affords an opportunity for screening and early detection. The study of cancer family syndromes may provide insights into underlying mechanisms in cancer genetics.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of patient age on risk of recurrence in the breast was retrospectively studied in 496 stage I-II invasive ductal carcinomas treated by macroscopically complete primary tumor excision followed by radiotherapy. With a median follow-up of 71 months, local recurrence occurred in 13 of 62 (21%) patients younger than 40 years, compared with 48 of 434 (11%) older patients (P less than .025). Cox multivariate analysis of 18 parameters identified four that significantly determined risk: major lymphocytic stromal reaction (MCR), unsatisfactory resection margins, increasing histologic grade, and extensive intraductal cancer (DCIS) within the primary tumor. Compared with older patients, those younger than 40 years had tumors that more often exhibited MCR (36% v 20%, P less than .01), histologic grade 3 (42% v 28%, P less than .025), and very extensive DCIS (21% v 6%, P less than .001). The status of resection margins did not differ significantly between younger and older patients. Restriction of Cox analysis to patients younger than 40 indicated that risk was adequately described by MCR and percentage of DCIS, without consideration of grade or margins. For patients younger than 40, local failure occurred in four of five (80%) tumors with both MCR and more than 50% DCIS, in eight of 25 (32%) with either, and one of 32 (3.1%) with neither of these morphologic features. This study suggests that the higher local failure risk observed in patients younger than 40 years reflects the greater prevalence of certain morphologic characteristics in breast cancers in younger patients. Age itself does not appear to be an independent determinate of risk.\r"

  ".W": "Small noncleaved cell lymphoma (SNCCL), a rare lymphoma in adults, is associated with not only a rapid complete response (CR) to chemotherapy but also with the potential to rapidly relapse both systemically and in the CNS. We treated 44 assessable adults with two similar protocols, consisting of three sequential chemotherapy combinations and intrathecal prophylaxis with methotrexate and cytarabine. The overall CR rate was 80%; it was 100% in patients with Ann Arbor (AA) stages I-III disease and 57% in those with stage IV disease. The overall survival (OS) rate at 5 years was 52%. The overall 5-year freedom from tumor mortality (FTM) rate was 63%; it was 95% for patients with AA stages I-III disease, and 29% for those with stage IV disease. Stepwise multivariate analysis of factors associated with remission duration and survival indicated that advanced-disease stage and age of 40 years or over were predictors of poor prognosis. Twelve patients with positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serology were also included in this series. They had an 83% CR rate and an 83% 5-year FTM, but only a 36% 5-year OS; most deaths were secondary to opportunistic infection. Histologic subtype (Burkitt's lymphoma [BL] or non-Burkitt's lymphoma [NBL]) did not correlate with patient age, site of tumor presentation, response to therapy, or survival. Both protocols achieved comparable results. The approach used in these protocols is highly effective for patients with early staged disease, regardless of their HIV status; however, better therapy is necessary for those with SNCCL presenting in an advanced stage.\r"

Factors analyzed included initial stage, age, time to first relapse, histology, sex, extent of initial irradiation, sites of relapse, relapse stage (RS), average relative dose intensity (ARDI) of chemotherapy, and type of salvage therapy. Ninety-three percent of the patients received either standard or modified mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP). With a median follow-up of 8.3 years, the actuarial survival and freedom from second relapse (FF2ndR) was 57% at 10 years. The extent of disease at the time of relapse, or so-called RS was found to be the single most important prognostic factor. Nearly 90% of patients with RS IA or IEA (favorable group) were disease free, and nearly 60% of patients with RS IIA, IIEA, or IIIA (intermediate group) were disease free compared with only 34% of patients with B symptoms or stage IV disease (unfavorable group). In a subset analysis, the use of combined modality therapy (CMT) was associated with an improved FF2ndR and survival in patients from the intermediate and unfavorable relapse groups. Age greater than 50 years was associated with an increased risk of second relapse and a lower survival. The other factors analyzed appeared to be of no independent prognostic value.\r"

Five patients were grafted in first partial remission (PR) after conventional therapy; all achieved CR, and all remain in prolonged CR (first CR for four patients, second CR for one patient). Of 21 patients with chemosensitive relapses, 13 patients are in prolonged unmaintained CR 8 to 94 months after ABMT. Eight patients with resistant disease remained uncured by ABMT; all eight died, six from progressive illness and two from toxicity. The current 3-year disease-free probability is 60% for all patients, 0% for refractory disease; 82% for first PR or CR, and 60% for sensitive relapses (SRs).

Twenty-eight of the 101 patients survive, 18 of whom are disease-free for a median of 26 (range, 12 to 66) months. The 5-year actuarial probabilities of survival, event-free survival (EFS), and relapse from transplantation were 20%, 11%, and 84%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that the likelihood of EFS was decreased among patients transplanted with a Karnofsky score of less than 80%. Recurrent lymphoma after transplant was the most important cause of treatment failure with 36 of 62 relapses occurring within 100 days from marrow infusion. Early, but not late relapse, was more frequent in patients transplanted for advanced lymphoma, and both early and late relapses were increased among patients with impaired pretransplant clinical performance or high-grade histology of lymphoma. Ten patients who relapsed post-transplant are alive, seven in remission. Further improvement of these results will require earlier transplantation, improved preparative regimens, or early posttransplant therapy.\r"

However, the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of these agents when used in combination has not been systematically explored. We treated 58 patients (28 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [NHL], 30 with Hodgkin's disease [HD]) at seven dose levels of CBV. Doses were cyclophosphamide 4,500 to 7,200 mg/m2, BCNU 450 to 600 g/m2, and VP-16 1,200 to 2,000 mg/m2. The MTD was cyclophosphamide 7,200 mg/m2, BCNU 450 mg/m2, and VP-16 2,000 mg/m2. Six hundred milligrams per square meter of BCNU was associated with five of 18 cases of interstitial pneumonitis versus two of 40 at 450 mg/m2 (P = .02). Treatment-related mortality was 5% at dose levels less than or equal to the MTD and 22% at the highest dose. In this heavily pretreated patient population, most of whom had high volume residual disease, complete responses (CRs) to CBV and ABMT occurred in 25% of assessable patients with NHL and 43% of patients with HD. Thirteen of 28 patients with NHL and 14 of 30 with HD remain free from disease progression with median follow-up of 212 and 215 days, respectively. CBV can be administered with acceptable toxicity over a wide range of doses to patients with refractory and relapsed lymphoma.\r"

Twelve patients had B-cell, 12 T-cell, and one non-T, non-B-cell lymphoma; according to Murphy's staging system, 15 had stage III and nine stage IV disease with bone marrow involvement at diagnosis. All had previously received ARA-C by push or continuous infusion. Two patients had received epipodophyllotoxins. At the time of the study, three children had initial refractory disease, 18 were in first relapse (14 on therapy), two in first refractory relapse, and two in second relapse (on therapy). The overall response rate (RR) was 60%: eight complete responses (CRs), seven partial responses (PRs) (two became CRs after a second course). The RR was 66% (four CRs plus four PRs) in B-cell and 54% (four CRs, three PRs) in non-B-cell NHL. It was 20% (one PR per five patients) in initial or relapsed refractory disease. In four patients with measurable CNS disease, there were three CRs. Duration of response was nonassessable since all the responding patients received high-dose polychemotherapy followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) (five are alive with long follow-up [FU]). Toxicity was marked mostly by pancytopenia for 2 weeks, and half the patients encountered a grade-3 infection. One severe diarrhea was observed. In conclusion, high-dose ARA-C (HD-ARA-C) and VP 16 are an effective regimen in relapsed NHL, especially with CNS disease, and its toxicity is acceptable with regards to the prognosis of the disease.\r"

Data obtained at diagnosis for 251 neuroblastoma patients from two Childrens Cancer Study Group (CCSG) studies were analyzed according to staging systems of the CCSG, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG), and the Union Internationale Contre le Cancer (UICC) tumor-nodes-metastasis (TNM) system. The most significant variables were found to be age, tumor stage, extent of tumor removal, transgression of the midline by tumor infiltration, and site of primary tumor. Involvement of lymph nodes per se was not a bad prognostic sign unless associated with extension beyond the midline, the latter being the single most important prognostic variable. All four staging systems had value for prognostication and all identified with accuracy the low stage patient (stage I, stage A) who fares well (greater than or equal to 87% survival). The CCSG definition of stages II and III disease discriminated prognostic groups best among the remaining patients, and was able to identify the child with local-regional NBL with poor survival. The estimated 5-year survival rates for children with regional tumor (stage III, IIIA[N]), according to the four systems were 44%, 74%, 74%, and 74% for the CCSG, St Jude, POG, and UICC methods, respectively. We conclude that all four staging systems effectively define good-prognosis patients with localized disease but that the CCSG staging system most accurately identifies patients with regional tumor who have a poor outcome.\r"

All four patients with clinically measurable disease had a complete response. All four patients who underwent second-look laparotomy had negative findings. Twenty-five patients (96%) remain in sustained remission 10.4 to 54.4 months from the start of chemotherapy. One patient died of progressive disease 14 months after beginning chemotherapy. We conclude that the BEP regimen has excellent activity and acceptable toxicity in patients with malignant ovarian germ cell tumors.\r"

  ".W": "Fifteen patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) were treated with deoxycoformycin (pentostatin; dCF) (4 mg/m2 intravenous [IV] every week x 3) and recombinant interferon-alpha 2a (rIFN-alpha 2a) (3 x 10(6) units subcutaneously [SC] daily x 4 weeks) in alternating months for a total of 14 months. Eleven patients had undergone splenectomy; four had received prior systemic therapy with chlorambucil and/or steroids. All 15 are evaluable for toxicity and peripheral blood response, while 14 are assessable for bone marrow response. Toxicity was tolerable with grade 3 or 4 nausea and vomiting in three patients, neutropenic fevers in five, transient but significant depression in eight, and localized cutaneous herpes zoster in four. Circulating hairy cells were undetectable by the end of the first month in 10 of 13 patients, and by the end of the second month in the other three. Fourteen patients had bilateral bone marrow biopsies performed at baseline after 6 months of treatment, at the end of treatment (14 months), and at 6-month intervals during follow-up. Before treatment, all patients had hypercellular marrows with hairy cels replacing normal marrow elements; all showed at least a 95% clearing of their hairy cell infiltrate by 6 months of therapy. However, small collections of residual hairy cells could be detected intermittently on at least one side of bilateral samples in all patients. All patients have completed treatment with a median duration of follow-up off therapy of 27 months (range, 15 to 31 months). To date, all peripheral counts and serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL2R) levels remain stable, and no patient has had progression of the hairy cell infiltrate in the bone marrow. Although no patient achieved a pathologic complete response, alternating monthly cycles of dCF and rIFN-alpha 2a produced durable partial remissions (PRs) in all patients. Continued follow-up is required to determine the length of such remissions.\r"

This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of ondansetron in three consecutive nonrandomized groups of patients who were receiving a 4- or 5-day regimen of cisplatin (20 to 40 mg/m2/d) combination chemotherapy. Thirty-six patients were enrolled. Thirty-five patients were assessable for efficacy. All patients received three daily intravenous doses of 0.15 mg/kg of ondansetron. Twenty-four patients had received no prior chemotherapy. Twelve of these received ondansetron every 2 hours and 12 received ondansetron every 6 hours. Twelve additional patients who had received at least one prior course of chemotherapy were administered ondansetron every 6 hours. All patients were monitored for emetic episodes (vomiting or retching), adverse events, and laboratory safety parameters. Ten patients (29%) had no vomiting or retching throughout the entire study period and 18 patients (51%) experienced two or fewer emetic episodes during the entire study period. The greatest antiemetic efficacy was on day 1 when 27 patients (77%) had no emesis. The chemotherapy-naive patients responded better than the nonnaive patients on all study days. Reported adverse events were minor, with the most common possibly drug-related event being headache (14% of patients). No extrapyramidal symptoms were observed. Transient increases in total SGOT, and SGPT were observed in some patients.\r"

Forty-four children with neuroblastoma underwent both [123I] MIBG and 99mTc-MDP scans within a 4-wk period; bone marrow examination also was performed; all these investigations were done both at diagnosis and at follow-up. At diagnosis, four children with Stage 4 disease had normal [123I]MIBG scans but abnormal 99mTc-MDP scans, while at follow-up there were four children with negative [123I]MIBG studies who later died from disseminated neuroblastoma. All eight scans are considered false-negative. In 24 children, the [123I]MIBG revealed more extensive disease with 161 positive sites while the 99mTc-MDP scan showed only 100 positive sites; 34 of these sites were common to both studies. This study shows that underassessment of skeletal involvement by neuroblastoma occurred using [123I]MIBG scans and that one cannot therefore substitute [123I]MIBG for 99mTc-MDP bone scans in the staging of neuroblastoma.\r"

Of 20 patients with known metastatic disease, planar 201Tl images were positive in 12 (60%) but SPECT revealed an additional 5 (25%) who had metastases (total 85%). SPECT revealed foci as small as 1.0 cm in the neck and 1.5 cm in the lungs, and was particularly useful in detection of disseminated micronodular pulmonary metastases, especially in patients whose scans were negative with diagnostic doses of 131I. Some pitfalls in interpretation of the tomographic reconstructions were found. Thallium-201 SPECT is a marked improvement over planar imaging in the detection of metastases of differentiated thyroid cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Nitrogen-13- ([13N]) ammonia is a widely used tracer for PET myocardial blood flow studies. Quantification of blood flow using tracer kinetic principles requires accurate determination of [13N]ammonia activity in blood. Since [13N] ammonia is rapidly metabolized, the arterial input function may be contaminated by labeled metabolites. We, therefore, characterized the 13N-labeled metabolites in blood after intravenous (i.v.) injection of 20 mCi [13N]ammonia in nine healthy volunteers. Utilizing a series of ion exchange resins, 13N-labeled compounds were separated into four groups: ammonia, neutral amino acids, acidic amino acids, and urea. Analysis of the metabolic fate of [13N]ammonia indicates that over 90% of the blood activity within the first two minutes after injection is present as [13N]ammonia. However, there is considerable contamination of the blood activity at 3-5 min by [13N]glutamine (amide) and urea, which collectively represent 18%-50% of the blood activity. Thus, correction of the arterial input function for 13N-metabolites is required to accurately quantify the arterial input function of [13N]ammonia in myocardial blood flow studies.\r"

The assumption for the proposed algorithm is that, according to the partial volume effect, the recovery counts by the instrumentation is a function of the object size. Systo-diastolic changes in the detected radioactivity would therefore reflect changes in myocardial wall thickness. Ten normal volunteers were studied in control condition by 99mTc 2-methoxy-isobutyl-isonitrile scintigraphy. Electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated images were acquired in multiple projections. End-diastolic and end-systolic activity was measured along radii from the center to the edge of the left ventricle. Data are displayed as circumferential profiles and the percent systolic thickening determined according to the formula (end-systolic profile--end-diastolic profile) (end-diastolic profile + background) x 100.) The intra- and interobserver variabilities were +/- 5.4% and +/- 4.1%, respectively. Analysis of regional systolic thickening showed a heterogeneous pattern, with a maximal and minimum value of 35% and 27% located to the infero-apical and to the proximal anterior wall, respectively. Our values correlate well with those reported for normals using cine computed tomography or nuclear magnetic resonance.\r"

Three-dimensional images of cylindrical test-objects containing either 99mTc (140 keV) or 137Cs (662 keV) are reported. Electronically collimated counts were acquired from the objects rotated to 20 or 40 angular positions in front of the germanium detector to simulate a cylindrical scanning system. For comparison, mechanically collimated data were also acquired from the test-objects. The SPECT images show a slightly better resolution for mechanical over electronical collimation (1.3 +/- 0.25 cm mechanical, 1.5 +/- 0.25 cm electronical at 140 keV; 1.5 +/- 0.25 cm mechanical, 1.7 +/- 0.25 cm electronical at 662 keV). The equi-resolution sensitivity, however, was deduced to be approximately an order of magnitude higher with electronic collimation to image a head-sized object using 99mTc. In addition, the sensitivity gain increases with increasing energy, suggesting the unique potential of electronic collimation in high-energy SPECT.\r"

In female rats, metabolism of this ligand proceeds without significant P-450-mediated oxidation of the N-fluoroalkyl side chain, while in male rats, this is the dominant metabolic pathway. In biodistribution experiments, striatal uptake of this ligand is higher in female than in male rats, but no difference in cerebellar uptake is observed. In male rats, no metabolites of [18F]FPND are produced that cross the blood-brain barrier. In contrast, female rats produce a metabolite that both crosses the blood-brain barrier and exhibits opioid receptor-specific binding superior to that of the parent compound. These studies demonstrate that the possibility of sex-dependent metabolism must be considered when the rat is employed to screen new radiopharmaceuticals.\r"

In biodistribution and imaging studies in athymic mice with human melanoma (FEMX-II) xenografts the high immunoreactivity preparation rapidly cleared from the blood and nontumor organs while retention of radioactivity in the tumor was prolonged. The low immunoreactivity preparation, had slower blood and nontumor organ clearance but faster tumor clearance than the high immunoreactivity fraction.

Each animal was injected intravenously with 0.5 mCi of 111In-SCN-DTPA AM-Fab preparations (Prep 1 [n = 5] and 2 [n = 4]). The biodistribution was compared to that of 111In-labeled conventional bicyclic anhydride DTPA-AM-Fab (n = 5). 111In-SCN-DTPA AM-Fab Prep 1 (lowest specific activity) showed highest specific target localization (31.6 +/- 3.5, MEAN infarct[0-20% Tl-201] to normal ration +/- SE) and lowest hepatic sequestration (0.0108 +/- 0.002% ID/g). Prep 2 showed similar infarct localization (18.4 +/- 1.2) to control 111In-DTPA AM-Fab (16.9 +/- 1.1), but had higher hepatic activity (0.0326 +/- 0.014 and 0.0267 +/- 0.006 respectively). This difference in in vivo localization occurred despite the lack of changes in in vitro immunoreactivities of the AM-Fab preparations. The enhanced target localization with minimal hepatic activity may permit a more sensitive diagnostic application of 111In-labeled AM-Fab in future clinical studies.\r"

The planar images obtained during life showed abnormal 111In-antimyosin uptake in the posterior, lateral, and apical walls of the left ventricle. Autopsy revealed extensive infarction of the left ventricular lateral and posterior walls with cardiac rupture, which was the cause of sudden death. Direct imaging of the sliced specimen of heart revealed abnormal tracer uptake in the lateral and posterior walls of the left ventricle, which correlated closely with the area of necrosis outlined by TTC staining. Our results confirm the experimental findings that antimyosin antibody binds specifically to the acute irreversibly damaged myocardial cells.

A pregnant patient studied with [99mTc] HM-PAO to confirm brain death provided an opportunity to examine the transplacental distribution of this radio-pharmaceutical in the unborn fetus. Uptake in the fetus after transplacental delivery is almost exclusively hepatic with a small amount of biliary excretion.\r"

Scintigraphy also revealed unknown metastatic lesions of the paraaortic lymph nodes, which were later confirmed on x-ray CT. Iodine-123-IMP may have a potential role in evaluating carcinoid tumors.\r"

  ".U": "90188518\r", 
  ".W": "The gel formation by endotoxin with limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) solution requires the presence of free calcium ions. The chelating agents and radiopharmaceuticals prepared from the chelating agents always reduce the available free calcium levels present in the kits used for the testing of apyrogenicity and thus inhibit gel formation of LAL with E. Coli endotoxin (ET). This inhibition of gel formation could be reversed by the addition of excess free calcium ions or the excessive dilution of radiopharmaceuticals and chelating agents. The tests of positive control (0.2 ml ET units and LAL), inhibition control (0.1 ml sample, 0.1 ml ET and LAL), and negative control (0.1 ml sterile saline and LAL) were carried out with the fresh preparation (0.1 ml) of samples (triplicate), tropolone, ACD anticoagulant, and 99mTc-labeled radiopharmaceuticals. In the Ca-supplemented tests, 0.1 ml of 60 mM sterile calcium chloride solution was added to the test solutions and incubated for 60 min at 37 degrees centigrade. The results of gel formation (+ve and -ve) and normalization of inhibition control tests with Ca-supplement indicate that commercial LAL kits need extra calcium ions for the correct testing of the apyrogenicity of chelate-containing radiopharmaceuticals and chelating agents.\r"

The authors conclude that although it has some limitations, the Co-worker Model allowed patient beds to remain open while minimally affecting quality.\r"

However, clear definitions of clinical and satisfaction outcomes, nursing responsibilities that contribute to those outcomes, and reasonable time targets for staff contributions can help nurses at all levels analyze and prioritize work load to build new or update existing acuity systems. The author describes specific methods nurse executives and managers can use to involve and guide staff members in (1) determining realistic and compatible standards of care, performance, and resource productivity, (2) integrating quality-based time standards into acuity systems, and (3) using acuity information to manage delivery of a targeted, desired level of ongoing quality care.\r"

The authors determined how nurses spend their time and suggest three ways to reduce time spent on non-essential nursing functions: delegation of some tasks to support personnel, greater use of pharmacy personnel in a decentralized setting, and greater use of computers. Together these changes may both decrease demand for nurses' time and enable professional nurses to focus their energy on tasks that require professional expertise.\r"
