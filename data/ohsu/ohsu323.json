The normal mouse sublingual glands are mucus-secreting and virtually all the acinar cells differentiate to mucus-rich cells by the day of birth. In contrast, all endpieces of newborn mutant mice consisted of acini of immature cuboidal cells. However, normal mucous cells, staining intensively with mucin-specific stains such as Alcian blue at pH 2.5 or mucicarmine, appeared in the mutant mice from an early age singly or in groups in a small number of acini, and their number apparently increased with age to occupy over 30% of the total acinar cells. Ultrastructurally, irregular secretion granules of varying electron-density, distinct from ordinary sublingual mucin granules, were frequently observed in the cytoplasm of the immature acinar cells in the mutant phenotype. The genetic analysis showed that a single autosomal recessive gene determined the observed abnormality. This is the first salivary gland mutation and will provide a critical model for the study of salivary mucous cell differentiation.\r"

The results were analyzed with a computerized system of image analysis referred to as SAMBA and correlated with binding assays (DCC), and with standard histopathologic findings. It was shown that there was a correlation between 1) the PR-ICA and the binding assays (91.5%), and 2) between the binding assays and the multiparametric computerized (SAMBA) analysis of the PR-ICA. It was also shown that SAMBA provides an accurate, reliable, and reproducible evaluation of PR-ICA that is complementary to binding assays and constitutes a standardized method of evaluating the heterogeneity of the progesterone receptor (PR) distribution in tumors. It is concluded that SAMBA analysis of both the PR-ICA and estrogen receptor (ER-ICA) should improve the prognostic evaluation and the prediction of responsiveness to endocrine therapy in breast carcinomas.\r"

  ".W": "Isolated myocytes can be established as a valid model for studying changes in cytoskeletal proteins during the development of irreversible injury only if isolated cells develop lesions similar to those that occur during irreversible injury to intact hearts, specifically osmotic fragility and subsarcolemmal blebs. In the first experiment, isolated cells were irreversibly injured by metabolic inhibition with 5 mM Iodoacetic acid (IAA) and 6 mM amobarbital (Amy). Osmotic fragility of control and injured cells was determined by comparing the rates of development of trypan blue permeability during 60 minutes of isotonic or hypotonic (50% reduction in osmolality) incubations. Cell morphology was monitored by light and electron microscopy. Control cells remained elongated and excluded trypan blue. Metabolically inhibited cells rapidly contracted to a nearly square shape. The inhibited squared cells initially excluded trypan blue, but during 60 minutes of incubation became permeable to trypan blue. Cells in hypotonic buffer developed blue staining at a more rapid rate than cells in isotonic buffer, indicating increased osmotic fragility. In a second experiment, control and inhibited cells were first incubated for 25 minutes in isotonic buffer and then in either isotonic or hypotonic buffer. In this experiment, inhibited cells also developed more extensive and rapid permeability increases when transferred to the hypotonic buffer than cells maintained in the isotonic buffer. In both experiments, increased permeability of cells to trypan blue was accompanied by formation of subsarcolemmal blebs along the lateral cell border and at the intercalated disks. The results show that metabolically inhibited, isolated myocytes do exhibit morphologic lesions and increased osmotic fragility properties similar to those reported during anoxic or ischemic injury to intact hearts. Therefore, isolated myocytes may be a useful model with which to study cytoskeletal-sarcolemmal membrane changes during development of irreversible injury.\r"

  ".W": "A series of 51 islet cell tumors removed from 28 patients was investigated immunohistochemically with the monoclonal antibody HISL-19. The antibody was produced after immunization of BALB/c mice with human islet cells and was found to react with a wide range of neuroendocrine and neural cells. All tumors presented positive immunoreaction showing various combinations of 2 basic patterns. The first pattern reflected the immunostaining of the secretory granules of the tumor cells. This \"granular\" staining was predominantly associated with benign neoplasms and with the tumoral production of glucagon and pancreatic polypeptide (PP), while it was absent or inconsistent in most insulin-secreting tumors. The second pattern consisted of focal immunoreactive aggregates located in a peri- (and, in polarized cells, supra-) nuclear position. This \"cluster-type\" staining showed a good morphologic and topographic correspondence with the Golgi apparatus of the cells of the same tumors, as shown by electron microscopy. The latter pattern was well represented in all types of islet cell tumors except those producing PP. Moreover, it was more apparent in less differentiated tumors in which the granular pattern was often absent or inconsistent. Cluster-type (but not granular) immunoreactivity was frequently found in some nonendocrine, nontumoral pancreatic structures, particularly in the epithelium of small ducts. However, the immunoreactive aggregates of nonendocrine cells were distinctly less prominent than those of endocrine cells. On the basis of a comparison with other immunohistochemical markers for neuroendocrine cells, it is concluded that the HISL-19 monoclonal antibody presents specific staining characteristics useful for the cytologic analysis of islet cell tumors.\r"

This network, which can be specifically decorated with type IV collagen antibody, is formed in great part by the lateral joining of narrow filaments (2.7 nm average metal coated diameter) to form a complex three-dimensional irregular polygonal array of variable diameter branching strands. Globular domains, similar to the C-terminal globular domains of purified type IV dimers, can be identified in the network. In many regions of the network the filaments appear to twist around each other along the strand axis. The network is similar to that visualized in the human amnion as well as to a reconstituted network formed in vitro. These data strongly suggest that the laterally and end-domain-associated network is a widespread supramolecular architecture of type IV collagen in basement membranes.\r"

TBM antigen prepared from mice of 3 inbred strains--BALB/c, C3H/He, and C57BL/6--and outbred ddY mice possessed both antigenicity and nephritogenecity. Using these TBM antigens, the roles of humoral and cellular immunity in the development of interstitial nephritis (IN) and the genetic control of the induction of IN in inbred mice were investigated. BALB/c mice were highly susceptible to IN and showed a high antibody response and a high lymphocyte proliferative response to syngeneic and allogeneic TBM antigen, whereas C57BL/6 mice did not. C3H/He mice, in which minimal interstitial lesions developed, showed a high antibody response but a low proliferative response of T cells to TBM antigen. TBM antigen sensitized T cells induced interstitial lesions, but anti-TBM antisera did not do so. Thus, the development of IN seemed to be related closely to cellular immunity. Further studies with their hybrids, backcrosses, congenic mice, and recombinant mice suggested that the induction of IN and the immune response to TBM antigen are controlled by 1 or a few dominant genes, whose loci are within, or closely linked to, the H-2 complex.\r"

The parameters studied were size of lumen, estimated as percentage of vessel cross-section, vs. the age of subject and the grades of chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate, of neovascularization, of intimal haemorrhage, and of pultaceous cholesterol-rich deposit in the wall. Genstat statistical analysis revealed that the significant explanatory variables for the reduction in arterial lumen were active inflammation and cardiac cause of death. Neither age nor cholesterol-rich deposits had significant explanatory power. A pathogenic role for inflammation may well be possible and efforts will be made in the future to investigate its etiology.\r"

  ".W": "Exposure of adult rats to 3 ppm ozone for 8 hours results in diffuse alveolar damage with well-defined sequential stages of bronchiolo-alveolar injury and repair. This model is characterized by acute pulmonary edema showing high concentration of lavage fluid protein that is maximally elevated at 24 hours with return to control level at recovery (96 hours). Using techniques that enable optimal preservation of lamellar body ultrastructure, it was demonstrated morphometrically that expansion of the vacuolated lamellar body (LB) compartment is an early, transient LB response of the type II cell to acute injury. This change appears to be initiated by increased LB secretion. The reparative stage, 24-48 hours postexposure, begins with hypertrophy rather than hyperplasia of many type II cells, resulting in a 3-fold increase of mean type II cell volume at 48 hours. During this stage there is also significant expansion of the total LB compartment with corresponding increased LB storage of surfactant disaturated phosphatidylcholine (DSPC) per type II cell. At recovery, 96 hours, the lungs contained twice the normal numbers of type II cells, but the total size of lamellar body compartment per type II cell as well as the DSPC content of the isolated lamellar body pool returned to normal levels. In contrast, accumulating surfactant DSPC in lavage fluid increased progressively throughout the reparative and recovery stages presumably due in part to parallel increase in type II cell numbers at 48 and 96 hours. Additional changes of surfactant included abnormal secretion of densely coiled lamellar bodies that accumulated in alveolar spaces at the expense of tubular myelin. These observations indicate that acute oxidant injury to alveoli initiates progressive hypertrophy followed by hyperplasia of type II cells, in association with sequential development of characteristic lamellar body changes leading to increased storage and secretion of surfactant with reduced ability to form tubular myelin.\r"

The present study reports substantial expression of this Mr 43,000 protein in human decidua and carcinoma. Metabolic labeling of human decidua tissue in organ culture demonstrated significant osteonectin biosynthesis. Further, Northern analysis and in situ hybridization showed that the osteonectin mRNA level in human decidua is very high. Immunohistochemically, the large mature decidual cells exhibited faint cytoplasmic immunoreactivity with antibodies to osteonectin and a distinct immunoreactivity of the newly deposited basement membranes encircling these cells. The intermediate-sized decidual cells exhibited a strong cytoplasmic immunostaining with antibodies to osteonectin. The small elongated stromal cells were devoid of osteonectin immunoreactivity. Blood vessels exhibited variable positive immunoreactivity. The osteonectin expression in 38 cases of human carcinomas was examined. In well-differentiated carcinomas osteonectin immunoreactivity was located in the basement membrane area, codistributing with laminin. Cytoplasmic osteonectin immunoreactivity was found in poorly differentiated carcinomas. Stromal cells in the peritumoral tissue and some vessels were immunoreactive. Using in situ hybridization, it appeared that both the tumor cells and the stromal cells contained osteonectin transcripts. In normal steady state human nonosseus tissues investigated, osteonectin was found inconsistently in the basement membranes only, as based on the present immunohistochemical technique. These results suggest that the osteonectin/SPARC gene appears activated in certain human tissues characterized by de novo formation of basement membrane.\r"

  ".W": "It has been established previously that when inserted in the blastocyst E Ca 247 preferentially differentiates into trophectoderm in vitro. If the concept that tumors are caricatures of the process of tissue renewal is correct, then some cells from the inner cell mass (ICM), the normal counterpart of embryonal carcinoma, should be able to differentiate into trophectoderm. This has been a controversial issue. Four experiments are now reported that support the idea that ICM can differentiate into trophectoderm: 1) ICM from early blastocysts after classical immunosurgery made blastocysts in vitro; 2) ICM obtained from early blastocysts by immunosurgery using antigens other than histocompatibility ones made blastocysts in vitro; 3) ICM from early blastocysts, in which the trophectodermal cells had been labeled, contained no labeled cells following immunosurgery; and 4) In reconstruction experiments, polar and mural trophectodermal cells attached to ICM from late blastocysts failed to multiply and make blastocysts when cultured. It is concluded that like the embryonal carcinoma some ICM cells of early blastocysts have the potential to make trophectoderm. This fact is consistent with the concept that tumors are caricatures of the process of tissue renewal; and establishes E Ca 247 as a good model for study of trophectodermal differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this investigation was to determine the role of the humoral immune response in the production of arthritis in mice immunized with the chlamydial agent of mouse pneumonitis (MoPn) (Chlamydia trachomatis biovar). Mice were made B cell deficient (BCD) by treatment with rabbit antiserum to murine IgM. Control mice included animals treated similarly with normal rabbit serum or phosphate-buffered saline. Male mice were immunized with MoPn inactivated with ultraviolet irradiation while female mice were immunized by genital tract infection with viable chlamydiae. Arthritis was elicited in all mice by intra-articular inoculation of inactivated MoPn. When knee joints were examined for pathologic changes at varying times after challenge, a marked enhancement of the arthritis was observed in both male and female BCD mice when compared with controls at all time points. These data indicated that the humoral immune response is not essential for the production of arthritic disease in this model but may have some role in the modulation of the process in immunologically intact animals. Persistence of chlamydial antigen in joint tissue of BCD mice suggested that antibody may play a role in the elimination of antigen, thus decreasing the stimulus for the development of cell-mediated immunologic injury. Regulatory role for T suppressor cells cannot be ruled out however, because B cell deficient mice have been shown to lack certain T suppressor cell subsets.\r"

In each diet group safflower oil was used as a control for fish oil. Monocyte adhesion to the thoracic aorta and intimal foam cell formation were used to measure the extent of atherosclerotic lesion formation in each rat. Cholesterol and triglyceride levels were measured in both plasma and lipoprotein fractions. In normocholesterolemic rats, fish oil did not influence the morphology of the vessel wall. In moderately hypercholesterolemic rats, monocyte adhesion was the same irrespective of dietary oil, however, intimal foam cell formation was 2-fold higher in the fish oil-fed animals despite a reduction in serum cholesterol levels when compared to the safflower oil-fed animals. In severely hypercholesterolemic rats, monocyte adhesion to the vessel wall and intimal foam cell formation were both 4-fold higher in the fish oil compared with the safflower oil fed animals. These observations could not be attributed to differences in the plasma or lipoprotein profiles of safflower oil vs. fish oil fed rats. The results of this study suggest that dietary fish oil, when fed to hypercholesterolemic rats for a period of 2 weeks, enhances the rate of monocyte adhesion and fatty streak formation in the thoracic aorta.\r"

Residual scars remained, however, and the collagen tissue in them presented morphologic evidence of a slow, progressive degradation that lead to the almost complete disappearance of the lesions 4.5 months after chemotherapy. Ultrastructural changes indicative of collagen degradation were represented by focal lytic dissolution of collagen fibrils and/or by the transformation of such fibrils into a granular electron dense material, a picture different from that seen in more acute models of collagen resorption. In older, involuting granulomas, both type I and III collagens were found up to the end of the resorption process. The immunofluorescence staining for procollagen III and fibronectin correlated with collagen synthesis and the amount of both decreased as the granulomas involuted. Antibodies to CB-peptide (a2 CB3,5 from type I collagen) appeared as a good marker of acute collagen degradation only. Laminin and collagen type IV were absent from the granulomas. Periportal fibrosis produced in mice with 30 cercariae per 20 weeks of infection also presented progressive degradation of collagen 2 and 3 months following curative treatment of schistosomiasis. Present findings suggest that there is not an irreversible fibrotic stage in murine schistosomiasis, that chronic collagen resorption presents peculiar ultrastructural features, that the genetic collagen types are not differentially removed, and that periportal fibrosis in schistosomiasis undergo degradation in a way after specific treatment similar to periovular granulomas.\r"

A total of 19 deer were shot in two Lyme disease foci in Massachusetts during September 1986, the season in which larvae were most abundant. An average of 342 larval ticks of this species were collected from each deer. Of those that developed to the nymphal stage, the gut contents of 185 were examined for Borrelia burgdorferi by a direct fluorescent antibody test. Spirochetes were detected in about 1% of these nymphs, a rate of infection attributable to transovarial transmission. In contrast, infection was detected in 23% of 39 field-swept nymphal ticks of the same cohort that were collected during the following season. Although deer may be infested by numerous larval I. dammini, such ticks appear not to become infected by Lyme disease spirochetes.\r"

  ".W": "From May 1983 to January 1984, 517 patients with laboratory confirmed dengue were studied at a hospital in Manila. Secondary dengue infections were diagnosed in 78% of these cases. Peak admission (28%) occurred towards the end of the rainy season in November. Most patients (78%) were less than 15 years old but only 3 were infants. Although some type of hemorrhagic finding occurred in 460 cases (89%), only 110 were classified as dengue hemorrhagic fever and the remainder as dengue fever with hemorrhagic manifestations. The clinical course was usually mild. Gastrointestinal bleeding was present in 65 cases, but only 2 patients developed shock. No fatalities occurred. Dengue 2 was the predominant serotype with 53 isolates, followed by dengue 1 with 48 isolates, dengue 3 with 39 isolates, and dengue 4 with only 8 isolates. Dengue 2 was the only serotype with more isolates from sera with a homologous HI antibody titer greater than 1:20 (57%) than from sera with a homologous HI titer less than or equal to 1:20 (43%). In contrast, most of the dengue 1 isolates (63%) were from sera with a homologous HI antibody titer less than 1:10, and this serotype was strongly associated with primary infections. This study shows that dengue infections remain an important cause of pediatric hospitalization in the Philippines; however, the occurrence of life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever as has been described in several other large urban areas of Southeast Asia appears to be rare.\r"

We investigated Sb levels in serum, liver, spleen, and skin of hamsters administered therapeutic dosages of Sb (600 and 300 mg Sb/kg). Single administration of Sb was more effective against hepatic parasites than dividing the same total dose into multiple administrations, which suggests that for elimination of hepatic parasites in vivo, peak Sb concentration is more important than total area-under-the-curve levels. Serum Sb declined with an initial half-life of 1 hr. Skin Sb levels (352 micrograms Sb/g 1 hr after 600 mg Sb/kg) were initially higher than liver levels (77 micrograms Sb/g) or splenic levels (156 micrograms Sb/g), but levels were comparable (7-24 micrograms Sb/g) in the three organs by 8 hr after dosing. The generally comparable levels of Sb in the skin and in the visceral organs support the present clinical practice of administering the same dosage of Sb for cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis.\r"

Slam-freezing at liquid nitrogen temperature followed by freeze-substitution and Spurr's medium embedment provides preservation of the internal structure of the Schistosoma mansoni egg shell, developing miracidium, and perimiracidial structures. The egg shell consists of the three previously described layers (outer microspinous, middle intermediately dense, and inner dense layers) with cribriform pores. A newly described layer (Reynolds' layer) develops subjacent the egg shell and is comprised of densely-packed branching filaments. A single layer of squamous cells (von Lichtenberg's envelope) closely adheres to Reynolds' layer. Between von Lichtenberg's envelope and the embryo is a space (Lehman's lacuna); this space is initially filled with electron-lucent fluid, but subsequently masses of granulofloccular material (Cheever bodies) develop; Cheever bodies are partially membrane bound. Epidermal plates differentiate from superficial cells of the embryonal cell mass, while epidermal ridges differentiate from cells just below the surface of the embryonal cell mass. The cytoplasmic layer (von Lichtenberg's envelope) interposed between the host extracellular fluid and the developing miracidia effect a barrier against a simple passive diffusion; this infers that complex macromolecules, such as schistosomal egg antigen, undergo active, and perhaps selective, transport in or out of the egg.\r"

Studies in Nigeria show that boreholes sited within a village and used exclusively for drinking water are most effective, while less accessible or malfunctioning boreholes have a less dramatic impact on prevalence. In contrast to the situation in villages served with boreholes, the prevalence of guinea worm in the unserved villages remained almost unchanged. The rapid benefits of protected rural water supplies and the decline of dracunculiasis, including the rise in school enrollment and fall in the rate of school absenteeism, are highlighted together with other socioeconomic benefits.\r"

Six were treated with ivermectin (200 micrograms/kg) on the day of inoculation, 6 were treated with ivermectin on day 28, and 6 were not treated. Monthly skin snips were taken for the next 30 months to detect patent infection. One of the chimpanzees treated with ivermectin on the day of infection developed a patent infection as did 4 of the 6 treated at day 28 and 4 of the 6 control animals. The results suggest that ivermectin may have a partial in vivo effect against the L3 of O. volvulus but has no effect against later larval stages of the parasite.\r"

  ".W": "Life expectancy after aneurysm surgery was analyzed for male patients over the age of 60 years with known risk factors classified by the Goldman cardiac risk index, which has previously been utilized for prediction of immediate perioperative risks of surgery and anesthesia. The preoperative risk factors, Goldman cardiac risk index, and long-term survival rates were tabulated for each of 96 male patients over the age of 60 years who had elective repair of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. Follow-up data of up to 14 years (mean 4.2 years) was entered into a SurvPak-PC biostatistical software program for construction of Kaplan-Meier survival curves and actuarial life tables to measure differences in survival between groups and for performance of nonparametric analysis (by log rank test) of the influence of preoperative risk factors. The operative mortality rate was 3.1 percent and the 5 year survival rate for the whole group was 61 percent, with a median survival of 8.7 years. Five year survival rates for patients in three age groups (60 to 70 years, 71 to 80 years, and greater than 80 years), when compared with age-matched populations, were 67 percent versus 88 percent, 50 percent versus 73 percent, and 35 percent versus 39 percent, respectively. Patients in Goldman class 1, 2, and 3 or 4 had 5 year survival rates of 79 percent, 53 percent, and 41 percent, respectively. Factors that adversely affected long-term survival were Goldman classes 3 or 4 (median survival 2.1 +/- 0.4 years, p = 0.001), cerebrovascular disease (median survival 1.9 +/- 0.6 years, p = 0.004), history of cardiac disease (median survival 3.2 +/- 0.6 years, p = 0.012), and creatinine concentration greater than 3 mg/100 ml (median survival 3.1 +/- 1.6 years, p = 0.034), whereas Goldman class 2 or the presence of hypertension, pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, and size of the aneurysm, although associated with a shortened length of survival, as independent variables did not reach statistical significance. A combination of any three of these risk factors, however, shortened the survival time markedly (median 1.9 +/- 0.7 years, p = 0.003). We believe that the Goldman cardiac risk index classification correlates with long-term survival in patients undergoing elective aortic surgery.\r"

Of 13 patients with ruptured aneurysms, 4 underwent repair through a midline transperitoneal approach (3 deaths) whereas the remaining 9 were repaired through the retroperitoneal exposure (1 death). Supraceliac aortic clamping through the same incision prior to aneurysm exposure maintained hemodynamic integrity. The remaining 16 patients with symptomatic aneurysms were all treated through the retroperitoneal exposure (3 deaths). In the retroperitoneal groups, the cause of death was cardiac in two patients, hypertensive stroke in one, and necrotizing pancreatitis in one. Morbidity consisted of prolonged intubation, respiratory distress syndrome, and thrombophlebitis in one patient each and acute tubular necrosis in two patients. We believe that the left retroperitoneal approach is a useful option in the emergent treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms.\r"

No case of ischemic limb loss occurred, although two repairs failed. Primary neural repair (n = 4) was possible only with simple laceration, but decompression of a tense hematoma led to prompt resolution of neuropraxia in nine patients. Secondary neural reconstruction was largely unsuccessful, and approximately 25 percent of our patients had serious chronic disability related to neural injury. In addition, two patients died as a consequence of numerous associated injuries.\r"

One hundred fifty-four (46 percent) of these patients had tube graft replacement of the aneurysm. Patients were selected for tube graft on the basis of physical, angiographic, and intraoperative examinations. There were 123 mean and 31 women, with a mean age of 68 years. Complete follow-up ranging from 1 to 168 months (mean 53 months) was obtained in 137 of the surviving patients (87 percent). Two patients required revision to a bifurcated graft; one for iliac stenosis and one for iliac thrombosis. No iliac aneurysms were seen and no other aortoiliac complications were evident. Five other patients required femoro-distal reconstruction for either occlusive disease (three patients) or aneurysmal disease (two patients) at the groin or below. Life table analysis showed a 5 year survival rate of 65 percent and a 7 year rate of 54 percent. Conclusions drawn from this study reconfirm that in carefully selected patients, tube graft replacement of abdominal aortic aneurysm is an enduring procedure with few complications developing due to progression of iliac occlusive or aneurysmal disease.\r"

During the 10 year period from 1977 to 1987, only 17 patients were subjected to this procedure at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. The nine men and eight women averaged 65.6 years in age and exhibited the usual precursors of arterial insufficiency: a history of smoking in 12 patients (71 percent), clinical coronary artery disease in 8 patients (47 percent), hypertension in 7 patients, diabetes mellitus in 6 patients, hyperlipidemia in 2 patients, and uremia in 1 patient. Four patients exhibited hemodynamic improvement after profundaplasty (ankle-brachial index increase of greater than 0.15). Four required amputation postoperatively, and a fifth exhibited hemodynamic failure 9 months postoperatively and required amputation. Two patients required subsequent femoral-to-peroneal bypass to improve distal arterial perfusion. One patient died after the procedure, for a 5.9 percent mortality rate. Thus, the fact that profundaplasty has proved disappointing in the treatment of severe arterial insufficiency deserves emphasis at this time.\r"

Urokinase was immobilized to PTFE using tridodecylmethyl-ammonium chloride as a surfactant. In this preliminary study, a success rate of 45 percent was observed for the immobilization of active urokinase to PTFE. A model is proposed wherein application of the graft to an in vivo system is discussed. The urokinase graft is expected to be most effective under conditions of reduced blood flow which otherwise might promote thrombogenesis. The systemic side effects of the immobilized urokinase are expected to be significantly less when compared with the side effects of urokinase infused for clot lysis. The model presented of the urokinase-bound graft suggests that development and further study of the graft will result in an improved PTFE vascular prosthesis.\r"

  ".W": "Infrapopliteal bypass in diabetic patients has been associated with lower rates of patency and limb salvage than in nondiabetic patients. We prospectively compared the patency and limb salvage rates of in situ tibial artery bypass in diabetic and nondiabetic patients. Of 681 in situ bypasses performed for limb salvage over a 7 year period, 387 (57 percent) were carried out in diabetic patients and 294 (43 percent), in nondiabetic patients. Indications for operation most commonly included gangrene or ulceration (74 percent of the diabetic group and 49 percent of the nondiabetic group). Otherwise, the two patient groups were similar. Cumulative patency rates at 1 and 5 years were similar (91 and 74 percent for diabetic patients and 90 and 76 percent for nondiabetic patients, respectively). Limb salvage rates were also not significantly different (96 and 86 percent at 1 and 5 years, respectively, for diabetic patients and 99 and 94 percent, respectively for nondiabetic patients). Despite the unfavorable pattern of atherosclerosis in diabetic patients, the results of tibial arterial reconstructions showed patency and limb salvage rates similar to those seen in nondiabetic patients.\r"

Prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential to achieve a good outcome, as illustrated in two of the five patients described herein. Pitfalls in diagnosis led to late recognition and therapy in three patients, with subsequent serious complications; namely, arteriovenous fistula, false aneurysm, and amputation. On the basis of this limited but poignant experience, we propose an outline of steps in management to help others avoid similar problems. If popliteal injury is suspected, we advise exploration immediately to avoid a potential limb-loss crisis. Heparin should be given as soon as diagnosis is made. A posterior incision in the knee crease, rather than the conventional medial approach, gives expedient exposure for precise repair. We also advise passing a no. 3 thrombectomy catheter distally to rule out or retrieve any clot that may have embolized. A completion angiogram is also helpful. Compartment pressure may be measured, but if any doubt exists, a three-compartment fasciotomy should be performed.\r"

  ".U": "88292580\r", 
  ".W": "We believe that midgraft stenosis due to intimal hyperplasia of the needle puncture zone is a clinically important cause of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) dialysis graft thrombosis. Our simple dialysis graft salvage technique employs conventional exploration through a venous end graftotomy, thrombectomy with a Fogarty catheter, and venous end revision as needed. Midgraft curettage is routinely performed with a Kevorkian-Younge endometrial biopsy curette. This instrument is readily available and has a box-shaped back-cutting tip ideal for thorough, safe curettage of the PTFE graft lumen. This technique results in both direct assessment and simultaneous treatment of the entire thrombosed dialysis graft. The patency rates of first salvage procedures of thrombosed PTFE dialysis grafts with and without adjunctive curettage were retrospectively compared. Patency of the curettage group was superior at 1 month (97 percent versus 71 percent) and 6 months (65 percent versus 36 percent), with ultimate crossing of the plotted curves at 10 months (p = 0.053 by Wilcoxon test). It is our strong clinical impression that premature rethrombosis of PTFE dialysis grafts after salvage procedures has been greatly reduced by midgraft curettage.\r"

  ".U": "88292581\r", 
  ".W": "An aggressive surgical approach is warranted in all patients with a salvageable weight-bearing pedal surface. Although patients with pedal sepsis (69 limbs) had a lower 30 day limb salvage rate and higher morbidity and mortality rates than those without sepsis (34 limbs), the long-term salvage rates of both groups by life table analysis were not statistically different and remained at the 70 percent level 3 years postoperatively. Peribypass amputation, debridement of the septic foot, or both should be carried out when deemed necessary to decrease the risk of septic complications after revascularization. Other risk factors such as diabetes or heart disease had no bearing on the short-term results of bypass in either the septic or nonseptic group. Autogenous saphenous vein is preferable to synthetic bypass material, especially in patients with ongoing infection. Lastly, even though the medical climate in 1988 must reflect the stark reality of economic restrictions imposed by third-party payors, optimal patient care remains our primary responsibility. We believe that long-term pedal salvage, as achieved by arterial reconstruction, aggressive wound management, and rehabilitation, attains this goal.\r"

  ".W": "Deep venous insufficiency secondary to deep valvular incompetence predominated over superficial venous insufficiency in an unselected patient population with advanced chronic venous insufficiency. Venous obstruction was uncommon (5 percent), suggesting that venous bypass surgery may have limited applicability in the management of chronic venous insufficiency. Although the majority of patients (72 percent) with stage III venous disease (ulcer) had deep venous insufficiency alone and would be potential candidates for deep valvular reconstruction, 13 percent were found to have superficial venous insufficiency alone, and the remaining 15 percent, deep venous insufficiency with a hemodynamically significant component of superficial venous insufficiency. These findings suggest that not all patients with stage III disease have altered hemodynamics on the basis of deep venous valvular incompetency. Although most stage III chronic venous insufficiency is secondary to altered deep venous hemodynamics, as demonstrated by shortened venous refill time, there is a significant group of patients with severe chronic venous insufficiency having superficial venous insufficiency alone or in combination with deep venous insufficiency (28 percent). Thus, it is imperative that those patients with superficial venous insufficiency be identified by a widely available and reproducible method, such as light reflection rheography, since they may respond to surgery of the superficial venous system alone.\r"

This study analyzes a recent 4 year experience with 18 cases of penetrating injury to the carotid artery to identify the factors influencing surgical decision-making, perioperative complications, and mortality. Sixteen patients with acute respiratory distress required emergent airway intubation. Three patients in hemorrhagic shock were brought directly to the operating room; the remaining 15 underwent emergency carotid arteriography. Three patients with multiple intramediastinal vascular injuries exsanguinated on the operating table before hemorrhage could be controlled. There were no deaths or neurologic complications in the 14 surviving patients who had an operation on the carotid artery, including 2 patients treated by internal carotid artery ligation. Early control of the airway was the most common initial requirement in this group of patients. Judicious use of preoperative arteriography was thought to facilitate the operative approach in selected patients. A flexible surgical approach to the damaged carotid artery is essential based on the patient's hemodynamic status, degree of neurologic impairment, and nature and extent of arterial damage.\r"

The American Society of Anesthesiologists' grade was found to be a useful predictor as to whether the urea and electrolyte measurement could be expected to be abnormal. It is suggested that American Society of Anesthesiologists' Grade I patients do not require routine urea and electrolyte measurements whilst those in grades 3, 4 and 5 and those on diuretics do.\r"

The geometric mean IgE in the control group was 41 IU/mL (range = 15 to 111 IU/mL) and in the atopic group 142 IU/mL (range = 36 to 556 IU/mL). The highest values were found in patients with asthma plus allergic rhinitis plus atopic dermatitis and asthma plus atopic dermatitis. The lowest values were from patients with urticaria. There was a gradual increase in IgE levels from 4 to 10 years and then a gradual decrease. IgE was significantly higher in males, particularly in the 21 to 40-year age group and above 60 years. There was no difference in IgE levels in the various ethnic groups. There was a correlation between IgE levels and the number of positive skin tests. Peripheral eosinophilia was found in one-third of the patients with low IgE and in 2/3 of the patients with IgE above 500 IU/mL. An IgE of 120 IU/mL or more was found in 56% of patients with asthma in addition to other atopic diseases. Only 10% of normal controls had an IgE value of 120 IU/mL or more. These results are similar to those reported from European and North American countries.\r"

Amniotic fluid samples were aspirated through the exposed myometrium. Sanguineous specimens were excluded. Amniotic fluid, CS, and MS were tested for total IgE level and IgE RAST to three foods: cow's milk, egg white, and peanut. Data on family medical history, feeding history, and allergy symptoms were collected for 12 months. By 1 year 23% had probable allergy: recurrent wheezing = 8, food related G.I. symptoms = 7, and atopic dermatitis = 4. Allergy in formula-fed infants occurred more often than in those breast-fed for greater than 6 months. IgE in AF was greater than or equal to 0.5 IU/mL in 21/78 (27%); range = 0.5 to 5.9 and geometric mean = 0.76. No correlation was noted between AF total IgE and the appearance of allergy. RAST was equivocally positive in 1.2% AF. Cord serum total IgE was greater than or equal to 0.5 IU/mL in 6/82 (7%); range = 0.5 to 2.6 and geometric mean = 0.72. Allergy appeared in 67% of infants with CS total IgE greater than or equal to 0.5 IU/mL. RAST was negative in all CS samples. In this limited series, AF IgE did not seem to have predictive value of allergy in infancy.\r"

Additionally, over half of those interviewed considered such problems with food an allergy or wondered if they were.

Until recently, patent Nd:YAG laser iridotomies were considered incapable of being closed, and the only reported closure was in an eye with concomitant iritis. Our patient developed iris bombe five times following extracapsular extraction, anterior vitrectomy, and anterior-chamber intraocular lens implantation. The first occurred following closure of the surgical iridectomy; the next three times, following closure of previously patent Nd:YAG iridotomies; and the final episode occurred despite patent iridotomies. This last time one drop of pilocarpine 2% was administered and resulted in immediate iris flattening and reopening of the third iridotomy. Possible mechanisms for closure of the Nd:YAG iridotomies in this case are discussed. We suggest the combination of Nd:YAG laser iridotomies and the stretching of the iris by pilocarpine might have liberated the trapped aqueous humor behind the iris, maintaining the patency of the iridotomies and the depth of the anterior chamber.\r"

Sixty-two years before, the contralateral eye had sustained a penetrating steel injury with subsequent scarring and pupillary membrane and cataract formation. This eye, when surgically rehabilitated, showed no signs of macular degeneration. Although alluded to, we know of no other known cases of occluded eyes being spared of senile macular degeneration reported in the literature. We postulate that unfiltered, ambient light may be the cause of macular degeneration and suggest that more emphasis should be placed on prevention of macular degeneration by the use of protective eye wear.\r"

We analyzed 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, thromboxane B2 and protein concentrations in the aqueous humor of human eyes. The average values of protein, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, and thromboxane B2 in the control eyes were 81.3 +/- 14.0 mg/dL, 17 +/- 30 pg/mL, and 10 +/- 10 pg/mL, respectively. These values were elevated to 182.4 +/- 81.3 mg/dL, 401 +/- 55 pg/mL, and 576 +/- 148 pg/mL, respectively, after YAG laser anterior capsulotomy. The samples with a moderate level of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (less than 300 pg/mL) had negligible changes of thromboxane. The elevation of thromboxane was obvious only when prostaglandin levels rose above 300 pg/mL.\r"

No skin tumors were observed in the group irradiated with UV-A for four weeks (total dose, 4050 kJ/m2, observed for 57 weeks). Ultraviolet exposure induced skin tumors in a dose-dependent manner. In a group exposed to UV irradiation for 13 weeks, 35% of the mice had developed tumors after 57 weeks. Twenty-six weeks of exposure resulted in 88% of the animals being affected. In contrast it was found that treatment with UV-A irradiation (four weeks, total dose up to 4200 kJ/m2) preceding exposure to UV irradiation (13 or 26 weeks) resulted in a significantly delayed tumor development. Exposure with UV-A induced no visible changes of the skin, and subsequent microscopic examination revealed no measurable changes in epidermal thickness or melanin content. Our results suggest that, depending on the exposure schedule, UV-A in addition to previously reported carcinogenic properties also may act as an antitumor agent.\r"

  ".W": "Low-fluence carbon dioxide (CO2) laser irradiation of skin has previously been shown to induce damage limited primarily to the epidermis. To evaluate whether this technique was therapeutically effective for pigmented epidermal lesions, ten lentigines caused by methoxsalen and ultraviolet light therapy were treated in one patient using the CO2 laser at fluences ranging from 3.0 to 7.7 J/cm2 for 0.1-s exposures with 4.5-mm spot size. Based on substantial clearing in seven of ten lesions treated, 146 solar lentigines were treated in five patients at fluences of 3.0, 3.7, or 4.4 J/cm2. Biopsies were performed on a total of 30 lesions immediately and 24 hours, seven days, and six weeks after irradiation. Of 125 lesions followed up clinically for six weeks, 12 cleared completely, 81 lightened substantially, and 28 remained unchanged. Only two demonstrated atrophic change. Hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation did not occur. All lesions that improved had been treated at 3.7 or 4.4 J/cm2. Immediate histologic injury consisted of vacuolar and spindly change and subsequent vesiculation limited to the basilar epidermis. Twenty-four hours later there was epidermal necrosis with regeneration, 0.1 mm of dermal basophilia and stromal condensation, and a mild inflammatory infiltrate. These alterations were dose-dependent, with near complete epidermal necrosis and superficial dermal involvement at the highest fluence, and only focal epidermal necrosis at the lowest. At seven days, epidermal regeneration was complete with traces of melanin remaining in keratinocytes. Melanophages first appeared at seven days and persisted at six weeks, by which time the inflammatory infiltrate had cleared. No lentiginous proliferation was evident and epidermal pigmentation had become normal. Low-fluence CO2 laser irradiation is an effective means of damaging the epidermis with only minimal dermal change. This mode of therapy is an effective way to lighten the pigmentation of lentigines without substantial scarring.\r"

Histologic, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural examination revealed the histiocytic nature of the tumors. An outstanding finding was a marked production of mucinous material, predominantly in long-standing tumors. This nonlangerhansian syndrome differs from other benign normolipemic histiocytic diseases with generalized histiocytic tumors by inheritance, which is most likely autosomal dominant, and by other clinical and histologic features. Since a storage disease could be excluded, the syndrome presented here seems to be a hitherto unknown entity among the benign generalized histiocytoses.\r"

The only significant differences found among the groups, regardless of the presence of hyperlipemia, were the increased levels of total and high-density lipoprotein phospholipids, and lower levels of apolipoprotein B, found in the group with xanthelasmas. The distribution of apolipoprotein E phenotypes was the same in both groups, with slight differences between the normolipemic and hyperlipemic groups.

This diagnosis was further supported by the immunocytochemical demonstration of S100 protein reactivity within the histiocytic cells.

Six hundred and eighty-one (681) such patients are reviewed in this study. Of those referred without metastatic disease (583 patients), metastases developed in 4.8% after a mean followup of 3.6 years. Of those referred with metastatic disease (98 patients), mortality was 35% after a mean followup of 5.9 years. Male patients (p less than 0.04) and patients with axial primaries (p less than 0.05) were at an increased risk of metastasis. Severe histologic regression was present in 40% of the primary lesions that metastasized and in only 17% of similar lesions that did not (p less than 0.001). Increased age was associated with increased local skin metastases, but not with increased nodal or distant metastases. A prognostic model was designed, using two clinical risk factors (axial primary site and male sex) and two histologic risk factors (Clark's Level IV and severe histologic regression). The prognostic model identified a low-risk population--women with extremity primaries--with an actuarial risk of metastasis at 10 years that was less than 3%. Patients with either (1) both clinical risk factors or (2) one clinical risk factor and one histologic risk factor were identified as high-risk patients. Their actuarial risk of metastasis was 11% at 5 years and 22% at 10 years (p = 0.0084). Identifying high-risk and low-risk patients with thin melanomas may improve guidelines for the application of adjuvant therapies to this population.\r"

  ".W": "Simple closure, the conventional operation for perforated acute duodenal ulcers, is associated with symptomatic relapse in a large proportion of patients. In order to assess the role of immediate definitive surgery, 78 fit patients with perforated acute ulcers were prospectively randomized to undergo either closure alone or proximal gastric vagotomy with closure (PGV). Patients taking potentially ulcerogenic drugs or who had severe stress were excluded from the study. Both groups were comparable with respect to age, sex, general medical health, duration of perforation, length of ulcer history, and presence of duodenal scarring. There was no hospital mortality. Minor complications occurred in 7.3% after closure and 10.8% after PGV. At 3 years follow-up, the cumulative recurrence rates were 36.6% and 10.6% after closure and PGV, respectively (p = 0.001). Eighty-five per cent of recurrences after closure were symptomatic, and half of them required reoperation. Duodenal scarring itself did not appear to influence the outcome after closure. PGV was not associated with dumping, diarrhea or other unwanted side effects. Although less than that in chronic ulcers, there is a substantial risk of symptomatic relapse after closure of perforated acute duodenal ulcers. With judicious patient selection, PGV effectively reduces this risk without incurring disabling side effects associated with other ulcer operations.\r"

Lugol-combined endoscopy with biopsy has proven to be most effective for detecting the presence and spread of small malignant lesions of the esophagus.

  ".W": "Duplications of the alimentary tract are unusual congenital anomalies that frequently present a diagnostic as well as therapeutic challenge to the surgeon. Because these lesions occur so infrequently, they are often not suspected until encountered intraoperatively. Due to the complicated anatomy and common blood supply shared between the duplication and associated native bowel, appropriate management requires a familiarity with the anatomy and clinical characteristics of this entity. To better define the range of patient characteristics, clinical presentation, and preferred therapy, 20 enteric duplications were reviewed in 17 patients treated at the Children's Hospital Medical Center from 1956 to 1986. Ages of patients ranged from 1 day to 11 years; 60% were less than 2 years of age at initial presentation. Seven duplications in six patients involved alimentary tract structures of foregut derivation (esophagus, stomach, and Parts I and II of duodenum), with a predominance of girls (4 of 6). Most of these patients (67%) presented with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress and a mass present on chest radiograph. In 67% of the patients, the correct diagnosis was established before operation. None required emergency operative intervention. By contrast, 13 duplications in 11 patients were of midgut or hindgut derivation (Parts III and IV of the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon). In this group of patients, 62% of the duplications involved the cecum, 23% involved the ileum, and 16%, the jejunum. Seventy-eight per cent of the patients were boys. The most common symptoms were nausea and vomiting, and the most common sign was a palpable abdominal mass. Emergency operative intervention was required of eight of 11 patients with duplications involving the small bowel and colon. Three patients presented with an intussusception, four with signs and symptoms consistent with acute appendicitis, one with a small bowel obstruction, and two with gastrointestinal hemorrhage due to the presence of ectopic gastric mucosa within the duplication. It was found that two important points must be considered in regard to the management of enteric duplications: (1) the common blood supply shared between the duplication and native bowel must be carefully protected to avoid undue sacrifice of normal bowel, and (2) the presence of heterotopic gastric mucosa in 35% of patients negates internal drainage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Recurrence of lesions or progression while the patient is no longer receiving exogenous steroids is less well documented. Three cases are reported in which progression or recurrence of HCA after the discontinuance of steroids was documented. In addition, FNH and uterine leiomyomas with HCA were observed in all three cases. The mechanism of tumor formation secondary to the use of oral contraceptives remains undetermined. In two cases, liver tissues were tested for estrogen receptors; both were found to be negative. Although technique as well as the observed progression of these lesions or development of new lesions after the discontinuance of steroids may account for this negative finding, it suggests that induction of this process may be caused by means other than direct cellular stimulation by the exogenous hormones. Finally, these three cases call attention to a potential subgroup of patients having oral contraceptive-associated HCA who may have progression of their liver tumors when no longer receiving steroids and who require an aggressive treatment program and noninvasive follow-up examinations.\r"

Often, screening mammograms reveal a nonpalpable radiographic abnormality and the diagnosis must be determined by an excisional biopsy after radiographic needle localization. The mammographic features associated with 179 nonpalpable breast abnormalities biopsied after radiographic needle localization were carefully characterized. There were 41 carcinomas (23%) in the series. The aim of this study was to determine which radiographic findings, if any, strongly portend the presence of either a malignant or benign lesion. Mammographic features that were commonly associated with malignancy include a change from a previous mammogram, a distortion of the surrounding architecture, the association of a soft tissue density and calcifications, and the presence of more than ten calcifications in the lesion. The radiographic abnormalities which were more commonly associated with benign disease include well-defined densities without calcifications, asymmetric densities without calcifications, and abnormalities consisting solely of a focus of mammographic calcifications that have fewer than ten concretions. The incidence of malignancy in lesions having these mammographic characteristics was only 5.5%. On the basis of these results alone, no firm threshold for biopsy can be recommended. The risks of deferring biopsy until there is worsening of the mammographic image remains to be determined.\r"

The many advances of modern surgical care over the last 30 years have not appreciably altered the incidence of these complications. Many risk factors have been shown to contribute to this problem, but no studies have examined the impact of preoperative protein depletion on respiratory function and related this to the development of postoperative pulmonary complications. 80 patients (42 men, 38 women, median age of 64 years, with a range of 15-91 years) awaiting major elective gastrointestinal (G.I.) surgery were divided into two categories on the basis of a direct measurement of protein depletion: nonprotein-depleted patients (n = 41, mean protein loss, 2% +/- 1.7 SEM) and protein-depleted patients (n = 39, mean protein loss, 36% +/- 3.5 SEM). There was no significant difference between these two categories in regard to age, height, sex, surgical diagnosis, the presence of chronic lung disease, smoking, proportion of upper abdominal incisions, degree of obesity, the duration of anesthesia, and the use of prophylactic antibiotics and physiotherapy. There was a significant difference between these two categories of patients in regard to respiratory muscle strength (p less than .025), vital capacity (p less than .05), and peak expiratory flow rate (p less than .005). Pneumonia developed in a significantly higher proportion of protein-depleted patients with atelectasis (p less than .05), and their stay in the hospital after surgery was longer (p less than .05). These data show that protein depletion is associated with an impairment of respiratory function, and is in itself a significant risk factor in the development of postoperative pneumonia.\r"

In addition to pancreaticoduodenectomy, 37 consecutive patients (from 1971 to 1981) received lymphatic dissection adjacent to the pancreatic head (Group R1), whereas another 22 patients (from 1981 to 1983) received a wider range of lymphatic and soft tissue dissection, including the para-aortic region (Group R2). These groups did not differ with regard to operative mortality rate or background factors in the patients who tolerated operation. The 3-year cumulative survival rate was 13% in the R1 group vs. 38% in the R2 group (p less than 0.05). Almost all of the deaths from cancer recurrence occurred within 3 years after operation; the cumulative rate of death from local recurrence decreased from 67 to 16% (p less than 0.05) at 3 years. Among the patients with nodal involvement, there was no 3-year survivor in the R1 group, but four (27%) in the R2 group (p less than 0.05) survived. Among the patients whose tumor size exceeded 4 cm with retroperitoneal invasion, there was no 3-year survivor in either group and most patients died of distant metastasis. Extended clearance of regional lymph nodes and soft tissue appears to benefit patients with ductal carcinoma of the pancreatic head whose tumor size is less than 4 cm without severe invasion to the retroperitoneal space.\r"

Indications for pulmonary resection resulting in CP were lung cancer (LC) in 64 patients, pulmonary metastases (PM) in 20, and benign lung disease (BLD) in 29. Operative mortality was 12.4% (14 deaths) but varied according to the indication for CP. Mortality was 9.4% for LC, 0% for PM, and 27.6% for BLD. Forty-three patients (38.1%) had major complications (26 of 64 with LC, 40.6%; 1 of 20 with PM, 5.0%; and 16 of 29 with BLD, 55.2%). Five-year actuarial survival for patients with LC was 26.4% but varied according to stage. Five-year survival for patients with PM was 40.8% and with BLD was 27.2%. We conclude that CP for BLD carries marked operative mortality and morbidity, usually due to intense reaction around hilar structures and concurrent active infection or fistula. In contrast, CP for LC and PM can be performed with low mortality, acceptable morbidity, and gratifying long-term survival.\r"

The cause of the aneurysms was arteriosclerosis or medial degeneration in 83 patients, trauma in 50, dissection in 34, and a congenital malformation in 6. A single method of external shunting provided distal perfusion in all patients in the series. A 9-mm Gott aneurysm shunt was placed preferentially between the ascending aorta (67%) and the descending aorta (60%). Alternative sites of proximal cannulation (aortic arch, 9%; proximal descending aorta, 22%; left ventricle, 2%) and distal cannulation (abdominal aorta, 3%; left femoral artery, 37%) were chosen based on the location and the extent of the aortic aneurysm. No systemic heparinization was used. In the last 40 patients, a flowmeter adapted for use with the shunt allowed the recording of shunt flow (mean, 2,475 ml/min; range, 1,100 to 4,000 ml/min). Hospital mortality, including patients with ruptured aneurysms, was 15% (26/173). The mean aortic cross-clamp time was 37 minutes (range, 8 to 105 minutes). Of the 173 patients, 168 survived long enough to allow accurate clinical evaluation of the function of the spinal cord: no paraplegia or other spinal cord ischemic injury occurred. To date, our clinical experience has demonstrated the effectiveness of the 9-mm Gott shunt in preserving the functional integrity of the spinal cord during cross-clamping of the thoracic aorta.\r"

The influence of age on primary tissue failure has received limited consideration. From 1975 to 1986, 1,301 Carpentier-Edwards standard porcine bioprostheses were implanted in 1,183 patients in 1,201 operations. Of the total number of prostheses, 97.7% were implanted prior to 1983. The mean follow-up was 5.6 years and was 97.5% complete. Primary tissue failure was identified in 96 patients (98 operations) at reoperation (95) or autopsy (3). One hundred four (104) prostheses were involved. Thirty-one failed after aortic valve replacement (AVR), 49 after mitral valve replacement (MVR), and 24 after multiple-valve replacement (18 patients). There were 47 male and 49 female patients. The mean age at implantation was 47 years (range, 8 to 72 years). The mean implantation time was 74.0 months. The freedom from primary tissue failure at 10 years is 77.0 +/- 2.9% overall; for AVR, 83.1 +/- 3.7%; for MVR, 72.1 +/- 4.9%; and for multiple-valve replacement, 65.5 +/- 7.8%. The freedom from deterioration for patients less than 20 years of age is significantly less than that for other age groups. The freedom from deterioration increased by decades; the greatest freedom was noted in patients 70 to 80 years old and 80 years old or older. The freedom from deterioration at 10 years for patients less than 30 years of age is 26.8 +/- 17.2%; 30 to 59 years, 77.4 +/- 3.0%; and 60 years and older, 83.1 +/- 4.2%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

There were no significant differences between the three study groups.

Serious complications and deaths were also similar between the three agents. The presence of multiple severe underlying conditions was a risk factor for infection, independent of the antibiotic used. We conclude that there are no differences in the efficacies of the three agents in preventing postoperative infections in patients having open-heart operation. Cefuroxime, principally because of its every-12-hour dose, is far less expensive than cefamandole or cefazolin.\r"

Survival in patients with T3 N0 and T3 N1 or N2 disease was 33% and 0 at 5 years, respectively. The prognosis for patients with pleurisy was poor, and all died within 3 years. Therefore, complete lung resection should be done in patients with T3 N0 non-small cell lung cancer if complete resection is expected. Long-term survival is less likely for patients with lymph node metastases if complete resection cannot be performed.\r"

The total follow-up was 2,931 patient-years. Twenty years after operation, overall survival was 51.6 +/- 8.1%, freedom from valve-related death was 67.1 +/- 8.9%, freedom from primary tissue failure was 12.4 +/- 4.8%, freedom from infective endocarditis was 82.7 +/- 4.3%, freedom from surgical technical failure was 88.1 +/- 2.3%, and freedom from all complications including valve-related death was 9.0 +/- 3.5%. The incidence of thromboembolism was 0.034% per patient-year (one potential event). Long-term results after homograft insertion for aortic stenosis were significantly better than those after insertion for aortic incompetence. It is concluded that the good quality of life and the median life expectancy, which extends more than 20 years after operation, make the homograft an excellent choice for AVR.\r"

This study was undertaken to determine whether pressure-controlled intermittent coronary sinus occlusion (PICSO) could improve antegrade cardioplegic delivery when coronary occlusions are present. Twenty pigs were subjected to 120 minutes of ischemic arrest with antegrade, multidose, potassium crystalloid cardioplegia. During arrest, the mid-left anterior descending artery was occluded with a snare, which was released on reperfusion. In 10 pigs, a balloon-tipped catheter was placed in the coronary sinus and PICSO was performed during each cardioplegia dose. PICSO-treated hearts had faster arrests (27 +/- 5 versus 102 +/- 21 [SE] seconds; p less than 0.02), as well as lower temperatures (18.4 +/- 1.0 versus 22.0 +/- 1.4 degrees C; p less than 0.05) and higher tissue pH (6.58 +/- 0.09 versus 6.31 +/- 0.09; p less than 0.05) just before aortic unclamping. Postischemic end-diastolic volume was unchanged with PICSO, but it decreased in non-PICSO-treated hearts. PICSO-treated hearts generated a higher postischemic stroke work index (0.70 +/- 0.08 versus 0.38 +/- 0.08 g-m/kg; end-diastolic volume, 60 ml; p less than 0.05). We conclude that PICSO improves cardioplegic distribution, thus reducing ischemic injury.\r"

The Langendorff preparation of the isolated rat heart was used. Groups of normal (WKY) and hypertrophied (SHR) hearts were treated by five different cardioplegic methods and subjected to 90 or 30 minutes of ischemia at 28 degrees to 29 degrees C and reperfusion at 37 degrees C. The following cardioplegic solutions were used: Group A, cold (16 degrees C) Krebs-Henseleit (KH) glucose free only; Group B, KH with KCL (30 mEq/L) (16 degrees C); Group C, same as B with verapamil (10 microM); Group D, perfusion with oxygenated KH solution containing KCL (30 mEq/L) for 15 minutes prior to ischemia; and Group E, same as D with verapamil (10 microM). Recovery of contraction amplitude, ischemic contracture, coronary perfusate volume, the amount of creatine kinase in the coronary perfusate, heart rate, time of revival, O2 consumption, and ischemic contracture were measured. After 30 minutes of ischemia, we did not find any significant difference among the combinations tested with respect to contraction amplitude recovery. The hearts recovered fully. After 90 minutes of ischemia, we found that the best-protected groups in the normal hearts were Groups D and E. In the hypertrophied hearts, the addition of verapamil to the enhancement solution was harmful. The use of enhancement solution without verapamil prior to ischemia provided the best myocardial protection in the hypertrophied hearts.\r"

There were 196 patients, 162 male and 34 female patients, with a mean age of 48 +/- 12 years. Operative survivors were followed up from 3 to 15.6 years (mean follow-up, 6.6 +/- 1.5 years), with a cumulative follow-up of 1,140 patient-years, being 100% complete. Actuarial survival was 51 +/- 15% at 14 years. Eight patients sustained systemic embolic episodes (0.7 +/- 0.2%/patient-year); actuarial freedom from emboli is 89.4 +/- 4.3% at 14 years. Reoperation was performed in 53 patients: in 6 because of endocarditis (0.5 +/- 0.2%/patient-year), in 7 because of perivalvular leak (0.6 +/- 0.2%/patient-year), and in 40 because of PB primary tissue failure (3.5 +/- 0.5%/patient-year). Actuarial freedom from PB-related deaths, PB failure, and overall PB-related complications at 14 years was 66.3 +/- 19, 34.3 +/- 11, and 30 +/- 10%, respectively. This long-term experience shows that the performance of the Hancock PB appears satisfactory up to 8 years, while it progressively deteriorates beyond 10 years because of the impact of primary tissue failure on valve durability, justifying the restriction of its use in the aortic position in selected patients.\r"

In 10 patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, three form-fitted, flexible templates containing a total of 156 bipolar electrodes were fixed to the epicardial surface of both atria. Data were recorded continuously from all 156 electrodes simultaneously during normal sinus rhythm, left atrial pacing, right atrial pacing, and reciprocating tachycardia. In all 10 patients, the site of the accessory pathway correlated with the results of the preoperative electrophysiological study and of the standard intraoperative band electrode mapping. The accessory pathway was located in the left free wall position in 8 patients, the right free wall position in 1 patient, and the posterior septal position in 1 patient. In 4 of the 8 patients with left free wall pathways, activation maps of retrograde atrial activation during reciprocating tachycardia demonstrated a broad base of initial atrial depolarization. This finding suggests that some accessory pathways may have a broad band of insertion on the atrium, and supports our practice of wide dissection of the entire anatomical space associated with each pathway to avoid recurrences of WPW syndrome. Simultaneous global atrial-activation mapping in patients with WPW syndrome provides a clearer understanding of atrial activation during reciprocating tachycardia.\r"

The present study, however, shows that only 45 (64%) of 70 consecutively diagnosed patients with pernicious anemia, the most common cause of cobalamin deficiency, had very low cobalamin levels (less than 74 pmol/L [or less than 100 ng/L]). Anemia was absent in 13 (19%) of the patients, and macrocytosis was absent in 23 (33%) of the patients; such absence was particularly common when cobalamin levels were only slightly or moderately low (74 to 184 pmol/L). Coexisting iron deficiency was responsible for the absence of macrocytosis in nine patients. Of the ten patients with neither anemia nor macrocytosis, neurological disturbance was prominent in six, including four whose only noticeable abnormality was cerebral. These observations indicate that macrocytosis and anemia, two classic features of pernicious anemia, may be overstressed in our diagnostic approach. All subnormal serum cobalamin results are best viewed as pathological until proved otherwise. Emphasis on only very low cobalamin levels risks delaying the diagnosis of pernicious anemia in a substantial proportion of cases, particularly in those without anemia or macrocytosis.\r"

Their egg test results were significantly lower than in normal controls, while Schilling test results were normal. Twenty of the subjects had egg test excretion below 1.5%. No features distinguished them from the 27 who excreted more than 1.5% other than the presence of lower pepsinogen I:II ratios. Eight of 19 tested patients with food cobalamin malabsorption had no evidence of abnormal gastric status by blood tests and/or gastric analysis. Also noteworthy was the finding of food cobalamin malabsorption in 60% of tested patients who had neurologic, cerebral, or psychiatric abnormalities. Food cobalamin malabsorption appears to be associated frequently with otherwise unexplained low cobalamin levels. Low cobalamin levels in patients with normal Schilling test results cannot be dismissed as insignificant without also testing for food cobalamin malabsorption, whether or not the patients have known gastric dysfunction.\r"

We created a structured antibiotic order form designed to guide physicians toward correct therapeutic decisions without restricting their clinical options. Educational messages and graphic reminders were incorporated into a new form required to order parenteral antibiotics at a teaching hospital. Pharmacokinetic considerations were emphasized. The forms were supplemented with brief literature reviews and appropriate references. Before introduction of the form, pharmacokinetically incorrect orders for clindamycin, cefazolin sodium, and metronidazole hydrochloride accounted for 90%, 60%, and 75% of patient-days of therapy for these drugs, respectively. Immediately after implementation of the form, nonrecommended dosing schedules dropped to under 6% of patient-days for all three antibiotics. Savings from these drugs alone accounted for over $76,000 annually. We conclude that in a period of increasing constraints on hospital budgets and proliferating restrictions on physicians' clinical choices, educational intervention at the time orders are written can provide a cost-effective and noncoercive means of improving some forms of acute-care clinical decision making.\r"

To determine whether age is related to the development of bleeding complications in patients who are receiving long-term oral anticoagulant therapy, the records of 321 patients who were followed up in the university hospital outpatient anticoagulation clinic during an eight-year period were reviewed. During this period, 61 patients (19%) developed minor bleeding complications, and 14 patients (4.4%) developed major bleeding complications. In utilizing a life-table approach to adjust for varying lengths of follow-up, the risk of initial minor bleeding complications was found to be greatest within the first three months (14%). For major bleeding complications, risk increased throughout the first two years of anticoagulation clinic follow-up, with no particular period of greatest risk. No significant differences in the risk of initial minor or major bleeding complications were observed in the various age groups that were examined (less than 50, 50 to 59, 60 to 69, and greater than or equal to 70 years). A multivariate regression approach, controlling for several potentially confounding factors, confirmed the lack of an association of age with the risk of minor or major bleeding complications. The results of this retrospective follow-up study suggest that patient age, in and of itself, should not be considered a primary factor in assessing the risk of long-term oral anticoagulant therapy.\r"

These abnormalities have not previously been reported, and they may be important in the management of these patients and in patients with other neuromuscular diseases.\r"

  ".W": "Serum myoglobin levels were studied in 178 consecutive patients admitted for chest pain due to ischemic cardiac injury. Serum myoglobin level was compared with the clinical condition, electrocardiographic changes, and serum creatine kinase levels. Elevated serum myoglobin concentration was present in all patients with acute myocardial infarction, as defined by World Health Organization, Geneva, criteria, and, in addition, in about 50% of patients with so-called acute coronary insufficiency. On this basis we could define two different groups of patients with acute coronary insufficiency: cases exhibiting elevated serum myoglobin levels (group 1) and those with normal levels (group 2). In group 1 although creatine kinase levels were in the normal range, they were significantly higher than in group 2. Four patients from group 1 developed heart failure and another a typical acute myocardial infarction during hospitalization, whereas no patients of group 2 had such complications. In patients with acute myocardial infarction, the elevation of serum myoglobin preceded that of creatine kinase in most cases. Myoglobin release appears to be related to infarct size, the highest levels were found in extensive myocardial infarction and less marked elevations in cases of subendocardial infarction and in half of the cases with acute coronary insufficiency. It is proposed that serum myoglobin is a reliable measure of myocardial necrosis and serves to detect a hitherto undefined population of small-size acute myocardial infarction, with its attendant clinical and prognostic implications.\r"

Fifteen patients had lymphoma or leukemia and three had breast cancer. Nine patients were neutropenic (polymorphonuclear neutrophil count, less than 1.0 x 10(9)/L), seven patients had a Hickman catheter in place, and 14 had recently received chemotherapy. Twelve of the bacteremic episodes were clinically significant, and four of these 12 involved Hickman catheters. Catheter removal was ultimately necessary in all four patients. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy was performed on one of the removed Hickman catheters and showed Bacillus organisms embedded in a biofilm composed of gram-positive cocci and glycocalyx. Bacillus species were uniformly susceptible to vancomycin, imipenem, and aminoglycosides, with penicillin susceptibilities being variable. Bacillus appears to be another gram-positive organism now being recognized as a bacterial pathogen for compromised hosts. When such infections involve long-term indwelling venous access devices, treatment should include immediate catheter removal as well as antibiotic therapy.\r"

All fulfilled the following criteria: (1) stable and therapeutic prothrombin time (PT) at baseline, defined as at least two consecutive PTs obtained within two weeks before beginning amiodarone therapy that varied by less than or equal to 15%; (2) no warfarin dosage adjustment in the two weeks prior to amiodarone therapy; (3) no other drugs given that alter coagulation study results; and (4) follow-up PTs obtained 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks after initiation of amiodarone treatment. A clinically significant change in PT was defined as greater than 15%. Mean baseline PT was 19.8 s for patients receiving 5.99 mg/d of warfarin sodium. Patients had a mean maximum increase in PT of 44% (range, 22% to 108%), which occurred during the first two weeks. In six patients, the PT returned to within 15% of baseline by week 4 or 8, and the daily warfarin requirement had decreased by 35% (range, 25% to 50%). Two patients had PTs varying by greater than 15% from baseline at week 8 despite a 33% reduction in warfarin dosage in each case. No patient in this series encountered complications of anticoagulant therapy, perhaps due to early recognition and dosage reduction. Although the mechanism remains unclear, our study indicates that amiodarone potentiation of warfarin effects occurs in all patients, occurs in the first two weeks of amiodarone therapy, variably increases PT by 22% to 108%, and lowers the warfarin requirement by 25% to 50%. We recommend a 25% prophylactic reduction of warfarin dosage and weekly measurements of PT for one month when amiodarone therapy is initiated.\r"

Complete charge data were available for 81 hospitalizations; the mean charge per hospitalization was +13,830 (SD, +13,610), the average length of stay was 14.8 days (SD, 13.1 days), and the mean per diem charge was +1058 (SD, +802). For patients who received all their AIDS-related medical care at the Medical College of Virginia Hospitals, total lifetime hospital charges averaged +27,264, the mean number of hospital stays was 2.29, and the average length of stay was 12 days. The average length of hospital stay, total charges per hospitalization, and average charge per day of hospitalization decreased over the study period. These findings suggest that inpatient costs of treating individual patients with AIDS are less than initially estimated and are decreasing due to the ability to more effectively manage these patients.\r"

Among patients with skin tags, 23 (10.2%) of 226 had polyps, whereas among patients without skin tags, 20 (7.5%) of 266 had polyps. The predictive value of the presence of a skin tag was 10.2%. Contrary to studies done in more selected populations with a higher prevalence of adenomatous polyps, the results using a 60-cm flexible sigmoidoscope in a primary care population suggest that cutaneous skin tags are not a marker for adenomatous polyps of the colon.\r"

The limitation of medical resources has given rise to the need for a clear conceptual basis for allocating scarce resources. The role of resource gatekeeper may be used to the indigent patient's disadvantage when the principles of triage are used incorrectly in situations of relative scarcity. To allocate limited resources fairly under changing policy and economic conditions, health care institutions should ensure that systematic processes, such as those of ethics consultants and committees, are readily available to help resolve problematic cases and policies. Physicians with clinical judgment and a primary commitment to patient care must assume active roles in these processes in order to build an ethically sound framework for clinical decision making in times of relatively scarce resources.\r"

Twenty-nine had evidence of increased aluminum burden, although only three had evidence of overt aluminum toxicity, and nine did not have evidence of increased aluminum burden. The patients in both the high- and low-aluminum group were similar with regard to age, the cause of their renal failure, presence of hypertension or coronary artery disease, previous parathyroidectomy, and a number of biochemical parameters, along with the amount of prescribed aluminum. All patients were followed up for the next two years or until they died. The amount of ingested aluminum was reduced, and in selected patients, treatment with intermittent infusions of deferoxamine mesylate was instituted. There were no deaths in the low-aluminum group, but ten of 29 died in the high-aluminum group: seven of vascular disease and three of infection. In addition, morbidity as defined by hospitalization for coronary or cerebral vascular disease or infection occurred in only two of the nine patients in the low-aluminum group and in 19 of the 29 patients in the high-aluminum group. These observations imply that the occurrence of increased body aluminum, as suggested by aluminum blood levels or by results of bone biopsies in some patients, has an adverse effect on morbidity and mortality and should be considered as a possible independent risk factor in patients who are receiving long-term hemodialysis.\r"

These include lead placement, computer-implemented signal averaging, high-pass filtering, and feature extraction for characterizing the late potential. The major application of late- potential analysis has been in patients after myocardial infarction. Several of these studies are reviewed that demonstrate the usefulness of this new approach in identifying those patients at greatest risk for developing ventricular tachycardia. The most impressive studies have been those that compare late potentials with measures of ventricular performance and ventricular ectopy.\r"

I describe a 32-year-old woman who presented during the third trimester of her second pregnancy with a toxic cystic lesion of the thyroid. In studies performed post partum, the serum free thyroxine (T4) index was normal, while the triiodothyronine (T3) level was elevated and thyrotropin level was low and unresponsive to thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulation. Iodine 123 thyroid scan demonstrated localized nonsuppressible uptake over the nodule. Multiple echo-free (fluid-filled) cavities were observed by ultrasound study. Thyroid lobectomy demonstrated a thyroid colloid nodule with areas of cystic degeneration containing hyperplastic papillary projections. Postoperatively, the patient developed transient hypothyroidism followed by spontaneous recovery to euthyroidism with normal function of the suppressed gland. Blood obtained from the venous effluent of the thyroid nodule had extremely high T3 and T4 concentrations: 359.1 nmol/L and 2420 nmol/L, respectively, while peripheral venous blood showed isolated elevation of T3, to 4.6 nmol/L (normal, 1.2 to 3.1 nmol/L), and a normal T4 level of 116 nmol/L (normal, 64 to 154 nmol/L). Serum T3 and T4 thyroidal/peripheral ratios were close to one in two euthyroid patients undergoing neck surgery. Thus, thyroid nodules may present with isolated elevation of serum T3 levels despite increased thyroidal release of T4.\r"

To evaluate possible effects of cataract and aphakia on eye elongation, we measured the axial length in children with unilateral aphakia (15 children with congenital cataract and 27 with traumatic cataract) and in children with bilateral congenital cataract (operated on in 14 cases and not operated on in eight cases). In all cases of unilateral aphakia, the aphakic eye was consistently longer than the normal fellow eye. Excessive eye elongation was related to corresponding reduction in visual acuity. The presumed rate of elongation was quantitatively expressed using the time elapsed since surgery and the age of the child. In bilateral congenital cataract, the axial length measured in aphakic eyes that were operated on was similar to that in eyes that were not operated on. We suggest that unilateral cataract or aphakia is associated with excessive eye elongation of affected eyes. Eye elongation seems to be related to amblyopia and poor vision rather than to aphakia.\r"

A composite of all the cotton-wool spots for each of these four categories was obtained by computed reconstruction to analyze variations in their distribution and size. The cotton-wool spots had a predilection for the temporal quadrants in the four categories and were smaller in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome than the other groups. Patients with ischemic central retinal vein occlusion had more cotton-wool spots than the other groups. No other definite differences were detected. Cotton-wool spots than the other groups. No other definite differences were detected. Cotton-wool spots seem to be a common pathway following various insults to the retina, most probably of a vaso-occlusive origin.\r"

We used the fundus camera stimulator to determine whether this sensitivity loss is caused directly by the presence of drusen. We measured retinal sensitivity over drusen and in drusen-free areas in eight patients with drusen and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). There was no significant difference in sensitivity between drusen and nondrusen areas in each patient. The sensitivity loss seen in patients with drusen thus seems to reflect a more diffuse disease of the retina and retinal pigment epithelium and is not a direct effect of drusen. More marked sensitivity losses are found in even small areas of more advanced AMD changes, suggesting that a large focal loss in retinal sensitivity may be an indicator of developing AMD changes.\r"

  ".W": "A distinguishing feature of early diabetic retinal vascular changes is the selective degeneration of pericytes (mural cells) from the retinal capillary vessels. Loss of these pericytes has been proposed to be associated with decreased capillary tonicity, the formation of microaneurysms, and vessel dilation. The role of aldose reductase in the progression of diabetic retinopathy has been investigated in age- and sex-matched beagles fed a 30% galactose diet with or without the aldose reductase inhibitors sorbinil or M79175. Eyes were periodically enucleated from dogs in each group and their retinal capillaries were examined as trypsin-digested flat preparations. Before the clinical appearance of retinal changes, pericyte ghost formation was observed in the eyes of three fourths of the dogs after 21 months and all of the dogs after 24 months of galactose feeding. Many of the capillaries containing pericyte ghosts demonstrated an apparent proliferation of endothelial cells and acellular vessels. No pericyte ghosts or abnormal findings were observed in retinas from either normal control (zero of nine) or galactose-fed dogs treated with aldose reductase inhibitors (zero of 16). These findings indicate that aldose reductase inhibitors can prevent the formation of pericyte ghosts and other subsequent capillary changes in experimental retinopathy.\r"

The drug distribution pattern in the ocular tissues after multiple dosing was the same as after single dosing.

Corneal permeability (Kp) to methazolamide and ethoxzolamide was similar in both species, but for benzolamide and bromacetazolamide the Kp was greater in humans. Human corneas without epithelium had Kp the same as scleral Kp. Topical methazolamide (6 mmol/L) was studied in vivo in rabbits and in ten humans before cataract surgery. The mean (+/- SE) concentration in the rabbit aqueous was 3.2 +/- 1.4 mumol/L at eight minutes and 1.2 +/- 0.16 mumol/L at one hour. In humans, less than 0.2 mumol/L was detected at eight minutes; at one hour none was detected in three cases, and 0.4 +/- 0.08 mumol/L was detected in four cases.

Paired arcuate incisions placed at optical zones of 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 mm were progressively lengthened from 45 degrees to 60 degrees, 90 degrees, and, finally, 120 degrees. The corneal flattening in the meridian centered over the incisions and the corneal steepening 90 degrees away were quantified with each successive lengthening. Linear regression analysis showed a direct linear relationship of corneal astigmatic change (sum of corneal flattening and steepening, or delta K) to decreasing optical zone size as measured in millimeters and increasing incision length as measured in degrees. The delta K value ranged from 2.65 +/- 1.07 diopters to 22.05 +/- 3.55 D. The flattening/steepening coupling ratio mean was 1.47 +/- 0.41. Progressively longer paired arcuate incisions produced a predictable and titratable corneal flattening in the meridian centered over the incisions and a slightly smaller corneal steepening 90 degrees away, making the procedure ideal for mixed astigmatism.\r"

Seven patients who had suffered subarachnoid haemorrhage were examined by cerebral angiography and by 99Tcm HMPAO scanning. The two studies were compared and in six cases there was evidence of decreased cerebral perfusion in relation to the ruptured aneurysm causing the subarachnoid haemorrhage. In one case no cause for the haemorrhage was demonstrated angiographically, and the HMPAO study was normal. In two of the six cases, spasm of the cerebral artery distal to the ruptured aneurysm was seen angiographically and it appears that 99Tcm HMPAO scanning does not correlate with gross arterial spasm but reflects smaller degrees of cerebral underperfusion not demonstrable by angiography. The results demonstrate a relationship between local decreased cerebral perfusion and ruptured cerebral aneurysm and may be of use in determining which aneurysm has bled in patients who have more than one aneurysm demonstrated angiographically.\r"

Compared to men, women had lower height, weight, and forearm volume (P less than 0.001), higher heart rate (P less than 0.001), and lower brachial artery diameter (P less than 0.001) both in the normotensive and hypertensive groups. Compared to normotensives, hypertensives of the same sex showed an increase in brachial artery diameter, only significant in men (P less than 0.001), and an increase in heart rate, only significant in women (P less than 0.001). The multiple regression analysis of brachial artery diameter showed significant coefficients for sex and hypertension (P less than 0.001), and for age and heart rate (P less than 0.05); the multiple regression analysis of blood velocity showed that only the coefficient of hypertension was significant (P less than 0.05). The study of first-order interactions between the independent variables revealed that effect of sex on arterial diameter did not depend on the other variables. In contrast the effects of age and heart rate were influenced by the presence or the absence of hypertension, and arterial caliber was positively related to age in normotensive subjects (P less than 0.05) but not in hypertensive patients, and negatively related to heart rate in hypertensive patients (P less than 0.001) but not in normotensive subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The data were from a longitudinal research program examining biochemical, hormonal, and hemodynamic parameters in normal subjects. Bloods and 24-hour urine specimens were collected at yearly intervals from 144 people over 9 years, and from an additional 110 over 4 years. The subjects were originally distributed equally by sex, race (black, white), blood pressure (three groups within the normal range), and age (three groups). Men had 33% higher urine creatinines per weight than females (P less than 0.001). Because they only had 8% higher creatinine clearance per weight they also exhibited 21% higher serum creatinine. Blacks had 5% higher urine creatinine per weight than whites, perhaps reflecting greater muscle mass, but their serum creatinines were not different from those of whites, reflecting a 5% higher creatinine clearance by weight than whites (P less than 0.01). Interestingly, older black men (age greater than 60 years) had 12% lower urine creatinine/weight than younger black men (P less than 0.001). They also had 13% lower creatinine clearance by weight, resulting in no net difference in serum creatinine. The intraindividual variability in urine creatinine excretion averaged 15% and did not differ between blacks and whites and men and women. The within individual variability in serum creatinine and creatinine clearance averaged 14 and 20%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The measurements were made using sphygmomanometry, ECG, and impedance cardiography. In the isometric handgrip test the heart rate and the diastolic and mean blood pressure increased slightly more (P less than 0.05) in the NCA group than in the controls. In the NCA group the blood pressure rise was, on average, due to an increase in the peripheral vascular resistance, while in the control group it was caused by an elevation in the cardiac output. In the orthostatic and cold pressor tests the hemodynamic alterations were quite similar in the two groups. It is concluded that the NCA patients have in the orthostatic and cold pressor tests a normal ability to elevate the blood pressure by increasing the peripheral vascular resistance. The lack of rise in the cardiac output during the isometric handgrip test in the NCA group is an abnormal reaction, the reason of which remains to be studied.\r"

Thus an alteration of tissue noradrenaline content and/or adrenergic receptors in heart and kidney might be involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension. In order to verify this possibility, we studied tissue noradrenaline content and alpha and beta adrenergic receptors in the heart and kidney of Lyon hypertensive (LH), normotensive (LN), and low-pressure (LL) rats. Density and affinity of receptors were determined using the specific radioligands [3H]-prazosin (alpha 1), [3H]-rauwolscine (alpha 2), and [3H]-dihydroalprenolol (beta) in prehypertensive (5-week-old) and hypertensive (21-week-old) rats. In the prehypertensive period, no differences concerning renal and cardiac noradrenaline content and adrenergic receptor densities and affinities were observed. In the hypertensive period, an age-related decrease of renal alpha 1 and beta receptors was observed in LN and LL (P less than 0.01) but not in LH rats. Consequently, at this time, density of renal alpha 1 and beta receptors was higher in LH than in LN and LL (P less than 0.01). In contrast, the density and affinity of renal alpha 2 and cardiac alpha 1 and beta receptors and tissue noradrenaline content were similar in the three rat strains. Because renal alpha 1 and beta receptors mediate various functions involved in the control of blood pressure such as tubular sodium reabsorption, renin secretion, and glomerular filtration, the different density of these receptors in LH rats might be involved in the development or maintenance of hypertension.\r"

The blood pressure in rats fed with a sodium diet increased significantly after 4 weeks of the treatment compared to the control rats fed with a regular diet, which was accompanied by increased urinary output of the EDLS. Electrical lesions of the AV3V area in the hypothalamus significantly decreased both the urinary EDLS level and the blood pressure elevated by the sodium-loading. With the immunohistochemistry using digoxin antibody, the immunoreactives were localized in the neurons of paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei and some other hypothalamic areas, and were also seen in the nerve fibers distributed in the basal hypothalamus, infundibulum, and pituitary posterior lobe. Assuming that the CSF sodium is responsible for the release of EDLS, hypertonic NaCl (2.5 M) was infused into the lateral ventricle for 30 minutes. Blood pressure increased gradually, attaining peak rises about 30 minutes later. The plasma content of the EDLS was significantly greater in the hypertonic NaCl group than the control group treated with either the artificial CSF or 2.5 M of urea solution. On the other hand, the hypothalamic content decreased with the infusion of the hypertonic saline. Furthermore, the continuous intracerebroventricular infusions of the hypertonic NaCl with osmotic minipumps in conscious rats significantly increased the arterial pressure after 6 days. Thereby, the plasma level of the EDLS was significantly greater than the control rats that received only the artificial CSF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Elevated levels of a specific renal growth factor, renotropin, have been associated with spontaneous hypertension. To examine this association more closely, we have undertaken the development of a better assay system to characterize and purify renotropin. Sera from rabbits prior to operation (control) and at a specified time after unilateral nephrectomy (uni) were examined for renotropic activity. Comparing the effects of uni to control sera in the same rabbit, significant stimulation of 3H-thymidine incorporation into the DNA of primary rabbit kidney cultures incubated in D-valine medium to eliminate fibroblast growth was noted: at 3 days postoperatively 73% (n = 13), at 7 days 103% (n = 39), at 10 days 130% (n = 31), at 21 days 101% (n = 24), at 42 days 89% (n = 13). All values were at least P less than 0.01. The stimulatory properties were dose-dependent but reached a plateau at high serum concentrations. Comparing CPM/mg protein in uni/control in different concentrations of sera 7 days postoperatively, uni versus control were 67/44 at 5% v/v, 139/72 at 10% v/v, 261/161 at 20% v/v, and 243/136 at 40% v/v. The renotropic effect of uni sera remained after dialysis in incubation medium and after sera were heated in boiling water for 5 minutes. Renal extracts obtained from growing kidneys 7 days postnephrectomy augmented renotropic activity. Atrial natriuretic factor, ouabain, PGF2 alpha, PGE1, and cAMP did not possess renotropic activity. We conclude that the primary rabbit kidney culture assay for renotropin is highly sensitive and will be an important tool to comprehend the role of renotropin in the pathogenesis of hypertension.\r"

A 4-week placebo runin period was followed by a 9-week double-blind period during which patients were randomly assigned to placebo or 2, 4, or 8 mg doxazosin. Blood pressures (BP) and heart rates (HR) were measured 24 hours postdose. The mean changes in standing BP (mmHg) were -6.2/-6.9 (2-mg regimen), -5.7/-5.8 (4-mg regimen), -8.5/-7.7 (8-mg regimen) for DOX patients and 0.7/-2.9 for placebo patients. The mean changes in supine BP (mmHg) were -3.2/-4.7 (2-mg regimen), -4.0/-5.1 (4-mg regimen), -4.6/-5.6 (8-mg regimen) for DOX patients and -0.5/-3.3 for placebo patients. There was no evidence of a dose-response relationship for DOX; however, DOX serum levels were linearly related to the dose. Responder rate for the combined DOX patients was 38% (32/84) and for the placebo patients 27% (8/30). HR (24 hours postdose) was not modified by DOX. Patients in the 8-mg regimen had a significantly higher gain in mean body weight (+ 1.3 +/- 0.3 kg; P less than 0.05) compared to the 2-mg regimen, 4-mg regimen, and placebo groups. Plasma norepinephrine was not significantly modified by DOX. DOX had a favorable effect on plasma lipids. DOX lowered LDL cholesterol (P less than 0.05), total cholesterol, and apoprotein B and increased HDL/(LDL + VLDL) ratio (0.05 less than or equal to P less than 0.1) compared to placebo. Dropout rate and treatment-related side effects were equally distributed among the DOX and placebo groups. No patients had the dose of medication reduced because of side effects. Three DOX patients were withdrawn because of postural dizziness.\r"

The subjects were 164 untreated hypertensives with mild hypertension, all of whom had a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure recording, during which their activities were unrestricted. One hundred thirteen performed a treadmill exercise test, and 51 performed two active coping tasks (playing a video game or mental arithmetic). Blood pressure was monitored at baseline and during the tasks. Significant correlations were observed between the absolute levels of pressure measured during the laboratory tests and ambulatory monitoring, but these were higher for the active coping tasks (r = 0.53 to 0.75) than the exercise testing (r = 0.26 to 0.46) and were no higher for pressures measured during the tasks than at baseline. Correlations between the changes of blood pressure during the laboratory tasks and the changes occurring during ambulatory monitoring were analyzed in three ways, using simple, multiple, and canonical correlations. In no case were these correlations substantively significant. We conclude that blood pressure reactivity measured in the laboratory may not be readily generalized to changes of pressure in everyday life, as measured by noninvasive ambulatory recorders.\r"

Blood pressure was measured in 10,446 children two times at an initial screening in school and remeasured two times at a rescreening in 2,808 children from the upper 30 percentiles of the initial screening distribution. Significant hypertension was found in 653 children (6.3%) after the first screening measurement and in 475 children (4.5%) after averaging the first two screening measurements. At the rescreening, the prevalence of significant hypertension was further reduced in this cohort to 1% after one measurement and to 0.8% after averaging the two measurements. The prevalence of significant systolic hypertension had fallen to 0.47% after averaging the two rescreening measurements. These data suggest that the prevalence of significant hypertension is very low in pre-high school children.\r"

Ten hypertensives and six normotensives had a positive family history of hypertension. Ouabain (0.1 mM) and furosemide (0.1 mM) were used to assess the active Na+ efflux and Na+-K+-Cl- pathway. There was no significant difference between hypertensive and normotensive subjects in any of the three pathways studied. Among the 16 subjects with a positive family history of hypertension, the mean value for external Na+-dependent Na+/Na+ exchange was significantly higher than in 24 subjects with no family history of hypertension (0.0457 +/- 0.0337 versus 0.0283 +/- 0.0202; P less than 0.05).

To examine this relationship, investigations were performed in two groups of rats maintained for 6 weeks following 5/6 renal ablation. Group A received converting enzyme inhibition (CEI) for 6 weeks. Group B received no treatment. Systolic blood pressure and weight of remnant kidney tissue were both increased in group B (P less than 0.01). BUN did not differ in groups A and B; however, renal PGI2 excretion was increased in group A (P less than 0.01). Renal morphology was preserved in group A, with little or no evidence of glomerular sclerosis. CEI prevents SHT and enhances renal PGI2 excretion in this model. The selective increase in PGI2 may mediate systemic and renal effects of this agent.\r"

Many studies have been performed in both animal and humans and the major findings are as follows: 1. Most types of myocardial hypertrophy are associated with the decrement in coronary vasodilator reserve; 2. The magnitude of the decrement in coronary reserve in myocardial hypertrophy is usually much more prominent in patients with myocardial hypertrophy than in animal models; 3. Left ventricular hypertrophy secondary to systemic hypertension is associated with altered autoregulation of myocardial perfusion; 4. The perfusion abnormalities associated with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy are affected by various factors such as age of onset, ventricular involvement, and the stimulus for hypertrophy; 5. Left ventricular hypertrophy secondary to renal hypertension markedly augments the adverse effects of coronary occlusion. In this setting, coronary occlusion is associated with a three-fold increase in the incidence of lethal ventricular arrhythmias and a 35% increase in infarct size. Thus, pressure-induced hypertrophy profoundly alters the coronary circulation.\r"

National data showed no decline in the number and rates of amputations from 1981-1985, but the frequency of bypass surgery increased indicating that the problem of peripheral arterial occlusive disease is far from being resolved. Femoral/popliteal bypasses are performed twice as often as aorto/ileac procedures but failure rates are high. Based on observations of 238 amputees we noted that femoral/popliteal bypasses had the highest failure rate, particularly when performed as a last limbsaving effort. A laudable trend of preserving the knee was noted but poor stump conditions were the most important factors influencing the length of hospital stay (average 51 days). The amputee rehabilitation process is discussed along with a description of contemporary prosthetic technology. The cost effectiveness of state of the art devices for the older dysvascular amputee is questioned. The cost of amputation and rehabilitation is enormous, especially when preceded by unsuccessful arterial reconstruction. The loss of a leg is, of course, a major disaster for every individual and therefore limbsaving efforts and amputation techniques must be refined and the rehabilitation effort optimized.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty patients admitted to hospital with congestive heart failure were evaluated for severe concomitant lumbosacral and leg pain. In each instance the discomfort was worse at night and progressively decreased with a resolution of the pulmonary edema. Neurologic and electromyographic examinations in all but four patients were normal with reflexes, strength and straight leg raising testing normal. An absent Achilles reflex was recognized in two, a diminished knee jerk reflex in one and in a third, weakness in the extensor hallucis longus. Lumbar spinal stenosis was identified in all of the patients with a concomitant degenerative spondylolisthesis present in nine instances and in an additional two a spondylolisthesis with interruption of the neural arch. It is theorized that diminished right heart compliance can induce a sufficient increase in venous volume and pressure within the paravertebral plexus of Batson to acutely exacerbate a chronic lumbar spinal stenosis. In support of this hypothesis, the multiple factors involved in the pathomechanics and physiology of lumbar radiculopathy, spinal stenosis and the role of the paravertebral plexus of veins are examined. Specifically, their response to altered volume and pressure gradients tending to induce venous \"creep\" as well to alterations in posture and diurnal cycles are reviewed.\r"

Her vital capacity during this episode was 600 mL and she was in impending respiratory failure. The diaphragmatic paralysis was demonstrated by radiographic plain films and fluoroscopy. Phrenic nerve stimulation was performed during fluoroscopy and the evoked motor response from the diaphragm recorded. There was a normal amplitude diaphragmatic twitch observed with an evoked motor response latency of 1 ms and amplitude of 300 microV. After high dose intravenous steroids, her neck stiffness and spasticity improved, her vital capacity improved to 1500 mL and her diaphragm regained its normal position and movement confirmed by followup radiographic plain films and fluoroscopy. We postulate the presence of a demyelinating plaque in the brainstem fibers descending to the phrenic nucleus as the etiology of the diaphragmatic paralysis. We are unaware of any other case reports of unilateral \"upper motor neuron\" phrenic nerve paralysis secondary to multiple sclerosis.\r"

The peroneal nerve was stimulated supramaximally at the fibular head and the compound muscle action potential was recorded from the extensor digitorum brevis muscle. Averaged tracings from 32 consecutive stimuli were obtained. The averaged F-wave latency (Fp) and M-wave latency (Mp) were measured from the stimulating artifact to the peak of the waves. The distance (D) between the stimulating point and the T12 spinous process was measured. The value of a-FWCV was calculated as 2D/(Fp-Mp-1) m/second. In normal subjects, the average value of a-FWCV was 56 +/- 4, and there was no significant difference between males and females, nor between the right and left sides. The differences among the tests administered at different times on the same subject were also statistically insignificant. Of the 22 patients, 17 had subnormal value of a-FWCV if the lower normal limits were defined as mean minus 2.5 SD (i.e., 46 m/second) calculated from the normal control value. However, only one of them had subnormal value of FWCV calculated by the conventional method (without averaging technique). All the patients with two root (L5 + S1) involvement had subnormal a-FWCV. It is concluded that the a-FWCV is a more sensitive measure than the conventional FWCV in the assessment of L5 radiculopathy.\r"

Despite previous anecdotal reports and expert opinion to the contrary, no overall differences were found between the two types of orthoses. Several specific differences were revealed, however; most children preferred the PM orthoses, saying they were lighter and more easily donned and doffed; the PM orthoses also controlled hip and knee sagittal motion and foot valgus/varus during gait more effectively. Individual biomechanical, neuromuscular and psychologic attributes of the disabled child must be carefully matched with the technical attributes of each orthotic option to effect an optimal prescription.\r"

An histological study was undertaken on the hypothesis that, in a given individual, if the most clinically atypical naevus is not histologically dysplastic it is unlikely that any of the others are. The most clinically atypical naevus in each patient was biopsied. Estimated in this way the prevalence of dysplastic naevi in patients with non-familial CM was only 18%. Comparison of patients with and without dysplastic naevi did not suggest that they constituted two different subsets. An attempt to correlate clinical diagnosis and histological features in this group of patients showed that the diagnosis of dysplastic naevi on the basis of clinical criteria alone is difficult and not reliable.\r"

Because of the uncorrectable fetal conditions or the parents' reluctance to terminate the pregnancy, no interventions were undertaken and eventually all eight fetuses died in utero. The interval between the abnormal waveform recording and fetal death was between 1 and 7 days (mean 3.6 days). In two fetuses with abnormal diastolic flow, analysis of umbilical vein blood obtained by ultrasound-guided sampling revealed moderately severe acidosis and hypoxia (pH 7.228 and 7.241, PCO2 47.5 and 46.9 mmHg; PO2 14.6 and 14.7 mmHg, respectively). Our observation suggests that once the diastolic component of UA flow velocity waveforms becomes absent or reversed, the fetus is in a state of hypoxia and acidosis and fetal death is impending. This limited experience may help in formulating clinical management when using UA flow velocity waveforms in the monitoring of high-risk fetuses.\r"

Of the Kielland's forceps deliveries, 15% were performed by a specialist, compared with 41% of the vacuum extractions. There were no differences in maternal morbidity overall, but when groups of operators were compared maternal complications were more frequent in the forceps group with the less experienced operators. There was little early neonatal morbidity (as judged by Apgar score, intubation, admission to the special care baby unit, jaundice and abnormal neurological behaviour) but cephalhaematoma occurred significantly more often in babies born by the ventouse than by Kielland's forceps. There were no perinatal deaths.\r"

On average, over a 30-min period, 48% of the 125I-AVP appeared to have been metabolized. With one exception, a patient whose labour was augmented with intravenous oxytocin, no 125I-AVP apparently crossed the placental lobule to the fetal circulation. These data indicate that the human placenta has a considerable capacity to degrade AVP.\r"

Clonal chromosome abnormalities were observed initially in 11 patients (17%) and later during the course of the disease in another 20 patients. An abnormal karyotype was found in 71% to 80% of the patients who were examined after the development of myeloid metaplasia, myelofibrosis, or leukemia. Patients treated with myelosuppressive agents showed a significantly greater risk of chromosome abnormalities developing than did patients who had been phlebotomized. Acute leukemia developed in eight patients, all of whom had been treated with myelosuppressive agents. A chromosome abnormality preceded the leukemia in only two of the patients. The initial presence of an abnormal karyotype did not predict a greater risk of development of leukemia. No consistent relationship was demonstrated between the occurrence of chromosome abnormalities and the development of myeloid metaplasia and/or myelofibrosis, which was observed in 42% of the patients. The chromosome abnormalities followed a nonrandom pattern, and those most frequently observed were trisomies for 1 q, 8, 9, or 9p and deletion of 20q. Deletions seem to be common and were found in 14 patients.\r"

However, among other patients with hemolytic diseases (six having AIHA and three each having either hereditary spherocytosis, elliptocytosis, or lead poisoning) as well as among control subjects, no antibody activity to protein 4.1 was observed. In addition to the anti-protein 4.1 antibody, two different kinds of anti-erythrocyte antibodies were detected by conventional serological studies in this patient. One of them was an anti-Ena-like antibody in the eluate from the patient's erythrocytes, while another was the anti-S-specific antibody in the plasma. An elution study and an absorption study using S antigen-positive erythrocytes demonstrated that the anti-protein 4.1 antibody differed from both the anti-Ena-like antibody and the anti-S antibody. Familial analysis of the patient revealed the same antibody in her brother, who did not have hemolytic anemia. These results demonstrate that anti-protein 4.1 antibody is considered to be included in the spectrum of anti-cytoskeleton autoantibodies, which have been observed in patients having increased cell lysis as well as in healthy subjects.\r"

With cultured mast cells (CMCs), we analyzed the mechanism of mast-cell deficiency in tissues of W/Wv mice. CMCs were established from bone marrow cells of W/Wv and congenic +/+ mice with PWM-SCM, and then co-cultured with various mouse fibroblast cell lines without PWM-SCM. All the examined mouse embryo-derived fibroblast cell lines maintained CMCs derived from +/+ mice, but not CMCs from W/Wv mice, for greater than 2 weeks. Mast cells in S phase were observed only in CMCs derived from +/+ mice under these conditions. The poor survival of W/Wv CMCs as compared with +/+ CMCs was not owing to a differential death rate but to the inability of W/Wv CMCs to continue active proliferation on fibroblasts without PWM-SCM. By synchronizing CMCs at the G1 phase of the cell cycle, the defect in W/Wv CMCs was further characterized as a failure to transit G1 and enter the S phase upon contact with fibroblasts. This finding indicates the indispensable function of the W gene product(s) for this response.\r"

Nine gamma gene triplications from seven ethnic groups were analyzed for G gamma and hemoglobin F (Hb F) values of heterozygotes and for the presence of polymorphic XmnI restriction sites 5' to the gamma genes. Four categories of triplication were found: I had low G gamma and low Hb F values and lacked XmnI sites 5' to the three gamma genes [---]. II had high G gamma and slightly elevated Hb F values but was also [---]. III was similar to II, except that XmnI was [+--]. IV had very high G gamma and slightly elevated Hb F values, and XmnI was [++-]. One case each of triplications I and IV were cloned into Charon 35. For both, the two 5' gamma gene code for G gamma chain, while the 3' gamma gene codes for A gamma chain. DNA sequencing showed that the unequal crossover occurred between 472 and 398 base pairs (bp) 5' to the gamma gene Cap sites (-472 and -398) for the type IV triplication and between -271 and codon 136 for the type I triplication. In addition, type I had a 4-bp deletion of AGCA from -225 to -222. The high G gamma values of the type IV triplication are explained by its -G gamma-G gamma-A gamma-gene arrangement and the XmnI sites 5' to the G gamma genes. We hypothesize that the low G gamma value of the type I triplication, which is also -G gamma-G gamma-A gamma-, is due to inactivation of the middle G gamma gene by the AGCA deletion at -225 to -222.\r"

  ".W": "Oxidants released from inflammatory cells contribute to the pathogenesis of acute inflammatory edema in many models. Chemically produced oxidants can reversibly alter the barrier properties of cultured endothelial and epithelial monolayers. This report examines the effects of nonlytic doses of H2O2 on endothelial cell lipids. H2O2 oxidized omega-6 fatty acids in the endothelial cells and initiated hydrolysis of endothelial cell phospholipids. When endothelial cells were exposed to peroxidized linoleic acid, it caused lysis of the cells at doses 1,000-fold lower than effective doses of H2O2. The phospholipid hydrolysis was directed primarily at the inositol phospholipids and consisted of both A and C type phospholipase activity. The phospholipase A hydrolysis resulted in increases in endothelial cell free fatty acids and lysophosphatidylinositol. The phospholipase C hydrolysis resulted in increases in diglycerides, phosphatidic acid, and inositol polyphosphate levels. The phospholipase C hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol is known to activate protein kinase C in most cells. Stimulation of protein kinase C with phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate increased albumin flux across endothelial monolayers and altered endothelial cell shape, similar to effects of oxidants. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that oxidant-initiated hydrolysis of endothelial cell inositol phospholipids contributes to oxidant-mediated reversible changes in endothelial monolayer barrier function.\r"

This study examined DAF expression on hematopoietic progenitors from normal individuals and PNH patients using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) with monoclonal antibodies to DAF. Nonphagocytic mononuclear marrow cells expressing different density distributions of DAF were sorted into DAF-, DAF+/-, DAF+, and DAF++ fractions. The cells from each fraction were cultured in methylcellulose and assayed for CFU-E, BFU-E, CFU-GM, and CFU-Mix. The percentages of distribution of DAF-negative normal progenitors increased in the order of CFU-E, CFU-GM, BFU-E, and CFU-Mix, whereas those of DAF-positive cells inversely decreased in this order. These results indicate that DAF expression may accompany differentiation from CFU-Mix to CFU-E. On the other hand, most progenitors in PNH patients had little, if any, expression of DAF on their cell surfaces. These findings were supported by another approach using a complement-dependent cytotoxicity method with the anti-DAF monoclonal antibodies. Abnormal expression of DAF was found on the progenitors in the bone marrow as well as on mature cells circulating in the blood in PNH.\r"

Sequence analysis of the delta +thal gene showed a G----T substitution at the first nucleotide of codon 27 (delta +27) which produces an amino acid change (Ala----Ser) and presumably activates a cryptic splice site located at this position. Therefore, only a fraction of the transcript is processed from this site, as indicated by the clinical phenotype of delta +thal. DNA sequencing of the delta zero thal gene revealed a T----C substitution at position 1 of IVS-1, which abolishes the splicing at this site and thus leads to complete deficiency of normal mRNA explaining the clinical phenotype of delta zero thal. Oligonucleotide analysis was used to confirm the coinheritance of the delta +27 mutation in a group of Sardinians with thalassemia like phenotype and normal HbA2 level who, on the basis of genetic criteria, were supposed to be double heterozygous for delta-thalassemia and beta-thalassemia. The definition of delta-thalassemia defects in each high-risk area facilitates identification of double heterozygotes for delta- and beta-thalassemia by DNA analysis and may thus improve genetic counseling.\r"

Southern blotting and in situ chromosomal hybridization studies in one patient with the t(7;11) demonstrated that both alleles of the T-cell antigen receptor beta-subunit gene (TCRB) were rearranged, and that one TCRB allele had relocated from 7q35 to the fusion point in band p13 of the involved chromosome 11 (11p-). These findings suggest that juxtaposition of TCRB with the putative oncogene tcl-2 located in band 11p13 may be a critical step toward development of this T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. In the other two translocations, all breakpoints were sites for lymphocyte function genes, ie, 7q35 for TCRB, 14q11 for T-cell antigen receptor alpha-subunit gene (TCRA), 7p15 for T-cell antigen receptor alpha-subunit gene (TCRG), and 14q32 for immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene (IGH). Thus, the findings in these cases allow us to expand the above hypothesis and propose that the juxtaposition of TCRB or TCRG with tcl-2, TCRA, or IGH through chromosomal translocation may activate a mechanism for the genesis of T-cell leukemia/lymphoma with these chromosome translocations.\r"

  ".W": "The transformation of less-dense, discoidal homozygous sickle cells (HbSS) RBCs into dehydrated, rheologically impaired cells is believed to be an important factor in the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease. We investigated this process by subjecting the less-dense fraction of HbSS RBCs, which contains a low percentage of irreversibly sickled cells (ISCs), to cyclic deoxygenation-reoxygenation for 15 hours at 37 degrees C. This incubation procedure caused cell shrinkage, shifts in intracellular Na and K content, and formation of ISCs that closely resembled endogenous ISCs found in sickle blood. The viscoelasticity of the treated cells was tested using micropipette techniques to measure the membrane shear elastic modulus (mu) and the time constant for extensional shape recovery (tc); mu represents the \"static rigidity\" of the cells, and the product mu.tc was taken as a measure of their \"dynamic rigidity\". Density separation of the incubated cells showed that their rheologic impairment (ie, elevation of both static and dynamic rigidities) paralleled cellular dehydration and that the newly formed dense cells had viscoelastic characteristics very similar to those of endogenous dense cells. Rehydration by osmotic swelling tended to normalize the dynamic rigidities of dense cells but had no significant effect on their static rigidities. Thus, cellular dehydration contributes to the observed changes of viscoelasticity, although an irreversible alteration of membrane structure also appears to be involved. Dense ISCs could be formed without added calcium, implying that entry of external calcium is not an essential requirement for cellular dehydration; ISCs formed without calcium tended to be less rigid (ie, to have lower static and dynamic rigidities) than those formed with calcium. Our results indicate that the cyclic incubation procedure closely mimics RBC rheologic deterioration in vivo and thus suggest its usefulness as a model for investigating this phenomenon.\r"

Thus, the purified cell fraction consisted of greater than 90% myeloma cells, even when as little as 15% myeloma cells were contained in bone marrow mononuclear cell fraction, determined by morphological and immunologic examinations. With highly purified myeloma cells from 29 patients with IgG type MM, biologic characteristics such as spontaneous proliferation (3H-TdR uptake) and M-protein secretion rate in vitro were evaluated. Both activities varied among patients within stage I and III, and a 3H-TdR uptake of 255-24, 132 cpm/4 x 10(4) cells, and an M-protein secretion rate of 9 to 72 pg/cell/day, respectively, were recorded. However, in each patient, there was no correlation between 3H-TdR uptake and M-protein secretion rate. These results thus suggest that 3H-TdR uptake and M-protein secretion rate of highly purified myeloma cells are independent biologic parameters, not associated with the clinical stages, and the purification of myeloma cells we describe can contribute to further studies on the biologic characteristics and to understanding of the pathophysiology involved in MM.\r"

  ".W": "Endothelial cells are centrally involved in regulation of fibrinolysis, and receptors for plasminogen and urokinase provide a mechanism by which cells can regulate their fibrinolytic function. Therefore, the existence and characteristics of receptors for these fibrinolytic components on cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells were examined. We verified the presence of plasminogen receptors on these cells (Kd = 2.1 +/- 1.3 mumol/L, and 1.8 +/- 1.3 x 10(7) binding sites/cell). These binding parameters and other characteristics indicate that these receptors are closely related to the plasminogen receptors on many circulating and adherent cells. Specific binding sites that interact with two-chain urokinase of mol wt 55,000 with a dissociation constant of 2.1 +/- 1.7 nmol/L, with 2.9 +/- 2.9 x 10(5) sites/cell were also identified. Single-chain urokinase of mol wt 55,000, but not the two-chain degradation product of mol wt 33,000 bound to the cells, implicating the amino-terminal aspects of the ligand in receptor recognition. When endothelial cells were stimulated with thrombin, an agent that modulates their fibrinolytic potential, both receptor types were modestly affected; urokinase binding increased 17%, whereas plasminogen binding decreased 19%. The presence and modulation of plasminogen and urokinase receptors provide a potentially important additional mechanism by which endothelial cells may regulate fibrinolysis.\r"

Genomic southern analysis indicated that the individual was heterozygous for a deletion that began within the second intervening sequence of the beta-globin gene and extended approximately 1.4 kb in the 5' direction. A clone spanning the breakpoint on the abnormal chromosome was isolated and further mapped, and the deletion joint was sequenced. Comparison of the normal beta-globin gene and its 5' flanking region with the deletion joint sequence indicated that the 5' breakpoint for this deletion was 484 base pairs (bp) 5' to the transcriptional start site for the beta-globin gene and the 3' breakpoint was 908 bp into the beta-globin gene; the deletion removed a total of 1,393 bp. Comparison of the normal 5' and 3' breakpoint sequences indicated that this deletion was the result of a \"clean\" nonhomologous breakage and reunion event; ie, no spurious bases were added during the recombinational event. Analysis of the breakpoints of this deletion together with the breakpoints of two other small deletions involving the beta-globin gene suggests that the breakpoints may occur at DNA polymerase alpha pause sites.\r"

Healthy volunteers (n = 25) and patients with malignant and nonmalignant disorders (n = 58) served as controls. The following observations were made in CLL. (a) Anti-cCLLa MoAbs identified neoplastic CLL cells as judged by the high correlation (r = .985) between monoclonal surface immunoglobulins (Slgs) and cCLLa expression in all patients, and dual-label flow cytometry studies showing cCLLa expression by monoclonal Slg-bearing B-CLL cells but not by normal B lymphocytes. (b) The size of the circulating cCLLa-positive clone paralleled the degree of lymphocytosis (r = .987) and was associated with reciprocal (r = .893) relative T lymphopenia. Ten patients with borderline lymphocytosis exhibited a subset of monoclonal Slg/cCLLa-positive cells ranging from 16% to 45% of the total. These patients were indistinguishable from those with CLL in terms of age, clone lineage, and reciprocal relative T lymphopenia. Two patients have progressed to overt CLL within 19 months, but eight have not (observation time, 18 to 82 months). These data suggest that anti-cCLLa MoAbs are sensitive probes useful to identify and monitor cCLLa clones during their clinical and preclinical phases.\r"

  ".W": "A significant number of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma have peripheral blood involvement during the course of their disease. Because the expression of receptor for the lectin peanut agglutinin PNA by normal lymphocytes is associated with noncirculating (stationary phase) cells, we studied the relationship between PNA binding by lymphoma cells and the presence of clonal B cells in the blood of 38 patients with B-cell lymphoma. The binding of PNA by cells in tissues was determined by the immunoperoxidase method and by two-color flow cytometry. Circulating lymphoma cells (clonal B cells) were identified by a sensitive flow-cytometric technique (kappa-lambda analysis) and were also studied for PNA binding in some cases. In all, 16 of 38 (42%) of lymphomas were PNA+, including a spectrum of histologic types. Circulating lymphoma cells were demonstrated in 17 of 22 PNA-lymphomas, whereas only 3 of 16 of PNA+ lymphomas had such circulating cells. Thus, there is a significant association between PNA binding and peripheral blood involvement by lymphoma (P less than .005 by chi-square analysis). In 12 cases, the circulating and tissue lymphoma cells had similar expression of PNA receptor (2 PNA+ and 10 PNA- cases), indicating that modulation of the PNA binding sites did not occur. In three patients who presented with lymphosarcoma cell leukemia, the circulating malignant cells were PNA-. These findings suggest that for both normal and malignant lymphocytes the absence of binding sites for PNA is associated with the capacity of these cells to circulate freely.\r"

  ".W": "Human platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb and IIIa (GPIIb and IIIa) were incorporated into phospholipid vesicles by the reverse-phase technique to assess the ability of GPIIb and IIIa to function as a Ca2+ channel. Movement of Ca2+ across the lipid bilayer was quantitated by injection of proteoliposomes with encapsulated Fura-2 into Ca2+ buffers and measurement of Fura-2 fluorescence as an indicator of Ca2+ influx. Reciprocally, to assess the function of proteins in an inside-out orientation, Ca2+-loaded vesicles were injected into Ca2+-free buffer and Ca2+ efflux monitored by a calcium electrode. Incorporation of the IIb-IIIa complex produced significant facilitation of Ca2+ movement across the lipid bilayer. No net transmembrane Ca2+ movement was seen with dissociated IIb and IIIa. Movement of Ca2+ was proportional to the transmembrane Ca2+ gradient. Ca2+ movement into the vesicles was inversely proportional to extravesicular NaCl from 25 to 150 mmol/L, analogous to several studies in the intact platelet. Adenosine triphosphate had no effect on Ca2+ movement into or out of the vesicles. Specific inhibition of a Ca2+ shift into the vesicles was seen with M148, a monoclonal antibody to IIb/IIIa, while no inhibition was observed with a panel of other anti-IIb/IIIa monoclonal antibodies. This suggests that a specific site on the complex or orientation of the complex is essential for calcium channel function. These data demonstrate that the GPIIb/IIIa complex can serve as a passive Ca2+ channel across a phospholipid bilayer and has the potential to play a role in Ca2+ flux across the platelet plasma membrane.\r"

The authors studied simultaneous changes in platelet cytosolic Ca2+ (Cai) and the polymerization state of actin as related to the shape. Platelet concentrates were stored under blood bank conditions for up to 10 days. Aliquots were removed and analyzed as follows: platelet Cai and increments in Cai induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) were determined by fluorescence of fura-2-loaded cells; loss of disc shape was determined by differences in light scattering intensity induced by stirring; and the ratio of globular and total actin (G/T) of platelets in plasma was determined by a modification of the DNase inhibition assay. Globular actin was found to be 86 +/- 3% of total actin in freshly drawn platelets suspended in plasma. The following changes occurred during storage: G/T in platelet concentrates increased from 63 +/- 5 (day 0) to 74 +/- 2% in the first 24 hours then fell to 33 +/- 6% by day 10. The percent discoid platelets also increased from day 0 to day 1 then fell in the ensuing days. There was an initial drop in Cai from day 0 to day 1, after which Cai increased on days 3 and 6. Globular actin polymerization during storage closely correlated with the change in percent discs (r = 0.95). During 6 days of storage Cai was highly correlated with shape change (r = 0.97) and to a lesser extent (r = 0.87) with the ratio of globular actin. The authors conclude that actin polymerization, shape, and Ca2+ change in a related fashion during storage.\r"

The late occurrence of the apparent relapse suggested that the second lymphoma might be caused by a separate malignant transformation in a discrete clone of B cells. Although both tumors expressed the same immunologic surface markers (mu k) and carried the same t(8;14) translocation, Southern blot analysis of DNA from each tumor, using specific restriction endonucleases and probes to the c-myc and the immunoglobulin heavy chain loci, demonstrated that the chromosomal breakpoints relevant to the translocations differed between the tumors. This was corroborated by analysis of the immunoglobulin light-chain rearrangements in the two tumors. These observations indicate that the second tumor was not a recurrence of the first but represented the malignant transformation of a different clone of B cells. Thus late relapses of certain malignancies in individuals at high risk may be caused by the malignant transformation of discrete cell clones (i.e., induction of a new tumor).\r"

The data indicate a change in codon 114 from CTG (Leu) to -GG that resulted in a frameshift and the presumed synthesis of an abnormal beta chain that is 156 residues long with a completely different C-terminal amino acid sequence. The change in codon 114 gives a -GGGCCC- sequence that creates a new ApaI site; the resulting 2.6-kilobase fragment has been observed in all subjects with this thalassemia condition. Protein structural analyses failed to demonstrate any trace of the abnormal beta chain, even in reticulocytes and nucleated red cells that were isolated by density gradient centrifugation. The inclusion bodies appear to contain mainly normal alpha chains. It is assumed that the structure of the beta-Geneva chain prevents it from combining with normal alpha chains; this results in a rapid breakdown of the abnormal protein during the early stages of red cell maturation and an accumulation of free alpha chains.\r"

Unchanged, 51Cr-tagged red cell survival and lack of radioactivity in the stool or urine suggests that the EPA stimulation of erythropoiesis was not due to hemolysis or bleeding. Thus, EPA has an effect on erythropoiesis in anemic mice in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Activation of 32P-loaded neutrophils with phorbol myristate acetate causes the labeling of a family of three 48K proteins that focus near neutral pH. The relationship between these phosphoproteins and the activation of the respiratory burst has been supported by the previous finding that phosphorylation was defective in the two most common types of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD): X-linked cytochrome-negative (X/-) and autosomal cytochrome-positive (A/+). In this report, these studies have now been extended to the rare A/- and X/+ forms of the disease. In all three patients with A/- CGD examined, the two most acidic 48K proteins failed to undergo enhanced phosphorylation in response to phorbol stimulation, a finding similar to that seen in X/- patients. In contrast, neutrophils from two patients with X/+ CGD appeared to phosphorylate the neutral 48K proteins in a normal fashion. It thus appears that the different phosphorylation patterns seen in chronic granulomatous disease are a reflection of the genetic heterogeneity of this disorder. These findings lend further support to the conclusion that the 48K phosphoprotein family is related to the respiratory burst, although not necessarily in a straightforward manner.\r"

Genomic DNA clones spanning 35 kilobase (kb) pairs of the FIXLB gene were isolated. A gene analysis strategy that specifically characterized exons and their flanking intron sequences predicted the entire amino acid sequence of FIXLB. A thymine to cytosine transition causes the substitution of a threonine codon (ACA) for an isoleucine codon (ATA) in exon VIII of the FIXLB gene. This mutation results in an amino acid substitution at residue 397 of the FIX zymogen and the phenotypic display of hemophilia-B. Previous studies revealed that activated purified FIXLB (FIXaLB) had normal Ca2+, phospholipid, and factor VIIIa binding characteristics. However, FIXaLB activated factor X or factor VII (with their cofactors Ca2+ and phospholipid) at significantly reduced rates, suggesting that the defect in FIXaLB lies near or within the catalytic triad of the FIX heavy chain. Identification of an amino acid substitution near the carboxy-terminus of the FIXaLB heavy chain supports the earlier characterization of this variant protein. Moreover, our data identify a residue in the catalytic domain of FIXa essential for normal function.\r"

Patients who develop reactive arthritis after Yersinia enteritis show several interesting features in the immunological defence against Yersinia when compared to those who recover uneventfully. When all these peculiarities are taken together, they strongly indicate that in the patients developing reactive arthritis the causative microorganism enters host tissues to persist within the body for prolonged periods of time.\r"

It displays strong correlations between various trace elements like Zn and Sr, and Sr and Na. The biplot also suggests concentration relationships which could play a hitherto unknown role in the genesis of calculi.

There were 7 late exclusions. The incidence of UTI in the control and antibiotic groups was 16 and 17% respectively. No blood cultures were positive. There were no significant differences in the incidence of fever between the two groups. A break in the closed drainage system occurred in 13 patients. Fifteen of the 93 developed UTI. A break in the closed drainage system occurred in 7 of the 15 patients (40%) with UTI. Of the 78 patients without UTI, 8 had a break (10%). This difference was highly significant. We recommend that less emphasis be placed on prophylactic antibiotics and more on avoiding breakage of the closed system in the prevention of UTI after transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) in the low risk situation.\r"

Forty-eight patients underwent cystoscopy alone and 52 underwent urethral dilatation. The two groups were well matched with regard to age, parity, menopausal status, previous gynaecological surgery and severity of symptoms. A significant improvement in symptoms was observed in both groups after treatment: 30% had no residual symptoms, 50% were improved and 20% were no better. However, no difference in final outcome was observed between those who had undergone cystoscopy alone and those who had undergone urethral dilatation. Furthermore, 7 patients who underwent urethral dilatation experienced transient stress incontinence of urine, a complication not observed in women who underwent cystoscopy alone. No benefit was observed from the addition of urethral dilatation to cystoscopy alone in women with recurrent frequency and dysuria.\r"

Of 110 consecutive male patients who underwent cystectomy during a 9-year period, 9 had or developed a urethral tumour. Five patients undergoing radical cystectomy had known or suspected urethral involvement which was confirmed at urethrectomy. All 5 had deeply invasive (T3 or T4) transitional cell carcinomas of the bladder and subsequently died of metastatic disease. Four patients underwent urethrectomy because of signs or symptoms of urethral recurrence at an average interval of 2.5 years after cystectomy. There were two deaths in this group, neither of which appeared to be due to urethral recurrence. Six additional patients had undergone prophylactic urethrectomy because of prostatic urethral involvement or diffuse carcinoma in situ in the cystectomy specimen, and none had identifiable tumour in the anterior urethra. The residual urethra is a potential focus for recurrent tumour and this necessitates careful follow-up with serial cytology, but the low incidence of urethral recurrence (3.5% in this series) does not appear to warrant routine urethrectomy at the time of cystectomy.\r"

Patients with testis cancer frequently report prior testicular trauma, but this trauma may have triggered diagnosis of the tumor rather than been aetiological. In this study, the frequencies of various prior traumatic and temperature exposures in 259 patients with testis cancer were compared with their frequencies in two sets of control patients who did not have testis cancer. Particular effort was made to prevent bias. Testis cancer was not significantly associated with any temperature or trauma exposure and the confidence limits of the findings excluded substantially raised risks. The evidence suggests that raised temperatures and traumas commonly encountered in everyday life are not important risk factors for testis cancer. The possible aetiological roles of extreme trauma sufficient to cause atrophy, and of the trauma and raised temperature which can occur in cryptorchidism, however, need investigation by other methods.\r"

The median follow-up time was 40+ months. Thirteen patients (28%) relapsed, predominantly in retroperitoneum and/or lung. Ten of these relapses (76%) occurred within 8 months of orchiectomy. Relapses occurred in 7/35 T1 tumours and 5/10 T2 to T4 tumours. No correlation was detected between the histological type and relapse rate. Three late relapses were diagnosed at 23, 29 and 36 months. Eleven of the relapsed patients remain in prolonged complete remission after PVB chemotherapy +/- surgery; one patient, who initially refused treatment at the time of relapse, has died. Another relapsed with predominant elements of rhabdomyosarcoma intermingled with malignant teratoma in a bone metastasis. He had a partial response to PVB chemotherapy but subsequently died. Thirty-four patients (74%) did not undergo lymphography (LG) and had a higher relapse rate (11/34) than those who had LG (2/12); this was not a statistically significant difference in this small series. The policy of active surveillance is not yet the \"state of the art\" and should be under constant scrutiny with respect to safety and practice.\r"

GABA content of 5 areas of the cerebral cortex and the cerebellar cortex was measured postmortem in the brains of 23 Alzheimer and 19 control subjects and 5 patients with other causes of dementia. Fourteen of these specimens, including 7 from patients with Alzheimer's disease of 8 yrs mean duration, were obtained within 3 h of death. These were processed in a similar manner to the neurosurgical specimens and are regarded also as fresh tissue samples. The remaining 33 specimens are regarded as conventional postmortem samples as the mean interval of death to autopsy was 21 h. GABA concentration in conventional autopsy specimens from Alzheimer subjects was not reduced as compared with controls in either cingulate or cerebellar cortex. In the inferior parietal cortex, agonal status confounded this comparison. The concentration was reduced in superior parietal, frontal and temporal cortex but there is a possibility that agonal state also confounded these comparisons. There was no deficit in GABA concentration in fresh cortical tissue from Alzheimer patients except for the temporal lobe from autopsy specimens. The content of somatostatin-like immunoreactivity was, like GABA, found to be comparable to control in some groups of Alzheimer specimens. It is argued that the deficits in autopsy samples and lack of change in surgical specimens is likely to be due to the duration of illness at the time of sampling. Losses of choline acetyltransferase activity were observed in all groups of Alzheimer specimens in all areas of brain studied. The data are consistent with other results which suggest that cholinergic under-activity is most closely related to the clinical course of Alzheimer's disease.\r"
