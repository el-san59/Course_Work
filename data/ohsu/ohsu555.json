CBF measured 1 to 4 hours after arrest with the use of 133Xe intravenous was significantly greater with nimodipine than with placebo (27 +/- 3 versus 13 +/- 1 ml.100 g-1.min-1 at 3 hours), but with no significant difference at 24 hours. There was no clinical evidence of seriously increased CSFP in any patient in either group the first 48 hours. Mean arterial pressure was significantly lower (86 +/- 4 versus 101 +/- 4 mm Hg at 3 hours), and antiarrhythmic drugs were used significantly less frequently in the nimodipine group than in the placebo group. Twelve patients in each group eventually regained consciousness. There was no significant difference in neurologic status between the two groups at any point, and no positive correlation between CBF in the hypoperfusion period and neurologic outcome.\r"

Simulations were videotaped, and the response times for detecting and initiating correction of the problems were measured. Different problems had significantly different response characteristics. Breathing circuit disconnection and cardiac arrest were quickly detected (21 +/- 17 seconds; 7 +/- 5 seconds), and correction was begun quickly, although major errors in managing the cardiac arrest occurred in 58% of cases. Endobronchial intubation and atrial fibrillation took longer than the other problems to detect (105 +/- 142 seconds; 111 +/- 158 seconds) and to correct (555 +/- 358 seconds; 365 +/- 121 seconds). Intravenous kink was detected more slowly (238 +/- 269 seconds) but once discovered was quickly corrected. The response of different individuals was highly variable; experience level was a significant factor for correction (P = 0.03) but not for detection of problems overall. Because of high individual variation, experience was not a significant factor in correcting any signal problem. The data suggest that some types of problems are harder to handle than others and that individuals vary widely in their problem-handling abilities. Experience is a beneficial factor in anesthesia problem solving but not in a simple fashion. Vigilant detection of problems is only the first step in a complex response pathway that might be strengthened by improved protocols and repeated practice.\r"

Succinylcholine concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically, and mivacurium concentrations were determined with a high-pressure liquid chromatographic assay. The hydrolysis of mivacurium in plasma followed first-order kinetics, and the rate of hydrolysis decreased as plasma was serially diluted. The Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) for mivacurium metabolism in plasma was 245 mumol/L, and the maximum velocity (Vmax) was 50 U/L; the Km for succinylcholine was 37 mumol/L, and Vmax was 74 U/L. At comparable multiples of the Km the hydrolysis rate of mivacurium was 70% of that of succinylcholine. Mivacurium was metabolized significantly in solutions containing butyrylcholinesterase, but only minimally in solutions containing acetylcholinesterase.\r"

The day-to-day variation in resting energy expenditure (REE) was studied over a 3-5-day period in 17 postoperative mechanically ventilated critically ill patients to gain insight as to how often caloric intake should be reassessed, whether changes observed over 3-5 days are of sufficient magnitude to make frequent adjustments in caloric intake, and what factors are associated with large alterations in metabolic rate. REE was measured daily for 3-5 days, and the percent variation in REE [(highest REE--lowest daily REE)/(lowest daily REE) x 100] calculated. The variation ranged from 4 to 56%, and on further analysis two distinct groups were identified, one with a mean variation of 12 +/- 4% (SD) (range 4-18%) and the other with a mean variation of 46 +/- 8% (range 37-56%). The former group was clinically stable, whereas the latter was not. Clinically stable patients need less frequent measurements than those who are more ill, but when designing a nutritional regimen for them, at least 20-25% should be added to the REE, 15% to account for day-to-day variation and 5-10% for activity.\r"

Twenty patients were prospectively randomized into two groups; one given 10 mg sublingual nifedipine after weaning from bypass, the other given a placebo. Coronary graft blood flow was measured under blinded conditions and graft resistance calculated from measurements obtained with an electromagnetic flow probe applied directly to the graft prior to and 15 minutes after drug administration. Serum nifedipine levels were determined immediately before and 15, 30, and 60 minutes after sublingual administration. All patients receiving nifedipine had therapeutic serum levels. Graft resistance in patients given nifedipine decreased a statistically significant average of 27% and increased slightly, but not statistically significantly so, in patients given sublingual placebos. There were no differences between the two groups in cardiac index or pulmonary capillary wedge pressures. We conclude that the administration of sublingual nifedipine to patients in the immediate postbypass period results in therapeutic serum nifedipine levels and decreases coronary graft resistance without affecting cardiac performance.\r"

In the present study, we used dobutamine to increase cardiac index and measured the pulmonary hemodynamic effects in 10 patients with increased pulmonary vascular tone following mitral valve replacement. Using increasing doses of dobutamine up to 10 micrograms.kg-1.min-1, we observed a statistically significant increase in mean cardiac index (from 2.39 +/- .14 liters.min-1.m-2 to 3.52 +/- .33, P less than 0.01) and mean heart rate (from 71.6 +/- 5.2 beats.min-1 to 84.3 +/- 8.1, P less than 0.01). This was associated with stable mean systemic arterial pressures and mean pulmonary arterial pressures. Both mean systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances decreased significantly (from 1210 +/- 99 dynes.sec.cm-5 to 809 +/- 90 [P less than 0.01], and from 195.9 +/- 30.6 dynes.sec.cm-5 to 129.4 +/- 41.2 [P less than 0.01] respectively) with dobutamine. Intrapulmonary shunt flow increased significantly in the five patients studied. Though increases in heart rate and pulmonary shunt flow may limit it use, dobutamine increases cardiac output and decreases pulmonary vascular resistance in patients with increased pulmonary arterial pressure following mitral valve replacement.\r"

In dog Purkinje fibers, 10 mg% protamine reduced markedly the maximum diastolic potential and the rate of phase 0 depolarization. Eventually, slow response action potential developed at a depolarized level and the twitch force declined abruptly. The depolarization and the negative inotropy were reversed by increasing [Ca])o or [K]o but not by tetrodotoxin. When Purkinje fibers were depolarized in 27 mM [K]o Tyrode solution plus 0.5 microM epinephrine, higher concentrations of protamine (30 mg% or above) were required to depress the slow response action potentials and twitch, in contrast to the action of verapamil and diltiazem (1-30 microM). Dog ventricular and human atrial muscle fibers were more resistant to the depressant effects of protamine. In human atrial fibers, however, 10 mg% protamine was able to depress significantly the oscillatory afterpotentials and aftercontractions induced by epinephrine and theophylline. The present findings suggest that the depolarization and decline in force of cardiac tissues induced by protamine, at a concentration about twice of the maximum clinically relevant dose, may be explained by the development of slow response action potentials as a result of decrease in membrane K+ and Na+ conductances.\r"

In patients in group 1 a paramedian approach was used with an angle between the spinal needle and the patient's back of 50 degrees or less. In patients in group 2 a median or paramedian approach was used, the resultant angle between the spinal needle and the patient's back being between 70 degrees and 100 degrees. The differences between segmental levels of sensory loss between groups 1 and 2 (T 3.4 and T 5.1, respectively) and of temperature loss (T 2.6 and T 4.2, respectively) 30 minutes after injection of bupivacaine were statistically significant.

Antianxiety drugs characteristically reduce NR but not NSA, while sedative drugs reduce both NR and NSA in generally parallel fashion. In this study, increasing concentrations of nitrous oxide alone produced progressively greater and statistically significant increases in NSA. Nitrous oxide alone had no significant effect on NR until, at a concentration of 75%, it decreased NR. Diazepam alone decreased NR equally and significantly at all doses. With certain combinations of concentration and dose, nitrous oxide enhanced the effect of diazepam on NR without altering NSA. These findings suggest that nitrous oxide can increase the antianxiety effect of diazepam without increasing its sedative effect in the mouse staircase paradigm.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine minimal anesthetic concentration and cardiopulmonary concentration-response effects of isoflurane in Sandhill cranes. Six cranes were anesthetized with isoflurane in oxygen. Gases sampled through a polyethylene tube inserted to the distal end of an endotracheal tube were used for measurements of isoflurane concentrations using an infrared gas analyzer. Body temperature was maintained at 40 +/- 0.5 degrees C. The minimal anesthetic concentration for isoflurane was determined during spontaneous ventilation, and concentration-response data were collected at 1, 1.5, and 2.0 times the minimal anesthetic concentration. Concentration-response data were repeated during mechanically controlled breathing with PaCO2 maintained between 27 and 35 mm Hg. The minimal anesthetic concentration for isoflurane was 1.34 +/- 0.14 vol% (mean +/- SD). Concentration-dependent respiratory depression during spontaneous breathing was evidenced in all cranes by an increase in PaCO2. Isoflurane induced apnea in two of the cranes during spontaneous ventilation at 2 times the minimal anesthetic concentration. As the concentration of isoflurane was increased, mean arterial blood pressure decreased during both spontaneous and controlled ventilation. Mean arterial blood pressure was higher during controlled ventilation than during spontaneous ventilation. The minimal anesthetic concentration for isoflurane in Sandhill cranes is similar to values for isoflurane minimal anesthetic concentration in mammals. Isoflurane has dose-dependent effects on cardiopulmonary function qualitatively similar to those observed in mammals.\r"

  ".W": "Among 1,001,000 ASA Physical Status I and II patients (a subset of the 1,329,000 anesthetics administered from 1976 through mid-1988 in the nine component hospitals of the Harvard Department of Anaesthesia), there were 11 major intraoperative accidents solely attributable to anesthesia (five deaths, four cases of permanent CNS damage, and two cardiac arrests with eventual recovery) among the 70 cases reported to the insurance carrier. Review of these accidents revealed that unrecognized hypoventilation was the most common cause (seven cases). These seven accidents and one other due to discontinuation of inspired oxygen in all likelihood would have been prevented by appropriate response to earlier warnings generated by the \"safety monitoring\" principles mandated by the Harvard minimal monitoring standards. Analysis suggests capnography (although not mandated) would be the best monitor of ventilation. An important associated issue was the apparent inadequacy of supervision of residents and C.R.N.A.s. The eight preventable accidents represent 88% of the projected insurance payout. Only one accident occurred after the 1985 adoption of the standards (in the month following their implementation). From that time through mid-1988, there have been 319,000 anesthetics without a major preventable intraoperative injury. Although not statistically significant, the accident rate in the target population of healthy people is reduced more than threefold. This and the case analyses support the contention that nearly all the inevitable mishaps (technical or from errors in judgement) that occur during anesthesia can be identified through safety monitoring early enough to prevent most major patient injuries. This improved clinical outcome should lessen the medical-legal and malpractice insurance burdens of anesthesiologists.\r"

The stimulus consists of two short bursts of 50 Hz tetanic stimulation, separated by 750 ms, and the response to the stimulation is two short muscle contractions. Fade in the response results from neuromuscular blockade as with train-of-four stimulation (TOF). The authors compared the sensitivity of DBS and TOF in the detection of residual neuromuscular blockade during clinical anaesthesia. Fifty-two healthy patients undergoing surgery were studied. For both stimulation patterns the frequencies of manually detectable fade in the response to stimulation were determined and compared at various electromechanically measured TOF ratios. A total of 369 fade evaluations for DBS and TOF were performed. Fade frequencies were statistically significantly higher with DBS than with TOF, regardless of the TOF ratio level. Absence of fade with TOF implied a 48% chance of considerable residual relaxation as compared with 9% when fade was absent with DBS. The results demonstrate that DBS is more sensitive than TOF in the manual detection of residual neuromuscular blockade.\r"

All introducers were inserted via the right internal jugular vein using the Seldinger technique with the patient in the Trendelenburg position. For each patient, the pulmonary artery catheter was advanced twice: once while the patient was in the Trendelenburg (T) position with a 5-10 degrees head-down tilt and another with a 5 degrees head-up and right lateral tilt (R) position. In 13 of the 68 pulmonary artery catheter passages, no dysrhythmias were noted. In 13 patients, a change in dysrhythmia classification was noted between the two positions. In 11 of the 13 patients, the dysrhythmia classification changed from malignant in the Trendelenburg position to benign or absent in the right lateral tilt position. Although the incidence of dysrhythmias was similar in both groups, the Trendelenburg position was associated with a significantly higher incidence of malignant dysrhythmias than the right tilt position (P less than 0.05). The authors conclude that the head-up and right lateral tilt position appears superior to the Trendelenburg position for passage of the pulmonary artery catheter in the awake patient scheduled for elective coronary bypass surgery.\r"

The autonomic tests consisted of respiratory sinus arrhythmia and heart rate responses to the Valsalva maneuver to test cardiac vagal function and diastolic blood pressure responses to head-up tilt and cold pressor test to assess sympathetic efferent integrity. At a separate time, anesthesia was established with fentanyl (2 micrograms/kg), sodium thiopental (3-5 mg/kg), and vecuronium (0.1 mg/kg), and maintained with isoflurane, oxygen, and nitrous oxide. An anesthesiologist, blinded to the autonomic test results, recorded perioperative blood pressure and heart rate. The autonomic test results revealed significant autonomic dysfunction among the diabetics. Heart rate and blood pressure declined to a greater degree (P less than 0.05) during induction of anesthesia in diabetics compared with controls and there was less of an increase in these same parameters following tracheal intubation in diabetic patients. Thirty-five percent of diabetics required intraoperative vasopressors compared with only 5% of control patients (P less than 0.05). A major finding was that the diabetics who required intraoperative blood pressure support had significantly greater impairment of autonomic test results compared with those diabetics who did not need vasopressors. Diabetics are at increased risk for cardiovascular lability during anesthesia and preoperative screening of diabetics with simple noninvasive autonomic tests may be useful in identifying those at high risk for perioperative cardiovascular instability.\r"

Twenty of those children were deemed by the anesthesiologist to be uncooperative and received 2 mg/kg of ketamine im prior to induction of anesthesia. The onset time (time from ketamine administration until induction of inhaled anesthesia could be started) was 2.7 +/- 0.3 min. The quality of the subsequent acceptance of inhaled induction with halothane was excellent in 61% of the patients and adequate in the remaining 39%. The recovery and discharge times were compared with those observed in 15 matched children who accepted induction of anesthesia via a mask without the use of ketamine. Recovery time was not prolonged, but home discharge was delayed by an average of 13 min in the ketamine group (P less than 0.04). Low-dose im ketamine was found to be an acceptable pre-induction drug in young children who are uncooperative for an inhaled induction of anesthesia.\r"

In nine of these children, a pharmacokinetic analysis was also performed. The onset of analgesia occurred in 8.0 +/- 3.5 minutes after blockade of the femoral nerve. One block failed, resulting in iv narcotics being administered to alleviate the pain. In the remaining 13 children, pain decreased to nonexistent in 11 of the children and only mild pain with movement in the remaining two children. The level of analgesia did not change when the children underwent radiographic examination (60 +/- 18 min after the femoral nerve block) and application of traction (124 +/- 19 min after femoral nerve block). The maximum bupivacaine plasma concentration was 0.89 +/- 0.37 microgram/ml, obtained 24.4 +/- 12.6 min after the end of the injection. The femoral nerve blockade with bupivacaine provides prompt, effective, and prolonged analgesia in children suffering from fractures of the femoral shaft, allowing transport, radiographic examination, and application of traction in optimal conditions. Although the sample size was small, the side effects appeared to be rare.\r"

After induction of anesthesia and tracheal intubation, dantrolene (2.4 mg/kg) was administered iv over 10.2 +/- 0.83 min. Venous blood samples (3 ml) were obtained 1, 5, 10, 20, and 30 min and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 20 h after the dantrolene infusion. Whole blood concentrations of dantrolene, 5-hydroxydantrolene, and nitroreduced acetylated dantrolene were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. The whole blood concentration of dantrolene decreased rapidly from a mean (+/- SD) of 6.03 +/- 0.93 microgram/ml 1 min after the end of the dantrolene infusion to 3.56 +/- 0.49 microgram/ml at 1 h. Between 1 and 4 h, the concentration of dantrolene either remained constant or increased slightly. Thereafter, the concentration of dantrolene decreased slowly with an elimination half-life (mean +/- SD) of 10.0 +/- 2.6 h. The mean (+/- SD) time for the concentration of dantrolene to decrease to 3.0 micrograms/ml was 6.55 +/- 2.88 h. The whole blood concentration of 5-hydroxydantrolene reached a maximum of 0.60 +/- 0.18 microgram/ml approximately 7 h after the dantrolene and decreased thereafter with an elimination half-life of 9.0 +/- 2.5 h. The concentration of nitroreduced acetylated dantrolene was below the limit for detection at all times. All children recovered without complications. Intravenous dantrolene, 2.4 mg/kg, produces safe and predictable blood concentrations in children similar to those reported in adults.\r"

PA correlated with Pa better than did Pv (R = 0.960 vs. 0.878), and there was less variability in the data. Differences between Pv and Pa increased as the relative blood flow to the hand decreased [indicated by an increasing arterial-to-venous (a-v) O2 content difference]. The difference between PA and Pa was approximately 20% of the difference between inspired gas (PI) and Pa. The differences between PA and Pa appear to be due primarily to contamination of alveolar gas by physiologic dead space gas.\r"

In the first group of 26 patients, retrospective analysis revealed that the orthostatic decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) never exceeded 15% following two successive orthostatic decreases of 10% or less. This finding was validated prospectively in a second group of 26 patients. Following two successive orthostatic MAP decreases of 10% or less, none of 65 orthostatic challenges resulted in an MAP decrease of more than 15%; conversely, in the absence of two successive MAP decreases of less than 10%, 5 of 51 orthostatic challenges resulted in an MAP decrease of greater than 15% (P less than 0.02). Had patients been discharged from the RR based on two successive MAP decreases of less than 10%, 35 of 52 patients could have been discharged from the RR 76 +/- 6 min (mean +/- SE) sooner than they would have under usual empirical discharge criteria of supine hemodynamic stability, regression of sensory level to T10, and return of toe movement. Following SAB, hemodynamic stability may return before sensory and motor function; for many patients, orthostatic testing following SAB may safely decrease the amount of time spent in the RR.\r"

Male outbred Hartley guinea pigs were exposed to either 1% v/v halothane or d-halothane, FIO2 = 0.21, for 4 h. Significant reductions in both oxidative and overall halothane biotransformation were observed with the use of d-halothane as indicated by decreased plasma levels of trifluoroacetic acid and bromide ion, respectively, immediately following exposure. Plasma fluoride ion, indicative of the reductive metabolism of halothane, was significantly increased with the use of d-halothane. These changes in metabolism were accompanied by a reduced hepatotoxic response as indicated by significantly decreased plasma ALT levels 24-96 h following exposure and a significantly lesser incidence of centrilobular necrosis. Thus, the oxidative biotransformation of halothane is implicated as a mechanism of injury in guinea pigs.\r"

AChR density in gastrocnemius and diaphragm was unchanged by thermal injury. Furthermore, the ratio of junctional to extrajunctional AChR in diaphragm was unaltered. Total AChE activity was unchanged in thermally injured rats compared with that in sham-injured animals. Separation of the molecular forms of AChE by sucrose gradient centrifugation also showed no changes in the relative proportions of these species.

Halothane appears to interfere with the inactivation process of the heart; this in turn may impede the early rise in CBF during isovolumic relaxation.\r"

  ".W": "An in vitro model system for analysis of presynaptic inhibitory actions of spinal opioids has been applied. Embryonic sensory neurons derived from chick dorsal root ganglia were grown in primary cell culture, and the release of substance P was evoked by electrical field stimulation during exposure to drugs with well-demonstrated affinity for opioid receptors. This allowed a pharmacologic characterization of the inhibitory actions of specific opioid agonists on the release of substance P as measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Sufentanil (0.5 microM), a high affinity mu receptor agonist, U-50,488H (25 microM), a selective kappa receptor agonist, and morphine (10 microM), an agonist with high affinity for mu and delta receptors, inhibited the evoked release of substance P by approximately 60%, 40%, and 50%, respectively. For sufentanil the response was demonstrated to be dose-dependent. As is the case for its analgesic action in vivo, morphine was approximately 50-fold less potent than sufentanil on a molar basis in this assay. The actions of sufentanil, U-50-488H and morphine were mimicked by the endogenous opioid peptide met-enkephalin, and its stable synthetic analog D-ala2-met5-enkephalinamide (DAME). Naloxone (25 microM), an opioid receptor antagonist, blocked the inhibitory action of sufentanil (0.5 microM), morphine (5 microM), and DAME (5 microM), but not U-50,488H (10 microM). The action of U-50,488H was partially blocked by the antagonist naltrexone (25 microM). Stereo-selectivity of agonist action was confirmed by the failure of dextrorphan (50 microM), an inactive opioid isomer, to inhibit the release of substance P.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study compared, in primates, neurologic outcome after a 45-min period of temporary focal ischemia during hypotension induced with either isoflurane or sodium nitroprusside (SNP). Fourteen macaque monkeys were studied. Seven animals received halothane and seven isoflurane anesthesia during surgical preparation. After transorbital exposure of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), in the halothane group, the inspired halothane was reduced to 0.75% and the mean blood pressure (BP) reduced to 50 mmHg by the infusion of SNP. In the isoflurane group, the isoflurane was titrated to reduce mean BP to 50 mmHg. Stable hypotension was maintained for 90 min, which included a 45-min period of MCA occlusion. Monitoring included intraarterial blood pressure, arterial blood gases, EEG, somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP), and temperature. After the procedure the animals were allowed to awaken and were assessed neurologically every 8 h. On the third postoperative day, they were reanesthetized and underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and SEP recording. Thereafter, they were killed with iv KCl and the brains fixed for neuropathology. All animals survived the surgical procedure, but two animals receiving halothane and none receiving isoflurane died prematurely (P less than 0.2). The SEP disappeared in all animals within 10 min of MCA occlusion and then returned partially or completely. There was no difference between groups in neurologic scores, in the size of the lesion as assessed by MRI (isoflurane 15.7 +/- 6%, halothane/SNP 10.5 +/- 4%), or in the extent or severity of the neuropathologic lesions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To answer this question, 15 rats anesthetized with pentobarbital and mechanically ventilated were studied. They were divided into three groups of five animals each, according to the administered concentration of isoflurane. Diaphragmatic function was assessed by measuring the transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) generated during bilateral supramaximal phrenic nerve stimulation at 0.5 Hz, 20 Hz, 50 Hz, and 100 Hz under quasi-isometric conditions. After a control measurement (C), isoflurane was administered at a constant concentration (0.5, 1, or 1.5 MAC) and Pdi measurements were repeated after 30 min of isoflurane exposure (T1) and 30 min after discontinuing isoflurane (T2). In the group breathing 1.5 MAC isoflurane, the time constant of diaphragmatic relaxation (tau) and integrated electrical activity of the diaphragm (Edi) were also assessed. The Pdi amplitude generated by single twitch (0.5 Hz) was unchanged at the three isoflurane concentrations. A significant increase in Pdi at 20 Hz was observed at T1, which returned to control after 30 min recovery (T2). No change in Pdi during 50 Hz stimulation was noted during 0.5 and 1 MAC isoflurane exposure, whereas it was reduced at T1 during 1.5 MAC. For 100 Hz stimulation, a significant decrease in Pdi was noted for all groups at T1, which returned toward control values at T2. Edi was markedly reduced for 50 and 100 Hz stimulation, but this reduction was also transient, since Edi returned toward control values at T2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Bronchoalveolar lavage activities for alkaline phosphatase (Alk Pase) and acid phosphatase (Ac Pase) were elevated 3 wk after exposure; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and Alk Pase activities peaked 3 months after exposure. Histopathologic analysis revealed progressive focal interstitial pneumonitis with a prominent alveolar component of heteromorphic macrophages, neutrophils, and debris. No increase was noted in the overall labeling index in the alveolar cell population at any of the time points sampled. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis in monitoring lung damage over a prolonged period and shows that the pulmonary toxicity of beryllium manifests itself as a progressive lesion from a single 1-h inhalation exposure to BeSO4.\r"

However, little is known about specific structural and/or functional alterations that occur in nonpulmonary organs in this syndrome. Therefore, the present study was designed to test the hypothesis that inflammatory cell infiltration and structural changes occur both in the lungs and in nonpulmonary organs in ARDS. To test this hypothesis, neutrophil accumulation and structural alterations were evaluated in nonpulmonary organs from dogs with acute lung injury produced by intravenous phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (30 micrograms/kg; n = 5). As expected, morphologic changes were present in the lungs of the PMA-treated animals and included a diffuse neutrophilic pneumonitis with interstitial, vascular, and alveolar components. PMA-treated dogs had significant increases in neutrophils (expressed as PMN/mm2 tissue section area) compared with those in control animals in the following organs: heart, 14 +/- 3 versus 4 +/- 1; brain, 2.5 +/- 0.3 versus 0.7 +/- 0.3; duodenum, 34 +/- 7 versus 10 +/- 2; liver, 397 +/- 16 versus 103 +/- 12 (p less than 0.025, all comparisons). In addition, severe necrosis and inflammation of vessels, sinusoidal thrombosis, and hepatic necrosis were noted in the liver. Like the changes noted in the lung, hepatic lesions appeared to be vascular in origin and were consistent with lesions produced by the intravascular activation of neutrophils. No microscopic lesions were detected in the brain, kidney, duodenum, and heart. Taken together, the finding of concurrent lung injury, liver injury, and nonpulmonary organ neutrophil accumulation suggests the possibility of a common pathway of injury in this model of ARDS.\r"

Alveolar macrophages (AM) in this disease have been noted in the past to have abnormally decreased function. It is not known whether these abnormalities are reversible with treatment of the disease. In this study, the effect of therapeutic whole lung lavage (WLL) on AM migration in four patients with PAP was determined. Standard segmental bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed 1 day before and 6 days after WLL. AM recovered by BAL were assayed for migratory response to N-formyl-methionyl phenylalanine (FMP) and endotoxin-activated human serum (EAHS). As expected, migration toward both stimuli was decreased before WLL compared to a group of normal controls. After WLL, AM migration toward both stimuli was not only greater than before the WLL but also was greater than normal. In one patient, serial BAL over a period of 18 months showed a marked decline in AM migration coincident with a clinical relapse of the disease. Thus, the defect in AM function found in PAP is reversible with WLL but can recur if clinical remission is not sustained.\r"

Therapy generally consists of two bactericidal drugs (rifampin [RIF] and isoniazid [INH]) for 9 months or INH for 9 to 12 months. With such a small bacillary population, even less therapy might suffice. Thus we began in January 1980 to discontinue therapy at 4 months when there was sufficient evidence of a paucity of bacilli demonstrated by at least three negative smears and cultures for TB at the start of therapy. To date, 452 such patients have been so treated. Radiographic abnormalities included pulmonary infiltration of varying extent, pleural residuals, and hilar adenopathy. The full course of therapy could not be completed in 38 (8.4%) patients due to death, relocation, or drug toxicity. Side effects of the drugs occurred in 21 (4.7%) patients, but toxic hepatitis occurred in only four (0.9%) patients. Thus, 414 patients completed the full 4-month course of therapy. Of these, 126 (30.4%) patients showed radiographic and/or clinical response suggesting active infection. The remainder showed no such improvement, suggesting either a mistake in diagnosis or dormant TB. During follow-up of the 414 patients from 6 to 78 months (median, 44 months), five (1.2%) patients relapsed: three among responders and two among nonresponders. Thus, among persons suspected of having TB but with negative bacteriology, 4 months of chemotherapy with INH and RIF gave results comparable to those achieved with 9 months of therapy in smear- and culture-positive cases.\r"

The diagnosis of V-A pneumonia was retained only if PSB specimens yielded greater than 10(3) cfu/ml of at least one microorganism, unless this result was established to be a false positive result on follow-up. V-A pneumonia developed in 49 patients for a total of 52 episodes (9%). The actuarial risk of V-A pneumonia was 6.5% at 10 days, 19% at 20 days, and 28% at 30 days of ventilation. Patients with pneumonia were significantly older (65 versus 57 yr of age, p less than 0.01) and more frequently had severe underlying illnesses (24 versus 10%, p less than 0.01) than did patients without pneumonia. A total of 84 microorganisms (51 gram-negative and 33 gram-positive) were isolated in significant concentrations from PSB specimens. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were involved in 31 and 33% of these pneumonias, respectively. Forty percent of all specimens yielded a polymicrobial flora with more than one potential pathogen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To investigate this problem, we administered a mixture of the amphibole, amosite, and chrysotile to guinea pigs by intratracheal instillation. At 1 day, 1 week, and 1 month after instillation, animals were killed, and the numbers, types, sizes, and compositions of fibers in the lungs were determined by analytical electron microscopy. Both chrysotile and amosite fiber concentrations decreased with time, but relative chrysotile clearance was significantly greater than amosite clearance. There was no evidence of magnesium leaching from chrysotile fibers of any size at any time. Analysis of fiber lengths and widths showed a time trend toward shorter and narrower fibers (particularly toward fibers of less than 2 microns long and less than 0.025 microns wide) for chrysotile. This effect was not seen for amosite. We conclude that (1) failure of chrysotile accumulation in lung results from preferential chrysotile clearance during the first few days to weeks after exposure; (2) there is no evidence that fiber dissolution plays a role in chrysotile clearance; (3) preferential clearance may be a result of fragmentation and rapid removal of chrysotile fibers.\r"

A positive correlation of fibrosis grade with tremolite concentration and a lesser correlation with chrysotile concentration was found for whole lungs, specific sites within lungs, and, for tremolite, single microscopic fields. No correlations were found for measures of chrysotile fiber size, surface area, or mass, but tremolite mean fiber length, aspect ratio, and surface area were, surprisingly, negatively correlated with fibrosis grade. Measures based on total rather than on mean case or site parameters failed to show correlations with fibrosis. We conclude that: (1) degree of pulmonary fibrosis reflects fiber concentration at both a bulk and a microscopic level; (2) mean fiber length and parameters related to mean fiber length also correlate with fibrosis grade, but, contrary to predictions from animal studies, this correlation is negative, suggesting that short fibers may be more important in the genesis of pulmonary fibrosis than is commonly believed; (3) there is no evidence that parameters such as total fiber length, surface area, or mass provide predictors of degree of fibrosis.\r"

Lung function and exercise capacity were measured preoperatively and at 3 and 12 months postoperatively. Preoperative pulmonary scintigraphy was used to calculate the contribution to overall function by the affected lung or lobe and to predict postoperative lung function. Pneumonectomy was performed in 18 patients, lobectomy in 29, and thoracotomy without resection in six. No surgery was attempted in two patients who were considered functionally inoperable. Cardiopulmonary complications developed in 16 patients within 30 days of surgery, including three deaths. The predictions of postoperative function correlated well with the measured values at 3 months. For FEV1, r = 0.51 in pneumonectomy (p less than 0.05) and 0.89 in lobectomy (p less than 0.001). Predicted postoperative FEV1 (FEV1-ppo), diffusing capacity (DLCO), predicted postoperative DLCO (DLCO-ppo) and exercise-induced arterial O2 desaturation (delta SaO2) were predictive of postoperative complications including death and respiratory failure. In patients who underwent pneumonectomy, the best predictor of death was FEV1-ppo. The predictions were enhanced by expressing the value as a percentage of the predicted normal value (% pred) rather than in absolute units. For the entire surgical group a FEV1-ppo greater than or equal to 40% pred was associated with no postoperative mortality (n = 47), whereas a value less than 40% pred was associated with a 50% mortality (n = 6), suggesting that resection is feasible when FEV1-ppo is greater than or equal to 40% pred.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this investigation, we studied the effects of calcium antagonist gallopamil on antigen-induced early- and late-phase bronchial responses in sheep allergic to Ascaris suum antigen. In 11 unsedated sheep, specific lung resistance (SRL) was measured before, immediately after, and serially up to 8 h after inhalation challenge with A. suum antigen. On different experiment days, at least 3 wk apart, the sheep were pretreated with gallopamil, administered either as an aerosol (5 mg, n = 10; 10 mg, n = 9) or as an intravenous injection (20 micrograms/kg, n = 10), and the antigen challenge was repeated. For the control experiments (n = 11), mean +/- SE SRL increased immediately after antigen challenge (early response) to 533 +/- 72% of baseline and again 6 to 8 h after challenge (late response) to 304 +/- 31% of baseline (p less than 0.05). Neither intravenously administered nor aerosolized gallopamil had a significant effect on baseline SRL. Both aerosolized and intravenously administered gallopamil blunted the early response and completely blocked the late-phase bronchoconstrictor response (p less than 0.05). Mean SRL during early phase increased to 208 +/- 39% and 245 +/- 39% of baseline with 5 mg and 10 mg of aerosolized gallopamil and to 191 +/- 35% of baseline with intravenously administered gallopamil, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In 53 subjects with a history of episodic wheezing and a normal baseline airway resistance, we carried out bronchial challenges with successively doubling concentrations of histamine until FEV1 had dropped by 15% or more or a concentration of 16 mg/ml histamine was reached. For the baseline values, a mean within-subject coefficient of variation was found of 2.8% for FEV1, 7.4% for SGaw, 8.7% for the oscillatory respiratory conductance at 6 Hz (1/Rrs6), and 7.7% for the mean oscillatory respiratory conductance (between 2 and 26 Hz) (1/Rrs). The latter coefficients allow the calculation of the following threshold values: PD15FEV1, PD40SGaw, PD47 1/Rrs6, and PD42 1/Rrs. The probability of exceeding these levels by chance is virtually zero. Histamine challenge caused significant absolute changes in Rrs at 6 Hz (Rrs6), in mean level of Rrs and of respiratory reactance (Xrs), in slope of Rrs and Xrs versus frequency, and in mean curvature of Rrs-frequency curve. A multivariate analysis of the differences between prechallenge and postchallenge values showed that the parameters with the best sensitivity to detect the effect of histamine were, in decreasing order: the relative change of SGaw, of 1/Rrs6, of 1/Rrs, of FEV1, of FVC, and of 1/Vtg, followed by the absolute change of Xrs and of the average slope of the Rrs-frequency relationship.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this study we examined how a direct stimulation of PKC in airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells influences the electrical and contractile properties of these cells. ASM preparations were obtained from adult male guinea pigs (Camm-Hartley strain). Changes in both the resting membrane potential (Em), as measured by a glass microelectrode technique, and the isometric force, measured by a copper-beryllium strain gauge, were continuously monitored. All experiments were done at the optimal length (Lmax) of ASM preparations and a temperature of 37.0 +/- 0.5 degrees C. The effects of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), phorbol 12,13-diacetate (PDA), and 12,deoxyphorbol-13-isobutyrate (DPB) were investigated (with concentrations ranging from 10(-10) to 10(-4) M). We found that: (1) administration of all three phorbol esters caused a triphasic electrical and contractile response of ASM preparations showing initial, rapid depolarization, an increase in the isometric force, and slow hyperpolarization and relaxation of ASM followed by slow depolarization and an increase in the isometric force; (2) the presence of specific PKC inhibitor H-7 (10(-5) M) prevented development of both electrical and contractile events as induced by tested phorbols; (3) amiloride (10(-5) M) attenuated first- and second-phase responses, whereas furosemide (10(-5) M) inhibited all three responses (a sodium-free environment attenuated all three responses); (4) ouabain (10(-5) M) inhibited a second-phase response, whereas verapamil (10(-6) M) partially attenuated all three phases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Using isolated rings of bovine intrapulmonary arteries, we sought to determine whether a Na/Ca exchange mechanism is present in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle, and if so, whether it contributes to the modulation of vascular tone during hypoxia. Under both normoxic (PO2 greater than or equal to 120 mm Hg) and hypoxic (PO2 less than or equal to 40 mm Hg) conditions, the amplitude of the 40 mM K+ contraction was significantly (p less than 0.005) enhanced when most of the external Na+ was replaced with N-methylglucamine (NMG) (Na+ = 1.2 mM). The rate of contraction was also increased by replacing Na+ with NMG during normoxia (1.02 +/- 0.24 to 2.52 +/- 0.57 mg/mg weight/s, p less than 0.005) and hypoxia (1.72 +/- 0.74 to 4.08 +/- 1.63 mg/mg weight/s, p less than 0.05). Although the relaxation rate was slowed in the low Na+ media during normoxia (3.48 +/- 1.07 with Na+ versus 2.58 +/- 0.81 mg/mg weight/s with NMG, p less than 0.02), it was unaltered during hypoxia (3.15 +/- 0.90 with Na+ versus 2.95 +/- 0.83 mg/mg weight/s with NMG, p = 0.3). The ratio of relaxation rates in the normal and low Na+ media correlated with the perfusate PO2 (r = 0.76, p less than 0.001). During normoxia and hypoxia, inhibition of the Na+,K+ pump by strophanthidin, which increases intracellular [Na+], reversibly enhanced the amplitude of the K+ contraction, even when the voltage-gated channels were blocked with verapamil.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

AM were obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage before and after challenging the sheep with alpha-thrombin (80 U/kg). Post-thrombin AM increased 125I-labeled albumin transendothelial permeability, whereas resting AM had no effect (82.7 +/- 7.9% increase versus 17.2 +/- 1.6% increase at the AM:endothelial cell ratio of 1:1; p less than 0.001). The permeability increase was also seen at AM:endothelial cell ratios of 0.2:1 and 5:1. Endothelial permeability to 125I-labeled albumin did not increase after in vitro incubation of macrophages with 10(-8) M thrombin, suggesting that AM are activated as a result of thrombin-induced fibrin microembolism rather than by the alpha-thrombin per se. The increase in permeability was not due to endothelial lysis since macrophages did not cause release of endothelial lactate dehydrogenase. Adherence of AM to the endothelium did not correlate with the ability of AM to increase endothelial permeability. Superoxide anion production was increased when post-thrombin AM were exposed to the endothelial monolayers (30.6 +/- 4.2 nmol/10(6) cells/10 min) compared with production by post-thrombin AM in the absence of endothelial cells (2.5 +/- 0.5 nmol/10(6) cells/10 min). The addition of superoxide dismutase (SOD) blunted the permeability increase induced by AM (32.3 +/- 3.9% increase with SOD versus 84.1 +/- 7.1% increase without SOD; p less than 0.001), indicating that superoxide anion is an important mediator of the macrophage-induced increase in endothelial monolayer permeability.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Because of its increasing clinical use, we desired to study the effects of buspirone on respiratory control. We therefore determined central neural respiratory responses, measured from phrenic nerve activity, after intravenous administration in paralyzed, vagotomized, and glomectomized cats whose end-tidal PCO2 and body temperature were kept constant. The responses were compared to the effects of the sedating tranquilizer diazepam. Buspirone had a dose-dependent stimulatory effect on respiratory output primarily through an increase of tidal activity but with an increase of frequency in some animals. Associated with this was a shift of the apneic threshold to a lower level of PCO2 without a change of slope or shape of the CO2 response curve. In contrast, diazepam led to a depression of respiration and a shift of the apneic threshold to a higher PCO2. The findings indicate that buspirone does not have the typical neural respiratory depressant actions of diazepam but instead stimulates respiration. Although the findings will need to be shown to apply to human beings, they suggest that buspirone may be a useful drug to treat anxiety in patients without causing undesirable respiratory depression.\r"

When the results were analyzed, of the 405 patients studied, 207 had OSA (apnea/hypopnea index [AHI] greater than 10) and 198 did not. Flow-volume curves were examined for the presence of upper airway obstruction defined as midvital capacity flow ratio (MVCFR = ratio of the maximal expiratory flow at 50% of vital capacity to maximal inspiratory flow at 50% of vital capacity) greater than 1.0. We found no significant difference in the values of MVCFR between the two groups: MVCFR was equal to 0.69 +/- 0.31 for nonapneic snorers, and 0.68 +/- 0.29 for the apneic snorers. Furthermore, we redefined the apneic and nonapneic groups using different cutoff values of AHI: 20, 30, 40, and 50. Independently of the AHI cutoff used, we found no significant difference in the MVCFR between the two groups. Linear regression analysis for the entire group of 405 patients revealed no significant correlation between MVCFR and the AHI or the snoring indices. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of MVCFR for the diagnosis of OSA.

However, the relationship of these two indices to the various individual determinants of load and to muscle energy demands and fatigue potential are not well understood. To investigate these relationships in a theoretical fashion, we first constructed a computer model to quantitate the magnitude and relative effects of changes in the ventilation component of load, i.e., alveolar ventilation demands (VA) and dead space volume (VD), and changes in the respiratory system impedance component of load, i.e., compliance (Crs) and resistance (Raw), on W.min-1 and PTI over a wide, clinically relevant, range of ventilatory conditions. From this analysis, we demonstrated that: (1) high mechanical loads could be developed over a wide range of circumstances (i.e., W.min-1 ranged from 0.29 kg.m.min-1 to 30.55 kg.m.min-1 and PTI ranged from 1.22 to 28.8 cm H2O as ventilation increased from 7 to 39 L.min-1 and impedances worsened from normal to a combined restricted and obstructed pattern); (2) each load determinant (i.e., VA, VD, Crs, and Raw) contributed substantially to these two indices of total mechanical load; (3) although impedance changes had comparable effects on W.min-1 and PTI, ventilation changes, as would be expected, had a greater effect on W.min-1 than on PTI.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-eight patients undergoing lobectomy or pneumonectomy for carcinoma had preoperative computed tomography (CT) of the chest. Twenty-seven had both 1.5 mm and 10 mm collimation scans, and eleven had 10 mm collimation images only. These images were analyzed for the extent and severity of emphysema, and the analysis compared to the pathologic findings in the corresponding transverse slice of lung. The latter was graded by a modification of a panel of standards and by a grid system numerically expressing extent and severity. The grid system is theoretically superior to the panel of standards because it allows better quantitation of early emphysema and, contrary to the set of standards, is designed to analyze transverse CT images and corresponding pathologic slices. There was good correlation between the CT score and the pathologic score using the panel of standards (r = 0.81, p less than 0.001) but a lower correlation with the grid system (r = 0.70, p less than 0.001). The correlation improved slightly with 1.5 as compared to 10 mm collimation scans. Close comparison between the CT and grid scores showed that CT was sensitive in demonstrating early distal acinar and irregular emphysema. However, CT consistently underestimated the extent of centriacinar and panacinar emphysema because most lesions less than 0.5 cm in diameter were missed. We conclude that CT is insensitive in detecting the earliest lesions of emphysema.\r"

  ".W": "The Raja pleural biopsy needle, 3 mm in external diameter and fitted with a titanium alloy biopsy flap, was compared with the Abrams needle in six dogs with experimentally induced pleural effusion. One hundred twenty-four pleural biopsies were performed using either the Raja needle or the Abrams needle (62 with each needle). No complication occurred with either needle. The Raja pleural biopsy needle yielded a statistically significant larger pleural tissue specimen with a statistically significant lower frequency of crush artifacts. The size of the pleura obtained by the Abrams needle averaged 4,401 +/- 559 microns2 (mean +/- SE) compared with 8,652 +/- 1,099 microns2 with the Raja needle (p less than 0.01; Student two-tailed t test). Biopsies by the Abrams needle showed crush artifacts in 25.8% of the specimens, whereas 8.06% of biopsies with the Raja needle showed crush artifacts (p less than 0.02; Fisher's two-tailed exact test). In conclusion, the Raja pleural biopsy needle is safe to use and, despite its smaller diameter (3mm versus 4mm external diameter of the Abrams needle), yields significantly larger and less frequently distorted pleural specimens.\r"

  ".W": "It has been reported that infections with Legionella pneumophila can lead to chronic inflammatory and fibrotic reactions in the human lung. To better characterize the nature of the residual abnormalities caused by this bacterium, we inoculated Syrian hamsters intratracheally with 10(8) serotype 1 L. pneumophila organisms and assessed histologic, functional, and biochemical changes at intervals up to 180 days. Acutely, L. pneumophila caused an intense alveolar macrophage (AM) and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) response within the lower air spaces, air-filled lungs were noncompliant, and there was an associated 25 to 50% increase in the lung content of collagen and elastin after 10 days. An inflammatory response, consisting principally of AM and centered around the terminal bronchioles, was still prominent in some infected lungs after 90 and 180 days, and the severity of the inflammation was correlated with a persistent restrictive defect in the elastic behavior of the lung. However, by histologic examination, fibrosis was not prominent, and the more representative abnormality was one of mild, diffuse air-space enlargement. Frank emphysematous changes were present focally in some lungs. In addition, an irregularly distributed lymphocytic infiltrate and goblet cell metaplasia were present in the larger bronchi of infected animals. We conclude that a single infection with L. pneumophila is capable of causing long-term inflammatory reactions in the lung, with morphologic features of both fibrosis and emphysema.\r"

We determined the relationship between antigen concentration, time of culture, and development of competence to transfer HP and if separation of lymphoblasts from a noncultured cell population would allow transfer. We cultured lymph node cells from sensitized Strain II guinea pigs with a soluble extract of Micropolyspora faeni (10 micrograms/ml) for 48, 72, and 96 h, and isolated and transferred lymphoblasts intravenously to syngeneic recipients. Other animals received lymphoblasts from 72-h cultures exposed to 0, 0.1, 1, 10, or 30 micrograms/ml M. faeni. We also separated and transferred lymphoblasts from noncultured lymph node cell populations. Control animals received equal volumes of media. The animals were challenged intratracheally with M. faeni 48 h after the cell transfer, and they were killed 4 days after intratracheal challenge. Randomly selected microscopic fields of the lung (250/animal) were judged to be normal or abnormal without knowledge of treatment. All guinea pigs were maintained in HEPA-filtered air. There was a low level of pulmonary response to an intratracheal challenge of M. faeni in animals that received media and a substantial increase (p less than 0.01) in the extent of pulmonary abnormalities in the animals receiving lymphoblasts cultured for 72 and 96 but not for 48 h. Recipients of lymphoblasts cultured for 72 h with 1, 10, and 30 but not zero and 0.1 micrograms/ml M. faeni exhibited increased extent of pulmonary abnormalities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

DESIGN: Prospective analysis of a cohort of patients for a median follow-up time of 44 months (range, 8 to 57). SETTING: Referral-based cardiology clinics at two university hospitals and their affiliated Veterans Administration medical centers. PATIENTS: Cohort of 50 asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients with chronic aortic insufficiency and left ventricular enlargement. Patients had preserved left ventricular ejection fraction at rest and no evidence of coronary artery disease or significant noncardiac illness. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Baseline evaluation included a history and physical examination, chest roentgenogram. M-mode echocardiogram, treadmill test, and radionuclide angiogram done at rest and during supine bicycle exercise. Ten patients progressed to surgery because of the onset of limiting symptoms or objective evidence of left ventricular dysfunction, or both; the overall rate was 4% +/- 3% per year. The Breslow and Mantel-Cox statistics were used to compute survival (surgery-free) dichotomized by prognostic variables. The progression to surgery was earlier in patients with left ventricular end-diastolic volume indices of 150 cc/m2 or more, end-systolic volume indices of 60 cc/m2 or more, a left ventricular ejection fraction at maximal exercise of less than 0.50, or an end-systolic wall stress of 86 dynes/cm2 or more. CONCLUSIONS: Patients at higher and lower risk for early progression to aortic valve replacement can be identified through the measurement of left ventricular size and function. This information can be used to decide the frequency and intensity of follow-up evaluation in these patients.\r"

DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Referral-based cardiovascular exercise laboratory at an urban teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Thirteen volunteers with clinically stable coronary artery disease who had exercise tests after a 2-week caffeine-free washout period. Patients continued treatment with standard antianginal medications during the study period. INTERVENTIONS: Maximal exercise treadmill testing and exercise echocardiography were done at baseline, after acute ingestion of a placebo beverage (97% caffeine-free coffee), or after drinking an identical beverage containing 250 mg of caffeine sodium benzoate. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Acute ingestion of caffeine produced a serum level of 4.50 +/- 0.16 micrograms/mL, but had no effect on resting supine heart rate, blood pressure, left ventricular fractional shortening, posterior left ventricular wall thinning or peak rates of increase in left ventricular diastolic dimension. Despite a small increase in peak systolic blood pressure during exercise (baseline, 153 +/- 8; placebo, 154 +/- 8; caffeine, 161 +/- 7 mm Hg; P less than 0.05), exercise duration, time to onset of angina, and time to 0.1 mV ST depression did not differ after ingestion of placebo or caffeine. Rate-pressure product at onset of angina and onset of 0.1 mV of ST depression were also unchanged. In response to exercise, echocardiographic measures of left ventricular systolic and diastolic function were unchanged after caffeine compared with placebo ingestion. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that patients with exercise-induced ischemia who are receiving appropriate antianginal therapy tolerate the caffeine-equivalent of three cups of coffee without detrimental effect on intensity of ischemia, myocardial function, or exercise duration.\r"

Expression of the disease varies, but the genetic basis for clinical heterogeneity is unknown. We describe an extended consanguineous family with pulmonary disease and the sweat gland phenotype of cystic fibrosis. In the members of this family, clinical expression of the disease was mild, as manifested by the absence of severe childhood lung disease and increased longevity with better functional status than that expected for age. The degree of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency varied (4/10), but the older patients had normal pancreatic function. The pedigree suggested the likelihood of common ancestry, and eight of the ten affected persons were clearly related. At least three of the family members with the mildest clinical disease had consanguineous parents and may therefore have been homozygous for a variant cystic fibrosis gene. The mild expression of cystic fibrosis in this family provides evidence for a form of cystic fibrosis that is intrinsically less debilitating than the classic form.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To test whether physicians who receive a continuing education program (\"Quit for Life\") about how to counsel smokers to quit would counsel smokers more effectively and have higher rates of long-term smoking cessation among their patients who smoke. DESIGN: Randomized trial with blinded assessment of principal outcomes. SETTING: Four health maintenance organization medical centers in northern California. SUBJECTS: Eighty-one internists assigned by blinded randomization to receive training (40) or serve as controls (41). Consecutive samples of smokers visiting each physician (mean, 25.6 patients per experimental and 25.2 per control physician). INTERVENTIONS: Internists received 3 hours of training about how to help smokers quit. Physicians and their office staff also were given self-help booklets to distribute free to smokers and were urged to use a system of stickers on charts to remind physicians to counsel smokers about quitting. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: On the basis of telephone interviews with patients after visiting the physician, we determined that internists who attended the Quit for Life program discussed smoking with more patients who smoked, spent more time counseling them about smoking, helped more patients set dates to quit smoking, gave out more self-help booklets, and made more follow-up appointments to discuss smoking than did internists in the control group. One year later, the rate of biochemically confirmed, long-term (greater than or equal to 9 months) abstinence from smoking was 1% higher among all patients of trained internists than among patients of controls (95% CI, -0.1% to +2.3%), and 2.2% (+0.2% to +4.3%) higher among the patients who most wanted to quit smoking. CONCLUSIONS: This continuing education program substantially changed the way physicians counseled smokers. As a result, a few more patients who wanted to quit smoking achieved long-term abstinence.\r"

DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial with 112 general internists and their patients who smoke. PATIENTS: Sample of 1420 patients from a general medicine clinic of a city-county teaching hospital, who smoke at least one cigarette a day and were recruited regardless of their interest in quitting smoking. INTERVENTIONS: Physicians were randomly assigned to one of four groups: participants who received a protocol for smoking management and a lecture on the consequences and management of smoking (control); in addition, had nicotine gum freely available to patients (gum); had stickers attached to their smokers' charts (reminder); or had both gum and reminders (both). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The percentage of patients with a return visit at 6 months who quit smoking (alveolar carbon monoxide of less than nine parts per million) was 1.3% (control), 7.7% (gum), 7.0% (reminders), and 6.3% (both). At 1 year the percentages were 2.7%, 8.8%, 15.0%, and 9.6%, respectively. Subsequent pairwise comparisons showed that the three intervention groups were not significantly different, but that each was significantly different from the control group (P less than 0.05). Physicians in all three intervention groups spent significantly more time than did the physicians in the control group counseling their patients about smoking. CONCLUSIONS: The availability of nicotine gum or labeling the charts of smokers can help primary care physicians increase their success rates two- to six-fold in helping patients quit smoking. If all primary care physicians used these procedures, they could help an additional 2 million smokers quit.\r"

This outbreak had an unusual clinical course, with fulminant hepatic failure associated with acute renal failure from acute glomerulonephritis, leading to death within a few days. The onset dates of hepatitis were tightly clustered temporally and incubation periods were short. Extensive laboratory and epidemiologic evaluation showed that the probable common-source vehicle of transmission was a multiple-dose vial of heparin and normal saline flush solution that may have been contaminated by blood of a known HBsAg carrier, who was positive for anti-HBe, hospitalized at the same time. A sixth patient died in August 1986 (second generation), after his initial admission in June that coincided with the terminal hospitalizations of three first-generation patients. Those patients had marked coagulopathies, and transmission to the sixth patient most probably occurred through environmental contamination by patients or through cross-contamination between patients through staff. The unusually high mortality rate (5 of 6) in this outbreak has not been definitely explained.\r"

  ".W": "Most forms of barotrauma related to mechanical ventilation are known to occur in both adult and pediatric patients. The pressure-driven transfer of gas from the alveolar compartment to the systemic circulation, a devastating complication of ventilatory support in infants, is not generally recognized as a consequence of ventilatory support in adults. Two young adult patients who received ventilatory support with high levels of positive pressure for pneumonia and the adult respiratory distress syndrome developed massive sub-pleural air cysts, interstitial emphysema, and tension pneumothoraces. Despite receiving appropriate treatment for these problems, the patients had recurrent episodes of cerebral infarction, myocardial injury, and a characteristic pattern of livedo reticularis. This distinctive triad of findings, otherwise unexplained and occurring in the setting of cystic barotrauma, is highly suggestive of systemic gas embolism. Although our patients presented with dramatic clinical features, we believe that patients with ventilator-related gas embolism may present more commonly with subtler signs, such as puzzling disturbances in heart rhythm or mental status, seizure activity, hypotension, localized pain, or other embolic manifestations readily ascribed to other causes in critically ill patients.\r"

DESIGN: Blinded study of frozen pedigreed serum samples collected at time of diagnostic evaluation with follow-up review at a mean of 8 years. SETTING: A general university teaching hospital serving both primary and referral patient populations. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sera collected prospectively from 1978 to 1980 from 261 patients undergoing imaging studies of the pancreas (ultrasound, computed tomography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) for a variety of symptoms were assayed for CA19-9 levels, and the results were compared with earlier determinations of other potential markers for pancreatic cancer. In 54 patients ultimately shown to have pancreatic cancer, the CA19-9 assay showed a sensitivity of 70% with a median value of 349 u/mL (normal less than 70 u/mL) and range, 7.3 to 2,859,964 u/mL, whereas specificity of the marker in this population was 87%. The positive predictive value was 59%, and the negative predictive value was 92%. Results of CA19-9 testing in the small group of patients with definitive staging information showed no difference in sensitivity between patients with local/regional disease (n = 6) and those with distant metastases (n = 14), 50% compared with 71% (P = 0.613). CONCLUSION: CA19-9 was found to be a more sensitive and specific marker of pancreatic cancer than other serologic markers and should be a useful test in the patient with suspected pancreatic disease.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective measurement of the knowledge, skills, and attitudes of 185 ABIM-certified and 74 noncertified internists by a written examination; evaluation by professional associates; a patient questionnaire assessing satisfaction with care, physician's counseling role, and preventive care; and review of records of patients with common illnesses. SUBJECTS: Practicing internists who completed training or received ABIM certification 5 to 10 years previously. SETTING: Office-based practices in six western states. RESULTS OF DATA ANALYSIS: Physicians certified by the ABIM had significantly higher scores on the written examination than the noncertified physicians, and scores on our examination correlated highly with the ABIM certification examination (r = 0.73). Ratings of clinical skills by professional associates were significantly higher for certified internists and also correlated highly with ABIM examination scores (r = 0.53 to 0.59). Regression analysis showed that ABIM certification status was the major variable affecting performance on these measures of clinical competence. Results from other measures did not show many differences between certified and noncertified physicians in the care of patients with common illnesses, but modest differences in preventive care and a few differences in outcome favored the certified physicians. CONCLUSIONS: Comparison of findings from the written examination and the professional associate ratings with certification status and original ABIM certification examination scores shows predictive validity of ABIM certification. Further studies are needed to determine if certification status predicts important differences in the care of patients with complex illnesses.\r"

Two of three ARC cases with cotton-wool-like spots developed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia a few weeks after ophthalmoscopic examination. A close correlation between ocular changes and decrease of CD4+ lymphocytes was observed. In our opinion, these ocular manifestations are as useful as opportunistic infections or AIDS-related neoplasias in the natural history of HIV infection.\r"

It is based on the epikeratophakia technique developed by Kaufman and Werblin and involves the grafting of corneal epithelium onto a donor lenticule. Previous findings noted that grafting of the corneal epithelium results in rapid surgical recovery and increased patient comfort. It also lowers the likelihood of surgical failure (loss of the donor lenticule). The postoperative visual acuity of 42 consecutive patients who underwent either intraepikeratophakia or epikeratophakia is described. Patients who underwent intraepikeratophakia had a significantly faster rate of visual recovery than epikeratophakia patients. Of all patients 88% had a visual acuity of within two Snellen lines of best-corrected preoperative visual acuity by six months postoperatively. Of these 20 of 23 (87%) intraepikeratophakia patients and 17 of 19 (89%) epikeratophakia patients obtained this level of visual recovery. Special instrumentation and a modification of the surgical technique involving the use of tissue culture techniques is presented. Patients undergoing this modification of intraepikeratophakia had the fastest visual recovery. Continued improvements in the methodology of intraepikeratophakia are expected.\r"

At the end of therapy, rheumatologic assessment revealed the following trends in disease activity: a decrease in the number of tender joints, joint tenderness index, duration of morning stiffness, and an increase in grip strength. There was a decrease in the number of swollen joints, joint swelling index, and the time taken to walk 50 ft. Overall disease activity significantly improved as assessed independently by the patient and physician. For psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, disease activity worsened toward baseline within four weeks of discontinuation of therapy.

Of the 14 babies, 13 had birth asphyxia, 11 were premature, and four had intrauterine growth retardation. Ten babies required artificial ventilation from birth. Abnormalities on chest radiography included thin ribs (n =9) and raised right hemidiaphragms (n = 5). Recurrent episodes of collapse and consolidation of the lungs secondary to poor swallowing occurred in all ventilated babies. All babies ventilated for longer than four weeks died of respiratory complications before the age of 15 months. One baby was successfully extubated after diaphragmatic plication, but he died a few months later. Duration of ventilation was the best guide to prognosis.\r"

Only three infants were included but evidence from this and some published case reports suggest that the tumours tend to regress in early infancy and again in adolescence. The prevalence of tumours in young infants with tuberous sclerosis is likely to be considerably above 50%. As other signs of tuberous sclerosis are usually absent at this age echocardiography may afford the most useful diagnostic test in early infancy.\r"

There were significant differences in incidence between those with consanguineous and nonconsanguineous parents and those whose mothers had previously given birth to malformed infants or who had had miscarriages, and those who had not. Significantly more defects were found among stillborn and low birthweight babies, among girls, and among those whose mothers were aged between 20 and 30 years. Just over a third (14) were breech presentations, and hydramnios was present in 16 (40%).\r"

Of these 89 patients 10 had a diagnostic laparotomy only. Eight patients had an anastomosis between the proximal bile duct and the intestine, and the remaining 71 had hepatic portoenterostomies. Bile drainage was re-established in 46 (65%). After successful hepatic portoenterostomy the development of cholangitis was the most important determinant of long term survival; five year survival was 54% in the 19 patients who had cholangitis and 91% in the 27 who did not. In the whole group of 71 patients the five year survival was 47%. Seventeen patients were at least 5 years of age at the time of writing, three of whom had had liver transplantation. Three patients have cirrhosis and hyperbilirubinaemia, and the other 11 have normal bilirubin concentrations and normal or slightly raised transaminase activities. To improve these results early surgical intervention in all children with extrahepatic biliary atresia is necessary, as are better methods of prophylaxis and treatment of cholangitis.\r"

One infant with severe myocarditis did not tolerate enalapril because of hypotension and later died of intractable heart failure. Six of the remaining patients had congenital systemic to pulmonary shunts and one had a simple aortic coarctation. Two weeks after starting enalapril the clinical features of heart failure had improved in all the infants, the mean (SEM) plasma sodium concentration had increased from 129 (2.4) to 136 (1.1) mmol/l and plasma urea concentration had fallen from 7.0 (0.85) to 2.9 (0.85) mmol/l. These data suggest that enalapril is a potentially useful treatment for severe heart failure in infancy.\r"

Infants of drug dependent mothers had more poor responses than the other children on neurological examination. This difference is significant only when data of infants of drug dependent mothers born at full term are analysed. Two tailed testing indicated that significantly more infants of drug dependent mothers than reference children had electro-encephalograms rated as suspect or abnormal. By the end of the first month the infants of drug dependent mothers tended to be more active, and they had worse scores than the reference children on the neonatal behavioural assessment scale. Analysing data only of infants born at full term, the groups differ significantly on the interactive items. The results of this study show that even after treatment for the neonatal abstinence syndrome, infants of drug dependent mothers seem to differ from comparison children, which could indicate later developmental problems.\r"

On the infant behaviour temperament questionnaire, infants of drug dependent mothers tended to have slightly better scores for 'duration of orienting' at the age of 9 months; five other dimensions of behaviour did not differ between the groups. The Bayley scales of infant development and neurological examination according to the method of Touwen did not show any significant differences among the groups at the ages of 6 or 12 months. At 12 months infants of drug dependent mothers had slightly but not significantly worse results on electroencephalography. Studied with multidisciplinary measurements, the development of infants of drug dependent mothers does not seem to diverge particularly from the development of the reference group.\r"

A response was achieved for 3805 (80%) children of whom 438 (11.5%) had had episodes of wheezing in the last year and 224 (5.9%) had been diagnosed as having asthma. Asthma treatment had been prescribed for 251 (6.6%) of all children, two thirds of all the children receiving drugs. Two hundred and sixty five (7%) children had lost time from school because of wheezing (median loss of seven days). Of the 64 children losing more than 10 days, 45 (70%) were not taking any drugs, or taking only beta agonists. The prevalence of wheezing found by this survey was comparable with that in similarly designed surveys, though the proportion of children diagnosed as having asthma was higher. Though doctors may now diagnose asthma more readily wheezing still remains an important cause of school absence and still seems to be undertreated.\r"

Gastro-oesophageal reflux during the night was confirmed in 20 infants. Three hundred and sixteen precipitous drops of more than one unit of pH were recorded during the studies, 186 during periods of wakefulness. Of 130 drops in pH during sleep, 62 (48%) began during active sleep and 62 during indeterminate sleep. Of the latter, 56 (90%) were associated with brief gross body movements. Only five of the drops in pH (4%) began during quiet sleep. Gastro-oesophageal reflux stopped during active sleep on 56 occasions (43%), in indeterminate sleep in 62 (47%), and in quiet sleep in 12 (9%). Episodes of gastro-oesophageal reflux starting or ending in quiet sleep were uncommon. The occurrence of gastro-oesophageal reflux during active sleep may partly explain why reflux during sleep is a risk factor for pulmonary disease.\r"

Uncontrolled discarding of chemical wastes creates the potential for risks to human health. Utilizing the National Priorities Listing (NPL) of hazardous waste sites developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), this study identified 593 waste sites in 339 U.S. counties in 49 states with analytical evidence of contaminated ground drinking water providing a sole source water supply. For each identified county, age-adjusted, site-specific cancer mortality rates for 13 major sites for the decade 1970-1979, for white males and females, were extracted from U.S. Cancer Mortality and Trends 1950-1979. Also, HWS and non-HWS counties that showed excess numbers of deaths were enumerated for each cancer selected. Significant associations (p less than .002) between excess deaths and all HWS counties were shown for cancers of the lung, bladder, esophagus, stomach, large intestine, and rectum for white males; and for cancers of the lung, breast, bladder, stomach, large intestine, and rectum for white females when compared to all non-HWS counties. There were no consistent geographical patterns that suggested a broad distribution of gastrointestinal cancers associated with HWSs throughout the United States, although we did identify a cluster of excess gastrointestinal cancers in counties within states located in EPA Region 3 (Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The prevalence of radiographic evidence of International Labour Office (ILO) category 1 or higher small opacities was 4.5% in 516 men who had never been employed in a dusty job other than in surface coal mining. Among these 516 workers, all 4 cases of ILO radiographic category 2 or 3 rounded opacities and 1 case of large opacities had been employed as a highwall drill operator or helper. The prevalence of category 1 or higher opacities increased with tenure as a highwall drill operator or helper (2.7% for 0 y, 6.5% for 1-9 yr, 25.0% for 10-19 y, and 55.6% for greater than or equal to 20 y drilling). Radiographic evidence of small rounded opacities, dyspnea, and decreases in FEV1.0, FVC, and peak flow were significantly related to tenure at drilling operations after adjusting for age, height, cigarette smoking status, and exposures in dusty jobs other than in surface coal mining. However, tenure in coal cleansing plants and other surface coal mine jobs were not related to significant health effects. The apparent excess prevalence of radiographic small rounded opacities in anthracite surface coal mine drillers suggests that quartz exposures have been increased. Average respirable quartz concentrations at surface coal mine drilling operations should be evaluated to determine whether exposures are within existing standards, and dust exposures should be controlled.\r"

After an initial training session, patients were exposed to air, 100 ppm carbon monoxide (CO), or 200 ppm CO on successive days in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over fashion. After exposure to 100 and 200 ppm CO, venous COHb levels averaged 4% and 6%, respectively. Symptom-limited supine exercise was performed after exposure. Eight of the 10 patients had evidence of exercise-induced ischemia--either angina, 1.0 mm ST depression, or abnormal ejection fraction response--during 1 or more exposure days. Ambulatory electrocardiograms were obtained on each day and analyzed for arrhythmia frequency and severity. On air and CO exposure days, each patient had only 0-1 ventricular premature beat/h in the 2 h prior to exposure, during the exposure period, during the subsequent exercise test, and in the 5 h following exercise. In conclusion, low-level CO exposure is not arrhythmogenic in patients with coronary artery disease and no ventricular ectopy at baseline.\r"

The proportionate mortality analysis was used to identify cancers that might be elevated in this occupational group compared to the total U.S. white male population, whereas case-control analyses more rigorously evaluated the disease association with occupation. Controls were selected from employees at USDA who died of any cause of death other than that cause of death represented by the case. In case-control analyses, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and colon cancer demonstrated a statistically significant linear trend (p less than .05) with duration of employment as either a forest or soil conservationist, which suggests an occupational etiology for both diseases. Soil conservationists who were last employed after 1960 experienced significantly elevated risks for NHL (OR = 2.6) and colon cancer (OR = 1.8), whereas those last employed before 1960 were not at an increased risk. Among forest conservationists, the risk for both NHL and colon cancer appeared to be elevated before and after 1960.\r"

Furthermore, with the ability to control acid secretion, emphasis has been placed on identifying gastrinoma patients who are potentially curable by tumor resection rather than by palliative gastrectomy. Despites estimates suggesting that 20-40% of sporadic gastrinoma patients can be successfully resected for cure, as many as 40% of such patients have occult tumors that elude detection. In an effort to better localize gastrinomas, we have used percutaneous transhepatic venous (THVS) gastrin sampling over the past 10 years. From 1978 to 1988, THVS was used in 46 patients in whom there was no other evidence of metastatic gastrinoma by conventional studies. Gastrinomas were found at operation in all but one patient. The purpose of this report is to emphasize that occult tumors are most often found in the duodenal wall, and frequently they may be no greater than 2 mm in diameter. Five recent cases illustrate that these small tumors or microgastrinomas may be the sole source of hypergastrinemia and can be cured by local excision. These recent cases emphasize that microgastrinomas are not usually palpable through the duodenal wall. They may be detected only after duodenotomy and meticulous evaluation of the mucosa by eversion and direct palpation. Duodenotomy and intraluminal exploration should be considered an essential component of the operation for patients with extrapancreatic gastrinomas.\r"

Gastrin levels were significantly higher in DU patients both in the fasting state (42.5 ng/l vs. 22.5 ng/l, p less than 0.001) and after the meal (130 vs. 60, p less than 0.02). Two separate patient subsets were identified: a \"hypergastrinemic\" (HRG) group exhibiting exaggerated gastrin responses and a \"Normogastrinemic\" (NOG) group comprised of patients with gastrin levels similar to those of controls. Only the HRG group exhibited a significant gastrin response to sham feeding. Both patient groups exhibited a delayed onset of duodenal acidity and delayed peak acid response after feeding indicative of delayed gastric emptying of the acid load. The HRG group exhibited a longer duodenal acid exposure and a prolonged return to premeal pH levels, suggesting a defective switch-off mechanism of acid secretion after duodenal acidification.\r"

The data was analyzed by contingency tables and chi square testing, and a stepwise logistic regression analysis was performed in order to reveal interactions between variables and to elucidate time trends in lethality rates. The total postperforation lethality was 7.4%, the postsurgical death rate was 6.6%, and the death rate among conservatively treated patients was 42.3%. Lethality was significantly influenced by year of hospital admission and increased markedly with the age of the patients. For all age groups, the lethality decreased markedly with time. Treatment delay was associated with a moderate but significant increase in lethality. In patients with gastric ulcer the lethality was 3.6 times higher than in those with duodenal ulcer. The death rate was similar in the duodenal and pyloric ulcer groups. Death rate decreased with time in both stomach ulcer, duodenal, and pyloric ulcer patients. There was no sex difference and no difference between patients treated with simple suture or gastric resection.\r"

The receptor was not found in the remaining 14 cases. AR negative HCCs were significantly more common among women and nonalcoholic patients. Otherwise, there were no significant difference in the clinicopathologic background between patients with AR positive HCCs and those with AR negative tumors. Three patients died of liver failure in the former group, whereas two died in the latter; one patient died of liver failure and the other died of pneumonia (results were not statistically significant). Excluding those five operative deaths, the recurrence rates were 67.9% in the group of patients with AR positive HCCs and 33.3% in the group of patients with AR negative tumors (0.1 less than p less than 0.05). The 5-year survival rate was significantly better (p less than 0.05) in patients with AR negative HCCs (62.2%) than in those with the positive tumors (17.3%). In light of the current results and previous experimental works by others, it is likely that testosterones enhance the growth and invasiveness of human HCC, which is mediated by AR in the tumor.\r"

  ".W": "To identify the factors that determine the morbidity and mortality of liver resection of metastases from colorectal carcinoma and the variables that may influence the pattern of recurrence, the survival time and the disease-free rate, a univariate and-multivariate statistical analysis (30 variables using Student's t-test, Fischer's exact test, and chi square test) was performed. Intraoperative blood loss of greater than 3500 ml was found to be a significant risk factor to developing postoperative complications (p less than 0.05 by x2). After a mean follow-up of 25.8 months, 26 of the 35 patients studied (74%) had recurrent disease. In the univariate analysis, the following factors appear to be reliable predictors of early recurrence: poor degree of differentiation of the primary colorectal tumor, the presence of multiple liver metastases, the male gender, and the presence of tumor at the margin of the resected hepatic tissue (p less than 0.05). However, only the latter two factors appeared also to affect the survival time and the disease-free rates at 2 years after hepatic resection of metastases (p less than 0.05). In the multivariate analysis (factors tested simultaneously), presence of an advanced liver metastatic disease (Stage II or III) consistently indicated early recurrence and poor survival (p less than 0.005). The liver was the most common site of recurrence as the sole site of recurrence (54%) or in combination with other sites (88%)--followed by the lungs (31%) and the site of colonic resection (8%). Twenty-nine (83%), 14 (40%), and nine (26%) patients survived without recurrent disease at 1, 2, and 3 or more years, respectively, after hepatic resection of metastases. In six patients (17%), no significant palliation was noted, primarily because of early recurrence (less than 6 months). From this data, resection of hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer appears to offer a realistic therapeutic option to a selected group of patients, but only if the resective procedure can be performed with an operative mortality rate of less than 5%.\r"

When the presence of each of these factors is weighted proportional to its coefficient of regression, patients with cholangitis could be scored on a scale of 0-27. A score of seven was clinically the most useful cut off--388 attacks of cholangitis associated with a score of less than 7 had a mortality rate of only 1.8%, whereas 61 attacks associated with a score greater than or equal to 7 had a mortality rate of 49%. The value of this scoring system needs to be confirmed in prospective studies, but it may prove useful, for example, in selecting a group of high-risk patients for urgent biliary decompression in an attempt to reduce the mortality associated with this pathology.\r"

  ".U": "89192593\r", 
  ".W": "The management of penetrating colon injury has been frequently debated in the literature, yet few reports have evaluated primary closure versus diverting colostomy in similarly injured patients. Diverting colostomy is the standard of care when mucosal penetration is present, but primary closure in civilian practice has generally had excellent results, although it has been restricted to less severely injured patients. Because the degree of injury may influence choice of treatment in modern practice, various indices of injury severity have been proposed for assessment of patients with penetrating colon trauma. As yet, however, there has been no cross-comparison of repair type versus injury severity. A retrospective study 76 patients who sustained penetrating colon trauma between January 1, 1979 and December 31, 1985 and who survived for at least 24 hours was conducted. Different preferences among attending surgeons and a more aggressive approach to the use of primary closure during the years of study led to an essentially random use of primary closure and diverting colostomy for moderate levels of colon injury, with mandatory colostomy reserved for the most serious injuries. Primary closure was performed in 37 patients (three having resection and anastomosis), and colostomy was performed in 39 patients. Severity of injury was evaluated by the Injury Severity Score (ISS), Penetrating Abdominal Trauma Index (PATI), and the Flint Colon Injury Score. Complications and outcome were evaluated as a function of severity of injury, and primary closure and colostomy were compared. Demographic profiles of the two groups did not differ regarding age, sex, mechanism of injury, shock, or delay between injury and operation. The mortality rate was 2.6% for each group. Major morbidity, including septic complications, occurred in 11% of the patients of the primary closure group and in 49% of those of the colostomy group. When PATI was less than 25, the Flint score was less than or equal to 2, or when the ISS was less than 25, primary closure resulted in fewer complications than did colostomy. Of the injury severity indices examined, the PATI most reliably predicted complications and specifically identified patients who whose outcome would be good with primary repair. These results suggest that the use of primary closure should be expanded in civilian penetrating colon trauma and that, even with moderate degrees of colon injury, primary closure provides an outcome equivalent to that provided by colostomy. In addition, the predictive value of the PATI suggests that it should be included along with other injury severity indices in trauma data bases.\r"

  ".W": "Reperfusion after limb ischemia leads to sequestration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) in the lungs and to leukocyte- (WBC) and thromboxane- (Tx) dependent respiratory dysfunction. This study examines the intermediary role of the chemoattractants leukotriene (LT)B4 and complement (C) fragments. Anesthetized sheep with chronic lung lymph fistulae underwent 2 hours of tourniquet ischemia of both hind limbs. In untreated controls (n = 7), 1 minute after tourniquet release, mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) rose from 13 to 38 mmHg (p less than 0.05) and returned to baseline within 30 minutes. Pulmonary artery wedge pressure was unchanged from 3.6 mmHg. There were increases in plasma LTB4 levels from 2.46 to 9.34 ng/ml (p less than 0.01), plasma TxB2 levels from 211 to 735 pg/ml (p less than 0.05), and lung lymph TxB2 from 400 to 1005 pg/ml (p less than 0.05). C3 levels were 96% of baseline values. Thirty minutes after reperfusion, lung lymph flow (QL) increased from 4.3 to 8.3 ml/30 minutes (p less than 0.05), lymph/plasma protein ratio was unchanged from 0.6, and the lymph protein clearance increased from 2.6 to 4.6 ml/30 minutes (p less than 0.05), data consistent with increased microvascular permeability. WBC count fell within the first hour from 6853 to 3793/mm3 (p less than 0.01). Lung histology showed leukosequestration, 62 PMN/10 high-power fields (HPF) and proteinaceous exudates. In contrast to this untreated ischemic group, animals treated with the lypoxygenase inhibitor diethylcarbamazine (n = 5) demonstrated a blunted reperfusion-induced rise in MPAP to 17 mmHg (p less than 0.05). There were no increases in LTB4, TxB2, QL or lymph protein clearance (p less than 0.05). WBC count was unchanged and lung leukosequestration was reduced to 40 PMN/10 HPF (p less than 0.05). Decomplementation with cobra venom factor (n = 4) resulted in plasma C3 levels, 10% of baseline, but tourniquet release still led to pulmonary hypertension, elevated LTB4, TxB2 levels, and a decline in WBC count similar to that of untreated ischemic control animals. Histology showed 46 PMN/10 HPF sequestered in the lungs. Further, bilateral hind limb ischemia in either genetically sufficient (n = 10) or deficient (n = 10) C5 mice led to significant lung leukosequestration of 108 and 106 PMN/10 HPF, respectively, compared with 42 and 47 PMN/10 HPF in sham C5(+) and C5 (-) mice (n = 20) (p less than 0.01). These results suggest that the lung leukosequestration and increased microvascular permeability after lower torso ischemia are mediated by the chemotactic agent LTB4, but not by the complement system.\r"

A 5-year burn center experience with tracheostomies used in this fashion is presented. Ninety-nine tracheostomies were performed in 3246 patients who had indications of prolonged respiratory failure or acute loss of airway. Although colonization of the sputum was universal, neither rates of pulmonary sepsis nor mortality were significantly increased in patients who underwent tracheostomies. Twenty-eight patients developed late upper airway sequelae, including tracheal stenosis (TS), tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF), and tracheoarterial fistula (TAF). Duration of intubation correlated only with development of TAF, whereas patients in whom TEF developed were significantly older and more likely to have evidence of tracheal necrosis at the time of tracheostomy. The pathogenesis of upper airway sequelae in these patients as divergent responses to the combined insults of inhalation injury, infection, and intubation is considered.\r"

From 1985 to 1987, ten patients receiving the surgical services at the University of Florida suffered CVC vascular erosions. By chest roentgenogram, nine CVC tips were in the superior vena cava (SVC), although three catheter tips abutted the lateral wall of the SVC. One catheter tip was in the right atrium. All patients had sudden onset of symptoms, the most common of which was shortness of breath. Initial diagnosis was respiratory insufficiency in five patients, cardiac failure in three patients, pulmonary embolism in one, and sepsis in one. Four patients required intensive care. Two patients suffered pericardial tamponade, and pleural effusions developed in eight patients. One patient died of cardiac arrest. The average time interval from CVC placement to onset of symptoms was 60.2 hours, and from the onset of symptoms to the time of diagnosis, the interval was 16.7 hours. The mean volume obtained at thoracentesis was 1324 ml and at pericardiocentesis was 250 ml.\r"

Of the 55 survivors, all of whom were transferred to two major medical centers, 29 were hospitalized. Among those admitted, a high rate of primary blast injuries was found, including perforated ear drums (76%), blast lung (38%), and abdominal blast injuries (14%). Two of the latter patients suffered bowel perforations, which were diagnosed with considerable delay. Eight patients (31%) had sustained life-threatening trauma, consisting of a combination of primary, secondary, and tertiary blast injuries. The overall mortality rate was 10.3%. The large number of primary blast injuries, including the unexpected finding of bowel perforations, is explained by the high amplitude of the air pressure wave (3.8-5.2 atm) and its relatively long duration (2-3 msec) resulting from the detonation of the high-energy explosive charge in the small, enclosed space of the bus. Besides the usual wounds sustained by victims of an explosion that occurs in a confined space, the possibility of primary blast injury to the abdomen and to the lungs should be taken into account by the treating surgeon.\r"

There were 90 recurrences, including second primaries, and 99 deaths in the group receiving transfusion; in the group without transfusion, recurrent cancer developed in 74 patients, and 68 died. Survival comparisons, adjusted for stage and cell type using the stratified log-rank statistic, showed significant reduction in survival (p = 0.007) for patients receiving transfusion. Time to recurrence was shorter for patients receiving transfusion (p = 0.035), but became less significant when adjusted for both cell type and stage (p = 0.11). Blood transfusion within the perioperative period appears to have an adverse effect on survival and recurrence in patients undergoing surgical resection for lung cancer.\r"

  ".W": "From 1976 to 1988, 1,593 patients underwent valve replacement with a porcine (878 patients) or a pericardial bioprosthesis (715 patients). There were 701 aortic, 678 mitral, and 214 multiple-valve replacements. Follow-up was obtained for 1,559 patients (98%). Early mortality was 9% (79 patients) in the porcine valve group and 5% (37 patients) among patients with a pericardial valve (p less than 0.01). Late survival after replacement with porcine valves was 80% +/- 1% and 62% +/- 3% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. With pericardial valves, 5-year survival was 79% +/- 2%. Among valve-related complications, rates of freedom from thromboembolism, endocarditis, and hemorrhage after 6 years were similar for both valve groups. Freedom from reoperation at 6 years was also similar after aortic (96% versus 91%) or multiple-valve replacement (95% versus 88%). However, for mitral valve replacement, freedom from reoperation was significantly better with porcine valves than with pericardial valves at 6 years (92% versus 68%; p less than 0.001). This difference was mainly due to the Ionescu-Shiley valve, which accounted for 83% of primary tissue failures among pericardial bioprostheses implanted in the mitral position (10/12 patients). After 6 years, freedom from primary tissue failure of mitral valves was 92% +/- 2% with porcine and 70% +/- 11% with pericardial bioprostheses (p less than 0.0001). The degree of clinical improvement among survivors was similar with both valve types. Thus, in the aortic position, pericardial valves compare with porcine valves up to 6 years, whereas in the mitral position, the durability of the former is significantly less, mainly because of the suboptimal performance of the Ionescu-Shiley pericardial bioprosthesis.\r"

In study 1 there were 14 patients without reflux complications, 14 with esophagitis grade I to III, 13 with esophageal stricture, and 12 with Barrett's epithelium (6 of whom had a stricture). The prevalence of a mechanically defective sphincter increased with the progression of the esophageal injury; 50% in the patients without complications to 84% and 92% in those with stricture or Barrett's epithelium, respectively. Similarly, a decrease in amplitude of contractions in the distal esophagus was observed in patients with stricture and patients with Barrett's epithelium. In study 2, these findings were applied in the surgical management of 28 consecutive patients with a reflux-induced stricture. Preoperative motility studies were performed after patients were dilated to 60F. Control of reflux by a Nissen fundoplication gave excellent (86%) to good (14%) results in patients who had relief of dysphagia after dilation or adequate motility, or both. Four patients with both persistent dysphagia after dilation and inadequate motility underwent resection. Transmural presented are helpful in the selection of the optimal surgical procedure for the treatment of dilatable reflux-induced strictures.\r"

The tube has been used for palliation in 11 patients with malignant obstruction of the airway, and as the sole treatment or as an adjunct to operation in 36 other patients. Based on the satisfactory results with the use of these tubes, we have utilized silicone stents in the bronchus and bifurcation prostheses at the carina. In the past, we have inserted the T tubes through a tracheostomy stoma. More recently, we have used a technique for endoscopic placement of the T tubes in which the horizontal limb is pulled out through the tracheostomy stoma. This technique facilitates introduction of the tube and maintains the airway during insertion. The use of silicone stents provides an important tool in the management of complicated airway problems, and we anticipate their increased use in the future.\r"

In group 1 (n = 6), no attempts were made to control proximal hypertension, whereas in group 2 (n = 6), proximal blood pressure was controlled with intravenous infusion of SNP. There was no significant difference in proximal or distal blood pressure or cerebrospinal fluid pressure between the two groups at baseline. During the crossclamp interval, the mean proximal aortic pressure rose from 108 +/- 21 to 146 +/- 14 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) in the control group, whereas the mean blood pressure in the SNP group was maintained at 99.8 +/- 12 mm Hg (p = not significant compared with baseline blood pressure). Mean distal aortic pressure decreased from systemic values to 23 +/- 7 mm Hg in control animals and to 11 +/- 5 mm Hg in the SNP group (p less than 0.005). In the latter group, cerebrospinal fluid pressure increased significantly from 10.6 +/- 1.9 to 20.1 +/- 5.5 mm Hg (p less than 0.005). In animals receiving SNP, spinal cord blood flow was decreased in the lower spinal cord segments and increased in the upper cord segments. When compared with controls, this difference did not reach significance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Only 3 patients survive. Median survival of all patients was 7.5 months. Median survival of patients whose tumor was surgically resected was 17.5 months. Advanced stage of disease at the time of diagnosis characterized this group of young patients with primary cancer of the lung.

There were 10 male and 8 female patients with a mean age of 36.8 years (range, 9 to 62 years). On the basis of mitotic activity, cellular necrosis, and nuclear pleomorphism, we subclassified these tumors as low grade (15 patients) or high grade (3 patients). The achievement of complete resection and low-grade versus high-grade staging correlated with prognosis. All 12 patients who had a low-grade tumor that was completely excised are alive with no evidence of disease at a mean follow-up of 4.7 years (range, 1 to 27 years). All high-grade tumors proved fatal within 16 months. Two of the 3 high-grade tumors were unresectable because of extensive local disease. Patients with low-grade tumors and microscopically positive margins require close follow-up and can undergo a successful repeat resection. Nine of the 16 resections were sleeve resections, high-lighting the importance of conservative lung-sparing procedures in these central airway tumors. Both patients with an unresectable high-grade tumor had radiation therapy postoperatively and died 11 months later. The role of radiation therapy with high-grade tumors or incomplete resection has yet to be determined.\r"

Preoperative fiberoptic bronchoscopy revealed a characteristic pink, smooth, bleeding tumor in 71.4% of the patients with a typical carcinoid and 16.7% of those with an atypical carcinoid (p less than 0.05). Eight pneumonectomies, seven bilobectomies, 34 lobectomies, three lobectomies with bronchoplasty, six bronchotomies with bronchoplasty, and two segmental resections were performed. All patients entered follow-up, and 47 were followed for more than 5 years. Ten-year survival was 89.6% for patients with a typical carcinoid and 60% for those with an atypical carcinoid. Ten-year survival was 88.1% for patients with carcinoids without lymph node involvement. All patients with lymph node involvement died within 5 years. Overall, 5 of the 8 patients having pneumonectomy died of acute cardiorespiratory failure. We conclude that a limited surgical resection with or without bronchoplasty and systematic lymphadenectomy is the procedure of choice in patients with typical carcinoids. On the other hand, atypical carcinoids are comparable to well-differentiated malignancies of the lung. Whenever possible, pneumonectomy should be avoided in favor of bronchial sleeve resection.\r"

By following the shortest route from its origin to the recipient coronary artery, IMA use can be maximized. Seven cadavers were studied to determine that shortest route for the left and right IMAs. The shortest route for the left IMA to the left anterior descending coronary, diagonal, and circumflex coronary arteries was through the pericardium (p less than or equal to 0.01). For the right IMA, the significantly shortest routes were across the anterior heart for the left anterior descending and diagonal arteries, through the right pericardium for the right coronary artery or posterior descending artery, and through the pericardium and transverse sinus for the circumflex artery. Thus, any coronary artery can be reached with an in situ IMA, and the route through the pericardium is markedly shorter to ipsilateral coronary arteries.\r"

Ninety-six percent of the patients are socially active, 92.0% have a good exercise tolerance, and 79.3% participate in sports.

Peak systolic right ventricular/left ventricular pressure ratio decreased in the postoperative period in 65.4% of patients, remained unchanged in 3.8%, and increased in 30.8%. Minimal residual anomalies can modify the prognosis substantially. Of our patients, 53.3% of those with a shunt (p less than 0.05), 37.5% of those with stenosis (not significant), and 53.8% of those with pulmonary incompetences (p = not significant) have fair or unsatisfactory results. The associated defects are particularly unfavorable. Rhythm and conduction disturbances have resulted in fair or unsatisfactory results in 65.1% of patients. Such a disturbance occurring soon after bypass must be considered an incremental risk factor: 52.9% of patients seen with rhythm and conduction disturbances show the same disturbances later (p less than 0.001).\r"

On average, there were no significant adverse effects of cost-sharing plans, relative to a free-care plan, on either psychological well-being or psychological distress, when the cost-sharing plans included full catastrophic coverage. Those with high mental health status but low income at baseline had significantly more favorable mental health outcomes on the cost-sharing plans than on the free-care plan. We cannot definitively comment on the effects of insurance generosity for the sick poor. Our findings apply in the context of mandated comprehensive mental and general health coverage for a general nonelderly, nondisabled household population.\r"

Sedative effects were greatest with triazolam, followed next by temazepam; peak effects closely coincided with peak plasma concentrations. Differential recovery from sedation corresponded in part to differences in mean elimination halflife, although sedative effects returned to baseline before plasma drug concentrations became undetectable. Sedation following flurazepam administration was less intense than with triazolam and temazepam. When tested at three hours after dosing, none of the active treatments impaired learning of a 16-item word list. However, at 24 hours, triazolam recipients could not recall a significant fraction of what was learned. Thus, dynamic differences among three benzodiazepine hypnotics may be partly explained by kinetic differences, as well as, we should caution, by possible \"clinical inequivalence\" in dosage.\r"

The severity of manic dysphoria tended to correlate with the number of previous hospitalizations, a finding that was highly significant in women (n = 27). Medication-free manic patients (n = 22) had significant elevations in cerebrospinal fluid norepinephrine concentrations compared with depressed and euthymic patients and normal volunteers, and the degree of elevation correlated significantly with the degree of manic dysphoria, anger, and anxiety rated at the time of the lumbar puncture. Patients with dysphoric mania, recognized by Kraepelin to have poor prognoses, have been reported to respond poorly to lithium carbonate but may be among those who respond to carbamazepine. Clinical, biologic, and pharmacologic response characteristics of manic subgroups, particularly those with extreme dysphoric components to their illness, appear to be clinically meaningful and deserving of further investigation.\r"

For both criteria sets, the internal consistencies and item-scale correlations were low. Both definitions were associated with overall symptom severity and the melancholia symptom subscale; however, only DSM-III melancholics scored higher on the nonmelancholia symptom subscale. The DSM-III-R criteria were associated with more of the predicted correlates of endogenous subtyping. According to both definitions, melancholics were characterized by less stress, greater symptom severity, and less frequent nonserious suicide attempts prior to admission. The DSM-III-R melancholic subtyping was additionally associated with a family history of antisocial personality and substance abuse, presence of a premorbid personality disorder, age, and a tendency to blame others for the depression.\r"

Approximately one third of the DSM-III cases that were not detected by the PSE-Catego system was due to the restricted coverage of the latter system; the remaining two thirds could be attributed to differences in threshold and time framing. Compared with DSM-III, the PSE-Catego system showed a strong bias toward depression, and the system was extremely insensitive to the detection of social phobias and obsessive-compulsive disorders. Only 58% of cases of depression and 46% of cases of anxiety were diagnosed by both systems. The results are compared with other studies, and some consequences are discussed.\r"

The nutritional status of 51 SCI patients treated between 1983 and 1986 was assessed at two, four, and eight weeks after injury. Nutrient deficiencies such as albumin (100% of patients), carotene (62%), transferrin (37%), ascorbate (25%), thiamine (24%), folate (20%), and copper (11%) were documented most frequently at two weeks postinjury. There was an average of 2.0, 1.6, and 1.2 nutrient abnormalities per patient at two, four, and eight weeks postinjury, respectively. Although most depressed nutrient parameters improved with time, diet-dependent plasma proteins such as albumin and transferrin remained low throughout the entire eight-week period. Mean body weight declined 1.3 +/- 3.9 kg during the first two weeks, 2.0 +/- 4.4 kg between two and four weeks, and 0.4 +/- 2.0 kg between four and eight weeks after injury. Significant findings also included a strong correlation between plasma albumin, ascorbate, and carotene levels and maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure (p less than .05). Although nutrient status usually improved with time and was not definitely associated with an increased risk of secondary medical complications, prudence dictates that these deficiencies should be prevented by appropriate intervention.\r"

Three measurements with each instrument were taken during three different sessions for active shoulder, elbow, and wrist movements. The within-session reliability was higher for the goniometer. The Pearson correlation coefficients suggest a strong relationship between the Ortho Ranger and the goniometer for shoulder internal and external rotation, and a poor relationship for elbow movements.

Eight physically active young men completed eight running tests at their predetermined \"most comfortable\" speeds with zero, 1.6, 3.2, and 4.8 kg of additional weight equally distributed on the ankles or wrists. Energy expenditure and heart rate increased as a linear function of the additional weight placed at both anatomic locations. The magnitudes of these responses were significantly higher with the weights at the ankles than at the wrists, and were independent of the strength and endurance of the pertinent muscle groups involved in overcoming the additional weight. Blood lactate concentrations tended to increase during the loaded runs. However, the values were not significantly different from those observed during control (zero load) runs. Perceived exertion increased significantly over the control value when the heaviest weights were placed at the ankles and wrists. Since ankle and wrist weights increase training intensity and energy expenditure during treadmill running, they may result in greater increases in cardiovascular fitness and greater weight loss than would be realized by training without their use.\r"

Performance was compared with 22 age-matched control subjects. Repeated measures ANOVAs were performed with patients subdivided into groups by laterality of lesion and visual field status (a strong predictor of psychometric performance, particularly in the hemispatial-neglect domain). During this initial year after stroke onset, significant improvements were observed in hemispatial neglect and affect comprehension in the two right-brain-damaged groups, but not the left-brain-damaged group. There was also a trend for improvement in observer rating of depression in all three groups. However, there was poor resolution of reaction time and self-reported depression in all three groups. These findings suggest that these latter domains should be targeted for more aggressive therapeutic intervention. An important component of such intervention, in addition to direct treatment of deficits, should be education of both patient and family as to the nature of deficits, expectations regarding resolution, and appropriate attributions of changed behavior after stroke.\r"

One hundred fifty-eight patients completed the FASQ as part of an initial multidisciplinary evaluation of chronic pain. Reliability was reaffirmed through split-half and alternate-form methods. Responses were examined to explore relationships to aspects of disability. Although job functions were not directly assessed, the scores of employed vs unemployed respondents differed significantly. Findings were related to Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory scale scores but appeared to reflect a separate phenomenon. Scale 1 (Hs) was the most useful scale for predicting level of reported impairment. Nonparametric methods showed levels of functioning varying significantly by site of pain complaint. Patients with back pain reported the most difficulty; those with head pain and genital pain reported the least difficulty. An internal structure appropriate to chronic pain populations was discerned, with two general factors measuring either physical-motoric or cognitive-social aspects of disability. Aside from constraints associated with the use of self-report methods, the FASQ may be helpful as part of efforts to portray pain-related disability.\r"

Group II contained 11 individuals who at times achieved complete velopharyngeal closure. Certain measures of perceived articulatory adequacy were found to distinguish between the two groups. Specifically, speakers who were velopharyngeally incompetent produced an articulatory error pattern characterized by better performance for the consonant subcategory nasals-glides than for pressure consonants. Speakers who at times were achieving velopharyngeal closure did not exhibit a marked difference between these two consonant subcategories. Clinical use of measurement of articulatory adequacy as a gross indicator of velopharyngeal competence is suggested and limitations are discussed.\r"

Five deaths occurred in totally dependent children with both tracheostomies and gastrostomies in place. Ten of 22 children with TI (48% of survivors) achieved independence in three functional areas by two years, whereas none of 14 with AME achieved functional independence in any area at two years (p = 0.001). Only one of the 18 who were dependent in all three areas at six months achieved partial independence in any area on reevaluation at two years. Institutionalization at two years was strongly predicted by six-month functional status (p less than 0.01). Four of 18 children dependent at six months returned to home care by two years, whereas all 16 children who achieved partial independence within six months of insult were cared for at home at two years (p less than 0.001), regardless of age or injury type. The need for tracheostomy at two years correlated with functional status at six months (p less than 0.01). Two-year survival was unexpectedly high for this group of children when compared to studies in adults. Functional status at six months is a strong predictor of dependency and institutionalization at two years.\r"

Treatment regimens frequently include exercises and instruction for postural correction. Clinical assessment of posture, however, tends to be subjective in nature. The purpose of this study was to determine the reliability of a new objective technique of posture measurement and to establish normal standards for the technique. This study used a computer-assisted slide digitizing system called Postural Analysis Digitizing System (PADS) to determine characteristic values for head and shoulder girdle posture and characteristic range of motion for head protraction-retraction and shoulder protraction-retraction in a sample of able-bodied young men. PADS is a modification of a two-dimensional slide digitizing system developed for measuring trunk range of motion. Twenty male subjects were photographed in a neutral position, the maximally protracted position, and the maximally retracted position of the head and scapula. Ten subjects were evaluated once, and ten were evaluated twice. The slide photographs were analyzed using a computer-assisted digitizing system. Well-defined anatomic landmarks were used to determine angular relationships in the head, neck, and shoulders. The reliability of the system was tested by calculating an intraclass correlation coefficient, student t-test, and the percent error for each position. The positions were considered reproducible, and reliability of the system was considered adequate for postural analysis. Mean values for the positions were 28.48 degrees, 51.97 degrees, and 62.09 degrees for head protraction, the neutral position, and head retraction, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We systematically investigated the healing canine end-to-end choledochal anastomosis and tested the hypothesis that common bile duct anastomoses sutured with monofilament polyglyconate absorbable suture would heal with less stricture formation and greater tensile strength than those sutured with braided polyglactin 910 and chromic catgut sutures. Seventy-six canines, randomized to control vs sutured groups, underwent either mobilization (controls) or transection of the mid-common bile duct and were allowed to heal 5, 10, 15, or 50 days postoperatively before sacrifice. The type of absorbable suture used to construct a common bile duct anastomosis was found to have no major effect on anastomotic strictures nor on anastomotic breaking strength. Polyglyconate suture caused significantly less perianastomotic inflammation than did chromic suture, with polyglactin 910 sutures evoking an intermediate inflammatory response. Surgeons may safely choose sutures for biliary procedures based on the clinical circumstances and personal preference.\r"

No patient with a positive DPL by count alone had life-threatening intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Pelvic fracture stabilization with early external pelvic fixation was associated with less requirement for blood transfusion (10 +/- 1 U) than with the pneumatic antishock garment (17 +/- 3 U). Nine patients with pelvic arterial injuries underwent angiographic embolization, and eight patients died (89%).

Sterile (n = 6) and infected (n = 19) Dacron grafts were used to replace the abdominal aorta of 25 dogs. After five weeks, grafts were explanted, and peak tensile force (measured in kilograms) required for anastomotic disruption was measured using a linear gain tensiometer. Anastomotic tensile strength (mean +/- SEM) of infected grafts (5.4 +/- 0.5 kg) was decreased when compared with that of sterile, control grafts (9.0 +/- 0.9 kg). The decreased anastomotic tensile strength of infected grafts was the result of an inflammatory aortitis adjacent to the suture line. Only grafts infected with the study strain of bacteria demonstrated signs of infection. In 19 dogs, the graft infection was treated by graft excision, antibiotic administration, and in situ graft replacement (Dacron or polytetrafluoroethylene prostheses). After five weeks and 12 weeks, anastomotic tensile strength of polytetrafluoroethylene (10.6 +/- 0.6 kg) and Dacron (10.8 +/- 0.5 kg) replacement grafts was similar to that of uninfected control grafts. In situ replacement of vascular prostheses infected by S epidermidis can result in graft healing with normal anastomotic bonding.\r"

Perfusate samples were serially assayed for radioactivity. After perfusion, grafts were sectioned into four segments and assayed for retained radioactivity. All graft segments were hematoxylin stained and examined under light microscopy for evaluation of cell density. Excellent endothelial cell adherence (90%) was observed under both hemodynamic conditions at 120 minutes, with most losses occurring within the first 15 minutes. No differences were seen between high- and low-shear conditions or proximal vs distal graft segments.\r"

We examined the systemic and visceral hemodynamic response to low doses of human recombinant TNF in rats. Each animal received a 30-minute intravenous infusion of either saline solution (n = 8) or TNF (n = 8) in a dose of 0.25 mg/kg or 1.0 mg/kg. Thermodilution cardiac output, blood pressure, pulse, vascular resistance, effective hepatic blood flow (galactose clearance), and effective renal plasma flow (p-aminohippurate clearance) were determined at time = 2 hours. The 0.25-mg/kg dose had no apparent effect on systemic hemodynamics. The 1.0-mg/kg dose produced a hyperdynamic systemic circulatory response with an elevated cardiac output, tachycardia, and a diminished systemic vascular resistance. Effective hepatic blood flow was exquisitely sensitive to even the lowest dose of TNF, with a 29% reduction despite the normal cardiac output. Renal flow was unaffected by either dose. Tumor necrosis factor-induced systemic and visceral hemodynamic changes are remarkably similar to those seen in gram-negative sepsis, suggesting that TNF may occupy a proximal position in the pathogenesis of overwhelming infection.\r"

To evaluate the potential impact of CPB on effective hepatic blood flow, 10 patients undergoing CPB for cardiac procedures were studied. Effective hepatic blood flow was measured in each patient during the operative procedure but before institution of CPB and during CPB as well. Effective hepatic blood flow was measured by the galactose clearance technique. Blood lactate and pyruvate levels were also measured before and during CPB. During CPB, effective hepatic blood flow was consistently reduced by an average of 19%. Although for most patients this reduction seems well tolerated, in a minority of patients it may contribute to postoperative hepatic dysfunction.\r"

These patients fasted for a longer period of time postoperatively (15 +/- 21 vs 4 +/- 3 days) than those undergoing later cholecystectomy. Significantly more of these patients required transfusion (38% vs 7%), mechanical ventilation (50% vs 11%), and total parenteral nutrition (50% vs 18%). Cholelithiasis frequently becomes symptomatic after laparotomy for other intra-abdominal conditions. Patients who require mechanical ventilation, transfusions, and parenteral nutrition and who are slow to resume enteral nutrition are more likely to require early cholecystectomy. Concomitant cholecystectomy adds minimal morbidity to other procedures and should be undertaken unless specific contraindications exist, particularly in this high-risk group.\r"

  ".W": "Unlike dietary-induced cholesterol gallstones, which may disappear spontaneously when the lithogenic diet is withdrawn, little is known about the natural history of pigment gallstones. We examined whether pigment gallstone disease, which can be uniformly induced in the dog by six weeks of a methionine-deficient diet, can be reversed by return to normal diet. As previously reported, all dogs develop pigment gallstones as well as significant increases in biliary total calcium, free ionized calcium, and cholesterol concentrations after six weeks of a lithogenic diet. These changes are accompanied by a significant increase in the concentration of unconjugated bile salts in bile. In addition, histologic changes in the gallbladder wall occur that are consistent with a moderate degree of chronic cholecystitis. This study clearly demonstrates that return to a normal diet for six weeks allows bile composition to normalize, gallstones to disappear in 50% of dogs, and gallbladder histologic changes to return toward normal. Thus, it would appear that pigment gallstone disease in this model may be reversible, at least early during its course. Although the relevance of these findings to pigment gallstones in humans must be established, the potential for nonoperative treatment of pigment gallstones should not be discounted.\r"

Intravenous amino acids caused abrupt and significant 45% to 73% reductions in stimulated pancreatic protein, bicarbonate, and volume outputs. There were no significant associated changes in plasma hormone concentrations and no similar immediate pancreatic inhibition with IV mannitol, thus suggesting a possible direct inhibitory effect of amino acids. Intraduodenal amino acids and IV fat evoked no significant pancreatic output suppression. Intraduodenal fat rapidly caused a significant 40% to 62% reductions in stimulated outputs that were associated with an 81% rise in plasma pancreatic polypeptide concentration, suggesting a gut-mediated inhibition. We conclude that IV amino acids and intraduodenal fat both inhibited stimulated pancreatic secretion but probably by different mechanisms.\r"

The electrical conductance of the surface colonic epithelium increased in CF1 mice from a mean (+/- SEM) of 41.1 +/- 3.0 milliSiemens.cm-2 (mS.cm-2) in controls to 52.6 +/- 3.1 mS.cm-2 following dimethylhydrazine treatment. The conductance decreased in the cancer-resistant DBA group from 154.6 +/- 44.1 mS.cm-2 in controls to 35.1 +/- 17.2 mS.cm-2 following dimethylhydrazine treatment. This difference in response to the carcinogen may partly explain differences in susceptibility noted between these two species. Epithelial impedance analysis may be of use in the early detection of the colon at risk for subsequent cancer development.\r"

These potential limitations include physician underordering, storage interval, and erythropoietic response. We found that a continuing medical education intervention increased the amount of autologous blood requested by physicians for storage: from 121 U for 50 patients (mean = 2.4) before CME to 195 U for 65 patients (mean = 3.0) afterward; eight (16%) of 50 patients had 4 U or more requested before CME vs 25 (38%) of 65 patients afterward. Continuing medical education had no impact on mean (+/- SD) effective storage interval, 22.6 +/- 9.0 vs 21.6 +/- 9.4 days. Thirty (17%) of 175 patients were deferred (hematocrit less than or equal to 0.34) and were unable to donate units of blood requested; of these, 13 (43%) received homologous blood compared with 19 (13%) of 145 not deferred. We conclude that a significant percentage of patients are deferred from autologous donation because of hematocrit limitations and receive homologous blood. This problem is not related to physician underordering or inappropriate physician transfusion behavior, but rather to the erythropoietic response to serial phlebotomy over a limited storage interval. Future studies should focus on mechanisms to maximize autologous blood procurement.\r"

Thirty patients underwent general anesthesia. There were only four perioperative complications: ventricular ectopy, ventricular fibrillation, nodal rhythm, and pulmonary edema.

In summary, patients with blunt trauma who have sustained a cardiac contusion can undergo elective operation with a low incidence of complication.

Identical DRw10 beta 1 chain genes were found in both patients. These were shown to encode the epitope recognized by monoclonal antibody 109d6. This antibody also recognizes an epitope on the DRw53 beta 2 chain of the DR4 haplotype.

We found that the leukocyte count (white blood cell [WBC] count) decreased within a few hours. In 4 SF samples from patients with mild inflammation (initial range 3,150-6,200 WBC/mm3), the WBC count decreased into a \"noninflammatory\" range (less than 2,000/mm3) within 5-6 hours. In 3 of 5 SF samples that on the first day were found to be laden with crystals of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD), the crystals were much less abundant and were difficult to recognize by the next day. CPPD crystals dissolved completely in all SF samples by 3-8 weeks of the study. Monosodium urate crystals remained detectable throughout the 8 weeks of study, but they became smaller, less birefringent, and less numerous with time. Clumps of apatite-like crystals persisted for several months. Most SF samples initially negative for apatite-like crystals remained negative over time. New, artifactual crystals, including alizarin red S-positive clumps or star-shaped arrays, plate-like structures, positively birefringent Maltese crosses, and hematoidin crystals, developed with time. Because of these observations, we urge prompt examination of SF specimens to avoid the problems of misdiagnosing borderline inflammatory fluids, missing CPPD crystals that dissolve with time, or over-interpreting the findings because of the new, artifactual crystals.\r"

We measured KS and HA in dogs to determine if there was an elevation of these serum glycosaminoglycans in a canine model of OA. A single intraarticular injection of 1 mg of chymopapain into a shoulder joint increased serum KS by tenfold, and HA by less than twofold, in 24 hours. Serum KS and HA levels were 3-5-fold higher in dogs younger than 2 months of age than in older dogs. Serum KS and HA concentrations and synovial fluid KS concentrations were unrelated to spontaneous cartilage degeneration in 1-year-old dogs. Higher KS levels in synovial fluid correlated with higher KS levels in serum (r = 0.54, P less than 0.025). The mean KS concentration in sera of older dogs (greater than 3 years old) with OA was 37% higher than that in disease-free controls, but the difference between the groups was not statistically significant. Thus, elevated levels of serum KS and HA do not appear to have clinical significance in this model of OA.\r"

  ".W": "We have been investigating whether murine lupus is associated with endogenous type C retroviral expression. We used Northern blot analyses and oligonucleotide probes, which are able to distinguish the envelope genes of the xenotropic and mink cell focus-forming (MCF) classes of type C retroviruses. Xenotropic expression in the spleen varied markedly among inbred mouse strains; although all strains expressed a 1.8-kb transcript, only one-half expressed one or more larger transcripts (8.4, 7.2, and/or 3.0 kb). Autoimmune disease did not correlate with expression of any of the xenotropic transcripts. Xenotropic and MCF transcripts were expressed independently among the mouse strains studied. Splenic RNA from all strains contained 7.2-, 3.0-, and 1.8-kb MCF transcripts. Some strains also expressed 8.4-kb MCF splenic RNA. There was a strong association between murine lupus and expression of 8.4-kb MCF transcripts: 6 of 6 lupus-prone strains, but only 2 of 11 nonautoimmune strains, had detectable 8.4-kb MCF RNA. The xid and Yaa mutations had minimal effects on expression of 8.4-kb MCF-related transcripts, despite their major and opposite effects on disease. Moreover, New Zealand black mice highly expressed this RNA from day 1 of life, before disease development. The data suggest that expression of 8.4-kb MCF endogenous retroviral transcripts is a primary feature of murine lupus and is not secondary to disease expression.\r"

In this model, after waning of the inflammation, flare reactions can be induced by a rechallenge with the specific antigen. Herein we show that such flare reactions can still be induced several weeks after waning of the joint inflammation, as was demonstrated both in normal C57B1/6 mice and in athymic C57B1 nude mice. The results in the latter group indicate that T cells of the recipient mice are not necessary for the elicitation of flare reactions. On histologic examination, the inflammatory infiltrates in the knee joints of the nude mice appeared to be mainly granulocytic. The cloned T cells persisted and remained functionally reactive in the knee joint for at least 2 weeks in the absence of the antigen, and thus, in the absence of inflammation. In view of the similarities between induced joint inflammation in mice and rheumatoid arthritis in humans, these data may be relevant to our understanding of the processes involved in the latter disease.\r"

Significant differences were found between the mean RC (+/- SD) in healthy individuals (1.27 +/- 0.16) and the mean RC in RA patients with intercurrent infection (1.74 +/- 0.90), as well as with the mean RC in RA patients with grades III and IV disease activity (0.92 +/- 0.18 and 0.81 +/- 0.25, respectively). Moreover, an additional microheterogeneous form of AGP, similar to that observed in non-RA patients with infections, was noted in RA patients with infections (sensitivity 100%, specificity 100%). The results show that an increase in AGP reactivity with concanavalin A is a sensitive indicator of intercurrent infection in patients with RA.\r"

However, there have been very few reports of SEP findings in patients with spinal cord hemisection. On the basis of clinical correlation, Giblin first postulated that the activity giving rise to the initial cortical components of the SEP travels through the dorsal column-lemniscal system. However, the pathway through which these evoked potentials are transmitted has recently been questioned. This paper examines the results of tibial nerve SEPS performed on four patients with spinal cord hemisection (Brown-Sequard syndrome). In all four cases presented, the impairment of cortical SEP components was consistently associated with stimulation of the leg ipsilateral to the side of cord injury. We conclude that the most likely mechanism of transmission is through the ipsilateral dorsal columnlemniscal system.\r"

These nerve fiber changes were the result of work hypertrophy and overwork atrophy, respectively. This study was designed to reassess morphologic changes in nerves after overwork was induced in rats with acrylamide neuropathy and to test the effects of rest before and after an overwork period in rats with acrylamide neuropathy. The 4-week-old rats divided into four groups of eight rats. Acrylamide was administered to three groups (Groups 2, 3, and 4) to induce subacute paralysis followed by gradual ameriolation. Group 3 was exercised for the first 5 weeks and was rested for the last 5 weeks. Group 4 was exercised for the last 5 weeks. The diameter distribution of myelinated fibers of the tibial and sural nerves was analyzed. The percentage of larger myelinated fibers was decreased in all acrylamide-treated groups. The average values of fiber diameters in Group 4 were significantly smaller than injected sedentary animals (Group 2) or those with rest (Group 3), whereas no significant difference was found between the latter groups. Axonal degeneration of teased fibers was assessed in the tibial and sural nerves. The percentage of axonal degenerated fibers in exercised animals (Group 4) was significantly higher than in the other acrylamide-injected groups (Groups 2 and 3). This study supports the concept that acrylamide neuropathy worsens with moderate intensity of running activities for a prolonged period and that recovery may occur if vigorous exercise is avoided.\r"

The patient is a 42-year-old man with chronic nonhealing of a right ischial pressure ulcer. It had required a flap rotation and partial ischiectomy in the remote past that had been problem-free for many years. The patient subsequently required the placement of a new flap, but insufficient tissue was available to close the wound with the hip in 90 degrees of flexion. Closing the wound with the hip in extension merely led to breakdown when the hip was put in the 90 degrees of flexion required for the sitting position. The problem was solved by using a tissue expander to increase the available soft tissue. A tissue expander was inserted and gradually expanded over a period of weeks by injecting it with fluid. It was then removed, and the expanded tissue that had grown over it allowed closure of the wound without tension on the tissues with the hip in flexion. The patient subsequently returned to the sitting position and his work as a computer programmer. Tissue expanders are commonly used in breast reconstruction, but have found many other uses in plastic surgery over the last decade. It is felt that tissue expansion techniques should not be the primary surgery treatment of decubitus ulcers, but can be used in difficult cases like this one to provide additional tissue.\r"

Vibration at 100 Hz for 15 min on all 28 subjects was associated with a temperature increase of 4.20 +/- 0.79 degrees F that was significantly (P less than 0.01) higher than that in the controls (0.38 +/- 0.33 degrees F). Skin temperature decreased to previbration levels by 50 min of postvibration. The 11 subjects who received 50-Hz vibration for 15 min showed a skin temperature increase (0.75 +/- 0.23 degrees F) in the vibrated forearm significantly (P less than 0.01) higher than that in the control forearm (0.11 +/- 0.17 degrees F). All measurements decreased to previbration skin temperatures by 10-min postvibration. Vibration at 100 Hz also produced skin erythema in all subjects, whereas 50-Hz vibration produced no erythema. The mechanism by which 100-Hz vibration relieves pain is largely unclear, but it could be associated with increased skin temperature and erythema.\r"

One hundred of these patients underwent a maximal exercise test six weeks after infarction to evaluate its ability to predict cardiac events. The in-hospital mortality for the series was 7.6% (14 deaths) and the one year mortality for the 170 survivors was 3.8% (seven deaths). During the exercise test 31 patients had angina and 21 had ST depression. During the one year follow up period 39 of 100 patients had angina on exertion, 15 patients underwent coronary artery surgery, three patients had a reinfarction, and one patient died. Angina during the exercise test but not ST segment depression during the exercise test predicted angina on exertion and the need for coronary artery surgery. In the year of follow up angina occurred during everyday exertion in 25 (81%) (95% confidence interval 62 to 92%) of the 31 patients who developed angina during the exercise test and in only 14 (20%) (95% confidence interval 12 to 32%) of 69 patients who did not, and coronary artery surgery was performed in 11 (35%) (95% confidence interval 19 to 54%) of the 31 patients with angina during the exercise test and only four (6%) (95% confidence interval 2 to 15%) of 69 patients without angina. The outcome after myocardial infarction in patients aged less than 55 years was good and the occurrence of angina, but not ST segment depression, during a maximal exercise test six weeks after infarction was an indication for further investigation.\r"

Patients with recent unstable angina or angina after recent acute myocardial infarction had higher basal cardiac noradrenaline spillover than patients with stable angina. This represents a selective increase in cardiac sympathetic tone because whole body noradrenaline spillover was not significantly increased in the patients with recent unstable angina. Atrial pacing in 15 patients caused angina in 13 but did not significantly alter cardiac noradrenaline spillover in either patients with stable or unstable angina. The flow of plasma in the coronary sinus increased during pacing but because cardiac noradrenaline extraction decreased cardiac noradrenaline clearance was not significantly altered. Both whole body noradrenaline spillover and clearance were modestly increased by pacing, and arterial noradrenaline concentration was unchanged. Patients with recent symptoms of unstable ischaemia had a sustained and selective increase in cardiac efferent sympathetic tone compared with patients with stable angina, and angina induced by atrial pacing did not cause important cardiac sympathetic activation.\r"

Left ventricular pressure was recorded simultaneously by a micromanometer tipped catheter. The ventriculograms were digitised frame by frame to derive continuous plots of left ventricular shape, volume, and rate of change of volume. The time constant (tau) of the fall in left ventricular pressure was determined from the exponential portion of pressure decay during isovolumic relaxation. Ventricular pressure-volume loops were constructed to study the left ventricular diastolic pressure-volume relation. The time of minimum left ventricular pressure was used to divide diastole into an early phase and a late phase. Angina was associated with an increase in end systolic volume and a fall in ejection fraction with no significant change in end diastolic volume. Peak left ventricular pressure was unchanged but left ventricular minimum and end diastolic pressures were both increased and the diastolic pressure-volume relation was moved upwards. The time constant of left ventricular pressure fall was prolonged. At rest more than 50% of the stroke volume entered the left ventricle during the period of early diastole. This proportion was significantly reduced during angina and as a consequence a significantly greater proportion of the stroke volume entered the ventricle during late diastole. Despite this, and although the left ventricular diastolic pressure-volume relation was moved upwards with angina, the mean slope of the relation during late diastole--that is, chamber stiffness--was not significantly altered. The upward shift of the left ventricular diastolic pressure-volume relation seen during angina is thus already apparent in early diastole, and its extent does not change during the later phase of diastole, which alone shows the property of passive stiffness. A primary increase in the passive stiffness of the ventricle cannot therefore be the cause of the upward shift of the diastolic pressure-volume relation, and events occurring in early diastole have to be looked to for an explanation. The study findings show that left ventricular function in early diastole is profoundly disturbed during angina pectoris and it is suggested that loss of elastic recoil and dissipation of this restoring force by asynchronous onset of relaxation and abnormal changes in shape are important factors contributing to this disturbance of function.\r"

Before angioplasty thallium-201 perfusion scintigraphy and technetium-99m gated equilibrium ventriculography in most patients showed that stress testing (exercise and ice water stimulation and isometric handgrip respectively) induced myocardial perfusion defects that were associated with a mean (SD) drop in left ventricular ejection fraction from 64 (6)% to 56 (7)%. After angioplasty there was residual coronary stenosis of less than or equal to 20% of the diameter of the vessel in 78 patients (group 1) and of between 20 and 50% in eight patients (group 2). After the procedure the perfusion defects seen during stress resolved in 86% of group 1 and in 87% of group 2. Despite the apparent improvement in myocardial perfusion left ventricular dysfunction persisted in group 2--that is during stress the left ventricular ejection fraction fell from 65% (6) to 56% (5). In group 1, on the other hand, the improvement in myocardial perfusion was associated with significant improvement in left ventricular function with a normal increase in ejection fraction from 63 (5) at rest to 67 (6) during stress. Radionuclide studies, one to six weeks after angioplasty in 30 group 1 patients showed continuing left ventricular decompensation during stress in nine (30%) of them despite correction of perfusion defects. But reinvestigation three to six months after the procedure showed recovery of left ventricular function with an increase in ejection fraction from 66 (5) at rest to 69 (7) during stress.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Electrophysiological studies were performed in eight patients (four men and four women, mean (SD) age 24 (5) years with paroxysmal attacks of palpitation during or immediately after exercise. Five patients were competitive athletes at college. In two patients spontaneous supraventricular tachycardia during exercise was recorded by ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring and in another it was induced by treadmill exercise testing. Two had dual atrioventricular nodal pathways, three had manifest atrioventricular accessory pathways, and three had concealed atrioventricular pathways. Programmed stimulation induced sustained supraventricular tachycardia in six patients--in two after intravenous injection of atropine sulphate (1 mg) and in four during infusion of isoprenaline (0.01 microgram/kg/min). In one patient, non-sustained atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia was induced during isoprenaline infusion. In the remaining patient, who had dual atrioventricular nodal pathways, tachycardia was not inducible. AH block prevented maintenance of reentry in five patients. In five patients shortening of the effective refractory period of the atrioventricular node with atropine (one patient) and isoprenaline (four patients) caused sustained supraventricular tachycardia. The present study indicates that treatment with atropine and isoprenaline may be an important factor in the initiation of supraventricular tachycardia in patients with exercise related paroxysms of palpitation.\r"

The 12 lead resting electrocardiogram was also evaluated. There were slight electrocardiographic changes with ST segment depression (greater than or equal to - 0.5 mm) in seven patients, flat or low amplitude T waves in seven, and U waves (greater than or equal to + 1.0 mm) in three patients. The QT interval was prolonged in 18 patients. Nine patients had one or more ventricular extrasystoles in 24 hours. Only two patients had more than 200 ventricular extrasystoles in 24 hours. No patient had ventricular tachycardia. A total of nine patients had one or more atrial extrasystoles in 24 hours, but only one patient had more than 200 in 24 hours. One patient had an attack of non-sustained supraventricular tachycardia. No patient had pauses. Dangerous tachycardia was rare in these patients with chronic potassium deficiency caused by Bartter's syndrome. The general pattern of slight electrocardiographic changes may reflect an adaptation of the myocardium to hypokalaemia. Further studies are, however, needed to determine whether these findings are relevant to long term prognosis.\r"

  ".W": "The expression of sinus arrhythmia depends on separation of the systemic and pulmonary venous return to the heart as well as on normal autonomic control mechanisms. Patients with atrial septal defect provide a naturally occurring experiment of communication between the two venous systems. In adults with atrial septal defect sinus arrhythmia is minimal or absent. But children with atrial septal defect retain appreciable sinus arrhythmia, although this is not recognised in published reports. To understand why this is so, continuous electrocardiograms were recorded before and after operation in 10 children (aged 4-16 years, mean 6.3) with atrial septal defects and in 10 normal children (aged 5-7 years, mean 6.1). Mean RR intervals were calculated for periods of one minute, and the standard deviation was used as an index of heart rate variability (that is sinus arrhythmia). Frequency analysis (spectral analysis) was also performed on a continuous beat to beat record of heart rate to describe the frequency components that may reflect autonomic activity. The results confirmed the presence of considerable sinus arrhythmia in children with unoperated atrial septal defect. None the less, the standard deviation of RR intervals in the children with unoperated atrial septal defect was significantly less than that for the normal children, and variation increased after closure of the defect. Power spectral analysis of instantaneous heart rate indicated that the high frequency (0.15-0.45 Hz) vagally mediated component of variability was lower for patients than for controls which may indicate abnormalities of autonomic control of heart rate in these children.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In 125 cases with usual atrial arrangement (situs solitus), ventricular topology showed the right hand pattern. Of the 25 patients with atrial isomerism, 13 had similar right hand topology but 12 (48%) had the left hand pattern. This finding was more common in hearts in the right side of the chest (dextrocardia), but there was no significant correlation between ventricular topology and number of atrioventricular valves or the ventriculoarterial connection. In part because of inferences for disposition of the conducting tissue, knowledge of ventricular topology is important when operation for atrioventricular septal defects is considered. Ventricular topology can be promptly recognised by cross sectional echocardiography.\r"

In one family it was shown that the COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, and COL5A2 genes segregated independently of the phenotype; in the other family the results for COL1A1, COL1A2, and COL5A2 were similar but analysis at the COL3A1 locus was not possible. These data indicate that in these families mitral valve prolapse does not arise from a defect in one of these collagen genes.\r"

In nine children the incremental technique was used to establish a cumulative dose-response curve by train-of-four stimulation. The remaining children received either 30 or 50 micrograms kg-1 of the drug as a single bolus. The median ED50 and ED95 of doxacurium in children were 19 and 32 micrograms kg-1, respectively. No clinically significant change in heart rate or arterial pressure occurred. Following doxacurium 30 micrograms kg-1 and 50 micrograms kg-1, recovery to 25% of control occurred in 25 (SEM 6) and 44 (3) min, respectively. The recovery index (25-75% of control) was 27 (2) min. The duration of action of doxacurium is similar to that of tubocurarine and dimethyl-tubocurarine in children. Compared with adults, children seem to require more doxacurium (microgram kg-1) to achieve a comparable degree of neuromuscular depression, and they recover more rapidly.\r"
