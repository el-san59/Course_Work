There was a low operative mortality (2.4 percent), but a high complication rate with pelvic sepsis in 34 (40.5 percent) and anastomotic dehiscence (either partial or complete) in 40 (47.6 percent). The crude five-year survival rate was 56 percent. Isolated local recurrence occurred in seven patients (9.2 percent) and in a further seven patients it was associated with systemic recurrence. The functional results were satisfactory with 92 percent of assessed patients having three or less bowel actions per day. Subsequent incontinence occurred in 8 of the 60 patients assessed and 5 of these needed proximal diversion. For patients in whom the only alternative is abdominoperineal excision of the rectum, these results confirm that there is no disadvantage in terms of potential cure and that the functional results are acceptable.\r"

The mean age of patients with right colon lesions (71.2 years) was significantly higher than for either patients with left colon lesions (68.2 years) or rectal lesions (65.6 years). Further analysis disclosed that patients with proximal tumors were older than patients with distal tumors primarily because of the later presentation of females with cecal or ascending colon cancers. Comparison of the anatomic distribution of tumors in patient groups above and below the age of 70 revealed that right colon cancers accounted for a greater percentage of colorectal tumors in the older patient group than in the younger patient group. These findings support the roles played by both age and sex in influencing colorectal cancer location. Furthermore, these data provide a plausible explanation for the increasing incidence of proximal colonic lesions.\r"

Their symptoms were soiling (N = 6), incontinence (N = 10), and obstipation (N = 19). Clinical diagnoses were previous anal surgery (N = 16), rectal prolapse--partial, total, intussusception (N = 16), puborectalis syndrome (N = 4), neurologic disorders (N = 3), and others (N = 6). The relationship between the maximum squeeze pressure (MSP) measured with anal manometry and the maximum (voluntary) contraction pattern (MCP) and signs of denervation (DEN) measured with anal EMG were examined. The correlation coefficient between MSP and MCP was 0.55 (P less than .001) and between MSP and DEN 0.13 (NS). A normal MSP always showed a normal MCP, a normal MCP showed an abnormal MSP in 43 percent only. In conclusion, the clinical value of anal EMG seems limited. Assessment of an additional anal EMG seems indicated in incontinent patients with previous anal surgery with a low MSP to estimate muscle function, whenever anal surgery is considered. Anal EMG during straining can easily confirm the clinical diagnosis of puborectalis syndrome.\r"

One hundred ninety-four patients had two or more resections and 56 underwent a third resection.

There was also no difference in the interval between resections for the P and NP groups. The lack of agreement between resections suggests that the categorization of patients into P and NP groups does not facilitate prediction of the nature of recurrent disease. The concept of aggressive perforating and indolent nonperforating Crohn's is not substantiated by this study.\r"

The recurrence rates between these two groups with Dukes' A were 0 percent (0 of 23) vs. 5.2 percent (5 of 96), those with Dukes' B were 6.3 percent (5 of 80) vs. 21.9 percent (14 of 64), Dukes' C were 23.6 percent (20 of 89) vs. 32.8 percent (28 of 85). The differences between the two groups with Dukes' B and C were statistically significant (P less than .05). The cumulative five-year survival rates in the extended excision group were 94 percent with Dukes' A stage, 88 percent with Dukes' B stage, and 61 percent with Dukes' C stage, compared with 91 percent (Dukes' A), 74 percent (Dukes' B), and 43 percent (Dukes' C) in the conventional excision group. There were also statistically significant differences between the two groups with Dukes' B and C stages (P less than .05). Although wide iliopelvic lymphadenectomy was successful as far as decreasing the incidence of local recurrence and also in prolonging survival, there were increased incidences of urine-voiding failure (loss of sense of bladder being full of urine detected in 39.4 percent of the extended excision group vs. 8.8 percent of the conventional excision group) and sexual impotency (76 percent vs. 37.5 percent).\r"

  ".W": "During a 20-year period (1965 to 1985), 4673 patients with rectal cancer underwent surgical treatment, with 3500 of them being subjected to radical surgery. Postoperative mortality was 6.1 percent. During the last five years, the mortality rate decreased dramatically down to 4.9 percent, despite an increase in the group of elderly patients (35.7 percent) and performance of a considerable percentage of simultaneous, extensive, and combined operations (33.7 percent). The trend of employing sphincter-saving operations (in more than 60 percent of patients, the anterior resection and abdominoanal resection with a pull-through were performed) accounts for the favorable five-year survival rate (62 to 69 percent) and results in a good functional outcome in 80 percent of patients. The use of a combination of conservative and operative methods of rehabilitation contributes to the professional readaptation of 75 to 80 percent of patients after surgery with construction of a stoma. In 223 cases, a Soviet magnetic occlusive device was implanted, while in 67 patients an artificial sphincter mechanism was constructed from the flap of the adductor longus femoris muscle. It should be emphasized that surgical methods of rehabilitation are used both in primary and reconstructive operations. The experience with management of 124 patients with recurrent cancer after resection and extirpation of the rectum shows that local excision or repeated resections of the rectum cure 20 to 29 percent of those operated on.\r"

Regional (inguinal) nodal metastasis occurs in 14 percent of patients, heralding a dismal prognosis. Radiation and chemotherapy are of minimal palliative value. Reconstruction of these patients has consisted of split-thickness skin grafts or local cutaneous and myocutaneous flaps. Some authors have allowed healing by secondary intention. A case of squamous-cell carcinoma arising in a chronic pilonidal sinus tract is reported. Local recurrence required an extensive resection resulting in a large sacral/perineal defect. A single-stage reconstruction of this defect with multiple muscle and musculocutaneous flaps is described.\r"

Experimental colitis was produced in rats by rectal instillation of 1 ml of 10 percent acetic acid, and 1.5 ml of a 20 percent suspension of sucralfate was then administered every 12 hours for various lengths of time. Study animals and appropriate controls were killed after 3, 7, 10, or 14 days. The distal colons were studied macroscopically and histologically. Colonic prostaglandin E2 levels were measured in animals killed after 3, 7, 10, or 14 days. The macroscopic score was significantly improved 10 and 14 days after induction of colitis, although the histologic appearance was unchanged. Acetic acid administration increased and sucralfate treatment reduced prostaglandin E2 levels in colitic animals on days 3 and 7, but not later. The present study supports a role for sucralfate in the treatment of colitis, but further studies on the mechanism of its effect and on its clinical activity are indicated.\r"

Nine of the 18 patients demonstrated adenomatous polyps of the papilla, varying in size and appearance from microadenomas in normal-appearing duodenal papillae (two) to a sessile polyp 3 cm in diameter. Two were tubulovillous adenomas (0.5 cm and 2 cm in diameter) and the remainder were tubular adenomas. Severe atypia and malignancy were not encountered. These findings reveal that adenomas of the duodenal papilla are common in individuals with familial adenomatous polyposis. Because of these findings and because of the known risk of periampullary adenocarcinomas and nonmalignant complications of polyps of the duodenal papilla in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, upper gastrointestinal screening of such patients should include examination of the duodenal papilla with a side-viewing endoscope.\r"

Blood samples were obtained from 73 patients undergoing colonoscopy, primarily for evaluation of Hemoccult-positive stools. Fasting plasma gastrin was significantly greater in patients with adenomatous polyps (24.2 +/- 5.7 pM, N = 25) or colon cancer (84.5 +/- 28.5 pM, N = 20) than in controls (9.9 +/- 0.9 pM, N = 28). Elevations were due to gastrin values greater than control mean + 2 SD in nine patients with polyps (19.5-150.2 pM) and eight with cancer (20.7-403.2 pM). None of the patients had identifiable causes (drugs, prior surgery) for elevated gastrin levels.

A substantial senescence-associated decline in the number of lymphoid cells was found in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and spleen (SPN), and especially in the Peyer's patches (PP), but not in the lamina propria (LP). The distribution of lymphocyte subsets in these tissues was also altered with an absolute reduction of T cells--in particular, a L3T4+ helper/inducer T-cell marker-bearing subset. These changes were most remarkable in PP, followed by MLN. The in vitro proliferative reactivity and the production of each isotype-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) by PP, MLN, and SPN were profoundly affected when T-cell-dependent (Td) B-cell mitogens were used, but minimally affected when T-cell-independent (Ti) B-cell mitogens were used. The isotype-specific Ig content of small-intestinal perfusates was also influenced by aging, but only to a minor extent, as exemplified by a decrease in IgA levels in the fasting condition. Thus, despite the defects in the quantity and distribution of lymphocytes in aged PP and MLN, the finding of little change in the total amount of secreted IgA in aged intestine suggests that gut IgA-mediated luminal immune responses could remain nearly unaltered with senescence. The constancy of intraluminal IgA levels could be of physiological significance in host defense at the gut mucosal surface in aged mice.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have emphasized the role of bile acid and fat malabsorption as the cause of the diarrhea that may follow ileal and right colon resection; unabsorbed bile acids and fat are believed to reduce sodium chloride and water absorption in the remaining colon. In this paper we report studies in eight patients with severe postresection diarrhea, in search of a more basic defect in sodium chloride absorption, ie, a loss of sodium chloride absorptive capacity as a direct consequence of resection of sodium chloride absorption sites. First, we determined whether or not diarrhea persisted during a 48-hr fast; in all patients diarrhea and large fecal electrolyte losses continued during a fast. Second, we measured sodium chloride and water absorption rates during total gut perfusion with a balanced electrolyte solution; compared to normal controls, the patients absorbed 23-31% less water, sodium, and chloride. In three patients who could be studied further, the absorptive defect was markedly accentuated when the perfusing solution was such that sodium chloride absorption had to take place against a concentration gradient. These observations indicate that postresection diarrhea patients have a reduced capacity to absorb sodium chloride, particularly when there is a concentration gradient between lumen and plasma. Although all of these patients had malabsorption of radiolabeled taurocholic acid, there was only a modest and statistically insignificant reduction in daily stool weight during treatment with large doses of cholestyramine, suggesting that bile acid malabsorption was not responsible for a major part of their diarrhea.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The stimulus was applied via a probe equipped with bipolar ring electrodes which were attached by suction to the mucosa. The probe was positioned 20 cm above the anus. Cerebral responses were recorded by EEG electrodes. Evoked potentials (EPs) in response to electrical stimulation consisted of a series of successive peaks and troughs in the EEG with good reproducibility within and between subjects. The shape and latencies of the intestinal EPs were comparable to other types of EPs reported before. It is concluded that reproducible EPs can be recorded from the scalp after electrical stimulation of the rectosigmoid. The similarity in appearance of these EPs to those previously reported suggests that visceral afferents were stimulated. The technique may become a useful tool to study visceral nervous connections to the brain in health and disease.\r"

In the basal state, both sodium and chloride were actively absorbed, and there was no significant residual ion flux. Electrical field stimulation of the intrinsic mucosal innervation evoked an increase in short-circuit current that was dependent on stimulus frequency and strength. The response was mimicked by scorpion venom, which is known to depolarize neurons, and was nearly abolished by tetrodotoxin, which prevents neurotransmitter release. Atropine reduced, but did not abolish, the response to neural stimulation. Carbachol, aminophylline, and theophylline significantly increased short-circuit current above basal levels. Electrical field stimulation evoked an increase in short-circuit current that could be accounted for by a decrease in net chloride absorption without any significant effect on sodium absorption or residual ion flux. These results suggest that ion transport in the human left colon is regulated by intrinsic submucosal cholinergic neurons as well as other neuronal types, and activation of these nerves could provide the basis for certain diarrheal disorders.\r"

Each patient received orally at 7:00 PM on two consecutive days 30 mg of sennosides one day (sequence S) and placebo on the other (sequence P) in a random fashion. A significant (P less than 0.05) increase of peristaltic activity (migrating long spike bursts or MLSBs) after sennosides was observed between 1:00 and 7:00 AM, and a corresponding decrease between 7:00 and 9:00 AM. No change was noted in total short spike burst (SSB) activity or in SSBs characteristic of the rectosigmoid area. This study indicates that the main modification of colonic motility induced by sennosides was a stimulation of propulsive activity (MLSBs), which occurred between 6-12 hr after oral administration, the delay required for orocecal transit and metabolism of the drug.\r"

By pretreatment with atropine, rapid contraction of the biphasic response evoked by TS in the greater curvature was abolished and relaxation was augmented. Relaxation to TS of the greater curvature was not affected by prazocine, yohimbine, phentolamine, propranolol, theophylline, apamin, alpha-chymotrypsin, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide receptor antagonist.

Since the portal hypertensive gastric mucosa has extensive microvascular changes, we postulated that the increased sensitivity to mucosal damage could have an ischemic basis. We measured distribution of gastric serosal and mucosal oxygenation in a group of portal hypertensive and sham-operated rats, and then studied the effects of intragastric aspirin. In the basal state, gastric mucosa of portal hypertensive rats had significantly reduced oxygenation compared to controls (24 +/- 5 vs 45 +/- 7 mm Hg PO2, P less than 0.02), while serosal oxygenation was similar between the two groups. Intragastric aspirin produced significantly greater mucosal damage to portal hypertensive rats and mucosal oxygenation was almost one third that of sham-operated controls. Systemic arterial pressures and oxygenation were similar between the two groups. We conclude that there is impairment of gastric mucosal oxygenation and increased mucosal damage by aspirin in portal hypertensive rats compared with sham-operated controls. These results support our hypothesis that the increased sensitivity of the portal hypertensive mucosa to damage is a consequence of impaired mucosal oxygenation.\r"

Endoscopic inspection of gastroduodenal mucosa was performed at entry and again after six days of drug therapy for each medicine. Mean serum salicylate concentrations taken before the morning drug dose were 11.2 mg/dl for enteric-coated aspirin and 18.1 mg/dl for salsalate. Only one of 10 subjects receiving salsalate developed mild (grade 1) mucosal damage while six of 10 receiving enteric-coated aspirin developed moderate to severe damage (grade 2-3) (P = 0.01). Symptoms were mild in both groups. We conclude that salsalate causes less gastroduodenal mucosal damage than enteric-coated aspirin.\r"

Patients were treated for at least eight weeks with standard doses of antisecretory medications and endoscopic healing or nonhealing was documented. Fifty-five patients that had complete healing of their duodenal ulcers had a mean basal acid output of 6.6 +/- 5.3 meq/hr, and 18/55 had daily cigarette smoking histories, whereas 20 patients that had nonhealing duodenal ulcers had a mean basal acid output of 20.0 +/- 9.6 meq/hr, and 8/20 had daily cigarette smoking histories. There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to age, duodenal ulcer size, or cigarette smoking history. However, there were significant differences in male-female ratio (P less than 0.02) and in mean basal acid output (P less than 0.001), and all patients with nonhealing duodenal ulcers had basal acid outputs of greater than 10.0 meq/hr. Patients with nonhealing duodenal ulcers were treated with increased doses of ranitidine, mean 675 mg/day (range 600-1200 mg/day), and all had complete healing endoscopically documented. These results indicate that patients treated with standard doses of antisecretory medications with nonhealing duodenal ulcers have increased basal acid outputs of greater than 10.0 meq/hr, and the duodenal ulcers heal with increased doses of antisecretory medication.\r"

These effects were evident when the agent was given orally, intraperitoneally, or subcutaneously at 3 or 10 mg/kg 0.5 hr before HCl-ethanol administration. Histologically, the surface epithelial and pit cells were not protected by mepirizole, but most of the mucosal cells located in the deeper portions were well preserved. Gastric acid secretion in the pylorus-ligated or acute fistula preparation was not affected by 10 mg/kg of mepirizole. Gastric motility determined by a balloon method was dose-dependently inhibited by the agent. Mepirizole protection was significantly reduced by pretreatment with subcutaneous indomethacin (5 mg/kg) and N-ethylmaleimide (10 mg/kg). The gastric motility inhibited by mepirizole was not reversed by indomethacin and N-ethylmaleimide treatment. These results suggest that the mechanism underlying mepirizole protection relates to both endogenous prostaglandins and sulfhydryl compounds present in the gastric mucosa, but does not relate to an inhibition of gastric motility. Dulcerozine and other basic antiinflammatory drugs (tiaramide, tinoridine, and benzydamine) given either orally or intraperitoneally at 10-100 mg/kg also dose-dependently prevented the development of HCl-ethanol-induced lesions. Mepirizole and other basic antiinflammatory drugs are cytoprotective in the rat stomach.\r"

Some reports evaluating basal gastric acid secretion in nonulcer dyspepsia and duodenal ulcer disease have supported that impression; however, results from different studies have been mixed. In order to compare basal gastric secretory profiles in nonulcer dyspepsia and duodenal ulcer disease, we determined basal acid outputs in 66 consecutive patients with the diagnosis of nonulcer dyspepsia. All patients with nonulcer dyspepsia had at least a three-month history of epigastric abdominal pain, and all had negative upper gastrointestinal endoscopies except for 14 with duodenitis. The 66 patients with nonulcer dyspepsia were compared to 40 asymptomatic normal subjects and 114 patients with endoscopically documented duodenal ulcer disease. There was no significant difference in mean basal acid output among all 66 patients with nonulcer dyspepsia (2.9 +/- 2.7 meq/hr), the group of normal subjects (3.2 +/- 2.7 meq/hr), the 14 patients with nonulcer dyspepsia with duodenitis (3.0 +/- 2.1 meq/hr), and the 52 patients with nonulcer dyspepsia without duodenitis (2.9 +/- 2.9 meq/hr). However, mean basal acid output of the patients with duodenal ulcer disease (9.1 +/- 7.6 meq/hr) was significantly higher than all the other groups (P less than 0.001). The gastric acid secretory profiles determined in this study do not appear to support the view that nonulcer dyspepsia with or without duodenitis and duodenal ulcer disease are a spectrum of the same acid-peptide process.\r"

We studied basal and pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion and gastric emptying of a radiolabeled caloric liquid meal in 99 consecutive male patients with endoscopically proven, active, uncomplicated duodenal ulcers. Compared to matched healthy subjects, ulcer patients presented increased basal and stimulated acid secretion (P less than 0.001). Sixty-nine patients had peak acid output values above the 95% confidence limits of the control population (14.2-30.6 meq/hr). Cigarette smoking was correlated with gastric acid hypersecretion. No significant difference was found between duodenal ulcer patients and controls in mean gastric emptying times. Ulcer patients showed a greater variance of gastric acid secretion and emptying values than healthy subjects. This reflects varied gastrointestinal function among ulcer patients. No significant correlation was found between gastric acid output and gastric emptying times. These findings suggest that gastric acid hypersecretion, but not accelerated gastric emptying of liquids, play a relevant role in the pathogenesis of duodenal ulcer.\r"

  ".W": "Our aim was to determine the mechanism whereby the jejunoileum regulates postprandial gastroduodenal motility. Five dogs were prepared with a proximal jejunal infusion catheter and with gastric manometry catheters and serosal intestinal electrodes for recording gastric and intestinal motility. After two weeks, fasted dogs were studied during jejunal infusion of either isosmolar NaCl (154 mM) or isosmolar mixed nutrient solution (50% Meritene) on four separate days each. After completion of these baseline studies, the dogs underwent a model of autotransplantation of the entire jejunoileum (extrinsic denervation, disruption of intrinsic neural continuity with proximal duodenum). Two weeks later, identical studies as before were repeated with the now \"autotransplanted\" jejunoileum. Before transplantation, infusion of NaCl did not interrupt the characteristic interdigestive migrating motor complex either in the gastroduodenum or in the jejunoileum. However, infusion of nutrients interrupted the migrating motor complex both in the gastroduodenum and jejunoileum for the duration of the infusion (5 hr). After autotransplantation of the jejunoileum, the migrating motor complex continued to occur in the gastroduodenum and in the jejunoileum during infusion of NaCl, but the migrating motor complex cycled independently in each region without any temporal coordination. Jejunal infusion of nutrients interrupted the MMC in both regions for the duration of infusion (5 hr). Because inhibition of the gastroduodenal and jejunoileal migrating motor complex continued to occur during infusion of nutrients into the transplanted jejunum, we concluded that jejunoileal regulation of postprandial inhibition of interdigestive motility in the stomach and duodenum is mediated by hormonal factors and does not require intrinsic neural continuity.\r"

Findings in the surgical specimen and upon autopsy were consistent with isolated Crohn's disease of the distal esophagus as well as with intramucosal adenocarcinoma. Analysis of the data available in the literature reveals that Crohn's disease of the esophagus, although rare, clearly possesses some definite characteristics of its own. It is suggested that the presence of these three features in a single patient constitutes no more than a chance coexistence.\r"

  ".W": "A case of Barrett's esophagus of the specialized columnar type is described in which mucosal ornithine decarboxylase levels were measured in endoscopic biopsies at two intervals over which severe dysplasia had developed. The Barrett's mucosa extended 5 cm above the gastroesophageal junction, was free of dysplasia, and had no detectable ornithine decarboxylase activity at initial evaluation. On follow-up endoscopy one year later, the Barrett's mucosa had become dysplastic with a markedly elevated ornithine decarboxylase activity of 1.56 units/mg protein. The patient underwent an esophagectomy because of persistent severe dysplasia and continues to do well postoperatively. Elevated ornithine decarboxylase activity has been described in other premalignant conditions, especially when dysplasia has been present. Further studies in Barrett's esophagus are warranted, since ODC activity might prove to be a useful biochemical marker for dysplasia and increased cancer risk.\r"

  ".W": "Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), a hydroxyl radical scavenger, is known as an immunosuppressive agent and can reduce autoantibody levels in experimental autoimmune diseases. Because classic diabetogens damage the DNA and membrane of the beta-cell by the generation of free radicals, the purpose of these investigations was to determine whether the intake of DMSO or its derivatives methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) and dimethylsulfide (DMS) could prevent the expression of autoimmune diabetes in the spontaneously diabetic NOD mouse. DMSO (2.5%), MSM (2.5%), and DMS (0.25%) were added to the drinking water of female NOD mice immediately after weaning. Control animals were maintained on regular drinking water. The presence of overt diabetes was monitored from the age of 2 mo by weekly urinary glucose testing until the animals either became overtly glucosuric or were greater than 240 days of age. In contrast to what we expected, DMSO (2.5%) markedly increased the rate at which the animals expressed overt diabetes (P less than .0004, log-rank test). MSM had no effect, whereas DMS reduced the incidence and rate of diabetes onset. When DMSO (2.5%) was administered to male NOD mice and control strains of mice (BALB/c and ICR), the control group did not develop glucosuria or insipidus, whereas DMSO increased the incidence of diabetes in the male NOD mice from 21 to 79%. In contrast, when DMSO was fed to female NOD mice on a purified AIN-76 diet, diabetes onset was reduced to 36%. We conclude that DMSO accelerates the uptake of dietary diabetogens into the beta-cell of genetically susceptible animals (NOD mice). The protective effect of the purified diet in such animals may be due to a lack of putative diabetogens in purified diet, or alternatively, the diet itself contains factor(s) that protect the beta-cell from autoimmune attack and/or destruction.\r"

  ".W": "Cholesterol synthesis is increased two- to threefold in the small intestine of diabetic rats. We have observed, in three separate experiments, that the characteristic increase in small intestinal cholesterol synthesis (SICS) in diabetic rats was prevented by total gastrectomy. Food intake was increased twofold, and the small intestine hypertrophied in the gastrectomized diabetic animals. In normal animals, total gastrectomy resulted in only a very small increase in intestinal cholesterol synthesis. In hyperphagic lactating animals, total gastrectomy did not prevent the characteristic increase in SICS that is usually observed in this hyperphagic model. These results indicate that the effects of total gastrectomy on preventing an increase in SICS are relatively specific for the diabetic state. The mechanism by which total gastrectomy prevents the increase in intestinal cholesterol synthesis in diabetic animals is unknown. Vagotomy did not prevent the typical increase in intestinal synthesis in diabetic animals. Additionally, selectively removing either the antrum or fundus of the stomach did not prevent the increase in SICS in diabetic animals, indicating that the inhibition requires the removal of the entire stomach. It can be speculated that the stomach produces a substance that induces the increase in SICS observed in diabetic animals and that total gastrectomy removes this stimulatory substance.\r"

In such rats the values of motor nerve conduction velocity and sensory nerve conduction velocity were decreased compared with the values obtained in nondiabetic controls from 3 wk after STZ injection onward. In recent years it has been extensively documented that peptides related to ACTH and MSH exert a neurotrophic effect on the nervous system that results in enhanced recovery of function after mechanical nerve damage. This article documents the beneficial effect of the peptide Org 2766, an ACTH-(4-9) analogue, in diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Chronic subcutaneous treatment of diabetic rats with Org 2766 results in a significant enhancement of both motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity compared with saline-treated diabetic rats. Histological analysis of cross sections of the sural nerve showed no difference in the total number of nerve fibers in saline- or peptide-treated diabetic rats. In contrast, a difference in fiber size distribution was demonstrated; i.e., the sural nerves of diabetic rats contained fewer thick myelinated fibers. Treatment with Org 2766 resulted in a normal distribution. Apparently, the peptide Org 2766 has a protective action on nerve fibers and nerve function during STZ-induced diabetes.\r"

  ".U": "89121209\r", 
  ".W": "Streptozocin-induced diabetes (STZ-D) was produced in male Wistar rats at two stages of development: young, lean rats, weighing 150-220 g (6-8 wk), and older, moderately obese rats, weighing 450-500 g (6-8 mo). A comparable degree of hyperglycemia (420-500 mg/dl) without ketosis was generated by injection of 50 mg/kg i.v. STZ for young, lean rats and 30 mg/kg i.v. for older, fatter rats. The animals were killed 8-11 days after injection. Insulin binding by the isolated adipocytes of both groups was not significantly altered on a per-cell basis by the presence of diabetes. Total adipocyte glucose metabolism, both basal and insulin stimulated, was reduced (63 and 88%, respectively) by the induction of diabetes in young, lean rats. In contrast, the induction of diabetes in the older, moderately obese rats had no suppressive effect on total glucose metabolism by their fat cells. Diabetes increased the relative conversion of glucose to lactate by fat cells from both groups of rats, but in absolute terms, the fat cells from the obese diabetic rats produced significantly more lactate from glucose than cells from the lean diabetic rats, both in the absence and presence of insulin. Diabetes did not alter the glucose concentration at which peak insulin response occurred in either group. We conclude that STZ-D in rats, at different stages of development and degrees of adiposity, results in quantitatively different alterations of adipocyte metabolism, which appear to be postreceptor in nature and result in an increase in glucose conversion to lactate.\r"

The rat MHC (RT1 complex) encodes two class II loci, RT1.B and RT1.D. The possibility that variant or unique class II MHC molecules may be associated with IDDM susceptibility was directly examined by determining the nucleotide sequences of class II mRNAs and/or cDNAs from the diabetes-prone (DP) BB rat, the diabetes-resistant (DR) BB rat, the normal histocompatible Wistar-Furth (WF) rat, and the Lewis rat. Sequence analysis indicates that the beta-chains of the RT1.B and RT1.D molecules of the u haplotype from DP-BB, DR-BB, and WF rats are identical but that they are different from other rat alleles and published mouse class II sequences. At the nucleotide level, the NH2-terminal domain of RT1.D beta of the BB and WF rats differs by a single silent nucleotide substitution. Comparisons with the sequences of the Lewis rat indicate hypervariable allelic differences and that the u and I haplotypes are remarkably similar. These findings establish that the class II molecules of the DP-BB rat are not variant or unique and that unaltered class II molecules of the u haplotype support the autoimmune response in the BB rat.\r"

We quantitatively assessed the sensitivity of the esophageal mucosa to pain associated with the intraesophageal infusion of eight different HCl solutions (pH 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, and 6). Test solutions were infused at 8 ml/min through an eight-lumen catheter with the orifices placed 5 cm above the lower esophageal sphincter. Each subject received all eight solutions in a double-blind randomized fashion. The time-to-pain onset increased with increasing pH; i.e., there was a highly significant difference between the time-to-pain and pH (p less than 0.001), with the time-to-pain significantly longer with increasing pH (r = 0.77). In addition to more rapid onset of pain, all subjects experienced pain with the pH 1 and 1.5 solutions, 80% had pain with the pH 2.0 solution, and half had pain with solutions of pH 2.5-6. Fifteen of these subjects underwent 24-h pH monitoring and these tests were examined for factors associated with pain. Only 64% of all pain episodes were associated with a pH drop of less than 4; the lowest pH obtained was not different between episodes with and without pain. Reflux episodes resulting in pain were significantly longer than those without pain and were more often associated with a recently preceding painful episode. Overall, none of the data from the 24-h pH monitoring was useful for predicting pain. The acid infusion studies and the 24-h pH data, taken together, suggest episodes of pain sensitize the patient for subsequent pain.\r"

Chromatographic analysis of human duodenal mucosa extracts and of human serum, using motilin-specific antibodies, also shows the presence of multiple forms of motilinlike immunoreactivity. Cell free translation of human duodenal messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and immunoprecipitation of nascent peptides with motilin antibodies confirm that motilin is synthesized as a 14-15-kilodalton polypeptide precursor. Sequence of the human intestinal motilin complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) demonstrates that this precursor bears a 25-amino acid signal peptide, a single dibasic cleavage site immediately following the 22 amino acids of human motilin, and a 65-amino acid polypeptide (motilin-related peptide) following this dibasic processing site. Southern analysis of human genomic kilobases DNA demonstrates that only one motilin gene is contained within 3.5-4 of human genomic DNA. Northern analysis of human intestinal RNA reveals one species of motilin mRNA of an estimated 700 nucleotides in length. These results suggest that (a) only one gene encodes the synthesis of human motilin in the different tissues where this polypeptide is synthesized; (b) human intestinal motilin is translated from one mRNA species and the resulting precursor is processed within the duodenal mucosa by sequential proteolytic cleavage first at a site within the motilin-related peptide, which results in the liberation of a 6-kilodalton form of motilinlike immunoreactivity, and then at the dibasic amino acid cleavage site, thus freeing motilin 22 from its precursor.\r"

Commercially available antacids were acidified with 6 N HCl. Peak mucosal protective activity occurred at pH 2.5, and declined at lower pH. At pH 2.5, the antacid suspensions became solubilized and no acid-neutralizing capacity remained. This solution was named activated aluminum complex. Based on aluminum ion content, each aluminum-containing antacid suspension tested demonstrated a comparable increase in potency on acidification against ethanol-induced lesions. HCl (pH 2.5) was inactive against ethanol-induced lesions. At cytoprotective doses, activated aluminum complex did not cause gastric lesions when orally administered by itself, demonstrating that it is not acting as a local mucosal irritant. The data suggest that solubilization of aluminum-containing antacids in acidic medium enhances their mucosal protective activity, probably by releasing an activated species of aluminum ion reported to be a hexaaquoaluminum cation.\r"

Transepithelial electrical resistance values after confluence were 173.5 omega.cm2 and remained unchanged through day 17. Permeabilities to the water-soluble fluid-phase markers that do not permeate the membrane, Lucifer yellow CH, [14C]inulin, [14C]polyethylene glycol, and [3H] dextran were less than 0.25% of the administered amount per hour after day 10. Qualitative evaluation of uptake and permeability to horseradish peroxidase confirmed the similarity in uptake and barrier properties between this cell system and the small intestinal epithelial layer. We conclude that Caco-2 cells grown on collagen-coated polycarbonate membranes should represent a valuable transport model system for the small intestinal epithelium.\r"

  ".W": "Biopsy specimens taken during exploratory laparotomy provided the material for a pathological study of 23 cases of nonsecreting immunoproliferative small intestinal disease (Mediterranean lymphomas without alpha-chain disease). The distinctive pathological feature of immunoproliferative small intestinal disease, i.e., a diffuse lymphoid infiltration, was present in the mucosa and submucosa of all or a major part of the small intestine. It was composed of a low- or intermediate-grade malignant lymphoid proliferation associated in 19 of 23 cases with benign-appearing follicular lymphoid structures. These follicular figures were surrounded and partially destroyed by the lymphoma cells. This association strongly resembles the newly described non-Hodgkin's lymphoma entities of perifollicular or parafollicular cell origin. Gross tumors of the small intestine were found in association with the diffuse lymphoid infiltration in 10 cases. They often constituted foci of lymphoma with a higher grade of malignancy. Mesenteric lymph node involvement was frequent and generally in direct ratio to the severity of intestinal involvement. A comprehensive study of the lesions observed in these cases led to the hypothesis that nonsecreting immunoproliferative small intestinal disease could result from the malignant change of perifollicular B cells; during an initial period the tumoral cells retain circulating and homing properties that explain their infiltrative and extensive method of spreading. The possible subsequent emergence of more aggressive subclones of noncirculating malignant cells could then explain the associated inconstant fungating tumor foci. Further studies using more sophisticated immunohistochemical techniques are necessary to establish the meaning of the hyperplastic lymphoid follicles, the possible etiologic role of benign nodular hyperplasia, the exact identification of the tumor cells, and the relationship of nonsecreting immunoproliferative small intestinal disease to closely related alpha-chain disease.\r"

In contrast, control sera had a mean IgG2 level of 2477 micrograms/ml and ulcerative colitis sera had a similar IgG2 level of 2269 micrograms/ml, whereas Crohn's disease sera had a significantly increased mean IgG2 level of 5111 micrograms/ml (p less than 0.05).

Neither ulcerative colitis nor Crohn's disease sera exhibited altered levels of IgG3 or IgG4.

The primary concern of gastroenterologists is the resolution and color performance of these instruments, as these parameters have important bearings on the ability to discern pathological changes in mucosa. We sought to determine the resolution and color capabilities of electronic colonoscopes and compare them with a conventional fiber colonoscope. Resolution was determined using a standard test chart at various distances and the number of picture elements (a measure of resolution) was calculated. The mean number of picture elements was Fujinon (219), Fiber (172), Pentax (169), Toshiba (142), Olympus (140), and Welch Allyn (133). In close focus examination (target distances less than 1 cm), the Fujinon and Toshiba endoscopes had significantly higher resolution than the other instruments. Color was measured quantitatively using a standard color chart and a color analyzer. Color polygons were plotted for each endoscope on a reference chromaticity diagram. All systems had an acceptable overall performance but color was undersaturated with some systems. The optical performance of electronic endoscopes has improved considerably since the inception of electronic endoscopy.\r"

We have studied prospectively the progression of clinical, biochemical, cholangiographic, and hepatic histologic features in 45 patients with both primary sclerosing cholangitis and chronic ulcerative colitis to compare these variables in the 20 patients who had undergone proctocolectomy with the 25 who had not. The two groups were similar initially with regard to clinical, biochemical, cholangiographic, and hepatic histologic findings. All patients were followed for a minimum of 1 yr and overall duration of follow-up was similar in both groups (4.1 vs. 3.9 yr). Clinically, new onset of hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, esophageal varices, and ascites did not differ in patients with and without proctocolectomy. Biochemically, the serial changes in bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, prothrombin time, and albumin were similar. Histologic progression on liver biopsy did not differ between groups, nor did changes on serial cholangiograms. Proctocolectomy also had no effect on survival. We conclude that proctocolectomy for chronic ulcerative colitis has no beneficial effect on the primary sclerosing cholangitis in patients with both diseases.\r"

Administration of the hapten 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (5-30 mg) in 0.25 ml of 50% ethanol as the \"barrier breaker\" produced dose-dependent colonic ulceration and inflammation. At a dose of 30 mg, trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid/ethanol-induced ulceration and marked thickening of the bowel wall persisted for at least 8 wk. Histologically, the inflammatory response included mucosal and submucosal infiltration by polymorphonuclear leukocytes, macrophages, lymphocytes, connective tissue mast cells, and fibroblasts. Granulomas were observed in 57% of the rats killed 3 wk after induction of inflammation. Langhan's-type giant cells were also observed. Segmental ulceration and inflammation were common. The characteristics and relatively long duration of inflammation and ulceration induced in this model afford an opportunity to study the pathophysiology of colonic inflammatory disease in a specifically controlled fashion, and to evaluate new treatments potentially applicable to inflammatory bowel disease in humans.\r"

In addition, the antiinflammatory drug dapsone was tested. The distal 10 cm of rat ileum was perfused with formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) (10(-5) M), a bacterial peptide that activates and attracts neutrophils. Changes in mucosal permeability were assessed using the blood-to-lumen clearance of 51Cr-ethylene-diamineacetate. Luminal FMLP increased 51Cr-labeled ethylenediamineacetate clearance twofold and fourfold in the first and second hour, respectively. Addition of 5-ASA (10 mM), 4-ASA (10 mM), or dapsone (4 mM) to the luminal perfusate after 60 min of FMLP perfusion greatly attenuated the increased mucosal permeability observed after 120 min of FMLP perfusion. Neither N-acetyl-5-ASA (10 mM) nor sulfapyridine (5 mM) had an effect on the FMLP-induced increase in mucosal permeability. We characterized the inhibitory effect of these drugs on the catalytic activity of myeloperoxidase and tested their ability to scavenge hypochlorous acid in vitro. 5-Aminosalicylic acid, 4-ASA, and dapsone demonstrated a powerful inhibitory effect on the catalytic activity of myeloperoxidase, whereas all drugs were equally effective in scavenging HOCl. In additional in vitro experiments we were unable to demonstrate an inhibitory effect of either of the drugs on the catalytic activity of neutrophilic elastase. Our results indicate that inhibition of neutrophilic myeloperoxidase may be an important mechanism by which 5-ASA, 4-ASA, and dapsone attenuate FMLP-induced mucosal injury.\r"

Pouch effluent, compared with ileostomy effluent, had a greater ratio of anaerobes to aerobes (p less than 0.05), and greater numbers of Bacteroides (p less than 0.01) and Bifidobacteria (p less than 0.05). Fecal volatile fatty acids, products of anaerobic bacterial fermentation, were also increased in pouch effluent compared with ileostomy effluent (propionate, p less than 0.05; butyrate, p less than 0.01). Mucosal change in the pouches showed no significant correlation with frequency of defecation, completeness of emptying, or pouch design, but the degree of villous atrophy was correlated with the number of Bacteroides (rs = 0.93, p less than 0.01) and with fecal butyrate (rs = 0.68, p less than 0.05). Fecal propionate was significantly correlated with the percentage of stool retained after defecation (rs = 0.82, p less than 0.01).

Microscopic examination of the tissues revealed zones of thermal damage extending 0.5-1.0 mm from ablation sites. In addition, ablation rates were measured using a mass loss technique and found to increase linearly with delivered radiant exposure. The threshold radiant exposure for ablation was calculated to be 50 J/cm2 with a heat of ablation of 7000 J/cm3. Because the holmium laser produces less thermal necrosis than current endoscopic laser systems, such as the continuous-wave neodymium:YAG laser, and because the ablation rate can be precisely controlled, the holmium laser shows promise as an alternative method for endoscopic removal of tissue.\r"

  ".W": "Intrapancreatic activation of proteases is believed to play a major role in the pathogenesis of acute necrotizing pancreatitis. Several authors have questioned, however, the central role of trypsin in autodigestion of the pancreas. To clarify the direct effects of pancreatic enzymes and other related factors on acinar cells, we used the model of isolated pancreatic acini. Acini were prepared from male Wistar rats by collagenase digestion. Protein synthesis was measured by incubation of acini with [35S]methionine. Acini were resuspended thereafter in fresh buffer and further incubated for 30-90 min under various conditions [e.g., with pancreatic homogenates, ascites (from rats with pancreatitis induced by sodium taurocholate), pure pancreatic enzymes, and other factors]. The percentage of release of newly synthesized proteins into the culture medium was regarded as a biochemical parameter of cellular integrity. A morphologic score of cellular integrity was obtained via light microscopic evaluation of acini at the end of the various incubations by measuring the degree of cell lysis, loss of cell granules, ballooning, formation of vacuoles, and karyopyknosis. When normal [35S]methionine-labeled pancreatic acini were incubated with various factors, the percentage of release of labeled proteins into the medium was as follows: incubation with HEPES/Ringer's buffer, 1.8%; hemorrhagic pancreatic ascites, 3.8%; pancreatic homogenates, 2.0%; lipase, 1.8%; phospholipase A2, 3.0%; phospholipase A2 + lecithin, 3.2%; trypsin, 2.5%; 5% olive oil, 1.8%; ascites + olive oil, 78.3%; ascites + homogenized epididymal fat, 79.9%; lipase + olive oil, 32.0%; pancreatic homogenates + olive oil, 28.0%; diolein, 2.65%; and oleic acid, 62.9%. The cellular release of radiolabeled proteins showed an inverse correlation with cellular integrity as shown by light microscopy. We postulate that interstitial release of degradation products from triglycerides by lipase causes cellular disruption. Whereas phospholipase A2 and proteases do not seem to be very harmful in the early phases of cellular damage, lipase may play a major role in acute necrotizing pancreatitis.\r"

It is generally accepted that patients with maldigestion excrete an excessive amount of triglyceride and patients with malabsorption excrete an excess of the lipolytic product of triglyceride, fatty acid. The two-step Sudan stain has been used as a simple test to differentiate these disorders. The validity of the test has not yet been established. In this study, fecal fatty acid and triglyceride were measured after extraction and thin-layer chromatographic separation. Our results indicate that in adult patients with pancreatic insufficiency, the fecal triglyceride content does not differ from the controls. However, a fivefold to sixfold increase in fecal fatty acid content in patients with pancreatic insufficiency was revealed. As patients with maldigestion do not excrete an excess of undigested triglyceride, it is not possible to differentiate maldigestion from malabsorption by quantifying fecal triglyceride and fatty acid.\r"

Gallbladder emptying was significantly delayed and less complete in both groups of patients before shock-wave treatment (with bile salts: residual volume, 51% +/- 10% and half-ejection time, 40 +/- 5 min; without bile salts: residual volume, 46% +/- 7%; half-ejection time, 30 +/- 4 min) compared with healthy controls (residual volume, 15% +/- 4%; half-ejection time, 18 +/- 2 min). Gallbladder motility was not altered in either group 1 day and 1 yr after lithotripsy. The findings indicate (a) that extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy has no immediate or long-term adverse effects on gallbladder motility and (b) that the defect of gallbladder motility associated with gallstone disease is not abolished by removal of the stone.\r"

Some constitutive forms of hepatic cytochrome P450 are sex-dependent and we have previously demonstrated demasculinization of cytochrome P450 isozyme distribution in a rat model of cirrhosis. As liver regeneration is an integral component of cirrhosis, the present study was performed to ascertain the effects of regeneration on hepatic cytochrome P450 isozyme composition and serum sex steroid concentrations. Adult male rats were subjected to 65% partial hepatectomy or sham-operation. The position-specific hydroxylation of androstenedione was used as a probe for isozyme activity. Serum sex steroids, hepatic enzymes, and hepatic deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis were measured in groups of animals at 0, 6, 24, 48, and 72 h. By 72 h total microsomal cytochrome P450 in partially hepatectomized animals had fallen to 66% of that in nonoperated animals. In both partially hepatectomized and sham-operated animals, androstenedione 7 alpha- and 16 beta-hydroxylase activity returned to preoperative levels by 48 h. However, the male-specific androstenedione 16 alpha- and 6 beta-hydroxylase activities and aromatase activity remained suppressed in partially hepatectomized liver. Serum estradiol increased eightfold in partially hepatectomized rats and peaked at 6 h followed by a gradual fall to control values. No change in serum estradiol was observed in sham-operated animals. We conclude that demasculinization of hepatic oxidative metabolism occurs in regenerating rat liver. The early rise in serum estradiol is consistent with a role for this hormone in the changes in cytochrome P450 observed, and possibly the process of liver regeneration.\r"

  ".W": "Saturation with calcium carbonate was measured in human pancreatic juice anaerobically collected for diagnostic purposes in 15 patients who were ultimately found not to have pancreatic disease. Bicarbonate, PCO2, proteins, and total and ionized calcium were measured in samples collected every minute during a 20-min period after intravenous administration of secretin (1 U/kg) and, 10 min later, caerulein (75 ng/kg). All samples were supersaturated with calcium carbonate. The first sample (washing-out sample) contained the highest concentrations of ionized calcium (Ca2+) and proteins but was least supersaturated with calcium carbonate. Washing-out samples also differed significantly from samples under caerulein by having a lower pH (7.52 +/- 0.30) and higher PCO2 (103.1 +/- 32.20 mmHg) versus 8.22 +/- 0.15 and 38.4 +/- 4.5 mmHg, respectively. Values of PCO2 increased and bicarbonate concentration decreased linearly with protein concentration in washing-out samples but not under hormonal stimulation. This suggests that a concentration of pancreatic juice occurs in pancreatic ducts in association with luminal H+ secretion and CO2 formation, which results from bicarbonate neutralization. During stimulation, ionized calcium concentration increased with protein concentration without any change of PCO2, so that supersaturation was more pronounced under caerulein than under secretin stimulation. Disturbances of the ductal concentration of pancreatic juice during interdigestive periods could be important for pancreatic stone formation in humans.\r"

To determine its presence in a model of ischemic hepatic failure, rats were subjected to a portacaval anastomosis followed by hepatic artery ligation. Brain water was measured using the sensitive gravimetric method. Preliminary studies revealed marked hypothermia in devascularized animals kept at room temperature (26.9 degrees +/- 2.8 degrees C). An additional group of devascularized rats was kept in an incubator. As expected for hypothermia, such animals had a lower arterial pressure and heart rate; the duration of encephalopathy was markedly prolonged. Water content of the cortical gray matter was only increased in normothermic devascularized rats: 80.14% +/- 0.31%, normal; 80.06% +/- 0.22%, portacaval shunt only; 80.42% +/- 0.26%, devascularized at room temperature; 81.29% +/- 0.38%, devascularized at controlled temperature (p less than 0.001). Such differences could not be detected using the dry-weight technique in whole cerebral hemispheres. Astrocyte changes in the cortical gray matter were noted in both edematous and nonedematous devascularized groups, coupled with the presence of vesicles containing horseradish peroxidase in the endothelial capillary cell. This suggests that in this model, brain edema may be due to both a cytotoxic mechanism and changes in the permeability of the blood-brain barrier. Future studies with this widely used model will require strict control of temperature to allow interpretation of experimental results. A therapeutic role for hypothermia in the management of brain edema deserves further attention.\r"

Mononuclear cells from jaundiced patients, tested immediately after isolation, expressed low levels of procoagulant activity, which were, however, significantly higher than in cells from controls (p less than 0.01). In addition, after incubation in short-term cultures with and without endotoxin, these cells generated more procoagulant activity than did the control ones (p less than 0.001). No significant difference in procoagulant activity was found between patients with and without malignancy in either group. The relief of biliary obstruction resulted in the reduction of both serum bilirubin levels and monocyte procoagulant activity. Endotoxin-induced monocyte procoagulant activity was about threefold higher in the jaundiced patients who died than in the survivors (p less than 0.001). In rabbits made icteric by bile duct ligation and separation (15 days), the endotoxin-induced monocyte procoagulant activity was markedly increased as compared with sham-operated animals (p less than 0.005). In all instances, procoagulant activity was identified as tissue factor.

In the control group, 64 (63%) subjects had a common channel and 38 (37%) had separated openings for the common bile duct and the main pancreatic duct. By contrast, the prevalence rate of a common channel was significantly lower in gallstone disease [28 (30%); p less than 0.001]. No such difference, compared with controls, was observed in patients with carcinoma of the gallbladder. The length of the common channel in the control group (mean +/- SD, 4.7 +/- 2.5 mm) was similar to that in gallstone disease (4.6 +/- 2.6 mm). However, patients with carcinoma of the gallbladder had a significantly longer common channel (8.3 +/- 4 mm; p less than 0.001) compared with the control group.

Atropine significantly (p less than 0.05) depressed the protein output in the basal state and in response to secretin at each stage of innervation. The incremental protein response to caerulein was not altered by the various denervation operations nor by atropine. Truncal vagotomy alone significantly decreased the incremental protein response to low (0.12, 0.37, and 1.1 mmol/h) but not high loads of tryptophan. Ganglionectomy in combination with vagotomy did not further depress the incremental protein response to low loads of tryptophan. Atropine significantly reduced the incremental protein response to low loads of tryptophan only in intact innervated animals. Ganglionectomy alone did not alter the incremental protein response to any load of tryptophan. Ganglionectomy, truncal vagotomy, and atropine did not alter basal or tryptophan-stimulated levels of plasma cholecystokininlike immunoreactivity. We conclude that (a) neither the extrinsic nor the intrinsic cholinergic pancreatic nerves modulate the protein response to caerulein; (b) the sympathetic pancreatic nerves do not mediate the response to tryptophan; (c) the protein response to intraduodenal tryptophan is at least in part mediated by long, cholinergic, enteropancreatic reflexes with both afferent and efferent fibers running within the vagus nerves; and (d) release of cholecystokinin by intestinal tryptophan is not under cholinergic or splanchnic control.\r"

Vessels were excised 7 weeks after subcutaneous implantation of the steroid and subsequent elevation in mean arterial pressure from 102 to 133 mm Hg. The carotid media was 1.8 times thicker in arteries from hypertensive animals than in arteries from control animals. This enlargement was associated with an increase in muscle mass, as the fraction of the media composed of smooth muscle cells remained unchanged. Maximal active stress induced by several agonists normalized for cell cross-sectional area was unaltered. No change was observed in sensitivity or maximal response to norepinephrine, histamine, or KCl depolarization. Isotonic shortening rates were also comparable, as was the time course of shortening velocity to a constant afterload during tonic contractions. It is concluded that an enlargement of the carotid media develops in this model of hypertension. However, this response is not associated with detectable alterations in contractile system function.\r"

The effect of sinoaortic denervation on basal and osmotic-induced release of oxytocin and vasopressin and on blood pressure was determined. Hypertonic or isotonic saline was infused intravenously into sham-operated or denervated rats 3 days after surgery. Plasma oxytocin and vasopressin were measured at 5 and 15 minutes after the infusion. The control levels of oxytocin were increased in the denervated rats, but vasopressin levels were not significantly altered. The vasopressin and oxytocin responses to hypertonic saline were greater after baroreceptor denervation. Plasma oxytocin was increased from 4.7 +/- 0.9 to 72.2 +/- 8.7 pg/ml in the denervated rats and from 1.8 +/- 0.3 to 39.9 +/- 6.7 pg/ml in the sham-operated control group at 5 minutes after the infusion (p less than 0.01). The plasma vasopressin response to hypertonic saline was 7.1 +/- 0.6 pg/ml in the sham-operated versus 11.1 +/- 1.6 pg/ml in the denervated rats (p less than 0.05). There was no difference between sham-operated and denervated rats in the effect of hypertonic saline on plasma sodium and hematocrit. Mean arterial blood pressure was increased after sinoaortic denervation (116.3 +/- 4.2 mm Hg in the sham-operated vs. 138.2 +/- 8.3 mm Hg in the denervated rats, p less than 0.05); however, there was no difference in the pressor response to hypertonic saline. These results show that the baroreceptor system influences the secretion of both oxytocin and vasopressin, with effects on basal secretion as well as the response to an osmotic stimulus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The influence of chronic treatment with the angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril on blood pressure, kidney function, and survival was examined in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). Male SHRSP that were fed a Japanese rat chow plus a 1% NaCl drinking solution beginning at 7-8 weeks of age developed severe hypertension and stroke; 14 of 18 untreated control SHRSP died by 14 weeks of age and exhibited evidence of cerebrovascular lesions. When enalapril (15 mg/kg/day) was included in the drinking solution of 15 SHRSP, blood pressure was initially reduced by only a slight degree, whereas survival improved markedly; only one of 10 SHRSP died before the rest were killed at 18 to 21 weeks. The remaining five enalapril-treated SHRSP lived beyond 36 weeks and on histological examination exhibited no evidence of cerebrovascular lesions. Chronic enalapril treatment also prevented the greater urinary excretion of protein and severe renal lesions observed in untreated SHRSP but did not affect urinary salt and water excretion. In anesthetized rats, glomerular filtration rate and tubular reabsorption of water were lower in untreated control SHRSP when compared with enalapril-treated SHRSP. Mean arterial pressure was comparable in both groups. These data support a possible role for ACE inhibition in the prevention of stroke and maintenance of kidney function independent of any marked change in blood pressure of SHRSP. Whether the protective effects of ACE inhibition relate to reduced angiotensin II formation, increased tissue kinins, or another mechanism remains to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "A high salt diet has been shown to increase renal mass of intact rats, although the mechanism by which this occurs has not been investigated. We used Dahl rats that are sensitive (DS) or resistant (DR) to the hypertensinogenic effect of salt to examine changes in renal size and composition caused by a high salt diet. Renal index, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), protein, water content, protein/DNA ratio, and cell number and size were measured in age-matched DR and DS on a high salt diet for 7, 14, or 28 days. The results were compared with those obtained from respective rats on a low salt diet. High salt diet elevated renal index and protein in DR and DS rats at each time point. After 7 days of a high salt diet, DNA increased in DS only. Protein/DNA ratio was progressively decreased by a high salt diet in DS and remained unchanged in DR rats. Cell number was increased 35% in DS versus only 13% in DR rats at 4 weeks. Cell size decreased 24% in DS and only 11% in DR rats. These results indicate that renal growth due to hyperplasia accompanies ingestion of a high salt diet in both DR and DS rats, but the rate of growth and the mechanism through which it occurs differ between strains. This difference may be important in delineating salt sensitivity and future development of hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "The objectives of this study were to determine the hemodynamic and microcirculatory changes that occur during reduced renal mass hypertension in rats. In conscious animals with 75% reduction of total renal mass, mean arterial pressure was initially (4-8 hours) elevated by 15-20 mm Hg during intravenous infusion with isonatremic (145.4 mM) NaCl. Cardiac index was elevated by 15-20%, and total peripheral resistance index was normal or reduced. Cardiac index subsequently returned toward normal, but mean arterial pressure remained elevated (20-40 mm Hg), presumably because of an elevated total peripheral resistance. Cremasteric arterioles were actively constricted (35-50%) in rats with short-term (36 hours), but not chronic (5-6 weeks) reduced renal mass hypertension. Total microvessel density was approximately 15% lower in maximally dilated cremaster muscles of chronically hypertensive rats versus sham-operated controls, which suggests that arterioles are lost during sustained reduced renal mass hypertension. Arteriolar constriction in response to increased superfusate PO2 (0% to 5% O2) was 2-4 times greater in rats with both short-term and chronic reduced renal mass hypertension than in normotensive controls, which suggests that oxygen-dependent autoregulatory mechanisms are altered. The hemodynamic and microcirculatory alterations observed in these experiments suggest that classic short-term autoregulatory mechanisms and an enhanced response of arterioles to increased oxygen availability contribute to the elevated total peripheral resistance in short-term reduced renal mass hypertension, whereas structural changes and altered vascular oxygen responses contribute to an elevated microvascular resistance in chronic reduced renal mass hypertension.\r"

After adjusting for effects of age, gender, race, height, and weight, univariate mixture analysis of the distribution of mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) revealed the presence of only one group, whereas the distribution of RBC Li+-Na+ countertransport values was composed of a mixture of two groups (p less than 0.00005). When bivariate mixture analysis was applied to the combined distribution of MAP and RBC Li+-Na+ countertransport, two commingled subgroups were identified (p less than 0.00005). The smaller group (19%) had significantly higher values for both MAP (108.7 +/- 16.7 mm Hg, mean +/- SD) and RBC Li+-Na+ countertransport (0.455 +/- 0.147 mmol Li+/l cells.hr) than the larger (81%) group (MAP 93.3 +/- 12.2 mm Hg, RBC Li+-Na+ countertransport 0.247 +/- 0.080 mmol Li+/l cells.hr, p less than 0.0001 for both differences). The relation of MAP to RBC Li+-Na+ countertransport was distinctly different in these two subgroups. In the larger group, we found a weak positive (r = 0.21, p less than 0.0001) correlation for unadjusted values, which was not significant after adjustment. The smaller group, with higher levels of MAP and RBC Li+-Na+ countertransport, showed significant negative correlations for both unadjusted (r = -0.28, p less than 0.008) and adjusted (r = -0.41, p less than 0.0001) values.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the prevalence of left ventricular structural and functional abnormalities in previously untreated subjects by performing echocardiography in 89 normal volunteers, 57 patients with established hypertension, and 38 patients with mild or borderline hypertension. We measured left ventricular mass, wall thickness, internal diameter, and wall thickness/radius ratio. Because of intergroup differences in body size, we used covariance analysis to index these variables to a common value of 1.8 m2. No adjustment was needed for the wall thickness/radius ratio. Functional variables determined were fractional shortening and transmitral early/late flow velocity ratio (the latter was standardized by analysis of covariance to age 40 years). The prevalence of left ventricular mass index values more than 2 SD above the mean of the normal group was 30% in the patients with established hypertension and 12-15% in the patients with mild hypertension. Corresponding figures for wall thickness index were 65% and 32% and for the wall thickness/radius ratio 60% and 40%. The prevalence of abnormality in the transmitral flow velocity was 28% in the patients with established hypertension and 12% in the patients with mild hypertension. A multivariate discriminant function that used combined anatomic and functional variables provided the most reliable classification; it was correct in 82% of normal subjects, 65% of patients with established hypertension, and 61% of patients with mild hypertension. The majority of patients with hypertension have cardiac structural or functional abnormalities, or both.\r"

  ".W": "The long-term effect of percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) on blood pressure and renal function was assessed in 100 consecutive patients with atherosclerotic renovascular hypertension. Technical success rates (complete plus partial) of a first PTRA averaged 76.2%, 74.1%, and 67.7% for the unilateral (n = 42), bilateral (n = 27), and solitary (n = 31) groups, respectively. Of the technical successes, 59% (43/73) experienced sustained blood pressure benefit (mostly amelioration) during a mean follow-up period of 29 months. Rates of blood pressure benefit were similar in the three groups. Ostial lesions comprised the majority of blood pressure benefit failures. Repeat angioplasty in 14 patients resulted in a 71% technical success rate and a 50% blood pressure benefit rate during a mean follow-up period of 22 months. Long-term stability of mean serum creatinine level was observed after technically successful angioplasty in all three groups. Acute renal insufficiency, which was reversible in all but one patient, complicated 26% of the procedures. Mechanical complications occurred in 14% (20/145) of the arteries acted on; surgical intervention was required in five patients. The mortality rate was 2%. These results suggest that angioplasty is effective in both the long-term management of renovascular hypertension and the preservation of renal function in a large fraction of patients with atherosclerotic renovascular hypertension.\r"

To eliminate the effects of the anticipation of stress on baseline measures, all subjects participated in a separate 1-hour counterbalanced baseline session in which no stress was presented. There were no significant differences between the two groups in resting blood pressure, heart rate, blood volume pulse, forearm blood flow and vascular resistance, and self-report anxiety, although offspring of hypertensive parents exhibited marginally greater (p = 0.08) forearm blood flow at rest. During the stress session, subjects played video games for 1 hour and avoided mild electric shocks depending on performance. Offspring of hypertensive parents exhibited significantly greater heart rate (+19 +/- 6 vs. +3 +/- 2%), forearm blood flow (+52 +/- 14 vs. +9 +/- 4%), and self-report anxiety (+25 +/- 6 vs. +9 +/- 3%) responses to the task. There were no significant group differences in blood pressure response to the task. Significant positive correlations between forearm blood flow and heart rate responses to the task were observed. These findings extend earlier results that suggested healthy young offspring of hypertensive and normotensive parents may exhibit different patterns of hemodynamic response to stress in the absence of differences in resting blood pressure or blood pressure responsiveness to stress.\r"

Although both SHR and WKY rat strains have been presumed to be fully inbred, recent studies have revealed important biologic variability in WKY rats from different commercial sources. Genealogic evidence suggests that, in the United States, breeding stocks of WKY rats may have been distributed to major commercial suppliers as early as the F10 generation. To test the hypothesis that commercially available WKY rats are genetically heterogeneous, we performed deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) \"fingerprint\" analysis on genomic DNA of WKY rats from two of the largest vendors in the United States, Taconic Farms and Charles River Laboratories. We found molecular evidence of genetic variability not only among WKY rats from two different breeding facilities, but also among WKY rats within a single breeding facility (Taconic Farms). Although some studies have suggested the possibility of biologic variability in SHR from different sources, preliminary studies have not revealed molecular evidence of genetic heterogeneity in SHR from these vendors. In demonstrating genetic variability in WKY rats from different sources, the current study provides compelling evidence that rats designated WKY do not constitute an inbred strain. Accordingly, the results of studies in which SHR and WKY rats are compared might vary because of genetic heterogeneity in \"the WKY rat control strain.\"\r"

  ".U": "89122196\r", 
  ".W": "In inbred dogs with neonatally induced coarctation hypertension, prior serial studies during the first year after aortic banding showed extracellular volume excess with normal plasma renin activity (PRA). The present studies test the hypothesis that slowly evolving aortic constriction in this model will yield intrarenal angiotensin II excess, peripherally undetectable, with continuous slightly positive sodium balance, and thus that chronic blockade of angiotensin II formation will prevent generation of hypertension. Accordingly, we used MK421 (enalapril, 3 mg/kg twice daily), a long-acting angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, or placebo, administered orally, from the time of banding through 4 months after banding in sex-matched littermates randomly assigned to one of four groups: coarcted/MK421; control/MK421; coarcted/placebo; control/placebo. Results indicate that MK421 caused identical lowering of absolute forelimb systolic blood pressure in coarcted and control pups but failed to modify evolution of a significant (p less than 0.005) systolic blood pressure difference in coarcted versus control dogs. Thus, neither temporal course nor final magnitude of relative hypertension was altered by MK421. Efficacy of MK421 was documented by 83% inhibition of the pressor response to angiotensin I at nadir of drug effect and by sustained increases in angiotensin I and renin concentration throughout the period of study. Coarcted and control pups responded similarly to MK421 for all measured variables. Glomerular filtration rate and extracellular volume (measured by [14C]inulin disappearance) did not differ among groups. Thus, chronic administration of MK421 failed to prevent hypertension and did not impair maintenance of normal renal function in the evolving phase of neonatally induced coarctation hypertension. We conclude that, although angiotensin II may participate in the untreated model, it does not appear essential to generation of hypertension. We propose that the renal pressure-natriuresis mechanism regulates distal pressure, that stenosis-related resistance independently determines the proximal-distal difference, and that chronic converting enzyme inhibition lowers the set point of the former without influencing stenosis evolution, thus secondarily lowering proximal pressure by an equal degree.\r"

In diabetic patients we found a significantly higher complication rate after using a long posterior flap than after equal sagittal flaps. No such difference could be demonstrated in non-diabetic patients. We suggest that the higher incidence of atherosclerotic lesions in the three major arteries below the knee in diabetic patients may account for the difference. We recommend the use of the sagittal technique for below-knee amputation in diabetic patients.\r"

Pre-treatment and post-treatment biopsy specimens and microradiographs of the iliac crest and metacarpal and spinal radiographs were evaluated together with biopsy material from seven untreated age-matched controls with FNF. In 17 patients the treatment improved the amount and quality of trabecular bone. Cortical thickness increased in nine patients and there were no losses of amount or mineralisation. The treatment was well tolerated by most patients and there were no major side-effects or signs of bone demineralisation. The study also revealed an unexpected rapid post-fracture deterioration of bone tissue in untreated FNF patients; thus there is an increased risk of further fractures which calls for the use of an effective treatment to increase bone mass.\r"

Type II showed dislocation of the radial head, either with osteochondromas of the proximal radius (Type IIa, two forearms) or secondary to more distal involvement (Type IIb, five forearms). Type III had relative radial shortening due to osteochrondromas at the distal radius (seven forearms). Operations were performed on 16 forearms in 13 patients, with 92% of satisfactory results. For Type I deformity, excision of osteochondromas, immediate ulnar lengthening and corrective osteotomy of the radius are recommended. For Type IIa, excision of the radial head is necessary, and for Type IIb, we advise gradual lengthening of the ulna using an external fixator. Excision of osteochondromas alone gave good results in Type III deformity. Our classification gives a reliable indication of the prognosis and is a guide to the choice of surgical treatment.\r"

A measurement of acetabular index has to be given a range of +/- 6 degrees in order to be 95% confident of including the true measurement. We found the most helpful measurements to be the acetabular index, up to the age of eight years; the centre-edge angle, over the age of five years; and Smith's c/b ratio and neck-shaft angle. We feel, however, that the change in value over a series of radiographs in the same child is much more valuable.

These chondrocytes were autoradiographically proven to have originated from the transplanted grafts. Assessed histologically the success rate was about 80%, a marked improvement over the results reported in previous studies on chondrocyte transplantation without collagen gel. By contrast, the defects without chondrocyte transplantation healed with fibrocartilage. Immunological enhancement induced by transplanted allogenic chondrocytes or collagen was not significant at eight weeks after treatment, so far as shown by both direct and indirect blastformation reactions. Thus, allogenic transplantation of isolated chondrocytes embedded in collagen gel appears to be one of the most promising methods for the restoration of articular cartilage.\r"

In rotation of the leg, the axis took varying inclinations between horizontal and vertical. All axes in each subject lay close to the midpoint of a line between the tips of the malleoli. Our study indicates that the talo-crural joint axis may alter considerably during the arc of motion and differ significantly between individuals.

We therefore prospectively studied 14 patients with severe venous ulcers for up to 18 months and examined various possible prognostic factors, including transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPO2) measurements of skin next to the ulcers. The ulcers had been present for a mean duration of 15.6 months before referral to our clinic. During the study only four patients (29%) had ulcers that were healed with conservative management consisting of topical and systemic antibiotics and conventional and occlusive dressings. We observed that the number of ulcers, their duration before admission to the study, and the extent of lipodermatosclerosis were more pronounced in the unhealed group. For all patients the mean ulcer TcPO2 level (5.6 +/- 1.5 mm Hg, mean +/- standard error) was significantly reduced when compared with the control chest site (62.4 +/- 2.1 mm Hg) (p less than 0.001; paired t test). The mean ulcer TcPO2 was not significantly different between the healed (4.5 +/- 2.0 mm Hg) and unhealed groups (6.1 +/- 2.0 mm Hg). We conclude that TcPO2 levels may not be predictive of the response to therapy in venous ulcers. TcPO2 levels may be markedly reduced, but even extremely low levels are not incompatible with healing.\r"

  ".U": "89123978\r", 
  ".W": "We studied the effect of edema removal on transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPO2) in eight patients with leg ulcers. An external pneumatic compression device was effective in removing edema from the ulcerated limbs over a 5-day course of treatment, at which time all treated limbs were clinically free of edema. TcPO2 levels at room air at the ulcer site were markedly reduced when compared with the control chest site, both before and after external pneumatic compression device therapy (p less than 0.001). Edema removal, however, did not significantly alter TcPO2 values (p greater than 0.9). No significant positional effects on TcPO2 values were noted with patients supine, sitting, or with the affected limbs elevated. Five patients (63%) had increased TcPO2 values adjacent to the ulcer site when receiving supplemental oxygen. For these patients, TcPO2 values increased after oxygen inhalation, both before and after edema removal (p less than 0.05). We conclude that TcPO2 values are markedly reduced in ulcerated edematous limbs. Edema, however, may not constitute a barrier to oxygen diffusion through the skin and does not account for the low TcPO2 values in the ulcerated edematous limb. Therefore the positive therapeutic effect of removing edema is unlikely to be related to better oxygenation of the tissues.\r"

Most of the patients (14) were circumcised for phimosis, often with meatal stenosis, and the diagnosis was made on the foreskin specimen. The remaining six patients had already been circumcised, at ages 32 to 54 years, and had lichen sclerosus et atrophicus of the glans penis. Therefore in this series of patients, the condition occurred only in patients circumcised late in life. This must be considered when a decision about neonatal circumcision is made.\r"

The relative incidence of this condition, compared with the incidence of all forms of lichen planus, was smaller than that reported in the literature. The eruption was distributed over sun-exposed areas, with particular predilection for the face. Covered areas and mucous membranes were spared except for one patient who had involvement of the vermilion border of the lower lip. In most cases the lesions consisted of erythematous brownish plaques with an annular configuration. Less commonly, discrete and confluent papules and hypermelanotic patches, sometimes assuming a melasma-like appearance, were present. The prominent histopathologic features consisted of an interface dermatitis characterized by coarse vacuolar degeneration of the basal cell layer, a mid-dermal perivascular predominantly lymphocytic inflammatory cell infiltrate, and a significant degree of pigment incontinence. Parakeratosis, eczematous changes confined to the follicular epithelium, and a variable degree of solar elastosis were seen in some patients. Mucin deposition was noted in the reticular dermis in two cases.\r"

The patient with generalized granuloma annulare was clinically reminiscent of the previously described papular eruption seen in HIV-positive patients. In several patients with the localized form, Kaposi's sarcoma was considered in the differential diagnosis. In all patients, however, the eruptions were surprisingly transient. The similarity of the localized form of granuloma annulare to Kaposi's sarcoma and the generalized micropapular form to the papular eruption of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome seen in HIV-positive patients illustrates the usefulness of skin biopsies in these patients.\r"

Two patients, one exposed to radiation therapeutically and one accidentally, are described. Skin biopsy specimens showed an interface dermatitis characterized by numerous dyskeratotic epidermal cells with lymphocytes in close apposition (satellite cell necrosis); that is, the epidermal changes were similar to those in acute graft-versus-host disease. Because recipients of bone marrow transplants frequently receive total body irradiation as part of their preparatory regimen, the ability of radiation to cause persistent epidermal changes similar to those in acute graft-versus-host disease could complicate the interpretation of posttransplant skin biopsy specimens.\r"

Alopecia without any sign of scalp inflammation or scarring was noted. In the older child spontaneous remission occurred within 3 months, whereas the condition remained active in the younger boy for a follow-up period of 1 year. Trichograms from clinically involved and uninvolved areas disclosed a striking predominance of anagen hairs (98% to 100%) and complete absence of telogen hairs. A loss of the normal round or oval configuration of many hair shafts could be well visualized by the shrinking tube technique. Horizontal and transverse sections of scalp obtained for biopsy revealed marked cleft formations between hair shafts and regressively altered inner root sheaths. We suggest the name loose anagen hair of childhood for this newly described disease.\r"

The majority of patients were blond girls, aged 2 to 5 years, but both sexes and those with dark hair can be affected. The hair was not fragile, and easily pulled hairs were misshapen anagen hairs without external root sheaths. Histologic examination of the hair showed abnormal premature keratinization of Huxley's and Henle's layers of the inner root sheath in some samples. Length and density of hair gradually increased with age, but anagen hairs remained loosely anchored in adulthood. This report describes findings in 22 children and five adults with the loose anagen syndrome.\r"

To investigate the anticancer and cancer preventive effects of retinoids we have examined the effect of systemic isotretinoin on dysplastic nevi. After confirmatory baseline biopsies, eleven patients with the dysplastic nevus syndrome were treated with oral isotretinoin, 40 mg twice a day for 4 months. At completion of therapy, at least three previously identified and photographed clinically typical dysplastic nevi were rephotographed and removed for histologic evaluation. Eight patients completed the full course of medication. There were no clinical changes in the dysplastic nevi in these patients. Posttherapy biopsy specimens in six volunteers revealed most of the remaining lesions to be dysplastic nevi. The majority of lesions biopsied in two subjects showed normal, benign nevi only. This proportion of clinically typical dysplastic nevi that prove to be normal nevi histologically (28%) is not significantly different from that reported by others. Oral isotretinoin does not appear to have a significant biologic effect on the clinical or histologic appearance of dysplastic nevi in the treatment schedule employed.\r"

Sunburst varicosities are widened cutaneous veins located within the superficial vessel net as well as within descending branches, often with an asymmetrically thickened wall. The thickened vessel walls contain collagenous and muscle fibers. Only a few elastic fibers have been detected, as opposed to numerous oxytalan fibers. Electron microscopy reveals an interfibrillar collagenous dysplasia, lattice collagen, and some matrix vesicles. The center of sunburst vessels is found at depths ranging from 175 to 382 microns below the stratum granulosum.\r"

With the 1/3%-solution, the remaining 280 legs had the blue veins feeding the spider telangiectasias injected rather than the spider itself. When injected directly into the spider veins, the lesser concentration gave fewer ulcerations and less pigmentation, but equal treatment results. Injecting the subcutaneous feeder veins appears to provide more permanent clearing of the lesions with fewer recurrences and no side effects. No allergic or other major complications occurred with the injection treatments.\r"

In some cases, an insufficient understanding of the interrelationships among factors influencing health behaviors may be responsible for the failures. This study used social cognitive theory, a framework for studying behaviors, to structure the relationships between measurable factors important to the frequency of health-oriented food consumption. We developed a model that incorporated factors for social environment, reinforcement, commitment, behavior modeling, knowledge, and attitude relative to the frequency of consumption of four beverages (whole milk, low-fat/skin milk, regular soda, and diet soda). Four-hundred fifty-seven middle-aged adults (mean age, 47 years; 58% female) and 709 college students (mean age, 21 years; 50% female) responded to a written questionnaire designed as a self-report on frequency of consumption and measures for 10 social cognitive variables. For all four beverages, the model explained 35% or more of the variance in frequency of consumption, thus confirming its predictive power. We used the statistical approach known as path analysis to examine the relationships within the model. The analysis demonstrated that factors influencing the consumption varied between the two age groups (e.g., nutrition knowledge was related to attitude in adult soda-drinking models but not in student soda-drinking models) and between forms of the beverages (e.g., for student models, nutrition knowledge was related to taste enjoyment for low-fat/skim milk but not for whole milk).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The new ration, Meal-Ready-to-Eat (MRE), was the sole source of food for an experimental group of 27 soldiers engaged in a 34-day field exercise. A control group of 30 soldiers ate a freshly prepared (A ration) breakfast and dinner and an MRE lunch. Agreement of mean nutrient intake values from self-estimated and weighed data was high among both experimental and control groups (average coefficients of correlation for 16 nutrients, 0.948 and 0.884, respectively). Paired t-tests yielded no significant differences between self-estimated and weighed means for nutrient intake but were significantly different from the means obtained by the combined method (p less than .0001). Mean nutrient intakes determined by both the self-estimated and weighed methods approached 90% of the intakes found by the combined method.\r"

  ".W": "Calcium intake has been implicated in the etiology of age-related osteoporosis. There is evidence to suggest that many postmenopausal women consume inadequate calcium to maintain calcium balance. One of the most accurate methods of calculating dietary intake is the weighed food record; however, that method is time consuming and unsuitable for large numbers of individuals. To determine the adequacy of calcium intake in the large numbers of postmenopausal women at risk of osteoporosis, simpler methods of assessing calcium intake are required. We therefore developed a food frequency questionnaire and tested it against a 4-day weighed food record in 54 Caucasian women, between 29 and 72 years of age. Twenty-six of the women (Group 1) completed a 4-day record and questionnaire within 1 week. Another 28 women (Group 2) completed the questionnaire 1 to 12 months after completing the 4-day food diary. A good correlation (r = .79, p less than .001) was found between the two methods of calculating calcium intake for the 54 women. Independent analysis of Group 1 and Group 2 showed correlation coefficients of 0.81 and 0.78, respectively. The correlation for postmenopausal women (r = .84) was similar to that of premenopausal women (r = .79). The data show that a short, simple questionnaire can be used to rank individuals according to adequacy of calcium intake as a prerequisite to nutrition intervention.\r"

Four pork entree recipes were selected for analysis: roast pork, pork and noodle casserole, pan-broiled pork chops, and pork chops with vegetables. Assumptions were made about changes expected to occur in the ingredients during preparation and cooking. Models were designed to simulate the algorithms of the calculation methods using a microcomputer spreadsheet software package. Identical results were generated in the yield factor, retention factor, and summing-cooked models for roast pork. The retention factor and summing-cooked models also produced identical results for the recipe for pan-broiled pork chops. The summing-raw model gave the highest value for water in all four recipes and the lowest values for most of the other nutrients. A superior method or methods was not identified. However, on the basis of the capabilities provided with the yield factor and retention factor methods, more serious consideration of these two methods is recommended.\r"

The average return from 289 surveys was 75%. A mean of 64% of responding hospitals provide patient counseling on drug-nutrient interactions. All statistical analysis was by chi-square. Calculations revealed that less than 50% of hospitals require a physician's order to provide drug-nutrient interaction counseling. More than 50% involve a registered dietitian in providing such counseling. The monoamine oxidase inhibitor drugs were cited most frequently as the group of drugs for which counseling was needed. Other drug groups for which patient counseling is needed include: diuretics, anticoagulants, tetracyclines, oral hypoglycemics, insulin, antihypertensives and/or cardiac drugs, antibiotics, and corticosteroids. Having the dietitian or other dietary personnel scan the patient chart was cited most often as the preferred method for detection of patients taking the drugs. A final statistical calculation revealed that there is no difference between teaching and nonteaching hospitals in the number providing a drug-nutrient counseling program.\r"

To test this computerized nutrient analysis program, two sets of 3-day diet records from 200 elderly individuals were analyzed. The program was then used to generate means, differences between means, and distribution frequencies of designated nutrients for various population subgroups (e.g., men greater than or equal to 65 years vs. men greater than or equal to 80 years) as well as comparisons with individual files (e.g., Mr. Smith vs. all men greater than or equal to 65 years). The statistical and graphics capabilities also function within the context of recipe analysis and menu planning, which enhances the application of this program in institutional and community nutrition settings.\r"

  ".U": "89124357\r", 
  ".W": "Fresh circulating PBMC from HIV-1 seropositive individuals have been found to mediate specific, non-MHC restricted lysis of targets expressing the major envelope glycoprotein of HIV-1, gp120, in 6-h 51Cr release assays. This gp120 specific cell-mediated cytotoxicity (CMC) is broadly reactive against target cells infected with a wide range of viral isolates, is IL-2 augmentable, and is mediated by a CD16+, Leu-7+, CD15-, CD3- population of NK/K cells. The presence of FcR (CD16) on these cells suggested that the lytic specificity for gp120 might be directed by cytophilic antibody bound to the cell surface. Affinity purified F(ab')2 antibody fragments specific for the Fc and F(ab')2 portions of human IgG were used in attempts to block gp120 specific lysis. A 1/50 dilution of these antibodies inhibited gp120 specific cytolytic activity by more than 90% while exhibiting a minimal effect on NK/K cell lysis of K562 targets. The blocking activity of these fragments demonstrates the direct involvement of cytophilic antibody in CMC. In attempts to isolate this cytophilic anti-HIV-1 antibody, short 56 degrees C incubations were used to dissociate antibodies from the surface of PBMC of seropositive individuals. The supernatants generated in this manner exhibited specific gp120 activity in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity assays. The ability of Staphylococcal protein A to remove this activity confirms the presence of cytophilic antibody on freshly isolated PBMC. Selective enrichment of specific cell subpopulations revealed the origin of the cytophilic antibody to be CD16+ NK/K cells and not B cells, T cells, or monocytes/macrophages. These studies show that the gp120-specific CMC seen in HIV-1 seropositive individuals is directed by cytophilic antibody bound to circulating CD16+ NK/K cells and represents a form of direct antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity which may provide a primary cytotoxic host defense.\r"

The lysis of large unilamellar vesicles was monitored by measuring the release of the encapsulated fluorescent dye carboxyfluorescein. NKCF-induced lysis was only observed with liposomes composed of a complex mixture of lipids including acidic phospholipids. No lysis could be demonstrated if the liposomes contained phosphatidylcholine as the only phospholipid, suggesting some kind of lipid specificity for the action of NKCF. A remarkable finding was that neither recombinant nor natural TNF were able to lyse large unilamellar vesicles, irrespective of their lipid composition, indicating different ways of interaction of NKCF and TNF with artificial (and presumably also biological) membranes.\r"

The analysis of SRBC agglutinin response in H line, L line, F1 hybrids, F2, and backcross segregants demonstrates that Ab responsiveness is a polygenic trait regulated by the additive interaction of 5 to 7 independent loci, with an incomplete dominance (44% +/- 7%) of the high response character, and a 30% +/- 10% impact of the environmental factors. The life span of H, L, F1, F2, and backcross populations is correlated positively with 2-ME-resistant agglutinin response (r = 0.97, p less than 0.001) and negatively with 2-ME-sensitive agglutinin response (r = 0.95, p = 0.01) (interpopulation correlation). Similar correlations are also observed in individuals of the various populations, especially in F1 x L backcross, in which the largest phenotypic variance is found. The positive correlation between Ab responsiveness and life span was confirmed by ELISA titration for distinct IgG isotypes (intrapopulation correlation). Malignant lymphomas and chronic nephritis were the two most common diseases observed. The age-adjusted incidence of such diseases, which is largely affected by environmental factors, accounts for the longer life span of H, as compared with L, mouse populations. The longevity of the 30% or less survivors, chiefly determined by the rate of physiologic aging, is a polygenic character regulated by the cumulative interaction of 3 to 7 independent loci, with a complete dominance of the long life trait and an impact of the environmental factors of about 60%. Thus we have grounds for regarding general Ab responsiveness and life span as polygenic traits regulated by a small number of identical or closely linked gene loci, and immune responsiveness as a defense mechanism against neoplastic and inflammatory diseases.\r"

Inhibition by amastatin consisted of a high-affinity component (Ki = 3.5 x 10(-6) M) which accounted for approximately 20% of the total activity and a low-affinity component (Ki = 3.5 x 10(-5) M) which accounted for the remainder suggesting that two forms of aminopeptidase exist. Only a single component of inhibition was seen with bestatin (Ki = 3.5 x 10(-6) M) and 1,10 phenanthroline (Ki = 2.0 x 10(-4) M) which accounted for 80 and 90% of the total enzyme activity, respectively. Unlike the competitive inhibitors bestatin and amastatin, inhibition by 1,10 phenanthroline was shown to be non-competitive. Finally, surface aminopeptidase activity essentially doubled in the presence of PHA (10 micrograms/ml) or Con A (10 micrograms/ml), at 72 h. This enhancing effect was shown to be dose dependent, time dependent, and mitogen dependent and correlated with the cellular state of activation as determined by [3H]TdR incorporation.\r"

When these mast cells were cultured for 30 to 120 min with the phorbol ester PMA (10(-8) or 10(-7) M), protein kinase C activity was increased and Ag-stimulated beta-hexosaminidase release was modestly inhibited, whereas A23187-stimulated release was synergistically enhanced. However, in both cases, exogenous adenosine failed to augment beta-hexosaminidase release. Overnight PMA exposure produced a decrease in protein kinase C activity and a decrease in both Ag- and A23187-stimulated preformed mediator release, as well as a lack of responsiveness to adenosine. This hyporesponsiveness could be reversed by 24 h after washing the cells free of PMA. The generation of the arachidonic acid metabolite leukotriene C4 was not altered by mast cell PMA exposure. The ability of adenosine to increase intracellular cAMP concentrations was modestly blunted by high doses of PMA, and PMA abrogated the increase in intracellular free calcium levels usually observed in cells stimulated with Ag in the presence of 10(-5) M adenosine. PMA exposure induces a hyporesponsiveness to adenosine in mast cells, either by a direct effect on protein kinase C activity and/or by an effect on adenosine receptor expression or recycling.\r"

  ".W": "Elevation of intracellular cAMP has been associated with the suppression of macrophage activation. The present study has examined the effects of agents that alter intracellular levels of cAMP on LPS-induced macrophage gene expression. Treatment of murine peritoneal macrophages with trace amounts of LPS leads to dramatically enhanced expression of multiple mRNA including the competence genes JE and KC, first observed in platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated fibroblasts, and those encoding the inflammatory monokines IL-1 and TNF. If macrophages are first treated with cholera toxin or dibutyryl cAMP 15 min before stimulation with LPS, the accumulation of mRNA encoding both JE and TNF is strongly suppressed whereas mRNA levels for KC and IL-1 are unaffected. The suppression of JE and TNF mRNA levels is dose dependent, in the range of 10 to 500 microM dibutyryl cAMP; concentrations as high as 1 mM do not affect the expression of either KC or IL-1. When dibutyryl cAMP is added to macrophages after initiation of LPS treatment, suppressive effects are diminished in a time-dependent fashion. Furthermore, dibutyryl cAMP suppresses the LPS-induced transcriptional activation of the TNF gene. Previous work has shown that the LPS-induced expression of JE appears to be mediated by hydrolysis of polyphosphoinositides and involves a post-transcriptional mechanism. Treatment with dibutyryl cAMP suppresses JE expression induced by treatment with phorbol ester and A23187 suggesting that inhibition of gene expression must act at a site other than the initial transmembrane signaling event. Finally, dibutyryl cAMP only marginally affects the constitutive transcription of the JE gene indicating that suppression may involve a post-transcriptional mechanism. These results indicate that expression of genes encoding inducible early proteins and inflammatory monokines are selectively regulated by elevation of intracellular cAMP. Such effects may be pleiotropic in nature involving multiple molecular mechanisms.\r"

  ".U": "89124387\r", 
  ".W": "The intracellular glutathione levels of two human tumor lines and seven murine tumor lines were determined in order to investigate the role of oxidant injury in tumor cell sensitivity to human rTNF (rhTNF). Correlations were found between high intracellular glutathione levels and in vivo tumor resistance to rhTNF, and on the other hand, low glutathione levels and rhTNF sensitivity. The transplantable murine fibrosarcoma, Meth A, a TNF-sensitive line in vivo, was less sensitive to rhTNF and host toxicity was reduced when the hosts were pretreated with uric acid, a major reactive oxygen scavenger in humans and certain other primates. Conversely, pretreatment of the tumor-bearing hosts with DL-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine, an inhibitor of GSH biosynthesis, resulted in an increased sensitivity of Meth A to rhTNF. This effect was not limited to tumor-bearing mice, as rats pretreated with diethyl maleate, a compound which irreversibly binds glutathione, were more sensitive to rhTNF toxicity than control rats. On the other hand, pretreatment with N-acetyl cysteine, an oxidant scavenger, reduced the toxicity of rhTNF treatment in rats. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that tumor cell sensitivity to rhTNF in vivo is dependent on its capacity to buffer oxidative attack. In addition, host toxicity is also related to the production of reactive oxygen species. Activated effector cells such as granulocytes and macrophages are hypothesized to produce most of this damage by their respiratory burst and oxidant release, although the direct action of rhTNF may also contribute to oxidative injury in vivo.\r"

At least eight distinct MAb specificities were identified. Epitopes recognized by MAbs bearing these specificities were localized in the hexose, heptose, and 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid regions of the core oligosaccharide and on lipid A. Two groups of MAbs exhibited multispecificity for similar but distinct core- and lipid A-related epitopes. Some core-reactive MAbs cross-reacted with corresponding E. coli and Salmonella rough mutant chemotypes; others were specific for E. coli J5 LPS. Lipid A-specific MAbs reacted with free lipid A from diverse sources. Few MAbs reacted with smooth LPS. Antibody cross-reactivity was restricted by inter- and intraspecies differences in covalent core structure and by epitope concealment by overlying O-side chain and core sugars. The putative cross-reactive and antiendotoxic properties of MAbs specific for the core-lipid A complex may be limited by the inability of such MAbs to recognize determinants on \"native\" LPS.\r"

All patients with a chronic form of brucellosis or a relapse were in the second group. In most cases, Brucella antibodies, although falling to low levels, remained measurable. Cutoff levels for IgM and IgG were calculated after considering serum antibody concentrations in people who had recovered from an infection. A separate normal range was established for occupationally exposed workers. On admission, sera from all patients contained Brucella antibody levels greater than established cutoff levels.

Western blots showed that immune rabbit serum reacted with proteins of molecular masses of 8, 24, and 36-41 kilodaltons in both unengorged and engorged tick salivary glands. Additional reacting bands in the immunoblot of the engorged salivary gland indicated that new antigenic components of the salivary gland are synthesized during engorgement. Rabbits did not produce antibodies to tick midgut components. Murine monoclonal antibody 11G1 detected outer surface protein A of B. burgdorferi in immunoblots of midguts from unengorged ticks, faintly in engorged salivary gland, and seldomly in unengorged salivary gland, findings suggesting that the spirochete is transmitted to the host via tick saliva during the later stages of feeding.\r"

Our preparation consists of small silica particles (5-10 microns in diameter) covalently linked to a potent antiamoebic drug, 2-(4-aminophenoxymethyl)-5-nitro-1-methyl imidazole. Silica-drug particles were injected into mice, hamsters, and guinea pigs. We found that trophozoites phagocytosed the particles in vivo and in vitro, followed by rapid cell death due to the released drug. Analysis of mouse serum revealed that no drug was absorbed from the intestine after placement of the drug-containing particles in the intestine. The antiamoebic activity of particles recovered from the intestine was almost fully retained. This novel antiamoebic concept may be useful for luminal therapy for asymptomatic amebiasis and may minimize side effects and frequency of administration.\r"

This change has greatly widened the market for reliable new medical information, but it has also brought new tensions among authors, journals publishing their papers, and the news media. Does informal publication of new medical information before its appearance in scientific documents injure the interests of authors, journals, and the wider public? The possible answers depend in large part on how physicians should be expected to function in this new age of expanding information and speedier communication. A possible solution for these new problems would be access for all interested parties to journal papers through an on-line system at the point of their acceptance.\r"

The five resistant viruses were obtained from three members of a family undergoing therapy or prophylaxis with rimantadine. Resistant influenza emerged during treatment with rimantadine and spread to two family contacts, causing typical influenza with fever, myalgia, and cough of 5 days' or less duration. Genetic characterization of the resistant viruses when compared to the susceptible virus isolated on day 1 from the index case revealed a single amino acid change in the transmembrane portion of the M2 protein. In vitro studies showed that rimantadine was significantly more active than amantadine against both H1N1 and H3N2 viruses. Although this resistant influenza was transmitted and caused illness in one family, the absence of naturally occurring resistant viruses suggests that the emergence of new strains of influenza A each few years may prevent the widespread emergence of resistant influenza A virus.\r"

We have now further characterized the humoral immune response of VZV-infected humans to this complex and established that it is a major viral antigen. Antibodies to VZV p32/p36 were detected in sera from patients with both primary VZV infection (chickenpox) and VZV reactivation (zoster); the response after zoster was more pronounced. When the IgM and IgG components of the immune response were distinguished, IgM to the viral nucleoproteins was observed following chickenpox and zoster and, to a lesser extent, in recipients of VZV vaccine. An IgM response to VZV p32 also was detected during intrauterine VZV infection and subclinical VZV infection.\r"

There were 391 children, 2-18 months old, studied for the occurrence of diarrhea during the 18 months after vaccination. Three doses of the vaccine provided 40% protection against any diarrheal illness associated with rotavirus alone but 58%-75%; protection against the more severe rotaviral illnesses. The vaccine appeared to be more efficacious when it was administered to children in the first year of life. Three doses provided up to 89% efficacy against more severe diseases due to serotype 1 rotavirus, and one dose also afforded significant protection. The protection was lower, even with three doses, against serotype 2 rotavirus. This vaccine trial has provided important insights on how such trials should be conducted and on the serotype-specificity of protection from rotavirus infection. Future vaccines should be able to protect against severe disease caused by all rotavirus serotypes and must work in developing countries where rotavirus is the most important cause of diarrheal mortality.\r"

Cells were considered positive if more than 50 grains of silver (over background) per 200 micron 2 were seen over cells that did not stain with eosin. Most of the positive cells resembled macrophages, although cells with condensed nuclei resembling lymphocytes were found. No epithelial cells expressing viral RNA were detected. Formaldehyde-fixed eosinophils gave spurious signals that could be reduced with sulfhydryl modifying agents. HIV-1 may be disseminated in the lamina propria of the gut at low concentrations in some patients but may not be detectable in others. The lower gut lining may be both a portal of initial infection with HIV and a target of disseminated HIV infection.\r"

Two reservists with early serum samples had documented seroconversion, defined by a four-fold or greater increase in titer of antibody to E. canis, with a peak titer of greater than or equal to 1:160. Reservists with serological evidence of Ehrlichia infection were more than three times as likely to report arthralgia, myalgia, headache, appetite loss, nausea, eye pain, and abdominal pain than the other reservists. No reservist with serological evidence of Ehrlichia infection was hospitalized and most had minimal or no symptoms. This outbreak of ehrlichiosis suggests that the usual symptoms of Ehrlichia infection are milder than previously reported and that ehrlichiosis must be considered in symptomatic persons with recent tick exposure.\r"

  ".W": "Modified hemoglobin solutions have potential application as plasma expanders with oxygen-transporting capacity. In a previous study it was found that modification of hemoglobin by intramolecular cross-linking with 2-nor-2-formylpyridoxal 5'-phosphate (NFPLP) improves the vascular retention time by a factor of three, and it also improves the oxygen-transporting properties. In the present study we investigated in rats how, after exchange transfusion of a clinically relevant dose, the modified hemoglobin (HbNFPLP) was distributed in the body compared with how the unmodified hemoglobin was distributed. By using a new technetium 99m labeling technique, we found in a scintigraphic study that accumulation of hemoglobin in the kidneys was greatly diminished by the intramolecular cross-linking with NFPLP. These findings were confirmed by light-microscopic observations after diaminobenzidine staining. It was concluded that the impairment of kidney function caused by blockade of the tubuli is not to be expected from HbNFPLP. In the liver and spleen, where the free HbNFPLP is possibly eliminated, some accumulation of 99mTc label was observed, but the major part of the extravascular label was diffusely spread throughout the body. This led to the conclusion that important accumulation of undegraded HbNFPLP does not occur in the liver and spleen. Rapid appearance of both hemoglobin and HbNFPLP in the lymph showed that cross-linking with NFPLP does not prevent the distribution of hemoglobin over the interstitial space in the first hours after administration. However, pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that transcapillary transfer contributes only to a limited extent to the disappearance from the circulation. During 24-hour infusions of HbNFPLP, a steady state with a constant plasma concentration was easily reached. The latter experiment indicated that the eliminating system does not become saturated during prolonged administration of large doses of HbNFPLP.\r"

  ".W": "Because of the demonstrated ability of fibronectin to mediate particle uptake by macrophages and the demonstrated affinity of plasma fibronectin for fibrin, we investigated the ability of plasma fibronectin to augment macrophage binding of fibrin. Fibronectin significantly increased fibrin binding by elicited peritoneal macrophages and isolated hepatic Kupffer cells. The binding of fibrinogen was not augmented in the presence of fibronectin. The small amount of macrophage-associated fibrin observed in the absence of fibronectin was primarily internalized, whereas the increment in fibrin binding in the presence of fibronectin remained primarily surface bound, as indicated by susceptibility to removal by trypsin. An amino terminal fibrin-binding fragment of plasma fibronectin could similarly support binding of fibrin by peritoneal macrophages. Greater quantities of fibrin were associated with the macrophages in the presence of protease inhibitors, which inhibited elastase activity, but not in the presence of those that inhibited cathepsin activity, suggesting that an elastase-like protease may degrade surface-bound fibrin. Uptake of both fibrin and fibronectin was inhibited by prior treatment of cells with trypsin. Competitive binding studies suggested the presence of a high-affinity fibronectin receptor on peritoneal macrophages. Data from the current study thus support the conclusion that fibronectin augments binding of fibrin to the surface of mononuclear phagocytes.\r"

The accumulation of collagen and the morphologic changes caused by dimethylnitrosamine, such as inflammatory cell accumulation and fibrosis, were also prevented by this drug. Malotilate drastically reduced the increases in the amount of type I procollagen alpha 2-chain mRNA and activities of the enzymes prolyl 4-hydroxylase and galactosylhydroxylysyl glucosyltransferase, which are early events in liver fibrosis preceding the deposition of collagen. Even when started 14 days after dimethylnitrosamine induction, malotilate treatment was able to reduce liver damage.

We also examined the relationship of lung and muscle edema to arterial oxygenation and muscle energy metabolism during sepsis. Cecal ligation and perforation were used to induce sepsis. Five animals served as sham-operated controls. Five animals were infused with 0.9% saline solution and five with 10% low molecular weight hydroxyethyl starch (hetastarch). Thermodilution cardiac output, plasma colloid osmotic pressure, and arterial blood gases were sequentially measured over a 6-hour interval. At 6 hours, a biopsy specimen was taken from the rectus femoris and the lungs and adductor magnus muscle harvested for gravimetric analysis (wet-dry/dry weight ratio). The colloid osmotic pressure was 16.1 +/- 1.2 mm Hg in the control animals, 9.3 +/- 0.5 mm Hg in the saline solution-infused animals, and 21.6 +/- 0.5 mm Hg in the hetastarch-infused animals at 6 hours (p less than 0.05 saline vs control, hetastarch). The lung wet-dry/dry weight ratio was 3.46 +/- 0.11 in the control animals, 3.74 +/- 0.13 in the saline group, and 3.64 +/- 0.11 in the hetastarch group (difference not significant). Arterial oxygenation was not significantly different in the three groups. Muscle wet-dry/dry weight ratio was 3.11 +/- 0.16 in the control animals, 2.75 +/- 0.12 in the hetastarch-infused animals, and 3.06 +/- 0.08 in the saline-infused group (not significant). There were no significant differences in skeletal muscle energy production or lactate/pyruvate ratio between the three groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Bronchial mucociliary clearance (CB) and tracheal mucus velocity (TMV) were measured during the course of repeated inhalations of histamine in six subjects with asthma who had no symptoms in a double-blind, crossover study with a radioaerosol technique. Subjects inhaled a technetium 99m-labeled ferric oxide aerosol with an aerodynamic diameter of approximately 8 microns. CB was recorded for 2.5 hours with a gamma camera, and TMV measured with a multidetector probe situated over the extrathoracic trachea. Histamine was administered repeatedly in concentrations previously shown to produce a 20% fall in forced expired volume in 1 second and at intervals allowing 90% recovery of pulmonary function. Histamine produced a 28% increase in CB (p less than 0.001, analysis of variance) and an 87% increase in TMV (p less than 0.001, analysis of variance) above control values, which was not significantly different from that previously observed in normal subjects receiving significantly higher concentrations of histamine. We conclude that histamine stimulates the mucus transport mechanism in subjects with asthma and that there is a relative hypersensitivity to histamine when these subjects are compared with normal subjects.\r"

Test subjects received iodine 125-labeled C4 intravenously, and plasma disappearance curves for 125I-C4 were plotted. By nonlinear least-squares analysis, we fit two-, three-, and four-exponential models of plasma disappearance to the plasma curves of each subject. Goodness of fit was significantly better for all subjects with the three-exponential versus the two-exponential model (p less than 0.0005). No further improvement in curve fit was accomplished by using a four-exponential model (p greater than 0.5). Metabolic rates and extravascular/plasma ratios calculated from the two- and three-exponential models were significantly different. As judged by extravascular/plasma ratio, the two-exponential model underestimated the amount of extravascular C4. Furthermore, the two-exponential model significantly over-estimated catabolic and synthetic rates. Hence, our results show that C4 kinetics are not optimally described by a conventional, two-exponential model. A possible explanation for our findings is that in previous studies of C4 metabolism, the analysis of plasma radioactivity disappearance curves was done by inspection, whereas we used least-squares analysis, a method that determines the number of exponentials with greater reliability.\r"

  ".W": "Very little information is available concerning the relationship between metallothionein and disease in humans. Recently, investigators have used the Cd-heme method to measure metallothionein levels in human liver samples obtained from autopsy. This assay, however, is not sensitive enough to measure metallothionein in small tissue biopsy specimens. As an alternative, we report the development of a human metallothionein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). This assay used high-performance liquid chromatography-purified human metallothionein-1 and purified sheep anti-human metallothionein-1 IgG. A limiting antigen coating concentration of 100 ng/ml and a minimal antibody dilution of 1:4000 were chosen. The sensitivity of the ELISA extended to 300 ng/ml (15 ng). The coefficients of interassay and intraassay variation were 15.4% and 4.2%, respectively. Human livers obtained from autopsy were assayed by this method and the values compared with values obtained by the Cd-heme method. The livers were separated by their autopsy reports into four groups: normal, immunosuppression, cancer, and infection. Livers from the infection group (ELISA 2979 micrograms/gm, Cd-heme 1201 micrograms/gm) contained significantly more metallothionein than those from the normal (ELISA, 1035 micrograms/gm, Cd-heme 245 micrograms/gm) and the immunosuppression (ELISA 1272 micrograms/gm, Cd-heme 221 micrograms/gm) groups (p less than 0.05). The cancer group (ELISA 2415 micrograms/gm) also had significantly elevated liver metallothionein levels. We conclude that this ELISA is sensitive enough for the measurement of tissue samples. Furthermore this assay is comparable to the Cd-heme assay in its ability to reflect metallothionein values among various treatment groups. We postulate that hepatic metallothionein induction is mediated by disease-related mechanisms such as interleukin-1, glucocorticoid secretion, or both.\r"

The optimum temperature and time for the binding were 37 degrees C and 30 minutes, respectively. On increase in the amount of 125I-labeled fibronectin, its binding to PMNs became saturated. Scatchard analysis of data on binding indicated the presence of a single class of binding sites. PMNs from 15 normal subjects had approximately 6.3 +/- 1.6 x 10(3) sites per cell and a dissociation constant of 10.2 +/- 2.4 x 10(-9) mol/L, indicating that they had high affinity for soluble fibronectin. Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser inhibited the binding of fibronectin to PMNs, strongly suggesting that the fibronectin receptor is one of the Arg-Gly-Asp receptor family. The plasma level of fibronectin was higher in patients with hyperthyroidism and lower in patients with hypothyroidism than in normal subjects, without any significant change in the number of fibronectin binding sites of the PMNs. However, the number of binding sites of fibronectin on PMNs of patients with aplastic anemia was increased, probably because of sensitization of the PMNs with immune complex and other factors.\r"

Although levels of triglyceride, cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and lipoprotein phospholipids in whole plasma of the patients with diabetes were similar to those in controls, their FC levels and FC/lecithin ratio, a recently described index of cardiovascular risk, both were abnormally increased (p less than 0.01). In the HDL-containing plasma fraction, concentrations of sphingomyelin, lecithin, and lysolecithin all were significantly reduced (p less than 0.05; p less than 0.01, and p less than 0.02, respectively). These compositional changes may be potentially atherogenic, because a reduction in the phospholipid content of HDL may impair its capacity to promote the efflux of cholesterol from cells, and the transfer of cholesterol ester from HDL to the larger apo-B-containing lipoproteins is inhibited when their content of FC is increased relative to phospholipid. These previously unrecognized qualitative defects, which are inapparent in the routine estimation of plasma lipids, may compromise reverse cholesterol transport and thereby promote atherogenesis in women with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\r"

Using a rebreathing technique, we found that previously fed mice had an apparent VCO that was 40% greater than that of mice that had been fasted before the study. This unexpected result was shown to reflect an excess CO production by the excreta (feces, urine, or both) of fed mice relative to the excreta of fasted mice. Incubation of feces and urine of humans, rats, and mice demonstrated CO release that was not inhibited by autoclaving or acidification to pH 1. CO release from excreta was markedly reduced, however, under anaerobic conditions, and fed and fasted animals excreted CO at the same rate when their excreta were maintained in an anaerobic state. We conclude that feces and urine can release CO via nonenzymatic, oxidative reactions and, under some circumstances, this source of CO can influence measurements of VCO.\r"

To encourage \"stoical\" patients to seek medical care, nonthreatening educational approaches to cardiac disease and concentrated efforts to reduce anxiety toward hospitals are needed. Family physicians knowledgeable about the effects of denial can screen cardiac-prone patients for inappropriate denial and alter diagnostic approaches in an attempt to lessen the role denial plays in cardiac deaths.\r"

There was a trend toward a higher rate for obtaining telephone advice by the single-parent families and a higher rate of after-hours care among the two-parent families. Single-parent families were also more likely to feel they needed care but did not obtain it. Differences that exist in the health care utilization patterns of single- and two-parent families should be considered in assessing health care needs of families.\r"

Whether or not this susceptibility to mental distress is also evident in those who are being educated to enter the occupation has not been previously studied. The purpose of the present study was to examine the presence of psychiatric symptomatology in a sample of dental students by using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist. Results indicate that dental students evidenced considerably higher symptom levels than those previously reported in a general population survey. Compared with the general population, dental students showed a mild elevation in somatic symptomatology, a moderate elevation in anxiety and depressive symptomatology, and a marked elevation in obsessive-compulsive symptomatology and interpersonal sensitivity. It is possible that the marked elevations in obsessive-compulsive symptomatology and in interpersonal sensitivity may reflect in part a sensitization to excessive performance demands. This sensitization may manifest itself in cognitive inefficiencies such as indecisiveness, blocking or memory impairment, and excess sensitivity to the evaluative judgments of other people. In comparing dental students with other sample groups, dental students were also found to evidence more psychiatric symptomatology than general medical patients judged free of psychiatric illness, and to approach levels of symptomatology found in general medical patients judged psychiatrically ill or in need of psychiatric treatment.\r"

Problem-focused coping decreased, emotion-focused coping increased, and satisfaction with social supports decreased over the year. In contrast, type A behavior and anger expression were more stable. Students distressed in September were at higher risk for distress in May. Students distressed in May were also characterized by higher scores for suppressed anger and type A behavior in May, even after controlling for distress in September.\r"

Using 14 criteria to assess the quality of experimental methodology, three studies were rated as high, 17 as medium, and 12 as low. Common methodological problems included the failure to use a control group or to specify the experience level of the therapist, overreliance on self-report outcome measures, and small sample sizes. Great variability was found among studies in inclusion criteria, treatment length, and length of follow-up. Thirty-eight percent of patients in group therapy and 41.5% of those in individual therapy were totally abstinent from bingeing and purging at follow-up. Although most studies used behavioral or cognitive-behavioral strategies, no modality of treatment has shown clear superiority. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for treatment, training, and future research.\r"

The interictal epileptic spike discharges were visually counted on the seizure-generating side and compared with those found in the contralateral hemisphere. The invasive recordings were made with depth electrodes implanted in the mesial temporal lobes of 5 patients, and with subdural strip electrodes in varying lateral positions over the frontotemporal-parietal lobes of the other 11 patients. The doses of 10% amobarbital, 50-200 mg, were too low to induce any significant activation. In eight patients with unilateral epileptic lesions, 10, 25 and 50 mg 1% methohexital, induced a dose-dependent increase in the interictal spiking, always higher on the side of the seizure-gererating focus. Asymmetric induction of beta activity was noted in five patients. The test gave valuable information when determining the type or location of the epileptic abnormality. Parallels were drawn with earlier studies on spike-activation tests after intracarotid amobarbital injections. Although administered differently, the barbiturates are supposed to act directly on the neurons, and not via integrative wakening mechanisms.\r"

The other six patients were in the secondary stage, where C. neoformans can be detected from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood, urine, faeces and other body sites. The main presenting features (headache, fever, nausea) were due to central nervous system involvement, although meningism and mental changes were rarely present, and CSF changes were very subtle. Treatment with amphotericin B and flucytosine was very effective, there being no more growth of fungi in cultures in most cases. Adverse reactions to the drugs used occurred frequently and consisted mainly of anaemia, hepatosis and fever. Diagnosis in the primary stage of cryptococcosis may improve the prognosis.\r"

All patients had calf hypertrophy and normal strength in gastrocnemius-soleus, whereas the quadriceps biopsied were all atrophied and weak. The patients' ages ranged from 4 to 11 years. The pathological and histochemical changes were assessed semi-quantitatively. Comparison of the gastrocnemius and quadriceps groups showed that the number of hypercontracted fibres, the degree of endomysial fibrosis and the degree of fat infiltration were significantly higher in the quadriceps. The fibre type differentiation was better in the gastrocnemius group. The mean fibre diameter was above normal in all gastrocnemius biopsies and showed no increase with age. In the quadriceps, fibre hypertrophy was found early in the disease but had changed into fibre atrophy in the three oldest patients. When present, fibre hypertrophy involved both fibre types. The amount of fat-fibrosis per unit area was increased in both groups, but more severely so in the quadriceps. These results indicate that there is no true muscle hypertrophy in the gastrocnemius, in which the fat-fibrosis component was increased in all patients and that the dystrophic process is more active in the quadriceps. The finding of persistent fibre hypertrophy in the gastrocnemius is discussed with respect to the postural abnormalities observed in the lower limbs in Duchenne dystrophy.\r"

The mean duration of the original headache (migraine or tension headache) was 25 years; regular intake of drugs and chronic daily headache had started 10 and 6 years prior to withdrawal therapy, respectively. Patients took an average of 34.6 tablets or analgesic suppositories or antimigraine drugs per week containing 5.8 different substances. The drugs most often used were caffeine (95%), ergotalkaloids (89%), barbiturates (64%), and spasmolytics, paracetamol, and pyrazolone derivates (45%-46%). A total of 103 patients (68 migraine, 35 tension or combination headache) were available for interviews at a mean time interval of 2.9 years after an inpatient drug withdrawal programme. Chronic headache had disappeared or was reduced by more than 50% in two-thirds of the patients. Positive predictors for successful treatment were migraine as primary headache, chronic headache lasting less than 10 years, and regular intake of ergotamine. Drug intake was significantly reduced and patients used single substances more often. Patients who originally suffered from migraine, superimposed on the daily headache, also experienced a significant improvement in the frequency of the migraines and their intensity. Migraine prophylaxis through beta-blocking agents and calcium channel antagonists was more efficient after drug-withdrawal therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Between 1962 and 1986, a total of 338 consecutive newly diagnosed children and adolescents with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs) were evaluated and treated at St Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH). Median follow-up is 6.6 years (range, 1.8 to 23 years). The patients ranged in age from 7 months to 21 years (median, 10 years), and 71% were males. All cases were staged (I to IV) by a clinical staging system. Eighteen percent were stage I, 21% stage II, 43% stage III, and 18% stage IV. Cases frankly leukemic at diagnosis (ie, greater than 25% marrow blasts) were excluded from the analysis. Pathologic material from all cases was reviewed and classified according to the Working Formulation. The histologic distribution of cases was as follows: 38.8% diffuse small non-cleaved cell (undifferentiated, Burkitt's and non-Burkitt's); 26.3% diffuse large-cell, mainly immunoblastic; 28.1% lymphoblastic; and 6.8% other. Treatment policy evolved over time to a stage- and histology-specific strategy for treatment assignment, and overall results significantly improved by era from 37% (+/- 5%) 2-year event-free survival (EFS) for patients treated before 1975 to 77% (+/- 4%) since 1978. By univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, the era of treatment (hence, the protocol-specific treatment itself), the stage, and the log of the initial serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) emerged as the most powerful prognostic indicators, while histology per se was not significantly related to outcome. For the 154 patients treated since 1978, the 2-year EFS by stage was 97% (+/- 3%) for stage I, 86% (+/- 6%) for stage II, 73% (+/- 6%) for stage III, and 47% (+/- 11%) for stage IV (P less than .0001). Compared with our previous experience, we conclude that the cure rate of childhood NHL has doubled in the last decade with modern management.\r"

  ".W": "Preliminary analyses of treatment results and prognostic factors from the first Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study (IRS I) suggested that alveolar histology and extremity site were among factors associated with an adverse outcome in clinical group I patients whose tumors had been completely resected. A high incidence of alveolar histology among the extremity tumors compounded the problem. These findings prompted an amendment to IRS II shortly after the study opened. Therapy for patients with alveolar extremity tumors in groups I and II was changed to more intensive repetitive pulse vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) for 2 years. The outcome of 44 patients who received intensive therapy on IRS II is compared with a control series of 30 patients who were treated on IRS I. The control patients received standard VAC therapy for 2 years or VA for 1 year. Half of group I control patients received local radiotherapy, whereas none was given to group I intensive therapy patients. In both studies group II patients received radiotherapy to the primary tumor site and to identified positive regional lymph nodes. Compared with the control group, patients given more intensive therapy had a longer disease-free survival (DFS) (69% v 43% at 3 years), but this was of marginal significance (P = .06). The overall survival difference (77% v 57% at 3 years) was not significant (P = .23). Despite the limited statistical evidence, there is some indication that intensive therapy improved the prognosis of children with localized alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS).\r"

RT was delivered to limited volumes in a dose dependent on the initial response to induction chemotherapy (30 to 35 Gy v 50 to 55 Gy). Fifty of the 52 patients achieved complete or partial responses with induction chemotherapy, with one nonresponding patient rendered free of tumor with surgery. Fifty patients were evaluable for local control of tumor and overall response to protocol therapy. Seventeen relapses have occurred; three metastatic, four local plus metastatic, and ten local. Two factors predicted worse disease-free survival: high WBC count (P = .03) and size of primary tumor (P = .05). Of the 14 local recurrences, 12 occurred in 28 patients who presented with primary tumors greater than 8 cm in size while only two of 22 patients with lesions less than 8 cm had local recurrence. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of disease-free survival at 3 years is 82% for those with small lesions and 64% for those with larger lesions. Site of primary was of no prognostic value (P = .27). The 5-year survival estimate for all patients is 80% (median time on study, 3.3 years).\r"

  ".W": "We prospectively studied the continuous function and complication rates of 286 central venous catheters consecutively placed in 264 children and young adults at a single institution over a 19-month period (median follow-up, 376 days). Externalized catheters (91 Hickman [H], 113 Broviac [B]) and implantable ports (n = 82) were compared for complications, including infection and thrombosis. The most frequent major complication of all catheters was infection, although the rates of infection varied with the duration of catheter use and were generally lower than reported by others. Overall, when catheter failures (removal) for infection, obstruction, or dislodgement were considered, ports had a significantly longer failure-free duration of use (P = .0024) than did externalized catheters. Likewise, ports had a significantly longer infection-free (P less than .01) duration of use than H and B catheters. However, differences in patient age and clinical characteristics among the three catheter groups may have affected the outcome. In analysis of pairs matched for diagnosis, therapy, and age, ports had lower infection rates than did B catheters after 100 days (P = .053). This difference became significant at 400 days of catheter use (P = .029). Although there was a trend toward lower rates of infections for ports v H catheters, this difference was not significant. In view of our results in matched pairs, selection of catheter type based on clinical characteristics and patient preferences remains a reasonable therapeutic approach despite the apparent advantages of ports. The superiority of ports for long-term use (greater than 100 days) needs to be confirmed in a large randomized clinical trial.\r"

Follow-up has been 120+ months or to death. Ninety-one percent had either suboptimal stage III or stage IV disease and 55% had grade 2 or 3 lesions. Two patients died of toxicity and were free of disease at autopsy. A third patient died of congestive heart failure with no disease at 103 months. Additionally, eight patients had a negative second-look laparotomy, and three (37.5%) are alive with no evidence of disease (NED) 133 to 144 months after diagnosis. Five patients (62.5%) died of disease 2 to 123 months after negative second-look. Patients with optimal stage III disease had a longer median progression-free interval (PFI) and survival (33.3 and 44.5 months, respectively) than those with suboptimal or stage IV disease (16.4 and 22.5 months, respectively), and the difference in median PFI is significant (P less than .02). Patients with ascites at diagnosis had a shorter median PFI and survival (14.7 and 18 months) than those without ascites (30.0 and 33.0 months). Both differences were significant (PFI, P less than .04; survival, P = .005). PAC produces response rates that are superior to those obtained historically with single-agent alkylating therapy. Late recurrences after negative second-look laparotomy suggest that 5-year survival data may be inadequate in ovarian carcinoma.\r"

One patient died from treatment-related toxicity. Other toxicities have been what one would expect from the individual treatment modalities except for a sensory sacral root neuropathy in 11 of 24 (46%) patients. Twenty-three of 24 (96%) patients achieved a complete response (CR) and the projected actuarial 2-year survival is 90%. Only one of the 23 complete responders has had an invasive local recurrence. The excellent complete local response and survival rates achieved warrant further study of the combination of intraarterial cisplatin and radiation as a bladder-preserving strategy.\r"

  ".U": "89125031\r", 
  ".W": "The optimal management for patients with stage II neuroblastoma has not yet been established. In order to determine the impact of adding chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy to surgery, we reviewed by questionnaire 156 patients with stage II neuroblastoma treated by 28 Childrens Cancer Study Group (CCSG) institutions from 1978 to 1985. Survival and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed by life-table methods with respect to age at diagnosis, site and size of primary tumor, spinal cord involvement, extent of initial resection, and treatment in addition to surgery. The overall 5-year survival was 96%; the PFS was 90%, similar to previous CCSG studies. Age at diagnosis had a small impact on PFS, with 92% PFS for patients less than 2 years of age at diagnosis, and 84% for those greater than 2 (P = .10). The only site with an adverse outcome was the head and neck (n = 11), with a PFS of 68% compared with 93% for the remaining sites (P = .02). Size of primary and intraspinal extension of primary did not affect PFS. The extent of resection and subsequent treatment with radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy did not affect the PFS. The outcome for 75 patients treated with surgery alone (6-year PFS, 89%) was not significantly different from that of 66 patients receiving radiation therapy (6-year PFS, 94%). There was no significant difference between 40 patients with gross or microscopic residual disease treated with surgery alone (PFS, 92%) and 59 patients with residual disease who also received radiation (PFS, 90%). Five of seven patients who progressed after surgery alone have been salvaged with further therapy and are now free of disease. One survives with disease, so that the 6-year survival is 98% for those treated initially with surgery alone, compared with 95% for those receiving radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy. These data suggest that surgery alone, even if complete resection is not achieved, is sufficient initial therapy for stage II neuroblastoma. The data also identify another stage of neuroblastoma, in addition to stage IV-S, for which almost all patients have a favorable prognosis because their tumor may be biologically limited in growth.\r"

We hypothesized that concurrent intraperitoneal administration of both drugs would result in high peritoneal concentrations with much lower plasma concentrations, permitting a selective increase in the activity of methotrexate against intraperitoneal tumors without enhancing systemic toxicity. Initially, 2.16 mg/m2/d methotrexate and 12 mg/m2/d dipyridamole were delivered together as a constant intraperitoneal infusion for 48 hours. With escalation of chemotherapy, eventually 4.32 mg/m2/d methotrexate was administered for 168 hours. Forty-seven courses were administered to 18 patients. The mean peritoneal to plasma concentration ratios of methotrexate and non-protein bound dipyridamole were 71.6 +/- 34.8 and over 2,300, respectively. Chemical peritonitis was the dose-limiting toxicity. Three patients had some evidence of a response (two with decreasing tumor markers, and the third with a reduction in ascites). We conclude that the drug concentrations are in an appropriate range for selective intraperitoneal biochemical modulation of methotrexate, and that it is feasible to expose tumors confined to the peritoneal cavity to these drugs for long periods of time.\r"

Patients were randomized to receive either a two- or 24-hour infusion in the first course of treatment and the reverse in the second course. Cisplatin renal clearance, total clearance, and the percentage of the dose excreted unchanged in urine were significantly lower with the longer infusion. Total clearance was 345 +/- 97.0 mL/min/m2 after the two-hour infusion and 268 +/- 70.7 mL/min/m2 after the 24-hour infusion (P less than .0001). Renal clearance was 79.1 +/- 35.3 mL/min/m2 and 34.1 +/- 14.9 mL/min/m2 (P less than .0001). The percentage of the dose excreted unchanged in urine was 22.9 +/- 6.5% and 12.8 +/- 4.0%, respectively (P less than .0001). The ratio of cisplatin renal clearance to creatinine clearance was 1.95 +/- .96 after the two-hour infusion and .90 +/- .40 after the 24-hour infusion (P less than .001). There was only a poor relationship between cisplatin renal clearance and creatinine clearance after a two-hour infusion (r2 = .05, P greater than .1) or 24-hour infusion (r2 = .18, P greater than .05). The severity of emesis was graded on a four-point scale and was significantly less with the 24-hour infusion than with the two-hour infusion (P less than .05). Twenty-four-hour infusion of cisplatin resulted in greater drug retention in patients due to reduced renal clearance, but was also associated with reduced emetic toxicity, probably as a result of lower peak plasma levels.\r"

The authors report five patients with dural AV fistulas who presented in this manner, and who improved substantially after embolic and surgical therapy. The outcome of these patients indicates that acute and subacute progression of myelopathy in cases of spinal dural AV fistulas may be caused by venous congestion and not necessarily by thrombosis. Therefore, a clinical diagnosis of Foix-Alajouanine syndrome is of little practical use, as spinal cord dysfunction from venous congestion is a potentially reversible process whereas thrombotic infarction is not. This diagnosis may result in suboptimal management. The recognition of nonhemorrhagic acute or subacute myelopathy as a complication of a spinal dural AV fistula is important since what appears to be irreversible cord injury is often treatable by standard surgical techniques.\r"
