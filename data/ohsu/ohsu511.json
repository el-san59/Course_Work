  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To investigate the predictive value of assays for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) p24 antigen, p24 antibody, and gp120 antibody compared with T4 cell counts. DESIGN: Prospective cohort selected from persons who had HIV-antibody seroconversion. PATIENTS: Eighty-seven persons with hemophilia with an actuarial cumulative acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) incidence of 26% (CI, 12% to 40%), 8 years after HIV-antibody seroconversion. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Human immunodeficiency virus p24 antigen was detected in 8 of 74 (11%) of the patients without AIDS and 7 of 13 (54%) of the patients with AIDS. The 2-year actuarial incidence of AIDS was 24% (CI, 0% to 48%) after detection of p24 antigen, 16% (CI, 0% to 34%) after loss of p24 antibody, 20% (CI, 0% to 45%) after loss of gp120 antibody, 31% (CI, 15% to 47%) after a T4 count of less than 200 cells/microL, and 67% (CI, 31% to 100%) after a T4 count of less than 200 cells/microL among those patients positive for p24 antigen. Very low numbers of T4 and T8 lymphocytes, presence of p24 antigen in serum, and absence of p24 antibody all had some predictive value. However, only p24 antigen (relative hazard 6.0, P = 0.008) and T4 counts (relative hazard 5.3, P = 0.002 with T4 count less than 200 cells/microL) independently predicted AIDS up to 12 months before diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Strong predictors of AIDS are p24 antigenemia or low T4 counts. Detection of p24 antigen is highly specific and complementary to the greater sensitivity of low T4 counts. These findings have important implications regarding prognosis, counseling, and the planning of clinical trials.\r"

Control IgG was obtained from patients with other neurological disorders or healthy individuals. Inhibition of Ca2+ flux by LEMS IgG was time and dose dependent. The flux was significantly reduced in MAR10 cells grown in either SCLC-LEMS IgG (0.38 nmol/10(6) cells; p less than 0.001) or non-SCLC-LEMS IgG (0.35 nmol/10(6) cells; p less than 0.001), compared with that in MAR10 cells grown in control IgG (0.7 nmol/10(6) cells). Similar significant reductions were also observed in PC12 cells. The reduction in amplitude of the resting compound muscle action potential in the LEMS patients correlated positively (r = 0.70; p = 0.007) with the inhibition of Ca2+ flux in MAR10 cells by their IgG. These results strongly support the view that IgG autoantibodies that can inhibit Ca2+ flux in SCLC cells are responsible for the disorder of transmitter release at motor nerves in SCLC-associated LEMS.\r"

  ".W": "Early fibrinolytic therapy with full molecular tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) has been observed to be both angiographically and clinically effective when employed in animal stroke models. Preliminary clinical trials with t-PA are in progress. It is possible to refine t-PA by developing fragments or analogues of the drug. Using recombinant DNA technology in the Escherichia coli system, a t-PA analogue consisting of the catalytic fragment of t-PA and a dimer of the B fragment of staphylococcal protein A (Fb-Fb-CF) has been produced. Because this analogue has a long serum half-life of 90 minutes, we employed Fb-Fb-CF in a rabbit cerebral embolic stroke model to assess its efficacy as a reperfusion agent. When given as a bolus to 10 animals 15 minutes after embolization, Fb-Fb-CF produced angiographic cerebral reperfusion in 48 +/- 21 minutes (+/- SD), while in 8 saline-treated controls, reperfusion was not observed at 180 minutes in any animal (p less than 0.01). In another experiment reperfusion was demonstrated at 66 +/- 32 minutes in 11 animals treated with Fb-Fb-CF 90 minutes after embolization as compared with 100 +/- 25 minutes in 12 saline-treated controls (p less than 0.01). A small macroscopic hemorrhage within an infarct was seen in 1 Fb-Fb-CF-treated animal in the 15-minute experiment and in none of the controls. In the 90-minute experiment, macroscopic hemorrhagic infarction was seen in 4 Fb-Fb-CF-treated animals and in 3 controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The elfamycins tested were kirromycin, aurodox, efrotomycin, phenelfamycin A, unphenelfamycin, and L-681,217. The last three lack the pyridone ring present in the other elfamycins. All the elfamycins inhibited poly(U)-dependent poly(Phe) synthesis and stimulated EF-Tu-associated GTPase activity, suggesting that the pyridone ring is not essential for activity. The six elfamycins were also examined in a poly(U)-directed, poly(Phe)-synthesizing system derived from Staphylococcus aureus and had 50% inhibitory concentrations of greater than or equal to 1 mM. When S. aureus ribosomes and E. coli elongation factors were combined in a hybrid poly(Phe)-synthesizing system, aurodox produced essentially complete inhibition of poly(Phe) synthesis with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.13 microM. This suggests that the observed high MICs of kirromycin and its congeners in S. aureus reflect a kirromycin-resistant EF-Tu rather than permeability constraints.\r"

  ".U": "89271780\r", 
  ".W": "The pharmacokinetics of fleroxacin, including the formation of N-demethyl and N-oxide fleroxacin after the administration of single intravenous (100-mg) and oral (400-mg) doses, was investigated in 26 subjects with various levels of renal function, including 7 patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Fleroxacin was well tolerated by all subjects. The volume of distribution, systemic availability, and peak concentration after the administration of oral fleroxacin were independent of the glomerular filtration rate. As a consequence of a declining renal clearance but not nonrenal clearance, the total body clearance of fleroxacin declined with decreasing glomerular filtration rate from 1.41 +/- 0.23 ml/min per kg in subjects with normal renal function to 0.58 +/- 0.13 ml/min per kg in patients with end-stage renal disease (r = 0.84, P less than 0.001). The analysis revealed that the N-oxide metabolite exhibited formation-limited kinetics and the N-demethyl metabolite exhibited elimination-limited kinetics. The areas under the curve of both metabolites increased with declining renal function. In patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis the mean dialysate/plasma concentration ratio of fleroxacin increased from 0.52 +/- 0.11 to 0.71 +/- 0.13 (P less than 0.001) with increasing dwell time, resulting in a 7.8 +/- 3.6% recovery of unchanged fleroxacin in peritoneal dialysate. In conclusion, (i) a 50% reduction of the maintenance dose is recommended in patients with a renal function below 20 to 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2, and (ii) therapeutic concentrations of fleroxacin in the peritoneal dialysate should be achievable after oral administration in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.\r"

We studied the in vitro activities of these drugs, alone and in combination, by time-kill techniques against 21 clinical isolates of Enterococcus (Streptococcus) faecalis demonstrating high-level resistance to gentamicin. Combinations of fosfomycin and daptomycin exhibited synergistic bactericidal activity (100-fold decrease in CFU per milliliter at 24 h compared with daptomycin alone) against all strains (mean +/- standard deviation of increment in killing = 2.7 +/- 0.7 log10 CFU/ml). In a subgroup of strains against which daptomycin (5 micrograms/ml) alone was bactericidal (greater than 3 log10 killing), synergistic activity was demonstrable only when the concentration of daptomycin was lowered to 0.25 to 0.5 microgram/ml. A 50% dilution of human serum diminished the bactericidal activity of daptomycin alone at 24 h but did not affect killing observed with the daptomycin-fosfomycin combination. The inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis by the combination was greater than the inhibition observed with either drug alone. The combination of daptomycin and fosfomycin exhibited consistent synergistic bactericidal activity against strains of E. faecalis possessing high-level resistance to gentamicin. This synergism may be the result of sequential inhibition of early steps in peptidoglycan synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred clinical isolates resistant to ceftazidime and/or cefotaxime were examined for susceptibility to cefepime. The most frequently encountered ceftazidime-cefotaxime-resistant strains belonged to the genera Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, and Citrobacter. Among these strains, 92% were resistant to cefoperazone, 91% were resistant to cefotaxime, 84% were resistant to ceftazidime, and 6% were resistant to cefepime. Of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, 57% were resistant to ceftriaxone. The six strains resistant to cefepime were all Pseudomonas aeruginosa and were resistant to both cefotaxime and ceftazidime. Cefepime-resistant P. aeruginosa strains had exceptionally high levels of beta-lactamase activity, higher than the levels found in strains resistant to ceftazidime but susceptible to cefepime. The beta-lactamases from the cefepime-resistant strains were type I (Richmond-Sykes), were constitutively produced, and did not have increased affinity or hydrolytic activity for cefepime. Thus, cefepime was active against most gram-negative bacteria which have developed resistance to the broad-spectrum cephalosporins, and resistance to cefepime in P. aeruginosa appears to be associated with higher beta-lactamase levels than in cefepime-susceptible strains.\r"

These antimicrobial agents were equally effective in clearing bacteremia, reducing bacterial counts in vegetations and tissues, and curing endocarditis. However, resistance to fleroxacin at fivefold the MIC arose in the test strain of S. aureus in 8% of animals that received the drug. We conclude that fleroxacin is as efficacious as vancomycin in this model of a serious systemic S. aureus infection, but modest resistance to fleroxacin may develop during therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin B resistance in staphylococci can result from a gene, ermA, that comprises part of transposon Tn554. Tn554 is unusual in (i) its high specificity for a primary chromosomal attachment site, att554, and (ii) the variability of its 3'-terminal six or seven nucleotides, which appear to copy the six or seven chromosomal nucleotides 5' to the parent transposon during transposition. We characterized a novel Tn554 insert in the chromosomes of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains involved in a current outbreak. This insert was found to resemble an insert recently discovered in S. epidermidis in its junctional fragment restriction pattern. Sequence analysis of the junctional regions showed that the attachment site, att155, exhibited 78% similarity to att554 (39 of the 50 nucleotides flanking the insertion sites) for both S. aureus and S. epidermidis inserts and that the 3' hexanucleotide of the S. epidermidis transposon (GACATC) resembled the reverse complement (TACATC) of its commonly occurring S. aureus counterpart (GATGTA). Epidemiologic and molecular data indicated that att155 is harbored by extra DNA characteristic of methicillin-resistant strains and absent from methicillin-susceptible ones. Further, Southern hybridization showed that, even in the absence of Tn554 inserts, some methicillin-resistant strains contain DNA related to att155 and Tn554.\r"

The 13 patients in group 1 received 0.68 mmol/kg/day of calcium and 0.61 mmol/kg/day of phosphorus, and the 14 in group 2 received 1.25 and 1.20 mmol/kg/day, respectively. The two groups did not differ significantly in the severity of their illness measured by birth weight, gestational age, duration of parenteral nutrition or ventilation, or the amount of supplementary oxygen required. In patients in group 2 the median plasma phosphate concentration was higher, the plasma alkaline phosphatase activity was lower, and there was less radiological evidence of rickets. There were no complications caused by excess calcium and phosphorus, and the rate of growth was similar in both groups. We conclude that an increased mineral content in parenteral nutrition solutions reduces the severity of metabolic bone disease in sick infants who require this form of nutrition.\r"

To investigate the effects of HS on the hormonal response to injury, we measured ACTH, cortisol, angiotensin II (AII), aldosterone, vasopressin (AVP), and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) in these patients. ACTH and cortisol concentrations increased in the NS group but were suppressed in the HS group (p less than 0.05). Aldosterone increased in NS patients, but was suppressed in HS patients (HS: delta Aldosterone 13.0 +/- 3.0 vs. NS: delta Aldosterone 26.0 +/- 7.0 ng/dl, p less than 0.05). The AII response was suppressed at six and eight hours (p less than 0.05) in patients receiving HS but did not change in patients receiving NS. ANF did not change significantly for either group. The significant increases in AVP were similar in both groups (p less than 0.05), but correlated with increases in osmolality only in the NS group (r = 0.8, p less than 0.009). Other than AVP, HS suppressed the responses of some of the hormones that normally increase in response to injury, relative to NS. Attenuation of the neuroendocrine response and other previously reported effects of HS suggest that HS may be an efficacious solution for resuscitation in the postoperative and postinjury period.\r"

We analyzed hospital resource consumption for 1,567 cardiothoracic surgical patients by outcome (ie, survivors versus nonsurvivors). The 76 patients who died had a much greater intensity of hospital resource utilization and represented a substantial financial risk under DRG pricing schemes compared with the 1,491 survivors. Only patients who died within 1 week of admission to the hospital generated a financial surplus under DRGs. A long hospital stay for nonsurvivors produced a substantial deficit (patients with a stay greater than 60 days generated a $154,433 loss per patient). The cardiothoracic patients admitted on an emergency basis who died tended to have a shorter length of stay and represented a lower financial risk under DRGs compared with patients admitted on a nonemergency basis who died. Among nonsurvivors, patients referred for cardiothoracic surgical procedures from other clinical services had lower resource utilization and financial risk under DRGs compared with nonreferrals. These data suggest significant inequities in the current DRG prospective payment system vis-a-vis cardiothoracic surgical patients who die. Variables predictive of greater hospital resource utilization by outcome included a longer hospital stay, nonemergency admission, and admission directly to the cardiothoracic surgical service. Methods to improve the equity of DRG payment vis-a-vis cardiothoracic surgical nonsurvivors should be implemented in the future.\r"

Preoperative electrocardiographic findings included elevated ST segments in chest leads during attacks of angina, and all patients had severe fixed lesions in addition to marked spasm of the left anterior descending coronary artery after the administration of ergonovine maleate. Postoperatively with ergonovine stimulation, complete occlusion or marked subtotal narrowing was again observed at the primary fixed lesion in the proximal portion of the left anterior descending coronary artery, but the IMA graft and the coronary artery distal to the anastomotic site maintained satisfactory patency with no further occurrence of anginal pain or ST segment elevation. By computer-assisted graphic analysis, which allows highly reproducible measurements of vascular internal diameters, the diameter of the IMA showed only small changes under ergonovine (p = not significant) or nitroglycerin (p less than 0.05) stimulation in contrast to the marked vascular reactivity of the coronary artery (p less than 0.05 and less than 0.01, respectively). These findings indicate that the IMA graft is unresponsive to ergonovine at least in the amount required to produce coronary artery spasm in patients with variant angina and fixed lesions. The IMA graft appears to function well from a clinical and pharmacological viewpoint in patients with variant angina.\r"

Comparisons were made between decisions made by the elderly participants and predictions of those decisions by potential proxies, including the participant's closest relative and a nurse, a social worker, and a physician in the facility. There was a low rate of agreement between decisions made by the elderly participant and the decisions the potential proxies thought they would make. The highest agreement was found between the participants' actual decision and the decision predicted by their relatives. The lowest agreement occurred between what the physician thought the participant would choose for the two high-risk vignettes and what the participant actually chose. The quality of the elderly participant's decisions was also rated on a four-point scale by the potential proxy, as well as by a researcher. Highest ratings of the quality of the elderly person's decision-making ability were assigned by the relative. A significant negative correlation was obtained between the elderly person's age and the decision-making rating assigned by the physician, and significant positive correlations were obtained between mental status and decision-making ratings by the other raters. These data have important implications for designing and implementing strategies to maximize the ability of elderly people in long-term care settings to participate in decisions about their health care.\r"

The majority had a life- or limb-threatening hemorrhage for which other modalities had not been successful. In 32 of 45 episodes, a good to excellent response was obtained. Adverse reactions were minimal, occurring in 17 treatment episodes, and were mostly treated with antihistamines and/or hydrocortisone. No clear predictor of clinical response to porcine factor VIII concentrate was identified, including pretreatment human and porcine inhibitor levels, percentage of cross-reactivity between the human and porcine antibodies, and the presence of measurable levels of factor VIII after the porcine factor concentrate was given. Anamnesis to porcine factor VIII did occur in some instances. Porcine factor VIII is a valuable modality in the treatment of serious hemorrhages in patients with inhibitors to factor VIII. Its use should be considered early in the course of severe hemorrhage in these patients.\r"

Seven subjects with simple phobia of small animals were studied to permit the generation of wide ranges of anxiety. Each subject received five positron emission tomography (PET) scans in a rest-fear-rest-fear-rest, repeated-measures paradigm. A population of eight normal controls was employed. The phobic stimuli produced significant increases in state anxiety during fear and significant differences in physiologic measurements between the fear and rest scans. Absolute global and regional CBF was significantly lower during fear scans than during rest scans; however, when hypocapnia resulting from anxiety-induced hyperventilation was taken into account, the pattern vanished, and all global and regional CBF differences among scans became not significant. Resting global and regional CBF values in the phobic subjects did not significantly differ from those of the normal controls. That a relationship between anxiety and CBF was not found in 35 scans among seven subjects strongly suggests that CBF changes induced by state anxiety are either not presently measurable by PET techniques or that such a relationship may not exist. These findings should also reduce concerns that subject anxiety may confound CBF measurements during routine PET scanning.\r"

Each patient was studied under three conditions: relaxation, imaginal flooding, and in vivo (actual) exposure to the phobic stimulus. Subjective anxiety, obsessive-compulsive ratings, and autonomic measures (heart rate, blood pressure) increased significantly, but respiratory rate and PCO2 did not change across the three conditions. Regional cerebral blood flow increased slightly (in the temporal region) during imaginal flooding, but decreased markedly in several cortical regions during in vivo exposure, when anxiety was highest by subjective and peripheral autonomic measures. These results demonstrate that intense anxiety can be associated with decreased rather than increased cortical perfusion and that ostensibly related states of anxiety (eg, anticipatory and obsessional anxiety) may be associated with opposite effects on regional cerebral blood flow.\r"

The tat gene product induces LTR-linked gene expression approximately 1000-fold in this system. The high level of expression of beta-galactosidase under HIV tat and LTR control in stable cell lines allows rapid spectrophotometric quantitation of beta-galactosidase enzymatic activity from fewer than 5000 cells seeded in a microtiter plate well. Such cell lines provide a virus-free system for the high-capacity screening of compounds for the ability to interfere with HIV tat-mediated transactivation of gene expression.\r"

  ".W": "Exogenous insulin exists primarily as the monomer in human plasma. However, in U100 regular insulin formulations, the concentrations of zinc and peptide are such that the insulin hexamer predominates. The biologic result is further disassociation to the monomer after subcutaneous or i.v. administration. Because of this, human plasma from seven normal controls dissolved 20-30 microm hexagonal insulin crystals in 3-8 min. This ability was inhibited by acid titration to a stable pH of 6.30, at which point bicarbonate depletion could be suggested. Repletion of bicarbonate remarkably restored the solvent effect, while back-titration to the initial pH without repleting bicarbonate had only a moderate result. To establish whether the in vivo reduction of bicarbonate in pathologic states had similar results, plasma from five Type I diabetics in severe acidosis (pH 7.06 +/- 0.04, HCO3 -7.3 +/- 0.6 mmol/l) was similarly studied after stabilization under 5% CO2 (pH, 6.97-7.17). In all cases, the dissolution of insulin crystals was inhibited (dissolution times greater than 25 min). When bicarbonate was replenished (HCO3- 24.1-26.7 mmol/l) and pH accordingly renormalized (pH 7.39-7.43), the dissolution of insulin crystals was completely restored. Because of these observations, we conclude that both plasma bicarbonate and pH markedly affect the dissolution of insulin and that reduced bicarbonate/pH in diabetic ketoacidosis may limit the availability of the biologically active monomer. These influences may play a role in the initial insensitivity to insulin frequently seen in severe insulin deficiency and ketoacidosis.\r"

  ".W": "Extracorporeal techniques for respiratory support in the newborn are feasible, as the growth of neonatal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has demonstrated. It has been shown, however, that even in severely damaged lungs, sufficient oxygenation and gas exchange can be maintained only by removing CO2 in an extracorporeal circuit, i.e., extracorporeal CO2 removal (ECCO2R). To demonstrate the effectiveness of CO2 removal in a bicarbonate-free hemodialysis procedure, CO2 removal was measured during routine acetate hemodialysis in 22 patients on renal replacement therapy for end-stage renal disease. By comparison of predialyzer and postdialyzer total CO2, an overall CO2 removal of 79.1 +/- 15.1 ml/min was measured in the blood and 77.0 +/- 19.5 ml/min in the dialysate; this was approximately one third of the entire metabolic CO2 production and probably accounted for the secondary hypoxia during acetate hemodialysis. To use bicarbonate-free hemodialysis for total metabolic CO2 removal, acetate dialysate was modified with lactate, phosphate buffer, and sodium hydroxide to compensate for the bicarbonate loss. In sheep, apneic oxygenation could be achieved with blood flow rates as low as 10-15 ml/kg/min for 4-6 hours. These preliminary data suggest that a hemodialysis procedure for bicarbonate and CO2 elimination (ECBicCO2R) could be an efficient method for CO2 removal requiring much lower blood flow rates than techniques presently in use.\r"

By cloning chromosomal breakpoints one can identify activated proto-oncogenes. We have studied a case of B-lineage acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) that was associated with peripheral blood eosinophilia. The chromosomal translocation t(5;14) (q31;q32) from this sample was cloned and studied at the molecular level. This translocation joined the immunoglobulin heavy chain joining (Jh) region to the promotor region of the interleukin-3 (IL-3) gene in opposite transcriptional orientations. The data suggest that activation of the IL-3 gene by the enhancer of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene may play a central role in the pathogenesis of this leukemia and the associated eosinophilia.\r"

  ".W": "We have purified the factor VIII from a CRM+ Hemophilia A plasma (90 U/dL VIII:Ag but 0 U/dL VIII:C) and analyzed the protein before and after thrombin activation by Western blotting with monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs). Normal or patient citrated plasma was ultracentrifuged, cryo-ethanol-precipitated and chromatographed on Sepharose 6B. The void volume fractions were reduced and subjected to ion exchange chromatography yielding material of specific activity approximately 1,000 U/mg protein (VIII:C or VIII:Ag). Factor VIII purified in this way from normal plasma is fully activatable by thrombin with proteolytic fragmentation as previously described by F. Rotblat et al (Biochemistry 24: 4294, 1985). Factor VIII 1,689-Cys has the normal distribution of factor VIII light and heavy chains prior to thrombin activation. After exposure to thrombin the heavy chain polypeptides were fully proteolysed but the light chain was totally resistant to cleavage. This is consistent with the demonstration in the patient's leucocyte DNA of a C to T transition in codon 1,689 converting Arg to Cys at the light chain thrombin cleavage site as previously described by J. Gitschier et al (Blood 72:1022, 1988). Uncleaved light chain of Factor VIII 1,689-Cys is not released from von Willebrand factor (vWF) by thrombin, but this is not the sole cause of the functional defect since the protein purified free of vWF has no coagulant activity. We conclude that the functional defect in factor VIII 1,689-Cys is a consequence of failure to release the acidic peptide from the light chain upon thrombin activation.\r"

  ".W": "During the development of functional T lymphocytes, a variety of genes involved in antigen recognition undergo somatic rearrangement. These include the alpha, beta, and gamma chain genes. Recently a fourth rearranging gene, the delta chain gene, embedded in the alpha chain locus, has been described. We have determined the structure of the beta, gamma, and delta chain genes in 15 cases of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) representing stage I (CD7+, CD1-, CD3-) and stage II (CD7+, CD1+, CD3-) of intrathymic T-cell development. The alpha-delta locus was rearranged in 14 of the 15 cases. In three cases the delta constant region was deleted on both chromosomes, suggesting biallelic V-J alpha rearrangement. A limited pattern of rearrangement of the delta locus was observed in the remaining 11 cases. When the alpha-delta region was rearranged, there was rearrangement of the beta and gamma TcR in all cases except two; in these cases the beta chain was in the germline configuration. These findings support the hypothesis that delta chain gene rearrangement is an early event in T-cell development, possibly contemporary to gamma gene rearrangement, and that the delta locus has a limited repertoire.\r"

  ".W": "We report the molecular, cytogenetic, and immunologic characterization of three hematologic malignancies that contained characteristic t(2;5) chromosomal translocations. The clinicopathologic features in all three cases fit the disease spectrum of so-called malignant histiocytosis (MH). All cases expressed activation antigens including Ki-1 (CD 30), but no lineage-restricted pattern of cellular antigen expression was observed. Cell lines SUP-M2 and SU-DHL-1 established from two of the cases showed rearranged beta T-cell receptor (beta TCR) genes nonproductive of full-length beta TCR mRNA and therefore not helpful in unequivocal establishment of lineage derivation. The common cytogenetic feature was a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 2 and 5, involving bands 2p23 and 5q35 near the reported chromosomal locations of the N-myc and c-fms genes, respectively. Normal-sized and truncated c-fms RNAs were observed in both cell lines, whereas no N-myc transcripts were detected. Sequence analysis of the truncated fms RNA showed that it consisted of the 3' half of the c-fms mRNA, but its derivation was not the result of a structural alteration of the c-fms gene. Our studies show that the t(2;5) does not involve the N-myc and c-fms protooncogenes and that this cytogenetic abnormality may be characteristic of a subset of primitive malignancies with an indeterminate lineage but with clinicopathologic features of so-called MH.\r"

Short as against long consultations resulted in less attention being given to psychosocial issues that the doctor recognised as relevant. When psychosocial problems were dealt with prescribing of antibiotics decreased. In this volunteer sample of doctors the process of care seemed to reflect decisions as to how time was allocated rather than inherently different patterns of clinical behavior. Organisational and contractual changes will shift the mix of financial and professional incentives for general practitioners in ways that could lead to doctors reallocating their time toward shorter consultations; such a reallocation could have important implications for patient care.\r"

DESIGN--Two methods: a quantitative survey using personal interviews based on a questionnaire and a qualitative survey based on group discussions. SETTING--Interviews based on the questionnaire were conducted in the respondents' homes. The group discussions were held in the homes of professional market research interviewers. PARTICIPANTS--For the quantitative survey a representative sample of 976 Scottish adults was selected by multistage sampling. In the qualitative survey 16 groups of five to eight respondents assigned according to donating experience and sociodemographic criteria took part. MAIN RESULTS--AIDS was not mentioned as a discouraging factor in donation, and off putting aspects identified before AIDS became a public issue remained salient--for example, fear of needles. Many (75%) thought it unlikely that donation entailed a risk of developing AIDS. Nevertheless, respondents were reluctant to consider the AIDS issue personally. Being asked to do so, as in the routine screening of donors, aroused fears and resentment. CONCLUSIONS--The issue of AIDS, including fear of infection, has not directly influenced the declining numbers of donors, but the unpleasant associations of AIDS have had an indirect effect, particularly in undermining the emotional benefits of giving blood. For example, the screening process, which requires potential donors to consider their personal risk from AIDS, had had the effect of discouraging donors in general. Redressing the balance is difficult as screening must be universally applied. Rather than minimising the issue of AIDS, publicity needs urgently to reassert the positive benefits of and rewards from giving blood.\r"

The treatment strategy comprised brief intermittent courses of neuroleptic agents begun as soon as non-psychotic symptoms believed to be early signs of relapse appeared. Fifty four stable, remitted outpatients meeting the American Psychiatric Association's DSM-III criteria for schizophrenia were randomised double blind to receive brief intermittent treatment with either active or placebo depot neuroleptic injections. Only three patients given placebo injections and two controls were admitted to hospital during one year of follow up. Eight (30%) of the patients given placebo injections and only 2 (7%) of the controls, however, had a recurrence of schizophrenic symptoms. Patients given placebo injections experienced fewer extrapyramidal side effects and showed a trend towards a reduction in tardive dyskinesia. Dysphoric and neurotic symptoms were identified before eight out of 11 relapses, and these symptoms were more frequent in patients given placebo depot injections. These results suggest a viable but not necessarily better alternative to continuous oral or depot treatment for less ill, chronic, stabilised schizophrenics based on the early treatment of putative prodromal symptoms of relapse.\r"

DESIGN--Descriptive study of a cohort of patients consecutively entered on a community stroke register. SETTING--Community based research project. PATIENTS--A total of 128 patients who had suffered first ever stroke. INTERVENTIONS AND END POINTS--Patients were interviewed by a psychiatrist at 1, 6, and 12 months after stroke. Mood state was assessed by standardised semistructured interview (present state examination) and self report (Beck depression inventory). Intellectual impairment was assessed by mini mental state examination and Frenchay aphasia screening test. In addition, stroke lesions were localised by computed tomography.

Patients with emotionalism had higher scores on both measures of mood disorder (at 6 months: mean Beck score 10.5 v 6.4; present state examination score 7.2 v 5.1) and more diagnosable psychiatric disorder (at 6 months: 40% v 14%; odds ratio 4.2, 95% confidence interval 1.5 to 11.9). Almost all episodes were provoked by clearly identified and appropriate emotional experiences. Patients with emotionalism also had more intellectual impairment and larger lesions on computed tomography. Lesions in the left frontal and temporal regions were particularly associated with emotionalism: at 6 months 8 of 14 patients (57%) with such lesions had emotionalism compared with 10 of 52 (19%) of those with lesions elsewhere (odds ratio 5.6, 95% confidence interval 1.4 to 22). CONCLUSIONS--Emotionalism is common after stroke. It is neither emotionally meaningless and inappropriate, nor is it found mostly in patients with bilateral brain damage. Emotionalism is associated with symptoms of a more general mood disturbance and is found especially in patients with left frontal and temporal lesions.\r"

SETTING--Finland divided into three zones according to amount of radioactive fallout. SUBJECTS--All children who were exposed to radiation during their fetal development. Children born before any effects of the accident could be postulated--that is, between 1 January 1984 and 30 June 1986--served as controls. INTERVENTIONS--Children were divided into three temporal groups: controls, children who were expected to be born in August to December 1986, and children who were expected to be born in February to December 1987. They were also divided, separately, into three groups according to the three geographic zones. END POINT--Incidence of congenital malformations, preterm births, and perinatal deaths. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--There were no significant differences in the incidence of malformations or perinatal deaths among the three temporal and three geographic groups. A significant increase in preterm births occurred among children who were exposed to radiation during the first trimester whose mothers lived in zones 2 and 3, where the external dose rate and estimated surface activity of caesium-137 were highest. CONCLUSIONS--The results suggest that the amount of radioactive fallout that Finnish people were exposed to after the accident at Chernobyl was not high enough to cause fetal damage in children born at term. The higher incidence of premature births among malformed children in the most heavily polluted areas, however, remains unexplained.\r"

DESIGN--Men recruited for the British regional heart study followed up for a mean of 7.5 years. SETTING--General practices in 24 British towns. PATIENTS--7735 Middle aged men. END POINT--Predictive value of serum concentrations of lipids. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--At initial screening serum concentrations of total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides were determined from non-fasting blood samples. Altogether 443 major ischaemic heart disease events (fatal and non-fatal) occurred during the study. Men in the highest fifth of the distribution of total cholesterol concentration (greater than or equal to 7.2 mmol/l) had 3.5 times the risk of ischaemic heart disease than did men in the lowest fifth (less than 5.5 mmol/l) after adjustment for high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration and other risk factors. Men in the lowest fifth of high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration (less than 0.93 mmol/l) had 2.0 times the risk of men in the highest fifth (greater than or equal to 1.33 mmol/l) after adjustment for total cholesterol concentration and other risk factors. Men in the highest fifth of triglyceride concentration (greater than or equal to 2.8 mmol/l) had only 1.3 times the risk of those in the lowest fifth (less than 1.08 mmol/l) after adjustment for total cholesterol concentration and other risk factors; additional adjustment for high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration made the association with ischaemic heart disease disappear. CONCLUSIONS--Serum concentration of total cholesterol is the most important single blood lipid risk factor for ischaemic heart disease in men. High density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration is less important, and triglyceride concentrations do not have predictive importance once other risk factors have been taken into account.\r"

In one patient two drugs were necessary (clonazepam and piracetam); in the others more than two drugs were required. The combination of sodium valproate, clonazepam and primidone (3 patients), or piracetam, clonazepam and primidone (3 patients), or the four drugs together (3 patients) was necessary to provide substantial relief of myoclonus. Such polytherapy generally was tolerated well.

Patients were randomized to either CPN or PPN plus enteral nutrition (EN: intense nutrition counseling, oral foods, and supplements) for 4 weeks followed by EN until week 10. Oncologic treatment was similar for each tumor type. Dietary, anthropometric, and biochemical measurements were obtained at weeks 0, 4, and 10. During weeks 1 through 4, energy (CPN: means 100 +/- 4; PPN: means 96 +/- 4% of healthy children) and protein (CPN: means 2.5 +/- 0.1; PPN means 2.7 +/- 0.2 g/kg) intakes of the two groups did not differ. The AMA increased (P less than 0.05) with 4 weeks of CPN but not with PPN; changes thereafter with EN were not significant. Weight (P less than 0.05) and triceps skinfolds (P less than 0.01) increased with 4 weeks of PN in both groups and decreased with EN thereafter (P less than 0.01) but were higher at week 10 than diagnosis. Increases in albumin in both groups reached significance at week 10 (P less than 0.05). These data show that CPN improves AMA in malnourished children with neuroblastoma or Wilms' tumor when energy and protein intakes are adequate. The AMA gains can be maintained thereafter with EN.\r"

  ".W": "To treat six patients with peritoneal recurrence after radical operation for gastrointestinal cancer, an intraperitoneal hyperthermic perfusion (IPHP), combined with surgical resection of recurrent tumors, intestinal by-pass anastomosis, or both, was carried out. Immediately after complete resection of the intraperitoneal recurrent tumors, a 2- to 3-hour IPHP was performed under hypothermic general anesthesia at about 32 degrees C, using a perfusate containing 10 micrograms/ml or 20 micrograms/ml of mitomycin C (MMC) warmed at the inflow temperature of 46.6 degrees C to 46.9 degrees C. The apparatus used for IPHP was designed for intraperitoneal perfusion as a closed circuit. Although five of the six patients had a malignant peritoneal effusion at the time of admission, the effusion disappeared soon after IPHP, and no cancer cell was present in the lavage from Douglas' pouch. The other patient had a recurrent tumor at the anastomotic region after low anterior resection for rectal cancer and complete resection of the recurrent tumor, combined with IPHP, was carried out. One patient with a recurrent gastric cancer died of hepatic metastasis and cancerous pleuritis 5 months after this treatment, and the other five are in good health 12.8 +/- 5.1 months after IPHP. On the other hand, five patients with intra-abdominal recurrent gastric cancer, who received only surgical treatment within the same period of time, died 3.0 +/- 2.1 months after the surgery. Postoperatively, in the six patients with IPHP, transitory hepatic dysfunction, hypoproteinemia, and thrombocytopenia occurred. These results show that IPHP using MMC combined with surgery is a safe, reliable treatment for patients with peritoneal recurrence of gastrointestinal cancer.\r"

In particular, fully automated, \"hands off\" instruments have great appeal to laboratories with a limited number of well-trained and experienced clinical microbiology personnel. None of the evaluated instruments is perfect, but then neither are the standard or reference techniques. Overnight incubation has been the yardstick since the early days of in vitro AST. Given the usually shorter therapeutic intervals of 4- to 12-hour dosage schedules, it is quite possible that shorter incubation times for in vitro tests will become more of a standard. Until that time, newer, including automatic, techniques need to be evaluated against the more traditional standard methods. Quality control is critical, and since no systematic approach aside from individual manufacturers' suggestions exists, it should be developed by the NCCLS or similar agencies. Quality control might include standards for the evaluation of such equipment and systems because the development of new technology in this area will continue. Overall, reproducibility and accuracy of the instruments and methods evaluated were quite promising and should encourage well-designed studies of clinical correlation and relevance. The AMS equipment has been in use for routine AST in the clinical laboratories of the Seattle Veterans Administration Medical Center and the University of Washington Hospital. Because of its simplicity and flexibility, the Kirby-Bauer method continues to be an alternate technique for certain important clinical isolates, for instance, blood cultures in both laboratories. Finally, it should be remembered that the most critical function of all such equipment is the reliable detection of resistance.\r"

Preliminary trials indicate that surgical implantation of a hybrid device containing living insulin-secreting tissue may function as a combined glucose sensor and insulin-infusion pump. By means of a chamber composed of a semipermeable membrane shaped into hollow fibers or a box surrounding endocrine tissue, pilot studies have shown that isolated islets of Langerhans, fragments of insulinoma, or a fetal pancreas retains function for days to weeks, as judged by the ability to sustain euglycemic conditions in chemically induced diabetic rats. Lacking clear proof that normalizing blood glucose levels will prevent vascular complications of diabetes in humans, the case for further development of a hybrid (tissue plus fabricated components) device rests mainly on optimistic extrapolation of results attained in the chemically induced diabetic rat and dog. For the minority of diabetic patients who have insulin-dependent diabetes, the benefit afforded by a bionic device establishing internal insulin release regulated by silently sensed blood glucose level is more than enough payoff for the discomfort and surgery involved in its implantation. Further trials of a hybrid artificial pancreas in the dog appear warranted as a logical extension of preliminary studies with this species.\r"

  ".W": "In humans, arterial PCO2 (PaCO2) has been demonstrated to be regulated at or near resting levels in the steady state of moderate exercise (i.e., for work rates not associated with a sustained lactic acidosis). To determine how PaCO2 might be expected to behave under the nonsteady-state conditions of incremental exercise testing, the influence of the dynamic characteristics of the primary variables that determine PaCO2 was explored by means of computer modeling. We constructed a dynamic model that utilized previously reported experimental estimates for the kinetic response parameters of ventilation (VE) and CO2 output (VCO2). In response to incremental work rate forcings, the model yielded an increase in PaCO2, which reflected the disparity between the VE and VCO2 time constants; this hypercapnic condition was maintained despite VE and VCO2 both increasing linearly with respect to the input work rate profile. The degree of hypercapnia increased with the rate of the incremental forcing, reaching 9 Torr for a 50-W/min forcing. In conclusion, therefore, sustained increases in PaCO2 during nonsteady-state incremental exercise should be interpreted with caution, because this is the predicted response even in subjects with normal ventilatory control and lung function.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the possible contributory role of hypoxia in the development of monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected subcutaneously with monocrotaline (60 mg/kg) or saline in controls and were kept in oxygen-enriched (inspired O2 fraction of 0.35) or compressed air chambers. After 21 days, rats were anesthetized while spontaneously breathing room air, hemodynamic parameters and arterial blood gases were measured, and animals were killed. Right ventricular peak systolic pressures (RVPP), right ventricular-to-left ventricular plus septal weight ratios (RV/LV + S), hematocrits, lung dry weight-to-body weight ratios, and medial thickness of pulmonary arteries were significantly reduced in monocrotaline-injected rats exposed to mild hyperoxia compared with air. The air-exposed monocrotaline-injected rats had significantly more arterial hypoxemia than the other groups, and mild hyperoxia had no effect on any of the measured variables in saline-injected rats. To determine whether the effects of mild hyperoxia occurred early or late after monocrotaline injection, we moved separate groups of rats from air to mild hyperoxia and vice versa 10 days after monocrotaline injection. After 21 days, significant reductions in RVPP and RV/LV + S occurred only in rats exposed to mild hyperoxia during the latter 11 days after injection. Our findings suggest that hypoxia contributes to the development of pulmonary hypertension relatively late after monocrotaline injection in rats but that it does not influence the early injury.\r"

  ".W": "Minute ventilation (VE) during sustained hypoxia is not constant but begins to decline within 10-25 min in adult humans. The decrease in brain tissue PCO2 may be related to this decline in VE, because hypoxia causes an increase in brain blood flow, thus resulting in enhanced clearance of CO2 from the brain tissue. To examine the validity of this hypothesis, we measured VE and arterial and internal jugular venous blood gases simultaneously and repeatedly in 15 healthy male volunteers during progressive and subsequent sustained isocapnic hypoxia (arterial PO2 = 45 Torr) for 20 min. It was assumed that jugular venous PCO2 was an index of brain tissue PCO2. Mean VE declined significantly from the initial (16.5 l/min) to the final phase (14.1 l/min) of sustained hypoxia (P less than 0.05). Compared with the control (50.9 Torr), jugular venous PCO2 significantly decreased to 47.4 Torr at the initial phase of hypoxia but did not differ among the phases of hypoxia (47.2 Torr for the intermediate phase and 47.7 Torr for the final phase). We classified the subjects into two groups by hypoxic ventilatory response during progressive hypoxia at the mean value. The decrease in VE during sustained hypoxia was significant in the low responders (n = 9) [13.2 (initial phase) to 9.3 l/min (final phase of hypoxia), P less than 0.01], but not in the high responders (n = 6) (20.9-21.3 l/min, NS). This finding could not be explained by the change of arterial or jugular venous gases, which did not significantly change during sustained hypoxia in either group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Lipoxygenase products have been suggested as mediators of the hypoxic pulmonary pressor response in newborn animals. Data supporting this suggestion are equivocal, since lipoxygenase and leukotriene receptor antagonists that have been used may produce vasodilation because of phosphodiesterase inhibition. We used a leukotriene receptor antagonist L 649923, which appears not to have smooth muscle relaxant activity. L 649923 blocks pressor responses to leukotriene D4 (LTD4) without diminishing the pressor response to hypoxia. Also, BW 755C did not block the pressor response to hypoxia in newborn sheep and goats, whereas the pressor response to LTD4 (75 ng/kg) was depressed significantly. In newborn sheep there was an augmented response to hypoxia with BW 755C, which is consistent with cyclooxygenase inhibition. Finally, the thromboxane receptor antagonist SQ 29548 was investigated in both species. With this agent the pressor response to LTD4 in contrast to that of hypoxia was completely inhibited. We conclude that thromboxanes are involved in the pressor response to LTD4 in newborn lambs and goats. These data do not support the view that leukotrienes are involved in the ovine or caprine neonatal pulmonary pressor response to hypoxia.\r"

To further investigate the mechanism of thromboxane generation, we studied the influence of the phospholipase A2 inhibitor, mepacrine, in a dose known to inhibit the enzyme in other systems, on t-bu-OOH-induced pulmonary arterial vasoconstriction. We found that 10(-4) M mepacrine completely inhibited t-bu-OOH-induced vasoconstriction. We also found that mepacrine inhibited arachidonic acid-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction but did not inhibit thromboxane productions. We also investigated the effect of mepacrine on two other pulmonary vasoconstrictors, angiotensin II (ANG II) and KCl, which do not act through arachidonic acid metabolites in the rabbit lung. Mepacrine inhibited both ANG-II and KCl-induced vasoconstriction. The inhibition by mepacrine of pulmonary vasoconstriction is reversible if the drug is washed out of the lung. This effect of mepacrine cannot be explained by phospholipase inhibition alone and is consistent with prevention of smooth muscle contraction.\r"

The changes from awake to REM in subsets of 9 younger and 10 older subjects who successfully completed REM tests were from 0.95 +/- 0.32 to 0.70 +/- 0.38 (P less than 0.03) and 0.53 +/- 0.31 to 0.57 +/- 0.25 (NS), respectively.

Neither of the 2 prolactinomas exposed to GnRH responded to GnRH, whereas all 5 prolactinomas responded to TRH. These findings demonstrate the presence of functional GnRH receptors on endocrinologically inactive pituitary adenomas. The phosphatidyl inositol-linked receptor status of these tumors differs from that of prolactinomas. These receptors may offer a possible target for therapeutic intervention in endocrinologically inactive adenomas.\r"

To define the contribution of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase in these defects, we studied autophosphorylation and kinase activity of lectin purified receptors from these six patients and six normal cell lines. The patients' insulin receptors, prepared by precipitation with polyethylene glycol, had normal insulin binding characteristics and autophosphorylation properties, but a 56% decrease in the tyrosine kinase activity toward an exogenous substrate. To identify more subtle qualitative defects in autophosphorylation, insulin receptors were sequentially immunoprecipitated and analyzed for their phosphoaminoacid content. The phosphorylated receptors precipitated with an antiphosphotyrosine antibody contained labeled phosphotyrosine, whereas those in the supernatant, when further precipitated with an antireceptor antibody, contained only phosphoserine. Under these conditions, the insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation of tyrosine was significantly decreased by 54% in the patient receptors compared to normal subjects' receptors. In addition, insulin-like growth factor-I stimulation of autophosphorylation of its receptor was reduced by 59% in the patients' cells compared to those from normal subjects. We conclude that fibroblasts from patients with lipoatropic diabetes have defects in the tyrosine kinase activity of their insulin and their insulin-like growth factor-I receptors that might give rise to the in vitro hormone resistance and be related to the in vivo hormone resistance that occurs in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "Polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD) is associated with elevated serum LH and (sub)normal FSH levels, while serum androgen levels are often elevated. To clarify the role of androgens in this abnormal pattern of gonadotropin secretion, LH secretion was studied in 1) 9 eugonadal female to male transsexual subjects before and during long term (6 months) testosterone (T) administration (250 mg/2 weeks, im), and 2) in a woman with an androgen-secreting ovarian tumor both before and after surgical removal of the tumor. Finally, we studied the effects of high serum androgen levels on ovarian histology in 3) 26 transsexual subjects after long term (9-36 months) T administration (250 mg/2 weeks, im) to assess whether T-induced ovarian abnormalities are similar to those that occur in women with PCOD. Long term T treatment in the nine female to male transsexual subjects resulted in increases in the mean serum T level from 1.7 +/- 0.8 (+/- SD) to 40.8 +/- 31.9 nmol/L (P less than 0.01), the mean serum dihydrotestosterone level from 0.6 +/- 0.2 to 3.3 +/- 1.5 nmol/L (P less than 0.02), and the mean serum free T level from 9.5 +/- 5.2 to 149 +/- 46 pmol/L (P less than 0.02). Mean serum estrone and estradiol levels were similar before and during T treatment. The mean serum LH level decreased from 6.3 +/- 2.0 to 2.9 +/- 1.1 U/L (P less than 0.01), and the mean FSH levels decreased from 6.6 +/- 2.0 to 3.7 +/- 2.2 U/L (P less than 0.02). Pulsatile LH secretion before and during T treatment was studied in five subjects. Neither the mean nadir LH interval nor the LH pulse amplitude changed significantly in these five subjects. The serum T level in the woman with the androgen-secreting ovarian tumor was 9.6 nmol/L, and it declined to normal after removal of the tumor. Her mean serum LH and FSH levels, the mean nadir LH interval, and LH pulse amplitude were in the normal range before and after removal of the tumor. Studies of ovarian histopathology in 26 transsexual subjects after long term androgen treatment revealed multiple cystic follicles in 18 subjects (69.2%), diffuse ovarian stromal hyperplasia in 21 subjects (80.8%), collagenization of the tunica albuginea in 25 subjects (96.2%), and luteinization of stromal cells in 7 subjects (26.9%). Findings consistent with criteria for the pathological diagnosis of polycystic ovaries, that is 3 of the 4 findings listed above, were present in 18 of the 26 subjects (69.2%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to examine the mechanisms causing peripheral insulin resistance in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) by studying insulin receptor function and glycogen synthase activity in biopsies of skeletal muscle. The results in seven such patients were compared with values obtained in a group of sedentary, age- and sex-matched normal subjects. In addition, since physical training appears to improve insulin sensitivity, the IDDM patients were reexamined after physical training for 6 weeks. The mean maximal glycogen synthase activity was lower in the diabetic than in the normal group [34.5 +/- 10.6 (+/- SD) vs. 45.7 +/- 8.6 nmol/mg protein.min; P less than 0.05], whereas there was no difference in the half-maximal activation constant (A0.5) for glucose-6-phosphate. Likewise, the mean yield of wheat germ agglutinin-purified insulin receptors recovered per mg muscle was 21% lower in the muscle biopsies from the diabetic patients (47 +/- 8 vs. 66 +/- 20 fmol/100 mg; P less than 0.05. However, basal and insulin-stimulated receptor kinase activities, expressed as phosphorylation of the synthetic peptide poly-Glu-Tyr(4:1), were identical in the two groups. After physical training in the diabetic patients the mean maximal oxygen uptake increased from 45.7 +/- 7.4 to 48.9 +/- 9.0 mL O2/kg.min (P less than 0.05), hemoglobin A1c decreased from 7.9 +/- 1.4% to 7.7 +/- 1.5% (P less than 0.05), and insulin requirements decreased from 43 +/- 9 to 38 +/- 8 U/day (P less than 0.05). The number of recovered insulin receptors did not increase, and the receptor kinase activity was similar to the pre-training value. Maximal glycogen synthase activity increased by 15% (P less than 0.02), whereas A0.5 for glucose-6-phosphate did not change. We conclude that insulin binding to muscle-derived insulin receptors is impaired in IDDM patients, whereas receptor kinase function appears to be normal. The capacity for glycogen storage in the diabetic skeletal muscle was reduced. Physical training tended to normalize glycogen synthase activity, but did not improve insulin receptor function significantly.\r"

To investigate the possible existence of an autoregulatory mechanism for LH in humans, we compared the basal LH concentrations and the LH response to a GnRH stimulus with and without prior administration of hCG. On two separate occasions, at least 1 week apart, six normal (eugonadal) males and six normal postmenopausal females were given, in random order, either 10,000 IU hCG or saline followed by iv injection of a 200-micrograms bolus of GnRH. Blood samples were then taken 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, and 300 min after GnRH. Serum concentrations of LH and hCG were measured at each time by two monoclonal antibody sandwich assays developed in our laboratory. After exogenous hCG, serum hCG concentrations rose rapidly to 200-500 IU/L (15,000-35,000 pg/mL) in both the men and women, remaining at this high level throughout the study. In the men, sex steroid concentrations did not change in response to the hCG during the 9 study hours. Compared to saline-treated controls, hCG had no significant effect in either men or postmenopausal women on the basal LH concentration or the response to a GnRH bolus, as determined by peak response and area under the LH/time curve between 0-300 min after GnRH. We conclude that an ultrashort loop feedback mechanism for LH on its own secretion does not exist in humans, as assessed by the present protocol.\r"

  ".W": "To delineate the effects of aging on basal and stimulated TSH secretion, we studied the 24-h profile of plasma TSH levels and the TSH response to TRH stimulation (200 micrograms TRH, iv) in eight healthy elderly men, aged 67-84 yr, and eight normal young men, aged 20-27 yr. Subjects with thyroid antibodies against microsomal or thyroglobulin antigens were excluded. During the 24-h study, blood was sampled at 15-min intervals. TSH levels were measured by an ultrasensitive immunoradiometric assay. Sleep was polygraphically monitored, and circadian and pulsatile TSH variations were quantified using specifically designed computer algorithms. In older men, the 24-h mean TSH concentration was approximately 50% lower than that in young men (0.78 +/- 0.37 vs. 1.43 +/- 0.41 microU/mL; P less than 0.01), but basal T3 levels were only slightly lower (93 +/- 12 vs. 115 +/- 16 ng/dL; P less than 0.02), while basal T4 levels were normal. The normal diurnal variation of TSH levels, with a nocturnal acrophase and an afternoon nadir, as well as the pulsatile nature of TSH release were preserved in elderly men. When expressed in microunits per mL, the amplitude of these temporal variations was reduced in elderly men compared to that in younger subjects. However, when expressed in relation to the mean TSH levels, the amplitudes of diurnal and pulsatile variations were similar in both groups of subjects. TRH-induced TSH secretion was lower in old than in young men (area under the curve, 15.9 +/- 6.3 microU/mL.10 min in elderly men vs. 42.0 +/- 16.6 microU/mL.10 min in young men; P less than 0.002). However, the TRH-induced elevations of T3 and T4 were of similar magnitude in both groups. These results indicate that in healthy elderly men, the overall 24-h TSH secretion is decreased, and the pituitary is less responsive to stimulation by TRH. However, the chronobiological modulation is preserved. These alterations could reflect an adaptative mechanism to the reduced need for thyroid hormones in old age. The thyroid keeps an intact capacity to respond to acute increases in TSH concentrations.\r"

These concentrations were substantially higher than the plasma total and free DLIF levels in these women: 1216 nmol/L and 158 nmol/L, respectively (p less than 0.0001). The plasma DLIF levels in the gonadotropin-treated women were comparable to those in term pregnant women, which are known to be higher than those in non-pregnant women. The ovary thus may be a source of DLIF in the plasma of gonadotropin-treated women, and DLIF may have a role in ovarian follicular fluid homeostasis.\r"

GHRP infusion resulted in a dramatic, selective and dose-dependent increase in serum GH concentrations.\r"

  ".W": "GnRH antagonists have been developed in large part because of their potential use as contraceptive agents, particularly in men. Specifically, it was hoped that GnRH antagonists combined with testosterone (T) would be a more effective contraceptive regimen than T alone. We compared the suppressive effects of a potent GnRH antagonist, Na1-Glu [AcD2NaL1,D4ClPhe2,D3Pal3,Arg5,DGlu6(AA),+ ++DAla10-GnRH], and of T together and separately on serum and urinary gonadotropin and serum inhibin levels in normal men. Ten-day courses of Nal-Glu (75 micrograms/kg; Nal-Glu alone), 200 mg testosterone enanthate, im, on days 0 and 7 (T alone), and the combination (Na1-Glu + T) were given to nine men. Serum gonadotropin and inhibin concentrations decreased after 1-2 days of Na1-Glu administration, while gonadotropin suppression occurred more slowly after T alone. Serum T fell to 30% of baseline values during Na1-Glu administration. The combination of Na1-Glu + T was more effective in suppressing serum LH, FSH, and inhibin than was either Na1-Glu alone or T alone. All hormone levels returned to baseline levels within 2.5 weeks after the end of the three regimens. We conclude that the Na1-Glu GnRH antagonist effectively inhibits gonadotropin, inhibin, and sex steroid secretion when given daily for 10 days and that the administration of Nal-Glu + T results in more complete gonadotropin and gonadal suppression than that produced by either agent given alone. These results encourage further investigation of the combination of a GnRH antagonist and T as a male contraceptive regimen and of the antagonist alone as a treatment for hormone-dependent neoplasia.\r"

  ".W": "During the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, plasma progesterone (P) and estradiol (E2) concentrations are elevated, and LH (and by inference GnRH) pulse frequency is slow. In contrast, LH pulse frequency increases during the early follicular phase when plasma E2 and P are lower. To examine the mechanism(s) responsible for the slower GnRH pulse frequency in the luteal phase, we maintained plasma P, E2, or both at midluteal concentrations from the midluteal phase to the time of the next early follicular phase and measured the effects on LH secretion. Thirteen normal women with regular menstrual cycles were studied during two or three cycles. Blood was obtained every 10 min during 10-h studies. Control cycle luteal and early follicular studies were followed by a second control study in the luteal phase of the treatment cycle. P (six women), E2 (seven women), or both (five women) then were given twice daily by im injection for 6-12 days until the day corresponding to the early follicular study of the control cycle (EF + P, EF + E2, or EF + E2 + P). A final study was performed 1 week after the injections were discontinued (F). LH pulse frequency was low in the midluteal phase [3.2 +/- 0.2 (+/- SE) pulses/10 h] and increased by the early follicular phase (8.0 +/- 0.8 pulses/10 h) in the control cycles. The increase in LH pulse frequency was not significantly inhibited by administration of P (6.7 +/- 0.7 pulses/10 h; EF + P). However, during both E2 alone and E2 + P, LH pulse frequency remained low (EF + E2, 3.6 +/- 0.8; EF + E2 + P, 2.0 +/- 0.7 pulses/10 h). The mean plasma FSH concentrations paralleled changes in LH pulse frequency, increasing from the luteal to the early follicular phase in the control cycles and during P injections and remaining low during E2 and E2 + P injections. We conclude that continued exposure to P alone does not maintain GnRH pulse frequency at midluteal phase values and that any effect of P requires the presence of E2. As E2 alone maintained lower LH pulse frequency, E2 may act directly to decrease the pulsatile GnRH secretion or it may potentiate the effects of low (less than 3.2 nmol/L) P concentrations.\r"

No significant mood or behavior changes were found as a function of pubertal stages, controlling for age effects, except for a decrease in interest in sports. The hormonal stages revealed a significant curvilinear trend for depressive affect (increase, then decrease; P less than 0.01), impulse control (decrease, then increase; P less than 0.04), and psychopathology (increase, then decrease; P less than 0.03) scales, indicating significant changes in these behaviors during times of rapid increases in hormone levels. These data suggest that hormonal changes may be more important than the physical changes as determinants of certain mood and behavior patterns at adolescence.\r"

Bacterial species commonly isolated from infected sputum but generally not considered to be pathogenic--Enterobacteriacae, Neisseria pharyngis, coagulase negative staphylococci, alpha-haemolytic streptococci, and Candida albicans--were similarly studied. Of the \"pathogens\", the Gram negative species B catarrhalis, H parainfluenzae and Ps aeruginosa synthesised clinically important amounts of histamine; this was not the case for the Gram positive species S aureus and S pneumoniae. Of the \"non-pathogenic\" species, only the Enterobacteriacae, as a group, were found to synthesise clinically important amounts of histamine. These results show that some Gram negative bacteria, associated with acute exacerbations in respiratory infections, produce histamine and possibly other inflammatory mediators, which may contribute to their pathogenecity in the lower respiratory tract in vivo.\r"

The gallery was easy to use and tests, with the exception of leucine arylamidase (LAP) and starch fermentation (AMD), were simple to interpret. Identification to genus level was satisfactory but differentiation between species was poor. Using the API 20 STREP the haemolytic species L monocytogenes, seeligeri, and ivanovii could easily be differentiated from the non-haemolytic species L welshimeri, innocua, grayii and murrayi. Of the haemolytic species, L monocytogenes could not be distinguished from L seeligeri but L ivanovii could be separated from the two other haemolytic species because it fermented ribose. Non-haemolytic L welshimeri could not be differentiated from non-haemolytic L innocua, but mannitol and ribose fermenting non-haemolytic L grayi and L murrayi were easily differentiated from the other two non-haemolytic species. The API 20 STREP identified Listeria in four hours and therefore might be used for rapid identification of strains causing infection in man. It would, however, not be useful to identify environmental isolates when speciation is important.\r"

  ".W": "It is generally accepted that human Th cells express the surface glycoproteins CD4 and alpha/beta-chain heterodimer of the TCR whereas cytotoxic/suppressor cells are usually CD8+ and alpha/beta TCR+. Another minor set of T cells found in the periphery are CD4-/CD8- (double negative) and express the gamma/delta TCR; these cells can manifest MHC-restricted or nonrestricted cytotoxicity but no helper function. Herein we describe the existence of an unusual Th population in the peripheral blood of humans that are CD4-/CD8- and alpha/beta TCR+. These double-negative Th were markedly expanded in patients with the autoimmune disease SLE and along with CD4+ Th, they induced production of the pathogenic variety of anti-DNA autoantibodies that are IgG in class and cationic in charge. The cationic anti-DNA antibodies induced by the Th were markedly restricted in spectrotype indicating that an oligoclonal population of B cells were committed to produce the pathogenic autoantibodies in active lupus. IL-2-dependent T cell lines were also derived from the patients with active lupus nephritis but the majority of those T cell lines lacked pathogenic autoantibody-inducing capability. Only 4 out of 42 T cell lines from a lupus patient could induce the production of cationic IgG class anti-DNA autoantibodies. The phenotypes of the pathogenic autoantibody-inducing Th lines were similar to the Th subsets: CD4+, alpha/beta TCR+ or CD4-/CD8-, alpha/beta TCR+. These studies suggest that production of pathogenic autoantibodies in human lupus is mediated by mechanisms that are distinct from the generalized, nonspecific polyclonal B cell hyperactivity that leads to excessive production of natural autoantibodies.\r"

  ".W": "We have recently shown that epidermal growth factor (EGF) is capable of positive regulation of IFN-gamma production, thus establishing a functional relationship between nonhemopoietic growth factors and the immune system. In order to study this relationship further, EGF and the EGF-related growth factors transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) and vaccinia virus growth factor (VGF), which stimulate cellular proliferation via binding to the EGF receptor, were studied for their functional and physicochemical effects on IFN-gamma production. In contrast to the positive signal of purified murine EGF and recombinant human EGF (both at 1 nM), neither synthetic TGF alpha nor recombinant VGF were capable of restoring competence for IFN-gamma production by Th cell-depleted spleen cell cultures. TGF-alpha and VGF, in molar excess, also failed to block the helper signal of EGF for IFN-gamma production. Thus TGF-alpha and VGF failed to functionally compete for the EGF receptor in the murine spleen cell system. Both TGF-alpha and VGF stimulated murine 3T3 cell proliferation at concentrations similar to those of EGF, and thus their failure to provide help for IFN-gamma production was not due to a general lack of biologic activity. Binding studies with 125I-EGF suggest that the EGF receptor on murine lymphocytes is not constitutively expressed, but inducible by the T cell mitogen staphylococcal enterotoxin A. TGF-alpha did not compete with 125I-EGF for the induced receptor. The data suggest that lymphocytes express a novel inducible EGF receptor that differs from that expressed on cells such as 3T3 fibroblasts.\r"

This response was ablated by prior removal of adherent macrophages. IFN-gamma secretion in vitro was preceded by the rapid production of TNF and was inhibited by addition of neutralizing mAb to TNF. Moreover, injection of scid mice with anti-TNF mAb increased the severity of infection with live Listeria and inhibited macrophage activation for class II-MHC expression. Finally, IFN-gamma secretion and class II-MHC expression were also inhibited by an antibody to asialoGM1, a reagent known to impair host NK cell function. These results suggest that TNF is a critical cytokine in the T cell-independent pathway of macrophage activation in scid mice.\r"

  ".W": "Two types of activation Ag, low affinity FcR for IgE (Fc epsilon R2)/CD23 and IL-2R (Tac/p55), were expressed and differently regulated on human eosinophilic leukemia cell lines (EoL-1 and EoL-3). Because the binding of IgE on EoL-3 cells was completely inhibited by H107 (anti-Fc epsilon R2/CD23 mAb) but not by irrelevant mAb, essentially all the low affinity Fc epsilon R2 on EoL-3 seemed to be the Fc epsilon R2/CD23 molecules. Both IL-4 and IFN-gamma enhanced the surface expression of Fc epsilon R2, whereas IL-1, IL-2, and IL-5 showed no effects, as determined by surface staining with anti-Fc epsilon R2 antibody (H107). In contrast to Fc epsilon R2 up-regulation, IL-4 and IFN-gamma showed a differential effect on the regulation of IL-2R (Tac/p55). Whereas IFN-gamma up-regulated the receptor expression of IL-2R/Tac, IL-4 did not. The result suggests that these lymphokines are involved in the different aspects of the activation pathway of the eosinophils. The possible role of Fc epsilon R2 and IL-2R on the function of eosinophils in allergic reaction is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Supernatants collected after primary or secondary stimulation of spleen cells contain different arrays of lymphokines. Primary supernatants from spleen cells stimulated with Con A or allogeneic spleen cells (MLC-SF) contain IL-2 but little IL-4 or IGN-gamma; in contrast, secondary MLC-SF contains IL-2 as well as substantial IL-4 and IFN-gamma. Our laboratory previously had always used secondary MLC-SF for cloning T cells, and had routinely obtained TH1 helper T lymphocyte clones. In the present study, when primary Con A-SF was used as source of growth factors, TH2 and not TH1 clones were preferentially derived. Considering the possibility that IFN-gamma may be one important factor in determining whether TH1 or TH2 clones are preferentially obtained, clone derivation was then performed either in the presence of rIL-2 or rIL-2 plus rIFN-gamma. The majority of clones derived using rIL-2 alone were TH2 cells, whereas the majority of clones derived using rIL-2 plus rIFN-gamma were TH1 cells. Using either procedure, some clones were obtained that produced IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma. These data are consistent with our previous observations that IFN-gamma inhibits the proliferation of TH2 but not TH1 clones, and suggest that the presence of IFN-gamma during an immune response would result in the preferential expansion of helper T lymphocytes of the TH1 phenotype. Our procedure for the differential selection of TH1 and TH2 clones reactive with the same Ag should be useful for designing in vitro systems for studying the function of these cell subsets in specific immune responses.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the capacity of several recombinant cytokines to induce IL-6 in vivo in both normal and tumor-bearing (TB) mice. Intravenous administration of human rhTNF-alpha, rhIL-1, rhIL-2, rhIFN-alpha A/D, and rmIFN-gamma were all capable of inducing circulating IL-6. rhTNF-alpha administration caused the greatest induction of IL-6. TB animals consistently produced more IL-6 in response to rhTNF-alpha than did normal mice (2 h after 4 micrograms rhTNF-alpha, TB = 24,100 HGF U/ml, non-TB = 3600 HGF U/ml of IL-6). A single daily i.v. dose of rhTNF-alpha (4 micrograms/mouse/day) for 5 days led to decreased IL-6 induction in TB animals by day 3 of treatment (peak levels of IL-6, day 1 = 72,800 HGF U/ml, day 3 = 23,400 HGF U/ml, day 5 = 26,400 HGF U/ml). rhIL-1 administration also resulted in considerable IL-6 production, although peak values were less than those resulting from administration of rhTNF-alpha. Administration of rhIL-1 induced similar IL-6 levels (TB = 10,025 and non-TB = 10,600 HGF U/ml) in TB and normal mice. Single high doses of rhIL-2, rhIFN-alpha A/D, and rmIFN-gamma induced lower but consistent levels of circulating IL-6 in mice with and without tumor. In addition, the sera of untreated TB mice contained levels of IL-6 which paralleled the extent of tumor burden (serum IL-6 in day 30 MCA 106 TB mice = 420 HGF U/ml). The detection of de novo IL-6 was also confirmed in animals bearing tumors of different histologies (the MCA 102 sarcoma, MCA 38 adenocarcinoma, and B16 melanoma). At no time was IL-6 measurable in the sera of untreated normal mice. The identification of IL-6 was verified by neutralization studies using specific antimurine IL-6 antibody. Although the exact role of IL-6 in TB animals remains to be elucidated, its known pleotrophic immune and metabolic effects may be important in the host response to malignancy.\r"

  ".W": "The addition of the serine protease inhibitor p-toluenesulfonyl-L-arginine methyl ester (TAME) to human peripheral blood mononuclear cells suppressed TNF secretion in a concentration dependent manner. At a concentration 10 mM TAME leukocyte TNF release was completely inhibited without decreasing the secretion of IL-1 alpha. Simultaneously exposing leukocytes to 10 mM TAME and either 1000 U/ml IFN-gamma or 10 micrograms/ml LPS reduced the quantity of TNF secreted by 75% and 47%, respectively, when compared with the effect of either IFN-gamma or LPS alone. TAME was most effective when added to leukocytes at the initiation of culture and the suppressive effects of this protease inhibitor were reversible by washing the cells. TAME suppressed TNF secretion without affecting either the level of TNF mRNA or the expression of cell surface cytokine. These findings suggest that leukocyte TNF secretion is dependent upon the action of one or more serine proteases.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously reported two anti-idiotypic antibodies, 3I and 8.12, that recognize L chain determinants on anti-DNA antibodies. We have generated a new anti-idiotypic antibody, F4, that recognizes a H chain determinant on cationic anti-DNA antibodies. F4 reactivity is present in high titer in serum of approximately 60% of SLE patients and on 84 of 706 myeloma proteins. It is preferentially associated with 3I reactive L chains. Furthermore, antibodies bearing both the F4 and 3I idiotypic determinants preferentially bind DNA. Amino acid sequencing of H chains isolated from four F4-reactive myeloma proteins suggests that they derive from two currently identified VH gene families. F4 reactivity is restricted almost exclusively to Ig of the IgG isotype suggesting that F4 may recognize either a somatically mutated hypervariable region or a variable region used late in the immune response. F4, therefore, represents a new idiotypic family preferentially associated with auto-Ag specificity and having features of an Ag-driven immune response.\r"

  ".W": "Murine peritoneal macrophages from mice that are resistant to Mycobacterium bovis (strain BCG) can be induced to continuously express MHC class II (Ia) glycoproteins. In contrast, macrophages from BCG susceptible mice will only transiently express Ia. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the biochemical basis of continuous or transient Ia expression. We therefore compared Ia biosynthesis by macrophages from C.D2Bcgr mice to that by macrophages from congenic BALB/c.Bcgs mice. We show that macrophages from both strains of mice synthesize Ia initially and that very little synthesis occurs after 5 days of in vitro culture. No differences in the amount of Ia synthesized by the macrophages was apparent as determined by quantitative immunoprecipitation and by ELISA. Despite the lack of synthesis, macrophages from C.D2Bcgr mice continue to express Ia. The results of pulse-chase experiments indicate that macrophages from BALB/c.Bcgs mice degrade newly synthesized MHC class II glycoproteins whereas the majority of Ia remains associated with macrophages from the C.D2Bcgr mice. The addition of chloroquine to cultures of macrophages from BALB/c.Bcgs mice prevented the degradation and prolonged the expression of Ia. The results of this investigation show that there are no differences in the synthesis of Ia by macrophages from the two congenic strains of mice. The transient expression of Ia by macrophages from BALB/c.Bcgs mice is due to its degradation.\r"

Anti-IFN-gamma-treated mice developed cutaneous lesions; parasites spread to the regional lymph nodes and then metastasized to spleens and livers. The course of disease in these animals was similar to that of genetically susceptible BALB/c mice. Two exceptions in the pathology of L. major infections were noted between BALB/c and anti-IFN-gamma-treated C3H/HeN mice: 1) BALB/c mice died of systemic complications, whereas C3H/HeN mice did not, and 2) multinucleated giant cells were observed in lymph nodes and spleens of infected BALB/c mice, whereas these cells were not observed in infected C3H/HeN mice. Control mice, those treated with either saline or irrelevant antibody of the same isotype as the anti-IFN-gamma monoclonal, showed no evidence of cutaneous disease (development of footpad lesions) or systemic infection (by histopathology). Total abrogation of the natural resistance of C3H/HeN mice could be achieved by treatment with as little as 0.5 mg/mouse/wk of anti-IFN-gamma antibody, or by a single dose of 1 mg/mouse anti-IFN-gamma antibody administered at the time of parasite inoculation. If antibody treatment was delayed for as little as 1 wk after parasite inoculation, the infections in treated animals resembled that of untreated or control antibody-treated mice: no cutaneous lesions (by footpad swelling or viable counts of leishmania in footpad tissue) or systemic disease (by microscopic analysis of touch preparations of internal organs, and histopathology of same). The production of IFN-gamma during the initial interaction of the parasite and host cells appears to be a major component of genetic control of natural resistance to infection with L. major in C3H/HeN mice.\r"

  ".W": "Using the synthetic peptide approach, we have identified a part of the staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) molecule that is responsible for stimulation of T cell proliferation and induction of the lymphokine IFN-gamma. Peptides were synthesized corresponding to amino acids 1 to 27, SEA(1-27), and 28 to 45, SEA(28-45). Both peptides were tested for direct competition with SEA for blockage of SEA induced proliferation and production of IFN-gamma by T cells. Further, antibodies were produced to the peptides and tested for their ability to bind to SEA and block SEA function. SEA (1-27), but not SEA (28-45), blocked proliferation of human peripheral T cells and induction of IFN-gamma by the T cell line, L12-R4. The inhibitory effects were specific, because SEA (1-27) did not inhibit the induction of T cell proliferation by the mitogen PHA. Consistent with the direct inhibition of function, antibodies to SEA (1-27), but not SEA (28-45), neutralized the mitogenic activity of SEA on human PBL. The data suggest that a functional site on SEA that is responsible for its modulation of T cell function involves the N-terminal 27 amino acids. Residues 1 to 27 of SEA could potentially interact at either the level of the TCR or may block the proposed binding of SEA to class II MHC Ag, based on recent data showing that these molecules are involved in SEA-induced proliferation.\r"

Of the 15 clonal antibodies we examined, all H chain V regions were of the VHIII family. In contrast, the L chains of these antibodies were clearly from at least four different VL families; VKI, VKII, VKIII, and V lambda. Interestingly. VL family expression correlated with the cross-reactivity of these antibodies to the capsular carbohydrate of Escherichia coli K100. VKII antibodies did not cross-react, whereas antibodies expressing V lambda, VKI, or VKIII generally cross-reacted. We conclude that L chain V regions are very important contributors to the limited heterogeneity in this antibody repertoire.\r"

  ".W": "In this report, we characterize an alternate gene element of the murine TCR beta-chain. First, we have looked at the expression of the alternate exon, C beta 0, in normal T cell clones, as well as in fetal vs adult whole thymus. The C beta 0 exon is expressed in only 1% or less of TCR-beta messages in four of four mature T cell clones examined. C beta 0 is found at 10-fold higher levels in both fetal and adult thymus mRNA. Thus C beta 0 is developmentally regulated by T cells, although expression of the alternate exon is relatively constant from the fetal thymus to the adult thymus. Second, evolutionary conservation of the C beta 0 gene element was studied in both the rat and the human. The rat beta-locus contains a gene element highly homologous to the mouse C beta 0 gene, but the rat C beta 0 gene contains mutations in both splice sites that probably prevent the gene element from being spliced into mRNA. We have also sequenced the first exon of rat C beta 1, and find that the C beta 0 exon and the intron around C beta 0 are conserved between rat and mouse to the same level as the C beta 1 coding region. The intron around C beta 1, in contrast, shows the decrease in conservation between the two species that is expected for a noncoding region. Analysis of the putative C beta 0-containing region in the human reveals no sequences homologous to the C beta 0 gene element. Because the mouse is the only species that has conserved a functional C beta 0 gene, we conclude that the C beta 0 exon does not play a general role in T cell development.\r"

VH J558 was overrepresented most frequently, but overrepresentation of VH 7183, Q52, and 36-60 was also observed. Importantly, LPS-induced VH gene family expression in these same mice displaying biased VH family usage in spontaneous plasma cells, appeared normal with no evidence for similar biases in the LPS-induced repertoire. Anti-DNA antibody concentrations and the degree of glomerulonephritis were determined for each mouse to measure the severity of disease. The level of expression of the J558 family was positively correlated with disease severity. The results suggest that the initial autoantibody response is highly diverse but becomes more restricted as the disease progresses.\r"

  ".U": "89278672\r", 
  ".W": "The biochemical mechanisms involved in the activation and killing of tumor targets by large granular lymphocytes (LGL) have not yet been clearly defined. This laboratory has investigated these processes by analyzing the effects of protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors (1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)2-methyl-piperazine-dihydrochloride and retinol) on LGL cytotoxicity and IFN-gamma production. We now report that PKC inhibitors block the LGL functions of 1) NK activity, 2) IFN-gamma production, and 3) LAK activity induced by IL-2. Complete inhibition of cytotoxic activity occurs rapidly because only 2.5 h treatment of the LGL with the inhibitors was required. However, the inhibition of NK activity by the PKC inhibitors could be reversed by IL-2 or the synthetic diacylglycerol, L-gamma-1-oleyl-2-acetol-sn-3-glycerol (OAG), but not by IFN-alpha. The reversal of inhibition observed with OAG indicates that, in these studies, (1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)2-methyl-piperazine-dihydrochloride is inhibiting PKC activity and not the activity of other cellular kinases. Furthermore, inhibition of LGL functional activity with PGE2 could not be reversed with OAG, supporting the contention that PG inhibition of NK activity is mediated by a pathway that does not directly involve PKC. These results indicate, in addition to IL-2-mediated events, that basal NK activity is under PKC regulatory control.\r"

During the antitumor immune response the CD4+:CD8+ T cell ratio decreased significantly and specifically in the restimulated sponges. Depletion of CD8+ but not CD4+ T cells from the tumor immune mice before restimulation significantly reduced the delayed-type hypersensitivity-like response and totally blocked the generation of tumor-specific CTL activity in situ.

In all cases, these M phi cell populations were able to generate an excellent alloresponse, whereas no functional Mlsa determinants could be detected. Third, to further investigate whether the expression of Mlsa is lymphocyte specific, but dependent on expression of class II molecules, we have transfected I-Ek alpha and beta cDNA into a panel of thymomas of Mlsa genotype. Although we achieved a high level of surface I-Ek expression in all of these T cell tumors, none of them was able to trigger the Mlsa-specific THy. These results strongly suggest that Mlsa expression is limited to B cells. It is likely that Mlsa is a tissue-specific self-peptide that associates with class II molecules.\r"

For the inhibition of H2O2 production to occur, preincubation of the macrophages with CGRP was required. Among neuropeptides that are similar in size, calcitonin also prevented macrophage activation but adrenocorticotropic hormone did not. These findings suggest that CGRP and calcitonin play an important role in modulating the ability of macrophages to present Ag and to respond to activating factors.\r"

Previous studies in this laboratory demonstrated that cultured midterm mouse trophoblast cells are not susceptible to allospecific CTL generated by standard in vitro protocols, to antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, or to naive or IFN-activated NK cells, despite expressing the requisite target structures. However, we now report that murine trophoblast can be killed, in a non-MHC-specific manner, by LAK cells. Normal mouse spleen cells cultured for 4 days in IL-2-containing lymphokine preparations characteristically killed both NK-sensitive (YAC-1) and NK-resistant (EL4, P815) target cells, and mediated significant lysis of both cultured and freshly isolated trophoblast cells (35 to 55%, E/T 100/1). Pretreatment of the LAK cells with anti-ASGM1 antibody and C markedly reduced the lysis of trophoblast and YAC-1 targets, suggesting that the responsible cells belonged to the NK lineage. The ability of IL-2-activated NK cells to kill midterm murine trophoblast cells was confirmed using a population of highly lytic NK cells generated by culturing spleen cells from severe combined immunodeficiency mice in 500 U/ml rIL-2 for 5 days. These effector cells killed YAC-1, EL4 and P815 target cells at much lower E/T ratios than was achieved with the normal splenic LAK cells, and mediated significant lysis of both freshly isolated (45 to 50%, E/T 20/1) and cultured trophoblast cells (68 to 76%, E/T 20/1). The susceptibility of trophoblast to LAK cells and IL-2-activated NK cells supports the need for suppressor mechanisms regulating IL-2 activity at the maternal-fetal interface.\r"

Establishment of viral infection was assessed by indirect immunofluorescence for viral antigens and by antigen capture assay carried out on culture fluids. AZT completely blocked infection in one of the HIV-1 variants studied; in the other two, treatment of cells with AZT significantly delayed the appearance of progeny virus.\r"

  ".W": "The activation state of the complement system in 39 consecutively admitted patients with systemic meningococcal disease was studied prospectively using two monoclonal antibodies reacting with neoepitopes exposed during complement activation. The fluid-phase C3 activation products and SC5b-9 (terminal complement complex) were strongly correlated to the levels of endotoxin (lipooligosaccharides, LOS) in plasma on admission (r = .79, P less than .0001 and r = .76, P less than .0001, respectively) and to fatality. Maximum complement activation in survivors occurred 7h (median; range 0-44 h) after initiation of antibiotic treatment. The most severely ill patients had the capacity to activate the whole complement cascade. In nonsurvivors, high-grade activation often continued until the patients died. The results suggest that LOS are important activators of complement in systemic meningococcal disease and that complement-activating products, in concert with other mediators, may contribute to the multiple organ failure and death occurring in the most severe cases.\r"

  ".W": "Several Aspergillus species produce large amounts of the hexitol D-mannitol in vitro, but it is not known whether these species also produce D-mannitol in vivo. Serum samples and homogenized tissues were analyzed from rats pretreated with cortisone and cyclophosphamide and then given 2 x 10(6) preincubated conidia of Aspergillus fumigatus intravenously. The resulting infection was lethal by 48 h and was characterized by much more severe disease in the liver than in the kidneys, spleen, or lungs. A compound present in increased amounts in the livers and sera of the infected rats was shown to be D-mannitol by gas chromatography (GC) and GC/mass spectrometry and enzymatically. Quantitative analysis by GC showed that the infected rats had more D-mannitol in their livers (but not in their lungs or kidneys) after 12 h (P less than .01 at 12, 24, and 36 h) and higher serum D-mannitol concentrations and serum D-mannitol/creatinine ratios after 36 h (P less than .05) than did uninfected controls. These results indicate that A. fumigatus can produce and release sufficient D-mannitol in the tissues of infected animals to raise serum D-mannitol levels. Thus, D-mannitol is a potential diagnostic marker for aspergillosis.\r"

Although there was not any significant difference in mean immunoreactive 7B2 concentrations among various CVA groups, the CSF immunoreactive 7B2 levels in control subjects were 10 to 100 times higher than those in control plasma samples. Immunoreactive calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and immunoreactive atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels in the CSF were comparable to those in corresponding normal plasma samples. The CSF ANP concentrations in patients with cerebral bleeding and subarachnoid hemorrhage were significantly lower than those in control subjects. Gel chromatography or high-performance liquid chromatography indicated that the main immunoreactivities of 7B2, CGRP, and ANP coeluted with corresponding standard material. The high CSF concentrations of immunoreactive 7B2 observed might indicate a functional role of 7B2 in the central nervous system.\r"

Specific in vivo binding of [3H]Ro15-1788 to benzodiazepine receptors was decreased in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, midbrain and striatum after repeated swim stress (7 consecutive days of daily swim stress) when compared to nonstressed mice. In vivo benzodiazepine receptor binding was unaltered after repeated swim stress in the cerebellum and pons medulla. The stress-induced reduction in in vivo benzodiazepine receptor binding did not appear to be due to altered cerebral blood flow or to an alteration in benzodiazepine metabolism or biodistribution because there was no difference in [14C]iodoantipyrine distribution or whole brain concentrations of clonazepam after repeated swim stress. Saturation binding experiments revealed a change in both apparent maximal binding capacity and affinity after repeated swim stress. Moreover, a reduction in clonazepam's anticonvulsant potency was also observed after repeated swim stress [an increase in the ED50 dose for protection against pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures], although there was no difference in pentylenetetrazol-induced seizure threshold between the two groups. In contrast to the results obtained in vivo, no change in benzodiazepine receptor binding kinetics was observed using the in vitro binding method. These data suggest that environmental stress can alter the binding parameters of the benzodiazepine receptor and that the in vivo and in vitro binding methods can yield substantially different results.\r"

This condition is characterized by diminished contractile strength following single shock and tetanic stimulation of the motor nerve, but no effect on contractions evoked by direct muscle stimulation, indicating an apparent impairment of motor axon conduction, junctional transmission or both. The purpose of the present study was to investigate further the neuromuscular depression caused by DTB using conventional intracellular microelectrode recording techniques. All experiments were conducted using the extensor digitorum longus muscle isolated from male rats treated for 6 to 7 days with 1 mg/kg/day i.p. of DTB or with 0.9% NaCl (1 ml/kg/day) as control. End-plate potentials (EPPs) and miniature end-plate potentials (MEPPs) were recorded from single junctions of DTB-poisoned or NaCl-treated paired controls. Muscles were transected (\"cut muscle\") to prevent contraction after peroneal nerve stimulation. EPP amplitude was decreased at the time of observable muscle weakness in DTB-treated rats. Endplate resting membrane potential was not affected. Decreased EPP amplitude was associated with a decrease in mean quantal content. Quantal content was depressed to an equivalent extent in DTB-treated rats when stimulus frequency was increased from 0.5 to 2, 5, 25 and 50 Hz. However, as the stimulus frequency was increased, preparations from DTB-treated rats were characterized by failures of nerve impulses to elicit an EPP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

DMSO also has many effects on cell function and, although the precise mechanism of action is not known completely, it has been stated to exert its effect on transport solely through osmolality. The present study was designed to examine the effects of serosal DMSO at three osmolar concentrations on Basal Water Flow and vasopressin (AVP)- and cyclic AMP-stimulated water flow (Maximal Water Flow) in the toad bladder. The results obtained were compared to equi-osmolar concentrations of mannitol and NaCl. All three agents significantly enhanced Basal Water Flow after 60 min. The results obtained on Maximal Water Flow were different depending on the final osmolality. At 300 mOsm final concentration, all three agents increased AVP-stimulated water flow. When the serosal osmolality was 600 or 900 mOsm DMSO increased Maximal Water Flow, whereas mannitol and NaCl decreased it. When 300 mOsm DMSO plus 300 mOsm mannitol (600 mOsm total)-treated hemibladders were challenged with AVP, the water flow response was similar to that of 600 mOsm DMSO alone. In the presence of verapamil, AVP-stimulated water flow was decreased markedly; when DMSO was added to verapamil-pretreated hemibladders, and they were then challenged with AVP, water flow increased significantly. In similar experiments with mannitol, water flow remained inhibited. Dimethylsulfone did not enhance AVP-stimulated water flow as compared to the same concentration of DMSO. These results demonstrate that the effects of DMSO on water transport are not mediated solely by its osmolar action.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In rings of femoral and coronary arteries, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) (10(-7) M) evoked contraction (ED50 2.9 x 10(-8) M) and depressed endothelium-dependent relaxations to ACh (4-fold increase in ED50 and 72% depression of maximal response). PDBu depressed maximal relaxations to A23187 by 50% but had no effect on ED50. The inactive phorbol ester 4-alpha-phorbol didecanoate (10(-7) M) did not evoke contractions and had no effect on endothelium-dependent relaxations to ACh or A23187. Endothelium-independent relaxations to sodium nitroprusside were not effected by PDBu (10(-7) M) in femoral or coronary arteries. In bioassay experiments, selective treatment of perfused femoral artery segments with PDBu (10(-8)-10(-6) M) caused concentration-dependent inhibition of basal and ACh- (10(-6) M) and A23187-(10(-6) M) induced release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) (as assessed by relaxation of superfused bioassay coronary artery rings without endothelium).

Both the nitroimidazole drugs and hyperthermia produced additional tumor growth delays and tumor cell cytotoxicity when given with Fluosol-DA/carbogen, either before or after irradiation. For each of the modalities tested, the dose-modifying effect was greater when that therapy preceded rather than followed irradiation (misonidazole 2.7 vs. 1.9, etanidazole 2.4 vs. 1.7, hyperthermia 4.0 vs. 1.7 relative to the effect of radiotherapy alone). Because the nitroimidazole drugs must be present before radiation is administered to exert their radiosensitizing effect, the increase in tumor growth delay observed when these drugs cytotoxic to hypoxic cells were administered following Fluosol-DA/carbogen and irradiation suggests that Fluosol-DA/carbogen could not fully oxygenate the tumors and that the nitroimidazole drugs were effectively toxic to residual hypoxic cells. The treatment Fluosol-DA/carbogen----hyperthermia----irradiation produced a marked increase in tumor growth delay not seen with the sequence Fluosol-DA/carbogen----irradiation----hyperthermia. The results indicate that a treatment combination of radiation sensitizers may be more effective than irradiation plus Fluosol-DA with oxygen breathing alone.\r"

The lymphokines identified in the differentiation-inducing preparation were interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and lymphotoxin. To determine the remaining component(s) of this differentiation-inducing activity, we used gene-cloned (recombinant) forms and antibodies of lymphokines. The differentiation-inducing activity of the HUT-102 cells was not completely neutralized by the antibodies, suggesting that an additional lymphokine(s) is involved. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in combination with retinoic acid induced differentiation of the HL-60 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the activity of the differentiation-inducing factors was partially inhibited by anti-GM-CSF antibody and completely inhibited by the combination of antibodies to lymphotoxin, IFN-gamma, and GM-CSF. These results indicate that, in addition to IFN-gamma and lymphotoxin, GM-CSF is the third major component released by HUT-102 cells for inducing differentiation of HL-60 cells.\r"

For this purpose, we treated NIH 3T3 murine fibroblasts transformed by transfection with K-, Ha-, or N-ras oncogenes, either mutated or amplified, for 24 hours with IFN-gamma or IFN-alpha. We evaluated cell response by measuring virus replication, [3H]thymidine incorporation, 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase activation, and class I antigen induction. Transformed cells were much less responsive to IFN-gamma antiviral and antiproliferative activities than normal NIH 3T3 cells. Similarly, the induction of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase following IFN-gamma treatment was completely depressed in transformed cells. Only class I antigens, measured at the cell surface and mRNA levels, appeared partially inducible by IFN-gamma in ras-transformed cells. When the same cell lines were treated with IFN-alpha, we observed full response. Because both normal and ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells were able to bind [125I]IFN-gamma with comparable Kd values (8.3 X 10(-11) M vs. 3 X 10(-11) M, respectively), these findings suggest that ras oncogenes may differentially impair IFN-gamma activities by affecting activation of IFN-inducible genes downstream from the receptor binding event.\r"

From this finding, which uses an \"experimental metastasis\" model system, we considered: (a) whether swainsonine would be effective in the inhibition of authentic or spontaneous metastasis; (b) whether the drug would also inhibit metastasis formation in organs other than the lungs; and (c) whether the drug would block the metastasis of tumor cells of different histological type or origin. Our data indicated that swainsonine effectively inhibited the spontaneous metastasis of B16-BL6 melanoma (by 88%) and M5076 reticulum sarcoma (by 95%) murine tumor cells to the lung and liver, respectively. In both cases, the antimetastatic activity of the drug increased as a function of the concentration in drinking water up to 3 micrograms/mL. These findings indicate that the antimetastatic activity of swainsonine is not limited to artificial or experimentally induced metastasis nor to a single tumor type or specific organ. The inhibition of metastasis is likely due to a combination of events, which are currently under investigation.\r"

In this report, we show that swainsonine has antiproliferative activity against human tumor cells growing in tissue culture and as tumor xenografts in nude mice. The antiproliferative activity of swainsonine was additive with that of human interferon-alpha 2 (HuIFN-alpha 2) in cultures of HT29 colon carcinoma, SN12 renal carcinoma, and A375 melanoma cells. In vivo, the growth rate of HT29m human colon carcinoma tumors in athymic nude mice was reduced by supplementing their drinking water with swainsonine (49%) or by administering HuIFN-alpha 2 systemically (53%); combining these treatments reduced tumor growth by 78%. Combining swainsonine and HuIFN-alpha 2 treatments enhanced the activity of the interferon-inducible enzyme 2',5'-oligoadenylate [2',5'-oligo(A)] synthetase in HT29m tumors compared to that observed in tumors from mice treated with interferon alone. In vitro, swainsonine enhanced interferon-dependent induction of 2',5'-oligo(A) synthetase activity in low-density cultures of HT29m cells. However, swainsonine alone did not stimulate 2',5'-oligo(A) synthetase activity in vivo or in vitro, indicating that the antiproliferative effect of swainsonine is independent of interferon production. The results suggest that in addition to the previously reported antimetastatic activity of swainsonine, the plant alkaloid has antiproliferative activity that is independent from, but additive with, that of interferon in vivo and in vitro.\r"

Plasma atrial natriuretic factor concentration in patients with aldosterone-producing adenoma was the highest among the examined groups. Adrenal surgery reduced plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic factor and aldosterone concomitant with the elevation in urinary sodium excretion, plasma renin activity and urinary sodium-to-potassium ratio. Withdrawal of trilostane (3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor) in patients with idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia increased plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic factor and aldosterone, and decreased the urinary sodium-to-potassium ratio, plasma renin activity and urinary sodium excretion. However, reduced urinary sodium excretion following trilostane treatment returned to the control level successively despite the high levels of plasma atrial natriuretic factor and aldosterone. Acute infusion of saline remarkably increased plasma atrial natriuretic factor concentration in patients with idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia and aldosterone-producing adenoma. These results suggest that a high level of atrial natriuretic factor is a characteristic feature in patients with aldosterone-producing adenoma caused chiefly by the expansion of extracellular fluid volume, and circulating atrial natriuretic factor may contribute to regulation of the sodium escape phenomenon in patients with aldosterone-producing adenoma or idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia.\r"

  ".W": "Azoospermia is found in up to 10 to 20 per cent of the men who present to an infertility clinic. The main causes are testicular failure and ductal obstruction. Testicular biopsy remains the definitive test used to differentiate these 2 disorders. A retrospective study of 133 azoospermic men was performed to determine the accuracy and limitations of noninvasive variables in predicting testicular failure in an effort to limit the need for diagnostic testicular biopsy. Of 49 patients (37 per cent) with ductal obstruction a third had bilateral vasal agenesis. The remaining 84 azoospermic patients (63 per cent) had testicular failure. The results of the complete evaluation of these patients are described. Among the 101 patients with a testicular biopsy confirmed diagnosis there was a significant difference in testicular size (p less than 0.001), ejaculate volume (p less than 0.001) and serum follicle-stimulating hormone (p less than 0.001) between patients with testicular failure and those with ductal obstruction. The sensitivity and specificity of various parameters were determined. The best criteria to predict ductal obstruction preoperatively are a serum follicle-stimulating hormone level of less than 2 times greater than normal and the absence of bilateral testicular atrophy (100 per cent sensitivity and 71 per cent specificity). An algorithm for evaluation of the azoospermic patient is described such that all men with ductal obstruction and a minimal number with testicular failure undergo testicular biopsy.\r"

The diagnosis of protein-losing enteropathy should be considered for all patients with Cl difficile infection, particularly elderly nursing-home patients, in whom the risk of Cl difficile disease and the frequency of severe malnutrition are high.\r"

Highly concentrated solutions should be diluted with 60 ml of water. 6. When several medications are to be administered to the same patient, all medications should be delivered separately and the tube flushed with at least 5 ml of water after each dose. 7. Medications should not be added directly to the feeding formulation. 8. Drug-nutrient interactions should be considered. 9. GI side effects are the most common adverse effects that occur with enteral feedings, and treatment depends on the cause.\r"

Better definition of IV formulas with addition of stable glutamine dipeptides may be of benefit in patients at high risk for sepsis and significant skeletal muscle wasting, while use of met-hGH may improve nitrogen retention and whole-body net protein accrual under these circumstances. Chronic, low- to moderate-intensity exercise may be applicable in a select group of patients, particularly patients at risk for developing complications after surgical intervention in whom aggressive nutritional support has been shown to improve operative outcome.\r"

Tolerance, or better 'nonresponsiveness', to specific antigens can also be induced in adult animals but the mechanism(s) involved are not well understood. Most murine T-helper cells that express the V beta 6 T-cell receptor gene segment are specific for Mls-1a antigens. We have therefore been able to use an anti-V beta 6 monoclonal antibody to follow the fate of Mls-1a specific T cells in adult Mls-1b mice made specifically unresponsive to Mls-1a. We show that the induced unresponsiveness is not due to clonal deletion, but rather to clonal anergy. The anergic V beta 6 T-helper cells express IL-2 receptors and undergo limited blastogenesis in vitro upon stimulation, but do not produce IL-2, in marked contrast to V beta 6 cells from naive mice. Our data appear to represent an in vivo correlate for the induction of anergy that has been observed in T-cell lines in vitro.\r"

The assay measures the separate and combined efficiency of suppression at adjacent nonsense codons in vivo using a set of specially created homologous messages. In a survey of distal anticodon arm substitutions, we find that particular mutant tRNAs occupying the P-site reduce the apparent efficiency of the suppressor tRNA reading the A-site codon by factors of 2-170. By using measured tRNA-tRNA distances and the crystallographic tRNA structure, we propose a model of the tRNA-tRNA-mRNA complex. In the model, the anticodon loops of the P-site and A-site tRNAs contact one another in a way that is consistent with our combined tRNA efficiency data. These results suggest that tRNA-tRNA interactions that modulate tRNA action are an inevitable feature of translation.\r"

A mutation (azp-12) that confers resistance to the antimicrobial drug 6-(p-hydroxyphenylazo)-uracil is due to a single base change at nucleotide 3523, from TCA to GCA, resulting in a change of the 1175th amino acid, serine, to alanine. It is in the active site and located at the C-terminal part of the enzyme. The amino acid composition in an N-terminal domain has 26% homology to the epsilon subunit coded by the dnaQ gene of Escherichia coli, which is a 3'----5' proofreading exonuclease, supporting an earlier observation that this function is an integral part of the polymerase molecule in B. subtilis.\r"

Derived amino acid sequences of archaebacterial components A and C were aligned with each other and with the sequences of corresponding (largest) subunits from the archaebacterium Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, with sequences of various eukaryotic nuclear RNA polymerases I, II, and III, and with the sequence of the beta' component from E. coli polymerase. The archaebacterial genes for component A are homologous to about the first two-thirds of genes for the eukaryotic component A and the eubacterial component beta', and the archaebacterial genes for component C are homologous to the last third of the genes for the eukaryotic component A and the eubacterial component beta'. Unrooted phylogenetic dendrograms derived from both distance matrix and parsimony analyses show the archaebacteria are a coherent group closely related to the eukaryotic nuclear RNA polymerase II and/or III lineages. The eukaryotic polymerase I lineage appears to arise separately from a bifurcation with the eubacterial beta' component lineage.\r"

The normal BCL2 gene is quiescent in resting B cells, expressed in proliferating, but down-regulated in differentiated B cells. Inappropriately high levels of BCL2-immunoglobulin chimeric RNA are present in t(14;18) lymphomas for their mature B-cell stage. We examined the biologic effects of BCL2 deregulation in human B cells by introducing BCL2 into human B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) with retroviral gene transfer. Although deregulated BCL2 expression as a single agent was not sufficient to confer tumorigenicity to LCLs, it consistently produced a 3- to 4-fold increment in LCL clonogenicity in soft agar. In addition, BCL2 deregulation complements the transforming effects of the MYC oncogene in LCLs. BCL2 augmented the clonogenicity of LCLs bearing exogenous MYC and increased the frequency and shortened the latency of tumor induction in immunodeficient mice. These results demonstrate a role for BCL2 as a protooncogene that affects B-cell growth and enhances B-cell neoplasia.\r"

C12.3 and H12.3 encode exactly the same 317-residue-long protein. The sequence of 12.3 shows significant homology with the two known guanine nucleotide-binding protein beta subunits (GP beta 1 and GP beta 2) and other proteins that all share the same segmented structure with seven internal homologous repeats about 45 residues in length. Unlike the chicken gene, the human H12.3 gene and its mouse counterpart are not located on the same chromosome as the major histocompatibility complex. A possible involvement of the C12.3 gene product in major histocompatibility complex-linked control of lymphocyte proliferation in chickens is discussed.\r"

We have sequenced the DNA of four Kr alleles that show normal spatial and temporal patterns of Kr-encoded protein expression. Three of the four alleles have single base pair mutations that result in a single amino acid change. The exchanges occur in the putative DNA-binding domain of the Kr protein, which is characterized by four repeats of the zinc finger motif. Sequence comparison of the finger motifs helped to define the structural requirements for the folding of the finger domain to some extent.

(i) The antibodies arise from different genetic elements with very low or no homology--E7 from a heavy-chain variable region (VH) of family 36-60 and kappa light-chain variable region (V kappa) from a group 19--whereas D23 derives from a VH of family Q52 and V kappa derives from group 8. (ii) E7 and D23 are probably of germ-line origin, as suggested by high homology with VH genes from the unrearranged genome. Compared with the germ-line VH 1210.7 gene, E7 has a single nucleotide difference leading to a silent mutation at position 15, whereas D23 seems to be encoded by germ-line VH 101 with one nucleotide difference causing replacement of Ser-84 by Ala. (iii) The genetic V kappa and VH elements for E7 and D23 also give rise to different responses to phenyloxazolone, dinitrophenyl, 5-(dimethylamino)naphthalene-1-sulfonyl, arsonate, phosphocholine, and influenza virus hemagglutinin. Antibodies from normal and autoimmune mice with rheumatoid factor-like activity are also homologous to E7 and D23. These results indicate that polyreactive autoantibodies are encoded by germ-line genes and that, starting with the preimmune poly- and autoreactive repertoire, mutated forms of antibodies recognizing exogenous antigens can be obtained and selected.\r"

Development of a defined subunit vaccine is one means of trying to develop control measures against the disease. To this end we have characterized a surface antigen complex of the infective stage (sporozoite), by using a monoclonal antibody that neutralizes sporozoite infectivity in vitro. We have cloned the gene coding for this complex and have demonstrated that a fusion protein expressed from a fragment of this gene elicits strong neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore we provide data on the structure and expression of this gene. In particular we show that the region of the gene, expressed in one clone, codes for a protein segment relatively rich in proline residues. Also we demonstrate that expression of this gene appears to be stage specific, transcripts being present only in the sporoblast and sporozoite stages. The relevance of these findings to the production of a defined subunit vaccine is discussed.\r"

Comparisons of the sequences are consistent with the presence of mammalian-like framework and complementarity-determining regions. The predicted amino acid sequences of the genes are more related to mammalian lambda than to kappa light chains. The nucleotide sequences of the genes are most related to mammalian T-cell antigen receptor beta chain.

To study the evolutionary conservation of the 6-amino acid insert, the expression of pp60c-src+ in the brain of animals from different classes was assayed by using pp60c-src+-specific antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the insert. pp60c-src+ was detected only in the brain of mammals, birds, and reptiles, but not amphibians and fish, whereas pp60c-src was present in the brain of all animals tested, including lobster (invertebrate). These findings indicate that pp60c-src+ may play a role in events associated with higher brain function, such as neuronal plasticity.\r"

  ".U": "89282856\r", 
  ".W": "Neuromedin B (NB), a bombesin-like peptide, was first isolated from porcine spinal cord and subsequently found in the central nervous systems of rat, cat, and human. Immunocytochemical studies have shown that NB is present in hypothalamus and various other regions of the brain and in thyrotrophs of the anterior pituitary of the rat. The possible physiological role of NB in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis is not known. Therefore, we studied the in vivo effect of this peptide on the plasma levels of thyrotropin (TSH) after administering NB to conscious freely moving adult male rats. When injected i.v., only the highest dose of NB (50 micrograms, 44.2 nmol) significantly lowered plasma TSH levels relative to levels in saline controls. When injected intraventricularly, NB doses of 0.5 and 5 micrograms (0.44 and 4.42 nmol, respectively) lowered plasma TSH levels with a 15-min latency period. Responsiveness of the pituitary to TSH-releasing hormone (TRH) was tested after the effective dose of NB was administered i.v. The increase in plasma TSH levels after the i.v. injection of 1 microgram of TRH was not altered by NB. NB at 10(-9) to 10(-7) M also reduced TSH release from hemipituitaries incubated in vitro without decreasing the response to TRH. Consequently, NB appears to have a direct inhibitory effect on TSH release from thyrotrophs. Since the response to TRH was not depressed, NB appears to act on a separate NB thyrotroph receptor that suppresses TSH release by a TRH-independent mechanism. After antiserum directed against NB was injected into the third ventricle, there was a highly significant elevation of the plasma level of TSH, beginning at 4 hr and increasing at 6 hr, relative to initial levels and levels in normal rabbit serum-injected controls. These results indicate that NB has a tonic suppressive effect on TSH release and is a physiologically significant TSH-release-inhibitory factor.\r"

Two successive generations of pigs expressing the bGH gene showed significant improvements in both daily weight gain and feed efficiency and exhibited changes in carcass composition that included a marked reduction in subcutaneous fat. However, long-term elevation of bGH was generally detrimental to health: the pigs had a high incidence of gastric ulcers, arthritis, cardiomegaly, dermatitis, and renal disease. The ability to produce pigs exhibiting only the beneficial, growth-promoting effects of growth hormone by a transgenic approach may require better control of transgene expression, a different genetic background, or a modified husbandry regimen.\r"

We investigated the clinical significance of equivocal elevation of thyrotropin values with a normal thyroxine level and free thyroxine index in 31 patients evaluated with a thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation test and antithyroid antibody determinations. Patients were categorized as euthyroid or hypothyroid on the basis of TRH responsiveness. Of the 31 patients, 23 (74%) were hypothyroid, resulting in a positive predictive value as high as 81%. Eight of 21 hypothyroid patients (38%) had antimicrosomal antibodies, and only one euthyroid patient had antimicrosomal antibodies. We find that equivocally elevated thyrotropin values indicate primary hypothyroidism about 80% of the time. The combination of a mildly elevated thyrotropin level and antimicrosomal antibodies is seen almost exclusively in patients with thyroid failure.\r"

Over the five-year study period the number of patients (incidence per 10,000 hospital admissions) from whom Bacillus was isolated increased from 4.97 in 1981 to 12.5 in 1985. The incidence per 1,000 blood cultures also increased from 1.12 in 1981 to 2.33 in 1985. Review of the medical records of 78 of the 95 patients (82%) with positive cultures allowed retrospective classification of five isolates (6.4%) as clinically significant, 33 isolates (42.3%) as possibly significant, and 40 isolates (51.3%) as nonsignificant. Underlying diseases in patients with clinically significant Bacillus bacteremia included burn trauma in two, leukemia in one, carcinoma in one, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage in one. All isolates judged to be clinically significant and the majority of possibly significant isolates were B cereus. We conclude that the isolation of Bacillus species from blood cultures is clinically significant in 5% to 10% of cases, that the incidence of Bacillus bacteremia is increasing, and that burn trauma should be added to the list of conditions known to predispose to clinically significant Bacillus bacteremia.\r"

All isolates were susceptible by disk susceptibility testing (zone greater than or equal to 15 mm), and by microdilution testing in unsupplemented broth. The majority of isolates, however, were resistant in cation supplemented media. The clinical failures could be accounted for by factors other than netilmicin failure.

  ".U": "89285160\r", 
  ".W": "To determine the value of scintigraphic perfusion studies in evaluating pancreas transplant patients, we reviewed 56 of these studies in 22 patients who had 27 transplants. Seventeen patients underwent two or more studies. The perfusion studies were performed with 20 mCi (740 MBq) of 99mTc-DTPA injected as a bolus followed by eight to 16 serial 2-sec images and a 500,000-count immediate static image. Images were evaluated for (1) the time and intensity of pancreatic peak radioactivity relative to the time and intensity of the iliac arterial peak; (2) relative pancreatic to iliac arterial intensity on the static image; and (3) size, homogeneity, and definition of the pancreas. Clinical diagnoses at the time of scintigraphy of normal function (n = 36), rejection (n = 13), pancreatitis (n = 6), or arterial thrombosis (n = 1) were based on insulin requirement, urine amylase, serum glucose, serum amylase, response to therapy, cultures, CT, MR, sonography, scintigraphy with 67Ga or 111In-WBCs, percutaneous drainage results, angiography, surgery, and pathologic examination of resected transplants. Three 99mTc-DTPA perfusion studies showed no pancreatic perfusion, four showed decreasing perfusion on serial studies, and five showed progressive loss of definition of the pancreas on serial studies. Of the three patients with no detectable perfusion, one had a normally functioning transplant, one had arterial thrombosis with transplant infarction, and one had severe rejection with minimal function. Decreasing perfusion was associated with rejection in three patients and pancreatitis in one. Decreasing definition was seen in four patients with rejection and one with pancreatitis. We conclude that perfusion scintigraphy is useful, primarily when performed serially, although nonspecific for evaluating pancreas transplants.\r"

  ".U": "89285193\r", 
  ".W": "Nicorandil, although structurally a nitrate, differs from classic nitrates in several respects. It preferentially dilates resistive vessels. Its effect on venous return in dogs is not unanimously a decrease but rather an increase. In high doses or concentrations it suppresses myocardial contraction and ventricular automaticity, nearly sparing sinoatrial nodal automaticity and atrioventricular nodal conduction. It shortens the effective refractory period of myocardium. These cardiac effects of nicorandil have been explained by its mechanism of action as a potassium (K) channel activator. However, what part of the vascular effects of nicorandil this mechanism is responsible for has not been determined. BRL 34915 and pinacidil, nonnitrate vasodilators with a K-channel activator action, have essentially the same cardiovascular profile as nicorandil in isolated, blood-perfused canine heart preparations. In anesthetized, open-chest dogs the 2 K-channel activators decreased systemic blood pressure and increased venous return and cardiac output without elevating heart rate, unless the cardiodepressant effect emerged. The increase in venous return or cardiac output survived elimination of baroceptor functions. These results taken together with previous results on nicorandil suggest the following: (1) The property of nicorandil as a resistive vessel dilator highly selective for vasculature originates in its mechanism of action as a K-channel activator. The nonunanimous effect of nicorandil on venous return is a result of the opposing actions as a capacitive (action as a nitrate) and a resistive vessel dilator. Nicorandil, with its hybrid nature, is advantageous over specific K-channel activators and classic nitrates in therapeutic implications.\r"

Seven pigs in each of four groups in this study received only saline, or sucralfate (1 g every six hours), famotidine (40 mg per day), or misoprostol (200 micrograms every six hours). A Foley catheter was placed into a gastrectomy after bile duct ligation. Similar groups of sham-operated pigs were also prepared. After 48 hours, all saline-, famotidine-, or misoprostol-treated pigs showed severe macroscopic ulceration, whereas only two of those treated with sucralfate showed minimal macroscopic ulceration. Until now, only highly selective vagotomy has reduced ulceration caused by bile duct ligation. The present results suggest that acid inhibition is not the only important factor in healing bile duct ligation-induced peptic ulceration.\r"

Twelve years later, 6 years after discontinuation of estrogen treatment, the patient presented with severe hypogonadism, gynecomastia, and primary hypothyroidism. Testicular biopsies showed ghosts of seminiferous tubules with absence of Leydig cells, and prostatic biopsies showed atrophic acini without evidence of malignancy. Despite undetectable serum testosterone levels, serum gonadotropins were inappropriately normal and responded minimally to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) administration. Replacement therapy with levothyroxine did not correct gonadal dysfunction. Thus, prolonged estrogen therapy may result in irreversible testicular destruction and loss of the feed-back response of the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis.\r"

To determine whether the noted B cell abnormalities were primarily a feature of the disease endometriosis or its manifestations of infertility and pregnancy wastage, we investigated antibody profiles in 26 female patients with unexplained infertility (group A) and 24 patients with unexplained pregnancy wastage (group B) but without documented endometriosis. Group A and B patients exhibited an unusual incidence of gammopathies (10 of 26 patients in group A and 11 of 24 in group B), with a majority representing immunoglobulin M gammopathies. Mean immunoglobulin M values were significantly elevated in both groups (p less than 0.03 and p less than 0.05, respectively, Student t test), whereas immunoglobulin G was significantly increased only among group B patients (p less than 0.05, Student t test). Lupus anticoagulant by tissue thromboblastin inhibition test was abnormally elevated in 2 of 26 group A and 2 of 24 group B patients. Activated partial thromboplastin time values were abnormal in only 3 of 26 group A and 2 of 24 group B women. Immunoglobulin G, immunoglobulin M, and immunoglobulin A autoantibodies to two phospholipid antigens, five histones, and four polynucleotide autoantibodies were detected in 23 of 26 (88%) group A patients and 17 of 24 (70.8%) group B patients. We conclude that some patients with unexplained infertility and pregnancy wastage suffer from polyclonal B cell activation. It is therefore tempting to speculate that autoantibody abnormalities may be causally related to infertility and pregnancy loss.\r"

Ten patients, selected at random, received IV NTG 1 microgram.kg-1.min-1 (NTG group) and 10 others, IV saline (control group). Anesthetic induction consisted of midazolam 0.2 mg.kg-1, vecuronium 0.1 mg.kg-1, and 50% N2O in O2. ECG leads I, II, and V5 were monitored for ST segment changes. Single pass radionuclide angiocardiography (RNA) was performed at 5 times: prior to induction, prior to tracheal intubation, and at 1, 3.5, and 6 min following intubation. The presence of new regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMA) was determined from each RNA study as compared with the preinduction measurement. Apart from one patient in the control group who developed a new \"v\" wave after intubation, there was no evidence of ischemia by pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. No ECG evidence of ischemia was detected in any patient. Despite this, new regional wall motion abnormalities were observed in 3 patients in the control group and 1 patient in the NTG group. Blood pressure and heart rate responses of patients with new RWMA were not significantly different from other patients. The low incidence of ischemia in this population precludes a definitive statement regarding the efficacy of IV NTG, but the lower incidence of RWMA in the NTG group suggests a protective effect.\r"

A significant correlation (R = 0.94; P less than 0.001) was found between the magnitude of CO2 passage through the first chamber and the difference in temperature between the chambers. When the maximal absorptive capacity of soda lime was reached, the pH of the surface of soda lime granules was still too high to change the indicator color. Exhaustion of soda lime is more reliably recognized by measuring wall temperatures of the chambers than by observing color change of the soda lime granules.\r"

  ".W": "Twelve adult (nine men and three women) cardiac arrest patients were studied as they received CPR by a computerized Thumper to determine the influence of the applied chest compression force on blood flow (as assessed by the end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration) and arterial pressure. At the end of a resuscitation when the decision was made by the senior physician to cease resuscitative efforts, the applied force on the CPR Thumper was decreased from 140 to 0 pound-force (lbf) in 20-lbf increments at 30-second intervals. Radial artery cutdown blood pressure and end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) were recorded continuously. Arterial systolic blood pressure was linearly related (r = .59, P less than .0001) to applied force (systolic blood pressure, 31 +/- 6 mm Hg at 20 lbf to 60 +/- 7 mm Hg at 140 lbf). ETCO2 (r = .42, P less than .0001) was also linearly related to applied force (ETCO2, 0.7 +/- 0.1% at 20 lbf to 1.5 +/- 0.2% at 140 lbf). Diastolic pressure did not change significantly with change in applied force (17 +/- 2 mm Hg from 20 to 140 lbf). Our findings indicate that higher compression force than that currently recommended may improve arterial systolic pressure and flow in human beings receiving closed-chest compression during CPR.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine small intestinal mucosal structure and function in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. DESIGN: Prospective, consecutive sample study. SETTING: Referral-based medical clinics at a municipal and a university medical center. PATIENTS: Forty-five HIV-infected patients (44 men, 1 woman) with gastrointestinal complaints. INTERVENTIONS: All patients had esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Distal duodenal biopsy samples were examined morphometrically and by quantitative enzyme histochemical techniques. Immunohistologic studies were done to determine whether HIV antigen p24 was present. Biopsy and stool samples were examined for enteric pathogens and patients were evaluated for malabsorption. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Malabsorption was common in HIV-infected patients. In 15 of 38 patients mononuclear cells infected with HIV were found in the mucosa. In 15 of 25 patients there was no detectable lactase (beta-glucosidase) activity in the duodenal brush border; when measurable, lactase (beta-glucosidase) activity was decreased (P less than 0.02). Alkaline phosphatase activity was normal. Crypt depth was greater (P less than 0.05), villous surface area was slightly smaller, and mitotic figures per crypt were not different in HIV-infected patients compared with controls. Patients without additional intestinal infection had a reduced number of mitotic figures per crypt (P less than 0.05) and normal crypt depth. The reduction in mitotic figures was most pronounced in patients with mucosal HIV antigen p24. CONCLUSIONS: The HIV-infected patients with gastrointestinal symptoms show low-grade small bowel atrophy and a maturational defect in enterocytes, which may be caused exclusively by HIV. An additional intestinal infection can mask this mucosal atrophy.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To critically appraise four common uses of intravenous pyelography in adults. DATA IDENTIFICATION: We reviewed the literature on the use of intravenous pyelography for four clinical indications. STUDY SELECTION: We analyzed the literature to determine the proportion of intravenous pyelograms producing clinically useful information (yield) in four clinical situations. The best estimate of its accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) for associated pathologic findings was determined. The implications of using the test on the outcomes of patients and costs were evaluated. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: The yield of significant abnormalities in patients having prostatectomy is small; intravenous pyelography does not specifically indicate ureteral obstruction, and is not sensitive or specific enough for screening for urinary tract malignancies. Many false-positive results, little benefit, and significant costs can be expected. When used before hysterectomy, intravenous pyelography does not reduce injury to the ureters, and the yield of unexpected abnormalities is small. The use of the test to screen for unexpected anatomic abnormalities in adult women after urinary tract infections has not led to improved outcomes or prevention of impaired renal function. Acquired causes of obstruction will be suggested by the history or physical examination. In hypertensive adults, intravenous pyelography is not accurate enough in detecting renal artery stenosis or in predicting favorable outcomes of renal artery surgery. Also, large costs are generated by high false-positive rates, and candidates for successful surgery are not reliably identified. CONCLUSIONS: Selective use of intravenous pyelography is recommended for patients before prostatectomy or hysterectomy, in women after urinary tract infections, and in adults whose hypertension may have a renovascular cause. Use should be reserved for patients whose history and physical examination raise specific questions for which this test could provide an answer that would affect treatment.\r"

Postoperative intraocular pressure increases occurred much less frequently (6% versus 54%) and were milder in the group that received sodium chondroitin sulfate-sodium hyaluronate. Mean peak intraocular pressure was reached at 16 hours in both groups; peak pressure was 31.7% higher in the group that received sodium hyaluronate.

  ".W": "Ten patients with alcoholic chronic organic brain disease were categorized as having alcohol amnestic disorder, or Korsakoff's psychosis (n = 6), dementia associated with alcoholism (n = 3), or compensated alcoholic liver disease (n = 1). All patients had severe deficits in memory for recently acquired information (episodic memory). Patients with alcohol dementia also showed global intellectual decline, including decreased performance on measures of semantic (knowledge) memory and reduction in levels of cerebrospinal fluid somatostatin. In a 4-week double-blind crossover design, the serotonin-uptake blocker fluvoxamine maleate (100 to 200 mg/d) was found to improve episodic memory in only the patients with alcohol amnestic disorder. These improvements in memory were significantly correlated with reductions in levels of cerebrospinal fluid 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, suggesting that facilitation of serotonergic neurotransmission may ameliorate the episodic memory failure in patients with alcohol amnestic disorder.\r"

  ".W": "It has been hypothesized that enhancement of brain serotoninergic (5-HT) function is involved in the mechanism of action of some antidepressants. To test this, the prolactin response to intravenously administered tryptophan, a clinical measurement of 5-HT function, was assessed before and during antidepressant treatment. Depressed patients received the tricyclic desipramine hydrochloride (N = 24) or the 5-HT reuptake inhibitor fluvoxamine maleate (N = 30). The prolactin response was significantly enhanced after long-term treatment (4 weeks) but not as reliably increased after short-term (1-week) desipramine treatment. Fluvoxamine enhanced the prolactin response after both short- and long-term treatment. Enhancement of the prolactin response was not clearly correlated with clinical improvement. The results of this study are consistent with preclinical evidence of enhanced 5-HT function during treatment with these classes of antidepressants, but also indicate that enhanced 5-HT function is not a sufficient condition for antidepressant efficacy.\r"

Starting 2 days after anterior cruciate transection, GAGPS or saline was administered intraarticularly twice weekly for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, gross and histologic medial femoral condylar lesions had developed to a lesser degree in GAGPS-treated dogs than in saline-treated dogs. The uronic acid and hydroxyproline levels in cartilage were significantly higher in the GAGPS-treated dogs than in the saline-treated dogs. Levels of active and latent collagenase in the cartilage of GAGPS-treated dogs were lower than in the cartilage of saline-treated dogs. With GAGPS treatment, swelling of the cartilage, an indicator of collagen network integrity, remained near control levels. Although increased synthesis of proteoglycan and collagen may account for some of these results, we propose that one mechanism of action of GAGPS is its ability to decrease collagen degradation, either by decreasing the synthesis of collagenase or by directly inhibiting the production of collagenase in cartilage.\r"

  ".W": "In cultured human articular chondrocytes, addition of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) stimulated caseinase activity over the range of 10(-11) M to 10(-7) M and stimulated prostaglandin E (PGE) production over the range of 10(-10) M to 10(-7) M. Maximal stimulation was observed at 10(-8)M TNF alpha for both activities. Gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN) had a variable effect on PGE production and no significant effect on caseinase activity in articular chondrocyte cultures over a concentration range of 0.1-1,000 units/ml. Co-incubation of TNF alpha with gamma-IFN enhanced PGE production and decreased caseinase activity. Concentrations as low as 1 unit/ml of gamma-IFN had significant effects on TNF-stimulated production of PGE and on caseinase activity. Resorption of human articular cartilage was stimulated by TNF alpha (10(-7) M) and was inhibited by gamma-IFN (1,000 units/ml). It is possible that cartilage breakdown in vivo may be modulated by such interactions between cytokines.\r"

A third group of patients with suspected AMI never experienced chest pain. This group of patients who never experienced chest pain had a three times higher risk of death (P = .02) compared with patients whose chest pain persisted or recurred in the ED, and a 2.1 times greater risk of intervention (P = .01), a 5.2 times greater risk of life-threatening complication (P = .015), and a 7.9 times greater risk of death (P = .025) compared with patients whose chest pain resolved before arrival in the ED.

They were randomized into three groups as follows: 11 received penicillin, 22 received clindamycin, and 17 received no therapy. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci were isolated from 8 (40%) of 17 untreated patients, 4 (36%) of 11 patients treated with penicillin, and none of 22 patients treated with clindamycin. Twenty-one BLPB were isolated from 16 (94%) of 17 untreated patients, 11 BLPB from 9 (82%) of 11 patients treated with penicillin, and 7 BLPB from 7 (32%) of 22 patients treated with clindamycin compared with penicillin or no therapy. Of the 22 patients treated with clindamycin, 10 were younger than 12 years of age. The BLPB were eradicated in nine patients (90%). However, BLPB were eradicated only in 6 (50%) of the 12 patients who were aged 13 years and older. These data illustrate the efficacy of clindamycin therapy in eradicating group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, as well as BLPB, in recurrent inflamed tonsils, especially in persons aged 12 years old and younger.\r"

Over half of the men had first had intercourse before the age of 18 and over three quarters had done so before the age of 20. Age at first intercourse tended to be lower in more recent birth cohorts and in social classes III, IV, and V. Men in earlier birth cohorts tended to have had fewer heterosexual partners, both regular and casual, than those born more recently, but there were no social class or regional differences in the number of partners. Eight of the 480 men (1.7%, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 2.3%) stated that they had had homosexual intercourse, four of whom had had one casual homosexual partner. Only one man had had more than 25 homosexual partners. The number of men having had homosexual intercourse was lower than is widely thought. When possible, data were checked with national data or other surveys and thought to be accurate. The difficulties in collecting data of this nature are discussed.\r"

Five of the six trials included a high proportion of elderly patients. Most patients were bleeding from peptic ulcers in the stomach and duodenum (43-88%) or gastric erosions (4-23%). A variable proportion had a degree of clinical shock at entry. INTERVENTIONS--Tranexamic acid 3-6 g/day given intravenously for two or three days followed by 3-6 g/day by mouth for a further three to five days (four trials) or 4.5-12 g/day by mouth for two to seven days (two trials). END POINTS--Frequency of recurrent haemorrhage, need for surgery, and death. MAIN RESULTS--Treatment with tranexamic acid was associated with a 20-30% reduction in the rate of rebleeding, a 30-40% reduction (95% confidence interval 10% to 60%) in mortality.

DESIGN--Prospective study over an average of nine years. SETTING--Community based health survey of middle aged men carried out at the University of Uppsala. SUBJECTS--Seventy three hypertensive men aged 49-54 and 65 normotensive controls matched for body mass index, glucose disappearance rate (k value) at an intravenous glucose tolerance test, and serum triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations. INTERVENTIONS--Hypertensive group was treated with beta blockers, thiazides, hydralazine, or combinations of these drugs. Treatment was not randomised. MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS--Intravenous glucose tolerance, fasting blood glucose and serum lipid and insulin concentrations, body weight and height, three skinfold measurements, and blood pressure were recorded both during an initial health screening survey in 1970-3 and at a follow up survey in 1980-3. In the period between the two surveys 12 hypertensive men and two controls developed diabetes. Review of values obtained at the initial survey showed that the hypertensive men who developed diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance could be distinguished from those hypertensive men who did not by virtue of a higher fasting serum insulin concentration (26.1 v 15.2 mU/l (confidence interval of difference -15.2 to -6.2)), a lower peak serum insulin concentration (78.9 v 94.3 mU/l (confidence interval of difference -1.1 to 41.1)), and a lower k value (1.29 v 1.68 (confidence interval of difference -0.02 to 0.68)). The insulin index (peak insulin concentration divided by fasting insulin concentration), however, decreased significantly in the hypertensive men over time irrespective of whether they developed diabetes but did not change in the controls. Furthermore, the serum triglyceride concentration increased in the treated group and decreased in the controls. CONCLUSION--A severalfold difference in the incidence of diabetes between treated hypertensive and non-treated, normotensive men may be a consequence of the treatment, which may be particularly deleterious in men predisposed to diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To compare the effects of metoprolol and atenolol on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and on insulin response to an intravenous glucose load. DESIGN--Randomised, double blind, double dummy, controlled crossover trial. SETTING--University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden. PATIENTS--60 Patients with primary hypertension (diastolic blood pressure when resting supine 95-119 mm Hg on at least two occasions during four to six weeks of treatment with placebo) randomised to receive either metoprolol (n = 30) or atenolol (n = 30) during the first treatment period. INTERVENTIONS--Placebo was given for a run in period of four to six weeks. Metoprolol 100 mg twice daily or atenolol 25 mg twice daily was then given for 16 weeks. The two drugs were then exchanged and treatment continued for a further 16 weeks. END POINT--Evaluation of effects of treatment with metoprolol and atenolol on glucose, insulin, and lipid metabolism and glucose disposal mediated by insulin. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Reduction of blood pressure was similar and satisfactory during treatment with both drugs. Glucose uptake mediated by insulin was measured during a euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp to evaluate patients' sensitivity to insulin. Glucose uptake decreased from 5.6 to 4.5 mg/kg/min when patients were taking metoprolol and from 5.6 to 4.9 mg/kg/min when they were taking atenolol. Both drugs caused a small increase in fasting plasma insulin and blood glucose concentrations and glycated haemoglobin concentration. Despite decreased sensitivity to insulin the increase in insulin concentration in response to an intravenous glucose tolerance test was small, suggesting inhibition of release of insulin. Very low density lipoprotein and low density lipoprotein triglyceride concentrations were increased with both drugs and high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration was decreased. Low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration was not affected. CONCLUSIONS--Long term use of metoprolol and atenolol causes metabolic abnormalities that may be related to the increased incidence of diabetes in patients with hypertension who are treated pharmacologically. These results may help to explain why the two drugs have failed consistently to reduce the incidence of coronary heart disease in several large scale studies.\r"

The largest reduction was found in outbreaks from children's units and maternity units. Fifty seven (24%) outbreaks were considered to be due to foodborne salmonellosis, and 70 (30%) were reported as person to person spread of the infection. The psychiatric hospital was the type of hospital in which foodborne outbreaks most often occurred, but the risk of being affected in an outbreak not due to food seemed to be highest in maternity units. Better control of infection and better surveillance should lead to earlier investigation and control of outbreaks.\r"

PATIENTS--Sixty patients aged 18-76 who required mechanical ventilation. INTERVENTIONS--Sedation with either 0.1-0.6% isoflurane in an air-oxygen mixture (30 patients) or a continuous intravenous infusion of midazolam 0.01-0.20 mg/kg/h (30 patients). Sedation was assessed initially and hourly thereafter on a six point scale. Incremental intravenous doses of morphine 0.05 mg/kg were given for analgesia as required. The trial sedative was stopped when the patient was judged ready for weaning from ventilatory support or at 24 hours (whichever was earlier). END POINT--Achievement of a predetermined level of sedation for as much of the time as possible. MAIN RESULTS--Isoflurane produced satisfactory sedation for a greater proportion of time (86%) than midazolam (64%), and patients sedated with isoflurane recovered more rapidly from sedation. CONCLUSION--Isoflurane is a promising alternative technique for sedation of ventilated patients in the intensive care unit.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine whether inhaling fully humidified air at 43 degrees C gave more benefit to cold sufferers than inhaling air at 30 degrees C. DESIGN--Randomised double blind trial. Setting--General practice and the common cold research unit. SUBJECTS--87 Unselected patients with typical acute nasal and upper respiratory symptoms (general practice study), and 84 volunteers aged 18-50 without a history of chronic or allergic diseases. INTERVENTIONS--Subjects breathed from apparatus delivering 40 litres of room air heated to 43 degrees C or 30 degrees C and fully humidified (relative humidity 100%) per minute. End point--Reduction in severity of disease. MEASUREMENTS and main results--Patients recorded their symptoms (general practice study) and observers recorded symptoms and signs, weight of nasal secretions, isolation of virus, and antibody responses in volunteers. Patients treated for 20 minutes at 43 degrees C had in the succeeding days roughly half the score for symptoms of those treated at 30 degrees C. Volunteers treated for 30 minutes on three occasions when they were starting a cold showed an 18% [corrected] reduction in symptoms. Treatment of volunteers for 20 minutes at the onset of the cold and for 10 minutes on succeeding days showed no difference between 43 degrees C and 30 degrees C. CONCLUSIONS--Nasal hyperthermia can improve the course of a common cold and also give immediate relief of symptoms.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effect of nutritional state on persistent diarrhoea a case-control study was carried out on 756 children followed up prospectively for 18 months. Children who developed persistent diarrhoea were compared with population controls and controls with acute diarrhoea. The mean weight for age in the children with persistent diarrhoea (69.9%) was significantly lower than that in the population controls (77.0%) and the diarrhoeal controls (76.2%). Weight for age of less than or equal to 70% was associated with persistent diarrhoea in both case-control analyses (population controls, matched odds ratio 3.25; diarrhoeal controls, matched odds ratio 2.46). The corrected odds (multiple logistic regression) in the two analyses were 3.2 (95% confidence interval 1.3 to 8.1) and 3.4 (1.2 to 9.1). Weight for age of less than or equal to 70% increases the risk of persistent diarrhoea. In an underweight child there is a higher risk of diarrhoea becoming persistent. Prevention of malnutrition and intensive management of acute diarrhoea in malnourished children should help reduce the risk of the diarrhoea persisting.\r"

  ".U": "89287588\r", 
  ".W": "Many studies have shown smokers to weigh less than non-smokers, which is plausible given the metabolic effects of cigarette smoke. The interrelation between smoking and relative body weight and its change over time were analysed by using data from Finnish population based surveys from 1982 and 1987. Among both men and women the inverse association between smoking and body mass index was clearly weakened between 1982 and 1987. In 1987 among men aged 25-44 smoking was positively related to body mass index. Moreover, the relation between smoking and waist to hip girth ratio was positive in both sexes at all ages. Years of smoking was nevertheless confirmed as a significant inverse predictor of relative weight. A cluster of unfavourable health habits, including high consumption of alcohol and saturated fats, especially emerged among younger smokers. This may have been due to different selection of smokers in Finland, where smoking increasingly seems to be a form of deviant or risk taking behaviour. It is concluded that at a population level the metabolic effects of smoking seem to be increasingly overridden by several other unfavourable health behaviours of smokers.\r"

All eight patients had responded clinically to splenectomy either alone or in combination with alpha-2b-interferon (alpha-IFN) therapy. For each sample, cytofluorimetric analysis showed distinct, and in six cases multiple, heavy chain isotypes. After short-term culture in the presence of alpha-IFN or gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN), samples from four patients displayed characteristic changes in surface immunoglobulin (sIg) expression. When compared with untreated cells, cells co-cultured with alpha-IFN or gamma-IFN showed in four and three patients, respectively, changes that were consistent with a shift to the more mature stage in B-cell ontogeny. However, in parallel with the changes in the sIg isotypes, treatment with IFN did not induce the appearance of cIg nor did the staining patterns for moAb to CD5, CD19, CD20, and CD22 antigens indicate the induction of terminal maturation. These data suggest that hairy cell leukemia (HCL), a neoplasm of \"mature\" B-cells, is potentially susceptible to maturation stimuli. Based on these findings, it might be of interest to examine whether co-factors, which have proved to play a role in HCL (e.g., B-cell growth factor [BCGF]), are capable of further enhancing IFN-induced differentiation.\r"

Patients were classified at diagnosis as being at high nutritional risk (HNR, n = 19) or low nutritional risk (LNR, n = 12). Ten HNR patients were randomized to central parenteral nutrition (CPN) and nine HNR patients were randomized to peripheral parenteral nutrition (PPN) plus enteral nutrition (EN) for 4 weeks of initial intense treatment and EN (nutritional counseling, oral foods and supplements) thereafter. Thirteen HNR patients (seven CPN, six PPN) completed the protocol. Twelve LNR patients received EN; 11 Stage I malnourished patients were randomized to 10 or 26 weeks of chemotherapy. Dietary, anthropometric, and biochemical data were determined for HNR patients at weeks 0-4, 6, 13, 19, and 26 and for LNR patients at weeks 1, 2, 5, and 26. In HNR patients, adequate parenteral nutrition support reversed protein energy malnutrition (PEM), and prevented chemotherapy and radiotherapy delays due to granulocytopenia. CPN was superior to PPN in reversing PEM: energy intake, weight gain, and retinol binding protein were higher (P less than 0.05). LNR patients lost weight and fat reserves in the first 2 weeks of treatment; depletion persisted at week 5, and 25% had chemotherapy delays. Thereafter, EN reversed PEM in patients with both chemotherapy regimens. These data suggest that CPN is preferable during initial intense treatment for HNR patients, and that, although EN is ineffective in preventing depletion and treatment delays in the first 5 weeks of treatment for LNR patients, it is effective thereafter.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of the present study was to correlate in cardiomyopathic hamsters with congestive heart failure the levels of atrial and ventricular atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) messenger RNA (mRNA) with immunoreactive ANF (IR-ANF) plasma levels and the relative amount of IR-ANF released by the whole heart versus isolated ventricles in the Langendorff preparation. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis of the forms of ANF present in plasma and in the Langendorff effluent of whole heart versus isolated ventricles was also performed. As previously found for cardiac IR-ANF, the levels of ANF mRNA decreased gradually in atria and increased in an analogous fashion in ventricles with the severity of congestive heart failure. Plasma IR-ANF levels (C-terminal) were more elevated in moderate than in severe congestive heart failure, as were the IR-ANF levels in the Langendorff effluent of the whole heart. On the contrary, the effluent of isolated ventricles from animals in severe heart failure yielded more IR-ANF than that from hamsters in moderate heart failure. Thus, while the isolated ventricles from controls contributed 35.8% of IR-ANF released by the whole heart, ventricles from hamsters in moderate heart failure contributed 17.5%, and those from hamsters in severe heart failure contributed 73.9%. These results indicate that atrial cardiocytes contribute more IR-ANF than their ventricular counterpart in moderate heart failure and that ventricles are a major source of plasma IR-ANF in severe heart failure. Analysis of IR-ANF from plasma and the Langendorff effluent from whole hearts and isolated ventricles revealed that the ventricles are the major source of the propeptide (and of its cleaved products) found in the circulation of cardiomyopathic hamsters. These results suggest that ANF synthesis and secretion do not increase conjointly in atria but do increase in ventricles during congestive heart failure.\r"

  ".W": "Platelet activation is markedly increased during coronary thrombolysis and limits the response to thrombolytic therapy. A possible mediator of platelet activation in this setting is thromboxane (TX) A2, a potent platelet agonist formed in greatly increased amounts during coronary thrombolysis in man. To address this hypothesis, we examined the role of TXA2 in modulating the response to intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) in a chronic canine model of coronary thrombosis. Reperfusion occurred in 60 +/- 5 minutes and was complicated by spontaneous reocclusion. The times to reperfusion and reocclusion were platelet-dependent. Consistent with a role for TXA2 in this process, TXA2 biosynthesis, determined a excretion of its enzymatic metabolite, 2,3-dinor-TXB2, was markedly increased during coronary thrombolysis. Furthermore, inhibition of TXA2 by aspirin, given alone or in combination with a TXA2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor antagonist, accelerated reperfusion and partly inhibited cyclic flow variations during reperfusion. The delay in reperfusion and reocclusion induced by TXA2 appeared to be mediated by platelet aggregation since the F(ab')2 fragment of 7E3, a monoclonal antibody to the platelet GPIIb/IIIa, also accelerated reperfusion and prevented reocclusion without altering TXA2 biosynthesis. These finding suggest that platelet aggregation limits the response to coronary thrombolysis and that platelet activation in this setting is partly TXA2-dependent.\r"

Patients with acute and chronic renal failure showed significantly elevated basal ANP concentrations (138.67 +/- 12.88 and 295.8 +/- 21.87 pg/ml, respectively) as compared with normals (74.54 +/- 4.1 pg/ml) and significantly elevated PRA (20.85 +/- 3.24 and 6.60 +/- 0.94 ng/ml/h, respectively versus 2.33 +/- 0.31 ng/ml/h), plasma levels of Ald (16.11 +/- 1.26 and 18.11 +/- 1.58 ng/dl, respectively versus 12.71 +/- 1.03 ng/dl) and AVP (6.95 +/- 0.62 and 6.08 +/- 0.54 pg/ml, respectively versus 2.68 +/- 0.48 pg/ml). After 2 hrs of WI a significant decline of PRA, Ald and AVP but an increase of ANP was noted in all examined groups. The absolute WI-induced increase in plasma ANP was significantly less marked in uremic patients than in normals. The endocrine profile of patients with ARF differed only quantitatively from that of patients with CRF both under basal and WI conditions. WI was followed by a significant increase of PV which was significantly more marked in patients with ARF (+ 16.42 +/- 1.73%) than in CRF (10.57 +/- 0.37%) and in normals (+11.3 +/- 1.6%). Only in healthy subjects a significant correlation was found between WI-induced changes of PV and ANP, PRA and Ald, and between PRA and AVP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Survival, length of stay, age, actual hospital cost, and reimbursement were evaluated retrospectively for 81 Medicare patients transported by the team to a tertiary care facility during a 33-month period. All patients had acute, nontraumatic, medical/surgical illnesses, primarily cardiac. Forty-four (54%) patients were discharged home alive. Average hospital cost per patient was $36,059.00, average Medicare reimbursement was $13,802.00, and average hospital loss was $22,256.00. We show that regionalization to tertiary care facilities can facilitate access to critical care technology, but the Medicare reimbursement system of diagnosis-related groups makes this concept financially prohibitive for the tertiary care hospital.\r"

  ".W": "Enteral nutrition is usually administered with premixed formulas and in a volume determined by the estimated total caloric need of the patient. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the nutritional outcome when isocaloric amounts of three commercial products were given as enteral nutrition in hypermetabolic surgical ICU patients. To qualify for the study, the patients had to be hypermetabolic and must have received and retained the volume of enteral formula estimated to meet energy and nutritional requirements for at least eight consecutive days. Caloric needs were defined as 30 to 35 total cal/kg.day. All data were prospectively collected; all patients had moderate to high-level metabolic stress after surgical intervention. Thirty-five patients participated in the study: 18 received a formula that was 23% amino acids, 20% fat, and had a nonprotein calorie/nitrogen (NPC/N) ratio of 97:1; ten patients received a formula with NPC/N 125:1 that was 17.5% protein and 35% fat; and seven patients received a formula with an NPC/N of 149:1 that was 15.3% amino acids and 2.5% fat. All formulas were given via nasoduodenal tube by continuous pump technique. Patients who received the low NPC/N had significantly greater N retention (p less than .05), increased plasma transferrin levels (p less than .05), and a lower RQ (p less than .05). There was a strong correlation between NPC/N and N retention and the increase in plasma transferrin levels. Thus, dosing enteral nutrition by total estimated caloric need does not presume optimal nutritional outcome. Formula composition is an important determinant of nutritional effect; formulas that have a lower NPC/N with more N and reduced calories as glucose demonstrate better nutritional results.\r"

Animal studies, including hypoproteinemic, volume-expanded rats, demonstrated that the protein hydrolysate of a peptide enteral formula was responsible for the enhanced absorption. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the composition of small MW peptides (protein hydrolysate) in two commercially available peptide enteral formulas would affect the rate of intestinal absorption and albumin clearance in intact jejunal loops before and during hypoproteinemia induced by iv infusion of Tyrode's solution in Sprague-Dawley rats. Net transmucosal water movement was calculated using a volume recovery method; albumin clearance was calculated using iv radiolabeled albumin. We studied three groups of animals during luminal perfusion with either Tyrode's solution, diet A containing 21% peptides, or diet B containing 56% peptides. When compared to luminal perfusion with Tyrode's solution (control animals), both diets significantly enhanced net transmucosal water absorption before volume expansion (p less than .05). With the induction of hypoproteinemia, diet B continued to stimulate water absorption when compared to control animals (p less than .01). Luminal perfusion with diet A failed to attenuate net water secretion induced by hypoproteinemia. Capillary and mucosal albumin clearance was similar for all groups studied. These findings suggest the percentage of small MW peptides may affect the rate of intestinal absorption in patients with acute kwashiorkor-like hypoalbuminemia.\r"
