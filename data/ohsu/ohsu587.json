On follow-up, almost 90% of the patients had visual acuity of 20/40 or better. The rest had poor visual acuities initially. The patient population was divided into three groups according to treatment. Group I included 65 patients treated aggressively with mechanical and pharmaceutic measures to reduce intraocular pressure and with anti-platelet drugs. Group II was composed of 81 patients treated only with antiplatelet agents given chronically. Group III (41 patients) received no treatment and represented the control group. No statistically significant difference in visual outcome was found on comparison of these three groups of patients. In this study we observed that 98% of the BRAO cases involved the temporal arteries. Emboli were documented in 125 eyes (62%). Systemic hypertension was common (132 patients or 71%). Although BRAO appears to be a relatively benign disease, its association with severe systemic conditions and documented increase in patient mortality suggests the need for careful evaluation by ophthalmologists.\r"

Visual acuity was maintained or improved in all eyes. Color vision also improved significantly. A dramatic and significant decrease of the chronic vitreous haze occurred within the first two weeks of therapy and persisted until the end of the study. Retinal inflammation, including hemorrhages, exudates, edema, and fluorangiographic abnormalities, decreased progressively in all eyes. The severity of the anterior and posterior acute attacks also decreased significantly.

Primary keratocyte populations bound lymphocytes, and there was subsequent keratocyte dye uptake. Corneal epithelium did not show either binding or lymphocyte-mediated cytolysis. These data suggest that nonspecific and spontaneous lymphocyte-mediated cytolysis of keratocytes occurs in vitro and that the responsible lymphocyte subpopulation has functional activities and cellular morphology characteristic of the natural-killer cell.

  ".W": "Dysfunction of the central serotonergic system has been variously associated with depression and with suicidal and/or impulsive aggressive behavior. To evaluate central serotonergic function in relation to these variables, prolactin responses to a single-dose challenge with fenfluramine hydrochloride (60 mg orally), a serotonin releasing/uptake-inhibiting agent, were examined in 45 male patients with clearly defined major affective (n = 25) and/or personality disorder (n = 20) and in 18 normal male control patients. Prolactin responses to fenfluramine among all patients were reduced compared with responses of controls. Reduced prolactin responses to fenfluramine were correlated with history of suicide attempt in all patients but with clinician and self-reported ratings of impulsive aggression in patients with personality disorder only; there was no correlation with depression. These results suggest that reduced central serotonergic function is present in a subgroup of patients with major affective and/or personality disorder and is associated with history of suicide attempt in patients with either disorder, but with impulsive aggression in patients with personality disorder only.\r"

The baseline intracellular calcium ion concentration was significantly increased in platelets from patients with mania compared with controls. The free intracellular calcium ion concentration after stimulation with platelet-activating factor and thrombin was significantly higher in platelets of manic and bipolar depressed patients than in all other groups. The degree to which intracellular calcium ion concentration increased over baseline after stimulation was significantly lower in unipolar than in bipolar patients. These findings suggest that platelets of manic and depressed bipolar patients have a similar enhancement of intracellular calcium ion activity that is distinctly different from the decreased ability of platelets of unipolar patients to mobilize intracellular calcium in response to stimulation.\r"

The overall probability of continuing to take MTX was 71.2% at 1 year, 55.5% at 3 years, 50% at 5 years, and 49% at 6 years. By univariate analysis, patients who started MTX therapy later in the study, American blacks, younger patients, those with less severe disease, and those with less frequent or less severe toxic events appeared to have a better probability of continuing the drug therapy. When these parameters were evaluated by multivariate analysis, only the time when MTX was started and the occurrence of toxic effects independently influenced the probability of continuing MTX. Thus, by current practice standards, toxic effects emerge as the main reason for MTX discontinuation.\r"

Serum levels of MTX at 1 hour and at 24 hours after drug administration were obtained at each dosage level and every 3 months after a stable dosage was achieved. No patient had serum levels of MTX that were in the toxic range nor evidence of hematologic, skin, mucous membrane, gastrointestinal, or pulmonary abnormalities. Ten patients had transiently elevated serum transaminase levels. Arthritis symptoms improved in 21 of these JRA patients, and the improvement was significantly associated with a mean 1-hour serum MTX level of greater than or equal to 5.8 x 10(-7)M (P = 0.008) and a dosage of greater than or equal to 0.3 mg/kg/week (P = 0.004). The 1-hour serum level of MTX was correlated with the MTX dosage (r = 0.28, P = 0.005). Our observations suggest that with close monitoring, MTX can be used safely at dosages as high as 0.6 mg/kg/week, and improvement in the symptoms of JRA will become evident when the serum levels of MTX 1 hour after administration approach 6.0 x 10(-7)M.\r"

Significant enhancement of DR antigen expression (P = 0.01), with values similar to those of normal monocytes, occurred in patient monocytes preincubated at 37 degrees C overnight, but not in monocytes preincubated at 4 degrees C. This suggested that a temperature-dependent metabolic process is required to enhance antigen expression. The addition of cycloheximide totally inhibited the enhancement of DR antigen density. Incubation of monocytes with exogenous prostaglandin E2 (10(-5)M final concentration) caused a reduction of DR densities on control and on RA monocytes, although this decrease was more marked in the controls. Addition of indomethacin did not affect DR antigen levels on control monocytes, but greatly enhanced the expression of DR antigens on RA monocytes. When HLA-DR antigen levels were estimated in detergent-solubilized membrane preparations, monocytes from patients with active RA demonstrated normal-to-increased densities compared with control monocytes. Thus, although RA monocytes possess a normal ability to synthesize DR molecules, surface expression of these molecules is inhibited; this inhibition may be mediated by prostaglandin E2 acting as a negative suppressive signal.\r"

F(ab')2 fragments from the anti-Id antibodies were generated by pepsin digestion and isolated by gel filtration. The anti-Id antibodies directed against RF from 4 patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) were tested by an inhibition hemolytic assay for cross-reactivity with IgM-RF from 4 adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 6 patients with JRA, and 13 JRA patients with hidden RF. The 4 anti-Id antibodies had variable cross-reactivity with the isolated adult RA RF, JRA RF, and JRA hidden RF. Similar results were obtained by a direct-binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the anti-Id antibodies. The broad pattern of cross-reactivity was apparently unrelated to a particular amino acid sequence, but was associated with the antigen-binding site of IgM-RF. These results suggest the possibility that the anti-Id antibodies prepared against isolated RF obtained from JRA patients bear the \"internal image\" of antigen; that is, the Fc region of human IgG. These anti-Id antibodies may be generated in JRA patients and may possess specific immunomodulatory properties.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effectiveness of 2 models of arthritis self-care intervention, the home study model and the small group model. The effects of disease diagnosis and duration, self-care behavior, perceived helplessness, social support, treatment choice, and formal education level on outcomes among persons with arthritis who participated in these programs were evaluated. A pretest-posttest control group design was utilized in the initial experimental study; comparison group designs were used in the longitudinal studies. Three hundred seventy-four subjects completed the interventions and 12 months of research followup. We found that the intervention models had a statistically significant positive impact on arthritis knowledge, self-care behavior, perceived helplessness, and pain. These findings did not vary when the effects of education level, disease diagnosis and duration, informal social support, and treatment choice were controlled. The small group intervention was more effective in bringing about initial improvements in pain and depression, whereas the home study intervention was more effective in maintaining improvements in perceived helplessness. Changes in perceived helplessness and self-care behavior appear to explain in part the observed improvement in pain.\r"

  ".U": "89286674\r", 
  ".W": "The benefit of high-dose, pulse intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) for some patients with active lupus nephritis would appear paradoxical, since active nephritis is associated with profound abnormalities in Fc gamma receptor function, and several studies have demonstrated that glucocorticoids decrease monocyte Fc gamma receptor expression and phagocytic function. To resolve this paradox, we investigated the possibility that pulse IVMP might enhance monocyte Fc gamma receptor function in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Circulating immune complex (CIC) levels, Fc gamma receptor-mediated clearance, and Fc gamma receptor-dependent monocyte function were analyzed in 23 SLE patients before and after pulse IVMP (1 gm daily for 3 days). A biphasic response in CIC levels, determined by a staphylococcal protein A binding assay, was observed. Initially, CIC levels increased within 2-4 hours after the first dose of pulse IVMP and then decreased by 50% within 24-48 hours after the completion of therapy. Fc gamma receptor-mediated binding and phagocytosis of IgG-sensitized erythrocytes (EA) by monocytes in vitro were significantly enhanced 24 hours after the final dose of pulse IVMP (pre-IVMP versus post-IVMP 43 +/- 14% versus 53 +/- 12% EA rosettes, P less than 0.01; 3.00 +/- 1.04 versus 3.99 +/- 1.30 EA ingested/monocyte, P less than 0.01). In contrast, there was no change in the phagocytosis of an Fc gamma receptor-independent probe, neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The clinical characteristics of both groups of patients were similar, and 2 patients have had excellent responses to treatment. Although inclusion body myositis represents a histologic subset of polymyositis, from a clinical perspective, it must be considered a nonspecific designation. Despite a generally poor prognosis, therapeutic intervention is still warranted.\r"

All 10 females developed overt arthritis and produced antibodies to CII and cross-reactive antibodies to monkey type II collagen (MkII). In contrast, only 1 male monkey developed arthritis, which was transient and mild in severity. Examination of antisera obtained from the male monkeys disclosed high titers of antibody to CII, but little antibody to MkII. The cyanogen bromide peptide recognition patterns varied markedly from animal to animal, implying that monkeys are capable of recognizing multiple arthritogenic determinants on CII.\r"

We reviewed the records of 25 consecutive patients treated with low-dose MTX, and found 5 who had spontaneously reported unpleasant cranial sensations, mood alteration, or memory impairment. Rechallenge with MTX on 5 occasions in 3 patients led to recurrent CNS symptoms in all cases. CNS toxicity was the sole reason for discontinuation of MTX in 2 patients. These 5 patients differed from the 20 without CNS toxicity in age (mean 68 versus 50) and baseline serum creatinine level (1.3 mg/dl versus 0.9 mg/dl), but not in weekly dosage of MTX (12 mg versus 16 mg). These results suggest that CNS toxicity is more common than previously reported, particularly in older patients with mild renal insufficiency.\r"

Arthritis became chronic and led to severe joint damage more often in 18-month-old female mice, compared with both young adult female mice and with male mice of both ages. T cell immunity and levels of antibodies against methylated bovine serum albumin were comparable in all groups. Antigen retention in the joint was greater in old compared with young adult mice of both sexes, and could therefore not entirely explain the increased prevalence of persistent arthritis in old females. Our data suggest that female hormones, in combination with age, are important factors in the chronicity and destructive character of this type of arthritis.\r"

The average time to perform lavage was 21.1 minutes for open lavage, 14.7 minutes for Lazarus-Nelson closed lavage, and 9.8 minutes for Cook closed lavage. The closed technique using the Cook catheter was significantly faster than open lavage. Technical difficulties were significantly less frequent with Cook catheter closed lavage than with Lazarus-Nelson catheter closed lavage. The overall complication rate was 1.8%, and the overall accuracy was 98.1%, without apparent difference among techniques. It is concluded that, when no contraindications to closed lavage exist, and when time is of importance, closed lavage with the Cook catheter is the preferred technique.\r"

We used a canine cardiac arrest model to study the hemodynamic effects of the IABP during closed-chest CPR. A sensor attached to the chest plate of a Thumper was used to time a Datascope Model 3520 ventricular assist console such that the balloon inflated on the upstroke and deflated on the downstroke of the Thumper. There was no increase in systolic blood pressure with the balloon pump. Diastolic blood pressure and coronary perfusion pressure were significantly higher with the IABP. Circulation times were shorter and end-tidal CO2 was higher with the IABP. It was concluded that the IABP improves hemodynamic parameters during experimental cardiac arrest.\r"

Admission time to the referring ED was compared with the exact time a call for the helicopter was received and a time-to-request interval (TTR) was calculated. A total of 64 cases were studied. Fifty (78%) of the patients had blunt trauma; 14 (22%) had penetrating trauma. The average TTR for the helicopter was 69.8 minutes, with a range from 17 minutes before arrival at the referring ED to 337 minutes after arrival. Children (aged less than or equal to 16 years) had an average TTR of 34.1 minutes compared with 76.4 minutes for adults (aged greater than 16 years). Of the variables examined, patient age was the only factor significantly associated with TTR. These observations suggest that, except in children, there frequently is a lengthy time interval between the time trauma patients arrive at EDs in rural eastern North Carolina and the time an emergency helicopter service is called to transport them to a trauma center.\r"

One thousand eighty-two motor vehicle-pedestrian accidents occurring in a metropolitan area over a 5-year period were studied. Age-specific injury rates and fatality rates were evaluated with respect to the injury severity scores (ISS) for all fatally injured autopsied pedestrians. Of the 1,082 injuries, 131 fatalities occurred. Mean ISSs were found to be significantly higher for pedestrians dying at the scene of the accident (mean ISS, 54.83) and higher for those dying in the emergency department (mean ISS, 45.18), than for pedestrians who died in the hospital (mean ISS, 30.57) (P less than .0001). The mortality rate for pedestrians aged greater than or equal to 60 years was substantially higher than for those adults aged less than 60 years of age (P less than .001). Elderly patients involved in accidents were much more likely to die than younger pedestrians (44.6% v 10.4%; P less than .0001). Elderly pedestrians were significantly overrepresented in the group of pedestrians dying in the hospital compared with younger injury victims (52.5% v 21.5%; P less than .008). This study shows that elderly pedestrians struck by motor vehicles die at a higher rate because they succumb to injuries in the hospital more frequently than younger pedestrians. This may reflect the greater susceptibility of the elderly to metabolic, surgical, and infectious complications after admission to the hospital. A decrease in mortality rates of elderly patients suffering pedestrian injuries will probably follow improved in-hospital intensive care services for the elderly.\r"

We compared outcomes in patients receiving intravenous aminophylline according to population-based ED guidelines (group 1) or Bayesian-derived pharmacokinetic estimates (group 2), we determined predictors for admission or discharge in our study group, and we assessed the ability of a Bayesian pharmacokinetic model to estimate theophylline requirements in the ED. The study population was composed of 82 patients (42 males, 40 females) with a mean age of 43 +/- 15.5 years. Fifteen patients were excluded because of protocol violations. Of the 67 cases studied, 30 were assigned to group 1, and 37 were assigned to group 2. Patient demographics, baseline theophylline concentration, and theophylline loading dose did not differ significantly between treatment groups. The aminophylline maintenance infusion was significantly (P less than .001) lower in group 1 (0.4 +/- 0.2 mg/kg/h) than in group 2 (0.6 +/- 0.2 mg/kg/h). Serum theophylline concentrations at one hour post-loading-dose did not differ significantly between treatment groups; however, significant differences were observed at two hours post-load (P less than .002) and four hours post-load (P less than .001). Baseline peak flow rate (PFR) was significantly (P less than .03) higher in group 1 (170 +/- 85 L/min) than in group 2 (132 +/- 62 L/min), but did not differ significantly at any other times throughout the study. The PFR one hour post-load (PFR-1) was the strongest (P less than .003) predictor of outcome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Culture of the aspirate subsequently grew Hemophilus parainfluenzae, the first such reported case of this pathogen in a glossal abscess. Glossal abscess is a rare clinical entity that may result in airway compromise and disseminated infection to other systems. The presence of a glossal abscess should be considered in all cases of tongue swelling.\r"

Hearing was preserved in all 57 ears in which matrix removal was carried out as the planned last stage. These included three ears in which the membranous canal was cut deliberately. Surgery that was performed against established rules caused deafness in three ears. Accidental opening of the horizontal canal caused no sensorineural loss in two ears as the fistulas were sealed immediately, while one ear in which the opening was not immediately recognized became deaf.\r"

Approximately 45% of the subjects had differences greater than 10 dB for high frequencies, but less than 12% had a difference greater than 20 dB for the pure-tone average. Significant relationships were found between sensorineural hearing loss and the presence of acquired cholesteatoma in the middle ear, diseased mucosa of the promontory and hypotympanum, and diseased ossicles. These findings suggest that more severe middle ear disease may result in sensorineural hearing loss. However, for the majority of subjects, the amount of sensorineural hearing loss was judged not to be clinically significant.\r"

An increase of intercellular space and a decrease in basolateral infoldings of cells of the stria vascularis and dark cell regions of adrenalectomized animals were observed.

After exposure to both techniques, one of us (P.H.T.) developed a middle-ground approach that lies between the extremes of the two European schools. The benefits of this middle-ground technique include a high success rate, maximal safety, relative ease of learning, and its ability to be performed as an adjunct to any other indicated functional nasal surgery.\r"

The preferred treatment modality consisted of open reduction and internal fixation with plates. Societal influences have been responsible for this declining trend in the number and severity of facial fractures.

Both the HFb and HFb + Zyd implants were accepted as primary takes but regressed volumetrically at significantly greater rates than either the Zyd or Zyp implants. Correlative immunohistochemical staining revealed that, by 10 days, 90% of the cells within the HFb implants and 80% within the HFb + Zyd implants were of human origin; however, by 9 weeks, approximately 25% of the cells were of human origin in both types of implants. These results indicated that cultured human fibroblasts can be successfully injected as living grafts; however, the subsequent gradual attrition in the numbers of implanted cells, as noted in this model system, limits the long-term retention of the implants.\r"

Its use as a probe to distinguish tumors from normal tissues has been largely based on its fluorescence when activated by UV light. These findings are largely subjective, and a direct correlation to its use as a photosensitizing agent to selectively kill transformed cells when activated by an appropriate wavelength of light could not be made. The efficacy of dihematoporphyrin ether photodynamic therapy to selectively kill papillomavirus-transformed cells is based on the increased localization of dihematoporphyrin ether within these tissues as compared with normal tissues. Using cottontail rabbit papillomavirus, cutaneous papillomas were induced on the backs of Dutch belted rabbits. Dihematoporphyrin ether was labeled with indium 111 and intravenously injected into the rabbits. The animals were scanned twice daily for indium 111 activity on a large-field-of-view gamma camera. At 50 hours after injection, the rabbits were killed and papillomas, skin, and major organs collected for biodistribution studies. The results of this study and their relationship to dihematoporphyrin ether photodynamic therapy for the treatment of virally induced papilloma disease is discussed.\r"

All these tests indicated that the patient was likely to be hearing SOAEs. During subsequent aspirin administration, her SOAEs disappeared and her perception of her tinnitus was radically altered. The tinnitus was no longer described as monaural and \"tonal\" but instead was described as being \"noise in the head.\"\r"

There was a persistent intraluminal thrombus in the infarct related coronary artery in five of six segments in which recanalisation was unsuccessful and in one of 15 segments in which recanalisation was successful. Rupture and haemorrhage of the atheromatous plaque were seen in most of the infarct related segments, both in those in which recanalisation was achieved and in those in which it was not. Irregular narrowing and filling defects on the coronary cineangiograms were associated with rupture and haemorrhage of the atheromatous plaque. These results suggest that failure of coronary thrombolysis to recanalize the infarct related artery does not indicate that the occlusion was not caused by thrombus.\r"

Coronary artery stenoses were caused by fibrofatty atheromatous plaques; there were no residual thrombi in the lumen or acute intimal lesions. Three of these infarcts were of partial thickness (less than two thirds wall width) with sparing of the outer third of the myocardium and subendocardial zones. In the other three patients the infarct related coronary arteries remained histologically closed with residual lumen thrombi and underlying intimal lesions. Two infarcts were transmural. Six of the eight infarcts were noticeably haemorrhagic. Myocardial haemorrhage was confined to areas of necrotic myocardium and did not affect viable regions. These findings suggest that thrombus overlying a complex lesion may be more difficult to lyse than thrombus overlying a simple fibrofatty plaque. They also suggest that myocardial haemorrhage outside the infarct area, which might lead to cardiac rupture or delayed healing, does not usually occur.\r"

Current cigarette smoking and a family history of myocardial infarction were both strongly associated with the risk of stroke and myocardial infarction, with relative risks of 2.47 (95% confidence interval 1.89 to 3.23) and 1.93 (95% confidence interval 1.52 to 2.44) respectively. The relative risks associated with past smoking decreased according to the length of time since stopping smoking. A family history of stroke was not significantly related to the risk of stroke or myocardial infarction. Single women had a lower risk of stroke and myocardial infarction than married women (relative risk 0.49), but parity, past use of oral contraceptives, and menopausal state were not significantly related to the risk of stroke and myocardial infarction in this study. Other characteristics that were identified as risk factors either for subsequent stroke or for myocardial infarction included not only hypertension, diabetes, and past histories of stroke and myocardial infarction, but also past histories of gynaecological cancer and of venous thrombosis. The association with venous thrombosis may indicate the importance of the haemostatic system in a common pathogenesis of venous thrombosis and myocardial infarction.\r"

During a mean follow up of 18 months, four patients died suddenly and three developed spontaneous sustained ventricular tachycardia. The occurrence of arrhythmic events was not significantly different in patients with inducible sustained arrhythmias and those without, but such events were predicted by the presence of mild congestive heart failure. Although the inducibility of sustained ventricular tachycardia (but not ventricular fibrillation) seemed to identify a high risk subset with an arrhythmic event rate of 21% compared with 5.5% in others, it had a low sensitivity (57%) and a low positive predictive accuracy (21%) for arrhythmic events. Programmed ventricular stimulation is not helpful in identifying a subset of patients at high risk after an uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction.\r"

The characteristics of the treadmill were established by exercising 11 controls at three speeds and two inclinations and comparing oxygen consumption with that on a motorised treadmill under the same conditions. Oxygen consumption on the self powered treadmill at an equivalent speed and inclination was significantly higher because of the work needed to overcome the friction of the belt. Unlike a conventional treadmill, increasing the gradient on the self powered treadmill did not increase oxygen consumption. The distance walked in 12 minutes on the self powered treadmill was measured in eight patients with mild heart failure and ten controls. Maximal oxygen consumption was measured in the same group on a conventional treadmill by a mass spectrometer. There was a significant correlation between the distance walked and maximum oxygen consumption. In patients with mild heart failure the distance travelled in 12 minutes on a self powered treadmill provides a practical, inexpensive, and sensitive method of assessing functional capacity.\r"

  ".W": "The time constant (T) of left ventricular pressure fall is widely used as an index of ventricular \"relaxation\". It is not known whether its rate limiting step is deactivation, an enzymic energy consuming reaction whose rate is therefore sensitive to temperature, or elastic recoil. To distinguish between these possibilities, the time constant was measured by simple logarithmic (Tlog) and exponential (Texp) methods in 12 patients during cooling before coronary artery grafting. Ventricular loading conditions were altered by transfusion from bypass to maintain arterial and left atrial pressures constant in individual patients, though heart rate fell from 86 (8.4) to 68 (10) beats/min. Tlog increased from 49 (10) ms mean (SD), at 37 degrees C to 86 (15) ms at 31 degrees C, and Texp from 63(14) at 37 degrees C to 112 (23) ms at 31 degrees C with intermediate values at 34 degrees C. Texp proved sensitive to \"noise\" at low temperatures, but the overall change in Tlog with temperature was 9% per degree C--considerably less than that observed experimentally for the rate of tension decline of isolated myocardium, and possibly itself an overestimate because of the concomitant fall in heart rate. The relatively small effect of temperature on Tlog in humans, associated with a considerable load sensitivity appearing under hypothermic conditions, does not favour simple dependence on deactivation as the rate limiting step of left ventricular pressure fall, but suggests that its determinants may be complex.\r"

We report the V/Q scintigraphic findings in six patients (including four children), in whom this assumption could not be sustained. Thus ventilation imaged with 81Krm was seen to change during image acquisition in lobes that showed perfusion abnormalities. In some, but not all, views the appearances were typical for pulmonary vascular disease, which might easily have been misdiagnosed if the changes in the distribution of ventilation had not announced themselves by occurring during image acquisition. A ventilation image obtained immediately before injection of 99Tcm-MAA may be useful.\r"

A clear majority of doctors would like to see more transplants. Only 16 per cent of doctors opposed them on cost grounds, and a 50 per cent 5-year survival rate is seen as more than adequate clinical justification. However, doctors are less supportive of liver and heart grafts than of kidney and cornea grafts. Few lay people would refuse donation of specific organs, but 30 per cent worry that doctors might be pressured into removal of organs when they are not sure the patient is dead. Religious or moral objection is rare. Intensive care unit staff felt the most important factor restricting organ harvest in their own units was dislike of adding to relatives' distress, followed by lack of training in approaching relatives and adverse media publicity. Only 11 per cent thought reservations on brain stem death a likely or possible influence. Enhanced public awareness of the need for transplants was seen as the most important means of increasing organ harvest. Required request would be controversial and perhaps impossible to implement. We conclude that the time, effort and expense involved in potential organ donation do not play a substantial part in limiting referral. Neither do reservations about brain stem death. Increased training of staff (both in communication skills and in the professional responsibility to encourage donation) and greater public awareness are seen as the twin foundations of a realistic approach to enhancing referral.\r"

Radiation therapy has been used in an attempt to improve the prognosis but only a few series of less than ten cases have been reported. Since 1977 we have treated 20 patients with gallbladder carcinoma with postoperative radiotherapy (mean total dose 4200 radiation absorbed dose). In four patients all the tumour was resected with the intent of cure. In 12 patients, the lesion was partially resected and in four patients no resection was performed. Seven patients in whom the tumour was partially resected or not resected also had chemotherapy. Our evaluation was retrospective and we compared our results with historical control groups comparable with respect to surgical procedures and pathological staging. In patients operated on for cure, one patient is alive at 84 months, the others died at 7, 8 and 33 months. In patients in whom the tumour was partially resected the mean survival time was 8.1 months and two patients are still alive 7.0 months after treatment. According to the Nevin classification the mean survival time in stage IV and V patients was respectively 9.2 and 7.2 months. There was no difference in survival between patients treated or not treated with chemotherapy. This experience is the largest published and suggests that radiotherapy may increase survival after no resection or palliative resection of gallbladder carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "In this retrospective study, the long-term follow-up of patients undergoing choledochojejunostomy (Roux-en-Y) for bile duct stones with complex clearance of the bile duct is evaluated. Bile duct exploration and subsequent choledochojejunostomy (Roux-en-Y) was performed in 43 patients (median age 67 years) in the period 1976-82. There was no mortality and only one patient had a major complication. Twenty patients died during follow-up (median follow-up period 5 years); the median follow-up period for the remaining 23 patients was 8 years. Good long-term results were found in 98 per cent of cases. No signs or symptoms could be related to bile duct obstruction or to cholangitis. Nearly all liver function tests and serum bilirubin levels were normal in the 21 patients who were tested. We conclude that patients with bile duct stones with complex clearance of the bile duct can be safely treated by means of a choledochoenterostomy (in this study a choledochojejunostomy Roux-en-Y).\r"

This treatment was successful in 13 patients, although one required percutaneous insertion because of duodenal distortion and one required a combined percutaneous-endoscopic approach. Median survival after stenting was 3.5 months (range from 2 weeks to 16 months). Of the three treatment failures, two patients had external drainage only and one succumbed before further treatment could be attempted. There were two complications associated with the procedure (one small bile leak and one episode of cholangitis) but the 30-day mortality rate of 12.5 per cent was related to disease progression rather than the procedure. Endoscopic stent insertion may achieve further worthwhile palliation of jaundice after the failure of surgery to relieve malignant biliary obstruction.\r"

Laser energy was delivered by a 320 microns quartz fibre at wavelengths of 440, 480, 504, 560, 590, and 635 nm, in 1 microsecond pulses at energies of 5-60 mJ per pulse, producing peak powers of the order of 10(5) W. Cholesterol, pigment and mixed stones were fragmented. The shorter wavelengths were most efficient, using significantly less energy at 440 and 480 nm than at the longer wavelengths. Pigment stones were fragmented with significantly less energy than those in which cholesterol predominated. Thermal imaging during laser treatment showed no significant rise in temperature in the bulk of the stone. Absorption spectroscopy of bile revealed a peak at 450 nm, coinciding with the known absorption characteristic of bilirubin. Bile strongly attenuated light at shorter wavelengths, even at dilutions as great as 1:20 and protected samples of biliary epithelium from laser damage except when the optical fibre was in direct contact. The pulsed dye laser may offer significant advantages over current methods of biliary stone fragmentation.\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the pathogenesis of renal insufficiency associated with obstructive jaundice we have studied spontaneous water intake and body water compartments in rabbits undergoing common bile duct ligation. Total body water, extracellular water and plasma volume were measured by multi-isotope dilution technique. During the initial 6 postoperative days spontaneous water intake was 898 ml in sham operated animals (SO) but only 280 ml in jaundiced rabbits (OJ6) (P less than 0.01). Creatinine clearance was almost unchanged in SO but fell to 60 per cent of the preoperative values both in OJ6 and in paired-drink sham operated animals (SO2). There was a 15 per cent decrease in total body water (P less than 0.01) and a 24 per cent decrease in extracellular water (P less than 0.01) 6 days after bile duct ligation. There was a further reduction of the extracellular water to 35 per cent and a 15 per cent reduction of plasma volume 12 days after ligation. Water restriction mimicked the alterations in body composition produced by bile duct ligation. We conclude that bile duct ligation is associated with hypodypsia and a depletion of extracellular water and plasma volume. These alterations could explain the tendency to develop hypotension and renal failure which are associated with obstructive jaundice.\r"

Intravenous contrast-enhanced computed tomography, or latterly incremental dynamic computed tomographic angiography, accurately detected and localized necrotic tissue. Operation was delayed where possible to permit demarcation of the necrotic area and the development of a 'capsule' of inflammatory tissue. A retrocolic route of access to the necrotic area was used in nine cases, and purpose-made silicone elastomer tubes with an outside diameter of 20 mm were positioned so that drainage was assisted by gravity when the patient was supine. The cavity was irrigated with saline (initially 2 litres daily), and in the last seven patients Trasylol was included in the irrigation fluid (5 x 10(6) kallidinogenase inactivator (KI) units/litre) for the first postoperative week. Three elderly patients died (mean age 72 years) but all patients aged less than 68 years survived. Planned reoperation was carried out in two patients, but further reoperations were not required in the remaining 11. Drainage tubes were removed when contrast studies showed the cavity to be small and superficial; the median duration of drainage was 28 days. Although sinograms demonstrated fistulae between cavity and small bowel (n = 4) or small bowel and colon (n = 2), no clinical problems resulted and all closed spontaneously. Closed drainage may be as effective as techniques of marsupialization, but avoids the need for frequent relaparotomy.\r"

  ".W": "The Budd-Chiari syndrome, arising from hepatic venous outflow obstruction, is frequently complicated by inferior vena caval occlusion or obstruction. Satisfactory decompression of the liver by either portacaval or mesocaval shunts may therefore prove impossible or be prone to failure from shunt thrombosis. The mesoatrial shunt which allows the portal vein to drain directly into the right atrium has previously been advocated in this situation. Five patients with the Budd-Chiari syndrome and caval occlusion and/or obstruction have had mesoatrial shunts constructed using externally supported polytetrafluoroethylene grafts. A single thoracoabdominal incision, incorporating a median sternotomy, was found to provide a satisfactory approach. All patients recovered well with resolution of ascites, diminution in liver size and improvement in inferior vena caval pressure gradients. Furthermore, all shunts have remained patent, as determined by Doppler flow studies and contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scanning, during follow-up periods ranging from 9 to 16 months. If these results are supported by longer term studies, the mesoatrial shunt may become the surgical treatment of choice in patients with hepatic vein occlusion and the Budd-Chiari syndrome associated with inferior vena caval obstruction.\r"

Endoscopy, histology, HIDA radionuclide studies and acid secretory studies were performed to determine the effect of Roux-en-Y diversion. Symptomatic results were pleasing in that all patients were graded as Visick I or II. There was a statistically significant improvement in endoscopic evidence of mucosal damage (median score of 6 reduced to median of 1) and visible bile reflux (median score of 10.5 reduced to 0). Foveolar hyperplasia, superficial chronic gastritis and histological precursors of malignancy all improved. There was a significant decrease in the reflux of 99mTc-labelled HIDA into the gastric remnant while acid secretion remained unchanged. Roux-en-Y diversion with a 60 cm jejunal loop provides not only symptomatic relief but scintigraphic, endoscopic and histological evidence of pancreatobiliary diversion.\r"

Two patients underwent removal of the band and seven patients were converted to a stapled vertical Silastic ring gastroplasty. Although gastric banding appears to be a satisfactory method of achieving weight loss, the complication and reoperation rates are unacceptable in our hands.

In a group of six piglets (group A), a full thickness defect was created in the oesophagus without fully transecting the organ. The removed tissue was subsequently replaced with a patch of collagen-coated Vicryl mesh. Animals were killed at 4 weeks and in the five surviving piglets the prosthesis had been replaced by host scar tissue with a normal epithelial lining. Two further groups of six piglets (groups B and C) were used as controls. In group B the oesophagus was either partly transected (four animals) or completely transected (two animals) and an anastomosis was performed, whereas in group C a 2.5-cm length of oesophagus was removed so that the anastomosis was performed under tension. In group B, all six piglets survived, whereas in group C, where the anastomosis was performed under tension, only two piglets survived. Microscopic and macroscopic examination of all groups showed that the collagen-coated Vicryl prosthesis was replaced by scar tissue; moderate stenosis was observed in only one animal in group A. Collagen-coated Vicryl mesh may be used either to reinforce an anastomosis performed under tension or may find use in tubular form to bridge the gap between the two ends of the oesophagus to be joined. It is envisaged that such a material may find applications in the treatment of oesophageal atresia.\r"

The incidence of infections and thromboembolic complications related to death in these patients was compared with that of a matched deceased population (n = 403) who had not undergone splenectomy. Death-related pneumonia was diagnosed frequently in the splenectomy group and to a lesser extent in the control group (57.9 versus 24.1 per cent, P less than 0.001). Lethal sepsis with multiple organ failure occurred in 6.9 per cent of the splenectomy group and in 1.5 per cent of the controls (P less than 0.001). Purulent pyelonephritis was observed in 7.9 per cent of the splenectomy group and was significantly more frequent than in the control group with its rate of 2.2 per cent (P less than 0.001). Finally, pulmonary embolism was the major or a contributory cause of death more often in the splenectomy group than in the control group (35.6 versus 9.7 per cent, P less than 0.001).

Twelve patients were enrolled in this study, each for 2 weeks of daily topical application of bleomycin in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) painted over the lesion. Two patients were excluded from analysis due to excessive dilution of the medication by local saliva production. Five patients were treated with a 0.5% solution that caused a decrease in the thickness of all of the lesions clinically. One lesion also had a sharp decrease in size. Five patients were treated with a 1.0% solution that caused a complete resolution of the lesions in three patients. Two lesions demonstrated maturation of parakeratosis to keratosis only. All patients tolerated the treatments well. Topical bleomycin may play a role in the treatment of leukoplakia and warrants further investigation.\r"

In the receptor positive patient, after tamoxifen therapy, the lymph node metastasis regressed completely and was associated with full relief of pain from osseous metastases for nearly 3 years. Subsequently, progressive painful osseous metastases in the spine, skull, pelvis, and femur were palliated for shorter periods with sequential systemic therapy with megestrol acetate and fluoxymesterone. Osseous metastases were also palliated with external radiation therapy. In contrast, despite external radiation therapy, brain metastases proved fatal. Tamoxifen was ineffective in the estradiol receptor negative patient. Based on this report, it may be valuable to determine the presence of estradiol receptor protein in eccrine carcinoma as a predictor of response to hormonal therapy.\r"

Complications of the CDDP infusions were milder than those with intravenous (IV) infusion or rapid intraarterial (IA) infusion, although three lower extremity neuropathies were seen. The CDDP infusions reduced the primary bladder mass effectively, and seven of 16 cystectomy specimens were rendered PO. However, patient survival was clearly predicted by the nodal status. Of 15 T3-4N + MO patients, 11 died at 15 +/- 3 months. Methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (M-VAC) chemotherapy was given if residual transitional cell carcinoma was found after IA CDDP. Of 12 P3NOMO patients undergoing cystectomy, eight are alive with no evidence of disease (NED) at 28 +/- 8 months and no patient has died of transitional cell carcinoma. IA CDDP can effectively reduce bulky bladder cancer masses, but has no demonstrable effect on survival in N+ disease. It appears that adjuvant IA CDDP favorably affects survival in T3NOMO transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.\r"

Myelopathy developed in four patients, radiation osteomyelitis in one, and radiation hepatitis in another after treatment. Posttreatment gastrointestinal symptoms were recorded in the medical records of 4% of patients but were mentioned by 41% of 199 who answered a questionnaire. The moderate gastrointestinal problems were recorded by 17% of the patients compared with 6% in a control group of healthy men. Postirradiation peptic ulcer occurred in 9%. A dose relationship existed, the risk of posttreatment gastrointestinal problems being less when the midplane dose was less than 40 Gy. Forty-one of 63 men who wished to do so fathered at least one child after their radiotherapy. The overall posttreatment quality of life was comparable to that of the control group. The authors conclude that the risk of major posttreatment morbidity is minimal for testicular cancer patients who undergo infradiaphragmatic radiotherapy after orchiectomy. Slight gastrointestinal symptoms are relatively common without major impact on quality of life. Gonadal toxicity is not a significant complication. Infradiaphragmatic radiotherapy is a safe, routine adjuvant treatment of seminoma in orchiectomized patients with Stage I seminoma. The midplane dose should not exceed 36 Gy in these patients.\r"

In normal colonic mucosa, strong staining has been observed in the terminal ileum, cecum, and ascending colon with minimal staining in the rest of the colon and rectum. Eighty-three percent of adenomas expressed Le(y), with 70% showing an increased expression of Le(y) compared with normal tissue. Only 25% of metaplastic (nonneoplastic) polyps showed an increased expression of Le(y). The expression of Le(y) in adenomas was correlated with both size and degree of epithelial dysplasia of the adenomas and also showed an association with histologic type. No correlation was found with the location and morphology of the adenomas. The most strongly related parameter was the degree of dysplasia. All adenomas with severe dysplasia showed increased expression of Le(y), with 83% showing marked expression. This finding was irrespective of their size or type. Adenomas which did not exhibit severe dysplasia showed increased expression in 66% of cases, but only 18% showed marked expression. These findings show that the expression of Le(y) in colorectal lesions is associated with features related to malignant potential. Le(y) expression may provide useful prognostic information in the assessment of colorectal polyps.\r"

  ".W": "Serum melatonin was determined over 24 hours in 35 patients with breast cancer with either a fresh primary tumor (n = 23) or a secondary tumor (n = 12) and in 28 patients with untreated benign breast disease (controls) having a fibroadenoma (n = 10), fibrocystic mastopathy (n = 14), or other breast diseases (n = 4). Circadian rhythms existed in all groups with acrophases at 2 a.m. A 50% depression of peak and amplitude occurred in the group of patients with primary breast cancer compared with age-matched controls (P less than 0.001, P less than 0.01). The peak declined with increasing tumor size: 27% at Stage T1, 53% at T2 (P less than 0.001), and 73% at T3 (P less than 0.05). In contrast, patients with secondary breast cancer, particularly those receiving antiestrogen therapy, had a melatonin peak similar to controls. These results demonstrated a transient depression of pineal melatonin secretion in primary breast cancer and indicated a dynamic role of the pineal gland in malignancy. To investigate some endocrine effects of a depressed melatonin peak, the 24-hour rhythms of prolactin (PRL) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) were determined in patients with primary breast cancer and compared with patients with secondary breast cancer. The PRL had significant circadian rhythms in both groups; but acrophases occurred at midnight in patients with secondary breast cancer, and there were unusually high concentrations at noon in patients with primary breast cancer. Circadian rhythms were not seen for TSH, but the 24-hour average secretion was depressed by 45% (P less than 0.01) in patients with primary breast cancer. The abnormal concentrations of PRL and TSH in these patients could be due to a depressed melatonin peak normally serving as a central circadian synchronizer and modulator of the secretion of adenohypophysial hormones. Additionally, a positive correlation existed between the nocturnal melatonin peak and progesterone and androgen receptor concentrations in primary tumors indicating a direct involvement of melatonin in the growth control of breast cancer.\r"

We studied the direct effect of OK-432 on tumor cells. Established and freshly derived human ovarian carcinoma lines were examined for their susceptibility to OK-432 or its subcellular fractions in direct cytotoxicity, cytostatic activity, and inhibition of metabolic activity. OK-432 was cytotoxic to 13 of 15 freshly derived ovarian carcinoma lines in a 24-hour chromium-51 (51Cr) release assay. The optimal effect was noticed at OK-432 concentrations between 0.1 and 1.0 Klinishe Einhert (KE) per milliliter. The cytostatic effect on two established lines and one fresh line correlated with the cytotoxic activity. In all three lines, however, the metabolic activities (DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis) were inhibited by OK-432, suggesting that cell lysis by OK-432 may not be directly correlated with the inhibition of metabolic activities. Several subcellular fractions were derived from OK-432 and only the cytoplasmic and protoplast membrane fractions showed cytotoxic activity against the OK-432-sensitive tumor cell lines, although the cytotoxicity obtained was greatly less than the whole microorganism OK-432. The direct binding of 14C-OK-432 to tumor cells was examined. Binding took place rapidly after 1 hour of incubation and reached a maximum activity at 37 degrees C. Binding in all three lines ranged between 1.7 and 2.7 pg/cell. These results demonstrate the direct cytotoxic effect of OK-432 and some subcellular fractions on human ovarian carcinoma lines. These results also show that the BRM OK-432 may exert its effect by both potentiating the antitumor response and directly inhibiting tumor cell growth.\r"

The slides were read independently by two observers. The initially high interobserver variability (grade, 22.2%; type, 10.3%; and tumor presence/absence, 7.1%) was for the most part due to intermediate grades and types and was reduced to 1.7% after mutual review. Small samples showed lower mean grade than large samples and more often absence of tumor (7.6% versus 2.4%). Of all gliomas, 48% showed differently typed samples, 82% differently graded samples, and 62% benign and malignant grades. Intratumoral heterogeneity was higher for the necroses than for the other histopathologic features. Our results underscore the importance of extensive tissue sampling.\r"

Results were compared with those in 561 cases of infiltrating ductal carcinoma similarly treated during the same period. The 5-year actuarial risk of local recurrence was similar for patients with infiltrating lobular or ductal carcinoma when the latter was evaluated as a single group (12% versus 11%). However, the 12% 5-year actuarial local recurrence risk for patients with infiltrating lobular carcinoma was intermediate between that for patients with infiltrating ductal carcinomas with an extensive intraductal component (23%) and those without an extensive intraductal component (5%). The pattern of recurrence in the breast was similar in the infiltrating lobular and ductal groups. All recurrences in patients with infiltrating lobular carcinoma and 80% of recurrences in the infiltrating ductal group occurred in the vicinity of the primary tumor (P = not significant). None of the clinical or morphologic features examined significantly influenced the risk of local recurrence in patients with infiltrating lobular carcinoma. The authors conclude that combined conservative surgery and radiotherapy appear to be a reasonable treatment option for patients with infiltrating lobular carcinoma, but further follow-up will be required to confirm these results.\r"

Discriminant analysis was carried out on these cases and identified nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio and number of nuclei/mm2 as the significant discriminatory features. These were combined to derive a classification rule which was capable of correctly identifying localized and metastatic tumors in 92% of cases. The classification rule was applied subsequently to an additional five test cases, all of which were classified successfully. The failure of increased nuclear size and pleomorphism to correlate with malignancy in these tumors was confirmed. Tumors which metastasized had significantly greater gross diameters than localized lesions, but overlap existed. Mitotic counts were not a helpful discriminatory feature. Morphometry may be useful in improving histologic assessment of pancreatic islet cell tumor behavior.\r"

However, no elevated TA-4 level was detected in the sera of 28 patients with mature cystic teratomas of the ovary. Moreover, serial determination of the serum TA-4 level showed a good correlation between the clinical course and the serum TA-4 level. Interestingly, an abnormal TA-4 level preceded the clinical detection of recurrence by 2 months in two patients.

The histologic type with the lowest agreement rate was rhabdomyosarcoma (17%), followed by sarcoma not otherwise specified (NOS) (27%), angiosarcoma (33%), and fibrosarcoma (48%). These figures reflect the significant degree of difficulty in the diagnosis of these tumor types. The treatment response rate of soft tissue sarcomas in the randomized study of Adriamycin (Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH) regimens was slightly higher for those with lower grade sarcomas, i.e., 25% (four of 16) response rate for Grade 1 lesions; 22% (17/77) for Grade 2, and 21% (35/170) for Grade 3. When adjusted for type of sarcoma, there was no noticeable difference between Grade 1-2 versus 3 in response rate. A statistically significant difference in the percentage of complete responders was noted between Group A tumors (synovial sarcoma, hemangiopericytoma, sarcoma NOS, and Ewing's; 12.2%) versus Group B tumors (all other types--mostly spindle cell sarcomas; 3.5%) (P = 0.02).\r"

We reviewed 41 such patients treated with surgery and/or radiotherapy (RT) (n = 25) or with combined modality treatment including chemotherapy (CH) (n = 16). The male to female ratio was 28 to 13, and the median age was 58 years (range, 32 to 94 years). There were 27 (66%) patients with poorly differentiated SCC and 8 with moderately differentiated or well-differentiated cancer. Twenty-three (56%) patients had N3 disease, 16 (39%) had N2, and 2 had N1. The majority of N3 patients have been treated with CH and RT (n = 12) or with RT alone (n = 9). The combined CH-RT was well tolerated, with no life-threatening toxicity. The complete response (CR) to CH-RT was 81% (11 patients have no evidence of disease [NED] currently). The median survival time of this group was 37+ months. Of the 25 patients who had surgery and/or RT as their first planned treatment, 7 (28%) have NED currently. The median survival time of this group was 24 months. Patients with N3 disease who received CH had a higher CR rate and a longer survival time as compared with those treated with surgery and/or RT, despite a higher (N3) stage of disease. These findings warrant further investigation in randomized cooperative studies.\r"

Corticosteroids were the most frequent exogenous cause of immune suppression. Bacteremia was detected more frequently than meningitis and in contrast to earlier reports, bacteriologic cure was achieved in 12 of 13 patients. Therapeutic success appeared to be related to early institution of effective antimicrobial agents. Despite eradication of infection, seven of the patients were dead within three months from progression of their underlying disease. The overall survival rate of cancer patients with listeriosis is therefore a function of the underlying malignancy and not the infection.\r"

To determine the current frequency of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, we reviewed data from the tumor registries of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the University Hospital (UH), and the Boston VA Medical Center (BVAMC). From 1982 to 1984, 868 esophageal cancers were reported in Massachusetts, of which 231 (27%) were adenocarcinomas. In comparison with squamous cell carcinomas of the esophagus, esophageal adenocarcinomas occurred more frequently in males (P less than 0.01) and were uncommon among blacks (P less than 0.01). From 1980 to 1986, 262 cases of esophageal cancer were seen at the UH and the BVAMC, of which 81 (31%) were adenocarcinomas. An analysis of the latter group to identify true esophageal adenocarcinomas (tumors confined to the esophagus without gastric involvement) yielded 47 cases. Thus, true esophageal adenocarcinoma accounted for 18% of esophageal malignancies at our hospitals, a frequency threefold to fivefold higher than that found in four prior studies that used comparable anatomic diagnostic criteria. We conclude that adenocarcinoma of the esophagus is now being recognized at a substantially higher frequency than reported in the past.\r"

The author reports six cases encountered in a large county hospital over an 8-year period. Three of the patients had gastric carcinoma, esophageal adenocarcinoma, and testicular carcinoma, respectively. These neoplasms have not been previously reported to be associated with DVT of the arm. Three episodes of DVT resulted from venous compression by the tumor, and a hypercoagulable state may have contributed to the pathogenesis of DVT in the other three cases. Venography is required for confirmation of the diagnosis; however, a computed tomographic scan with contrast media may be a valuable adjunct. A review of the literature indicated that the incidence of pulmonary embolism is significant in these patients. Therefore, anticoagulation within 7 days of clinical onset is recommended.\r"

One hundred eight cases (75.0%) were detected by alpha-fetoprotein serosurvey and/or ultrasonography mainly in a high-risk population; 129 cases (89.6%) coexisted with cirrhosis. Resection was done in 132 cases (91.7%) with three (2.3%) operative deaths; cryosurgery, laser vaporization, and hepatic arterial chemotherapy were used in the rest. Limited resection was done in 67.4% of resections. Reresection of subclinical recurrence or solitary pulmonary metastasis was done in 21 cases. The 5-year and 10-year survival rates were 67.9% and 53.4% in the resection group but zero in the nonresection group. Survival was correlated negatively with tumor size, 5-year survival after resection was 84.6% in tumors less than or equal to 2 cm but 59.5% in tumors of 4.1 to 5 cm. The increase of resectability and reresection resulted in marked improved of 5-year survival from 43.5% in 1973 to 1977 to 63.3% in 1978 to 1982 in the entire series. No significant difference was found between survival of limited resection and lobectomy. Resection may be the modality of choice for treatment of small hepatocellular carcinomas with compensated liver function. Limited resection instead of lobectomy was the key to increased resectability and decreased operative mortality in cirrhotic livers. Reresection of subclinical recurrence was important to prolong survival further.\r"

The material was fixed in buffered formaldehyde at 4 degrees C, serially sectioned at 2 mm intervals, and routinely processed. Eleven thyroid glands contained OPC, corresponding in three cases to multiple lesions. Eight carcinomas were found in 59 men (13.6%) and three in 41 women (7.3%). The ages ranged from 26 to 78 years. The neoplasms varied in size from microscopic foci to 9 mm in diameter.

Alcohol exposure during both age periods was significantly greater for breast cancer cases, but risks, estimated by maximum likelihood odds ratios, were highest for alcohol consumption frequency during the early adult period. Age-adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for breast cancer risk and early age drinking (10 versus 0 drinks/week) were 2.2 (95% CI = 1.34, 3.5), relative to the population controls and 2.0 (95% CI = 1.3, 3.1) relative to the cancer controls.

The data are from Bali, an Indonesian Hindu island in a country with a predominantly Muslim population. In contrast to the surrounding Muslim population, circumcision is rare in the people of Bali, and the rate of phimosis in grown men is very high. The Balinese epidemiologic data of 1985 to 1986 were compared with 1986 data from The Netherlands. In Bali, cervical carcinoma was the most frequent carcinoma in women, and vulvar/vaginal carcinoma ranked seven. These carcinomas were much less frequent in The Netherlands. In Balinese men, penile carcinoma is the second most frequent carcinoma, whereas it is rarely diagnosed in The Netherlands. Penile carcinomas are found in Bali in younger age groups than in The Netherlands. Based on the immunohistochemical staining results, it is estimated that over 75% of the studied Balinese genital carcinomas contain human papillomavirus (HPV). The data presented in this paper may indicate that the cofactor of impeded postcoital hygiene can be of great importance for male and female HPV-associated genital carcinogenesis. It is clear that Balinese men, in particular men with extreme phimosis, are both vectors and victims of HPV. In The Netherlands the man is exclusively the vector of HPV.\r"

To study whether the effects of opiate receptor inhibition are mediated by means of an action on the central opiate system, we administered equimolar doses of naloxone hydrochloride and naloxone methobromide (MeBr) and normal saline to heart failure dogs. Chronic stable right heart failure was produced by progressive pulmonary artery constriction and tricuspid valve avulsion. Naloxone hydrochloride caused an increase in mean aortic pressure, cardiac output, left ventricular dP/dt and dP/dt/P, plasma catecholamines, and regional blood flows to the myocardium, quadriceps muscle, kidneys, and splanchnic beds. Plasma beta-endorphin and adrenocorticotropin also increased. In contrast, neither normal saline nor naloxone MeBr (which does not cross the blood-brain barrier) affected the systemic or regional hemodynamics or neurohormones. Naloxone hydrochloride was also administered to anesthetized heart failure dogs. Pentobarbital anesthesia removed cortical perception of nociceptive stimulation, reduced the increase in plasma epinephrine, and abolished vasodilation in skeletal muscle that occurred in conscious dogs after naloxone hydrochloride administration but had no major effects on responses of plasma norepinephrine, systemic hemodynamics, or other regional blood flows to opiate receptor inhibition. Naloxone hydrochloride had no effect in sham-operated dogs. The results indicate that the hemodynamic effects of naloxone are mediated by an action within the central nervous system. Furthermore, since pentobarbital anesthesia did not markedly alter the hemodynamic responses to naloxone hydrochloride, the acute salutary effects of opiate receptor inhibition probably are not caused by removal of the antinociceptive effect of endogenous opioids in heart failure.\r"

In this study, the cellular basis of the rise in [Ca2+]i that activates ITI and aftercontractions in single rat ventricular myocytes was examined. [Ca2+]i was measured both indirectly by cell contraction and directly with fura-2. Under conditions that caused steady-state [Ca2+]i to increase (i.e., calcium overload) membrane repolarization after a voltage-clamp depolarization resulted in the appearance of ITI that was similar in many respects to that observed in multicellular preparations. This ITI occurred at the same time that [Ca2+]i spontaneously increased and preceded the aftercontraction by 60-90 msec. However, ITI recorded from a single cell was variable in time course and amplitude (unlike that observed in multicellular preparations). Examination of cell contraction and digital imaging of fura-2 fluorescence showed that ITI was often associated with propagating regions of increased [Ca2+]i, which arose from discrete sites of origin within the cell. Apparently synchronous aftercontractions could also be associated with multiple propagating waves of [Ca2+]i. The variation in the time course and amplitude of ITI in single cells appeared to be due to changes in the location and number of sites of origin for the waves of [Ca2+]i. After the first aftercontraction and ITI, desynchronization of the sites of origin of increased [Ca2+]i occurred, and this resulted in a decrease in the amplitude of ITI and an increase in its duration. We conclude that the variability seen in single cells arises from changes in the pattern of spontaneous Ca2+ release. Such phenomena will seriously complicate interpretation of multicellular data, even when [Ca2+]i is measured directly.\r"

To explore relations between preload, afterload, and stroke volume (SV) in the fetal left ventricle, we instrumented 126-129 days gestation fetal lambs with ascending aortic electromagnetic flow transducers, vascular catheters, and inflatable occluders around the aortic isthmus (n = 8) or descending aorta (n = 7). At 24-48 hours after surgery, blood was withdrawn or infused to reach various mLAPs. The aorta was then slowly occluded as aortic flow and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured continuously. Isthmus constriction produced linear decreases in SV as MAP increased; mLAP was unchanged. Descending aortic constriction produced no decrease in SV until high MAPs were reached. SV decreased as MAP increased further, and mLAP rose significantly. The curve relating mLAP and SV before constriction showed little increase in SV above mLAPs of 5-7 mm Hg; however, when curves were derived relating SV and mLAP at relatively constant MAPs, SV continued to increase even above an mLAP of 8-10 mm Hg. Our studies indicate that the fetal left ventricle responds to progressive increases in mLAP to at least 10 mm Hg. The lack of increase in SV above an mLAP of 5-7 mm Hg with rapid volume expansion is related to the concomitant increase in MAP and afterload.\r"

Matched micromanometers measured left and right ventricular transmural and transseptal pressures. Ventricular pressures and volumes were varied by inflation of implanted vena caval and pulmonary arterial occluders. When compared with vena caval occlusion at matched left ventricular end-diastolic volumes, graded pulmonary arterial occlusions were associated with higher right ventricular systolic pressures, reduced left-to-right transseptal systolic pressure gradients, and leftward systolic septal displacement, with increased septal-free wall segment shortening (all p less than 0.05). Graded pulmonary arterial occlusions, like vena caval occlusions, reduced left ventricular end-diastolic volume, but left ventricular stroke work at a given end-diastolic volume was greater during pulmonary arterial occlusions (2,674 +/- 380 10(-3) erg) than during vena caval occlusion (1,886 +/- 450 10(-3) erg, p less than 0.05). These data indicate that, while transient pulmonary arterial occlusion reduces left ventricular preload, the concomitant increase in right ventricular systolic pressure, which is the pressure external to the interventricular septal segment of the left ventricle, augments septal shortening and assists left ventricular pump function at a given preload through direct systolic ventricular interaction.\r"

Hearts were then uniformly illuminated for 20 minutes with green light (530-590 nm) from 200 fiber optic cables. With light and without rose bengal, or vice versa, all hearts remained stable. However, in the illuminated rose bengal group, electrophysiological changes (inversion of the terminal portion of the T wave and an increase in Q-T interval) were observed within 11.8 +/- 2.1 seconds (i.e., less than 60 beats). All hearts exhibited ventricular premature beats (within 2.2 +/- 0.7 minutes) and ventricular tachycardia (within 2.8 +/- 0.7 minutes) before the occurrence of complete atrioventricular block (within 5.5 +/- 0.9 minutes). During the illumination period, coronary flow progressively fell in the rose bengal-perfused hearts from 11.6 +/- 0.5 ml/min to 2.0 +/- 0.4 ml/min (p less than 0.05 when compared with any control group). When a similar progressive reduction in coronary flow was mimicked (with or without rose bengal), no arrhythmias occurred.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "[3H]LY186126, an analogue of the cardiotonic agent indolidan, was shown to bind reversibly and with high affinity (Kd = 4 nM) to a single class of binding sites within canine myocardial vesicles. Binding site density measured in various cardiac membrane fractions correlated well with Ca2+-ATPase activity (r = 0.94; p less than 0.01), but not with Na+,K+-ATPase or azide sensitive ATPase, indicating a localization of these sites within sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes. Divalent cations were required for binding and displayed the following order of activation: Zn2+ greater than Mn2+ greater than Mg2+ greater than Ca2+. Differential activation of [3H]LY186126 binding by various divalent cations was due to alterations in binding site density, rather than affinity. cGMP and selective inhibitors of type IV membrane-bound phosphodiesterase (SR-PDE), for example, indolidan, milrinone, imazodan, and enoximone, selectively displaced bound [3H]LY186126 caffeine, theophylline, and rolipram were relatively impotent as inhibitors of radiolabel binding. Kd values from displacement curves were highly correlated with IC50 values for inhibition of SR-PDE (r = 0.92; p less than 0.001). In addition, Kd values correlated well with published ED50 values for increases in cardiac contractility in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs (r = 0.94; p less than 0.001). The results support the hypothesis that [3H]LY186126 labels the pharmacological receptor for the class of positive inotropic agents characterized as isozyme-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Furthermore, the data suggest that the identity of the site labeled by [3H]LY186126 is SR-PDE, the type IV isozyme of cardiac phosphodiesterase located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum.\r"

  ".W": "Different aspects of the intrinsic regulation of rate-induced variations of functional refractory period of atrioventricular node (FRPN) were studied in isolated rabbit heart preparations. First, the hypothesis that these variations originate from the net interaction between facilitation and fatigue was tested. For a constant fast rate, selective effects of faciliation and of steady-stage fatigue were independently shown to shorten and prolong, respectively, FRPN while their combined effects were shown to result in intermediate changes corresponding to the sum of their individual effects. Second, selective and combined effects on FRPN were shown to start for rates corresponding to the upper half of the 1:1 nodal conduction range and to reach their maximums at the fastest rate tested. Third, the time-courses of fatigue-induced prolongations in nodal conduction time and FRPN were shown to be closely linked. Facilitation effects on conduction time and FRPN were confirmed, as previously shown for in situ dog hearts, to be linked, but time-independent. Fourth, FRPN was shown not to correspond to particular limits in its subintervals, but to be, nevertheless, related to nodal refractoriness. Fifth, it was demonstrated that, in conditions of combined facilitation and transient fatigue such as those prevailing in current endocavitary investigations of nodal function, FRPN could be shortened, left unchanged or prolonged by a constant fast rate depending on its duration. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates the dual origin of rate-induced FRPN variations, their rate and time dependence, their relation to changes in nodal refractoriness, and their involvements in various nodal responses.\r"

Blood flow was calculated from arteriolar diameter and red blood cell velocity using intravital microscopy. At greater than 10(-8) M, the potency order for vasodilation (maximum, 170-190% of control) was NECA greater than 2CA greater than ADO; these responses were attenuated by 10(-5) M 8pTHEO. From 10(-8) to 10(-6) M, 2CA evoked vasodilation whereas ADO, which has an identical affinity at A1 and A2 receptors, evoked lesser responses. ADO-induced vasodilation was potentiated by 10(-5) M DIPYRID; this response was similar to that evoked by 2CA alone or 2CA + DIPYRID. In contrast to ADO, 2CA is a poor substrate for cellular uptake, which suggests that uptake reduces the A2 effect of exogenous ADO. From 10(-10) to 10(-8) M, CHA and ADO were equipotent antagonized by 8pTHEO. Norepinephrine was a more potent vasoconstrictor and 8pTHEO did not alter these responses. Since ADO is a metabolic substrate and a nonselective receptor agonist, while CHA is A1-selective and a poor substrate for cellular uptake, neither A2 activation nor cellular uptake altered expression of the A1 effect of exogenous ADO. Furthermore, DIPYRID had no effect on the A1 response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Propranolol (1 microM) was used to block beta-adrenergic effects. The actions of cocaine on cellular electrophysiology were concentration- and time-dependent and were reversible. In paced right atrial (RA) and right ventricular papillary (RVP) tissues, cocaine produced a profound prolongation of the effective refractory period (ERP) assessed by either premature stimulation or minimum pacing interval. ERP was increased up to eightfold in RA tissue and doubled in RVP tissue by 60 microM cocaine. This concentration of cocaine depressed action potential phase 0 depolarization 80% in RA tissue and 53% in RVP tissue but had no effect on resting membrane potentials. Automaticity was moderately depressed in sinus node (34% decrease in rate) but not in tricuspid valve cells. Phase 0 depolarization was not altered in these spontaneously active slow-response cells. Repolarization was depressed in RA, tricuspid valve, and sinus node cells leading to a twofold increase in action potential duration during exposure to cocaine. Evidence from the effects on cellular action potentials suggests that cocaine affects both fast Na+ channels and repolarizing K+ but not Ca2+ channels. We conclude that cocaine has Class I-type activity and the effects on ERP are extreme.\r"

Several lines of evidence implicate cellular calcium overload as an important etiologic factor. We previously reported an increased number of receptors for calcium antagonist drugs, which block voltage-dependent calcium channels, in heart, skeletal muscle, and brain tissue of these hamsters in the early necrotic stage of the disease. To better characterize the pathophysiological significance of this abnormality we evaluated calcium antagonist receptor binding and Na+-Ca2+ exchange in CM and control hamsters at different stages of disease as documented by quantitative histopathologic assessment. In CM hamsters as young as 10 days, an age previously thought to be before the onset of disease, we identified cardiac myocyte hypertrophy, a twofold increase in calcium antagonist receptor binding in heart and brain, and a 50% increase in skeletal muscle. Overt histological lesions were present in skeletal muscle at 25 days and in heart between 28-30 days. The size of cardiac lesions increased over time and changed from necrotic foci with cellular infiltration to fibrotic or calcified lesions by 360 days. Myocardial cellular hypertrophy persisted through the late stages of the disease (360 days), but increased calcium antagonist binding was present in heart only to 6 months of age, in skeletal muscle to 90 days, and in brain to 30 days. Na+-Ca2+ exchange in heart was normal until 15 days and then increased by 400% at 30 days suggesting that this augmentation might be a secondary response to the earlier increase in calcium antagonist receptors. At 360 days cardiac Na+-Ca2+ exchange was decreased by 50%, likely reflecting progressive cardiac damage. The increase in calcium antagonist receptors in CM animals as young as 10 days supports the hypothesis that abnormalities in voltage-dependent calcium channels play a role in the pathophysiology of CM hamsters.\r"

This synthetic response occurs primarily in the right cardiac atrium, a site distant from the injury, and is not the result of increased enzymatic capacity for arachidonate metabolism. To further investigate the mechanism of this enhanced synthetic response, [3H]fMLP binding was characterized and binding sites were localized autoradiographically in intact tissue sections prepared from control hearts and hearts subjected to left ventricular myocardial infarction (1, 2, and 4 days postinfarction). Analysis of binding isotherms revealed a saturable high affinity (KD approximately 1 nM) fMLP binding site in the right cardiac atrium. After myocardial infarction specific binding in right atria (2 day) increased 12-fold (Bmax = 14.8 +/- 2.4 fmol/cm2) compared with normal controls (Bmax = 1.2 +/- 0.1 fmol/cm2). Specific binding of fMLP also increased in the infarcted zone of left ventricle, but Bmax was only 30-50% that of right atria. Light microscopic autoradiography studies revealed that atrial fMLP binding sites were highly concentrated in small morphologically undifferentiated cells located in interstitial and perivascular spaces. These results demonstrate the existence of a formylated peptide receptor on a nonleukocytic cell and illustrate its regulation following left ventricular injury.\r"

  ".W": "The fate of gap junctions in dissociated adult myocytes, maintained for up to 22 hours in culture medium, was investigated by semiquantitative analysis of thin sections and by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Gap junctions in the dissociated myocyte are intact bimembranous structures seen either as invaginated surface-located structures or as annular profiles in the cytoplasm. Surface-located junctions are sealed from the exterior by a sheet of nonjunctional membrane originating (together with the \"outer\" junctional membrane) from the formerly neighboring cell. Serial sectioning was used to establish that at least part of the annular gap junction population in the freshly isolated myocyte represents truly discrete cytoplasmic vesicles; thus, some gap junctions are rapidly endocytosed after myocyte separation. Analysis of the surface-located-to-annular gap junction ratio suggested that no further endocytosis occurred in rabbit and cat myocytes maintained for 22 and 15 hours, respectively. Guinea pig myocytes, by contrast, did appear to continue endocytosis in culture. Analysis of the distance of gap junctional structures from the cell surface suggested that little if any inward migration of gap junction vesicles occurred. Hypoxia had no detectable effect on the internalization or inward movement of gap junctions. The quantity of ultrastructurally detectable gap junction membrane appeared to remain constant over time, as did the incidence of \"complex structures\" (i.e., annular gap junction profiles with features previously suggested to represent degradation). New gap junction formation was negligible, and a reappraisal of the nature of \"complex structures\" led to the conclusion that the origin of these structures need not be related to degradation. Taken together, the findings suggest that degradation and disappearance of gap junctional membrane after isolation of the mature myocyte constitute a much slower process than previously believed, and the possibility that the cardiac gap junction protein has a longer half-life than its counterpart in liver remains open.\r"

  ".W": "Coronary pressure-flow relations during autoregulated and vasodilated flow states were compared between eight dogs with renovascular hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy and 12 normal dogs. Each relation was constructed from serial steady-state measurements of end-diastolic coronary pressure and flow during perfusion of the circumflex artery by an extracorporeal circuit at controlled diastolic pressures of 20-200 mm Hg. Autoregulated pressure-flow relations were compared at three levels of myocardial oxygen demand: resting, high (dobutamine 10 micrograms/kg/min), and low (propranolol 2.5 micrograms/kg/min). Autoregulatory capacity was assessed by calculation of closed-loop flow gain. At each level of myocardial oxygen demand, the lower limit of autoregulation occurred at higher perfusion pressures in the hypertrophy group (rest 65 +/- 3, high 92 +/- 4, low 66 +/- 4 mm Hg) than in the normal group (rest 53 +/- 2, p less than 0.05; high 75 +/- 5, p less than 0.05; low 51 +/- 3 mm Hg) (p less than 0.05). Maximum autoregulatory gain was similar in the normal and hypertrophy groups during resting and low myocardial oxygen demand but was reduced in the hypertrophy group during dobutamine studies. When coronary flow decreased below the lower limit of autoregulation, systolic shortening was reduced in both normal and hypertrophy groups. However, as the autoregulatory limits were at higher pressures in the hypertrophy group, shortening in this group deteriorated at perfusion pressures that did not affect the normal heart. Coronary pressure-flow relations during physiological (peak hyperemia after 15-second flow occlusion) and pharmacologica (intracoronary adenosine 400 micrograms/min) vasodilation was curvilinear and fitted by quadratic regression. During hyperemic vasodilation, maximal conductance per unit mass of myocardium was less in the hypertrophy group over a wide range of perfusion pressures. At a diastolic perfusion pressure of 80 mm Hg, maximum conductance was 4.6 +/- 0.5 ml/min/100 g/mm Hg in the normal group and 3.4 +/- 0.4 ml/min/100 g/mm Hg (p less than 0.05) in the hypertrophy group. Intracoronary adenosine elicited further vasodilation in both groups, but maximum conductance remained less in the hypertrophy group (8.5 +/- 1.7 ml/min/100 g/mm Hg at a perfusion pressure of 80 mm Hg) than in the normal group (13.5 +/- 2.0 ml/min/100 g/mm Hg) (p less than 0.05). Maximal coronary flow reserve is reduced in left ventricular hypertrophy, with a consequent shift of the lower limit of autoregulation to higher perfusion pressures. Thus, as coronary perfusion pressure is decreased, coronary flow and myocardial shortening become impaired at higher\r"

These changes should alter regional shortening in the LV minor axis. To test this hypothesis, LV minor axis circumferential segment lengths of the septum and anterior, lateral, and posterior walls were measured during pulmonary artery or venae caval constriction in seven open-chest dogs with intact pericardia. Starting at an end-diastolic pressure of 10 mm Hg, venae caval constriction decreased LV end-systolic pressure by 19 +/- 6% and stroke volume by 40 +/- 15% and produced uniform decreases in systolic shortening and end-diastolic length around the minor axis. However, during pulmonary artery constriction resulting in similar decreases in end-systolic pressure (22 +/- 7%) and stroke volume (39 +/- 11%), decreases in systolic shortening were significantly larger in the anterior (-34 +/- 10%) and posterior (-33 +/- 21%) walls than in the septum (-10 +/- 9%) or lateral wall (-8 +/- 13%). The mechanisms of these large anterior and posterior shortening decreases differed: anterior end-diastolic length decreased more than posterior and lateral end-diastolic lengths, while posterior end-systolic length decreased less than anterior and lateral end-systolic lengths. Similar changes were seen at starting end-diastolic pressures of 5 and 15 mm Hg. Propranolol did not alter this nonuniform response, while pericardiectomy attenuated the regional variations. Thus, changes in LV geometry during acute right ventricular pressure overload are associated with nonuniform regional changes in systolic shortening in the LV minor axis that are enhanced by the pericardium.\r"

The results confirmed those of others by showing that the total pool of cardiac AChE had a nonuniform distribution in heart that paralleled the distribution of choline acetyltransferase. The rank order of this distribution was right atrial appendage greater than interatrial septum greater than left atrial appendage = right ventricle = interventricular septum greater than left ventricle. Velocity sedimentation in sucrose gradients of extracts from selected cardiac areas showed that four molecular forms were present in all areas but that the proportions of these forms differed as a function of area. The right and left ventricular walls, the apical portion of the interventricular septum, and the left atrial appendage contained G1 and G4 (globular) AChE in near-equal proportions, but in the basal portion of interventricular septum, the contribution of G4 AChE was greater than that of G1 AChE. The right atrial appendage and the interatrial septum had the largest amount of activity attributable to G4 AChE and the lowest amount attributable to G1 AChE.

Dogs were prepared for reversible vascular isolation of the carotid sinuses. Acute baroreflex resetting was induced by holding the left carotid sinus pressure (LCcsp) at a given value for 20 minutes using a pulsatile pressure control system while at the same time keeping the right carotid sinus pressure (RCSP) at a subthreshold level (approximately 40 mm Hg). At the end of the 20 minutes, the LCcsp) was reduced to approximately 20 mm Hg, and a baroreflex (RCSP-mean arterial pressure [MAP]) curve was generated on the right carotid sinus using static-step increases in carotid sinus pressure. At the control LCcsp of 100 mm Hg, the RCSP-MAP baroreflex had a threshold pressure (Pth) of 86.6 +/- 3.1 mm Hg and a set point pressure (Psp) of 104.7 +/- 2.5 mm Hg. Increasing LCcsp) to 140 mm Hg for 20 minutes caused these parameters for the right carotid baroreflex to increase. Pth and Psp increased by 18.4 +/- 4.0 and 14.2 +/- 3.0 mm Hg, respectively (p less than 0.05). The baroreflex curve, therefore, was shifted upward and to the right. Decreasing LCcsp to 60 mm Hg caused Pth and Psp to decrease by 24.7 +/- 5.0 and 18.1 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively (p less than 0.05). The baroreflex curve was therefore shift downward and to the left. The percent of resetting of Pth and Psp was 46 +/- 9% and 36 +/- 8%, respectively, when LCcsp was 140 mm Hg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study was performed to determine if the changes in cellular coupling induced by simulated ischemia were rate-dependent and if they contributed to the rate-dependent conduction slowing that occurs in this setting. We also sought to determine if the known ability of verapamil to prevent ischemia-induced conduction changes might be related to the preservation of cellular coupling. We studied the effects of increasing stimulation frequency from 0.5 to 2.0 Hz on the simultaneous changes in the maximum rate of rise (Vmax) of the action potential upstroke, conduction velocity, and internal longitudinal resistance (ri) determined by the voltage ratio method in superfused guinea pig papillary muscles under conditions of simulated ischemia (SI). When stimulation frequency was 0.5 Hz, 30 minutes of SI caused a 16.5% decrease in Vmax, a 16% increase in ri, and a 12.9% decrease in conduction velocity. When stimulation frequency was increased to 2.0 Hz, 30 minutes of SI caused a 30% decrease in Vmax, a 72.9% increase in ri, and a 21.4% decrease in conduction velocity. Thus, the changes were rate-dependent. Verapamil (1 X 10(-6) M) did not influence the changes in these parameters during SI at 0.5 Hz nor the decrease in Vmax during SI at 2.0 Hz, but it did prevent the rate-dependent increase in ri. Verapamil also prevented the rate-dependent decrease in conduction velocity induced by SI. Our results suggest that during simulated ischemia the rate-dependent component of the increase in Ri contributes to the rate-dependence of the conduction slowing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The same maximal cycle (five of 10 patients) or treadmill (five of 10 patients) exercise protocol was performed in atrial tachycardia and sinus rhythm 1-232 days after atrial tachycardia (mean, 34 days). Electrocardiogram, heart rate, and pulmonary gas exchange were recorded. Sinus rhythm exercise increased peak VO2 (mean, 28.7 [sinus rhythm] vs. 24.7 [atrial tachycardia], p less than 0.01), exercise time (p less than 0.01), and O2 pulse at rest (p less than 0.01) and at peak exercise (NS). Mean resting heart rate decreased from 109 to 70 beats/min (p less than 0.01). In atrial tachycardia, peak exercise heart rate was low (80-163 beats/min) because of fixed conduction (six of 10 patients) or high as conduction approached 1:1 (176-252 beats/min) (four of 10 patients). In sinus rhythm, rest to peak exercise heart rate increased in six of 10 patients (p less than 0.05). The data show improved exercise performance in sinus rhythm primarily because of improved heart rate adaptation to exercise, by either permitting increased heart rate response or eliminating excessively high heart rate with inadequate diastolic filling.\r"

  ".W": "Previous work has suggested that a comparison of electrograms from two or more sites may best differentiate fibrillatory from nonfibrillatory rhythms. The coherence spectrum is a measure by which two signals may be compared quantitatively in the frequency domain. In the present study, the coherence spectrum was used to quantify the relation between spectral components of electrograms from two sites in either the atrium or ventricle during both fibrillatory and nonfibrillatory rhythms. Bipolar recordings of 35 rhythms from 20 patients were analyzed for coherence in the 1-59 Hz band. The 17 nonfibrillatory rhythms were sinus rhythm (six), paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (two), atrial flutter (four), and monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (five). The 18 fibrillatory rhythms were atrial fibrillation (12) and ventricular fibrillation (six). Nonfibrillatory rhythms exhibited moderate-to-high levels of coherence throughout the 1-59 Hz band, with peaks concentrated at the rhythm's fundamental frequency and its harmonics. Fibrillatory rhythms exhibited little coherence throughout the 1-59 Hz band, and harmonics were not evident. The mean magnitude-squared coherence (scale of 0 to 1) for the 1-59 Hz band ranged from 0.22 to 0.86 (mean +/- SD, 0.52 +/- 0.19) for nonfibrillatory rhythms and from 0.042 to 0.12 (0.067 +/- 0.021) for fibrillatory rhythms. Separation of fibrillatory and nonfibrillatory rhythms was possible whether signals were recorded by floating or fixed-electrode configurations. These findings indicate that comparison of two electrograms with magnitude-squared coherence measurements differentiates fibrillatory from nonfibrillatory rhythms. A recognition algorithm based on coherence spectra may provide a major variations in lead configuration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At 40 msec after the J point, the isopotential maps showed the site of the minimum to be in the left anterior chest in all patients. According to the changes in the position of the minimum from the ST segment to the T wave, postexercise maps were classified into four types. Type A maps (n = 8) were characterized by the persistence of the minimum in the left anterior chest until its negativity decreased and until it became less negative than another minimum that subsequently appeared in a different position. Type B maps (n = 6) were characterized by the gradual movement of the minimum toward the lower thoracic surface. Type C maps (n = 5) were characterized by the gradual movement of the minimum to the left upper direction and then to the back. Type D maps (n = 2) did not show any of the characteristics of A, B, or C.

In protocol 1, repetitive episodes of ventricular fibrillation lasting 15 seconds before transthoracic DC shock were performed in five animals, before (control) and after the administration of BW-A1433U (5 mg/kg i.v.). An unsuccessful initial shock was immediately followed by a rescue shock of 40 A. In ventricular fibrillation episodes requiring rescue shocks, nine of 19 episodes (47%) exhibited second- or third-degree atrioventricular block at 15 seconds postdefibrillation compared with only one of 16 BW-A1433U episodes (6%). In protocol 2, the effect of BW-A1433U was determined in the presence of dipyridamole, a nucleoside uptake blocker known to potentiate the cardiac actions of adenosine. To counter the hypotensive effect of dipyridamole, methoxamine was continuously infused at 0.015 mg/kg/min i.v. Sequential episodes of ventricular fibrillation lasting 45 seconds were terminated by shocks of 40 A in the presence of methoxamine alone, after dipyridamole (1.5-7.5 mg i.v.), and after BW-A1433U (5 mg/kg i.v.). Over the first 15 seconds postdefibrillation, BW-A1433U significantly (p less than 0.05) increased the number of spontaneous beats (31 +/- 2) and systolic/diastolic blood pressure (111 +/- 4/67 +/- 5 mm Hg; mean +/- SEM; n = 9) compared with both methoxamine (16 +/- 2 beats; 98 +/- 14/52 +/- 12 mm Hg; n = 5) and dipyridamole (8 +/- 3 beats; 58 +/- 11/27 +/- 6 mm Hg; n = 9), respectively. Rapid infusion of BW-A1433U during dipyridamole postdefibrillation periods raised heart rate and blood pressure to preventricular fibrillation levels within 30 seconds. Thus, BW-A1433U can reverse and prevent postdefibrillation bradyarrhythmia and hemodynamic depression. Endogenous adenosine may be an important mediator of postdefibrillation cardiovascular collapse.\r"

The aim of our study was to determine whether exercise training that begins after myocardial infarction can similarly increase the ventricular fibrillation threshold.

Thereafter, the ventricular fibrillation threshold was measured before and after the onset of acute reinfarction induced by a second coronary artery ligation. Ventricular fibrillation thresholds were significantly elevated in trained rats during normoxia (13.7 +/- 2.2 vs. 4.7 +/- 0.8 mA, p less than 0.01) and during acute ischemia (6.8 +/- 1.6 vs. 3.0 +/- 0.7 mA, p less than 0.02). The myocardial cyclic AMP level was lower in the nonischemic zone of the trained hearts (0.21 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.28 +/- 0.01 nmol/g, p less than 0.05), which also had lower cyclic AMP levels after epinephrine challenge (0.50 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.73 +/- 0.09 nmol/g, p less than 0.01; 1.41 +/- 0.11 vs. 1.85 +/- 0.09 nmol/g, p less than 0.02 after epinephrine 10(-7) M and 5 x 10(-6) M injection, trained vs. untrained). Both propranolol 10(-6) M and epinephrine 5 x 10(-7) M attenuated the difference in ventricular fibrillation thresholds before and after second coronary artery ligation and eliminated any difference in cyclic AMP content of both the nonischemic and ischemic myocardial tissue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

For example, a reduced heart rate variability has been shown to correlate with an increased mortality in patients recovering from myocardial infarction. The effects that physiologic perturbations such as exercise have on this heart rate variability have not been investigated. Therefore, heart rate variability was measured throughout a submaximal exercise test in 36 mongrel dogs with healed anterior myocardial infarctions. The amplitude of the respiratory component (0.24-1.04 Hz) was determined by time-series analysis techniques and was used as an index of cardiac vagal tone. On a subsequent day, a 2-minute coronary occlusion was initiated during the last minute of exercise. Twenty-two animals developed ventricular fibrillation (susceptible), whereas 14 animals did not (resistant). Exercise elicited a significantly greater increase in heart rate (resistant, 205.4 +/- 7.1; susceptible, 227.0 +/- 5.4 beats/min) in susceptible animals, which was accompanied by a greater reduction in the cardiac vagal tone index (resistant, 2.7 +/- 0.3; susceptible, 1.1 +/- 0.2 ln msec2) as compared with resistant animals. Conversely, atropine sulfate (50 micrograms/kg) given during exercise elicited a greater heart rate increase in the resistant dogs (heart rate change: resistant, 54.2 +/- 7.0; susceptible, 18.7 +/- 4.4 beats/min). Taken together, these data suggest that exercise elicited a greater reduction in cardiac vagal tone in animals known to be susceptible to ventricular fibrillation.\r"

  ".W": "In this study, we investigated the role of oxygen-derived free radicals and iron in mediating myocardial injury during ischemia and reperfusion. Iron is of special interest because it may enhance tissue injury during ischemia and reperfusion by catalyzing the formation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (by modified Haber-Weiss or Fenton reactions). Rat hearts, perfused by the Langendorff method, were subjected to global ischemia (15 minutes at 37 degrees C) and reperfusion. The effects of two iron chelators, 1,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxy-4-pyridone (L1) and 5-hydroxy-2-hydroxymethyl-4-pyrone (kojic acid), and one antioxidant, (+)-cyanidanol-3, on contractile function, coronary flow, lactate dehydrogenase release, and lactate production were studied. The combination of these iron chelators is of special importance because L1 is known to prevent lipid peroxidation, induced by ADP/Fe3+ and NADPH in microsomes, in contrast to kojic acid. We found significant protection of contractile function (apex displacement) during reperfusion with 50 microM L1 and 20 microM (+)-cyanidanol-3 (p less than 0.01, n = 6), whereas no protection was found with 50 microM kojic acid (n = 6). Measurements of lactate dehydrogenase release during reperfusion showed a protective pattern similar to that found for heart contractile function, although 50 microM kojic acid also showed a significantly lower lactate dehydrogenase release during the first 10 minutes of reperfusion. No differences in coronary resistance or lactate release were found between the various groups. Our findings indicate that iron and oxygen-derived free radicals are important in the pathogenesis of postischemic reperfusion injury probably because of the formation of hydroxyl radicals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Local direct current electrograms and [K+]o signals from up to 48 intramural sites were simultaneously recorded in isolated, perfused dog hearts. A second period of one-stage ligation was compared with a consecutive two-stage ligation because reproducibility in [K+]o and electrophysiologic changes are established only after the first period of ischemia. In control experiments, no difference was found between the second and third period of one-stage ligation in the electrophysiologic changes and in increases in [K+]o. After complete occlusion during two-stage ligation, activation block in the ischemic tissue occurred about 6 minutes earlier than during one-stage ligation, but the average potassium concentration at which block occurred was identical. This [K+]o during total ischemia was achieved earlier during two-stage ligation than during one-stage ligation. No indication was found for a large decrease of intracellular potassium content during the period of low flow perfusion. Early activation block may explain the previously reported reduced incidence of ventricular fibrillation during two-stage ligation.\r"

Early angiography (17 +/- 6 hours) was performed in 42 patients and late angiography in 36 patients (5.7 +/- 2.1 days). Twelve patients randomized to late angiography required urgent cardiac catheterization 3.9 +/- 2.2 days after admission. Coronary thrombi were present in 43% (18 of 42) of early angiography patients and in 38% (14 of 36) of late angiography patients (p = NS). Only 21% (five of 24) late elective angiography patients had coronary thrombi, but 75% (nine of 12) of late urgent angiography patients had thrombi (p less than 0.05 vs. both early and late elective angiography patients). There was no difference in the frequency of complex coronary morphology among patients randomized to early angiography (42%, or 15 of 36), late urgent angiography (42%, or five of 12), and late elective angiography (38%, or nine of 24). Cardiac events (death, myocardial infarction, and urgent revascularization) were more frequent in the patients with coronary thrombus (73%, or 23 of 32), complex coronary morphology (55%, or 16 of 29), and multiple-vessel disease (58%, or 29 of 50) than in the patients without these angiographic features (17%, or eight of 46; 31%, or 15 of 49; and 7%, or two of 28, respectively; all p less than 0.05).

We studied 10 closed-chest, anesthetized, and ventilated dogs to assess the effects of volume loading after pulmonary embolism caused by autologous clot. LV, right ventricular, and right atrial pressures as well as LV anteroposterior, septum-to-right ventricular, and septum-to-LV free wall diameters (sonomicrometry) were measured. Pericardial pressure was measured with flat, liquid-containing balloons. The effects of volume loading were assessed before embolism, after one episode of embolization, and after repeated embolizations. The LV area index (as a reflection of LV volume) increased during volume loading before embolism (2,870 +/- 430 to 3,080 +/- 520 mm2; p less than 0.05), did not change significantly during infusion of fluid after one embolization (2,850 +/- 470 to 2,860 +/- 500 mm2; p = NS), and decreased significantly during volume expansion after repeated embolizations (2,760 +/- 440 to 2,660 +/- 420 mm2; p less than 0.01). An index of LV stroke work increased (188 +/- 85 to 260 +/- 101 mm Hg x mm2; p less than 0.05), did not change significantly (188 +/- 39 to 203 +/- 52 mm Hg x mm2; p = NS), and decreased markedly (133 +/- 64 to 45 +/- 27 mm Hg x mm2; p less than 0.001) before embolism, after one embolization, and after repeated embolizations, respectively. The decrease in LV area index during volume loading after repeated embolizations was associated with an increase in septum-to-right ventricular free wall diameter (31 +/- 8 to 34 +/- 8 mm; p = 0.001) and a decrease in the septum-to-LV free wall diameter (44 +/- 5 to 42 +/- 5 mm; p less than 0.001), whereas the LV anteroposterior diameter did not change (62 +/- 5 to 63 +/- 5 mm; p = NS). This is compatible with a leftward septal shift being partially responsible for the decrease in LV end-diastolic volume; such a shift would be expected with the observed decrease in transseptal end-diastolic pressure gradient (-3 +/- 2 to -5 +/- 2 mm Hg; p = 0.001). In addition, after repeated embolizations, LV transmural pressure decreased in response to the volume load reflecting a marked increase in pericardial pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

A total of 250 exposures were performed with 1-6.5 mJ/pulse (fluence = 0.8-5.5 J/cm2), 10-50 Hz, and cumulative exposures of 10-120 seconds. Excimer laser irradiation in combinations of pulse energy (PE), repetition rate (RR), and cumulative exposure below, at, or above threshold for tissue ablation consistently produced relaxation unassociated with contraction in each of the 250 exposures. For the total 250 exposures, the magnitude of relaxation (reduction in recorded tension, Rmax) was 55 +/- 4% (mean +/- SEM) of maximum vasomotor reactivity recorded in the specimen in response to administration of serotonin. Rmax varied directly with both PE and RR. When PE was increased from 1 to 5 mJ/pulse (n = 13), Rmax increased from 57 +/- 19% to 80 +/- 19% (p less than 0.0001); when RR was increased from 10 to 50 Hz (n = 10), Rmax increased from 27 +/- 8 to 46 +/- 8 (p less than 0.0001). Rmax varied independently of endothelial integrity (assessed anatomically and pharmacologically) and wavelength (308 vs. 351 nm).

  ".W": "Follow-up of 18 patients with aortic dissection (five with type I, one with type II, 11 with type III dissection according to DeBakey) by transesophageal, two-dimensional and color-coded Doppler echocardiography showed a persistence of the false lumen in five of seven patients (71%) after surgery and in nine of 11 patients (82%) after medical therapy. In two patients treated with surgery, the dissected part of the aorta had been resected, whereas in two patients treated medically, a progressive and complete obliteration of the false lumen was observed. In the false lumen, thrombus formation was absent in four, localized in four, and progressive in six patients. Flow within the false lumen could be registered in 14 patients, and two distinct flow patterns were differentiated (laminar biphasic flow or slowly circulating flow). Persisting intimal tears were visualized by two-dimensional echocardiography in four patients, whereas color-coded Doppler showed an additional one to three intimal tears in the descending aorta in 10 patients. Flow across these intimal tears was biphasic in 75% of patients; that is, systolic flow was directed from the true to the false lumen with diastolic flow reversal. Unidirectional flow was detected in 25% of the communications, directed in 20% from the true to the false lumen, serving as an entry only and in one (5%) as reentry only. Additional information concerning complications like extension of the dissection (one of 18 patients), localized dilatation of the regurgitation (three of 18 patients) were detected by this method. Concerning the morphologic findings and the detection of flow characteristics, the transesophageal approach was superior to conventional echocardiography especially in the descending thoracic aorta. Thus, transesophageal two-dimensional and color-coded Doppler echocardiography seems to be an ideal method not only for the easy detection of aortic dissection but also for follow-up.\r"

  ".W": "The time courses of onset of the electrophysiologic and antiarrhythmic effects of amiodarone were determined with serial electrophysiologic studies in 34 patients with inducible ventricular tachycardia. A standardized oral loading dosage was used for all patients (1,200 mg/day for 14 days; 800 mg/day for 7 days; and 400 mg/day thereafter). Eleven patients had the studies performed at baseline and after 2, 6, 10, and 20 weeks. Subsequently, 23 patients had studies at baseline and after 2 and 10 weeks. Changes in atrial, sinus, and atrioventricular nodal properties and in conduction intervals were maximal within 2 weeks (early effects). For example, atrioventricular nodal Wenckebach cycle length increased between baseline (369 +/- 80 msec) and 2 weeks (498 +/- 78 msec) (p less than 0.001) but did not change further after 10 weeks (500 +/- 89 msec). However, ventricular Class III effects required 10 weeks to become maximal (late effects). For example, the QT interval during atrial pacing increased between baseline (355 +/- 36 msec) and 2 weeks (406 +/- 37 msec) (p less than 0.001) and increased further after 10 weeks (436 +/- 45 msec) (p less than 0.001). Antiarrhythmic effects also followed different time courses of onset. Suppression of ventricular premature beats was maximal within 2 weeks. However, suppression of ventricular tachycardia inducibility and slowing of ventricular tachycardia rate was not maximal for 10 weeks. Correlations between serum desethylamiodarone concentrations and some late effects suggest that the mechanism of the time delay to maximal ventricular Class III effects may involve desethylamiodarone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Concealed anterograde penetration of the atrioventricular (AV) node has been used to explain a wide variety of electrocardiographic findings. The effects of atrial rate acceleration on this phenomenon remain undefined. To examine the dynamic interrelations between conducted and nonconducted beats at different atrial rates, a unique atrial pacing protocol of functional 2:1 AV block was used in 10 patients. The pacing protocol involved abrupt transitions from 2:1 to 1:1 AV conduction and enabled quantification of conduction delay produced by nonpropagated impulses over extremes of atrial rate. Stable 2:1 AV conduction was maintained over a mean range of atrial paced cycle lengths of 289 +/- 29.6 to 223 +/- 33.0 msec, respectively. The mean AV conduction time during 2:1 and corresponding 1:1 drives at the longest atrial paced rates were 169 +/- 33.5 and 136.5 +/- 26.9 msec, respectively--revealing a significant effect of nonpropagated impulses on subsequent conduction. Surprisingly, at the shortest atrial paced rates, the mean AV conduction times were 191.5 +/- 31.8 and 161.0 +/- 23.3 msec, respectively. The lack of significant changes in conduction time between 2:1 and 1:1 drives at the extremes of atrial rate (32.5 vs. 30 msec, p = NS) suggests that the effect of concealed conduction is \"fixed\" and independent of rate. Clinical implications and postulated electrophysiologic mechanisms are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Cardiotonic agents influence myocardial energy consumption by vasodilation, which may reduce energy demand, and by inotropism, which may increase it. To distinguish between the two effects, myocardial oxygen consumption must be analyzed in relation to its hemodynamic determinants. The coupling of myocardial oxygen consumption with its determinants was investigated in 22 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (NYHA Class II and III). Predicted myocardial oxygen consumption by the pressure-work index, the Bretschneider index, and the pressure-volume area correlated moderately with measured myocardial oxygen consumption (r = 0.57, p less than 0.001; r = 0.52, p less than 0.005; and r = 0.63, p less than 0.001). Multiple regression analysis, including left ventricular peak systolic wall stress, systolic stress-time integral, pressure-volume work, maximum rate of left ventricular pressure rise, and mean velocity of circumferential fiber shortening indicated that systolic stress-time integral is the major determinant of myocardial oxygen consumption (r = 0.75, p less than 0.001) in these patients. Enoximone, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, has an inotropic and a vasodilating effect. To investigate the inotropic portion of the energy cost of this phosphodiesterase inhibitor, the influence of enoximone on myocardial oxygen consumption and systolic stress-time integral was compared with the effects of nitroprusside, which is a vasodilator only. Nitroprusside (10 patients) and enoximone (12 patients) reduced left ventricular systolic stress-time integral from 109 +/- 22 to 71 +/- 21 (p less than 0.005) and from 104 +/- 23 to 42 +/- 10 (p less than 0.001) 10(3) dynes.sec/cm2, respectively. Myocardial oxygen consumption decreased from 159 +/- 44 to 112 +/- 23 (p less than 0.005) and from 134 +/- 28 to 109 +/- 21 (p less than 0.001) microliters/beat/100 g, respectively. In both groups, there was a significant correlation between the decrease in myocardial oxygen consumption and the decrease in systolic stress-time integral. The slopes of the respective linear regression lines were significantly different (1.27 for nitroprusside and 0.51 nl.cm2/100 g.dynes.sec for enoximone, p less than 0.05), indicating a smaller decrease of myocardial oxygen consumption for a given decrease of stress-time integral with enoximone. Applying the pressure-work index or the pressure-volume area instead of systolic stress-time integral yielded comparable results. Thus, vasodilation reduces myocardial oxygen consumption in proportion to the reduction of stress-time integral. With enoximone, the energy-saving effect of vasodilation is counteracted in part by the increased energy d\r"

  ".W": "Digitalis glycosides exert both excitatory and inhibitory autonomic actions in animals and produce vasoconstriction in normal humans but produce vasodilation in heart failure patients. To determine whether or not these contrasting vascular responses are due to differing autonomic actions of the drug, we compared the responses to intravenous administration of Cedilanid-D (0.02 mg/kg) in eight normal subjects (mean age, 23 +/- 1 years) and eight patients with moderate-to-severe heart failure (mean age, 52 +/- 5 years, NYHA Class III-IV). Hemodynamics and efferent sympathetic nerve activity to muscle (MSNA) were measured during 5-minute periods before (control) and 20 minutes after drug administration. In the heart failure patients, Cedilanid-D significantly increased systolic and pulse pressures, whereas mean arterial pressure was unchanged. There was a decrease in right atrial pressure and a tendency for a decrease in pulmonary artery diastolic pressure with a slowing of heart rate. Cardiac index increased by 24 +/- 7%. Short-term administration of digitalis in these heart failure patients produced a fall in forearm vascular resistance (from 37.6 +/- 8.2 to 31.8 +/- 8.1 units, p less than 0.05) and an early, profound, and sustained decrease in MSNA (from 831.0 +/- 118.4 to 474.4 +/- 103.6 units/100 heart beats, p less than 0.01). Digitalis glycosides produced different vascular and MSNA responses in the normal subjects. In the normal volunteers, the drug significantly increased systolic, mean, and pulse pressures and decreased central venous pressure and heart rate. Despite the significant increase in arterial pressure, there was no change in forearm vascular resistance (from 11.7 +/- 1.0 to 12.7 +/- 1.0 units, p = NS) or MSNA (from 494.8 +/- 88.5 to 369.1 +/- 60.5 units/100 heart beats, p = NS), suggesting a sympathoexcitatory response in normal subjects. To determine whether or not the digitalis-induced sympathoinhibition in the heart failure patients was simply due to an inotropic effect (stimulation of inhibitory cardiac mechanoreceptors), we studied the responses of seven additional patients with heart failure before and during administration of dobutamine (3.4 +/- 0.4 micrograms/kg/min). Dobutamine produced a 34 +/- 3% increase in cardiac index, no significant change in systemic arterial pressures, a decrease in pulmonary artery diastolic and right atrial pressures, and no change in heart rate or forearm vascular resistance (from 30.2 +/- 4.3 to 26.5 +/- 4.7 units, p = NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Hence, 10 apparently normal subjects, eight men and two women, mean age 46 +/- 9 years, were studied before and during mental arithmetic stress. Changes in forearm venous volume were estimated with 99mTc blood pool scintigraphy. Group variability of this measurement technique was 1.8 +/- 2.3%. A brachial blood pressure cuff was used to obtain venous occluding pressures of 0, 10, 20, and 30 mm Hg. Mental arithmetic stress increased group systolic and diastolic blood pressure from 126 +/- 12 to 152 +/- 20 mm Hg and from 83 +/- 8 to 93 +/- 15 mm Hg, respectively (p less than 0.001). Heart rate increased from a mean of 75 +/- 15 to 85 +/- 17 beats/min (p less than 0.01). There was no evidence of interaction between or nonlinearity of the volume-pressure plots. Linear regression then yielded the equations V = 99.8 + 0.96P before and V = 86.3 + 0.96P during mental arithmetic stress, which represents a 13.5 +/- 1.6% decrease in forearm vascular volume (p less than 0.001). We conclude that 1) a linear relation exists between forearm venous volume and pressure at physiologic pressures before and during mental arithmetic stress; 2) mental arithmetic stress causes forearm venoconstriction; and 3) such venoconstriction takes place by a parallel shift in the volume-pressure relation (i.e., a shift in unstressed venous volume).\r"

To determine the role of sun exposure, we used a light box to administer artificial ultraviolet B radiation during the winter months in New York City. Eleven male stone formers and 7 age- and sex-matched controls received 10 UVB light exposures over a two-week period while maintaining a 400 mg calcium diet. 25-OH vitamin D levels increased significantly (p less than 0.001) in both patients (25.9 +/- 9.8 to 51.6 +/- 14.1 ng/ml) and controls (21.3 +/- 7.1 to 49.6 +/- 3.1 ng/ml). However, 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D levels rose in the patients (50.8 +/- 14.8 to 55.9 +/- 13.1 pg/ml) but fell (60.1 +/- 6.5 to 49.4 +/- 3.1 pg/ml) in the controls. Only 2 of the 11 patients but all of the controls demonstrated this down regulation of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D levels (p less than 0.002). 24,25 dihydroxyvitamin D levels tended to rise in both groups but parathyroid hormone levels were unchanged. There was a trend, which did not reach statistical significance, for parameters of calcium excretion to increase after UVB radiation. 24-hour urinary calcium excretion rose 24% from 140 to 173 mg in the patients and 31% from 113 to 148 mg in the controls. The ratio of calcium/creatinine following a one gram calcium load showed a small increase after UVB radiation from 0.17 to 0.20 in patients and 0.118 to 0.124 in the controls. However, no correlation could be discerned between changes in vitamin D metabolite concentrations and changes in urinary calcium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Fifty episodes of peritonitis occurred during a total of 422 patient-months of observation. S. aureus was responsible for 16 episodes of peritonitis diagnosed in 15 patients. All episodes of S. aureus peritonitis occurred in chronic and intermittent carriers. Phage typing was performed on isolates from 8 patients with S. aureus peritonitis, and they were found to have the same phage type as that previously carried in the skin.

Five children with Grade III-IV ICH had severe neurologic, cognitive, and MRI deficits, including MRI regional and diffuse white matter abnormalities and/or cortical atrophy. Focal and diffuse neurologic deficits correlated with the extent of MRI morphologic abnormalities. Results of this study indicate that ICH severity correlated with outcomes in children at follow-up; the more severe the ICH, the more adverse the neurologic, cognitive, and MRI results.

  ".W": "The functioning of 17 children who had been abducted by one parent but subsequently returned was examined. The parent to whom the child was returned completed a behavior rating scale on the child for each of three time periods: pre-abduction, immediately post-abduction, and follow-up (the present time). The parents also completed a measure regarding the coping strategy they utilized while the child was missing and a measure of their own functioning at each of three times: pre-abduction, during the abduction, and follow-up. The results indicated that the child was rated as functioning worse immediately post-abduction than at pre-abduction and at follow-up was functioning between that reported at pre-abduction and post-abduction. However, the level of maladjustment was not in the severe range at any of the assessments. Parents reported using a problem-focused or action style of coping. Parents also reported that their psychological functioning decreased during abduction and then improved at follow-up. Again, functioning was not in the severe range at any assessment. Variables such as age at the time of abduction and length of abduction were only minimumally related to parent or child functioning.\r"

  ".W": "While the identification of a growth-retarded or otherwise undernourished child suggests a diagnosis of child abuse or neglect, it is not certain that abused children from poor communities are less well nourished than children living in similar environments. The setting of this study--day care centers in an urban poor city--provided an opportunity to make this comparison with appropriate community-based controls. Measures of height, weight, and weight/height (Body Mass Index (BMI] were compared for 196 children, 2 to 6 years of age, 53 of whom were victims of physical abuse. The data was adjusted for age, sex, and ethnicity using logistic regression analysis to determine occurrence of wasting (weight for height less than 5th percentile) and stunting (height for age less than 5th percentile). Significantly more abused children (16.3%) showed wasting as compared to non-abused (0.7%) with abused children 16.6 times more likely to show wasting than non-abused (95% confidence limits on the Odds Ratio 1.9-145.0). While 11.6 percent of abused children showed stunting compared to 5.6 percent of non-abused, this difference was not significant when the data was adjusted for demographic factors. The BMI (15.02 kg/m2) for abused children was significantly less than that (15.9 kg/m2) for non-abused children (F = 8.11; p = 0.0049). In the present study, significant wasting as seen in acute malnutrition was found among abused children at diagnosis, suggesting that within an urban poor community the growth of children so identified does differ from the growth of children who are not abused.\r"

However, HR can also be caused by secretion of a phosphaturetic factor from a tumor. The presentation of patients with the different HR syndromes may be identical. Distinguishing between the HR syndromes is essential, however, because HR caused by renal defect requires life-long therapy with Vitamin D and phosphate replacement, but tumor-associated HR is cured by removal of the tumor. A case of hemangiopericytoma occurring in bone and causing HR is reported. Children with HR typically have normal levels of serum calcium and parathyroid hormone but very low levels of serum phosphorus. In a child with HR, the following features should prompt a thorough evaluation for a causative tumor: lack of other family members who have hypophosphatemia; presence of aminoaciduria, particularly glycinuria. Causative lesions are most commonly found in the bone or skin.\r"

Indirect calorimetry and primed constant infusion of [U-13C]glucose were combined in 28 appropriate-for-gestational age newborn, parenterally fed infants, in order to measure glucose utilization and glucose oxidation and to estimate lipogenesis from glucose. 2. The infants were randomly allocated to either a group receiving glucose as the non-protein energy source or a group having one-quarter of the glucose energy replaced by intravenous fat. The energy intake (370 kJ day-1 kg-1) and protein intake (3.4 g day-1 kg-1) were similar in both groups. 3. Energy expenditure (P less than 0.005), non-protein carbon dioxide production (P less than 0.005) and non-protein oxygen consumption (P less than 0.05) were lower in the lipid-supplemented group. 4. The significant excess of glucose utilization over oxidation (P less than 0.001) can be accounted for by lipid synthesis from glucose. 5. Fat synthesis from glucose was higher in the glucose/amino acid group (P less than 0.02), but total fat storage was higher in the lipid-supplemented group (P less than 0.02). Nitrogen balance was similar in both groups. 6. As lipogenesis from glucose is an energy- and oxygen-consuming and a carbon dioxide-producing process, the data suggest that the differences between the glucose-only group and the lipid-supplemented group are due to different rates of lipogenesis from glucose.\r"

Alterations in Ca2+ handling by the vascular smooth muscle cells seem to underlie these disorders. Alveolar hypoxia also constricts pulmonary arteries, increasing the intracellular Ca2+ availability for smooth muscle contraction. This suggests the hypothesis that hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction depends on similar biochemical disorders, and that the response to the hypoxic stimulus may be emphasized in high blood pressure. 2. In 21 hypertensive and 10 normotensive men, pulmonary arterial pressure and arteriolar resistance have been evaluated during air respiration and after 15 min of breathing 17, 15 and 12% oxygen in nitrogen. Curves relating changes in pulmonary arterial pressure and arteriolar resistance to the oxygen content of inspired gas had a similar configuration in the two populations, but in hypertension were steeper and significantly shifted to the left of those in normotension, reflecting a lower threshold and an enhanced vasoconstrictor reactivity. 3. This pattern was not related to differences in severity of the hypoxic stimulus, degree of hypocapnia and respiratory alkalosis induced by hypoxia, and plasma catecholamines. 4. The association of high blood pressure with enhanced pulmonary vasoreactivity to alveolar hypoxia could have clinical implications in patients who are chronically hypoxic and have systemic hypertension.\r"

Platelets from diabetic subjects were more sensitive than platelets from normal subjects, extents of aggregation being 89% and 76%, respectively (P less than 0.002). 3. Stimulation with thrombin (0.3 unit/ml) elicited marked platelet release of noradrenaline to the incubation medium in both normal and diabetic subjects.

Measurement of platelet noradrenaline contents after thrombin stimulation revealed no difference between normal and diabetic subjects. Under resting conditions, however, platelet noradrenaline levels were significantly lower (-46%, P less than 0.02) for diabetic than normal subjects. Thus, in the diabetic subjects increased resting platelet efflux of noradrenaline is mirrored by a decreased platelet noradrenaline content. 5.

  ".U": "89288938\r", 
  ".W": "1. In this study we have investigated the effects of a novel inotropic agent, pimobendan (UDCG 115-BS), on skinned and intact ventricular muscle from ferrets. 2. Pimobendan (20 or 100 mumol/l) increased tension at a given free [Ca2+] when applied to skinned ventricular muscle, i.e. it increased the Ca2+ sensitivity of the myofibrils. 3. Tension and intracellular free Ca2+ [( Ca2+]i) were measured simultaneously in intact papillary muscles using the aequorin technique. When 25 mumol/l pimobendan was added to the superfusing solution, a slowly developing positive ionotropic effect was produced, which was accompanied by an increase in the size of the systolic rise in [Ca2+]i (Ca2+ transients) with a similar time course. 4. In order to determine whether pimobendan increased the Ca2+ sensitivity of myofibrils in an intact papillary muscle, we compared the increase in Ca2+ transients and tension observed in response to changes in extracellular [Ca2+] with those observed in response to pimobendan. The result of this comparison was that in intact muscle pimobendan caused no apparent increase in myofibrillar Ca2+ sensitivity. 5. Pimobendan caused an abbreviation of the time course of the Ca2+ transients, but the twitch was slightly prolonged. 6. When isoprenaline was added to the superfusing solution, a positive inotropic effect was produced, which was accompanied by a marked increase in the size of the Ca2+ transients. Isoprenaline caused an abbreviation of the time course of both the Ca2+ transients and the twitch. When the Ca2+ sensitivity of the intact myofibrils was determined as described above, isoprenaline caused a desensitization. Pimobendan produced a sensitization when compared with isoprenaline. 7. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that pimobendan produces an inotropic effect in isolated cardiac muscle which is mediated both by an increase in Ca2+ sensitivity and by an increase in adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate due to its phosphodiesterase-inhibiting activity. Such a combination of activities may be particularly advantageous for an inotropic agent.\r"

Basal levels of adrenaline did not differ on any of the study occasions: the cold-pressor stimulus produced a significant rise in mean plasma adrenaline to a peak of 0.16 nmol/l, with a peak incremental rise of 0.08 nmol/l. In the presence of the two higher doses of naloxone, the incremental rise in the mean adrenaline level was significantly enhanced, reaching 0.30 nmol/l at 100 micrograms of naloxone/kg and 0.29 nmol/l at 250 micrograms of naloxone/kg, with no significant enhancement observed at the lowest dose of naloxone. The rise in plasma noradrenaline, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate during the cold-pressor test was not consistently altered by any dose of naloxone, but there was a significant trend for the degree of discomfort to increase with the dose of naloxone. 3.

A commercial amino acid solution supplemented with two synthetic dipeptides, L-alanyl-L-glutamine (Ala-Gln) and glycyl-L-tyrosine (Gly-Tyr), or alternatively with isonitrogenous amounts of free alanine and glycine has been continuously infused over 4 h in six apparently healthy volunteers. 2. The infusion of the solutions was not accompanied by any side effects and the volunteers reported no complaints. 3. Infusion of the alanine- and glycine-supplemented control solution resulted in an increase of the concentration of these amino acids, while no appreciable change in free glutamine concentration was observed and free tyrosine revealed a steady decrease throughout the infusion. 4. Infusion of the peptide-supplemented solution resulted in a prompt equimolar liberation of the constituent free amino acids (glutamine, alanine, tyrosine and glycine), approaching steady state after about 30 min infusion, while only trace but stable concentrations of the two dipeptides were measured throughout the infusion. No peptides were detectable in urine. The findings suggest a nearly quantitative extracellular hydrolysis of the infused dipeptides and indicate a subsequent utilization of the liberated free amino acids. 5. The estimated metabolic clearance rates and total body plasma clearances were very similar for the two dipeptides (Ala-Gln 35.9 +/- 9.5 ml min-1 kg-1 and 2.9 +/- 0.9 l/min, respectively; Gly-Tyr 33.7 +/- 9.5 ml min-1 kg-1 and 2.7 +/- 0.9 l/min, respectively); thus there is little difference in the metabolic handling of these dipeptides.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In one group of animals, the movements of K+ and H+ were determined during and after a KCl load, and in another group, amiloride was used in order to evaluate Na+ participation in K+/H+ exchange. 2. After a KCl load at constant PCO2, 79% of infused K+ left the inulin space, half of which was in exchange for H+. As a result, blood pH fell from 7.40 +/- 0.01 to 7.30 +/- 0.01 (mean +/- SEM; P less than 0.001). 3. During KCl infusion, the K+/H+ exchange ratio varied between 1.3 and 6.8, showing that the coupling ratio is not fixed. 4. Amiloride did not change blood pH and plasma [K+], but prevented the metabolic acidosis produced by the KCl load without affecting K+ entry into the non-inulin space. Therefore, K+ and H+ movements became completely dissociated. 5. The results indicate that KCl activates an amiloride-sensitive H+ extrusion from the cells. This finding is compatible with the view that Na+/H+ exchange participates in the metabolic acidosis produced by a KCl load.\r"

Angiotensin II (ANG II; 1 ng min-1 kg-1) or 5% (w/v) D-glucose (placebo) was infused in six normal male volunteers, pretreated with 500 mg of lithium carbonate, who were undergoing maximal water diuresis. 2. This dose of ANG II caused a circulating increment within the physiological range (27 +/- 4 to 48 +/- 9 pmol/l). 3. Compared with placebo, ANG II caused a significant fall in urinary sodium excretion (113 +/- 13 to 82 +/- 10 mumol/min). This antinatriuretic effect occurred without a fall in creatinine clearance (107 +/- 3 versus 113 +/- 3 ml/min). 4. ANG II caused a significant fall in fractional lithium clearance (28 +/- 2 to 23 +/- 2%). This may indicate a proximal tubular effect of ANG II. 5. ANG II also reduced fractional distal delivery [(sodium clearance plus free water clearance) divided by creatinine clearance], another measure of proximal tubular outflow. A parallel change in these two separate markers of proximal function supports an action of ANG II at this nephron segment. 6. Furthermore, the antinatriuretic effect of ANG II was unlikely to be due to stimulation of aldosterone secretion because (a) the fall in sodium excretion was temporally dissociated from the rise in aldosterone secretion, (b) potassium excretion also tended to fall during ANG II infusion and (c) aldosterone has a distal nephron effect, while, in this study, proximal nephron fractional reabsorption of sodium increased and distal nephron fractional reabsorption of sodium was unchanged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Control mean arterial blood pressure and total peripheral resistance were similar in adult animals of the two strains but were significantly lower in the young BDI rats compared with the young LE rats. 3. The three doses of vasopressin produced greater pressor responses in the young, immature LE rats compared with the young BDI rats, whereas in the adult animals vasopressin had the greater pressor effect in the BDI rats compared with the LE rats of comparable age. 4. There was little effect of vasopressin on cardiac output after the initial decrease, particularly in the BDI rats whether immature or adult, despite more prolonged decreases in heart rate. 5.

The effect of breath-hold time was investigated by comparing Qc estimated using 6 and 10 s of breath-holding in 17 patients. Repeatability was assessed by duplicate measurements of Qc in the patients and in six normal subjects. 3. Qc tended to overestimate Qf, the bias and error being 0.09 l/min and 0.59, respectively. The coefficient of repeatability for Qc in the patients was 0.75 l/min and in the normal subjects was 0.66 l/min. For Qf it was 0.72 l/min.

The agents were administered at the moment that pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) tended to rise and cardiac output started to decrease. After administration, systemic arterial BP, PAP, systemic and pulmonary (PVR) vascular resistance, and right ventricular stroke work (RVSW) decreased significantly in both groups. The decrease in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (p less than .01), PVR (p less than .01), and RVSW (p less than .05) was significantly more pronounced in the KET than in the SNP group. Qsp/Qt significantly (p less than .001) increased in the SNP group, but significantly (p less than .05) decreased in the KET group; the response was significantly different between the two groups (p less than .001). In six patients, SNP converted pacemaker-dependent heart rate into a spontaneous rhythm, whereas this occurred in only one patient in the KET group. We concluded that KET, as opposed to SNP, reduces PVR without increasing Qsp/Qt in the lung, which is particularly advantageous in patients after valvular surgery.\r"

Clinical condition was scored by daily determination of the simplified acute physiology score (SAPS). Day-to-day variation of TEE was significantly (p less than .0001) influenced by body temperature, but not by SAPS or day of measurement. In the individual patient, day-to-day variability of TEE may be large. When TEE on day 1 is used to estimate TEE on subsequent days, errors of up to 31% of actual TEE occurred. Addition of a temperature correction reduced the maximum error to 25%. If a balance between caloric supply and demand is intended, it is advised to adapt the caloric supply to the result of daily TEE measurement by indirect calorimetry.\r"

On admission, only the absence of spontaneous breathing was significantly predictive of an unfavorable outcome. The failure of response to painful stimulation and pupillary light reflex became significantly predictive of an unfavorable outcome only in the late inhospital course. The time delay before onset of CPR was significantly longer in unconscious patients, but in this group no difference was observed between survivors and nonsurvivors. At discharge, no patient was in a comatose or vegetative state; three patients showed severe neurologic impairment.

All of them were treated initially with conventional therapy, aprotinin as protease inhibitor and vitamin C with allopurinol as possible scavengers of oxygen-free radicals, were also added. After 24 h of no clinical progress, continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration (CAVH), CAVH/dialysis (CAVH/D), and sequential plasmafilter-dialysis with slow continuous hemofiltration (CAVHP/D) were respectively added to groups 2 (n = 14), 3 (n = 6), and 4 (n = 11). Mortality was 87% for group 1, 71% for group 2, 50% for group 3, and 36% for group 4. In the latter we were able to remove possible MOF-inducing mediators from the bloodstream, to give fluids without restriction (even in oliguric patients), and to improve removal of metabolic waste products. It is possible that these extracorporeal supports, associated with conventional therapy, and pharmacologic drugs such as protease inhibitors and possible scavengers of oxygen-free radicals, helped to reduce the mortality rate. We conclude that, although the number of study patients was too small to reach firm conclusions, the good results observed with CAVHP/D suggest clinical trials to assess the efficacy of this technique.\r"

Two groups of pentobarbital-anesthetized pigs (13 to 17 kg) were studied. The first group (LPS; n = 9) was infused over 20 min with Escherichia coli LPS (100 micrograms/kg) and resuscitated with normal saline (1.2 ml/kg.min). The second group (NS; n = 5) was not infused with LPS, but was resuscitated in the same way as the LPS group. Superior mesenteric arterial (SMA) blood flow and ileal intramucosal hydrogen ion concentration, [H+], were determined using a Doppler-shift probe and a tonometric catheter, respectively. Infusing LPS did not affect CI, although mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance were significantly reduced. SMA flow and mesenteric DO2 decreased significantly in the LPS group. Although mesenteric oxygen utilization was well preserved in both groups, ileal intramucosal [H+] was significantly higher in endotoxic animals. These data support the idea that mesenteric oxygen consumption is flow-limited in this clinically relevant porcine model of septic shock.\r"

Whether both remain intact after oleic acid lung injury has not been assessed. In an asymmetric model of right lung oleic acid edema, we examined the relative magnitude of each component on the HPV response to right lung inspired hypoxia. Before oleic acid administration, right lung hypoxia decreased perfusion to the right lung from 1.41 +/- 0.12 to 1.16 +/- 0.15 L/min (p = .07), while PAP increased from 15.8 +/- 0.8 to 18.1 +/- 0.6 mm Hg (p less than .05). Regional hypoxia caused right lung pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) to increase from 480 +/- 45 to 797 +/- 114 dyne.sec/cm5 (p less than .01). After right lung injury with oleic acid, regional hypoxia decreased perfusion to the right lung from 0.91 +/- 0.11 to 0.71 +/- 0.10 L/min (p less than .05), while PAP increased from 18.8 +/- 0.8 to 21.5 +/- 1.0 mm Hg (p less than .05). With hypoxia, right lung PVR increased from 1232 +/- 260 to 1933 +/- 336 dyne.sec/cm5 (p less than .01). We conclude that the pulmonary vasoconstrictive response to inspired hypoxia persists after oleic acid lung injury, causing significant increases in PVR. Consequently, both the blood flow redistribution and the PAP augmentation components of the HPV response to inspired hypoxia remain unchanged.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of low dose almitrine bismesylate on pulmonary gas exchange, venous admixture, and pulmonary perfusion were examined in a canine one-lung hypoxic model. The left lung was ventilated with 10.4% oxygen, 89.3% nitrogen, and 0.3% halothane, while the right lung was ventilated with 99.7% oxygen and 0.3% halothane. Group 1 (n = 8) was given no other drug for 60 min. In group 2 (n = 10), consecutive almitrine doses of 0.5, 1, and 2 micrograms/kg.min were administered iv for 20 min/dose. Blood gas and central hemodynamic values remained unchanged in group 1. In group 2, significant increases in PaO2 and significant decreases in venous admixture, dependent on the dose administered, were observed. Mean PaO2 increased from 222 +/- 78 (SD) to 292 +/- 75 torr, and mean venous admixture decreased from 22 +/- 7% to 18 +/- 6% at 2 micrograms/kg.min. Both the decrease in mean left pulmonary blood flow and the increase in mean right pulmonary blood flow were slight, although the cardiac output was unchanged. These results indicate that iv infusion of 2 micrograms/kg.min of almitrine weakly enhances pulmonary vasoconstriction in a hypoxic area and improves pulmonary gas exchange in a moderately hypoxic condition.\r"

The work of breathing associated with ETT of 6 to 9-mm diameter and eight breathing devices was determined, using a lung simulator to mimic spontaneous inspiration at flow rates of 20 to 100 L/min and a tidal volume of 500 ml, at both zero end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP) and 10 cm H2O continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Work associated with the breathing devices alone (WCIR) ranged from -0.002 kg.m/L (Servo 900-C ventilator, 7-mm ETT, 20 L/min, ZEEP) to 0.1 kg.m/L (continuous flow circuit, 7-mm ETT, 100 L/min, CPAP), the latter representing 196% of the work of normal breathing. When the devices were attached to ETT, total apparatus work (WAPP) ranged from 0.009 kg.m/L (Mapleson-D circuit, 9-mm ETT, 20 L/min, ZEEP) to 0.25 kg.m/L (Drager EV-A, 6-mm ETT, 100 L/min, ZEEP), the latter representing 490% of the work of normal breathing. This additional work imposed by the ETT varied considerably among devices. Spontaneous breathing through modern ventilators, circuits and ETT imposes a burden of increased work, most of which is associated with the presence of the ETT and connector. Whether this burden represents an impediment to the weaning patient, or has training value for the ultimate resumption of unassisted spontaneous ventilation, remains to be determined.\r"

Simultaneous measurements were obtained from each instrument in eight healthy nonsmoking volunteers rendered hypoxic greater than 70% SpO2. Functional arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), fractional SaO2 (%HbO2), and percent fraction of carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO) and methemoglobin (MetHb) were determined by a cooximeter. The difference between SaO2 and %HbO2 was 2.3 +/- 0.3 (SD) % (p less than .001) with 1.4 +/- 0.1% HbCO and 0.9 +/- 0.1% MetHb. The SpO2 values in two instruments were close to %HbO2, while the other instruments correlated approximately with SaO2. The greatest SpO2 difference among the instruments was 2.7 +/- 1.9% (p less than .001). These results may indicate that, under normal dyshemoglobin levels, some pulse oximeters are calibrated to estimate SaO2 and others to estimate %HbO2. Since the pulse oximeter using two wavelengths cannot measure accurately %HbO2 or SaO2 in the presence of dyshemoglobin, SpO2 values would be independent from %HbO2 and SaO2. A standard calibration method for pulse oximeters should be established by the manufacturers.\r"

Five PEV from three manufacturers were adapted to an artificial lung for varying compliance and resistance. Each PEV was tested in the \"no airmix\" (pure oxygen) and \"airmix\" (approximately 60% oxygen) setting at different frequencies and VE. Measurement of delivered VE (VEdel) was made using a pneumotachograph and digital integration of the flow values greater than 1 min (maximal error +/- 2%). Maximal inspiratory pressure (Pinsp) was measured with a transducer. Two PEV from one manufacturer produced severe hyperventilation when used at low VE (i.e., in children). Two other PEV from another manufacturer produced less marked hyperventilation, but revealed unexpected hypoventilation during conditions of higher inspiratory pressures (i.e., in adults with reduced compliance). The prototype PEV that was tested also revealed less marked hyperventilation with small decreases (down to -10% of the VE at higher Pinsp values). Further investigation is needed before this prototype goes into production. Manufacturers should redefine predicted values or machine settings or indicate that use of these devices may produce results which are not in accordance with the machine settings. Until adjustments are made, ventilation should be monitored when possible by measurement of end-tidal PCO2 or systemic arterial blood gases.\r"

Exceeding a concentration of 0.1 normal is not recommended when HCl is infused through PA catheters.\r"

Diplomates were admitted to the examination through four pathways requiring formal training in CCM and two practice pathways; 89% of the diplomates entered through the practice pathways. The absolute standard for the examination resulted in a total group pass rate of 64% (n = 1,725); the pass rate for diplomates with training in CCM was 84%. Examination performance was positively associated with months of critical care training, earlier ABIM examination scores, certification in pulmonary medicine, program directors' ratings of overall clinical competence, and several factors associated with the critical care work environment.\r"

Patients had a mean VT which approximated their FEV1 and increased their VE predominantly by increasing their respiratory frequency. During the low intensity test, despite the differences in work load, the patients had comparable heart rates and VE. No resting spirometric value accurately predicted work load, VE, or maximal VO2. We conclude that patients have a reduced work tolerance that is not adequately explained by their reduced lung function.

Dopamine increased MAP, HR, CI, PvO2, DO2, and Qsp while decreasing PaO2. Dobutamine increased HR, CI, SI, stroke work, DO2, VO2, and Qsp while decreasing PAWP and SVRI and PVRI. In general, the effects of the two drugs were greater in patients in the first 72 hours after surgery. The effects of dobutamine on flow and oxygen transport were greater than those of dopamine, especially in the early postoperative period. The effects were smaller and not significant in patients more than three days after surgery, as well as in those with sepsis, respiratory failure, renal failure, age over 65 years, and hyperdynamic states, in part because of the small number of patients in each group. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the beta 2-adrenergic action of dobutamine vasodilates the previously constricted peripheral circulation, enhances tissue perfusion by improving micro-circulatory flow distribution, and improves DO2 and VO2.\r"

We used the diaphragmatic EMG to provide direct evidence of persistent contractile activity and studied the effects of alterations in ventilator-delivered flow rate and tidal volume on the duration of diaphragmatic contraction. The duration of contraction was expressed in terms of inspired volume. During a single breath, diaphragmatic force generation ceases at the point of peak electromyographic activity; hence, the inspired volume at peak EMG is the volume at the diaphragmatic off-switch (Voff). Ventilator-delivered flow rate and tidal volume were varied during assisted (patient-initiated) and controlled (ventilator-initiated) breaths while diaphragmatic EMG and inspired volume were recorded simultaneously in ten patients with a variety of illnesses requiring mechanical ventilation. Spontaneous ventilator-unassisted breaths were also recorded for comparison. We found that (1) during assisted breaths, diaphragmatic activity continued after the ventilator was triggered, (2) Voff was usually close to spontaneous tidal volume, (3) Voff increased significantly as ventilator-delivered flow rate increased, and (4) controlled breaths may also be associated with phasic electromyographic activity. The data have implications for resting patients on assisted ventilation.\r"

Recent Shwachman scores and the number of hospitalizations during the study period were used to assess outcome. All study cases were alive one to six years after the episode of RF/MV. Their mean Shwachman score (83 [range: 70 to 95]) did not differ from the recent mean Shwachman score (78 [range: 50 to 95]) of the control group. Number of hospitalizations did not differ between groups. We conclude that the outcome of infants with cystic fibrosis whose initial presentation is RF/MV is not as grave as once thought.

Four years later, after a 22.5-kg weight gain, nocturnal apneas of similar frequency, duration, and depth of desaturation reappeared but were totally central in origin. The central apneas were eliminated with home nocturnal positive-pressure ventilation via cuffed tracheostomy tube. Each time the patient's apneas were corrected (obstructive: tracheostomy; central: mechanical ventilation), daytime alveolar hypoventilation disappeared rapidly. Yearly right heart catheterizations and radionuclide ejection fractions documented pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure, with resolution following tracheostomy and recurrence after appearance of central apneas. The changes in hemodynamic status corresponded to the patient's weight, presence of apnea, daytime alveolar hypoventilation, and treatment of nocturnal oxyhemoglobin desaturation. This case illustrates the theory of a common etiology of both central and obstructive apnea through abnormal respiratory controller gain and points to several roles obesity may play in apnea.\r"

In individuals with roentgenographic evidence of asbestosis (CXR greater than or equal to 1/0, n = 15), 13 had a positive GLS and 13 had an abnormal BAL. In asbestos-exposed individuals with equivocal chest x-ray film changes (CXR 0/1, n = 12), six had a positive GLS and six had BAL changes (both GLS and BAL abnormal in three). In individuals with a normal chest x-ray film (CXR 0/0 n = 8), two had a positive GLS and two BAL changes (both abnormal in 1). These data demonstrate that most subjects with crocidolite-induced asbestosis have an abnormal GLS and BAL. In addition, many individuals with asbestos exposure and equivocal or no chest x-ray film changes have an abnormal GLS and/or BAL, suggesting the presence of active subclinical pulmonary inflammation in these individuals.\r"

The control group received saline solution in the same fashion. The EACA-treated group had decreased chest tube blood loss 24 h postoperatively. In addition, EACA-treated patients had fewer myocardial infarctions, cerebrovascular accidents or reoperations for bleeding. Treated patients needed fewer units of blood transfusions than the nontreated group. There was no incidence of hyperthrombotic state or other side effects in the EACA-treated group. We concluded that prophylactic treatment with EACA for open-heart surgery requiring extracorporeal circulation may reduce the total blood loss and the number of blood transfusions in a safe and tolerable manner.\r"

An IPVD rating of 2.2 in Down's syndrome and 2.1 without the syndrome were regarded as the upper permissible limits for surgical intervention based on results of 23 autopsies and 26 lung biopsies of patients operated on before 1981. Open lung biopsy was performed in 51 patients to determine applicability of our operative indications. Twenty-nine cases were considered operable by our criteria, and 28 underwent surgical correction without operative or late death. Twenty-two cases thought inoperable remain under observation. Comparative analysis of the pathology and preoperative hemodynamic data suggested that lung biopsy should be carried out to determine operability in cases with pulmonary vascular resistance greater than 8 units.m2.\r"

Cure was attained in intrinsic asthma with a predominance of nocturnal crises, associated with nocturnal tracheitis and with significant reflux, objective signs of which had appeared before the beginning of the asthma. Other results concerned asthmas complicated secondarily by GER in which it was impossible to determine whether the reflux was only a complication, without effect on the respiratory illness, or exacerbating the asthma. The question of surgery in these patients should be considered with care, being reserved for cases of severe asthma, poorly controlled by antiasthmatic drugs, and complicated by a severe reflux that encompasses ulcerative esophagitis.\r"

Peak expiratory flow during cough was significantly lower in asthma than in TBCS, acute bronchitis or FPD. Duration of the first cough sound was longer in asthma than in FPD, TBCS or chronic bronchitis. The number of additional cough sounds was smaller in asthma than in the other conditions. The highest frequency components of cough sound were lower in asthma than in chronic bronchitis or TBCS. The results indicate that pulmonary diseases differ with respect to acoustic and dynamic characteristics of spontaneous cough. This finding may prove useful in the diagnosis of cough.\r"

Fifty-nine patients with a variety of both benign (33) and malignant (26) pulmonary disorders had specimens divided and submitted for both FCA and routine cytologic examination. The presence of an \"obviously visible\" second, aneuploid peak on the DNA histograms proved to be highly specific for the presence of malignancy, but lacked sensitivity.

Based on data derived from automated 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, atenolol decreased the average whole-day systolic pressure by 18 +/- 6 mm Hg (p less than 0.02) and the diastolic pressure by 11 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). Lisinopril produced decreases of 27 +/- 5 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) and 13 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). Examination of the 24-h blood pressure patterns showed that the efficacies of the two drugs were similar. Each appeared to be effective throughout the whole-day monitoring period, although only lisinopril significantly decreased blood pressure during the final four-h period (4 AM to 8 AM) preceding the next day's dose. Neither drug produced significant echocardiographic changes in left ventricular wall thickness or muscle mass during the short-term treatment. Lisinopril and atenolol effectively decrease blood pressure during a 24-h period. Moreover, we found that automated whole-day blood pressure monitoring is a useful tool for comparing the efficacy and duration of action of differing antihypertensive agents.\r"

Seven patients with FAP required pacemaker treatment during eight years. The most frequent bradyarrhythmias requiring pacing were sinus node dysfunction with junctional failure. Our seven patients had attacks and symptoms of bradyarrhythmias. A pacemaker relieved symptoms of bradycardias with recurrence of dislocation of electrode, exit block, and relatively high threshold. However, pacing did not improve the ultimate prognosis of FAP, because of progressive inanition of FAP. In our series, pacing should have been started earlier before advanced stage according to the ECG findings as in other diseases with bradycardias.\r"

Measures of respiratory muscle endurance-maximum load tolerated, mean mouth pressure at maximum load and peak pressure at maximum load were reproducible over three tests with the spontaneously chosen breathing pattern. There was no difference in these measurements between the three tests with fixed breathing frequency. There was no difference in tidal volume, inspiratory time, and the ratio of inspiratory time to total breath duration between the tests in which breathing pattern was spontaneously chosen; there was a difference in these measurements between the tests with a fixed breathing frequency. We conclude that regulation of breathing frequency is unnecessary in the two-minute threshold loading test to obtain reproducible results for measures of respiratory muscle endurance.\r"

During separate rebreathing runs of progressive isocapnic hypoxia and normoxic hypercapnia, breath-to-breath changes in RL and Cdyn were determined. In five of the six normal subjects, seven of the seven asthmatic subjects, and six of the seven subjects with IPD, RL decreased with both progressive hypoxia and hypercapnia without a change in Cdyn. In the patients with COPD, the effects of hypoxia and hypercapnia on RL and Cdyn were variable. Compared to normal subjects, the changes in RL during hypoxia and hypercapnia were not significantly different in the asthmatic subjects and the patients with IPD. These data provide evidence that acute progressive hypoxia and hypercapnia are associated with significant changes in Raw in both normal subjects and patients with chronic pulmonary disease.\r"

Only when there is global peace is it possible for international scientific societies to flourish. Peace provides the opportunity for clinical trials on a large scale and for the exchange of scientists, surgeons, and surgical trainees. The Society has established a Secretariat, a central bureau where requests about acquisition of new skills or details of research opportunities may be directed, advertised, and relayed.\r"

We therefore preserved this portion of the gastrointestinal tract in 12 patients who underwent restorative proctocolectomy for ulcerative colitis. In each patient, the entire anal sphincter was preserved without mucosal stripping: the two sphincters were connected by a single loop of ileum without any reservoir. After median follow-up of 12 months, the functional results were similar to those seen with conventional pelvic ileal reservoirs and superior to the results of mucosal proctectomy and straight endoanal ileoanal anastomosis. This operation may be an alternative to standard restorative proctocolectomy for patients with ulcerative colitis.\r"

Inflammatory complications were observed in the perineal colostomy area during the early postoperative period in eight patients. These complications were accounted for by necrosis of the distal colon and transplanted muscle in two patients. There were no deaths. Satisfactory functional results were seen in 22 of 26 patients six months after surgery. Physiologic studies show that there is a functioning sphincter at the site of the perineal colostomy.\r"

The postoperative mortality was 5.4 percent, which was not significantly different from that in the total group of patients with rectal cancer (4.9 percent) operated upon during the same period. After multivisceral resections, 49.5 percent of patients developed postoperative complications. In the total group of patients with rectal cancer, the postoperative morbidity was 30.3 percent. Long-term results were assessed in 190 patients who had been operated upon more than five years ago. It has been established that 42.1 percent of patients lived more than five years after multivisceral resections. Hope is inspired by the fact that of 15 patients with hepatic metastases (26 percent) lived over five years following radical surgery. These data allow the conclusion that radical surgery for advanced rectal cancer is justifiable and advisable.\r"

The results are encouraging. The rectal reservoir is spared, with its sensitivity, continence and motor activity covered by healthy mucosa. The dogs thrived.\r"
