Nerv Ment Dis 177:480-486) which found that subjects with multiple personality disorder (MPD) experienced significantly more changes in visual functioning between alter personalities than a control group simulating the disorder. In the present study, data from 20 patients diagnosed with MPD and 20 control subjects role playing MPD were analyzed for statistical and clinical significance. The findings from the present study appear to confirm results from the earlier study that individuals with MPD experience differences in some aspects of visual functioning between alter personalities. The results further confirm that MPD subjects experience more differences across visual measures than control subjects simulating the disorder. However, the findings from the present study are not entirely consistent across the various visual measures or with findings from previous studies.\r"

This study examined gender differences in postpartum depressive symptomatology and the link between postpartum symptomatology and gender roles and relationships in a sample obtained from childbirth preparation classes. The data show no gender difference in depressive symptomatology at 2 months after childbirth. Women manifested a decrease in depressive symptomatology and men showed a slight increase from the preparenthood point. We partially link women's equivalent rather than higher distress levels to the protective effects of their varied social supports. By contrast, men depended primarily on their spouses, but both genders experienced a decrease in spouse support after childbirth. Female lack of support was more strongly associated with symptomatology in homemakers compared with employed women or women on maternity leave. Within the context of gender role changes, the data highlight benefits of female bonding in contrast to the \"costs of caring\" depicted by other researchers.\r"

The effects of the riot on the utilization pattern of the only psychiatric emergency service (PES) for the Liberty City catchment area were studied in two ways: autocorrelation and cross-correlation analyses were used to determine whether PES presentations demonstrated a 7-day cycle and whether this cycle was disturbed by the riot; and analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were used to compare numerically the riot week to the preceding week, the riot week to the following 12 weeks, and the 12 pre-riot weeks to the 12 post-riot weeks. Black PES presentations did not demonstrate a statistically discernable cycle, and none of the ANOVAs were statistically significant. It was concluded that the riot did not have a significant psychiatric morbidity effect as measured by PES presentation data. These results are discussed in reference to previous disaster studies.\r"

That is not to suggest that clinical investigations should be put on hold while the entire focus of research shifts to the laboratory bench. Clinical studies of very early RA, including early treatment interventions, would appear to be of major importance. However, better characterization of the early clinical course and identification of pathologic markers of progressive disease are needed before formal randomized treatment studies of early disease can be initiated. The entire role of aggressive management, particularly with combination chemotherapy, at any stage of RA is in desperate need of answers. In clinical practice it would appear that combination chemotherapy is widely used, often as a last resort in treatment resistant patients who have failed conventional therapies. The published clinical studies would seem to support, but certainly not prove, a valuable potential role for combination chemotherapy in this setting. Moreover, the studies seem to indicate some increased risk of drug toxicities, the limitations of which are not readily apparent for most combinations. Based on the successes observed in these patients that are very difficult to treat, the possibility of a more fundamental role of combination chemotherapy in treatment of the disease has been advocated. These questions need to be resolved by well designed, randomized controlled trials. There is an urgent need to do the trials soon before combination chemotherapy gains an even stronger foothold in therapy.\r"

Mean resorption indices (RI) at 0.2 U/ml were 1.28 and 1.49, and at 20 U/ml, were 1.82 and 1.72, respectively. Calcium release was abrogated by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor piroxicam. Thymocyte stimulating activity (TSA) 25-31 kDa alone at 0.14 U/ml released calcium in a prostaglandin dependent manner with a mean RI of 2.13, a significantly greater calcium release than that obtained by 17 kDa IL-1 at 20 U/ml. The 6-9 kDa inhibitor of IL-1 induced thymocyte proliferation alone also released calcium in a prostaglandin dependent manner with a mean RI of 2.29 at 200 inhibitory U/ml. Addition of 6-9 kDa IL-1 inhibitor to the 25-31 kDa material did not significantly change the calcium release, whereas addition of the inhibitor to 17 kDa IL-1 produced a significant increase in calcium release.\r"

IL-1 activity and production were measured by its effect on the proliferation of murine thymocytes; IL-1 inhibitor production was assayed by inhibition of IL-1 mediated thymocyte proliferation. Dexamethasone (10-100 nM) inhibited IL-1 production and IL-1 mediated thymocyte proliferation. High concentrations of indomethacin, aspirin, and 12 other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) inhibited IL-1 activity, or production or both. Methotrexate inhibited IL-1 activity without affecting IL-1 production. D-penicillamine inhibited IL-1 activity and tended to inhibit IL-1 production. Gold compounds inhibited IL-1 activity, but only auranofin inhibited IL-1 production. Acetaminophen in high concentrations (1 mg/ml) inhibited IL-1 activity and production. Colchicine inhibited IL-1 activity but not IL-1 production. No drug tested induced, by itself, the production of IL-1 inhibitor or enhanced the production of IL-1 inhibitor.\r"

Twenty-five percent of the patients would have been missed had the study included hospital patients only. A clinical pattern different from previous studies was found as illustrated by a low incidence of kidney disease; nephritis was found in 20% of patients. Comparison with a former study on SLE in Iceland shows an actual increase in incidence over a period of 10 years. The 5 year survival was 84% and the 10 year survival 78%.\r"

Sixteen patients were antinuclear antibody positive and 2 anticentromere antibody positive. Eight patients produced antivimentin, 5 antimitochondrial, 4 anti-Golgi complex, and 3 anticentriol antibodies. Eleven patients produced antidesmosome antibodies. Only one patient (anti-RNP and antidesmosome antibody positive) developed a systemic disease (mixed connective tissue disease) during followup. The initial screening of sera may help to classify Raynaud's phenomenon as idiopathic more accurately.\r"

In 55 of 91 patients (60%) PLA2 was more than 1 SD and in 6 (7%) more than 2 SD below the normal mean. Serum pancreatic PLA2 was also significantly lower in SSc. The prevalence of low serum total PLA2 was significantly greater (p less than 0.001) than in healthy adults, or in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus or vasculitis. Repeat assays of PLA2 activity in 10 patients with SSc documented persistence of low PLA2. Among 76 patients with SSc with complete clinical and laboratory assessment, there were 48 with low and 28 with normal (or slightly elevated) PLA2. These 2 groups showed no differences in disease manifestation or therapy. The group with low serum PLA2 had lower erythrocyte sedimentation rates (p less than 0.0005) and lower neutrophil (p less than 0.05) and monocyte counts (p less than 0.025) in the peripheral blood. The finding of low serum PLA2 activity adds to the spectrum of arachidonic acid pathway abnormalities associated with SSc, and may in part be related to the paucity of inflammatory changes observed in this disease.\r"

Our results are expressed as reactivity coefficients. The mean of AGP reactivity coefficients (AG-RC +/- SD) in PMR (0.92 +/- 0.17) and GCA/PMR (0.91 +/- 0.12) were significantly lower compared with the mean AG-RC in patients with PM/DM (1.48 +/- 0.52) as well as in healthy individuals (1.34 +/- 0.9). Moreover, an additional microheterogeneous form of AGP was noted in patients with PM/DM. In parallel, we also found that the mean of ACHT reactivity coefficients (AC-RC +/- SD) were lower in patients with PMR (2.94 +/- 1.24) and GCA/PMR (1.66 +/- 0.16) compared with healthy individuals (3.92 +/- 1.17). The mean of AC-RC in patients with PM/DM (6.74 +/- 4.35) was significantly higher than in patients with PMR and GCA/PMR as well as in healthy individuals.

  ".W": "Low density lipoprotein (LDL) has previously been demonstrated to be a potent inhibitor of human inflammatory cell activation by monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in vitro. As suppression of cellular responses to crystals by LDL is known to be dependent on the binding of LDL to urate crystals we further evaluated the mechanism and regulation of LDL binding to urate crystals in vitro. Using nonlinear, least squares methodology to analyze binding, we found LDL to saturably and reversibly bind with high affinity (Kd 9.3 x 10(-9) M) to MSU crystals. LDL binding was competitively inhibited by LDL but not by a variety of other positively charged moieties. Glycosaminoglycans (GAG) (heparin, heparan sulfate, hyaluronate and chondroitin sulfate), in diminishing order of potency, inhibited the binding of LDL to crystals. This inhibitory activity was dose dependent, sensitive to digestion with glycosidases and appeared to be specific for polymerized GAG, as glucuronic acid, dextran, dextran sulfate, as well as isolated amino sugar constituents of GAG were either weakly inhibitory or inactive. GAG also promoted dissociation of bound LDL from the urate crystal surface. The results indicate that LDL binds saturably and reversibly to urate crystals and that polymerized, but not depolymerized, hyaluronate and other GAG inhibit LDL binding to urate crystals. This suggests that the amount of LDL coating intraarticular urate crystals could vary during the course of a gouty paroxysm.\r"

In the three months before intervention, only 38% of urines were drug-free, while 55% were drug-free during the three-month intervention. Marked improvement occurred during the first month, while later the effect faded. Nine patients discontinued or reduced drug abuse, arriving at stable or fluctuating dose, and did not detoxify. Five others continued drug abuse, eventually reducing their methadone doses to zero. The procedure at least temporarily reduced drug abuse among the former group, but lack of uniformity in applying contingencies may have weakened the effect. Considering the spreading AIDS epidemic, we review the confusing literature on management of still-abusing methadone maintenance patients and suggest a protocol for their treatment.\r"

A significant delay was shown in the time to progression (p = 0.0010) with 70% of the patients assigned to chemotherapy free of disease at 3 years compared to 46% in the observation group. Median survival time for patients in the chemotherapy group was 4.3 years compared to 2.4 years in the observation group (p = 0.0062). In addition to treatment groups, important prognostic factors included age, gender and lymph node status. The number of involved lymph nodes was the single most important variable. We recommend adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with invasive transitional cell carcinoma after definitive surgical resection.\r"

Arteriography demonstrated underlying lesions in 4 of these 5 cases (80%) including the case of vasculitis. CT combined with magnetic resonance imaging is accurate for the diagnosis of spontaneous perinephric hemorrhage but the underlying pathological condition is often undetectable in the acute phase due to the perinephric blood. CT should be the first study performed if this diagnosis is suspected. Arteriography is recommended if a renal mass is not detected. If a mass is not identified with these 2 imaging studies and the patient is clinically stable, followup thin slice CT should be performed.\r"

The indications for this parenchyma-sparing procedure were categorized according to the initial status of the contralateral kidney and included bilateral tumors or tumor in a solitary kidney in 16 patients (mandatory indications), unilateral carcinoma with compromise of the contralateral kidney by a benign disease process in 9 (relative indications) and small peripheral tumor with a normal contralateral kidney in 19 (elective indications). There were 4 recurrences that accounted for 3 deaths, all in patients with mandatory indications. All patients who underwent partial nephrectomy for relative or elective indications were without definite evidence of recurrent disease at last followup (over-all mean 36 months). Our results suggest that conservative surgery can often provide effective and advantageous therapy for renal cancer and we encourage further consideration of the role of partial nephrectomy as an alternative to radical nephrectomy in selected patients with small peripheral tumors and normal contralateral kidneys.\r"

This rate increased to 86.8% with the addition of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, ureteroscopy or open surgery (2 patients). Only 1 patient suffered long-term deterioration in renal function. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy is a safe procedure in the solitary kidney. It should be considered in those patients with complex stone burdens and impaired renal function when reduction in stone bulk and improved renal function may allow other treatment modalities to be used.\r"

In situ disintegration with ultrasound or electrohydraulic lithotripsy was necessary in 15 moieties (83.3%) and nephrostomy drainage was required in 12 (66.7%). Percutaneous access was not a problem and there were minimal perioperative problems. Blood transfusion was required postoperatively in 2 patients. A total of 14 kidneys (77.8%) were rendered free of stone with percutaneous nephrolithotomy alone and 2 kidneys were left with asymptomatic stone fragments of 2 mm. or less. Another 2 kidneys became free of stone after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, thus giving an over-all stone clearance rate of 88.8%. We conclude that percutaneous nephrolithotomy is an acceptable treatment for stones in horseshoe kidneys and it is the treatment of choice for patients in whom imaging is difficult or impossible.\r"

Metal staples were not used. The results were satisfactory except for 2 patients who became incontinent because of prolapse of the nipple in one and insufficient valve function due to ischemic change of the nipple valve in the other.

Of 1,247 men who had first-time procedures sperm were present in the semen in 865 of 1,012 men (86%) who had postoperative semen analyses, and pregnancy occurred in 421 of 810 couples (52%) for whom information regarding conception was available. Rates of patency (return of sperm to the semen) and pregnancy varied depending on the interval from the vasectomy until its reversal. If the interval had been less than 3 years patency was 97% and pregnancy 76%, 3 to 8 years 88% and 53%, 9 to 14 years 79% and 44% and 15 years or more 71% and 30%. The patency and pregnancy rates were no better after 2-layer microsurgical vasovasostomy than after modified 1-layer microsurgical procedures and they were statistically the same for all patients regardless of the surgeon. When sperm were absent from the intraoperative vas fluid bilaterally and the patient underwent bilateral vasovasostomy rather than vasoepididymostomy, patency occurred in 50 of 83 patients (60%) and pregnancy in 20 of 65 couples (31%). Neither presence nor absence of a sperm granuloma at the vasectomy site nor type of anesthesia affected results. Repeat microsurgical reversal procedures were less successful. A total of 222 repeat operations produced patency in 150 of 199 patients (75%) who had semen analyses and pregnancy was reported in 52 of 120 couples (43%).\r"

Stress incontinence was present in 46 patients (8%), of whom 34 (6%) wore 1 or fewer pads per day and 2 (0.3%) required placement of an artificial sphincter. No patient was totally incontinent. Age, weight of the prostate, prior transurethral resection of the prostate, pathological stage and preservation or wide excision of the neurovascular bundles had no significant influence on preservation of urinary control. These data suggest that anatomical factors rather than preservation of autonomic innervation may be responsible for the improved urinary control associated with an anatomical approach to radical prostatectomy.\r"

All patients underwent 7.0 MHz. sagittal ultrasound guided transrectal biopsy followed by digitally directed transrectal biopsy. Biopsies were obtained only from the area of interest. The procedure was performed in the outpatient clinic without use of sedation or anesthesia. Digitally directed biopsies were positive for adenocarcinoma in 9 lesions. Ultrasound guided biopsies detected adenocarcinoma in 23 lesions, including all those detected by the blind digitally directed technique. This study demonstrates greater diagnostic accuracy using 7.0 MHz. ultrasound guided techniques and its routine use is warranted in the evaluation of palpable prostatic abnormalities.\r"

During the followup period of 7 to 10 years disease progression was noted in 27 patients (36%) treated with estrogen and 39 (51%) orchiectomized patients. The free of progression survival rate was significantly better (less than 0.05) among the estrogen treated patients but the over-all survival rates after orchiectomy and estrogen treatment were almost identical. A significantly higher frequency of cardiovascular side effects was noted in the estrogen group (23 cases) compared to the orchiectomy group (4 cases). Therefore, estrogen treatment in this form cannot be recommended for the palliative treatment of prostate cancer.\r"

  ".U": "91148123\r", 
  ".W": "Between 1977 and 1988, 131 patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate underwent combined radical prostatectomy and intraoperative radioactive gold seed placement. Of these 131 patients 80 were clinically assessed as having stage A2 (12), B1 (43) or B2 (25) cancer and they are the subject of this review. The average dose of radioactivity administered to each patient was 96.6 mCi, and mean followup was 65 months (median 64 months). No patient in this series received any other form of adjuvant therapy until disease recurrence was demonstrated. Local recurrences were observed in 2 patients (2.5%) in this series while distant recurrences were observed in 10 (12.5%). Cancer specific survival free of disease at 5 years was 100% for clinical stage A2, 91% for B1 and 75% for B2 cancers. The 10-year survival free of disease was 100% for clinical stage A2, 82% for B1 and 68% for B2 cancers. Covariants of clinical stage and seminal vesicle involvement influenced survival free of disease in a statistically significant manner (p less than 0.05) while pathological stage and degree of tumor differentiation did not. Mild to severe complications were observed in 12 patients (15%). Intraoperative placement of radioactive gold seeds into unresected pelvic tissues surrounding the site of prostatectomy offers a theoretical advantage in treatment by delivering tumoricidal levels of irradiation to residual foci of cancer not appreciated at the time of surgery. Our results suggest that increases in cancer specific survival free of disease over that previously reported for prostatectomy alone may be achieved through this combined treatment regimen. Furthermore, it is our opinion that therapeutic gains can be achieved without the attendant increases in morbidity and treatment delay often associated with adjuvant external beam radiotherapy.\r"

The score includes consideration of bladder compliance, detrusor contractility and reflux, in addition to leak pressure and sphincter behavior. In 171 myelodysplastic patients a significant correlation was demonstrated between the score and upper tract studies at the time of urodynamics and the score and the management decision.

All patients are continent by day and only 3 are incontinent during the night to a degree that necessitates use of a condom catheter. Two patients awaken every 2 to 3 hours to void and the remainder have nocturia comparable to normal men of their age. The residual volume was 0 to 70 ml. The urethral closure pressure was normal, and in 3 patients studied preoperatively and postoperatively no significant change was observed other than shortening of the profile length. Maximal flow rates were normal although the pattern was intermittent. In 2 patients no cystoplasty contractions were recorded and in all but 2 patients the amplitude of the contractions was less than 40 cm. water. Simultaneous bladder and urethral pressure recordings during bladder filling demonstrated no change in urethral pressure in 10 patients. Although creation of a reservoir with a low pressure and careful preservation of the infraprostatic urethra are important for continence in these patients, we believe that the absence of normal sacral route reflexes after cystoprostatectomy is an important contributing cause to nocturnal incontinence.\r"

More abnormalities were detected by DMSA study when compared to scars on IVP. When both studies were abnormal there was an excellent correlation on a site by site basis. Fever or systemic disorder was not a reliable sign to determine whether there was upper tract involvement with infection. The incidence of DMSA abnormalities in infants increased with high grade vesicoureteral reflux and decreased with low grade reflux. There was no significant difference in the incidence of abnormal kidneys between the infected and noninfected groups, suggesting that renal scarring may occur with sterile reflux.\r"

A reversible model of hydronephrosis is used to prepare one renal unit for nephrostomy tube placement. An 0.8 mm. silastic nephrostomy tube is introduced into the hydronephrotic kidney via a 16 gauge angiocath. The nephrostomy tube is then connected to an Alzet mini osmotic pump which is implanted in a subcutaneous location. The ability of this system to deliver a continuous dose of a test agent into the bladder was evaluated. Pumps were filled with a 1% solution of methylene blue in phosphate buffered saline. Following pump implantation, urinary samples were collected on a daily basis and subsequently analyzed for their concentration of methylene blue. At the completion of the experiment, specimens of the kidney, ureter, and bladder were histologically examined. Results demonstrated an average of 102% recovery of the theoretically delivered dose over a 14-day period. Renal histology demonstrated chronic inflammatory changes at the site of nephrostomy tube placement. No upper or lower tract urothelial changes were identified. This model provides a system for the continuous delivery of drugs in the rat urinary tract and results in no histological alteration to the lower urinary tract.\r"

The greatest density of nerves in the bladder from \"control\" patients contained neuropeptide Y, followed in a decreasing order by vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, calcitonin gene-related peptide, substance P and somatostatin. Neuropeptide Y- and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-immunoreactive nerves were found throughout the smooth muscle and the base of the mucosa, while calcitonin gene-related peptide-, substance P- and somatostatin-immunoreactive nerves were found predominantly in nerve bundles with a few single fibres at the base of the mucosa. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-, neuropeptide Y- and calcitonin gene-related peptide-immunoreactive nerves were also located around blood vessels. In patients with lower motor neurone lesion, there was a decrease in the density of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-, calcitonin gene-related peptide- and substance P-immunoreactive nerves, but there was little change in neuropeptide Y- or somatostatin-immunoreactive nerves.

The concentrations were assessed to 28.6 pmol/gm. (CC) and 15.8 pmol/gm. (CV) respectively. Gel filtration on CC tissue extracts demonstrated a single peak of NPY-immunoreactivity (NPY-IR) similar to synthetic human NPY. The NPY-IR was confined to nerve fibers seemingly innervating smooth muscle cells. In vitro myographic examinations demonstrated contractile activation by NPY in 2/8 CC strips and in 5/8 CV strips. The mean contractile force was 1.17 +/- 0.62 mN (18.3 +/- 15.8% of the K(+)-induced contraction) and 2.42 +/- 0.42 mN (31 +/- 12%) respectively. NPY 10(-7) and 10(-6) M displayed a potentiating effect on the response to NA 10(-9) in one of six CC and four of six CV preparations. It is suggested that NPY could add to the contractile effect of NA in detumescence and in maintenance of the resting state; contribution of NPY to the veno-occlusive mechanism at initiation of erection is another putative physiological function.\r"

  ".W": "Most urologists treating stone disease with any method (ESWL, PCL, URS) have encountered problems of poor stone visualization with fluoroscopy. This difficulty to localize urinary tract (UT) stones or fragments may result in incomplete stone extraction, prolonged surgery and increased risk of recurrence and post-operative complications. We have sought and found means to increase the radioopacity of mineral UT stones by a simple pre-operative perfusion technique. The capacity of radioopacification has first been demonstrated in in vitro incubations of fragments of human mineral stones with aqueous solutions of barium, of the lanthanides and of the two natural actinides. Most of the incubations led to considerable radio-contrast enhancement and heavy metal incorporation, measured by X-ray fluorescence analysis. Dogs with implanted human stone fragments were used as an in vivo model. The UT were perfused through a retrograde pyelic catheter with heavy metal salts solutions, the ensuing radioopacification of the implanted UT-stones was estimated by abdominal radiographies and the metal incorporation was measured on the retrieved stones. Considerable radioopacity enhancement together with heavy metal incorporation was observed for the following elements: Sr, Ba and the lanthanides Gd and Yb. The pathological evaluation of the urothelial linings from animals treated with lanthanide salt showed no toxic effects.\r"

The effects of suramin on cultured human epithelial cells derived from normal, benign hyperplastic, and malignant prostate tissues were examined. In serum-free medium, suramin inhibited the clonal growth of prostate cells at a half-maximal dose of approximately 10 micrograms/ml. Growth inhibition by suramin was completely reversible even after 24 hours of exposure. In conjunction, suramin did not alter cellular phenotype with regard to expression of keratins and prostate-specific antigens. Although suramin is reportedly an antagonist of growth factor-mediated mitogenesis, ten-fold excesses of growth factors did not appreciably suppress the cytostatic activity of suramin. In comparison to the activities of other possible chemotherapeutic agents, suramin would appear suboptimal because its inhibitory effects are reversible and it does not induce a terminally differentiated cellular phenotype.\r"

Plasma testosterone levels in mice were correlated to tumor growth and intratumor concentrations of testosterone and 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone. PC-82 tumor burden remained stable at plasma testosterone levels of 0.8 nmol/l., whereas tumor growth occurred at higher levels and tumor regression was observed at lower plasma levels. This critical level of testosterone corresponded with intratumor testosterone and 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone concentrations of six to 10 and three to four pmol/gm. tissue, respectively, which are significantly above the levels found in castrated non-supplemented animals (3.1 and 1.4 pmol/gm. respectively). This indicates that remaining concentrations of dihydrotestosterone, which amount to two to three times the castrate level, are not stimulatory for tumor growth in the model of the androgen dependent PC-82 tumor.\r"

Ten of the animals then underwent 8 shockwave treatments (2500 shocks per treatment), alternately to the upper and lower pole of the kidney, at two weeks intervals. A total of 20,000 shock waves were administered to each minipig over the four month period. The five control pigs underwent sham procedures. The renal function and blood pressure evaluations were then repeated. No significant decrease in renal function was noted in the experimental animals when compared to the controls. In addition, renin mediated hypertension was not observed despite the excessive number of total shock waves delivered to the kidney.\r"

Stimulation of severed hypogastric nerves caused full volume seminal emission (greater than four drops) in all six dogs examined. In contrast, stimulation of sympathetic trunks of other six dogs at the level of caudal mesenteric artery caused no emission in three dogs and a limited volume of seminal emission (less than one drop) by pressing the ampulla in the remaining. When hypogastric nerves were transected one month prior to the experiment, however, stimulation of sympathetic trunks in the same manner caused full volume of seminal emission in all six dogs. Distal dissection of sympathetic trunks demonstrated nerve fibers to the seminal tract via the pelvic splanchnic nerves. The results indicate that the seminal tract receives at least two sympathetic pathways; one from hypogastric nerves and the other from lumbosacral sympathetic trunks, and that the latter compensatorily generates seminal emission after hypogastric nerve transection.\r"

We attempted to verify these clinical findings and establish the temporal relationship of the alteration in the Doppler spectrum to the onset of urinary obstruction by evaluating surgically induced urinary obstruction in dogs. We performed laparotomies on 11 dogs, with the left ureter isolated and ligated in five dogs, and left intact in six dogs (control group). Duplex Doppler examination of the left renal arteries performed nine times during the first postoperative month identified a statistically significant difference (p less than .05) in the Doppler resistive index calculation between the two groups on days 1, 2, 4, and week 4. A resistive index discriminatory threshold of 0.7 (greater than 0.7, obstructed; less than 0.7, nonobstructed) produced a test sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 77%. We conclude from our study that renal arterial duplex Doppler sonography can detect a change in renal perfusion as a result of urinary obstruction and that this change can be detected as early as 24 hours after obstruction. However, high false-positive and false-negative rates may limit the ability of this modality to reliably distinguish obstructive from nonobstructive collecting system dilatation.\r"

  ".W": "A rodent bladder cancer model that is induced by intravesical instillation of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) was characterized. Cohorts of four to five week old female Fisher 344 rats received four biweekly 1.5 mg. doses of intravesical MNU and were sacrificed at various intervals. By week 13 all animals had flat atypia and/or papillary transitional cell tumors, and 67% of the lesions were moderately (grade II) or poorly differentiated (grade III). By week 20, 83% had gross muscle invasive tumors that eventually killed the host. A cohort of 40 MNU treated animals was subsequently treated commencing at week 17 after initiation of MNU with one of three intravesical six week regimens: 1) saline; 2) BCG (Tice strain); or 3) recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (RTNF) plus adriamycin. There was no difference in animal survival or tumor growth in any group of animals commencing therapy at week 17. A second cohort of 107 animals commenced therapy at 13 weeks after initiation of MNU with one of five intravesical six week regimens: 1) intravesical BCG (Tice strain); 2) adriamycin; 3) recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (RTNF); 4) RTNF plus adriamycin; or 5) BCG plus adriamycin. BCG, RTNF or adriamycin alone had no effect on tumor growth; however, BCG plus adriamycin and RTNF plus adriamycin commencing at week 13 significantly inhibited tumor growth and progression. In conclusion, this autochthonous intravesical rodent transitional cell carcinoma model appears useful for the following reasons: 1) it closely resembles human transitional cell carcinoma histologically and biologically in that all animals develop neoplastic changes in-situ that progress to muscle invasion and kill the host; 2) as with human bladder cancer these tumors do not respond to intravesical therapy if treated when tumor burden is large; however, tumor growth is inhibited when treated early; and 3) this model appears appropriate for screening and developing new intravesical treatments for superficial bladder cancer.\r"

When tumors reached a size of approximately 200 mm.3, they were treated with either radiation (X) or hyperthermia (H) alone, or in combination (X + H). In the combined treatment, hyperthermia was delivered immediately after radiation exposure. Comparison of the time required to reach twice the tumor volume observed at the time of treatment was used to define therapeutic impact on tumor growth. The combined treatment resulted in median tumor volume doubling time of 35.5 days, compared to 18 days and 25.5 days, respectively, for hyperthermia or radiation alone. Analysis of tumor doubling time using a proportional hazards regression indicates that under the conditions of this experiment, the effect of radiation and hyperthermia for 1-LN-PC-3-1A tumors is additive. The impact of this treatment regimen in the management of prostatic cancer requires further investigation.\r"

Accumulation of urine in the renal pelvis and collecting ducts resulted in the appearance of a new peak in the localized phosphorus spectra originating in the renal papilla, resonating at 3.43 to 4.56 ppm. This was inorganic phosphate with a pH of 5.60 to 6.79 (urine pH). Imaging did not show any dilatation of renal pelvis. There was a significant time dependent fall in renal [ATP] during urinary obstruction followed by a rapid \"overshoot\" of [ATP] and disappearance of the phosphate peak after release of obstruction. Possible mechanisms for this phenomenon are discussed. We conclude that 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy provides early evidence of urinary obstruction in vivo and could be of value in clinical diagnosis.\r"

TIL from renal cell cancer (RCC) typically exhibit diminished growth and antitumor activity after four weeks in vitro. We have therefore investigated effects of varying doses of interleukin-6 (IL-6) (0, 25, 100 units/ml.) on in vitro expansion, proliferation, cytotoxicity, and expression of cell surface phenotypes of long term renal TIL cultures from three RCC patients. Among the various conditions tested, three of three TIL cultures displayed a mild increase in cell expansion when grown in IL-2 with the addition of 100 units/ml. of IL-6. Two of three TIL cultures grown in IL-2 and 100 U/ml. of IL-6 demonstrated enhanced proliferation as determined by 3H-thymidine uptake. TIL could not be isolated or maintained in vitro when grown in the presence of IL-6 alone without IL-2. IL-6 was also found to enhance the long term non-specific cytotoxicity against an allogeneic nonrenal tumor target. No consistent effect on autologous tumor-specific cytotoxicity was demonstrated. We conclude that IL-6, when used in combination with IL-2, may modestly enhance the long-term growth of RCC-derived TIL.\r"

The use of the Candela miniscope in 11 patients permitted access without ureteral dilation. In 19 patients, ureteral stents were placed. One patient suffered a ureteral perforation. Success was defined as adequate disintegration of the stone for passage of the fragments without the necessity of a secondary procedure. Using this criterion, 22 of 26 patients were successfully treated for an overall success rate of 85%.\r"

Laser probe temperatures were measured in an in vitro blood circulation model consisting of 3.2 nm-diameter plastic tubes. A 2.0 mm-diameter metal probe attached to a 300 microns optical quartz fiber was coupled to an argon laser. Continuous wave 4 watts and 8 watts of laser power were delivered to the fiber tip corresponding to a 6.7 +/- 0.5 and 13.2 +/- 0.7 watts power setting at the laser generator. The laser probe was either moved with constant velocity or kept stationary. A thermocouple inserted in the lateral portion of the probe was used to record probe temperatures. Probe temperature changes were found with the variation of laser power, probe velocity, blood flow, and duration of laser exposure. Probe motion significantly reduced probe temperatures. After 10 seconds of 4 watts laser power the probe temperature in stagnant blood decreased from 303 +/- 18 degrees C to 113 +/- 17 degrees C (63%) by moving the probe with a velocity of 5 cm/sec. Blood flow rates of 170 ml/min further decreased the probe temperature from 113 +/- 17 degrees C to 50 +/- 8 degrees C (56%). At 8 watts of laser power a probe temperature reduction from 591 +/- 25 degrees C to 534 +/- 36 degrees C (10%) due to 5 cm/sec probe velocity was noted. Probe temperatures were reduced to 130 +/- 30 degrees C (78%) under the combined influence of 5 cm/sec probe velocity and 170 ml/min blood flow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We also compare four different modalities of endoscopic denervation: A xenon chloride excimer laser (308 nm, 35 mJ/pulse, 20 pulses/sec, 2.2 mm catheter tip), CO2 laser (14 W, CW, 2 mm spot size), Nd:YAG laser (88 W, CW, 3 mm spot size), and radiofrequency-generated thermocoagulation (3 W, CW, 2.1 mm catheter tip) by performing bilateral thoracic sympathectomy on 12 mongrel dogs (three dogs each). Criteria analyzed included duration of exposure, power density, total energy output, laser penetration and spread, gross morphology, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the destroyed neural tissue. Total ablation of the inferior segment of the stellate ganglion and the T1-T2 nerve roots by excimer laser required 83 +/1 1 Joules over an exposure period of 118 seconds. Ablation by CO2 and Nd:YAG laser required 153 +/- 13 Joules and 554 +/- 47 Joules delivered over 11 and 6 seconds respectively. In contrast, ablation of the same volume of nerve tissue by RF required 810 +/- 50 Joules over 270 seconds. SEM evaluation revealed that excimer and CO2 laser lesions were narrower in configuration compared to RF and Nd:YAG lesions which showed more lateral spread. The actual depth of penetration per 1 second exposure was similar for Excimer and CO2 (1.5 mm) and RF (1.3 mm), but deeper for Nd:YAG (3 mm).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The temporal interaction between the 500 microseconds laser pulse and saline at the fiber tip was investigated with time-resolved flash photography. The penetration depth in blood, and saline depended on the fiber output energy. In blood at 37 degrees C, the penetration depth varied from 1.2 to 2.1 mm for intensities of 3.1 to 12.4 J/mm2 per pulse, respectively, whereas its theoretical value for water is 0.33 mm, which is based on the measured absorption coefficient of 3.0 +/- 0.1/mm. The large penetration depth was due to the development of a transparent vapour cavity around the fiber tip. In saline, its maximum length was 4.7 mm. Its maximum width was 2.8 mm. The lifetime of the cavity was 450 microseconds. In blood, ablation of porcine aorta was feasible at a distance of 3 mm. Large fissures observed in adjacent tissue are likely to be caused by the expansion of the vapour cavity. We conclude that, due to a \"Moses effect in the microsecond region,\" Holmium:YSGG tissue ablation is possible through at least 2.7 mm of blood.\r"

  ".W": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising approach to the treatment of cancer. Preferential retention of the photosensitizer by malignant tissue has been considered a hallmark of this treatment modality. However, photosensitivity can be observed in normal, non-neoplastic tissues, and the present study investigated the effects of PDT treatment on the abdomen of intact rats. A circular region (1 cm diameter) on the shaved abdomen of Fischer rats, pretreated 24 h prior with Photofrin II, was irradiated for 30 min at 632 nm. Control animals received either photoradiation or Photofrin II administration. Subsequent lesions were observed in the irradiated skin, its associated abdominal wall, and the underlying gut in rats receiving Photofrin II and laser irradiation. All tissues were not equally sensitive to PDT treatment. Gut lesions were consistently more severe than were skin and abdominal wall injuries. By 24 hr after treatment, the gut manifested a transmural hemorrhagic necrosis, while the irradiated skin and abdominal wall were edematous, with an inflammatory infiltrate in the dermis and around occasional swollen myocytes. These results indicate that superficial lesions induced by PDT may not be reliable indicators of the extent of deeper PDT tissue damage. Further, it may be possible to take advantage of this discrepancy in tissue sensitivity and treat deep tissues through less sensitive superficial tissues.\r"

Two other variables were investigated: the power and time of exposure. Three histologic zones were observed: a superficial zone with black particle deposits (carbonization), an intermediate zone with fibrillations and enlarged empty lacunae, and a deep zone with normal appearing bone. The bony changes in the first two zones combined were superficial in all specimens and did not exceed 200 microns. Increased energy, a focused beam, and time of exposure were all associated with increased matrix changes. CO2 laser can be applied to cortical bone in vitro with minimal residual thermal damage.\r"

  ".W": "Argon-fluoride (ArF) excimer laser-induced acoustic injury was confirmed by ablating the stratum corneum (s.c.) inertially confined by water in vivo. Hairless rats were irradiated through a quartz chamber with flowing distilled water or air and a 2.5 mm aperture. The laser was adjusted to deliver 150 mJ/cm2 at the skin surface for both conditions. Partial and complete ablation of the s.c. was achieved with 12 and 24 pulses, respectively. Immediate damage was assessed by the transmission electron microscopy. Partial ablation of the s.c. through air produced no damage, whereas partial ablation through water damaged skin to a mean depth of 114.5 +/- 8.8 microns (+/- SD). Full thickness ablation of the s.c. through air and water produced damage zones measuring 192.2 +/- 16.2 and 293.0 +/- 71.6 microns, respectively (P less than 0.05). The increased depth of damage in the presence of inertial confinement provided by the layer of water strongly supports a photoacoustic mechanism of damage. The damage induced by partial ablation of the s.c. provides evidence that photochemical injury is not a significant factor in the damage at a depth because the retained s.c. acts as a partial barrier to diffusion of photochemical products. Combined with our previous studies, these experiments demonstrate that pressure transients are responsible for the deep damage seen with 193 nm ablation and that photoacoustic effects must be considered when using short-pulse, high-peak power lasers.\r"

Concentric beams of near-monochromatic x-ray photons may be generated by collision of the free electron laser (FEL) electron beam with the optical beam in an interaction zone that delivers the x-rays to a shirtsleeve environment. The absence of Compton scatter and the photoelectric interaction within tissues improves conspicuity of lesions by two to six times. Increased attenuation of x-rays in malignant vs. normal tissues makes tumors more obvious. K-edge subtraction allows chemical analysis of tumors in vivo--all at radiation doses that are one-tenth to one-fiftieth that delivered by the lowest-dose mammographic x-ray technique available. This allows for an increased sensitivity and specificity and permits prediction of histology, negating necessity for biopsies. Selective bond-breaking at depth in tissues as well as x-ray-activated photodynamic therapy are also being explored.\r"

All patients were considered candidates for hysterectomy. Both preoperatively and postoperatively, patients monitored their menstrual cycles and evaluated their flow according to predetermined categories of amenorrhea, light flow, normal flow, heavy flow, and severe flow. After treatment, 68% of patients with normal-sized uterus and 91% of patients with an enlarged uterus (greater than 10 cm) and 88% of patients with uterine fibroids became amenorrheic or had light flow. None of the patients in this last group have had to undergo hysterectomy. This study indicates that the patient with an enlarged or fibroid uterus may not have contraindications for endometrial ablation. Endometrial ablation may be effective in at least temporarily controlling bleeding in those patients with enlarged or myomatous uterus.\r"

  ".W": "Anabolic steroids have attained a prominent, albeit highly controversial, position among ergogenic aids for power athletes. Adverse effects of these compounds are well documented, but their popularity persists. One of their possible side effects which has received little attention is abnormal form and function of connective tissue in steroid-abusing athletes. Scientific and medical literature addressing this concern is scant and is generally limited to observed effects in animals. Anabolic steroid use paralleled with exercise may lead to dysplasia of collagen fibrils, which can decrease the tensile strength of tendon. Changes in tendon's crimp morphology have been shown to occur, as well, which may alter the rupturing strain of tendon and the normal biomechanics of the extremities. Given the megadoses of steroids taken by some athletes and the large forces incurred by power-trained musculature, the integrity of tendinous tissue in these athletes may be at significant risk of compromise if steroids do, in fact, exert a destructive effect. Additional investigation in the area reviewed here is warranted before anabolic steroids can be decisively implicated in human connective tissue disruption. It is recommended, however, that consideration be given to including potential tissue alterations among the side effects of steroid abuse.\r"

A two-way ANOVA with two repeated measures (load and angle) and a Newman-Keuls post hoc analysis were performed to compare the interaction of pre-load and angle at every 5 degrees in the ROM. The differences in average torque, peak torque, and peak torque angle between the pre-load levels were also analyzed with repeated-measures t-tests. The high pre-load condition had a significant increase in torque at 99, 95, 90, and 85 degrees concentrically and 31, 35, 40, 45, and 50 degrees eccentrically. In comparing the two pre-load conditions over the whole torque curve, there was a significant difference in average torque values of both CON and ECC, no significant difference in peak torque in either contraction, and a significant shift in peak torque angle with CON contractions only.\r"

This hypothesis was tested for knee extensor strength curves by comparing theoretically determined strength curves based on the force-length relations of the individual muscles with those obtained experimentally. The agreement between theoretical and experimental curves was good, suggesting that the initial hypothesis was correct. Accepting this result, it is possible to determine the contribution of individual muscles to the total force of the synergistic group. This information, in turn, may be utilized for practical applications in sports or for evaluating strength curves of patients with injuries or diseases of the musculoskeletal system.\r"

Analysis of variance indicated a significant effect of the type of sports activity on HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein A-I, and triglyceride levels and on the LDL/HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B/A-I ratios, with the most favorable values seen in runners and the least favorable values seen in controls. Of the 27 former elite runners, one third (N = 9) had given up or strongly reduced training. This subgroup showed the steepest 15-yr decrease (from 1973 to 1988) in maximum aerobic power and the largest 15-yr increase in subcutaneous fat, and the lipid profile (measured in 1988) corresponded more to the one of bobsledders and controls than to the one of runners who had remained active. Separate correlational analyses of all runners (N = 27) and nonrunners (N = 32) showed that, in both cohorts, i) the 1988 measurements of exercise, aerobic power, and subcutaneous fat were more predictive for the lipid profile in 1988 than the corresponding 1973 values, ii) anthropometric characteristics, especially abdominal fat, had a stronger relation with serum lipid concentrations than exercise and aerobic power, and iii) 15-yr changes in anthropometric characteristics were, but 15-yr changes in exercise and aerobic power were not, associated with triglyceride, lipoprotein, and apolipoprotein levels in 1988.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The pretest and posttest consisted of 27 shots, with EEG data collected for the left and right temporal hemispheres (T3, T4). Feedback subjects were then given EEG biofeedback, while control subjects rested for 30 min. Analyses indicated that only the performance measure was significant. The correct feedback group significantly improved performance, while the incorrect feedback group showed a significant performance decrement from pre- to posttest (Ps less than 0.05). The control group showed no significant pre-post differences in performance. EEG analyses showed differences that were consistent with the training given to the incorrect, but not the correct, feedback group. Overall, the results provide some support for the use of known relationships between EEG and performance as an effective means of providing biofeedback to affect the performance of pre-elite archers.\r"

This was done to help explain the proximal-to-distal sequential pattern of segment motions typically observed in these activities and to evaluate general biomechanical principles used to explain this motion pattern. High speed film data were collected for four subjects performing each skill. Equations were derived which expressed the interaction between segments in terms of resultant joint moments at the hip and knee and several interactive moments which were functions of gravitational forces or kinematic variables. The angular motion-dependent interaction between the thigh and leg was found to play a significant role in determining the sequential segment motion patterns observed in all three activities. The general nature of this interaction was consistent across all three movements except during phases in which there were large differences in the knee angle. Support was found for the principle of summation of segment speeds, whereas no support was found for the principle of summation of force or for general statements concerning the effect of negative thigh acceleration on positive leg acceleration. The roles played by resultant joint moments in producing the observed segment motion sequences are discussed.\r"

When blood and muscle lactate concentrations after the SR were expressed relative to values before the SR, the WU trial resulted in a lower accumulation of blood lactate (6.5 +/- 0.9 vs 10.7 +/- 0.8 mEq.l-1; P less than 0.01) and muscle lactate (20.1 +/- 0.1 vs 23.4 +/- 2.2 mEq.kg-1 wet wt.; P less than 0.05). Furthermore, oxygen consumption during the 1st min of the SR was higher in the WU trial (2.3 +/- 0.2 vs 1.9 +/- 0.2 l.min-1; P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of the study was to assess the isokinetic and isometric strength and power profile of the knees of 48 patients who had a previous second-degree sprain (partial tear) of the medial ligament compartment, the most common knee ligament injury in sports. The CYBEX II isokinetic dynamometer was used in the measurements. On an average of 8 yr after the injury, the mean strength deficit of the injured knees was minimal: 4 +/- 5% (range 0-28%) in extension and 2 +/- 4% (0-20%) in flexion. The average strength score (max. 100 points) was 90 +/- 11 (56-100), representing an excellent classification. In hamstrings, the relative strength deficit increased significantly with a higher speed of isokinetic movement (P less than 0.05). Compared with the strength parameters (peak torques), the other functional parameters of the injured knees (total work, average power, and peak torque acceleration energy) showed some but not significantly greater deficits (hamstrings 9-11%, quadriceps 6-8%). In conclusion, the general thigh muscle function in knees with old second-degree sprain of the medial ligament compartment appears good and acceptable, but the strength deficits are systematically greater in higher speeds of isokinetic movement. Therefore, rehabilitation utilizing high speed extension and flexion exercises is recommended.\r"

Overload of the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle (129 ReJ strain male mouse) was induced by unilateral surgical removal of a synergistic muscle, tibialis anterior (TA). Response of the EDL to overload for 7, 21, and 42 d was analyzed for changes in 1) muscle weight, 2) myofiber type distribution, 3) myofiber cross-sectional area by fiber type, 4) speed of contraction and relaxation of the muscle, 5) force of contraction, and 6) myofiber morphologic integrity. The weight of the EDL significantly increased. The overload caused no impairment of muscle contractility and did not have a significant effect on isometric twitch contraction time to peak tension or the time to one-half relaxation of the twitch. Overloaded muscles demonstrated a transient shift in fiber type profile with preferential hypertrophy of Type IIA fibers that occurred in the early phase of overload while type IIB fibers were recruited by 42 d. No significant increase in myofiber number in overloaded muscles occurred. Some morphologic changes in over-loaded muscles parallel those found in patients with neurogenic muscular disorders. However, overloaded muscle did not exhibit a significant occurrence of fiber branching from controls in the midbelly region of the muscle.\r"

  ".W": "It has been postulated that the staircase response of skeletal muscle is effected by Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of myosin light chains. Dantrolene inhibits calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, so treatment with dantrolene should prolong the time required to reach the peak of the staircase response. Furthermore, since it has been postulated that Ca2+ release is attenuated by fatigue, there should be similarities between the staircase of fatigued muscle and staircase in the presence of dantrolene. The left gastrocnemius muscle of anesthetized rats was isolated in situ and connected to an isometric transducer. In the control condition, developed tension increased for approximately 10 s with repetitive stimulation at 10 Hz. The time to reach the peak of staircase was prolonged after a 5 min period of stimulation at 10 Hz or after injection of dantrolene sodium (0.8 mg.kg-1 IV). Other similarities between the dantrolene treated group and the fatigue group include the following: contraction time was shorter in fatigue (12.8 +/- 0.8 ms) and with dantrolene (14.7 +/- 1.3 ms) than in the controls (16.4 +/- 1 ms), and half-relaxation time increased from 5 s (10.8 +/- 9 ms) to 15 s (13.8 +/- 0.8 ms) of staircase in the control but did not increase at this time in the dantrolene or fatigue groups. This study demonstrates that both fatigue and a reduction in Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum will prolong the time required to reach the peak of staircase.\r"

The study was conducted using a two (exercise (EX) and nonexercise (NEX) groups) by three (baseline, 6 wk, and 15 wk testing sessions) factorial design, with data analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA. The pattern of change over time between groups for number of peripheral blood lymphocytes (total), T cells (CD5), B cells (CD20), and serum IgG, IgA, and IgM levels was significantly different. This was not the case for spontaneous blastogenesis or number of T helper/inducer cells (CD4) or T cytotoxic/suppressor cells (CD8). Within-EX-group changes were characterized by significant decreases in percentage and number of total lymphocytes, and in T cell number after 6 wk, and significant increases in each of the serum immunoglobulins after both 6 and 15 wk of training. B cell number increased significantly in NEX subjects relative to baseline values at both 6 and 15 wk, with no significant changes experienced in EX subjects. In summary, these data suggest that moderate ET is not associated with an improvement in lymphocyte function but is associated with a 20% increase in serum immunoglobulins and several small changes in circulating numbers of immune system variables, highlighted by significant decreases in circulating numbers of lymphocytes, particularly the T cell subpopulation. These changes were especially apparent after 6 wk of training, with some attenuation by 15 wk.\r"

Since we had previously found that hypoxia during exercise produced different ventilatory responses in children (C) compared to adults (A), we hypothesized that VO2 and heart rate kinetics during exercise would show similar maturational responses to hypoxia. To test this hypothesis, we examined the responses during progressive (ramp) and constant work rate tests in children and adults breathing either room air or hypoxic gas (FiO2 = 0.15). When corrected for body weight, children and adults had similar values for lactic acidosis threshold (LAT) (C: 29.1 +/- 5.0 ml.min-1.kg-1; A: 27.9 +/- 4.3) and VO2max (C: 40.7 +/- 8.6 ml.min-1.kg-1; A: 45.2 +/- 6.7) during normoxia. Hypoxia significantly lowered LAT (C: 27.5 +/- 5.4 ml.min-1.kg-1; A: 23.2 +/- 3.8; both P less than 0.05) and VO2max (C: 37.7 +/- 8.3 ml.min-1.kg-1; A: 40.1 +/- 5.3; both P less than 0.05) in both children and adults. Metabolic efficiency (delta VO2/delta work rate) and the VO2-heart rate relationship (delta VO2/delta HR/kg) were similar in the two groups and unaffected by hypoxia. During the constant work rate exercise, VO2 kinetics (time constant during phase 2 of the response (pi 1) and the O2 deficit) were similar between children and adults and were significantly slowed by hypoxia, consistent with current understanding of the control of oxidative metabolism. Finally, heart rate was increased at rest and during exercise with hypoxia, while the time to reach 75% of the end-exercise response was delayed significantly, in both groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Runners (N = 20) and nonrunners (N = 29) completed a progressive horizontal treadmill (TM) running test which allowed identification of the TM velocities associated with the LT and FBLC. Runners attained significantly higher TM velocities, greater VO2, greater VE, greater heart rate, and a lower ventilatory equivalent for oxygen (VE/VO2) at each exercise intensity, with the exceptions of heart rate at 4.0 mM and VE/VO2 at the LT. Compared to nonrunners, runners also attained higher VO2, VE, and heart rate relative to peak values at LT and 2.0, 2.5, and 4.0 mM. Despite these relative and absolute physiological differences, there were no differences between groups in local, central, or overall ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) (Borg scale) at any condition. The data from both groups were combined to give the following means and SD for overall RPE during horizontal running: at the LT-11.0 +/- 2.0, and at FBLC of 2.0 mM-13.7 +/- 2.1, 2.5 mM-14.5 +/- 1.8, and 4.0 mM-16.5 +/- 2.3.\r"

Heart rate, VO2, and RPE were determined at power outputs corresponding to LT and fixed blood lactate concentrations (FBLC) of 2.0, 2.5, and 4.0 mM and during maximal exercise. A repeated measures ANOVA indicated that, despite significant differences across exercise modality in HR and VO2 at LT, FBLC, and maximal exercise, no significant differences in RPE were found between exercise modalities during leg exercise. Mean (+/- SD) respective values for overall RPE at LT and FBLC of 2.0 mM, 2.5 mM, 4.0 mM, and max were 10.2 (2.2), 13.1 (2.1), 14.1 (2.3), 15.9 (2.3), and 18.8 (1.3) for the CE and 10.8 (1.9), 13.8 (1.8), 14.6 (1.6), 16.2 (2.6), and 18.5 (1.5) for the TM.

Actual road racing 40 km time-trial performance was highly correlated with average absolute power during the 1 h laboratory performance test (r = -0.88; P less than 0.001). In turn, 1 h power output was related to each cyclists' VO2 at the blood lactate threshold (r = 0.93; P less than 0.001). Group 1 was not different from group 2 regarding VO2max (approximately 70 ml.kg-1.min-1 and 5.01 l.min-1) or lean body weight. However, group 1 bicycled 40 km on the road 10% faster than group 2 (P less than 0.05; 54 vs 60 min). Additionally, group 1 was able to generate 11% more power during the 1 h performance test than group 2 (P less than 0.05), and they averaged 90 +/- 1% VO2max compared with 86 +/- 2% VO2max in group 2 (P = 0.06). The higher performance power output of group 1 was produced primarily by generating higher peak torques about the center of the crank by applying larger vertical forces to the crank arm during the cycling downstroke. Compared with group 2, group 1 also produced higher peak torques and vertical forces during the downstroke even when cycling at the same absolute work rate as group 2. Factors possibly contributing to the ability of group 1 to produce higher \"downstroke power\" are a greater percentage of Type I muscle fibers (P less than 0.05) and a 23% greater (P less than 0.05) muscle capillary density compared with group 2. We have also observed a strong relationship between years of endurance training and percent Type I muscle fibers (r = 0.75; P less than 0.001). It appears that \"elite-national class\" cyclists have the ability to generate higher \"downstroke power\", possibly as a result of muscular adaptations stimulated by more years of endurance training.\r"

In a previous study, combined radiation and chemotherapy improved survival significantly as compared with surgery alone, but not as compared with adjuvant radiation, which many regard as standard therapy. We designed a combination regimen to optimize the contribution of chemotherapy, decrease recurrence, and improve survival as compared with adjuvant radiation alone. METHODS. Two hundred four patients with rectal carcinoma that was either deeply invasive or metastatic to regional lymph nodes were randomly assigned to postoperative radiation alone (4500 to 5040 cGy) or to radiation plus fluorouracil, which was both preceded and followed by a cycle of systemic therapy with fluorouracil plus semustine (methyl-CCNU). RESULTS. After a median follow-up of more than seven years, the combined therapy had reduced the recurrence of rectal cancer by 34 percent (P = 0.0016; 95 percent confidence interval, 12 to 50 percent). Initial local recurrence was reduced by 46 percent (P = 0.036; 95 percent confidence interval, 2 to 70 percent), and distant metastasis by 37 percent (P = 0.011; 95 percent confidence interval, 9 to 57 percent). In addition, combined therapy reduced the rate of cancer-related deaths by 36 percent (P = 0.0071; 95 percent confidence interval, 14 to 53 percent) and the overall death rate by 29 percent (P = 0.025; 95 percent confidence interval, 7 to 45 percent). Its acute toxic effects included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. These effects were seldom severe. Severe, delayed treatment-related reactions, usually small-bowel obstruction requiring surgery, occurred in 6.7 percent of all patients receiving radiation, and the frequencies of these complications were comparable in both treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS. The combination of postoperative local therapy with radiation plus fluorouracil and systemic therapy with a fluorouracil-based regimen significantly and substantively improves the results of therapy for rectal carcinoma with a poor prognosis, as compared with postoperative radiation alone.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The highest morbidity worldwide from fish poisoning results from the ingestion of spoiled scombroid fish, such as tuna and mackerel, and its cause is not clear. Histamine could be responsible, because spoiled scombroid fish contain large quantities of histamine. Whether histamine is the causative toxin, however, has remained in question. To address this issue, we investigated whether histamine homeostasis is altered in poisoned people. METHODS. The urinary excretion of histamine and its metabolite, N-methylhistamine, was measured in three persons who had scombroid-fish poisoning (scombrotoxism) after the ingestion of marlin. We measured 9 alpha, 11 beta-dihydroxy-15-oxo-2,3,18,19-tetranorprost-5-ene-1,20-dioic acid (PGD-M), the principal metabolite of prostaglandin D2, a mast-cell secretory product, to assess whether mast cells had been activated to release histamine. RESULTS. The fish contained high levels of histamine (842 to 2503 mumol per 100 g of tissue). Symptoms of scombrotoxism--flushing and headache--began 10 to 30 minutes after the ingestion of fish. In urine samples collected one to four hours after fish ingestion, the levels of histamine and N-methylhistamine were 9 to 20 times and 15 to 20 times the normal mean, respectively. During the subsequent 24 hours, the levels fell to 4 to 15 times and 4 to 11 times the normal values. Levels of both were normal 14 days later. PGD-M excretion was not increased at any time. Two persons treated with diphenhydramine had prompt amelioration of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS. Scombroid-fish poisoning is associated with urinary excretion of histamine in quantities far exceeding those required to produce toxicity. The histamine is most likely derived from the spoiled fish. These results identify histamine as the toxin responsible for scombroid-fish poisoning.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Persons with chronic alcoholism frequently have hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and osteoporosis. The short-term effects of alcohol ingestion on calcium and magnesium metabolism are poorly understood, however. METHODS. We measured serum calcium, magnesium, and phosphate concentrations in 17 normal men and 7 normal women before and at intervals up to 16 hours after the ingestion of 1.2 to 1.5 g of alcohol per kilogram of body weight over a 3-hour period (doses sufficient to cause acute intoxication). Urinary excretion of calcium, magnesium, and phosphate and serum calciotropic hormone levels were measured in 16 of these subjects. As a control, the same measurements were made after the ingestion of fruit juice instead of alcohol. RESULTS. The mean (+/- SE) peak blood alcohol level in the men was 37.5 +/- 1.6 mmol per liter, and in the women it was 38.0 +/- 3.2 mmol per liter. In the men the mean serum parathyroid hormone concentration decreased from 16.1 +/- 2.1 to 6.8 +/- 0.9 ng per liter at the end of the three-hour drinking period. The value at this time was 30 percent of that at the end of the three-hour session during which the men drank fruit juice (P = 0.004). The serum concentration of ionized calcium reached a nadir eight hours after the beginning of alcohol administration (decreasing from 1.18 +/- 0.01 to 1.15 +/- 0.01 mmol per liter; P less than 0.001 as compared with values during the fruit-juice study), and urinary excretion of calcium increased from 0.34 +/- 0.08 to 0.36 +/- 0.08 mmol per hour (P less than 0.01 as compared with values during the fruit-juice study). Serum parathyroid hormone levels exceeded base-line values during the last 4 hours of the 16-hour study period; this increase was accompanied by a decrease in the urinary excretion of calcium. Both serum levels of magnesium (in the first 6 hours) and urinary levels (in the first 12 hours) increased after the ingestion of alcohol. In the women, serum parathyroid hormone levels decreased from 29.2 +/- 2.8 to 17.3 +/- 2.6 ng per liter two hours after the administration of alcohol was begun (P less than 0.001) and increased above base-line values during the last four hours of the study period. The serum concentration of ionized calcium decreased from 1.20 +/- 0.01 to 1.16 +/- 0.01 mmol per liter, reaching a nadir 8 to 12 hours after alcohol administration was begun (P less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. Short-term alcohol administration causes transitory hypoparathyroidism. This decline in the secretion of parathyroid hormone accounts at least in part for the transient hypocalcemia, hypercalciuria, and hypermagnesuria that follow alcohol ingestion.\r"

Previous investigators of this issue have reported inconsistent findings. METHODS. To determine whether electromagnetic fields emitted by VDTs are associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion, a cohort of female telephone operators who used VDTs at work was compared with a cohort of operators who did not use VDTs. To obtain reliable estimates of exposure, we determined the number of hours of VDT use per week from company records and measured electromagnetic fields at VDT workstations and, for purposes of comparison, at workstations without VDTs. Operators who used VDTs had higher abdominal exposure to very-low-frequency (15 kHz) electromagnetic fields (workstations without VDTs did not emit very-low-frequency energy). Abdominal exposure to extremely-low-frequency fields (45 to 60 Hz) was similar for both operators who used VDTs and those who did not. Among 2430 women interviewed, there were 882 pregnancies that met our criteria for inclusion in the study. RESULTS. We found no excess risk of spontaneous abortion among women who used VDTs during the first trimester of pregnancy (odds ratio = 0.93; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.63 to 1.38), and no dose-response relation was apparent when we examined the women's hours of VDT use per week (odds ratio for 1 to 25 hours per week = 1.04; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.61 to 1.79; odds ratio for greater than 25 hours per week = 1.00; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.61 to 1.64). There continued to be no risk associated with the use of VDTs when we accounted for multiple pregnancies, conducted separate analyses of early abortion, late abortion, and all fetal losses, or limited our analyses to spontaneous abortions for which a physician was consulted. CONCLUSIONS. The use of VDTs and exposure to the accompanying electromagnetic fields were not associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion in this study.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Insulin resistance and the concomitant compensatory hyperinsulinemia have been implicated in the pathogenesis of hypertension. However, reports on the relation between insulin and blood pressure are inconsistent. This study was designed to investigate the possibility of racial differences in this relation. METHODS. We studied 116 Pima Indians, 53 whites, and 42 blacks who were normotensive and did not have diabetes; the groups were comparable with respect to mean age (29, 30, and 31 years, respectively) and blood pressure (113/70, 111/68, and 113/68 mm Hg, respectively). Insulin resistance was determined by the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp technique during low-dose (40 mU per square meter of body-surface area per minute) and high-dose (400 mU per square meter per minute) insulin infusions. RESULTS. The Pima Indians had higher fasting plasma insulin concentrations than the whites or blacks (176, 138, and 122 pmol per liter, respectively; P = 0.002) and lower rates of whole-body glucose disposal during both the low-dose (12.7, 17.1, and 19.5 mmol per minute; P less than 0.001) and the high-dose (38.0, 43.1, and 45.7 mmol per minute; P less than 0.001) insulin infusions. After adjustment for age, sex, body weight, and percentage of body fat, mean blood pressure (calculated as 1/3 systolic pressure + 2/3 diastolic pressure) was significantly correlated with the fasting plasma insulin concentration (r = 0.42) and the rate of glucose disposal during the low-dose (r = -0.41) and high-dose (r = -0.49) insulin infusions (P less than 0.01 for each) in whites, but not in Pima Indians (r = -0.06, -0.02, and -0.04, respectively) or blacks (r = -0.10, -0.04, and 0.02, respectively). CONCLUSIONS. The relations between insulinemia, insulin resistance, and blood pressure differ among racial groups and may be mediated by mechanisms active in whites, but not in Pima Indians or blacks.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Many believe that the prospect of weight gain discourages smokers from quitting. Accurate estimates of the weight gain related to the cessation of smoking in the general population are not available, however. METHODS. We related changes in body weight to changes in smoking status in adults 25 to 74 years of age who were weighed in the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I, 1971 to 1975) and then weighed a second time in the NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (1982 to 1984). The cohort included continuing smokers (748 men and 1137 women) and those who had quit smoking for a year or more (409 men and 359 women). RESULTS. The mean weight gain attributable to the cessation of smoking, as adjusted for age, race, level of education, alcohol use, illnesses related to change in weight, base-line weight, and physical activity, was 2.8 kg in men and 3.8 kg in women. Major weight gain (greater than 13 kg) occurred in 9.8 percent of the men and 13.4 percent of the women who quit smoking. The relative risk of major weight gain in those who quit smoking (as compared with those who continued to smoke) was 8.1 (95 percent confidence interval, 4.4 to 14.9) in men and 5.8 (95 percent confidence interval, 3.7 to 9.1) in women, and it remained high regardless of the duration of cessation. For both sexes, blacks, people under the age of 55, and people who smoked 15 cigarettes or more per day were at higher risk of major weight gain after quitting smoking. Although at base line the smokers weighed less than those who had never smoked, they weighed nearly the same at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS. Major weight gain is strongly related to smoking cessation, but it occurs in only a minority of those who stop smoking. Weight gain is not likely to negate the health benefits of smoking cessation, but its cosmetic effects may interfere with attempts to quit. Effective methods of weight control are therefore needed for smokers trying to quit.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Relapse after the treatment of acute asthma in the emergency room is common (occurring in 25 to 30 percent of cases) and is not accurately predicted by any available measurements. We studied the usefulness of prednisone in reducing this high rate of relapse. METHODS. One hundred twenty-two patients treated in the emergency room for acute exacerbations of asthma were assigned in a randomized, double-blind fashion to receive at discharge either prednisone for eight days (the dose being tapered from 40 to 0 mg per day) or matching placebo. Ninety-three were subsequently discharged from the emergency room and participated in the trial. On days 1, 7, and 14 after discharge, the patients were assessed during home visits with spirometry and diary-card review; they were contacted by telephone on day 21. Relapse was defined as an unscheduled medical visit occasioned by the patient's perceived need for further asthma treatment. RESULTS. The overall risk of relapse was significantly lower in the prednisone group (P less than 0.05), with a significantly reduced rate of relapse during the first 10 days of follow-up (3 of 48, as compared with 11 of 45 in the placebo group; P less than 0.05). Thereafter (days 11 through 21), there was no further significant difference in relapse rates between treatment groups (five in the prednisone group and six in the placebo group). During the first week after discharge, patients receiving prednisone reported significantly lower mean (+/- SD) daily symptom scores for shortness of breath (1.4 +/- 0.4 vs. 2.5 +/- 0.4, P less than 0.01) and less frequent use of an inhaled bronchodilator (5.2 +/- 0.5 vs. 6.9 +/- 0.2 puffs per day, P less than 0.05) than patients receiving placebo. Subsequently, symptom scores and bronchodilator use were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS. A short course of prednisone reduced early relapse rates after the treatment of acute asthma in the emergency room, an effect limited to the period of steroid administration.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Echocardiography is recognized as the method of choice for the noninvasive detection of valvular vegetations in patients with infective endocarditis, with transesophageal echocardiography being more accurate than transthoracic echocardiography. The diagnosis of associated abscesses by transthoracic echocardiography is difficult or even impossible in many cases, however, and it is not known whether transesophageal echocardiography is any better. METHODS. To determine the value of transesophageal echocardiography in the detection of abscesses associated with endocarditis, we studied prospectively by two-dimensional transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography 118 consecutive patients with infective endocarditis of 137 native or prosthetic valves that was documented during surgery or at autopsy. RESULTS. During surgery or at autopsy, 44 patients (37.3 percent) had a total of 46 definite regions of abscess. Abscesses were more frequent in aortic-valve endocarditis than in infections of other valves, and the infecting organism was more often staphylococcus (52.3 percent of cases) in patients with abscesses than in those without abscesses (16.2 percent). The hospital mortality rate was 22.7 percent in patients with abscesses, as compared with 13.5 percent in patients without abscesses. Whereas transthoracic echocardiography identified only 13 of the 46 areas of abscess, the transesophageal approach allowed the detection of 40 regions (P less than 0.001). Sensitivity and specificity for the detection of abscesses associated with endocarditis were 28.3 and 98.6 percent, respectively, for transthoracic echocardiography and 87.0 and 94.6 percent for transesophageal echocardiography; positive and negative predictive values were 92.9 and 68.9 percent, respectively, for the transthoracic approach and 90.9 and 92.1 percent for the transesophageal approach. Variation between observers was 3.4 percent for transthoracic and 4.2 percent for transesophageal echocardiography. CONCLUSIONS. The data indicate that transesophageal echocardiography leads to a significant improvement in the diagnosis of abscesses associated with endocarditis. The technique facilitates the identification of patients with endocarditis who have an increased risk of death and permits earlier treatment.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Leukemic cells in 15 to 25 percent of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) express myeloid antigens as well as lymphoid antigens (the latter reflecting B-cell or T-cell lineage). The relations of myeloid-antigen expression to other features of ALL and to prognosis have been controversial. METHODS. We analyzed clinical and laboratory features present at diagnosis in 236 consecutive cases of ALL in children. Immunophenotyping, including single- and dual-fluorescence analyses, was used to classify leukemic cells as B or T lymphoblasts and also to identify myeloid-antigen expression--the simultaneous expression of lymphoid-associated antigens and at least one of three myeloid-associated antigens (CD33, CD13, and CD14) on cells classified as L1 or L2 according to the French-American-British system. RESULTS. Forty-five of 185 patients with B-lineage ALL had myeloid-antigen expression, as did 8 of 41 patients with T-lineage ALL. In 10 patients, the lineage could not be determined. Myeloid-antigen expression was associated with L2 morphology (P less than 0.05), but it did not correlate with other prognostic features recognized previously. Multivariate analysis showed that myeloid-antigen expression was an important predictor of relapse in childhood ALL and the most significant prognostic factor statistically (P less than 0.0001). A white-cell count greater than or equal to 50 x 10(9) per liter at diagnosis was also an important and highly significant prognostic feature (P less than 0.001). After 40 months, the estimated disease-free survival for patients with ALL was 84 percent for those without myeloid-antigen expression and with a low white-cell count, 57 percent for those without myeloid-antigen expression and with a high white-cell count, 47 percent for those with myeloid-antigen expression and a low white-cell count, and 26 percent for those with myeloid-antigen expression and a high white-cell count (P less than 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS. Myeloid-antigen expression is an important independent predictor of a poor response to chemotherapy in childhood ALL.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Cardiotoxicity is a recognized complication of doxorubicin therapy, but the long-term effects of doxorubicin are not well documented. We therefore assessed the cardiac status of 115 children who had been treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia with doxorubicin 1 to 15 years earlier in whom the disease was in continuous remission. METHODS. Eighteen patients received one dose of doxorubicin (45 mg per square meter of body-surface area), and 97 received multiple doses totaling 228 to 550 mg per square meter (median, 360). The median interval between the end of treatment and the cardiac evaluation was 6.4 years. Our evaluation consisted of a history, 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic recording, exercise testing, and echocardiography. RESULTS. Fifty-seven percent of the patients had abnormalities of left ventricular afterload (measured as end-systolic wall stress) or contractility (measured as the stress-velocity index). The cumulative dose of doxorubicin was the most significant predictor of abnormal cardiac function (P less than 0.002). Seventeen percent of patients who received one dose of doxorubicin had slightly elevated age-adjusted afterload, and none had decreased contractility. In contrast, 65 percent of patients who received at least 228 mg of doxorubicin per square meter had increased afterload (59 percent of patients), decreased contractility (23 percent), or both. Increased afterload was due to reduced ventricular wall thickness, not to hypertension or ventricular dilatation. In multivariate analyses restricted to patients who received at least 228 mg of doxorubicin per square meter, the only significant predictive factors were a higher cumulative dose (P = 0.01), which predicted decreased contractility, and an age of less than four years at treatment (P = 0.003), which predicted increased afterload. Afterload increased progressively in 24 of 34 patients evaluated serially (71 percent). Reported symptoms correlated poorly with indexes of exercise tolerance or ventricular function. Eleven patients had congestive heart failure within one year of treatment with doxorubicin; five of them had recurrent heart failure 3.7 to 10.3 years after completing doxorubicin treatment, and two required heart transplantation. No patient had late heart failure as a new event. CONCLUSIONS. Doxorubicin therapy in childhood impairs myocardial growth in a dose-related fashion and results in a progressive increase in left ventricular afterload sometimes accompanied by reduced contractility. We hypothesize that the loss of myocytes during doxorubicin therapy in childhood might result in inadequate left ventricular mass and clinically important heart disease in later years.\r"

MRI was used alone in 27 (68%) of the 40 patients; the remainder also had computed tomography in conjunction with myelography. The primary criterion on MRI for a clinically significant lesion was asymmetrical narrowing of the subarachnoid space in the region of the nerve root. Surgical confirmation of the abnormality was obtained in all 40 cases. The operative findings were a herniated nucleus pulposus (32 of 40 patients), spondylosis (2 of 40 patients), or a combination of the two (6 of 40 patients). MRI identified a surgical lesion (herniated nucleus pulposus, spondylosis, or both) in 37 of the 40 (92%) patients. We think MRI is the only preoperative imaging examination necessary in most cases of cervical radiculopathy.\r"

Post-myelography computed tomographic scans of 68 ATHDs were analyzed. Their imaging characteristics were compared with our own series of 5 symptomatic thoracic herniated discs and symptomatic thoracic herniated discs in the literature. We were unable to identify any imaging features that could reliably classify a disc as an ATHD or a symptomatic thoracic herniated disc. Our results call into question the propriety of prophylactic surgery for ATHDs, even when the lesions are radiographically impressive.\r"

  ".W": "Spinal cord stimulation has been reported to relieve ischemic pain and to enhance peripheral circulation. To elucidate the still unknown mechanisms behind these effects, changes in the peripheral blood flow in the skin of the hind paw after stimulation applied to the dorsal column was studied in the normal rat. A substantial flow increase, monitored by laser Doppler technique, was observed in response to stimulation with an intensity comparable to that used clinically in man, recruiting only low-threshold neuronal elements. The response remained after transection of the dorsal roots, as well as after spinal cord section rostrally to the stimulating electrode. Furthermore, monitoring of antidromic compound action potentials in a peripheral nerve indicated that the stimulus intensity applied to dorsal columns recruited solely low-threshold, large-diameter fibers. Stimulation failed to produce an increase in blood flow in addition to that produced by guanethidine and hexamethonium, but high-intensity dorsal column or dorsal root stimulation still was effective. The results indicate that spinal mechanisms are essential and that antidromic activation of primary afferent fibers is unlikely to account for the peripheral vasodilatation induced by low-intensity spinal cord stimulation. Our observations suggest a transitory inhibition of sympathetic vasoconstriction as the principal underlying mechanism.\r"

Intracranial pressure was analyzed using the percentage of time that it exceeded 20 mm Hg and the maximum value recorded during the first 72 hours after injury. Memory measures included recall of word lists, prose recall, and visual memory for designs that were obtained 6 months (n = 149) and 1 year (n = 132) after injury. Intracranial hypertension occurred in more than half of the Traumatic Coma Data Bank cohort who met the criteria for the neurobehavioral follow-up study. Linear regression analysis disclosed an effect of elevated intracranial pressure on some, but not all, measures of memory at 6 months, whereas the results were negative for the 1-year follow-up examination. We conclude that the elevation of intracranial pressure exerts little if any effect on later memory functioning, and that any effect it does have diminishes over 1 year in survivors of severe head injury.\r"

  ".W": "A controlled randomized study was carried out to evaluate the effects of chemotherapy in patients with brain metastases from lung carcinoma. One hundred patients were randomly divided into three groups at the time of diagnosis or after surgery for metastases. Group A received radiotherapy alone; Group B received radiotherapy and chloroethylnitrosoureas (methyl-CCNU, 100-120 mg/m2, or ACNU 80-100 mg/m2, every 6-8 weeks), and Group C received radiotherapy and a combination of chloroethylnitrosoureas and tegafur (300 mg/m2, daily). Of the 100 patients, 88 could be evaluated. The reduction rates of the tumors of the patients in whom tumor was not surgically removed or not totally removed were compared. Complete resolution of the tumor was noted in 29, 69, and 63% of the patients in Groups A, B, and C, respectively. Tumor regression of greater than or equal to 50% was seen in 36, 69, and 74% of the patients in Groups A, B, and C, respectively. The difference in the response rates of Groups A and C was statistically significant (P less than 0.05). Median survival after the start of treatment for brain metastasis was 27, 30.5, and 29 weeks in Groups A, B and C, respectively. There was 1 long-term survivor (more than 5 years) in Group A, 3 in Group B, and 1 in Group C. The main cause of death was deterioration attributable to the primary lesion or systemic metastasis, and no statistical difference was noted in survival time among the groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Between June 1987 and June 1989, 29 recurrent malignant gliomas or recurrent solitary brain metastases in 28 patients were treated in a Phase I study of interstitial irradiation and hyperthermia. Patient age ranged from 18 to 65 years, and the Karnofsky Performance Status scores ranged from 40 to 90%. There were 13 glioblastomas, 10 anaplastic astrocytomas, 3 melanomas, and 3 adenocarcinomas. Catheters were implanted stereotactically after computed tomography-based preplanning. Hyperthermia was administered before and after brachytherapy, using one to six 2450- or 915-MHz helical coil microwave antennas and one to three multisensor fiberoptic thermometry probes. The goal was to heat as much of the tumor as possible to 42.5 degrees C for 30 minutes. Within 30 minutes after the first hyperthermia treatment, implant catheters were afterloaded with high-activity iodine-125 seeds delivering tumor doses of 32.6 to 61.0 Gy. Most patients had no sensation of heating. Complications included seizures in 5 patients, reversible neurological changes in 9 patients, a scalp burn in 1, and infections in 3. Of 28 evaluable 2-month follow-up scans, 11 showed definite improvement in the radiological appearance of the tumor, 4 were slightly improved, 7 were stable, and 6 showed tumor progression. Ten patients underwent reoperation for persistent tumor and/or necrosis. Eleven of 28 patients are alive 40 to 97 weeks after treatment. Thirteen patients died of a brain tumor, 2 died of extracranial melanoma metastases, 1 died of new brain melanoma metastases, and 1 died of a pulmonary embolus. The median survival was 55 weeks overall. Median survival has not yet been reached for the anaplastic astrocytoma subgroup. We conclude that interstitial brain hyperthermia using helical coil microwave antennas is technically feasible. The level of toxicity is acceptable, and the computed tomographic response rate is encouraging.\r"

  ".W": "To improve the localization of stereotactic targets, somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were recorded from the thalamus and subthalamic area using a specially designed semimicroelectrode in 61 patients and a conventional \"macroelectrode\" in 17 patients. By means of the semimicroelectrode, median nerve stimulation evoked two distinct SEPs, consisting of a diphasic wave with a huge positivity restricted to the nucleus ventrocaudalis (Vc) and a triphasic wave of lower amplitude with a major negativity in the ventral part of the nucleus ventrointermedius (Vim) and nucleus ventrooralis posterior (Vop) as well as the subthalamic lemniscal pathway. The Vim-Vc junction could thus be clearly delineated by an abrupt transition of SEPs from one type to the other with a precision of 1 mm. The parvicellular part of the Vc (Vcpc), situated in its basal region, was distinguishable from the Vc proper by a significant reduction of the positivity elicited by stimulation of the median nerve and by a rapid growth of a diphasic SEPs to stimulation of the posterior tibial nerve. In the other thalamic nuclei, stimulation of the median nerve elicited triphasic SEPs of a very small amplitude, suggesting a volume conduction current from the lemniscal pathway. With the macroelectrode, the positivity in the Vc was sensitive to electrode manipulation and the thalamic nuclei could not be distinctly outlined. SEP monitoring using the semimicroelectrode significantly improved the precision of target localization, which allowed minimizing of the volume of the therapeutic lesion without losing surgical effectiveness, while avoiding complications associated with increased penetration of the coagulating electrode. It is suggested that recording serial thalamic SEPs with the semimicroelectrode is a practical method to refine stereotactic targets in the thalamus.\r"

This retrospective study was undertaken to examine the role of surgery in those cases presenting with large cystic parenchymal and cisternal lesions in the current era of anthelminthic agents administered orally. A total of 237 patients presented with newly diagnosed neurocysticercosis to our institution over a recent 5-year period (mean age, 31.2 years). Among those who presented with cystic mass lesions predominantly affecting the brain parenchyma and cisternal spaces, 20 (8.4%; mean age, 40.2 years) with large cystic lesions subsequently underwent surgical intervention, either because of an emergent presentation or because they were refractory to medical management. Clinical presentation included increased intracranial pressure, focal neurological deficit, and seizure. Radiographic imaging (computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging) demonstrated 12 cases with cisternal lesions, 7 with parenchymal lesions, and 1 involving both compartments. Based on imaging guidelines, 30 operative procedures (excluding shunt revisions) were performed (14 craniotomies, 8 cerebrospinal fluid diversions, 7 stereotactic procedures, and 1 burr hole drainage). Fifteen (75%) showed neurological or symptomatic improvement over a median follow-up period of 36.4 months. There were three surgery-related complications and no deaths.\r"

Twenty-eight of the 30 patients had transsphenoidal surgery, and 27 had hormonally inactive tumors. Radiation therapy was begun within 1 month of surgery with a mean dose of 4855 +/- 70 cGy. Postoperative CT scans were obtained within 1 month of surgery and at 6- to 12-month intervals thereafter. Fourteen patients (45%) had no suprasellar tumor visualized in either the early postoperative CT scans or on subsequent scans. Eleven patients (35%) had a persistent suprasellar mass during the early postoperative period that resolved on serial CT evaluation. The mean time for resolution was 10.4 +/- 1.2 months. Six patients (20%) had a persistent suprasellar mass on serial CT evaluation. A persistent postoperative mass that subsequently resolved in many of the patients was thought to be caused by the gradual retraction of the postoperative packing and hematoma, as well as the effect of radiation on any residual tumor.\r"

In 9 children, a computer monitoring system measured the CSF output each second continuously for up to 24 hours. The monitoring was repeated daily for up to 9 days. The state of arousal of the patients was recorded simultaneously. In all children, daily EVD outputs were related to age, sex, weight, method of establishing the EVD, height of the drip chamber, time since insertion, and type of infecting organism. Computer monitoring revealed wide fluctuations in flow rate, with peak rates frequently greater than 20 ml/h and periods of flow arrest. These changes were usually associated with increased arousal, but also occurred with sleep. The mean EVD flow rate for all children was 6.3 ml/h. EVD output increased with age and weight. EVD output decreased with Gram-negative or multiple-organism infections and with elevation of the drip chamber. Resolution of the infection, sex of the patient, and method of establishing the EVD had no effect on output. These results predict that CSF production increases with brain growth in humans: that CSF production is depressed by Gram-negative and multiple-organism infections: that implanted CSF shunts with standard valves flow at equivalent rates to an EVD in the supine position; and that the CSF drainage requirements in this group are approximately equal to their EVD outputs.\r"

  ".U": "91148764\r", 
  ".W": "Stereotactic radiosurgery has proven to be an effective method of treating selected inaccessible or inoperable arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the brain. Radiation-induced obliteration of successfully-treated AVMs, however, occurs only after some latent period after treatment, depending on size, location, and dose. An experimental compartmental flow model is proposed to describe the hemodynamic alterations in the AVM as a result of the pathophysiological changes after radiosurgery, and to analyze temporal alterations in AVM blood flow rates and pressure gradients before complete obliteration. In representative small (low-flow, 150 ml/min) and large (high-flow, 440 ml/min) AVMs, it is found that increases in pressure gradients across certain vascular structures within the AVM occur during the normal course of radiation-induced flow decrease and AVM obliteration. The magnitude of these pressure alterations, however, may be within the normal physiological variations in cerebrovascular blood pressure. The effects of partial-volume irradiation of the AVM is examined by limiting radiosurgical treatment to varying portions of the flow compartments within the model. It is found that alterations in pressure gradients persist in unirradiated vascular shunts, even after complete obliteration of the treated AVM volume. These pressure alterations may increase the probability of hemorrhage from the untreated shunts of the AVM and cause redistribution of regional cerebral blood flow resulting in increased flow through these untreated shunts.\r"

  ".W": "Seven cases of vein of Galen aneurysms treated by percutaneous transvenous endovascular occlusion of the aneurysmal vein are presented. In one case, the approach was via the femoral vein, and in the other six cases, by the jugular vein. All of the malformations were multipedicular and, additionally, in six of the seven there was an intervening arterial-arterial network between the posterior thalamoperforating arteries and the wall of the venous aneurysm. This fistulous network was interpreted as purely arterial and not as an associated arteriovenous malformation. For this reason, the transvenous approach was considered justified, and was performed without risk of hemorrhage caused by retrograde venous hypertension. Measurement of intra-aneurysmal pressure during the course of treatment allowed better understanding of the hemodynamics of the lesions, guided the amount of occlusion to be accomplished during each treatment session, and thus may have prevented the phenomenon of normal perfusion pressure breakthrough. The percutaneous transvenous approach offers all the advantages of the transtorcular approach but avoids surgery. Because of our excellent angiographic and clinical results--five complete and two partial occlusions, with favorable outcomes and no major complications--we believe that this technique is better for the treatment of multipedicular vein of Galen aneurysms than transarterial embolization or surgery.\r"

The behavior of the cerebral pial arteries was measured by means of microscopic observation through a cranial window. The middle cerebral artery of each cat was clipped for 1 hour via the transorbital approach. Five hours after circulation was reestablished in the middle cerebral artery, Evans blue dye was injected intravenously: 30 minutes later, the animal was killed. Administration of nimodipine or saline in the treated or control group was started 5 minutes before the middle cerebral artery was clipped and maintained until the end of the experiment. Induced hypertension was produced by administration of dopamine during the occlusion. Damage to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was judged by extravasation of Evans blue dye. Cerebral edema and infarction were evaluated from histological findings. They were most prominent in the control group: the extent of hemisphere affected was as follows (mean +/- standard error): extravasation, 40.5 +/- 8.8%; edema, 43.2 +/- 5.7%; infarction, 35.5 +/- 9.6%. On the other hand, the extravasation of Evans blue dye and cerebral edema were significantly more extensive in the group treated with nimodipine and induced hypertension (extravasation, 28.2 +/- 9.6% of the hemisphere; edema, 30.3 +/- 7.1%) than in the group treated with nimodipine alone (extravasation, 18.5 +/- 8.7% of the hemisphere; edema, 19.4 +/- 6.3%), but the infarction size was similar in both groups (16.6 +/- 4.9% of the hemisphere in the former; 17.0 +/- 6.2 in the latter).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These grading scales are less applicable to patients with life-threatening intraparenchymal hematomas after aneurysmal rupture. During the last 3 years, four patients in a comatose state with brain stem compression syndromes documented by computed tomographic scans have undergone emergent operation in our neurosurgical service. Each patient was so critically ill that we believed it unwise to delay craniotomy for diagnostic angiography. The average delay from the onset of coma to skin incision was 3.02 hours (range, 1.67-6.5 hours), and the average delay from arrival in our unit until skin incision was 1.8 hours (range, 0.75-2.5 hours). The condition of two arousable patients deteriorated while they were in the emergency room, presumably from new bleeding. Each patient underwent craniotomy for hematoma evacuation, definitive aneurysm clipping, and lobectomy for decompression. Temporary clipping was employed in one patient, and intraoperative rupture occurred in two others. Three patients survived but retain significant disability. Emergent craniotomy with empiric exploration of appropriate subarachnoid cisterns after hematoma decompression may be life-saving in some cases. The delay imposed for diagnostic angiography may be avoided in attempts to save vital minutes of severe brain stem compression.\r"

The neurological examination was within normal limits with the exception of meningismus and right-sided facial sensory loss. A computed tomographic scan and a magnetic resonance imaging study demonstrated an acute hematoma in the right cerebellopontine angle. A 4-vessel cerebral angiogram revealed no abnormalities. Posterior fossa exploration disclosed a large, partially thrombosed, fusiform anterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysm, which indented the pons at the trigeminal root entry zone. The aneurysm was excised, and the patient made an excellent recovery. She was left with a persistent trigeminal sensory deficit. Anterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysms are rare lesions that generally present with a cerebellopontine angle syndrome; occasionally, facial sensory loss is also a feature. Isolated trigeminal sensory findings, as illustrated in this case, are extremely unusual in posterior fossa vascular lesions.\r"

It is noted that saphenous neuropathy is seen as a spontaneous entrapment syndrome as well as a complication of orthopedic and vascular procedures performed on the medial area of the knee. Saphenous neuralgia is often not recognized by neurosurgeons. If the condition is intractable, it does respond to surgical therapy.\r"

In four cases of large carotid-ophthalmic aneurysms removal of the anterior clinoid process and the roof of the optic canal gave easy access to the pericarotid ring. The anteromedial part of the pericarotid ring was dissected to expose the extradural portion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) proximal to the neck and to make enough room between the wall of the CS and the extradural portion of the ICA, thus allowing easy clipping of the neck. In one case of a giant carotid-ophthalmic aneurysm extending into the CS with an extradural origin of the ophthalmic artery and in two cases of an intracavernous aneurysm arising from the siphon knee, neck clipping was performed by opening the lateral wall and roof of the CS after removal of the optic strut. The opening of the lateral wall anterior to the 3rd nerve facilitated wide exposure of the anterior siphon knee. The horizontal portion of the intracavernous ICA as well as the whole aspect of the aneurysm could be exposed as a result of the extended opening of the cavernous roof anterior to the posterior clinoid process. Successful operative results were obtained in all seven patients. A visual field detect as an operative complication was noted in one patient. No disturbance of ocular movements was noted.\r"

Techniques for the insertion of percutaneous epidural electrodes, developed originally for pain management, have been adapted to this setting to permit direct stimulation of the spinal cord for intraoperative monitoring of evoked potentials. The clinical outcome in patients monitored by this technique has been consistent with evoked potential findings.\r"

We reviewed the clinical and historic features of 100 patients referred to our clinic for diagnosis and management of lichen planus. The age, gender, chief complaint, duration of the chief complaint, medical history, medications, and clinical findings were recorded. Past therapeutic modalities were reviewed. Of therapeutic significance, 25 patients with oral lichen planus had a secondary oral candidiasis. Management of symptomatic lichen planus with topical and systemic steroid is discussed. The pharmacology of topical and systemic steroid usage and the rationale for treatment are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The prevalence of candidal infection in lichen planus (LP) and its possible association with ulceration were independently examined in two archived series of 108 and 77 cases derived from two separate populations. To ensure that similar material was being compared, each case was histopathologically reassessed and confirmed as LP or reclassified as nonspecific lichenoid stomatitis (NSLS), lichenoid dysplasia (LD), or other (O). Three further sections, cut at 25 microns intervals, were stained with periodic acid-Schiff reagent for the identification of intraepithelial candidal pseudohyphae. As control specimens, 61 normal and 59 hyperkeratotic mucosal samples were similarly processed and examined. Candidal infection was found in 17.4% and 16.4% of ulcerated and nonulcerated LP cases, respectively, and in 40.0% and 16.7% of ulcerated and nonulcerated NSLS cases, respectively. One case of LD was infected. Each control series contained one infected case. The results indicate that candidal infection occurs more readily in LP and NSLS, with no apparent association with ulceration in LP. The comparatively marked increase in the infection prevalence of ulcerated NSLS cannot be statistically confirmed, and its significance remains uncertain.\r"

The purpose of this study was to survey a normal population without symptoms for the presence of certain putative signs of TMJ dysfunction in association with certain signs of occlusal discrepancy and to determine the presence of any gender variation. The subjects (217 men and 217 women) were examined for the presence of three putative signs of TMJ dysfunction: limited mandibular opening (under 37 mm), deviation on opening, and joint sounds. The subjects were also examined for the presence of four signs of occlusal discrepancy: an anterior slide from centric relation (CR) to centric occlusion (CO), lateral slide from CR to CO, nonworking occlusal contacts, and working disclusive contacts distal to the canines. CR is the mandibular position at which the condyles are in their most superior position on the posterior aspect of the articular tubercles. CO is the mandibular position at which the mandibular and maxillary teeth are in maximum intercuspation. There were no significant differences in the prevalence of the putative signs of TMJ dysfunction and occlusal discrepancy between men and women. It was concluded that factors other than the presence of these signs of TMJ dysfunction and occlusal discrepancy are responsible for the high predominance of female patients with TMJ dysfunction.\r"

Of 33,429 total specimens accessioned, there were 546 malignant oral neoplasms diagnosed and reported. Sixty-five (11.5%) originated from out of state. Invasive intraoral squamous cell carcinoma was the predominant tumor (69.7% of total), whereas lip cancer constituted only 2.8% of all malignancies. Minor salivary gland adenocarcinomas accounted for 11% of total malignancies whereas verrucous carcinoma, carcinoma in situ, and miscellaneous other forms of oral cancer accounted for the remainder (4.6%, 5.3%, and 6.6%, respectively). Cases of invasive squamous cell carcinoma were further analyzed by year, sex distribution, location subsite, age at diagnosis, and histologic grade. With the exception of histologic grading, we found that the characterization of cases of squamous cell carcinoma within the biopsy service tended to parallel results from a separate but related statewide analysis of both oral cancer and intraoral squamous cell carcinoma from Connecticut over a much longer time span. We concluded that the picture of oral cancer as characterized by cases within the University of Connecticut Oral Pathology Biopsy Service is generally reflective of the disease on a statewide level.\r"

The appearance of giant cells with cerebriform nuclei was helpful in identifying HTLV-related EOFL.

Combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy were administered with favorable results; however, 4 months later, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia developed, and 2 months later, generalized lymphadenopathy and hypercalcemia evolved. At this time, a diagnosis of ATL was made. The patient died of renal dysfunction 6 months after the initial presentation. In suspected cases of ATL and malignant diseases of T-cell lineage, namely, malignant lymphoma and mycosis fungoides, the presence of HTLV-1 infection should be confirmed by testing for anti-ATLA antibodies.\r"

They must both adequately seal the access preparation between visits and protect the obturated canal(s) from microleakage until a permanent restoration can be placed. The efficacy of Cavit and T.E.R.M. (a new light-cured composite product) was compared with the use of a carbon black coronal microleakage protocol. The teeth examined had previously received coronal restorations. After the teeth were accessed, restored with Cavit or T.E.R.M., and exposed to the dye, they were cleared. Three-dimensional assessment then revealed that Cavit more consistently provided an effective seal. In addition, a great deal of microleakage was observed around the permanent restoration-tooth interface. This indicates that perhaps leaking permanent restorations should be removed in their entirety before initiation of endodontic treatment.\r"

In addition, the utility of flexible fiberoptic endoscopy (FFE) for ETT position determination in inexperienced hands was examined. One adult dog was sedated and instrumented in the esophagus and trachea with identical ETTs. Four possible ETT positions (trachea, carina, bronchus, esophagus) were randomly assigned. One investigator positioned the ETT into the assigned position by fluoroscopy. Four other blinded investigators were asked to determine the ETT position using the fiberoptic catheter. Each blinded investigator was given 15 seconds to complete the examination and record the ETT position. Randomization resulted in 25 ETT positions examined by each of the four blinded investigators for a total of 100 FFE determinations. FFE ETT determination was correct in 97% of the examinations. All esophageal intubations were correctly identified. Two tracheal locations were misdiagnosed as carina and bronchial, while one carinal location was incorrectly judged as tracheal. The sensitivity of FFE ETT localization was 91.7%, and the specificity was 98.6%. There was no difference in performance by investigator training level or endoscopy experience. We conclude that FFE is a rapid and accurate method for determining both normal and abnormal ETT locations. ETT position determination can be confidently performed by health professionals with minimal training.\r"

Less than half of the respondents reported actual prehospital use of IO infusions in pediatric patients, and an additional third indicated that they were unaware of any future plans for introducing the technique into EMS practice. This study's documentation of the current limited prehospital use of intraosseous infusions indicates a need for concerted efforts to promote broad adoption and continued evaluation of the IO technique in prehospital pediatric emergency care. Suggestions to enhance adoption include increased utilization of existing successful IO teaching approaches, development of national EMS standards regarding intraosseous infusions, active involvement of EMS regulatory agencies for widespread practice changes, and consistent quality assurance activities.\r"

The solutions were compared with respect to efficacy, acceptability, wound complications, and side effects. We found comparable efficacy of the three formulations, with similar efficacy to 1% lidocaine infiltration for facial and scalp wounds. Anesthesia for extremity wounds was adequate in only 39.9% of cases, regardless of TAC strength. Wound complications and side effects were within expected and acceptable limits. Our findings support use of TAC for face and scalp lacerations and a change to a less concentrated TAC preparation, such as our \"TAC III,\" which is presumably safer for widespread use.\r"

The prompt diagnosis of ocular symptoms and signs and their differentiation can be of value in the early and correct diagnosis of head trauma, thus insuring effective treatment. These data emphasize the importance and prevention of head trauma in children. A pediatric victim of head trauma can surely benefit from the strict cooperation among emergency specialists, pediatricians, ophthalmologists, and neurologists.\r"

A better understanding of the immunogenic mechanisms of these allografts may permit less toxic and thus clinically applicable means of host immunosuppression. In this study, individual vascularized limb tissues (skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscle, bone, and blood vessels) and a whole limb were transplanted microsurgically across a strong histocompatibility barrier in rats. The respective cell-mediated and humoral immune responses generated in the hosts were determined by means of mixed lymphocyte cultures by radioactive 51Cr release assays and compared. No single tissue predominated in the elicited immune response. Rather, the various tissue components interacted with the host immune system in a complex but predictable pattern with differing timing and intensity. Surprisingly, the whole-limb allograft elicited less immune response than did allografts of its individual components. The data presented here also serve as a foundation for further elucidation of the immunogenic mechanisms of vascularized limb-tissue allografts.\r"

Its purposes were (1) to analyze the histologic/immunologic responses, (2) to study the effect of cyclosporine on graft survival, and (3) to examine the possibility of inducing tolerance. In rats differing at a major histocompatibility locus, vascularized gastrocnemius muscle transplants were performed based on the sural branches of the femoral artery and vein. Forty-two animals studied were divided into three groups: Group 1, allografts, was treated without cyclosporine; Group 2, allografts, was administered continuous cyclosporine; and Group 3, allografts, was administered cyclosporine for 6 weeks only. Evaluation consisted of gross examination, H&E histology, and immunologic studies (MLC, CML, and complement-dependent 51Cr lysis assay). Lytic units (LU) were derived from the assays and served as the indicator of immune response. Group 1 animals had uniform rejection with intense cell-mediated response (LU 23 to 47) and low humoral response. Group 2 animals had viable allografts throughout with suppressed lytic unit values of 0 to 9 initially, which rose to 14 to 29 at 6 weeks despite continuous cyclosporine treatment. Group 3 animals showed rejection similar to the untreated animals. Autografts were performed as controls and survived indefinitely. Analysis of variance was significant at p less than 0.05. Using a reliable rat model for vascularized muscle allografts, we found that in transplantation across a major histocompatibility barrier, the initial immune response was primarily cell-mediated. Cyclosporine suppressed rejection only when given continuously, and short-term cyclosporine treatment did not induce a tolerant state. These data should be useful for future studies of vascularized muscle allografts.\r"

The pathologically dilated vessels in the middle and deep dermis were found to have defective innervation with only single or no nerve fibers in their vicinity, while other structures in the skin showed a normal density of fibers. NSE- and PGP-like immunoreactive (-LI) nerve fibers were observed innervating vessels with a normal morphology and other structures in the skin, such as sweat glands and hair follicles, as free nerve endings and in nerve bundles. The nerve bundles were often seen to pass the ectatic vessels without giving off any branches. CGRP-LI nerve fibers were detected running toward epidermis, whereas no fibers were found around the ectatic vessels. NF-LI fibers were seen innervating normal vessels in dermis, while in relation to the dilated vessels, no or only occasional fibers were observed. The lack of innervation may be of importance for the development of the disease as a result of decreased tonus of the vessels and/or a loss of neuronal trophic factors.\r"

This retrospective study was undertaken to evaluate and compare the long-term results obtained with iliac or cranial cancellous bone graft material in the area of alveolar clefts and was based on the independent experience of two plastic surgeons from the same center using exclusively cranial or iliac cancellous bone, respectively. The criteria for surgery were similar. The surgical technique, with the exception of the bone-grafting material, also was similar, and all patients were treated by the same group of orthodontists. Fifteen patients from each group, from a total of over 100 patients, were randomly selected and included in the study. All patients were followed up from 18 to 60 months. Operative and perioperative parameters, donor-site morbidity, and long-term results were evaluated, compared, and analyzed. There were no significant differences between the two groups, and equally good results in terms of bone incorporation, tooth eruption, and appearance were obtained with both iliac and cranial bone grafts. We conclude from our study that successful bone grafting is primarily achieved by adherence to meticulous surgical technique, simultaneous closure of coexisting oronasal or palatal fistulae, use of cancellous bone particles only, and coverage of the grafts with well-vascularized flaps. The source of bone graft does not seem to primarily influence the success of the outcome.\r"

Early definitive bone and soft-tissue reconstruction has been performed in 37 patients. One-hundred and seventy-seven primary bone grafts were utilized in 33 patients for orbital, nasal, zygomatic, and maxillary reconstruction. Twenty-six patients required mandibular repair with compression or reconstruction plates. Soft-tissue reconstruction was provided by a combination of flaps. Four patients had extensive soft-tissue loss replaced by free vascularized omental flaps. The omentum provided circumferential coverage of the mandibular reconstruction and reconstruction of the floor of the mouth and was then tunneled in a circle through both cheeks into the middle and upper face. The omentum reconstructed deficits in the hard palate and upper buccal sulcus and was then wrapped around all zygomatic, orbital, and midfacial bone grafts and used to fill in dead space in the maxillary, ethmoid, and frontal sinuses. The omentum is not used to provide contour and bulk, but to cover bone grafts and plates and fill in dead space. Carefully shaped bone grafts provide the correct craniofacial scaffold. Early restoration of a midfacial bony scaffold and the prevention of soft-tissue contraction facilitate secondary reconstruction. Four late total nasal reconstructions with tissue-expanded forehead skin wrapped around bone grafts were performed.\r"

Twelve New Zealand white rabbits underwent surgically induced fractures of the right infraorbital rim and fracture ostectomies (4 to 5 mm) of the left infraorbital rim. Animals were sacrificed 2, 4, and 8 weeks postfracture. Bone, including periosteum, obtained from each fracture or fracture osteoctomy site was divided longitudinally for hematoxylin and eosin staining, fluorescent microscopy, microangiography, and microradiography. Sequential fluorochrome labels of oxytetracycline (30 mg/kg), alizarin complexone (30 mg/kg), DCAF (20 mg/kg), and xylenol orange (90 mg/kg) were administered 24 hours preoperatively and at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks postfracture. All fracture and fracture ostectomy sites demonstrated vascular ingrowth, mineralization, and woven bone formation by 2 to 4 weeks postoperatively, beginning with a cartilage precursor. Subsequently, the woven bone was replaced with remodeled lamellar bone, resulting in complete bony healing by 8 weeks postoperatively. These steps were substantiated by microscopic, microradiographic, and radiologic examination of the specimens. This study demonstrates that fractures of the facial bones in a rabbit model heal by a process of new bone formation that resembles secondary union in endochondral bones.\r"

  ".W": "Synkinetic movements are secondary to facial palsy because they appear like a late sequela to spontaneously healing facial nerve injury. They are produced by an involuntary contraction of a muscle group simultaneous with contraction of other homologous muscle groups. The disorderly regeneration of severed axons is responsible for these movements. According to the Lippschitz theory, the regenerating nerve fibers sprout into the wrong peripheral branches. Between 1975 and 1986, 71 patients with facial paralysis were evaluated. Spontaneous recovery from the facial paralysis occurred in 28 of these patients; 14 (50 percent) developed synkinetic movements, and surgical treatment was sought by only 6 patients. In all patients, the lesion of the facial nerve was in the trunk, proximal to the principal ramification. The most frequent clinical finding was simultaneous activation between the orbicularis oculi and the elevators of the corner of the mouth (12 patients) or the elevators of the upper lip (2 patients). In 8 patients, in whom the slight synkinesis was not noticed by the patients, surgical correction was not necessary, but in the other 6 patients with severe aesthetic disturbances, surgical treatment for \"disconnection\" of the wrong impulses was realized. I obtained this \"disconnection\" through resection of the involved perioral muscle groups instead of paralysis of the orbicularis oculi. Follow-up of the 6 patients operated with the surgical treatment proposed herein for between 4 and 8 years has shown good aesthetic results without functional or aesthetic sequelae.\r"

The resection is strictly intrapalatine, and careful suturing in three planes seems to lead to complete disappearance of the often unbearable postoperative pain. The soft palate is shortened but nonetheless still resembles a normal soft palate. Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) was described by Ikematsu in 1952. This method has taken on a new lease of life in recent years. Its efficacy is generally accepted, and its use, especially in cases of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, is the only treatment of the palatal velum at present practiced. In addition to aesthetic problems, this method generally gives rise to complications in the shape of temporary--but sometimes considerable--pain, nasal regurgitation, and a nasal voice. In a small percentage of patients, some of these disorders may prove irreversible. In my series of eight patients, five were obese and presented with hypertension. Three of them also were suffering from obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. The three others were ordinary snorers who caused considerable inconvenience to sleeping partners.\r"

Patients were followed for a minimum of 3 years. The groups, which were matched for patient age and implant size, were evaluated at 3, 12, 24, and 36 months for capsular contracture, steroid atrophy, and other complications. With completion of the double-blind study, the patients with submuscular gel-saline implants with only saline added had an overall capsular contracture rate of 38 percent at 3 months, 38 percent at 12 months, and 44 percent at 24 and 36 months. Those with methyl prednisolone had an overall capsular contracture rate of 14 percent at 3 months, and this remained unchanged through the end of the study. The rates of all other complications were comparable. Methyl prednisolone in a dose of 16 mg in 40 cc saline (concentration 40 mg%), when used in the outer lumen of a double-lumen gel-saline implant in a submuscular pocket, is both safe and efficacious in reducing the risk of capsular contracture for a minimum of 3 years in patients undergoing immediate breast reconstruction with submuscular mammary implants.\r"

The silicone prosthesis is not a homogeneous implant but is a milieu of various silicone chemistries. Silicone polymer precursors and prosthesis components (silicone shells, shells extracted of their low-molecular-weight components, silica-free silicone, silicone oil, fumed silica, and silicone extract) were implanted subcutaneously using a nonhemorrhagic technique into the backs of Lew/SsN rats (n = 90), two implants per rat, for periods of 7, 14, 28, 56, and 90 days for a total of 6 implants per material per time period. Histologic analysis was performed on specimens from the harvested soft tissue. The intensity of the cellular and capsular response was lowest for the silicone oil and increased as the material's molecular weight increased and material compliance decreased. Fumed silica elicited the most highly reactive cellular response. From this study it is apparent that the polymer's molecular weight influences its migration, encapsulation, and intensity of cellular response. Further, the silicone extract distillate elicited a highly intense cellular response with pronounced lymphocyte invasion. The human relevance of this work awaits further correlation with implant retrieval and in vivo performance.\r"

In their experience, the results obtained were satisfactory: All patients treated achieved surgical recovery. The authors see a wide future for skin-expander use in pressure-ulcer treatment. They have a working hypothesis about using expanders to progressively advance sensitive skin in areas subject to ulceration. This hypothesis is based on the possibility of reexpanding the same flap several times, as has been seen in the treatment of other types of pathology.\r"

It became apparent that growth within the chamber depended heavily on membrane porosity and the presence of the microarteriovenous shunt. Different membrane porosities ranging from 0.0, 0.25, 1.2, to 8.0 microns were evaluated (n = 48). Optimal growth occurred with the 1.2-microns and the 8.0-microns micropore Millipore. Growth within the chamber consisted of a radial deposition of collagen and neovascularization originating from the arteriovenous (A-V) anastomosis. In contrast, control chambers (no A-V anastomosis), with the preceding range in membrane porosity, experienced little to no cell growth. In addition, the majority of A-V shunts did not remain patent in chambers having 0.0-microns porosity or 0.25-microns porosity. Thus it is apparent that a strong relationship exists between membrane porosity, patency, and in situ vascularization allowing for the proliferation of cells and collagen.\r"

  ".W": "The objectives of the present experiments were to study the effects of long-term low-dose nicotine treatment on skin hemodynamics, viability, and microvascular morphology in 4 x 10 cm dorsally based acute random-pattern skin flaps in the rat. In addition, the reversibility of the nicotine-induced detrimental effects on skin-flap viability following cessation of nicotine treatment also was investigated. Low-dose nicotine (0.6 mg/kg) administered twice daily and subcutaneously for 24 weeks significantly (p less than 0.05) decreased skin-flap capillary blood flow, distal perfusion, and length and area of skin viability compared with the saline-treated control (n = 15). However, these same parameters in rats (n = 15) whose nicotine treatment had been withheld for 2 weeks prior to skin-flap surgery were not significantly different from the control, thus indicating that the detrimental effects of this long-term, low-dose nicotine treatment were reversible. The mean plasma level of nicotine in the nicotine-treated rats was 8.1 +/- 0.4 micrograms/dl and was within the range of plasma nicotine levels reported for human heavy cigarette smokers. Light and electron microscopic studies did not show evidence of histologic damage to the cutaneous microvasculature in acute random-pattern skin flaps and samples of normal (nonoperated) skin in nicotine-treated rats. It is concluded that long-term plasma levels of nicotine similar to those of heavy cigarette smokers are detrimental to the capillary blood flow and viability of random-pattern skin flaps in the rat. These deleterious effects can be avoided if skin flaps are raised 2 weeks after cessation of nicotine treatment. This low-dose nicotine treatment does not cause histologic damage to the microvasculature. Other pathogenic mechanisms of nicotine-induced skin flap ischemia are discussed.\r"

For infrapopliteal bypass, autogenous veins have better patency rates than synthetic grafts. Although not resolved, in situ bypasses seem to be better than reversed bypasses, especially for \"far away\" segments. Although the etiology is not understood, it is a well-known clinical finding that sclerosis affects arteries more than the veins and, as a whole, is more advanced in lower extremities compared with the trunk and upper extremities. Our experience with eight patients in whom critical soft-tissue defects were covered with free-tissue transfers in severely compromised lower extremities utilizing the in situ saphenous vein bypass as the inflow is presented. Simultaneous bypass and free-tissue transfers were performed in seven and delayed free-tissue transfer was done in one. Follow-up ranged from 6 months to 3 years. To date, two patients underwent amputations. Five patients are able to maintain bipedal ambulation. One patient is wheelchair-bound with intact lower extremities. In well-selected patients, this procedure may offer an alternative treatment to amputation. However, because of the complexity of these combined procedures, we strongly urge careful patient selection.\r"

Vein replacements are the most vulnerable to thrombosis because of their low shear rates and low pressure. Experimental replacement of microvenous segments with prosthetic segments has shown little success. Recent technological advances in biomaterials and control of thrombogenesis provide the potential for success in the development of venous prostheses. The purpose of this study was to assess the use of nonbiodegradable composite polyurethane microvascular prostheses for reconstruction of rat femoral veins. Rat femoral venous defects of 10 mm were reconstructed with autogenous vein (n = 12), unprocessed plain polyurethane (n = 5), and nonbiodegradable composite polyurethane (n = 31). Patency was evaluated by direct observation and proximal venous milking tests. The patency rate of composite grafts was not significantly different from that of isotopic vein (p = 0.5, Fisher's exact test), and both had higher patency than unprocessed polyurethane (p less than 0.01). Composite grafts were examined sequentially using light and scanning electron microscopy. Grafts were fully endothelialized between the first and third months. The neointimal, neomedial, and neoadventitial layers could be seen more distinctly over time. New opportunities in reconstructive microsurgery may be opened by microvascular prostheses that are complaint and thromboresistant.\r"

A practical approach to antibiotic decision-making involves comparing the advantages and disadvantages of each group of antibiotics available while remembering the patient population being treated and the common pathogens encountered in one's practice. It is helpful to study the penicillin derivatives in approximately chronologic order of development and the cephalosporins in terms of generations because this puts the use of each individual agent in perspective. Familiarity with commonly encountered adverse antibiotic reactions, dosage guidelines, and special situations (pregnancy, pediatric patients) will help avoid problems associated with antibiotic use. Finally, having one or more useful references at hand will aid in resolving questions about antibiotic use.\r"

A few basic laboratory studies, especially a sputum Gram stain, can allow for more specific treatment.

At recall 14 women were known to have diabetes and five were again pregnant with recurrent gestational diabetes. The early development of diabetes was associated with a fasting plasma glucose greater than 6 mmol/l during pregnancy and with a high plasma glucose response to oral glucose which persisted after delivery. Obesity was predictive of non-insulin-dependent diabetes whereas those that later required insulin were not obese. At recall, seven of the remaining 37 women were found to have unrecognized diabetes, 13 had impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and 17 were normal by WHO criteria using a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test. In these 37 women, fasting plasma glucose and the glucose response to oral glucose in pregnancy were not predictive of subsequent diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance. Obesity in pregnancy and subsequent weight gain were associated with non-insulin-dependent diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance at recall. Insulin deficiency was observed during the oral glucose tolerance test in the diabetics (the mean +/- SEM ratio insulin area:glucose area 4.1 +/- 1.3 diabetics, 10.7 +/- 1.8 controls, p less than 0.05), whereas in the group with impaired glucose tolerance insulin levels were high and in proportion to their hyperglycaemia (insulin area:glucose area 10.9 +/- 1.4 IGT, 9.4 +/- 1.4 controls). Women with normal glucose tolerance and previous gestational diabetes had significantly lower insulin responses than their controls, despite mild hyperglycaemia (insulin area:glucose area 4.0 +/- 0.7 normal glucose tolerance, 7.6 +/- 1.1 controls, p less than 0.02). Abnormalities of glucose tolerance and insulin secretion are present following a gestational diabetic pregnancy. Gestational diabetes identifies women at risk for developing diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance, both of which are risk factors for premature vascular disease.\r"

One patient also developed a degree of reversible renal insufficiency, whilst another may have had associated infectious mononucleosis. All three cases showed evidence of impaired mitochondrial beta-oxidation of valproate. In one the impairment was at the stage catalysed by fatty acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, in another at the stage catalysed by 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and in the third at the stage catalysed by enoyl-CoA hydratase and possibly also at the next stage catalysed by 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase. The impaired beta-oxidation meant that valproate metabolism was diverted into various alternative pathways. Plasma concentrations of the suspected hepatotoxic metabolite 4-en-valproate were normal for the valproate-treated population in all cases. By analogy with certain spontaneous and acquired human disorders of branched chain amino acid metabolism, it is suggested that valproate-associated hepatotoxicity may represent the consequences of a valproate overload on a limited mitochondrial beta-oxidation capacity, causing accumulation of a toxic product of endogenous branched chain amino acid metabolism.\r"

In our series of 293 patients, females outnumbered males in the ratio 5:1 and most presented with urinary infection, whereas males most commonly presented with features of renal damage such as proteinuria, hypertension or renal failure. Males more commonly had bilateral scarring and persistent reflux. One hundred and forty-seven patients were followed for two years or more (range 2-19 years); deterioration in renal function occurred in 55 (37 per cent). Risk factors for a rise in plasma creatinine were, in descending order, the presence of proteinuria, an elevated plasma creatinine concentration, bilateral scarring, male sex and the presence of hypertension. Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that the independent risk factors were proteinuria, elevated plasma creatinine concentration and hypertension; gender and the presence of persistent reflux had no independent influence on the course of renal failure.\r"

The recognition of such diverse aetiology may be importance since clinical features are non-specific, and may consist only of raised intracranial pressure, allowing confusion with 'benign intracranial hypertension'. The existence of effective treatment both for the thrombosis and for many of the underlying disorders makes early diagnosis essential. The prognosis of treated patients may be favourable.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the incidence and causes of hypercalcaemia in a hospital population in Hong Kong, all 29,107 samples received in the laboratory in one year were analysed for plasma calcium and albumin, and samples with a plasma calcium concentration adjusted for albumin greater than 2.55 mmol/l were investigated. Plasma calcium greater than 2.55 mmol/l was found in 462 patients. Repeat samples were received from 302 of these and hypercalcaemia was confirmed in 183. The main causes of hypercalcaemia were malignancy (72.1 per cent), tuberculosis (6.0 per cent), and primary hyperparathyroidism (5.5 per cent). In the malignant hypercalcaemia group, carcinoma of lung was the most common (31.8 per cent) and carcinoma of breast was uncommon (3.0 per cent). Secondary deposits in bone were detected in 35 of the 122 solid tumours. In order to identify the mechanism of hypercalcaemia the contributions of renal tubular reabsorption and increased bone resorption to the plasma calcium concentration were calculated. Increased tubular reabsorption was the main contributor to hypercalcaemia in primary hyperparathyroidism and carcinoma of liver (none of whom had bony metastases) and it contributed significantly to hypercalcaemia in carcinoma of lung without bony metastases and carcinoma of oesophagus. We conclude that in Hong Kong (a) primary hyperparathyroidism is uncommon, (b) tuberculosis is an important cause and (c) humoral factors may be responsible for a relatively high proportion of cases of malignant hypercalcaemia.\r"

  ".W": "In a prospective study, sera from over 700 patients with suspected vasculitis, including over 200 patients undergoing renal biopsy, were examined for antibodies to neutrophil cytoplasmic antigen (ANCA). An indirect immunofluorescence assay on ethanol fixed human neutrophils identified two types of autoantibody: C-ANCA, which produces diffuse cytoplasmic staining and P-ANCA, which produces an artefactual nuclear/perinuclear staining pattern. The diagnosis of patients in whom ANCA of either form was found was established following case note review according to defined diagnostic criteria. Forty of 45 patients whose sera contained C-ANCA at a titre of greater than or equal to 1/40 satisfied the diagnostic criteria for Wegener's granulomatosis or microscopic polyarteritis. Twelve of 30 patients with P-ANCA at a titre of greater than or equal to 1/40 were also classified as having one of these disorders. Seventeen of the remaining 18 patients had immune-mediated disorders with deep organ damage. Of 47 ANCA-positive patients who underwent renal biopsy, 21 had glomerulonephritis associated with Wegener's glomerulonephritis and a further 22 had a necrotizing or crescentic glomerulonephritis. Ethanol fixation is important for discrimination of C-ANCA and P-ANCA. C-ANCA are highly specific for Wegener's granulomatosis and microscopic polyarteritis. In patients undergoing renal biopsy, the presence of these antibodies is highly specific for a necrotizing or crescentic glomerulonephritis.\r"
