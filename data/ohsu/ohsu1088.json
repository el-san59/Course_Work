The authors report on six cases from five different surgeons at three institutions, in which the entire lens was inadvertently delivered on attempted expression of the nucleus after circular capsulorrhexis. In one case, scanning electron microscopy suggests that the smooth edge of a small, closed, capsular tear is not capable of controlled extension to allow nuclear egress. Therefore, superior radial anterior capsular relaxing incision is recommended when circular capsulorrhexis is used in extracapsular cataract extraction.\r"

To test this hypothesis, the authors devised an anterior and a posterior trauma model in the cat eye. Thirty events were studied using the anterior trauma model and eight with the posterior model. The only observable effect of succinylcholine administration was forward displacement of the lens and iris. No intraocular content was lost in any event. The authors believe this study supports the argument that, when indicated, succinylcholine may be considered in open globes.\r"

In two cases of Staphylococcus epidermidis endophthalmitis, after cataract surgery was performed by the same surgeon on the same day, genetic analysis demonstrated that the infecting organisms from the two patients' vitreous were distinct, and, furthermore, that in each case the external isolates were indistinguishable from the vitreous isolate. The results implicate the patients' external tissues as the source of the infecting organism in those cases of acute postoperative endophthalmitis studied. Therefore, attention should be directed toward the external tissues and their microbial flora in the prophylaxis and prevention of postoperative bacterial endophthalmitis.\r"

Using preferred correction, a Snellen acuity of 6/18 or better was achieved by 65%, and a reading line of N8 or better was achieved by 57% of index grafts. Thirty-eight percent had more than 5 diopters (D) of astigmatism in the graft. Approximately 75% of patients reported satisfaction with their graft (satisfaction being associated with better acuity in the grafted eye than the other eye), graft clarity, and a perceived improvement in lifestyle. Dissatisfaction appeared to be associated with graft failure and problems with contact lens wear. The findings have implications for patient selection for corneal transplantation and for the measurement of outcome.\r"

Eight other family members were identified with intraretinal crystals similar to those seen in the proband but in varying degrees of progression. Transmission electron microscopy of circulating lymphocytes in several patients demonstrated crystals and granular osmophilic material of unknown composition contained within abnormal lysosomes. These crystals are similar in appearance and location to those seen in cholesterol ester storage disease. This family demonstrates an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, as well as other differences from classic Bietti's crystalline dystrophy. The authors, therefore, suggest that this new entity be named autosomal dominant crystalline dystrophy.\r"

Glaucoma was found more commonly among children followed more than 60 months and was diagnosed up to 105 months after surgery. Typically, the glaucoma was open angle and asymptomatic. Four children had had previously normal pressures recorded. With longer follow-up, it is likely that more children will be diagnosed with glaucoma after lensectomy/vitrectomy procedures.

In an intraindividual bilateral comparison of 245 white patients with open-angle glaucoma, the authors evaluated whether the glaucomatous optic nerve damage was greater or less in the eye with the larger optic nerve head. Highly myopic eyes were excluded. The difference in optic disc area of one eye as compared with the contralateral eye was not significantly correlated to the differences in visibility of retinal nerve fiber bundles and mean visual field defect between the two eyes. Mean perimetric loss and the retinal nerve fiber layer index were not significantly higher in the eye with the larger or smaller optic nerve head. This indicates that in whites, high myopes excluded, the susceptibility to glaucomatous optic nerve fiber loss may be independent of the optic disc size.\r"

Generally, for control and ocular hypertensive eyes, the median values of cupping and pallor were significantly larger in the left eye than in the right, except for depth in the inferior quadrant (right eye minus left eye = 9.3%, P = 0.000) and pallor in the nasal quadrant (right eye minus left eye = 21.3%, P = 0.01), which were preferentially larger in the right eye than in the left in ocular hypertensive eyes. Ocular hypertensive eyes also showed a greater difference between the right and left eyes compared with control eyes for inferior depth (P = 0.06) and nasal pallor (P = 0.02). Detection of optic disc differences as a sign of ocular hypertension between the right eye and the left should evaluate the inferior and nasal quadrants of the disc.\r"

In a series of 14 patients with this diagnosis, 10 had associated neurologic disorders. Clinical-neuroradiologic correlation identified the brainstem as the site of the lesion in some patients. The ipsilateral pupil was involved in 12 patients and was miotic with a trace or no reaction to light on the side of the palsy in 8 of the 12 patients. In two of these eight patients, the pupil was documented to be dilated and fixed in early infancy and subsequently became miotic at several months of age, concurrent with emergence of other signs of aberrant reinnervation. Pupillary miosis as a result of aberrant reinnervation appears to be much more frequent after congenital than acquired pupillary-involving oculomotor palsy. Four patients showed better visual acuity in the paretic eye, an unexpected finding. The paretic eye appeared to have a fixational advantage if the patient had nystagmus, presumably due to asymmetric dampening of the nystagmus. Significant anisometropia and astigmatic errors in the paretic eye were present in essentially all patients.\r"

Eyelid springs have been used for patients with orbicularis muscle palsy to provide corneal protection while maintaining vision by restoring some kinetic eyelid function. The authors report on 24 patients with facial nerve paralysis who underwent implantation of an eyelid spring over a period of 8 years. The most common cause of orbicularis muscle paralysis was acoustic neuroma, followed by squamous cell carcinoma. Eighty-three percent of the cases successfully regained and maintained their eyelid function during the follow-up period, averaging 3.0 years. We have modified the spring to allow permanent attachment to the orbital rim by wiring. This modification of the surgical technique has minimized the most common postoperative complication: loosening of the spring from its periosteal attachment with subsequent loss of function and extrusion. In addition, transcutaneous adjustments of the spring now can be made without an incision using clasp-adjusting dental pliers. In selected patients, the placement of an eyelid spring prevents the corneal complications associated with paralytic lagophthalmos while maintaining visual function.\r"

Collagen shields have been used to deliver drugs and promote corneal epithelial healing. Presoaked collagen shields deliver many drugs to the eye as well as or better than traditional methods such as frequent topical therapy or subconjunctival injection. The efficacy of drug delivery by collagen shields was demonstrated in animal models of graft rejection and bacterial keratitis. Iontophoresis uses an electrical current to carry an ionized drug across tissue. Transcorneal iontophoresis delivers high concentrations of a drug to the anterior segment of the eye. Transscleral iontophoresis bypasses the lens-iris diaphragm and produces adequate vitreous levels. Pumps deliver fluid to the eye for extended periods of time via a tube with its distal opening in the conjunctival sac, corneal stroma, anterior chamber, or vitreous cavity. Clinical acceptance of the collagen shield for drug delivery to the anterior segment is better than iontophoresis or pumps, probably because the collagen shield is simpler and more convenient to use.\r"

There were no significant differences in postsurgical outcomes between the two groups of meniscal disorders with respect to clinical and questionnaire data. However, the DNR group generally exhibited a smoother, less erratic recovery. After surgery dramatic improvements were in range of motion, pain, and function in both groups, although some level of residual pain and dietary limitation remained in approximately half the subjects. The incidence of joint sounds and deviation were not improved by surgery. Significant differences were found between the two groups with respect to imaging results. Arthroscopy had little effect on the disk positions of DNR subjects: 84% were unchanged after surgery, and the remaining 16% were improved.

There was no significant difference between the effects of nitrous oxide or diazepam on memory given individually or in combination. Significant differences in psychomotor coordination were seen when comparing groups 2, 3, and 4 with group 1. However, no significant differences existed between groups 2, 3, and 4, indicating that nitrous oxide and diazepam both affect coordination but that their effects are not additive when combined in this manner. The trends in both the memory and psychomotor data suggest diazepam to have a greater effect than nitrous oxide, and the combination to have a greater effect than either agent individually. Further investigation in this area is needed.\r"

  ".W": "When a bicortical screw is used for the rigid fixation of sagittal split-ramus osteotomy, by definition the threads of the screw should engage in the buccal plates as well as in the lingual plates. In a study of six dry mandibles we found that when 2 and 2.7 mm screws are used in noncountersunk holes, it is almost certain that a thread will engage the buccal cortical plate. With countersinking 55% of the 2.7 mm and 27% of the 2.0 mm screws had no threads engaged in the buccal cortical plate. This changes these screws from bicortical to compression type. An anatomic study of bone thickness demonstrated that the thickest buccal and lingual cortical plates were in the superior border of the ramus, just distal to the last molar. In addition, a change in the intercondylar distance before and after surgery was observed in every mandible.\r"

Seventy-five HIV-seropositive patients with RAU were followed for up to 2 years, and lymphocyte subsets were analyzed in 42. Minor, herpetiform, and major ulcer types were seen, but unexpectedly, 66% of the patients had the usually uncommon herpetiform and major types. These types were temporally associated with symptomatic HIV disease. Patients with major RAU were significantly more immunosuppressed than those with minor or herpetiform RAU in that they had fewer CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes (p less than 0.05). The lesion of RAU is considered to represent a local breakdown in immunoregulation. The systemic immune imbalance seen with HIV disease may amplify the local defect and lead to more severe ulcers.\r"

Oral surgery was performed 2 1/2 to 3 hours after the last dose. Blood samples were collected at the time of operation, and immediately before antibiotic treatment, and 1, 2, and 6 hours after treatment. At all time points EA produced at least twice the total antibiotic (2'-acetyl erythromycin plus erythromycin) concentrations in plasma as ES. Erythromycin levels in plasma were at least as high after EA treatment as after ES. In periapical lesions erythromycin concentration after EA was three times higher (1.34 +/- 0.28 micrograms/gm) than after ES treatment (0.40 +/- 0.17 micrograms/gm). Although the total drug concentration in periapical lesions was about the same after EA (2.64 micrograms/ml) and ES (3.41 micrograms/ml), most of the drug recovered after ES was antimicrobially inactive anhydroerythromycin (3.01 micrograms/gm). The concentration of anhydroerythromycin in plasma was approximately the same as that of erythromycin after ES throughout the dose interval. After EA treatment both plasma and the periapical lesion samples contained hardly detectable amounts of anhydroerythromycin. Hence EA has a good bioavailability essential for treatment and prophylaxis of bacterial infections in dentistry.\r"

For comparison, the salivary secretion rate was studied in 83 healthy persons and in three other groups of hospitalized patients without malignant disorders. At the start of cytotoxic treatment the secretion rate in the patients with leukemia was lower than in healthy persons. The rate fell significantly after 1 to 3 days and later rose to the level seen in the healthy persons. Several interacting factors may have contributed to the decrease in salivary secretion rate, but the most important factor was probably the use of antiemetic drugs during the first 3 days of the study periods. No relationship was found between salivary secretion rate and the number of gram-negative rods found in the mouth. Patients with low salivary secretion rates had high numbers of yeast cells and more often oral candidiasis.\r"

The latter group was subdivided equally to produce three treatment groups: one undergoing occlusal splint therapy, one receiving antidepressant medication, and the third having a combination of occlusal splint and antidepressant therapy. The results showed clearly that there was a significant difference in response in the nonpsychiatric and combined-therapy depressed groups in comparison with the two depressed groups treated either with occlusal splint or with antidepressant therapy. The combined therapy led to resolution of the painful problem and the depression, whereas the single therapies were only partly successful in relieving the pain-dysfunction syndrome. The preexisting duration of this painful problem did not influence the response to therapy.\r"

In this study 49 cases of primary verrucous or squamous cell carcinoma from patients referred to a regional medical center were examined initially by Southern blot hybridization to detect HPV types 2, 6, 11, 13, 16, 18, and 32. Approximately 60% of carcinomas from certain head and neck sites, particularly the floor of the mouth, tongue, pharynx, piriform sinus, and larynx, were positive for episomal viral DNA of HPV-6, -11, -16, or -18. HPV DNA was found in some multiple tumors from separate sites of the same patient. Integration of viral DNA into the host cell chromosome was likely in a minority of the positive carcinomas, and no novel HPV DNA types were indicated by the hybridization analyses. Subsequently, DNA remaining from 30 of the carcinomas was examined by a more sensitive polymerase chain reaction amplification assay for DNA of HPV-6, -11, -16, and -18. Twenty-seven of the samples were positive for one or more HPV DNA types, with all positive carcinoma samples containing oncogenic HPV-16 or -18 DNAs. Almost all the patients examined were of the middle to older age group with a history of tobacco use. Although HPV infection of oral mucosa may be a frequent occurrence, a possible role for HPVs in the multifactorial etiology of head and neck carcinogenesis merits further epidemiologic investigation.\r"

The 10 cases of smokeless tobacco keratoses and 3 cases of verrucous carcinoma that we examined were all negative for HPV DNA. The PCR for the E6 open reading frame of HPV-16 correctly identified all cases that were positive by ISH. Only a single case that was positive by PCR was negative by ISH for HPV DNA. However, the PCR demonstrated the presence of HPV-16 infection in one case, which had hybridized most intensely with the probe for types 31/33/35 in the ISH. This discrepancy probably is due to the high degree of cross-hybridization in the ISH assay. PCR appears to be an effective technique for identifying HPV-16 DNA sequences in biopsy material from premalignant and malignant oral lesions.\r"

Positive hybridization signals were found in 26 specimens (24.8%). Only HPV-6/11 was detected. HPV DNA occurred significantly more often (p less than 0.005, chi-square analysis) in condyloma acuminatum (100%) and verruca vulgaris (100%) than squamous papilloma (13.3%), hyperkeratotic/acanthotic lesions (10%), and malignant and premalignant lesions (0%). The tongue (19.1%) and labial epithelium (17.1%) were infected most frequently. Nuclear reaction products indicating HPV infection were associated primarily with koilocytes. These results demonstrate the usefulness of commercial biotinylated probes for HPV DNA analysis in routine paraffin-embedded lesion specimens. They confirm HPV involvement in benign lesions of the oral mucosa but fail to associate HPV infection with oral cancer and precancer.\r"

The HPV DNA and viral capsid antigens were easily detected by in situ hybridization, Western blotting, and peroxidase-antiperoxidase staining.

The hybridization findings were compared with those of a comparable control group of patients with similar lesions who had a history of tobacco and alcohol use. None of the study group cases was reactive with any of the DNA probes. Two cases of the control group showed positive hybridization with HPV DNA probe types 6/11 and 16/18. The implications of these findings are presented and discussed in an attempt to clarify the role of HPV in HPV-associated oral epidermoid carcinomas.\r"

The position of the mandibular condyle is difficult to predict and quantify with existing routinely used radiographic techniques. An investigation was implemented to test the validity and reliability of digital subtraction to enhance transcranial plain films and to quantify positional changes of the condyle in a laboratory model. The model consisted of a mounted dried human skull and a mandibular condyle attached to a micromanipulator. Controlled changes in condylar position were made, and the condyle and fossa were imaged. The data were analyzed with descriptive statistics, analyses of variance to evaluate the sources of variability, and linear contrasts to evaluate the differences between observed and expected values. The results indicated that digital subtraction detected posterior positional change within 10% of the expected value. However, inferior positional changes were poorly detected and lateral positional changes could not be evaluated by this technique. We conclude that digitally subtracted transcranial radiographs may be useful for detection of posterior condylar movements, assuming that appropriate head-holding devices are used to fix x-ray source and head geometry.\r"

  ".W": "An initial study was performed to demonstrate the feasibility of pseudocolor contrast enhancement technique in digital subtraction radiography (DSR). DSR is an electronic image processing technique that has been shown to be of greater diagnostic value in the detection of small periodontal bone lesions than conventional radiography. Pseudocolor enhancement involves selectively assigning a unique color to each shade of gray present in a black-and-white subtracted image. Two image enhancement techniques were developed and tested in a phantom system consisting of extracted teeth set in blocks of plaster mixed with sawdust to simulate trabecular bone. It was found that experimentally induced periodontal lesions were more readily detected by the average clinician in both types of enhanced subtraction images than unenhanced subtractions. Furthermore, both enhancement techniques were of significantly greater diagnostic value for lesions smaller than 1.0 mm (p less than 0.001). The technique that colored an isolated area of interest was significantly more diagnostic at all depths tested (p less than 0.001 at 0.5 and 1.0 mm, and p less than 0.05 at 0.5 mm). Contrast enhancement may be a significant aid to the average clinician for the interpretation of DSR and the detection of small periodontal defects.\r"

Results regarding Haemophilus influenzae are reported here. Blood cultures obtained from 127 of the hospitalized patients did not yield growth of H. influenzae. H. influenzae was isolated from the nasopharynx of 88 children. Seventy-three strains were noncapsulated, 2 were type b, 2 were type f and 11 were not serotyped. Paired serum samples were available from 38 children with growth of noncapsulated H. influenzae in the nasopharynx as the only potential pathogen. Sixteen of them responded with significant increases in serum antibodies against outer membrane preparations prepared from their own nasopharyngeal isolates. Thirty-eight age- and sex-matched control children with pneumonia without growth of H. influenzae in the nasopharynx served as controls. Sera from each control patient were tested for antibodies against two strains of noncapsulated H. influenzae. Of those, 4 had significant increases in antibodies against one or both outer membrane preparations. The increases in serum antibodies against the outer membrane of noncapsulated strains of H. influenzae indicate that this organism might be a cause of pneumonia in some children.\r"

Comparison of the two conjugate vaccines revealed that HbOC produced an antibody response greater than or equal to 1.0 micrograms/ml in 96% compared with 72% who were vaccinated with PRP-D (P less than 0.05). The isotype distribution of the antibodies produced by the two vaccines was similar. While all of the vaccines resulted in higher concentrations of anticapsular IgG1 than IgG2, the IgG1:IgG2 ratio was significantly higher in subjects immunized with HbOC. The IgG1:IgG2 ratio was similar in subjects immunized with PRP or PRP-D. The clinical significance of these observations remains to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "The safety and immunogenicity of a Haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide conjugate vaccine linked to the outer membrane protein complex of Neisseria meningitidis (Hib-OMP) were evaluated among Apache and Navajo infants and children. One dose of the Hib-OMP was given to 42 children who were from 12 and 60 months of age. Ninety-two infants 6 to 8 weeks old were given one dose of Hib-OMP at the time of enrollment. A subsequent dose of the vaccine was given 2 months later and a third dose was offered between 12 and 15 months of age. All of the 12- to 60-month-old children achieved a protective antibody concentration (greater than 1 microgram/ml) 1 month postvaccination. Among the 6- to 8-week-old infants only 11% of the Apaches and 8% of Navajos had a protective anti-PRP antibody concentration prevaccination. One month post vaccination 68% of the Apaches and 69% of the Navajos had protective anti-PRP antibody concentrations. One month after the second immunization 67% of the Apaches and 75% of Navajos had protective anti-PRP concentrations. Among the infants that received the third (booster) immunization (N = 28) 74% had protective anti-PRP antibody titers just before the booster immunization. One month after the booster immunization all of the infants had protective concentrations of anti-PRP antibody. We conclude that the Hib-OMP is safe and highly immunogenic among Apache and Navajo infants and children.\r"

Forty-two patients ages 1 month to 15 years (mean, 2.5 years) were studied. IL-6 activity was detectable (greater than 50 units/ml) in 30 of 36 CSF samples collected at admission from patients with meningitis and in 1 of 23 controls with fever and normal CSF findings. Mean values were 36,000 units/ml (range, 151-156,000). IL-6 activity in CSF persisted during the first 5 days of illness. IL-6 concentrations at admission were not associated with clinical findings, CSF leukocyte, protein and glucose concentrations, serum C-reactive protein concentration and neurologic complications or sequelae. IL-6 was also detected in the serum of 3 of 14 patients with meningitis and in 0 of 7 controls with no infectious disease. The presence of IL-6 was not associated with bacteremia or with duration of fever before admission. The presence of IL-6 in the CSF of pediatric patients with bacterial meningitis is in accordance with available data on other cytokines and suggests their role as mediators of meningeal inflammation.\r"

Cerebrospinal fluid penetrations of imipenem and cilastatin were determined at various times after drug administration with mean cerebrospinal fluid: serum ratios of 14 and 10% for imipenem and cilastatin, respectively. The study was terminated when 7 (33%) patients developed seizure activity after antibiotic therapy was administered. The usefulness of imipenem/cilastatin for the treatment of bacterial meningitis in children may be limited by a possible increased incidence of drug-related seizure activity.\r"

A questionnaire was administered to street youths admitting to prostitution and to a group denying prostitution, as well as to sexually active adolescents who lived with their family and were attending an adolescent medical clinic. The age, gender, race, number of sexual partners, condom use, illicit drug use, anal intercourse and admission to prostitution were recorded for each of the subjects. Serology was obtained for hepatitis B markers and human immunodeficiency virus antibody. Multiple regression analysis was performed to determine the factors which might predict hepatitis B serologic status. A single subject, who admitted to prostitution, was found to be human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive. Seven of 43 (16%) admitted prostitutes compared with 1 of 44 (2%) other street youth and none of 27 controls demonstrated anti-hepatitis B surface antibodies. The higher rate of seropositivity in admitted prostitutes was statistically significant (P less than 0.0097). Two seropositive prostitutes had IgM hepatitis B core antibody suggesting recent infection. Two factors, number of partners (P less than 0.0007) and practice of anal intercourse (P less than 0.05), were identified in the multiple regression analysis as predictive of seropositivity. Thus adolescents who live on the street are at increased risk for becoming infected with hepatitis B virus. The difficulty in ensuring vaccine coverage in this population would support calls for including hepatitis B vaccination as part of childhood immunization.\r"

IgG2, IgG4 and combined IgG2-IgG4 deficiency was found in 3, 4 and 4 patients, respectively. IgG2 concentrations did not differ between patients with (n = 23) or without (n = 24) bacterial infections. Additionally the number of bacterial infections was similar between the patients with normal or low IgG2 and/or low IgG4. These data indicate that IgG subclass abnormalities are found in most children with human immunodeficiency virus 1 infection, but quantitative deficiencies of specific subclasses do not appear to explain the high frequency of bacterial infections occurring in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "The safety and immunogenicity of the HbOC conjugate vaccine have been evaluated in a study population of 61,080 children in the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program of Northern California. Half of the population served as controls. The vaccine was given as part of a three-dose regimen in the first year of life with the first dose given between 6 weeks and 6 months of age, a minimum interval of 1 month between doses and with the third dose given by 1 year of age. The vaccine was highly immunogenic with 97% of infants developing 1 microgram/ml or more of anti-polyribosyl phosphate antibody as measured by Farr assay 1 month after completion of the three-dose series and with 71% maintaining this concentration until a booster dose was given at approximately 18 months of age. There were three cases of Haemophilus influenzae type b disease after the first dose of vaccine and two of these children died. However, there was no statistically significant difference between either the incidence of H. influenzae type b disease or the mortality rate in infants after one dose of HbOC vaccine when compared with H. influenzae type b disease incidence and mortality in unvaccinated children of the same age. The rate of sudden infant death syndrome following HbOC vaccine was lower than that observed within the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program as a whole or in the three counties in which sudden infant death syndrome surveillance was tabulated. Immediate local and systemic reactions were evaluated by telephone interviews of 6887 infants within 72 hours of vaccine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of the HbOC conjugate Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine was evaluated in a study population of 61,080 infants in the Northern California Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program. Between February, 1988, and June, 1990, the HbOC vaccine was given as part of a three-dose series at 2, 4, and 6 months of age to 20,800 infants. The study population included children with a well-care visit at a study center during the first 6 months of life. There were 25 cases of Haemophilus influenzae type b disease in the study population: 22 in unvaccinated children and 3 in children who received only one dose of HbOC vaccine. The efficacy of the full three-dose series was evaluated by several methods: a primary analysis comparing fully vaccinated children with unvaccinated children from 7 to 18 months of age; a stratified exact analysis adjusted for age and seasonality; and a case-control analysis which further adjusted for known risk factors. The efficacy of three doses of vaccine was 100% with the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the three analyses at 68, 71, and 64%, respectively. There were no cases of disease resulting from two doses of HbOC vaccine yielding an estimate of 100% efficacy (95% confidence interval, 47 to 100) for two doses of HbOC vaccine. However, for children who had received only one dose of HbOC vaccine, vaccine efficacy was estimated to be 26% and the possibility that one dose of HbOC vaccine had no efficacy could not be excluded.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We conducted a meta-analysis of 19 studies to examine whether oral cephalosporins were associated with lower failure rates than oral penicillin in the treatment of Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis. The overall bacteriologic cure rate for penicillin was 84% (95% confidence interval (CI), 82%, 86%) compared with 92% (95% CI, 91%, 94%) among patients treated with cephalosporins (P less than 0.0001). The overall clinical cure rate in the penicillin groups was 89% (95% CI, 87%, 91%) compared with 95% (95% CI, 94%, 96%) in the cephalosporin group (P less than 0.001). There was no significant difference between the cephalosporins and the penicillins with respect to adverse events. There may be clinical circumstances in which treatment of Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis with cephalosporins is indicated.\r"

  ".W": "Diarrhea is a common illness among children in day-care centers (DCC). We hypothesized that the incidence of diarrhea was greater among children in their first 1 or 2 months after enrollment in a DCC than in any subsequent period in day care. We followed 442 children younger than 2 years of age enrolled in 13 randomly selected DCCs for the occurrence of diarrhea during a 14 1/2-month period. Parents completed standardized baseline questionnaires and research nurses visited the DCC twice weekly to record the occurrence of diarrhea and to collect stool specimens. Incidence rates, rate ratios, chi square statistics and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for crude and stratified analyses. The diarrheal incidence rate of 4.4 cases/child-year in the first 4 weeks in the centers was significantly (rate ratio, 1.6; confidence interval, 1.3 to 2.1; P less than 0.01) higher than the 2.7 cases/child-year incidence rate of diarrhea in subsequent weeks. The effects of gender, ethnicity, age, DCC size, previous DCC attendance and season were examined and did not account for the association observed between recent enrollement and risk of diarrheal illness. Rotavirus was identified in 18% of cases of diarrhea, but no association was seen with recent enrollment in DCC. A significantly higher incidence of diarrhea occurred in males compared with females (P less than 0.002) and in younger children (P less than 0.001) compared with older children. Diarrhea is common in children in DCCs and occurs significantly more frequently in children during their first 4 weeks in a DCC.\r"

The median age was 14 years and the median duration of symptoms before referral was 6 months; 65% had missed at least 2 weeks of school and 30% required a home tutor. There were few positive physical findings and no elevation of white blood cell count (median, 7000/mm3) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (median, 5 mm/hour). Twenty-five percent had no evidence of Epstein-Barr virus infection, 15% had current or recent infection and 60% had past infection; 33% of the latter had detectable antibody to early antigen but the titers were low. Human herpesvirus 6 titers in 8 patients were similar to those in age- and sex-matched controls. Of 17 patients contacted after a median of 26 months, 76% reported definite improvement, although 38% of these still experienced occasional symptoms. In this referral population chronic fatigue was a common presenting complaint, was associated with marked degrees of dysfunction and bore no relationship to Epstein-Barr virus or human herpesvirus 6 infection. In most children the disorder was self-limited, although a minority were persistently or severely affected.\r"

Fourteen babies (designated Group A) had a positive blood culture on the first day of life; 28 infants (Group B) and 6 infants (Group C) had bacteremia beyond the first day. Group C infants became septic as a result of intraabdominal pathology. Pathogens isolated from blood were correlated with those from preceding daily tracheal aspirates. The overall sensitivity of tracheal cultures in predicting results of blood cultures was 81% (Group A, 71%; Group B, 93%; Group C, 50%). The specificity of daily tracheal aspirates was ascertained from 28 of 50 ventilated infants who were nonseptic and had negative blood cultures during a 6-month period. Only 18 had consistently sterile tracheal aspirates (specificity, 64%). The mean number of days of intubation was 6.6 for the 10 false positive and 3.6 for the 18 true negative. Because of low positive predictive value (0.26) the role of daily tracheal aspirate culture is limited to providing early information regarding potential pathogens when sepsis occurs rather than to identify babies who are going to become septic.\r"

The study was undertaken to determine the concentrations of cefuroxime in the blood and middle ear effusions (MEE) of children between 6 and 12 years of age with acute otitis media and chronic OME after a single oral dose administration of cefuroxime axetil, the ester prodrug of cefuroxime. Cefuroxime axetil (250 mg) was administered 2 to 6 hours before either myringotomy for acute otitis media or myringotomy and tube insertion for chronic OME. Blood samples and middle ear aspirates were obtained from 31 children and the samples were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. Cefuroxime was recovered in measurable concentrations in all serum samples and in 15 (79%) of the 19 MEE specimens analyzed. No correlation was seen between cefuroxime MEE concentrations and effusion type, bacteriology or serum concentrations. This study shows that cefuroxime does penetrate into MEE when OME is present and that therapeutic concentrations can be achieved in some patients.\r"

However, its efficacy in the prevention of perinatal infection has not been fully evaluated in an endemic area. We recruited 110 high risk infants born to hepatitis B e antigen-positive-hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carrier mothers in a study of recombinant vaccine efficacy. They were randomized into 2 groups, A (54 infants) and B (56 infants), to receive 4 doses of vaccine, containing 20 or 10 micrograms of surface antigen, respectively, at 0, 1, 2 and 12 months of age. An additional 60 high risk infants were recruited later (Group C) and received three 20-micrograms doses of vaccine at 0, 1 and 6 months of age. All infants also received a dose (145 IU) of hepatitis B immunoglobulin soon after birth. Sera were collected at 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 12 and 14 months of age to assay HBsAg and anti-HBs. At 12 months of age the HBsAg carrier rates were 7.4 and 1.8%, in Groups A and B, respectively. In Group C the HBsAg-positive rate was 3.3%. HBsAg was invariably first observed between 0 and 2 months of age. Virtually all noncarrier infants developed substantial titers of anti-HBs at 12 months of age. No serious adverse effect was observed after vaccination.\r"

Edmonston-Zagreb vaccines were more effective than equivalent doses of Schwarz vaccines as measured by the proportion of vaccinated children with measles antibody concentrations greater than or equal to 200 mIU/ml 2 months after vaccination and the persistence of antibody at 18 to 24 months of age. High titer Edmonston-Zagreb vaccine administered at 6 months of age induced antibody concentrations greater than or equal to 200 mIU/ml in 83% of infants by plaque reduction neutralization and 93% of infants by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with high rates of antibody persistence at 12 to 24 months of age.

Forty-one infants had been randomly assigned to receive either ACV or whole cell vaccine at 2, 4 and 6 months of age. Antibody titers to pertussis toxin and filamentous hemagglutinin were significantly higher in ACV than whole cell vaccine recipients at 7 months; at 15 months antibody to filamentous hemagglutinin (but not pertussis toxin) remained significantly higher among those receiving ACV. At 19 months all 41 children received an ACV booster. Local and systemic reactions were few and minor and were equally distributed between the two groups. All children responded to booster with significant increases in antibody; these increases tended to be greater for those having been primed with ACV. ACV booster immunization appears safe and immunogenic, regardless of the vaccine given for primary immunization.\r"

Patients are typically white men in their 50s who smoke and drink, and they present with complaints of regurgitation, heartburn, and/or dysphagia. Endoscopic biopsies are required to confirm the diagnosis. Complications, such as stricture, ulcer, dysplasia, and malignant degeneration, occur in many cases. Adenocarcinoma is the most serious complication. Medical treatment, including life-style changes as well as pharmacologic therapy, usually relieves symptoms and heals esophagitis, but when it fails, antireflux surgery is indicated. Patients without evidence of dysplasia should undergo endoscopy yearly; those with mild dysplasia require more frequent surveillance. If biopsies disclose severe dysplasia, esophagogastrectomy should be performed.\r"

Therefore, all patients with hypertension or at risk for hypertension should be educated about nonpharmacologic measures to control blood pressure. Weight reduction and sodium restriction are cornerstones of nonpharmacologic management of hypertension. Although studies of the effects of aerobic exercise on blood pressure are not well designed, data confirm the value of such exercise. Relaxation therapy has been shown to lower blood pressure, but effects may be transient. Potassium and calcium supplementation has lowered blood pressure, but because study results are contradictory, the exact clinical criteria for use of such supplements have not been determined. Vegetarians have lower blood pressure than nonvegetarians, but no specific dietary components (eg, fiber, fat) have been documented as the beneficial factors. Because of its significant pressor effect, alcohol should be avoided by hypertensives. A low-fat diet is recommended to decrease cardiovascular risk and assist in weight control.\r"

  ".W": "Stimulation of the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR), which itself is not a protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK), activates a PTK and phospholipase C (PLC). Using the human T-cell leukemic line Jurkat and normal peripheral blood lymphocytes, we demonstrate that stimulation of the TCR specifically induces the recovery of PLC activity in eluates from anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates. Stimulation of the human muscarinic receptor, subtype 1, when expressed in Jurkat activates PLC through a guanine nucleotide binding protein but does not induce the recovery of PLC activity in eluates from anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates. Western blot analysis reveals that PLC-gamma 1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to TCR stimulation. Nearly all of the PLC activity recovered in eluates from anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates was depleted by anti-PLC-gamma 1 antibodies. Stimulation of the TCR on mutants derived from Jurkat that are defective in TCR-induced PLC activation results in markedly reduced, if any, PLC activity recovered in phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates and in no detectable PLC-gamma 1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus, the TCR functions like PTK growth factor receptors, but through an indirect interaction, to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma 1. Since other studies have implicated two members of the src family of PTKs in TCR-mediated signal transduction, our findings suggest that the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma 1 by a mechanism involving a src-like kinase may be the means by which the TCR regulates PLC activity in T cells.\r"

In contrast, the Drosophila pseudoobscura UO gene is only expressed in the adult, whereas the Drosophila virilis UO gene is expressed only in the third-instar larva. UO activity in these three Drosophila species is detected exclusively within the Malpighian tubules. By using P-element mediated germ-line transformation, UO genes from D. pseudoobscura and D. virilis were integrated into the D. melanogaster genome. The D. virilis and D. pseudoobscura UO transgenes were expressed in the third-instar larva and adult Malpighian tubules, which is the D. melanogaster temporal pattern of UO gene expression. These observations indicate that differences in the temporal patterns of regulation of UO genes among these three Drosophila species are not likely to be due to evolutionary changes in the sequence or complement of UO cis-acting regulatory elements. The species differences in UO regulation are probably the result of changes in one or more trans-acting factors required for UO gene expression in the third-instar larval and adult stages.\r"

  ".U": "91288491\r", 
  ".W": "The neural cell adhesion molecule, N-CAM, changes at the cell surface during development, from a highly sialylated form [polysialic acid (PSA)-linked N-CAM, PSA-N-CAM] to several isoforms containing less sialic acid. N-CAM and its polysialic acid may serve to regulate cell apposition, thus affecting a variety of cell interactions. In the nervous system, PSA-N-CAM has until now been localized in developing tissues where it is thought to participate in the structuring of neuronal groups and tissue pattern formation. It has been proposed, however, that PSA-N-CAM may also be expressed in the adult, where it may take part in plasticity and cell reshaping. In the present study, the use of immunoblot and immunocytochemical procedures with a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes PSA-N-CAM revealed that the adult rat hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system, which undergoes important neuronal-glial and synaptic rearrangements in response to physiological stimuli, contains high levels of PSA-N-CAM immunoreactivity. The use of a polyclonal serum reacting with all N-CAM isoforms indicated that PSA-N-CAM is expressed together with \"adult\" forms of N-CAM. Light and electron microscopy demonstrated the presence of PSA-N-CAM immunoreactivity in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus and in the neurohypophysis; the immunoreactivity was seen in dendrites, axons, and terminals and in associated astrocytes but not in neuronal somata. We propose that the continued expression of PSA-N-CAM confers to magnocellular neurons and their astrocytes the ability to reversibly change their morphology in adulthood. In addition, our observations suggest that evidence for polysialylation may serve to identify other neuronal systems capable of morphological plasticity in the adult central nervous system.\r"

The ensuing reaction was monitored by collection of sequential, single-exposure Laue x-ray diffraction patterns. The experiment was also performed in solution to verify the regeneration of catalytic activity and the subsequent inhibition of the enzyme by pyrone after photolysis. The resulting crystallographic structures show the presence of covalently bound cinnamate prior to photolysis, the generation of \"free\" enzyme after irradiation of the crystal, and the slow formation of a pyrone-inhibited complex several hours after photolysis. The structure of the free enzyme shows a significant proportion of the active sites in the crystal to contain a naturally occurring, noncovalently bound tetrapeptide inhibitor [Dixon, M.M. & Matthews, B.W. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 7033-7038], even after cinnamate acylation and photolysis. Data collected simultaneously with irradiation show the crystal to be slightly disordered during photolysis, leading to streaked x-ray photos. The resulting maps are suggestive of a bicyclic coumarin species produced by photolysis and deacylation; however, the electron density is difficult to model unambiguously by one unique chemical state. Nevertheless, Laue crystallography is shown to be capable of visualizing time-dependent chemical changes in the active site of an enzyme.\r"

These responses are T-cell-dependent and associated with rapid expulsion of parasitic worms from a sensitized host; existing experimental systems have failed to define the precise role of cytokines in these responses. We report here that anti-interleukin 4 or anti-interleukin 4 receptor antibodies block the polyclonal IgE response to a parasitic nematode, Heligmosomoides polygyrus, and abrogate protective immunity to the infection. In contrast, anti-interleukin 5 antibody prevented H. polygyrus-induced eosinophilia but did not prevent protection. These data provide evidence that a specific cytokine affects the physiology and survival of a parasitic nematode in the host.\r"

The impact of errors on the information content of molecular sequence data is dependent on the analytic paradigm used to interpret the data. We studied the impact of nucleic acid sequence errors on the ability to align predicted amino acid sequences with the sequences of related proteins. We found that with a simultaneous translation and alignment algorithm, identification of sequence homologies is resilient to the introduction of random errors. Proteins with greater than 30% sequence identity can be reliably recognized even in the presence of 1% frameshifting (insertion or deletion) error rates and 5% base substitution rates. Incorporation of prior knowledge about the location and characteristics of errors improves tolerance to error of amino acid sequence alignments. Similarly, inclusion of prior knowledge of biased codon utilization by yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) allows reliable detection of correct reading frames in yeast sequences even in the presence of 5% substitution and 1% frameshift errors.\r"

Each of five HPV-positive cervical cancer cell lines expressed normal pRB and low levels of wild-type p53 proteins, which are presumed to be altered in function as a consequence of association with HPV E7 and E6 oncoproteins, respectively. In contrast, mutations were identified in the p53 and RB genes expressed in the C-33A and HT-3 cervical cancer cell lines, which lack HPV DNA sequences. Mutations in the p53 genes mapped to codon 273 and codon 245 in the C33-A and HT-3 cell lines, respectively, located in the highly conserved regions of p53, where mutations appear in a variety of human cancers. Mutations in RB occurred at splice junctions, resulting in in-frame deletions, affecting exons 13 and 20 in the HT-3 and C-33A cell lines, respectively. These mutations resulted in aberrant proteins that were not phosphorylated and were unable to complex with the adenovirus E1A oncoprotein. These results support the hypothesis that the inactivation of the normal functions of the tumor-suppressor proteins pRB and p53 are important steps in human cervical carcinogenesis, either by mutation or from complex formation with the HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins.\r"

Neonatal thymectomy doubles the life span of scurfy mice, moderates the histologic lesions, and prevents anemia, despite the continued presence of high levels of serum IgG. Animals bred to be nude and scurfy (nu/nu; sf/Y) are viable, fertile, and free of scurfy lesions. Bone marrow from scurfy mice can reconstitute lethally irradiated, H-2-compatible animals but does not transmit scurfy disease.

The N-terminal 25-amino acid sequence of immunoaffinity-purified MHV receptor was identical to the predicted mature N termini of two mouse genes related to human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and was strongly homologous to the N termini of members of the CEA family in humans and rats. Polyclonal antibodies to human CEA recognized the immunoaffinity-purified MHV receptor and the MHV receptor in liver membranes and intestinal brush border membranes from MHV-susceptible mouse strains. In membranes from MHV-resistant SJL/J mice, the anti-CEA antibodies recognized a homologous glycoprotein that failed to bind MHV. The MHV receptor glycoprotein was detected in membranes of BALB/c colon, small intestine, and liver, which are the principal targets for MHV replication in vivo. The MHV receptor glycoprotein resembled members of the human CEA family in molecular weight, acidic pI, extensive glycosylation, solubility in perchloric acid, and tissue distribution. Thus, the MHV receptor is, to our knowledge, the first member of the CEA family of glycoproteins to be identified as a virus receptor.\r"

First, a synthetic Sendai virus-like RNA, containing the antisense coding region of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene replacing the coding region of the Sendai virus genome, was transcribed from a cDNA. When introduced into cells that are infected with Sendai virus, this RNA construct was transcribed, replicated, and packaged into infectious virions. The addition of infected cell extract to the RNA prior to transfection markedly enhanced levels of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression and rescue. However, this enhancement is not due to encapsidation of the RNA into nucleocapsids as the RNA remains nuclease-sensitive. Uninfected cell extract also enhances expression and rescue efficiency, implying involvement of a cellular factor(s) with the synthetic viral-like RNA construct that allows for enhanced polymerase recognition. This system should allow for the dissection of the various cis-acting RNA signals within the paramyxovirus genome.\r"

Some rigid bishydroxamic acids with benzene rings in the spacers are even more active toward murine erythroleukemia cells but show curious biological differences. In contrast to the flexible molecules, those with benzene spacers show poor activity toward HL-60 cells; they also have different geometric requirements, and they are not additive with hexamethylenebisacetamide in their effect. It is likely that rigid bishydroxamic acids, with a benzene ring spacer, induce differentiation by a different mechanism in spite of their chemical resemblance to the flexible bisamide and bishydroxamic acid inducers.\r"

Thus, a synthetic protease lacking cysteine residues was not inhibited by exposure to copper.

Oxygen was not required for inactivation of either the wild-type or the synthetic protease. These results provide the basis for the design of novel types of protease inhibitors.\r"

The proportion of enzyme species in which both active sites are detached from the microtubule (denoted as \"both detached\"), numerically calculated from the model, appears to be proportional to experimental observations of flagellar beat frequency. This correlation between beat frequency and the both-detached enzyme species is maintained over a wide range of substrate concentrations and exhibited an apparent positive cooperativity at low substrate concentrations, which we call \"obligate cooperativity.\" The unusual obligate cooperativity exhibited by flagellar beat frequency parallels that seen in the calculated proportion of the both-detached enzyme species and is interpreted as a requirement for a molecule of substrate to bind to each active site in a multimeric dynein in order to produce oscillatory motion. Furthermore, the proportion of the both-detached enzyme species correlates with experimentally observed changes in beat frequency with a nucleotide analog and with product inhibition.\r"

We have found, however, that the natural endocytosis pathway for the vitamin folate can be exploited to nondestructively introduce macromolecules into cultured cells if the macromolecule is first covalently linked to folate. Thus, treatment of KB cells with folate-conjugated ribonuclease, horseradish peroxidase, serum albumin, IgG, or ferritin allowed delivery of greater than 10(6) copies of the macromolecules within a 2-hr period. Cytochemical staining using 4-chloro-1-naphthol further demonstrated that the horseradish peroxidase retained activity for at least 6 hr after internalization. Since folate is an essential vitamin required in substantial quantities by virtually all cells, these observations may open the possibility of scientific and medical applications for many of the above macromolecules.\r"

The known enzymatic activities of bovine P45017 alpha can be reconstituted by addition of purified rat liver NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase to isolated E. coli membrane fractions containing the recombinant P45017 alpha enzyme. Surprisingly, it is found that E. coli contain an electron-transport system that can substitute for the mammalian microsomal NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase in supporting both the 17 alpha-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities of P45017 alpha. Thus, not only can E. coli express this eukaryotic membrane protein at relatively high levels, but as evidenced by metabolism of steroids added directly to the cells, the enzyme is catalytically active in vivo. These studies establish E. coli as an efficacious heterologous expression system for structure-function analysis of the cytochrome P450 system.\r"

Psoralen was attached via its C-5 position to a 5'-thiophosphate group of an 11-mer homopyrimidine oligonucleotide. The 11-mer binds to an 11-base-pair homopurine.homopyrimidine sequence of a DNA fragment, where it forms a triple helix. Upon near-UV-irradiation, the two strands of DNA are crosslinked at the TpA step present at the triplex-duplex junction. The reaction is specific for the homopurine.homopyrimidine DNA sequence and requires both oligonucleotide recognition of the DNA major groove and intercalation of psoralen at the triplex-duplex junction. The yield of the photo-induced cross-linking reaction is quite high (greater than 80%). Such psoralen-oligonucleotide conjugates are probes of sequence-specific triple-helix formation and could be used to selectively control gene expression or to induce site-directed mutations.\r"

Newborn mice homozygous for deletions at and around the albino locus on chromosome 7 fail to develop this competence for hormone-inducible gene expression even through they do show normal constitutive expression of the same genes. Studies of the glucocorticoid hormone signal transduction pathway reported here show identical expression of glucocorticoid receptor mRNA and protein in deletion homozygotes and normal littermates. Furthermore, the receptor interacts normally with the 90-kDa heat shock protein hsp90. Elevated glucocorticoid hormone levels in newborn deletion homozygotes, most likely resulting from their stressed condition, provide an explanation for the reduced binding activities of receptors reported previously. The elimination of receptors and hormones as direct targets of the chromosomal deletion effects suggests that the failure of inducible gene expression might reside in defective competence of the affected structural genes to respond to the hormonal stimulus.\r"

The effects of exogenous ganglioside GM1 on multiple protein kinase activities were assayed by analyzing site-specific serine phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TyrOHase) by two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping. In the presence of NGF, exogenous GM1 (1-10 microM) increased 32P incorporation into TyrOHase phosphopeptide T2, a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase substrate whose phosphorylation is not normally affected by NGF treatment. In the absence of NGF, GM1 treatment had no significant effects on TyrOHase phosphorylation. The removal of extracellular Ca2+ or blockade of dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels prevented the GM1-induced increases in 32P incorporation into phosphopeptide T2. Exogenous GM1 also potentiated K+ depolarization-induced increases in the phosphorylation of TryOHase. These results suggest that the stimulatory effects of exogenous GM1 ganglioside on NGF actions may be due to its ability to potentiate a Ca(2+)-dependent signaling pathway.\r"

The rbA-126 cDNA encodes a 2212-amino acid protein that shares 33% sequence identity with the alpha 1 subunits of cardiac and skeletal muscle dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca channels. When compared with other Ca channels, the rbA channel is notably different in both the carboxyl terminus and in a large (474-amino acid) hydrophilic segment between domains II and III. Northern blot analysis shows that rbA transcripts are expressed in all regions of the rat central nervous system, but most prominently in the cerebellum. A more widespread distribution of rbA Ca channels is indicated by PCR analysis, which demonstrates the presence of class A transcripts in the rat heart and pituitary but not in the spleen, kidney, or liver. The rbA cDNA appears to encode a Ca channel alpha 1 subunit that is distinct from the dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca channel sequences and that is expressed in a variety of excitable cells.\r"

We have previously characterized a guanylyltransferase activity from T. cruzi nuclear extracts and shown that this capping activity has an unusual ATP dependence and an apparent specificity for the SL-RNA and U-RNAs. Herein, we show that the capping activity sediments as a 12-15S particle during velocity sedimentation in glycerol gradients and fractionates as a greater than 150-kDa particle during large-pore gel filtration chromatography. Moreover, the endogenous substrate RNAs--the SL-RNA and U-RNAs--consistently copurify with the capping activity, suggesting that the activity and the substrates form a ribonucleoprotein particle. The capping activity and substrate RNAs are not dissociated in isopycnic Cs2SO4 gradients and band at a density expected for an RNA-protein complex, confirming the existence of ribonucleoprotein particles bearing both the activity and its substrate RNAs. Finally, we partially purified these ribonucleoprotein particles and showed that the capping activity remains ATP dependent and highly specific for the SL-RNA and the U-RNAs. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that one of the functions of trans-splicing is for mRNA capping.\r"

This indicated that the phenotype of limited proliferation (cellular senescence) is dominant and that immortal cells result from recessive changes in normal growth-regulatory genes. In additional studies, we exploited the fact that the immortal phenotype is recessive and, by fusing various immortal human cell lines with each other, identified four complementation groups for indefinite division. Assignment of cell lines to specific groups allowed us to take a focused approach to identify the chromosomes and genes involved in growth regulation that have been modified in immortal cells. We report here that introduction of a normal human chromosome 4 into three immortal cell lines (HeLa, J82, T98G) assigned to complementation group B resulted in loss of proliferation and reversal of the immortal phenotype. No effect on the proliferation potential of cell lines representative of the other complementation groups was observed. This result suggests that a gene(s) involved in cellular senescence and normal growth regulation resides on chromosome 4.\r"

Maturation of the immune system is accompanied by a decreased expression of VH7183 genes in the peripheral immunocompetent B-cell pool of adult animals. By comparing VH gene family expression in the bone marrow (emergent) and peripheral (available and actual) B-cell repertoires of germ-free and conventionally raised BALB/c mice, we found that peripheral selection of VH gene family utilization does not occur in germ-free animals. Reconstitution of germ-free mice with normal serum immunoglobulins purified from syngeneic donors reestablishes selection of VH7183-expressing B cells. Our results indicate that preimmune B-cell repertoires are selected in normal animals by environmental antigens and serum immunoglobulins.\r"

This peptide, corresponding to amino acid residues 503-535 (peptide 503-535) of HIV-1 IIIB gp160, induced antibodies in three mammalian species that interacted with HIV-1 gp120 and inhibited in vitro syncytium formation caused by HIV-1, IIIB and MN isolates.

These anti-idiotypes recognize an interspecies cross-reactive idiotype expressed on mouse, chimpanzee, baboon, rabbit, and human anti-gp120 antibodies specific for peptide 503-535. The interaction with the cross-reactive idiotype is inhibited by synthetic peptide and HIV-1 gp160.

  ".U": "91288522\r", 
  ".W": "Nerve growth factor (NGF) promotes the survival and differentiation of specific populations of neurons. The molecular mechanisms by which cells respond to NGF are poorly understood, but two clues have emerged recently. First, NGF rapidly stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of several unidentified proteins in the NGF-responsive pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 [Maher, P. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 6788-6791]. Second, the protein-tyrosine kinase encoded by the protooncogene trk (p140trk), a member of the receptor class of tyrosine kinases, becomes activated and phosphorylated on tyrosine after NGF treatment of PC12 cells [Kaplan, D. R., Martin-Zanca, D. & Parada, L. F. (1991) Nature (London) 350, 158-160]. We now report that NGF rapidly induces tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC-gamma 1), and we present evidence that the responsible tyrosine kinase is either p140trk or a closely associated protein. Treatment of responsive cells with NGF elicited phosphorylation of PLC-gamma 1 on tyrosine and serine. PLC-gamma 1 immunoprecipitated from NGF-stimulated cells was phosphorylated in vitro by coprecipitating protein kinase activity, and the phosphorylations occurred principally on tyrosine. The responsible kinase could be depleted from cellular lysates by antibodies specific for p140trk. This procedure also depleted a 140-kDa protein that normally coprecipitated with PLC-gamma 1 and became phosphorylated on tyrosine in vivo in response to NGF. Analysis of tryptic peptides from PLC-gamma 1 indicated that the residues phosphorylated in vitro by p140trk-associated kinase activity were largely congruent with those phosphorylated in vivo after NGF treatment. Our findings identify PLC-gamma 1 as a likely substrate for the trk-encoded tyrosine kinase, and they provide a link between NGF-dependent activation of p140trk and the stimulation of intracellular second messenger pathways.\r"

The protein contains an 18-amino acid hydrophobic signal sequence and has a calculated mass of 37.6 kDa in the mature form. The predicted protein reveals an internal duplication of a 154-amino acid domain (51% identity). Both domains have significant sequence homology to other primitive hemoglobins, in agreement with a duplication event. Hydrophobicity plots reveal identical strongly hydrophobic regions in each domain, which are potential heme binding sites. This confirms previous suggestions that nematode hemoglobins can have two heme groups per molecule. In addition, each domain contains several conserved histidine motifs that may serve as potential copper binding sites. This result provides further evidence that hemoglobins may have evolved from a primitive cytochrome-like molecule.\r"

The proteins studied, calf gamma IIIa-, gamma IIIb-, and gamma IVa-crystallin, have very similar amino acid sequences and three-dimensional structures. Both ascending and descending limbs of the coexistence curves were measured. We find that the coexistence curves for each of these proteins and for gamma II-crystallin can be fit, near the critical point, to the function /(Cc-C)/Cc/ = A [(Tc - T)/Tc]beta, where beta = 0.325, Cc is the critical protein concentration in mg/ml, Tc is the critical temperature for phase separation in K, and A is a parameter that characterizes the width of the coexistence curve. We find that A and Cc are approximately the same for all four coexistence curves (A = 2.6 +/- 0.1, Cc = 289 +/- 20 mg/ml), but that Tc is not the same. For gamma II- and gamma IIIb-crystallin, Tc approximately 5 degrees C, whereas for gamma IIIa- and gamma IVa-crystallin, Tc approximately 38 degrees C. By comparing the published protein sequences for calf, rat, and human gamma-crystallins, we postulate that a few key amino acid residues account for the division of gamma-crystallins into low-Tc and high-Tc groups.\r"

Specifically, we have studied binding of human transcription factor Sp1 to 10-base-pair G+C-rich elements (\"GC boxes\") located at -100 and +1700 relative to the RNA start site. It was previously observed that the distantly located site functions in synergism with the promoter-proximal site to strongly activate transcription in vivo. Here we demonstrate that this synergism is likely to be a direct consequence of interactions between remote and local Sp1, the remote Sp1 translocated to the promoter by a DNA loop. Scanning transmission electron microscopy shows that Sp1 initially forms a tetramer and subsequently assembles multiple tetramers stacked in register at the DNA loop juncture. This unexpected finding not only provides the physical basis for loop formation but also defines a biological process leading to strongly increased concentration of activator protein at the promoter. The mechanism may unify the problem of transcriptional activation by removing enhancer action as a separate class of regulatory activity.\r"

Here we identify by site-directed mutagenesis a 12-amino acid subdomain of the myogenin basic region essential for binding of DNA and activation of myogenesis. The basic region of the widely expressed helix-loop-helix protein E12 is conserved at 8 of these 12 residues and can mediate DNA binding when placed in myogenin, but it cannot activate myogenesis. Replacement of each of the four nonconserved residues of the myogenin basic region with the corresponding residues of E12 reveals two adjacent amino acids (Ala86-Thr) that can impart muscle specificity to the basic region. These residues are specific to, and conserved in, the basic regions of all known myogenic helix-loop-helix proteins from Drosophila to man, suggesting that they constitute part of an ancient protein motif required for activation of the myogenic program.\r"

The results we have obtained indicate that as much as 1 mg of cellular protein can be loaded onto a single IPG gel without loss of resolution. Mutant polypeptides previously detected in carrier ampholyte-based 2D gels were equally detectable in IPG-based 2D gels. With IPG gels several hundred cellular polypeptides can be isolated, from as few as 10 gels, in sufficient amount for sequencing with current sequencing technology. We therefore conclude that IPG greatly enhances the prospects for the large-scale sequencing of cellular proteins for the development of 2D gel-related protein data bases and for the identification of new polypeptide gene products, with the attendant implications for a genome sequencing effort.\r"

We hypothesized that differences in metabolism between fiber types could be detected noninvasively with 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy during maximal exercise. This assumes that during maximal exercise all fiber types are recruited and all vary in the amount of acidosis. The calf muscles of seven subjects were studied. Two different coils were applied: an 11-cm-diameter surface coil and a five-segment meander coil. The meander coil was used to localize the 31P signal to either the medial or the lateral gastrocnemius. Maximal exercise, consisting of rapid plantar flexions, resulted in an 83.7% +/- 7.8% decrease of the phosphocreatine pool and an 8-fold increase of the inorganic phosphate (Pi) pool. At rest the Pi pool was observed as a single resonance (pH 7.0). Toward the end of the first minute of exercise, three subjects showed three distinct Pi peaks. During the second minute of exercise the pH values stabilized at 7.12 +/- 0.12, 6.63 +/- 0.15, and 6.27 +/- 0.23. The same pattern was seen when the signal was collected from the medial or lateral gastrocnemius. In four subjects only two distinct Pi peaks were observed. The Pi peaks had differing relative areas in different subjects, but they were reproducible in each individual. This method allowed us to study the appearance and disappearance of the different Pi peaks, together with the changes in pH. Because multiple Pi peaks were seen in single muscles they most likely identify different muscle fiber types.\r"

  ".W": "Nutrients play a critical role in the decision to initiate a new cell cycle. Addition of nutrients to arrested cells such as stationary-phase cells and spores induces them to begin growth. We have analyzed the nutrients required to induce early cellular events in yeast. When stationary-phase cells or spores are incubated in the presence of only glucose, morphological and physiological changes characteristic of mitotically growing cells are induced and, in the absence of additional nutrients to support growth, the cells rapidly lose viability. Preincubation of stationary-phase cells in the presence of glucose decreases the time required to reach bud emergence upon the subsequent addition of rich medium. These processes are specifically induced by D-glucose and not by other components such as nitrogen source or L-glucose. The glucose-induced events are independent of the adenylate cyclase pathway, since strains with a temperature-sensitive mutation in either the adenylate cyclase gene (CDC35) or its regulator (CDC25) undergo glucose-induced cellular changes when incubated at the restrictive temperature. We suggest that glucose triggers events in the induction of a new mitotic cell cycle and that these events are either prior to the adenylate cyclase pathway or are in an alternative pathway.\r"

The domain was expressed in Escherichia coli and shown to bind specifically to a phorbol ester in the presence of calcium; diacylglycerol inhibited the binding in a competitive manner.

The binding of NS7 to a synthetic peptide corresponding to the phenylalanine hydroxylase sequence from residue 263 to residue 289 was blocked by the competitive inhibitor of phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme activity, 7,8-dihydro-6,7-dimethylpterin. In addition this peptide competed with native phenylalanine hydroxylase for binding to 6,7-dimethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin conjugated to a polyglutamate carrier. Application of this simple and direct approach to other enzymes is likely to greatly facilitate the identification of ligand binding sites on enzymes, which will significantly contribute to the understanding of enzyme structure-function relationships.\r"

  ".U": "91288540\r", 
  ".W": "In recent hypotheses on muscle contraction, myosin cross-bridges cycle between two types of actin-bound configuration. These two configurations differ greatly in the stability of their actin-myosin complexes (\"weak-binding\" vs. \"strong-binding\"), and force generation or movement is the result of structural changes associated with the transition from the weak-binding (preforce generating) configuration to strong-binding (force producing) configuration [cf. Eisenberg, E. & Hill, T. L. (1985) Science 227, 999-1006]. Specifically, in this concept, the main force-generating states are only accessible after initial cross-bridge attachment in a weak-binding configuration. It has been shown that strong and weak cross-bridge attachment can occur in muscle fibers [Brenner, B., Schoenberg, M., Chalovich, J. M., Greene, L. E. & Eisenberg, E. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 79, 7288-7291]. However, there has been no evidence that attachment in the weak-binding states represents an essential step leading to force generation. It is shown here that caldesmon can be used to selectively inhibit attachment of weak-binding cross-bridges in skeletal muscle. Such inhibition causes a parallel decrease in active force, while the kinetics of cross-bridge turnover are unchanged by this procedure. This suggests that (i) cross-bridge attachment in the weak-binding states is specific and (ii) force production can only occur after cross-bridges have first attached to actin in a weakly bound, nonforce-generating configuration.\r"

To determine whether the observed mutational strand specificity was due to bias in the phenotypic selection, we designed a nonsense-codon reversion assay in which a triple purine target was present on both strands and all R----T transversion mutations yielded amino acid substitutions that were compatible with dihydrofolate reductase enzyme activity. From the size of the targets, a 2:1 ratio of mutations at the purines on the nontranscribed strand was expected if the DNA strands were mutationally equivalent. We isolated a total of 66 BcPHDE-induced revertants of two mutants that carry point mutations at either the 5' or the 3' end of the gene. All reversions at the 5' end arose by substitution on the nontranscribed strand; those at the 3' end showed a strand bias that favored this strand by 7:1. For both mutants, R----T transversions accounted for 88% of all the induced base changes. Thus, in this system, mutational strand bias is independent of the selection for phenotype. The results are consistent with the model of preferential repair of the transcribed strand as proposed by others. The involvement of RNA polymerase in the selective repair recruitment is discussed.\r"

Leukocyte populations were purified by the high-gradient magnetic cell sorting technique. In the human tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) gene segment between nucleotides 300 and 1150, the specific methylation profile in the DNA from human granulocytes and monocytes is maintained in three cases of myeloid leukemia. In one such case, all 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine residues have been replaced by cytidine. In a chronic lymphatic T-cell leukemia, all 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine residues have been substituted by cytidine. In normal B lymphocytes, in two cases of chronic lymphatic B-cell leukemias and two cases of non-Hodgkin lymphomas, all 5'-CG-3' sequences in this gene segment are devoid of methylation. In the TNF-beta gene, DNA methylation is decreased in several examples of acute or chronic myeloid leukemias in comparison to normal human granulocytes or monocytes, whose DNA is almost completely methylated between nucleotides 700 and 900. In human T and B lymphocytes, the main producers of TNF-beta, in three instances of chronic lymphatic leukemias and two cases of non-Hodgkin lymphomas, all 5'-CG-3' sequences are unmethylated in this region. The DNA from the human HeLa cell line is highly methylated at all 5'-CG-3' sequences in the TNF-alpha and -beta genes. The TNF-alpha gene is transcribed in the cells of one case of acute myeloid leukemia in which the analyzed region of the TNF-alpha gene is completely unmethylated. The TNF-beta gene is not transcribed in any of the malignant cells tested.\r"

We compared fast-twitch oxidative glycolytic and slow-twitch oxidative fibers that displayed similar mitochondrial abundance (similar activities of mitochondrial marker enzymes). During short-term, but near maximum, aerobic exercise, fast-twitch oxidative glycolytic fibers displayed ATP turnover rates that were 2-4 times higher than for slow-twitch oxidative fibers (despite similar mitochondrial metabolic capacities), implying a large ATPase contribution to control of maximum metabolic rate. Fluxes through the ATP in equilibrium ADP + Pi cycle were extremely well regulated; at the lower limit, the forward flux exceeded the backward flux by only 0.06%, whereas at the upper limit, ATPase rates exceeded ATP synthesis rates by 0.12%. This very high precision of energy coupling could not be easily explained by standard metabolic regulation models.\r"

Under cultivation conditions, male Japanese eels (Anguilla japonica) have immature testes containing only premitotic spermatogonia, type A and early-type B spermatogonia. In the present study, a recently developed organ-culture system for eel testes was used to determine in vitro effects of various steroid hormones on spermatogenesis. After 9 days of culture in serum-free, chemically defined medium containing 11-ketotestosterone (10 ng/ml), a major androgen in male eels, type A and early-type B spermatogonia began mitosis, producing late-type B spermatogonia. After 18 days, zygotene spermatocytes with synaptonemal complexes appeared, indicating that meiosis had already started by this time. In testis fragments cultured for 21 days, round spermatids and spermatozoa were observed with spermatogenic cells at all stages of development. Addition of 11-ketotestosterone to the culture medium also caused a marked cytological activation of Sertoli cells. No other steroid hormones tested had such stimulatory effects. These results, together with our earlier observations, suggest the following sequence for the hormonal induction of spermatogenesis in eel testes; gonadotropin stimulates the Leydig cells to produce 11-ketotestosterone, which, in turn, activates the Sertoli cells leading to the completion of spermatogenesis. This is, thus, an example of an animal system in which all stages of spermatogenesis have been induced by hormonal manipulation in vitro.\r"

However, the presence of brain endothelial tight junctions allows for asymmetric distribution of BBB plasma membrane proteins. Glucose transporter isoform 1 (GLUT-1), the principal glucose transporter at the BBB, was assessed in rat brain in the present studies using immunogold electron microscopy. The distribution of the immunoreactive GLUT-1 protein on the endothelial lumenal membrane, the ablumenal membrane, and the cytoplasmic compartment was 12%, 48%, and 40%, respectively, and no significant immunolabeling of the neuropil was measurable. These studies suggest (i) that GLUT-1 is asymmetrically distributed on the BBB plasma membrane with an approximately 4-fold greater abundance on the ablumenal membrane as compared to the lumenal membrane; (ii) that approximately 40% of the endothelial glucose transporter protein is contained within the cytoplasmic space, which provides a mechanism for rapid up-regulation of the transporter by altered distribution of transporter between cytoplasmic and plasma membrane compartments; and (iii) that no significant labeling of neuropil is found with antisera directed against the GLUT-1 protein.

A combination of the polymerase chain reaction and cDNA library screening was used to determine the DNA sequence that encodes most of the remaining polypeptide sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence was confirmed by comparison with the peptide sequence from purified CaM kinase Gr. Analysis of this sequence indicated the presence of potential catalytic, regulatory, and association domains with 42% overall homology to the alpha subunit of another neuronal Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, CaM kinase II. The degree of homology within the catalytic domain was 58% with conservation of all invariant amino acids. The portion of sequence that extended from the hypothesized calmodulin-binding domain to the carboxyl terminus of the protein was identical at both the amino acid and nucleotide level to the noncatalytic, calmodulin-binding protein calspermin from rat testis. Screening a genomic library with a portion of the cDNA for CaM kinase Gr allowed the isolation of a genomic clone that contained at least 9 kilobases (kb) of the gene for CaM kinase Gr. Analysis of the sequence revealed that the coding sequences for calspermin were contained within the CaM kinase Gr gene and that alternative splicing of internal exons may lead to the formation of the two different proteins, CaM kinase Gr and calspermin.\r"

The mosxe protein has also been shown to be a component of cytostatic factor (CSF), which is responsible for arrest at metaphase of meiosis II. In this study, we have assayed the appearance of CSF activity in oocytes induced to mature either by progesterone treatment or by overexpression of mosxe. Progesterone-stimulated oocytes did not exhibit CSF activity until 30-60 min after germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD). Both the appearance of CSF activity and the progression from meiosis I to meiosis II were inhibited by microinjection of mosxe antisense oligonucleotides just prior to GVBD. These results demonstrate a translational requirement for mosxe, which is temporally distinct from the requirement for mosxe expression at the onset of meiotic maturation. In contrast to progesterone-treated oocytes, oocytes that were induced to mature by overexpression of mosxe exhibited CSF activity at least 3 hr prior to GVBD. Despite the early appearance of CSF, these oocytes were not arrested at meiosis I. These results indicate that, although CSF activity is capable of stabilizing maturation-promoting factor (MPF) at meiosis II and in cleaving embryos, it is incapable of stabilizing MPF prior to or at meiosis I. These studies show that the complex regulation of the cell cycle during meiosis differs significantly from the regulation of the cell cycle during mitosis.\r"

  ".W": "We have synthesized a peptide corresponding to the 25-residue signal sequence plus the first 28 residues of the Escherichia coli outer membrane protein LamB in order to explore the properties of a signal sequence in the presence of the N-terminal region of its passenger. In the last few years, there have been several observations of differing efficiencies of export when signal sequences are attached to different passenger proteins or when the first part of a passenger protein undergoes mutation. In the LamB case, gene fusions with lacZ have shown that the signal sequence plus the first 28 residues of mature LamB are necessary to direct beta-galactosidase into the export pathway [Rasmussen, B. A. & Silhavy, T. J. (1987) Genes Dev. 1, 185-196]. The origin of these observations and whether there is an influence of the mature region on the properties of the signal sequence have not been known. We find that the conformational and membrane-binding properties of the LamB signal sequence manifest in a 25-residue peptide are essentially unaltered in the context of the 53-residue peptide corresponding to this signal sequence plus the first 28 residues of the mature LamB protein. CD spectra show that the signal peptide and passenger domains are conformationally independent of each other in micelle or bilayer environments. Furthermore, the signal sequence leads to the spontaneous association of the 53-residue peptide with a lipid bilayer; alone, the mature domain does not interact with lipid bilayers. Fluorescence results show that the mode of interaction of the signal peptide with a bilayer is essentially unaltered by the presence of its mature region. This lack of influence of the mature domain on the behavior of the signal sequence is unexpected for juxtaposed polypeptides of comparable length and may be of physiological importance: N-terminal regions of secreted proteins may be selected to be passive, by comparison with their cognate signal sequences, which themselves must engage the export apparatus and actively interact with its components.\r"

  ".W": "We used Monte Carlo methods to treat statistical problem of electrostatic interactions among many titrating amino acids and applied these methods to lysozyme and the photosynthetic reaction center of Rhodobacter sphaeroides, including all titrating sites. We computed the average protonation of residues as a function of pH from an equilibrium distribution of states generated by random sampling. Electrostatic energies were calculated from a finite difference solution to the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation using the coordinates from solved protein structures. For most calculations we used the Metropolis algorithm to sample protonation states; for strongly coupled sites, we substantially reduced sampling errors by using a modified algorithm that allows multiple site transitions. The Monte Carlo method agreed with calculations for a small test system, lysozyme, for which the complete partition function was calculated. We also calculated the pH dependence of the free energy change associated with electron transfer from the primary to the secondary quinone in the photosynthetic reaction center. The shape of the resulting curve agreed fairly well with experiment, but the proton uptake from which the free energy was calculated agreed only to within a factor of two with the observed values. We believe that this discrepancy resulted from errors in the individual electrostatic energy calculations rather than from errors in the Monte Carlo sampling.\r"

Both GM-CSF-IL-3 and IL-3-GM-CSF fusion proteins were purified to homogeneity and shown to bind to cell-surface receptors through either their GM-CSF or IL-3 domains. The fusion proteins exhibited enhanced receptor affinity, proliferative activity, and hematopoietic colony-stimulating activity compared with either IL-3 and/or GM-CSF alone. This suggests that GM-CSF-IL-3 fusion proteins may hold future promise as therapeutic agents.\r"

  ".U": "91288553\r", 
  ".W": "CR1 is a short interspersed repetitive DNA element originally identified in the domestic chicken (Gallus gallus). However, unlike virtually all other such sequences described to date, CR1 is not confined to one or a few closely related species. It is probably a ubiquitous component of the avian genome, having been detected in representatives of nine orders encompassing a wide spectrum of the class Aves. This identification was made possible by using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which revealed interspecific similarities not detected by conventional Southern analysis. DNA sequence comparisons between a CR1 element isolated from a sarus crane (Grus antigone) and those isolated from an emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) showed that two short highly conserved regions are present. These are included within two regions previously characterized in the CR1 units of domestic fowl. One of these behaves as a transcriptional silencer and the other is a binding site for a nuclear protein. Our observations suggest that CR1 has evolved under functional constraints and that interspersed repetitive sequences as a class may constitute a more significant component of the eukaryotic genome than is generally acknowledged.\r"

We have purified VEGF 2083-fold to apparent homogeneity from protein-free culture medium conditioned by A-431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells. This A-431-derived VEGF was characterized as a homodimer composed of 22-kDa subunits with an N-terminal sequence that was similar to VEGFs produced by human HL-60 leukemic and U-937 histiocytic lymphoma cells. A-431 VEGF was used to identify specific and saturable binding sites for VEGF on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). By affinity cross-linking, VEGF-binding site complexes of 230, 170, and 125 kDa were detected on HUVEC. VEGF specifically induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of a 190-kDa polypeptide, which was similar in mass to the largest binding site detected by affinity cross-linking.\r"

The maximum rise appeared in the first few minutes; thereafter lactate concentration declined while stimulation continued.

A dynamic model of this system based on kinetic differential equations was built and simulated by computer. The system shows analogies to typical features of associative learning such as acquisition, contiguity detection, extinction, and memory decay, suggesting that these biochemical reactions may be part of the molecular mechanism of learning in Drosophila.\r"

  ".W": "Transgenic mice were produced in which expression of the reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) is controlled by regulatory elements of a rodent myosin light chain gene. CAT activity was readily detectable in muscles of these mice but negligible in a variety of nonmuscle tissues. Unexpectedly, levels of CAT expression varied greater than 100-fold from muscle to muscle, forming a gradient in which a muscle's position in the rostrocaudal axis was correlated with its level of CAT enzyme activity and abundance of CAT mRNA. Thus, rostral muscles (innervated by cranial nerves) had the lowest levels of CAT, thoracic muscles had intermediate levels, and caudal muscles (innervated through lumbar and sacral roots) had the highest levels. We established that myosin light chain sequences are responsible for the gradient of CAT expression but observed no strong gradient of endogenous myosin light chain expression. We argue that elements that are silent or masked by other sequences in their native context are revealed in the transgene and that the rostrocaudal gradient of gene expression they produce reveals the existence of a positionally graded endogenous regulator of gene expression. These transgenic mice provide evidence that cells in adult mammals retain \"positional information\" of a sort hitherto studied largely in embryos. The transgene they express may provide a means for determining how such positional values are generated and maintained.\r"

In addition, the 3.6-kb mRNA, which is present in normal fibroblasts, is barely detectable in the Alzheimer disease counterpart. The deficiency of the 2-5A synthetase 1.6-kb mRNA and its corresponding protein is not related to an impairment of interferon receptors but most probably represents an alteration in the expression of the 2-5A synthetase gene. The data have potential implications for the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease and demonstrate that the absence of a specific form of 2-5A synthetase is linked to a disease state.\r"

Apoptosis was suppressed in parallel cultures of intact follicles. gamma Radiation also triggered extensive apoptosis in embryonic bursal follicles within a few hours. Preneoplastic bursal stem cell populations induced by a v-myc oncogene were hypersensitive to induction of apoptosis by follicular dispersion and radiation. In contrast, tumor progression in v-myc- and v-rel-initiated bursal neoplasms was accompanied by development of resistance to induction of apoptosis. A programmed cell death pathway can be activated during normal B-cell development in the bursa, and alterations in the expression of this pathway accompany neoplastic change in this system.\r"

The in vitro kinase activity and the tyrosine phosphorylation of the high-affinity complex can be blocked by an agent that inhibits NGF (and not epidermal growth factor)-induced tyrosine phosphorylation in PC12 cells, as well as NGF-induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells. These observations suggest that the high-affinity NGF-receptor complex is a substrate of tyrosine kinase activity. Phosphorylation reactions by the complex, performed in the absence of added substrate, label a single phosphopeptide of 130-135 kDa. This observation suggests that this phosphopeptide may represent the phosphorylation of the receptor kinase or the phosphorylation of a coimmunoprecipitating substrate, and possible signal-transducing molecule, of the high-affinity NGF-receptor complex.\r"

Comparison of the single mutation rates with the double mutation rate and information obtained by sequencing DNA from double revertants show that neither our classical understanding of spontaneous mutation processes nor extant models for adaptive mutations can account for all of the observations. Despite a current lack of mechanistic understanding, it is clear that adaptive mutations can permit advantageous phenotypes that require multiple mutations to arise and that they appear enormously more frequently than would be expected.\r"

Synthetic peptides consisting of DRAHYNI linked to major B-cell epitopes on the E7 molecule formed immunogens capable of eliciting strong antibody responses to HPV-16 E7. The T epitope could provide help for the production of antibody to several B epitopes simultaneously, including a B epitope of HPV-18 E7 protein. Mice immunized with a peptide containing DRAHYNI and B epitope and, at a later date, infected with recombinant vaccinia E7 virus, displayed secondary antibody responses to E7.

Leucyl-tRNA labeling in liver and muscle suggested charging from extra- and intracellular pools: e.g., after infusing L-[1-13C,15N]leucine, rat muscle tissue free leucine 13C labeling (8.97 +/- 0.30 atom % excess) exceeded that by 15N (3.37 +/- 0.33 atom % excess), and both were significantly lower (P less than 0.02) than venous plasma (13C, 12.1 +/- 1.8; 15N, 5.54 +/- 0.6 atom % excess) indicating tracer dilution by transamination and by proteolysis; however, leucyl-tRNA labeling by either isotope (13C, 10.26 +/- 0.50; 15N, 4.72 +/- 0.72 atom % excess) was significantly above mixed tissue free leucine (P less than 0.05). Labeling of leucyl-tRNA in human erector spinae muscle (obtained after preoperative L-[1-13C]leucine infusion) was, at 4.98 +/- 0.43 atom % excess, lower (27%) than venous plasma leucine (P less than 0.05) and intermediate between muscle free leucine (9% lower; P less than 0.01) and venous alpha-ketoisocaproate (11% higher; P less than 0.02).

Sixteen positions have heterozygosities greater than 0.5 at one or both loci and the frequencies of amino acids at a given position are very even, resulting in nearly the maximum heterozygosity possible. Furthermore, the high heterozygosity is concentrated in the peptide-interacting sites, whereas the sites that interact with the T-cell receptor have lower heterozygosity. Overall, these results indicate the importance of some form of balancing selection operating at HLA loci, maybe even at the individual amino acid level.\r"

With few exceptions, pulse-chase experiments revealed that those proteins confined exclusively to the cell surface turned over slowly (t1/2, greater than 75 h), while those bimodally compartmentalized between the cell surface and the 20 degrees C accessible compartment were degraded more rapidly (t1/2, less than 31 h).

We show that multiple mutant phenotypes of immortalized AT cells from genetic complementation group D (AT-D) are corrected after the introduction of a single human chromosome from a human-mouse hybrid line by microcell-mediated chromosome transfer. This chromosome is cytogenetically abnormal. It consists primarily of human chromosome 18, but it carries translocated material from the region 11q22-23, where one or more AT genes have been previously mapped by linkage analysis. A cytogenetically normal human chromosome 18 does not complement AT-D cells after microcell-mediated transfer, whereas a normal human chromosome 11 does. We conclude that the AT-D gene is located on chromosome 11q22-23.\r"

We have analyzed restriction enzyme cleavage patterns of the DNAs of ES virus isolates from Japan and the United States. The patterns of all the ES viral DNAs were highly conserved, except for variable sequences within the terminal repeat sequences. They resembled closely the restriction enzyme patterns of the Z29 strain of HHV-6 but were distinct from those of the U1102 strain. That all ES isolates were closely related whereas the U1102 patterns were very different suggests that the U1102 strain represents a distinct virus. Moreover, the ES isolates all resembled the Z29 strain and not the U1102 strain with respect to reactivity with HHV-6 monoclonal antibodies. These findings provide evidence for the existence of two distinct classes of viruses previously classified as HHV-6. Whereas the Z29-like viruses are involved in ES infections, the association of the U1102-like viruses with human disease has yet to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "Phosphotyrosine cannot be detected on normal human ABL protein-tyrosine kinases, but activated oncogenic forms of the human ABL protein are phosphorylated on tyrosine in vivo. Activation of ABL can occur by substitution of the ABL first exon with breakpoint cluster region (BCR) sequences or by deletion of the noncatalytic SH3 (src homology region 3) domain. An alternative mode for the activation of the ABL kinases is hyperexpression at greater than 500-fold over endogenous levels. This is not a consequence of transphosphorylation of the hyperexpressed ABL molecules. ABL proteins translated in vitro lack phosphotyrosine, but tyrosine kinase activity is uncovered after immunoprecipitation and removal of lysate components. The rates of dephosphorylation of ABL and BCR-ABL fusion protein by phosphotyrosine-specific phosphatases are approximately the same. These combined results indicate that inhibition of ABL activity is reversible and suggest that a cellular component interacts noncovalently with ABL to inhibit its autophosphorylation.\r"

  ".U": "91288577\r", 
  ".W": "Friend murine leukemia virus is a replication-competent retrovirus that contains no oncogene and that exerts lytic and leukemogenic properties. Thus, newborn mice inoculated with Friend murine leukemia virus develop severe early hemolytic anemia before appearance of erythroleukemia. To identify the retroviral determinants regulating these effects, we used chimeric infectious constructions and site-directed point mutations between a virulent Friend murine leukemia virus strain and a naturally occurring variant attenuated in lytic and leukemogenic effects. We found that severe hemolytic anemia was always associated with higher numbers of blood reticulocytes with budding retroviral particles. Furthermore, a remarkably conservative leucine to isoleucine change in the extracellular SU component of the retroviral envelope was sufficient to attenuate this lytic effect. Also, this leucine at position 348 of the envelope precursor protein was located within the only stretch of five amino acids that is conserved in the extracellular SU component of all murine, feline, and primate type C and type D retroviral envelopes. This observation suggested an important structural function for this yet undescribed conserved sequence of the envelope. Lastly, we observed that lytic and leukemogenic effects were attenuated by a deletion of a second repeat in the transcriptional enhancer region of the viral long terminal repeats of the variant strain.\r"

The value of unenhanced CT essentially is limited to the demonstration of bony changes. In the evaluation of radiculopathy, either MR imaging or IvCECT is useful for the initial screening and may be the only study needed. MR imaging is the study of choice for diseases of the spinal cord. With continuing progress in MR capability, IntCECT is shifting more toward a supplemental or confirmatory role. A rigid neurodiagnostic algorithm for this common radiologic problem is not possible. Rather, each step of the diagnostic process is influenced by the individual patient. Specific patient characteristics may affect the selection of an imaging modality. Modification of routine studies, such as use of gadolinium or oblique MR imaging, may be indicated in some patients. Finally, because of the high prevalence of asymptomatic disc and spine changes, knowledge of clinical findings is essential in the accurate interpretation of anatomic findings.\r"

  ".W": "The use of MAP recording techniques has been said to have bridged the gap between basic in vitro investigation of the transmembrane action potential and observations made in situ from the beating heart. With regard to antiarrhythmic agents, MAP recordings are particularly useful in evaluating drugs which prolong repolarization. The simultaneous measurement of MAP and ERP at the same site permits the comparison of drug effects on repolarization and refractoriness. The ability to safely and reliably record the MAP contributes importantly to the evaluation and classification of antiarrhythmic drug effects in vivo and may ultimately lead to more rational selection of drug therapy for individual patients. Antiarrhythmic drug effects demonstrated with MAP recordings have generally shown good agreement with the Vaughan Williams classification of electrophysiological actions. An important key to drug efficacy may be that some drugs prolong refractoriness beyond their effect on repolarization. Conversely, a potential explanation for proarrhythmia may lie in slowing of conduction without the concomitant protective effect of postrepolarization refractoriness. The phenomenon of use dependence, which has been demonstrated for many drugs, suggests why an agent that prevents induction of arrhythmia during programmed stimulation in the electrophysiology laboratory may not prevent spontaneous arrhythmia initiation at slower heart rates. The paramount task of clinical electrophysiology is the successful treatment of rhythm disturbances. The more detailed and quantitative evaluation of drug effects afforded by MAP recordings may ultimately result in the more effective use of antiarrhythmic drugs in general and to more precise tailoring of therapy for individual patients.\r"

VSD was closed via the left ventricular apex in seven cases, without increased morbidity or mortality. The three early and six late deaths occurred in patients with complicated defects. Pulmonary vascular occlusive disease caused four deaths (1 early, 3 late). At follow-up (mean c. 3, range 1-11 years), 79% of the patients were well, 10% had cardiac symptoms and 7.5% had symptoms from associated noncardiac anomalies. Reoperation for significant residual VSD was required in 12 cases (4 single and 8 multiple VSD). Complete, pacemaker-requiring A-V block was found in four patients (none with simple VSD closure). It is concluded that 1) concomitant cardiac and non-cardiac lesions are common in VSD, 2) mortality is closely related to such lesions and to pulmonary vascular occlusive disease, 3) the latter is a rare, but real cause of death, 4) left ventricular approach need not increase mortality or morbidity, 5) significant residual VSD is rare after single, but common in multiple VSD, and 6) risk of complete A-V block after simple VSD closure is very low.\r"

We report a systemic, simple and inexpensive blood conservation program used for 121 consecutive patients who underwent elective coronary artery bypass surgery without need for homologous blood transfusion. The left internal mammary artery was grafted in all cases, in addition to saphenous vein grafts. Autologous, heparinized blood was removed intraoperatively, pre-bypass, and returned to the patient at conclusion of the extracorporeal circulation. The volume remaining in the oxygenator and the tubing set was returned without cell processing or hemofiltration. Using the hard-shell cardiotomy reservoir from the heart-lung machine, autotransfusion of the shed mediastinal blood was continued hourly up to 18 hours after surgery. The mean postoperative mediastinal bleeding was 551 +/- 206 ml, of which 505 +/- 218 ml was autotransfused. No re-exploration for bleeding was required and no homologous red-cell transfusions were given. Five patients each received 1-2 units of fresh frozen plasma because of prolonged bleeding time. Morbidity was low and mortality nil. At discharge the mean hemoglobin was 12.0 +/- 1.4 g/dl and the hematocrit 36.0 +/- 4.2%.\r"

  ".W": "The cardiovascular effects of protamine were studied in 19 men with normal left ventricular function undergoing primary myocardial revascularization. Protamine was given over 120 sec after termination of cardiopulmonary bypass. Arterial and pulmonary pressures, aortic blood flow, central venous pressure, heart rate and electrocardiogram were continuously registered. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was recorded at the times of maximal hemodynamic response. The systolic arterial pressure fell from 116 to 66 mmHg about 60 sec after the start of protamine infusion, but spontaneously began to rise after a few seconds, reaching 90% of pre-protamine levels at 126 sec. No inotropic drugs or volume infusion were given. At about 2 min, the mean pulmonary artery pressure rose from 16.3 to 26.2 mmHg and the central venous pressure from 7.0 to 11.4 mmHg. The heart rate and cardiac output were almost unchanged throughout. Systemic hypotension and pulmonary hypertension are suggested to represent true side effects of protamine or protamine/heparin complex. When left ventricular function is good, the hypotension reverses without treatment. Volume infusion may indeed precipitate right heart failure when the pre-load effect is added to the subsequent protamine-induced pulmonary hypertension.\r"

Aortic dilatation can appear years after coarctation repair, irrespective of the operative technique and its success, and can lead to death from aortic dissection or rupture of an aortic aneurysm. Careful follow-up after coarctation repair in adulthood is advisable to detect late aortic complications.\r"

The early (less than 30-day) mortality was 4.6% in the AVR, and 5.9% in the AVR + CABG group. Multivariate analysis showed coronary artery stenoses and NYHA functional class to be independent predictors of early mortality in the AVR group, and the number of distal anastomoses as the strongest predictor in AVR + CABG. The incidence of peroperative technical complications in the cases with fatal outcome was 27% in the AVR and 6% in the AVR + CABG group. The incidence of myocardial injury (new Q wave or evidence of increased enzyme leakage) was 11% in AVR and 21% in AVR + CABG. Independent predictors of postoperative myocardial injury were aortic cross-clamp time, year of surgery, coronary artery stenoses and NYHA class in AVR and aortic cross-clamp time and year of surgery in AVR + CABG. The study suggests that coronary artery disease increases risk in aortic valve replacement with or without CABG. Replacement should be undertaken before endstage of the disease (NYHA IV), with CABG if significant coronary disease is present, and in multivessel disease the number of distal anastomoses should be restricted in order to shorten aortic cross-clamp time.\r"

There were 16 deaths within 30 days, and coronary artery disease (unbypassed in all but 1 case) was found in 11 of the 13 with autopsy or preoperative arteriography. None of the 12 patients without significant coronary artery disease at angiography died perioperatively,but one of 12 with combined valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting died. Cumulative 1-year survival among the 101 patients/the 85 survivors of the first 30 days and/a normal population matched for sex, age and year of operation was 75/90/96%. Corresponding percentages for 5 years were 64/75/77, for 10 years 43/52/52, and for 15 years 35/42/27. Advanced disease with kidney failure or left ventricular end-diastolic pressure greater than 20 mmHg independently increased the overall mortality rate. The linearized rat of cerebral events (haemorrhage, embolism) was 2.7/100 patient years (age-specific background rate 1.6-1.9/100 patient years). The 30-day mortality among septuagenarians was reduced to 3% in 1988-1989 by routine revascularization in significant coronary artery disease. The patients who survived the first 30 days had normal life expectancy. Early operation may further improve the results.\r"

Their ST-VM was higher than the average in patients without myocardial infarction, while QRS-VD did not differ from the average pattern. Twelve other patients were studied in pacemaker-induced moderate tachycardia. QRS-VD increased in proportion to heart-rate changes (rs median = 0.93, p less than 0.01). QRS-VD also correlated with myocardial oxygen uptake (rs median = 0.62, p less than 0.05). The ST-VM responses were not uniform. The data suggest that vectorcardiogram variables can provide information related to myocardial energy metabolism.\r"

Of the 17 transplant biopsies (taken 5-95 weeks postoperatively), only two showed histologic signs of chronic rejection: They were excluded from the group analysis. A higher proportion of the M subunit of lactate dehydrogenase (M%) was found in the transplanted and the chronically failing hearts than in the normal hearts, presumably reflecting increased myocardial anaerobic glycolytic stress. In the early post-transplantation period, M% was higher in the transplanted than in the chronically failing hearts. Thereafter M% gradually fell, but had not reached normal levels 1-2 years after transplantation. During that time it was similar to the values in the chronic-failure hearts. In the two biopsies with chronic rejection, M% was nearly twice as high as in contemporaneous biopsies showing mild or no rejection. Monitoring of enzymatic adaptation from endomyocardial biopsies may be of clinical interest.\r"

Gastric intramucosal pH declined progressively during the first 3 hours in the intensive care unit, reached its minimum at 5 hours and thereafter slowly increased. The peripheral vascular bed was shut down on admission to the ICU, as indicated by low values of PscO2, PtcO2, PtCO2 index, RCF and Tft. These parameters began to rise after the next 2-4 hours and peaked by the end of the 8-hour study period, indicating complete opening of the peripheral vascular bed.\r"

The observed postoperative improvement in functional NYHA capacity and physical performance was not related to significant change in any systolic or diastolic variable of global LV function. 'Nonspecific postoperative septal hypokinesia' developed in most cases. The regional ejection fraction showed slight (nonsignificant) mean increase in the infarcted apex and low anterior wall supplied by the left anterior descending artery, but marked increase in the noninfarcted lateral wall supplied by the left circumflex branch. Hearts with grafted left circumflex artery showed on average lower preoperative and postoperative ejection fraction in the lateral wall than did hearts without such grafting, but the rise in regional ejection fraction was significant only after left circumflex grafting. The clinical response to coronary artery surgery is attributed mainly to functional improvement of non-infarcted myocardium. Revascularization of viable myocardium occurs directly via bypass grafts, but collateral vessels may also contribute.\r"

The preoperative scores with both methods indicated permanent myocardial perfusion defects in all 21 patients and reversible defects, indicating myocardial ischemia, in 16 with Q1 and 14 with Q3. After bypass grafting there was overall reduction of myocardial perfusion defect and of abnormality scores: Notably, 13/21 patients (62%) had decreased permanent myocardial defect score, reflecting reactivation of 'hibernating myocardium'. The findings indicated that obstructed but graftable vessels supplying myocardium with loss of contractile function should be bypassed, since flow contribution to distant, viable myocardium is probable via preserved collateral circulation. This should be particularly relevant for the LAD, because of that artery's septal branches.\r"

To achieve such constancy, the body has a network of pressure control systems. Several are based on neural receptors that respond within seconds to help correct any abnormal pressure. The activities of these systems are followed within minutes by activation of hormonal controllers. Within hours or days, a kidney pressure control system is induced that increases body fluid volume when the pressure falls (or decreases the volume when the pressure rises). This kidney-fluid system is the dominant method of establishing long-term pressure control.\r"

The three-dimensional structure of the LDL receptor-binding domain of apoE has been determined at 2.5 angstrom resolution by x-ray crystallography. The protein forms an unusually elongated (65 angstroms) four-helix bundle, with the helices apparently stabilized by a tightly packed hydrophobic core that includes leucine zipper-type interactions and by numerous salt bridges on the mostly charged surface. Basic amino acids important for LDL receptor binding are clustered into a surface patch on one long helix. This structure provides the basis for understanding the behavior of naturally occurring mutants that can lead to atherosclerosis.\r"

Exons 6A and 6B are spliced in a mutually exclusive manner; exon 6B was included in skeletal muscle, whereas exon 6A was preferred in all other tissues. The distal portion of the intron upstream of exon 6B was shown to form stable double-stranded regions with part of the intron downstream of exon 6B and with sequences in exon 6B. This structure repressed splicing of exon 6B to exon 7 in a HeLa cell extract. Derepression of splicing occurred on disruption of this structure and repression followed when the structure was re-formed, even if the structure was formed between two different RNA molecules. Repression leads to inhibition of formation of spliceosomes. Disrupting either of the two double-stranded regions could lead to derepression, whereas re-forming the helices by suppressor mutations reestablished repression. These results support a simple model of tissue-specific splicing in this region of the pre-mRNA.\r"

These binding sites were localized by receptor autoradiography in the neuropil, outside the regions of perikarya. The affinities of corticoids for this [3H]corticosterone binding site were linearly related to their potencies in rapidly suppressing male reproductive behavior. Thus, it appears that brain membranes contain a corticosteroid receptor that could participate in the regulation of behavior.\r"

The utilization of heteroatom-containing analogs of myristate was studied both in a cell-free system and in vivo. Results indicated that the specificity of fatty acid incorporation depends on chain length rather than on hydrophobicity. One analog, 10-(propoxy)decanoic acid, was highly toxic to trypanosomes in culture although it is nontoxic to mammalian cells.\r"

These methods were applied to an identified movement-sensitive neuron in the fly visual system. Such decoding experiments determined the effective noise level and fault tolerance of neural computation, and the structure of the decoding algorithms suggested a simple model for real-time analog signal processing with spiking neurons.\r"

However, after extensive long-term deafferentations in adult primates, changes in cortical maps were found to be an order of magnitude greater than those previously described. These results show the need for a reevaluation of both the upper limit of cortical reorganization in adult primates and the mechanisms responsible for it.\r"

Statistical estimates of historical infection rates can be obtained from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) incidence data and the incubation period. However, this approach is subject to a number of sources of uncertainty and two other approaches, epidemic models of HIV transmission and surveys of HIV prevalence, are used to corroborate and refine the statistical estimates. Analyses suggest the HIV infection rate in the United States grew rapidly in the early 1980s, peaked in the mid-1980s, and subsequently declined markedly. Due both to the decline in the underlying infection rate and to the development of effective therapies that may delay AIDS diagnosis, overall AIDS incidence may plateau during the next 5 years. However, the number of individuals with advanced HIV disease without a diagnosis of AIDS who could potentially benefit from therapy is expected to increase 40% by 1995 as infected individuals progress to more advanced stages of HIV disease. Thus, although the overall HIV infection rate has declined, the demands on the U.S. health care system for treatment and care of HIV-infected individuals remain enormous.\r"

The suppressors alone increase the folding efficiency of the otherwise wild-type polypeptide chain without altering the stability or activity of the native state. These amino acid substitutions identify an unexpected aspect of the protein folding grammar--sequences within the chain that carry information inhibiting unproductive off-pathway conformations.

Identifying the receptors for these neurotrophic factors should aid in identifying the cells on which these factors act and in understanding their precise mechanisms of action. A \"tagged-ligand panning\" procedure was used to clone a receptor for ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). This receptor is expressed exclusively within the nervous system and skeletal muscle. The CNTF receptor has a structure unrelated to the receptors utilized by the nerve growth factor family of neurotrophic molecules, but instead is most homologous to the receptor for a cytokine, interleukin-6. This similarity suggestes that the CNTF receptor, like the interleukin-6 receptor, requires a second, signal-transducing component. In contrast to all known receptors, the CNTF receptor is anchored to cell membranes by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol linkage.\r"

Translocation of PRL into the nucleus occurs during IL-2--stimulated mitogenesis. Therefore, the function of intranuclear PRL in T cell proliferation was tested. Eukaryotic expression vectors were prepared to express wild-type PRL [PRL(WT)], PRL that lacks the signal sequence for translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum [PRL(ER-)], and chimeric PRL in which the signal peptide was replaced with the sequence that directs the nuclear translocation of the SV40 large T antigen [PRL(NT+)]. Expression of these constructs in a T cell line (Nb2) responsive to PRL and IL-2 resulted in localization of PRL in the extracellular milieu, cytoplasm, or nucleus, respectively. Stimulation with IL-2 alone resulted in a five- to tenfold increase in the incorporation of [3H]thymidine by cells expressing PRL(NT+) or PRL(WT) as compared to PRL(ER-) or the parental Nb2 cells. Only the PRL(NT+) clone proliferated continuously with IL-2 stimulation in the presence of antiserum to PRL. These results demonstrate that nuclear PRL is necessary for IL-2--stimulated proliferation and suggest that a peptide hormone can function in the nucleus without binding to its cell surface receptor.\r"

Characterization of this gene from chromosome segment 10q24 revealed it to be a new homeobox, HOX11. The HOX11 homeodomain is most similar to that of the murine gene Hlx and possesses a markedly glycine-rich variable region and an acidic carboxyl terminus. HOX11, while expressed in liver, was not detected in normal thymus or T cells. This lineage-restricted homeobox gene is deregulated upon translocation into the T cell receptor locus where it may act as an oncogene.\r"

When speech signals were modulated into the ultrasonic range, listening to words resulted in the clear perception of the speech stimuli and not a sense of high-frequency vibration. These data suggest that ultrasonic bone conduction hearing has potential as an alternative communication channel in the rehabilitation of hearing disorders.\r"

In barn owls, this alignment of sensory maps was found to be controlled during ontogeny by visual instruction of the auditory spatial tuning of neurons. Large adaptive changes in auditory spatial tuning were induced by raising owls with displacing prisms mounted in spectacle frames in front of the eyes; neurons became tuned to sound source locations corresponding to their optically displaced, rather than their normal, visual receptive field locations. The results demonstrate that visual experience during development calibrates the tectal auditory space map in a site-specific manner, dictating its topography and alignment with the visual space map.\r"

However, OLT differs fundamentally from all other interventions and, as such, it is ethically unjustified to withhold potentially life-saving therapy from patients with a predicted mortality in excess of 60%.

The goal for physicians who care for individuals with problems such as alcoholic liver disease, viral hepatitis, and hepatic cancer should be to develop new strategies of care that will ultimately eliminate these diseases as problems, rather than eliminating individuals with such health problems from currently available health options. In other words, physicians who accept the responsibility for a patient's life should be searching for the best form of therapy available for their patient rather than examining the reasons that exist for limiting one's choice in health care.\r"

Proper monitoring and appropriate treatment, however, lead to successful operative outcomes in most cases.\r"
