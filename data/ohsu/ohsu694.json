  ".W": "Eighteen patients (nine asthmatic patients and nine with poorly reversible airflow obstruction) with stable, severe chronic airflow obstruction, completed a four-week randomized, doubled-blind, placebo-control, crossover trial comparing the acute and chronic effects of terbutaline administered by metered-dose inhaler (MDI) and nebulizer (NEB). Equipotent doses of terbutaline were selected from the comparison of separate cumulative dose-response curves for MDI and NEB. The MDI and NEB given acutely produced similar bronchodilatation and improvement in exercise performance. Spirometric indices, 6 min walking distance, symptom scores and extra beta-agonist use were no different between MDI and NEB treatment fortnights in the outpatient study. We conclude that the degree of bronchodilatation achieved in these patients is a reflection of the dose of bronchodilator administered and not the mode of administration. There is no justification for the preferred outpatient use of nebulized bronchodilators in patients with stable chronic airflow obstruction who can use adequate doses of bronchodilators via a metered-dose inhaler.\r"

Within 24 h of admission, 20 subjects (mean age, 69 years) with severe airflow obstruction (mean FEV, 0.69 L) were subjected to a treatment with an MDI-spacer (0.36 mg of albuterol or placebo) followed by treatment with a nebulizer (2.5 mg of albuterol or placebo). Active drug was given by only one device (randomly assigned in a double-blind manner), and the entire sequence was repeated in 4 h, with active drug given in the alternate device. Spirometric data and the Borg dyspnea score were obtained before and 1 h after each sequence of treatments. Treatment resulted in significant improvements in the FEV1, FVC, and Borg score. The percent improvement in the FEV1 was slightly larger after treatment with the nebulizer (16.7 percent vs 13.4 percent). Improvements in the Borg score were slightly larger after treatment with the MDI-spacer (-1.08 vs -0.73). However, these differences were not statistically significant. This study suggests that the MDI-spacer system is an effective method of sympathomimetic delivery in this setting, provided patients are able to master the technique.\r"

  ".W": "Increased importance is now being placed on evaluating dyspnea in patients with obstructive lung disease (OLD). We measured breathlessness at rest, using a Borg scale dyspnea index (BSDI) before and after bronchodilator albuterol [salbutamol] 200 micrograms) in 93 patients with OLD drawn from a larger population undergoing routine spirometry. The median BSDI declined from 3 to 1 before and after bronchodilator, suggesting improvement in dyspnea. However, there was no correlation between initial or postbronchodilator spirometry and BSDI. The change in FEV1 similarly did not correlate with the change in BSDI (r = 0.05). A large bronchodilator response was usually associated with improvement in dyspnea, but the converse was not observed. Thus, of ten patients with an improvement in BSDI of more than two categories, six had a change in FEV1 of 0.1 L or less after bronchodilator. Analyzing a subgroup of 65 dyspneic patients with an initial BSDI of 2 or more revealed the following response groups: those with either a bronchodilator or dyspnea response alone, both together, or neither. Twenty-eight patients (43 percent) responded both subjectively and objectively. Eleven (17 percent) had a bronchodilator response only, 17 (26 percent) had a dyspnea response only, while nine (14 percent) had neither measurable response. We conclude that dyspnea is poorly correlated with results of routine spirometry in patients with OLD. The use of dyspnea ratings may yield information about bronchodilator responsiveness not appreciated by spirometry alone.\r"

  ".W": "In patients with acquired or congenital heart diseases, the systolic pulmonary artery pressure (PAPs) can be predicted using continuous-wave Doppler ultrasound (CWD) measurement of the peak velocity of a tricuspid regurgitation (TR) jet. The aim of this study was to determine whether CWD could be used to accurately estimate PAP in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In 41 patients with stable COPD, we prospectively performed CWD and right heart catheterization. The mean value of PAPs for the entire group was 38.5 +/- 14.9 mm Hg. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAPs greater than or equal to 35 mm Hg) occurred in 51 percent (21/41) of patients. Doppler estimation of PAP was impossible in 34 percent (14/41) because of poor signal quality (n = 3), absence of Doppler-detected TR (n = 8), and inadequate TR Doppler signal (n = 3). The PAP could be estimated in 66 percent (27/41) of patients. A statistically significant correlation was found between the Doppler-estimated PAP and the catheter-measured PAPs (r = 0.65; p less than 0.001; SEE = 9 mm Hg). Therefore, CWD appears to be useful for the noninvasive estimation of PAP in patients with COPD. However, this method is associated with two limitations: (1) the high percentage of patients in whom the PAP cannot be estimated by CWD, mainly because of the absence of Doppler-detected TR, and (2) the high value of the standard error of the estimate. The combination of CWD with other Doppler methods should increase the feasibility and accuracy of Doppler echography for the prediction of PAP in patients with COPD.\r"

  ".W": "Pulsed Doppler mapping of the flow disturbance of mitral insufficiency is commonly employed to estimate the severity of regurgitation. We re-examined the customary pulsed Doppler criterion of relative depth of jet penetration (MR ratio) in 50 patients undergoing left ventriculography and found a modest correlation (r = 0.70) between Doppler and angiographic estimates of regurgitant grade. The MR ratio did not provide statistically significant separation between adjacent angiographic grades 1+ to 3+ (scale 0 to 4+). However, when the data were re-analyzed for the subset of 36 patients with pure mitral regurgitation the correlation between Doppler and angiographic estimates of regurgitant grade improved dramatically (r = 0.88) and MR ratio provided statistically significant separation between all angiographic grades with the sole exception of the distinction between 1+ and 2+ regurgitation. The presence of restriction of the regurgitant orifice in the remaining 14 patients with relative mitral inflow obstruction may result in a nozzle effect on the regurgitant jet which alters the relationship between depth of jet penetration and severity of regurgitation. In this latter group of patients independent pulsed Doppler mapping techniques may provide inaccurate estimates of the angiographic severity of mitral regurgitation.\r"

Mediastinal nodes were sampled in 86 percent of the patients who had TBNA performed, and 127 (23 percent) of 547 of these aspirates were positive. Other areas of mucosal abnormality of the tracheobronchial tree were also sampled by TBNA under direct vision and showed malignant cells in 44 (25 percent) of 176 aspirates. Of 363 patients first diagnosed as having carcinoma of the lung who had TBNA of N2 nodes, 41 (59 percent) of 70 with small-cell tumors were positive, as were 83 (28 percent) of 293 with non-small-cell malignant neoplasms. Comparison of cytologic results obtained by TBNA with histologic material in 109 cases showed an excellent correlation. In 31 cases (4 percent of all TBNA), the aspirate provided the sole means of establishing the diagnosis of cancer. Two patients were thought to have false-positive aspirates. No complications of therapeutic significance were encountered. We believe that TBNA is a safe and effective way to assess mediastinal lymphatic involvement in the staging of lung cancer and that TBNA can be safely performed as part of the initial bronchoscopic examination in patients suspected of having malignant neoplasms of the chest.\r"

  ".W": "The study objective is to identify clinical, microbiologic, and/or echocardiographic risk factors present early in the course of native valve endocarditis that predict subsequent development of periannular extension of infection. A multivariate computer-generated analysis of 21 clinical-microbiologic parameters and 11 two-dimensional echocardiographic parameters in patients with native valve endocarditis was designed. These parameters were statistically compared in operated-on patients with native valve endocarditis with and without periannular extension of infection. The study took place in a 600-bed acute-care, nonreferral, municipal hospital primarily servicing an indigent patient population. Seventy-three documented episodes of native valve endocarditis occurred between the years of 1973 and 1987, including 29 operated-on patients with surgically confirmed periannular extension of infection and 44 operated-on patients without periannular extension of infection. Multivariate logistic-regression analyses of multiple clinical, microbiologic, and echocardiographic parameters which are potentially predictive of eventual periannular extension of native valve endocarditis were carried out. The only two independent parameters that significantly predicted periannular infection among patients with native valve endocarditis were (1) aortic valve involvement and (2) abuse of intravenous (IV) drugs (p less than 0.01; p less than 0.01, respectively, multivariate analysis). The relative risk of developing periannular extension of endocarditis among patients with aortic valve involvement and/or IV drug abuse was increased by approximately 2.5-fold compared with patients without these characteristics. Factors not significantly associated with increased risk of periannular extension of native valve endocarditis included the following: prolonged febrile morbidity; Staphylococcus aureus etiology; or two-dimensional echocardiographic demonstration of vegetations, large vegetations (greater than or equal to 1 cm), multiple vegetations, or enlargement of aortic root or annulus. These data suggest that patients with native aortic valve endocarditis, particularly in the setting of IV drug abuse, should be considered for routine, serial noninvasive evaluation for the early detection of periannular extension of their infection.\r"

None of the parameters derived from the right ventricular curve was better correlated to PAP than the 99mTc RVEF. In 16 other chronic bronchitis patients, the 81mKr RVEF correlated moderately to PAP. In conclusion, the alternative isotopic methods proposed in this work do not provide a reliable estimation of pulmonary arterial pressure in patients with chronic bronchitis.\r"

The therapeutic options included observation alone (40 occurrences), thoracentesis (6 occurrences), chest tube thoracostomy (102 occurrences), and thoracotomy (20 occurrences). Treatment of SP should be prompt with the objective of complete re-expansion of the lung and prevention of recurrent pneumothorax. This should be accomplished by the use of chest tube thoracostomy with early addition of thoracotomy as necessary. Selected use of thoracentesis can be effective. The use of observation alone can be dangerous and is associated with a higher recurrence rate.\r"

However, the concept has suffered from inconsistencies in definition, criteria, and data sampling, all of which affect the interpretation of the relation between changes in work and oxygen uptake. To evaluate the response and reproducibility of the slope in oxygen uptake at peak exercise, six subjects (mean age, 33 +/- 6 years) performed two individualized ramp treadmill tests on separate days. During exercise, oxygen uptake (for a given sample of 30 eight-breath running averages) was regressed with time and the slope was calculated. Maximal oxygen uptake, maximal heart rate and maximal perceived exertion were reproducible from day 1 to day 2 (mean difference, 0.4 ml/kg/min, 1.0 beats per minute, and 0.2 for maximal oxygen uptake, heart rate, and maximal perceived exertion, respectively [not significant]). Considerable variability in the slopes was observed during each test and from day to day. This occurred despite the use of large gas exchange samples, averaging techniques, and constant, consistent changes in external work. A plateau, defined as the slope of an oxygen uptake sample at peak exercise that did not differ significantly from a slope of zero, was not a consistent finding within subjects between days. We conclude that marked variability in the slope of the change in oxygen uptake occurs throughout progressive exercise, despite the use of large samples and a linear change in external work. These findings appear to preclude the determination of a plateau by common definitions.\r"

Thereafter, the subjects were treated with slow-release theophylline for eight days. On days 9 and 10, the procedures on days 1 and 2 were repeated. The order of treatment was applied according to a crossover Latin-square design. The effects after theophylline alone were no different from placebo. Theophylline potentiated those hemodynamic effects of fenoterol due to enhanced cardiac sympathetic tone (mean +/- SE) as measured by a decrease in Q-S2I (-41.6 +/- 7.6 ms vs -27.3 +/- 5.9 ms; p = 0.0004), an increase in systolic BP (23.5 +/- 2.8 mm Hg vs 9.0 +/- 5.3 mm Hg; p = 0.00001), and an increase in heart rate (15.8 +/- 1.6 bpm vs 9.1 +/- 3.7 bpm; p = 0.0013). The responses mediated by beta 2-adrenergic receptor stimulation, namely, a decrease in PEP and diastolic BP, were not potentiated. Although fenoterol prolonged the Q-Tc interval and decreased T-wave amplitude, these effects were not potentiated by theophylline. Oral theophylline potentiates the positively inotropic and chronotropic effects of fenoterol.\r"

Since our outpatient facility has a large allergy clinic in proximity to the pulmonary clinic, which was the source of our patient population, this investigation has a negative bias toward allergy. Nevertheless, this study reveals that atopy is common in adult asthmatic patients, and a battery of allergy tests (skin tests or in vitro tests) together with total serum IgE is able to differentiate between atopic and nonatopic asthma.\r"

  ".W": "Ventilatory data, including timing and partitioning of ventilation, were obtained from six subjects with advanced Duchenne muscular dystrophy, aged 16 to 22 years, during polysomnography on two consecutive nights; the subjects were randomized to breathing air or oxygen. Five of the six patients developed oxygen desaturation exceeding 5 percent during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep while breathing air. Minute ventilation on air (the mean of at least six consecutive minutes) was 6.9 +/- 0.7 (SEM) L min-1 but fell, owing to decreases in both tidal volume and frequency, to 4.9 +/- 0.3 L min-1 (p less than 0.05) in slow wave sleep and to 4.5 +/- 0.6 L min-1 (p less than 0.05) in REM sleep. Similar falls were seen on oxygen. The variability of all ventilatory data was significantly greater in REM than non-REM (NREM) sleep. The mean abdominal contribution to breathing was lower than predicted for wakefulness and all sleep stages, and two subjects showed paradoxical abdominal movement in NREM sleep; a correlation (p less than 0.05) existed between the NREM abdominal (diaphragmatic) contribution and the extent of oxygen desaturation subsequently seen in REM. We conclude that although awake minute ventilation is normal in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, hypoventilation occurs in all sleep stages, and those with diaphragmatic dysfunction are especially vulnerable to oxygen desaturation during REM sleep.\r"

A comprehensive review of the literature revealed 30 cases of LAM treated with eight regimens of treatment.

All patients showed increases in PaO2, with the mean PaO2 rising from 63 +/- 4 (mean +/- SEM) to 76 +/- 8 mm Hg. Peak inspiratory pressure fell from 44 +/- 4 to 39 +/- 2 cm H2O. There were no significant changes in any hemodynamic or oxygen metabolism variable associated with the institution of PC-IRV. In particular, no significant alteration in cardiac index, pulmonary artery pressures, oxygen delivery, oxygen consumption, or oxygen extraction ratio occurred with the use of PC-IRV. These results suggest that PC-IRV may be a useful ventilatory modality in the treatment of severe respiratory failure since it results in improvement in arterial oxygenation without any deterioration in hemodynamic or tissue oxygen metabolism parameters.\r"

Inserting a continuous-flow nebulizer between the patient and the sensor in the ventilator makes it more difficult for the patient to generate this negative pressure. We observed two mechanically ventilated patients who were unable to initiate ventilator breaths in the pressure support mode while bronchodilators were being administered through a continuous-flow nebulizer. In neither case did ventilator alarms sound. Using a lung model, we found that when the nebulizer flow rate exceeded the mean inspiratory flow rate of the test lung, the negative pressure necessary to trigger the pressure support ventilator could not be generated. Critical care providers need to be aware of this potential complication, since it may lead to serious underventilation of their patients.\r"

To characterize the lung mechanical alterations induced by acute vascular congestion of the lung, Zrs was measured in 14 spontaneously breathing patients hospitalized for acute left ventricular failure. The Zrs data in the cardiac patients were compared with those of 48 semirecumbent normal subjects and those of 23 sitting asthmatic patients during allergen-induced bronchospasm. In the patients with acute left ventricular failure, the Zrs abnormalities noted were an excessive frequency dependence of resistance from 10 to 20 Hz and an abnormally low reactance at all frequencies, abnormalities qualitatively similar to those observed in the asthmatic patients but of lesser magnitude. Acute lung vascular congestion modifies the acoustic impedance of the respiratory system. Reflex-induced bronchospasm might be the main mechanism altering respiratory acoustic impedance in acute left ventricular failure.\r"

There was a curvilinear increase in resistive pressure to increase in flow rate. However, when resistances were computed, the Bennett cascade \"circuit\" created higher resistance at 20 lpm than at flow rates up to 120 lpm. The Bennett cascade humidifier added the greatest resistive pressure, 3.5 to 8.5 cm H2O, the Engstrom Edith, 0.5 to 6.5 cm H2O, and the Conchapak added the least, 0.0 to 2.5 cm H2O at flow rates of 20 to 120 lpm. After all the components of the ventilator circuit were attached to the ETTs, there was approximately a 97 to 450 percent increase in resistive pressure compared to the resistive pressure created by the ETTs alone.\r"

Patients had baseline esophageal manometry with two provocative tests: a Bernstein test and an intravenous injection of edrophonium. On a separate occasion they had a 24-hr ambulatory esophageal pH and motility recording. The Bernstein test provoked chest pain in two patients, while edrophonium injection did not elicit pain in any of the patients. The ambulatory pH study helped to establish the esophagus as the likely source of pain in one patient, and the ambulatory motility one in another. In our experience, ambulatory pH and motility recordings have a low diagnostic yield in the evaluation of patients with noncardiac chest pain.\r"

No patient developed typical chest pain and manometric alteration with acid infusion, while five (6.9%) patients developed these changes with edrophonium and four (5.6%) with bethanechol. Only one patient developed diagnostic changes exclusively with bethanechol. All patients tested with bethanechol developed some degree of local pain or significant cholinergic symptoms, with two patients requiring atropine for relief. Side effects from edrophonium were infrequent (28% of patients tested) and did not require atropine administration. We conclude that, using the parameters of typical chest pain and the development of manometric alterations as proof of the esophageal origin of chest pain, bethanechol at 80 micrograms/kg adds little information beyond that obtainable with edrophonium. Further, the high incidence of bethanechol-related side effects at 80 micrograms/kg suggests that this dose should not be generally recommended.\r"

Conversely, similar studies have shown that viscous liquids traverse the esophagus at similar rates for both upright and supine positions. Our purpose was to define the motor correlates of these differing responses. Six normal volunteers were studied with an infused catheter system incorporating a Dent sleeve for monitoring lower esophageal sphincter pressure. The subjects were given a series of swallows of a water and a viscous (52 centipoise) bolus in both the supine and upright positions. In the upright position, the water bolus caused an increased velocity of propagation in the proximal esophageal segment that was associated with a shortening of lower esophageal sphincter relaxation time and reductions in amplitude and duration of contraction. No significant changes in the peristaltic wave were noted with the viscous bolus during alterations of body position. We conclude that the more rapid transit of a nonviscous water bolus through the esophagus in the upright position is reflected in specific alterations of esophageal peristaltic parameters. The possible mechanisms for these differing responses are discussed.\r"

Two models of esophagitis were used: nine opossums had an esophageal perfusion of 100 meq hydrochloric acid for 2 hr and were studied at 24 hr. Ten had the perfusion for 4 h and their esophagitis were studied in vitro after 72 hr. Comparisons were made in all instances to animals who had esophageal saline perfusion for identical periods. All acid-perfused animals developed gross and histologic evidence of mucosal inflammation; in three animals, inflammatory changes extended into the submucosa and the muscularis propria. Manometric recordings in the acid-perfused animals revealed esophageal shortening, frequent failure of primary peristalsis and frequent occurrence of spontaneous contractions. Recordings of isometric tension of muscle in vitro revealed spontaneous contractions in strips from the mucosa and from the circular and from the longitudinal muscle. The amplitude of contractions in response to electrical stimulation was decreased, but the duration of contractions was increased largely because of a prolonged recovery phase. These changes in mechanical response occurred with stimulus parameters directed at both the muscle and the intrinsic nerves. We conclude that esophageal inflammation can lead to an increased irritability and decreased stimulus response of the smooth muscle of the esophagus even where it is not directly involved in an inflammatory response. These changes correspond to the functional abnormalities of the esophagus seen in patients with reflux esophagitis.\r"

Factors that lead to development of this infection are unknown. We hypothesized that delayed solid-phase gastric emptying, a condition characterized by antral stasis, might predispose to Campylobacter pylori infection. We prospectively studied 51 patients with symptoms of gastroparesis using a solid-phase gastric emptying study and upper endoscopy. Patients were excluded if they had predominant symptoms of epigastric pain or an abnormal endoscopy. Three biopsies were obtained from the antrum and stained with H&E. When any inflammation was present, a Warthin-Starry stain was also performed. These were blindly examined for chronic inflammation, activity, and presence of Campylobacter pylori. Campylobacter pylori was not more common in patients with gastroparesis, documented by delayed gastric emptying, than in patients with a normal emptying study. On the contrary, there was a significantly lower incidence of Campylobacter pylori in those with delayed emptying compared to those with normal emptying (5% vs 31%, P less than 0.05). Gastritis activity correlated closely with Campylobacter presence. Inactive chronic gastritis with Campylobacter was equally common in those with delayed or normal gastric emptying. Diabetics were no more likely to harbor Campylobacter pylori than nondiabetics (16% vs 25%). The 5% incidence of Campylobacter in the gastroparesis group is less than, but approaches, that previously reported in asymptomatic controls. The 31% incidence of Campylobacter in the group with symptoms of gastroparesis but normal gastric emptying approaches that reported for nonulcer dyspepsia. Our data suggest that gastroparesis does not predispose to Campylobacter pylori infection or histologic chronic gastritis.\r"

  ".W": "In the anesthetized rat, exogenous acid (0.1-0.3 N HCl) perfused through the duodenum produced a dose-related increase in the severity of duodenal villous injury. Increasing the duration of perfusion of the 0.1 N HCl also increased the severity of the injury. The increase in the severity of the lesion score was due to an increase in the percentage of villi with damage extending to the lower half of the villus. 16,16-Dimethyl prostaglandin E2 (dm PGE2, 5 micrograms/kg) administered subcutaneously significantly increased duodenal mucosal alkaline secretion and significantly reduced the duodenal villous injury produced by 0.1 N HCl. The reduction in the severity of the lesion score was due to a decrease in the percentage of villi with the deeper type of damage. These data indicate: (1) perfusion of the rat duodenum with 0.1 N HCl at 0.1 ml/min for 30 min provides a valid model for assessing deep duodenal villous injury, (2) exogenous prostaglandin enhances the resistance of the duodenal mucosa against acid induced deep villous injury, and (3) the enhanced resistance may be mediated at least in part by stimulation of duodenal alkaline secretion. The results support the hypothesis that stimulated duodenal alkaline secretion may play a role in defense of the duodenal mucosa against acid-induced deep villous injury.\r"

Old rats had the following histologic changes: (1) partial atrophy of the gastric glands and their replacement with hyalinlike connective tissue; (2) cystic dilatation of the gastric glands at the bases with occasional squamous cell metaplasia; and (3) extensive perivascular depositions of PAS-positive material, negative for amyloid. The total mucosal thickness was 484 +/- 100 microns in young rats vs 1122 +/- 240 microns in old rats (P less than 0.01). Electron microscopy demonstrated degenerative changes in parietal and chief cells, hyperplasia of surface and foveolar mucous cells, and prominent accumulation of disorganized collagen fibrils in perivascular connective tissue. This study indicates that the gastric mucosa of aging rats that have not been exposed to damaging agents does show definite histologic and ultrastructural changes.\r"

In each study at least three duodenal phase III complexes of the migrating motor complex were recorded. In randomized order after the first or second duodenal phase III, mental stress was induced for 60 min by means of solving anagrams and doing mental arithmetic. Mental stress significantly increased the duration of the migrating motor complex by 60% (137.9 +/- 16.3 vs 86.1 +/- 13.0). Gastric flow rate and gastric acid output were not significantly altered. Duodenal flow rate was not changed during the stress period but significantly decreased by more than 52% in the following 30-min resting period. Duodenal concentration and output of chymotrypsin were significantly increased during the second 30-min period of acute mental stress; chymotrypsin output was significantly reduced in the poststress period. We conclude that acute mental stress has different effects on the stomach, the pancreas, and the upper gastrointestinal motility. The mechanisms by which the central nervous activity induced by mental stress affects the motility and secretion of the upper gastrointestinal tract remain to be elucidated.\r"

Rats were immunized with the culture supernatant of Aeromonas hydrophila, isolate SSU. This culture supernatant contained a number of toxins that may be considered virulence factors. After 24 days of immunization, rats were anesthetized and a 10-cm intestinal segment was perfused with phosphate-buffered saline. The effluents were collected for measurement of IgA and IgG by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. When compared with the effect of intravenous administration of normal saline in the control group, intravenous injection of BBS (20 micrograms/kg) in the experimental group caused a significant increase in rat intestinal IgA and IgG in perfusates. The stimulatory effects of BBS on the presence of IgA and IgG were depressed partially by proglumide, a receptor antagonist of cholecystokinin (CCK) and gastrin. Treatment with pentagastrin (250 micrograms/kg) accelerated intestinal secretion of IgA, but failed to stimulate intestinal IgG secretion. In addition, intravenous injection of CCK-8 (120 ng/kg) evoked the intestinal secretion of either IgA or IgG. These findings demonstrated that BBS, gastrin, and CCK can stimulate antibody secretion in rat intestine and the stimulatory effect of BBS may be mediated partially via release of CCK and gastrin. These results suggest that neuropeptides such as BBS and gastrointestinal hormones, eg, CCK and gastrin, may participate in the regulation of intestinal secretion of IgA and IgG antibodies, respectively, in rats.\r"

The increase in net fluid absorption was dependent upon the extent of the intestine removed. The cAMP and cGMP content of cecal and colonic mucosa were significantly reduced after jejunoilectomy. Changes in nucleotide levels were dependent on the length of the intestine resected. On the other hand, mucosa Na,K-ATPase specific activity was only increased in the cecum after 80% intestinal resection. The results are discussed in terms of adaptation to prevent diarrhea.\r"

The crude death rate of ulcerative colitis has declined since 1930. Plotted versus the year of birth, its age-specific death rates showed an initial rise in successive generations born between 1850 and 1900, followed by a fall in all later generations. The crude death rate of Crohn's disease increased from 1950 to 1974 and then declined. When the age-specific death rates for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis were superimposed, the mortality from Crohn's disease in each age group or sex began to decline at a different time, but always upon reaching the level of mortality from ulcerative colitis. It appears as if the gradual disappearance of an ulcerative colitis-associated factor in a birth-cohort fashion prevented a further rise in mortality from Crohn's disease after 1974.\r"

Lymphocytic colitis patients were compared to 21 patients with collagenous colitis. Similarities included age, symptomatology, and nondiagnostic radiographic and endoscopic studies. However, the sex distribution was statistically different, with an equal male-to-female ratio in lymphocytic colitis and female predominance (80%) in collagenous colitis. Other differences included dissimilar histocompatibility phenotypes and collagen band on biopsies of collagenous but not lymphocytic colitis.

Analysis of data from three different regions showed greater milk intake in cortical cataract patients only. Our data indicate the importance of specifying cataract type in cataract studies and highlight the problem this approach brings forth. We noted no different trends in subjects from northwest and southeast India, although the number of subjects from the southeast was considerably less.

A panel of monoclonal antibodies prepared against HLA-DR, NK, IL-2R, T11, T4, T8, and B1 cell surface antigens was used to examine the tissues. Before OLTx, none of the 19 subjects studied had clinical or histologic evidence for CMV gastroenteritis. Following OLTx, five of the 19 subjects had CMV gastroenteritis. The number of HLA-DR positive staining lymphocytes present in biopsies obtained post-OLTx was significantly greater (P less than 0.005) than those present in biopsies obtained pre-OLTx regardless of the presence or absence of CMV gastroenteritis. No difference in the intensity of HLA-DR antigen expression between pre- and post-OLTx biopsies and those with and without CMV gastroenteritis was evident. No difference in the number of natural killer (NK) cells and the number of cells expressing the interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) was evident between biopsies obtained pre- and post-OLTx. In contrast, the number of T lymphocytes bearing the T11, T4, and T8 markers and the calculated T4/T8 ratio differed between biopsies obtained pre- and post-OLTx and between those positive for CMV gastroenteritis post-OLTx and those without evidence for CMV gastroenteritis either before or after OLTx, although these changes were not consistent throughout the gastrointestinal tract.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Therefore, it has been used to reduce the high rate of allograft infection in clinical liver transplantation of HBV-positive individuals. This study was performed to evaluate the effect of IFN-alpha on lymphocyte subsets as well as the HLA-DR antigen expression in liver tissue. The resected livers obtained from two groups of patients who received liver transplants between 1983 and 1987 at the University of Pittsburgh were examined: group A consisted of 11 patients who were not treated (controls), and group B consisted of 10 patients (experimental group) who were treated with IFN-alpha for 29.4 +/- 5.6 days prior to transplantation. No differences between the two groups existed in terms of a variety of demographic and clinical characteristics. Both groups had cirrhosis as a result of chronic HBV infection. Monoclonal antibodies to cell-surface antigens unique to different lymphocyte populations and the HLA-DR antigens were used in conjunction with the avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase technique to identify cells in tissue sections. The number of HLA-DR-positive lymphocytes in the liver was increased (P less than 0.005) within the portal areas in rIFN-alpha-treated group as compared to that seen in the untreated group (84.4 +/- 13.6/HPF vs 33.3 +/- 4.8/HPF). Moreover, the intensity of the HLA-DR antigen expression in the portal areas (P less than 0.02) and in the hepatic lobule (P less than 0.05) was greater in the treated group than in untreated group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The present study was undertaken to investigate the diagnostic usefulness of fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) in a large series of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) seen over a 1-year period. During 1986, ultrasonographically guided percutaneous FNAB was performed in 72 patients with suspected HCC. A final diagnosis of HCC was made in 58 patients. The presence or absence of HCC was ascertained by histological examination and/or by other diagnostic procedures (alpha 1-fetoprotein, computed tomography, arteriography) and by clinical follow-up (repeated ultrasonographic controls) and/or by surgery or necropsy. A total of 61 FNABs were carried out in these 58 patients. Only 42 (69%) of the 61 FNABs allowed the diagnosis of HCC. This moderate diagnostic sensitivity was not related to tumor size. Only one false positive result was observed in the non-HCC group. Therefore, the diagnostic specificity of FNAB for HCC was 93%, with a positive predictive value of 97% and a negative predictive value of 40%. These results show that FNAB is a useful diagnostic technique in patients with HCC. However, these data also show that there is a large proportion (31%) of subjects with false negative results. Therefore, we suggest that further efforts should be made to improve the diagnostic accuracy of this procedure.\r"

  ".W": "Continuing evaluation of the pathophysiology of gallbladder disease has demonstrated significant relationships between gallbladder mucosal fluid transport, gallbladder inflammation, and prostanoid formation. Inflamed gallbladder mucosa secretes, rather than absorbs, fluid, a process associated with prostaglandin formation. Bradykinin has been previously implicated in the pathogenesis of cholecystitis and, in the intestine, bradykinin stimulates mucosal fluid secretion by a prostaglandin-mediated mechanism. Bradykinin was infused into the gallbladder lumen and administered intraarterially into the hepatic artery of perfused cat gallbladders. Both methods of bradykinin administration reversed the mucosal absorption present during control experiments as measured by concentration changes in a nonabsorbable marker. Perfusate and gallbladder tissue prostaglandin E concentrations were significantly increased by bradykinin when compared to control values. Concentrations of 6-keto PGF1 alpha in perfusate solutions and in gallbladder tissue were significantly increased, suggesting bradykinin increased prostacyclin formation. Bradykinin administration significantly increased inflammation, as evaluated by a histologic scoring system. Indomethacin was administered intravenously along with luminal perfusion of the gallbladder with bradykinin. Indomethacin significantly decreased gallbladder fluid secretion and prostanoid formation, but not histologic inflammation, when compared to values produced by bradykinin alone. An increase in systemic vascular and bile kinin concentrations produces gallbladder mucosal water secretion, a process which may be mediated by prostanoids. Histologic inflammation produced by bradykinin was not prevented by indomethacin.\r"

Histology of gastric mucosal biopsy specimens in both patients revealed active chronic gastritis, most severe in body mucosa. Giemsa stain revealed bacteria with four to eight spirals, 0.5 micron in diameter and 3-7 micron in length. The organisms had multiple sheathed flagella at the pole and smooth cell walls without axial filaments. The organisms resembled the gastric spirillum that has been seen in cats, dogs, and nonhuman primates. After antibacterial therapy with bismuth subsalicylate, amoxicillin, and metronidazole, the organisms disappeared in both patients and the gastritis healed. Unlike C. pylori, this new spirillum prefers to colonize gastric mucosa containing parietal cells. Whereas this type of organism is a common commensal in other mammals, it appears to be associated with and a possible cause of gastritis in humans.\r"

The extent to which the contents of these enemas are distributed to inflamed mucosal linings has not previously been determined. This study was undertaken to validate a technique for labeling 5-ASA with 99mTc and to quantitate the distribution of [99mTc]5-ASA in eight patients with left-sided ulcerative colitis. Eight patients underwent three colonic scintigraphic exams within five days, receiving a 60-ml radiolabeled 5-ASA enema into the unprepared rectum for each study, with sequential anterior abdominal images obtained for 4 hr. Activity within the rectum, sigmoid, descending, transverse, and ascending colon was quantitated. Over 50% of the labeled enema had advanced beyond the rectum in five of eight patients and in six of eight patients by 30 min and 60 min, respectively. The distribution of [99mTc]5-ASA was quantitatively reproducible when repeated in the same patient on different days, despite apparent visual differences. By 2 hr, the amount of the enema present within the rectum decreased significantly (P less than 0.05) compared to the initial distribution. The amount of enema present within the descending colon was increased significantly at 0.5 hr (P less than 0.05) and at 2 hr (P less than 0.01). There were no significant changes in the distribution from initial values for the sigmoid, transverse, or ascending colon at any time. In each of these cases the spread of the enema to or beyond the extent of disease was documented. In patients with left-sided ulcerative colitis, small volume [99mTc]5-ASA enemas reliably reach the area of inflammation.\r"

Since selective cAMP-dependent protein kinase isoenzyme activation may account for specific physiological hormonal responses, we investigated steroid effects on activation of isoenzymes I and II in response to PTH using a new ion exchange separation procedure. Pretreatment of cells for 2 days with the glucocorticoid triamcinolone acetonide (TRM) or 1,25-(OH)2D3 altered the degree of cAMP-dependent protein kinase isoenzyme activation by PTH in accordance with their modulation of intracellular cAMP accumulation, but did not alter the amount of each isoenzyme present or the order in which isoenzymes I and II were activated. In all treatment groups isoenzyme I was preferentially activated by low doses of PTH, while high concentrations activated both isoenzymes, as predicted by the relative affinities of each isoenzyme for cAMP. Glucocorticoid reduced the concentration of bovine PTH-(1-34) required for maximal activation of isoenzyme I from 1 to 0.05 ng/ml and that required for activation of isoenzyme II from 10 to 1 ng/ml. This effect was abolished by simultaneous treatment of cells with 1,25-(OH)2D3. At doses of PTH that caused partial activation (0.05-0.1 ng/ml for isoenzyme I; 1 ng/ml for isoenzyme II), 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment attenuated this activation. In all groups both isoenzymes were fully activated by 100 ng/ml PTH. Control experiments demonstrated that isoenzyme activation is not a result of cell disruption over the range of PTH doses that regulation by steroid hormone was observed. These results extend our studies on modulation of the cAMP pathway by steroid hormones and make it feasible to correlate selective isoenzyme activation with specific responses to PTH.\r"

  ".W": "In normal rats, T3 glucuronide (T3G) is the major biliary T3 metabolite, but excretion of T3 sulfate (T3S) is greatly increased after inhibition of type I deiodinase, e.g. with 6-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU). In this study, the fate of the T3 conjugates excreted with bile was studied to assess the significance of a putative enterohepatic circulation of T3 in rats. Conventional (CV) or intestine-decontaminated (ID) rats received iv [125I]T3G or [125I]T3S, the latter usually after pretreatment with PTU (1 mg/100 g BW). Radioactivity in plasma and bile or feces was analyzed by Sephadex LH-20 chromatography and HPLC. Within 1 h, 88% of injected T3G was excreted in bile of CV or ID rats, independent of PTU. About 75% of the injected T3S was excreted within 4 h in PTU-treated rats, in contrast to only 20% in controls. Up to 13 h after iv administration of T3G or T3S (+PTU) to intact ID and CV rats, fecal radioactivity consisted of more than 90% T3 in all CV rats, 95% of T3S in T3S-injected ID rats, and 30% T3 and 67% T3G in T3G-injected ID rats. In overnight-fasted CV rats injected with T3G, total plasma radioactivity rapidly declined until a nadir of 0.10% dose/ml at about 2.5 h, but radioactivity reappeared with a broad maximum of 0.12% dose/ml between 5.5-10 h. In the latter phase, plasma radioactivity consisted of predominantly I- and T3 in a ratio of 2:1. Reabsorption was diminished in fed CV rats and prevented in ID rats. Plasma T3 4-10 h after iv T3G injection to overnight-fasted CV rats was 12, 2, and 3 times higher than that in bile-diverted rats, fed CV rats, and ID rats, respectively, and similar to that 4 h after the injection of T3 itself. Total plasma radioactivity as well as plasma T3 6-13 h after iv administration T3S in PTU-treated rats were significantly increased in CV vs. ID rats, e.g. T3 0.016% vs. 0.005% dose/ml. These results demonstrate a significant enterohepatic circulation of T3 in rats in which bacterial hydrolysis of T3 conjugates excreted with bile plays an important role.\r"

When bromocriptine, a dopaminomimetic that suppresses PRL secretion, was given in form of long-acting microcapsules (CBLA) 3 days before FCA, the hind limb swelling was significantly reduced by 70%. Here, we showed that plasma PRL levels were significantly elevated (by 150% over controls) during the 6-day period after FCA, particularly at night. Further, within 1-4 days after FCA inoculation, marked increases in ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity occurred in bone marrow, thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes (by 190%, 160%, 80% and 75% over control values, respectively). In FCA-treated rats, the circadian rhythm of thymic ODC showed that an important enhancement of activity occurred during the dark phase, which correlated with the peak of PRL secretion (between 2200-0400 h). Finally, pretreatment with CBLA significantly inhibited the induction of ODC in response to FCA in thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes (by 65%, 80%, and 45%, respectively) and inhibited it more weakly in the bone marrow. This in vivo study leaves little doubt about the existence of a PRL-dependent immuno-stimulatory mechanism, probably involved in the pathogenesis of adjuvant arthritis.\r"

Half-life determinations of hPRL mRNA in control and dexamethasone-treated cells revealed a reduction of t1/2 from 16 to 4 h.

  ".W": "We have used the tritiated water method to quantitate the effects of thyroid hormone on lipogenesis in the rat and then determined the contribution of this process to thyroid hormone-induced thermogenesis. After thyroid hormone administration to hypothyroid animals, fatty acid synthesis rose after a lag time of 12-16 h and reached a plateau after 4-5 days. This is consistent with the kinetics of an increase in oxygen consumption measured by others in similar animals. A diurnal variation was maintained in all thyroid states, with the peak value in the middle of the dark period being 3-fold higher than the nadir. Fatty acid synthesis in the livers of hyperthyroid animals was 3- to 4-fold higher than that in euthyroid rats, which, in turn, was 3- to 5-fold higher than the rate observed in hypothyroid rats. Slightly smaller but similar fold increases were measured in epididymal fat. A stimulation of fatty acid synthesis by thyroid hormone was also measured in the rest of the carcass, with hyperthyroid rates being twice those in hypothyroid animals. The contribution of the liver was much greater in hyperthyroid rats (34% of total fatty acid synthesis) than in hypothyroid animals (5%). The energy costs of this synthesis were calculated and compared to published values for total oxygen consumption in different thyroid states. Thus, 6-10% of the total increment in oxygen consumption between hyperthyroid and hypothyroid animals could be attributed to lipogenesis, depending on which published figures were used. About 3% of this increment was due to the liver alone.\r"

  ".U": "90059773\r", 
  ".W": "Two surges of PRL designated as nocturnal (N) and diurnal (D) are observed during early pregnancy. The present study was undertaken to determine the involvement of serotonin (5-HT) in regulating these PRL surges. On day 7 of pregnancy intracarotid catheters were implanted, and blood samples were obtained at 0200 and 0400 h on day 8 and between midnight and 0600 h on day 9 to monitor the N surge. Rats were killed by decapitation, brains were quickly removed, frozen on dry ice, and stored at -70 C until later determination of indole and catecholamines. Pretreatment 24 h earlier with para-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA; 250 mg/kg BW), an inhibitor of 5-HT biosynthesis, did not affect the N PRL surge, although the hypothalamic concentrations of 5-HT and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid were greatly reduced. On the other hand, administration at 2400 h of ketanserin (KET; 10 mg/kg BW, ip) or LY-53857 (5 mg/kg BW, ip), two selective 5-HT2 antagonists, significantly (P less than 0.025 for KET and P less than 0.01 for LY-53857) reduced the N PRL surge. Neither KET nor LY-53857 altered the hypothalamic content of biogenic amines compared to that in saline-treated controls. Intravenous treatment with LY-53857 (1 mg/kg) at 0200 h after the onset of the N surge induced no change in plasma PRL levels compared to those in controls. To test whether 5-HT plays a role in the D surge, rats were decapitated at 1800 h after drug injection. Pretreatment with the same dose of PCPA (24 h), KET (2 h), or LY-53857 (2 h) that was given to rats in the N surge study significantly (P less than 0.01) reduced plasma PRL levels. As observed in the N study, PCPA greatly diminished the hypothalamic content of 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid, and also reduced dopamine, but to a much lesser extent than 5-HT. It is concluded that 5-HT contributes significantly to the generation of the D surge. Its role during the N surge remains uncertain due to the contradictory effects of the synthesis inhibitor PCPA and the receptor antagonists KET and LY-53857.\r"

The hippocampus has been implicated as a suprahypothalamic mediator of such feedback, based on numerous lesion, stimulation, and steroid implantation studies. These reports, however, predated the isolation and characterization of CRF and recognition of the multifactorial control of ACTH release. Thus, it is not clear which hypothalamic ACTH secretagogues are under inhibitory control of the hippocampus. To answer this, we measured hypophysialportal concentrations of CRF, arginine vasopressin, and oxytocin in rats with fornix transections, which disrupt hippocampal communication with the hypothalamus. Hypophysial-portal blood was collected in rats exposed to either low or high circulating corticosterone concentrations in the presence or absence of the coincident stressor of hypotension. We observed that fornix transection produced hypersecretion of all three secretagogues. However, the pattern of hypersecretion differed for each as follows: 1) fornix transection did not affect either initial CRF secretion or the magnitude of the stress response, but made rats resistant to a high feedback signal during stress; 2) fornix transection led to initial arginine vasopressin hypersecretion, which remained sensitive to a high feedback signal; and 3) fornix transection led to initial oxytocin hypersecretion as well as resistance to a high corticosterone feedback signal during hypotension.\r"

  ".W": "The distribution of the estrogen receptor (ER) was investigated in neonatal female genital tracts (uterus, oviduct, cervix, and vagina) from days 1-22 after birth, using immunohistochemistry employing an anti-ER monoclonal antibody. In uteri, the ER in epithelial cells began to be observed by day 4. The number of positive epithelial cells and the staining intensity gradually increased until day 22 of age. On the other hand, uterine stroma cells gave a strong ER immunostaining even on day 1. The staining intensity reached a maximum by days 4-7 and then slightly decreased with age. In the oviduct, cervix, and vagina, epithelial cells showed positive ER immunostaining on day 1, and the intensity increased gradually until day 22. ER immunostaining in stroma cells was almost constant during the development period. The ER in both epithelial and stroma cells from these younger animals showed similar biochemical properties, i.e. an increased affinity for nuclei and resistance to extraction with PBS. Thus, during neonatal development of the female reproductive tract, ER is present not only in stroma cells but also in epithelial cells. This ER protein exhibits properties and characteristics similar to those of adult mice. The presence of ER suggests that some of the estrogen actions of cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue abnormalities resulting from prenatal and postnatal estrogen administration may be mediated by receptor interactions.\r"

  ".W": "The anterior hypothalamic area (AHA) has been postulated as a site of action for melatonin. We tested the hypothesis that lesions to the AHA (AHAx) would counteract the inhibitory effect of exogenous melatonin on blastocyst implantation in the spotted skunk by removing a possible site of action. Forty-seven females were treated as follows during delayed implantation. In Exp 1, five received empty Silastic capsules, five received Silastic capsules containing melatonin, six received sham AHAx plus empty capsules, none received AHAx plus empty capsules, and eight received AHAx plus capsules containing melatonin. In Exp 2, four skunks each received two empty capsules, five skunks each received two capsules containing melatonin, and five skunks received AHAx plus capsules containing melatonin. All capsules were inserted sc in the interscapular region 14-35 days after surgery in Exp 1 and 2 weeks before surgery in Exp 2. Surgery was performed between January 22 and February 12, 1988, in Exp 1 and on March 2-3, 1989, in Exp 2. The skunks were subjected to a natural photoperiod, and the duration of preimplantation was measured. In Exp 1, AHAx plus empty capsules significantly (P less than 0.05) shortened the duration of preimplantation (163 +/- 14.7 days) compared to that in sham AHAx or intact controls (193 +/- 26.1 and 188 +/- 10.6 days, respectively). Melatonin significantly (P less than 0.05) prolonged the duration of preimplantation (289 +/- 2.9 days) in intact skunks, but failed to do so in skunks with AHAx, as the preimplantation period was significantly shortened (159 +/- 6.1 days). In Exp 2, AHAx reversed the inhibitory effect of melatonin on the duration of preimplantation (191 +/- 21.5 days), as intact melatonin-treated skunks had a significantly longer preimplantation period (260 +/- 2.5 days) than skunks receiving empty capsules (191 +/- 16.4 days). The inhibitory effect of melatonin was reversible in all intact skunks, as blastocysts implanted 23 days, on the average, after cessation of treatment with melatonin. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that a portion of the AHA and/or adjacent regions play an essential role in timing blastocyst implantation in the spotted skunk. The lesions may have given this result by ablating a neural pathway controlling PRL secretion and may or may not have involved a site of action for melatonin.\r"

  ".W": "Thyroid hormones influence growth in part by altering the secretion and effects of GH. GH, in turn, mediates its effects by regulating the synthesis and secretion of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). IGF-I is a pleiotropic growth factor that is synthesized by many tissues and acts on many tissues to regulate both cellular replication and differentiated function. We have studied the direct effects of thyroid hormones and the combined effects of thyroid hormones and GH on the regulation of IGF-I synthesis and secretion in hypophysectomized (hypox) rats in vivo. All rats, except normal littermates and a hypox control group, received 100 micrograms hydrocortisone/100 g BW for 10 days. Circulating IGF-I was measured by specific RIA (normal rats, 1 U/ml), and hepatic IGF-I mRNA was measured by Northern blot hybridization with an antisense cRNA probe. 1) Hypox rats treated with hGH (75 micrograms, ip, twice daily) for 10 days gained 17 g BW vs. 70 g for normal littermates. GH markedly increased hepatic IGF-I mRNA and circulating IGF-I (0.52 +/- 0.14 U/ml 12 h after the last GH injection vs. 0.03 +/- 0.02 for hypox controls). 2) T4 (1 micrograms/100 g BW, ip) for 10 days increased neither weight, hepatic IGF-I mRNA, nor circulating IGF-I. 3) Rats treated with T4 for 10 days followed by a single injection of 1 mg GH, ip, increased hepatic IGF-I mRNA and circulating IGF-I levels comparably as in rats receiving acute GH alone (IGF-I, 12 h, 0.31 +/- 0.09 vs. 0.36 +/- 0.06 U/ml). 4) Hypox rats treated with a single injection of T3 (1.5 micrograms/100 g BW, ip) had slightly increased hepatic IGF-I mRNA, but showed no significant change in circulating IGF-I levels. 5) A single injection of T3 plus GH to hypox rats increased IGF-I mRNA levels above those in rats injected with GH alone and increased serum IGF-I levels to 0.48 +/- 0.12 U/ml compared to 0.36 +/- 0.06 U/ml for GH alone. 6) After 10 days of GH treatment, a single injection of T3 lowered both hepatic IGF-I mRNA and circulating IGF-I (0.52 +/- 0.14 to 0.16 +/- 0.06 U/ml, 6 h after T3). These studies demonstrate that thyroid hormones have relatively little direct effect on IGF-I synthesis but can have major effects on GH-stimulated IGF-I synthesis and secretion. The pattern of these effects depends on the integrity of the pituitary gland, prior exposure of the liver to GH and/or thyroid hormones, and the temporal relationship between GH and thyroid hormone administration.\r"

  ".W": "High density lipoprotein (HDL3) binds with high affinity to many types of cells, but controversy exists concerning the nature and biological significance of the binding. We have recently demonstrated that HDL and apoproteins (apo)-AI, -AII, and -CI stimulate a specific and dose-dependent increase in placental lactogen (hPL) release from human trophoblast cells. To examine the possible relationship between HDL3 binding and stimulation of hPL release, we have characterized the binding of [125I]HDL3 to an enriched fraction of hPL-producing trophoblast cells. Binding studies were performed on trophoblast cells isolated by isopycnic centrifugation of collagenase/hyaluronidase-dispersed placental tissue and apo-E free-HDL3 (density, 1.125-1.215 g/ml). Scatchard analysis of binding studies performed at 37 C for 2 h revealed two classes of binding sites: 1) high affinity binding sites with a Kd of 9.7 +/- 2.2 micrograms/ml (1.3 x 10(-7) M) and 9.8 +/- 3.2 x 10(5) binding sites/trophoblast cell, and 2) low affinity binding sites with a Kd of 172.8 +/- 64.8 micrograms/ml (2.3 x 10(-6) M) and an estimated 3.2 x 10(6) sites/cell. As has been found in hepatocytes and other cells, the number of HDL3-binding sites per trophoblast cell (but not the binding affinity) decreased at lower incubation temperatures. In addition, HDL3 binding to trophoblasts cells did not require calcium and was not affected by prior treatment of the cells with pronase or trypsin. HDL3-binding sites on trophoblast cells, however, were not specific for HDL3. Low density lipoprotein (density, 1.063-1.055 g/ml), which does not stimulate hPL release, was nearly as potent on a molar basis as HDL3 in binding to the high and low affinity binding sites on trophoblast cells. Furthermore, nitrated HDL3, which does not compete for high affinity binding to trophoblast cells, stimulated hPL release. Although the characteristics of HDL3 binding to trophoblast cells are similar to those of other cells, these results strongly suggest that the binding of HDL3 to high affinity binding sites is not essential for HDL-mediated hPL release.\r"

Administration of 88 micrograms/kg hRlx sc in 1% BPP resulted in delayed, prolonged absorption. Although peak hRlx concentrations were lower, serum concentrations remained elevated longer in the presence of BPP compared to a single sc administration of hRlx in saline at the same dose. The bioavailabilities with and without BPP were similar (109 and 96%, respectively). While the pharmacodynamic effect (i.e. lengthening of the pubic ligament in estrogen-primed mice) was approximately maximum at 88 micrograms/kg hRlx sc with BPP, single sc administration of hRlx without BPP up to 264 micrograms/kg had no effect on pubic ligament length. In the absence of the BPP vehicle, manipulation of the regimen (e.g. multiple sc doses) showed that emulation of the serum concentration-time profile observed for hRlx in the presence of BPP resulted in similar pharmacodynamic effects. It appears that BPP delays the absorption of hRlx after sc administration, resulting in prolonged, elevated hRlx serum concentrations. hRlx has been shown to be effective in this model without BPP if it is administered by a multidose sc schedule. As has been observed with other protein therapeutics, the dosage regimen employed for hRlx delivery appears to be an important determinant of the expression of its pharmacodynamic effects.\r"

We now show that VIP can stimulate sexual behavior in rats with reduced masculine potential due to pituitary grafting or castration. This effect was attenuated in the presence of a novel VIP antagonist, devised by a hybrid peptide strategy. Thus, we have synthesized a molecule combining a portion of VIP with a portion of neurotensin, peptides of opposite pharmacological action on cAMP formation and smooth muscle relaxation. The hybrid peptide markedly inhibited VIP's effect on sexual behavior. This inhibition was manifested by a significant increase in the mean interval between copulatory events (greater than 3-fold change) coupled with a blockade of VIP-stimulated ejaculation. Other putative VIP antagonists were not as effective in blocking these activities. Thus, our results imply that VIP is not only associated with penile erection, but is involved in sexual behavior as well. Furthermore, the hybrid antagonist was shown to inhibit VIP binding in glial cell cultures. The availability of highly potent VIP antagonists may offer a route to study the possible multiple VIP receptors as well as help delineate other biological activities attributable to VIP.\r"

  ".U": "90059783\r", 
  ".W": "The calbindins are Ca-binding proteins whose expression is regulated by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, the active metabolite of vitamin D3. The calbindins are found in high amounts in the proximal intestine (calbindin-D-9k) and the kidney (calbindin-D-28k), and they are thought to play a role in Ca transport by these tissues. Ca absorption by the intestine and perhaps the kidney declines with age, and this could be due to decreased expression of calbindin. Therefore, the expression of calbindins-D-9k and -D-28k was measured in F344 rats aged 2, 6, 13, and 24 months. mRNA levels were measured by dot blot hybridization to synthetic cDNA oligonucleotide probes, and protein levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using specific antisera. Intestinal calbindin-D-9k mRNA decreased markedly between 2 and 6 months of age, but it then increased significantly between 13 and 24 months. Calbindin-D-9k protein paralleled the decrease in mRNA between 2 and 6 months, but continued to decline at 13 and 24 months despite the rise in mRNA. In the kidney, calbindin-D-28k mRNA declined between 2 and 13 months and then plateaued. Calbindin-D-28k protein followed a similar pattern. In the same studies expression of calmodulin by the intestine and kidney did not change with age. Plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D3 correlated well with the expression of calbindin-D-9k in the intestine at 2 and 6 months of age and with the expression of calbindin-D-28k in the kidney at all ages. Decreased expression of calbindin-D with age may contribute to the age-related decrease in Ca transport in intestine and kidney.\r"

  ".U": "90059784\r", 
  ".W": "In several anterior pituitary hormone systems, factors that stimulate hormone release also stimulate hormone biosynthesis. In the corticotropes of the anterior pituitary, CRF stimulates ACTH release as well as cAMP accumulation and transcription of the POMC gene. Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is a well documented coregulator of ACTH release and potentiates CRF-stimulated cAMP accumulation. The present studies were undertaken to determine if AVP also potentiates the early effects of CRF on POMC gene expression in rat anterior pituitary primary cultures. We have measured the levels of the POMC primary transcript, processing intermediate, and mature mRNA in nuclear RNA samples and POMC mRNA in cytoplasmic RNA samples as well as ACTH release after treatment with CRF and/or AVP. After a 30-min treatment with 0.5 nM CRF, POMC primary transcript levels were increased by 200-400%. Thirty-minute or 1-h treatments with AVP alone (10 or 100 nM) did not affect primary transcript levels, but increased the amount of the processing intermediate, while a 2-h incubation with 100 nM AVP significantly decreased POMC primary transcript levels. The effects of CRF on the POMC primary transcript and nuclear processing intermediate were not potentiated by cotreatment with AVP, although a potentiation of CRF-stimulated ACTH release was observed. POMC nuclear and cytoplasmic mRNA levels were not affected by these 2-h or less treatments, while an 18-h incubation with 0.5 nM CRF alone or in combination with 100 nM AVP increased POMC cytoplasmic mRNA levels to about 140% of vehicle-treated control values. When a 1-h AVP treatment (100 nM) preceded presentation of CRF, we observed an attenuation of the stimulation of POMC primary transcript and processing intermediate levels by the 1-h CRF treatment. The effects of CRF on POMC primary transcript and processing intermediate levels in these experiments are consistent with a CRF-induced increase in POMC gene transcription. Our findings that AVP decreased primary transcript levels and attenuated the effects of CRF on this end point suggest that: 1) AVP clearly does not act in a synergistic manner with CRF to stimulate POMC gene expression; and 2) AVP possibly affects RNA stability and/or processing.\r"

  ".U": "90059785\r", 
  ".W": "The insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are small peptides that are present in serum and extracellular fluids and stimulate the growth of many cell types. In extracellular fluids the IGFs are bound to carrier proteins that are believed to modify the biological actions of the IGFs. At least three structurally distinct IGF-binding proteins (IGF-BPs) have been identified, and the serum concentrations of one of these has been shown to be regulated by pituitary GH. We report here that this GH responsive protein [39,000-45,000 mol wt (Mr)] can be induced (7-fold) by infusion of IGF-I in hypophysectomized rats or (3.5-fold) in protein-deprived rats, whereas two other forms of IGF-BP (e.g. 31,000-34,000 and 24,000 Mr) showed no change in the hypophysectomized animals and minimal increases in the protein-deprived animals. Likewise, GH injections in hypophysectomized animals resulted in a 7-fold increase in the 39,000-45,000 Mr form and no change in the 31,000-34,000 and 24,000 Mr forms. The protein-deprived animals showed a 3.2-fold increase in the 39,000-45,000 Mr and 2.4- to 1.8-fold increases in the 31,000-34,000 and 24,000 Mr forms, respectively. Changes in the larger Mr IGF-BP in these experimental models are paralleled by changes in serum IGF-I, suggesting that the GH dependence of the former protein is mediated at least partially via IGF-I. Our findings also suggest that the secretion of IGF-I and at least one IGF-BP may be linked, providing a mechanism by which their extracellular fluid concentrations are coordinated. Because IGF-BPs are present in extracellular fluids and can modulate IGF-I-receptor interaction, induction of this protein may be an important mediator of IGF action.\r"

In this study, Man 6-P receptors were isolated from [35S]methionine-labeled germ cells and Sertoli cells by phosphomannan-Sepharose affinity chromatography and were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Mouse pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids isolated by unit gravity sedimentation synthesized predominantly the 46,000 mol wt (Mr) cation-dependent Man 6-P receptor and only low levels of the 270,000 Mr cation-independent Man 6-P receptor. In contrast, Sertoli cells synthesized substantial amounts of the cation-independent Man 6-P receptor, but little of the cation-dependent receptor. To determine if these receptors function on the cell surface, we have monitored Man 6-P receptor-mediated endocytosis in isolated germ cells and Sertoli cells. In pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids, [125I]Man 6-P-bearing ligands were internalized and processed to lower Mr forms by an endocytic mechanism that was time dependent, proportional to cell number, and inhibited by Man 6-P. Like germ cells, Sertoli cells in primary culture endocytosed radiolabeled Man 6-P-bearing ligands at levels that were about 10% of the endocytic activity measured for 3T3 fibroblasts. This low endocytic activity correlates with the levels of the cation-independent Man 6-P receptor synthesized by germ cells, but not with the higher levels synthesized by Sertoli cells. Membrane binding assays verified the high steady state levels of the cation-independent Man 6-P receptor in Sertoli cells, suggesting that the low endocytic activity detected in these cells may result from restricted expression of the cation-independent receptor on the cell surface. These results indicate that both spermatogenic and Sertoli cells have surface Man P-6 receptors capable of mediating endocytosis. However, these cells exhibit marked differences in the expression of the cation-independent and -dependent Man 6-P receptors, perhaps reflecting differential roles of these receptors in protein trafficking and/or intercellular communication during germ cell differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "The time course of changes in the physical properties of both the uterine and vaginal portions of the cervix were studied during the last two thirds (days 40 to approximately 115) of pregnancy in the gilt. To obtain insight concerning the hormonal control of these physical changes, serum levels of relaxin, estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, and progesterone were also determined. Throughout midpregnancy, the extensibility (softness), lumen diameter, and wet weight of the uterine portion of the cervix were less than those of the vaginal portion of the cervix. After day 80, marked and sustained increases in these three physical parameters occurred in the uterine portion of the cervix whereas slight (extensibility) or moderate (lumen diameter and wet weight) increases occurred in the vaginal portion of the cervix. By day 110, extensibility, lumen diameter, and wet weight of the uterine portion of the cervix were similar to those of the vaginal portion of the cervix. Because the uterine portion of the cervix has a relatively firm consistency and small lumen throughout most of pregnancy, we conclude that it probably plays a more important role than the vaginal portion of the cervix in protecting the uterus and its contents during pregnancy. The marked changes in the physical properties of the uterine portion of the cervix are temporally correlated with elevated serum estrogen levels (days 80-100) or estrogen and relaxin levels (day 100 to term). We conclude that estrogen or, more likely, estrogen and relaxin in combination may promote the modifications in the physical properties of the cervix that occur during the last 35 days of gestation.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of relaxin on the physical properties of both the uterine and vaginal portions of the cervix were studied between days 80 and 110 of pregnancy in ovariectomized gilts given progesterone to maintain pregnancy. In controls gilts the extensibility, lumen diameter, and wet weight of the uterine portion of the cervix were less than those of the vaginal portion of the cervix on day 80, but increased thereafter, and by day 110 did not differ (extensibility and wet weight) or approached (lumen diameter) those values of the vaginal portion of the cervix. When gilts were ovariectomized on either days 80 or 100 and given progesterone only (groups OP-100 and OP-110) extensibility, lumen diameter, and wet weight failed to increase in both the uterine and vaginal portions of the cervix. After replacement therapy with progesterone plus relaxin (groups OPR-100 and OPR-110), extensibility, lumen diameter, and wet weight increased to values as least as large as those in control groups in both portions of the cervix. In all groups the uterine portion of the cervix changed more dramatically than the vaginal portion. After hormone replacement therapy, blood levels of relaxin were moderately higher, and blood levels of progesterone were somewhat lower than those in control gilts. There was little or no difference in estrogen levels between ovariectomized and control gilts. We conclude that relaxin plays an important role in promoting increased growth and extensibility in both the uterine and vaginal portions of the cervix after day 80 of gestation in the gilt.\r"

  ".U": "90059790\r", 
  ".W": "A sex-dependent metabolism of aldosterone has been reported in intact rats. To further characterize the hepatic elimination of aldosterone and its sex dependence, the metabolism of d-[4-14C]aldosterone was studied in isolated perfused liver from male and female Wistar rats, from male rats castrated 3 weeks before experiments, and from younger male rats (same body weight as the female rats). The livers were perfused at a constant flow rate in a recirculating mode with a hemoglobin-free medium containing aldosterone at initially 1 nM. Perfusate aldosterone was measured by a specific RIA. Total 4-14C radio-activity in perfusate and bile was determined. The perfusate [4-14C]aldosterone radiometabolite concentration was calculated. The radiometabolite pattern in additional experiments was studied by HPLC. The male rats exhibited 10% higher systolic blood pressure (P less than 0.05) and 51% higher fasting values of plasma aldosterone (P less than 0.05) compared to those in the female rats. In female rats the hepatic clearance rate of aldosterone per 100 g BW was 72% higher than that in male rats (11.2 +/- 2.7 to 6.5 +/- 1.8 ml/min: P less than 0.01), and that expressed per g liver wet wt was 75% higher (3.5 +/- 1.0 to 2.0 +/- 0.7 ml/min; P less than 0.01). When female rats were compared to younger male rats with the same body weight, 33% higher hepatic aldosterone clearance rates were still found in female rats (21.0 +/- 5.4 to 15.8 +/- 3.2 ml/min; P less than 0.05), and 51% higher values when expressed per g liver wet wt (3.5 +/- 1.0 to 2.3 +/- 0.5 ml/min; P less than 0.01). No difference in the aldosterone clearance rate was observed in castrated male rats compared to that in noncastrated male rats. 4-14C-Labeled radiometabolite levels accumulated similarly in the perfusate of livers of both sexes. Perfusate 4-14C-labeled radiometabolites after 90 min of perfusion were lower in livers of castrated male rats than in noncastrated male rats (P less than 0.001). The final perfusate 14C-labeled radiometabolite concentration correlated inversely with the total 14C in bile (P less than 0.01). All 14C-labeled radiometabolites detected in perfusate and bile after 90 min were more polar than aldosterone. After enzymatic hydrolysis, some of the metabolites from the male livers cochromatographed with tetrahydro- and dihydroaldosterone, while other fractions remained more polar. Only more polar metabolites were detected in the perfusate and bile of female livers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Associated with the generalized uterine growth stimulated by estradiol in the rat are specific responses including messenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis, protein synthesis, and peroxidase activity. The increase in peroxidase activity, although sensitive to inhibitors of RNA and protein synthesis, results from an estradiol-stimulated influx of eosinophils into the uterus. We postulated the existence of an estradiol-regulated uterine chemotactic factor, testing this by an in vitro chemotactic assay with eosinophils isolated from mature rats. Treatment of immature rats with 1 microgram estradiol for 24 h resulted in a significant increase in eosinophil chemotaxis compared to uterine extracts of vehicle-treated rats. This increase was seen as early as 3 h after estradiol administration and was maximal at 24 h. The magnitude of the chemotactic response was dependent on the dose of estradiol administered (1-100 micrograms). Estrone or estriol treatment resulted in chemotactic activity greater than control but less than estradiol. Direct addition of estradiol to extracts of control animals did not increase chemotaxis. The estradiol-stimulated chemotaxis was blocked by in vivo treatment with the antiestrogen tamoxifen and by inhibitors of RNA and protein synthesis. Analysis of extracts from estradiol-treated uteri shows that the chemotactic factor is heat labile, pronase sensitive, and has a mass of approximately 20 kilodaltons (kDa). These data suggest that the estradiol-stimulated influx of eosinophils into the rat uterus is mediated by the synthesis, modification, or release of a protein whose synthesis is estradiol receptor mediated.\r"

  ".W": "Transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF alpha) promotes DNA synthesis in adult rat hepatocytes, an effect opposed by picomolar concentrations of TGF beta. Recently, the presence of these growth factors in fetal rat liver has been demonstrated. Since a regulatory role for TGF alpha and TGF beta in fetal hepatic growth requires the presence of high affinity receptors, the receptors for these hormones were studied in membranes from normal fetuses at 17-21 days gestational age and growth-retarded fetuses of mothers fasted for 48 h. Fetal liver membranes bound [125I]epidermal growth factor ([125I]EGF) with high affinity (Kd = 1-2 nM). TGF alpha could compete with EGF for the same binding site, albeit at 4-fold lower affinity. EGF receptor number increased from nearly undetectable levels at 17 days to adult levels (0.15-0.3 nmol/mg membrane protein) by 21 days. Affinity labeling of fetal liver membranes with [125I]TGF alpha identified the 170,000 mol wt (Mr) EGF receptor. The intensity of labeling correlated with EGF receptor number based on binding analyses. TGF beta bound to fetal liver membranes with high affinity (Kd = 30 pM) and at a level (20-30 pmol/mg throughout late gestation) that was 3-fold higher than in adult liver. Affinity labeling of fetal hepatic membranes with [125I]TGF demonstrated high affinity 85,000 Mr TGF beta receptors and lower affinity 66,000 and 130,000 Mr receptors. Although TGF beta binding did not change with advancing gestation, affinity labeling of the 85,000 Mr protein doubled from day 18 to day 21 and was decreased by 50% in fetuses from fasted mothers. These data, demonstrating the presence and regulation of the receptors for TGF alpha and TGF beta, support roles for these hormones in the regulation of fetal hepatic growth.\r"

Immunoprecipitated receptors isolated from oviduct slices incubated in the presence of H(3)32PO4 exhibited hormone-dependent phosphorylation. This was correlated with an increase in the apparent mol wt of receptors when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and increased DNA binding of total cytosolic receptors. Further, in vivo progesterone treatment resulted in dissociation of both the A and B receptor forms from nonhormone-binding proteins (such as heat shock protein-90) in vitro when analyzed by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. The 4S and 8S receptors were separated by phosphocellulose column chromatography, treated with ammonium sulfate to convert all receptors to DNA-binding forms, and analyzed for binding to DNA cellulose. The 4S receptor produced as a consequence of in vivo hormone treatment had a 3.35-fold higher affinity for DNA and bound to about a 3-fold greater extent than receptor that did not show altered interaction with other proteins. Thus, in vivo progesterone treatment results in increased receptor phosphorylation, altered interaction with heat shock protein-90, and increased DNA binding.\r"

  ".W": "Cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1), mediate many inflammatory and cellular responses. However, the effects of TNF and IL-1 on basal and angiotensin-II (AII)-stimulated aldosterone synthesis are not known. We studied the effect of recombinant and purified TNF and IL-1 on basal as well as AII-, ACTH-, and K+-induced aldosterone synthesis in isolated rat adrenal glomerulosa cells. Since we have previously shown that AII action is mediated by activation of the 12-lipoxygenase (12LO) pathway of arachidonic acid, we also evaluated the effects of these cytokines on the 12LO product 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12HETE) using a validated RIA technique. TNF at 2.5 and 5.0 ng/ml produced a dose-dependent inhibition of AII-induced aldosterone synthesis [AII, 39.0 +/- 3.3 ng/10(6) cells.h; AII plus TNF (5.0 ng/ml), 14.3 +/- 1.6; P less than 0.001 vs. AII; AII plus TNF (2.5 ng/ml), 24.7 +/- 3.2; P less than 0.01 vs. AII]. Similarly, TNF at 5.0 ng/ml also attenuated the stimulatory effect of ACTH (10(-9) M). However, K+-induced aldosterone synthesis was not altered. TNF also did not alter basal aldosterone levels. AII, as previously shown, stimulates 12HETE synthesis (basal, 608 +/- 114 pg/10(5) cells.h; versus AII, 1268 +/- 197; P less than 0.02). TNF at concentrations of 1.0-5.0 ng/ml produced a dose-dependent inhibition of AII stimulatory action on 12HETE synthesis [AII plus TNF (1.0 ng/ml), 650 +/- 26 pg, P less than 0.03 vs. AII; AII plus TNF (5.0 ng/ml), 390 +/- 46; P less than 0.01 vs. AII plus TNF (1.0 ng/ml)]. In addition, 12HETE at 10(-8) M completely restored the effects of AII during blockage by TNF. Purified human IL-1 (75% beta, 25% alpha) as well as recombinant human IL-1 beta at concentrations as low as 50 pg/ml inhibited AII-induced aldosterone synthesis. IL-1 beta did not alter ACTH- or K+-induced aldosterone synthesis and, in fact, had a tendency to potentiate ACTH effects. These results suggest that the cytokines TNF and IL-1 are potent inhibitors, particularly of AII action in the adrenal glomerulosa cell. Therefore, local or systemically produced TNF or IL-1 may be important negative modulators of aldosterone synthesis.\r"

In the present study we examined the role of the 5LO pathway on AII-induced aldosterone secretion in rat glomerulosa cells in vitro. The 5LO product 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5HETE) and its unstable precursor 5-hydroxyperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid did not significantly alter basal aldosterone secretion in concentrations from 10(-9)-10(-7) M. In contrast, 5HETE reduced peak AII-induced aldosterone production from 59.1 +/- 9.0 to 37.96 +/- 7.2 ng/10(6) cells (P less than 0.01). This was accompanied by inhibition of the AII-stimulated rise in 12HETE production (10(-9)M AII, 160 +/- 4% of control; 10(-9) M AII plus 10(-7) M 5HETE, 90 +/- 1% of control production). However, 5HETE had no effect on the aldosterone response to potassium or ACTH, secretagogues that cause no activation of the 12LO pathway. These results suggest that the 5LO product 5HETE can selectively modulate AII-dependent aldosterone secretion. Further, the selective inhibitory effect of 5HETE on the AII effect in rat glomerulosa cells may be exerted by blockade of arachidonate metabolism via the 12LO pathway. These results suggest that the 5LO pathway may negatively modulate AII action in the adrenal zona glomerulosa.\r"

Additionally, the role of adrenergic-dependent pathways in mediating Il-1-induced ACTH release has been assessed. The iv or intracerebroventricular injection of either Il-1 alpha or Il-1 beta caused dose-related increases in plasma ACTH, epinephrine, and norepinephrine levels. While at low iv doses (less than or equal to 10 ng), Il-1 beta was more effective than Il-1 alpha at releasing ACTH, no measurable differences were noted at higher doses. In contrast, Il-1 beta was significantly more active at all doses in elevating plasma ACTH levels after intracerebroventricular injection. Similarly, Il-1 alpha was more effective than Il-1 beta at stimulating epinephrine, but not norepinephrine, secretion after icv injection. Because of the ability of catecholamines to alter ACTH secretion, we then examined the role of adrenergic-dependent pathways as possible mediators of Il-1-induced ACTH secretion. Blockade of adrenergic receptors by the concomitant administration of prazosin and propanolol prevented the simultaneous actions of phenylephrine and isoproterenol on the corticotrophs, but did not significantly alter the effect of peripherally administered Il-1 alpha on ACTH release. These results suggest that both Il-1 alpha and Il-1 beta stimulate ACTH and catecholamine secretion in the rat. Despite the ability of the lymphokine to elevate plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine values, circulating catecholamines do not appear to represent essential modulators of ACTH release induced by acutely injected Il-1.\r"

The goal was to evaluate if this second site was on the glucocorticoid receptor and, if so, on what region of that protein. The magnitude of acceleration of dissociation was assessed during purification of the receptor as well as with the untransformed (multimeric), transformed (monomeric), and mero-receptor. In each preparation progesterone caused a statistically significant increase in the rate of agonist dissociation. The documentation of acceleration of dissociation during purification suggests that progesterone one is interacting with a site on the glucocorticoid receptor and not with another protein. Evidence for the second binding site was found using each form of the receptor, untransformed, transformed, and mero-receptor, suggesting that the second binding site resides on the steroid-binding domain of the receptor which is on the carboxy-terminus, topographically close to the agonist-binding site.\r"

There was a significantly increased membrane lipid peroxidation in diabetic erythrocytes compared with nondiabetic erythrocytes. The degree of membrane lipid peroxidative damage in erythrocytes was significantly correlated with the level of glycosylated hemoglobin, an index of mean glucose level for the preceding 3-4 mo.

The prevalence of elevated urinary albumin levels in the total Nauruan population was very high: 26 and 30% of men and women, respectively, had microalbuminuria, whereas 13% of both sexes had macroalbuminuria. Of the subjects with macroalbuminuria, 66% had diabetes. The prevalence increased with worsening glucose tolerance; 26% of subjects with normal glucose tolerance had either micro- or macroalbuminuria, increasing to 43% of subjects with impaired glucose tolerance, 63% of newly diagnosed diabetic subjects, and 75% of previously diagnosed diabetic subjects. Associations between elevated urinary albumin concentration and putative risk factors were assessed for both the total population (n = 1184) and the diabetic subgroup alone (n = 318). Fasting plasma glucose and hypertension were the most important independent correlates for the whole population, whereas plasma creatinine was also important in diabetic subjects. Age at onset and duration of diabetes were not found to be significantly associated with elevated albumin concentration. In subjects with normal glucose tolerance, hypertension and hyperuricemia were the most important associated factors. These results suggest that blood glucose, blood pressure, and possibly obesity and plasma uric acid are important modifiable risk factors for both micro- and macroalbuminuria in this population.\r"

Five categories of nondiabetic glucose tolerance were defined according to fasting plasma glucose (FPG) values (mM) and 1- and 2-h plasma glucose values (PG1 and PG2, respectively) after oral glucose load: 1) normal by WHO and NDDG (FPG less than 6.4 mM, PG1 less than 11.1 mM, PG2 less than 7.8 mM), 2) Normal by WHO, nondiagnostic by NDDG (FPG 6.4-7.7 mM, PG1 less than 11.1 mM, PG2 less than 7.8 mM), 3) normal by WHO, nondiagnostic by NDDG (FPG less than 7.8 mM, PG1 greater than or equal to 11.1 mM, PG2 less than 7.8 mM), 4) IGT by WHO, nondiagnostic by NDDG (FPG less than 7.8 mM, PG1 less than 11.1 mM, PG2 7.8-11.0 mM), and 5) IGT by WHO and NDDG (FPG less than 7.8 mM, PG1 greater than or equal to 11.1 mM, PG2 7.8-11.0 mM). Established markers of abnormal glucose tolerance were also measured, including glycosylated hemoglobulin A1, insulin response, plasma triglycerides, serum uric acid, and rate of hypertension in Israel as well as rates of hypertension, peripheral vascular involvement, family history of diabetes, and history of cholelithiasis in the U.S. Accounting for potential confounders, levels of these markers in both national samples were similar in categories 1 and 2 and in categories 3-5.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Basal and yellow fever vaccination-induced 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (2',5'A) activity was determined in blood mononuclear cells (peripheral blood lymphocytes [PBLs]) from insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and matched control subjects. The live attenuated yellow fever vaccine represented a primary stimulus in all subjects. First, basal 2',5'A activity increased severalfold in response to yellow fever vaccination. In IDDM subjects, this increase was significantly lower (P = .025). Second, the 2',5'A activity increased proportionately to the higher basal 2',5'A activity in IDDM subjects. In control subjects, the increase in 2',5'A activity was not dependent on the basal activity. There was no relationship between basal or stimulated 2',5'A activity and age, sex, duration of IDDM, age at onset of IDDM, metabolic control, or HLA-DQ beta-chain gene polymorphism. There is a direct relationship between 2',5'A activity and latent viral infections associated with the presence of double-stranded RNA and with cellular interferons (IFNs) formed in response to viral infections. The higher basal 2',5'A activity (P = .05) in relation to the stimulated activity may therefore signify a latent infection or the presence of double-stranded RNA in PBLs of IDDM subjects. In vitro stimulation of PBLs showed increased IFN sensitivity in IDDM subjects. Analysis of 2',5'A activity is proposed to be a sensitive measure of the activation of the IFN system and the level of latent infectivity.\r"

Endocrine cells storing immunoreactive components respectively similar to somatostatin 14, the amino-terminal portion (1-14) of somatostatin 28, gastrin-cholecystokinin, and peptide YY were distributed throughout the acini. Peptidergic nerve structures contained materials immunologically related to vasoactive intestinal peptide, peptide histidine methionine, substance P, neuropeptide Y, and gastrin-releasing peptide. The latter peptide was detected in discrete fibers running into the acini but within no cell body in the submucosa. All other neuropeptides were stored in fibers, isolated or grouped in bundles, and in perikarya of submucosal ganglia close to the acini. No immunoreactive structures were detected using antisera directed against pancreatic polypeptide, secretin, motilin, neurotensin, or calcitonin gene-related peptide. The results suggest that several regulatory peptides may be involved in the control of Brunner's glands in humans.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of exercise on large intestinal function has been determined in 14 healthy but normally sedentary men and women, aged 22-34 yr while on a constant diet. For an initial 3-5-wk period (control) no activity was allowed. Six subjects then undertook a 9-wk training schedule by the end of which they were capable of jogging for 1 h per day, 5 days a week. A further 6 subjects undertook a similar training schedule that lasted for only 7 wk, at the end of which they were jogging for 45 min per day. Finally, 2 subjects were studied continuously while taking light exercise for 6 wk and then jogging for a further 3 wk. Physical fitness was monitored and showed significant changes with maximum aerobic capacity increasing from 2.4 +/- 0.5 to 3.1 +/- 0.4 L/min, maximum heart rate after a step test falling from 152 +/- 8 to 129 +/- 5 beats per minute, and resting pulse rate also falling from 56 +/- 4 to 50 +/- 5 beats per minute. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol also increased significantly. Colonic function was assessed by measurement of stool weight and transit time, using the continuous radiopaque marker technique, fecal pH, nitrogen excretion, and ammonia concentration. No change was observed overall in mean daily fecal weight [124 +/- 39 (control) and 129 +/- 49 g/day (exercise)], transit time [55 +/- 20 (control), 54 +/- 23 h (exercise)], nor in fecal frequency, dry stool weight, pH, ammonia, or total nitrogen excretion. Significant changes did occur in 5 individuals with significant slowing of transit time in 2 and speeding up in 3. Overall transit time increased in 9 subjects and decreased in 5; hence, when diet is constant, exercise has marked effects on physical fitness but no consistent effect on large bowel function.\r"

  ".W": "Prostaglandins and thromboxanes are increased in human and experimental colitis, but the factors that regulate this enhanced production are unclear. The present studies evaluate the effects of the monokines, interleukin-1 alpha and beta on eicosanoid production in rabbit colon. In tissue incubations the peak dose response of eicosanoid release to human recombinant interleukin-1 is 50 ng/ml. Interleukin-1 alpha increases prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by 4.5 +/- 1.9 ng/g tissue, 6-keto PGF1 alpha by 6.2 +/- 2.7 ng/g, and thromboxane B2 by 2.1 +/- 0.3 ng/g compared to placebo. In isolated rabbit colons perfused with Krebs' solution, 10-h infusion of interleukin-1 alpha (50 ng/ml) progressively increases production of PGE2, 6-keto PGF1 alpha, and thromboxane B2. Bolus injections of bradykinin increase production of PGE2, but not 6-keto PGF1 alpha and thromboxane B2, and these responses are markedly augmented by interleukin-1 alpha: at 10 h bradykinin-stimulated PGE2 production is 518 +/- 104 vs. 95 +/- 18 ng/5 min (p less than 0.005), 6-keto PGF1 alpha is 172 +/- 88 vs. 8 +/- 2 ng/5 min (p less than 0.02), and thromboxane B2 is 60 +/- 14 vs. 13 +/- 4 ng/5 min (p less than 0.02) for interleukin-treated colons vs. placebo-treated colons, respectively. The response is greater with interleukin-1 alpha than interleukin-1 beta. This study demonstrates that interleukin-1 stimulates prostaglandin and thromboxane production in normal colon tissue. These data are consistent with the concept that interleukin-1 production by inflammatory cells may augment prostaglandin and thromboxane production in colitis.\r"

  ".U": "90060575\r", 
  ".W": "We developed a monoclonal antibody, 28.2, that binds specifically to the amidated carboxyl terminal region common to gastrin and cholecystokinin. This immunoglobulin G1 antibody has high affinity (ID50 = 30-70 pM for gastrin and cholecystokinin peptides), binds labeled gastrin similarly at 37 degrees C and 4 degrees C, and shows minimal inhibition of binding in the presence of 40% canine serum. Antibody 28.2 was used to carry out in vivo immunoneutralization studies in 8 dogs previously prepared with chronic gastric fistulas. Preliminary studies revealed that a single intravenous dose of 0.75 mg of partially purified immunoglobulin G of monoclonal antibody 28.2 completely inhibited the acid stimulatory effect of exogenous gastrin-17 given intravenously at 200 pmol/kg.h, a physiologic dose, and inhibited by 70% the acid response to a supraphysiologic dose, 800 pmol/kg.h. The same dose of antibody decreased the acid secretory response obtained during distention of the stomach with 300 ml of 5.8% glucose solution by 98% and decreased the response to distention with 300 ml of 8% peptone solution by 68%. A 10-fold higher dose of antibody decreased the acid response to peptone by 96%. The gastrin antibody had no effect on the acid response to exogenous histamine. A control antibody, specific for the biologically inactive glycine-extended gastrin/cholecystokinin peptapeptide region, had no significant effect on gastric acid secretion stimulated by gastrin or by gastric distention with nutrients. These studies indicate that circulating gastrin is of major importance in the gastric phase of gastric acid stimulation caused by distention of the stomach with nutrients.\r"

Increasing radial stretch to the caudad end elicited increasing ascending contraction only, whereas increasing radial stretch to the orad end elicited increasing descending relaxation only. Both components were abolished by hexamethonium, implying the participation of cholinergic interneurons in each component. Atropine inhibited ascending contraction only, abolishing the response to low grades of stretch and partially inhibiting the response to high grades of stretch (69% +/- 17%, p less than 0.01). The substance P antagonist [D-Pro2, D-Trp7,9] substance P partially inhibited ascending contraction induced by high grades of stretch only (40% +/- 12%, p less than 0.02). The vasoactive intestinal peptide antagonist [4-Cl-D-Phe6, Leu17]vasoactive intestinal peptide inhibited descending relaxation, abolishing the response to low grades of stretch and partially inhibiting the response to high grades of stretch (40% +/- 4%, p less than 0.001). Release of vasoactive intestinal peptide increased significantly by 91% during descending relaxation only, whereas release of both substance P and substance K increased significantly by 107% during ascending contraction only, supporting the participation of vasoactive intestinal peptide motor neurons in descending relaxation and tachykinin motor neurons as well as cholinergic motor neurons in ascending contraction. The components of the human peristaltic reflex and transmitters regulating them were identical to those found in rat and guinea pig intestine.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of leukotrienes (LTs) B4, C4, and D4 on acid production by enriched (80%-85%) rat parietal cells were investigated. Acid production was indirectly measured by [14C]aminopyrine uptake into the cells. Leukotriene B4 (10(-10)-10(-6) mol/L) had no effect on basal or prestimulated [14C]aminopyrine uptake. Leukotriene C4 and LTD4 (10(-10)-10(-6) mol/L) also did not change basal acid production but potentiated prestimulated [14C]aminopyrine uptake. Maximal effects were observed with 1 x 10(-7) mol/L LTC4 or with 3 x 10(-7) mol/L LTD4. At these concentrations LTC4 and LTD4 induced the indicated increases above the responses to the following prestimulants (= 100%): 10(-4) mol/L histamine (71% and 74%, respectively), 10(-5) mol/L forskolin (54% and 106%), 10(-4) mol/L dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (34% and 81%), and 10(-4) mol/L carbamylcholine (160% and 116%). Yet, adenosine triphosphate (2.5-5 x 10(-3) mol/L)-induced [14C]aminopyrine uptake in digitonin-permeabilized parietal cells was not further increased by LTC4 or LTD4. At 10(-5) mol/L the selective LTD4 antagonist L-660,711 (MK-571) reduced the effect of 3 x 10(-7) mol/L LTD4 by 74% but had no effect on the potentiation by LTC4. We conclude that the sulfidopeptide LTs C4 and D4, but not LTB4, exert a direct effect on rat parietal cells, and that this effect seems to be mediated by separate specific receptors. Leukotriene C4 and LTD4 potentiate prestimulated H+ formation by interacting with an intracellular mechanism that is commonly activated upon occupation of histamine H2- as well as muscarinic receptors, and that is also activated by the postreceptor stimuli forskolin and dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate; yet, this mechanism seems to be localized proximal to the H+,K+-adenosine triphosphatase.\r"

The aim of the present study was to determine whether activation of the complement system is present in patients with this disease, as this would be supportive evidence of a role for circulating immune complexes in primary sclerosing cholangitis. Plasma complement fragments C3d and C4d, and serum C3 and C4, their respective parent molecules, have been assayed. Both C3d and C4d were elevated in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis compared with patients with extrahepatic obstructive cholestasis and normal controls (p less than 0.01 in all instances). C3 was elevated in both patient groups, in whom it was similar, compared with normal controls (p less than 0.001 in both cases), whereas C4 was similar in all groups. Elevated levels of circulating immune complexes were identified in 21 of 24 (88%) patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, but in none of the normal controls. These findings support the hypothesis that in primary sclerosing cholangitis circulating immune complexes are associated with activation of complement via the classical pathway.\r"

To measure a possible etiologic association, 51 women with Crohn's disease who were 18-50 yr old were studied and compared with peer-nominated age- and sex-matched controls. There were no differences between cases and controls with respect to race, religion, marital status, and number of pregnancies. There was no association between oral contraceptive use and Crohn's disease incidence [current use: odds ratio (OR) 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34-1.59; former use: OR 1.80, CI 0.61-5.29; current or former use: OR 1.00, CI 0.46-2.16]. Stratifying by disease location also failed to identify an association. Cigarette smoking was significantly associated with Crohn's disease incidence. Controlling for possible confounding effects of cigarette smoking did not alter the lack of association between oral contraceptive use and Crohn's disease. Similarly, testing for interaction failed to demonstrate any effect modification. Analyzing for duration of current oral contraceptive use or time interval since last use failed to demonstrate a \"dose-response\" effect. The study was of sufficient size to detect statistical significance for oral contraceptive use for odds ratios of greater than or equal to 2.76. From this community-based matched case-control study, there was no association between oral contraceptive use and Crohn's disease, and women need not be advised to discontinue oral contraceptive use when a diagnosis of Crohn's disease is made.\r"

Initial conductance amounted to approximately 27 mS/cm2. In the presence of serosal or bilateral HCO3- (20 mM), it fell to approximately 15 mS/cm2 within 60 min. With mucosal HCO3- or HCO3- -free solutions, conductance decreased to only approximately 23 mS/cm2. In the absence of HCO3-, serosal but not mucosal addition of HCO3- prompted a steep conductance drop that was 50% complete within 6 min. These effects were the same in proximal and distal segments, whereas conductance levels in the latter were higher. The effects of HCO3- required serosal Na+; they were partly prevented or reversed by serosal ouabain (3 x 10(-5) M), furosemide (10(-3) M), and other loop diuretics, and indomethacin (10(-5) M). Serosal addition of prostaglandin E2 (10(-7) M, followed by 10(-6) M) reduced conductance from approximately 22 to approximately 17 mS/cm2. This effect required serosal HCO3- and the presence of indomethacin. 8-Br-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (10(-3)M, serosal side) mimicked the effects of prostaglandin E2. Indomethacin and prostaglandin E2 did not influence the secretory flux of HCO3- (approximately 0.5 mumol/cm2.h, pH-stat method). Our results assign a critical role to serosal HCO3- in the maintenance of a low tissue permeability, dependent on the availability of prostaglandins (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) and involving HCO3- access to the cell rather than secretion.\r"

After that time propulsive behavior returned to normal. The objective in the investigation reported here was to determine if jejunal responsiveness to an infection is influenced by prior exposure to the parasite. Accordingly, jejunal propulsion was examined in guinea pigs reinfected 2 mo after the initial inoculation with the parasite. Propulsive behavior was measured in vitro by attaching oral and aboral ends of jejunal segments to a propulsion evaluation system that imposed input-output conditions of constant capacitance and negligible resistance. Propulsive complexes produced by segments removed from animals 60 days after primary inoculation were generally similar in configuration to those produced by segments from uninfected hosts. The pronounced net aboral propulsive behavior previously observed 10-20 days after primary infection was not observed in segments from animals 60 days postinfection or from uninfected controls. After secondary inoculation the fluid volume expelled per propulsive complex began to increase within 1 day and net aboral propulsive behavior was clearly evident 2 days postinoculation. As net aboral propulsive behavior was induced approximately five times faster after secondary as compared with primary inoculation with T. spiralis, it is evident that the overall intrinsic mechanisms that are responsible for an earlier onset of net aboral propulsive behavior are responsive for at least 2 mo after initial exposure to the parasite.\r"

Movements of the hyoid and larynx, dimensions of sphincter opening, and intraluminal sphincter pressure were determined at 1/30th-s intervals during swallows of 1, 5, 10, and 20 ml of liquid barium. Our analysis subdivided upper esophageal sphincter activity during swallowing into five phases: (a) relaxation, (b) opening, (c) distention, (d) collapse, and (e) closure. Sphincter relaxation occurred during laryngeal elevation and preceded opening by a mean period of 0.1 s. Opening occurred as the sphincter was pulled apart via muscular attachments to the hyoid such that the hyoid coordinates at which sphincter opening and closing occurred were constant among bolus volumes. Sphincter distention after opening was modulated by intrabolus pressures rather than graded hyoid movement. The generation of intrabolus pressure coincided with the posterior thrust of the tongue that culminated in pharyngeal wall contact and the initiation of pharyngeal peristalsis. Larger volume swallows were associated with greater intrabolus pressure and increased bolus head velocity. The duration of sphincter opening increased in conjunction with a prolongation of the anterior-superior excursion of the hyoid and a delay in the onset of pharyngeal peristalsis (the event that determined the timing of sphincter closure). We conclude that transsphincteric transport of increasing swallow bolus volumes is accomplished by modulating sphincter diameter, opening interval, and flow rate (reflected by bolus head velocity). Furthermore, upper esophageal sphincter opening is an active mechanical event rather than simply a consequence of cricopharyngeal relaxation.\r"

Of the 25, 14 had cholesterol stones, 7 had macroscopic cholesterolosis, and 4 had cholesterol crystals. There were no differences in basal active tension among these groups, but the force of spontaneous phasic contractions was reduced in gallbladders with cholesterol stones, cholesterolosis, and cholesterol crystals compared with specimens with pigment stones (p less than 0.001). The forces developed in response to cholecystokinin-8 (10(-10)-10(-6) M), acetylcholine (10(-7)-10(-3) M), and potassium chloride (20-60 mM) were greater in strips from specimens with pigment stones than in strips from specimens with cholesterol stones or cholesterolosis (p less than 0.001). In cholesterol stones and cholesterolosis specimens, relatively strong muscle strips had similar responses to 10(-6) M cholecystokinin-8 in normal calcium (2.5 mM) and in the absence of extracellular calcium. Weaker muscle strips had a reduced response to cholecystokinin-8 in the absence of extracellular calcium (p less than 0.01). It is concluded that muscle strips exposed to bile with excess cholesterol have a reduced contractility compared with muscle strips from specimens with pigment stones; this impaired contractility precedes gallstone formation, and results from muscle dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "The present work tested the hypothesis that portal venous bile acids regulate the activity of the cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase and studied the influence of hepatic microsomal free cholesterol concentration on the enzyme activity. Operative liver biopsies and samples of portal venous blood were obtained from a total of 61 patients with gallstones who were undergoing cholecystectomy. Fifteen of the patients were treated with cholestyramine (16 g/day) for 2-3 wk before operation and 23 patients with chenodeoxycholic acid (15 mg/kg.day) or ursodeoxycholic acid (15 mg/kg.day) for 3-4 wk before operation. Highly accurate methods based on isotope dilution-mass spectrometry were used for assay of the cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity, the concentration of free cholesterol in the microsomes, and the levels of individual bile acids in portal venous blood. Cholestyramine treatment increased the cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity about sixfold, from 7.6 +/- 1.1 (mean +/- SEM) to 45.7 +/- 6.7 pmol/min.mg protein. Administration of chenodeoxycholic acid reduced the enzyme activity considerably to 1.0 +/- 0.3 pmol/min.mg protein, whereas ursodeoxycholic acid did not significantly affect the enzyme activity (7.9 +/- 2.2 pmol/min.mg protein). The concentration of microsomal free cholesterol remained essentially unchanged in spite of a 45-fold variation in enzyme activity. There was a negative correlation between the absolute as well as the relative concentration of chenodeoxycholic acid in portal blood and the activity of the cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, whereas there was no correlation between the total concentration of bile acids and the enzyme activity. It is concluded that the composition of individual bile acids may be more important than the total concentration of bile acids in the portal vein for the regulation of the cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity in humans. It is further concluded that chenodeoxycholic acid is a considerably stronger suppressor of bile acid synthesis than ursodeoxycholic acid.\r"

  ".W": "The pathogenesis of ascites formation in cirrhosis is uncertain. It is still under debate whether the effective blood volume is reduced (underfilling theory) or whether the intravascular compartment is expanded (overflow theory). This problem has not yet been solved because of insufficient tools for measuring the central blood volume. We have developed a method that enables us to determine directly the central blood volume, i.e., the blood volume in the heart cavities, lungs, and central arterial tree. In 60 patients with cirrhosis and 16 control subjects the central blood volume was assessed according to the kinetic theory as the product of cardiac output and mean transit time of the central vascular bed. Central blood volume was significantly smaller in patients with cirrhosis than in controls (mean 21 vs. 27 ml/kg estimated ideal body weight, p less than 0.001; 25% vs. 33% of the total blood volume, p less than 0.0001). The lowest values (18 ml/kg) were found in patients with gross ascites and a reduced systemic vascular resistance. In patients with cirrhosis central blood volume was inversely correlated to the hepatic venous pressure gradient (r = -0.41, p less than 0.01), and the total blood volume was inversely correlated to the systemic vascular resistance (r = -0.49, p less than 0.001), the latter being significantly reduced in the patient group. Patients with cirrhosis apparently are unable to maintain a normal central blood volume. This may be due to arteriolar vasodilation, portosystemic collateral flow, or sequestration of fluid in the peritoneal cavity, or any combination thereof. The present results indicate that central circulatory underfilling is an integral part of the hemodynamic and homeostatic derangement observed in cirrhosis.\r"

We examined the contribution of ethnic preferences in food intake to the risk of gallbladder disease in Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites. Participants in a population-based health survey were questioned about any history of gallbladder disease, and were interviewed to determine their dietary intake. After adjusting for age, body mass index, and ethnic group, we found that women with the highest intake of total fat and linoleic acid had reduced risks of gallbladder disease, although an opposite trend was observed in men. High levels of sucrose intake and low levels of cholesterol intake were associated with an increased risk for both sexes, but the odds ratios were not statistically significant. Although Mexican Americans and non-Hispanics differed in their intake of several nutrients, the elevated risk of gallbladder disease in Mexican American women was unchanged after ethnic differences in food intake were taken into account. Although the dietary preferences of Mexican Americans as reflected in 24-h diet recall interviews do not appear to explain their high prevalence of gallbladder disease, this finding should be interpreted with caution because of methodologic limitations in measuring habitual food intake.\r"

  ".U": "90060593\r", 
  ".W": "Little is known about how gastric and pancreatobiliary responses differ after intake of elemental diets from responses to polymeric food. We therefore compared pancreatic and biliary secretions after gastric instillation of albumin (7 g%, with dextrose 21 g%) with an elemental diet in 6 healthy volunteers. The elemental diet contained amino acids (7 g%, with dextrose 21 g%) in the same molar composition as the albumin. Furthermore, we studied the effect of a pure intragastric dextrose solution (21 g%) on pancreatobiliary secretions, as glucose constitutes a major component of elemental diet formulas. The various pancreatobiliary responses were tested against a maximal i.v. cholecystokinin stimulus. The dextrose, amino acid, and albumin meals emptied at similar rates, and gastric emptying was completed within 3 h. Similar pancreatobiliary responses were observed after the albumin and amino acid meals, but response to both the amino acid and albumin meals was smaller than to the intravenous cholecystokinin stimulus. The glucose meal caused a marked and sustained stimulation of pancreatobiliary outputs, which did not differ significantly from the other test meals. However, lower cholecystokinin levels were observed after the glucose meal compared with distinct cholecystokinin release after the albumin and amino acid meals. We conclude first that there are no major differences in secretory responses between elemental (amino acid) and polymeric (protein) meals and second, that intragastric pure glucose meals strongly stimulate pancreatobiliary secretions. The marked pancreatic and biliary responses to intragastric dextrose cannot be fully explained on the basis of cholecystokinin release, suggesting that this response is probably mediated by neural mechanisms.\r"

Nodularity and erythema of the gastric corpus were persistent endoscopic findings. Biopsies revealed patchy chronic active gastritis with a striking focal thick band of collagen immediately beneath the surface epithelial cells that did not extend to deeper portions of the lamina propria. Contrast radiography demonstrated an abnormal mucosa of the gastric corpus with a mosaiclike surface pattern. Numerous studies have failed to elucidate the etiology. Despite treatment with ranitidine, sucralfate, and furazolidone, there has been no clinical or pathologic improvement.

Monolayers of mucous cells from a human cell line MKN 28, obtained from a human gastric adenocarcinoma, have been studied. Cell damage has been assessed qualitatively by trypan blue dye exclusion test and quantitatively by 51Cr release assay. Cimetidine and ranitidine significantly protected cultured cells against damage induced by sodium taurocholate decreasing taurocholate induced 51Cr release by 36% (p less than 0.001) and 28% (p less than 0.01), respectively. Cimetidine was also protective in concentrations lower than ranitidine. This protection was not prevented by the prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor indomethacin nor by the sulph-hydryl blocker N-ethylmaleimide. Incubation with cimetidine and ranitidine did not increase the production of PGE2 by cultured cells nor did it affect the cellular level of sulph-hydryl compounds. Cimetidine and ranitidine did not afford protection against damage induced by indomethacin and ethanol. Cimetidine in a concentration of 10 4M increased ethanol induced damage significantly. In conclusion (1) cimetidine and ranitidine protect gastric cells against taurocholate induced damage in vitro, independently of their anti-acid effect; (2) this protection is not mediated by prostaglandin E2 or sulph-hydryl compounds; (3) cimetidine and ranitidine do not protect gastric cells against damage induced by indomethacin and ethanol.\r"

Clustering of ulcer locations was shown using a non-parametric test of clustering (Kruskal-Wallis statistic with 89 degrees of freedom = 151.31, probability of observing this extreme statistic with no clustering less than 0.0005) and a parametric test of clustering (F test statistic with 89 and 124 degrees of freedom = 5.41, probability of observing this extreme statistic with no clustering less than 0.0005). Patients having their largest ulcer in any given region had a much greater likelihood than other patients of having other ulcers in that same site. For example, the 26 patients with their largest ulcer in the proximal duodenal bulb had 20 of 33, or 61% (9) (standard error), of their other ulcers in the proximal duodenal bulb. In contrast, the 18 patients with their largest ulcer in the proximal stomach had four of 23, or 17% (8), of their other ulcers in the proximal duodenal bulb. Of the 59 patients who had two simultaneous ulcers, 28 patients had adjacent ulcers (distance between ulcers less than 4% of the distance from the gastric cardia to the apex of the duodenal bulb). These findings suggest that local factors may be important in the pathogenesis of simultaneous peptic ulcers, including infection caused by Campylobacter pylori or other microorganisms, ischaemia and mucosal barrier disruption.\r"

The organism was cultured from oesophageal biopsies in eight of 30 (27%) patients but could not be identified at this site by LM or EM. There was evidence of oesophageal inflammation in 20 patients which was associated with the local finding of C pylori in five (25%) including two of seven (29%) with Barrett's mucosa. Antral C pylori was present in 22 of 23 (96%) patients with chronic active gastritis. The organism was found in the antrum and oesophagus in four of 22 patients (18%), in the antrum and duodenum in four of 22 patients (18%) and in all three sites in a further two of 22 patients (9%). Antral C pylori was found in five of six patients with peptic ulceration. C pylori was cultured from the duodenum in six patients with confirmation by LN and EM in three, but only on areas of gastric metaplasia. The organism was not found in the normal group. This study indicates that C pylori may be irregularly isolated from the oesophagus and duodenum in patients with antral C pylori and chronic active gastritis. The role of C pylori in the oesophagus is most likely that of a commensal or contaminant.\r"

A strict linear correlation was found between NIRA and both the titrimetric (r = 0.928, p less than 0.0001) and the gravimetric (r = 0.971, p less than 0.0001) methods. On homogenised faeces, a mean coefficient of variation of 2.1 (SD 1.71)% was found. Before homogenisation (where a mean coefficient of variation of 7% was found) accurate results were obtained when the mean of five measurements was considered. In conclusion, the assay of faecal fat excretion by the near infrared reflessometry appears a simple, rapid and reliable method for measuring steatorrhoea.\r"

Traditional stains for histological assessment were supplemented by immunohistochemical methods. Venous and or lymphatic invasion was present in six cases (17.6%), with a statistically significant association with recurrent carcinoma or Dukes's C carcinoma in polyps otherwise regarded as completely excised. The presence or absence of venous and or lymphatic invasion in malignant polyps should be documented as if present, further treatment is indicated. A combination of haematoxylin and eosin and elastic-van Gieson stains will usually identify the presence of vascular invasion. Where a discrepancy arises, however, additional immunohistochemical stains may be of value.\r"

To determine if another 'small' opioid peptide is increased in the plasma of patients with liver disease, leucine enkephalin was measured by radioimmunoassay. Its plasma concentration was raised approximately five-fold in patients with acute liver disease (median 1490 pmol/l, range 830-2420) and three-fold in patients with cirrhosis with ascites (960 pmol/l, 470-2900), compared with disease controls (325 pmol/l, 180-740) and healthy controls (305 pmol/l, 180-560). The increase in plasma leucine enkephalin was proportional to the degree of liver damage, as judged in the patients with acute liver disease by its correlation with the prothrombin time (r = 0.691, p less than 0.01) and alanine aminotransferase (r = 0.502, p less than 0.05), and in the patients with cirrhosis by its negative correlation with the plasma albumin (r = -0.743, p less than 0.001). It is unclear whether the raised plasma leucine enkephalin in liver disease is a consequence of diminished hepatic inactivation, increased secretion from sympathetic nerves and adrenal glands, or both.\r"

  ".W": "Azygos venous blood flow and other haemodynamic parameters were measured in 14 cirrhotic patients to investigate the effects of a non-shunting operation, oesophageal transection with paraoesophagogastric devascularisation. Azygos venous blood flow measured by the local continuous thermal dilution method was significantly reduced by 13.8% after the operation (428 (41) v 369 (33) ml/min). Hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) was also significantly decreased from 14.5 (0.8) to 12.8 (0.7) mmHg (-11.8%). Cardiac output and routine liver tests did not change remarkably postoperatively. In this haemodynamic study before and after non-shunting operation, moderate but significant decreases were seen in azygos venous blood flow and portal pressure (HVPG), without substantial changes in systemic circulation. This suggests that blood flow through the portosystemic collaterals other than oesophageal varices may be decreased but still adequate after the operation. Well preserved portosystemic collaterals without oesophageal varices are thus considered an optimally balanced state after non-shunting operation.\r"

After endoscopic sphincterotomy of the pancreatic orifice the stones were disintegrated by shock waves under fluoroscopic control using a kidney lithotripter (Dornier HM3). The procedure was well tolerated by all but one patient, who had a mild pancreatitic attack immediately after lithotripsy. Clearance of the pancreatic duct systems from the larger stones was achieved in seven of eight patients. Half of the patients showed no improvement in the intensity and frequency of pain. The other patients had a marked amelioration of symptoms, however, both immediately and during a mean follow up interval of 11 (eight) months. A selective combined approach by endoscopy and extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy for the treatment of pancreatic stones seems promising.\r"

A causal relationship between colonic injury and the intake of colocynth was supported by the following features: (1) the pharmacology of the colocynth extract ingested; (2) the temporal relationship between colocynth intake and clinical onset (eight to 12 h); (3) the rapid recovery within three to six days, with normal endoscopy at day 14; (4) the absence of other possible causes for the observed patterns, except in one case, in which a concomitant intestinal infection with Clostridium perfringens Type A was discovered; (5) the specific pathological features. Colonic biopsies taken 27, 44, and 72 h after colocynth intake showed: erosions with fibrino-purulent exudate, early fibrosis of the lamina propria, hyaline thickening of the superficial epithelial basal membrane. These pathological features completely disappeared within 14 days in all three cases.\r"

Of the 38 patients with intrahepatic hepatitis D antigen, 27 (71%) had antigen detectable in serum by immunoblot, whereas only two were reactive by conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Thirty-one (82%) patients were also positive for serum hepatitis D virus RNA by spot hybridization and 33 (87%) were positive for IgM anti-hepatitis D virus. All markers were simultaneously present in 24 patients. Circulating hepatitis D antigen was detected in one (8%), IgM anti-hepatitis D in seven (58%) and hepatitis D virus RNA in two (17%) of the 12 patients who had anti-hepatitis D in serum but not detectable hepatitis D antigen in liver. Hepatitis D antigen was not detected in serum of any of the 15 control patients. The results suggest that serum hepatitis D antigen as detected by immunoblot and serum hepatitis D virus RNA are similar in sensitivity for detection of active hepatitis D virus replication during chronic infection and constitute useful, sensitive and noninvasive tests for the diagnosis and monitoring of chronic hepatitis D virus infection.\r"

In addition, the ability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis to generate soluble interleukin 2 receptor following mitogenic stimulation was studied in vitro. Serum soluble interleukin 2 receptor concentrations in all patients with acute viral hepatitis were found to be significantly elevated (1,319 +/- 527 units per ml) during the first week after onset of disease, as compared to healthy control individuals (375 +/- 102 units per ml; p less than 0.0005) and declined toward normal levels during the course of the illness. Similarly, patients suffering from chronic liver disease such as alcoholic liver cirrhosis (1,172 +/- 507 units per ml), primary biliary cirrhosis (619 +/- 190 units per ml) or chronic active HBsAg+ hepatitis (941 +/- 357 units per ml) showed increased serum soluble interleukin 2 receptor concentrations (p less than 0.0005 vs. controls, respectively). In vitro mitogen stimulation of peripheral mononuclear cells derived from patients with alcoholic cirrhosis resulted in a soluble interleukin 2 receptor production not different from that seen in healthy individuals, suggesting that elevated soluble interleukin 2 receptor serum levels seen in this disease are not the result of an increased synthesis by circulating lymphocytes. Due to the ability of soluble interleukin 2 receptor to bind free interleukin 2--thus making it a potential immunoregulatory molecule--its high serum levels could explain some of the immunologic abnormalities observed in acute and chronic liver disease.\r"

However, this hypothesis has never been tested by measuring the vascular and extravascular spaces in the intact liver. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of chronic alcohol intake on the hepatic microcirculation using Goresky's multiple-indicator dilution technique in the isolated perfused rat liver. Female rat littermates were pair-fed either ethanol (n = 7) or an isocaloric carbohydrate diet (n = 7) for 21 days. As expected, chronic alcohol intake produced a significant increase in liver/body weight ratio (+32%, p less than 0.01) and hepatocyte size (+45%, p less than 0.001), which was accompanied by a marked increase in the cellular water space (control: 3.3 +/- 0.6 ml; ethanol-fed: 4.9 +/- 0.9 ml; p less than 0.001). When expressing data per total liver, the sinusoidal space was similar in the two groups (control: 1.87 +/- 0.2; ethanol-fed: 1.95 +/- 0.2 ml; not significant), whereas the interstitial space was increased in alcohol rats compared to controls (albumin space +58%, p less than 0.01; sucrose space +51%, p less than 0.01). In alcoholic rats, the sinusoidal space was probably stretched, with an overall reduced transversal diameter, as suggested by the reduced values found when data were expressed per gm of liver weight. However, despite this finding and the enlargement of the liver and hepatocytes observed in alcoholic rats, similar values were obtained between the two groups for the portal perfusion pressure and thus the intrahepatic vascular resistance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We have previously shown that alcohol intake in awake, unrestrained rats is followed by an increase in portal tributary blood flow. In this study, the effect of ethanol on splanchnic hemodynamics in rats with portal hypertension was analyzed. Portal hypertension was induced by partial ligation of the portal vein. This procedure resulted in an increase in portal tributary and hepatic arterial blood flows compared to sham-operated animals. Ethanol (2 gm per kg, oral) increased portal tributary blood flow in both sham-operated and portal vein-ligated rats (sham + water = 37.6 +/- 1.4; sham + ethanol = 63.1 +/- 1.9; p less than 0.01; partial portal vein stenosis + water = 53.2 +/- 3.3; partial portal vein stenosis + ethanol = 69.5 +/- 2.2 ml.kg-1.min-1; p less than 0.01). In sham-operated rats, hepatic artery blood flow was unchanged following ethanol (sham + water = 6.6 +/- 0.7; sham + ethanol = 7.1 +/- 1.0 ml.kg-1.min-1), whereas in portal vein-ligated rats, flow was increased (partial portal vein stenosis + water = 13.7 +/- 1.4; partial portal vein stenosis + ethanol = 19.8 +/- 1.1 ml.kg-1.min-1; p less than 0.025). The adenosine receptor blocker 8-phenyltheophylline suppressed only the ethanol-induced increase in both portal tributary and hepatic artery blood flows in portal vein-ligated rats. The increases in hepatic artery and portal tributary blood flows observed in portal vein-ligated rats without ethanol were not influenced by 8-phenyltheophylline.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Studies in rats with prehepatic portal hypertension due to portal vein stenosis (a model with extensive portosystemic shunting) have shown that propranolol increases the portocollateral resistance, which hinders the fall in portal pressure. The present study examined the effects of propranolol on splanchnic and systemic hemodynamics in rats with portal hypertension due to cirrhosis of the liver, a model which is characterized by mild portosystemic shunting. Two groups of rats with CCl4-induced cirrhosis were studied: the propranolol group (n = 8), which received a propranolol infusion of 2 mg per 15 min, and controls (n = 9), which received a placebo (saline) infusion. Hemodynamic measurements were done using radiolabeled microspheres. Propranolol-treated rats had significantly lower cardiac output (-31%) and heart rate (-26%) than controls (p less than 0.001). Hepatic artery flow was not modified by propranolol. Propranolol caused splanchnic vasoconstriction, manifested by increased splanchnic resistance (+57%) and by a significant fall in portal blood inflow (4.8 +/- 0.4 vs. 6.3 +/- 0.5 ml per min.100 gm in controls, p less than 0.05). In contrast with rats with prehepatic portal hypertension, propranolol did not increase portal resistance in cirrhotic rats [2.0 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.0 +/- 0.1 mmHg per ml per min.100 gm body weight (not significant)]. Hence, the fall in portal pressure (-19%) was expected from the decrease in portal inflow (-24%). These results suggest that increased portal resistance in rats with prehepatic portal hypertension may represent an intrinsic effect of propranolol on the portocollateral vessels, since beta-blockade does not modify portal vascular resistance in cirrhosis.\r"

Liver biopsies were performed weekly during episodes of graft dysfunction and to follow response to treatment. Baseline immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporine and low-dose prednisolone. Rejection was treated with steroids and with OKT3 as rescue. Azathioprine was given to patients with preoperative or perioperative renal insufficiency and was added to patients' treatment after the first sign of rejection. Seven complications were observed in approximately 1,100 liver biopsies, only one necessitating surgery. We found that 39.4% of the patients never experienced acute rejection, and 60.6% had at least one episode of acute rejection. Overall, 42.3% of the patients had only one episode of acute rejection, 13.5% had two, 3.8% had three and 1% had five episodes of acute rejection. Sixty of 63 first acute rejection episodes occurred within 21 days of transplant. Primary disease, sex or patient age had no significant influence on the incidence of rejection. There was a lower incidence of rejection (p less than 0.005) in patients transplanted after October, 1986, despite lower mean cyclosporine levels. Mean cyclosporine level during the first postoperative month was 679 ng per ml vs. a mean level of 910 ng per ml prior to October, 1986, when the immunosuppressive protocol was altered. Antirejection therapy was very effective in that only two of the 63 patients had graft failure due to acute rejection. Both of these patients were subsequently retransplanted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90061185\r", 
  ".W": "A comparative, descriptive study on the prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma either associated or not with cirrhosis was undertaken between the cities of Trieste, Italy, and Chiba, Japan. Data were derived from 12,340 and 2,052 autopsies consecutively performed in Trieste and Chiba during 1980 to 1984 and 1975 to 1985, respectively. During these years, more than 70% of all deaths were studied by autopsy in Trieste. Clinical cases of hepatocellular carcinoma admitted to the Chiba University Hospital were also analyzed to correct for the bias induced by the relatively small number of autopsies in Chiba. Serum hepatitis B surface antigen was more frequent in Chiba, whereas alcohol intake was greater in Trieste. From the comparison of the data, we conclude: (i) hepatocellular carcinoma was associated with cirrhosis in the large majority of the cases both in Trieste (87%) and Chiba (81%); (ii) in both sexes, the average age of hepatocellular carcinoma patients was significantly older (p less than 0.005) in Trieste than in Chiba; (iii) in the autopsy series, cirrhosis was more frequent in Trieste (9.7%) than in Chiba (1.5%); (iv) in Chiba, hepatocellular carcinoma was more frequent than cirrhosis not complicated by hepatocellular carcinoma (6.9 vs. 1.5%) at necroscopy, and (v) the age-standardized rate of hepatocellular carcinoma was significantly (p less than 0.01) higher in Trieste than in Chiba. These geographical differences might be related to the different type of cirrhosis observed in Trieste (alcoholic) and Chiba (postnecrotic).\r"

The mean age (+/- SD) was 13 +/- 2 years. Blood pressure readings were obtained with an automatic, noninvasive recorder. Black adolescents and white adolescents had similar blood pressures while awake (116/69 vs. 116/69 mm Hg), with boys having higher levels of systolic blood pressure (118 vs. 114 mm Hg) and comparable levels of diastolic blood pressure (69 vs. 69 mm Hg) relative to girls. The patterns while the adolescents were asleep, however, were different. White boys (106 mm Hg), white girls (105 mm Hg), and black girls (105 mm Hg) had similar systolic blood pressures during sleep. Black boys (112 mm Hg), however, had significantly higher systolic blood pressures while asleep. Black adolescents, as a group, had significantly higher diastolic blood pressures than white adolescents while asleep (64 vs. 61 mm Hg). Changes in blood pressure from awake to asleep were not related to changes in heart rate. Results of this study indicate that both race and gender are important determinants of the diurnal pattern of blood pressure and heart rate in adolescents.\r"

The current investigation examined the extent to which this forebrain area is necessary for the elaboration of salt-induced hypertension in the borderline hypertensive rat. Eight-week-old male rats were given either electrolytic lesions of the anteroventral portion of the third ventricle region or sham lesions. All rats were then placed on a high salt diet (8% NaCl) for 10 weeks. At the conclusion of this dietary period, direct measurement of resting mean arterial pressure revealed that borderline hypertensive rats with lesions of the anteroventral portion of the third ventricle had significantly lower blood pressure (128.4 +/- 5.1 mm Hg) compared with sham-operated rats (148.1 +/- 4.1 mm Hg).\r"

  ".W": "The posterior hypothalamus contains a sympathoexcitatory system that can be modulated by changes in GABAergic tone. We tested the hypothesis that the GABAergic mechanism in the posterior hypothalamus is altered in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) compared with the Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) control rats. Blood pressure and heart rate were continuously measured in the conscious state; blood samples were obtained for determination of plasma catecholamine concentrations. Bilateral microinjections of the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline methiodide into the posterior hypothalamus increased heart rate and blood pressure in a dose-related fashion and increased plasma catecholamine concentrations in both SHR and WKY rats. The responses were not significantly different between the two strains of rats. Microinjections of the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol in this same region caused dose-related decreases in both heart rate and blood pressure in SHR and WKY rats. Although the decreases in heart rate caused by muscimol were not significantly different between the SHR and WKY rats, the decreases in blood pressure were significantly greater in SHR compared with WKY rats. Further, microinjection of muscimol caused a significant decrease in plasma catecholamines in SHR but not in WKY rats. These data indicate that in SHR and WKY rats the posterior hypothalamus contains a sympathoexcitatory mechanism that is tonically inhibited by GABA. The ability of muscimol to decrease plasma catecholamines selectively in SHR and to cause greater decreases in blood pressure, suggests that the GABAergic mechanisms in the posterior hypothalamus of the SHR and WKY rats may differ.\r"

  ".W": "Intracerebroventricular infusion of the peptide melittin increases immunoreactive kinins in the cerebrospinal fluid of anesthetized dogs, probably secondary to activation of brain or cerebrospinal fluid kininogenases. Intracerebroventricular melittin also increases blood pressure and heart rate, possibly mediated by brain kinins, since intracerebroventricular bradykinin also increases blood pressure and heart rate. We tested whether the effects of centrally administered melittin on blood pressure and heart rate could be blocked by simultaneous infusion of a kinin receptor antagonist, [DArg0]Hyp3-Thi5,8[DPhe7]bradykinin, in normotensive awake rats. In the controls, intracerebroventricular infusion of kinin receptor antagonist given for 1 hour at a rate of 10 micrograms/hr blocked bradykinin-induced increases in blood pressure and heart rate by 80%. Basal blood pressure and heart rate were not affected by the kinin receptor antagonist alone. After a 30-minute infusion of melittin (8 micrograms/30 min), cerebrospinal fluid kininogenase activity (n = 17) rose from 0.13 +/- 0.05 to 0.43 +/- 0.1 ng/ml/min (p less than 0.02). Although cerebrospinal fluid kinins increased from below sensitivity (0.02 ng/ml, n = 12) to 0.19 +/- 0.1 ng/ml (n = 17), this change was due to drastic increases in three rats, whereas in 12 of them kinins were below sensitivity. Incubation of bradykinin (10 ng) with 0.1 ml rat cerebrospinal fluid for 5 minutes destroyed 70% of kinins, suggesting that rapid destruction may have made detection of increased CSF kinins difficult.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The goal of the present study was to determine if long-term inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme with cilazapril, a new long-acting angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, could improve cerebral vascular reserve. For this purpose, two groups of 12 spontaneously hypertensive rats were compared. One group was treated with 10 mg/kg/day cilazapril from 14 weeks to 33 weeks of age and was compared with a group treated with placebo. A third group of 12 Wistar-Kyoto rats treated with placebo was used as reference. At the end of the treatment period, cerebral vascular reserve was evaluated by measuring cerebral blood flow (radioactive microspheres) at rest and during maximal vasodilation induced by seizures provoked by bicuculline. Then, the rats were perfusion-fixed, and morphometry of the cerebral vasculature was performed. Cerebral vascular reserve was severely impaired in the spontaneously hypertensive rats since their maximal cerebral blood flow was decreased by 52% compared with the Wistar-Kyoto rats. Cilazapril normalized cerebral blood flow reserve. This normalization was associated with a decreased thickness of the medial layer in the carotid artery, the middle cerebral artery, and in the pial arteries larger than 100 microns. Further studies are required to determine whether this decreased medial thickness is due to the normalization of blood pressure induced by cilazapril or to the reduction of trophic factors such as angiotensin II.\r"

In normal K+ medium, a marked contraction was elicited by increasing Ca2+ concentration from 0 to 3 mM in aortas from a control group of SHR, but not in aortas from SHR treated with CS-622. In 60 mM K+ medium, however, the sensitivity of aorta to Ca2+ was almost the same in the two groups. A calcium channel activator, CGP-28392 (10(-7) to 10(-6) M), induced a marked contraction in the aortas from control SHR, but not in the aortas from CS-622-treated SHR. When slightly depolarized in 10 or 12 mM K+ solution, the aortas from CS-622-treated SHR contracted in response to CGP-28392. The aortic sensitivity to KCl contraction was much lower in CS-622-treated SHR than in untreated SHR, whereas the sensitivity to phenylephrine contraction was little different in the two groups. These contractile profiles of aortas from CS-622-treated SHR were very similar to those from normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats but not to those from hydralazine-treated SHR. These data suggest that contractions due to Ca2+ through voltage-dependent calcium channels are exaggerated in SHR aorta and that long-term treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor suppresses the abnormal contractility of SHR vascular smooth muscle, probably through alterations of voltage-related functions of calcium channels.\r"

However, the densities of cholinergic nerve fibers, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-containing, and substance P-containing nerve fibers in the mesenteric arteries of the spontaneously hypertensive rats were unchanged in comparison with findings in the Wistar-Kyoto rats.

  ".W": "Dietary fats have been shown to influence blood pressure in humans and animal models of hypertension. The ability of a particular fat to modulate arterial pressure appears to depend on its fatty acid profile rather than its degree of saturation or unsaturation. Little is known about the effects of specific dietary fats of animal origin on blood pressure. We tested the concurrent effects of both calcium and dietary fat on blood pressure development in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. Sixty animals were fed diets containing butterfat, fish oil, or corn oil from 3-26 weeks of age. Each diet among the three oils was further modified to contain either 0.25% or 2.0% of the diet as calcium. All six diets provided 18% of the diet (36% of the calories) as fat. The polyunsaturated-to-saturated fat ratio was 0.07, 0.84, and 4.54 for butterfat, fish oil, and corn oil, respectively. Fish oil consumption resulted in lower blood pressures compared with butterfat (p less than 0.036) or corn oil (p less than 0.0009). Similarly, butterfat feeding resulted in lower blood pressures when compared with corn oil (p less than 0.054). Supplementing the diet with calcium decreased blood pressure in both the butterfat and corn oil diets. When butterfat diets were supplemented with calcium, the resulting blood pressures did not differ significantly from those obtained with the two fish oil diets. It is concluded that butterfat, though highly saturated, is associated with less of an increase in the spontaneously hypertensive rat's blood pressure than is corn oil, which is highly unsaturated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It has been suggested by Dalla Volta and Anzola (1988) that the cold patch may be a prognostic index of vascular headache physiology; that is, as headaches improve through the use of vasoactive prophylactic medication, the cold patch would decrease in size or disappear. The purpose of this study is an attempt to replicate these findings. Forty migraine patients were randomly selected, and a thermographic re-examination of the external carotid region (forehead) was conducted. The post-treatment thermogram was then compared to the initial pre-treatment thermogram. Thirty subjects demonstrated an improved condition (IC) and ten subjects a worsened condition (WC). The IC Group exhibited a 73.2% reduction in headache frequency following a mean treatment period of 6.3 months. The WC Group demonstrated a 48.1% increase in headache occurrence at a mean treatment interval of fifteen months. Results demonstrated little thermographic difference between the two conditions. Within the IC Group, 46.7% of subjects exhibited and increase in cold patch size with an improved condition, 40% of cold patches remained stable, 6.7% of cold patches reduced in size, and zero cold patches disappeared with successful treatment. Within the WC Group, 20% of cold patches decreased in size with a worsened condition, 40% increased in size, and 40% remained stable. Chi square analysis determined there was no significant difference in cold patch changes between patients whose headache condition improved or worsened (p less than .70).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

CHAS items are organized into six functional categories (Stress Antecedents, Physical Antecedents, Attention Consequences, Escape Consequences, Coping Responses, and Medication Use) potentially related to headache activity. Parents filled out the CHAS at an intake evaluation for behavioral medicine treatment, and parents of children who completed treatment filled out another CHAS after therapy. Results showed that the frequency of specific CHAS items varied widely both within and between functional categories, suggesting that headache is affected by a variety of situational factors, some of which are common across many children and others of which are pertinent only for a small proportion of children. The results further suggest that the environmental conditions of headache are open to change by behavioral medicine treatment. In the present study, items reflecting social attention to headache, interference of headache with school attendance, and use of relaxation procedures changed after treatment. The potential value of the CHAS for treatment planning is discussed.\r"

No effects were found for the bilateral trapezius EMG or bilateral temporal artery sites. Analysis of the self report data revealed a significant main effect for the Total Pain Score of the Pain Mannequin but not for a current headache intensity rating. Again, the former effect was seen most clearly when the contemporary MMPI norms were used. In general, these data support a Psychological Distress Hypothesis in that patients with significant elevations (greater than 70) demonstrated greater frontalis EMG activity and higher Pain Mannequin scores.

  ".W": "In this prospective study we sought to establish the incidence and nature of lower limb ischemia in patients undergoing treatment with intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) counterpulsation and to determine risk factors for its development. The sample was composed of all 258 balloon catheter insertions or attempted insertions for IABP therapy in 249 patients during a 16-month period. Assessment of the lower limbs, hemodynamic status, and pertinent medications were recorded daily throughout the patient's hospitalization. Lower limb ischemia was present in 47%, with 14% having major ischemic complications. Multivariate logistic regression, which was based on variables found to be significant in univariate analysis, revealed that preexisting peripheral vascular disease, female sex, and diabetes mellitus were related to the development of the whole range of lower limb ischemic problems. Diabetes mellitus, cardiogenic shock, and a history of smoking were associated with major ischemia. Evaluation of risks and benefits before treatment with IABP counterpulsation and careful lower limb assessment before, during, and after counterpulsation may help reduce the complications associated with this lifesaving device.\r"

  ".W": "During an 18-month period 11 patients were seen at the Toronto Western Hospital Pain Clinic 4 months to 5 years after internal mammary artery (IMA) bypass with a specific cluster of chest wall symptoms and signs confined to the site of IMA graft harvesting. Sympathetic ganglia blocks produced dramatic but temporary relief of symptoms in two of the most severely affected patients. In two other patients seen quite early after surgery, use of transcutaneous electrical stimulation produced considerable and permanent decrease of symptoms within 3 weeks. Such a chronic pain syndrome has not been previously reported in the literature. We postulate that IMA bypass surgery may be associated with a specific pain syndrome. This syndrome may arise from injury to the anterior branches of the intercostal nerves at the site of graft harvesting. Possible neurophysiologic mechanisms are discussed.\r"

This potential for complication increases when bypass exceeds 2 hours and rises sharply when pump time is prolonged more than 3 to 4 hours. One group of serious complications is major neurologic disorders. The risk of significant cerebral dysfunction, that is, severe focal stroke or coma, is about 1%, and this risk increases with age and coexistent cardiovascular disease. This article focuses on the complication of coma and the possible role cardiopulmonary bypass plays in improving survival rates. A case study is presented illustrating the potential role of cardiopulmonary bypass in the unexpected neurologic recovery from coma.\r"

Eleven hips were treated by combined pelvic and femoral osteotomy which, in general, gave good results. At a mean follow-up of 16.7 years, 80% of the whole series had a good or excellent clinical result and 51% were good or excellent radiologically. Simultaneous correction both above and below the hip is considered to be the best treatment for the older child with congenital hip dislocation.\r"

These changes included osteoporosis of the acetabular roof, irregularity of contour, premature fusion of the triradiate cartilage, hypertrophy of articular cartilage and changes in dimensions. These changes tended to be more marked in older children and when more than half of the femoral epiphysis was involved. Comparison with 25 cases of Perthes' disease from Liverpool showed the same picture. Several of the acetabular changes noted during the active stages were also seen in a series of 24 adult hips after Perthes' disease. Radio-isotope scans of the hips of 27 children with Perthes' disease showed a consistently increased uptake in the acetabulum on the affected side, indicative of a local increase in vascularity and metabolic activity. It was possible to postulate a working model for the pathogenesis of all the acetabular changes. A number of statistical correlations suggest that most of the changes have a bearing on the final outcome.\r"

Secondary arthroplasties were performed as salvage procedures in 75 cases and the early outcome of these was studied retrospectively. The mean time in hospital was 25 days for prosthetic replacement, though 60% of the patients had other medical conditions considered as risk factors. Mortality was 5% after six months and 8% after one year. Dislocation was seen in 11% and additional surgery was required in 4%. There was one case of deep infection and one supracondylar femoral fracture. In some cases there was considerable delay between the primary and secondary operation due to lack of awareness of functional deterioration, but although many patients had poor mobility before the secondary operation this was greatly improved within six weeks of the arthroplasty. We conclude that elective secondary hip arthroplasty for failure of fracture fixation is a safe and successful procedure. Once the decision to perform an arthroplasty is taken, this should be done without delay to avoid deterioration of function.\r"

At the beginning of knee flexion the sulcus angle was greater than in unaffected women, the lateral patellofemoral angle was smaller, the patella displaced further laterally, tilted more laterally and the congruence angle was directed more laterally. At 30 degrees of knee flexion these differences were less marked than at 0 degree to 10 degrees. Logistic regression analysis showed that the sulcus angle at 10 degrees of knee flexion was the most diagnostic feature, indicating that there is an anatomical predisposition to recurrent dislocation and that pathological patellar tracking starts from the beginning of flexion. Traditional sunrise radiographic films taken at 25 degrees to 30 degrees knee flexion clearly miss diagnostically important information.\r"

The diffusion of methotrexate (MTX) from methylpolymethacrylate implants was studied in vitro: polymerisation of the cement did not destroy the drug; liberation began immediately and about 10% was released by 18 hours. Some release continued for as long as six months. In vivo experiments on rats with induced osteosarcoma showed that MTX in cement had both local and general effects which were dependent on the dosage. A series of 17 large dogs with spontaneous osteosarcoma were then treated by local resection and cement containing MTX. General chemotherapeutic effects were detectable from 2 hours to 5 days, survival was increased and local recurrence was reduced, but there were four cases of delayed wound healing. Preliminary studies in human patients confirm the possibility that this method of local chemotherapy could be a useful addition to the treatment of malignant tumours of bone.\r"

Anterior cruciate ligament implants with different stiffnesses were inserted; normal stability could always be restored, and the stiffness or extensibility of implants did not affect knee behaviour significantly. The tightness of implants was critical--small tensioning errors caused subluxation, inhibited knee extension and allowed damagingly high implant tensions. It is concluded that the tension of ligament implants could not be adjusted simply with a pre-set instrument; the procedure will remain critically dependent on the judgment of the operating surgeon.\r"

Twelve knees (38%) progressed to complete ACL deficiency with positive pivot shift tests and increased anteroposterior translation on tests with the KT-1000 arthrometer. Patients with partial ACL tears frequently had limitation for strenuous sports, while those developing ACL deficiency had additional functional limitations involving recreational activities. Three factors were statistically significant in predicting which partial tears would develop complete ACL deficiency: the amount of ligament tearing--one-fourth tears infrequently progressed, one-half tears progressed in 50% and three-fourth tears in 86%; a subtle increase in initial anterior translation; and the occurrence of a subsequent re-injury with giving-way.\r"

We therefore made a prospective study using the principle of ligamentotoxis and primary cancellous bone grafting as the uniform method of treatment. Ligamentotaxis was maintained by using an external fixator for three weeks only, after which a carefully monitored programme of rehabilitation was given. We have reviewed 72 consecutive distal radial fractures after a follow-up of 7 to 40 months (average 11 months). Reduction had been maintained during healing and over 80% of patients regained full range of movement in hands, wrists and forearms with strong and pain-free wrist function. Complications were infrequent and gave no real problems. We conclude that distraction, external fixation and bone grafting appears to be an excellent method of treating comminuted fractures of the distal radius.\r"

Mitogen-stimulated T cell blasts were generated from intrathyroidal lymphocyte preparations and fused with a hypoxanthine-, aminopterin-, and thymidine-sensitive variant of the Molt 4 human leukemia T cell line. The resulting intrathyroidal T-T cell hybridomas and T-T cell hybridomas obtained from normal peripheral blood mitogen-stimulated T cell blasts were expanded and tested for their biological function. None of the generated T cell hybridomas exhibited antigen-specific IL-2 secretion when stimulated with autologous thyrocytes, although 60% of the hybridomas expressed CD3 antigen and the T cell receptor alpha/beta heterodimer. However, 9 intrathyroidal and 11 peripheral blood T cell hybridomas secreted a factor(s) that significantly enhanced immunoglobulin G secretion in vitro (P less than 0.005, by Student-Newman-Keuls test; mean +/- SEM, 338 +/- 60% increase). In summary, we have successfully used a technique that allows the construction of T-T cell hybridomas derived from intrathyroidal T cell cultures. The data demonstrated that a predominance of helper factor-secreting T cells were available for fusion within the Graves' thyroid gland. Such observations are further evidence for intact T cell help within the thyroid gland of patients with Graves' disease.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-seven prepubertal boys and 9 prepubertal girls with constitutionally delayed growth were treated with the anabolic steroid oxandrolone for 12 months and followed until they reached final height. Sixteen boys were treated with a mean dose of 0.12 mg/kg.day [low dose (LD)] and 11 boys with a mean dose of 0.22 mg/kg.day [high dose (HD)]. The girls were treated with a mean dose of 0.1 mg/kg.day. Thirteen boys and 9 girls served as controls. On oxandrolone the mean height velocity increased from 4.0 to 8.6 (boys, LD), from 4.3 to 8.9 (boys, HD), and from 4.3 to 8.3 cm/yr (girls). The immediate posttreatment height velocity was significantly higher than the pretreatment height velocity (P less than 0.05), regardless of whether the patients had entered puberty. On oxandrolone the mean ratios of change in bone age/change in chronological age were 2.0 (boys, LD), 2.3 (boys, HD), and 2.0 yr/yr (girls) and continued to be accelerated during the 6 months after treatment. Height predictions at the onset of treatment and after 6 months off treatment were calculated by three different methods: Bayley-Pinneau (BP), Roche-Wainer-Thissen (RWT), and Tanner Mark II (T II). In the boys (LD) mean height predictions increased significantly by the methods of BP (3.3 cm) and RWT (2.9 cm), but not by the method of T II (0.6 cm). In the boys (HD) no significant change in height predictions was noted. In the girls mean height predictions remained unchanged by BP and RWT, but decreased significantly by T II (-2.5 cm). The difference between final height and initial height prediction was taken as a measure of the influence of the treatment on adult height. In all three treatment groups the difference between final height and initial height prediction, calculated with all three methods, did not differ from the control group. We conclude that oxandrolone treatment for 1 yr has no effect on adult height. In spite of this, the use of an anabolic steroid such as oxandrolone may still have value, as an increase in height velocity and an earlier onset of puberty may benefit short children suffering from psychological problems due to delay of growth and development.\r"

  ".W": "We characterized the virtual absence of immunoassayable thyroglobulin (Tg) in the serum and thyroid gland of two siblings (MA, JNA) and one nephew (RSS) from a family without inbreeding or familial goiter. Diagnosis of defective Tg gene expression was based on findings of normal PBI and low serum T4, low or normal serum T3, negative perchlorate discharge test, and virtual absence of the serum Tg response to challenge by bovine TSH. This conclusion was confirmed by analysis of proteins in the goiter extracts. Only minute amounts of immunoassayable Tg were detected by RIA (MA, 0.11; JNA, 0.19 mg/g tissue; compared to 70-90 mg/g in normal thyroid tissue). Gel filtration in Sephacryl S300 showed the absence of a normal Tg peak at 280 nm and concentration of label mostly on albumin. A minor intermediate peak of radioactivity was also detected, with the size of, approximately, normal Tg. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-agarose gel electrophoresis indicated the absence of Tg dimer and monomer, and Western blotting and immunoelectrophoresis confirmed this finding. Dot blot quantification of Tg and thyroid peroxidase mRNA indicated decreased hybridization of the patients' mRNA (MA, 44%; JNA, 63%) with phTgM2 (Tg probe) and increased hybridization (MA, 191%; JNA, 182%) with the pM5 (thyroid peroxidase probe) compared with control thyroid tissue. Dot blot analysis of Tg mRNA from the two siblings weakly hybridized with 3' and 5' Tg probes. RNA analysis by means of Northern transfer showed a clear signal of hybridization with Tg probe (phTgM1) in the 8- to 9-kilobase range, corresponding to the normal size Tg mRNA. No major polymorphisms were noted in Southern blotting, using seven restriction endonucleases. We conclude that no gross alteration of the 5' region of Tg gene was present in these patients. Ultrastructural examination of the thyroid tissue indicated that the rough endoplasmic reticulum was not augmented, nor were the cisternae of rough endoplasmic reticulum dilated. The defect observed in these goiters is diminished tissue concentration of Tg mRNA with defective translation. However, small amounts of functionally active Tg could be synthesized, iodinated, and immediately hydrolized, yielding mostly T3, owing to the intense tissue stimulation by TSH.\r"

  ".W": "We present an unusual patient with a Leydig cell tumor to show that greatly elevated serum concentrations of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) may not be diagnostic of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). A 3.5-yr-old boy had a small testicular mass and plasma 17OHP concentrations of 147-333 nmol/L (4,850-11,000 ng/dL), suggesting CAH with adrenal rests. However, normal plasma cortisol values and the unresponsiveness of the 17OHP concentration to dexamethasone suppression or ACTH stimulation suggested a diagnosis of Leydig cell tumor. A 4-fold elevation in plasma 21-deoxycortisol compared with a 200-fold elevation in 17OHP suggested that the elevated 17OHP derived from the normal pathway of testosterone synthesis in the testis. This was proven by normalization of all hormonal values after tumor resection. Compared to the abundance of mRNA for P450c17, the tumor contained unusually large amounts of mRNA for P450scc, the cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, which is the rate-limiting step in steroid hormone synthesis. Increased P450scc activity, which increased the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone, apparently permitted the 17,20-lyase activity of P450c17 to become rate limiting, thus accounting for the increased secretion of 17OHP. Thus, Leydig cell tumors can produce quantities of 17OHP previously reported only in CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The molecular characterization of steroidogenic mRNAs in this tumor indicates an unusual ratio in the expression of the genes for the steroidogenic enzymes, probably accounting for the unusual pattern of serum steroids.\r"

  ".W": "The role of insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) in the hypoglycemia associated with nonislet cell tumors is controversial. In this study we have addressed this question by measuring the IGF-II mRNA levels in extracts of these tumors. Hybridization of a 32P-labeled IGF-II cDNA to a Northern blot of RNA from three nonislet cell tumors associated with hypoglycemia (a hemangiopericytoma, fibrosarcoma, and malignant mesenchymal tumor) demonstrated six hybridizing bands, 6.8, 5.6, 4.7, 3.6, 2.6, and 2.1 kilobases in length. These bands were similar to those described by others in a range of tumors and normal tissues. Tissue IGF-II mRNA levels were quantitated using a solution hybridization/RNase protection assay. IGF-II mRNA levels in the tumors were similar to the level present in one line of human hepatoblastoma-derived Hep G2 cells, 5- to 6-fold higher than that in another line of Hep G2 cells, and 2- to 3-fold higher than that in term placenta. In contrast, little or no IGF-II mRNA was detected in a nonfunctioning islet cell adenoma or normal spleen. There was no evidence for amplification of the IGF-II gene in the one tumor in which it was sought. These data suggest that nonislet cell tumors associated with hypoglycemia produce large amounts of IGF-II mRNA and that this IGF-II mRNA appears to be the product of an IGF-II gene, which is apparently normal in the region encoding mature IGF-II peptide.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether abnormal bone cell recruitment or differentiation may be involved in the development of aplastic bone lesion in renal osteodystrophy we have compared histomorphometric parameters of bone formation and in vitro behavior of osteoblastic cells isolated from the trabecular bone surfaces in 37 dialysis patients with osteitis fibrosa, normal bone formation rate, or aplastic bone lesion. The bone cell responses to human PTH-(1-34) (20 nmol/L), as evaluated by intracellular cAMP production, and to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (10 nmol/L), as assessed by osteocalcin synthesis, were not different from normal in patients with low, normal, or high bone formation rates. Osteoblastic cells isolated from patients with a high bone formation rate and markedly elevated serum iPTH and osteocalcin values had a higher than normal DNA replication in primary culture. The peak of [3H]thymidine incorporation, the maximal DNA synthesis, and the area under the growth curve were 4.4- to 6.3-fold increased in osteitis fibrosa compared to those in normal bone cells obtained from age-matched individuals. By contrast, [3H]thymidine incorporation in bone cells from aplastic patients was about 25% of normal and only 5% of the value in osteitis fibrosa. The decreased DNA replication of cultured bone cells in aplastic patients was unrelated to trabecular bone aluminum staining, but was associated with low serum immunoreactive PTH values compared to those in other groups of patients. These results show that high bone formation in uremic osteoitis fibrosa is associated with higher than normal [3H]thymidine incorporation in bone cells in vitro, whereas low bone formation in aplastic patients results from lower than normal DNA replication and suggest that the defective osteoblastic recruitment in aplastic patients may be related to factors other than aluminum, including inappropriate PTH secretion.\r"

  ".W": "A study was performed on 94 women delivering at 34-44 weeks gestation, whose pregnancies were uncomplicated to determine the role of PRL in human fetal and neonatal salt and water conservation. Ultrasonic estimation of amniotic fluid (AF) volume and sampling of maternal blood, AF, cord blood, and 2-h neonatal blood were performed to analyze PRL, osmolality, sodium ion concentration ([Na]), and blood solids [hematocrit (Hct), total serum solids (tss), and total protein concentration]. In this report, which addresses the role of fetal PRL, Pearson correlations showed the following significant relationships: 1) approximation of cord serum osmolality and [Na] in cord and maternal serum, as well as parallel changes in cord blood Hct, tss, and total protein; 2) reduced estimated AF volume and increased AF osmolality in the face of elevated cord serum osmolality and [Na]; 3) a shift toward normal in cord Hct and tss over the first 2 h of neonatal life after an initially increased or decreased cord serum osmolality, [Na], Hct, or tss; and 4) relationship between fetal pituitary PRL levels of 230 micrograms/L or less and cord serum osmolality, [Na], and Hct. The entire range of cord serum PRL levels correlated with changes in AF osmolality and [Na] as well as with neonatal changes in Hct and tss. These findings support the hypotheses that osmotic equilibrium exists between maternal and fetal circulations; that disturbances in this balance lead to changes in fetal and neonatal water excretion; and that fetal PRL, stimulated by increases in cord serum osmolality and [Na], acts as an antidiuretic, leading to restoration of the offspring's extracellular fluid volume.\r"

Cortisol suppressed lymphocyte thymidine incorporation at 10(-5), 10(-6), and 10(-7) M (17.6%, 20%, and 38% of control, respectively; P less than 0.01). Cortisol-induced suppression was reversed when low concentrations of RU 486 (10(-7) and 10(-6) M) were added. RU 486 at 10(-5) M further suppressed lymphocyte thymidine incorporation when added to cultures with cortisol. Progesterone significantly inhibited lymphocyte thymidine incorporation at 10(-5) M (8.2% of control; P less than 0.01). No reversal of progesterone-induced suppression of thymidine incorporation was seen when RU 486 was added to cultures; rather, further suppression of thymidine incorporation was seen. RU 486 alone in culture at concentrations achieved therapeutically (10(-5) M) significantly inhibited thymidine incorporation (7.2% of control; P less than 0.01). These findings suggest that RU 486 may have dose-dependent mixed agonist/antagonist effects on cortisol-induced immunosuppression. The lack of an antagonist effect of RU 486 on progesterone suggests that progesterone's immunosuppressive effects may not be receptor mediated. Finally, our findings would suggest that some immunosuppression may be seen at currently used doses of RU 486.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between the endocrine system and immune monokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), is of increasing interest. IL-1, a protein secreted by peripheral monocytes and tissue macrophages, mediates a wide variety of immune responses, and its production appears to be inversely related to the level of gonadal steroids. In this report, we have investigated the relationship between estradiol and progesterone concentrations and the level of IL-1 beta mRNA in cultured human peripheral monocytes and pelvic macrophages. Human peripheral monocytes, isolated during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, were activated with lipopolysaccharide (10 micrograms/mL). Cellular RNA was isolated and analyzed by Northern analysis using an 800-basepair IL-1 beta cDNA probe. Hybridization with 32P-labeled probe showed maximal levels of IL-1 beta mRNA occurring between 3 and 7 h of culture. Cultures of lipopolysaccharide-activated human peripheral monocytes incubated for 3-6 h with increasing amounts of progesterone or estradiol (0-10(-5) M) in the presence of either 5% fetal calf serum or 0.1% BSA demonstrated an inverse relationship between IL-1 beta mRNA levels and steroid concentration. In both cases, IL-1 beta mRNA levels decreased by 80-90% as the progesterone concentration increased to 10(-5) M and by 70-90% as the estradiol concentration increased similarly. A similar 80% decrease in IL-1 beta mRNA was observed with peritoneal macrophages incubated with increasing amounts of progesterone. This reciprocal relationship between IL-1 beta mRNA and gonadal steroids may have important ramifications in reproductive biology for both embryonic implantation and fetal survival as well as for clinically relevant changes in bone mass.\r"

The frequency of HLP was significantly higher in diabetic subjects with apoE2 (73.9%) than in nondiabetic controls (37.5%). HLP in nondiabetic subjects with apoE2 included only type IV (n = 9), whereas HLP in diabetic subjects with apoE2 included type IIb (n = 1), type III (n = 7), and type IV (n = 9). Diabetic patients with apoE2 were characterized by increased levels of plasma triglyceride, total cholesterol (chol), very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-chol, and apoE and an increased VLDL-chol/VLDL-triglyceride ratio, i.e. the accumulation of remnants. In addition, fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin-A1 levels were significantly higher in hyperlipoproteinemic diabetic patients with apoE2 than in normolipidemic diabetic patients with apoE2. It is concluded that diabetes (poor metabolic control) predisposes apoE2 (epsilon 2)-carrying subjects to HLP (particularly type III) and that apoE2 may be one factor linking diabetes with HLP and cardiovascular disease.\r"

The addition of nicotine or cotinine to preparations of adrenal mitochondria yielded a type II cytochrome P-450 binding spectrum. The apparent spectral dissociation constants (Ks) for nicotine and cotinine binding to mitochondrial cytochrome P-450 were 20 and 19 microM, respectively. The addition of nicotine to preparations of adrenal microsomes yielded a type II cytochrome P-450 binding spectrum, with an apparent Ks of 70 microM. Adrenal mitochondrial 11 beta-hydroxylase was assayed by measuring the conversion of deoxycorticosterone to corticosterone. Nicotine and cotinine competitively inhibited 11 beta-hydroxylase, with apparent Michaelis-Menten inhibition constants (Ki) of 9.9 and 9.0 microM, respectively. Nicotine competitively inhibited microsomal 21-hydroxylase, with an apparent Ki of 110 microM. Cotinine, in concentrations as high as 1 mM, did not inhibit 21-hydroxylase. These results suggest that nicotine and cotinine inhibit 11 beta-hydroxylase by binding to the heme iron of the cytochrome P-450 component of this enzyme system. Inhibition of 11 beta-hydroxylase could contribute to the altered pattern of steroidogenesis observed in smokers.\r"

Bone density measurements and dynamic skeletal histomorphometry were also performed. Osteoporosis, as defined by arbitrary criteria, was found in 42 patients (39%), while no patient had osteomalacia. Serum concentrations of vitamin D-binding protein, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, total 1,25-(OH)2D, and free 1,25-(OH)2D were reduced in patients with cirrhosis, but not in the noncirrhotic patients. Bone formation rates, which were low in 55 patients (51%), were correlated with liver functions, but not with the concentrations of either vitamin D metabolite. A subgroup of 44 patients with low serum 1,25-(OH)2D concentrations and low bone formation rates failed to show an appropriate increase in serum bone Gla protein after 1,25-(OH)2D3 administration even though serum concentrations of 1,25-(OH)2D rose normally. These data suggest that the bone disease in patients with hepatic disorders is not related to the serum concentrations of vitamin D metabolites or the effect of these metabolites on osteoblast function.\r"

  ".W": "A PTH-related peptide (PTHRP) has been identified and its cDNA cloned from human tumors associated with the syndrome of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. The human PTHRP gene has been recently isolated and found to be a complex transcriptional unit using multiple promoters and containing alternatively spliced 3' exons which result in three mRNA classes, each class encoding a PTHRP with a unique carboxy-terminus. The PTHRP gene appears to be expressed in a number of normal tissues, and PTHRP transcripts have been previously reported to be overexpressed in a small sample of human parathyroid adenomas. In the present study we surveyed RNA prepared from a total of 60 abnormal human parathyroid glands for PTHRP gene expression using a combination of Northern blotting and RNase protection techniques. Apparent overexpression of PTHRP mRNA was observed in two thirds of parathyroid adenomas, whereas no overexpression was found in 7 examples of sporadic primary hyperplasia, 5 examples of secondary hyperplasia, and 3 examples of parathyroid carcinoma. Apparent overexpression was also observed in 1 of 4 cases of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, 1 of 2 examples of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, and 1 gland considered to represent tertiary hyperparathyroidism. Northern analysis of poly(A)+ RNA prepared from three representative adenomas using region-specific probes indicated that two putative promoters are used and revealed a pattern of preferential splicing of transcripts to include the most distal 3' exon. These findings suggest that the PTHRP gene is commonly overexpressed in adenomatous parathyroid glands, but not in sporadic primary hyperplasia, that this overexpression does not seem to be dependent on the use of a single specific promoter, and that adenomatous parathyroid cells appear to preferentially use one of several alternative splicing pathways. It is presently not known whether PTHRP is secreted by abnormal parathyroid tissues and, if so, in what form.\r"

  ".W": "In some cases of primary hyperparathyroidism, in particular where neck exploration has been unsuccessful, an alternative to surgical therapy may be desirable. We studied the acute and chronic metabolic effects of attempted angiographic destruction by angiographic contrast infusion of solitary parathyroid adenomas in 18 patients with symptomatic disease. Fourteen patients had failed prior surgery; 4 patients had not undergone prior surgery but were extremely high surgical risks. Cervical adenomas were present in 17 of 18 subjects; mediastinal adenoma in 1 of 18. Sixteen patients underwent selective parathyroid venous catheterization, which facilitated subsequent arteriographic localization. Selective arteriographic localization and attempted angiographic ablation were performed in all subjects with standard contrast, renografin-60. Laboratory studies, including serum calcium and PTH, were frequently performed before and after attempted angiographic parathyroid ablation. In all patients serum calcium fell to normal or subnormal levels within 48 h of attempted ablation. Prolonged follow-up (mean, 35.1 months) revealed that ablation was curative in 12 of 18 (sustained normocalcemia) and partially effective in 1 of 18 patients. For the entire group serum calcium fell from 3.14 +/- 0.07 at presentation to 2.42 +/- 0.07 mmol/L at the end of follow-up (or before surgery in unsuccessful cases; P less than 0.001). In 4 of 5 failed cases hypercalcemia recurred within 2 weeks. All 5 failed cases underwent curative surgery, aided by accurate localization achieved during angiographic procedure. Several transient complications and 1 case of permanent hypoparathyroidism were noted. We conclude that angiographic ablation of cervical parathyroid adenomas can be considered as an extension of diagnostic angiographic procedures in selected cases of primary hyperparathyroidism who have failed prior surgery of possibly in rare cases where surgery is contraindicated.\r"

Four of the eight cocaine abusers had hyperprolactinemia (range, 22.08-44.65 micrograms/L). Cocaine users as a group had significantly higher mean peak height (P less than 0.02) than control subjects. Cocaine users with hyperprolactinemia had higher mean peak height than control subjects or cocaine users with normal PRL levels (P less than 0.01). Cocaine users with hyperprolactinemia also had higher mean amplitude increments than control subjects (P less than 0.02). Cocaine users with hyperprolactinemia had a higher mean valley than controls (P less than 0.01) and cocaine users with normal PRL levels (P less than 0.03). However, there were no significant differences in PRL peak frequency, peak duration, or interpulse intervals between cocaine users with or without hyperprolactinemia and control subjects. There were minimal differences between cocaine users and control subjects in pulse frequency analysis of LH parameters; the small differences in mean LH levels and average interpulse interval were not in the abnormal range and were probably not biologically significant. No differences between cocaine users and controls were detected for pulse frequency analysis of testosterone or cortisol. Cocaine-induced hyperprolactinemia may contribute to disorders of sexual and reproductive function in men who abuse the drug, and recent reports that PRL modulates immune function suggest that cocaine-induced derangements of PRL secretion may also contribute to cocaine-related comorbidity in infectious disease. Since cocaine users with hyperprolactinemia had a higher mean valley as well as a higher peak pulse PRL height than control subjects, but did not have greater PRL pulse frequencies, we conclude that hyperprolactinemia in these men may be due to a cocaine-induced derangement of dopaminergic inhibition of basal PRL secretion.\r"

The etiological fraction values for HLA-DRw53 in seropositive HT and seronegative HT were 0.58 and 0.54, respectively. An increased frequency of HLA-DQw4 and a decreased frequency of HLA-DQw1 were observed in patients with seronegative HT. These data suggest that susceptibility to HT is primarily associated with HLA-DRw53 and that HLA-DQ alleles may control the production of autoantibodies to the thyroid gland. The mode of inheritance of disease susceptibility for HT (controlled by a major gene in linkage disequilibrium with HLA-DRw53) was investigated by the method of Thomson and Bodmer, and it was suggested that disease susceptibility was inherited in a dominant manner.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and IGF-II are associated in the blood with specific binding proteins (BPs), forming complexes that elute in gel filtration with estimated mol wt around 40 and 150 kD. The latter appears to be under GH control. Five molecular forms of BP (41.5, 38.5, 34, 30, and 24 kD) have been identified by Western blotting using 125I-labeled IGF. All five forms are present in the smaller complexes, but only the 41.5- and 38.5-kD forms are found in the larger complexes. In this study immunoblotting showed that the 41.5- and 38.5-kD forms were recognized by antibodies directed against the GH-dependent BP purified from human plasma, and the 30-kD form was recognized by antibodies directed against the BP purified from amniotic fluid. The 34- and 24-kD forms proved to be immunologically unrelated to the other three. In sera with large quantities of the 41.5- and 38.5-kD forms, an additional band was often observed immediately ahead of the migration front of the 30 kD band. This was recognized by the anti-GH-dependent BP antibody and probably corresponds to a degradation product of the 41.5- and 38.5-kD BPs. Serum 41.5- and 38.5-kD BPs have been found to be elevated in acromegaly, where GH hypersecretion causes increased IGF-I levels, and diminished in cases of genetic or idiopathic GH deficiency and defects of the GH receptor (Laron's syndrome), where both IGF-I and IGF-II are decreased, as well as in Pygmy adults and children who have isolated IGF-I deficiency. In all of these conditions, the proportions of the 34- and 30-kD forms were inversely related to those of the 41.5- and 38.5-forms. Under treatment, the BP profiles tended to return to normal. In cases of GH deficiency caused by a tumor, the BP profiles resembled those of hypopituitary or normal serum, depending on whether IGF levels were diminished or normal. It, therefore, seems that BP synthesis is coordinated with IGF-I synthesis and may not be directly GH dependent. The results of neutral pH gel filtration analysis of hypopituitary (idiopathic and tumoral) and normal sera point to a relationship between the levels of circulating IGFs and those of the 150-kD IGF-BP complex whose binding units are the 41.5- and 38.5-kD BPs. It, therefore, seems that the 150-kD complex controls the bioavailability of IGF-I and IGF-II.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Neither patient demonstrated ACTH gradients in the lavage specimens. One was found to have an ACTH-producing bronchial carcinoid 18 months after negative lavage.

An immunoreactive form corresponding to a human PST-like sequence [human chromogranin-A-(250-301)] and a larger form were detected by gel filtration of plasma from these patients, suggesting accumulation of the larger molecular form in these patients. A significant increase in PST-like immunoreactivity was also found in patients with liver cirrhosis (20.8 +/- 3.0 pmol/L), but not in patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, chronic pancreatitis, or pancreatic cancer.

One hundred and thirty eight (78%) of the respondents used immunocytochemical techniques: 64 used immunocytochemical kits, including 35 district general hospital and 29 teaching hospital laboratories. An extensive range of antibodies was being used on a variety of tissues, epithelial and lymphoid markers far exceeding all other antibodies. Several differences in the numbers of cases and the types of tissues studied were identified among laboratories. The techniques used, the problems encountered, and the procedures followed with unsatisfactory reagents were also analysed. Finally, an assessment of the resources allocated to immunocytochemistry, both in terms of staff and reagent costs was made. Taking into account the response rate of 56% and the uncertainty that all pathology departments in the United Kingdom had been circulated, the estimated annual total costs for immunocytochemistry for all pathology laboratories in the United Kingdom was 5.4 million pounds.\r"

In all cases and controls, sections of two or more blocks of lung tissue stained with haematoxylin and eosin were obtained at necropsy. Bronchial gland duct ectasia was diagnosed if there was more than one abnormally dilated epithelial lined protrusion from a bronchus, extending through the smooth muscle layer. A histological diagnosis of asthma was made if four of the five following criteria were present: mucus plugging, basement membrane thickening, epithelial shedding, submucosal eosinophil leucocyte infiltration and smooth muscle hypertrophy. A histological diagnosis of asthma was made in 53 of 72 clinical cases of fatal asthma and in five of 72 control subjects. Interstitial emphysema was present in 10 clinical cases of fatal asthma, all of whom had bronchial gland duct ectasia and a histological diagnosis of asthma. Interstitial emphysema was not observed in control subjects. It is concluded that bronchial gland duct ectasia is a common histological feature of severe asthma, and that interstitial emphysema may be consequent on rupture of these dilated gland ducts.\r"

Three patients survived for two years and one survived for five years, which was significantly worse when compared with poorly differentiated transitional cell carcinoma (WHO grade 3). Aggressive tumour behaviour was independent of the presence of neuroendocrine characteristics. Morphometric analysis showed that the nuclear size, which was comparable with that reported in pulmonary small cell carcinoma, was significantly smaller than in poorly differentiated transitional cell carcinoma. Nuclear morphometry may therefore help identify small cell bladder carcinoma, especially in the absence of neuroendocrine differentiation characteristics. DNA flow cytometry of paraffin wax embedded specimens showed aneuploidy in 14 tumours--five were peritetraploid and two multiple aneuploid--and only three were diploid. Aggressiveness of small cell bladder carcinoma usually coincides with aneuploidy in most cases, but diploid tumours may also follow a rapid, lethal clinical course.\r"

The amounts of PGF2 alpha varied greatly in the different tumours (range 0-90 ng/mg protein), but no significant association was found between PGF2 alpha concentrations and disease free survival, time of relapse, site of recurrence, or overall survival. It therefore seems unlikely that measurement of PGF2 alpha in breast carcinoma is important in the prognosis of the disease.\r"

In the most recently treated patients (1984-1987) 75% of drug resistant cases were malignant teratoma intermediate compared with 26% in the series treated between 1978-1983. The microscopic features of 52 primary testicular tumours were compared with features seen in excised retroperitoneal lymph nodes after completion of chemotherapy. Primary malignant teratoma intermediate had a higher incidence of viable malignancy in the excised tissue than malignant teratoma undifferentiated. Mature teratoma or fibronecrotic tissue within resected tissue was associated with a good prognosis. If resection was complete patients with drug resistant malignant teratoma intermediate had a more favourable prognosis than drug resistant malignant teratoma undifferentiated. It is advised that retroperitoneal node dissection should be considered in the management of patients with advanced germ cell testicular tumours, and that as complete a resection as possible be attempted to avoid the danger of missing residual disease.\r"

Eleven patients had CMV alone as the potential cause of symptoms and in seven there were coexistent pathogens or Kaposi's sarcoma. The appearance and type of infected cells at different sites was highly variable. Immunocytochemical techniques and electron microscopic examination were performed to confirm the presence of CMV antigen and CMV virus particles and to exclude the possibility of an adenovirus producing similar cytopathic changes. It is important to recognise the different morphological forms of infected cells, and the use of immunocytochemical techniques is recommended in patients at risk for CMV or in whom CMV infection is suspected.\r"

There was no significant difference in the time at which virus was first detected following transplantation between patients with primary CMV infection and those with reinfection or recurrent infection. In general, patients with primary infection shed virus consistently over long periods. Those with reinfection or recurrent infection shed virus intermittently or not at all. There were considerable differences between individual patients in the timing and pattern of the immune response. Taken overall, a four-fold rise detected by the complement fixation test correlated best with the onset of CMV shedding in primary infection. There was more variation in the pattern of antibody response in cases of reinfection or recurrent infection, with no single serological test correlating better than the others. It is concluded that serology is of limited value in the detection of active CMV infection after renal transplantation.\r"

Unfractionated white cells, separated under gravity, with pseudopodia or cytoplasmic irregularities were regarded as activated. The whole blood filterability rate was significantly increased at the onset of calf pain and was associated with significant increases in the number of leucocytes and in the filterability rate of the monocyte subfraction, the latter persisting throughout the recovery period.

Clinically important autoimmune haemolysis occurred in 15 patients, and was of \"warm\", \"cold,\" and \"mixed\" types in seven, four, and four cases, respectively: it is important to recognise its presence in view of the good response to treatment.

When the tests were repeated after a mean follow up of 70 months (range 14-137), parietal cell antibody and intrinsic factor antibody were positive in 82.8% and 58.7%, respectively. There was a definite but not significant trend for the organ specific parietal cell antibody to disappear; intrinsic factor antibody became more positive. These results may indicate that with progressive parietal cell destruction, the antigen is no longer available to sustain an immunological response. On the other hand, this hypothesis does not explain the increased prevalence of intrinsic factor antibody which is also a product of parietal cells.\r"

The reactions of three CD15 antibodies--anti-Leu M1, DM1, and Tu9--were examined in paraffin wax sections in Hodgkin's disease under a variety of different fixation and pre-treatment conditions, using four immunochemical detection techniques. All three antibodies stained Reed-Sternberg cells, but DM1 could be used at slightly higher dilutions to achieve comparable results. Tissue fixed in formol sublimate showed the most intense staining reactions, and formol saline and neutral buffered formalin gave relatively poor results. Although neuraminidase pre-treatment improved staining, its routine use is probably contraindicated by its high cost. Trypsinisation has some value for sections of tissue fixed in formol saline and neutral buffered formalin. The avidin-biotin complex technique produced the best results, but indirect immunoperoxidase produced acceptable results, is technically easier to perform, and is less expensive. It is concluded that information regarding variations in techniques and commercially available reagents, which may be of use in routine diagnostic histopathology, can be obtained by comparative quality assessment studies of this type.\r"

The method entails the centrifugation of the specimen, adding 1 ml AB or fetal calf serum and 1 ml 20% dimethyl sulphoxide aliquoted into 2 ml tubes, and storage at -70 degrees C. Cytological detail was well preserved in a variety of samples including fine needle aspirates, urine, and bronchial brushings. Three dimensional architecture was also preserved. The method is practical, easy to perform, and allows retrospective studies to be undertaken with the subsequent use of a variety of special staining techniques, including immunocytochemistry.\r"

CK determinations were performed in the laboratory or in the coronary care unit using a dry reagent strip analyser. Slope values for log CK/hour and log CK-MB/hour were calculated, used to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of myocardial infarction, and compared with diagnosis by conventional means. Compared with retrospective diagnosis using all available information, the CK slope had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 94%. This compared with a sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 90% for diagnosis using upper reference limits alone. Determination of CK slope permits very rapid and accurate biochemical confirmation or exclusion of myocardial infarction and the possibility of performing the measurements on the coronary care unit. It additionally offers the prospect of major cost savings resulting from early discharge or transfer from the coronary care unit.\r"

Quantitative immunoassay of urinary albumin and IgG on the first urine sample after admission showed increased excretion rates in 14 and 13 patients, respectively. Urinary protein excretion rates remained normal or approached normal by seven days in 17 patients who made uneventful recoveries. The maximum urinary excretion rates of both albumin and IgG within the first 36 hours correlated with the serum C-reactive protein concentration 72 hours after admission. The highest IgG excretion rates were found in three patients who later developed severe complications. These preliminary data suggest that low proteinuria is a very early response in acute pancreatitis, and that it may reflect the severity of inflammation.\r"

Chemiluminescence (corrected to a standard polymorphonuclear count) remained below normal (0.15-0.30 photons/second/cell) for most of the type 2 patients until 12 weeks when the value was significantly increased in patients showing improved glycaemic control (mean (range) 0.25 (0.01-0.43) photons/second/cell) compared with those showing no improvement (0.12(0.01-0.31) photons/second/cell). There was a significant inverse correlation of delta HbA1 with delta chemiluminescence. Although mean chemiluminescence for the type 1 diabetic patients was within the normal range, there was a wide scatter of values (0.19 (0.04-0.43) photons/second/cell) and there was no significant difference compared with the final value of type 2 patients with improved control. Glycaemic control is therefore a major determinant of phagocytic function in diabetic patients, but other factors must contribute, particularly in type 1 (insulin dependent) patients.\r"

Amplification of genomic N-myc was observed in six patients who had been treated with chemotherapy before surgery (one with stage III and five with stage IV). All these tumours were located in the adrenal or upper retroperitoneum; five were neuroblastomas and one was a ganglioneuroblastoma. Three of them were aneuploid and three diploid. The degree of N-myc patients with tumour N-amplification varied from 20 to 1500 copies without relation to ploidy. All patients with tumour N-myc amplification died of their tumour. Amplification was always associated with poor prognosis, independent of tumour cell ploidy. Four patients without such amplification also died: three had diploid tumours, the fourth was aneuploid. It is suggested that genomic N-myc amplification takes place mainly in adrenal and retroperitoneal neuroblastomas and can be a feature of tumours with and without histological signs of differentiation. The precise role of N-myc in the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma remains unclear.\r"

Thermogenic capacity of brown adipose tissue, estimated by radioimmunoassay of the specific mitochondrial membrane \"uncoupling protein\" responsible for heat production, was similar to that measured in other infants or in experimental animals acclimated to moderately warm conditions (23 degrees C). Brown adipose tissue thermogenesis, occurring inappropriately in a warm, well insulated infant, could be a cause of some cases of cot death.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether portal lymphadenopathy in primary biliary cirrhosis is caused by deposition of lipofuscin pigment in sinus histiocytes and to compare primary biliary cirrhosis with other liver diseases a retrospective study on a consecutive series of 169 livers obtained at transplantation was carried out. There were grouped into eight diagnostic categories: primary biliary cirrhosis (n = 51), primary sclerosing cholangitis (n = 10), extrahepatic biliary atresia (n = 6), chronic rejection (n = 9), cirrhosis (other causes) (n = 38), primary liver neoplasia (n = 21), acute liver disease (n = 20), and retransplantation (other) (n = 14). Lymph nodes were present in 66 specimens. Fifty of these contained granules of lipofuscin pigment. The highest incidence of lymph node enlargement and the largest amounts of pigment were present in cases of primary biliary cirrhosis. A similar pattern of lymph node enlargement was also commonly observed in other chronic cholestatic conditions (primary sclerosing cholangitis, biliary atresia, chronic rejection). Much less pigment was seen in nodes draining livers with non-cholestatic cirrhosis or primary tumours. Nodes were not found in acute liver disease. It is concluded that portal lymphadenopathy associated with lipofuscin is a common finding in various chronic cholestatic liver diseases. The pathogenesis of this lesion is uncertain. Most cases are asymptomatic with enlarged nodes which may be detected only at laperotomy or necropsy and may be wrongly attributed to neoplastic disease. Diagnostically, the finding of large amounts of lipofuscin in enlarged portal lymph nodes is a good indicator of underlying chronic cholestatic liver disease.\r"

Cell blocks from 42 pleural effusions, 25 peritoneal effusions, and 14 peritoneal washing specimens were stained with Con A (D-mannosyl, D-glucosyl), WGA (n-acetyl glucosamine), UEA-1 (L-fucose), SBA (n-acetyl galactosamine) and anti-CEA. Con A and WGA were not useful in discriminating mesothelial cells from adenocarcinomas. In contrast, UEA-1 and SBA binding was present in 30 of 46 (65%) and in 31 of 46 (67%), respectively, of adenocarcinomas tested, but negative in 21 cases with reactive mesothelial cells, 10 cases with benign mesothelial cells, and one case of mesothelioma. All mesothelial cells were also negative for CEA, but 24 of 46 (52%) of adenocarcinomas were positive. All three cases of lymphoma were negative with UEA-1, SBA, and anti-CEA. UEA-1 and SBA lectins identified a higher proportion of metastatic adenocarcinomas than CEA and stained most cases of adenocarcinomas metastatic from sites which usually fail to express CEA. Combination of staining results for UEA-1, SBA, and anti-CEA produced a test with high sensitivity and specificity, identifying 40 of 46 (87%) of adenocarcinomas tested, with no false positive results. It is concluded that UEA-1 and SBA staining of effusion specimens warrants further study, and may provide a useful adjunct to CEA staining.\r"
