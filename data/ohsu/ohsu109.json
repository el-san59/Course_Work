MH patients were identified by the halothane and halothane/caffeine contracture tests done in isolated muscle biopsy specimens. [Ca2+]i was measured in isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from MH patients and controls by means of the fluorescent calcium ion indicator quin2. In the absence of halothane there was no significant difference in [Ca2+]i in cells from normal and MH patients. Addition of halothane (4 microliter/ml) significantly increased [Ca2+]i in cells from MH patients but not in controls. The halothane-induced increase in [Ca2+]i required extracellular calcium ions. This is the first evidence of the mechanism of action of halothane in cells of MH patients; the differential effect of halothane on [Ca2+]i might constitute the basis for a non-invasive screening test for MH.\r"

  ".W": "Sera from 74 hepatitis B surface antigen-positive individuals, who presented with acute hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection which ran a self-limited course in 58 and progressed to chronicity in 16, were tested over time for HDV markers. In self-limited disease the serum pattern varied from early HD-antigenaemia followed by IgM and IgG anti-HD seroconversion, to the appearance of IgM and IgG anti-HD without antigenaemia, or the isolated expression of either the IgM or the IgG antibody. The typical case of IgM anti-HD was transient and appeared with a mean delay of 10-15 days from admission in the different serological subgroups. The IgG antibody usually developed several weeks later during convalescence. In contrast, patients with disease destined to become chronic had a brisk IgM antibody response and IgG anti-HD was detectable with a mean delay of 15 days; generally, the IgM and the IgG antibody persisted over the follow-up time. IgM antibody to HDV is often the only serological test positive in the clinical stage of hepatitis D and repeated testing for this marker is necessary to diagnose acute HDV co-infection. The serological follow-up provides important prognostic information: waning of IgM confirms resolution of HDV infection, persistence predicts chronicity.\r"

Black infants were less likely than whites to have CH, but were at twice the risk of additional impairment. Infants with CH who had an additional complication were screened (12.7 vs 4.8 days) and treated (32.4 vs 19.7 days) significantly later than those infants with isolated CH.

In the second cohort only one of the men at risk had a stroke, and the risk estimate did not differ significantly from unity. The absolute rates of stroke in both cohorts were lower than those reported in the Framingham study, implying a lesser potential benefit from preventive measures.

Yersinia may play a more important part in the aetiology of acute abdominal pain, and particularly acute appendicitis, than has been previously appreciated. Antibody titres to both Y enterocolitica and Y pseudotuberculosis frequently rise late in infections causing abdominal pain. Consequently analysis of acute-phase serum samples alone leads to underdiagnosis of yersiniosis.\r"

Na+-H+ exchange was measured indirectly in platelets as the rate of amiloride-sensitive and sodium-dependent volume gain of cells suspended in sodium-propionate; the cytoplasmic acidification induced by the permeant propionic acid activated the exchanger and the volume changes coupled to Na+ uptake were measured by cell sizing with a Coulter counter and 'Channelyzer'. The test was rapid, simple, and reproducible. 20 normotensives; 8 normotensives with a family history of hypertension; 15 patients with essential hypertension receiving medication; and 7 hypertensives who had not received any antihypertensive drugs were studied. The exchange rate constants of these groups were (mean [SE] in s-1 X 10(-3)) 13.1 (0.6); 15.5 (0.7); 18.4 (0.9); and 25.6 (2.8), respectively. The differences between hypertensives and normotensives were significant. Measurement of sodium-proton exchange in platelets may help to clarify the pathogenesis of hypertension.\r"

Acceleration of labour with oxytocin was significantly more common in the Irish group, and average duration of labour was shorter. No advantage to the infant, as measured by the Apgar score, resulted from the greater use of caesarean section for dystocia.\r"

Initial BP was a poor predictor of mortality from myocardial infarction, whereas treated systolic blood pressure (SBP) was a strong predictor. There was a J-shaped relation, confined to those with evidence of ischaemic heart disease, between frequency of death from myocardial infarction and treated DBP (phase V); the frequency was lowest at treated DBP of 85-90 mm Hg and rose with treated DBP on either side of this range.\r"

Diagnostic errors in certified causes of death in general, and coronary heart disease in particular, indicate that vital statistics are too unreliable for determining whether there has been an increase and a subsequent decline in the incidence of coronary heart disease.\r"

  ".W": "Seventeen Caucasian patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) contracted after long stays in Africa are reported. Central Africa was concerned in all cases. Men are particularly exposed to AIDS whatever their occupation. This study suggests that the risk of contracting AIDS in Africa is high; the transmission of the virus was related to sexual contact, particularly with prostitutes, in Africa in most of the cases. It suggests also that Caucasians who travel in Africa spread the virus throughout the world by means of their heterosexual relations.\r"

Hypertension control was determined by physician judgment, and adjustment was assessed by Derogatis' (1977) Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale. Potential predictors of the outcome variables were measured by structured interview, formal instruments, and chart review. Well-controlled hypertensive patients had better health adjustment scores, reported more illness-related job problems and less illness-related sexual problems, were more satisfied with health care, knew what to do about medication side effects, were on medications longer, and had lower blood pressure readings on chart review. Well-adjusted hypertensive patients had fewer hypertension-related problems; had their blood pressure under control; were less likely to eat, smoke, or use drugs to handle tension; had no recent weight gain; knew what to do about medication side effects and that there is no cure for hypertension; were less pessimistic and less likely to worry; rated their stress level lower and their quality of life higher; felt that their health was under their own control; tried to problem solve when coping with stress; were on hypertensive medications a shorter time and on fewer medications overall; did not like to be alone when feeling stressed; and ate fewer high sodium foods.\r"

Data were analyzed from 14 nursing doctoral programs that participated in both a 1979 and a 1984 study using Educational Testing Service Graduate Program Self-Assessment questionnaires. Findings suggest that doctoral programs experienced a significant growth and maintained a quality environment. Faculty demonstrated an increased commitment to scholarly activities as evidenced by an increase in publications, presentations, and perceptions of time spent on such projects. Students admitted in 1984 had higher entrance grade point averages than students admitted in 1979; more pursued their graduate education on a part-time basis. The evidence documents a growing scholarly maturity in nursing doctoral programs.\r"

Factors found to relate directly to frequency of BSE practice were high perceived benefits of BSE, low perceived barriers to BSE, and high self-concept. Correlations with perceived susceptibility/seriousness of breast cancer, age, perceived level of social support, and social network properties were not significant. A multiple regression analysis was done with BSE frequency as criterion variable: perceived threat (susceptibility/seriousness) and perceived benefits minus perceived barriers were entered hierarchically; age, self-concept, and total social support were entered as a group. Perceived benefits minus barriers was the only significant predictor variable, R2 = .27. These findings underline the importance of assessing detective behaviors such as BSE as potentially different from preventive behaviors.\r"

Based on responses from 952 adults in midwestern communities, the Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile was evaluated using item analysis, factor analysis, and reliability measures. Factor analysis isolated six dimensions: Self-Actualization, Health Responsibility, Exercise, Nutrition, Interpersonal Support, and Stress Management. These six factors accounted for 47.1% of the variance in the 48-item measure. Second-order factor analysis yielded a single factor, interpreted as Health-Promoting Lifestyle. The alpha reliability coefficient for the total scale is .922; alpha coefficients for the subscales range from .702 to .904. Further evaluation of the measure with different populations appears warranted. This instrument will enable researchers to investigate patterns and determinants of health-promoting life-style, as well as the effects of interventions to alter life-style.\r"

Howard's (1975) theoretical model of dimensions pertinent to the domain of humanistic care was used to structure the scale. The dimensions are irreplaceability, holistic selves, freedom of action, status equality, shared decision making and responsibility, empathy, and positive affect. A 163-item scale reflective of Howard's dimensions was developed and distributed to 316 nursing personnel employed in four hospitals which included public, private, community, and university-affiliated health care facilities. Rigorous application of reliability and validity indexes yielded a final scale of 70 items measuring four dimensions: shared decision making and responsibility, holistic selves, status equality, and empathy. The Scale of Humanistic Nursing Behaviors can be used both as a diagnostic aid and as an instructional device.\r"

As part of a larger study of adjustment to burn injury, 260 adults who had sustained a burn injury over a 12-year period consented to complete the Billings and Moos Coping Responses Scale (CRS; Moos, Cronkite, Billings, & Finney, 1984) and the Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale (PAIS; Deragotis & Lopez, 1983). A clinician made a global assessment of each subject's adjustment. Three ways of scoring the CRS were used for analyses: Method and Foci of coping (Indices of Coping Responses), as suggested by Moos et al. (1984), new factor analysis, and separate responses. Stepwise multiple regression analysis of each of these with three different outcomes of adjustment (PAIS, global clinical judgment scores, and the PAIS psychological distress component) gave consistent results. The more adjusted burn survivors used more problem-solving coping responses and fewer avoidance responses. The two responses in the individual multiple regression analysis gave a higher correlation than the factor or index descriptors. These two responses correlated well with all three adjustment outcomes, r = .49, .37, and .47. The relationship between coping behavior and adjustment to illness was not sensitive to the different ways of scoring the CRS.\r"

Social support variables (perceived availability of social support, perceived effectiveness of social support, and personal constraints to the use of social support) were hypothesized to effect coping responses both directly and through the variable of threat appraisal. Coping responses (use of social support, cognitive reappraisal, emotion-focused coping, and problem-focused coping) were hypothesized to directly effect coping effectiveness and to mediate the effect of all other variables. Data from 50 functionally disabled, wheel-chair-bound individuals discharged within 3 years from two rehabilitation facilities were analyzed using path analysis. The model fit the data and accounted for 61% of the variance in coping effectiveness. Findings indicated that perceived availability of social support, but not the use of social support, was significantly and positively related to coping effectiveness through the mediating variables of problem- and emotion-focused coping. In contrast to the relationship of marital status to coping effectiveness usually found in the literature, nonmarried subjects coped more effectively and perceived less threat.\r"

Although their lung function may remain normal, neuromuscular disease predisposes to breathing at low lung volumes and to elimination of sighing respirations, a breathing pattern which predisposes to development of airway and alveolar collapse. As ventilatory reserve decreases, risk of progressive atelectasis and secretion retention is increased. Prompt recognition of the signs and symptoms of this nursing diagnosis can prevent or reverse problems relating to ineffective airway clearance. Nursing management thus becomes the cornerstone of the individual's regimen of care.\r"

The goal of the interventions is to modify the cause (malnutrition) of the nursing diagnosis (altered breathing pattern). The success of the interventions will lead to the achievement of expected outcome As expected outcomes are achieved, relief of signs and symptoms related to the nursing diagnosis will occur. The nurse caring for the patient with actual or potential malnutrition must be knowledgeable about the physiology of malnutrition and effect on breathing pattern. It is essential that the nurse assess and provide appropriate nutritional support and evaluate progress toward expected outcomes. In the event that expected outcomes are not achieved, reassessment with modification of interventions is necessary. Nurses play a key role in the total health care delivery to these complex patients. Further study will strengthen the research base of nursing interventions.\r"

Block in this region ranges from simply an increased conduction time across the AV junction (first-degree block) through occasionally blocked conduction of supraventricular impulses (second-degree block) to selective block in the ventricular conduction system (BBB and hemiblocks) and finally to complete block of impulses between the atria and the ventricles. When complete block occurs, the heart is stimulated by two separate pacemakers, one above the AV node, usually the sinus node, and one below the block, either an intrinsic pacemaker or an implanted electronic device. For block to be recognized in monitored patients, the EKG lead chosen must be one in which both atrial and ventricular electrical activity can be clearly identified.\r"

Large-T antigen was detected early in lens development; it elicited morphological changes and specifically interfered with differentiation of lens fiber cells. Both alpha- and beta-crystallins persisted in many of the lens tumor cells, while gamma-crystallin was selectively reduced. Accessibility, characteristic morphology, and defined protein markers make this transparent epithelial eye tissue a potentially useful system for testing tumorigenicity of oncogenes and for studying malignant transformation from its inception until death of the animal.\r"

The mean level was 163 +/- 85 (SD) micrograms/L and significantly increased (p less than 0.001) compared with the levels in control subjects (19 +/- 18 micrograms/L). The BAL fluid concentrations of myeloperoxidase (MPO) were also significantly increased in ARDS, indicating a local neutrophil activation. A significant correlation was found between BAL fluid ECP and MPO, suggesting a common activator of eosinophils and neutrophils. No relation was seen between BAL fluid ECP or MPO and degree of complement consumption, suggesting that other mechanisms besides complement activation may underlie granulocyte activation in ARDS. Lavage ECP levels correlated strongly with the severity of lung damage defined by pulmonary oxygenation index (PaO2/inspired fraction of O2). Activation of eosinophils, neutrophils, and the complement system is not specific for ARDS but was also observed in patients after major surgery, but at a significantly lower level (p less than 0.001). It is concluded that eosinophil activation is part of the inflammatory process in the lung in ARDS. The association observed between elevated lavage fluid levels of ECP and reduced pulmonary function in ARDS might reflect a pathophysiologic role for ECP and other cytotoxic eosinophil products in this syndrome and should be evaluated.\r"

  ".W": "The upper airway epithelium is coated with fibronectin, a glycoprotein that covers receptor sites for gram-negative bacteria and prevents them from colonizing the oropharynx. We investigated the identity of salivary proteolytic enzymes capable of degrading fibronectin in a group of 16 patients who had elective cardiac surgery. Six patients became colonized with gram-negative bacteria (Group C) and 10 did not (Group NC). Salivary elastase activity was low in both groups preoperatively. Twenty-four hours after surgery, salivary elastase activity increased in Group C, and it remained elevated at 48 and at 72 h. Fibronectin digestive activity of the saliva of patients in Group C was also increased within 24 h of surgery, and salivary elastase and fibronectin digestive activity were highly correlated (r = 0.86, p less than 0.001). Enzyme inhibition experiments showed that most of the fibronectin digestive activity was due to elastase from polymorphonuclear cells (PMN), and the molecular weight of the salivary enzyme digesting fibronectin was 30,000 daltons (similar to the molecular weight of elastase). Levels of antileukoprotease, the major elastase inhibitor in saliva, were normal in patients with increased elastase activity. We conclude that salivary elastase is of PMN origin, increases prior to gram-negative bacillary colonization of the pharynx, and is responsible for most of the fibronectin digestive activity of the saliva.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the influence of the elastase inhibitor, eglin-c, on lung host defense, normal CD-1 mice were challenged intratracheally with type 3 Streptococcus pneumoniae suspended in phosphate-buffered saline alone or containing 10 mg/ml eglin-c. After infection with 5 X 10(3) colony-forming units (cfu), animals given eglin-c demonstrated a significant enhancement in their capacity to clear viable pneumococci from the lungs at 24 h after challenge; the augmented pulmonary clearance was associated with an increased influx of granulocytes at 6 and 24 h. After challenge with higher inocula (5 X 10(4) and 5 X 10(5) cfu), animals treated with eglin-c exhibited a significant impairment in pulmonary clearance at 6 h; however, in the presence of larger numbers of granulocytes within the bronchoalveolar spaces, the attenuation in pulmonary clearance resolved between 6 and 24 h. Changes in the kinetics of pulmonary clearance that were similar to those noted after infection with high pneumococcal inocula were also observed after challenge with 1 X 10(6) cfu Staphylococcus aureus. In addition, although it did not influence the in vivo phagocytic capacity of resident alveolar against S. aureus, eglin-c depressed the bactericidal activity of these cells. We conclude that in the mouse, high doses of eglin-c alter pulmonary antimicrobial mechanisms important for preventing and eradicating bacterial infection of the lower respiratory tract.\r"

Bacteriophage typing was discrepant in nine (56%) of the 17 repeated analyses compared with one (3.4%) of the 29 for plasmid profiling. These typing methods revealed that the epidemic strain was introduced to the hospital from the community 15 months before the outbreak. The outbreak was caused by cross-transmission of the epidemic strain by health care personnel and was controlled by treatment of colonized personnel, education of personnel, and institution of barrier precautions for colonized or infected patients. Plasmid profiling with restriction endonuclease digestion was easier, more rapid, and more specific than bacteriophage typing in the evaluation of this outbreak.\r"

  ".W": "We studied serum elastase 1 concentrations in patients with pancreatic disease to assess its diagnostic value and compare its sensitivity and specificity with that of amylase and pancreatic isoamylase. Markedly raised concentrations of elastase 1 were found in all twenty-nine patients with acute pancreatitis (amylase was elevated in all but three and pancreatic isoamylase in all but one). Serial measurements of the three enzymes in acute pancreatitis showed that elastase remained elevated longer than amylase and pancreatic isoamylase. The majority of chronic pancreatitis patients studied during a painful relapse (16 out of 21, 76 per cent) had elastase concentrations above the upper normal limit. Amylase and pancreatic isoamylase were elevated in 11 (52 per cent) and in 13 (62 per cent), respectively. Most patients with chronic pancreatitis studied during clinical remission (39 out of 43) had serum elastase levels either within (n = 24) or below (n = 15) the control range. The latter had severe exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and steatorrhoea. In carcinoma of the pancrease, 20 out of 32 (63 per cent) had abnormal serum elastase concentrations; 16 were higher and 4 lower than the control range. Amylase was abnormal in 10 (31 per cent) (8 high, 2 low), and pancreatic isoamylase was abnormal in 16 (50 per cent) (11 high, 5 low). In 46 control patients with non-pancreatic abdominal pain, serum elastase concentrations were not significantly different from those in healthy controls. Elastase was slightly raised in two, whereas amylase and pancreatic isoamylase were elevated in seven and eight, respectively. We conclude that serum elastase 1 is a highly sensitive and specific indicator of pancreatic disease.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was devised to investigate, whether reduction of membrane surface area would contribute to enhanced dialyzer membrane compatibility. Therefore, 10 hemodialysis patients were dialyzed with three different cuprophan dialyzers, displaying membrane surface areas of 0.9 m2, 1.2 m2, and 1.8 m2. As an index of biocompatibility release of granulocyte elastase and secretion of granulocyte lactoferrin were determined by enzyme-linked immunoassays. With the three cuprophan membranes, marked leukopenia occurred 15 min after the start of hemodialysis, without significant distinction between the different membranes. On the other hand, the release of leukocyte elastase was strictly dependent on the membrane surface area. Thus, at the end of dialysis, plasma levels of elastase were as follows: 0.9 m2: 255 +/- 51; 1.2 m2: 356 +/- 65; 1.8 m2: 471 +/- 56 ng/ml. The magnitude of secretion of leukocytic lactoferrin was also dependent on membrane surface area. Therefore, the increment during dialysis was 300% with the 1.2 m2 membrane compared to 650% using a 1.8 m2 dialyzer. Based upon these data, we concluded that, using measurements of granulocyte degranulation as an index of biocompatibility, reduction of membrane area resulted in a marked improvement of membrane compatibility.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of amiloride administration on the urinary kallikrein response to the injection or continuous infusion of frusemide in normal Sprague-Dawley rats was investigated. Injections of frusemide induced repeatedly an increase in urinary kallikrein excretion. This effect was suppressed by amiloride. Amiloride also blocked the response to mannitol injection. A continuous infusion of frusemide lasting 100 min also induced an increase in urinary kallikrein excretion which persisted throughout the experiment. This response was completely blocked by the injection of amiloride. Urinary kallikrein excretion was directly and positively related to urine volume and urinary sodium excretion before and after amiloride injection. The regression lines had markedly decreased slopes after amiloride administration. The urinary kallikrein excretion was also positively related to the urine volume and urinary sodium excretion when frusemide was continuously infused. However, these relationships were abolished after amiloride injection. In both the injection and the infusion experiments, there was a direct relationship of urinary kallikrein excretion to urinary potassium excretion. Although this relationship persisted after amiloride injection, the regression line was shifted to the left. The suppression of the kallikrein stimulating effect of frusemide by the sodium channel blocker amiloride indicates that distal tubule sodium reabsorption is the triggering factor in urinary kallikrein excretion. The study suggests that the mechanism involved in the release of kallikrein by the distal tubular cells is linked to the renal mechanism affected by amiloride.\r"

Studies were performed on isolated strips of transverse abdominis and external oblique muscle from nine adult hamsters with normal lung function. The effect of chronic hyperinflation on the two muscles was assessed in eight hamsters with elastase-induced emphysema. In normal animals the maximal active tension per cross-sectional area (Po) was equal in the two muscles. The absolute muscle fiber length at which Po occurred (Lo) was less for the external oblique than the transverse abdominis and the length-tension curve operated at shorter fiber lengths. However, the change in tension produced by an increase or decrease in muscle length expressed in relative terms (i.e., as %Lo) was greater for the transverse abdominis than the external oblique. Mean total lung capacity of emphysematous animals was 198% of control. Po of the transverse abdominis and external oblique were the same in emphysematous and control animals. However, Lo and the length-tension curve of the transverse abdominis occurred at shorter fiber lengths in emphysematous animals because of a reduction in the number of sarcomeres in series along the fiber. The length-tension curve and the number of sarcomeres in the external oblique was the same in emphysematous and control animals. These results in normal animals indicate that the magnitude of the change in active and passive tension produced by a change in muscle length differs in the transverse abdominis and external oblique. Moreover, chronic hyperinflation of the thorax produced by elastase injection alters the length-tension relationships of some but not all the expiratory muscles.\r"

  ".W": "Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) was shown to be a potent stimulator of neutrophil actin polymerization as detected by right-angle light scatter and rhodamine-phalloidin staining of F-actin. When we compared the kinetics of this neutrophil cytoskeletal response to the chemoattractants formylpeptide and LTB4, we observed that the response to LTB4 was markedly shorter-lived. To understand the basis of this result, we re-examined the kinetics of superoxide generation, elastase release, intracellular calcium elevation, and phosphoinositide metabolism in neutrophils stimulated with LTB4 and N-formylhexapeptide. LTB4 was relatively inefficient in producing superoxide and in releasing elastase. Although both responses were initiated with similar rapidity, they turned off sooner with LTB4 as compared with N-formylhexapeptide stimulation. Intracellular calcium elevation, a signal that is necessary for superoxide generation and degranulation, was of similar magnitude but of shorter duration in response to LTB4 as compared with the N-formylhexapeptide. The LTB4-induced rise of phosphatidic acid also was not sustained as long as the N-formylhexapeptide-induced increase. Prior exposure of neutrophils to LTB4 did not inhibit subsequent stimulation of superoxide generation by N-formylhexapeptide. Thus, the inability of LTB4 to stimulate superoxide generation was not due to LTB4-induced global inhibitory signals. The deficiency in LTB4-induced superoxide and elastase responses may be related to short-lived LTB4-induced activation signals and/or the number of receptors contributing to these responses.\r"

We report our findings of HIV in brain biopsies. Virus was detected in oligodendroglial and astroglial cells. Virus was also present in the brain capillaries, both in lumens and at the endothelial gaps. Virus was also found in extracellular spaces. Budding forms of the developing virus and bar-shaped nucleoids of mature virus, the diagnostic hallmark of the HIV retrovirus, were identified in brain tissue of five of seven patients with AIDS studied. We believe that HIV may enter the the brain via the vascular capillaries (through the endothelial gaps), bind to brain cells containing T4 receptors, enter the cells, and replicate. There follows a reactive hyperplasia and degeneration of oligodendroglial and astroglial cells. The oligodendroglial cells are the myelin-forming cells, and thus, the result is myelin degeneration.\r"

Both strains adenylylated streptomycin at the 3'' position. Neither strain could be cured of its streptomycin resistance by novobiocin, acridine orange, or ethidium bromide. Attempts to pass the resistance into two recipients were unsuccessful. Agarose gel electrophoresis and cesium chloride gradients failed to reveal plasmid bands. This is the first report of high-level streptomycin resistance mediated by modifying enzymes among viridans streptococci. It is possible that endemic streptomycin resistance among viridans streptococci will develop.\r"

I feel an enthusiasm by the professionals in those positions to pursue development activities that will help them do their jobs better and with less discomfort. Nurse executives obviously know the power of combining knowledge with experience. How do the different leadership and management development needs identified by these NE fit with your organization's needs? What is the content in your leadership and management development programs? Are your programs meeting the real needs of your executive and management-level staff? One way to find out is to do a simple survey. Today, nurse executives are responsible and accountable for challenges we never considered possible, even a few years ago. But along with the new challenges came the flexibility and positive attitudes of NEs to respond to changes and acquire new skills such as cost accounting, computers, or marketing. It's this type of proactive thinking that helps nurse leaders turn problems into opportunities and their situations into success stories.\r"

Normal ectocervical biopsies from 9 of 26 (35%, 95% CI 16-53%) control women contained HPV 16 DNA, and none showed evidence of integration. HPV 16 DNA positivity did not correlate with marital or sexual history, parity, use of oral contraceptives, or smoking habits in cases or controls, or with outcome of treatment in cases. HPV 16 DNA positivity was found less frequently with age less than 40 years old than with age greater than 40 in both cases (p less than 0.05) and controls (p less than 0.01). After age-adjustment there was no significant difference between cases and controls in frequency with which HPV 16 DNA was found. These data suggest that the association between HPV 16 and cervical neoplasia is age-mediated and that the presence of the viral genome may not always warrant intervention.\r"

After fractionation of these antigens by size, with gel filtration high performance liquid chromatography, sera from patients with clinically different forms of systemic vasculitis, Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) and microscopic polyarteritis (MP), showed contrasting specificities of binding. WG sera bound to 100, 6.2, and 1.8 kD components, whereas MP sera bound only to the 100 kD component, allowing immunological distinction between the syndromes. The 100 kD component recognised by both WG and MP sera also showed alkaline phosphatase activity. Further evidence for this association was obtained by direct binding experiments between systemic vasculitis sera and calf-intestinal or human neutrophil alkaline phosphatase and by the cross-reactivity of W8, a monoclonal antibody raised to a neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantigen, with various preparations of the enzyme.\r"

In these patients the incidence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was high: Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated cumulative incidences of AIDS of 22.8% within 2 years after herpes zoster, 45.5% within 4 years, and an estimated 72.8% after 6 years. Severity of zoster (relative risk, RR = 4.6), degree of pain (RR = 3.4), and zoster of the cranial or cervical dermatomes (RR = 2.2) were all associated with a poor outcome. Oral thrush, oral hairy leucoplakia, amoebiasis, and superficial (tinea) fungal infections also indicated an increased risk of AIDS among zoster patients. Oral thrush and oral hairy leucoplakia manifestations were diagnosed an average of 1.2 and 1.1 years, respectively, after the diagnosis of herpes zoster; thus zoster is an early indicator of an impaired immunity. Herpes zoster can be used as a predictor of AIDS and in AIDS risk groups should be regarded as a poor prognostic sign.\r"

Also recorded were their anthropometric data, dietary habits, possession of antibodies to malaria, and serum IgG concentrations. About 85% of the study population consumed cassava root at least once a day. The mean (SD) capillary random blood glucose concentration was 5.1 (1.1) mmol/l in men and 5.1 (0.6) in women. The mean (SD) body mass index was 20.2 (1.8) in men and 20.7 (2.3) in women. The mean blood glucose was similar whether cassava was consumed once daily, more than once daily, or less than once daily. None of the 1381 subjects examined had diabetes. This finding suggests that a high carbohydrate/cassava intake (84% of a mean daily supply of 1916 calories) combined with a low protein consumption (8% of caloric supply) does not cause diabetes. This does not support the World Health Organisation hypothesis that malnutrition-related diabetes exists, at least not in this West African rural population.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the predictive value of prolongation of visual evoked response (VER) plus the presence of oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) in patients with isolated cord lesions, the false-positive rate for the two tests combined was determined by a prospective analysis of 42 patients with a structural spinal cord lesion. The false-positive rate for the combination of VER and CSF abnormalities was zero, but the individual false-positive rates were 10% for VER and 12% for CSF protein oligoclonal bands. According to Bayes' theorem, and taking into account the false-positive rates of the tests in the population studied and the prevalence of MS and the true-positive rates for the tests as derived from published reports, abnormalities of VER and CSF protein together gave a probability of MS of 100%. However, if only either the VER or the CSF were abnormal, the probability of MS was 44% or 49%, respectively. An abnormal result for both tests thus indicates a sufficiently high probability of MS to exclude myelography, but a positive result in only one test warrants the procedure.\r"

  ".W": "It has been proposed that the effectiveness of medical treatment should be measured by mortality from specified diseases for which death is apparently avoidable given appropriate medical intervention. Unfortunately, that proposal was not supported by direct analysis of the relation between health care resources and avoidable mortality--an analysis which is essential for establishing the validity of avoidable mortality as an indicator of the outcome of health care. Thus the proposal does not yet have any basis, theoretical or practical. A more realistic but still oversimple model is now proposed. With presently available data, however, the validity of avoidable mortality is unlikely to be established, even by this model.\r"

Patients awaiting operations for hernia, varicose veins, arthroscopy, cataract, tonsils and adenoids, or sterilisation made up 45% of the lists. 45% of patients had already waited over a year for treatment, and it was evident that many of the lists had not been properly reviewed.\r"
