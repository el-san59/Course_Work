  ".W": "The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the diagnostic value of mediastinal sonography, compared with that of chest radiographs and CT, in the follow-up of patients with mediastinal lymphomas and in the prediction of clinical outcome. The sonograms, chest radiographs, and CT scans of 40 consecutive patients with Hodgkin (n = 29) and non-Hodgkin (n = 11) lymphoma obtained before and after completion of therapy were analyzed blindly and independently by three radiologists and compared with clinical outcome. Nine patients were treated with radiotherapy, 12 with chemotherapy, and 19 with combined therapy. Therapeutic response was assessed from all available clinical and biochemical findings as well as from the combined results of all imaging studies performed on further follow-up. The sonograms showed obvious changes in the size and echogenicity of the mediastinal lymphomas that corresponded closely with the response to therapy. Sonography showed complete regression of the lymphomas in 30 patients who had complete remission. In five patients with incomplete remission, sonographic diagnoses were correct. All lymph nodes, irrespective of size, detected with sonography after a phase of complete remission indicated recurrence (five patients). Sonographic findings corresponded with those of CT in 25 (81%) of 31 cases. Clinical outcome suggested that the sonographic findings were more reliable in the five cases in which CT and sonographic findings conflicted. Chest radiographs were inadequate for monitoring the response of mediastinal lymphomas to therapy; in 17 (43%) of 40 cases, a false impression was obtained of the extent and therapeutic response of mediastinal lymphomas. The results of this study indicate that sonography is clearly superior to chest radiographs and comparable to CT for monitoring patients with mediastinal lymphomas.\r"

  ".W": "The role of CT in determining the need for angiography in patients with possible thoracic vascular injury resulting from blunt trauma is controversial. During a 24-month period, we prospectively evaluated the results of CT to screen 90 patients with a history of decelerating thoracic trauma for evidence of mediastinal hemorrhage or great vessel abnormality. All patients either had equivocally abnormal mediastinal contours on chest radiographs (64%) or had technically suboptimal chest radiographs owing to body habitus or restriction to the supine projection (36%). Patients with unequivocal signs of mediastinal hemorrhage on chest radiographs underwent immediate arteriography without prior CT. Thoracic CT was interpreted as normal in 63 (77%) patients and no further imaging was performed. Five patients had technically suboptimal CT studies, and CT scans were interpreted as equivocal in six. These 11 patients had normal arteriograms. Sixteen CT scans (18%) demonstrated evidence of mediastinal hemorrhage and/or great vessel contour abnormality. Four (27%) of 15 patients who underwent arteriography had injury to the great vessels. One patient refused to undergo angiography. In 11 patients with CT evidence of mediastinal hemorrhage, major vascular injury was not seen on arteriography. These results suggest a valuable role for CT in determining the need for arteriography to detect potential great vessel injury in patients with blunt decelerating thoracic trauma and equivocally abnormal mediastinal contours on chest radiographs.\r"

  ".U": "91096654\r", 
  ".W": "The pathogenesis of pulmonary edema that occurs during interleukin-2 therapy has often been attributed to an increase in pulmonary capillary permeability. However, renal insufficiency, fluid overload, and hypotension also develop in many patients. These manifestations of systemic toxicity may contribute to the development of pulmonary edema during therapy. Understanding the cause of pulmonary edema during interleukin-2 therapy could directly affect patients' care. Therefore, we reviewed the chest radiographs and clinical course of 54 patients who received high-dose interleukin-2 therapy and lymphokine-activated killer cells for advanced carcinoma. The type, frequency, and course over time of pulmonary abnormalities were recorded and correlated with clinical measures of renal function, fluid status, and blood pressure. Focal or diffuse parenchymal lung opacities were found on radiographs in 43 (80%) of 54 patients. Findings of interstitial pulmonary edema were most common, occurring in 76% of patients. Weight gain, hypotension, and elevation of the serum creatinine level were not associated statistically with interstitial edema. Diffuse air-space disease developed in 20% of patients. Focal consolidation, which was associated with positive central venous catheter cultures (p less than .03), developed in 28% of patients. Pleural effusion occurred in 48% of patients and was associated with all types of parenchymal disease. These data suggest that the frequent development of pulmonary edema during interleukin-2 therapy is not due to renal insufficiency, fluid overload, or hypotension, but is more likely the result of an interleukin-2-related increase in pulmonary capillary permeability.\r"

  ".W": "Oropharyngeal functional impairment increases with age so that radiologists frequently are asked to determine the cause of aspiration in elderly patients. Neuromuscular and cognitive impairment often make it difficult to perform and interpret videofluoroscopic deglutition examinations in these patients. We retrospectively reviewed the barium swallow examinations in 50 elderly patients (mean age, 87 years) who were known to aspirate. We looked for specific patterns of oropharyngeal dysfunction that resulted in bolus misdirection. Analysis revealed that aspiration was due to abnormalities of the oral stage in 23, pharyngeal stage in 10, and both stages in 17. Dysfunction in the oral stage was due to ingestion of large volumes or rapid acquisition rates in nine, failure of containment during processing (bolus manipulation) in 18, and dissociation of lingual delivery and swallowing initiation in the transitional phase in 13. Dysfunction in the pharyngeal stage was due to incomplete transport (bolus retention) in 21 and defective closure of the laryngeal vestibule in 11. No significant relationship between conditions known to cause oropharyngeal dysfunction (dementia, stroke, Parkinson disease, disuse deconditioning) and the specific pattern of dysfunction was identified. These results indicate that an accurate and valid assessment of oropharyngeal dysfunction in elderly patients with aspiration is possible if specific patterns of dysfunction are sought. Our study indicates the importance of evaluating the oral and pharyngeal stages of deglutition in elderly patients who aspirate.\r"

  ".U": "91096657\r", 
  ".W": "MR imaging and CT were performed prospectively in 35 patients with esophageal carcinoma to determine the resectability of the primary tumors, because at our institution patients with resectable tumors have surgery regardless of the presence of distant metastases. Tumors with evidence of aortic or tracheobronchial invasion on MR or CT were considered to be unresectable. Tracheobronchial invasion was diagnosed when the tumor extended into the lumen of the airway, and aortic invasion was diagnosed when the triangular fat space between the esophagus, aorta, and spine adjacent to the primary tumor was obliterated. Two patients were excluded because of suboptimal MR images produced by motion artifacts. Pathologic proof was obtained from either surgery or autopsy in 31 patients. Of these, six patients (19%) had proved unresectable tumors (three aortic invasion and three tracheobronchial invasion). In all six cases, these features were correctly detected with both MR and CT. One patient had false-positive findings on MR and CT. An indeterminate diagnosis was obtained with MR in three patients and with CT in four patients. These incorrect or indeterminate results were all related to the diagnosis of aortic invasion. No patient had a false-negative result. When indeterminate diagnoses were considered false-positive, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for resectability were 100%, 84%, and 87%, respectively, for MR and 100%, 80%, and 84%, respectively, for CT. We conclude that MR and CT have nearly the same accuracy in predicting resectability of tumors in patients with esophageal carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "Quantification of hepatic fat content by application of MR phase-contrast imaging (Dixon method) at 1.5 T was compared with results of biopsy in 16 patients with a variety of liver abnormalities. Motion artifact was suppressed by employing six or eight averages of short TR in-phase (echo offset, 0 msec), out-of-phase (echo offset, 1.1 msec), and in-phase (echo offset, 2.2 msec) spin-echo pulse sequences. The 360 degree out-of-phase sequence was used to assess the impact of T2* decay on this method of estimating fat fraction. A standard two-echo long TR sequence also was obtained in all patients. Histologic preparations from the biopsy specimens were examined by a pathologist who had no knowledge of the MR results and were graded according to overall visual assessment as belonging to one of four categories of fat fraction. Results of the MR-calculated apparent fat fraction were compared directly with biopsy category and were also placed in MR fat fraction categories, allowing estimation of the statistical correlation between the biopsy and MR grading systems. Eight of eight patients with biopsy categories indicating a fat fraction of less than 0.25 were computed by MR to have a fat fraction of less than 0.1. Seven of eight patients with biopsy categories indicating a fat fraction of greater than 0.25 were computed by MR to have a fat fraction of at least 0.24. The MR-calculated apparent fat fraction category correlated significantly with the histologic biopsy category (r = .86, p less than .01). When compared with the in-phase image, decreased signal from liver was visually apparent on the 180 degree out-of-phase images in all cases in which the fat fraction was at least 0.24, but there was no indication of fatty liver on the standard T1- or T2-weighted images. Calculated T2 also showed no correlation with degree of fatty deposition. Correction for T2* decay by using the 360 degree out-of-phase acquisition in addition to the standard 0 degree and 180 degree out-of-phase images had little effect on fat fraction computation. Phase-contrast MR is a promising noninvasive method for quantitative assessment of fatty deposition in the liver.\r"

We observed this phenomenon in 10 (8%) of 130 consecutive, contrast-enhanced, nondynamic CT examinations of the abdomen. Thus, the occurrence is more common and less specific than previously reported. Seven of the 10 patients in our series were receiving chemotherapy for malignant disease, and three had abdominal pain with no definitive diagnosis. In four of the 10 patients, corresponding areas of periportal low attenuation or radiolucency were observed on initial dynamically enhanced scans. Periportal enhancement may be related to late diffusion of contrast material into periportal areas that were initially radiolucent. Such diffusion may occur because of endothelial insult. Periportal contrast enhancement appears to be a nonspecific finding on nondynamic contrast-enhanced CT scans of the abdomen. Periportal enhancement is important to recognize because it can mimic the appearance of portal vein thrombosis and may also be used to differentiate intrahepatic biliary dilatation from periportal radiolucency.\r"

Fifteen lesions were imaged at 0.6 T with T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo (SE) pulse sequences; 20 lesions were imaged at 1.5 T with T1-weighted SE and gradient-echo pulse sequences and T2-weighted SE pulse sequences. Diagnosis of focal nodular hyperplasia was made pathologically in 25 patients, with nuclear scintigraphy in four, and with follow-up imaging in six. Only seven lesions (20%) were isointense relative to normal liver on both T1- and T2-weighted images. On T1-weighted SE images, 21 lesions (60%) were isointense relative to normal liver, 12 (34%) were hypointense, and two (6%) were hyperintense. On T2-weighted SE images, 12 lesions (34%) were isointense and 23 (66%) were hyperintense relative to normal liver. A central scar was present in 17 lesions (49%) and was hypointense relative to the lesion on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. Twenty lesions (57%) were of homogeneous signal intensity throughout the lesion, except for the presence of a central scar. All three MR imaging characteristics were present in three cases (9%). We conclude that hepatic focal nodular hyperplasia has a wide range of signal intensity on MR imaging.\r"

The small transhepatic track required makes insertion easier, less painful, and probably safer when compared with plastic stents, and the large internal lumen reduces the rate of occlusion by encrusted bile. Wallstent endoprostheses were inserted under local anesthesia in 41 consecutive patients with malignant obstructive jaundice. Biliary drainage was considered the treatment of choice in all of these patients. The diagnosis was based on biopsy results in 32 patients and on radiologic appearances in nine. The patients were followed up in outpatient clinics for 16 months and had repeated radiologic examinations only if they had symptoms suggesting stent occlusion. No cases of hemobilia due to damaged hepatic vessels occurred. Two patients had septicemia treated with antibiotics. Three patients had recurrent jaundice due to growth of tumor below or above the stents. Endoprosthesis migration was not seen. No cases of stent occlusion due to encrustation of bile occurred. The median survival of patients was 105 days (range, 10-545 days). Our experience shows that Wallstent endoprostheses can be inserted with little discomfort for the patient and with relatively few complications. They provide good palliation in patients with malignant obstructive jaundice.\r"

This is a critical differentiation because the latter represents meniscal tears that can be found and treated at arthroscopy, whereas the former represents degeneration, tears, or perhaps normal variants that cannot be detected or treated arthroscopically. We make an equivocal diagnosis of a tear when it is difficult to decide if signal in a meniscus involves the meniscal surface. We studied MR scans of the knee in 142 consecutive patients for the presence of such equivocal tears. Their prevalence was 14% (20/142); 17 were in the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus and three were in the posterior horn of the medial meniscus. In 13 cases with arthroscopy/arthrotomy correlation, no tears were found. In one of the 20 patients in whom the meniscus was removed during arthroplasty, histologic examination of the meniscus showed separation of collagen bundles, which was caused by meniscal degeneration confined to the substance of the meniscus. These results suggest that a meniscal tear is unlikely when MR scans show a focus of high signal in a meniscus that does not unequivocally extend to involve the surface of the meniscus.\r"

In the first part of the study, iohexol in concentrations of 180 and 300 mg l/ml was compared in double-blind manner with barium. Sixty-four patients were studied. No significant difference in changes of blood pressure and pulse rate was found between the three groups of patients studied. Diarrhea was significantly more common in the children receiving iohexol than in children receiving barium. The diarrhea was not due to previously identified high-risk factors in the children, nor was it due to concurrent medication. When image quality was assessed in each anatomic region of the gastrointestinal tract, fewer nondiagnostic ratings occurred with barium than with iohexol. With barium, fewer ratings of poor mucosal coating and slightly fewer ratings of suboptimal contrast density occurred. The second part of the study was an open evaluation of iohexol 180 mg l/ml in 18 patients in whom barium was clinically contraindicated. Three of 53 assessments were nondiagnostic. Mucosal coating was poor in 6%, and contrast density was suboptimal in 8% of patients. The results of this study indicate that barium is the preferred contrast agent for routine evaluation of the gastrointestinal tract in children. Good-quality images can be obtained, however, with iohexol in concentrations of 180 or 300 mg l/ml, and iohexol is an excellent contrast agent for evaluation of the gastrointestinal tract in those patients in whom barium is relatively or absolutely contraindicated.\r"

A retrospective review of unenhanced CT scans of the chest was undertaken to determine the frequency of the described finding. Seven (13%) of 53 patients had a well-demarcated focus of calcification in the region of the ligamentum arteriosum. None of these patients had evidence of a patent ductus arteriosum. Calcification within the ligamentum arteriosum was seen in 13% of routine CT examinations of the chest in children and should not be confused with a pathologic process producing mediastinal calcifications.\r"

In all cases, third-trimester sonograms showed marked unilateral lateral ventriculomegaly (mean atrial width, 4.4 cm) and normal contralateral lateral, third, and fourth ventricles. Five of the six cases had marked thinning of the cortical mantle on the affected side and shift of midline structures to the contralateral side. The causes of unilateral hydrocephalus were agenesis or stenosis of the foramen of Monro in three cases, transient obstruction of the foramen in one fetus with an intraventricular hematoma, underlying brain dysplasia in one fetus with a variant of holoprosencephaly, and undetermined in one case. All six neonates had placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt catheter; four of these have had normal cognitive development at follow-up. The remaining two infants have moderate to severe developmental impairment. Unilateral hydrocephalus is a rare anomaly that can be recognized by prenatal sonography. Even though unilateral ventriculomegaly may be marked, early diagnosis and treatment may result in a favorable clinical outcome.\r"

  ".W": "The interpretation of conventional spin-echo and gradient-echo MR images of intracranial vascular lesions can be complex and ambiguous owing to variable effects on image intensity caused by flowing blood or thrombus. MR phase images, obtained simultaneously with conventional-magnitude images, are useful for evaluating proton motion (i.e., blood flow), and therefore can simplify the diagnosis of the presence or absence of thrombosis within a vascular structure or lesion. Fourteen patients with a variety of intracranial vascular abnormalities (aneurysms, superior sagittal sinus thrombosis, neoplasms adjacent to venous sinuses, and vascular malformations) were evaluated with conventional MR and phase imaging for the presence of blood flow. The phase images correlated with angiography in all cases. Phase imaging was not necessarily better than conventional spin-echo imaging in all cases, but it simplified the evaluation of thrombus vs blood flow in many. In three of five aneurysms, the phase images were diagnostic for evaluating lumen patency whereas the conventional images were ambiguous. Phase imaging was advantageous for detecting tumor invasion of the venous sinus when venous blood was enhanced by gadopentetate dimeglumine. A laminar flow phantom experiment determined the lower limits of sensitivity of phase imaging to be 0.5 cm/sec in the slice-select and 2.5 cm/sec in the read gradient directions. Phase imaging is a simple, reliable technique that can distinguish thrombosis from flowing blood within intracranial lesions. It is easily performed and adds no additional time to the MR examination.\r"

On the basis of responses to a questionnaire, each patient was categorized as symptomatic (n = 60) or asymptomatic (n = 68) for paranasal sinus disease. Patients were categorized further on the basis of the maximal mucosal thickening seen by MR in any paranasal sinus. A modified t test was used to compare the prevalence of various degrees of mucosal thickening between symptomatic and asymptomatic groups. Statistically significant differences between the groups were seen only in those patients with normal sinuses and in those with 4 mm or more of mucosal thickening. We conclude that mucosal thickening of up to 3 mm is common and lacks clinical significance in asymptomatic patients. An ancillary finding is that 1- to 2-mm areas of mucosal thickening in the ethmoidal sinuses occur in 63% of asymptomatic patients. This minimal mucosal thickening in the ethmoidal sinuses is thought to be a normal variant, possibly a function of the physiologic nasal cycle.\r"

In the past 10-15 years, a variety of new diagnostic procedures (e.g., fiber-optic endoscopy, scintigraphy, and double-contrast barium studies) have become available to examine these patients. Despite these new procedures, a small number of patients continue to bleed without a defined cause. We sought to evaluate the role of visceral angiography in patients with chronic gastrointestinal bleeding in whom findings on an extensive noninvasive workup have been normal. Between 1983 and 1990, we obtained angiograms on 36 such patients. The cause of bleeding was established by angiography in 16 patients (44%). In 11 of these 16, angiography revealed only a structural abnormality without active bleeding. Twenty patients had normal angiographic findings. No angiograms were false-positive, but three were false-negative (8%). No complication occurred as a result of the angiographic procedures. Our experience shows that visceral angiography can provide a positive diagnosis in a significant number of patients with chronic gastrointestinal bleeding of obscure origin in whom all other diagnostic measures have been unrevealing. Despite improvements in noninvasive diagnostic techniques, angiography still remains an important tool for examining this group of patients.\r"

All patients had had poor results of balloon angioplasty including residual stenosis, iliac occlusion, and dissection. The stent used in all cases was a self-expandable stainless steel endoprosthesis mounted on a 7- or 9-French catheter and covered by an invaginated tubular rolling membrane. The diameter of the expanded stent varied from 7 to 12 mm. A total of 129 stents was placed. Technical success was 97%. Thromboses occurred immediately after placement in two patients and within the first month in six; these were mainly due to residual obstruction. Eighty-two (93%) of 88 patients with a follow-up longer than 3 months had no recurrent symptoms. Restenosis caused by intimal hyperplasia inside the stent occurred in 10 patients; these required repeated intervention in only four cases. In the remaining six patients, no further complications occurred. Our results show that self-expanding endoprostheses are of value for improving the results of inadequate percutaneous transluminal angioplasty.\r"

Before PTMC, ANP levels increased from 107 +/- 70 to 183 +/- 96 pg/ml during exercise testing (p less than 0.01), concomitant with the increment in mean transmitral pressure gradient, heart rate and systolic blood pressure. After PTMC, ANP levels also increased from 78 +/- 43 to 117 +/- 64 pg/ml, concomitant with the increment of those parameters. However, increments of ANP, mean transmitral pressure gradient and heart rate after PTMC were lower than those before PTMC. Because the most important factor influencing the secretion of ANP was unclear, the differences between these parameters were calculated at submaximal exercise before and after PTMC. There was a significant relation only between the change in ANP and mean transmitral pressure gradient (r = 0.70, p less than 0.01). These results suggest that the most important factor influencing the secretion of ANP during exercise is the change in transmitral pressure gradient in patients with mitral stenosis.\r"

The patients with lactase deficiency were dietary treated and had a very low daily calcium intake. Serum osteocalcin levels were significantly higher in the patients with lactase deficiency than in the control subjects. In contrast, serum levels of parathyroid hormone, alkaline phosphatase, calcium, and phosphorus were not statistically different in the two groups. Our data suggest an increased rate of bone turnover in patients with lactase deficiency on a low calcium diet; possibly calcium supplementation is indicated in dietary-treated patients with lactase deficiency.\r"

All measurements were made at three time points: at baseline, at 10 minutes (after the bolus but before radiocontrast administration), and at 60 minutes (after completion of the study). Baseline plasma ANP (PANP) measurements (mean +/- SE) were similar in both groups (saline, 73 +/- 38 pg/mL; mannitol, 62 +/- 11 pg/mL). PANP increased significantly over time for the set of all patients (analysis of variance [ANOVA], P less than 0.05); however, at 10 minutes PANP increased significantly only in the group receiving mannitol (saline, 76 +/- 43 pg/mL; mannitol, 100 +/- 29 pg/mL) (P less than 0.04). Serum osmolality (SOSM), over time for the set of all patients (ANOVA, P less than 0.04). At 10 minutes there were significant increases only in the group receiving mannitol, and after radiocontrast, there were significant increases in both groups for all parameters. Regression analysis demonstrated a significant correlation between the change in PANP and the change in SOSM (P less than 0.04, r = 0.33). In conclusion, intravascular infusion of mannitol or radiocontrast increased PANP levels. The mechanism may be multifactorial, with a potential role for an increase in SOSM and/or PADH.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To compare the determination of plasma renin activity (PRA) and the direct measurement of active renin by immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) as methods of assessing the renin system in patients with congestive heart failure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The status of the renin-angiotensin system in congestive heart failure was assessed by measuring the plasma renin substrate concentration, PRA, and plasma concentration of active renin in 37 patients with mild to severe congestive heart failure. Natremia and plasma levels of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) were determined as biologic indexes of the severity of heart failure, and concentrations of prealbumin and retinol-binding protein were used as indexes of liver dysfunction. RESULTS: The PRA and the concentrations of active renin and ANF were markedly higher in patients with New York Heart Association class IV heart failure than in patients with class II to III heart failure, while natremia and the concentrations of renin substrate, prealbumin, and retinol-binding protein were markedly lower in the class IV patients than in the class II to III patients. Plasma renin substrate concentration was negatively correlated with active renin concentration (n = 37, r = -0.45, p = 0.005), and positively related to natremia (r = 0.56, p less than 0.0005), prealbumin (r = 0.54, p less than 0.001), and retinol-binding protein (r = 0.60, p less than 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Low levels of plasma renin substrate can be considered as an indirect index of the severity of heart failure that reflects both the high level of circulating active renin and the decrease in hepatic protein output. In patients with class IV heart failure, low levels of renin substrate led to a marked underestimation of active renin concentration from measurements of PRA. In contrast, direct IRMA of active renin measures the true plasma active renin concentration, independent of plasma renin substrate, and closely reflects renin secretion.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The effect of lupus anticoagulant-containing sera on endothelial prostacyclin generation (both basal and after thrombin stimulation) was determined. Subsets of patients who had experienced arterial, venous, or no thrombosis were compared with respect to the quantitation of antiphospholipid antibody and effects on prostacyclin production. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum antiphospholipid antibodies were detected in 26 patients by immunologic (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and kinetic (anticoagulant) assays. Cultured human endothelial cells were exposed to patient or normal serum, and the release of prostacyclin was determined by radioimmunoassay of supernatants. Release was determined in the absence and presence of the secretagogue, thrombin (1 U/mL), corrected for interassay variation, and correlated with other clinical and laboratory variables. RESULTS: The normal prostacyclin response was a 2.5-fold increase after thrombin (1 U/mL) compared to basal production. Patients with a history of arterial thrombosis (Group 1, n = 10) had the highest IgG anticardiolipin antibody titers (449 +/- 115 [OD x 1,000]), most prolonged kaolin clotting times (140 +/- 15 seconds), and the least prostacyclin response to thrombin (1.36-fold). Patients with venous thrombosis (Group 2, n = 6) had lower titers (329 +/- 120), intermediate clotting times (125 +/- 19 seconds), and slightly impaired prostacyclin responses (2.18-fold). Patients with no history of thrombosis (Group 3, n = 10) had low antibody titers (220 +/- 20), mildly prolonged clotting times (108 +/- 6 seconds), and normal prostacyclin responses (2.33-fold). Patient serum did not alter basal or arachidonate-induced prostacyclin production. Group 1 had significantly lower platelet counts (99 +/- 19) compared to Group 2 (167 +/- 35) or Group 3 (167 +/- 34), but were similar in age and associated diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of prostacyclin responses is commonly found in serum from patients with lupus anticoagulants, and is likely to be present in patients with high IgG anticardiolipin antibodies, strong lupus anticoagulants, low platelet counts, and a recent arterial thrombosis.\r"

Using a single serum sample, distinctive patterns of IgG antibody response to both antigens were identified allowing the differentiation between T. cruzi infection, Leishmania infection, and probable double infection. Sera from patients with T. cruzi infections consistently recognized bands of approximately 25 kDa, 38 kDa, and greater than 97 kDa in T. cruzi antigen lysates and recognized a band of 38 kDa of 66 kDa in Leishmania antigen lysates but did not consistently recognize any bands using T. cruzi antigen. Sera from patients with probable double infections recognized all bands normally detected by individual sera from patients infected with either T. cruzi or Leishmania. In our study population, T. cruzi infection among leishmaniasis patients was as frequent as among individuals free of leishmaniasis.\r"

The effect of this exposure on this colon cancer cell line, with and without coincubation with the biologic response modifier gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma), was studied. Using the tumor target cell survival (TTCS) assay, concentrations of halothane from 0.5 to 2% markedly augmented the antitumor activities of IFN-gamma against HT-29. The tumor cell cytostatic effects of IFN-gamma in the 0.75-6-unit/ml range were increased nearly 400% by concentrations of halothane as low as 1%. These results were confirmed in a separate cytolytic assay (Indium-111 release assay), which revealed that halothane concentrations in the 2-4% range markedly increased the cytolytic capacity of IFN-gamma at doses of IFN-gamma between 75 and 1,250 units/ml. The cytolytic activity of IFN-gamma was increased nearly 300% by doses of halothane as low as 1%. A nearly identical pattern of augmentation of IFN-gamma-induced antitumor activity was observed when the known calmodulin inhibitor trifluoperazine (TFP) was coincubated with IFN-gamma. At concentrations of 4-10 microM, the antitumor activity of IFN-gamma was increased nearly 400%. These observations suggest that the pattern of halothane potentiation of the antitumor activity of IFN-gamma is similar to that exhibited by known calmodulin inhibitors.\r"

Subjects received clonidine (0.3-0.4 mg orally), morphine (0.21 mg/kg intramuscularly), or the same doses of the two drugs combined, at three separate sessions in a randomized fashion. The study was balanced for all possible sequences of drug administration. Blood pressure, heart rate, hemoglobin oxygen saturation via finger pulse oximetry, and ventilatory and occlusion pressure responses to CO2 were obtained before and 20, 40, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, and 360 min after administration of drug or drug combination. Systolic blood pressure decreased significantly only in the clonidine and clonidine plus morphine groups (P less than 0.05). Hemoglobin oxygen saturation decreased by a statistically significant (P less than 0.05), though clinically minor, degree only in the morphine or morphine plus clonidine groups. Clonidine alone did not depress the slope of either the ventilatory or the occlusion pressure response to CO2. In addition, clonidine did not significantly worsen morphine-induced depression of the slope of the ventilatory and occlusion pressure responses in the drug combination group. Both the ventilatory and occlusion pressure responses to CO2 were shifted to the right in all three drug groups (P less than 0.05) but were shifted to a significantly lesser degree by clonidine alone than by morphine and morphine plus clonidine. In healthy young adult males, clonidine alone produces little respiratory depression and does not significantly potentiate morphine-induced respiratory depression.\r"

  ".W": "The measurement of the ventilatory response to inhaled CO2 is unphysiologic because the CO2 that normally stimulates breathing is endogenous (tissue or venous CO2). We took advantage of the spontaneous changes in alveolar PCO2 and ventilation occurring in preterm infants during periodic breathing to calculate the ventilatory response to endogenous CO2. This response was obtained in 20 infants and compared with those obtained using the more conventional methods of steady-state inhalation of CO2 (12 infants) and rebreathing of CO2 (11 infants); it was also compared with a transient change in alveolar CO2 obtained by inhalation of 7% CO2 in air for 10 s (CO2 \"bolus\"; 11 infants). All groups of infants had similar birth weight and gestational ages. To calculate the response to endogenous CO2, delta PACO2 was measured as the difference between lowest and highest PaCO2 and delta VE was the difference between the corresponding instantaneous ventilation. To adjust for circulation time, values for PACO2 were made lowest for the last breath before apnea and highest for the first breath after apnea. The coefficient of variation of the method was 8%. The slope of the ventilatory response to endogenous CO2 was 0.067 +/- 0.009 (mean +/- SE) L.min-1.kg-1.mm Hg PACO2(-1), a value greater than that using steady-state and rebreathing methods (0.038 +/- 0.004 and 0.040 +/- 0.006 L.min-1.kg-1.mm Hg PACO2(-1), respectively), but similar to that of infants inhaling a CO2 \"bolus\" (0.051 +/- 0.009 L.min-1.kg-1.mm Hg PACO2(-1)).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We have performed an in vitro study using electrical field stimulation (EFS; 40 V, 0.5 ms, 8 Hz for 20 s) in guinea pig bronchi to investigate the effect of nedocromil sodium (NS) on NANC bronchoconstrictor responses. NS inhibited NANC bronchoconstriction in bronchi in a concentration-dependent manner, with a maximum inhibition of 40 +/- 4% (p less than 0.001, n = 6) at 100 microM. Cromolyn sodium, however, produced only 9 +/- 8% inhibition at the same molar concentration (p less than 0.05). NS did not affect the contractile response to substance P, nor did it modulate the cholinergic bronchoconstrictor response to EFS in tracheal smooth muscle.

  ".W": "Alveolar macrophages are believed to be central in orchestrating the fibrotic response in interstitial lung disease (ILD). To test the hypothesis that macrophages from patients with ILD were dedicated to growth factor production and that this was independent of other indices of macrophage activation, we measured the mRNA of the B chain of PDGF and TGF-beta, as well as HLA-DR-alpha in alveolar macrophages from patients with ILD and from normal control subjects. When alveolar macrophages were examined immediately after lavage, cells from patients with ILD had increased PDGF(B) but similar TGF-beta and HLA-DR-alpha mRNA when compared with control subjects. Discoordinate regulation of these genes was observed when alveolar macrophage PDGF(B) mRNA increased while TGF-beta and HLA-DR-alpha mRNA decreased after culture for 24 h. This response was not disease-related as these changes were similar in cells from patients with ILD and from control subjects. Because a lymphocytic alveolitis is present in many cases of ILD, we asked whether interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) modulated the activation of these genes. In both the patients and the control subjects, PDGF(B) and HLA-DR-alpha, but not TGF-beta, mRNA were increased after incubation with IFN-gamma. These results indicate that PDGF(B) mRNA may be increased in alveolar macrophages in ILD and that PDGF(B), TGF-beta, and HLA-DR-alpha are independently regulated genes in alveolar macrophages, but that IFN-gamma increases both PDGF(B) and HLA-DR-alpha mRNA. We speculate that IFN-gamma induced PDGF(B) gene activation may be an important mechanism by which lymphocytes promote pulmonary fibrosis.\r"

To test this concept we have calculated the AaPO2 from arterial blood gas measurements, breathing air, in 23 patients with hypercapnia, hypoxemia, and advanced obstructive lung disease (mean FEV1 = 0.88 L). We found that AaPO2 varied inversely with PaCO2 (r = -0.83, p less than 0.001). In five of these patients with the most severely elevated PaCO2 (range, 59 to 81 mm Hg) the AaPO2 was within normal limits. We also calculated the difference between the O2 contents of \"ideal\" pulmonary capillary blood and arterial blood and expressed this as the venous admixture (QVA/QT) based on an assumed arteriovenous content difference of 4.5 ml/dl. In contrast to the AaPO2, the QVA/QT, was abnormal in all patients (mean = 41 +/- 8%). We conclude that the AaPO2 may be an unreliable indicator of abnormal gas exchange in the presence of alveolar hypoventilation. This finding can be explained by substantial changes in the position of the alveolar and arterial points on the oxygen dissociation curve for hemoglobin in the presence of alveolar hypoxia secondary to hypoventilation.\r"

Twenty-five patients and 28 age-matched control subjects were studied. All the patients had parenchymal shadows (Stage II or Stage III) and none had clinical evidence of extrathoracic disease. Before therapy, serum IFNg levels were significantly higher in the patient group (p less than 0.001), and 20 (80%) had values above the normal range. After oral treatment with corticosteroids for a median 13 months (range, 3 to 49 months) the levels decreased significantly (p less than 0.01). However, the falls were less pronounced in patients who had a better outcome in terms of achieving complete radiographic resolution and in those who improved in forced vital capacity by greater than or equal to 10%. The prognostic value of the pretreatment serum IFNg was explored, and a significant relationship was found between higher pretreatment levels and lower grades or radiographic abnormality assessed 3 yr after commencement of treatment (p less than 0.01). In addition, the patients who had cleared completely while receiving steroids and remained in remission had significantly higher pretreatment serum IFNg levels than did those with incomplete resolution of parenchymal shadows or radiographic relapses (p less than 0.05). We conclude that elevated levels of circulating IFNg are detectable in most untreated patients with Stage II/III pulmonary sarcoidosis and that patients with the highest levels appear to have a better chance of achieving complete resolution with corticosteroid therapy.\r"

  ".W": "We conducted a case-control study to determine the relative and attributable risk of HIV seropositivity for bacillary-positive (smear and/or culture) pulmonary tuberculosis in Haiti. There were 274 patients with tuberculosis and an equal number of control subjects. Antibodies to HIV were present in 67 (24%) patients and eight (3%) control subjects. Odds ratios suggested that the risk of pulmonary tuberculosis was 15.7 times as great (95% confidence interval, 4.8 to 5.0; p less than 0.05) in patients 20 to 39 yr of age who were HIV-seropositive than in HIV-seronegative patients. In contrast, the relative risk in those 40 to 59 yr of age was elevated (3.0 times), though not significantly (lower 95% confidence interval, 0.8). In the 20- to 39-yr age group, 31% of tuberculosis was attributable to HIV infection (95% confidence interval between 23 and 39%). HIV-seropositive and HIV-seronegative patients did not differ with respect to sputum smear positivity. HIV-seronegative patients were twice as likely to be infected with resistant organisms, though this was not significant. We conclude that HIV infection is a major risk factor for pulmonary tuberculosis in young adult residents of Haiti. This, together with the fact that similar proportions of HIV-seropositive and HIV-seronegative patients were potentially infectious, suggests that without vigorous counteraction tuberculosis will become a greater problem for Haiti.\r"

Five of these patients were not yet receiving additional levodopa despite some worsening of motor scores. Of the 33 patients now taking combined therapy, seven have been followed up for 6 months or less. Twenty-four (92%) of the 26 patients taking combined therapy for a mean of 26 months (8.5 to 99 months) who have had Parkinson's disease for 6 years showed a dramatic improvement in their parkinsonism shortly after the addition of levodopa, with significant decreases in their rated motor scores, such improvement being maintained at their latest neurologic evaluation. Eighteen (75%) of these 24 patients responded to the combined selegiline/levodopa therapy with degrees of improvement equal to or greater than 50%, compared with their motor status at the start of combined therapy just before the addition of levodopa. This degree of \"reversal\" of parkinsonism on addition of levodopa (mean carbidopa/levodopa dose, 98/389 mg) was not observed in any of these same patients receiving selegiline alone for an average of 13.8 months. Four patients taking combined therapy developed mild, transient, abnormal involuntary movements, and end-of-dose pattern of response after more than 2 years of combined therapy (24.75 and 33.5 months, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We sought to determine whether there are indirect costs of teaching in Canadian hospitals. To examine cost differences between teaching and nonteaching hospitals we estimated two cost functions: cost per case and cost per patient-day (dependent variables). The independent variables were number of beds, occupancy rate, teaching ratio (number of residents and interns per 100 beds), province, urbanicity (the population density of the county in which the hospital was situated) and wage index. Within each hospital we categorized a random sample of patient discharges according to case mix and severity of illness using age and standard diagnosis and procedure codes. Teaching ratio and case severity were each highly correlated positively with the dependent variables. The other variables that led to higher costs in teaching hospitals were wage rates and number of beds. Our regression model could serve as the basis of a reimbursement system, adjusted for severity and teaching status, particularly in provinces moving toward introducing case-weighting mechanisms into their payment model. Even if teaching hospitals were paid more than nonteaching hospitals because of the difference in the severity of illness there should be an additional allowance to cover the indirect costs of teaching.\r"

Plasma ANP levels (pg per ml) were significantly elevated in group 2 (46.0 +/- 19.0 SD) when compared with either normal controls (23.8 +/- 14.2), group 1 (28.9 +/- 15.6) or group 3 (26.0 +/- 12.9). This increase in plasma ANP levels was not related to hypertension. Furthermore, plasma ANP levels correlated positively with log(ACR) among the patients with ACR under 100 (groups 1 and 2 combined, r = 0.4701, p less than 0.01). These results suggest that an elevated plasma ANP level in the early phase of microalbuminuria possibly plays a pathophysiological role in the development of nephropathy in NIDDM patients.\r"

Sequential measurements after transplantation and during CsA treatment revealed a transient significant increase of median values with highest amounts of vWF:Ag of 362% (2 p less than 0.0001), FVIII:Ag of 398% (2 p less than 0.001) and FVIII:C of 360% (2 p less than 0.0001) (Friedman test). vWF:RCof did not show statistically significant changes. After 4 months, levels of vWF and FVIII comparable to those obtained before transplantation were observed. In univariate statistical analysis no correlation was found between vWF of FVIII on the one hand and plasma creatinine levels, CsA dose or CsA whole blood through levels on the other hand. However, multivariate statistics revealed to some extent a positive influence of CsA blood levels on vWF:Ag levels. Patients with vascular rejection or chronic CsA nephrotoxicity showed significantly lower levels of vWF:Ag as compared with patients without endothelial cell damage in the kidney (2 p less than 0.05). However, the difference in vWF:Ag levels already existed before transplantation. In contrast to recent reports, plasma vWF levels were not indicative of vascular injury in kidney graft recipients nor was the marked elevation of vWF and FVIII associated with thromboembolic complications ascribed to CsA treatment.\r"

Of 109 survivors, five scored greater than or equal to 8 (two were postictal at the time of scoring). A GMSPS of greater than or equal to 10 at or after admission predicted death with sensitivity 100%, specificity 98%, and positive predictive value of 88%; for GMSPS of both greater than or equal to 8 or 9, the values were 100%, 95%, and 74%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The GMSPS is a rapid clinical score that performs well in identifying children with poor prognosis who might benefit from early intensive care. It should be studied prospectively and compared with other scoring systems.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective randomized controlled study. SETTING: Laboratory of a large university-affiliated medical school. SUBJECTS: Sixty-seven male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 350 to 450 g. INTERVENTIONS: Jugular and gastroduodenal feeding catheters were inserted in animals 1 day before hemorrhage, and animals were started on one of six different fluid or nutritional regimens: TPN, iv saline, an enteral amino acid-based formula (AA) (Vivonex-TEN), an enteral peptide-based formula (PEP) (Reabilan-HN), an enteral intact-protein based formula (PRO) (Osmolite-HN), or enteral saline. A catheter was inserted in the tail artery and animals were hemorrhaged 5 mL/kg at baseline and 1 hr later. Animals were returned to their cages and observed for survival. Liver function was determined by measuring circulating bile acid levels at baseline and 24 hr after hemorrhage. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Mortality was significantly increased in animals receiving TPN (63%) and AA (24%). Mortality was 13% in animals receiving PRO and 0% in animals receiving PEP and saline. Liver function deteriorated in all animals after hemorrhage except the PEP group. CONCLUSIONS: TPN and AA increased mortality in animals after hemorrhage. PEP was associated with zero mortality and protection of liver function after hemorrhage.\r"

  ".W": "Cycloheximide (CHX) has been shown to mimic the action of inhibin on gonadotropin secretion by pituitary cell cultures. We showed previously that suppression of FSH secretion by inhibin is associated with a rapid and profound suppression of FSH beta mRNA levels. The present study was designed to examine the mechanism of action of CHX and to determine whether inhibin's actions involve new proteins synthesis. Pituitary cell cultures were treated with control medium or medium containing inhibin, CHX, or inhibin plus CHX for 2 or 6 h. At 6 h, secretion of FSH was decreased by inhibin (72% of control), CHX (58% of control), and the combined inhibitors (56% of control). LH secretion was not significantly changed, while that of free alpha-subunit was reduced only by CHX (68% of control). Levels of FSH beta, LH beta, and alpha-subunit mRNAs were measured by Northern analysis. At 2 h inhibin decreased FSH beta mRNA to 49% of the control value. CHX alone had no effect, while CHX plus inhibin produced intermediate levels (77% of control). By 6 h, however, inhibin and CHX each decreased FSH beta mRNA to very low levels (12% and 15% of control, respectively), and in cultures treated with both inhibin and CHX, this RNA was barely detectable. To determine the reversibility of the effects of these inhibitors, cells were incubated with fresh control medium after 6 h. Secretion of FSH and free alpha-subunit remained suppressed 4 h later; recovery was complete by 16 h in inhibin treated cultures. FSH beta mRNA returned to control levels by 4 h in inhibin-treated and by 16 h in CHX-treated cultures. Levels of LH beta and alpha-subunit mRNA were comparable to control values at all times. In conclusion, 1) CHX, like inhibin, suppresses FSH beta mRNA levels, although its actions are less rapid and less rapidly reversible; 2) inhibin requires ongoing protein synthesis for full expression of its inhibitory effects; 3) the synthesis and secretion of LH are much less sensitive to inhibition by either inhibin or CHX than are the synthesis and secretion of FSH; and 4) secretion of free alpha-subunit involves a labile protein(s).\r"

  ".U": "91099140\r", 
  ".W": "Elucidation of mechanisms regulating intracellular calcium levels in steroidogenic tissues is important for understanding control of cellular function. We have previously described FSH receptor-mediated flux of 45Ca++ into cultured rat Sertoli cells and receptor-enriched proteoliposomes via voltage-sensitive and voltage-independent calcium channels. In the present study, we report heretofore unrecognized inhibitory effects of FSH on Na+/Ca++ exchange in these two systems. An outwardly directed Na+ gradient, developed by preincubating Sertoli cell monolayers in buffer made hypertonic with NaCl, resulted in uptake of 45Ca++ that was unaffected by calcium channel blocking agents, ruthenium red or methoxyverapamil, but was enhanced by ouabain, a specific inhibitor of Na+/K(+)-ATPase. Sodium-dependent 45Ca++ flux into Sertoli cells was inhibited in a concentration-related manner by increased extracellular Na+ (up to 135 mM). FSH consistently and reproducibly (28.9 +/- 3.8%, 10 separate assays) reduced sodium-dependent 45Ca++ influx in the absence or presence of ouabain. A lesser effect on Na+/Ca++ exchange was seen when Li+ replaced Na+ in the preincubation buffer, and a marked reduction occurred when Sertoli cells were incubated in buffer containing KCl, presumably due to membrane depolarization. FSH-sensitive Na+/45Ca++ exchange was also observed when using FSH receptor-enriched proteoliposomes. Our earlier calcium channel studies indicated that FSH affects Ca++ entry into Sertoli cells via a receptor-mediated process. The results reported here demonstrate that the interaction of FSH with its receptor is associated with changes in Na+/Ca++ exchange as well, and suggest that this activity may also be involved in regulating intracellular free Ca++ levels in the Sertoli cell.\r"

  ".W": "The present study examined the effects of FSH and insulin (IN) on 17 beta-estradiol (E2) secretion and granulosa cell proliferation. For these studies, immature rat ovaries were maintained in perifusion culture and continuously exposed to FSH (0-800 ng RP-1 eq/ml) and /or IN (0.2 U/ml). At specific times, the ovaries were removed from perifusion, and the perifusate was assayed for E2 by RIA. The ovaries were then incubated with [3H]thymidine ([3H]T) in order to estimate granulosa cel mitotic activity. FSH increased E2 secretion in a dose-dependent manner (P less than 0.05), but did not enhance [3H]T incorporation (P greater than 0.05) after 48 h of perifusion. Conversely, IN increased [3H]T incorporation (P less than 0.05) without stimulating E2 secretion (P greater than 0.05) after 48 h of perifusion. FSH alone or in combination with IN stimulated [3H]T incorporation at 24 h of perifusion compared to both zero hour control (P less than 0.05) and IN treatments (P less than 0.05). The inability of FSH to stimulate [3H]T incorporation after 48 h did not appear to be due to increased E2, since IN stimulated [3H]T incorporation in the presence of 100 ng E2/ml. Further, continuous exposure to FSH was required to maintain E2 secretion, demonstrating that after 24 h, FSH loses its capacity to stimulate granulosa cell [3H]T incorporation, but not E2 secretion. Finally, when ovaries are pretreated with FSH for 48 h and then exposed to FSH and/or IN, [3H]T incorporation was stimulated, and E2 secretion inhibited. These data suggest that 1) initially, FSH acts to stimulate mitosis then promotes granulosa cell E2 secretion; and 2) once granulosa cells begin to secrete E2 they are still capable of mitosis, but their mitotic activity is no longer directed by FSH.\r"

Sodium was retained in excess of intake during the first day after treatment with DOCA, and sodium balance returned to control values by the second day, whereas the excretion of potassium exceeded the intake during all days after DOCA treatment. These changes in electrolyte balance were associated with a significant increase in plasma levels of ANP. Administration of ANP-specific antiserum significantly impaired the return to normal sodium balance as well as the augmented kaliuresis that were observed on the second day after injection of DOCA. No significant effect was observed on either sodium or potassium balance after the injection of normal rabbit serum. These results suggest that plasma ANP plays an important role in mineralocorticoid escape.\r"

  ".W": "Angiotensin-II (Ang II) not only increases aldosterone secretion from bovine adrenal glomerulosa (AG) cells, but also primes these cells to respond to a subsequent challenge with the calcium channel agonist Bay K 8644. In cultured AG cells we investigated the hypothesis that this priming effect was the result of a persistent elevation in diacylglycerol (DAG) content. Ang II elicited an increase in DAG content, which was maintained for up to 75 min after the removal of Ang II, an effect which could underlie the ability of Ang II to prime the cells to respond to Bay K 8644. We then investigated the possibility that the DAG found in bovine AG cells consists of multiple species and the potential relationship of the species to the persistent elevation. We found that [3H]arachidonate and [14C]myristate were differentially incorporated into phospholipids, with approximately 80-85% of the latter radiolabel contained in phosphatidylcholine. Ang II elicited increases in the levels of both arachidonate- and myristate-containing DAG. The subsequent addition of an Ang II antagonist resulted in a rapid decrease in [3H]arachidonate-labeled DAG levels, but a much slower decline in myristate-containing DAG. These results suggest that the species of DAG generated in response to hormonal stimulation may be important in determining the speed with which this signal is terminated. Ang II also stimulated the release of water-soluble [3H]choline metabolites, in particular choline and phosphorylcholine, from prelabeled cells. These results indicate that 1) various DAG species exhibit different turnover rates; and 2) perhaps as a result of this disparity, the increase in DAG induced by an agonist may persist for a considerable period of time after the removal of the agonist or the inhibition of its action.\r"

  ".W": "In GH4C1 cells, TRH and the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), have been shown to activate Na+/H+ exchange, probably via stimulation of protein kinase C. In the present study, the dependence of changes in intracellular pH (pHi) on transients in the cytosolic free calcium concentration [( Ca2+]i) was investigated using BCECF and fura-2, respectively. In buffer containing 0.4 mM extracellular Ca2+, both TRH and ionomycin induced rapid cytosolic alkalinization in GH4C1 cells acid loaded with nigericin. The action of ionomycin on pHi was abolished by preincubating the cells with 100 microM amiloride or by replacing extracellular Na+ with choline+, indicating that the change in pHi was probably due to activation of Na+/H+ exchange. The actions of both TRH and ionomycin on pHi were blunted in Ca2(+)-free buffer. When acid-loaded cells were stimulated first with ionomycin, to deplete intracellular Ca2+ stores, and then incubated with TRH, the TRH-induced alkalinization was blunted; thus, an increase in [Ca2+]i is needed for full activation of Na+/H+ exchange. To study further the importance of agonist-induced changes in [Ca2+]i on the activation of Na+/H+ exchange, acid-loaded cells were incubated first with TPA, and then with either TRH or ionomycin. TPA induced a rise in pHi, which was further enhanced by TRH, but not ionomycin. The actions of both TRH and ionomycin on Na+/H+ exchange were attenuated, but not abolished, in cells pretreated with TPA for 36 h. Acidification of the cytosol with nigericin increased the resting [Ca2+]i level from 125 +/- 29 to 200 +/- 25 nM (P less than 0.01). The increase in [Ca2+]i was greatly attenuated when extracellular Ca2+ was chelated with EGTA before the addition of nigericin. Both the TRH- and ionomycin-induced increases in [Ca2+]i were blunted in acid-loaded cells. We conclude that in GH4C1 cells, a transient increase in [Ca2+]i can enhance Na+/H+ exchange and cause a rise in pHi, but that to obtain full activation of exchange, protein kinase C activity must also be stimulated. Furthermore, pHi is important in maintaining an adequate store of sequestered intracellular Ca2+ and in the release of Ca2+ from that store in response to TRH and ionomycin.\r"

  ".W": "The in vivo suppression of LH by 17 beta-estradiol (E2) has been documented frequently. However, the demonstration of a direct inhibitory action of E2, in contrast to a stimulatory action, on the secretion of LH from the anterior pituitary has been inconsistent. The aim of this study was to determine if E2 can suppress either basal (unstimulated) or GnRH-stimulated gonadotropin secretion directly at the level of the anterior pituitary gland. Anterior pituitaries were obtained from metestrous and proestrous females rats at 0900 h, and trunk blood was collected for serum measurements of LH, FSH, E2, and progesterone (P). Each anterior pituitary was cut into eighths and placed into a microchamber for perifusion. Pituitary fragments were perifused at a rate of 10 ml/h using medium 199 (without phenol red) that contained E2 (1 nM) or ethanol as a control. Six pulses of GnRH (peak amplitude, 50 ng/ml; duration, 2 min) were administered one per h starting at 60 min. Fractions of perfusate were collected every 5 min for measurement of LH and FSH. The total amounts of LH and FSH secreted during the 1-h interval after each GnRH pulse or corresponding basal hour were calculated. Both basal and LH and FSH responses to GnRH were significantly greater from pituitaries of proestrous compared to metestrous rats. The selective suppression of LH secretion by in vitro treatment with E2 was demonstrated using pituitaries from metestrous rats receiving GnRH pulses, but not using pituitaries from proestrous rats. Thus, a negative feedback effect of E2 on LH secretion was observed only in pituitaries from donors with low serum levels of E2 and high P, but not from donors with high serum levels of E2 and low P. We believe that the in vivo steroid environment determined the subsequent responses to in vitro treatment with E2 on GnRH-stimulated gonadotropin secretion from the isolated pituitary gland.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously shown that FSH receptors are physically and functionally associated with a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (Gs) in membranes of calf testis. Using N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), forskolin, and cholera toxin as probes, we have investigated the role of low and high affinity GTP-binding sites of stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding protein of adenylate cyclase (Gs) in the activation of adenylate cyclase. When calf testis membranes were exposed to NEM (1 mM), FSH binding to receptors was slightly (30%) decreased, but the receptors showed continued sensitivity to GTP, resulting in a further decrease in [125I]human FSH binding to receptors. Pretreatment of membranes with NEM (up to 20 microM) produced no effect on GTP-binding. A dose-dependent decrease in high affinity GTP-binding sites, however, was observed at higher (greater than 50 microM) NEM. Adenylate cyclase activity was reduced in response to GTP gamma S or NaF concomitant to a decrease in high affinity GTP-binding sites in membranes treated with 50-100 microM NEM, or completely abolished in membranes exposed to 300 microM NEM. Stimulation by forskolin indicated that the significant inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity occurring in membranes exposed to low NEM (50-100 microM) was not due to inactivation of catalytic unit of adenylate cyclase by NEM. Pretreatment of membranes with 100 micrograms/ml cholera toxin and NAD slightly (18%) reduced specific FSH binding but did not affect Gpp(NH)p-binding. However, adenylate cyclase stimulation by GTP plus FSH in these membranes was significantly enhanced. When membranes were treated with higher concentration of cholera toxin (250 micrograms/ml), the adenylate cyclase stimulation by GTP plus FSH was abolished due to uncoupling of FSH receptors from Gs and a significant decrease in high affinity GTP-binding sites. Our results suggest that high affinity GTP-binding sites of Gs coupled to FSH receptors are essential for FSH and guanine nucleotide activation of adenylate cyclase. The low affinity binding sites bind GTP and thereby regulate FSH binding but are not involved in the activation of adenylate cyclase.\r"

  ".U": "91099169\r", 
  ".W": "It has previously been shown that interleukin-1 (IL-1) directly stimulates the release of CRH-41 from rat hypothalamus in vitro, suggesting that cytokines may mediate the effects of changes in immune state on the hypothalamo-pituitary adrenal axis (HPA). However, it is likely that several cytokines can cause changes in neuroendocrine function, and we have now investigated a series of others for central activity on the HPA: IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor (cachectin), interferon-alpha 2, and interferon-gamma. The static rat hypothalamic incubation system used involves fresh hypothalamic explants with consecutive 20-min incubation, and estimation of CRH-41 concentrations in the medium by a specific RIA; the acute effects of cytokines on ACTH release from rat dispersed pituitary cells were also measured. IL-6 increased hypothalamic CRH-41 secretion in the range 10-100 U/ml, but had no effect on isolated median eminences incubated in vitro under the same conditions. IL-6 (1-1000 U/ml) also had no effect on the secretion of ACTH from freshly dispersed rat anterior pituitary cells when administered in 10-min pulses. The effects of both IL-1 and IL-6 were antagonized by blockade of the eicosanoid cyclooxygenase pathway, but not by lipooxygenase blockade. Neither IL-2 (1-10000 U/ml), IL-8 (0.1-10 nM), tumor necrosis factor (10-1000 U/ml), interferon-alpha 2 (10-1000 U/ml) nor interferon-gamma (10-1000 U/ml) had any effect on hypothalamic CRH-41 release or pituitary ACTH release. It is therefore concluded that IL-6, like IL-1, can exert a potent enhancing effect on the HPA by acutely stimulating the secretion of CRH-41 from the hypothalamus at a site above the level of the median eminence, at concentrations known to occur in human plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. These effects are probably mediated by cyclooxygenase products. Acute stimulatory effects of the other cytokines investigated on the HPA are unlikely to be exerted through changes in either CRH-41 or ACTH directly.\r"

  ".W": "This study has assessed whether depletion of specific germ cell types is able to alter the secretion of immunoactive inhibin by adult Sertoli cells in vivo and in vitro. Pachytene and later spermatocytes were depleted (80-100%) by a single administration of methoxy acetic acid (MAA; 650 mg/kg) to adult rats. At intervals between 1 and 42 days posttreatment, rats were killed, and the blood levels of FSH, LH, and testosterone were determined together with the levels of immunoactive inhibin in plasma and testicular interstitial fluid (IF). At the same time intervals, seminiferous tubules (ST; 5 x 2 cm) were isolated from control and MAA-treated rats and cultured for 24-72 h in the presence or absence of rat FSH, (Bu)2cAMP, or MAA under rigorously optimized conditions. The hormonal changes observed were related to the presence/absence of specific germ cell types, as determined by assessment of testicular morphology in perfusion-fixed testes from similarly treated rats. One to 3 days after MAA treatment, coincident with the depletion of pachytene spermatocytes, blood levels of FSH were increased significantly compared with controls; FSH returned to control levels at 7-14 days (when early spermatids were depleted), but were increased again at 21-35 days (when late spermatids were depleted). In contrast, while the plasma levels of immunoactive inhibin were increased 2-fold 3 days posttreatment, they were comparable to controls at 7-14 days, but were decreased substantially at 21-28 days. The levels of immunoactive inhibin in testicular IF were more than doubled 1 and 3 days posttreatment, but were comparable to control levels at all other times. Blood levels of LH showed a similar pattern of change to FSH, although only at 21-28 days after MAA treatment was there a significant increase, while blood levels of testosterone were comparable at all times in control and MAA-treated rats. To confirm that the changes observed in vivo after MAA treatment were indicative of changes in Sertoli rather than Leydig cell secretion of immonoactive inhibin, its secretion by isolated ST was assessed, and a pattern of change similar to that in plasma was observed. Thus, when cultured for 24 h under basal conditions, ST from rats 1-3 days after MAA treatment showed a 2- to 3-fold increase in secretion of immunoactive inhibin, which returned to control levels at 7-14 days before being reduced substantially at 21-28 days and then recovering to control levels; similar changes were observed for FSH- and (Bu)2cAMP-stimulated secretion of immunoactive inhibin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The number of FSH receptors increases during testicular development in several species of mammals. Hypophysectomy and hormonal replacement were performed to identify the factors that induce developmental changes in testicular FSH receptors. Male rats of the Wistar/Tw strain were hypophysectomized at 9, 16, 23, or 30 days or 3 months of age. These rats were killed 10 days after surgery along with intact control rats, and the testes were removed for receptor assay. A group of intact rats was killed on the day of surgery as initial controls. All of the hypophysectomized immature rats showed a higher density of FSH binding (FSH binding per unit weight) and a lower total FSH binding (FSH binding per two testes) compared with each of the matched intact control rats. In contrast to FSH binding, not only the total LH binding but also the density of LH binding were invariably lower in the hypophysectomized rats than in the intact control rats. Unlike hypophysectomy at other immature ages, surgery at 9 days of age was followed by significant increases in testicular weight, density of FSH binding, and total FSH binding compared with those values in the initial control rats. There was no significant effect of hypophysectomy on total FSH binding in adult animals, in contrast to the marked decrease in total LH binding. When male rats hypophysectomized at 25 days of age were injected with FSH for 5 days beginning on the 11th day after surgery, dose-dependent increases in total FSH binding and testicular weight were observed. Testosterone treatment induced an increase only in the total FSH binding, but its effect was less potent. Scatchard plot analyses of the binding suggested that changes in FSH binding with age, after hypophysectomy, and after hormonal administration were due to changes in the number of binding sites. Plasma FSH concentrations in all postoperative rats were below or at the level of detectability, indicating that hypophysectomy was successful. In normal immature rats, a significant increase in the plasma FSH level was detected only from 9-19 days of age, in contrast to the continuous increase in total FSH binding during testicular development. These results suggest that FSH and testosterone act as hormonal factors to induce an increase in the number of FSH receptors in the developing testis. Other factors that are independent of pituitary and sex hormones may also contribute to FSH receptor induction.\r"

A number of factors proved of importance in maintaining adequate levels of ANP secretion in such cultures: 1) cultures derived from diencephalon produced much more ANP than cultures derived from diencephalon produced with the distribution of ANP-containing cells in the rat brain; 2) brains from rats at gestational day 17 proved a better source of ANP-secreting cells than brains from rats at gestational day 16; 3) the presence of serum was required in the latter stages of the culture period to allow expression of the ANP gene; and 4) the cultures secreted more ANP when maintained at 39 C vs. 37 C. ANP mRNA transcripts in the neuron-enriched primary cultures were analyzed by S1 nuclease protection and shown to have a transcription start site similar to that employed by rat atrium and fetal hypothalamus in vivo. Dexamethasone and T3, in contrast to their stimulatory effect on ANP production in cardiocyte cultures, suppressed both the release of immunoreactive ANP and the levels of ANP mRNA in the neuron-enriched primary cultures. The cultures incorporated [35S]cysteine into immunoprecipitable ANP. HPLC analysis of 35S-labeled products in the medium revealed that, unlike neonatal cardiocyte cultures, the majority of secreted immunoreactive ANP migrated with the processed form(s) of ANP rather than the prohormone.\r"

  ".W": "Previous results have shown that the pattern of GnRH pulses (amplitude and frequency) can differentially regulate expression of gonadotropin subunit cytoplasmic messenger RNA (mRNA) concentrations. The present study examined the effect of GnRH pulses on alpha, LH-beta and FSH-beta transcription rates as determined by nuclear runoff transcription assay. GnRH pulses (saline to controls) were given to castrate, testosterone-replaced male rats, and the rate of subunit gene transcription was measured in isolated pituitary nuclei. The effect of GnRH treatment duration was examined by giving GnRH pulses (25 ng/pulse at 30-min intervals) for 1, 4, or 24 h. The basal transcription rates [expressed as parts per million (ppm)] were 82 +/- 25 for alpha; 39 +/- 19 for LH-beta and 27 +/- 6 ppm for FSH-beta, and transcription rates of all 3 subunits were elevated at 1 h (3-5-fold vs. saline controls). After 4 h of GnRH pulses, alpha and FSH-beta transcription rates were reduced vs. 1 h, but LH-beta mRNA synthesis rate was maintained. At 24 h, the alpha transcription rate was still increased (66%), but LH-beta and FSH-beta transcription rates had fallen to basal levels despite the continuing pulsatile GnRH stimulus. The second experiment investigated the effect of the duration of GnRH pulses (25 ng/pulse, every 30 min for 4 h or 24 h), on cytoplasmic subunit mRNA concentrations to assess if the initial 4-h increase in transcription rate would induce a rise in cytoplasmic mRNAs. After 4 h of GnRH pulses, alpha and LH-beta mRNAs were unchanged, but FSH-beta mRNA had increased by 36% (P less than 0.05) compared to controls. All 3 subunit mRNAs were increased (approximately 2-fold) by 24 h of GnRH pulses. Administering GnRH pulses for 4 h followed by 20 h of saline pulses did not increase alpha mRNA; LH-beta was slightly increased (P less than 0.05), but FSH-beta mRNA concentrations were similar to levels seen after 24 h of continued GnRH pulses. The third experiment examined the effects of a continuous GnRH infusion and different GnRH pulse frequencies on gonadotropin subunit transcription rates. GnRH (25 ng/pulse) was given at intervals of 8, 30, or 120 min for 4 h (saline to controls). The continuous GnRH infusion (200 ng/h) did not increase the transcription rate of any of the three subunit mRNAs. alpha-subunit transcription rate was increased 2.7- or 4-fold by GnRH pulses given every 8 or 30 min, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We tested the ability of nine monoclonal antibodies (MAb) against human apolipoprotein-A-I (apoA-I), the 28.3-kDa major apoprotein of high density lipoproteins (HDL), to inhibit its photoaffinity labeling with [125I]T4. Two forms were evaluated: isolated lipid-free apoA-I (Sigma or Calbiochem) and lipid-complexed apoA-I [HDL2, (density, 1.063-1.125 g/ml) and HDL3 (density, 1.125-1.210 g/ml)]. After labeling with 0.5 nM [125I]T4 in the presence of MAb or normal mouse IgG, the products were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequent densitometric quantitation of radioactivity associated with the 28.3-kDa band. Group I MAbs, namely those having epitopes in the N-terminal portion of apoA-I, include MAb 16 (epitopes at residues 1-16), 4 and 14 (residues 1-86), and 18 (residues 98-105); group II includes MAbs 7,10, 15, and 17 (epitopes at residues 87-148); group III includes MAb 9 (residues 149-243). All group I MAbs inhibited [125I]T4 binding to isolated apoA-I with this order of potency: MAb 16 (-50% to -61%) greater than MAb 14 (-37% to -41%) greater than MAb 4 (-27% to -33%) greater than MAb 18 (-19% to -27%). In the case of lipid-associated apoA-I, the pattern of hierarchy was variable, presumably related to the known markedly polydisperse nature of HDL, but a constant feature, in contrast to the case of isolated apoA-I, was that MAb 4 was more potent than MAb 14. Group II MAbs gave less than 3% inhibition in both isolated and lipid-complexed apoA-I. Group III MAb 9 either failed to inhibit or gave 18-27% inhibition (one preparation each of HDL2 and HDL3). We conclude that the T4 site of apoA-I is in the N-terminal domain of apoA-I, closer to the epitope for MAb 16 than to that for MAb 18, and that conformational changes occurring when apoA-I is associated with lipids in the HDL particle alter the spatial relationship between some epitopes and the T4 site. Our definition of the T4 site of apoA-I is consistent with another set of data showing that heparin failed to inhibit [125I]T4 binding to isolated apoA-I. Heparin is known to interact with clusters of basic residues, and these residues are concentrated in the midregion of apoA-I.\r"

Table 7 represents the specific malformation rate per 1,000 births in the general population and in newborns delivered after treatment with CC, hMG-hCG, or IVF-ET and GIFT. The malformation rate in the treated groups does not differ from that of the general population. However, as shown by McIntosh et al., the incidence of congenital malformations often rises with a longer follow-up. Most of the reports about babies born after ovulation induction are based on the initial examination done shortly after birth. Thus, studies including examination of these infants up to at least 12 months of age will be undoubtedly of value. Also, data concerning the reproductive capability of women born after ovulation induction is lacking. With regard to the abortion rate in pregnancies achieved after such treatments and procedures, it can be concluded that it does not appear to be higher than that of the general population, particularly when early pregnancy loss, advanced maternal age, the infertility status, and the increased incidence of multiple pregnancies occurring in these patients are taken into consideration.\r"

The areas under the serum progesterone curves, measured over the 1st 10 days of the luteal phase, were significantly greater in the GnRH-a cycles compared with the non-GnRHa cycles, but when calculated per oocyte retrieved were similar in GnRH-a and non-GnRH-a cycles. In contrast, the areas under the luteal phase serum estradiol curves were significantly less in the GnRH-a cycles. These data suggest that GnRH-a treatment is accompanied by potentially beneficial alterations in the systemic steroidal milieu of the luteal phase of IVF cycles.\r"

In nonconception cycles, FSH and LH were increased in the late luteal phase compared with conception cycles in which both gonadotropins were suppressed. Estradiol (E2) and progesterone concentrations increased in pregnancy cycles and may be the sole cause for the decreased gonadotropin concentrations as shown by equivalent concentrations of LH and FSH in both pregnancy and nonpregnancy cycles after matching for E2 concentrations. Subjects who subsequently had twin pregnancy or a spontaneous abortion were compared with those with a successful ongoing singleton conception. There were no significant differences relative to LH and FSH between the three groups, although in twin pregnancy FSH tended to be lower at day 16 from oocyte recovery. It is concluded that suppression of LH and FSH in hyperstimulated pregnancy cycles occurs after the time of the rising human chorionic gonadotropin concentrations in plasma.\r"

Serum luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and testosterone (T) were determined on multiple occasions before, during, and after the antagonist treatment. Five milligrams Nal-Glu markedly suppressed mean serum immunoreactive LH to a mean of 1.5 +/- 0.4 IU/L (+/- SEM), immunoreactive FSH to the limit of assay detection (1 IU/L), and lowered basal mean serum T to castrate range (less than 2 nmol/L). Serum bioactive LH levels also showed a marked decrease in the 5.0-mg group similar to that seen in immunoreactive LH levels. Amplitude of immunoreactive LH pulses was markedly reduced in the 5.0-mg group on day 21. A 1.5-mg dose of Nal-Glu transiently suppressed serum immunoreactive LH levels on day 1. There was a subsequent escape on the rest of the days sampled. Serum immunoreactive FSH levels were not significantly changed over the 21-day treatment period. Serum T levels were transiently suppressed only on day 1 paralleling immunoreactive LH suppression. No adverse systemic side effects occurred. Thus, the 5.0-mg dose of this GnRH antagonist provides a pharmacological means of markedly suppressing the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and, therefore, has potential as a male contraceptive.\r"

Fucoidin significantly inhibited binding compared with controls (greater than 75% inhibition), even if sperm were washed after preincubation with the saccharide. Dextran sulfate also produced significant inhibition, although to a lesser extent (54% inhibition). Chondroitin sulfates A and B, heparin, and dextran did not affect binding. Sodium sulfate and polyglutamic acid did not affect HZA results; polyphosphates produced only moderate inhibition. The potent inhibitory effect of the sulfated carbohydrates fucoidin and dextran is probably competitive (receptor-ligand type) in nature. However, the lack of significant effects of simple charged molecules (nonspecific effects) suggests that the degree of sulfation (charge) may not be crucial to its inhibitory action.\r"

Ovulation did not occur in any of ovaries treated with buserelin or LA (10(2) to 10(4) ng/mL) in the absence of gonadotropin. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists were associated with the resumption of meiosis in follicular oocytes in a dose-related manner. Furthermore, the addition of GnRH-a to the perfusate significantly increased the percentage of follicular oocytes that showed evidence of degeneration compared with contralateral untreated or human chorionic gonadotropin-treated controls. Prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin F2 alpha production by the perfused rabbit ovaries were stimulated significantly by GnRH-a treatment. Exposure to GnRH-a failed to increase either progesterone or estradiol production by the perfused rabbit ovaries. These data demonstrate that GnRH-a act directly in the rabbit ovary to trigger meiotic maturation in oocytes within the follicles, concomitantly increasing oocyte degeneration.\r"

We undertook a randomized controlled study to compare the effects of urinary FSH and human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) using a low-dose regimen in 30 women with PCOS. Each subject received a maximum of three cycles of either FSH or hMG. Ovulation occurred in 75% of subjects and in 77% of cycles induced with FSH and in 94% of women, 85% of cycles of those treated with hMG. A single dominant follicle developed in 70% (FSH) and 65% (hMG) of cycles, respectively. Five singleton pregnancies occurred in each group. This study shows that low-dose FSH and hMG are equally successful in inducing ovulation, suggesting that the success of treatment depends on the low dose of gonadotropin used rather than the presence or absence of luteinizing hormone in the preparation.\r"

We therefore evaluated in this study whether starting pulsatile GnRH therapy before gonadotropin administration might reduce premature luteinization. Eight women underwent induction of ovulation with both combined therapy and pure exogenous follicle-stimulating hormone alone using a crossover scheme. No premature luteinization and a single follicular growth were recorded with the modified combined regimen.

Serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH were measured daily by radioimmunoassay and size and number of follicles were assessed by ultrasonography. Follicle-stimulating hormone in group A (80 mm less than or equal to maxD) was significantly higher than those of group B (60 mm less than or equal to maxD less than 80 mm) and C (maxD less than 60 mm) for the last 4 days of the treatment. This FSH rise in group A was not accounted for by FSH accumulation by the study of pharmacodynamics, and so was thought to be of endogenous origin. Luteinizing hormone was also elevated 3 days before the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in both groups A and B. The number of follicles in group A at hCG administration was significantly greater than that of group C. Any significant differences were not found in either total amount of purified urinary FSH or in the basal FSH and the LH levels before treatment of the three groups. These results suggest that excessive ovarian enlargement during gonadotropin therapy is caused by multiple follicular development primarily stimulated by endogenous FSH. Endogenous LH release further enhances ovarian enlargement.\r"

During 90 treatment cycles, the dose was the only parameter that was progressively adjusted. The overall ovulation rate per cycle was 100% in IHH, functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, and normoandrogenic oligomenorrhea, using only 5 micrograms/90 minutes in functional hypothalamic amenorrhea and normoandrogenic oligomenorrhea and up to 7.5 micrograms/90 minutes in IHH. In PCOS, the ovulation rate was 67.6%, using up to 20 micrograms/90 minutes. The lesser degree of effectiveness observed in PCOS can probably be explained by the different basal endocrine profile presented by these subjects.\r"

Calcium antagonists have been widely used in antihypertensive treatment of diabetics, although a possible influence on glucose tolerance, insulin secretion, and insulin action is unknown. Therefore, the effect of the calcium antagonist isradipine on glucose tolerance and insulin secretion (75 g oral glucose tolerance test) and on peripheral and hepatic insulin action (euglycemic clamp) was evaluated in 11 type II diabetic patients. All patients were treated with placebo or isradipine for 8 weeks (double-blind, crossover design). A second group of six diabetic patients received a thiazide diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide, according to the same protocol. Systolic blood pressure was significantly lowered after isradipine and hydrochlorothiazide compared with placebo (127 +/- 3 versus 139 +/- 6 mm Hg and 129 +/- 4 versus 142 +/- 4, respectively; p less than 0.05). Fasting blood glucose (190 +/- 21 versus 152 +/- 15 mg/dl; p less than 0.01), glucose levels, basal and glucose-stimulated insulin levels were significantly higher after hydrochlorothiazide compared with placebo but remained unchanged after calcium antagonist treatment. Basal hepatic glucose production and peripheral insulin resistance were significantly elevated after hydrochlorothiazide compared with placebo or calcium antagonist therapy. These data indicate that the calcium antagonist isradipine has no effect on glucose tolerance, insulin secretion, and insulin action in type II diabetic patients and might therefore be a useful drug for antihypertensive treatment in diabetes mellitus. However, diuretic treatment can lead to impairment of metabolic control and reduction of insulin action in type II diabetes mellitus.\r"

However, with individual baseline risk assessment by multivariate linear regression analysis using baseline characteristics known to be related to left ventricular function after thrombolytic therapy or outcome of coronary angioplasty, or both, an excess of high risk patients in the invasive treatment group was detected. To adjust for this unequal distribution of baseline risk, multivariate linear regression analysis was performed. No benefit of immediate coronary angioplasty was observed after adjustment. Reocclusion or reinfarction, or both, occurred more frequently in the invasive than in the noninvasive treatment group (18% versus 13%, respectively). Among patients with a patent infarct-related vessel on angiography between days 10 and 22 and without reinfarction before angiography, there was a trend toward benefit from the invasive strategy, indicating that reocclusion and reinfarction might be responsible for the lack of benefit of the invasive strategy. This implies that immediate coronary angioplasty may be beneficial in selected patients, provided that these complications can be prevented.\r"

  ".W": "Among 392 consecutive patients admitted for acute myocardial infarction and treated with thrombolytic drugs, 4 patients (1%) developed an early hemorrhagic pericardial effusion (without ventricular wall rupture) evolving within 24 h to cardiogenic shock consequent to cardiac tamponade. They all suffered from a large anterior myocardial infarction treated within 4 h after onset of symptoms with intravenous anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex (one case), recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) (two cases) or streptokinase (one case), anticoagulation with heparin (all cases) and aspirin (three cases). As soon as pericardial effusion was established by echocardiography, emergency percutaneous pericardiocentesis was performed at the bedside 20 +/- 6 h after thrombolytic therapy was started. This corrected immediately the clinical and hemodynamic status of each patient and a catheter was left in the pericardial space for 34 +/- 18 h. Thus, in the presence of unexplained clinical and hemodynamic deterioration occurring during the first 24 h after thrombolytic treatment of a large myocardial infarction, cardiac tamponade should be suspected. Immediate percutaneous pericardiocentesis followed by continuous drainage is a simple and definitive treatment for this complication.\r"

The standard meal provided per kilogram of body weight 8.3 calories, 0.33 grams of protein, 0.90 grams of carbohydrate, and 0.37 grams of fat. The concentrations of all amino acids, except tryptophan, rose significantly at 2 hours and returned to baseline by 6 hours. Plasma phenylalanine and tyrosine were significantly (P less than 0.05) higher at 2 hours in the two groups of elderly men than in the young healthy men. In other respects the pre- and post-prandial amino acid profiles were not influenced by age. The ratio, tyrosine/other large neutral amino acids (tyr/LNAA), was significantly higher in both elderly groups than in the young men at nearly all time points before and after the test meal. It was generally higher in the demented older men than in the healthy older men. The data demonstrated a delayed plasma clearance of phenylalanine and tyrosine in old age. The elevated plasma tyr/LNAA ratio in the elderly men may have tended to augment an entry of tyrosine, the precursor of norepinephrine and dopamine, into their brains.\r"

The production of other isotypes (IgM, IgG2a, IgG2b) was only slightly decreased by addition of IL-2. No suppression of IgE or IgG1 production was observed if monoclonal anti-IL-2 was added, whereas anti-IFN-gamma had no effect on the suppression of the production of these isotypes. The expression of CD23 on the third day of culture on B cells stimulated with LPS and IL-4 was markedly decreased when IL-2 was added to the cultures on day 0. Addition of monoclonal anti-IL-2 suppressed all effects produced by IL-2, whereas addition of anti-IFN-gamma had no effect.

  ".W": "Recent attention has focused on the role keratinocytes (KC) may play in the induction of T cell-mediated inflammatory responses in skin, particularly because KC, when activated by immunologic stimuli, express MHC class II Ag and secrete immunomodulatory cytokines. We tested the capacity of normal human KC that were stimulated with PMA to induce PBMC proliferation. PMA-treated, but not untreated, KC induced proliferation of allogeneic as well as autologous PBMC; in addition, when purified CD4+ or CD8+ T cells were used as responders, each subset proliferated. PBMC proliferation was not due to direct action of PMA on PBMC, nor to contamination of KC cultures with Langerhans cells (LC) or dermal APC. Pretreatment with different protein kinase C inhibitors abrogated the capacity of PMA-stimulated KC to induce proliferation. Paraformaldehyde-fixed PMA-KC stimulated PBMC proliferation, whereas supernatants from PMA-treated KC failed to do so, indicating that a membrane-associated activity on PMA-KC contributes to the induction of PBMC proliferation. PMA induced intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression on KC; furthermore, mAb against ICAM-1 or against its ligand lymphocyte function-associated Ag (LFA-1) (CD11a/CD18) significantly, but incompletely, reduced the stimulatory capacity of PMA-treated KC, indicating that ICAM-1/LFA-1 interaction contributed to PBMC proliferation. IFN-gamma or TNF-alpha also induced ICAM-1 on KC, but these KC failed to stimulate proliferation, suggesting that PMA induces additional signals from KC, which act in concert with ICAM-1 to promote proliferation. Finally, mAb against HLA-ABC or HLA-DR did not inhibit proliferation. We conclude that PMA can activate KC to stimulate T cell proliferation in a MHC-independent fashion. This activation is mediated by protein kinase C and in part by the induction of ICAM-1 expression on KC.\r"

  ".W": "The LOU/M rat (RT-1w) haplotype, although resistant to an encephalitogenic challenge of guinea pig myelin basic protein (Gp-BP)/CFA and unresponsive to Gp-BP, responded strongly to human (Hu)-BP. Both T cell and antibody responses focused on the 110-129 determinant of Hu-BP, and T cells specific for this epitope transferred clinical and histologic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) to naive LOU/M rats. Moreover, EAE could be induced actively with Hu-BP and a synthetic Hu-S110-129 peptide in CFA, but only with co-immunomodulation by pertussis toxin or cyclophosphamide. Analysis of TCR V region genes revealed the predominant use of the V beta 8.5-J beta 2.3 gene combination, with extensive N region additions to both D beta 1 and D beta 2. These results define the Hu-BP 110-129 peptide sequence as the major encephalitogenic epitope for the LOU/M strain of rat previously considered resistant to EAE, and support the idea that the encephalitogenic property of BP and other CNS Ag for a given MHC is encompassed within immunodominant T cell epitopes. Furthermore, the TCR sequence data indicate the predominant use of a different V beta 8 subfamily member (V beta 8.5) than the V beta 8.2 gene used preferentially by several other rat strains and the PL/J mouse in the T cell response to BP.\r"

The presence of \"antipolar\" antibodies in the sera and the occurrence of insulitis was examined in a proportion of these backcross mice. There was no difference in the incidence of diabetes in mice heterozygous for TCR V beta b/a vs those homozygous for TCR V beta b/b. Among the 17 diabetics (all female) detected in this backcross, 14/17 were H-2nod/nod but 3/17 were H-2nod/q. This supports a previous observation suggesting that the MHC-linked diabetogenic gene originally thought to be recessive may rather be dominant but have a low penetrance in the heterozygous state. Antipolar autoantibodies were found in both female and male backcross mice, and were similarly distributed in diabetic and nondiabetic mice. There appeared to be no correlation between the level of these auto-antibodies and development of diabetes. The incidence and severity of insulitis was linked to MHC but no influence of TCR genes on insulitis nor an association between insulitis and antipolar antibodies could be demonstrated in this study. Further analyses of H-2nod/nod intercross mice homozygous for TCR V beta a or TCR V beta b are currently underway.\r"

  ".U": "91100771\r", 
  ".W": "The adhesion of lymphocytes to vascular endothelium is the first step in their passage from the blood into inflammatory tissues. By modulating endothelial cell (EC) adhesiveness for lymphocytes, cytokines may regulate lymphocyte accumulation and hence the nature and progression of inflammatory responses. IL-1, TNF, IFN-gamma, and IL-4 each increase EC adhesiveness for T cells when used alone in adhesion assays in vitro. As cytokines are more likely to act in combination at sites of inflammation in vivo, we have studied the stimulating effect of different combinations of cytokines on EC adhesiveness for T cells and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). Acting alone IL-1, TNF, IFN-gamma, and IL-4 each significantly enhanced EC adhesiveness for T cells (p less than 0.005), whereas only IL-1 (p less than 0.005) and TNF (p less than 0.005) but not IFN-gamma or IL-4 significantly enhanced adhesiveness for PMN. When EC were stimulated with optimal concentrations of TNF in combination with IL-4 or IFN-gamma, there was a significant further increase in adhesiveness for T cells (p less than 0.003), but not PMN, over that seen with TNF alone. The additive effect of TNF and IL-4 was more marked than that of TNF and IFN-gamma. Although approximately equal proportions of T cells and PMN bound to TNF-stimulated EC, nearly double the proportion of T cells compared with PMN bound EC preincubated with TNF and IL-4 together. A similar interaction with IL-4 or IFN-gamma was exhibited by lymphotoxin. mAb-inhibition studies indicated that the extra increase in binding caused by stimulating EC with TNF and IL-4 in combination was mediated by VCAM-1 whereas that caused by stimulating with TNF and IFN-gamma in combination was substantially mediated through leukocyte function-associated Ag-1- and VCAM-1-independent mechanisms. These observations suggest that whereas IL-1 and TNF alone are unselective in terms of leukocyte adhesion to EC, the combination of TNF (or LT) with IL-4 or IFN-gamma may be of key importance in determining the recruitment of a lymphocyte-predominant infiltrate in immune mediated inflammation, and in initiating the transition from acute to chronic inflammation.\r"

H chains cannot be secreted without assembly to L chains; however, L chains can be secreted in the absence of H chains by both mice and human cells. To examine the influence of H chain expression on human L chain isotype selection (kappa or lambda), we compared the kappa/lambda ratio of L chains unassociated with H chains (free L chains) to the kappa/lambda ratio of L chains associated with H chains. Culture supernatants of human splenocytes were assayed for kappa and lambda L chains. Free L chains were the predominant form of L chains detected in unstimulated cultures, accounting for 68 to 70% of the total. This was in contrast to the minor proportion that free L chains represented (less than 20%) in cultures stimulated with PWM or LPS (p less than 0.01). Furthermore, the kappa/lambda ratio of light chains detected in unstimulated cultures was 0.5 as compared to 1.3 for PWM stimulated cultures (p = 0.0001). To demonstrate that the decreased kappa/lambda ratio of L chains in the supernatants of cultures of unstimulated B cells was due to free L chains, we measured the kappa/lambda ratio of IgG and IgM-associated L chains. In both the stimulated and unstimulated cultures, the kappa/lambda ratio of L chains associated with H chains was greater than the ratio determined for free L chains. Free L chains were shown to be predominantly lambda as compared to the predominantly kappa phenotype of L chains associated with H chains. Thus absence of H chain expression affects selection of L chain isotypes secreted by human B cells.\r"

Using a modified RF ELISA, we showed that polyclonal RF from rheumatoid arthritis patients bound IgG1, 2, and 4 strongly; IgG3 was also bound, although less well. The majority of 18 monoclonal RF from patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia bound IgG1, 2, and 4 only. In contrast to RF from RA, 14 of 18 monoclonal RF did not react with IgG3. Only 3 of 18 monoclonal RF bound IgG3 well. By shuffling C region domains between IgG3 and IgG4, we showed that sequence variation in the CH3 domain is responsible for the differential binding of monoclonal RF to IgG3 and IgG4. Hybrid IgG3/IgG4 antibodies containing the CH3 domain of IgG4 were bound by monoclonal RF, whereas those containing the CH3 domain of IgG3 were not. To evaluate the contribution of the N-linked carbohydrate moiety at Asn-297 to RF binding sites on IgG, we measured RF binding to aglycosylated IgG antibodies produced by mutating Asn-297 to another amino acid. Glycosylated and aglycosylated IgG1, 2, and 4 were bound identically by monoclonal and polyclonal RF. Aglycosylated IgG3, however, was bound better than glycosylated IgG3 by polyclonal RF and by IgG3-reactive monoclonal RF.\r"

The availability of the VH and VL genomic clones from one hybridoma, 40-140, has now allowed studies involving in vitro mutagenesis and chain recombination among these five hybridomas. To determine the relative contributions of the mutations found in either VH or VL to the overall binding properties of these antibodies, we recombined the 40-140VH with the VL of each hybridoma. The 40-140VH gene was transfected into hybridoma variants that produce only VL. The recombinant antibodies show that the mutations present in VH, rather than in VL, affect the fine specificity properties of these antibodies, whereas, the mutations among both VH and VL chains are important in determining antigen affinity. From mutations present in VH that affect fine specificity properties, the comparison of the antibody sequences, and from the previously measured binding properties, we predicted and tested selected VH mutations for their ability to alter specificity or affinity by doing site-directed in vitro mutagenesis. The results for the somatic mutations found in this group of antibodies show: 1) VH mutations control the fine specificity properties that distinguish different members of this group; 2) in particular, VH residues 54 and 55 in CDR2 control the distinguishing characteristics of specificities between these antibodies; and 3) by mutagenesis, we had the unusual result of being able to alter Ag specificity without affecting affinity. A computer model of the 40-140 antibody binding site was generated which indicates that VH residues 54 and 55 are highly accessible.\r"

  ".W": "To better define the effect of systemic glucocorticoids on the cutaneous early and late phase response (LPR), nine atopic subjects were examined in a double-blind cross-over study using skin chambers fixed over denuded skin blisters. A challenge was carried out by placing allergen in the chamber for 60 min in subjects who received either a 3-day pretreatment with 60 mg/day of prednisone or placebo. Skin chamber cell counts and inflammatory mediators (histamine, PGD2, and leukotriene C4 (LTC4)) were measured at hourly intervals for 12 h. Prednisone pretreatment did not alter the immediate skin erythema or release of histamine but ablated the late secondary erythema and rise in histamine. The median histamine values during h 10, 11, and 12 in the placebo and prednisone pretreatment visits were 3.73 and 0.22 ng/ml, respectively (p less than or equal to 0.02). Prednisone did not alter PGD2 production; however, LTC4 production was suppressed during the LPR. The cumulative median LTC4 values during h 7, 8, and 9 were 5.6-fold (p less than or equal to 0.05) more after placebo than after prednisone pretreatment. Prednisone altered cellular traffic more dramatically than it did inflammatory mediators. The influx of eosinophils, which peaked during the 9th and 10th h in placebo-treated patients, was completely blocked by prednisone (p less than or equal to 0.02) for every h from 6 through 12. The influx of basophils, which started during the 9th h and peaked during the 12th h in placebo-treated patients, was suppressed at all time points (p less than or equal to 0.02) in prednisone-treated patients. There was no significant alteration in neutrophil transit into the skin chambers induced by prednisone. We suggest that the selective blockade of eosinophil and basophil influx by prednisone and the associated decrease in inflammatory mediators may contribute to the blockade of the clinical expression of the cutaneous LPR.\r"

Assay rabbits received i.v. injections of 125I-albumin and 111In-neutrophils, and the local accumulation of each label was measured in response to intradermal injections of exudate samples mixed with a potentiating dose of PGE2. When peritoneal exudate samples were tested in the presence of a specific anti-C5a antibody, virtually all the edema-inducing and neutrophil chemoattractant activity was abolished in samples taken up to 2 h after the zymosan injection. Later samples, however, contained increasing levels of a non-C5a component. In C5a-depleted 6-h exudate two peaks of inflammatory activity were separated using cation exchange HPLC. Evidence is presented that C5a itself is unable to stimulate the production of these activities. Both peaks of activity appear related to IL-8/NAP-1 as they inhibited the binding of 125I-IL-8/NAP-1 to human neutrophils.\r"

  ".W": "Human monocytes obtained by counter-current centrifugal elutriation released arachidonic acid when challenged in vitro with Con A, as well as with other soluble (PMA or ionomycin) or particulate stimuli (serum-treated zymosan). Cyclo-oxygenase metabolites were the principal eicosanoids detected in the supernatants of Con A-stimulated, [3H]arachidonate-labeled monocytes, 5-Lipoxygenase (5-LO) products, such as leukotriene B4 (LTB4), were conspicuously absent. Release of arachidonate and its metabolites in response to Con A was dependent on the presence of extracellular Ca2+, but not Mg2+. In contrast to serum-treated zymosan challenge, which resulted in increased inositol trisphosphate and LTB4 release, Con A-induced inositol phospholipid hydrolysis in monocytes was limited to phosphatidylinositol or phosphatidylinositol monophosphate. Despite an inability to augment LTB4 release, Con A or PMA induced a loss of 5-lipoxygenase from a cytosolic compartment that was similar to that achieved with a calcium ionophore (ionomycin), a potent stimulus for LTB4 generation. When cell-associated LTB4 was evaluated, evidence for increased LTB4 production was obtained in response to either stimulus (PMA greater than Con A). In combination, however, PMA and Con A treatment resulted in monocyte LTB4 release comparable with that observed with the calcium ionophore or STZ. LTB4 release in response to all stimuli tested was inhibited by MK-886, a drug that binds to 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein. These results indicate the following: 1) Phospholipase A2 activation and attendant arachidonic acid release induced by agents that increase intracellular Ca2+ and/or generate diacylglycerol results in increased synthesis and release of PG and increased synthesis of leukotrienes, but not necessarily leukotriene release. 2) 5-LO translocation, which may occur independently of increased intracellular Ca2+, may be necessary for LTB4 generation but is insufficient for its release. 3) 5-Lipoxygenase-activating protein activity is necessary for 5-LO activation and LTB4 release in response to all stimuli investigated here. 4) Phorbol ester, an activator of protein kinase C, may synergize with agents such as Con A (which by themselves induce a minimal intracellular Ca2+ rise), so as to result in the release of LTB4. Thus, Con A may represent a class of surface receptor-aggregating agents that initiates inflammatory changes or immunomodulation associated with liberation of PG and might predispose to release of other inflammatory mediators, such as leukotrienes, in the presence of additional signals including protein kinase activation.\r"

  ".W": "Monocyte recruitment and accumulation in the synovial tissue is pivotal in the evolution of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In the present study we examined the chemotactic potential of monocytes obtained from synovial fluid (SF) of patients with RA. Functionally, SF monocytes exhibited greatly diminished chemotactic activity to C5a compared with monocytes from the peripheral blood. In contrast, their chemotactic responsiveness to the synthetic peptide, FMLP, was nearly normal. To define a mechanism for this differential chemotactic dysfunction, cell-surface receptors for C5a (C5aR) and FMLP (FMLP-R) were evaluated. Whereas FMLP-R expression was similar on both blood and inflammatory monocytes, C5aR expression was markedly reduced on SF cells. Because decreased C5a binding in certain RA SF samples could not be attributed to free C5a, known or suspected components of inflammatory SF were evaluated for their ability to modulate chemotactic ligand receptors. Bacterial products including LPS and streptococcal cell walls, which are potent monocyte activators, down-regulated C5aR without affecting FMLP-R. Moreover, the cytokines IFN-gamma and granulocyte-macrophage-CSF selectively decreased C5aR in parallel with decreased in vitro chemotactic activity to C5a. Thus, these data indicate that 1) synovial effusions may contain C5a and/or inflammatory mediators that modulate phenotypic and functional changes in monocytes, 2) chemotactic ligand receptors are independently regulated in inflammatory lesions, and 3) decreased C5aR expression and chemotactic potential likely provide a mechanism whereby monocyte-macrophages persist within the inflamed synovium.\r"

We have shown that this Ag, La gp42, is expressed on the surface of L. amazonensis promastigotes, being anchored to the membrane by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol moiety. As demonstrated by lectin blotting studies, La gp42 is glycosylated, binding both Con A and wheat germ agglutinin. Immunologically, La gp42 is strongly recognized by sera from patients with different forms of leishmaniasis as well as by patients with Chagas' disease. In addition, we show that purified La gp42 stimulates the proliferation of human T lymphocytes obtained from several leishmaniasis patients. Finally, the N-terminal sequence of La gp42 was obtained and a serologically cross-reactive 42-kDa protein with a homologous sequence was identified in Leishmania major.\r"

The results showed that human neutrophils inhibited the growth of P. falciparum and killed the parasite via a phagocytic mechanism. The cytokines significantly augmented the neutrophil-mediated killing of the parasite. When compared with the effects of TNF-alpha similar results were seen although IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha were effective at 10-fold less the concentration of lymphotoxin. The maximum neutrophil-mediated parasite killing was seen in the presence of immune serum and the cytokines. These findings suggest that T cells regulate the antimalarial activity of neutrophils.\r"

The isolated poly(A)+ mRNA from Ts cell clone BVI/5 was used to construct a cDNA library in the bacteriophage lambda gt11. Full-length cDNA clones specific for TCR alpha and TCR beta genes have been detected and isolated by hybridization with specific oligonucleotide probes. The functional rearranged TCR alpha gene is composed of a member of the V alpha 1 family, the junctional gene J alpha TT11 and C alpha. The gene segments V beta 13, D beta 2.1, J beta 2.4, and C beta 2 form the functional rearranged TCR beta gene. Furthermore, a nonfunctional TCR alpha gene transcript has been detected, where a V alpha 8 gene is rearranged to a so far not described J alpha gene segment (J alpha BVI). A stop codon in its junctional region is responsible for this non-functional transcript. By using Southern blot analysis, the described rearranged TCR genes can be detected in the J alpha junctional region and in the J beta 2 cluster on the genomic DNA level. Immunoprecipitation studies with the KT3 anti-CD3 mAb and flow microfluorimetry analysis with the H57-597 anti-TCR-alpha/beta mAb show that TCR/CD3 complexes are synthesized and expressed on BVI/5 Ts cells. Taken together, the cDNA sequencing data, the protein studies, and the specificity of Ag recognition demonstrate that the BVI/5 Ts cell clone not only transcribes the TCR alpha and beta genes but also expresses a functional BSA-specific receptor.\r"

When medium contains 0.1 mM calcium or above, the cells lose their proliferative ability, rapidly stratify, and terminally differentiate. Because 1,25(OH)2D3 (a modulator of Ca++ homeostasis) enhances the differentiation of keratinocytes, we investigated whether a link exists between 1,25(OH)2D3-induced release of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) from PtdIns 4,5-P2 and intracellular calcium [Ca++]i release from keratinocytes. Specifically, primary culture of keratinocytes were loaded with fluorescence dye Fura-2AM (10 microM) and changes in fluorescence intensity were monitored at the excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm and emission wavelength of 505 nm. Additions of two agonists, 1,25(OH)2D3 (1.2 x 10(-9) M) and 13-Cis retinoic acid (0.2 x 10(-9) M), to dye-loaded keratinocytes induced rapid release of [Ca++]i, respectively, followed by gradual return to the prestimulated state. Addition of Ins(1,4,5)P3 (10 microM) to saponin-treated (leaky) keratinocytes also resulted in a rapid release of [Ca++]i. In contrast, the addition of inositol-1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 at similar concentrations exerted negligible effect. Taken together, these results support the view that 1,25(OH)2D3-induced [Ca++]i release in keratinocytes may be via the Ins(1,4,5)P3-induced early release of intracellular [Ca++]i. This may explain, at least in part, 1,25(OH)2D3-enhanced keratinocyte differentiation.\r"

We have used an in vitro skin equivalent as a model system in which to study keratinocyte/melanocyte interactions in both fetal and neonatal skin. Because the skin equivalent model has been shown to closely simulate the morphologic and biochemical features of differentiated epidermis we hypothesized that the factors that influence melanocyte position and differnetiation would also function in this system. Localization of melanocytes in skin equivalents, using the monoclonal antibody HMB-45, established that melanocytes in fetal skin equivalents are grouped and distributed both basally and suprabasally, whereas melanocytes in neonatal skin equivalents are singly distributed among basal epidermal keratinocytes, similar to the distributions of fetal and neonatal melanocytes, respectively, in vivo. Similarly, in fetal and neonatal skin equivalents the patterns of expression of a number of melanoma/melanocyte-associated antigens closely parallels that seen in vivo. These results suggest that the skin equivalent model is an excellent system in which to study the dynamic factors that regulate melanocyte migration, proliferation, and differentiation during ontogeny and post-natal differentiation of the skin.\r"

We have investigated the susceptibility of peritoneal macrophages and the corresponding autologous blood monocytes from normal women to infection by the BA-L strain of HIV-1. In 10 of 18 examples, peritoneal macrophages showed signs of infection within 4-5 days, which was earlier than the autologous monocytes. In contrast to peritoneal macrophages, lung macrophages from 10 of 11 normal donors failed to show significant reverse transcriptase (RT) values 3 weeks post infection. Monolayer cultures of monocytes cultured for 5 days prior to infection developed RT values similar overall to those of freshly isolated cells although individual donors varied as to which culture condition was optimal. The ease of infection of peritoneal macrophages did not correlate with levels of CD4 antigen or degree of pelvic inflammatory development, nor were macrophages harvested from women early in the menstrual cycle significantly more susceptible to infection than those collected from midcycle on. This unexplained heightened infectibility of peritoneal macrophages in a proportion of normal women suggests that those individuals could be more at risk for heterosexual transmission of HIV-1 infection.\r"

The AIDS attack rates at 39 months follow-up were significantly higher in the men with negative versus positive antibody profiles to nef, tat, and protease, respectively. [Difference (D) between attack rates = 11.279, 5.884, and 8.322, respectively]. No significant difference was found between men with negative versus positive antibody profiles to rev. The above differences between AIDS attack rates were clearly lower than those reported from the same cohort for men who were serum HIV-1 antigen positive versus negative, and for men with low versus normal CD4+ lymphocyte counts, but with respect to nef antibody-response profiles, resembled the difference reported between anti-HIV-1 core antibody-negative versus antibody-positive men. In the subgroup of men without any of the markers previously found to be predictive of progression to AIDS in the cohort (persistent HIV-1 p24 antigenemia, low anti-HIV-1 anti-core antibody reactivity, and low CD4+ cell counts), antibody profiles to nef, rev, tat, and protease did not contribute to the prediction of outcome of infection. When used in combination with persistent HIV-1 p24 antigenemia and low CD4+ cell counts, negative antibody profiles to nef and protease, respectively, were equally sensitive and specific in predicting progression to AIDS, as was low anti-HIV-1 anti-core antibody reactivity.\r"

Cardiac symptoms including bradycardia and, less frequently, tachyrhythmia occurred after about 30 minutes to 2 hours. Therapeutic measures included administration of activated charcoal, gastric lavage and a saline laxative, catecholamines, and in some patients, hypertonic sodium bicarbonate, insertion of a transvenous pacemaker and hemoperfusion. Fatal outcome was mainly due to cardiac conduction disturbances progressing to electromechanical dissociation or asystolia. Resuscitation, which had to be performed in 29 patients, was successful in only two of them. No correlation was found between fatal outcome, the type of antiarrhythmic, and ingested dose. Since a specific treatment is not available and resuscitive procedures including sodium bicarbonate and insertion of a pacemaker are of limited therapeutic value, early diagnosis and primary detoxification are most important for prevention of fatal outcome.\r"

Concentration ratios (isopropanol:acetone) ranged up to 5.12. All five patients had Type I diabetes mellitus and were insulin-dependent. At the time isopropanol was detected each patient was hyperglycemic, and four patients were acidotic. These findings tend to corroborate clinically some earlier autopsy reports that acetone may be converted to isopropanol in physiological conditions in which reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is elevated. The conversion of acetone to isopropanol in vivo has significant clinical and forensic toxicological implications.\r"

In a multivariate analysis, the most highly significant predictors were the presence or absence of bone pain, serum testosterone levels, serum alkaline phosphatase levels, and performance status. Patients with all four factors favorable for survival had a 2-year survival rate of 84% as compared with only 8% for patients with none of the four factors favorable for survival. No other factors were significant. A separate analysis of serum testosterone levels revealed that the higher the pretreatment serum testosterone level, the greater the survival rate. Compared with patients with serum testosterone levels less than 6.9 nmol/L, significant differences in survival were observed for patients with serum testosterone levels of 10.4 to 13.9, 13.9 to 17.3, and over 17.3 nmol/L. These results have important implications for the design and analysis of future clinical trials of hormone therapy and for counseling patients regarding the short-term prognosis of their disease.\r"

Data on burn deaths caused by cigarettes were obtained from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The estimated number of deaths among nonsmokers from lung cancer attributable to passive smoking was obtained from a report of the National Academy of Sciences. Age-, sex-, and race-specific current and former smoking prevalence rates in 1988 for adults aged greater than or equal to 35 years and for women aged 18-44 years were estimated by linear extrapolation using National Health Interview Survey data for 1974-1987.\r"

Although T-cell specificity is determined primarily by the structure of the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) heterodimer, a developmentally regulated process acts to ensure that cells bearing class II-restricted TCRs are CD4+ and those bearing class I-restricted TCRs express only CD8. To investigate this maturation process, we have engineered transgenic mice in which CD4 is expressed in all thymocyte subsets and in all peripheral T cells. Peripheral CD4+8+ T lymphocytes from these mice react with both class I and class II alloantigens. Moreover, expression of the CD4 transgene disrupts the positive selection of doubly transgenic thymocytes bearing a class I-restricted TCR specific for the male (H-Y) antigen. Hence the CD4 coreceptor participates directly in T-cell repertoire selection.\r"

Immunological pathways involving IgE can lead to damage to the developing schistosomulum and it has been suggested that responses involving IgE could have evolved as protection against helminth infections. There has been no epidemiological evidence to support this idea and the only significant IgE responses known in man are those involved in the pathogenesis of allergic disease. Here we measure serological response during reinfection with S. haematobium and demonstrate that IgE antibodies in man can be beneficial. Our results support the hypothesis that the slow build-up of IgE to high levels and the early production of IgG4 antibodies, which may block IgE pathways are responsible for delaying the development of protective immunity to S. haematobium.\r"

The relative importance of these mechanisms in the development of tolerance of more mature, peripheral T cells either to self or to exogenous antigens is unclear, although recent data relate the development of T-cell tolerance in the periphery to clonal anergy. We have now investigated the induction of extrathymic tolerance using BALB/c mice that were made tolerant to Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B, a superantigen which specifically interacts in such mice with T cells bearing V beta 8 antigen receptors. Both euthymic and athymic mice made tolerant to S. aureus enterotoxin B had a markedly reduced number of V beta 8.1,2+ CD4+ peripheral T cells. This reduction was accompanied by genomic DNA fragmentation that is associated with cell death. These results indicate that a deletional mechanism can contribute to the induction of T-cell tolerance in peripheral lymphoid cells.\r"

We have now identified and purified a cytosolic complex containing the same four coat proteins as those of Golgi transport vesicles. We term this complex the Golgi coat promoter or 'coatomer'. The coatomer also contains polypeptides of Mr 36K, 35K and 20K. It represents about 0.2% of soluble cytosolic protein. Gel filtration of unfractionated cytosol indicates that beta-COP resides exclusively in the coatomer complex. The complex seems to be a likely candidate for the unassembled precursor of Golgi coated vesicles, and its purification should help investigations of the role of coat proteins in membrane budding, for which it is necessary to use a refined cell-free system.\r"

We have now extended these models to ask if B-cell tolerance as described for non-disease-associated antigens also operates for the targets of autoimmunity. The target we have chosen is DNA. Anti-DNA antibodies are diagnostic of certain autoimmune syndromes in humans and are a characteristic of the murine model of systemic autoimmunity, the MRl/lpr mouse. Antibodies to both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA have been implicated in disease. By generating anti-DNA transgenic mice, we have addressed the question of whether DNA-specific B cells are regulated in normal (non-autoimmune) mice. We indeed found that most transgenic B cells bind DNA, yet we failed to detect secreted anti-DNA. We suggest that as a consequence of their self-reactivity these B cells are developmentally arrested.\r"

The gene corresponding to the DMD locus produces a 14-kilobase (kb) messenger RNA that codes for a large cytoskeletal membrane protein, dystrophin. DMD and Becker's muscular dystrophy are the consequences of dystrophin mutations. The exact biological function of dystrophin remains unknown but it has been demonstrated that it is localized to the cytoplasmic face of the cell membrane and has direct interaction with several other membrane proteins. We report here the synthesis of a 14-kb full-length complementary DNA for the mouse muscle dystrophin mRNA and the expression of this cDNA in COS cells. The recombinant dystrophin is indistinguishable from mouse muscle dystrophin by western blot analysis with anti-dystrophin antibodies and was shown by an immunofluorescent technique to be localized in the cell membrane. Our successful construction of a functional full-length cDNA opens opportunities for the study of structure and function of dystrophin and provides an opportunity to initiate gene therapy studies.\r"

Although several lines of evidence suggest that activation of the PAF receptor stimulates phospholipase C and subsequent inositol trisphosphate formation through G protein(s), the PAF receptor and calcium channel are reported to show a close relation. As a first approach to cloning lipid autacoid receptors, we have isolated complementary DNA for the PAF receptors. Our strategy involved gene expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes and electrophysiological detection of PAF-induced responses. Sequence analysis indicates that the receptor belongs to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors.\r"

The principal indication for intubation was loss of protective airway reflexes and not hypercarbia or hypoxemia. In those patients who required mechanical ventilation the average duration was 23 +/- 22 days, with the 10 most severely affected patients (greater than or equal to 28 days of mechanical ventilation) averaging 53 +/- 25 days. Excluding patients ventilated for more than a month, those who underwent tracheostomy were hospitalized nearly twice as long as those who were managed by nasotracheal intubation only (33.5 days vs 63.2 days). The use of continuous nasogastric feedings has supplied most infants with sufficient enteral feedings to avoid weight loss and the need for central intravenous alimentation.\r"

Urethral pathologic conditions, established with urethroscopy or histologic examination, or both, included urethral diverticula, inflammatory granuloma, and primary and metastatic neoplasms. On T2-weighted images, all normal urethras demonstrated a characteristic targetlike appearance with differentiation among the outer ring of low signal intensity, the middle zone of higher signal intensity, and the center of low signal intensity. After injection of gadopentetate dimeglumine, the targetlike appearance of the normal urethra was seen on the T1-weighted images. Urethral diverticula were detected with MR imaging in all nine patients with that diagnosis, and in each, MR imaging demonstrated urethral expansion, distortion of the zonal anatomy, and presence of fluid in the middle zone. Primary or metastatic urethral neoplasms were also detected with MR imaging in every patient with the diagnosis, but differentiation between benign and malignant disease was not possible. Local staging of primary or metastatic malignant disease was correct in eight of the 11 patients. In three patients, the inflammatory changes could not be differentiated from tumor invasion, resulting in overestimation of tumor extent.\r"

Of the 596 children in the study, 315 were ambulatory and 281 were hospitalized. Virologic studies included isolation and rapid diagnosis of virus from specimens of nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) and serologic studies of blood samples. Cultures of NPA for C. trachomatis were performed for children less than 6 months of age who had pneumonia. Of the LRI cases, 45% were associated with viral infections of the respiratory tract and 12.1% were associated with C. trachomatis. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) accounted for 45.2% of infections with viral agents and was associated with acute bronchitis, acute bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. Parainfluenza type 3 virus was the most common virus found in conjunction with laryngitis and croup. The incidence of infections due to RSV peaked in July and August, while that of infections due to parainfluenza viruses peaked in February and March; influenza viruses and adenoviruses were isolated throughout the year.\r"

Intraperitoneal administration of the peptide antigen to transgenic mice results in a rapid deletion of the immature CD4+ CD8+ TCRlo thymocytes.

It is the target for both protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent and -independent signals. Function of the SRE requires binding of a cellular protein, termed serum response factor (SRF). A second protein, p62TCF, recognizes the SRE-SRF complex to form a ternary complex. A mutated SRE that bound SRF but failed to form the ternary complex selectively lost response to PKC activators, but retained response to PKC-independent signals. Thus, two different signaling pathways act through discrete nuclear targets at the SRE. At least one of these pathways functions by recruitment of a pathway-specific accessory factor (p62TCF). These results offer a molecular mechanism to account for the biological specificity of signals that appear to act through common DNA sequence elements.\r"

  ".W": "Molecular mechanisms that mediate signal transduction by growth inhibitory cytokines are poorly understood. Type I (alpha and beta) interferons (IFNs) are potent growth inhibitory cytokines whose biological activities depend on induced changes in gene expression. IFN-alpha induced the transient activation of phospholipase A2 in 3T3 fibroblasts and rapid hydrolysis of [3H]arachidonic acid (AA) from prelabeled phospholipid pools. The phospholipase inhibitor, bromophenacyl bromide (BPB), specifically blocked IFN-induced binding of nuclear factors to a conserved, IFN-regulated enhancer element, the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE). BPB also caused a dose-dependent inhibition of IFN-alpha-induced ISRE-dependent transcription in transient transfection assays. Specific inhibition of AA oxygenation by eicosatetraynoic acid prevented IFN-alpha induction of factor binding to the ISRE. Treatment of intact cells with inhibitors of fatty acid cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase enzymes resulted in amplification of IFN-alpha-induced ISRE binding and gene expression. Thus, IFN-alpha receptor-coupled AA hydrolysis may function in activation of latent transcription factors by IFN-alpha and provides a system for studying the role of AA metabolism in transduction of growth inhibitory signals.\r"

Our first goal was to examine the effects of acetylcholine on diameter of the basilar artery in vivo. Because aggregating platelets may have important effects on cerebral arteries, our second goal was to examine the effects on the basilar artery of products that are released by platelets (thromboxane, serotonin, and adenosine 5'-diphosphate). Diameter of the basilar artery was measured through a cranial window in anesthetized rats (n = 25). Baseline diameter of the basilar artery was 247 +/- 10 microns mean +/- SEM. Topical application of acetylcholine at 10(-6) and 10(-5) M dilated the basilar artery by 13 +/- 2% and 19 +/- 2%, respectively. The thromboxane analogue U46619 at 10(-8) and 10(-7) M reduced the diameter of the basilar artery by 18 +/- 5% and 29 +/- 4%, respectively. At 10(-8) and 10(-7) M, serotonin had little effect on pial arterioles on the cerebrum but constricted the basilar artery by 18 +/- 2% and 29 +/- 4%, respectively. At 10(-6) and 10(-5) M, adenosine 5'-diphosphate produced marked dilatation of pial arterioles on the cerebrum (9 +/- 2% and 20 +/- 3%, respectively) but had little effect on the basilar artery (increased diameter by 4 +/- 2% and 6 +/- 2%, respectively). Thus, in contrast to some studies of the basilar artery in vitro, acetylcholine produces dilatation of the basilar artery in vivo. Potent constrictor responses to thromboxane and serotonin, in combination with the minimal dilator effect of adenosine 5'-diphosphate, suggest that release of these products during platelet aggregation would favor constriction of the basilar artery.\r"

We then measured the brain water content, the brain sodium and potassium contents, the in vitro proton nuclear magnetic resonance longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) relaxation times, and the area of the edematous regions. Compared with saline treatment (n = 39), peptide treatment decreased the brain water content in a dose-dependent manner and decreased the brain sodium content significantly (p less than 0.05). Peptide treatment also suppressed the lengthening of both T1 and T2 in edematous tissue (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01, respectively) and reduced the area of the edematous regions observed by magnetic resonance imaging (p less than 0.01). Atrial natriuretic peptide appears to have a pharmacological effect on ischemic brain edema, possibly by suppressing the elevation of water content through regulation of electrolyte transport in the brain.\r"

Pharmacists can play an important role in ensuring cost-effective and appropriate care of critically ill patients. The length of hospital stay, the single most important variable influencing the overall cost of patient care, is increased by lack of a structured patient management plan and by the development of complications. Many of these complications are preventable by appropriate drug therapy and monitoring, thus representing the cost factor most controllable by pharmacists. Pharmacists can use newer tools such as cost-effective analysis and clinical decision analysis to identify and utilize drug therapies that result in decreased complications and decreased length of hospital stay, as measured by decreased costs. Equally important is the development of criteria for the appropriate use of drug therapies. Pharmacists must take an active role in working with physicians, nurses, payers, and risk managers.\r"

IFN-gamma-producing cells displayed no such variation (mean, 77 +/- 8 IFN-gamma-producing cells/cm2). The mean IL-2/IFN-gamma-producing cell ratio was 2.69 +/- 0.84, indicating preferential induction of IL-2. The detailed distribution of lymphokine-producing cells showed that IL-2 and IFN-gamma-producing cells were located mainly in the follicular areas. The mean follicular/interfollicular ratio was 1.82 +/- 0.16 for IL-2 and 1.92 +/- 0.19 for IFN-gamma-producing cells. The results show that T-cell activation, defined by lymphokine production, occurs in FL lymph nodes in direct contact with malignant B cells. Thus, lymphokine production may play an important role in the control of tumor growth, which is the result of interaction between tumor cells and host-derived immune reaction.\r"

  ".W": "Human colon adenocarcinomas and adjacent normal colon tissues were stained immunohistochemically with three different monoclonal antibodies and one preparation of polyclonal antibodies against each of the two plasminogen activators, uPA (urokinase type) and tPA (tissue type). The staining patterns seen with the respective sets of antibodies were identical. In all of 10 cases, staining for uPA in the normal colon tissue was confined to scattered fibroblastlike cells in the lamina propria. Other cells, including epithelial and endothelial cells, were uPA negative. All the tumor infiltrates contained many more uPA-positive cells than the normal tissues, but the staining was confined to fibroblastlike cells and endothelial cells in the tumor stroma, while no staining of the malignant epithelial cells was detected. Analysis for uPA by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in four cases showed an average uPA content of 0.15 ng uPA/mg protein in the normal colon tissues and 1.6 ng uPA/mg protein in the tumors. Tissue-type plasminogen activator immunoreactivity was confined to endothelial cells in both the normal colon tissue and in the colon carcinomas. These findings may indicate that colon cancer cells recruit stromal cells to produce uPA involved in degradation of the extracellular matrix during invasive growth.\r"

As demonstrated by electron microscopic autoradiography, lipid bodies can serve as intracellular sites of 3H-arachidonic acid localization in eosinophils and other cells. To evaluate the role of lipid bodies as stores of esterified arachidonate, subcellular fractionation of lipid-body-rich human eosinophils was used to isolate lipid bodies free of other organelles. In lipid bodies isolated from 3H-arachidonate-labeled eosinophils, 3H-arachidonate was esterified almost totally in glycerolipids, predominantly in classes of phospholipids, including phosphatidyl-inositol and phosphatidylcholine. Lipid bodies, especially in leukocytes participating in inflammation, could represent intracellular sources of esterified arachidonate available for eicosanoid formation.\r"

The present report shows that in the control brain, the predominant pattern of synaptic immunostaining in the neocortex was that of an evenly distributed densely granular immunolabeling of the neuropil, while in the paleocortex and in subcortical areas of the brain most of the presynaptic terminals were distributed along the dendritic arborizations or around the neuronal somata. The immunochemical and the immunohistochemical analysis of the Alzheimer's disease tissue showed that the frontal and parietal cortex presented the most severe and widespread loss, with a 45% loss in synaptophysin immunoreactivity. These areas showed an average 35% loss of large neurons. The visual cortex, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, nucleus basalis of Meynert, and locus ceruleus displayed some degree of loss, but to a lesser extent. In addition to this loss, the basic patterns of organization of the presynaptic terminals were altered, with the presence of abundant, enlarged synaptophysin-labeled terminals. This study further supports the role of synaptic pathology in Alzheimer's disease.\r"

One hundred sixty-six psychiatric patients and 37 healthy comparison subjects were included in the study. Ninety of the patients suffered from schizophrenia, 54 from bipolar disorder, and 22 from major depression. Venous blood samples were obtained from all subjects between 8:00 and 10:00 a.m. and were immediately tested for cold agglutinin titers. RESULTS: A high frequency (42.2%) of positive cold agglutinin titers was detected in the schizophrenic patients, compared with the bipolar (11.1%) and unipolar (9.0%) patients and the comparison group (8.1%). The investigators did not find any pharmacological effect on these results. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that, at least in this group, positive cold agglutinin titers are associated with schizophrenia. However, this observation cannot provide direct evidence for the involvement of viral or autoimmune factors in schizophrenia.\r"

Pancreatic juice, drained directly from the pancreatic duct, was collected in 4-hour fractions. Volume, bicarbonate, protein, amylase, and chymotrypsin were measured. In the first two postoperative days, there was a slow increase in all measured indices. On the third postoperative day, an abrupt rise occurred, after which pancreatic secretion stabilized.

To investigate these problems, rats bearing methylcholanthrene-induced sarcomas were maintained on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for 10 to 12 days beginning 23 days after tumor inoculation. Combined treatment of one group of these rats with the glutamine antimetabolite, acivicin, and the beta 2-adrenergic agonist, clenbuterol, arrested tumor growth, increased skeletal muscle mass and protein content, increased gut mass, and decreased total plasma lipid levels. Resting energy expenditure and cardiac mass were increased by TPN and were increased further by acivicin plus clenbuterol. These results demonstrate that tumor growth and muscle wasting can be controlled during TPN of tumor-bearing organisms. Therefore, cachectic depletion of lean body tissue may not be obligatory in neoplastic disease.\r"

The effect of cromolyn sodium on bronchial hyperresponsiveness may result from its ability to stabilize mast cells. Other contributory properties of cromolyn sodium are reviewed.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the ability of the 12-lead electrocardiogram to estimate infarction size after reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction. DESIGN: The presence or absence of Q waves and the Selvester QRS score obtained before and after hospital discharge were compared with radionuclide estimates of infarction size and ejection fraction at discharge and 6 weeks later, regional wall motion at discharge and 6 weeks later, and myocardial perfusion defect size quantitated with Tc-99m-sestamibi at discharge. SETTING: A tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: A consecutive series of 43 patients with acute myocardial infarction who received acute reperfusion therapy and were assessed using 12-lead electrocardiography, radionuclide angiography, and Tc-99m-sestamibi tomographic imaging before discharge. INTERVENTIONS: All 43 patients received acute reperfusion therapy: 21 patients received intravenous tissue plasminogen activator, and 22 patients underwent primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The correlation of QRS score and Q waves with three radionuclide estimates of infarction size. RESULTS: A significant correlation was found between myocardial perfusion defect size at discharge and both left ventricular ejection fraction and regional wall motion at discharge and 6 weeks later (r = -0.71 to -0.81; all comparisons, P less than 0.001). Little correlation was found between electrocardiographic findings and radionuclide measurements of left ventricular function and perfusion. Presence or absence of Q waves at discharge was not associated with any difference in ejection fraction, regional wall motion, or perfusion defect at discharge. No correlation was found between QRS score and ejection fraction or myocardial perfusion defect size at discharge. The QRS score at discharge correlated only weakly with regional wall motion at discharge and 6 weeks later. This lack of correlation was unchanged when electrocardiograms obtained after hospital discharge were analyzed. CONCLUSION: Although inexpensive and readily available, the 12-lead electrocardiogram does not appear to provide a reliable estimate of infarction size after reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction.\r"

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected serum specimens. SETTING: A referral-based university hospital. PATIENTS: Sixty-three consecutive patients who developed non-A, non-B post-transfusion hepatitis after open-heart surgery. All patients had follow-up with serial serum testing and clinical evaluation. The mean (+/- SD) duration of follow-up after hepatitis onset was 81 +/- 33 months (range, 13 to 132 months). Seventeen patients recovered after acute-phase illness, whereas 46 developed chronic disease which, in 30 cases, was confirmed histologically. MAIN RESULTS: Of 32 patients tested before transfusion, 1 (3.1%) had anti-HCV. Fifty-nine (93%) patients were anti-HCV positive during acute-phase hepatitis: Patients with \"early\" seroconversion (less than 15 days after hepatitis onset) did not differ from those with \"late\" seroconversion (greater than 60 days after onset) in epidemiologic, clinical, and biochemical features. The rate of anti-HCV positivity during acute-phase illness was not significantly different among patients who recovered (76%) compared with those who developed chronic disease (95%). At 6 to 12 months, patients whose disease resolved had lower antibody activity than those with progressive disease. Further, during long-term follow-up (1 to 9 years), 53% of patients whose disease resolved but only 6.9% of patients who had progressive disease became anti-HCV negative. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatitis C virus is the major cause of post-transfusion hepatitis in Italy. The time to anti-HCV seroconversion varies widely after hepatitis onset and is not significantly associated with acute-phase features or outcome of disease.\r"

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. PATIENTS: Serum samples from 128 patients who underwent liver transplantation. Sixty-six patients who had 6 months of follow-up and for whom both pretransplant and post-transplant serum samples were available were included in a study to asses the relation between anti-HCV and post-transplant hepatitis. MEASUREMENTS: Sera were tested for anti-HCV using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and, if positive, two confirmatory tests were done. Patients had a biopsy every week until two specimens showed no abnormal findings. MAIN RESULTS: Only patients with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis (15 of 30; 50%), alcoholic cirrhosis (7 of 19; 37%), and chronic hepatitis B infection (3 of 11; 27%) were anti-HCV positive. No patient with another form of chronic liver disease or with acute liver failure due to non-A, non-B hepatitis was anti-HCV positive. After transplantation, loss of anti-HCV was frequent and acquisition rare. Hepatitis developed in the graft in 17% of patients, but the incidence was similar among anti-HCV negative and anti-HCV-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatitis C virus is a common cause of chronic liver disease in patients requiring liver transplantation, but anti-HCV is rarely found in patients with acute liver failure. Previous HCV infection, based on detection of anti-HCV, is not an independent risk factor for post-transplant hepatitis.\r"

SETTING: Five hospitals in Massachusetts. PATIENTS: Subjects were drawn from a consecutive sample of all adult patients (excluding obstetrics or psychiatry patients) hospitalized during the first 6 months of 1987 as part of a larger study of hospital costs. For the current study, if patients were re-admitted, we included in our analysis only data on the first admission during the study period. We obtained usable survey data from 12,068 of 17,231 eligible patients. RESULTS: Delays in care were reported by 16% of patients. The odds of reporting delays in care among patients who were black, poor, uninsured, or without a regular physician were 40% to 80% greater than those for other patients (P less than 0.01). Most patients who reported delays thought that their problem was not serious (64%). Cost was an important factor in delaying care for patients in lower socioeconomic positions; the odds of delaying care because of cost for patients who were both poor and uninsured were 12 times greater than the odds for other patients (P less than 0.001). After controlling for diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) and severity, patients who reported delays had 9% longer hospital stays compared with others (P less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients generally thought to be disadvantaged are at especially high risk for delaying care for conditions that eventually lead to hospitalization. Because these delays are associated with longer hospital stays and potentially poorer health outcomes, interventions that reduce delays seem especially important.\r"

Selenium had a significant augmentative effect on the serum concentrations of IgG2 and IgG4, but not of IgG1 and IgG3. This effect was not related to age, as among children over the age of 6 years the serum concentrations of IgG2 and IgG4 had decreased significantly one year after the treatment had been stopped. This study suggests that selenium has an immunoregulatory effect, which might be of importance in both basic research and clinical practice.\r"

  ".W": "The beneficial effect of ethane 1-hydroxy-1, 1-diphosphonate (EHDP) in restoring the inhibition of bone formation in cases of acute uranium intoxication is presented. Bone formation was studied histomorphometrically in a model of alveolar bone healing. After tooth extraction, 40 rats were divided into 4 groups that received (1) no further treatment, (2) 10 daily intraperitoneal injections of 7.5 mg/kg of body weight of EHDP, (3) an intraperitoneal injection of 2.0 mg/kg of body weight of uranyl nitrate, and (4) the same treatment as was provided rats in groups 2 and 3. The results showed that the healing of bone did not occur in exposed animals, whereas healing in EHDP-treated exposed animals did not differ from that of nonexposed controls. This effect might result from a blocking and/or competitive action of EHDP and/or the stimulation that EHDP elicits at the doses and in the administration period studied.\r"

DESIGN--Randomised trial of patients stratified by site of primary tumour and presence or absence of lymph node metastases. Follow up of patients after treatment. SETTING--Department of clinical oncology, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh. PATIENTS--165 Patients with untreated, histologically proved squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, or hypopharynx. All patients completed treatment, and no patient was lost to follow up. INTERVENTION--Treatment with either neutrons or photons. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Disease state and morbidity (scored with the system of the European Organisation for Research on Treatment of Cancer) at each visit during follow up. RESULTS--Of the 165 patients, 85 were randomised to receive neutron treatment and 80 to receive photon treatment. Minimum follow up was five years. Local control of cancer remained similar in the two groups, being achieved in 37 (44%) patients after neutron treatment and 36 (45%) after photon treatment. Five year and actuarial 10 year survival rates were 24% (20/85) and 14% respectively in the group treated with neutrons and 34% (27/80) and 30% respectively in the group treated with photons. Five year survival rates without local disease were 19% (16/85) and 30% (24/80) respectively. Necrosis was more common after neutron treatment than after photon treatment. Seven patients in the neutron group who developed necrosis died whereas no deaths were associated with photon treatment. CONCLUSION--Rates of long term local control were similar in the two groups. Necrosis related to radiation was more common in patients treated with neutrons, and the mortality related to treatment was significantly higher in these patients.\r"

  ".U": "91106074\r", 
  ".W": "1. The kidney taken from a rat rendered nephrotic by exposure to puromycin aminonucleoside retains sodium abnormally when perfused in isolation and has an abnormally low vascular resistance (J. D. Firth et al., Clin. Sci. 1989; 76, 387-95). In this study the relation of oxygen consumption to sodium reabsorption has been examined in the isolated nephrotic organ, which has also been exposed to a variety of natriuretic agents and to the effect of inhibition of metabolism by cooling, in an attempt to discern the transport process, or processes, responsible for abnormal tubular handling of sodium. In addition, the effects of three endogenous vasoconstrictors, noradrenaline, angiotensin II and endothelin, on the function of the isolated nephrotic kidney have been examined. 2. The ratio of mol of sodium reabsorbed by the tubules of the isolated nephrotic kidney to mol of oxygen consumed was reduced in comparison with the control kidney (means +/- SEM): 9.22 +/- 0.97 versus 15.43 +/- 1.55 (P less than 0.002). 3. In the presence of ouabain (1 mmol/l), acetazolamide (1 mmol/l), frusemide (200 mumol/l), the combination of these three agents together, hydroflumethiazide (100 mumol/l), benzamil (100 nmol/l) or atrial natriuretic peptide (1000 pmol/l), a lesser increment in sodium excretion was induced in the isolated nephrotic kidney than in the control kidney and the nephrotic organ continued to excrete less sodium in both absolute and fractional terms. 4. This suggests that enhanced tubular sodium reabsorption in the isolated nephrotic kidney does not depend upon abnormally increased activity of the Na+/K(+)-adenosine triphosphatase, bicarbonate-dependent sodium transport, Na+/K+/2Cl- co-transport, electrically neutral proportionate reabsorption of sodium and chloride (distal tubule), epithelial sodium channel (distal tubule) or atrial natriuretic peptide-sensitive sodium transport processes. 5. When isolated nephrotic kidneys and normal kidneys were cooled to 8-10 degrees C the handling of sodium became virtually identical in the two groups. On re-warming to 37 degrees C, the original differences in sodium handling between nephrotic and control kidneys were restored. This implies that the mechanism responsible for the abnormal tendency to retain sodium is temperature-sensitive; as yet it remains otherwise undefined. 6. The sensitivity of the renal vessels to noradrenaline, angiotension II and endothelin, as judged by the percentage reduction in perfusate flow rate produced by a given concentration of any of these agents, was not substantially altered in the nephrotic kidney compared with the control kidney. Increase in vascular tone was not associated with amelioration of the tendency of the isolated nephrotic organ to retain sodium. Increasing concentrations of angiotensin II caused the filtration rate to increase in the nephrotic kidney. This effect was unexpected: in the control preparation, as anticipated, angiotensin II caused the filtration rate to decrease.\r"

After 15 days of galactose feeding, however, there was a significant increase of 140% (+/- 12%) in the amount of aldose reductase messenger RNA in the lens epithelial cells as compared with controls (P = less than 0.001). 4.

  ".U": "91106085\r", 
  ".W": "1. A low protein diet prevents the development of proteinuria and glomerular damage in adriamycin experimental nephrosis without affecting renal haemodynamics. In this study the hypothesis was tested as to whether protein restriction is able to modulate the purine metabolic cycle and related enzymes such as xanthine oxidase, one of the putative effectors of adriamycin nephrotoxicity. 2. Renal activities of xanthine oxidase and purine nucleoside phosphorylase were markedly depressed in adriamycin-treated rats fed a 9% casein (low protein) diet compared with the group fed a 22% casein (normal protein) diet both 1 day after adriamycin administration and at the time of appearance of heavy proteinuria (day 15), whereas the activity of renal adenosine deaminase was unchanged. 3. The concentrations of the metabolic substrates of xanthine oxidase, i.e. hypoxanthine and xanthine, were constantly lower in renal homogenates of rats fed a low protein diet compared with those on a normal protein diet. In urine, uric acid, the product of hypoxanthine-xanthine transformation, was lower 1 day after adriamycin injection in protein-restricted rats compared with the group on a normal protein diet which showed a marked increase in its excretion. At the same time, the urinary efflux of adenosine 5'-monophosphate, which is the precursor nucleotide of the above-mentioned nucleosides and bases, was very high in rats fed a low protein diet, whereas it was absent in the group on a normal protein diet. 4. The progressive increment in proteinuria of glomerular origin (i.e. increased excretion of albumin and transferrin) typical of adriamycin-treated rats fed a normal protein diet was inhibited in the protein-restricted animals, which were normoproteinuric on day 10 and were only slightly proteinuric on day 15. 5. Like protein restriction, the pharmacological suppression of renal xanthine oxidase by dietary tungstate and the scavenging by dimethylthiourea of the putative free radical deriving from the action of xanthine oxidase, were associated with a similar (quantitative and qualitative) inhibition of glomerular proteinuria. 6. These data demonstrate that dietary protein restriction is associated with a block in purine metabolism within the kidney due to a marked reduction in the activities of two main enzymes of the cycle, i.e. purine nucleoside phosphorylase and xanthine oxidase, the latter being a putative effector of adriamycin nephrotoxicity. The partial reduction of proteinuria induced by a low protein diet is quantitatively and qualitatively comparable with the reduction induced by the specific block of renal xanthine oxidase or by the scavenging of OH.deriving from hypoxanthine and xanthine transformation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Patients randomly received nitroglycerin (n = 7) or a placebo (n = 7). No significant changes were observed after the administration of the placebo. In contrast, transdermal nitroglycerin caused a significant reduction in portal pressure, as evaluated by measurements of the portal venous pressure gradient (-22%, p less than 0.01). The reduction of portal pressure was due to a decrease in the portal venous pressure, with no changes in the free hepatic venous pressure. Despite the fall in portal pressure, the hepatic blood flow was maintained. These findings suggest that transdermal nitroglycerin could be potentially useful in the treatment of portal hypertension associated with cirrhosis.\r"

Fifty five liver biopsy samples were studied: 11 from patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis (paraffin-embedded) and 44 from patients with chronic hepatitis non-A, non-B (21 paraffin-embedded; 25 fresh frozen). Thirty three (75%) of the non-A, non-B cases were positive for hepatitis C virus antibodies. Approximately 1 to 10 ng of DNA was extracted from the paraffin-embedded tissue and amplified using oligonucleotide (23-mer) primers specific for the S gene (positions 261 to 692). The beta-globin gene was used as an internal control for sensitivity because this is a single copy gene and allows for relative quantification. In each of the chronic hepatitis B livers, the expected 432-base-pair amplification product for hepatitis B virus DNA and beta-globin gene product were both detected. On the other hand, in the 21 paraffin-embedded chronic hepatitis non-A, non-B livers, no hepatitis B virus DNA was detected, although beta-globin gene was observed in all. Furthermore, in all 25 frozen non-A, non-B livers, beta-globin gene was observed, but no hepatitis B virus band was seen. The limit of detection of hepatitis B virus DNA by this method was estimated to be one genomic copy of hepatitis B virus DNA per cell.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The time course of DNA synthesis in cultured hepatocytes showed that peaks of the incorporation of 3H-thymidine were observed at 60 hr and 82 hr after plating. Labeling indices of the cells indicated that almost half the cells were labeled with 3H-thymidine in the periods 48 to 72 hr and 72 to 96 hr after plating. In addition, about 20% of the hepatocytes in culture initiated a second round of the cell cycle between 48 and 96 hr in culture, as demonstrated by the use of continuous treatments with 3H-thymidine and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine. Furthermore, by day 4 of culture, about 40% and 15% of metaphases resulted from a second and third round of cell division, respectively. The cultured hepatocytes on day 5 stained with albumin immunocytochemically, and the activity of tyrosine aminotransferase was induced by dexamethasone and glucagon on day 3. In addition, electron micrographs revealed that dividing cells not only had many characteristics of liver mitochondria and bile canaliculus-like structures, but many also contained a few large peroxisomes with internal crystalline nucleoids.\r"

Steady-state UDP-glucuronosyltransferase mRNA levels were determined by Northern blot analysis or in situ hybridization of tissue sections using a 30-mer oligonucleotide specific for the 3-methylcholanthrene-inducible UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (which is active toward 4-nitrophenol) or a double-stranded cDNA probe specific for androsterone-UDP-glucuronosyltransferase. For 3-methylcholanthrene-inducible UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, the mRNA level was very low in control liver; there was a 15-fold increase after 3-methylcholanthrene treatment. This mRNA was present at relatively high concentration in the kidney and there was a threefold increase after 3-methylcholanthrene administration. In livers with preneoplastic nodules 1 mo after cessation of carcinogen administration, this mRNA concentration was approximately 15 times greater than in control liver. Similar changes in the level of the 3-methylcholanthrene-inducible UDP-glucuronosyltransferase were also observed by in situ hybridization of tissue sections. Immunocytochemical studies using an antiserum that recognizes the 3-methylcholanthrene-inducible UDP-glucuronosyltransferase showed a marked increase in the concentration of this isoform in preneoplastic nodules compared with the adjacent nonnodular liver.\r"

No differences between groups in prerun values for heart rate (HR), plasma osmolality (OSM), antidiuretic hormone (ADH), aldosterone (ALDO), atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), or plasma renin activity (PRA) were found. Renal and urinary measurements were also similar between groups before the marathon. After 10 km of running, both groups had significant increases in HR, ALDO, ANF, and PRA, while OSM, Na+, and ADH remained unchanged from prerun values. The increase in plasma ANF concentrations at this point was significantly greater in the MA subjects compared with the Y (mean increase 104.1 vs. 42.8 pg/ml, respectively; P less than 0.01). Immediate postmarathon values for OSM, ADH, and Na+ were significantly higher than initial values in both groups, while HR, PRA, and ALDO continued to increase above the elevated levels found at 10 km. ANF values immediately postmarathon remained higher than prerun concentrations but were significantly reduced from those obtained at 10 km. In contrast, HR continued to rise until the completion of the run. These data are consistent with recent reports of an exaggerated ANF response in older subjects in response to central blood volume expansion.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously shown that phosgene markedly increases lung weight gain and pulmonary vascular permeability in rabbits. The current experiments were designed to determine whether cyclooxygenase- and lipoxygenase-derived mediators contribute to the phosgene induced lung injury. We exposed rabbits to phosgene (1,500 ppm/min), killed the animals 30 min later, and then perfused the lungs with a saline buffer for 90 min. Phosgene markedly increased lung weight gain, did not appear to increase the synthesis of cyclooxygenase metabolites, but increased 10-fold the synthesis of lipoxygenase products. Pre- or posttreatment with indomethacin decreased thromboxane and prostacyclin levels without affecting leukotriene synthesis and partially reduced the lung weight gain caused by phosgene. Methylprednisolone pretreatment completely blocked the increase in leukotriene synthesis and lung weight gain. Posttreatment with 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA), a nonmetabolized competitive inhibitor of arachidonic acid metabolism, or the leukotriene receptor blockers, FPL 55712 and LY 171883, also dramatically reduced the lung weight gain caused by phosgene. These results suggest that lipoxygenase products contribute to the phosgene-induced lung damage. Because phosgene exposure did not increase cyclooxygenase synthesis or pulmonary arterial pressure, we tested whether phosgene affects the lung's ability to generate or to react to thromboxane. Infusing arachidonic acid increased thromboxane synthesis to the same extent in phosgene-exposed lungs as in control lungs; however, phosgene exposure significantly reduced pulmonary vascular reactivity to thromboxane but not to angiotension II and KCl.\r"

  ".W": "During exercise, less additional CO2 is stored per kilogram body weight in children than in adults, suggesting that children have a smaller capacity to store metabolically produced CO2. To examine this, tracer doses of [13C]bicarbonate were administered orally to 10 children (8-12 yr) and 12 adults (25-40 yr) at rest. Washout of 13CO2 in breath was analyzed to estimate recovery of tracer, mean residence time (MRT), and size of CO2 stores. CO2 production (VCO2) was also measured breath by breath using gas exchange techniques. Recovery did not differ significantly between children [73 +/- 13% (SD)] and adults (71 +/- 9%). MRT was shorter in children (42 +/- 7 min) compared with adults (66 +/- 15 min, P less than 0.001). VCO2 per kilogram was higher in the children (5.4 +/- 0.9 ml.min-1.kg-1) compared with adults (3.1 +/- 0.5, P less than 0.0001). Tracer estimate of CO2 production was correlated to VCO2 (r = 0.86, P less than 0.0001) and when corrected for mean recovery accurately predicted the VCO2 to within 3 +/- 14%. There was no difference in the estimate of resting CO2 stores between children (222 +/- 52 ml CO2/kg) and adults (203 +/- 42 ml CO2/kg). We conclude that orally administered [13C]bicarbonate can be used to assess CO2 transport dynamics. The data do not support the hypothesis of lower CO2 stores under resting conditions in children.\r"

Minute ventilation (VE), carbon dioxide production rate (VCO2), and arterial blood chemistry were measured at rest and while subjects exercised on a stationary bicycle. Four of the subjects performed a similar experiment while exercising on a static rowing machine. Within each subject, arterial potassium concentration ([K+]a) was linearly related to VCO2 and VE during exercise. The slope of the relationship between [K+]a and VCO2 was similar in the cycling and rowing experiments. This implies that the absorption of potassium by resting muscle does not significantly limit the arterial hyperkalemia seen during exercise. When VE, VCO2, and [K+]a were measured 1 and 5 min after the end of cycling there was no correlation, whereas VE continued to be closely correlated with VCO2. The relationship demonstrated between change in [K+]a and VCO2 in these experiments is compatible with change of [K+]a acting as a respiratory signal during exercise but not during recovery from exercise in humans.\r"

Arterial PCO2 (PaCO2) was assessed in 10 normal ponies during low (1.8 mph 7% or 17% grade) or moderate (6 mph 7% grade) treadmill exercise. After control studies, bilateral spinal ablation (SA) of the dorsolateral sulcus and dorsolateral funiculus at L2 was performed in seven ponies. In normal ponies within the first 90 s of exercise, PaCO2 initially decreased 2.7, 4.1, and 5.2 Torr below rest at the three work loads, respectively (P less than 0.05). PaCO2 thereafter increased toward resting levels but remained 1.1, 2.9, and 4.9 Torr below rest during the steady state of exercise (P less than 0.05). One month post-SA, PaCO2 at the exercise onset decreased 1.5, 2.3, and 5.2 Torr and in the steady state was 0.7, 1.9 and 4.9 Torr below rest at the three work loads, respectively. The changes in PaCO2 from rest to exercise (delta PaCO2) were calculated for each pony in the rest to work transition and between rest and steady-state exercise and then averaged for each group of ponies. After SA, delta PaCO2's were significantly less than pre-SA only in the rest to work transition at the low work loads (P less than 0.05). No differences were found in steady-state delta PaCO2's. The modest attenuation of the exercise hypocapnia at the lower workloads in SA ponies suggests that spinal afferent information does play some role in the exercise hyperpnea in awake ponies. Our data probably underestimate this role because our SA surgery is only a partial deafferentation.\r"

Hypoxia was induced in the presence (COI + Hypox, n = 6) or absence (Hypox, n = 6) of cyclooxygenase inhibition (COI) with indomethacin or meclofenamate. Hypoxic ventilation reduced blood PO2 from 143 to 25-29 Torr without a change in PCO2. During hypoxia a capillary filtration coefficient (Kf) was obtained gravimetrically as an index of vascular permeability to water. In COI + Hypox, pulmonary arterial pressure (Pa) increased from 11.5 +/- 0.7, post-COI normoxia, to a peak of 22.1 +/- 2.3 during hypoxia (P less than 0.01) without a change in capillary pressure (Pc). In contrast, hypoxia changed neither Pa nor Pc in Hypox relative to an untreated normoxic control group (Normox, n = 6, P greater than 0.05). Kfs (means +/- SE in ml.min-1.Torr-1.100 g-1) for Normox (0.070 +/- 0.014), Hypox (0.082 +/- 0.024), and COI + Hypox (0.057 +/- 0.017) did not differ from one another (P greater than 0.05). Although COI markedly enhanced the pressor response to acute alveolar hypoxia, hypoxia increased neither Pc nor vascular permeability regardless of COI.\r"

In the presence of Cl-, heptanol decreased short-circuit current (Isc) and total transepithelial resistance (Rt). However, in the absence of Cl- in the mucosal bath, heptanol increased Rt, although it retained the same inhibitory effect on Isc. When transepithelial active Na+ transport was blocked by amiloride, heptanol had no effect on Isc whether or not Cl- was present, whereas it decreased the shunt resistance (Rs) only in the presence of Cl- in the mucosal bath. Moreover, this effect of heptanol on Rs was significantly smaller in the presence of diphenylamine-2-carboxylate (DPC), a known Cl- channel blocker. Pressure also decreased Isc through inhibition of active Na+ transport, but it increased Rs. When heptanol and pressure were applied together, their inhibitory effects on Isc were additive, but their effects on Rs were antagonistic. Furthermore, when a transepithelial Cl- current was produced by reducing the Cl- concentration of the serosal bath, heptanol stimulated this current, which was reversibly inhibited by pressure or DPC addition to the mucosal bath. When the heptanol-stimulated Cl- current was first inhibited by pressure, subsequent DPC addition had less or no effect. These results suggest that one site of an antagonistic interaction of heptanol and pressure in toad skin is an apical membrane Cl- conductance.\r"

  ".U": "91107519\r", 
  ".W": "We investigated the effect of increasing the synaptic concentration of catecholamines released from central pathways on breathing movements and electrocortical (ECoG) activity in fetal sheep in utero. In 11 trials (9 fetuses) intravenous infusion of the noradrenergic uptake inhibitor desipramine (DMI) resulted in an initial increase in the incidence of breathing movements from 47.8 +/- 2.2%/h to a maximum of 77.9 +/- 5.5%/h (P less than 0.05) followed by a subsequent decrease to 18.8 +/- 2.7%/h (P less than 0.05), which was associated with a decrease in the incidence of low-voltage ECoG activity. Mean breath amplitude also increased after DMI infusion from 5.8 +/- 0.2 mmHg to a peak of 8.9 +/- 0.9 mmHg (P less than 0.05). In five fetuses, intravenous injection of the alpha 1-receptor antagonist prazosin 30 min after the start of the DMI infusion blocked the increase of breath amplitude observed when DMI was given alone. Intracisternal infusion of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA, which causes an initial displacement of transmitter stores followed by a neurotoxic action) in six fetuses caused an increase in mean breath amplitude from 6.6 +/- 0.3 mmHg (control) to 22.3 +/- 5.5 mmHg (P less than 0.05) and a prolonged episode of breathing movements (168.5 +/- 47.2 min). The incidence of low-voltage ECoG activity was also increased significantly. A second infusion of 6-OHDA, 2 days after the first, had no effect on breathing movements or ECoG activities. The two treatments with 6-OHDA also resulted in a significant reduction in the response to intravenous infusion of DMI, indicating that endogenous release of norepinephrine had been reduced by the neurotoxin. These results suggest that 1) there is normally some tonic release of norepinephrine from central pathways, but this release is insufficient to stimulate sustained fetal breathing, and 2) accumulation in the synaptic cleft of catecholamines from central neurons is able to stimulate fetal breathing and promote low-voltage ECoG activity. Possible mechanisms that normally limit the activity of central catecholamine pathways before birth are discussed.\r"

In agreement with results of earlier studies, PBMC from active VL patients showed a markedly reduced proliferative response and IL-2 and IFN-gamma production, compared with those of healthy controls. The levels of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were within the normal range, but there was a significant decrease in UCHL-1+ cells (helper-inducer), compared with healthy individuals. The inhibited cellular responses, and lymphokine secretion and decreased level of UCHL-1+ cells in the PBMC of the VL patients returned to the normal range after successful chemotherapy. PBMC from active VL patients were fractionated into adherent cells and nonadherent cells, and the non-adherent were further fractionated into UCHL-1+ and UCHL-1- subpopulations. Results from cell depletion and reconstitution experiments suggest that the IL-2 production by nonadherent cells stimulated with PHA was inhibited by adherent cells, but the IL-2 production by nonadherent cells in response to specific Ag was not. In contrast, UCHL-1- cells seem to mediate the inhibition of Ag-driven IL-2 production by nonadherent cells but not mitogen-stimulated IL-2 secretion by nonadherent cells. Ag-specific IL-2 production principally involves UCHL-1+ cells.\r"

Among 85 mice screened, eight mice were transgene-positive. The transgene in seven of eight founders was germline-transmitted. FACS analysis and immunohistochemical studies with DQ beta-specific mAb demonstrated that DQ beta molecules in association with mouse A alpha f molecules are expressed on peripheral mononuclear cells, spleen cells, and in thymic medulla. More interestingly, V beta 11-, V beta 5.1-, and V beta 5.2-bearing T cells, but not V beta 8.2-bearing T cells, were clonally deleted in the H-2E-negative but DQ beta+ progeny of two selected founders (260-23 and 258-10). The deletion was found to take place intrathymically during the transition stage from immature to mature thymocyte development. We postulate that although human DQ genes are more homologous to mouse H-2A genes, A alpha f/DQ beta hybrid molecules may possess the same self-peptide- (or superantigen)-presenting epitope as E alpha/E beta molecules critical for deletion of V beta 11-, V beta 5.1-, and V beta 5.2-bearing T cells in thymus. Our results also confirm the previous findings that accessory molecules on thymocytes such as CD4 may be involved in thymic selection, and further suggest that an interaction of mousE CD4 and mouse A alpha chain is required for the clonal deletion.\r"

  ".W": "MHC class II induction by cytokines has been suggested to play a major role in the initiation and propagation of immune and autoimmune processes. TNF-alpha has been found both to enhance and also to inhibit IFN-gamma-induced MHC class II expression. In the present studies, the effect of TNF-alpha on IFN-gamma induced MHC class II expression was tested in various cell lines. On the basis of the data, we propose that, depending on the stage of differentiation and maturation of the cells, TNF-alpha might synergize or antagonize the affects of IFN-gamma on the regulation of MHC class II expression. Thus, in immature cells such as HL-60 or THP-1, TNF-alpha enhances IFN-gamma-induced class II expression. However, when differentiation was induced in these cells by TPA or IFN-gamma, the additive effect of TNF-alpha on the IFN-gamma induced DR expression was eliminated. Furthermore, TNF-alpha down-regulates the IFN-gamma-induced class II expression in differentiated cells such as human skin fibroblasts or activated macrophages. In bone marrow cells induced to differentiate in vitro, TNF-alpha decreased the IFN-gamma-induced MHC class II expression in a maturation-dependent fashion. These results provide a rational explanation for the conflicting reports regarding the effect of TNF-alpha on IFN-gamma-induced class II expression. But more importantly they may be relevant to the biologic function of TNF-alpha. Thus, we show that TNF-alpha-treated mice have reduced level of Ia expression on peritoneal macrophages and in vivo treatment with TNF-alpha antagonizes the ability of IFN-gamma to induce class II expression on these macrophages.\r"

The resulting ability to react with and cross-link two different Ag makes these molecules a novel tool for application in biology and medicine. Intact bispecific mAb can be made only by biologic means, e.g., by fusion of two established hybridomas. Appropriate assembly of bispecific mAb by these hybrid cells depends on H = L chain behavior: strong preferential homologous H-L pairing would benefit the yield of bispecific antibodies. We have analyzed the Ig species produced by eight hybrid hybridomas (quadromas). Quadroma-produced IgG was fractionated and characterized for H and L chain content. The Ag reactivities were verified by using ELISA and immunofluorescence. Preferential homologous pairing was seen only with a minority of H-L chain pairs; L chains associated on average in a random fashion with H chains. This indicates that in the B cells from which the parental hybridomas were obtained, no strong selection had occurred on H-L recombination. Our results extend recent biochemical competitive H-L reassociation experiments, where on average an at random association of L chains with H chains was found; evidently this random association occurs in our biologic system as well. For the biologic production of bispecific antibodies this means that only in a small number of cases the \"ideal\" producer will be met. From the viewpoint of generation of antibody diversity, our results favor a large freedom for combinatorial binding of H and L chains during B cell ontogeny.\r"

  ".W": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa cytotoxin, a transmembrane pore-forming protein, causes an increase in pulmonary microvascular permeability with subsequent lung edema formation, possibly related to the induction of arachidonic acid (AA) lipoxygenase products. To investigate this, isolated rabbit lungs were perfused with cytotoxin-containing buffer (6.5 and 13 micrograms of toxin/ml). A severalfold increase in the capillary filtration coefficient was induced, both preceded and accompanied by a marked time- (15-60 min) and dose-dependent release of cysteinyl leukotrienes (LT), LTB4, and 5-, 12-, and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) into the lung perfusate. In the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, corresponding AA-derived products were detected; the total sum of HETEs surpassed that of cysteinyl LTs in this compartment. The lipoxygenase inhibitors AA861 (10 microM) and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (100 microM) and EGTA (5 mM) suppressed the intravascular and alveolar liberation of all 5-lipoxygenase-derived AA metabolites, paralleled by a marked reduction and retardation of microvascular permeability increase (AA861). It thus seems that Pseudomonas cytotoxin induces generation of LTs and HETEs in rabbit lungs that may contribute to the development of pulmonary microvascular injury evoked by this bacterial agent.\r"

Seventy-two hours after the last dose of VP 16, histologically tumor-free and 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC; 100 mumol/L)-purged autologous bone marrow (ABMT) was infused. Acute toxicities included grade 3 to 4 oral mucositis, grade 1 to 2 diarrhea, and fevers. No patient required infusion of unpurged reserve autografts. At ABMT, 16 patients (group I) were progression-free 6.5 months to 14 months (median, 9 months) from diagnosis: seven remain progression-free 20 months to 46 months (median, 39 months) off therapy, six relapsed 4 months to 17 months post-ABMT, and three died of toxicity (candidiasis, metabolic derangement, and venoocclusive disease [VOD]). The event-free survival of group I patients is 44% at 24 months post-ABMT. Nine patients (group II) were in second remission at ABMT, including three who had relapsed after other transplant procedures: two are progression-free 24 months and 41 months off therapy, four relapsed 3 months to 12 months post-ABMT, and three died of toxicity (aspergillosis, hemorrhagic cystitis, VOD). Only one of 10 relapses involved a primary site, suggesting a beneficial effect of local radiation. In terms of survival or toxicity, an advantage for melphalan or thiotepa was not evident. Regimens such as this may prolong the survival of selected patients with poor-risk neuroblastoma, but concerns over late relapses and toxicity mandate continuing efforts to devise alternative, less risky, and more clearly beneficial approaches for definitive ablation of neuroblastoma.\r"

  ".W": "The dose-limiting toxicity in two separate phase I trials of the high-dose single agents ifosfamide and carboplatin was renal insufficiency at 18 g/m2 and hepatic and ototoxicity at 2,400 mg/m2, respectively. In this phase I study, 16 adults were treated with ifosfamide at 75% of the single-agent maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) (12 g/m2) and escalating doses of carboplatin (400 to 1,600 mg/m2) to determine the nonhematologic dose-limiting toxicity and the maximum-tolerated dose of the combination. Both drugs as well as mesna for uroprotection were given by continuous infusion over 4 days with an additional day of mesna (total dose per course, 15 g/m2). Autologous bone marrow support was stipulated for subsequent dose levels once granulocytes remained less than 500/microL for more than 14 days in two of three to five patients entered at a given dose level. Autologous bone marrow support was used at doses above the 400 mg/m2 carboplatin dose level. At the maximum-tolerated dose level of 1,600 mg/m2 of carboplatin, renal toxicity precluded further dose escalation. Of the five patients entered at this dose level, reversible creatinine elevation greater than 2 mg/dL (median peak, 2.6 mg/dL) was observed in three patients, and irreversible renal failure occurred in an additional patient (peak creatinine, 6.9 mg/dL. Transient gross hematuria appeared more common with the combination than with ifosfamide alone. Two patients developed severe somnolence and confusion associated with a rising creatinine. There were two complete (CRs) and four partial responses (PRs) in 14 heavily pretreated assessable patients (including four partial or complete responses in eight assessable patients with advanced refractory sarcoma, and one CR in two patients with germ cell carcinoma). Carboplatin and ifosfamide appear to have overlapping renal toxicity. Nevertheless, carboplatin and ifosfamide can be combined at 80% and 75% of the single-agent maximum-tolerated doses, respectively, with acceptable nonhematologic toxicity. Ifosfamide and carboplatin are an attractive core combination for further studies in the treatment of sarcoma, germ cell, ovarian, and lung carcinomas.\r"

These are histologically benign tumors, and distinction between them is frequently not made by clinicians. To determine if there is a correlation between the histological pattern of benign spinal nerve sheath tumors and the type of neurofibromatosis, the clinical and pathological features of these tumors (86 surgical specimens and five autopsies) in 68 patients were reviewed. The patients were classified into one of four categories: neurofibromatosis type 1, neurofibromatosis type 2, uncertain, or sporadic. The diagnostic criteria used for neurofibromatosis types 1 and 2 were established by the National Institutes of Health. Patients who did not fulfill criteria for either neurofibromatosis type 1 or 2 but who had multiple nervous system tumors or other stigmata of neurofibromatosis were designated \"uncertain.\" Spinal nerve sheath tumors were considered sporadic in 42 cases (40 schwannomas and two neurofibromas). In the 14 patients with neurofibromatosis type 1, all spinal nerve sheath tumors were neurofibromas. In six of the seven patients with neurofibromatosis type 2, all spinal nerve sheath tumors were schwannomas. One patient with neurofibromatosis type 2 had a spinal nerve sheath schwannoma and a tumor with features of both tumor types. The authors conclude that spinal nerve sheath tumors in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 are neurofibromas. In contrast, spinal nerve sheath tumors occurring in neurofibromatosis type 2 or sporadically are most frequently schwannomas. The distinct histological features of these tumors may reflect different pathogenetic mechanisms even though they arise at identical sites in neurofibromatosis types 1 and 2.\r"

Autologous platelets were labeled either in saline with 111In-oxine or in plasma with 111In-tropolone. Mean platelet lifespan was estimated by fitting the disappearance curve of platelets from the circulation to the multiple hit and other mathematical models. The in vivo distribution of platelets was quantitatively imaged with a scintillation camera. The in vivo recovery of 111In-oxine and 111In-tropolone did not differ, and the mean platelet lifespan was also similar (111In-oxine: 230 +/- 29 hr; 111In-tropolone: 226 +/- 13 hr). At equilibrium (90 min after reinjection of labeled platelets) and at the end of platelet lifespan, 111In-oxine and 111In-tropolone radioactivities in the spleen and liver were similar. These results demonstrate that the results of kinetics measured with 111In-oxine or 111In-tropolone do not differ significantly.\r"

A significantly higher 2-[18F]FDOPA uptake by B16-F1 than by B16-F10 and a reverse relationship for the uptake of [14C] 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose and [3H]thymidine were observed 1 hr postinjection. F1-to-F10 ratios of both the 2-[18F]FDOPA uptake and the acid-insoluble radioactivity increased to about 5 at 6 hr, which paralleled the melanin content. FM3A mammary carcinoma showed a 2-[18F]FDOPA uptake similar to the B16-F10 but without the acid-insoluble radioactivity. With D,L-DOPA loading, a 55% decreased uptake by FM3A 1 hr postinjection was significantly greater than the 20% reduction in both melanomas. O-Methylated 2-[18F]FDOPA was a predominant acid-soluble metabolite in all tumors. Whole-body autoradiography discriminated the two melanomas clearly. 2-[18F]FDOPA may be a promising tracer for the selective imaging of melanogenesis.\r"

Inhibition of basal PRL secretion was highly correlated with the drug concentration between 30 microM to 1 mM quinidine; 50% inhibition of basal secretion occurred at 300 microM and at this concentration quinidine completely blocked PRL secretion stimulated by TRH, K+ and hyposmolarity. Significant inhibition of TRH-induced PRL secretion was produced by 15 microM quinidine, a concentration equivalent to that in plasma during standard antiarrhythmic therapy with quinidine in humans. In rats in vivo, a single injection of 2 mg i.p. of quinidine gluconate/100 g b.wt. 1 hr before TRH injection significantly inhibited induced TSH secretion by 15%. Quinidine inhibition of secretion may be caused by blocking depolarization of the cell membrane, thus depressing voltage-gated Ca++ channels and preventing a rise in intracellular Ca++ release.\r"

Analysis of quantal release using nerve-muscle preparations taken from rats exhibiting neuromuscular weakness demonstrated a decrease in quantal content of evoked end-plate potentials (EPP), a decrease in the frequency of spontaneously occurring miniature end-plate potentials (MEPP) and a prolongation of rise and decay times for MEPPs. This latter effect is also observed in muscles taken from rats after one large dose of DTB; in which no weakness is observed. Moreover, an increase in the incidence of abnormally large amplitude MEPPs has also been observed after both acute and chronic treatment of rats with DTB. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether the observed prolongation of rise and decay times for the spontaneous synaptic events observed after exposure to DTB can be attributed to a generalized slowing of all synaptic events or whether DTB causes an increase in a distinct population of abnormal synaptic events. End-plate currents and miniature end-plate currents (MEPC) were recorded, using two microelectrode voltage clamp, from hemidiaphragm preparations of rats after acute administration of 25 mg/kg and chronic treatment with 1 mg/kg/day (7-8 days) DTB. Mean MEPC amplitude calculated for all MEPCs was unaffected by DTB treatment; however there was an increase in the incidence of giant MEPCs after both acute and chronic treatments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The 15-hydroperoxy metabolite of arachidonic acid (15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid; 15-HPETE) and its hydroxyderivative 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) are known to evoke contractions in a variety of isolated blood vessels. In this study, segments of isolated canine coronary, splenic, femoral and renal arteries were exposed to 15-HETE and 15-HPETE; both metabolites induced small basal relaxations followed by contractions at higher concentrations. The contractions were augmented by indomethacin and could be blocked by the thromboxane A2 receptor antagonists BM13177 and BM13505. In vessels in which the tone was raised with prostaglandin F2 alpha, both 15-lipoxygenase metabolites evoked marked relaxations, which were in part dependent on the presence of the endothelium. When the segments were contracted with norepinephrine or increased KCl concentration, 15-HETE and 15-HPETE induced relaxations followed by additional contractions. The relaxations to the fatty acid derivatives were not inhibited by BM13505. In tissues without endothelium, the relaxations to 15-HETE and 15-HPETE were completely blocked by indomethacin; in tissues with endothelium, indomethacin only partly inhibited the relaxations to 15-HETE, whereas the drug did not interfere with the relaxing effects of 15-HPETE. Our experiments indicate that in isolated canine arteries 15-lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid can 1) induce contractions, most likely by direct activation of thromboxane A2 receptors on smooth muscle cells, and 2) evoke relaxations that are in part endothelium dependent; the endothelium-independent part of the relaxations was inhibited by indomethacin. Thus, the relaxations to these metabolites seem to occur via the release of an endothelium-derived relaxing factor and via production of a cyclooxygenase metabolite.\r"

  ".W": "Pinacidil, a potassium channel opener (PCO), relaxes vascular smooth muscle by increasing potassium ion membrane conductance, thereby causing membrane hyperpolarization. PCOs also act on cardiac muscle to decrease action potential duration (APD) selectively. To examine the enantiomeric selectivity of pinacidil, the stereoisomers of pinacidil (a 4-pyridylcyanoguanidine) and its 3-pyridyl isomer (LY222675) were synthesized and studied in canine Purkinje fibers and cephalic veins. The (-)-enantiomers of both pinacidil and LY222675 were more potent in relaxing phenylephrine-contracted cephalic veins and decreasing APD than were their corresponding (+)-enantiomers. The EC50 values for (-)-pinacidil and (-)-LY222675 in relaxing cephalic veins were 0.44 and 0.09 microM, respectively. In decreasing APD, the EC50 values were 3.2 microM for (-)-pinacidil and 0.43 microM for (-)-LY222675. The eudismic ratio was greater for the 3-pyridyl isomer than for pinacidil in both cardiac (71 vs. 22) and vascular (53 vs. 17) tissues. (-)-LY222675 and (-)-pinacidil (0.1-30 microM) also increased 86Rb efflux from cephalic veins to a greater extent than did their respective optical antipodes. The antidiabetic sulfonylurea, glyburide (1-30 microM), shifted the vascular concentration-response curve of (-)-pinacidil to the right by a similar extent at each inhibitor concentration. Glipizide also antagonized the response to (-)-pinacidil, but was about 1/10 as potent with a maximal shift occurring at 10 and 30 microM. Glyburide antagonized the vascular relaxant effects of 0.3 microM (-)-LY222675 (EC50, 2.3 microM) and reversed the decrease in APD caused by 3 microM (-)-LY222675 (EC50, 1.9 microM). Nitroprusside did not alter 86Rb efflux, and vascular relaxation induced by sodium nitroprusside was unaffected by sulfonylureas. Thus, the enantiomers of the 3-pyridyl isomer of pinacidil demonstrate enhanced stereospecificity in both canine cardiac and vascular tissues compared to the enantiomers of pinacidil. However, the relative selectivity of pinacidil and its 3-pyridyl isomer for cardiac and vascular smooth muscle remains unaltered. Sulfonylureas antagonize the more potent enantiomers in both tissues, supporting the involvement of an ATP-sensitive potassium channel in the action of PCOs; however, antagonism in canine vascular smooth muscle by sulfonylureas does not resemble classical competitive antagonism.\r"

  ".W": "The active and inactive stereoisomers of the serotonin (5-HT2) antagonist, MDL 11,939, were used to examine the relationship between the acute effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on the dopaminergic system and its long-term effects on the serotonergic system. Only the R-(+) stereoisomer of MDL 11,939 both reversed the acute stimulation of striatal dopamine synthesis by MDMA and prevented the deficit in forebrain 5-HT concentrations measured one week later. This acute activation of striatal dopamine synthesis by MDMA is a compensatory response to the carrier-mediated efflux of transmitter as shown by its sensitivity to the dopamine uptake inhibitor, nomifensine. It is suggested that in the absence of this enhanced synthesis, the dopaminergic neuron cannot sustain the carrier-mediated dopamine release which is a prerequisite for the development of MDMA-induced neurotoxicity. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the administration of the dopamine precursor, L-dopa, with MDMA reverses the protective effects of 5-HT2 receptor antagonists.\r"

In this study, we compared the effects of S-nitroso N-acetyl penicillamine (SNAP) and nitroglycerin (NTG) on left ventricular (LV) hemodynamics in congestive heart failure rats. By using a twoday crossover design, stepwise i.v. infusions of SNAP or NTG at 3, 5 and 8 micrograms/min were administered for 30 min each, followed by a dose of 10 micrograms/min over the next 10 h. LV end-diastolic and peak-systolic pressures (LVEDP and LVPSP, respectively) were measured at selected intervals. SNAP and NTG produced maximal LVEDP reductions of 46 and 44%, respectively, at the highest infusion rate. However, at the lower doses, greater reductions of LVEDP were seen with SNAP. NTG had a smaller effect on LVPSP (maximum 6% reduction) than SNAP (maximum reduction of 15%). During the 10-h infusion of NTG, LVEDP gradually returned to base-line values, indicating the development of tolerance, despite relatively constant plasma levels of NTG over the infusion period. Tolerance in LVEDP effects was not observed during the 10-h infusion of SNAP. In the presence of NTG tolerance, rats were still responsive to SNAP (mean reduction of LVEDP 24%), suggesting the absence of cross-tolerance between these two nitrovasodilators. These results suggest that SNAP is a more potent in vivo vasodilator than NTG, has more arterial action than NTG and is less prone to produce LV hemodynamic tolerance.\r"

Associated with this effect were increased prostaglandin E2 and peptidyl leukotriene (LT) synthesis. Unlike preparations from normal rat stomach strips or sham-operated animals, tissue responses and eicosanoid production of ADXSS failed to return to pre-hrIL-1 beta control levels after washout of the interleukin, these effects being abrogated by the lipoxygenase inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid. Additionally, the LTD4 antagonist FPL55712 also prevented the increase in contraction and prostaglandin E2 synthesis caused by hrIL-1 beta without decreasing peptidyl LT synthesis. In separate experiments, hrIL-1 beta failed to increase the recovery of arachidonic acid-induced contractions after aspirin pretreatment in both ADXSS and rat stomach strips. The data indicate that the effects caused by hrIL-1 beta on ADXSS are possibly the result of an exacerbated phospholipase A2 activity particularly inasmuch as increases in cellular cyclooxygenase synthesis are unlikely in this experimental system. It appears likely that a peptidyl LT is involved in this process. Elevation of phospholipase A2 activity by interleukin-1 like drugs may be an important factor limiting the use of these agents as adjuvants particularly in patients with low blood glucocorticoid levels.\r"

Binding site density increased approximately 250% in forebrain membranes during postnatal development but was constant in ventricular membranes. Quantitative autoradiography was used to examine the regional distribution of [3H] glibenclamide binding sites in sections from rat brain, spinal cord and heart. The greatest density of binding in adult brain was found in the substantia nigra and globus pallidus, whereas the other areas displayed heterogenous binding. In agreement with the membrane binding studies, 1-day-old rat brain had significantly fewer [3H]glibenclamide binding sites than adult brain. Additionally, the pattern of distribution of these sites was qualitatively different from that of the adult. In adult rat spinal cord, moderate binding densities were observed in spinal cord gray and displayed a rostral to caudal gradient. In adult rat heart, moderate binding densities were observed and the sites were distributed homogeneously. In conclusion, significant development of [3H]glibenclamide binding sites was seen in the brain but not the heart during postnatal maturation. Furthermore, a heterogeneous distribution of binding sites was observed in both the brain and spinal cord of adult rats.\r"

In the present study effects of nitroglycerin (NG) and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) on [Ca++]; and contraction were studied. 4-AP blocked Kca channels and enhanced the rise of [Ca++]i with oscillation, which led to contraction of the cells. NG activated the Kca channels of 300 picosiemens and inhibited 4-AP-induced contraction and oscillation of [Ca++]i. These results suggest that the vasorelaxant effect of NG involves hyperpolarization of the cell membrane by activating the Kca channels. NG also cause rapid decrease of [Ca++]i during the Ca(++)-mobilization by ATP in Ca-free solution. Similar effects were observed with cyclic GMP, suggesting that the effects of NG on the Kca channels and [Ca++]i were mediated by cyclic GMP.\r"

The release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor can be evoked by a number of distinct subcellular processes, including activation of a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein. The aim of the present study was to determine whether or not the inhibitory effect of phorbol esters on endothelial function was associated with inhibition of the pertussis toxin-sensitive pathway. Rings of canine coronary artery were suspended for isometric tension recording in organ chambers filled with modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution, gassed with 95% O2-5% CO2 (37 degrees C). Treatment of arterial rings with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml) or with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, 10(-8) M) inhibited the endothelium-dependent relaxations produced by UK 14,304, an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, leukotriene C4 or by NaF, a direct activator of G-proteins, but did not affect the endothelium-dependent relaxations produced by bradykinin or by A23187. If the arterial rings were first treated with pertussis toxin, PMA (10(-8) M) no longer inhibited the endothelium-dependent relaxations to NaF. Increasing the concentration of PMA (to 3 X 10(-8) and 10(-7) M) caused inhibition of responses to bradykinin. At higher concentrations, PMA (3 X 10(-7) and 10(-6)) also inhibited the relaxations evoked by A23187. The endothelium-independent relaxations evoked by nitroglycerin were not affected by PMA (10(-8) to 10(-6)).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of those with stages B2 or less, C, C+ and D1 disease 82, 86, 65 and 90%, respectively, had postoperative PSA values of 0.2 ng./ml. or less (when first evaluated 30 or more days postoperatively). At 1 year postoperatively 94% of the stages C and C+ cancer patients treated with adjuvant radiation had PSA levels of 0.2 ng./ml. or less, which was significantly different from those not treated adjuvantly (p = 0.02). This effect of adjuvant radiation on PSA was temporary in the small number of patients with longer followup. Adjuvant orchiectomy for stage D1 lesions resulted in female PSA levels in virtually all cases. This decrease may be misleading and may reflect a direct hormonal effect rather than a decrease in tumor volume. Positive surgical margins did not significantly affect postoperative PSA levels, possibly because of the frequent use of adjuvant treatment.\r"

Preliminary studies suggested that suramin inhibits the growth in vitro of human prostate carcinoma. The present study was performed in order to evaluate the effect of suramin, recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interferon gamma and the combination of suramin plus TNF or interferon gamma on proliferation of PC-3, a human, hormone unresponsive prostate carcinoma cell line. In medium containing 2% fetal calf serum (FCS) suramin, at doses of 10 microM, 30 microM and 100 microM (levels readily achievable in humans) inhibited proliferation of PC-3. TNF, at a concentration of 500 units/ml., induced an approximately 50% inhibition of growth of PC-3. The combination of suramin plus TNF induced a greater inhibition of growth than did either agent alone, even at the low dose of 10 microM suramin. Interferon gamma, 500 units/ml., inhibited PC-3 growth. However, the combination of interferon gamma plus suramin (30 microM) induced less inhibition of proliferation than did interferon gamma alone. These results may serve as a rationale for clinical trials employing the combination of TNF plus suramin in patients with advanced prostate carcinoma.\r"

The IOU was constructed using a ranking method based upon the relative values of anthropometric measurements (weight loss, mid-arm muscle area, mid-arm fat area) and serum protein concentrations (albumin, transferrin). The IOU was derived without reference to the incidence of adverse clinical events and took the form of a boolean cluster. A subsequent prospective longitudinal study evaluated the IOU in 367 general surgical patients at the time of admission to hospital. The results of this study supported the validity of the IOU. There was no association between gender and IOU scores. However, patients with high scores were more likely to be elderly (p less than 0.02), have cancer (p less than 0.001), stay in hospital longer (p less than 0.001), or experience an adverse clinical event after surgery (p less than 0.001). In accord with other published indices of undernutrition, the association between the extent of undernutrition and the incidence of adverse clinical events was only of moderate diagnostic potential (overall accuracy 68%). This study demonstrates that it is possible to derive an index of protein-energy undernutrition that is independent of the incidence of adverse clinical events.\r"

We relied on semiquantitative cultures of the catheter tips, peripheral blood cultures in febrile patients and clinical response to catheter removal to diagnose catheter-related sepsis. The infection rate was 2.5% (4/158) of PACs and 6.5% (14/214) of TLCs (p = 0.124). Colonization rates were 29.1% for PACs and 32% for TLCs. PACs were left in place a significantly shorter length of time than TLCs, 3.1 vs 5.1 days (p less than 0.005). Guidewire exchanges and subclavian vein insertions were associated with a decreased rate of CRS when compared to new insertions and internal jugular vein insertions, respectively. We conclude that pulmonary artery catheters can be used safely for the delivery of hyperalimentation in critically ill patients with no increased risk for catheter-related sepsis compared to triple-lumen catheters. The use of the PAC in this manner allows for the use of a single central venous catheter for the delivery of hyperalimentation and hemodynamic monitoring.\r"

The effect of dietary nucleotides on intestinal weight and length, gut mucosal weight, intestinal protein and DNA contents, and lactase, maltase, and intestinal mucosal activities was assessed in a controlled way. Weanling (21-day-old) rats were separated into two groups of 36, each receiving blindly a basal diet containing glucose polymers (C) or a basal diet with lactose as the main carbohydrate (L) for 15 days. Those fed with L developed a syndrome of chronic diarrhea and malnutrition. Ten rats of each group were sacrificed at that time. The rest of the animals of each group were separated into two subgroups. The first was fed with the C diet and the second with the C diet supplemented with 50 mg/100 g of each of the following nucleotides: AMP, GMP, CMP, UMP, and IMP (CN). Thus the subgroups CC, CN, LC, and LN were formed. Rats were sacrificed after 4 weeks and gut separated into three segments corresponding to duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Analysis of variance was used to compare the effect of diet or segments. DNA and lactase, maltase, and sucrase activities increased in the LN group with respect to LC especially in jejunum and ileum but there were not any differences between CC and CN.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To investigate whether it is due to a decreased availability of the necessary substrates to the mucosa, four groups of 10 Holtzman rats were studied: group 1 received normal saline by intraperitoneal (ip) injection; group 2 also received ip normal saline, then were submitted to stress, by the cold restraint method; group 3 received a solution of arachidonic acid (AA) ip; and group 4 also received ip AA, then were submitted to stress. After sacrifice, the number of gastric ulcerations were counted and specimens of nonulcerated mucosa were assayed for PGE2 by high-performance liquid chromatography; the mean numbers of ulcers were 0, 5.8, 0.8, and 3 and the mean levels of PGE2 were 55, 41, 125, and 62 pg/mg of wet tissue for groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. It is concluded that parenteral administration of AA reduces but does not completely eliminate stress-induced gastric ulcerations and that the stressed animals synthesized half as much PGE2 as the nonstressed ones after ip administration of equal amounts of AA, suggesting that stress reduces the availability of AA to the gastric mucosa, possibly by vascular spasm.\r"

  ".W": "Liver and biliary abnormalities are well-known complications of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It has been suggested that using total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may further impair liver function in these patients; this seems not to be so with total enteral nutrition (TEN). However, prospective trials comparing the incidence of liver function test (LFT) abnormalities with either TPN or TEN have not been carried out. Twenty-nine IBD inpatients with normal LFT, randomized to receive either TEN with a polymeric diet or isocaloric, isonitrogenous \"all-in-one\" TPN because of protein-energy malnutrition and/or severe disease, were included in the study. Sixteen patients (five with ulcerative colitis and 11 with Crohn's disease) received TEN, and 13 patients (eight ulcerative colitis and five Crohn's disease) were on TPN. All patients were on systemic steroids, and nine of them were on oral metronidazole. Both groups were homogeneous regarding age, sex, diagnosis, disease activity, nutritional status, daily nutrient supply, and days on artificial nutrition. Serum albumin levels significantly increased with TEN (32 +/- 1 to 38.2 +/- 1.6 g/liter, p less than 0.01), but not with TPN (32.1 +/- 2.2 to 33.9 +/- 1.4 g/liter, NS). Clinical improvement occurred in both groups of patients as shown by the change in the disease activity indexes. In all cases, measurements of serum alkaline phosphatase, serum bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyltransferase were performed weekly. There were no significant differences in the initial LFT between both groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ten days thereafter the bursting pressure of the anastomosis was measured as an assessment of wound healing. Bursting pressures were significantly lower in jaundiced rats compared with a sham-operated nonjaundiced group. Preoperative internal biliary drainage significantly improved bursting pressure (p less than 0.001) as did preoperative TPN (p less than 0.001). In the second part of the study the influence of four different feeding solutions on the healing of a colon anastomosis was tested. Solutions with and without 20% fat emulsion and a solution with branched-chain amino acids were tested as well as glucose only. No significant differences were observed among these four groups on the parameters tested.\r"

This study compared gastric motility indices in response to tube feedings at two points in the menstrual cycle, concurrently measured ovarian hormone levels, and described three potentially related factors (ie, GI symptoms, uterine cramping pain, reports of daily stressors). Intragastric motility responses to enteral feedings were obtained on 28 women (aged 19-37) during menses and midfollicular phases of two menstrual cycles. Intragastric pressure changes were monitored by an open-tipped cannula method at rest, during and after tube feeding (Ensure, 240 ml at 8 ml/min). Serum estradiol and progesterone levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. Women completed a daily diary of symptoms and stressors throughout the two menstrual cycles. Results showed that intragastric pressure amplitudes and frequencies were higher at menses compared with midfollicular recordings. At menses, prefeeding and feeding gastric pressure amplitudes were positively correlated with uterine cramping pain and GI symptoms (ie, nausea). At menses, postfeeding contraction frequencies were also correlated with uterine cramping pain. At midfollicular phase, progesterone levels correlated with gastric motility indices; number of stressors indirectly correlated with gastric motility indices. These data suggest that gastric responses to enteral feeding are influenced by menstrual cycle phase.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the effects of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) on hepatic mitochondrial function in immature rats, changes in hepatic energy charge levels and oxidative phosphorylation rates of hepatic mitochondria were studied along with the examination of serum chemical test. Male Wistar rats weighing 30 to 45 g were used and randomized into TPN (n = 8), enteral (n = 7), and control groups (n = 8). Parenteral and enteral groups were fed with TPN solution containing 19.3% dextrose, 3.19% amino acids, 1.05% fat emulsion, minerals and vitamins, and the control group with rat chow. The number of calories per kilogram per day was 550 x 1/4 on the 1st day, 550 x 1/2 on the 2nd, 550 x 3/4 on the 3rd, and 550 x 1 on the 4th day, based on the body weight on the 1st day. After the 5th day, 550 Kcal/kg/day was given, based on the body weight of the respective day. After 13-day feeding, hepatic energy charge (EC), phosphorylation rate (PR) of hepatic mitochondria and serum chemical examination were carried out. EC was 0.871 +/- 0.016 in the control group, 0.830 +/- 0.019 in the enteral, and 0.785 +/- 0.011 in TPN group (p less than 0.001, compared with control group). PR was 138.9 +/- 1.9, 133.0 +/- 6.7, 111.0 +/- 4.3, respectively, (p less than 0.05, compared with control and enteral groups). There was no difference between the three groups on SGOT, SGPT, and total bilirubin. TPN group showed a deterioration of hepatic phosphorylation rate and energy charge in spite of normal serum transaminase levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

During the course of the study growth was similar in each infant. Overall mean daily energy intakes were 90 kcal/kg/day and 84 kcal/kg/day and percentage nitrogen retention was 62% and 55% in twin 1 and twin 2, respectively. No differences were observed between the two infants in IGF-I or growth hormone. Despite low energy intakes incremental weights were within an acceptable range for both infants.\r"

Unopposed conjugated equine estrogen (0.625 mg) lowered total cholesterol 4-8% and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol 12-19% below pre-treatment levels in all three groups. Levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I were increased 9-13 and 9-18%, respectively, with unopposed estrogen. The increase in HDL cholesterol was mainly due to increases in the high-density lipoprotein2 (HDL2) subfraction. Addition of medroxyprogesterone acetate, norethindrone acetate, or d,l-norgestrel at doses shown previously to provide protection against endometrial hyperplasia reversed some of the beneficial estrogen effects, reducing levels of HDL cholesterol 14-17%, HDL2 cholesterol 22-37%, and apolipoprotein A-I 11-15% from those obtained with unopposed estrogen. The LDL cholesterol levels fell 12-19% with unopposed estrogen but remained 7-12% below baseline when progestogens were added. These observations demonstrate that after 3 months of treatment, all three progestogens reversed some of the favorable effects of unopposed estrogen on lipoproteins but permitted a continued modest reduction in LDL cholesterol.\r"

By the fifth year of use, 62.5% of users had regular cycles, 37.5% had irregular cycles, and none had amenorrhea. Of the ten users who became pregnant, eight had regular menstrual cycles in the 6 months before the diagnosis of pregnancy, one had an irregular pattern, and one did not keep a bleeding record. None had amenorrhea. The 5-years cumulative pregnancy rate for patients with regular cycles was 17.4%; this was significantly higher (P less than .05) than the 5-year cumulative rates of 4.4% in users with irregular cycles and 0% in users with amenorrhea. This study indicates that during the first year of Norplant use, only 26.6% of users have regular cycles, but after the first year, 50-60% of users develop regular cycles. The bleeding patterns of women using Norplant improve after the first year of use, and those with regular cycles are at greatest risk for method failure.\r"

Nine hundred thirty-seven women were fitted with a copper-releasing IUD, the Nova-T, and 1821 women with an IUD that releases 20 micrograms of levonorgestrel daily. After 36 months, the cumulative gross rates of amenorrhea and hormonal side effects were significantly higher in the levonorgestrel-IUD users. The cumulative 36-month gross pregnancy rate was 3.7 for the Nova-T and 0.3 for the levonorgestrel IUD (P less than .001), demonstrating the levonorgestrel IUD's high contraceptive efficacy. For the first time, a protective effect of the levonorgestrel IUD against pelvic inflammatory disease as compared with the Nova-T was seen statistically. The cumulative 36-month gross rate of pelvic inflammatory disease was 2.0 in Nova-T- and 0.5 in levonorgestrel-IUD users (P less than .013). This significantly lowered incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease may help to solve one of the major concerns associated with intrauterine contraception.\r"

  ".W": "Several members of a series of N-(fluorenyl-9-methoxycarbonyl) amino acids were found to possess a broad spectrum of antiinflammatory activity. The compounds were active against oxazolone dermatitis in mice and adjuvant arthritis in rats, models in which activated T lymphocytes are implicated. The compounds also inhibited T-lymphocyte activation in vitro, assessed by using the mixed lymphocyte reaction. The compounds inhibited the reversed passive Arthus reaction in rats and arachidonic acid-induced dermatitis in mice, models in which leukocyte infiltration is responsible for the inflammatory reaction. More complete evaluation was made of one compound, N-(fluorenyl-9-methoxycarbonyl)leucine (NPC 15199). On histologic examination after arachidonic acid administration, NPC 15199 was found to block recruitment of neutrophils into the inflammatory site. The compound was not a general myelotoxin. Prolonged treatment of animals did not alter bone-marrow progenitor number or the numbers of circulating white blood cells. Further, several white cell functions were not inhibited in vitro, including neutrophil respiratory burst and macrophage phagocytosis. NPC 15199 was effective in blocking antigen arthritis in rabbits and was effective in a therapeutic protocol, reversing oxazolone edema. These studies suggest that N-(fluorenyl-9-methoxycarbonyl) amino acids may be valuable therapeutic agents for inflammatory diseases.\r"

We have used immunocytochemistry and methods that enhance detection of amyloidogenic proteins to investigate the types of cells in the central nervous system which are involved in the formation of the abnormal scrapie-associated protein. We show that this protein accumulates in astrocytes prior to the cardinal neuropathological changes in scrapie--astrogliosis, vacuolation, neuron loss, and amyloid deposition. These findings implicate the astrocyte in the formation of the scrapie isoform of the prion protein and amyloid in scrapie and suggest that this cell type might also be involved in the replication of the scrapie agent.\r"

  ".U": "91110544\r", 
  ".W": "In Western societies high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels correlate inversely with the risk for coronary heart disease. The primary protein component of both human and mouse HDL is apolipoprotein A-I (apoAI), which comprises greater than 70% of HDL protein and 30% of HDL mass. Human HDLs include particles of several distinct size subpopulations, whereas HDLs from inbred C57BL/6 mice contain a single population of particles. To study the regulation of apoAI expression and its role in HDL assembly, we created transgenic C57BL/6 mice containing the human apoAI gene. Two independent lines of transgenic mice with approximately twice the normal plasma levels of total apoAI were studied. The level of mouse apoAI is reduced greater than 4-fold in both transgenic lines, comprising only 4% of total plasma apoAI levels in one transgenic line and 13% in the other. We demonstrate that the mechanism responsible for the decrease in mouse apoAI is posttranscriptional. Parallel to the replacement of mouse with human apoAI, the single HDL species normally present in the plasma of C57BL/6 is replaced by two HDL subclasses similar in size to human HDL2b and HDL3a. The changes in murine apolipoprotein levels and HDL subclass size are inherited by all transgenic offspring of the two founder animals. These results suggest a dominant role of apoAI in determining the HDL particle size distribution and a mechanism involving expression of human apoAI transgenes that alters the plasma levels of mouse apoAI.\r"

  ".W": "The single 23S rRNA gene of the archaeon Staphylothermus marinus exhibits two introns which, at the RNA level, are located in highly conserved regions of domains IV and V. The RNA introns, which are 56 and 54 nucleotides long, respectively, can form single hairpin structures. In vivo, RNA splicing occurs efficiently, whereas in vitro pre-rRNA transcripts containing each intron were cleaved efficiently when incubated with archaeal cell extracts but were poorly ligated. The introns are cleaved by a mechanism which differs from the mechanisms of eukaryotic rRNA introns but resembles those of the rRNA intron of Desulfurococcus mobilis and the archaeal tRNA introns. The cleavage enzyme recognizes and cuts a putative bulge-helix-bulge structure that can form at the archaeal exon-intron junctions. Using a phylogenetic sequence comparison approach, we define the parts of this structural feature that are essential for cleavage. We also provide evidence for conformational changes occurring in the S. marinus 23S RNA, after cleavage, at both exon-exon junctions, which may account for the low yields of ligation observed in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "The roles of mutational and recombinational processes in the diversification of the exon encoding the antigen binding site in the murine major histocompatibility complex class II gene Ab were assessed by phylogenetic analysis of allelic nucleotide sequences. A total of 46 alleles of Ab exon 2 from 12 Mus species or subspecies and 2 Rattus species were sequenced after amplification by the polymerase chain reaction. Reliable allelic genealogies could not be determined by phylogenetic analyses, due to extensive homoplasy in the data set. This homoplasy results from the shuffling of polymorphisms between alleles by recombinational processes, indicating that polymorphisms in the antigen binding site encoded by Ab are generated by a combination of two processes. First, the accumulation of point mutations has produced highly divergent polymorphic sequence motifs in five regions of Ab exon 2, each encoding a portion of the binding site. Some of these motifs have persisted as polymorphisms in rodents since before the divergence of mouse and rat (greater than 10 million years ago). The second process mediating Ab diversification involves the shuffling of these polymorphic sequence motifs into numerous allelic combinations by repeated intraexonic recombination. Site-specific hyperrecombinational mechanisms are not involved in this process within the exon. We postulate that these mechanisms continuously generate new Ab alleles with highly divergent binding sites from which alleles with advantageous antigen-binding properties are selectively maintained by some form of balancing selection.\r"

  ".U": "91110549\r", 
  ".W": "The six individual catalytic polypeptide chains within the two catalytic trimers of Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase; EC 2.1.3.2) are folded into two discrete structural domains interconnected in part by helix 12, which comprises residues 285-305 and is located near the carboxyl terminus of the chain. The essential role of this helix in folding of the chains and their assembly into ATCase was demonstrated by introducing a stop codon at the position corresponding to amino acid 284, 291, or 299. Cells containing these mutations are pyrimidine auxotrophs lacking ATCase-like protein in cell extracts. In contrast, stable active enzyme is formed from chains truncated at position 306 or 307, showing that all 310 amino acids are not required for assembly. Replacements of Gln-288, Asn-291, Arg-296, and Ala-298 were introduced to assess the effect of alterations within helix 12 on protein stability. Stability of the trimers was measured both by differential scanning microcalorimetry and by the rate of exchange of chains at 4 degrees C when mutant trimers were incubated with succinylated wild-type trimers. Melting temperatures of the mutant trimers spanned a range of more than 20 degrees C, with a few higher and others lower than that of wild-type trimers. Large changes in interchain interaction energies were observed for the trimers, but there was no direct correlation between the ease of dissociation of the trimers and their thermal stability. Calorimetry on the mutant holoenzymes revealed alterations in the interactions between trimers and regulatory subunits within the intact enzymes. The striking changes in stability of both trimers and holoenzymes demonstrated that effects of relatively localized amino acid replacements in helix 12 are manifested by indirect global alterations propagated throughout the structure.\r"

  ".W": "The envelope glycoprotein gp120 of primate immunodeficiency viruses initiates viral attachment to CD4+ cells by binding to the CD4 antigen on host cell surfaces. However, among different CD4+ cell types, different viruses display distinct host cell ranges and cytopathicities. Determinants for both of these biological properties have been mapped to the env gene. We have quantitatively compared the CD4 binding affinities of gp120 proteins from viruses exhibiting different host cell tropisms and cytopathicities. The viral proteins were produced by using a Drosophila cell expression system and were purified to greater than 90% homogeneity. Drosophila-produced gp120 from T-cell tropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) BH10 exhibits binding to soluble recombinant CD4 (sCD4) and syncytia inhibition potency identical to that of pure authentic viral gp120. Relative to the affinity of HIV-1 BH10 gp120 for sCD4, that of dual tropic HIV-1 Ba-L is 6-fold lower, that of restricted T-cell tropic simian immunodeficiency virus mac is 70-fold lower, and that of noncytopathic HIV-2 ST is greater than 280-fold lower. Thus, viruses that utilize CD4 for infection do so by using a remarkably wide range of envelope affinities. These differences in affinity may play a role in determining cell tropism and cytopathicity.\r"

  ".W": "Spontaneous development of diabetes in the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse is mediated by an immunological process. In disease-transfer experiments, the activation of diabetes has been reported to require participation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets. These findings seem to indicate that the CD4+ cells are the helper cells for the activation of cytotoxic CD8+ cells that directly destroy islet beta cells in type I diabetes. In this report we challenge this interpretation because of two observations: (i) Destruction of syngeneic islet grafts by spontaneously diabetic NOD mice (disease recurrence) is CD4+ and not CD8+ T-cell dependent. (ii) Disease recurrence in islet tissue grafted to diabetic NOD mice is not restricted by islet major histocompatibility complex antigens. From these observations we propose that islet destruction depends on CD4+ effector T cells that are restricted by major histocompatibility complex antigens expressed on NOD antigen-presenting cells. Both of these findings argue against the CD8+ T cell as a mediator of direct islet damage. We postulate that islet damage in the NOD mouse results from a CD4+ T-cell-dependent inflammatory response.\r"

  ".W": "Synapsin I is a neuron-specific phosphoprotein that binds to small synaptic vesicles and actin filaments in a phosphorylation-dependent fashion. It has been hypothesized that dephosphorylated synapsin I inhibits neurotransmitter release either by forming a cage around synaptic vesicles (cage model) or by anchoring them to the F-actin cytoskeleton of the nerve terminal (crosslinking model). Computer modeling was performed with the aim of testing the impact of phosphorylation on the molecular interactions of synapsin I within the nerve terminal. The results of the simulation experiments demonstrate that in the crosslinking model the phosphorylation of synapsin I causes a severalfold increase in the number of vesicles released from the cytoskeleton and that in the cage model the phosphorylation induces a 2-fold increase in the number of vesicles bearing one or more unsaturated synapsin I binding sites. These data are compatible with the view that the function of synapsin I in the short-term regulation of neurotransmitter release is to induce a phosphorylation-dependent transition of synaptic vesicles from a \"reserve pool\" to a readily \"releasable pool\" of vesicles.\r"

Xis is shown to mediate the formation of a specific attP looped structure involving cooperative and competitive long-range interactions among integrase, integration host factor, and Xis proteins. This higher-order structure precludes supercoiled attP from engaging in the productive partner interactions that lead to execution of the first strand exchange in integrative recombination. In addition to its previously characterized role in excision, Xis-induced DNA bending is postulated to act as a regulatory switch (in an alternative loop mechanism) that converts the attP intasome from an integrative-competent complex to a nonreactive one.\r"

CD8+ lymphocytes expressing the CD4 transgene proliferate in response to allogeneic class I and class II major histocompatibility complex, whereas CD8+ cells from control animals proliferate only to allogeneic class I gene products.

N null alleles cause the transformation of most epidermal cells into neuroblasts in central and peripheral nervous systems. Alleles of the same gene, called Abruptex (Ax), that map to the extracellular domain of N protein cause the absence of adult sensory organs. Both types of alleles show cell autonomy in mosaic analysis carried out in the last stages of the formation of adult sensory organs. The phenotypes are different: cells lacking N gene products differentiate as sensory organ mother cells early and as its neural sublineage later, whereas in the homozygous Ax condition epidermal cells do not enter the sensory organ mother cell pathway. The results indicate that N gene products act internally in the cell, probably as receptors of intercellular signals both in sensory organ mother cell singularization and in fate specification of its daughter cells. Ax mutations behave as an excess of N+ function in this signal transduction process. N proteins modified by these mutations act as constitutively activated.\r"

Nonetheless, intracellular bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetate (BAPTA) (11-12 mM), a Ca2+ chelator, reduced Ca2(+)-current suppression from 82 to 15%. For the latter, we explain the BAPTA action by a requirement for a certain minimum [Ca2+]i for continued operation of the pathway coupling muscarinic receptors to M-type K+ channels. The pathway coupling muscarinic receptors to Ca channels also showed some dependence on [Ca2+]i, but there may also be a blocking action of BAPTA that is independent of Ca2+ chelation.\r"

The gene for the leucine transfer RNA with a UAA anticodon [tRNALeu (UAA)] from five diverse cyanobacteria and several major groups of chloroplasts contains a single group I intron. The intron is conserved in secondary structure and primary sequence, and occupies the same position, within the UAA anticodon. The homology of the intron across chloroplasts and cyanobacteria implies that it was present in their common ancestor and that it has been maintained in their genomes for at least 1 billion years.\r"

In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, pp34 is phosphorylated on Tyr15, and dephosphorylation of this residue regulates the initiation of mitosis. In this study, it is shown that dephosphorylation of Tyr15 triggered activation of the pp34-cyclin complex from fission yeast, that a human protein-tyrosine phosphatase can catalyze this event both in vitro and in vivo, and that activation of fission yeast pp34 does not require threonine dephosphorylation. The complementary DNA that encoded the tyrosine phosphatase replaced the mitotic activator p80cdc25, closely associating the cdc25(+)-activating pathway with tyrosine dephosphorylation of pp34.\r"
