  ".U": "90300160\r", 
  ".W": "Clinical evaluation of ventilation performance during resuscitation is largely subjective. A mechanical device, the resuscitation bag controller (RC), which encircles the bag and allows controlled compression may improve the precision and accuracy of ventilation with manual resuscitation bags (MRB). We hypothesize that more precise, controlled pressure ventilation can be delivered with the RC, compared to the MRB. Prehospital (N = 13) and hospital personnel (N = 12) who routinely perform manual ventilation were randomized to either method of ventilation. Operators were instructed to ventilate an intubated adult mannequin. The percent of breaths delivered within a specified range, 800 to 1200 mL, was compared using simple regression analysis. The precision of tidal volume (TV) and peak airway pressure (PAP) was compared between methods and groups using the coefficient of variation. Comparison for significant differences between methods and groups in the number of breaths with a TV less than 800 mL and those with pressures greater than 30 cm H20 was performed using chi square or Fisher's exact test. There were no significant differences in the percent of acceptable breaths or mean TV delivered between methods or groups. The precision (i.e., reproducibility of the same value) of TV for both methods was best for hospital personnel. PAPS were less than or equal to 30 cm H2O for 93% of all breaths. Hospital personnel delivered a significantly greater percent of inadequate (less than 0.8 L) breaths, 19 versus 7.4%, and excessive pressure breaths, 9.2 versus 4.2%, when compared to prehospital personnel. We conclude that the resuscitation bag controller offers little advantage over standard bag resuscitation for adult resuscitation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Recent evidence suggests that emergency physicians are able to diagnose trivial illness with 93% specificity in febrile adult drug addicts. Short-term observation units may be an alternative to hospital admission for febrile drug users with a presumptive diagnosis of trivial illness and in those in whom the diagnosis of cotton fever is entertained.\r"

However, not all children with RHS will present with this classic history. This may result in misdiagnosis and delay of appropriate treatment. To evaluate the prevalence of non-classic presentations, a retrospective study was conducted of 45 emergency department patients with RHS. Of these patients, 15 presented with an atypical history. All patients were in minimal distress, holding their affected arms semiflexed and pronated (the nursemaid's position). The classic and nonclassic history groups were equivalent in patient age, spontaneous reductions, and physician reductions. A trend towards more radiographs was noted in the nonclassic group. This study suggests that even in the absence of the classic history of upper extremity traction, radial head subluxation should be suspected in any pediatric patient with an upper extremity complaint who presents with the affected arm in the nursemaid's position.\r"

We reasoned that 12-gauge catheters, shown to have significantly greater fluid flow than 14- or 16-gauge catheters, might allow prehospital care providers to have a more significant role in patient resuscitation. This study was designed to see if 12-gauge intravenous catheters can successfully be placed and used in the prehospital care arena. During a six-month period, commercial peripheral 12-gauge catheter-over-needle intravenous units were placed in any hypovolemic or potentially hypovolemic patient in whom paramedics thought that rapid fluid therapy was, or might become, necessary. They experienced an overall success rate of 84% and a success-per-attempt rate of 74%. The catheters were placed under normal field conditions. Per preexisting protocols, departure from the scene and transport to the hospital were not delayed for any paramedic interventions, including starting intravenous lines. The 12-gauge catheters can be successfully used by paramedics, both to establish large bore intravenous access prior to arrival at the emergency department and to institute effective fluid therapy where time and circumstances allow.\r"

All 5 (1.7%) fractures or ligament disruptions occurred in the group with neck pain or tenderness. Of the study group, 141 (49%) were asymptomatic for cervical injury and nonintoxicated (blood alcohol concentration (BAC) less than 100 mg/dL). Mandatory cervical spine radiography in this group would have resulted in an additional cost of $33,699. Routine cervical spine radiography in alert, nonintoxicated asymptomatic victims of blunt trauma is a costly practice that warrants further examination.\r"

  ".W": "Several recent studies report the sensitivity of computed tomography (CT) to be far greater than that of traditional plain film radiographic studies for evaluation of cervical spine fractures and spinal cord pathology. Nevertheless, plain films continue to be the standard screening examination. CT is used only if fractures are demonstrated or suspected on plain film survey. Recently, three patients with significant head and neck trauma (all three patients had intracranial hemorrhage) had cervical spine evaluation by computed tomography and standard plain film views. CT demonstrated significant C1-C2 fractures, while plain films were completely normal in all three cases. Prospectively studying the next 50 patients with significant head trauma, we added a few more slices to the routine head scan protocol to cover the first three cervical vertebrae. This added very little time or cost to the procedure. The additional CT images demonstrated four upper cervical fractures that could not be seen on plain films, even in retrospect. Our findings suggest that routine inclusion of the upper cervical spine with head CT is appropriate in the evaluation of patients with significant head trauma as defined by intracranial hemorrhage or skull fracture.\r"

Both groups exhibited improvement in posttest scores from pretest score values; additionally, students exposed to the lecture series at Texas Tech--El Paso performed significantly higher on the posttest, compared to the other campuses.

  ".W": "Convenient, reliable tests of cure for genital chlamydial infections have not been evaluated. Cervical appearance, endocervical Gram stain, enzyme immunoassay, and culture for Chlamydia trachomatis were evaluated during a pretreatment visit and at two subsequent randomized test-of-cure visits for 64 nongravid women with endocervical C trachomatis of 3544 patients screened. There were no useful correlations between C trachomatis resolution and cervical appearance. Endocervical Gram stain was determined to be unreliable for test-of-cure use. Both C trachomatis culture and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were shown to be effective for test-of-cure evaluation. The ELISA test became reliably negative 10 days after initiation of treatment and 1 to 5 days after the clearance of viable organisms detected by culture (P = .03). Convenience and cost considerations favor antigen detection methods. This study suggests that antigen detection methods can be used for situations in which test of cure is indicated, such as therapy noncompliance, circumstances supporting reinfection, pregnancy, complicated infections, requests for psychological reassurance, and evidence of persistent cervicitis.\r"

The case series is analyzed to evaluate patient tolerance of the procedure, to measure the time required for the procedure, and to explore the clustering of diagnostic findings as they relate to presenting symptoms. Family physicians performed the examinations in an average of 4.4 minutes, with a median discomfort score of 2 on a scale of 0 to 10. A change in the diagnostic assessment or management plan following examination occurred in 90% of cases. Laryngeal pathology was identified in 73% of patients with chronic hoarseness, 60% of patients with both chronic hoarseness and nasal symptoms, and 3% of patients complaining of chronic nasal symptoms only. Nasal polyps or purulent drainage from the sinus ostia were found in 28% of patients with chronic nasal symptoms, 30% of patients with both chronic hoarseness and nasal symptoms, and 2% of patients with chronic hoarseness only. Incomplete examination (because of gagging) occurred in only 1 of 210 cases. This study demonstrated high diagnostic yield, rapid acquisition of technical skill, minimal patient discomfort, significant impact on diagnosis and management, and minimal time required for examination.\r"

The number of such patients seen in a typical community practice may be significant but has never been studied. Most community-based physicians have little or no formal training in occupational health care. This study consisted of a survey of practicing physicians and major industrial employers in a city of 39,000 with a strong manufacturing base. The purpose was to assess physician skills, attitudes, and practices that might influence the optimal management of patients with work-related conditions, and to assess employer attitudes about this management. Eighty-three percent of physicians and 68% of employers responded to the written surveys. Low numbers of patients with work-related conditions were reported except by orthopedists and a neurologist. Few physicians communicated directly with employers, citing time and confidentiality as factors. Twenty-five percent were unaware of specific legal guidelines for such contact. Administrative and legal complexities were cited by 97% of the respondents as barriers to effective management of such cases. Eight percent of employers sought more contact with physicians, including site visits and more detailed work restriction guidelines. The education of primary care physicians may improve their understanding of work-related conditions and the optimal management and rehabilitation of these patients.\r"

A questionnaire requesting ratings of perceived informational, instrumental, emotional, and crisis support in a variety of relationships was administered to 101 family practice center outpatients. Results indicated strong perceptions of available support overall, with highest levels perceived from partners and parents. Notably, however, strong support was also perceived from extrafamilial sources, surpassing that of other categories of biological relatives. Levels of perceived support from particular people also varied according to type of support being rated. Finally, patients expressed strong preferences for inviting both immediate family members and supportive extrafamilial persons to hospital meetings with physicians to discuss serious medical problems. Results are consistent with a multifactorial model of social support and suggest that physicians should take a broad social systems perspective in assessing patient resources and negotiating attendance at family meetings.\r"

This prospective pilot study involved a cohort of 14 second- and third-year family practice residents and 4 full-time faculty at a community hospital-based family practice residency in Cleveland, Ohio. Rates of continuity that physicians experience were calculated using the usual provider continuity (UPC) measure of continuity, and were correlated with physician satisfaction with outpatient care using a practice satisfaction scale (PSS) developed specifically for this purpose. Residents and faculty were also asked to rank order the importance of several aspects of outpatient care, including continuity of care. The results indicate that both residents and faculty value continuity of care highly compared with other aspects of outpatient care. The average continuity rates were 59% for second-year residents, 54% for third-year residents, and 82% for faculty. The UPC continuity measure correlated highly with the PSS scores (corrected r2 = .55; P less than .001). The data support the hypothesis that continuity of care with patients is an important determinant of resident and faculty physician satisfaction with their outpatient experience.\r"

Homeless families are at an increased risk for numerous medical conditions and have complex health and psychosocial needs. In response to the growing crisis, policymakers have generally focused on families' immediate needs rather than developing a comprehensive long-term response. Health programs have been challenged to develop effective methods of providing outreach and comprehensive, continuous, coordinated services. Family medicine is uniquely qualified to meet the health care needs of homeless families and can play an important role in providing clinical service, designing medical education, developing research, and defining a national advocacy agenda.\r"

Computed tomographic (CT) scans of the head revealed cortical atrophy, ventricular dilation, and diffuse hypodensity of the centrum semiovale. On microscopic examination, the cerebral and cerebellar white matter in all cases showed diffuse and focal, angiocentric regions of myelin pallor, focal vacuolization, and extensive gliosis. Variable axonal loss and axonal spheroids were evident. The microvasculature showed striking changes, including mural thickening, increased cellularity, and enlargement and pleomorphism of endothelial cells with variable numbers of macrophages and multinucleated giant cells (MNGC), which often contained hemosiderin pigment. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) antigens were identified immunocytochemically within perivascular macrophages and MNGC and in some microglial cells. We suggest that the morphologic abnormalities of the microcirculation may be associated with an alteration of the blood-brain barrier. The increased vascular permeability could contribute to damage and loss of the white matter including both myelin and axons, and result in subcortical cerebral atrophy. The HIV-1 infected cells present in relation to the microvasculature may play a role in mediating the vascular injury.\r"

The nucleus was composed of one type of neuron and had about 60,000 cells. In HD, up to 90% neuronal loss was found in the NTL. The remaining neurons showed features of degeneration and there was astrocytosis. The estimated total number of glial cells in the NTL was reduced to 80% of the control values, which was exclusively accounted for by a reduction of 40% in the number of oligodendrocytes. The total number of astrocytes was unchanged. Grouping of astrocytes and the changes observed in glial fibrillary acidic protein immunocytochemistry suggested that astrocytic proliferation occurred.\r"

Autopsy tissues showed immune-reactive IgA within surviving motor neurons and deposits of IgA and C3 within renal glomeruli. By indirect immunofluorescence, the patient's serum contained high-titer IgA that bound to axons and to the perikarya of nerve cells in central and peripheral nervous system. The IgA paraprotein reacted with the 200 kDa, high molecular weight subunit of neurofilament protein (NFH) in Western blots of purified neurofilaments. It also reacted with dephosphorylated NFH and with NFH expressed as a fusion protein in E. coli, suggesting that the autoantibody recognized a peptide epitope. The IgA crossreacted with a surface antigen of cultured human neuroblastoma cells but mouse monoclonal antibodies to NFH did not. Absorption of the patient's serum with neurofilaments eliminated IgA binding to neuroblastoma cells, indicating that the same antibodies bound to both determinants. The IgA paraprotein seems to be an autoantibody with specificity for neurofilament protein and a cell surface component of neuronal cells; the antibody may have been important in the pathogenesis of neuronal degeneration.\r"

  ".W": "Transgenic mice expressing the large T-antigen of the simian virus 40 (SV 40) under the control of 1) the enhancer of Moloney murine sarcoma virus (MSV) and 2) the SV 40 promoter develop undifferentiated neuroectodermal tumors located in the midline of the dorsal brain surface, abnormalities in lens fiber differentiation and retinal dysplasia. In this study the brain neoplasms of six adult animals and the brain of one 11-day old mouse were examined by conventional histology and immunocytochemical demonstration of S-antigen, rod-opsin, neuron-specific enolase, neurofilaments (160 and 200 kDa) and glial fibrillary acidic protein. According to histologic criteria the neoplasms were characterized as \"primitive\" neuroectodermal tumors composed mainly of small cells with scanty and ill-defined cytoplasm. Neoplastic cells displaying immunoreactive S-antigen were found in five brain tumors; three of these tumors also contained a limited number of rod-opsin immunoreactive neoplastic cells. Some tumor cells had neurite-like processes containing immunoreactive neurofilament (200 kDa). No pathologic lesions were found in the brain of the 11-day old animal. Tumors in transgenic mice may resemble pineal cell tumors and a special subtype of medulloblastoma in man. These neoplasms contain S-antigen immunoreactive and also rod-opsin immunoreactive tumors cells in certain cases. The findings suggest that transgenic mice expressing the large T-antigen of SV 40 may become a valuable animal model for analysing the origin, histogenesis and development of primitive neuroectodermal tumors with photoreceptor-like features (pineal cell tumors and certain medulloblastomas).\r"

From the fifth week, myelinated fiber counts at mid-tube level were equal to the value of an intact nerve, but at the distal part the number of fibers exceeded both mid-tube level and unsectioned nerve values. At the proximal part of the tube an important fiber disorganization was observed. Second, we have compared acrylic semipermeable and totally impermeable silicone tubes at four and 27 weeks postoperatively. In terms of the number of myelinated fibers and the surface of the endoneurium at the mid-tube level, the most effective tube was the impermeable one. This study points out the importance of the tube wall permeability in nerve regeneration.\r"

Five patients not on corticosteroid treatment showed intense focal 111In accumulation in abscesses, whereas an abscess patient receiving a high steroid dose showed no uptake. Two patients studied twice showed intense uptake in abscesses when not on steroid therapy or on a low dose, whereas no uptake was seen when they received high or medium doses. Weak or moderate 111In uptake was observed in nine tumors. Microscopically assessed degree of tumor granulocyte infiltration, vessel proliferation, and hemorrhage did not correlate with the outcome of 111In GS. Our results suggest that intense focal cerebral 111In uptake favors the abscess diagnosis. Abscesses may go undetected, however, in patients on high- or medium-dose steroid therapy.\r"

Left and right ventricular ejection fractions, myocardium/lung, myocardium/liver, myocardium/spleen, and myocardium/gallbladder count ratios were similar for the one- and two-day groups. No significant difference was observed in any variable measured.

Circulating immunoreactive antibody followed a biphasic clearance pattern. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that 131I-B72.3 retained its integrity in the patients' sera. HPLC analysis also demonstrated the presence of immune complexes in the sera of 12 patients; this correlated with elevated levels of circulating TAG-72. Several different HAMA response patterns were detected in the 25 patients' sera that were analyzed; some patients developed HAMA as early as 5-7 days post-MAb injection. Higher doses of administered MAb B72.3 correlated with the development of HAMA (p = 0.007). The presence of elevated levels of TAG-72 in the patients' pre-inoculum serum was shown to correlate with the detection of lesions by gamma scanning. Serum TAG-72 may serve as a criteria for patient selection for immunodiagnostic or immunotherapeutic procedures using MAb B72.3.\r"

  ".W": "While studying the uptake of iodine-123-metaiodobenzylguanidine ([123I]MIBG) in chemodectomas, we coincidentally detected catecholamine secreting tumors in 5 out of 14 patients. In three of these cases, a norepinephrine secreting abdominal paraganglioma was subsequently removed. One patient had a norepinephrine secreting chemodectoma and one had a dopamine secreting chemodectoma. Prior to [123I]MIBG imaging and urinary catecholamine measurements, endocrine activity was suspected in only one of these five patients. Apart from these five cases, two other patients showed elevated catecholamine secretion and abnormal abdominal [123I]MIBG concentrations. However, these two patients were not surgically explored, because of normal computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MRI) studies. We suspect that catecholamine-secreting tumors are more common in patients with chemodectomas than is assumed in the literature, and we therefore recommend urinary catecholamine screening for all patients with chemodectomas. In case of elevated catecholamine secretion, MIBG scintigraphy is indicated.\r"

The clinical usefulness of both methods was compared in the measurement of BMC in the forearm. DEXA had a long-term in vivo precision of 1% which was significantly better than that of DPA. Changes in the distribution of fatty tissue influenced the accuracy of the two spinal methods in different ways. Forearm BMC discriminated between the bone mass of early and late postmenopausal women to the same degree as DPA and DEXA. The variability in the response to estrogen treatment and placebo was much lower with DEXA and forearm BMC than with DPA. We conclude that DEXA provides a fast and precise measurement of spinal BMC/BMD. The accuracy remains to be evaluated for in vivo studies.\r"

Presently, for the visualization of a suppressed thyroid lobe, a patient has to undergo the thyrotropin (TSH) stimulation test, which has several disadvantages. In this study we have used tertiary butyl isonitrile (99mTc-TBI), well known as a myocardial imaging agent, for visualization of the suppressed lobe. Thirteen of fourteen patients studied demonstrated a contralateral lobe on a 99mTc-TBI scan which was not visualized with a 99mTc0(4) or 131I scan. Although it is not possible to demonstrate the autonomous nature of the hyperfunctioning thyroid nodule using 99mTc-TBI, we conclude that it is feasible to use this agent to visualize the lobe without the TSH test.\r"

To evaluate the myocardial tracer kinetics, 99mTc-SQ30217, was injected intracoronarily in open-chested dogs under baseline conditions and after administration of intravenous (i.v.) dipyridamole. Myocardial first-pass retention fraction averaged 0.90 +/- 0.04. Clearance of the tracer occurred in a biexponential manner. Sixty-seven percent of retained activity cleared with a half-time of 2.3 +/- 0.6 min, while the residual activity demonstrated slow clearance. The clearance rate of the rapid phase correlated with myocardial blood flow (r = 0.72, p less than 0.001). Myocardial SQ30217 clearance rate following i.v. injection as determined by dynamic imaging with tomography (SPRINT) averaged 21 +/- 4 min and increased to 13 +/- 4 min following dipyridamole. Thus, 99mTc-SQ30217 is a promising flow tracer with high initial myocardial retention and rapid tissue clearance, which allow repeated flow determinations within short time intervals using advanced SPECT technology.\r"

In this study, antibody distribution in a tumor is simulated by splicing together information on global pharmacokinetics: transport across the capillary wall, diffusive penetration through the tumor interstitial space, and antigen-antibody interaction. The geometry simulated corresponds to spherical nodules of densely packed tumor cells. This modeling analysis demonstrates that: 1) antigen-antibody binding in tumors can retard antibody percolation; 2) high antibody affinity at a given dose tends to decrease antibody percolation because there are fewer free antibody molecules. The result is a more heterogeneous distribution; 3) the average antibody concentration in the tumor does not increase linearly with affinity; and 4) increasing antibody dose leads to better percolation and more uniform distribution. This mathematical model and the general principles developed here can be applied as well to other biologic ligands.\r"

The biodistribution studies demonstrated differences in kidney and liver localization: IgG less than Fc less than Fab less than 1/2Fc (kidney), Fc less than 1/2Fc less than IgG less than Fab (liver). The imaging studies revealed that target-to-background ratio (T/B) and percent residual activity (%RA) for IgG was significantly greater (p less than 0.01) than 1/2 Fc or Fab, and T/B for IgG was greater (p less than 0.01) than Fc.

Image rotation and centering are performed by determining the angle of rotation and centerline coordinate that result in maximal left-right correlation. Testing of this method on sets of multiple images acquired simultaneously through different brain levels suggests that the optimal rotation can be determined within 1 degree and the centerline within 0.3 mm. Spatial alignment of two or more images from the same brain level of a single subject is accomplished by finding the translation and rotation that yield the highest correlation between the images. Testing of the alignment method on sets of simultaneously acquired images at multiple brain levels suggests that the optimal translation can be determined within 0.45-0.69 mm and the optimal rotation within 0.8 degrees. These methods are completely objective and can easily be automated.\r"

This study examined whether Wiener filtering could improve quantitation of the severity of myocardial perfusion deficits. In 19 anesthetized dogs, adjustable stenoses were placed on the left anterior descending (LAD, n = 12) or circumflex (LCx, n = 7) arteries. Thallium-201 SPECT images were acquired during maximal coronary vasodilation with dipyridamole, and simultaneous measurements of myocardial blood flow were made with microspheres. The relationship between SPECT and microsphere flow deficits in the LAD region was significantly better (p less than 0.05) with Wiener filtering (Y = 0.90X + 0.03, r = 0.78) than with conventional Hanning filtering (Y = 0.66X + 0.34, r = 0.61). Similarly, in the LCx region the relationship between SPECT and microsphere perfusion deficits was better (p less than 0.01) with the Wiener filter (Y = 0.91X + 0.07, r = 0.66) than with the Hanning filter (Y = 0.36X + 0.50, r = 0.40). Wiener filtering improves quantitation of the severity of regional myocardial perfusion deficits, allowing better assessment of the functional significance of coronary artery stenoses.\r"

These values are five times lower than the ones reported by the manufacturer of HMPAO.

Thus, we have developed a computer method to quantify and display the three-dimensional distribution of reversible segments. Circumferential profiles generated from the short axis slices are normalized to the reference area in the stress study. The stress is subtracted from the normalized delayed data, and then displayed as a polar bull's-eye plot so that positive values show areas that have \"reversed\" or \"improved.\" Patient profiles are compared to means and standard deviations of reversibility for all pixels determined from the Emory normal male files. Criteria for reversibility were developed from studies of 42 male patients found to have 48 defects, as determined by the consensus of five blinded expert observers. There was computer agreement with the experts on 25 of 31 relatively fixed and 14 of 17 reversible defects. Our preliminary results indicate that this new method promises to aid observers to more consistently identify and quantify the reversibility of SPECT 201Tl myocardial perfusion defects.\r"

Coagulation (ischemic) necrosis, inflammation, and bacterial overgrowth were all present in the intestine of nearly all patients but with individual variability in the severity of these findings. Overall, coagulation necrosis was more severe than any other finding in most infants, indicating the importance of ischemia in the pathophysiology of necrotizing enterocolitis. Reparative tissue changes such as epithelial regeneration, granulation tissue formation, and fibrosis, found in two thirds of cases, suggested ongoing tissue injury of at least several days' duration. Birth weight, Apgar score, age, feeding status, and the presence of respiratory distress syndrome were not correlated with any particular histologic feature. The pathologic changes of necrotizing enterocolitis suggest that its cause is multifactorial, with ischemia, inflammation, bacterial overgrowth, and reparative tissue changes all playing important roles.\r"

The molecule, which was constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli, is a novel recombinant protein composed of a variable light-chain (VL), amino acid sequence of an immunoglobulin tethered to a variable heavy-chain (VH) sequence by a designed peptide. We show that this protein, derived from the DNA sequence of the variable regions of the antitumor monoclonal antibody B6.2, has the same in vitro antigen-binding properties as the B6.2 Fab' fragment. Comparative pharmacokinetic studies in athymic mice demonstrate much more rapid alpha and beta phases of plasma clearance for the single-chain antigen-binding protein than for the Fab' fragment, as well as an extremely rapid whole-body clearance. Half-life values for alpha and beta phases of single-chain antigen-binding protein clearance were 2.4 minutes and 2.8 hours, respectively, versus 14.8 minutes and 7.5 hours for Fab'. Furthermore, the single-chain antigen-binding protein molecule did not show accumulation in the kidney as did the Fab' molecule or, as previously shown, the F(ab')2 molecule. Despite its rapid clearance, the single-chain antigen-binding protein showed uptake in a human tumor xenograft comparable to that of the Fab' fragment, resulting in tumor to normal tissue ratios comparable to or greater than those obtained with the Fab' fragment. These studies thus demonstrate the in vivo stability of recombinant single-chain antigen-binding proteins and their potential in some diagnostic and therapeutic clinical applications in cancer and other diseases.\r"

The action of suramin was potentiated threefold by doxorubicin for the PC-3 line and seven-fold by doxorubicin for the LNCaP line. Both the suramin-TNF-alpha and the doxorubicin-TNF-alpha combinations showed synergistic action against the LNCaP line. Synergistic activity was noted at drug concentrations routinely achieved clinically. This study demonstrates that suramin, doxorubicin, and TNF-alpha are active agents against prostate cancer cell lines and that their activity can be enhanced when they are used in combination.\r"

These cell lines expressed class I private determinants, H-2.9 and H-2.26, but not the monomorphic determinant defined by monoclonal antibody M1/42. Both cell lines produced tumors in syngeneic and allogeneic hosts. The monomorphic determinant could be demonstrated on both cell lines following growth in allogeneic (BALB/c mice) but not in syngeneic (RFM mice) hosts. The re-expressed determinant present on cells following growth in allogeneic mice was not of host origin. Thus, tumorigenic x irradiation may differentially affect the expression of class I major histocompatibility complex determinants.\r"

Compared with normotensive subjects, borderline hypertensive subjects had higher home blood pressures (mean, 12/7 mm Hg higher). Their childhood and postpubertal blood pressures were elevated (6/4 mm Hg higher than normal at age 6 years and 12/7 mm Hg higher than normal at age 21 years), and hypertensive target organ changes were detected. Borderline hypertensive subjects also had elevated minimal forearm resistance (0.22 U higher than normal), decreased stroke index (1.8 mL/m2 lower than normal), and impaired ventricular diastolic relaxation (mitral Doppler peak early diastolic blood flow [E] to peak late diastolic blood flow [A] ratio 0.13 lower than normal). Borderline hypertensive subjects had significant abnormalities in other coronary risk factors (cholesterol levels were 0.39 mmol/L higher, triglyceride levels were 0.45 mmol/L higher, high-density lipoprotein levels were 0.08 mmol/L lower, insulin levels were 38 pmol/L higher, and 16.5% more of them were overweight). Borderline hypertension is neither transient nor innocuous. Its association with other predictors of atherosclerosis calls for clinical attention.\r"

Treatment cities received a 5-year, low-cost, comprehensive program using social learning theory, a communication-behavior change model, community organization principles, and social marketing methods that resulted in about 26 hours of exposure to multichannel and multifactor education. Risk factors were assessed in representative cohort and cross-sectional surveys at baseline and in three later surveys. After 30 to 64 months of education, significant net reductions in community averages favoring treatment occurred in plasma cholesterol level (2%), blood pressure (4%), resting pulse rate (3%), and smoking rate (13%) of the cohort sample. These risk factor changes resulted in important decreases in composite total mortality risk scores (15%) and coronary heart disease risk scores (16%). Thus, such low-cost programs can have an impact on risk factors in broad population groups.\r"

Recently, it has been questioned whether the benefits of treating asthmatics in the intensive care unit outweigh the potential hazards. To address this issue, we examined the outcome of status asthmaticus in our medical intensive care unit between January 1, 1978, and December 31, 1987. Eighty episodes of status asthmaticus occurred in 64 patients. In 50 episodes, respiratory failure (PaCO2 greater than 50 mm Hg) was present. In half of these episodes, mechanical ventilation was avoided despite severe acidosis and hypercapnia; in the remainder mechanical ventilation was required as a lifesaving measure. Most patients improved rapidly and required only a short stay in the intensive care unit. There were no deaths and few complications. This was accomplished by close monitoring and repetitive blood gas analysis. We believe that the previous high complication rates and mortality associated with the hospital care of status asthmaticus can be avoided.\r"

A cohort study was performed to evaluate risk factors for disease. Persons who underwent procedures before 10:30 AM were more likely to have developed infection than those with procedures after that time (relative risk, 5.6). In addition, procedures involving any of the second through fourth toes were more likely to have resulted in infection than procedures involving only the first and/or fifth toes (relative risk, 4.4). Persons with 0, 1, or 2 risk factors had attack rates of 5%, 14%, and 60%, respectively. Mycobacterium chelonae subspecies abscessus organisms of the same antimicrobial resistance pattern as the patients' strains were cultured from distilled water in a reusable, nonsterilized container. A jet injector used to administer lidocaine was held between procedures in a mixture of the distilled water and a disinfectant as recommended by the manufacturer. Inoculation of patients with mycobacteria by the jet injector may have only occurred early in the day due to slow killing of the bacteria by the disinfectant. The outbreak emphasizes the pathogenicity of this water-associated organism and the need for high-level disinfection of jet injectors.\r"

To determine the frequency of tests that are performed and evaluate house officer laboratory skills, we surveyed house officer attitudes and tested their ability to perform four common laboratory tests. We received 193 responses from 254 house officers at one university teaching hospital. While most perceived the need to use ward laboratories (ie, self-service laboratories located on patient care wards), 67% used them infrequently. Barriers included poor laboratory condition, inadequate time, accuracy, and infectious exposure concerns. Twenty-four percent felt they did not know or were unsure if they knew how to perform simple tests. Forty-seven house officers completed the practical examination. Most accurately reported a spun hematocrit and correctly identified white blood cell findings on a blood smear. Only 50% counted 100 cells. Urinary dipstick interpretation was generally acceptable but the microscopic examination was less accurate. Twenty-three percent failed to identify gram-negative rods on a slide with both gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods. If physicians are to perform selected laboratory tests, these data suggest, at least in one institution, more formal training, practice, and evaluation are necessary to ensure their performance with adequate proficiency.\r"

Videometric measurements were made of perfusion pressure (PP) dependent changes in lumen diameter of superficial vessels before and after acute inhibition of the TGF mechanism by direct microinfusion of 0.1 mM furosemide solution into the macula densa (MD) segment. When PP was raised from 60 to 123 +/- 7 mm Hg in seven vessels, jAA diameter decreased by 29 +/- 3% (SEM, N = 7). During furosemide infusion with the same change in PP, jAA diameter decreased only 7 +/- 2%. After calcium channel blockade with 1 micromolar nimodipine, jAA lumen diameter increased by 21 +/- 7%. A similar pattern of responses was observed in eight jAA where TGF was inhibited with an oil block at the MD. mAA autoregulatory responses were also blunted by TGF inhibition. Raising PP from 60 to 120 mm Hg resulted in 15 +/- 2% and 7 +/- 2% decreases in mAA luminal diameter before and after TGF inhibition. These results demonstrate that the autoregulatory responses in mid- and juxtaglomerular afferent arteriolar segments are mediated by both TGF and a TGF-independent myogenic mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "Renal iron handling was characterized in three experimental models of the nephrotic syndrome: puromycin aminonucleoside, adriamycin and nephrotoxic serum. In adriamycin-induced nephrotic syndrome, which has previously been shown to result from alterations in pore size of the filtration barrier, the transferrin leak was most severe with a fractional clearance of 25%, a value identical to albumin. In contrast, in puromycin nephrotic syndrome and nephrotoxic serum nephritis the fractional clearance of transferrin was never greater than 2% and consistently less than the fractional clearance of albumin. The fact that iron/transferrin ratios in urine and serum were frequently different, sometimes higher other times lower, documents that iron and transferrin can be dissociated in tubule fluid and handled differently in regards to tubule uptake. Kidney iron concentration is also increased in both immunological and non-immunological forms of nephrotic syndrome. In the proximal tubule iron is present largely on the luminal aspect of the cell. In contrast, the major deposition of iron occurs in the lysosomes of the distal tubule cells. Kidney iron concentration does not correlate with tubule fluid iron content but can be prevented from increasing by systemic iron and/or transferrin depletion. This suggests that iron enters the distal tubule cells with transferrin via its receptors from the basolateral side of the distal tubule cells. In association with the increase tubule fluid and kidney iron, there is a marked reduction in kidney selenium and copper content. It is concluded that urinary iron and transferrin losses can vary greatly in different types of experimental renal diseases, and that iron and transferrin can be dissociated in the tubule fluid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the present study, absorptive duodenal and renal tubular epithelia of 12- to 14-week-old male SHR and WKY were examined by electron microscopy to determine whether such disturbances could be related to structural abnormalities. Patchy loss of microvilli in both duodenal and proximal tubular epithelia was observed in the SHR, whereas brush border membrane was entirely normal in the WKY. Irregular spaces were observed between the basal aspects of SHR intestinal epithelial cells and their basement membrane. In addition, the average height of duodenal and renal microvilli was reduced in the SHR. Two specific markers of the brush border membrane, alkaline phosphatase and villin, as well as the cytoplasmic vitamin-D dependent calcium-binding proteins, CaBP9K and CaBP28K were determined. Duodenal alkaline phosphatase activity was reduced in the SHR, compared with the WKY: 0.145 +/- 0.002 vs. 0.186 +/- 0.002 IE/min.microns 3 x 10(3) brush border, mean +/- SEM, N = 10 pairs, P less than 0.001. However, duodenal villin expression was not different from that of the WKY. Duodenal CaBP9K and renal CaBP28K content was diminished in the SHR: 21.0 +/- 0.80 vs. 29.9 +/- 2.19 micrograms/mg protein, N = 6 pairs, P less than 0.01 for duodenum, and 4.47 +/- 0.39 vs. 7.67 +/- 0.54 micrograms/mg protein, N = 6 pairs, P less than 0.001 for kidney. These data showing structural and functional abnormalities of intestinal and kidney cells in the SHR appear to reflect a disorder of transporting epithelia which may be either intrinsic or related to reduced circulating calcitriol.\r"

  ".W": "Various pathological disorders are accompanied by the deposition of lipids into glomerular cells. To gain insight into these disorders, it is essential to know if glomerular cells possess lipoprotein receptors. We therefore characterized the activity of lipoprotein receptors in cultured epithelial cells of the human glomerulus. Podocytes were chosen as they are directly exposed to lipoproteins in pathological states like in glomerular proteinuria (such as, nephrotic syndrome). Isolated human glomeruli (purity greater than 95%) were incubated in buffered RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2. Outgrowing cells were vimentin and keratin positive. Monolayer cultures of human glomerular epithelial cells upon incubation in lipoprotein deficient serum for 48 hours expressed a receptor-dependent uptake of lipoproteins. These cells showed about 10% of the maximal capacity for LDL uptake as compared to fibroblasts; however, the Km values for binding, internalization and degradation were similar in the cultures of glomerular epithelial cells and fibroblasts. The Km values for degradation of LDL, chylomicron remnants, beta-VLDL from cholesterol-fed rabbits and VLDL from familial LCAT-deficiency patients were 14.2, 4.9, 2.9, 4.5 micrograms protein/ml medium, respectively, for glomerular epithelial cells. The avid uptake of 125I-labeled apo E-containing lipoproteins was further substantiated by their poor displacement by a 25-fold excess of unlabeled LDL and their ability to down regulate the apo B,E receptor activity. LDL as well as beta-VLDL were able to suppress the incorporation of 14C acetate into sterols and to stimulate 3H-cholesterylester formation. These experiments show that cultured glomerular epithelial cells express lipoprotein receptor activity. Plasma concentrations of apo E-containing lipoproteins are increased in certain renal diseases (such as, nephrotic syndrome); these lipoproteins could be rapidly removed by glomerular epithelial cells and lead to lipid deposition in glomeruli.\r"

  ".W": "The kidney is a main target organ for cadmium toxicity. The present study has been performed to test for effects of cadmium on electrical properties of cultured subconfluent kidney (MDCK) cells. Cadmium leads to a rapid, sustained and reversible hyperpolarization of the cell membrane, paralleled by an increase of the potassium selectivity and a decrease of the resistance. Thus, cadmium increases the potassium conductance of the cell membrane. The half maximal effect is elicited congruent to 0.2 microM, a concentration encountered during chronic cadmium intoxication. At extracellular calcium concentration reduced to less than 0.1 microM, 5 microM cadmium leads to a transient hyperpolarization, which can be elicited only once. High concentrations (50 microM) of cadmium lead to a sustained hyperpolarization even at extracellular calcium concentrations of less than 0.1 microM. According to fluorescence measurements cadmium leads to an increase of intracellular calcium activity, which is sustained at 1 mM and transient at less than 1 microM extracellular calcium activity. In conclusion, cadmium at low concentrations enhances the potassium conductance in a calcium dependent way. The observations suggest that cadmium enhances intracellular calcium both by recruitment from intracellular stores and by modification of calcium transport across the cell membrane. At high concentrations cadmium enhances the potassium conductance independently from enhanced intracellular calcium activity.\r"

The purpose of the present study was to determine if reabsorption of tobramycin in proximal and distal nephron segments in vivo is altered by systemic pH. To test this possibility on the single nephron level, 24 nl samples of [3H] tobramycin were micro-injected into proximal and distal nephron segments, and its recovery was compared to that of [14C] inulin in rats undergoing osmotic diuresis with NaHCO3 or Na2SO4 containing HCl. Results were obtained in 66 tubules in 20 rats. Although plasma and urine pH were altered as anticipated in bicarbonate-infused and acid-infused animals, urine and late proximal tubule flow rates were similar. When animals were acid infused, 24.8 +/- 1.90% of [3H] tobramycin injected into proximal nephrons was reabsorbed compared to 7.5 +/- 1.56% (P less than 0.001) when the animals were bicarbonate-infused. When [3H] tobramycin was injected into distal tubules, 5.9 +/- 0.75% was reabsorbed in acid-infused rats while virtually none of the injected tobramycin, 0.43 +/- 1.59%, was reabsorbed by the distal nephron of bicarbonate-loaded animals. Our results provide evidence that tobramycin reabsorption by both proximal and distal nephron segments is substantially reduced by bicarbonate-infusion.\r"

  ".W": "Oxygen free radical production inhibits ADPase-mediated antithrombotic action. Different forms of experimental glomerulonephritis (GN) are characterized by early glomerular influx of inflammatory cells and thrombus formation. The causal relationship of these inflammatory events is obscure. Previous studies have shown that glomerular ADPase in the rat kidney may function as a potent antithrombotic principle, whereas this enzyme is highly sensitive for oxygen free radicals. To study whether O2- producing inflammatory cells are able to induce intraglomerular thrombosis via impairment of ADPase, we investigated influx of inflammatory cells in relation to glomerular ADPase activity and platelet aggregation in three models of GN. In two of these models (anti-Thy1 and anti-GBM GN) influx of neutrophils and thrombus formation occurs, whereas in anti-FX1A nephritis this aspect of the inflammatory phase is not present. The results show a relationship between influx of oxygen free radical-producing cells, reduction of glomerular ADPase activity and increased platelet aggregation. Moreover, it is shown that impairment of glomerular ADPase and increased platelet aggregation in anti-Thy1 and anti-GBM GN could be reduced by treatment with superoxide dismutase and catalase. The demonstration that activated neutrophils perfused ex vivo in the rat kidney can directly affect glomerular ADPase and antithrombotic potential in an O2- dependent manner, further supports the proposed sequence of events; oxygen free radicals produced by activated neutrophils reduce glomerular ADPase activity, leading to facilitation of thrombus formation.\r"

Although substantial evidence exists for the production of ROS by glomerular cells, little is known about production of these reactive oxygen metabolites by renal tubular cells. We examined the ability of cultured cells from different segments of the rabbit nephron to elaborate ROS. Under basal conditions, cells of the proximal tubule, cortical collecting duct, and papillary collecting duct produced superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide. Exposure to opsonized zymosan or heat-aggregated gamma globulin significantly increased ROS production by all three tubular cell types. The production of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide was time dependent and increased with increasing concentrations of the stimulating factors. These experiments indicate that renal tubular cells have the potential to participate in renal injury via elaboration of highly-reactive oxygen metabolites.\r"

We sought to characterize some of the changes in proto-oncogene and growth factor expression during this proliferative response. Northern analysis of polyadenylated RNAs of kidney cortical and outer stripe of outer medullary tissue from male Sprague-Dawley rats was performed following release of renal hilar clamping of 50 minutes duration. Ischemia produced an increase in c-fos mRNA that reached a peak at one hour and declined rapidly to control levels by four hours after release of the clamp. A similar rapid increase and decrease in early growth response 1 (Egr 1) mRNA was noted. The response of these immediate early genes was typical of their response to mitogens, suggesting that they served a similar role in renal cell regeneration. Levels of c-Ki-ras and glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA were unchanged. Renal preproEGF mRNA decreased at two hours, was virtually absent by 24 hours and remained low for at least four days after ischemia. Urinary excretion of EGF fell immediately after release of ischemia and before the decline in preproEGF mRNA or SNGFR, suggesting post-transcriptional affects of ischemia on renal EGF production. EGF excretion returned to only 50% of control by day 21. Specific 125I-EGF binding increased in membrane fractions of cortex, outer medulla and inner medulla as early as 24 hours after release of the clamp. Cortical 125I-EGF binding increased in the proximal tubule but not in the glomerulus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Basal prostanoid production was greater in glomeruli from the obstructed kidney (OK) than in glomeruli from the contralateral kidney (CLK) of rats with obstruction or glomeruli from the kidneys of sham-operated rats. Glomeruli obtained from the CLK of rats with unilateral obstruction also produced more PGE2 and 6-keto PGF1 alpha than glomeruli obtained from kidneys of sham-operated rats. Administration of an ACE inhibitor to rats with unilateral obstruction in vivo returned basal prostanoid production in vitro to levels seen in glomeruli of sham-operated rats. The increase in prostanoid production in response to angiotensin II added in vitro was less in glomeruli from rats with unilateral obstruction than in glomeruli from sham-operated rats. However, the response was restored to that seen in glomeruli of sham-operated rats after blockade of angiotensin II synthesis in vivo in rats with unilateral obstruction.

Proximal tubule fluid reabsorption, which was depressed in the acute stage of injury, returned to normal in chronic Heymann nephritis, but both PAH and TEA extraction continued to be depressed. PAH extraction was also decreased in isolated perfused kidneys from rats with Heymann nephritis. A three fold increase in PAH content of these perfused kidneys indicated that there was a defect in luminal PAH transport. Reconstitution of the proximal tubule brush border in chronic Heymann nephritis was not accompanied by functional recovery of secretory processes.\r"

It is possible, therefore, that PTH affects lymphocyte function. We studied the interaction between PTH and proliferation of human lymphocytes in vitro and examined potential mechanisms for such an interaction. 1-84 PTH stimulated in a dose dependent manner PHA-induced proliferation of T cells but had no effect on PWM-induced proliferation. The hormone did not alter CD4/CD8 ratio. Inactivation of PTH abolished its stimulatory effect. PTH augmented IL-2 production by PHA-activated T cells but did not increase expression of IL-2R. 1-34 PTH also stimulated PHA-induced T cell proliferation. TPA augmented PHA-induced T cell proliferation but the addition of PTH to the culture stimulated by PHA and TPA did not augment further the proliferation of T cells. Staurosporin reversed the stimulation by PTH of the PHA-induced lymphocyte proliferation. Both 1-34 and 1-84 PTH stimulated cyclic AMP production by lymphocytes. Forskolin did not affect PHA-induced T cell proliferation although it stimulated cyclic AMP generation. The results show that: 1) PTH acts on T cells; 2) acute exposure to PTH augments PHA-induced T cell proliferation and IL-2 production; 3) this action of PTH is related to its biological activity and is most likely due to the ability of PTH to enhance entry of calcium into cells and/or stimulation of protein kinase C but is independent of cyclic AMP generation.\r"

The current study examined a series of patients with crescentic IgA disease, since IgA disease in general has a highly variable course and the presence of crescents is one indicator of likely progression to end-stage renal failure. We compared the intraglomerular and interstitial infiltrates within biopsies from patients with crescentic IgA nephropathy (N = 5) versus those with noncrescentic IgA (N = 18), or normal controls (N = 10). Few leucocytes were found within glomeruli of normal (2.4 +/- 0.7 cells/glomerular cross section) (mean +/- SEM) or noncrescentic IgA disease biopsies (3.8 +/- 0.7), and no activated MNC bearing receptors for interleukin-2 (IL-2R) were detected. By contrast, in crescentic IgA disease, glomerular leucocytes were increased (5.1 +/- 0.6, P less than 0.01), due to increased monocyte (3.1 +/- 0.9, P less than 0.01) and T cell (1.4 +/- 0.4, P less than 0.01) infiltration, and IL-2R + MNC were then observed (1.2 +/- 0.5, P less than 0.05). Studies of interstitial cells showed small numbers of leucocytes within normal kidneys (101 +/- 16/mm2). Biopsies from noncrescentic IgA disease showed a fivefold increase in interstitial MNC infiltration (total leucocytes 565 +/- 105/mm2, P less than 0.01), due to an influx of T cells (283 +/- 59/mm2, P less than 0.01) and monocytes (120 +/- 32/mm2, P less than 0.01), and including a mean of 20% IL-2R+ MNC (114 +/- 29/mm2, P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In five subjects, Hct was raised by recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) treatment, and in the other seven by blood transfusion. Solute removal was assessed by measuring: (1) whole blood (kb), blood water (kbw) and dialysate (kd) clearances; (2) the amount of solute in the spent dialysate; (3) the fractional decrement of serum solute concentration achieved by hemodialysis; and (4) urea kinetics, including kt/V and protein catabolic rate (PCR). The results showed that increasing the Hct did result in a slight reduction in some solute clearances. The decrement, however, was minor (5 to 8%), whereas the rise in Hct was marked (55 and 65%) in the transfused and EPO-treated groups, respectively. More importantly, linear regression analysis of kd/kb ratios versus Hct indicated that a rise of Hct from 20 to 40% would reduce creatinine and phosphate clearance by 8 and 13%, respectively. By contrast, assessment of the absolute amount of solute removed in the spent dialysate failed to detect differences between the two study periods. Additionally, a rise in Hct also did not affect urea kinetic parameters including kt/V and PCR. Based on these data, it appears prudent to increase hemodialysis prescription by 10 to 15% when Hct is raised to near 40% to avoid excessive retention of molecules with slow transcellular movement.\r"

Morphologically and ultrastructurally, the cells formed a homogeneous population. They were polygonal when confluent and devoid of contaminating fibroblasts, endothelial cells and macrophages. Cultured mesothelial cells co-expressed cytokeratin and vimentin and synthesized laminin, fibronectin, mesosecrin, non-specific esterase and collagen Types I and III but not Type IV. Ultrastructural features included numerous surface microvilli, cytoplasmic vesicles and an abundant endoplasmic reticulum. The stimulation of mesothelial cells by the calcium ionophore A23187 demonstrated that the two major products of arachidonic acid metabolism were prostacyclin and prostaglandin E2. The peritoneal mesothelial cell may be pivotal in the initiation of the inflammatory response during peritonitis and its establishment in culture will provide the basis for an in vitro model of peritoneal inflammation.\r"

The ratio of tumor uptake of the porphyrin compounds compared to the tumor-bed musculature and skin was favorable with both saline and liposome delivery. Rhodamine-123 precipitated in saline but was delivered effectively throughout the body in liposomes. There was no selective uptake by tumor cells of Rh-123 in this tumor model. Skin phototoxicity with the porphyrin compounds was mildly decreased using liposomes carriers while Rh-123 demonstrated no skin phototoxicity. DHE had the greatest tumoricidal effect among the porphyrin compounds. PHE has the potential of increased effect due to the ability to use higher light dosages in the activation of this porphyrin. Rhodamine-123 had no tumor effect in this animal model. Clinical implications of phototherapy with these four compounds are addressed.\r"

Because cochlear implants are still in the process of development, a detailed evaluation of the results of implantation is essential. However, the capability of predetermining the auditory benefit of a cochlear implant is limited and depends upon a number of factors. This report focuses upon the ability of computed tomography (CT) to predict surgical success and audiological results of multichannel cochlear implantation. It also addresses how the disease state might affect the functional benefit of the implant. After undergoing routine clinical and audiological evaluations, 28 cochlear implant candidates underwent CT scans in order to evaluate cochlear patency prior to surgery. Subsequently, 24 patients were implanted with either a single-or 22-channel device. Surgical findings were noted and postoperative audiological assessments of sound detection and speech discrimination were made. The CT risk factors that diminish the likelihood of a successful cochlear implant result are discussed based upon a retrospective comparison of preoperative CT results, surgical findings, and postsurgical audiological evaluations of the 14 patients who received a 22-channel implant. Analysis of the predictive capability of CT will allow clinicians to use that procedure more effectively in the presurgical assessment of cochlear implant candidates.\r"

  ".W": "Hearing results and extrusion rate for 89 consecutive patients receiving hydroxylapatite prostheses for hearing reconstruction were evaluated and compared to a control group of 75 patients who had received homograft bone or Plasti-Pore prostheses. At the 3-month follow-up, there were no cases of extrusion of the hydroxylapatite prostheses. Hearing success was defined as a postoperative air-bone gap of less than or equal to 15 dB for incus prostheses and partial ossicular replacement prostheses or less than or equal to 25 dB for incus-stapes prostheses and total ossicular replacement prostheses. There was a statistically significant difference in the distribution-of-success rate by prosthesis type for the hydroxylapatite. Incus, incus-stapes, and total ossicular replacement prosthesis results were similar, but partial ossicular replacement prosthesis results were poorer. The overall success rate in the hydroxylapatite group was 51.2%; in the control group, it was 60%. Hearing results tended to be better with the hydroxylapatite incus prosthesis than with the homograft bone incus, but poorer with the hydroxylapatite partial ossicular replacement prosthesis than with the Plasti-Pore. Several technical modifications of the prosthesis that may improve results with the hydroxylapatite partial ossicular replacement prosthesis are suggested. Hydroxylapatite middle ear prostheses appear to be a reasonable alternative to other more commonly used prostheses, which carry disadvantages related to the use of human tissue.\r"

The procedure is done under general anesthesia; a wide postauricular exposure is made and the external auditory canal is maximally enlarged until the vertical portion of the facial nerve is identified. This gives an excellent view of the round window niche. Our results indicate vertigo was completely cured in 80% of the cases and improved in 17%. There has been no incidence of total hearing loss in the last 49 cases and only 3 of 49 patients (6%) had sensorineural loss. Although singular neurectomy can be mastered, it will remain a procedure done by few surgeons. The wide exposure technique is safer for preservation of cochlear function and the posterior ampullary nerve is easier to find than using the transmeatal approach as described by Gacek.\r"

Common histopathologic changes in the cochlea, although complex, included atrophy of the organ of Corti and loss of cochlear neurons. Loss of cochlear neurons was the main finding in ears of viral infection. Labyrinthine fibrosis and formation of new bone were seen in two ears associated with vascular insult and in two ears of autoimmune disease. Different histopathologic findings causing SHL were observed even in cases with the same etiology. A case of SHL showing endolymphatic hydrops as the main histopathologic finding is described.\r"

An interindividual variation was found, ranging from severe hearing loss after the first course to unaffected hearing after three courses.

The cricoid cartilage, the hyoid bone, and at least one arytenoid cartilage are spared. Sixty-eight patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the supraglottis who underwent this procedure during the period from 1974 through 1986 are presented. Conventional horizontal supraglottic laryngectomy was contraindicated in all cases. All but three patients (95.4%) recovered physiologic deglutition, and none required a permanent tracheostomy. The 3-year actuarial survival rate was 71.4%. No local recurrences were encountered. The indications for the procedure are carcinomas of the supraglottis that 1. involve the glottis and anterior commissure, 2. invade the ventricle, 3. present with a marked limitation of true vocal cord mobility (transglottic lesions), and 4. invade the thyroid cartilage. The procedure is presented as a useful alternative to radiation therapy, horizontal supraglottic laryngectomy, and total laryngectomy in select cases of supraglottic carcinoma.\r"

Five-year survival rates of T-cell and B-cell lymphoma were 12.5% and 75%, respectively. Polyclonal keratin and tissue polypeptide antigen were more sensitive and specific than other epithelial markers, and were positive in 97% (56 of 58) and 93% (54 of 58) of carcinomas, respectively. With regard to immunophenotypic analysis of malignant lymphomas, L26 to B-cells (88%) and UCHL1 to T-cells (100%) led to a satisfactory effect. Immunohistochemical investigations made possible differentiation of malignant lymphomas from a carcinoma and also aided in typing the latter.\r"

The patients were interviewed regarding signs of dysfunction of the cricothyroid muscles, or a diminished external tensor effect on the vocal folds. Laryngoscopy with a magnifying-angled endoscope, stroboscopy, phonetography, determination of mean speaking fundamental frequency, perceptual analysis of the voice, and electromyogram of the cricothyroid muscle were all performed. Four patients had signs of diminished external tensor effect on the vocal folds (mild or moderate voice dysfunction), 5 patients had other voice disorders, and 10 were classified as having normal voice.

  ".W": "A quantitative study was made of the number of fibers, their diameters, and distribution in the nerves innervating individual vestibular receptor organs of three human temporal bones. The specimens were obtained from autopsies conducted within 4 hours postmortem. The temporal bones containing the nerves were fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde and decalcified with EDTA until they were soft enough to allow dissection of the nerve branches to the individual receptors. The nerve branches were processed for osmium staining, embedded in plastic, and cut serially in 1-micron-thick sections for light-microscopic histologic evaluation of their fiber composition. Quantitative evaluation of nerve-fiber characteristics was made with the aid of a laboratory computer and programs for graphic representation and statistical analysis. In the nerves to the individual cristae the number of fibers ranged between 1416 and 2335. Fibers with diameters between 2.5 microns and 3 microns were the most numerous. The number of fibers decreased exponentially with increased size. The thickest fibers had diameters up to 11.5 microns. The distribution of fibers in the nerve of each crista was different for the central and intermediate areas of the crista than it was for the ends. Thin fibers with diameters less than 2.5 microns, which represented 36% of the population, projected to the ends of the receptor area. Thick fibers with diameters greater than 4.5 microns, which represented 8% of the fibers, were distributed relatively uniformly except for the extreme ends of the crista, where they were nearly absent. Fibers with intermediate diameters were distributed throughout the crista, although they were more concentrated at the ends. In the nerves to three maculae, the number of fibers ranged from 3744 to 5538. The percentage of fibers of each size, however, was similar to that in the cristae. The greater portion of fibers had diameters between 3.0 microns and 3.5 microns. Because of the anatomical configuration of the maculae, it was not possible to compare fiber diameters from one area to another. The composition and differential projection of fibers to the crista in the human labyrinth were similar to those found earlier in squirrel monkeys and bullfrogs. On the basis of these similarities in the pattern of innervation, it is suggested that the physiological properties in humans must be similar to those in animals.\r"

Five animals underwent intratracheal bacterial inoculation using Staphylococcus aureus, six rabbits were given prophylactic antibiotics, and five control animals received neither bacteria nor antibiotics. After 10 days the rabbits were assessed for both tracheal stenosis and bacterial infection within the respiratory tree. Animals receiving antibiotic prophylaxis had a mean stenosis of 50.8%, similar to the 63.4% observed in controls. Rabbits inoculated with SA had a mean stenosis of 85.0%, greater than both the other groups (P = .001:ANOVA). Considering all animals, those with respiratory infection (including two control rabbits) had narrower stenoses than those that remained noninfected (82.1% versus 52.5%; P = .001). These data suggest that bacterial infection in the upper respiratory tract might increase the severity of airway stenosis following prolonged endotracheal intubation.\r"

All 16 patients were initially managed conservatively with closed-wound drainage and low-fat nutritional support; this was successful in only 4 patients, 3 of whom had peak 24-hour chyle drainage of less than 600 cc. The remaining 10 patients required open-wound management, which included operative ligation in 4 instances. Continued conservative treatment with an open neck wound resulted in significant additional hospitalization. Our experience indicates that closed-wound management of a chyle fistula is likely to fail when peak 24-hour fistula output exceeds 600 cc. Considering the cost and morbidity of conservative treatment, early reoperation may be appropriate in those patients with high fistula output.\r"

Snoring occurs in 100% of patients with obstructive sleep apnea and, for selected patients, is treatable by surgery. Snoring can, however, mean different things to different patients and physicians. Five atypical cases of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome are presented in which laryngeal dysfunction played a role in producing symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Recording nocturnal sounds during sleep and examining the entire upper respiratory tract may be important in determining appropriate medical or surgical management.\r"

  ".U": "90301150\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The identification of ischemic but viable myocardium by thallium exercise scintigraphy is often imprecise, since many of the perfusion defects that develop in ischemic myocardium during exercise do not \"fill in\" on subsequent redistribution images. We hypothesized that a second injection of thallium given after the redistribution images were taken might improve the detection of ischemic but viable myocardium. METHODS. We studied 100 patients with coronary artery disease, using thallium exercise tomographic imaging and radionuclide angiography. Patients received 2 mCi of thallium intravenously during exercise, redistribution imaging was performed three to four hours later, and a second dose of 1 mCi of thallium was injected at rest immediately thereafter. The three sets of images (stress, redistribution, and reinjection) were then analyzed. RESULTS. Ninety-two of the 100 patients had exercise-induced perfusion defects. Of the 260 abnormal myocardial regions identified by stress imaging, 85 (33 percent) appeared to be irreversible on redistribution imaging three to four hours later. However, 42 of these apparently irreversible defects (49 percent) demonstrated improved or normal thallium uptake after the second injection of thallium, with an increase in mean regional uptake from 56 +/- 12 percent on redistribution studies to 64 +/- 10 percent on reinjection imaging (P less than 0.001). Twenty patients were restudied three to six months after coronary angioplasty. Of the 15 myocardial regions with defects on redistribution studies that were identified as viable by reinjection studies before angioplasty, 13 (87 percent) had normal thallium uptake and improved regional wall motion after angioplasty. In contrast, all eight regions with persistent defects on reinjection imaging before angioplasty had abnormal thallium uptake and abnormal regional wall motion after angioplasty. CONCLUSIONS. These data indicate that the reinjection of thallium improves the detection of ischemic myocardium and that myocardial regions with improved thallium uptake on reinjection imaging represent viable but jeopardized myocardium.\r"

The patients' ages at presentation ranged from 19 to 49 years, with a mean of 32 years. All four patients underwent attempted embolization procedures. Two patients had transarterial embolization, one with balloons and liquid adhesives, one with platinum coils and a balloon; the carotid artery was preserved in one and sacrificed in one other. In one patient, who underwent direct puncture of the carotid artery, a massive hematoma causing airway compromise required intubation and emergent surgical repair. The fistula spontaneously closed during this event. In the fourth patient, two transvenous embolizations resulted in markedly decreased flow, but diversion of residual flow to cortical veins produced a fatal pontine hemorrhage. The vascular fragility associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can produce spontaneous direct carotid-cavernous fistulas and makes both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures more difficult.\r"

We have had the opportunity to study two patients with GSAs, which has allowed for a complete comparative anatomical and radiological study. This report emphasizes the etiology of the GSAs. Twenty-two patients with GSAs have been reported in the literature, of which pathological studies were done in 10. In most of these, the aneurysm was found to be filled with an organized thrombus, but in our patients the aneurysm was filled with relatively new clot. The aneurysm enlarged and a change in the tortuous vascular channel was observed over a period of 1 year in the first patient, whereas a globoid aneurysm developed into a GSA in the brief period of just 2 weeks in the second patient. This rapid transformation of a globoid aneurysm into a GSA is of particular interest when the etiology of GSAs is considered. Our patients therefore shed some interesting light on the possible pathophysiology of GSAs. That is, the bloodstream may change dynamically in a giant aneurysm and may become a serpentine channel under conditions that lead to a \"Coanda effect.\"\r"

Intraventricular meningiomas do occur more frequently in infancy than in adulthood, although the establishment and growth of such tumors in the fourth ventricle is exceptional in children. The occurrence of multiple meningiomas is currently estimated to be less than 8%. We present the case of a girl who displayed two meningiomas in the fourth ventricle. Five years later, the child had four more meningiomas detected and extirpated from the same site. Eighteen months later, a new tumor appeared in the lower third of the clivus; after resection this was found to be another meningioma. The presence in a child of the repeated occurrence of multiple meningiomas, both in the fourth ventricle and in other areas of the posterior fossa, have led the authors to consider that the case is both curious and rare. Twelve similar cases of meningiomas developing exclusively in the fourth ventricle have been published; of these, only 3 occurred during infancy. A discussion is offered concerning the etiology and pathogenesis of these tumors; in which the possibility of unknown neuro-oncogenic factors that might induce meningiomas is postulated.\r"

  ".W": "Adenoid cystic carcinoma (cylindroma) usually arises from the salivary, lacrimal, or other exocrine glands, and is rarely encountered by neurosurgeons. The authors describe three cases involving intracranial extension. An intraorbital tumor in a 71-year-old man extended directly into the epidural space of the frontal base and destroyed the orbital roof. In a 53-year-old woman, the tumor arose from the area adjacent to the eustachian tube and invaded the Gasserian ganglion. In the third patient, a 58-year-old man, the tumor originated in the maxillary sinus and extended directly into the middle cranial fossa. In all these cases, the tumors were removed to the fullest extent possible. Although residual tumor was markedly reduced by radiation therapy, recurrence and metastases occurred within a few years. Thus, adenoid cystic carcinoma appears to be radiosensitive, but not curable by irradiation. In treating a recurrent tumor in one patient, we applied the so-called \"two-route\" chemotherapy (cisplatin and its antidote) in combination with radiation therapy. The tumor responded well to this therapy, although multiple pulmonary and bone metastases eventually led to the patient's death.\r"

It was clear that a single approach was not capable of providing access to all parts of the sinus. The intracavernous structures best exposed by each route are reviewed. The osseous relationships in the region were examined in dry skulls. Anatomic variants important in exposing the cavernous sinus are reviewed.\r"

Ten of the 20 ICCAAns were asymptomatic at diagnosis, and 10 were symptomatic. Three of the asymptomatic ICCAAns were symptomatic at follow-up. One of these required clipping because of a progressing cavernous sinus syndrome; the other 2 were minimally symptomatic and have not required treatment. Of the 10 initially symptomatic ICCAAns, 2 had not changed, 4 became more symptomatic, and 4 had symptomatically improved by follow-up. One patient with an ICCAAn that had not changed clinically was lost to follow-up 6 months after diagnosis. Of the 4 ICCAAns that became more symptomatic, 2 continue to be monitored, and 2 required intervention: one with detachable balloon occlusion of the aneurysm with preservation of the internal carotid artery lumen, and the other with gradual cervical internal carotid artery occlusion. The clinical course of this selected group of patients with ICCAAns suggests that the natural history of ICCAAns can be quite variable. Although clinical progression does occur, symptomatic ICCAAns also can improve spontaneously. Therapeutic intervention for asymptomatic ICCAAns should be reserved for patients with aneurysms arising at the anterior genu of the carotid siphon and/or extending into the subarachnoid space, where subarachnoid hemorrhage is most likely. Intervention for symptomatic ICCAAns should be reserved for patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, epistaxis, severe facial or orbital pain, evidence of radiographic enlargement, progressive ophthalmoplegia, or progressive visual loss.\r"

Examination of cerebral arteries from normal individuals revealed a dense network of fine reticular fibers in the arterial media that were uniformly distributed. Computerized morphometric analysis indicated that reticular fibers in the arterial media of cerebral arteries were significantly decreased in patients with aneurysms. In addition, these fibers were irregularly distributed and shortened when compared to those seen in control arteries. In both patients with aneurysms and control patients, elastin fibers were limited almost exclusively to the internal elastin lamina. No differences were observed in the appearance or content of elastin fibers in control patients and patients with aneurysm. Although other explanations cannot be excluded, these observations are consistent with the hypothesis that \"intrinsic\" abnormalities in the walls of cerebral arteries lead to conditions that favor the formation and rupture of cerebral aneurysms.\r"

Although extensive pituitary hemorrhage often produced fulminant apoplexy, it also presented insidiously over many days with few, if any, clinical signs. Rapid diagnosis, endocrine replacement, and transsphenoidal decompression constituted effective therapy. Magnetic resonance imaging (after at least 12 hours of symptoms) was superior to computed tomography in detecting hemorrhage.\r"

  ".W": "Paralysis seen in children with myelomeningocele has been attributed to congenital myelodysplasia. We suspected that paralysis may be due in part to a spinal cord injury caused by exposure of the neural tube to the amniotic fluid. This hypothesis was tested using a fetal rat model of surgically created dysraphism. Each pup from the experimental group of rats in which the spinal cord was intentionally exposed to the amniotic fluid was born with severe deformity and weakness of the hind limbs and tail. Control fetal rats, subjected to the same procedure without directly exposing the spinal cord to the intrauterine environment, were normal at birth. Histological studies of the exposed spinal cord revealed extensive erosion and necrosis, findings similar to those described in children with myelomeningocele. We therefore propose a \"two-hit\" hypothesis to explain the paralysis seen in children with myelomeningocele: congenital myelodysplasia complicated by an intrauterine spinal cord injury. Intrauterine protection of the exposed spinal cord might prevent some or all of the paralysis. The possible implications of these findings for the future treatment of myelomeningocele are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of the volatile anesthetic isoflurane (Forane) on motor evoked potentials was examined in rats. To record motor evoked potentials, single-shock electrical stimulation was delivered to the forelimb representation of the motor cortex. This resulted in elicitation of a compound muscle action potential from the contralateral extensor muscles. The effect of isoflurane was examined at various concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 1.5%. With increasing concentrations of isoflurane there was a progressive increase in onset latency of the compound muscle action potential and a decrease in peak-to-peak amplitude and duration. Latencies were significantly increased over baseline values for concentrations of isoflurane from 0.5 to 1.5% (P values were 0.001 to 0.007). For the amplitude and the duration, responses at 0.5 to 1.5% isoflurane were significantly lower than baseline (P values were 0.001 to 0.007). We conclude that isoflurane anesthesia significantly changes the muscle response evoked by motor cortex stimulation in experimental animals.\r"

  ".U": "90301271\r", 
  ".W": "Lumboperitoneal (LP) shunting has the advantage of completely extracranial surgical management, minimizing intracranial complications. An LP shunt has been intentionally adopted for patients who require cerebrospinal fluid diversion. A retrospective study was designed to examine the indications for and complications associated with LP shunts in 207 patients (including 28 pediatric patients) treated during the past 11 years. Follow-up averaging 5.1 years revealed no deaths related directly to LP shunt placement. Twenty-nine patients (14%) underwent revision of the shunt because of obstruction. Shunt-related infections were observed in only 2 patients (1%). Radicular pain occurred in 10 patients (5%), 2 of whom required shunt replacement. Postoperative occurrence of dyspnea and disturbance of consciousness necessitated conversion to a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt in 2 patients (1%), who subsequently were noted to have Chiari malformations. In 4 patients (2%), an acute subdural hematoma developed after mild head trauma. Symptomatic chronic subdural hematomas were observed in 2 patients (1%). One patient had a mild myelopathy that rapidly resolved after shunt replacement. The comparison to 120 patients treated with a VP shunt during the identical period (an average follow-up of 5.2 years) suggests the following conclusions. After subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by a ruptured aneurysm, hydrocephalus is usually of the communicating type and is an indication for an LP shunt. The incidence of infection and malfunction with an LP shunt is significantly lower than that with a VP shunt. An LP shunt is also indicated for pediatric patients, although a relatively higher incidence of malfunction is noted compared to adults.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Calc produced the greatest contrast between the choroidal and retinal vasculature. Tissue staining and dye leakage into the vitreous immediately after retinal photocoagulation were minimal with Calc, moderate with CF, and marked with Naf. The limited leakage and longer circulation time of Calc may permit simultaneous angiography and photocoagulation therapy without obscuring the fundus view with leaking dye from the photocoagulated structure.\r"

Radiation emitted by either a pseudocontinuous cw Nd:YAG laser (with a dynamic range of 10 W) or by an air-cooled 4-W argon ion laser energy source either may be transmitted via fiber optics into the main unit or, when detached from the main unit, may be used independently. Energy emitted by the modules and transported by specialized light cables and delivery systems can be used to perform transscleral Nd:YAG laser irradiation of the ciliary body or the choroid and retina. Probes are available for endocoagulation of the latter two by either cw Nd:YAG or argon laser light. Other probes are being developed for chorioretinotomy, internal sclerostomy, dissection of the sclera, or for other extrabulbar work. All functions are monitored and displayed by a central processor.\r"

During an average of 23.1 months' follow-up (range, 13 to 48 months) there was no exacerbation of the preexisting uveitis in any of the eyes. Postoperative visual acuity in all eyes was better than it was preoperatively, although further procedures were required in some eyes: a pars plana vitrectomy in one, a surgical peripheral iridectomy in one, and Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy in 10. Our results suggest that selected uveitis patients can tolerate and benefit from an ECCE and IOL implantation.\r"

  ".W": "In an attempt to enhance its pressure-lowering and fibroblast inhibiting effects, we administered 0.15 cc of 24 mg/ml dexamethasone, intra-Tenon's, directly over the fistula site following 16 consecutive filtering surgeries. The encapsulation rate in these eyes was 56% (9/15), as compared with 10% (2/20) in a retrospectively matched group of eyes that had undergone filtering surgery with dexamethasone given subconjunctivally 180 degrees away from the filter site. The effective concentration of dexamethasone achieved by the injections at the filter site apparently did not maintain the fibroblast inhibitory drug level and, in fact, supported fibroblastic growth, resulting in increased encapsulation. Because of the increased encapsulation rate and the lack of any demonstrable benefit associated with it, we do not recommend intralesional dexamethasone in filtering surgery. Commercial topical steroids with their lower concentrations also may act to promote rather than inhibit fibroblast growth. Prolonged steroid use after filtering surgery beyond the inflammatory phase of wound healing (about 2 weeks) may increase fibrosis in the area of the filter, resulting in a thick-walled bleb with few microcysts, one form of which is frank encapsulation. Thus, we recommend that topical steroids routinely be stopped by the third postoperative week if the level of inflammation permits.\r"

  ".W": "The TATA binding protein, TFIID, plays a central role in the initiation of eukaryotic mRNA synthesis. Here, we present a human cDNA clone for this factor. Comparison of its predicted protein sequence with those from Drosophila and yeast reveals a highly conserved carboxyl-terminal 180 amino acids. By contrast, the amino-terminal region of TFIID has diverged in both sequence and length. A striking feature of the human protein is a stretch of 38 glutamine residues in the NH2-terminal region. Expression of human TFIID in both Escherichia coli and HeLa cells produces a protein that binds specifically to a TATA box and promotes basal transcription; the conserved COOH-terminal portion of the protein is sufficient for both of these activities. Recombinant TFIID forms a stable complex on a TATA box either alone or in combination with either of the general transcription factors, TFIIA or TFIIB. Full-length recombinant TFIID is able to support Sp1 activated transcription in a TFIID-depleted nuclear extract, while a deletion of the NH2-terminal half of the protein is not. These results indicate the importance of the NH2-terminal region for upstream activation functions and suggest that additional factors (co-activators) are required for mediating interactions with specific regulators.\r"

This binding depended on the Fab and not the Fc portion of Ig and was independent of the light chain. Soluble rCD4, HIV gp120, and sulfated dextrans inhibited the CD4-Ig interaction. With the use of a panel of synthetic peptides, the region critical for binding to Ig was localized to amino acids 21 to 38 of the first extracellular domain of CD4. CD4-bound antibody (Ab) complexed with antigen approximately 100 times better than Ab alone. This activity may contribute to the Ab-mediated enhancement of cellular HIV interaction that appears to depend on a trimolecular complex of HIV, antibodies to gp120, and CD4.\r"

Generation of these events is triggered by the tyrosine protein kinase (TPK) activity of the PDGF receptor. The TPK inhibitor genistein blocked PDGF induction of these events, including DNA synthesis, with the exception of receptor down regulation. PDGF-induced phosphotyrosine phosphorylations, including receptor autophosphorylation, were inhibited by genistein. Removal of genistein and PDGF resulted in DNA synthesis without the occurrence of PLC activation. These findings indicate that these early events, with the exception of receptor down regulation, are not necessary for PDGF-induced DNA synthesis.\r"

In eight patients with osseous fusion radiographically, the sagittal and the vertical translations between the fused vertebral segments began to decrease after 3 to 6 months. However, the time for rigid fusion as defined by RSA varied between 3 months and 1 year, and in four patients sagittal/vertical translations of mostly less than 1 mm still persisted at 1 year postoperatively. In three patients with poor fusion radiographically, no rigid fusion as defined by RSA was obtained. Sagittal/vertical translations of 1 to 10 mm persisted at 1 year postoperatively in these patients. The preoperative pain disappeared in all patients except in one who had osseous fusion radiographically but persisting translations after 1 year.\r"

Sagittal translatory movements were found in both groups, but the amount of displacement was significantly larger (P less than 0.001) in the patient group as compared with the controls. The average displacement in the patient group, using a relative measurement technique, was 5.2%, ranging from 0.2 to 15.4%; and the corresponding values in the controls resulted in a mean of 0.8% and a range of -2.3% to 3.6%. Eighteen of the 29 patients (62%) exhibited translations of the lytic vertebra exceeding the largest displacement (greater than 3.6%) detected in the control group. The translatory movements in the patients were composed of a predominant anterior displacement in the compression view and a smaller posterior movement in the traction view. Analysis of sagittal rotation, ie, angulatory movements in the L5-S1 segment, resulted in no significant difference between the two groups. Compression-traction radiography may detect pathologic translatory movements, indicative of lumbar segmental instability.\r"

The nonprotruded discs of each level were used as controls of the protruded discs of the same level. The transverse interfacet angle, the inclination and curvature of the facet joints, and the frequency of asymmetric facet joints showed no significant differences, whether there was a disc protrusion or not. The magnitude of the asymmetry was significantly greater only at the L4-L5 interspace in cases of disc protrusion. However, taking into consideration the error of measurement, the difference becomes highly questionable. These results do not indicate any relation between facet joint asymmetry and protrusion of the intervertebral disc.\r"

Prone position on bolsters was used in 216 cases, 192 of which were primary operations, and a frame-supported kneeling position in 220, 203 of which were primary operations. The mean blood losses in prone versus kneeling positions in the primary operations were 376 ml and 150 ml, respectively (P less than 0.001), and the mean operating times were 74 minutes and 52 minutes, respectively (P less than 0.001). The 99% confidence interval for the difference between the mean operating times was from 15 to 29 minutes. A moderate nonlinear positive correlation was found between intraoperative blood loss and operating time. No intraoperative complications attributable to the position of the patient emerged. On the basis of the findings in this study, the use of kneeling position is strongly advocated.\r"

Fifty-one percent of the women in the prevalence group experienced an increase in their LBP during menstruation. For the purpose of an analysis of covariance, the population was divided by age into those aged 38 to 49 years and those 50 to 64 years of age. A higher number of abortions was found to be directly associated to LBP in 38- to 49-year-old women.

These differences could be explained by a natural selection of individuals with the physical constitution required for the sport concerned, but they may also be a long-term effect of training.

The three-dimensional facet geometry of 35 L2-3 and 35 L4-5 specimens has been quantified in terms of seven parameters from computed tomographic transverse sections taken at 2-mm intervals. The motion segments have then been subjected to axial torque, for a variety of preload conditions, to establish the axial torque-rotation response. There exists significant variation of facet geometry between the segment levels; however, the degree of facet asymmetry is identical for each level. No significant correlation exists between the lumbar facet geometry and the axial torque-rotation response. The facet joints do, however, act as a \"positive stop\" to axial rotation, regardless of their orientation. Therefore, axial rotation sufficient to cause disc injury may only be possible after facet failure.\r"

The vertebra-disc-vertebra units were subjected to intentional controlled dehydration to enhance the visual contrast between the white opaque fiber bundles and the translucent ground substance. The variations of the anulus structure with circumferential and radial locations were studied. The following principal structural features were quantified: 1) the anulus, excluding the transition zone, consists of 15 to 25 distinct layers, depending on the circumferential location, the spine level, and the specimen age; 2) in any 20 degrees circumferential sector, nearly half of the layers terminate or originate, thereby causing local laminate irregularities; 3) there are two identifiable mechanisms of layer interruption at these irregularities; 4) the thickness of individual layers varies both circumferentially and radially and increases markedly with age; and 5) the number of fiber bundles over the total height of the disc varies from 20 to 62, with an average interbundle spacing of 0.22 mm.\r"

Three independent observers tested the reproducibility of the procedure by assignment of grades blindly to duplicate images of 68 discs taken from 15 spines. The intraobserver agreement ranged from 87 to 91%. The interobserver agreement was 61, 64, and 88% for the three pairs, the two low values being attributable to the bias of one observer. The agreement between the assigned and average grades was 85, 92, 68, 90, and 76% for Grades I through V, respectively. Except for Grade III, the disagreements were attributable mainly to the bias of one observer. Both the increase in the grade with age and the finding that all the discs within 14 of 15 spines had a narrow range of grades demonstrated the biologic credibility of the scheme.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of a rapid (0.05-0.1 seconds) and a slow (20 seconds) onset rate of cauda equina compression on impulse propagation, in terms of tail muscle electromyogram (EMG) amplitude, were analyzed in an experimental model of the pig cauda equina. Sham compression and compression at 50 mm Hg at either rapid or slow onset induced no or only minor functional impairment. Compression at 100 or 200 mm Hg induced impairment of the impulse propagation that was proportional to the applied pressure. The effects were more pronounced (P less than 0.01) for the rapid than for the slow onset of compression at both these pressure levels. An important factor for this observed difference in effects between the two employed onset rates seems to be the magnitude of intraneural edema formed outside the compression zone.\r"

The bracing led to marked decrease in lung volumes, below functions, and CO transfer factor, moderate rise in resting O2 intake, CO2 output and ventilation, and marked rise in ventilatory and O2 cost of exercise, probably due to increased dead space ventilation and O2 cost of breathing. However, repeated studies after 1 day without brace, 6 months after onset of bracing, showed no persistent deterioration of pulmonary function or disturbances of gas exchange, as compared with the pre-bracing state.\r"

Thirty-nine patients were studied preoperatively and postoperatively using segmental radiologic measurements including Cobb angle, end-vertebra angles (EVAs), surgical flexibility index, vertebral rotation, displacement and tilt, convex and concave rib-vertebra angles (RVAs), and kyphosis and lordosis. Cotrel-Dubousset is not significantly different from HL with respect to Cobb angle (%), surgical flexibility index, apical vertebral displacement, apical vertebral rotation, apical rib-vertebra angles, kyphosis, and lordosis. It is significantly better than the HL with respect to the correction of vertebral displacement at T10-11; lower EVA of the thoracic curve; vertebral rotation mainly above the apex; convex RVAs above the apex; and concave RVAs at T10. The surgical correction of vertebral tilt above and below the apex of the thoracic curve is significantly related to the correction of convex and concave RVAs. The view that persistent deformity of ribs is a factor needing surgical correction in some patients with adolescent idiopathic thoracic scoliosis having posterior instrumentation and fusion needs further evaluation.\r"

To examine the possibility of beta-adrenoceptor desensitization due to intraoperative adrenergic activation (surgical stress), the alterations of human lymphocyte beta-adrenergic receptor density and affinity observed after anesthesia and surgery were studied using (-)125I-iodocyanopindolol binding in 19 patients undergoing noncardiac surgical procedures with general anesthesia (thiopental, fentanyl, and halothane or isoflurane). In 13 patients, repeated determinations of plasma levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine showed an increase during the surgical procedure (norepinephrine +60%; epinephrine +60%); this change was not observed in the remaining patients. A significant postoperative increase in receptor density (Bmax +25%) and a significant decrease of receptor affinity for isoproterenol (IC50 +22%) were found in the patients who experienced intraoperative adrenergic activation. By contrast, no significant change in beta-receptor density or affinity was found in the patients who had normal intraoperative adrenergic activation. In addition, heart rate responses to the postoperative changes in plasma catecholamines (an index of cardiac sensitivity to agonist) were significantly attenuated in patients who experienced both intraoperative adrenergic activation and a decrease in affinity of beta-receptor for agonist, suggesting hyporesponsiveness to beta stimulation. We conclude that beta-adrenergic receptors and, consequently, beta-adrenergic responsiveness might be altered by perioperative adrenergic activation in surgical patients.\r"

  ".W": "We were interested in determining the infusion rate of mivacurium required to maintain approximately 95% neuromuscular blockade during nitrous oxide-halothane (0.8% end-tidal) or nitrous oxide-narcotic anesthesia. Neuromuscular blockade was monitored by recording the electromyographic activity (Datex NMT) of the adductor pollicis muscle resulting from supramaximal stimulation of the ulnar nerve at 2 Hz for 2 s at 10-s intervals. Mivacurium steady-state infusion requirements averaged 315 +/- 26 micrograms.m-2.min-1 during nitrous oxide-halothane anesthesia and 375 +/- 19 micrograms.m-2.min-1 (mean +/- SEM) during nitrous oxide-narcotic anesthesia. Higher levels of pseudocholinesterase activity were generally associated with a higher mivacurium infusion requirement. During both anesthetics, younger age was associated with a higher infusion requirement when the infusion requirement was calculated in terms of micrograms.kg-1.min-1. This difference was not present when the infusion rate was calculated in terms of micrograms.m-2.m-1. There was no evidence of cumulation during prolonged mivacurium infusion. There was no difference in the rates of spontaneous or reversal-mediated recovery between anesthetic groups. After the termination of the infusion, spontaneous recovery to T4/T1 greater than or equal to 0.75 occurred in 9.8 +/- 0.4 min, with a recovery index, T25-75, of 4.0 +/- 0.2 min (mean +/- SEM). In summary, pseudocholinesterase activity is the major factor influencing mivacurium infusion rate in children during nitrous oxide-narcotic or nitrous oxide-halothane (0.8% end-tidal) anesthesia.\r"

  ".W": "Under halothane anesthesia five dogs were prepared with both hindlimbs isolated from the systemic circulation to allow intermittent placement on extracorporeal perfusion at constant flow. One limb of each dog was surgically denervated. In this relatively anesthetic-free preparation, graded equivalent doses of alfentanil, fentanyl, and sufentanil were infused over 30 s, and vascular resistance was measured. Increasing opioid administration caused a progressive diminution in peripheral resistance. By the high dose level, alfentanil (500 micrograms/kg), fentanyl (50 micrograms/kg), and sufentanil (6 micrograms/kg) caused equal and significant decreases of 48%, 48%, and 44% in resistance, respectively. There was no difference among the opioids in effects on resistance at equivalent dosages. Neither pretreatment with naloxone nor denervation changed the response to the narcotics. We conclude that the three synthetic opioids produce vasodilation by direct action on the peripheral vascular smooth muscle.\r"

The rabbit placenta perfused in situ on the fetal side was used, and antipyrine (phenazone) was included as an index of placental exchange and of maternal placental flow. Bupivacaine and meperidine (both 1.25 mg/mL) and antipyrine (4 mg/mL) were infused into a maternal external jugular vein, at 3 mL/h, after loading, in seven anesthetized does. A single placenta in each doe was perfused via the umbilical arteries with Krebs' bicarbonate buffer at pH 7.5 (phase 1), 7.0 (phase 2), and 7.5 (phases 3-5). During phase 4 maternal blood was withdrawn so as to reduce maternal arterial pressure by 35%, and in phase 5 it was reinfused. Concentrations of drugs were measured during each of the five phases in maternal arterial plasma (Cma) and in the effluent perfusate collected from the umbilical vein (Cuv). From these data, placental clearance rates (Cuv x umbilical flow/Cma) were calculated for each drug at each phase. Clearance of bupivacaine and meperidine increased (P less than 0.03) during phase 2, whereas that of antipyrine did not. Clearance of meperidine and antipyrine, but not of bupivacaine, decreased during phase 4. If these results can be extrapolated to the clinical situation, they suggest that the adverse effects of drugs may well be exacerbated in the presence of fetal compromise.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of propofol on cerebral blood flow, cerebral metabolism, and cerebrovascular autoregulatory capability. Seven anesthetized baboons were given propofol at three different infusion rates. An infusion of 3 mg.kg-1.h-1 caused minimal changes, but infusion rates of 6 and 12 mg.kg-1.h-1 decreased cerebral blood flow by 28% and 39%, respectively. The changes in cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen were not statistically significant. However, with the two higher infusion rates, there was a trend toward decrease, by 5% and 22%, respectively, for the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen, and by 18% and 36% for the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose. A 25-30 mm Hg increase in arterial blood pressure had no influence on cerebral blood flow. Replacement of nitrous oxide by nitrogen had no significant influence on cerebral blood flow or metabolism. It is concluded that propofol causes a dose-dependent decrease in cerebral blood flow. However, the study does not prove that this decrease in cerebral blood flow is accompanied by the same degree of decrease in cerebral metabolism. Further studies are clearly needed to clarify propofol's influence on the coupling between cerebral metabolism and blood flow. The physiologic responsiveness of the cerebral circulation to alterations in arterial pressure is well preserved. Propofol appears to prevent the metabolic stimulation and increased cerebral blood flow that has been associated with the administration of nitrous oxide.\r"

In animal preparations, they also abolish succinylcholine-induced twitch augmentation, defined as a greater-than-maximal contraction in response to a single stimulus. To determine quantitatively the effect of dTC on succinylcholine potency and on twitch augmentation in humans, 60 adult patients, ASA physical status I or II, were assigned randomly to receive either 0.05 mg/kg of dTC or saline 2 min before induction of anesthesia with fentanyl and thiopental. Train-of-four stimulation was applied every 12 s to the ulnar nerve and the force of contraction of the adductor pollicis muscle was measured. One minute after induction of anesthesia, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.35, or 0.50 mg/kg of succinylcholine was given. The height of the first twitch (T1) reached 121% +/- 6% (mean +/- SEM) of control without dTC, and was virtually abolished by dTC pretreatment (105% +/- 1%, P less than 0.01). Twitch augmentation was more noticeable with lower doses of succinylcholine, and was not observed in the response to the fourth stimulus of the train of four (T4). The potency of succinylcholine was decreased by approximately one-half in the dTC-pretreated groups. The ED50 was 0.27 +/- 0.04 mg/kg without dTC and 0.50 +/- 0.06 mg/kg with dTC (P less than 0.002). The corresponding values for ED90 were 0.51 +/- 0.07 and 1.02 +/- 0.12 mg/kg, respectively (P less than 0.02). The ED95 values were 0.63 +/- 0.09 and 1.28 +/- 0.15 mg/kg, respectively (P less than 0.02). The slopes of the regression lines did not deviate significantly from parallelism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "R-phenylisopropyl-adenosine, which has an affinity for the adenosine A1 receptor higher than that for the A2 receptor, and N-ethylcarboxamide-adenosine, which has near equal affinity for the A1 and A2 receptors, were injected intrathecally into rats to evaluate differences in antinociceptive effect and motor impairment. Using the tail-immersion test, both compounds had antinociceptive effects. Motor function was evaluated during spontaneous movement in a free space. N-ethylcarboxamide-adenosine rapidly impaired motor function even after low intrathecal doses. R-phenylisopropyl-adenosine also induced motor impairment, but only after high intrathecal doses, and onset was much slower. These results suggest that the receptor selectivity of R-phenylisopropyl-adenosine is diminished at higher doses and that the motor impairment is an A2-receptor-mediated effect. A selective A1 receptor agonist, e.g., R-phenylisopropyl-adenosine, which produces a good antinociceptive effect without motor impairment, is more promising as a drug of possible use for the future treatment of clinical pain.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of alfentanil on the midazolam dose-response curve for hypnosis was studied with response to the verbal command as an end point in 95 patients. The analgesic effect of alfentanil was studied by measuring the threshold for pain caused by pressure on the trapezius muscle with the use of a dolorimeter in 21 patients. The study was randomized, double-blind, and performed on the unpremedicated patients with ASA physical status I or II. Alfentanil was found to reduce the midazolam ED50 value for the induction of anesthesia in a dose-dependent fashion. The smallest dose of alfentanil (3 micrograms/kg) that caused a marked shift of the midazolam dose-response curve to the left along the dose axis (from the ED50 of 270 micrograms/kg to the ED50 of 142 micrograms/kg, P less than 0.0005) represents approximately 2% of the alfentanil ED50 for induction of unconsciousness (130 micrograms/kg). Alfentanil (10 micrograms/kg) caused only a tendency for increase in the pain threshold, whereas a dose of 15 micrograms/kg significantly increased the pain threshold by 37% (P less than 0.05). The results demonstrate that alfentanil potentiates the hypnotic effect of midazolam in very small doses. The high potency of alfentanil in this respect, as compared to its analgesic potency, suggests a very specific mechanism of alfentanil-midazolam hypnotic interaction, one that most likely is based on a functional relationship between the GABA receptor-benzodiazepine receptor system and the opioid receptor system in mediation of hypnosis.\r"

In addition, for halothane, brain/gas partition coefficients (paired samples) were determined at 0.05 MAC and 2 MAC. The values for halothane at 0.05 MAC, 2 MAC, and 5 MAC did not differ; values for isoflurane at 0.05 MAC and 5 MAC did not differ. Over the range of anesthetic partial pressures studied, no evidence for saturable binding was found. We conclude that the solubility of halothane and isoflurane in brain is independent of the partial pressure applied; inhaled anesthetics obey Henry's law.\r"

In series 1, 4-mL venous blood samples were obtained from 15 normal human volunteers. One blood sample served as control, and 1 mL of either of the three contrast media was added in vitro to the other 4-mL blood samples. P50 values were estimated from the linear portion of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve obtained by tonometry. Determinations of P50 were performed at either pH 7.4 or 7.2. At pH 7.4, P50 in the absence of contrast media was 26.3 +/- 0.4 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM). The contrast media caused comparable decreases in P50 from this value (Hypaque-76, 20.0 +/- 0.5 mm Hg; Omnipaque-350, 21.6 +/- 0.4 mm Hg; Isovue-370, 20.7 +/- 0.4 mm Hg). Reducing pH to 7.2 in the absence of contrast media increased P50 to 33.3 +/- 1.0 mm Hg, evidence of the Bohr effect. The presence of contrast media either completely abolished (Hypaque-76 and Omnipaque-350) or markedly attenuated (Isovue-370) this effect. In series 2 (five patients), blood samples were withdrawn from the external iliac artery during injection of Isovue-370 (60-78 mL) into the proximal abdominal aorta to evaluate peripheral vascular disease. Measurement of P50 of these samples yielded findings consistent with those of series 1. The present findings demonstrate that both ionic and nonionic contrast media increase the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen and, therefore, that they may inhibit oxygen delivery to body tissues.\r"

Utilizing a modified critical incident technique, we documented 132 unplanned incidents during 19 simulations (range 3-14, mean 6-947). Ninety-six (73%) of the incidents were considered simple incidents, and 36 (27%) were considered critical incidents. The incidents were classified as either human errors (65.9%), equipment failures (3%), fixation errors (20.5%), or unknown causes (10.6%). Human errors accounted for 87 of the incidents (range 1-12, mean 4.579), fixation errors accounted for 27 of the incidents (range 0-3, mean 1.421), and equipment failures accounted for only four of the incidents (range 0-2, mean 0.211). There was a significant (P less than 0.025) difference overall between resident groups, although no one class differed significantly from the others. The data confirm that most incidents are due to human error rather than equipment failure, and document fixation errors as a frequent cause of incidents in anesthesia. The data indicate that although most incidents are simple and do not progress into more serious incidents, human error remains ubiquitous, and that formal training and education should include recognition of events and the responses to them, in addition to prevention.\r"

In this study electrohydraulic lithotripsy (EHL) is used in combination with T-tube tract choledochoscopy for the fragmentation of large stones prior to basket extraction. T-tube choledochoscopy was performed under IV sedation and sterile conditions no sooner than one month following common bile duct exploration. The Olympus 4.9-mm choledochoscope was passed through the T-tube tract to visualize the stone. A #5 Fr EHL probe was passed through the endoscope and advanced to within 1 mm of the surface of the stone. EHL discharge was started at a low energy level being increased until the spark discharges caused stone fragmentation. The resultant stone fragments were basket extracted under direct vision. The procedure was used in twelve patients with removal of all stones in eleven patients. Eight patients were treated with one endoscopic session. Because of multiple stones, two patients required two sessions and one patient four sessions. In one patient stone position prevented adequate fragmentation and endoscopic papillotomy also failed. Repeat choledochoscopy and EHL were successful. There were no complications of EHL or choledochoscopy in any of the patients. EHL was both effective and safe for fragmentation of large common duct stones when performed under direct vision using a choledochoscope.\r"

Intestinal manometry was performed after first positioning a 200-cm multilumen tube into the small intestine. Ports located at 10-cm intervals were perfused with sterile water and connected to pressure transducers to record intraluminal pressures with a multichannel chart recorder. This low compliance water perfusion manometry system allowed examination of both fasting and postprandial motility. Intestinal manometry was able to assist in the diagnosis of two patients that had true mechanical small-bowel obstruction. One patient had a stenosis of the gastrojejunostomy and three patients had a functional gastric outlet obstruction secondary to a motility disorder in the Roux limb. One patient had a functional obstruction from a reversed jejunal loop and eight patients were identified as having intestinal pseudo-obstruction. We found intestinal manometry was a helpful adjunct in the diagnosis of GI motility disorders.\r"

While this procedure improves the allocation of livers, it does not increase the organ supply. We have extended reduced-size orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) to treat 18 patients with 9 livers, accounting for 26% of our transplants during a 10-month period and have evaluated the results. In 18 split liver OLTs, patient survival was 67% and graft survival was 50%. In comparison, for 34 patients treated with full-size OLT during the same period, patient survival was 84% (p = 0.298) and graft survival was 76% (p = 0.126). Biliary complications were significantly more frequent in split grafts, occurring in 27%, as compared to 4% in full-sized grafts (p = 0.017). Primary nonfunction (4% versus 5.5%) and arterial thrombosis (6% versus 9%) occurred with similar frequency in split and full-size OLT (p = not significant). These results demonstrated that split-liver OLT is feasible and could have a substantial impact in transplant practice. We believe that biliary complications can be prevented by technical improvements and that split-liver OLT will improve transplant therapy by making more livers available.\r"

  ".W": "Hemodynamic and metabolic consequences of a 90-minute period of liver ischemia followed by 120 minutes of reperfusion were studied in rats that were awake during most of the experiment and in rats anesthetized with either pentobarbital (40 mg/kg body weight) or chloralose (30 mg/kg X hour) during the complete length of the experiment. Ischemia was induced by occluding the blood vessels to the left and median liver lobes with a small vascular clamp, which was removed after 90 minutes. Protein synthesis rate was determined by measuring incorporation rate of 14C-leucine into protein in incubated liver slices. At the end of the ischemic period, adenosine triphosphate levels in liver tissue and protein synthesis rate were reduced by 80% to 90%, with no significant differences among groups. During reperfusion, energy levels and protein synthesis rate remained depressed in the anesthetized animals, but improved, although not to normal values, in the awake rats. Hepatic tissue water increased during ischemia, probably reflecting hepatocellular membrane injury. The increase in hepatic tissue water was more pronounced in the chloralose group than in the other groups of rats. During reperfusion hepatic tissue water remained increased in the anesthetized rats but was normalized in the awake group. Mean arterial blood pressure was stable during ischemia and reperfusion in the pentobarbital anesthetized rats, while a progressive decrease in blood pressure during the experiment was noted in the chloralose group. The results suggest that hemodynamic and metabolic responses to liver ischemia and reperfusion can be influenced by anesthetics. Chloralose may be less suitable than pentobarbital for anesthesia when liver ischemia is inflicted.\r"

  ".W": "Polycystic liver disease (PLD) associated with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is usually well tolerated. However there is a small subset of patients who become incapacitated by massive liver enlargement and for whom effective nonsurgical therapy is limited. Recent surgical advances in the treatment of PLD have raised uncertainties regarding proper management of these highly symptomatic patients. We have reviewed our recent experience with a combined hepatic resection-fenestration procedure to assess its efficacy in nine patients. All patients underwent resection of two or more liver segments and extensive fenestration of residual cysts in the remnant liver. Symptomatic relief and reduction in abdominal girth were obtained in eight surviving patients, persisting for an average follow-up period of 17 months. No progression of cystic disease has been observed clinically or by computed tomography and hepatic function was preserved. Three patients had no complications. Five patients had complications including transient right pleural effusion (3) and thrombosis of an arteriovenous fistula (2). One patient who had a previous hepatic cyst fenestration and a cadaveric renal transplantation died after operation of an intracerebral hemorrhage after experiencing coagulopathy, hyperbilirubinemia, and sepsis. Our results suggest (1) some highly symptomatic patients with massive PLD may benefit from combined hepatic resection and fenestration with acceptable risk, and (2) previous liver surgery and immunosuppressive therapy may increase the risk of such surgery. Longer follow-up is needed in a larger number of patients to determine the duration of benefit from the combined resection-fenestration procedure for highly symptomatic PLD.\r"

After a median follow-up of 71 months, 15 of 61 (25%) of the patients with multiple tumors developed recurrence in the treated breast, compared to 56 of 525 (11%) of patients with single cancers (p less than 0.005). Local failure occurred in 6 of 37 (16%) of bifocal tumors and in 9 of 24 (35%) of patients with 3 or more tumor foci. Recurrence was more frequent for multiplicity diagnosed clinically or mammographically (8 of 22 patients, 36%) than when it was apparent only to the pathologist (7 of 39 patients, 18%). Only 1 of 21 bifocal tumors diagnosed on gross examination recurred. Local failure occurred in only 1 of 22 cases with clearly negative resection margins; the remaining recurrences were associated with positive (n = 3) or indeterminate margins (n = 11). In contrast with recurrences of unifocal breast cancers, local failures in these patients tended to be located at a distance from the original foci, to be multifocal, or to be diffuse, including skin involvement. Only four recurrences presented as a single focus in the vicinity of the original primary tumors. This study indicates that macroscopically multiple breast cancers are at higher local failure risk, especially if multiplicity is clinically apparent, or if three or more gross nodules are seen on pathologic examination. Negative resection margins appear to be essential for satisfactory results.\r"

The following studies were done to determine the effects of continuous intravenous prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) or a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor, indomethacin, on tumor growth and metastasis in mice bearing Lewis lung carcinoma. Male B6D2F1 mice underwent tumor implantation in the right axilla on day 0. After 10 days of tumor growth, mice underwent intravenous (IV) catheterization and were infused with either PGE1 at 3 micrograms/kg/minute (PG-LOW), PGE1 at 6 micrograms/kg/minute (PG-HIGH), indomethacin (INDO) at 1 microgram/kg/minute, or normal saline (NS). After 10 days of infusion, tumor volume, tumor weight, and the number of metastases greater than 2 mm in diameter were significantly decreased, and tumor doubling time was significantly prolonged in the PG-HIGH group compared to NS controls. None of the other experimental groups showed differences in these parameters. A second experiment with a similar experimental design was done infusing PGE1 at 6 micrograms/kg/minute and at 12 micrograms/kg/minute to determine the maximum dose response of IV PGE1. Again a decrease in tumor volume, tumor weight, and metastatic rates were identified when compared to saline control, but there were no significant difference between the two doses of PGE1.\r"

A retrospective analysis of these patients defines the biologic behavior, surgical management of primary and recurrent disease, predictive factors for outcome, and impact of multimodality therapy. Complete resection was possible in 65% of primary retroperitoneal sarcomas and strongly predicts outcome (p less than 0.001). The rate of complete resection was not altered by histologic type, size, or grade of tumor. These patients had a median survival of 60 months compared to 24 months for those undergoing partial resection and 12 months for those with unresectable tumors. Forty-nine per cent of completely resected patients have had local recurrence. This is the site of first recurrence in 75% of patients. These patients undergo reoperation when feasible. Complete resection of recurrent disease was performed in 39 of 88 (44%) operations, with a 41-month median survival time after reoperation. Tumor grade was a significant predictor of outcome (p less than 0.001). High-grade tumors (n = 65) were associated with a 20-month median survival time compared to 80 months for low-grade tumors (n = 49). Gender, histologic type, size, previous biopsy, and partial resection versus unresectable tumors did not predict outcome by univariate analysis. Adjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy could not be shown to have significant impact on survival. Concerted attempt at complete resection of both primary and recurrent retroperitoneal soft-tissue sarcoma is indicated.\r"

Of 325 patients who had a laparotomy for blunt abdominal trauma, we identified 15 (4.6%) who had 40 IAAs. The most common intra-abdominal injuries involved the spleen and liver. Splenectomy increased the risk for IAA in contrast to splenic salvage. Blunt injuries to the kidney and pancreas, when occurring in multiple trauma patients, carried a significant risk of IAA. Associated multiple extra-abdominal injuries and high transfusion requirements increased the risk for IAA formation. Most of the IAAs were located in the upper quadrants. There was a 46% incidence of multiple IAA, which in turn had an 80% chance of recurrence after initial drainage. Enterobacter species played an important role in the formation of IAA in our trauma patients. Three patients (20%) died. Poor prognostic indicators included a high injury severity score, high transfusion requirements, the presence of pelvic fracture, positive blood cultures, multiple organisms per abscess, and multiple-organ system failure.\r"

  ".W": "We prospectively studied patients with hypertension and diabetes undergoing elective noncardiac surgery with general anesthesia to test the hypothesis that patients at high risk for prognostically significant intraoperative hemodynamic instability could be identified by their preoperative characteristics. Specifically we hypothesized that patients with a low functional capacity, decreased plasma volume, or significant cardiac comorbidity would be at high risk for intraoperative hypotension and those with a history of severe hypertension would be at risk for intraoperative hypertension. Patients who had a preoperative mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than or equal to 110, a walking distance of less than 400 m, or a plasma volume less than 3000 cc were at increased risk of intraoperative hypotension (i.e., more than 1 hour of greater than or equal to 20 mmHg decreases in the MAP). Hypotension was also more common among patients having intra-abdominal or vascular surgery, and among those who had operations longer than 2 hours. Patients older than 70 years or with a decreased plasma volume were at increased risk of having more than 15 minutes of intraoperative elevations of greater than or equal to 20 mmHg over the preoperative MAP in combination with intraoperative hypotension; this was also more common when surgery lasted more than 2 hours. Patients who had intraoperative hypotension tended to have an immediate decrease in MAP at the onset of anesthesia and were often purposefully maintained at MAPs less than their usual level during surgery with fentanyl and neuromuscular blocking agents. Patients who had intraoperative hyper/hypotension tended to have repeated elevations in MAP above their preoperative levels during the course of surgery, and such elevations precipitated interventions with neuromuscular blocking agents and/or fentanyl. Neither pattern was more common among patients who developed net intraoperative negative fluid balances. Both hypotension and hyper/hypotension were associated with increased renal and cardiac complications after operation. Patients with cardiac disease, especially diabetics, and those with negative fluid balances also had increased complications. Preoperative characteristics influence the susceptibility to intraoperative hypotension and hypertension, which are related to postoperative complications.\r"

Conduction abnormalities on admission electrocardiogram predicted serious arrhythmias. Echocardiography and creatine phosphokinase isoenzyme levels, although frequently positive, did not predict morbidity. Clinically significant myocardial contusions are rare.

  ".U": "90303037\r", 
  ".W": "Recent studies have shown that calcium antagonists exert an antiatherogenic effect in animals fed cholesterol. Vein graft intimal hyperplasia is believed to be an early event in atherosclerotic lesion formation, which is a significant cause of graft failure. Altered vasoreactivity has also been postulated in the etiology of vein graft failure. Therefore this study examined the effect of verapamil treatment on the development of intimal hyperplasia and the vasoreactivity of experimental vein bypass grafts. The right external jugular vein was grafted into the right carotid artery of 30 male New Zealand white rabbits fed normal rabbit chow. The left external jugular vein was used as the control vein. Fifteen animals received verapamil (1.25 mg/day for 28 days) via the femoral vein by means of an osmotic pump. In 15 control animals the pump contained saline. Plasma verapamil concentration was 50.9 +/- 13.2 ng/mL (x +/- SEM), a dose that showed no effect on either blood pressure, total serum cholesterol, or in vitro platelet aggregation to ADP. Fourteen of fifteen grafts were patent in each group, for a patency rate of 93%. Histologic examination using computer morphometry showed significant reduction of intimal hyperplasia at the proximal, middle, and distal graft segments (p less than 0.05). In addition in vitro isometric tension studies of the vein grafts and control veins showed that verapamil causes enhanced reactivity of both vein grafts and control veins in response to norepinephrine and histamine (p less than 0.05). Reactivity of vein grafts to serotonin was unaltered. While none of the normal veins in the control group responded to serotonin, normal veins treated with verapamil contracted readily in response to serotonin. Endothelial-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine was absent in both control and verapamil-treated vein grafts, while normal veins from both groups responded to the same extent to acetylcholine. Because we could not demonstrate any difference in platelet or endothelium function between untreated and verapamil-treated animals, we examined the direct effect of verapamil on smooth muscle. Verapamil significantly inhibited [3H]-thymidine incorporation into DNA in vascular smooth muscle cells in culture in a dose-dependent manner. Verapamil treatment significantly reduces intimal hyperplasia in experimental vein grafts and inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation in culture. Furthermore the enhanced reactivity to norepinephrine and histamine in the verapamil-treated vessels has no detrimental effect on the patency rate at 4 weeks. Thus by inhibiting intimal hyperplasia, calcium antagonists may improve the long-term patency of vein bypass grafts.\r"

Electively 123 had distal splenorenal shunt (DSRS) and 96 had splenectomy with gastroesophageal devascularization (S&GD). Liver pathology was documented in 73% of patients, with schistosomal fibrosis in 41% and nonalcoholic cirrhosis or mixed pattern (fibrosis and cirrhosis) in 59%. The surgical groups were similar before operation, with a mean follow-up of 82 +/- 13 and 78 +/- 18 months, respectively (range, 60 to 120 months). The two pathologic populations were also similar before each and both procedures. The operative mortality rates were low, with incidences of 3.3% (DSRS) and 3.1% (S&GD). Rebleeding occurred significantly (p less than 0.05) more frequently after S&GD (27%) compared to DSRS (5.7%). Sclerotherapy salvaged 65% of S&GD rebleeders. Encephalopathy developed significantly (p less than 0.05) more after DSRS (18.7%) compared to S&GD (7.3%), with no significant difference among the current survivors. The difference in overall rebleeding and encephalopathy rates between both procedures was statistically related to patients with cirrhosis and mixed lesions (p less than 0.05). Distal splenorenal shunt significantly reduced the endoscopic variceal size more than S&GD (p less than 0.05). Prograde portal perfusion was documented in 94% of patients in each group, with a variable distinct pattern of portaprival collaterals in 91% (DSRS) and 65% (S&GD). The total population cumulative survival was similar with 80% for DSRS and 79% for S&GD (plus sclerosis in 23%), with hepatic cell failure the cause of death in 46% and 50%, respectively. However, in the schistosomal patients, survival was better improved after DSRS (90%) compared to S&GD (75%), with no difference among the cirrhotic and mixed group (DSRS 73%, S&GD 72%). In conclusion (1) both DSRS and S&GD have low operative mortality rates, (2) DSRS is superior to S&GD in the schistosomal patients, and (3) S&GD backed by endosclerosis for rebleeding is a good surgical alternative to selective shunt in the nonalcoholic cirrhotic and mixed population.\r"

These lesions are believed to be rare and display histologic features ranging from minimal changes associated with vasodilation to vascular proliferative lesions resembling Kaposi's sarcoma. The spectrum of histologic features observed in these cases appears to be the result of the extent and duration of regional lymphatic and/or venous obstruction. We describe two such cases, one presenting in a 66-year-old black woman, after undergoing radical mastectomy for treatment of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast following a breast biopsy; the other presenting in a 66-year-old black man with obstruction of the subclavian vein. We consider these cases worthy of review, both from a diagnostic standpoint and in the differential diagnosis of vascular neoplasms of lymph nodes, especially Kaposi's sarcoma.\r"

Since metastatic renal cell carcinoma may be histologically similar to papillary cystadenoma, and both are associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease, differentiation between these two entities may be difficult. We performed lectin histochemistry studies on three papillary cystadenomas and compared the results with the staining observed in epididymal ducts, epididymal efferent ductules, and three renal cell carcinomas. Common positive staining was observed following incubation with soybean agglutinin in epididymal ducts and two of the three papillary cystadenomas, while the three renal cell carcinomas did not stain. When epididymal tumors histologically consistent with papillary cystadenoma fail to react with soybean agglutinin, thorough clinical evaluation for an occult renal cell carcinoma should be performed.\r"

  ".W": "We present, to our knowledge, the first extensively studied case of lymphoid L2 blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia with a hand mirror cell (HMC) variant. Special stains revealed the leukemic cells to be terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase positive by immunofluorescence and cytochemically positive for alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase and acid phosphatase (diffuse granular). Immunophenotyping identified the major leukemic cell population as B-cells that expressed CD10+, CD19+, and HLA-DR+. It was not possible to separate the HMC and the non-HMC leukemic population by gating various cell populations, dual staining, cytochemistry, or by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Gene rearrangements were observed in both Ig heavy-chain alleles and one T-cell antigen receptor gamma-subunit allele. The rearrangements occupied all of the cells, indicating that the HMC and non-HMC were of a common clonal origin. The patient had a mosaic karyotype, with 90% of the cells having t(9;22), t(8;14), and t(9;15) translocations, an additional chromosome 8, and deleted chromosomes 9 and 15. Antibodies to simian sarcoma-associated virus and baboon endogenous virus were isolated in the patient's peripheral blood plasma.\r"
