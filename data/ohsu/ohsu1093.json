Four had terminal myelocystoceles, and one had a lipomyelomeningocele. Pathological anatomy was confirmed during surgery for the release of the tethered spinal cords. The striking association between cloacal exstrophy and occult spinal dysraphism suggests a common developmental defect in the caudal pole of the embryo. A hypothesis is offered to explain this association. Terminal myelocystocele and lipomyelomeningocele appear to be part of a continuum of lesions associated with skin-covered spina bifida.\r"

We report on 8 cases of associated occipital meningocele, totalling 16% of all patients with the Dandy-Walker syndrome in our series. In all patients, communication existed between the posterior fossa cyst and the occipital meningocele. In 2 patients, the occipital meningocele disappeared after cerebrospinal fluid shunting and never required surgical repair. It appears that the cranial defect had ossified and resulted in self-closure. Poor intellectual development in persons with the Dandy-Walker syndrome is associated with the presence of other central nervous system and systemic abnormalities and not with occipital meningoceles alone.\r"

In 6 patients, the malfunction was due specifically to a valve malfunction. Cerebrospinal fluid from each valve was passed through a millipore filter, which was then stained using either hematoxylin and eosin or periodic acid-Schiff. The stained millipore filters were examined by a neuropathologist who was unaware of the cause of the shunt malfunction. Although inflammatory cells were detected in all cases, the patients with valve malfunctions were found to have numerous macrophages and giant multinucleated reactive cells within their valves, while cerebrospinal fluid from valves that had been removed during shunt revisions for reasons other than a malfunctioning valve contained only rare mononuclear cells or macrophages. No valve contained erythrocytes, fibrinous matter, neural or glial tissue, or choroid plexus. The possible causes of valve malfunction, including infection and allergic reactions, are discussed. All patients did well after simple replacement of the valve.\r"

  ".U": "91296081\r", 
  ".W": "The specific mechanism underlying the genesis of vasogenic brain edema is still debated: the role of arachidonic acid is considered extremely important, as it is a possible activator of self-maintaining reactions enhancing the release of vasoactive and cytotoxic compounds. The relationship between arachidonic acid metabolism and brain edema has been studied primarily in brain tissue samples or in the extracellular fluid, whereas the residual capacity of perilesional tissue to synthesize and release eicosanoids has not been investigated. In the present study, perilesional samples of brain tissue were available from 4 patients operated on for brain metastasis, from 8 patients who had malignant neuroepithelial tumors, from 4 with meningiomas, and from 5 with subarachnoid hemorrhage. A brain edema index was calculated from the preoperative computed tomographic scan. The \"ex vivo\" method allowed determination of the residual capacity of endogenous arachidonic acid metabolism. The edema index is significantly higher in patients with brain metastasis (6.5 +/- 0.8) and neuroepithelial tumors (3.6 +/- 0.2) than in those with meningiomas (1.5 +/- 0.06), subarachnoid hemorrhage (1.7 +/- 0.18), and in controls. In patients with metastatic and neuroepithelial tumors there is a significant correlation between peritumoral brain edema and the capacity to synthesize leukotriene C4 (P less than 0.05); the capacity to synthesize leukotriene C4 is also significantly elevated after subarachnoid hemorrhage (13.91 +/- 2.6 ng/ml of incubation medium) when compared with control cases (5.56 +/- 0.91). The capacity to synthesize prostacyclin is significantly higher in patients with brain metastasis than in those with neuroepithelial tumors and meningiomas (P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A search of the Mayo Clinic tissue registry yielded 73 giant cell-containing astrocytomas and intraventricular gliomas exclusive of ependymomas. Reexamination revealed no further examples of subependymal giant cell astrocytoma in patients without features of the tuberous sclerosis complex. Considerable histological variation was observed in the 15 subependymal giant cell astrocytomas subjected to critical microscopic review. It is of note that no correlation was noted between either the histological features, such as atypia, mitoses, endothelial proliferations, necrosis, or the flow cytometric characteristics and the clinical course or the survival time of the patients.\r"

  ".W": "This report presents a new surgical method and the results in 10 patients with petroclival meningiomas extending into the parasellar region (sphenopetroclival meningiomas). Minimal but effective extradural resection of the anterior petrous bone via a middle fossa craniotomy offered a direct view of the clival area with preservation of the temporal bridging veins and cochlear organs. The dural incision was extended anteriorly to Meckel's cave, and in cases with invasion of the cavernous sinus, Parkinson's triangle was enlarged by mobilization of the trigeminal nerve. This approach offered an excellent view from the mid-clivus to the cavernous sinus. Extra-as well as intradural tumor masses and dural attachments could be cleared under direct view of the pontine surface. The risk of injury to the lower cranial nerve and of retraction damage to the temporal lobe and brain stem were kept minimal by this approach. Total tumor resection was achieved in 7 patients, with no resultant mortality. Eight patients had a satisfactory postsurgical course, extraocular paresis being their main complaint. The extent of tumor resection depended on the degree of tumor adhesion to the carotid artery, and operative morbidity on the degree of tumor invasion of the brain stem. Of the 3 patients in whom subtotal tumor removal was achieved, only one experienced regrowth of the tumor and underwent a second operation during the follow-up period (6 months-6 years).\r"

The intradural tumor was resected first with the affected dura of the anterior skull base, and the dural defect was repaired with fascia harvested from the sheath of the rectus abdominis muscle. The remaining tumor contiguous to the nasal cavities was completely extirpated. The cranial cavity was then exposed to the opened nasal cavities, where a revascularized omental graft was used to separate these compartments. Lyophilized dura was placed beforehand beneath the omental graft, as a roof to the nasal cavity, and was removed 3 weeks later through the nostril. A bony skull base repair was performed over the omentum using the inner table of the bone flap. Subcutaneous fat from the abdomen was placed on the bone graft for fixation and as an additional seal for the dural defect. Reconstruction of the anterior skull base with a vascularized omental transfer provides an efficient barrier to the nasal cavity. It also serves as an excellent supporting structure for regeneration of the mucosal epithelium of the nasal cavities.\r"

The patient awoke neurologically intact and was monitored in the Intensive Care Unit. A lumbar subarachnoid drain was placed for the continuous removal of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Approximately 36 hours after surgery, she deteriorated neurologically and demonstrated bilateral extensor posturing to painful stimuli. A computed tomographic scan demonstrated obliteration of the basal cisterns indicative of transtentorial herniation and a small amount of extradural air. Eight hours after the lumbar drain was turned off, the patient had recovered completely. We propose that the patient manifested transtentorial herniation caused by a pressure gradient between the supratentorial and lumbar cistern compartments brought on by the continuous removal of CSF from the lumbar subarachnoid space. We suggest that ventricular drainage should be considered for these cases rather than lumbar drainage. This offers the same advantage of removing the CSF and maintaining low-to-normal intracranial pressure without the risk of transtentorial herniation.\r"

The stress that generated a remaining strain of 1 mm was about 80% of the maximum stress of the fixed flexible arm, and was a suitable indicator of the ability of a retractor under load. It had good correlation with the fixing torque of the flexible arm and was also influenced by the diameter of the arch of the fixed flexible arm. For all three commercially available retractors, the strongest resistance was obtained when the flexible arm was arranged in a semicircular shape with a diameter of 20 cm, regardless of the length of the arm. The retractor made of titanium alloy was superior to the retractor of the same shape made of stainless steel for vertical load, regardless of different arm-fixing torques. The tapered flexible arm of the Mizuho titanium retractor showed greater resistance to loading than a nontapered one at stronger arm-fixing torques. The Aesculap Leyla retractor had different dynamic properties from the Mizuho stainless retractors, despite their similarity in shape. The Leyla retractor was weaker than the Mizuho stainless retractors for vertical loading but stronger for horizontal loading. These experimental observations may be helpful when applying a self-retaining retractor during surgery.\r"

  ".W": "We conducted full diagnostic evaluations, including a comprehensive cognitive assessment battery, of a group of 32 elderly subjects with a clinically identified mild cognitive impairment and a group of 32 age-matched and education-matched normal subjects. The mildly impaired subjects performed significantly more poorly than the controls on tests of recent memory, remote memory, language function, concept formation, and visuospatial praxis. Follow-up evaluations of cognitive status 2 years later revealed clinically detectable cognitive decline relative baseline in 23 (72%) of the mildly impaired subjects. Several of the objective psychological tests accurately discriminated at baseline between the decliners and nondecliners in the mildly impaired group. Among the 20 mildly impaired subjects with no complicating conditions, 16 exhibited cognitive deterioration between baseline and follow-up. These results suggest that most elderly subjects with mild cognitive deficits, as determined by clinical evaluation and objective psychological testing, will manifest the progressive mental deterioration characteristic of dementia and that psychometric predictors can be used to distinguish between benign and more significant underlying disorders in mildly impaired elderly subjects.\r"

We retrospectively reviewed 166 episodes of native valve endocarditis to assess the occurrence and implications of nonfocal encephalopathy, meningitis, salient headache, back pain, and brain abscess. Neurologic complications occurred in 35% (58/166) of patients: 41% (54/133) of mitral or aortic valve IE and 12% (4/33) of tricuspid valve IE. Of 133 cases of mitral or aortic valve IE, encephalopathy occurred in 14%, meningitis in 5%, and salient headache in 3%. All neurologic complications occurred more often with Staphylococcus aureus infection (67%) than with viridans streptococci (22%), including encephalopathy (22% versus 7%), meningitis (17% versus 0%), stroke (39% versus 16%), and death (39% versus 9%). Encephalopathy was associated with virulent organisms, increased patient age, and uncontrolled infection. Clinical, radiologic, and neuropathologic data all suggest that infective microemboli are often etiologic in IE-related encephalopathy. There were no macroscopic brain abscesses clinically identified. Meningitis occurred only with virulent organisms. While many clinical aspects of IE have changed in recent years, the frequency and gravity of neurologic complications have not.\r"

Supramaximal stimulation of the median, ulnar, peroneal, and posterior tibial nerves at frequencies of 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 Hz produced showers of electrical potentials following the M response in at least one nerve. In three patients, the fasciculations and evoked electrical potentials were abolished by regional application of curare but not nerve block. Carbamazepine therapy caused moderate-to-marked reduction of symptoms and nerve hyperexcitability.

Statistical paired comparisons confirmed the tendency in the entire group of patients for weakness to be greater in muscles supplied by the deep peroneal nerve. On EMG, denervation was more often present and of more marked degree in muscles supplied by the deep peroneal nerve. Motor nerve conduction studies indicated axonal damage and focal demyelination with similar frequency. Sensory deficits varied in the three areas supplied by the cutaneous branches of the CP nerve: five patients had involvement of all three areas, 11 of two areas, two of one area, and four had no sensory deficit. The most likely explanation for these findings is differing degrees of damage to individual fascicles within the CP nerve.\r"

They infrequently obstruct the aqueduct to cause hydrocephalus or compress the tectum to produce the neuro-ophthalmologic signs of dorsal midbrain dysfunction. Obstructive hydrocephalus was present in only five patients (9.4%); three of them showed clinical signs of Parinaud's syndrome. CT and MRI typically reveal a cystic mass that averages 1.6 cm in anteroposterior (A-P) diameter with calcification at the periphery and faint rim-like contrast enhancement. Sagittal MRI is the most useful diagnostic test because it shows the anatomic relationship of the cyst to the aqueduct. The mass may compress the tectum and distort the proximal aqueduct; occasionally a large cyst may occlude the aqueduct. All patients with obstructive hydrocephalus had cysts greater than 2.0 cm in A-P diameter. Nine patients had suboccipital craniotomy. In all of them, the cysts contained clear fluid and were easily removed. We advocate conservative management with clinical observation of these benign lesions that may be developmental variants of normal pineal gland.\r"

Some images suggested selective cortical involvement of deeper layers only. Deep white matter was relatively spared, distinguishing this from usual cerebrovascular disease or the edema after status epilepticus. Specificity of these findings is further suggested by a good correlation of these findings with the previously described unique postmortem brain pathology of MELAS.\r"

Biochemistry showed a partial defect of cytochrome c oxidase and a mild generalized reduction of other mitochondrial enzymes requiring mitochondrial DNA-encoded subunits. Southern blot analysis and PCR amplification showed mitochondrial DNA deletions in muscle of all affected members, but not in lymphocytes or fibroblasts, suggesting a tissue-specific distribution.

Two children and one adult with clinical histories suggestive of sleep terrors had unequivocal partial seizures during VPSG. Of 36 patients with known epilepsy, VPSG was useful diagnostically in 28 (78%). VPSG is superior to standard polysomnography for the evaluation of parasomnias because of the increased capability to identify and localize EEG abnormalities and to correlate behavior with EEG and polysomnography. VPSG may also be a suitable alternative to intensive inpatient monitoring for some patients with known or suspected epilepsy who have frequent undiagnosed nocturnal spells.\r"

We were unable to trigger seizures or induce epileptiform discharges arising from the epileptic focus in any of the eight patients with any of the stimulation protocols. However, we induced a partial motor seizure from the contralateral hemisphere to the exclusive temporal focus in the only patient stimulated with 100% maximal intensity. Precautions have to be taken when applying rapid TMS to patients because of the risk of seizure induction. Our results do not support the view that TMS specifically activates the epileptic foci.\r"

We used nonparametric analyses to evaluate five primary comparisons of ALS patients with controls: (1) more hard physical labor, p not significant (NS); (2) greater frequency of neurodegenerative disease in family members, p NS; (3) greater exposure to lead, p less than 0.05; (4) more years lived in a rural community, p NS; and (5) more trauma or major surgery, p NS. Men with ALS had worked more frequently at blue-collar jobs (although not a statistically significant difference, p = 0.10) and at welding or soldering (p less than 0.01). These results suggest that there may be an association between ALS in men and exposure to lead vapor. The limited nature of the association favors a multifactorial etiologic mechanism of ALS.\r"

Increased focal temporal lobe uptake, predominantly confined to the anteromesial region, was present in 83% and declined rapidly over 5 minutes. Reduced activity in the lateral temporal lobe accompanied the mesial increase in 80% of studies, extending over much of the ipsilateral hemisphere and closely associated with the degree and extent of postictal EEG slow waves. These patterns enabled correct seizure localization by blinded analysis in 69% (31/45) of the patients with a unilateral EEG focus. The remainder showed bilateral or no changes. One of six patients with bitemporal EEG foci had unilateral perfusion changes. The positive predictive value for the correct localization of a unilateral focus by postictal SPECT was 97% (31/32). Postictal CBF imaging with SPECT can be used to support noninvasive electrographic localization and may decrease the need for invasive electrode studies.\r"

Our definition used for status epilepticus was that of Delgado-Escueta et al, at least 30 minutes of repetitive seizures without regaining consciousness. Nineteen of 20 patients were young women, all but one under 40 years of age. Sixteen of these patients had a history of childhood seizures. In over 50% of patients, seizures continued until respiratory arrest and intubation occurred. Thorough neuropsychological testing and psychiatric interview were done after cessation of the acute episode. Long-term outcome and prognosis depended on definitive psychiatric diagnosis. Repetitive psychogenic seizures simulating status epilepticus are not uncommon, and such patients may incur serious iatrogenic complications from treatment for status epilepticus. Appropriate management and long-term prognosis may be determined by the type and severity of the underlying psychiatric disorder.\r"

Slopes of the blood pressure response/dose relationships were more negative in patients with multiple system atrophy and pure autonomic failure (PAF) than in normal subjects, consistent with impaired baroreflex modulation. A shift to the left in patients with PAF suggests beta-adrenergic receptor supersensitivity. In normal subjects, the increase in plasma NE and PRA was proportional to the log of the plasma isoproterenol level. Isoproterenol infusion did not increase plasma NE or PRA in either patient group despite a reduction in mean blood pressure. Reflexive cardiovascular and renal mechanisms appear to play a role in eliciting the plasma NE and PRA responses to isoproterenol infusion in normal subjects.\r"

Neurophysiologic studies showed a generalized sensorimotor neuropathy of axonal degeneration type. Examination of a sural nerve biopsy showed a moderately severe axonal neuropathy with loss of large myelinated fibers and unmyelinated axons. There was evidence of slow ongoing degeneration and considerable fiber regeneration. Electron microscopy showed increased numbers of filaments in a few fibers. These findings show resemblances to the nerve changes caused by another acrylic resin, acrylamide. We suggest that the neuropathy may have been caused by 30 years of occupational cutaneous and inhalational exposure to methyl methacrylate monomer since we excluded other recognized causes of neuropathy.\r"

We counted large pyramidal neurons, small neurons, astrocytes, oligodendroglia, and microglia under the guidance of a specifically predefined set of morphologic criteria for each cell type and recorded the thickness of each cortical layer. Our results demonstrate a selective and progressive loss of a subset of the large pyramidal neurons in cortical layers III, V, and VI of HD patients, and a decrease in the thickness of the respective cortical laminae. A genetically determined, cell-autonomous degeneration of cortical neurons could constitute the primary pathologic process. However, the loss of only a fraction of pyramidal cells suggest a parallel, or an alternative, possibility of a retrograde degeneration of cortical neurons that project solely, or principally, to the site of primary degeneration in caudate nuclei.\r"

We measured brain and body temperatures during the experiment using micro-thermocouples and blood-brain-barrier (BBB) permeability using Evans blue staining of the brain. We measured the volume of the infarcted brain tissue 4 days after MCAo. We detected no differences in BBB permeability among three groups. The volume of infarcted tissue was significantly greater (p less than 0.05) for the two groups of hyperthermic animals than the normothermic animals. Our data suggest that mild hyperthermia, both during and after induction of ischemia, has a detrimental effect on the ischemic infarct volume in this model.\r"

Published estimates of recurrence risk range from 23% to 71%. In a meta-analysis of 16 reports, three methodologic factors explained much of the reported variation: (1) study inclusion criteria, ie, whether patients were enrolled at the time of their first seizure or if patients with prior seizures were included; (2) retrospective versus prospective ascertainment of patients; (3) the interval between the first seizure and the time at which risk was assessed. The average recurrence risk across the 16 studies was 51%. The risk was 40% and 52% in prospective and retrospective studies that employed first-seizure methods and 67% in non-first seizure studies. At or near 2 years following the first seizure, the recurrence risk was 36% and 47% in prospective and retrospective first-seizure studies. The distribution of prognostic factors was also important. Seizure etiology and the EEG were the strongest predictors of recurrence distinguishing between patient subgroups, with recurrence risks as low as 24% and as high as 65%. Partial seizures were associated with an increased recurrence risk, but not consistently. There is considerable agreement among studies concerning the recurrence risk following a first seizure, and much of the discrepancies among studies can be explained by differences in study methods and distributions of important prognostic factors.\r"

All had an advanced parkinsonian syndrome, supranuclear ocular motor palsies, and poor responses to dopaminergic drugs. During administration of 40 mg tid of IDA, the total score and the motor subscale score of the United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale significantly decreased. Features that improved most included mobility, balance, gait, and measures of digital dexterity. There were no significant changes in any measure during placebo administration. Corticobulbar manifestations and eye movements were not significantly improved during treatment. Side effects of IDA included transient hypertension, tachycardia, action tremor, flushing, and sweating, but none was so severe that any patient withdrew from the study. Among the few attempted treatments of PSP, IDA is the first medication shown in a double-blind study to improve aspects of motor function.\r"

  ".W": "We studied DNA polymorphisms for five new chromosome 13 markers in 52 Wilson's disease (WD) families from Europe, North America, and the Middle East. There was significant evidence for linkage between the Wilson's disease locus (WND) and all the marker loci. Multilocus linkage analysis, using a genetic linkage map established from reference pedigrees, suggested that WND is most likely between D13S31 and D13S59, at distances of 0.4 and 1.2 centimorgans, respectively. Our results suggest that the chromosomal location of the Wilson's disease gene is the same in all families from the populations studied. This evidence and the availability of many close, flanking, and polymorphic DNA markers make possible accurate and informative testing of potential carriers and WD homozygotes in families with at least one previously affected child. An advantage of a genetic linkage test over other laboratory methods for prediction of genotype in WD is that a reliable diagnosis can be made at a much earlier stage in life, including prenatally. In addition, DNA testing can be used in place of an invasive liver biopsy procedure to confirm a diagnosis in patients with borderline serum ceruloplasmin levels. Presymptomatic identification will also allow therapeutic intervention to prevent symptoms before irreparable liver or neurologic damage occurs. We describe the implementation of prenatal and preclinical diagnosis for two families with WD.\r"

  ".W": "Nearly all studies have suggested that the use of oral contraceptives (OC) is not associated with the aggregate risk of breast cancer diagnosed in women aged 20-54. Because of age-specific differences in the breast cancer-parity relationship and because of age-specific differences in other breast cancer risk factors, the Centers for Disease Control reexamined data from the Cancer and Steroid Hormone Study to assess whether OC use has different effects on the risk of breast cancer at different ages of diagnosis. This was a population-based case-control study conducted in eight geographic areas in the United States during 1980-1982. In these data, the relationship between the risk of breast cancer and OC use appeared to vary by age at diagnosis. Among women aged 20-34 years at diagnosis or interview, those who had ever used OC had a slightly increased risk of breast cancer (odds ratio 1.4, 95% confidence interval 1.0-2.1) when compared with women of the same ages who had never used OC. Among these women, there were no trends of increasing or decreasing risk with any measure of OC use. Among women aged 35-44 years, there was no association between OC use and breast cancer. Among women aged 45-54 years, those who used OC had a slightly decreased risk of breast cancer (odds ratio 0.9, 95% confidence interval 0.8-1.0). Among these women, the risk estimates decreased significantly with increasing time since first and last use. Although the slightly increased risk estimates for the youngest women are compatible with findings by other investigators, the decreased risk estimates for the oldest women have not been described in as many studies. Available data provide no reasons for changes in prescribing practices or in the use of OC as related to breast cancer risk.\r"

We investigated the relationship between insulin resistance and the serum inhibin concentration in a group of 19 women with polycystic ovary syndrome and eight control subjects at different phases of the menstrual cycle. Insulin resistance was measured by the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test, and inhibin was measured by a specific radioimmunoassay. Insulin sensitivity (mean +/- SE) was significantly reduced in the polycystic ovary syndrome group compared with controls: reduced insulin sensitivity 46.7 +/- 5.0 min-1/(nmol/mL), normally insulin-sensitive 106.6 +/- 11.7 min-1/(nmol/mL) (P less than .01). The women with polycystic ovary syndrome had inhibin levels (126 +/- 15.2 microLEq/mL) comparable to those found during the early follicular phase of the control group (117 +/- 22.1 microLEq/mL), but significantly lower than late follicular phase (259 +/- 25.6 microLEq/mL) or luteal phase (448 +/- 91.8 microLEq/mL) levels in the control group. No association was found between the degree of insulin resistance and the inhibin concentration, which remained unaltered over a 3-hour period despite maximal stimulation of endogenous insulin secretion. The inhibin concentrations in polycystic ovary syndrome may reflect impaired follicular maturation. Inhibin secretion is not acutely affected by insulin secretion in normal or in hyperandrogenic women.\r"

To evaluate the effects of an oral Mg preparation on premenstrual symptoms, we studied, by a double-blind, randomized design, 32 women (24-39 years old) with PMS confirmed by the Moos Menstrual Distress Questionnaire. After 2 months of baseline recording, the subjects were randomly assigned to placebo or Mg for two cycles. In the next two cycles, both groups received Mg. Magnesium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid (360 mg Mg) or placebo was administered three times a day, from the 15th day of the menstrual cycle to the onset of menstrual flow. Blood samples for Mg measurement were drawn premenstrually, during the baseline period, and in the second and fourth months of treatment. The Menstrual Distress Questionnaire score of the cluster \"pain\" was significantly reduced during the second month in both groups, whereas Mg treatment significantly affected both the total Menstrual Distress Questionnaire score and the cluster \"negative affect.\" In the second month, the women assigned to treatment showed a significant increase in Mg in lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear cells, whereas no changes were observed in plasma and erythrocytes. These data indicate that Mg supplementation could represent an effective treatment of premenstrual symptoms related to mood changes.\r"

The samples were incubated for 24 hours at 37 C with 10(-2)-10(4) ng/mL of TSST-1 or 10(4) ng/mL of bacterial endotoxin. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha activity was determined with a bioassay using an actinomycin D-sensitized WEHI-164 murine fibrosarcoma cell line. Twenty-four-hour incubation with TSST-1 resulted in a dose-dependent release of TNF-alpha by both peritoneal macrophages (maximal response 554 +/- 97 U of activity) and peripheral blood monocytes (maximal response 478 +/- 81 U of activity). We observed enhanced TNF-alpha release by peritoneal macrophages from women with endometriosis, compared with those without endometriosis, at a concentration of 10(4) ng/mL of TSST-1 (704 +/- 134 versus 354 +/- 103 U of activity; P less than .05). These data support the theory that the metabolic and physiologic derangements of perimenstrual toxic shock syndrome may be partially mediated by TNF-alpha released by peritoneal macrophages as a result of exposure to TSST-1.\r"

Fifteen women underwent evaluation because of postmenopausal bleeding. In both groups, endometrial thickness of 4 mm or less as depicted by sonography correlated well with endometrial characteristics of decreased estrogen stimulation. However, in women with measured endometrial thickness between 5-8 mm, proliferative endometrium could not be distinguished from hyperplastic endometrium or, in one case, low-grade carcinoma. Large polyps and invasive carcinoma with myometrial extension were easily recognized.\r"

To correlate these findings with histologic criteria for normal endometrial development, we compared endometrial biopsies with ultrasonographic findings. Nineteen cycles were monitored in 18 women with ovarian failure whose endometrial cycles were induced exogenously by sequential transdermal 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and intramuscular progesterone. These subjects underwent ultrasonography of the endometrium prior to the day of progesterone initiation (luteal day +1) and continuing throughout the mid-secretory phase. On luteal day +1, ultrasonography characteristically demonstrated a multilayered endometrium consisting of a hyperechoic perimeter (endometrial-myometrial interface), a hypoechoic inner layer, and a hyperechoic midline (luminal interface). By luteal day +7, a gradual increase in echogenicity of the inner layer was detected, while the inner myometrium remained hypoechoic. Eleven of 19 cycles demonstrated a completely hyperechoic endometrium on luteal day +7 and also demonstrated normal stromal development on endometrial biopsies. Three patients who had endometrial biopsies consistent with their chronological development failed to demonstrate a hyperechoic endometrium by luteal day +7. All five biopsies that were histologically out of phase were detected by ultrasonography. Thus, ultrasonography demonstrated a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 62% for the detection of histologically normal endometrial development. Endometrial thickness could not be used to discriminate between biopsies that were normal (13 +/- 1.0 mm) and those out of phase (13.8 +/- 1.8 mm). Endometrial histology demonstrated asynchrony of glands and stroma in nine cases in which ultrasonography correlated with stromal, but not with glandular dating, suggesting that the increased echogenicity may reflect stromal edema.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Applied topically to the vagina, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) cream is an effective therapy for human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated lesions of the vagina including condylomata acuminata and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia. Although the acute side effects of 5-FU therapy are well recognized, long-term sequelae of intravaginal 5-FU use have not been described in detail in the literature. To assess the incidence and clinical course of 5-FU-related vaginal mucosal alterations, we studied 220 patients who underwent 5-FU therapy for HPV-associated lesions of the vagina. Eighteen women (8.2%) had epithelial ulcers 6 months after completion of the 5-FU treatment. The incidence of ulcers was higher in women who used 5-FU for longer than 10 weeks compared with those who used it for 10 weeks or less (9.6 versus 5.7%; P = .05). All but one of the mucosal defects were in the vaginal fornices and/or the periphery of the ectocervix. The ulcers were mostly singular and measured 0.5-7 cm in greatest diameter. Fourteen patients (77.8%) had symptoms related to the ulcers including a serosanguineous or watery discharge (55.6%), postcoital spotting or bleeding (44.4%), irregular bleeding unrelated to intercourse (16.7%), and pain (5.6%). Spontaneous healing of the ulcers was protracted. Office methods of therapy including estrogen creams and cauterizing agents failed to accelerate healing as compared with untreated patients. Excision of the ulcer and primary closure of the wound was curative in all four cases in which it was used. We conclude that topical 5-FU therapy may lead to troublesome chronic mucosal ulcers that tend to persist despite conservative treatment attempts.\r"

We retrospectively reviewed 240 vaginal tubal sterilization procedures performed by a single physician. Long-term follow-up (more than 5 years) was available in over half the study group (52%). Half of all operations were completed in 12 minutes or less, with an average time of 14.5 minutes. The planned vaginal procedure was completed in all but two cases, both of which required laparotomy secondary to dense adhesions. Median estimated blood loss was 20 mL. No postoperative infection was encountered. These data suggest that vaginal tubal sterilization may still be a safe alternative for interval sterilization.\r"

There was no variation in this zone when power was altered, but a statistically significant increase was demonstrated with duration of exposure. A depth of destruction of 3.24-3.49 mm was possible with the desiccating coagulation technique, but fulguration achieved a depth of only 1.70-1.78 mm. A greater tissue effect was demonstrated as time intervals were increased. There was a fall-off in the measured rise in temperature with distance; at 4 mm from the active electrode, a mean rise of 4.5C was noted, whereas at 12 mm the mean temperature rise was 3.9C. There was a statistically significant increase in the mean temperature as power output in the cutting mode was increased. At 180 W, the mean rise was 2.0C but by 260 W, it was 3.9C. When the time interval was increased and the power held constant (220 W), a mean rise of 2.5C was recorded at 1 second, compared with 4.6C at 5 seconds, achieving statistical significance. Power increments in the coagulating mode did not alter the temperature profile, but increasing duration of exposure was associated with a significant rise in mean temperature (from 0.8 to 4.6C). A stepwise increase in the baseline temperature was noted with repetitive insults.

Brewer Trophoblastic Disease Center of Northwestern University Cancer Center for treatment and/or follow-up of a hydatidiform mole (N = 162) or postmolar gestational trophoblastic tumor (N = 137). The type of contraception and other prognostic factors before and after evacuation were correlated with the development of gestational trophoblastic tumor using both univariate and multivariate analysis. There was no relationship between pre-hydatidiform mole contraception and the development of gestational trophoblastic tumor. Oral contraceptives (OCs) were used by 139 patients (46%), barrier methods by 141 patients (47%), intrauterine devices (IUDs) by two patients (1%), and no contraception by 17 patients (6%). The risk of developing gestational trophoblastic tumor was compared between patients using versus not using: OCs--33 versus 57% (P less than .001), barrier methods--53 versus 40% (P = .30), IUD--100 versus 46% (P = .21), and any contraceptive method--43 versus 88% (P less than .001). The dose of estrogens could be determined in 75 patients taking OCs; 14 of 49 (29%) of the patients taking less than 50 micrograms versus nine of 26 (35%) taking 50 micrograms or more developed gestational trophoblastic tumor (P = .78). Stepwise logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the type of contraceptive used was the most important prognostic factor in gestational trophoblastic tumor development (P less than .0001), followed by the occurrence of theca-lutein cysts (P less than .0001), Asian maternal race (P = .02), lesser time from the last menstrual period (P = .005), and greater maternal age (P = .04).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Because of the widespread interest in cesarean rates and the expanding use of epidural analgesia, we believed that this contention should be assessed. Hospital records were reviewed to determine the primary cesarean rate for 1084 parturients who delivered at our institution during 15 months in which there was a 24-hour \"on demand\" epidural service. This was compared with our primary cesarean rate during 15 months in which epidural analgesia was not available, even on physician request. Because of the characteristics of our institution, this control group consisted of patients from the same population base managed by the same eight obstetricians using the same management techniques. For patients in labor, the primary cesarean rate overall was 9.0% before and 8.2% after the epidural service began (P = .626). When subpopulations based on parity and indication for cesarean delivery were studied, there were no significant changes in the cesarean rate. These results demonstrate that the availability of on-demand epidural analgesia for patients in labor did not increase the primary cesarean rate, either in the aggregate or for any of the subpopulations studied.\r"

Because the prevalence of obesity is increased among women with gestational diabetes, fetal overgrowth may be attributable at least in part to maternal obesity. We studied 2069 black, Latina, Chinese, and white mother-infant pairs to determine the interaction between maternal body habitus, maternal glucose homeostasis, and certain indices of fetal growth. Chinese women had a significantly higher serum glucose 1 hour after administration of 50 g glucose (136.6 +/- 32.7 mg/dL) than any of the other three ethnic groups. Black women had a significantly lower value for glucose (114.8 +/- 28.2 mg/dL) than either Chinese or Latina women (124.9 +/- 31.4 mg/dL). Results for Latina and white women (121.5 +/- 26.2 mg/dL) were not significantly different. Body mass index (BMI) was used to classify the subjects. The regression coefficient for the entire sample indicated a modest association of glucose with increased birth weight when maternal BMI was controlled. The BMI of the Chinese infants had a significant association with higher concentrations of glucose after administration of 50 g glucose. Maternal body habitus should be considered a major confounder in studies of the relationship of maternal glucose tolerance and infant birth weight.\r"

Baseline maximal inspiratory pressure, maximal expiratory pressure, functional vital capacity, and forced expiratory volume at 1 second were measured immediately before a 6-g IV loading dose of magnesium sulfate and 2 hours after the initiation of a continuous 2-g/hour infusion of magnesium sulfate. Serum magnesium levels were measured at the same time pulmonary function tests were performed. All values are reported as the mean +/- standard deviation. The maximal inspiratory pressure, an indicator of generalized respiratory muscle weakness, decreased from a baseline value of 26.2 +/- 7.7 to 19.4 +/- 6.3 cm H2O (P less than .05). The maximal expiratory pressure, an indicator of expiratory muscle strength, decreased from a baseline value of 30.6 +/- 9.2 to 25.2 +/- 7.1 cm H2O (P less than .005). The functional vital capacity decreased from a baseline value of 3.37 +/- 0.49 to 3.19 +/- 0.73 L, and the forced expiratory volume at 1 second decreased from a baseline value of 2.61 +/- 0.58 to 2.36 +/- 0.68 L at 2 hours (P less than .05). The mean serum magnesium level was 1.7 +/- 0.2 mg/dL before the administration of the IV loading dose and 4.51 +/- 0.67 mg/dL 2 hours after initiation of the continuous infusion. Our results demonstrate a significant decrease in pulmonary function tests in term preeclamptic patients receiving magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91296296\r", 
  ".W": "Premature labor is one of the most common complications associated with cocaine abuse during pregnancy. Still, the effect of cocaine on the pregnant uterus is largely unknown. Although inhibition of neuronal uptake is the most important effect of cocaine in most tissues, after mid-pregnancy, the uterus has few functioning adrenergic nerve endings. To determine whether cocaine has any effect on uptake during pregnancy, we evaluated the ability of the term pregnant human uterus to take up [3H]-norepinephrine (9 x 10(-8) mol/L) and the ability of cocaine (10(-6)-10(-8) mol/L) to block this uptake. Because d-propranolol has been shown to block the direct effects of cocaine on the pregnant rabbit uterus, we also evaluated the ability of d-propranolol (2 x 10(-6) mol/L) to block the effect of cocaine on catecholamine uptake. The ability of the Uptake 2 inhibitor hydrocortisone (2 x 10(-5) mol/L) to block catecholamine uptake was also studied. We found that [3H]-norepinephrine was taken up by both the pregnant myometrium and endometrium, and that cocaine blocked this uptake by up to 55% at concentrations as low as 10(-7) mol/L. D-propranolol had no effect on the ability of cocaine to block catecholamine uptake. Hydrocortisone blocked uptake by the endometrium by 15% but did not block uptake by the myometrium. We conclude that the pregnant human uterus at term retains the ability to take up catecholamines and that cocaine blocks this extraneuronal uptake. This may explain, in part, the association of cocaine use with premature labor.\r"

At the initial evaluation by ultrasound, 82% of the patients had at least one finding that may have accounted for the elevation. Approximately 45% of the fetuses had a major fetal anomaly, 25% died, 16% had an identifiable placental abnormality, and 5% had an underestimation of gestational age; 18% of the elevations remained unexplained after ultrasound. In follow-up of the pregnancies, all of those with an unexplained elevation after initial ultrasound had at least one obstetric complication or placental abnormality. The overall positive predictive value of an MSAFP value of 8 or more MoM for NTDs was 22.7%. The proportion of infants born alive in the overall group was low, with only 16 live births among 46 fetuses. The majority of the nonviable outcomes were associated with a fetus with a major anomaly that was terminated or died before 20 weeks. Of the live-born infants, 31% had a major anomaly, 19% had intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) and an anomaly, 12.5% had IUGR without an anomaly, and 25% were preterm. Eighty-eight percent of those pregnancies with a live-born infant had at least one obstetric complication. Among pregnancies with MSAFP of 8 or more MoM, the majority are associated with large structural fetal anomalies or fetal death before 20 weeks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In order to facilitate ultrasound visualization, a diagnostic infusion was attempted at a median of 22 weeks (range 16-36) in 61 pregnancies with oligohydramnios in the absence of ruptured membranes on clinical examination. The procedure was successful in 58 (95%). Infusion (mean volume 181 mL, range 40-64) significantly increased (P less than .001) the deepest pool of amniotic fluid to a mean of 3.2 cm. Suspected fetal anomalies were then confirmed in 27 of 30 cases, whereas kidneys were clearly demonstrated in three fetuses suspected of renal agenesis. In addition, previously unsuspected anomalies were identified in five. Vaginal leakage indicating ruptured membranes occurred in 16 women. Leakage occurred in zero of 24 patients with, compared to 16 of 35 without, fetal urinary disorders (chi 2 = 15.1, P less than .001), which does not support the recent suggestion that amnioinfusion causes rather than unmasks rupture of the membranes. Membranous detachment was observed by ultrasound in 13 patients, 11 of whom leaked vaginally. Information obtained at amnioinfusion led to a change of etiologic diagnosis in eight (13% of subjects). Forty serial infusions were performed in nine women as a pilot study to prevent oligohydramnios sequelae. There were no skeletal deformities; three neonates survived, and five of the six perinatal deaths had normal lung-body weight ratios. Overall, only two of 89 infusions (2.2%) were complicated by clinical amnionitis. Our findings support a role for amnioinfusion in oligohydramnios.\r"

All patients with abruption had abnormal S/Ds, as did 14 of 64 subjects who had preterm labor and a history of cocaine abuse. No abnormal S/Ds were found in the women with preterm labor or in controls. Among cocaine-abusing women, there was a significant correlation between placental abruption and abnormal S/Ds (P less than .05) and between abnormal S/Ds and the incidence of preterm birth and SGA and LBW infants.\r"

To evaluate the possibility of acoustic trauma, 465 children who had been exposed to vibroacoustic stimulation in utero were screened at 4 years of age for high-frequency hearing loss. A hand-held audiometer with test tones at 25 dB for 1000 and 4000 Hz was used because responses at this level indicate hearing within normal limits for middle and high frequencies. Thirty-one children failed the test. Failure to respond was followed by inspection of the ear canal for wax, tympanometry, and reflex measurement to assess the tympanic membrane, middle ear, and eustachian tube. Hearing was retested across the full frequency range using conventional audiometric technique, and referral for otolaryngologic examination and treatment was made if necessary. The causes of hearing loss were impacted wax in 12, current or recent upper respiratory tract infection with eustachian tube dysfunction and middle ear effusion in 15, and unresolved middle ear effusion after treatment with antibiotics for otitis media in two. Profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss of unknown origin was found in one and slight bilateral gently sloping hearing loss in another. Retesting of all children with conductive hearing loss indicated that hearing had returned to normal after treatment. None of the children showed evidence of hearing loss.\r"

The maximum estimated fetal weight underestimate and overestimate were 95 and 159 g, respectively. Using this formula, 46 of 63 (73%) of the estimated fetal weights were within 10% of the birth weight and 56 of 63 (89%) were within (+/-) 100 g of the birth weight. No formula was found to be statistically different by pooled estimate of differences of slopes. When only the biparietal diameter and abdominal wall circumference were available, the Shepard revision of the Warsof equation gave standard deviation 81.7 g and r2 of 0.748; 53 of 67 estimated weights (79%) were within 100 g of the birth weight. When only femur length and mean abdominal diameter were available, the Rose 3 formula [natural log of birth weight = 0.2053 (femur length + mean abdominal diameter) + 4.3726] gave a standard deviation of 89.9 g and r2 of 0.658. Fifty-seven of 71 estimated weights (80%) were within 100 g of the actual birth weight. This study, the largest comparison of formulas to estimate the birth weight of 500-1000-g fetuses, found that no formula estimated fetal weight significantly more accurately than any other.\r"

Randomized trials also demonstrated that progestin-only IUDs had a markedly higher ratio of ectopic to total pregnancies, 171 per 1000, than did copper IUDs, at 39 per 1000 (P less than .001). Ectopic pregnancy rates per 1000 woman-years with progestin-only IUDs varied inversely with dose, notably for levonorgestrel-releasing devices. In a large United States IUD cohort study, ectopic pregnancy ratios of copper IUDs varied significantly (P less than .05) with age, as they do in the general population. Copper and non-medicated IUDs in the United States and the United Kingdom had age-specific ectopic pregnancy ratios six times those of non-contraceptors in the United States population during 1970-1978. The estimated rate of ectopic pregnancy for users of IUDs having 200 mm2 of copper was four-tenths that of non-contraceptors in the United States during 1970-1978. For users of devices with 350 mm2 or more of copper, ectopic pregnancy rates were one-tenth those of non-contraceptors. Rates for users of devices releasing 65 micrograms/day of progesterone are estimated to have been 50-80% above those of non-contraceptors. Devices releasing 20 micrograms/day of levonorgestrel have had ectopic pregnancy rates estimated to be 0.1 of those of non-contraceptors. Most IUDs protect against ectopic pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "There is strong evidence that at least some forms of hCG can interact with and stimulate the thyroid both in vitro and in vivo. Changes in thyroid tests are sufficiently common in normal pregnancy for us to regard them as physiologic. The evidence that hCG is the agent responsible for these changes remains largely circumstantial but is now supported by an increasing body of evidence from laboratory studies. Trophoblastic tumors secrete variant forms of hCG that can stimulate the thyroid, but we do not know if they have any role in the extreme examples of thyroid stimulation encountered in normal pregnancy. Preparations of hCG from pregnancy urine bind to thyroid membranes from a wide variety of species, but they do not activate adenylate cyclase in all assay systems. The enzyme in human thyroid cells or membranes is, at best, only weakly stimulated by hCG. There are ample in vitro data that hCG can stimulate the thyroid, but studies using human thyroid cells have yielded conflicting results. The most direct evidence comes from the study of thyroid tests in normal pregnancy. In early pregnancy, when hCG concentrations are highest, free thyroid hormones are increased and serum TSH concentration is decreased. An inverse correlation exists between serum hCG and TSH concentrations, but hCG generally correlates poorly with individual thyroid tests. An activity in pregnancy serum related to hCG is able to stimulate FRTL-5 cells and may account for the changes in thyroid function observed in pregnancy. Structural considerations, along with data from biologic assays and sensitive thyroid function tests, suggest that hCG has significant thyroid-stimulating activity. This information suggests that the thyroid may be under dual control from both hCG and TSH in early pregnancy.\r"

Nearly half (49.6%) of the students responded. Their demographic characteristics compared well with national figures. Regression analyses identified 15 significant predictors of specialty choice among the 445 students who ranked OBG as one of their top four choices. More women than men chose OBG. Students attracted to the specialty liked contact with (mostly healthy) patients. They expressed strong beliefs on reproductive issues and perceived a need for more obstetrician-gynecologists. They associated their interests in operative procedures with certain risks and responsibilities. Physicians in OBG modestly affected their decision. Students who chose a different specialty wanted more variety in disease and patient mix. They wanted a more controllable life-style, particularly in residency training. They felt that the insurance costs and the risk of lawsuit detracted from OBG. These findings offer a stimulus for discussion between students and their advisors. Students need sufficient exposure to the specialty to help them assess the value they place on these specialty characteristics.\r"

All 6 cases were caused by toxin-producing strains. Four of 6 were toxin A-producing strains whereas none of 58 community-acquired (Group A streptococcal) pharyngeal isolates in the same period was a toxin A producer. A review of the literature on the incidence of toxin A-producing strains provides information suggesting a resurgence of such strains in the late 1980s after a relative disappearance of toxin B production in isolates from these patients was also significantly greater than in the isolates acquired from the community in uncomplicated pharyngitis. These findings suggest a role for exotoxin in severe manifestations of Group A streptococcal disease in children.\r"

The outbreak, caused by Trichophyton tonsurans, was traced to a corticosteroid-treated patient whose tinea infection had gone undiagnosed for 5 weeks. The attack rate for tinea corporis in personnel who had contact with the patient was 30%. Transmission appeared to have occurred primarily by direct contact with the patient because infected personnel, compared with uninfected controls, had more than twice as much direct contact (6.2 hours vs. 2.6 hours, P = 0.052). Soiled linen probably was the source of infection in two workers who had only indirect contact with the patient. This outbreak illustrates that substantial nosocomial transmission of T. tonsurans can occur and suggests that barrier precautions should be used by hospital personnel who handle infected patients or their soiled linens.\r"

Cases were defined as children 3 months to 14 years of age who had tuberculosis and controls consisted of one to four children who were born in the same year and had the same district of residence as the case. A matched analysis with a variable number of controls per case was performed on 75 cases and 207 controls. Conditional logistic regression was performed to adjust for the potential confounding effects of household tuberculosis exposure and socioeconomic status. Forty-eight percent of cases had nonrespiratory tuberculosis. Laboratory-confirmed evidence for tuberculosis was found in 48% of cases. The adjusted protective efficacy of neonatal BCG vaccination was 83% (95% confidence limits, 35%, 96%). It was 96% (95% confidence limits, 66%, 100%) when only 36 matched sets of laboratory-confirmed cases were analyzed. Subgroup analyses and literature reviews indicated that the accuracy of tuberculosis diagnosis, types of tuberculosis, duration after vaccination and household tuberculosis exposure contribute to variation in the reported protective efficacy of neonatal BCG vaccination.\r"

Two sets of blood cultures (1 aerobic and 1 anaerobic bottle/set; BACTEC, NR 6A/7A) from different sites were obtained from 460 inborn infants who were evaluated for possible sepsis. From 0.5 to 1 ml of blood was inoculated into each blood culture bottle. In 18 infants the use of multiple site blood cultures yielded important information. In 8 of these neonates bacteremia was confirmed whereas in 10 cases contamination from skin flora was documented. We could identify no instances in which the delay in antibiotic therapy while the second set of blood cultures was obtained contributed to an adverse outcome. We conclude that multiple site blood cultures are useful in the initial evaluation for suspected sepsis during the first week of life.\r"

Among the 183 children who fulfilled the case definition, 6 (3.3%) presented with more than one site of infection. The overall incidence rate among children younger than 5 years of age was 60.2/100,000 but it was 92.1/100,000 in 1989. Forty-one percent of patients had meningitis, 37% had epiglottis and 22% had other forms of Hib infections. Fifty-four percent of cases occurred in children younger than 2 years of age. Invasive Hib infections were found more often in boys than in girls (1.6/1). From 1984, 21% of all Hib were beta-lactamase-producing strains. During the study period 2 children (1.1%) died from epiglottitis and 12 children with meningitis (15.8%) developed serious neurologic deficits. These data suggest that administration of a conjugate vaccine against Hib to all infants living in Geneva is justified.\r"

IgG responses to type 1, 3 and 5 polysaccharides were seen in children in all age groups. Responses to type 19F and 23F polysaccharides were seen only in the oldest children. Few children of any age responded to immunization with type 6A pneumococcal polysaccharide. The immune response of Gambian infants to immunization with six components of a polyvalent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine was comparable with that described previously in Finnish infants and would be unlikely to provide substantial protection against invasive pneumococcal disease.\r"

Domain I, consisting of the amino-terminal 47 amino acids, contains a 21-residue hydrophobic segment that anchors the protein in the inner membrane. The remaining 374 amino acids, containing the other two domains, reside in the periplasmic space. Domain III, consisting of the carboxyl-terminal 120 residues, is considered to be the functional domain based on the location of the tolA592 deletion mutation. The internal 262 amino acids comprise domain II, which connects domains I and III together via short regions of polyglycine. It contains a large number of 3- to 5-residue polyalanine stretches, many of which have a repeat of the sequence Lys-Ala-Ala-Ala-(Glu/Asp).

The smallest of these complexes (occupancy of one peptide monomer per site) contains either one of two polypeptides (32 and 28 kDa) of the V8 digestion mixture. The amino termini of both polypeptides map to Ser-129 of Flp, corresponding to V8 cleavage at Glu-128. The relative mobilities of the complexes formed by the V8 peptides indicate that they lack the sharp substrate bend that is characteristic of Flp-derived complexes. A hybrid protein consisting of the amino-terminal one-third of the R recombinase (from Zygosaccharomyces rouxii) and the carboxyl-terminal two-thirds of Flp recognizes the Flp target site.\r"

  ".W": "At least 35 allelic variants of human serum albumin have been sequenced at the protein level. All except two COOH-terminal variants, Catania and Venezia, are readily explainable as single-point substitutions. The two chain-termination variants are clustered in certain locations in Italy and are found in numerous unrelated individuals. In order to correlate the protein change in these variants with the corresponding DNA mutation, the two variant albumin genes have been cloned, sequenced, and compared to normal albumin genomic DNA. In the Catania variant, a single base deletion and subsequent frameshift leads to a shortened and altered COOH terminus. Albumin Venezia is caused by a mutation that alters the first consensus nucleotide of the 5' donor splice junction of intron 14 and the 3' end of exon 14, which is shortened from 68 to 43 base pairs. This change leads to an exon skipping event resulting in direct splicing of exon 13 to exon 15. The predicted Venezia albumin product has a truncated amino acid sequence (580 residues instead of 585), and the COOH-terminal sequence is altered after Glu-571. The variant COOH terminus ends with the dibasic sequence Arg-Lys that is apparently removed through stepwise cleavage by serum carboxypeptidase B to yield several forms of circulating albumin.\r"

Also discussed are such topics as compensatory neutral evolution and an approach to a unified understanding of molecular and phenotypic evolution. It is concluded that random genetic drift acting on selectively neutral mutants must have played some very important role in organic evolution, including the origin of life and macroevolution.\r"

Some of the rate variation is associated with G + C content: genes with intermediate G + C values have the highest rates. Nevertheless, considerable heterogeneity remains after correcting for G + C content. Synonymous substitution rates also vary among lineages, but the relative rates of genes are well conserved in different lineages. Certain genes have also been sequenced in a fourth order (lagomorph or carnivore), and these data have been used to investigate mammalian phylogeny. Data on lagomorphs are consistent with a star phylogeny, but there is evidence that carnivores and artiodactyls are sister groups. Genes sequenced in both rat and mouse suggest that the increased substitution rate in rodents has occurred since the rat/mouse divergence.\r"

Aminopeptidase activity was exocytosed from antigen-activated, IgE-sensitized BMMC in proportion to the secretory granule enzyme beta-hexosaminidase, thereby localizing approximately 60% of the total cell-associated aminopeptidase activity to the secretory granules of the mast cells. A prominent secretory granule location for aminopeptidase was confirmed by activity measurement in subcellular fractions of disrupted BMMC. The secretory granule aminopeptidase had a pH optimum of 6.0-8.0 and a Km of 0.36 +/- 0.06 mM (mean +/- SD; n = 3) for leucine-beta-naphthylamide. When various amino acid beta-naphthylamides were used as substrates, the preference of the secretory granule enzyme was Ala greater than Leu greater than Phe much greater than Arg much greater than Asp = Tyr. Most of the aminopeptidase activity that was exocytosed from calcium ionophore-activated BMMC was bound to 35S-labeled proteoglycans in complexes of greater than 1 x 10(7) kDa as defined by exclusion during Sepharose CL-2B gel-filtration chromatography. We postulate that the amino-peptidase in the mast cell protease/proteoglycan complexes allows the removal of N-terminal amino acids from peptides that are generated by the action of mast cell endopeptidases.\r"

  ".W": "Structural characteristics of major histocompatibility complex class I antigens associated with natural killer (NK)-resistance phenomena were examined. Previous research has shown that transfection of class I genomic DNA clones into class I-deficient, NK-sensitive target cell lines results in transfectants exhibiting class I+, NK-resistant phenotypes. In contrast to the HLA-A3, -B7, -B27, and -Bw58 class I molecules, the HLA-A2 class I molecules were shown not to protect target cells from NK activity. Here we show that this nonprotective phenotype maps to the alpha 1 domain of the HLA-A2 molecule by examining the NK-protective capacity of the natural interdomain recombinant HLA-Aw69 molecule. HLA-Aw69, which consists of an alpha 1 domain exhibiting homology with HLA-Aw68, and alpha 2/alpha 3/transmembrane-cytoplasmic domains, exhibiting homologies with HLA-A2, mimics HLA-Aw68 and provides HLA-A,B null target cell (C1R) transfectants with increased resistance to NK. Further, the inability of transfected HLA-A2 to confer protection against NK activity can be completely attributed to the expression of a \"nonpermissive\" residue at position 74 in the alpha 1 domain. Site-directed mutation of the His-74 residue in HLA-A2 to the Asp-74 (HLA-A3, -Aw68, -Aw69, -B7) residue generates a mutant that provides C1R cell line transfectants an NK-resistant phenotype. As His-74 blocks access to a side pocket in the HLA-A2 antigen-binding cleft, these results support the critical involvement of residues within the peptide-binding groove of class I molecules in determining the NK susceptibility phenotype of class I+ target cells.\r"

In the absence of alpha and beta polypeptides, invariant chain was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In the absence of invariant chain, intracellular alpha beta heterodimers could be detected only in the ER and the Golgi apparatus. However, when alpha and beta subunits were coexpressed with invariant chain, HLA-DR molecules were detectable in peripheral cytoplasmic vesicles, which also contained invariant chain. In addition, an antibody directed to an acid-induced conformational determinant on the influenza hemagglutinin molecule detected internalized influenza virus in the HLA-DR-containing vesicles. These findings provide direct evidence that the invariant chain targets class II molecules to an acidic endosomal compartment and that this compartment, long suspected to be the site of antigen processing, is the site where class II molecules interact with natural antigen.\r"

In contrast, Ca(2+)-stimulated Cl- secretion is intact in CF airway epithelia and thus has the potential to bypass the CF Cl- secretory defect. For a Cl- channel to govern Cl- secretion, it must be located in the apical membrane. To specifically investigate apical membrane Cl- channels, we studied cells grown on permeable filter supports and measured Cl- currents across the apical membrane. We found that Ca2+ and cAMP activate different Cl- channels in the apical membrane. (i) Ca(2+)-activated Cl- channels were present in the apical membrane of airway but not in intestinal epithelia. (ii) cAMP- but not Ca(2+)-activated Cl- channels were defective in CF airway epithelia. (iii) Ca(2+)- but not cAMP-activated Cl- channels were blocked by 4,4'-diisothiocyanato-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonate. (iv) Ca(2+)- and cAMP-activated apical channels had different anion permeabilities. (v) An increase in both second messengers produced an additive increase in Cl- current. These results also explain the puzzling observation that Ca(2+)-stimulated Cl- secretion is defective in CF intestine: the Ca(2+)-activated Cl- channels that could circumvent the Cl- secretory defect in CF airway are missing from the apical membrane of intestinal epithelia.\r"

  ".W": "An increase in early rates of oleate uptake, which reflected fatty acid (FA) entry into the cells, was apparent 2-3 days after confluence of differentiating BFC-1 preadipocytes. The increase was measured in cells kept without glucose and with arsenate, where greater than 95% of intracellular radioactivity was recovered as free unesterified oleate. Uptake of retinoic acid, a molecule structurally similar to long-chain FA, remained unaltered during cell differentiation. Increase in oleate transport was related to increase in transport Vmax (determined under arsenate treatment) from 0.2 to 2 nmol/min per 10(6) cells, whereas Km remained unchanged (2 x 10(-7) M). Oleate transport was maximal at about day 6 after cell confluence (day 0), as FA metabolism (incorporation into lipids) began to gradually increase. The increase in transport preceded induction of mRNAs for both cytosolic FA-binding protein, which appeared at day 6, and for the FA synthase, which appeared at day 10. Data indicated that increases in activities of FA transport and of lipoprotein lipase, early during cell differentiation, favored increased availability of exogenous FA at a stage when endogenous FA synthesis is limited. This result would promote FA esterification and lipid deposition by supplying a rate-limiting substrate. Furthermore, oleate addition to BFC-1 preadipocytes at confluence potentiated the effect of dexamethasone in inducing mRNA for cytosolic FA-binding protein. In adipocytes, FA from exogenous or endogenous sources was necessary to maintain levels of cytosolic FA-binding protein mRNA. Thus, the increase in FA availability might contribute to, or modulate, induction of proteins necessary for preadipocyte differentiation.\r"

Substrate inhibition was not observed with dTTP when DNA.DNA template-primers were used. Hill coefficients for substrate binding determined in the presence of saturating concentrations of template-primer were equal to 1.0, suggesting that substrate inhibition of the heterodimer is not the result of an allosteric mechanism involving the p51 subunit.

Both defects could be compensated by raising the ribonucleoside triphosphate concentration.

The 11-mer alpha oligodeoxynucleotide 5'-d(TCTCCTCCTTT)-3' binds to the major groove of DNA in an antiparallel orientation with respect to the homopurine strand, whereas a beta oligonucleotide adopts a parallel orientation. When an intercalating agent was attached to the 3' end of the alpha oligodeoxynucleotide, a strong stabilization of the triple helix was observed. A 16-base-pair homopurine.homopyrimidine sequence of human immunodeficiency virus proviral DNA was chosen as a target for a 16-mer homopyrimidine alpha oligodeoxynucleotide. A restriction enzyme that cleaves DNA at the junction of the homopurine.homopyrimidine sequence was inhibited by triple-helix formation.

  ".W": "It is known from a variety of experimental systems that the ability of tumor cells to grow locally and metastasize can be affected by the presence of adjacent normal tissues and cells, particularly mesenchymally derived stromal cells such as fibroblasts. However, the comparative influence of such normal cell-tumor cell interactions on tumor behavior has not been thoroughly investigated from the perspective of different stages of tumor progression. To address this question we assessed the influence of normal dermal fibroblasts on the growth of human melanoma cells obtained from different stages of tumor progression. We found that the in vitro growth of most (4 out of 5) melanoma cell lines derived from early-stage radial growth phase or vertical growth phase metastatically incompetent primary lesions is repressed by coculture with normal dermal fibroblasts, suggesting that negative homeostatic growth controls are still operative on melanoma cells from early stages of disease. On the other hand, 9 out of 11 melanoma cell lines derived from advanced metastatically competent vertical growth phase primary lesions, or from distant metastases, were found to be consistently stimulated to grow in the presence of dermal fibroblasts. Evidence was obtained to show that this discriminatory fibroblastic influence is mediated by soluble inhibitory and stimulatory growth factor(s). Taken together, these results indicate that fibroblast-derived signals can have antithetical growth effects on metastatic versus metastatically incompetent tumor subpopulations. This resultant conversion in responsiveness to host tissue environmental factors may confer upon small numbers of metastatically competent cells a growth advantage, allowing them to escape local growth constraints both in the primary tumor site and at distant ectopic tissue sites.\r"

We show here that developing erythrocytes can express highly asymmetric morphologies, including elongated cell bodies and long processes in response to two stimuli: mechanical manipulation (repeated washing) and exposure to cytochalasin D. These experiments suggest that erythrocytes pass through a developmental stage during which microtubules are able to exert elongating forces on the cell. That stage is one in which these cells normally change shape, from spherical to discoid. The results suggest that microtubules may both guide and drive the formation of the marginal band and the characteristic morphology of these cells.\r"

The structural gene for this enzyme was cloned from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by functional complementation of a squalene synthetase-deficient erg9 mutant. Identification of this ERG9 clone was confirmed by genetic linkage analysis in yeast and expression of enzyme activity in Escherichia coli. The predicted squalene synthetase polypeptide of 444 amino acids (Mr, 51,753) lacks significant homology to known protein sequences, except within a region that may represent a prenyl diphosphate (substrate) binding site. The ERG9-encoded protein contains a PEST consensus motif (rich in proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine) present in many proteins with short cellular half-lives. Modeling of the protein suggests that it contains at least one, and possibly two, membrane-spanning domains. Disruption of the chromosomal squalene synthetase coding region by insertional mutagenesis indicates that ERG9 is a single copy gene that is essential for cell growth in yeast.\r"

These hotspots have since been detected following treatments that yield other forms of DNA damage, and at least one is active in the absence of damage. The previous mapping of phage replication origins near the peaks of two recombination hotspots suggested that the origins cause the localized enhancement of recombination. Here we show that deletion of one origin eliminates the corresponding recombination hotspot, as judged by rescue of markers from UV-irradiated phage. Furthermore, insertion of either origin into a recombination \"coldspot\" enhances rescue of nearby markers. We conclude that these origins are necessary, and very likely sufficient, for the generation of recombination hotspots. We also show that the hotspots are active in the absence of both phage-encoded UvsY and host-encoded RecA proteins, suggesting that some of the stimulated recombination occurs by a synaptase-independent mechanism.\r"

Here, we demonstrate that unit responses recorded from the posteromedial lateral suprasylvian area, a visual association area specialized for the analysis of motion, also exhibit an oscillatory temporal structure. Cross-correlation analysis of unit responses reveals that cells in area 17 and the posteromedial lateral suprasylvian area can oscillate synchronously. Moreover, we find that the interareal synchronization is sensitive to features of the visual stimuli, such as spatial continuity and coherence of motion. These results support the hypothesis that synchronous neuronal oscillations may serve to establish relationships between features processed in different areas of visual cortex.\r"

Localized water-suppressed 1H spectra were collected from a volume of interest located within the renal medulla by using a stimulated echo-based localization scheme. The principal resonances in the medullary 1H spectrum were residual water (4.7 ppm), lipid (0.9-1.4 ppm), and TMAs (3.25 ppm). The TMA line width was 7-15 Hz before filtering, and the signal-to-noise ratio was 40:1. In four normal volunteers, 15 hr of dehydration led to a significant increase in urine osmolality and decrease in body weight and an increase in medullary TMAs. A subsequent water load [20 ml.(kg of body weight)-1] caused a transient water diuresis, a return to euvolemic body weight, and a significant reduction in medullary TMAs within 4 hr. These results suggest that TMAs may play an osmoregulatory role in the medulla of the normal human kidney.\r"

To understand how the POL1 gene senses cell cycle position, we have investigated the cis-acting elements that respond to the factors that govern cell cycle progression. In this report we demonstrate that a region of 54 nucleotides containing the repeated element ACGCGT, which conforms to an Mlu I restriction endonuclease recognition site, contains all information necessary for transcriptional activation and cell cycle responsiveness. Although oligonucleotides lacking either one or both of the repeated Mlu I sites can function as an upstream activating sequence, the presence of at least one Mlu I site stimulates expression and, moreover, is absolutely essential for cell cycle regulation. A synthetic oligonucleotide corresponding to a 19-base-pair sequence in the POL1 promoter containing one Mlu I site can function as an autonomous cell cycle-responsive upstream element (upstream activation sequence) with temporal regulation indistinguishable from that previously described for the POL1 gene. Thus, the Mlu I site is an essential part of a cis-acting element responsible for the observed periodic activation. This sequence differs from previously defined cell cycle-responsive transcriptional control elements in the yeast HO endonuclease and histone genes. We also present evidence for a negative regulatory element in the 5' flanking region of the Mlu I upstream activation sequence.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-five 13- to 35-amino-acid-long peptides representing regions of human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2), strain SBL6669, envelope proteins were evaluated for their immunogenic activity in guinea pigs. The peptides were selected to provide homologous representation of sites in the HIV-1 envelope proteins that were previously documented to have a particular immunogenic importance. A number of the HIV-2 peptides were found to be capable of inducing strain SBL6669 neutralizing and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) antibodies. Two overlapping peptides covering amino acids 311-337 representing the central and C-terminal part of the variable third (V3) region, terminology according to Modrow et al. [Modrow, S., Hahn, B., Shaw, G. M., Gallo, R. C., Wong-Staal, F. & Wolf, H. (1987) J. Virol. 61, 570-578], showed the most pronounced capacity to induce neutralizing antibodies. One of the peptides (amino acids 318-337) also induced antibodies mediating ADCC. Two additional regions in the large glycoprotein, gp125, containing linear sites reacting with neutralizing antibodies were identified (amino acids, 119-137 and 472-509). The transmembrane protein, gp36, of HIV-2 harbored two regions of importance for induction of neutralizing antibodies (amino acids 595-614 and 714-729). ADCC activity was induced by two additional gp125-specific peptides (amino acids 291-311 and 446-461). Thus, except for the single V3-specific site there was no correlation between linear immunogenic sites stimulating neutralizing antibody and ADCC activity. These findings pave the way for development of synthetic vaccines against HIV-2 and possibly also simian immunodeficiency virus infections. The capacity of such a product to induce protective immunity can be evaluated in macaque monkeys.\r"

Of the 146 polymorphic nucleotide sites detected, 68 and 31 were unique to the Apple Hill and Bogota samples, respectively, and 53 were shared. On the basis of an observed net divergence per nucleotide site of 0.264% between the two samples, the Bogota and North American populations were estimated to have been separated for at least 155,000 years. This divergence time suggests that D. pseudoobscura extended its range from North America to South America in a period of Pleistocene glaciation, when habitat suitable for the species presumably existed in lowland Central America.\r"

Four groups of adult Sprague-Dawley rats were studied: group I received STZ plus AG (25 mg.kg-1.day-1), group II received STZ plus AG (50 mg.kg-1.day-1), group III received STZ alone, and group IV was a control. We monitored conduction and action potential amplitudes serially in sciatic-tibial and caudal nerves, nerve blood flow, oxygen free radical activity (conjugated dienes and hydroperoxides), and the product of the permeability coefficient and surface area to 125I-labeled albumin. STZ-induced diabetes (group III) caused a 57% reduction in nerve blood flow and in abnormal nerve conduction and amplitudes and a 60% increase in conjugated dienes. Nerve blood flow was normalized by 8 weeks with AG (groups I and II) and conduction was significantly improved, in a dose-dependent manner, by 16 and 24 weeks in sciatic-tibial and caudal nerves, respectively. The permeability coefficient was not impaired, suggesting a normal blood-nerve barrier function for albumin, and the oxygen free-radical indices were not ameliorated by AG. We suggest that AG reverses nerve ischemia and more gradually improves their electrophysiology by an action on nerve microvessels. AG may have potential in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy.\r"

In this report, we present a genetic selection using the baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to clone a gene from Candida glabrata encoding a metal-activated DNA-binding protein denoted AMT1. This selection is based on the ability of the AMT1 gene product to activate expression of the C. glabrata MT-I gene in a copper-sensitive S. cerevisiae host strain. DNA-binding studies using AMT1 protein expressed in Escherichia coli demonstrate that AMT1 is activated by copper or silver to bind to both the MT-I and MT-II promoters of C. glabrata. Sequence comparison of AMT1 protein to the S. cerevisiae copper- or silver-activated DNA-binding protein, ACE1, indicates that AMT1 contains the 11 amino terminal cysteine residues known to be critical for the metal-activated DNA-binding activity of ACE1. In contrast, the carboxyl-terminal portion of AMT1 bears only slight similarity at the primary structure level to the same region of ACE1 known to be important for transcriptional activation. These results suggest that the amino-terminal cysteines, and other conserved residues, play an important role in the ability of AMT1 and ACE1 to sense intracellular copper levels and assume a metal-activated DNA-binding structure.\r"

The other heme is unreactive toward ligands, exhibits strong interactions with the binuclear center, and is mainly responsible for the reduced-minus-oxidized alpha band. Protoheme has been thought to be the prosthetic group of b-type cytochromes, including cytochrome o. However, the hemes of cytochrome o are of a different kind, for which we propose the name heme O. Its pyridine hemochrome spectrum is blue-shifted by 4 nm relative to that of protoheme, and chromatographic behavior showed that it is much more hydrophobic than protoheme. Fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry yielded a molecular mass of 839 Da. Heme O is proposed to be a heme A-like molecule, containing a 17-carbon hydroxyethylfarnesyl side chain, but with a methyl residue replacing the formyl group.\r"

Here we report the purification and characterization of the Cu-ACE1 truncated molecule. Spectroscopic techniques showed that ACE1 contains an unusual type of DNA binding structure that is based on a polynuclear Cu(I)-cysteinyl thiolate cluster. The cluster consists of six or seven Cu(I) ions coordinated to cysteinyl thiolates in a trigonal geometry distorted from planarity. The Cu(I)-cysteine cluster of Cu-ACE1 exhibits structural properties analogous to the Cu(I)-thiolate polynuclear cluster in yeast Cu-metallothionein itself, suggesting an unusual mechanism for the evolution of this regulatory factor. The Cu cluster organizes and stabilizes the conformation of the N-terminal domain of ACE1 for specific DNA binding.\r"

The phosphorothioate groups of such transcripts are cleaved by reaction with iodine to permit sequencing of the transcripts. Footprinting was achieved by performing the same reaction with the phosphorothioate-tRNA-enzyme complex. At 1 mM iodine, selective protection of the tRNA transcripts in the cognate system was observed, with strong protection at positions 52 and 68 and weak protection at positions 46, 53, 67, 69, and 70.

Experiments with recombinant MAP kinase, ERK2, purified from Escherichia coli in a nonactivated form revealed a self-catalyzed phosphate incorporation into both tyrosine and threonine residues. Another MAP kinase, ERK1, purified from insulin-stimulated cells also autophosphorylated on tyrosine and threonine residues. Autophosphorylation of ERK2 correlated with its autoactivation, although both autophosphorylation and autoactivation were slow compared to that occurring in the presence of MAP kinase activator. Therefore, we propose that autophosphorylation is probably involved in the MAP kinase activation process in vitro, but it may not be sufficient for full activation. The specificity toward tyrosine and threonine residues indicates that the MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2 are members of a group of kinases with specificity for tyrosine as well as serine and threonine residues.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) mRNA expression was studied after 90% partial pancreatectomy in the rat to determine whether IGF-I was associated with pancreatic regeneration. The level of IGF-I mRNA was maximally increased (4-fold above control value) 3 days after pancreatectomy, but thereafter gradually decreased, returning to control levels by 14 days after surgery. By in situ hybridization, IGF-I mRNA in both pancreatectomized and sham-operated rats was localized to capillary endothelial cells, indicating that this is the site of IGF-I expression in the normal rat pancreas. However, enhanced IGF-I mRNA expression was localized to focal areas of regeneration unique to pancreatectomized rats. In these areas, epithelial cells of proliferating ductules and individual connective tissue cells expressed IGF-I, suggesting that IGF-I may play an important role in the growth or differentiation of pancreatic tissue.\r"

Polymerase chain reaction using Alu primers was applied to YAC clones in order to generate probes, to identify overlapping clones, and to derive \"fingerprints\" and sequence data directly from total yeast DNA. Several clones were identified in regions of medical interest. One set of three overlapping clones was found to cross a chromosomal translocation implicated in Lowe syndrome. The regional assignment of groups of YAC clones provides initiation points for further attempts to develop large cloned contiguous sequences, as well as material for investigation of regions involved in genetic diseases.\r"

The hexanucleotide originally identified is necessary for DNA binding by c-MYC, but not sufficient; the c-MYC target site is a 12-nucleotide-long palindrome. This site is present within regulatory regions of genes that are expressed during cell growth. Point mutations within the helix-loop-helix motif of c-MYC abolish DNA-binding and transforming activities, indicating that c-MYC acts as a DNA-binding protein to transform cells. c-MYC may transform cells by activating transcription of genes required for cell division.\r"

T-cell clones that specifically recognize pancreatic islet cell antigens can be derived from NOD mice, and most of these have been diabetogenic upon transfer to healthy recipients. We report herein the sequences of the T-cell receptor alpha and beta chains from four NOD-derived, islet-specific clones. The sequences are quite heterogeneous--in the junctional regions, specifically--so there seems to be little hope for treating this disease with specific anti-T-cell receptor reagents. This result contrasts with the strikingly restricted junctional region sequences reported for the receptors on clones derived from mice with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, another T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease. We discuss possible explanations for this difference.\r"

To dissect the epitope specificity of the group-specific neutralizing antibodies, CD4 attachment site-specific antibodies (CD4-site Abs) were isolated from total anti-gp120 Abs by using a CD4-blocked gp120SF2-Sepharose column. The CD4-site Abs exhibited group-specific neutralizing activities. Another approach to dissecting type- and group-specific neutralizing activities of total anti-gp120 Abs was to separate the third variable region (V3)-specific antibodies (V3-region Abs) from non-V3-region-specific antibodies (non-V3 Abs). The results indicated that V3-region Abs exhibited type-specific neutralizing activities, whereas non-V3 Abs exhibited group-specific neutralizing activities. By comparing the neutralizing activities of V3-region Abs to those of non-V3 Abs, we concluded that V3-region Abs are more effective than non-V3 Abs in neutralizing a specific HIV isolate. Collectively, this study indicates that group-specific neutralizing anti-gp120 antibodies are specific for the CD4 attachment site.\r"

  ".U": "91296784\r", 
  ".W": "A high proportion of patients with myelodysplasia show characteristic karyotypic abnormalities in bone marrow cells. The most distinctive of the myelodysplastic syndromes is the 5q- syndrome characterized by refractory anemia, poorly lobulated megakaryocytes, and an interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q deletion) as the sole karyotypic abnormality. Recently, several genes encoding hemopoietic growth factors and receptors, comprising the interleukins 3, 4, and 5, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor, and the receptor for macrophage-colony-stimulating factor [the CSF1R (formerly FMS) gene product], have been localized to the long arm of chromosome 5, and there has been much speculation that deletion of one or more of these genes may be critical to the pathogenesis of the associated myeloid disorders. One candidate gene is CSF1R, which is required for normal proliferation and differentiation of hemopoietic cells of the myeloid lineage. We have carried out a molecular examination of the CSF1R, both on the 5q- chromosome and on the apparently normal homologous chromosome 5, in 10 patients with myelodysplasia and a 5q deletion. We have found, using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and gene dosage experiments, that all 10 patients showed deletion of CSF1R; 6 of 10 were hemizygous and 4 of 10 homozygous for CSF1R loss. The homozygous CSF1R loss has been confirmed in 2 patients by an in situ hybridization technique comparing the signal in affected cells to that in control sex-mismatched cells on the same slides. In those patients considered to have homozygous CSF1R loss by DNA experiments the gene was deleted from the 5q chromosome in all cells and from the apparently normal chromosome 5 in a subset of cells. This loss of one CSF1R allele, together with loss in some cells of the remaining allele on the homologous chromosome 5, in patients with myelodysplasia indicates that this is a region of critical gene loss on 5q. The loss of the hemopoietic growth factor receptor gene CSF1R may be important in the pathogenesis of human myeloid leukemia.\r"

The predicted amino acid sequence from the coding region of this cDNA shows that this protein contains approximately 50% hydrophobic amino acids with secondary structure predictions suggesting a large percentage of beta-sheet regions. No significant homologies were found with any other known proteins, including the nuclear lamins. The predicted amino acid sequence was also searched for DNA binding motifs. Two putative zinc finger motifs were found. In addition, a 7-mer palindromic sequence (Ser-Ser-Thr-Asn-Thr-Ser-Ser) was discovered within one of these zinc finger DNA binding regions. A possible regulatory role for this element is discussed.\r"

  ".U": "91296789\r", 
  ".W": "Productive binding of RNA polymerase II at the core region of TATA box-containing promoters is controlled by the action of the TATA factor and four additional transcription factors, designated alpha, beta gamma, delta, and epsilon, which have each been purified to near homogeneity from rat liver. This process is accomplished in three distinguishable stages. In the first stage (initial complex formation), the core promoter is packaged with the TATA factor into a binary complex that serves as the recognition site for RNA polymerase II. Here we show that, in the second stage (site selection), transcription factors alpha and beta gamma act in combination to promote selective binding of RNA polymerase II to the initial complex. Several lines of evidence argue that alpha and beta gamma function at this stage by a mechanism related to that utilized by bacterial sigma factors. In the third stage, transcription factors delta and epsilon promote assembly of the functional preinitiation complex. Our evidence supports the model that delta and epsilon enter the preinitiation complex and direct formation of stable protein-DNA contacts that anchor the transcription apparatus to the core promoter at sequences near the cap site.\r"

Phosphatidate-dependent phosphorylation of a 30-kDa protein in the soluble fraction from heart was also observed. This phosphorylation did not require Ca2+. Soluble fractions from liver, testis, brain, and lung phosphorylated the 30-kDa heart protein in a phosphatidate-dependent Ca(2+)-independent manner.

  ".W": "Insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) initiate their metabolic, growth, and differentiation effects through binding to the insulin receptor and the IGF-I receptor, two members of the tyrosine kinase family of receptors. To study the role of these peptides and receptors in early development, we used the polymerase chain reaction and embryo-derived RNA to generate partial cDNA sequences of the insulin receptor and IGF-I receptor from the amphibian Xenopus laevis. Three unique tyrosine kinase-related sequences were obtained. Two of the nucleotide sequences, XTK 1a and XTK 1b, corresponded to peptide that share 92% amino acid identity, and each is 89% identical to the human insulin receptor. The third sequence, XTK 2, corresponds to a peptide that has 92% amino acid identity with the human IGF-I receptor but only 80% identity with XTK 1a and XTK 1b. On the basis of these similarities, the pattern of conserved amino acids, and the tetraploid nature of the Xenopus genome, we suggest that XTK 1a and XTK 1b most likely represent the product of two different nonallelic insulin receptor genes, while XTK 2 may be one of the probable two Xenopus IGF-I receptor genes. By reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and gene-specific hybridization, expression of the three XTK sequences was detected in the oocyte, unfertilized egg, and embryos through gastrulation, neurulation, and tailbud stages. Competition binding assays with Xenopus membrane preparations demonstrated insulin receptors and IGF-I receptors in older tadpoles. IGF-I receptors were also present in oocytes, eggs, and gastrula embryos. By contrast, insulin binding was present but atypical in oocytes and was barely detected in eggs and gastrula embryos. The expression of receptors for insulin and IGF-I in early Xenopus embryos and their apparent distinct developmental regulation suggest that these molecules and their ligands may be important in early Xenopus development.\r"

This cDNA, sea urchin myogenic factor 1 (SUM-1), transactivated a muscle creatine kinase-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene in 10T1/2 fibroblasts to a level comparable to that of the vertebrate myogenic factors. In addition, bacterially expressed beta-galactosidase-SUM-1 fusion protein interacted directly with the kappa E-2 site in the muscle creatine kinase enhancer core as assayed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Stably transfected SUM-1 activated the muscle differentiation program and converted 10T1/2 cells from fibroblasts to myotubes. In sea urchin embryos, SUM-1 RNA was not detected before gastrulation. It accumulated to its highest levels during the prism stage when myoblasts were first detected by myosin immunostaining and then diminished as myocytes differentiated. SUM-1 protein was localized in secondary mesenchyme cells when they could first be identified as muscle cells by myosin immunostaining. These results implicate SUM-1 as a regulatory factor involved in the early decision of a pluripotent secondary mesenchyme cell to convert to a myogenic fate. SUM-1 is an example of an invertebrate myogenic factor that is capable of functioning in mammalian cells.\r"

We have performed scanning peptide studies to demonstrate that only this domain is capable of binding to the TAR RNA stem-loop. Strikingly, the basic domain of the other human immunodeficiency virus trans-acting factor, Rev, but no other region, is also capable of binding to TAR. Peptide derivatives of Tat do not require the highly conserved glutamine residue at position 54 for TAR binding, since it may be substituted or deleted. In addition, the two lysine residues may be replaced by arginines. Analysis of binding and trans-activation demonstrated that homopolymers of arginine can completely substitute for the basic domain. Such homopolymers have high affinity for wild-type TAR RNA and lower affinity for mutant TAR. Homopolymers of six to nine arginines substituting for the basic domain of Tat enable full trans-activation in vivo. Homopolymers of at least seven arginines are required for detectable in vitro complex formation, although approximately 30% trans-activation is achieved with a mutant Tat containing only five arginines.\r"

Combination of SCF with granulocyte, granulocyte-macrophage, or multipotential colony-stimulating factors, but not macrophage colony-stimulating factor, resulted in enhancement of colony size. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor enhanced cell proliferation initiated by SCF, but not vice-versa, and resulted in a 10-fold increase in colony cell numbers and a 7-fold increase in progenitor cells in blast colonies.

They differ from the InsP3 receptor structure previously reported in two small variably spliced segments. One segment (SI) is located within the InsP3 binding site, whereas another segment (SII) is located near putative sites for phosphorylation and ATP binding to modulate InsP3 action on Ca2+ flux. Therefore, we speculate that selective use of InsP3 receptor subtypes permits a tissue-specific and developmentally specific expression of functionally distinct channels.\r"

  ".U": "91296798\r", 
  ".W": "Cyclic AMP-dependent secretagogues such as cholera toxin inhibit the coupled absorption of Na+ and Cl- and stimulate the secretion of HCO3- and Cl- in the ileum. Aside from Cl- secretion, little is known about the mechanism of these cyclic AMP-mediated effects. We therefore determined the effect of forskolin, an agent known to increase intracellular cyclic AMP by stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, on Na+/H+ and Cl-/HCO3- exchange in isolated crypt and villus cells from rabbit ileum. Forskolin increased cyclic AMP in the villus cells and decreased intracellular pH. The effect of forskolin on pH in villus cells was HCO3- independent, Na+ dependent, and amiloride sensitive. Further, the rate of recovery from an acid load was decreased by forskolin. These data suggest that increasing cyclic AMP inhibits Na+/H+ exchange in villus cells. In crypt cells also, forskolin increased cyclic AMP; however, forskolin increased intracellular pH in these cells. The effect of forskolin in crypt cells was also HCO3- independent, Na+ dependent, and amiloride sensitive. However, the rate of recovery from an acid load was increased by forskolin, the opposite effect of that seen in villus cells. These data suggest that increasing cyclic AMP in crypt cells stimulates Na+/H+ exchange. Inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange on the brush border membrane in villus cells would be expected to inhibit coupled NaCl absorption (which occurs by coupling of Na+/H+ and Cl-/HCO3- exchange). Stimulation of Na+/H+ exchange in crypt cells, present only on the basolateral membrane, alkalinizes the cell, which would be expected to stimulate HCO3- secretion by stimulating the Cl-/HCO3- exchanger on the brush border membrane. Thus, these results provide a mechanism for some of the previously unexplained in vivo and in vitro effects of cyclic AMP on ileal electrolyte transport.\r"

Autophosphorylation of purified p56lck occurred at a rate of 25 fmol/min to a maximum incorporation of approximately 2 mol of phosphate per mol of p56lck with tyrosine-394 (but not tyrosine-505) and other, unidentified tyrosine residue(s) being the major sites of phosphorylation in vitro. Phosphorylation of tyrosine-containing peptides was monitored using an automated HPLC system. Although peptide substrate Km values were in the 1-5 mM range, the Vmax for the 13-amino acid peptide RRLIEDAEYAARG (modified p60src autophosphorylation site) was 120 min-1 (350 min-1 when adjusted for p56lck purity), suggesting that the enzyme purified from recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells has a high catalytic turnover compared with other tyrosine kinases.\r"

At wild-type levels of expression, the isolated CheAL/CheAS/CheW complex accounts for about 10% of the total number of CheAL, CheAS, and CheW molecules and exists in a 1:1:1 stoichiometry. This complex is also required for CheAL/CheAS and CheW binding to the phosphorylation substrate, CheY. A separate interaction between CheY and another chemotaxis component, CheZ, was also detected. The CheY-CheZ interaction does not require participation of the CheAL/CheAS/CheW complex.\r"

To validate the technique in a model system, the movements of lipid molecules were followed in a supported, planar bilayer containing fluorescein-conjugated phosphatidylethanolamine (Fl-PtdEtn) labeled with 30-nm gold anti-fluorescein (anti-Fl). Multivalent gold probes were prepared by conjugating only anti-Fl to the gold. Paucivalent probes were prepared by mixing an irrelevant antibody with the anti-Fl prior to conjugation. The membrane-bound gold particles moved in random patterns that were indistinguishable from those produced by computer simulations of two-dimensional random motion. The multivalent gold probes had an average lateral diffusion coefficient (D) of 0.26 x 10(-8) cm2/sec, and paucivalent probes had an average D of 0.73 x 10(-8) cm2/sec. Sixteen percent of the multivalent and 50% of the paucivalent probes had values for D in excess of 0.6 x 10(-8) cm2/sec, which, after allowance for stochastic variation, are consistent with the D of 1.3 x 10(-8) cm2/sec measured by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of Fl-PtdEtn in the planar bilayer. The effect of valency on diffusion suggests that the multivalent gold binds several lipids forming a disk up to 30-40 nm in diameter, resulting in reduced diffusion with respect to the paucivalent gold, which binds one or a very few lipids. Provided the valency of the gold probe is considered in the interpretation of the results. Nanovid microscopy is a valid method for analyzing the movements of single or small groups of molecules within membranes.\r"

However, the molecular mechanisms that trigger and subsequently regulate NK cell cytotoxicity are incompletely understood. We have therefore investigated the role of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in the transmembrane signaling initiated after Fc receptor stimulation or direct tumor cell contact in clonal CD16+/CD3- human NK cells. We report that stimulation of the Fc receptor rapidly induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of NK cell proteins. These effects occurred within 2 min, were maximal at 10 min, and declined toward baseline after 60 min. In addition, Fc receptor ligation increased the in vitro protein kinase activity of NK cell phosphotyrosyl proteins. We have also demonstrated that direct contact of NK cells with K562 tumor cells induced the rapid phosphorylation of distinct NK cell phosphotyrosyl proteins. Furthermore, the protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A blocked NK cell cytotoxic function in a concentration-dependent manner. Our results suggest that protein tyrosine phosphorylation is an obligatory early proximal signal in activating the cytotoxic function of NK cells.\r"

Using cultured hippocampus as a model system, we provide direct evidence that depolarization and impulse activity specifically increase nerve growth factor gene expression in neurons. Depolarizing stimuli, such as a high K+ concentration or the Na+ channel agonist veratridine, elicited a 3-fold increase of nerve growth factor mRNA levels in both explant and dissociated cultures. Blockade of depolarization by tetrodotoxin prevented the increase of neuronal nerve growth factor mRNA. Further, nerve growth factor gene expression was stimulated by picrotoxin, a gamma-aminobutyric acid antagonist frequently used to enhance hippocampal neuronal activity. Impulse regulation of trophic gene function may be relevant to developmental synaptogenesis and synaptic strengthening in learning and memory.\r"

This transition is often associated with deletion of the short arm of chromosome 17 in the form of the i(17q) aberration. Since the p53 gene is a suppressor gene and is located on 17p13, we examined the possibility that it is inactivated during progression of CML. Therefore, we studied the structure and expression of p53 in the leukemic cells of a large number of CML patients in acute phase. We found that although the gene is rarely rearranged, one p53 allele is completely deleted in patients with the i(17q) aberration as well as in some patients who do not show karyotypic changes. In all of these patients the remaining allele is inactivated through loss of expression, rearrangement, or point mutation. Detailed analysis of some patients who carry both p53 alleles indicated neither loss of expression nor structural alterations. It appears that p53 loss of function is associated with progression of around 25% of CML patients.\r"

The cited statistical classification schemes were then applied to these outcomes and 67 features of the compounds to ascertain those characteristics that are associated with biologic activity. For predicting duodenal ulceration, dipole moment, melting point, and solubility in octanol are particularly important, while for predicting adrenal necrosis, important features include the number of sulfhydryl groups and double bonds. These methods may constitute inexpensive but powerful ways to screen untested compounds for possible organ-specific toxicity. Mechanisms for the etiology and pathogenesis of the duodenal and adrenal lesions are suggested, as are additional avenues for drug design.\r"

The deduced amino acid sequence of this cDNA, GGT-rel, exhibited an overall similarity of 39.5% with human GGT. Sequences that could represent a heavy and a light chain, analogous to GGT, as well as a putative transmembrane region were identified in GGT-rel. Transfectants overexpressing GGT-rel were tested for their ability to catalyze cleavage of the gamma-glutamyl moiety from natural and synthetic substrates for GGT. Experiments with glutathione added to the medium suggested that GGT-rel could hydrolyze the gamma-glutamyl moiety. More definitive evidence was obtained in experiments in which this protein converted leukotriene C4 to leukotriene D4. However, GGT-rel did not convert synthetic substrates that are commonly used to assay GGT. Our results indicate that GGT can no longer be considered the only enzyme capable of cleaving the gamma-glutamyl linkage of leukotriene C4 and, most likely, of other natural compounds.\r"

  ".W": "Searches of ribosomal RNA sequences for compensatory base changes preserving Watson-Crick base pairing have led to detailed models of the conserved secondary structures of these RNAs. In principle, tertiary interactions can also be detected by searches for phylogenetically covariant bases. Within a highly conserved region of the large subunit ribosomal RNA termed the \"GTPase center,\" the bases G-1056-U-1082.A-1086 are found in all eubacteria (Escherichia coli numbering), while A-1056.C-1082.G-1086 are found at the homologous positions in eukaryotes; archaebacteria fall into either category with some exceptions. Either sequence can potentially form a similar set of hydrogen bonds connecting the 3 bases. To determine the contribution of these 3 bases to RNA tertiary structure, sequence variants were made in RNA fragments covering the GTPase center. Correct folding of the RNA fragments was assayed by measuring the binding affinities of two different ligands that recognize the RNA tertiary structure: the highly conserved ribosomal protein L11, which is normally associated with the GTPase center RNA, and the peptide antibiotic thiostrepton, which inhibits the GTPase activity of eubacterial and some archaebacterial ribosomes. The results strongly support the existence of a base pair between positions 1082 and 1086: single mutations at either position weaken both L11 and thiostrepton binding by approximately 10-fold or more, while compensatory double mutations bind the ligands nearly as well as the wild-type E. coli sequence. Variants at position 1056 have little effect on either L11 or thiostrepton binding; a 3-base interaction is therefore not supported by these experiments. A base pair between positions 1082 and 1086 strongly constrains the geometry with which three helical segments join in the middle of the GTPase center.\r"

This \"lamella-to-stalk\" transformation was found to be associated with the formation of microtubules enriched in detyrosinated alpha-tubulin. This change was local: microtubules in motile lamellas at the distal ends of the processes and in the cell bodies were not enriched in detyrosinated alpha-tubulin. Detyrosinated microtubules in the processes were more resistant to Colcemid treatment than other microtubules of PMA-treated and control cells. The effects of PMA were reversible and could be abolished by sphingosine, a specific inhibitor of protein kinase C. Besides modification of microtubules, lamella-to-stalk transformation is associated with the ingrowth of intermediate filaments into the extensions. Earlier it was found that this transformation is also associated with the profound reorganization of the system of actin microfilaments. Thus, all three cytoskeletal systems are altered simultaneously during PMA-induced formation of processes. Similar \"cytoskeletal synergies\" may play essential roles in many morphogenetic processes--e.g., in the growth of neurites.\r"

In the absence of costimulants, rhIL-7 stimulated the in vitro proliferation and colony formation of CD4+CD8+ double-positive immature fetal thymocytes. Furthermore, rhIL-7 promoted partial differentiation of immature thymocytes with a selective advantage for the development of CD4+CD8- single-positive thymocytes. Our observations suggest that IL-7 likely has an important regulatory role during the earliest stages of human T-cell ontogeny. Stimulation of fetal thymocytes with rhIL-7 resulted in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of three distinct phosphoproteins with molecular masses of 72, 98, 123, and 190 kDa and induced a rapid and biphasic increase in the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, which was inhibitable by the tyrosine protein kinase inhibitor genistein. Thus, the transmembrane signal triggered by engagement of the IL-7 receptor is intimately linked to a functional tyrosine protein kinase pathway and stimulates the inositol phospholipid turnover and proliferation, as well as selective differentiation to the CD4 lineage, by human fetal thymocytes.\r"

Both pentamer and hexamer homologies between control proteins and viruses are unexpectedly abundant, with hexamer matches occurring in 1 of 3 control proteins (or once every 769 aa). However, 2 nuclear antigens, the SLE-associated 70-kDa antigen and the scleroderma-associated CENP-B protein, are highly unusual in containing multiple homologies to a group of synergizing immunosuppressive viruses. Two viruses, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), contain sequences exactly duplicated at 15 sites in the 70-kDa antigen and at 10 sites in CENP-B protein. The immediate-early (IE) protein of HSV-1, which activates HIV-1 regulatory functions, contains three homologies to the 70-kDa antigen (two hexamers and a pentamer) and two to CENP-B (a hexamer and pentamer). There are four homologies (including a hexamer) common to the 70-kDa antigen and Epstein-Barr virus, and three homologies (including two hexamers) common to CENP-B and cytomegalovirus. The majority of homologies in both nuclear antigens are clustered in highly charged C-terminal domains containing epitopes for human autoantibodies. Furthermore, most homologies have a contiguous or overlapping distribution, thereby creating a high density of potential epitopes. In addition to the exact homologies tabulated, motifs of matching sequences are repeated frequently in these domains. Our analysis suggests that coexpression of heterologous viruses having common immunosuppressive functions may generate autoantibodies cross-reacting with certain nuclear proteins.\r"

  ".W": "Classification of humans as rapid or slow acetylators is based on hereditary differences in rates of N-acetylation of therapeutic and carcinogenic agents, but N-acetylation of certain arylamine drugs displays no genetic variations. Two highly homologous human genes for N-acetyltransferase (NAT; arylamine acetyltransferase, acetyl CoA:arylamine N-acetyltransferase, EC 2.3.1.5), NAT1 and NAT2, presumably code for the genetically invariant and variant NAT proteins, respectively. In the present investigation, 1.9-kilobase human genomic EcoRI fragments encoding NAT2 were generated by the polymerase chain reaction with liver and leukocyte DNA from seven subjects phenotyped as homozygous and heterozygous acetylators. Direct sequencing revealed multiple point mutations in the coding region of two distinct NAT2 variants. One of these was derived from leukocytes of a slow acetylator and was distinguished by a silent mutation (codon 94) and a separate G----A transition (position 590) leading to replacement of Arg-197 by Gln; the mutated guanine was part of a CpG dinucleotide and a Taq I site. The second NAT2 variant originated from liver with low N-acetylation activity. It was characterized by three nucleotide transitions giving rise to a silent mutation (codon 161), accompanied by obliteration of the sole Kpn I site, and two amino acid substitutions: Thr for Ile (codon 114) and Arg for Lys (codon 268). Heterozygosity was detected in three NAT2 samples: two were heterozygous for the rapid and one of the allelic variants, and the third was a compound heterozygote of both mutant alleles. The results show conclusively that the genetically variant NAT is encoded by NAT2.\r"

  ".U": "91296816\r", 
  ".W": "Nitric oxide (NO.), a free radical that is generated from L-arginine by stimulated endothelial cells, neutrophils, activated macrophages, and other cell types, reacts with superoxide anion (O2.-) to form peroxynitrite, which itself may be tissue toxic or can then react further to form the highly reactive and toxic hydroxyl radical (HO.). Because vascular injury produced by tissue deposition of immune complexes is linked to formation of toxic products derived from activated neutrophils, we have assessed whether immune complex-induced injury of rat lung and dermal vasculature is arginine dependent. The arginine analogue, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (N-MeArg), which blocks NO. formation, protects against immune complex-induced vascular injury in rats. The protective effects of N-MeArg are reversed by the presence of L-arginine but not D-arginine. Additionally, in the absence of N-MeArg, injury is enhanced by the presence of L-arginine but not by D-arginine. Protection by N-MeArg is not associated with diminished recruitment of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from animals undergoing immune complex deposition in lung contain the decomposition products of NO.--namely, nitrite and nitrate. In the presence of N-MeArg these products are greatly diminished. These data suggest that immune complex-induced injury of rat lung and skin is L-arginine dependent. These data also suggest that in vivo metabolic products of L-arginine, such as NO(.), are directly or indirectly linked to immune complex-induced tissue injury.\r"

In contrast, EBV protein expression in Burkitt lymphoma tissue or in newly established Burkitt lymphoma cell lines is frequently restricted to the EBV genome maintenance protein, EBNA-1. EBNA-1 expression in the absence of other EBNAs and LMP-1 has been an enigma since, in LCLs, all EBNA mRNAs are processed from a single transcript. We now show that the basis for restricted EBV expression in Burkitt lymphoma cells is selective EBNA-1 mRNA transcription from a hitherto unrecognized promoter that is 50 kb closer to the EBNA-1-encoding exon than previously described EBNA-1 promoters. Infected cells with EBNA-1-restricted expression could preferentially persist in vivo in the face of EBV-immune T-cell responses, which are frequently directed against other EBNAs and are also dependent on LMP-1 expression.\r"

  ".W": "Hematopoiesis is a continuous process in which precursor cells proliferate and differentiate throughout life. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern this process are not clearly defined. Homeobox-containing genes, encoding DNA-binding homeodomains, are a network of genes highly conserved throughout evolution. They are organized in clusters expressed in the developing embryo with a positional hierarchy. We have analyzed expression of the four human HOX loci in erythroleukemic, promyelocytic, and monocytic cell lines to investigate whether the physical organization of human HOX genes reflects a regulatory hierarchy involved in the differentiation process of hematopoietic cells. Our results demonstrate that cells representing various stages of hematopoietic differentiation display differential patterns of HOX gene expression and that HOX genes are coordinately switched on or off in blocks that may include entire loci. The entire HOX4 locus is silent in all lines analyzed and almost all the HOX2 genes are active in erythroleukemic cells and turned off in myeloid-restricted cells. Our observations provide information about the regulation of HOX genes and suggest that the coordinate regulation of these genes may play an important role in lineage determination during early steps of hematopoiesis.\r"

Kell antigens reside on a 93-kDa membrane glycoprotein that is surface-exposed and associated with the underlying cytoskeleton. We isolated tryptic peptides and, based on the amino acid sequence of one of the peptides and by using the PCR, prepared a specific oligonucleotide to screen a lambda gt10 human bone-marrow cDNA library. Four clones were isolated, one containing cDNA with an open reading frame for an 83-kDa protein. All known Kell amino acid sequences were present in the deduced sequence; moreover, rabbit antibody to a 30-amino acid peptide, prepared from this sequence, reacted on an immunoblot with authentic Kell protein. The Kell cDNA sequence predicts a 732-amino acid protein. Hydropathy analysis indicates a single membrane-spanning region, suggesting that Kell protein is oriented with 47 of its N-terminal amino acids in the cell cytoplasm, and a 665-amino acid segment, which contains six possible N-glycosylation sites, is located extracellularly. Computer-based search showed that Kell has structural and sequence homology to a family of zinc metalloglycoproteins with neutral endopeptidase activity.\r"

We now studied whether SMP expression is environmentally regulated in the different compartments of the peripheral nervous system. Quail neural-crest cells from either mes-metencephalic, vagal, or truncal levels of the neuraxis were heterochronically associated with gut wall, skin, or muscle tissues from embryonic day (E) 7 to E11 chickens. Coculture of these chimeric organs revealed that as in normal development glial cells, characterized by HNK1 immunoreactivity and the quail nuclear marker, expressed the SMP phenotype exclusively in skin and muscle, failing to do so in gut. However, when SMP+ SC from quail sciatic nerves were cocultured with chicken gut, these cells rapidly lost their initial SMP immunoreactivity. In contrast, when associated with muscle and skin, SC remained SMP+, even in the complete absence of neuronal cells. Enteric plexuses from E8 to E15 quail gut express SMP+ and laminin when withdrawn from the intestinal-mesenchyme environment. These results show that SMP can be expressed by enteric glial cells and that the SC SMP phenotype is strongly inhibited by the gut-wall environment. Moreover, these results strongly suggest that these two types of glial cells belong to the same lineage and that their terminal phenotype is modulated through cell-to-cell interactions.\r"

(1990) Science 250, 1694-1699]. We have confirmed this observation and shown that the E1-E2 complex binds to DNA fragments that contain the BPV plasmid maintenance sequence 1 and a site for the initiation of bidirectional BPV DNA synthesis. The E1 protein was found to bind preferentially to non- or underphosphorylated species of E2, suggesting that the phosphorylation state of E2 modulates the association of the two proteins. Replication-deficient E1 mutants with single amino acid substitutions and deletions in the carboxyl terminus failed to interact with E2, indicating that a region in the E1 carboxyl terminus is required for E1 to interact with E2. Our results suggest that the replication deficiency of some E1 mutants reflects their inability to associate with E2.\r"

  ".W": "Nitric oxide (NO) mediates several biological actions, including relaxation of blood vessels, cytotoxicity of activated macrophages, and formation of cGMP by activation of glutamate receptors in cerebellar slices. Nitric oxide synthase (EC 1.14.23.-) immunoreactivity is colocalized with nicotinamide adenine di-nucleotide phosphate diaphorase in neurons that are uniquely resistant to toxic insults. We show that the nitric oxide synthase inhibitors, N omega-nitro-L-arginine (EC50 = 20 microM) and N omega-monomethyl-L-arginine (EC50 = 170 microM), prevent neurotoxicity elicited by N-methyl-D-aspartate and related excitatory amino acids. This effect is competitively reversed by L-arginine. Depletion of the culture medium of arginine by arginase or arginine-free growth medium completely attenuates N-methyl-D-aspartate toxicity. Sodium nitroprusside, which spontaneously releases NO, produces dose-dependent cell death that parallels cGMP formation. Hemoglobin, which complexes NO, prevents neurotoxic effects of both N-methyl-D-aspartate and sodium nitroprusside. These data establish that NO mediates the neurotoxicity of glutamate.\r"

PHF is also found in several animal models of hypertension, including spontaneously hypertensive rats, and deoxycorticosterone acetate salt hypertensive rats. Plasma collected from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) was used in the present study for purification of PHF. Plasma was dialyzed at a molecular mass cutoff of 1 kDa, and then ultrafiltered at a molecular mass cutoff of 5 kDa. PHF activity, as determined by bioassay (characteristic delayed hypertensive response in normotensive rat) was retained in the fraction that was greater than 1 kDa and less than 5 kDa. Dialyzed and ultrafiltered SHR plasma was fractionated by molecular-exclusion chromatography, either with Bio-Gel P-6 liquid chromatography, or TSK 2000 SW HPLC. The biological activity was detected in a discrete region corresponding to a molecular mass of 2.5-3 kDa. When the molecular-exclusion fraction was subsequently fractionated by reverse-phase HPLC, biological activity was located in a single discrete peak, which did not occur in plasma from normotensive rats prepared in a similar manner. The biologically active fraction of PHF was inactivated by trypsin; this and its UV spectrum indicate the presence of a peptide structure.\r"

Recombinant rat SCF164 (rrSCF164) induced the development of large numbers of dermal mast cells in normal mice in vivo. Many of these mast cells had features of \"connective tissue-type mast cells\" (CTMC), in that they were reactive both with the heparin-binding fluorescent dye berberine sulfate and with safranin. In vitro, rrSCF164 induced the proliferation of cloned interleukin 3 (IL-3)-dependent mouse mast cells and primary populations of IL-3-dependent, bone marrow-derived cultured mast cells (BMCMC), which represent immature mast cells, and purified peritoneal mast cells, which represent a type of mature CTMC. BMCMC maintained in rrSCF164 not only proliferated but also matured. Prior to exposure to rrSCF164, the BMCMC were alcian blue positive, safranin negative, and berberine sulfate negative; had a histamine content of 0.08 +/- 0.02 pg per cell; and incorporated [35S]sulfate into chondroitin sulfates. After 4 wk in rrSCF164, the BMCMC were predominantly safranin positive and berberine sulfate positive, had a histamine content of 2.23 +/- 0.39 pg per cell, and synthesized 35S-labeled proteoglycans that included substantial amounts (41-70%) of [35S]heparin. These findings identify SCF as a single cytokine that can induce immature, IL-3-dependent mast cells to mature and to acquire multiple characteristics of CTMC. These findings also directly demonstrate that SCF can regulate the development of a cellular lineage expressing c-kit through effects on both proliferation and maturation.\r"

Although computed tomography, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and echocardiography greatly enhanced the ability to evaluate the aorta by noninvasive means, aortography remains the examination of choice for defining the vascular anatomy, especially when surgical intervention is considered. MR imaging may become the primary examination for the initial and subsequent evaluation of acute and chronic dissections as MR angiographic techniques improve and changes are made in monitoring equipment to allow the safe examination of acutely ill patients.\r"

Sixty-four patients ultimately proved to have intestinal obstruction, and 20 did not. Diagnosis was established by means of surgery (n = 39), barium studies (n = 17), and clinical course (n = 28). Causes of obstruction included adhesions (n = 37), metastases (n = 6), primary tumor (n = 7), Crohn disease (n = 4), hernia (n = 3), hematoma (n = 2), colonic diverticulitis (n = 2), and other (n = 3). In addition, 83 CT examinations in patients with no history or indication of intestinal obstruction were simultaneously reviewed. The overall sensitivity was 94%, specificity was 96%, and accuracy was 95%. The cause of obstruction was correctly predicted in 47 of 64 cases (73%). Intestinal obstruction was not diagnosed in any of the 83 control patients. CT is most useful in patients with a history of abdominal malignancy and in patients who have not been operated on and who have signs of infection, bowel infarction, or a palpable abdominal mass.\r"

Short-axis diameters of the lymph nodes were measured in 130 patients who were not likely to have enlarged abdominal lymph nodes. Seven locations were defined, and the largest nodal measurement for each was recorded. Histographic analysis and nonparametric statistical methods were used to determine threshold values for the maximum node size in each region. The upper limits of normal by location were as follows: retrocrural space, 6 mm; paracardiac, 8 mm; gastrohepatic ligament, 8 mm; upper paraaortic region, 9 mm; portacaval space, 10 mm; porta hepatis, 7 mm; and lower paraaortic region, 11 mm. Lower paraaortic lymph nodes larger than 11 mm by short-axis measurement are abnormal. In other locations, nodes smaller than 1 cm may be abnormal if the determined thresholds are exceeded.\r"

The authors examined four patients in whom esophagograms (one single-contrast and three double-contrast studies) revealed giant, HIV-related ulcers indistinguishable from those of cytomegalovirus (CMV) esophagitis. All four patients had severe odynophagia, one had an associated maculopapular rash, and two became HIV-positive at approximately the time of clinical presentation. In all patients, biopsy samples, brushings, and cultures obtained with endoscopy were negative for CMV or herpes simplex. One patient had positive brushings for candidiasis, but this may have resulted from fungal superinfection of the ulcer. Two patients were treated with orally administered steroids, and all four had swift clinical improvement; symptoms disappeared during an average period of 8.3 days from presentation. HIV-related esophageal ulcers should be distinguished from CMV ulcers, so that appropriate treatment can be initiated in these patients.\r"

Signal intensity and morphologic patterns of 157 lesions were scored. The morphologic patterns were correlated with the histologic material obtained at segmental hepatic resections or excisional biopsies in 33 patients. In 154 lesions (98%) colorectal metastases to the liver were found to be hyperintense on MR images acquired with a long repetition time/echo time; in 77 lesions (49%) central low-signal-intensity changes were seen. Virtually all larger lesions demonstrated areas of low signal intensity within the tumor. These areas were found to reflect histologic findings of coagulative necrosis and desmoplasia within the tumor. Peripheral hyperintense halos around central hypointense areas encompassed the growing tumor margin and variable degrees of cell necrosis. Hypointense peripheral rims, which correspond to abnormalities of surrounding hepatic parenchyma, were seen in 40 lesions (25%). This sign should not be assumed to represent the fibrous pseudocapsule of primary hepatic malignancy. No correlation between tumor grade (differentiation) and tumor morphology was observed.\r"

Seventeen patients also underwent MR imaging 6 months after completion of therapy. In 11 patients, computed tomography was performed before and after treatment. After PEI, fine-needle biopsy specimens were obtained in all cases. Before treatment, HCC lesions had low signal intensity on T1-weighted images in 13 cases, had the same signal intensity as normal liver parenchyma in six, and had high signal intensity in four; all 23 tumors had high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. After treatment and at 6-month follow-up, all 21 lesions that contained no malignant cells at fine-needle biopsy had high signal intensity on T1-weighted images and had low signal intensity on T2-weighted images. The remaining two HCC lesions in which tumor necrosis was not achieved with PEI displayed a different MR pattern, since the residual neoplastic tissue showed no change in signal intensity on either T1- or T2-weighted images. The authors conclude that MR imaging may be useful for evaluating the effectiveness of PEI in achieving tumor regression.\r"

Tumors were grouped according to the percentage of the analyzed section that was occupied by tumor: less than 50% (group A) or more than 50% (group B). In group B, all phosphomonoester/beta-adenosine triphosphate ratios were significantly higher than normal (P less than .001). Hepatocellular carcinomas and metastases from various primary neoplasms could not be differentiated on the basis of spectral characteristics and metabolite ratios. Limitations of one-dimensional surface coil CSI prevented separation of spectra of small tumors and tumors deep within the liver parenchyma from spectra of normal liver parenchyma.\r"

Twenty-seven patients had common bile duct stones; 23, intrahepatic stones. Three steps were used: A transhepatic bilicutaneous fistula was created, a wide communication between the bile duct and the gut was established, and contact shock wave lithotripsy was performed under endoscopic guidance. Afterward, 46 patients were free of stones. In four patients with diffuse intrahepatic lithiasis, only 75% of stones could be cleared. Severe complications, seen in 11 patients (hemobilia necessitating transfusion [n = 6], bile duct perforation resulting in cholangitis [n = 3], acute pulmonary edema [n = 1], and hemothorax [n = 1]), were fatal in four patients; all occurred early in the study. The authors modified their technique by dilating the biliary tract in two sessions 3 days apart, waiting 6 days for the tract to mature, and then introducing the cholangioscope directly through the skin, significantly reducing complications and mortality (P less than .005).\r"

All stents were placed with fluoroscopic guidance without any technical failures or procedural morbidity or mortality. Mild reflux occurred in three patients in whom the stent tubes straddled the distal esophageal sphincter. Five patients were still alive after 1-8 months. The remaining four patients died 6-28 weeks after stent placement; all stents were patent at the time of death. These stents are easy to insert, safe, and reasonably effective for short-term palliative treatment of esophagogastric neoplasms.\r"

The only complication was one case of severe nausea after choledochoscopy. This patient required overnight hospitalization and medical treatment. All procedures were technically successful, except one case in which the tract was undersized. All patients received intravenously administered antibiotics before and after the procedure. It is concluded that choledochoscopy is a safe, atraumatic, and well-tolerated method of evaluating and treating biliary disease and that it markedly reduces radiation exposure.

Left (n = 3) and right (n = 5) renal arteries were involved; renal artery stenosis in two patients had developed after kidney transplantation. Indications for stent placement were inadequate immediate postangioplasty response (n = 7), development of considerable restenosis after angioplasty (n = 1), and obstructing intimal flaps following transaortic endarterectomy (n = 2). Stent placement was technically successful (less than 20% residual stenosis) and patency was preserved in eight patients. Of the seven hypertensive patients with successful implantation, two were cured, three had improvement, and two had no change at latest follow-up evaluation (mean, 10.6 months; range, 6-12 months). The Strecker stent may be helpful in treating restenosis after failed revascularization procedures, although the precise indication, true safety, and long-term efficacy of stent placement in renal arteries will not be known until trials with more subjects and longer follow-up periods are completed.\r"

The portal flow per unit of cardiac output decreased in patients who underwent massive or major hepatectomy, patients with a cirrhotic liver, and patients who had a satisfactory postoperative course. Postoperatively, the portal flow in patients with a poor clinical outcome (multiple organ failure, hepatic failure, and cardiorespiratory failure) decreased significantly. Monitoring portal hemodynamic values appears to be useful in providing an index of \"hepatic functional reserve.\" Adequate portal flow is essential for postoperative hepatic regeneration; changes in portal hemodynamic values may be directly related to the patient's ability to survive surgery and to regain or maintain normal liver function.\r"

Confidence in the adequacy of the single-view follow-up was high in 91% of cases. The addition of the second mammographic view changed the one-view interpretation in approximately 1% of all cases. Two cancers were detected during the initial follow-up period. Both cancers were detected with single-view and standard two-view follow-up examinations, with high confidence. In this controlled retrospective study, the single-view follow-up examination was adequate for follow-up of most low-suspicion mammographic abnormalities. Monitoring by physicians, however, would be necessary to prevent an unacceptable number of patient recalls, which could make the one-view follow-up study impractical to use in some practices.\r"

As most images are read by a single observer and pathologic proof is obtained only if prompted by the report or if clinical symptoms warrant surgical intervention, it is difficult to construct a meaningful quality assessment program. The authors designed a program on the basis of a mammographic coding system that allows both individual physicians and practice groups to be evaluated. The program examines mammographic reports to determine the consistency of reporting by each physician and by the entire group. In addition, the program facilitated periodic evaluation of physicians with use of test cases. The coding system provided an easy method of correlating the mammographic reports with pathology reports from biopsy specimens, allowing a more thorough examination of possible systematic errors in the evaluation of the examinations, as well as enabling calculation of the positive predictive value for the diagnosis of cancer. The professional quality assessment program can be easily implemented in a busy clinical setting to evaluate whether mammograms were read consistently and \"correctly\" and to provide a method of continuing education for the physicians.\r"

Calcium was apparently lost both during preparation of the blocks (13.6%) and after slide preparation (12.6%), for a total possible loss of 26.2%. All specimens demonstrated calcification histologically. One pathology report was amended because of information obtained after recuts, but all cancers were detected on original slides whether or not calcifications were identified initially.

These scans demonstrated abnormal increase of pulmonary thallium uptake, whereas the gallium uptake was negative. In the authors' experience and in reports in the radiology literature, infected areas of the chest are generally thallium-negative on the delayed (3-hour) scans but are gallium-avid, whereas lymphomas are both thallium- and gallium-avid. The authors conclude that sequential thallium and gallium scans can be used to help diagnose pulmonary Kaposi sarcoma and distinguish it from other common AIDS-associated chest complications such as lymphoma and infections.\r"

The observers evaluated the visualization of normal pulmonary anatomy, various parenchymal abnormalities and their distribution, and artifacts. The low-dose and conventional scans were equivalent in the evaluation of vessels, lobar and segmental bronchi, and anatomy of secondary pulmonary lobules, and in characterizing the extent and distribution of reticulation, honeycomb cysts, and thickened interlobular septa. The low-dose technique failed to demonstrate ground-glass opacity in two of 10 cases (20%) and emphysema in one of nine cases (11%), in which they were evident but subtle on the high-dose scans. These differences were not statistically significant. Linear streak artifact was more prominent on images acquired with the low-dose technique, but the two techniques were judged equally diagnostic in 97% of cases. The authors conclude that HRCT images acquired at 20 mA yield anatomic information equivalent to that obtained with 200-mA scans in the majority of patients, without significant loss of spatial resolution or image degradation due to linear streak artifact.\r"

Findings with PTNB were diagnostic in 11 of 13 cases. Complications included minimal hemoptysis in one case and small pneumothoraxes in two cases, one of which required chest tube drainage. The authors did not experience the high complication rate reported previously by some authors who used this diagnostic procedure in AIDS patients. In cases in which findings at fiberoptic bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy and lavage failed to provide a diagnosis, PTNB provided a reliable, relatively safe diagnostic tool to establish the cause of pulmonary masses or focal infiltrates in AIDS patients.\r"

Twenty-one patients (19%) had endometrial thickness greater than 0.8 cm. One patient, with an endometrial thickness of 2.5 cm, had endometrial carcinoma. Consideration of the known actions of estrogen and progestogen on the endometrium led the authors to believe that the clinical significance of an endometrium measuring more than 0.8 cm depends on the patient's hormonal status. Among asymptomatic postmenopausal women with an endometrial thickness between 0.8 and 1.5 cm, those receiving unopposed estrogen or continuous estrogen and progestogen need to undergo dilatation and curettage (D&C) or biopsy and those receiving no hormones or receiving sequential estrogen and progestogen should be encouraged to undergo D&C or biopsy. If a patient in one of the latter two groups is unwilling to undergo an invasive procedure, then US examination at 3-month intervals is acceptable. Any patient with endometrial thickness of at least 1.5 cm should undergo histologic diagnosis, regardless of symptoms or hormone status.\r"

On day 2, markedly hypointense curvilinear areas in the endometrial canal were noted on MR images in all patients (P = .0002). By day 7, these areas decreased in size in five (62%) and completely resolved in the rest (P = .022). There was no significant change in the width of the endometrial stripe or in the width or signal intensity of the junctional zone or myometrium after D&C. The junctional zone was focally disrupted in one patient who underwent D&C that was complicated by a uterine perforation. Therefore, curvilinear areas of low signal intensity (most likely representing clot) in the endometrial canal were visualized on MR images within 2 days of uncomplicated D&C and decreased in size or resolved over time. Significant widening of the endometrial stripe or disruption of the junctional zone was not observed after uncomplicated D&C.\r"

In patients with ureteral calculi, three patterns of ureteral jets were seen: no detectable urine flow from the symptomatic side (12 patients), low-level continuous flow from the symptomatic side (four patients), and periodic ureteral jets on the symptomatic side that were not significantly different from ureteral jets of healthy subjects (10 patients). Of the 12 patients with high-grade obstruction on urograms, 11 had ureteral jets significantly different from those of healthy subjects (either no detectable ureteral jets or continuous low-level jets on the symptomatic side). Only three of the 11 patients with low-grade obstruction or nonobstructing stones had ureteral jets that were different from those of healthy subjects. It is concluded that analysis of ureteral jets with color Doppler can enable detection and qualitative determination of the degree of ureteral obstruction in many patients with unilateral ureteral calculi.\r"

In all patients, the stricture was successfully treated with stent insertion. Urethrography performed 1 month later in 19 patients showed an irregular intrastent lumen of varying degrees due to a hyperplastic urothelial reaction confirmed at endoscopy the same day. Available follow-up urethrograms in seven patients at 3 months showed that the hyperplasia was settling, and by 6 months, the intrastent lumen was smooth and of good caliber. Urethrography revealed postoperative structures in 14 patients. Strictures seen at 1 month (n = 6) were due to initial stent misplacement and were treated with the insertion of a second stent. Strictures seen 3 months after insertion (n = 4) occurred within the stent lumen and were considered to be significant at endoscopy in only one patient.

A double-J stent was placed after dilation of the tract by use of angioplasty. Neotracts were established and stents were placed in all patients. Complications (digestive tract fistulas) developed in two patients. This technique is safe if the electrode is placed close to the bladder or ileal loop.

During the US examination of the last 54 patients, who underwent 70 elective neck dissections, US-guided FNAC was performed. US alone was found to be an unreliable method for detecting occult lymph node metastasis; the accuracy never exceeded 70% (93 of 132), with a sensitivity of 60% (32 of 53) and a specificity of 77% (61 of 79). In contrast, US-guided FNAC had an accuracy of 89% (62 of 70), a sensitivity of 76% (25 of 33), and a specificity of 100% (37 of 37). Because of the high sensitivity and specificity of US-guided FNAC for the assessment of the N0 neck, this modality may play an important role in directing treatment of these patients in the future.\r"

Temporal bone fractures were observed at CT in 23 of 26 cases of TMJ fossa air, but in three of 26 cases, TMJ fossa air was the only CT sign of clinically apparent temporal bone fractures. TMJ fossa air is associated with acute temporal bone fracture and may be the only CT sign of an otherwise inconspicuous temporal bone fracture.\r"

A common radiologic feature was lack of mass effect or edema in white matter surrounding even large lesions. In all but four patients the lesions were classified as active by using both histologic and clinical criteria. Histologically active lesions had various radiologic appearances; however, in all contrast-enhanced studies they demonstrated some form of enhancement. Inactive lesions were homogeneously hypoattenuating on CT scans, hypointense on short-TR MR images, and hyperintense on unenhanced, long-TR MR images.\r"

MR imaging typically demonstrates bilateral hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted images and iso- to hypointense lesions on T1-weighted images. MR imaging abnormalities are most commonly located in the distribution of the posterior cerebral circulation and are associated with visual disturbances. Basal ganglia and deep white matter lesions are less common and are associated with mental status changes. Most lesions seen at MR imaging in patients with eclampsia are reversible.\r"

Fifteen patients also underwent contrast studies with the standard dose (0.1 mmol/kg) of gadopentetate dimeglumine. Both gadopentetate dimeglumine and gadoteridol appear to have a similar effect when given in equal doses (0.1 mmol/kg, n = 5). Lesion enhancement and delineation were better at higher experimental doses (0.2 or 0.3 mmol/kg, n = 7) and worse at a lower experimental dose (0.05 mmol/kg, n = 3). Quantitative analysis of 10 lesions examined with identical imaging protocols revealed a directly proportional relationship (r = .975) between lesion contrast ratio and dose over a range of 0.05-0.3 mmol/kg. Phantom experiments support the clinical results. Improved enhancement, detection, and delineation of central nervous system (CNS) neoplasms resulting from increased injected doses of gadoteridol have the potential to be clinically significant and may justify the possibly higher cost of increased contrast material dosage. Lower doses may not be adequate for the evaluation of most CNS tumors.\r"

Enhancement of normal bone marrow was seen in all patients aged less than 7 years; it was marked only in patients aged less than 2 years. Enhancement of normal cartilage, seen in all patients aged less than 1 1/2 years, may be the most striking feature of enhanced MR images of the infant spine. Enhancement of both bone marrow and cartilage in children appears to be due to the unusual prominence of vasculature, associated with permeability of the capillary endothelium and a plentiful extravascular space. Although marked and diffuse enhancement of vertebral bodies in adults is often thought to indicate a pathologic marrow state, caution must be used before the same criteria are applied to children.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-nine 15-year-old children with low-back pain (LBP) and 39 asymptomatic control children were selected from a population of 1,503 children of the same age for a magnetic resonance imaging study of the lumbar spine. Subjects with LBP were matched with control subjects by age, sex, and school class. Disk degeneration (DD) was present in 15 (38%) of the children with LBP and in 10 (26%) of the control subjects. Lumbar degeneration was most frequently associated with disk protrusion and Scheuermann-type changes. Of assessed structural abnormalities (disk protrusion, Scheuermann-type changes, transitional vertebra, and disk space narrowing), only disk protrusion was more common in children of the LBP group than in control subjects. The authors conclude that DD is a frequent finding among children with LBP at the age of 15 years. Asymptomatic (possibly physiologic) DD also is frequently found in children of this age. Whether DD associated with structural changes predisposes to low-back disorders can be confirmed only by means of a longitudinal follow-up study.\r"

Intermediate- and T1-weighted MR sequences revealed persistent signal intensity extending to an articular surface (grade 3 signal intensity) in 27 of the 30 menisci. On T2-weighted images, seven of the 30 menisci were found to contain unequivocally higher signal intensity, defined by a full-thickness defect (grade 3 signal intensity involving two articular surfaces) increasing in signal intensity to a level equivalent to that of joint fluid. The MR imaging and arthrographic appearances of 23 of the 30 menisci were compared. Arthrographic examination revealed partial or complete healing in 13 menisci and tears in 10. The presence of grade 3 signal intensity on intermediate- and T1-weighted MR images did not reliably predict a tear seen at arthrography. Unequivocally higher signal intensity on T2-weighted images is a useful sign in the prediction of a persistent meniscal tear (sensitivity, 60%; specificity, 92%; P less than .02). Since presence of grade 3 signal intensity on intermediate- and T1-weighted images does not reliably predict a tear and unequivocal T2 increase in intensity has a sensitivity of only 60%, arthrography should be considered for assessment of the symptomatic, previously repaired meniscus.\r"

The spectrum of abnormalities associated with medial displacement of the biceps tendon seen at magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was reviewed in six patients. MR imaging was performed on a 1.5-T system with use of a dedicated surface coil. The findings at MR imaging were correlated with those at surgery. Two types of medial displacement of the biceps tendon were identified. More frequently observed was a defect in the subscapularis apparatus that allowed intraarticular entrapment of the biceps tendon. Less commonly observed was incomplete dislocation, with the biceps tendon lying between a partially disrupted subscapularis tendon. MR imaging enabled accurate identification of medial dislocation of the biceps tendon and entrapment of the tendon within the glenohumeral joint. MR imaging also demonstrated the associated disruption of the subscapularis tendon that must be present to allow the biceps tendon access to the joint space.\r"

Advantages of computed tomographic (CT)-guided sacral fixation include direct visualization of the course of the screws and absence of significant complications. Eight patients with unstable but reducible sacral fractures or sacroiliac joint (SIJ) disruptions (seven unilateral and one bilateral) underwent CT-guided sacral fixation with use of the standard orthopedic A-O, 7.0-mm-diameter cannulated screw system. The guide pin was positioned across the fracture or SIJ by using depth and angulation measurements derived from the scout CT scans. After confirmation of the position of the pin with CT, the screw tract was drilled, and the cannulated screw was placed into position. Radiographic and clinical follow-up (5-9 months) showed healing with no significant complications in all eight patients. CT-guided sacral fixation is a safe alternative to ORIF in patients with reducible unstable pelvic fractures.\r"

Diagnostic criteria of dark marrow on T1-weighted images and bright marrow on short-tau inversion-recovery images yielded a prospective sensitivity of 98% and a prospective specificity of 75%. Sixty percent of uncomplicated septic joint effusions demonstrated abnormal marrow signal intensity that was mistaken for osteomyelitis. Retrospective review revealed that overall specificity could be improved to 82% without loss of sensitivity if increased marrow signal intensity on T2-weighted images were included as an additional criterion. Specificity may be further increased by use of knowledge of morphologic patterns that distinguish various forms of osteomyelitis. Ten patients (9%) had potential pitfall diagnoses (eg, fracture, infarction, healed infection) that mimic osteomyelitis. MR imaging can be sensitive and specific for osteomyelitis if characteristic appearances and pitfall diagnoses are incorporated into the diagnostic criteria.\r"

With this technique (variable-rate spin-echo pulse sequence), the repetition time and echo time (TR msec/TE msec) were reduced during imaging as a function of the phase-encoding view. To maintain T2-based contrast, TR and TE for the low-spatial-frequency views were left at their prescribed values (eg, 2,000/80). TR and TE for the high-spatial-frequency views were progressively reduced during imaging (eg, to 1,000/20). Acquisition time was reduced by as much as 25%. In one pulse sequence, the duration of multisection imaging nominally performed at TR 2,000 and with 256 phase-encoding views was reduced from 9 minutes 30 seconds to 6 minutes 30 seconds. In all sequences, edges and small structures were enhanced, and T2 contrast was somewhat decreased in high spatial frequencies. Filtering of the raw data before reconstruction can suppress these effects and provide a net increase in contrast-to-noise ratio.\r"

Of the 98 chest radiographs reviewed blindly, all inadequately marked radiographs and incomplete written reports were produced by nonradiologists. Technical quality of images obtained by radiologists did not significantly differ from that of images obtained by nonradiologists (P = .189). All five interpretive errors that could have seriously affected the patient's health care were produced by nonradiologists (P = .019). Four of these serious errors were made by providers billing for fewer than 25 radiographs.

Patients had rectal, anal, cervical, vaginal, urethral, or vulvar cancer. Use of a special lead compensator allowed the three beams to be applied perpendicularly to the surface, while delivery of a homogeneous dose to the pelvis and perineum was maintained. Skin dose with this method was greatly reduced compared with that delivered with simple opposing or four-port techniques, in which irradiation is tangential to the surface at the perineum. Acute perineal skin irritation was assigned a grade between 0 and 3, with grade 0 representing the least amount of irritation. All patients were in the grade 0 or grade 1 category. Patients treated for low-lying rectal carcinoma showed no increase in perineal recurrences when compared with historic control subjects. Use of this approach allowed delivery of adequate doses to the pelvis and perineum and a definite decrease in local toxic effects, and local control was not compromised.\r"

A comparative trial of aztreonam for treatment of neonatal sepsis showed it to be at least as effective as amikacin for this infection. Aztreonam yielded clinical results comparable to those of conventional combined therapy for pulmonary infection in patients with cystic fibrosis. Adverse effects in pediatric trials have been uncommon; fever, diarrhea, or rash occurred in less than 2% of treated children. Reversible laboratory abnormalities have occasionally been noted. On the basis of these data, aztreonam is considered an appropriate alternative agent for the treatment of serious gram-negative bacterial infections in neonates and children. Further comparative clinical trials will delineate specific indications.\r"

Seventy-seven patients had microbiologically confirmed gram-negative meningitis due to an aztreonam-susceptible organism and received aztreonam for at least 48 hours. Haemophilus influenzae was the most frequently recovered pathogen (40 patients), followed by Enterobacteriaceae (16 patients), Neisseria meningitidis (15 patients), and Pseudomonas species (six patients). All but four patients were microbiologically cured. Microbiologic failure was associated with either a persistent intracerebral abscess (one patient) or a foreshortened course of therapy before microbiologic reevaluation and death (at 48 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours after initiation of treatment, respectively). These data suggest that aztreonam is effective in the treatment of gram-negative bacillary meningitis caused by susceptible organisms.\r"

The others tolerated aztreonam, with an improvement in clinical score greater than or equal to 1 month after treatment (P less than .001). One patient without previous exposure had positive aztreonam skin tests and was later treated uneventfully after iv desensitization. Treatment with aztreonam did not result in IgG or IgE antibody responses in vitro. However, two patients had anaphylactic reactions on reexposure. In patients with CF, allergy to beta-lactam antibiotics is primarily drug-specific. But despite reduced immunogenicity and cross-reactivity, aztreonam should be administered cautiously to patients with CF who are allergic to other beta-lactam antibiotics because it is potentially allergenic with repeated use.\r"

All samples from the abdominal cavity yielded microorganisms; both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were isolated. Wound infections occurred in eight patients (12.1%) in the aztreonam group and in 12 patients (16.7%) in the gentamicin group. Escherichia coli, Bacteroides species, enterococci, and staphylococci were isolated most frequently from wounds and were often isolated from bacteriologic samples from the abdominal cavity of the same patients. The incidence of septic complications reflected the extent of nutritional and immunologic impairment. No significant differences were found between groups in the rate of urinary tract or lower respiratory tract infections.

Monotherapy with aztreonam was continued in 34 episodes of gram-negative peritonitis in 28 patients. The microorganisms isolated included Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter species, Pseudomonas species, and Klebsiella species. In three episodes, two organisms were cultured. Microbiologic assessment revealed cure in 27 episodes, cure with relapse in two, cure with superinfection in one, and treatment failure in four (with resistance to aztreonam in three). As assessed by clinical criteria, 27 episodes were cured, five failed to respond, and two responded partially. No adverse reactions to aztreonam were observed. Comparison of these 34 episodes with 35 episodes in historical controls (treated mainly with aminoglycosides and/or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) showed significantly higher rates of cure (84% vs. 51%) and of survival (97% vs. 86%) as well as lower rates of catheter removal (65% vs. 87%) with aztreonam.

Criteria for inclusion in the study included documented infection due to gram-negative bacilli and a measurement of severity of disease of less than 12 (as defined by a Simplified Acute Physiology Score for the 115 cases of community-acquired infection). Other than aztreonam, no antibiotic active against gram-negative bacilli was allowed to be used for treatment. Seventy-one patients in whom gram-positive or anaerobic organisms were detected or suspected were given additional agents effective against the organisms. One hundred forty-one patients (92.2%) were cured; the mean duration of treatment was 10.9 +/- 4.0 days. None of the gram-negative bacilli initially isolated became resistant to aztreonam. Colonization, generally by a gram-positive organism, was observed in 27 patients and superinfection was observed in five. Aztreonam was well tolerated.

  ".W": "The efficacy and safety of aztreonam for treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections in patients with renal failure were evaluated in an open study. Thirty-nine patients (22-82 years old) with renal failure (chronic, 25; acute, 14) were treated for 40 severe gram-negative bacterial infections. All 41 gram-negative pathogens isolated were sensitive to aztreonam; the pathogens included Escherichia coli (12), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8), Klebsiella species (7), Proteus species (7), Enterobacter species (5), Serratia marcescens (1), and Acinetobacter species (1). Complete cure (clinical and bacteriologic) was achieved in 31 (77.5%) of 40 infections and improvement (clinical improvement with or without bacteriologic cure) in four (10%). Bacterial eradication of 34 (82.9%) of the infecting pathogens was achieved. The only significant adverse effect noted was a slight, transient elevation in the level of serum transaminases in four patients (10%). Renal function of the patients improved with treatment. Levels of serum creatinine decreased from 3.79 +/- 2.84 to 3.30 +/- 2.52 mg/dL after treatment (P less than .002). It was concluded that aztreonam is effective and safe for the treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections in patients with renal failure.\r"

  ".W": "A marked increase in the number of cases of shigellosis was reported in Kentucky in 1988. To examine reasons for this increase, we reviewed the 389 cases of shigellosis reported from 1986 through 1989. Ninety-three percent (285/305) of cases due to known species were due to Shigella sonnei. Sixty-two percent (243/389) of cases occurred in children less than 10 years of age. The annual incidence for blacks (6.8 cases per 100,000) was nearly four times that for whites (1.8 per 100,000). The increased number of cases in 1988 was due to outbreaks in five areas of the state, which accounted for 85% (200/234) of the cases. Three of the five outbreaks involved day-care centers. The primary mode of transmission appeared to be person-to-person; there was no evidence of a common source of infection from food or water. To prevent future outbreaks, cases of shigellosis need to be reported promptly to ensure appropriate investigation and control by local health departments.\r"

We found 17 additional cases in the literature. A known predisposing risk factor for invasive aspergillosis, eg, neutropenia, corticosteroid use, or intravenous drug abuse, was present in 79% of the cases. That the known immunologic defect of AIDS is not a major host defense against Aspergillus is supported by the empiric observation of the relative rarity of aspergillosis in patients with AIDS. The lung was the most common site of Aspergillus infection (75%), and transbronchial biopsy is diagnostically useful. Central nervous system involvement was seen in 55% and appears to be more frequent in HIV-infected patients than in other immunosuppressed patients with invasive aspergillosis. Prognosis is grim. Despite early institution of amphotericin B therapy in a few cases, the disease was uniformly fatal. Efficacy of therapy with amphotericin B plus rifampin or itraconazole remains to be evaluated. We conclude that aspergillosis is not an AIDS-related opportunistic infection.\r"

Two patients had an acute fatal course, one had chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis ending in an acute fatal course, and the other had a semiacute disease that responded to amphotericin B. Autopsy on three patients showed invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in both lungs, and tissue invasion was documented by transbronchial biopsy in the patient who survived. Retrospective review of all cultures that grew Aspergillus species from bronchoscopic specimens showed no false-positive results, and this procedure proved to be the most useful maneuver in making the diagnosis. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis should be in the differential diagnosis in patients with COPD and unexplained pulmonary infiltrates.\r"

Complete EBV serologic panels were obtained for 154 patients, 35 (23%) of whom met serologic or clinical criteria for chronic or reactivated EBV infection. We compared these patients with chronic EBV infection (CEBV cases) to 35 age- and sex-matched patients who were selected from the same cohort of fatigued patients but who did not meet the criteria (CEBV control subjects). We found few differences between groups in demographic characteristics, clinical features, and symptoms; CEBV cases were more likely to meet criteria for the proposed chronic fatigue syndrome (14% vs 0%), and to report that they suffered from an influenza-like illness at the onset of their fatigue syndrome (34% vs 12%), that they lost their job because of their fatigue (37% vs 11%), and that their fatigue was improved by recreational activity (26% vs 3%). Physical examination and laboratory testing showed few abnormalities in either group. Psychiatric morbidity was common in both groups, including mood disorders (63% of CEBV cases vs 54% of CEBV controls), anxiety (11% vs 9%) and somatization disorder (9% in each group). We conclude that EBV serologic patterns have little clinical usefulness in evaluating patients with chronic fatigue.\r"

Electrocardiograms recorded on admission (initial ECG) and the most recent available electrocardiogram recorded before admission (previous ECG) were compared to determine whether changes from the previous to initial ECG predicted acute myocardial infarction or complications of coronary artery disease. Initial ECGs were classed as either positive or negative, with positive indicating either infarction, injury, ischemia, strain, left ventricular hypertrophy, left bundle branch block, or paced rhythm. Negative ECGs were those that did not include any of the positive criteria. Positive and negative ECGs were subgrouped as showing change or no change from previous ECG. We found that patients with a negative initial ECG that had changed from the previous ECG had a 2.1 times greater risk for requiring interventions than those patients whose ECGs were unchanged. We also found that patients with a positive initial ECG that had changed from the previous ECG had a greater risk for interventions (2.0 times), complications (2.6 times), life-threatening complications (4.2 times), and acute myocardial infarction (6.6 times) than the sum of patients in all other ECG categories. We conclude that change is a useful predictor for interventions in patients with negative initial ECGs and a useful predictor for interventions, complications, and acute myocardial infarction in patients with positive initial ECGs.\r"

Male gender and a diagnosis of panic disorder occurred significantly more often in the patients with heart disease. \"Stress\" was cited as the cause of illness in about half the sample, but this led to less than satisfactory rates of psychiatric evaluation or pharmacotherapy.

The slide-based immunohistochemical technique demonstrated several distinct advantages relative to the tissue homogenization required by the traditional biochemical assay. With the use of frozen tissue sections, the immunohistochemical technique permitted direct visualization of antireceptor binding to tumor cells. Receptor staining of reactive stroma, necrotic tumor, and intermingled benign parenchyma was easily distinguished from receptor staining of the actual carcinoma. This separation is not possible with the biochemical assay. In addition, in situ and invasive components and different morphologic subtypes were evaluated independently. Receptor content of the most aggressive portion of the neoplasm is likely to have the greatest clinical relevance and prognostic significance. Careful correlation of histochemical scores with biochemical assay concentrations is needed to permit the application of this technique to patients entering cancer treatment protocols.\r"

To assess the feasibility of applying estrogen receptor immunocytochemical assay (ER-ICA) to cytologic specimens, we prospectively studied 100 patients who had fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of mammographically detected nonpalpable breast lesions. All 100 patients also had surgical excision of these nonpalpable lesions immediately after cytologic aspiration. Twenty malignancies were ultimately diagnosed by histology; 17 of them had been cytologically diagnosed. Using specific monoclonal antibody for estrogen receptor, we applied ER-ICA to cytologic preparation of 15 malignant neoplasms with sufficient cellular material available for the assay. Positive immunostaining was demonstrated in nine cases. No ER expression was seen in six cases. Immunocytochemical assay was also done on frozen tissue of the corresponding surgically removed tumors, with 86.6% concordance between the two results. This study is the first to demonstrate that ER-ICA can be effective in assessing hormone receptor content of mammographically directed cytologic aspirates.\r"

Mammography, breast self-examination, and clinical breast examination are effective methods for early detection and subsequent mortality reduction. The Tricounty Breast Cancer Screening Survey assessed knowledge of these methods and recommendations among 503 women in the Charleston area. While 57% of all respondents reported performing breast self-examination at least once per month, 13% of blacks and 6% of whites reported that they do not know how to perform the procedure. Clinical breast examinations within the past year were reported by 69%, yet 11% of blacks and 4% of whites reported that they had never had the examination. More than one third (40%) of all 503 women reported ever having had a mammogram, and 22% reported having had one within the past year. However, 18% of the blacks and 5% of whites reported never having heard of the procedure. The major barriers to mammography appear to be the belief that women do not need regular mammograms and the lack of recommendations by their physicians. Survey results support the need for educating women about what the procedures are, the importance of using them regularly, and the means to comply with them.\r"

Those under 18 years of age seldom tested positive for either cocaine or marijuana, regardless of race or marital status. Overall, white subjects were significantly more likely to have cannabinoid metabolites detected in the urine and blacks were more likely to test positive for cocaine use, but neither drug was found in married blacks. Although gravidity was significantly higher in the group testing positive for cocaine, so was parity. Thus, abortion did not correlate with cocaine use.\r"

To develop this method, a detailed survey of family practices geographically dispersed throughout Oklahoma was conducted in 1989. Data collected from family physicians and their administrative staff reflected the volume of ambulatory and hospital visits and the direct and indirect costs of the practice over the previous 12 months. Using the fixed and operating cost data, as well as number of patient visits and patient care revenue, we designed a model to project the economic feasibility of establishing a family practice in a specific community. This model can be used to project the number of visits a community can generate for a prospective family physician, as well as the direct and indirect costs, gross revenue, and net income of the practice.\r"

Patients who are treated for short-term palliation may be more safely given doses based on ideal body weight.\r"

Myocardial calcifications in infants are markedly different from those in adults; calcifications are significantly more frequent in cases of myocardial necrosis in the young, and can be demonstrated microscopically without removal of necrotic fibers and scar formation, which are the adult's usual stages of response to myocardial necrosis. Important functional and clinical implications in myocardial calcification, other than serving as a marker for necrosis, relate to accelerated myocardial calcification after cardiac surgery in infants.\r"

  ".W": "Maxillary sinus cancers are rare as compared with cancers of other sites. Because the onset is insidious, they are at an advanced stage at diagnosis and therefore present a therapeutic challenge for local control. Traditionally, treatment has been surgery or irradiation, or a combination of the two. Local control and survival, however, remains poor. Numerous chemotherapeutic agents have shown activity against squamous cell cancers of the head and neck. In several studies the use of either neoadjuvant or concurrent chemotherapy has improved local control and survival when compared with historical controls. Randomized studies are needed to confirm the benefit of chemotherapy over the standard forms of surgical and radiation therapy.\r"

  ".W": "We have described a case in which coronary vasospasm and the resultant endothelial shear stresses most likely caused plaque rupture and transient coronary occlusion at the site of a minor atherosclerotic narrowing. Remodeling then led to a long, complex stenotic lesion that included ruptured and dissected endothelium and organized thrombus. This led to severe anginal symptoms over a 3-month period, or the paradox of \"chronic unstable angina.\" Angioplasty was difficult but eventually successful after pulsed high-pressure balloon inflations and intracoronary thrombolytic therapy with streptokinase. This case demonstrates that the clinical course of a patient with minor or insignificant coronary disease may be a dynamic process that cannot be entirely predicted even by recent invasive cardiac studies.\r"

We argue that administration of hypochlorite in gum debridement, application of dental cement, or mechanical stimulation of the alveolar branches of the trigeminal nerve at the pulp may not only result in acute systemic hypertension, but also in the release of vasodilatory neurotransmitters. The combination of a local increase in intracerebral blood flow and simultaneously developing systemic hypertension in an occasional patient may lead to intracranial hemorrhage.\r"
