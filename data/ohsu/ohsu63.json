The diagnosis of AD was established neuropathologically in all 24 patients by the presence of both neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques in neocortex. The mean contents of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and of the GABA dipeptide homocarnosine, were significantly reduced in frontal and occipital cortices and in hippocampus of the autopsied brains of AD patients compared to control patients without neurological disease. However, GABA contents were normal in frontal cortex in biopsy samples from 2 patients. Phosphoethanolamine contents were significantly reduced at autopsy in frontal and occipital cortex, and in the substantia innominata. We found no evidence of a deficiency of glutamate, aspartate, or taurine in AD brain, as has been claimed. Glutathione contents and glutathione transferase activities were normal in frontal cortex and substantia innominata. The mechanism of neuronal death in patients with AD is unlikely to involve either insufficient synthesis of glutathione or failure to conjugate free radicals with glutathione.\r"

To explore the mechanisms responsible for these sequelae, a neonatal rat model was used to define the behavioral, electrophysiological, and biochemical changes following meningitis. Three days after inoculation of 6-day-old rats with a minimum of 1 X 10(7) colony-forming units of a virulent Hemophilus influenzae, type b, cerebrospinal fluid and blood were cultured to confirm the presence of meningitis and bacteremia, respectively. At this time, forebrain norepinephrine and dopamine levels were significantly elevated in meningitic rats when standardized on a wet-weight basis. No changes in brain serotonin or heart norepinephrine levels could be found in the 9-day-old rats. No residual changes were found in steady-state concentrations of norepinephrine or dopamine in surviving adult rats. However, survivors that had had meningitis as neonates showed significant impairment in active and passive avoidance learning tasks and demonstrated a significantly higher level of activity during a habituation period in circular photocell activity cages. No change in the flinch-jump threshold was detected. Brainstem auditory evoked potentials showed delays of various waves in 3 of 10 Hemophilus influenzae type b-treated adult rats tested. These rats also exhibited markedly augmented locomotory responses to d-amphetamine (1 mg/kg), suggesting a long-lasting perturbation of central monoamine neuronal transmission.\r"

All had bilateral independent epileptogenic discharges from the lateral and inferomesial regions of both hemispheres. Scalp and sphenoidal electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings suggested that the seizures originated from the side contralateral to the known cerebral lesion. Because the lateralizing evidence presented by the ictal EEG conflicted with the clinical data, depth electrodes were implanted stereotaxically to determine the side of onset of the seizures. These studies showed that the seizures originated from the limbic structures of the damaged hemisphere in all 3 patients. At operation the mesial temporal lobe structures showed gliotic changes in all. The patients have remained seizure-free for 3 to 13 years postoperatively. These findings suggest that depth electrode recordings may be required to clarify the lateralization of seizure onset in such cases. Extracranial EEG findings must be interpreted with caution in epileptic patients who have gross focal lesions.\r"

The rate of levodopa clearance from the general circulation, its plasma half-life, and apparent volume of distribution were indistinguishable between patients with the on-off or the wearing-off phenomenon and those with a stable response to levodopa or those who had not been previously treated with levodopa. Peripheral pharmacokinetic factors are thus unlikely to account for the development of these response fluctuations. Conversely, the efficacy half-time of levodopa differed markedly among the four response groups studied and may provide a quantitative index of central mechanisms that favor the development of the wearing-off and on-off phenomena. Although symptom duration was the best predictor of the severity of untreated parkinsonism, levodopa dose correlated best with response half-time. The wearing-off phenomenon may primarily reflect the loss of buffering capacity caused by degeneration of the dopamine neurons, while the development of the on-off phenomenon appears to require additional postsynaptic changes, possibly at the receptor level.\r"

Patients with Rett's syndrome have been observed to have stereotyped hand movements (hand-washing) and to exhibit intermittent hyperventilation. To characterize more precisely the sleep and respiratory patterns associated with this disorder, polygraphic studies were made during sleep and wakefulness in 11 patients with this syndrome. These studies showed abnormal respiratory patterns during wakefulness, and abnormal sleep and electroencephalographic characteristics. The patients had decreased percentages of rapid-eye-movement sleep, and during wakefulness, a pattern of disorganized breathing was observed in all 11 patients and consisted of hypoxia followed by a period of increased respiratory rate and effort. The occurrence of disorganized breathing and compensatory hyperpnea during wakefulness with regular, continuous breathing during sleep is characteristic of Rett's syndrome and suggests an altered or impaired voluntary/behavioral respiratory control system.\r"

This response operates under the constraints of Hering's law of equal innervation: any attempt to increase the innervation to a weak muscle in one eye must be accompanied by a commensurate increase in innervation to the yoke muscle in the other eye. In 4 patients with internuclear ophthalmoplegia, we patched one eye for 1 to 5 days to allow time for the central nervous system to optimize innervation for the habitually viewing eye. We predicted that there would be a conjugate adjustment of innervation that would diminish the abduction overshoot and backward postsaccadic drift made by the habitually viewing eye. This was the case in 3 of our 4 patients. Our findings show that the abduction nystagmus is a manifestation of a normal adaptive response in some patients with INO.\r"

There were no age-related differences in metabolite concentrations in either the Down's syndrome or control subjects. CSF concentrations of 5-HIAA, HVA, and norepinephrine were significantly higher in young subjects with Down's syndrome as compared with young controls, and CSF concentrations of 5-HIAA and norepinephrine were significantly higher, by twofold or more, in old subjects with Down's syndrome as compared with older controls. The results suggest that monoamine turnover and brain functional activity involving monoamines is elevated in Down's syndrome, and that the early neuropathological changes in the disorder are not associated with a monoamine deficit.\r"

Cefoxitin-resistant mutants from these species were isolated, and it was confirmed that the resistance was attributed to the lack of an outer membrane protein, resulting in a significant decrease in the penetration of hydrophilic cephalosporins through the outer membrane. Comparison of the mutant strains with their parental strains in the diffusion rates of six monoanionic cephalosporins, a zwitterionic cephalosporin (cephaloridine), and a divalent anionic cephalosporin (cephalosporin C) suggested that each species had only one kind of porin protein, with molecular weights of 40,000 (Proteus mirabilis) or 37,000 (the other four species) and that the porins formed channels with cation selectivity, except for Proteus vulgaris. Porin proteins were purified from all the bacterial species except Providencia alcalifaciens, and the radius of the pores formed by the purified porins was estimated by the use of the liposome swelling assay. The pore radii were estimated to be approximately 0.59 nm (Proteus mirabilis), 0.63 nm (Proteus vulgaris), 0.58 nm (Providencia rettgeri), and 0.60 nm (M. morganii), similar to the size of the pore radius of Escherichia coli porins.\r"

Ion pairing was used because ceftriaxone is a relatively polar compound which is poorly retained on C18 columns in standard reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and which produces trailing peaks in the absence of ion-pairing agents. The mobile phase was a combination of acetonitrile and water (46:54), adjusted to pH 9.0 with 10 mM K2HPO4, which contained 10 mM hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide as the ion-pairing agent. Moxalactam (200 micrograms/ml) was used as the internal standard. A silica-packed precolumn (3 cm long) was used to prevent rapid deterioration of the analytical column (30 by 0.4 cm) by the alkaline pH of the mobile phase, and it significantly extended the life of the analytical column. The assay was linear with ceftriaxone concentrations of 1 to 250 micrograms/ml (r = 0.999) and correlated well with an agar diffusion bioassay (r = 0.990). Reproducibility was good, with intrarun coefficients of variation from 2.3 to 6.4% and interrun coefficients of variation from 3.2 to 21.4%. The absolute recoveries of ceftriaxone and moxalactam were 91 to 97 and 96 to 98%, respectively. No interferences were observed with more than 40 commonly prescribed drugs, including 10 cephalosporins (cefotaxime, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, ceftizoxime, cefoxitin, cefamandole, cephalothin, cefazolin, cephapirin, and cephalexin), or with sera from patients with renal or hepatic disease.\r"

A study was conducted in 10 mongrel dogs to determine the effect of experimental hemorrhagic shock with resuscitation on the pharmacokinetics of gentamicin and cefazolin. Single simultaneous intravenous doses of gentamicin (3 mg/kg) and cefazolin (25 mg/kg) were administered to each animal on an initial study day, after which serial blood and urine collections were performed. After 1 week, a standard hemorrhagic shock model was applied to each animal. Shock was continued for 1 h, after which the animal was resuscitated with either whole blood or saline. After stabilization for 20 min, a second dose of gentamicin and cefazolin was administered, and blood and urine were again collected. Drug clearance was not significantly altered, except for that of cefazolin after saline resuscitation, for which there was a significant increase in drug clearance. After both methods of resuscitation an increase in the volume of distribution was noted for cefazolin and gentamicin. Drug half-life was noted to be increased after shock for cefazolin by both resuscitation methods and for gentamicin after shock by saline resuscitation. Although alterations of pharmacokinetic parameters were noted, mean concentrations of gentamicin and cefazolin in serum were similar for pre- and postshock phases.\r"

Eleven adult subjects with normal renal function randomly received 500 mg every 6 h (five doses) and, later, 1,000 mg every 12 h (three doses). Each dose was infused over 1 h, and regimens were separated by 1 week. Compared with the two-compartment fit, a three-compartment fit significantly reduced the residual weighted sums of squares. Accumulation occurred for both regimens after repeated dosing and was independent of dose. At steady state, concentrations in serum at 1 h showed little variation for the 1,000- or the 500-mg dose regimen (33.7 +/- 3.8 versus 22.6 +/- 3.2 micrograms/ml); trough concentrations were 7.9 +/- 1.7 versus 11.2 +/- 2.2 micrograms/ml, respectively. With the 1,000-mg dose, the terminal half-life was 7.7 +/- 1.8 h, steady-state area under the curve for the dose interval was 227 +/- 28.3 micrograms X h/ml, and total body clearance was 86.1 +/- 8.9 ml/min per 1.73 m2. The red-man syndrome occurred in 9 of 11 volunteers who received 1,000-mg doses and in none of those who received 500-mg doses. We concluded that vancomycin disposition in healthy adults with normal renal function is best described by a three-compartment model, there is relatively little variation in vancomycin disposition in normal volunteers, significant accumulation occurs with multiple dosing, it is inappropriate to use the same therapeutic window for both regimens, and the pharmacokinetics of vancomycin justify a 12-h dose interval.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The distribution of nucleotide sequences related to ereA, ereB, and ermAM was studied by colony hybridization in 112 strains of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae that are highly resistant to erythromycin. The ereA and ereB genes encoding erythromycin esterases type I and II, respectively, were detected in strains inactivating the 14-membered macrolides erythromycin and oleandomycin. Because all 52 strains resisting these antibiotics by inactivation were detected by ereA (n = 23), ereB (n = 23), or both probes (n = 6), only two classes of genes accounted for this resistance phenotype. The ermAM gene encoding a streptococcal rRNA methylase was detected in 21 strains of Escherichia coli and two strains of Klebsiella spp. Determination of the MICs of macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin (MLS) antibiotics demonstrated a correlation between hybridization with ermAM and the so-called MLS resistance phenotype. The presence of 11 strains coresistant to MLS antibiotics that did not hybridize to the ermAM probe suggests that, as in gram-positive organisms, MLS resistance in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae involves more than one class of rRNA methylase. Numerous strains (n = 18) were found to produce both an erythromycin esterase type II and an rRNA methylase. Physical linkage between ereB and ermAM may be responsible for the codissemination of the genes. Despite their exogenous origin, ereB and ermAM are already disseminated in various genera of the Enterobacteriaceae.\r"

  ".U": "87211905\r", 
  ".W": "beta-Lactam antibiotics do not accumulate in phagocytes, probably because of their acidic character. We therefore synthesized a basic derivative of penicillin G, namely, 14C-labeled N-(3-dimethylamino-propyl)benzylpenicillinamide (ABP), and studied its uptake and subcellular localization in J774 macrophages compared with that of 14C-labeled penicillin G. Whereas the intracellular concentration (Ci) of penicillin G remained lower than its extracellular concentration (Ce), ABP reached a Ci/Ce ratio of 4 to 5. Moreover, approximately 50% of intracellular ABP was found associated with lysosomes after isopycnic centrifugation of cell homogenates in isoosmotic Percoll or hyperosmotic sucrose gradients. The behavior of ABP was thus partly consistent with the model of de Duve et al. (C. de Duve, T. de Barsy, B. Poole, A. Trovet, P. Tulkens, and A. Van Hoof, Biochem. Pharmacol. 23:2495-2531, 1974), in which they described the intralysosomal accumulation of weak organic bases in lysosomes. Although ABP is microbiologically inactive, our results show that beta-lactam antibiotics can be driven into cells by appropriate modification. Further efforts therefore may be warranted in the design of active compounds or prodrugs that may prove useful in the chemotherapy of intracellular infections.\r"

  ".U": "87211907\r", 
  ".W": "Intercalation of amphotericin B into liposomes at a 10 mol% drug/lipid ratio decreased its cytotoxicity by 3- to 90-fold in cultured murine cells and reduced its lethality by 2- to 8-fold in a median lethal dose (LD50) test in mice when compared with the commercial deoxycholate-solubilized drug (LD50 = 2.3 mg/kg). The cytotoxicity and lethality of the liposomal preparations were a function of their lipid composition and diameter. There was no correlation between the reduction of toxicity in the tissue culture assay and the reduction of lethality in the LD50 test. The rank order of reduction of lethality was sterol-containing liposomes greater than solid liposomes greater than fluid liposomes. In general, small sterol-containing vesicles were less lethal than large vesicles of the same composition. Intercalation of amphotericin B in sterol or solid liposomes increased not only the LD50 but also the time to death. The organ distribution of amphotericin B 24 h after intravenous administration was similar whether the drug was given as the commercial deoxycholate preparation or in liposomes. Finally, there were no differences among any of the formulations in their fungicidal activity against Candida tropicalis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae in vitro. The lesser and slower lethality of the liposomal and detergent-solubilized drug suggests that the mechanism by which liposomes reduce the lethality of amphotericin B is by slowing its rate of transfer to a sensitive cellular target.\r"

The combination of penicillin-gentamicin was more effective in vitro than the combination of ciprofloxacin-gentamicin against the low or high inoculum of enterococci. Using two strains of enterococci, we studied the efficacy of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of enterococcal experimental endocarditis in rabbits. Ciprofloxacin used alone or combined with gentamicin was significantly less effective (P less than 0.01) than procaine penicillin alone or procaine penicillin combined with gentamicin for the treatment of enterococcal experimental endocarditis.

Within 24 h of the onset of diarrhea, 50 children received erythromycin ethylsuccinate (40 mg/kg per day) in four divided doses for 5 days. Campylobacter jejuni isolated from 31, Campylobacter coli isolated from 21, and Shigella spp. isolated from 21 of 100 children were the most commonly recognized pathogens; use of a sensitive, nonselective method substantially increased Campylobacter isolation. Treatment with erythromycin had no effect on the duration of diarrhea caused by Campylobacter spp., Shigella spp., or other agents; 37% of the treatment group and 35% of the control group had diarrhea for 1 week. Of 23 Campylobacter strains isolated from the treatment group before treatment, 15 (65%) were resistant (MIC, greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml) to erythromycin. Among orphanage-acquired strains, 53% of 43 C. jejuni strains and 91% of 23 C. coli strains were resistant to erythromycin compared with 11% of 114 C. jejuni strains and 46% of 35 C. coli strains that were community acquired. Erythromycin resistance is common among Campylobacter strains in Bangkok, especially in an institutional setting, which may account for the lack of efficacy of erythromycin for treatment of acute diarrheal illnesses.\r"

Modest changes in the fecal flora were noted in both drug groups, but the changes were of different types. In the case of cefixime, there was more of an impact on the indigenous flora, and in the case of cefaclor, there was more ingrowth of new flora. With cefixime, Enterobacteriaceae were usually decreased (the decrease in Escherichia coli count was statistically significant), as were counts of clostridia and sometimes Bifidobacterium spp.; the Bacteroides fragilis group was eliminated in one subject. Coincident with these decreases, four subjects had increases in counts of group D streptococci of 3 logs or more. There was new appearance of Clostridium difficile in four subjects and of Staphylococcus aureus in one; four new strains of Enterobacteriaceae appeared. With cefaclor, there was no decrease of E. coli counts; two subjects had elimination of Bifidobacterium spp. There was little change in counts of group D streptococci. On the other hand, there were 13 new strains of Enterobacteriaceae, two of S. aureus, and three of C. difficile.\r"

A mild increase in telangiectasia was noted on both actively treated and placebo-treated sides. The gel was locally well tolerated. Only two of 40 patients failed to complete the trial, both because of flares of rosacea (one at two days, and one at five weeks). No systemic symptoms were noted, and no consistent abnormalities were found in the results of laboratory studies (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis).

  ".W": "Oral hairy leukoplakia (HL) is a newly described lesion occurring principally on the lateral borders of the tongue in immunosuppressed homosexual men infected with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III). Clinically, HL appears as a slightly raised, poorly demarcated lesion with a corrugated or \"hairy\" surface. Histologically, the lesion is characterized by keratin projections on the surface (which often resemble hairs), parakeratosis, and acanthosis. In addition, large pale-staining cells with pyknotic nuclei are seen in the upper stratum malpighii, which appear similar to the koilocytes described in uterine condylomata. Candida organisms are frequently observed on the lesion surface. Little, if any, subepithelial inflammation is present. Human papillomavirus and Epstein-Barr virus have been identified in biopsy specimens from lesions of oral HL. The association of this lesion in patients with HTLV-III infection has been established. We saw a patient with HTLV-III infection and HL, in whom the immunochemical and ultrastructural findings revealed the presence of a mixed viral infection. Because oral HL may be of diagnostic value as an early indicator of HTLV-III infection, awareness of its characteristic clinical, histologic, immunochemical, and ultrastructural features is important.\r"

The patient had IgG-lambda paraproteinemia, without any evidence of multiple myeloma or immunoglobulin deposition in affected skin. Ultrastructural studies of pigmented lesional skin showed increased transfer of melanosomes to basal keratinocytes and dermal melanophages containing complex melanosomes. In addition, cytoplasmic, electron-opaque lipid droplets were seen in approximately every third keratinocyte or melanocyte, while only an occasional dermal cell contained lipid droplets. The hyperpigmentation appeared to be directly related to the scleredema, while the lipid deposition in skin was a likely consequence of the hyperlipoproteinemia. The findings further support the contention that paraproteinemia and hyperpigmentation may, in some patients, be associated features of scleredema adultorum.\r"

The eruption was different in appearance from our previously reported keratoderma blennorrhagica in AIDS-associated psoriasis. None of the other 735 patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex not treated with soluble glucan developed a similar keratoderma. The correlation between receiving glucan and the hyperkeratosis is highly significant. Since glucan is a naturally occurring component of the cell walls of yeast, fungus, and some bacterial organisms, recognition of its ability to induce such a striking reaction pattern may be of general significance and interest, although the reaction itself may be limited to patients with AIDS.\r"

Complete clinical regression of disease was observed at ten of 12 recombinant interferon alfa-2b sites compared with one of 12 placebo-treated sites four weeks after treatment with injections was stopped. Subsequently, in an open-labeled study, five of these patients were treated intramuscularly with 5 X 10(6) U of recombinant interferon alfa-2b three times weekly for four weeks and two patients were treated with a second, more extended course of therapy lasting 12 to 16 weeks. Three of the five patients treated systemically showed some improvement overall, but the responses were judged not to be clinically significant. The differential response observed from intralesional and intramuscular injections may be related to differences in concentration of recombinant interferon alfa-2b achieved in lesional skin by the two methods of administration.\r"

These two patients as well as the 26 previously described exhibited a typical hyperkeratotic eruption, which should not be confused with ichthyosis. The characteristic features are diffuse hyperkeratosis, keratotic plaques, reticulated hyperkeratosis on the face, peribuccal grooves, and heavy-grain leatherlike keratoderma. The occurrence of multiple squamous cell carcinomas underlines the seriousness of this congenital ectodermal defect. Etretinate can relieve the lesions without actually improving the chances of survival.\r"

We studied a boy with TA in whom a papular rash of the trunk preceded the onset of vascular symptoms by many years. Histologically, the lesions were superficial and consisted of middermal noncaseating tuberculoid granulomas, which progressed to atrophy and anetoderma because of elastic network disruption. Granulomas were also found in synovial tissue but not in a temporal artery biopsy specimen, which showed only intimal hyperplasia. Our observations suggest that vascular and skin lesions with elastic tissue may both result from a common granulomatous hypersensitivity process.\r"

When four major causes of death were deleted analytically in both study and control areas, malignant neoplasms contributed the most in recent years to potential gains in life expectancy for both sexes. For the duration of their working ages, however, accidents were the leading contributor for males, followed by malignant neoplasms, heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease. The relative contribution of these causes of death to gain in life expectancy in the study area population is discussed in the context of elevated MeHg exposure.\r"

  ".W": "We studied 30 patients 38-75 yr of age who had ischemic heart disease to assess the effect of acute elevation of carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) concentration. Patients were nonsmokers with ischemia defined by exercise-induced ST depression (ST decreases)--25/30, angina--23/30, or abnormal ejection fraction (EF) response--18/30. After an initial familiarization and exercise session patients were exposed to air (carboxyhemoglobin [COHb] = 1.5 +/- 0.05%) and to carbon monoxide (CO) (100 ppm-COHb-average = 3.8 +/- 0.1%) on successive days in a double blind, randomized fashion. There was no significant difference in time to onset of angina (air = 312 sec, CO = 306 sec), maximal exercise time (air = 711 sec, CO = 702 sec), maximal ST decreases (1.5 mm for both), or time to significant ST decreases (air = 474 sec, CO = 475 sec). Double product at ST decreases and maximal double products were similar for both conditions. Resting ejection fraction was slightly but nonsignificantly higher after CO exposure (air = 53.9%, CO = 55.2%). Maximal ejection fraction was similar for both conditions (air = 57.4%, CO = 57.1%). Change in ejection fraction was slightly lower for CO exposure (air = 3.5%, CO = 2%), p = .049. In conclusion, there is no clinically significant effect of 3.8% COHb (representing a 2.2% increase from resting values) on the cardiovascular system in this study.\r"

Blood lead, urinary lead, semen lead, and zinc protoporphyrin concentrations were markedly elevated (p less than .001) in battery workers. Battery workers had a significantly shifted (p less than .025) frequency distribution of sperm count (median count, 45 vs. 73 X 10(6) cells/cc, respectively). There were no significant differences between the two groups in mean follicle-stimulating hormone, testosterone, prolactin, luteinizing hormone, or total neutral 17-ketosteroid levels. Potential confounding factors (alcohol, cigarette, and coffee consumption, frequency of intercourse, and days of abstinence prior to semen donation) were not significantly different between the two groups. These results suggest a direct toxic effect of increased lead absorption on sperm production or transport in man.\r"

By successive exclusion of parts of the original population of printing industry workers with excess risks of lung and cervical cancer it was possible to consider similarities and differences between subgroups. Risk estimates from three different standardization methods agreed well for populations with more than 50 cases. Regional adjustment helped arrive at interpretable risk estimates. The excess risk of cervical cancer disappeared when gainfully employed persons and blue-collar workers were used for reference. After the exclusion procedure there was an excess risk of lung cancer among typographers and lithographers in printing enterprises, especially in some birth-cohorts, due possibly to working exposure environment.\r"

The mean of the BPbL in the traffic controllers was found to be 68.28 +/- 13.22 micrograms/dl. This is a very high level compared to an acceptable level of 30.00 micrograms/dl. All neurobehavioral symptoms demonstrated in the traffic controllers could be attributed to a high level of lead exposure.\r"

Still other types of fibroblastic tumefactions might have been included. Oncogenic factors that may have been operative in the causation of the lesions presented include: genetic factors, sex-linked factors, hormonal factors, numerous growth factors, and certain viruses, especially retroviruses. Certain fibromatoses in children are commonly self-limited and need only be monitored carefully as the process regresses. Aggressive fibromatosis, on the other hand, can prove fatal if the lesion is not completely resected with a wide margin and, occasionally, the process may become frankly malignant, with metastases. The standard triad of excisional surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy has been used to treat frankly malignant fibrous tumors with variable results.\r"

MRI was observed to have greater accuracy than CT to preoperatively predict resectability (96.2% vs. 75.5%, respectively, p = 0.0034) following three-dimensional, multiplanar evaluation. Further, MRI was judged to have superior sensitivity to CT (95.6% vs. 73.3%, respectively, p = 0.006) and equivalent specificity (100% vs. 87.5%, respectively, p = 0.125). MRI represents a sophisticated diagnostic imaging technique to differentiate normal tissue from soft tissue sarcomas with superior contrast resolution in multiplanar imaging. MRI is considered to be the imaging modality of choice for these tumors with the advantage of not exposing the patient to ionizing irradiation or intravenous contrast agents to delineate contiguous structures.\r"

  ".W": "Pelvic recurrence is an ominous event after curative resection of rectal cancer and is rarely amenable to re-resection by conventional methods. A method to permit a composite resection of these using the abdominal sacral approach has been described previously. This report updates that experience with resection of pelvic recurrence of rectal cancer in 28 patients. Of these, 24 were done with curative intent, and four were done for palliation (mainly for infected or fungating tumor). All patients had extensive preoperative evaluation by clinical and radiologic tests, and most patients had a long free interval period of approximately 18 months, after their primary resection. Although 47 patients had exploratory surgery, only 29 had local disease amenable to resection and four had palliative resections. About half the patients had had an abdominoperineal resection, half had had an anterior resection, and one third had had previous efforts to resect the recurrence. All but one patient had been irradiated with 3000-11,000 cGy. All but two patients (of the 24 curative efforts) required a formal abdominosacral resection (through S1-2 in 12, S2-3 in 9, and S4-5 in 1). Over half the patients also required a bladder resection. There were three operative deaths (12%); one patient had a cardiac death immediately after operation and two were septic deaths at 35 and 60 days. The survivors generally had relief of sacral root pain and good motor function; most of those previously employed could return to work. The actuarial 5-year survival rate is 25% and median survival is 36 months. Long-term survival over 48 months was recorded in five of 21 surgical survivors (23.8%). Survival in a historic comparative group of 30 patients treated for local recurrence only (mainly by radiation) was 15 months median, and at 5 years the survival rate was 3% (p less than 0.001). In conclusion, selected patients with pelvic recurrence of rectal cancer may be retrieved by and returned to functional life with the composite abdominosacral resection.\r"

The overall drug-free remission rate was 63%, although three additional patients are likely to achieve drug-free remission in the near future, with the total drug-free remission rate then being 74%. Of the remaining patients, all but three improved and require decreased medication, for an improvement rate of approximately 90%. One patient who has not improved had an invasive malignant thymoma. Drug-free remission was achieved in 46% of the male patients and in 82% of the female patients despite that the mean duration of disease was greater than 3.5 years. There was one serious complication, that of sterile sternal dehiscence. There was no mortality. The results suggest that an aggressive, radical surgical approach to myasthenia gravis, even in a group of patients considered somewhat less favorable because of a relatively long duration of disease, can result in a high percentage of drug-free remissions. Radical surgery for myasthenia gravis appears to be the treatment of choice, with medical therapy being reserved for those patients who are not likely to survive operation.\r"

In the other 38% of patients, the medial pectoral nerve exits around the lateral aspect of the pectoralis minor muscle. The lateral pectoral nerve courses on the undersurface of the pectoralis major muscle, innervating the proximal one third or more of the muscle. Consequently, when the pectoralis minor muscle is removed in a modified radical mastectomy, or dissection between the two muscles is performed, there is partial deinnervation of the pectoralis major muscle with partial atrophy and a decrease in size. Further, if the lateral pectoral nerve also is injured or removed, it can result in total deinnervation of the pectoralis major muscle with more severe atrophy and fibrosis of the muscle. In cosmetic augmentations, when the breast implant is placed behind the pectoralis major muscle, that muscle is partially deinnervated. In this clinical situation, this is believed to be advantageous because it allows the breast to project better. This paper details the anatomy of the pectoral nerves and discusses the clinical implications of surgery in this region as it relates to the size and function of the pectoral muscles.\r"

There was one lower abdominal hernia (0.3%) and two small defects in the upper anterior rectus sheath (0.8%). Lower abdominal wall laxity occurred in two patients (0.8%), one requiring repair. As expected, there was some loss of abdominal wall strength after reconstruction but this did not affect sports or work performance in over 90% of patients. Ninety-eight per cent of respondents (272 or 278) judged the operation worth their time and effort. This major operative procedure is indicated only in healthy patients.\r"

Eleven biopsies showing these characteristics were performed on insulin-dependent patients who had diabetes mellitus from childhood. Every patient had some major complication of diabetes mellitus, usually diabetic retinopathy. In every instance the mastopathy continued to manifest itself as a part of the healing process. The probability is that this is an evidence in the breast of collagen cross-linking changes seen in patients with diabetes mellitus.

  ".U": "87212191\r", 
  ".W": "From 1971-1986, 24 patients were diagnosed as having Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) and 22 patients had laparotomy. Of this group, gross tumor was identified in 15 of 22 patients. Ten of 15 patients had resection of their gastrinomas with the specific aim of curing the disease. This group had responded favorably to either cimetidine or ranitidine before operation. Preoperative transhepatic portal venous sampling (PVS) with gastrin determinations was performed in six patients; three patients had this procedure twice. The tumor was correctly localized by PVS in five of six patients. In four of six patients, the tumor was easily found at surgery. In two of six patients (33%) PVS was vital to intraoperative decisions. Criteria for biochemical cure are normal periodic fasting gastrin and secretin infusion tests. Of the 10 patients who had resection for potential cure, two patients failed within 48 hours of surgery on the basis of an elevated fasting serum gastrin level in one patient and a positive secretin infusion test in the other patient. Eight patients were considered cured with follow-up from 6 months through 15 years. Of the eight cured patients, the tumors were located as follows: four were extraintestinal and extrapancreatic, four were in the duodenal wall, one patient had a tumor located in the uncinate process of the pancreas, and one tumor was located in a lymph node along the lesser curve of the stomach. Two patients had mobilization of the pancreas and duodenum for a \"blind\" pancreatoduodenectomy based on preoperative PVS (2 procedures each patient). In one patient a 3-mm gastrinoma was enucleated from the posterior uncinate process. The second patient had pancreatoduodenectomy with findings of two duodenal wall gastrinomas. Both patients remained cured of ZES beyond 2 years. It is concluded that PVS does indeed locate some tumors before operation, even those not easily found at surgery. ZES can be cured by an aggressive approach combining preoperative tumor localization and tumor resection. Of the eight patients biochemically and perhaps biologically cured, follow-up was greater than four years in five patients, greater than two years in two patients, and beyond six months in one patient.\r"

  ".W": "Adenocarcinoma involving the distal esophagus usually is far advanced when the patient is first seen. Adenocarcinoma differs from squamous carcinoma of the esophagus since it is relatively unresponsive to radiation therapy or chemotherapy. Adenocarcinoma of the esophagus resembles gastric cancer in its tendency to form a bulky and locally invasive tumor with early regional lymph node metastases. It differs from gastric cancer in its tendency to spread proximally in the esophagus and in the relatively infrequent early involvement of the liver by metastases. From 1979-1986, 37 patients had resection for adenocarcinoma involving the distal esophagus. Thirty-three patients were diagnosed with American Joint Committee for Cancer Stage III or IV adenocarcinoma at the time of operation. Transhiatal esophagectomy in continuity with a proximal gastrectomy was done in 27 patients. Reconstruction was accomplished by cervical esophagogastrostomy using pedicled distal stomach. There were three postoperative deaths (30-day mortality rate: 8%). Anastomotic leak occurred in nine patients and caused significant morbidity in four patients. Eleven patients required dilation of the cervical anastomosis after operation for up to 6 months. Mediastinal recurrence affected three patients treated by transhiatal esophagectomy. The survival rate (Kaplan-Meier) was 44% at 1 year and 31% at 2 years. Resection of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus can be accomplished in most patients with acceptable risks of morbidity and mortality. Resection restores ability to swallow saliva and to consume a normal diet, and is associated with an appreciable improvement in the quality of life.\r"

  ".W": "Since January 1984, 74 patients (61 men, 13 women; age range: 43-76 years) with carcinoma of the esophagus were evaluated. Fifty-two patients had squamous cell carcinoma and 22 patients had adenocarcinoma. Sixty-three patients had preoperative chemotherapy and radiation that consisted of cis-platinum and VP-16 for squamous cell carcinoma and cis-platinum 5-FU for adenocarcinoma combined with 4500-6000 rads. Thirty-four patients were staged inoperable at the completion of the 4-month treatment regimen. Eleven patients had surgery alone because they refused or were not candidates for the preoperative regimen. Twenty-nine patients completed the combined modality regimen and have had esophagogastrostomy. All patients receiving chemotherapy and radiation demonstrated improved swallowing and a dramatic reduction of tumor mass early in the course of therapy and have been able to maintain oral nutrition without other support in the posttreatment period. Of the 34 patients who had chemotherapy and radiation therapy as palliation, 18 are currently living. One patient died secondary to complications of chemotherapy, another patient died at 9 months of myocardial infarction. The remaining patients died secondary to their disease. Of the 29 patients who had radiation therapy and chemotherapy plus esophagogastrostomy, 25 are alive. There were no operative deaths. One patient died at 9 months of stroke. Three other patients had recurrence and died 1 year after surgery. Of the 11 patients who had surgery alone, two have died of the disease. Of the 29 patients who completed the integrated therapy, 10 had no evidence of residual tumor in the specimen, and in an additional five patients only microscopic foci were evident. These early results are an encouragement to continue the multidiscipline approach to carcinoma of the esophagus in the hope that the quality of life and disease-free interval, as well as ultimate survival, will be enhanced.\r"

  ".W": "Right ventricular (RV) failure is commonly treated with intravascular volume expansion to increase the RV-left atrial pressure gradient and improve left-sided filling. As RV pressure rises, chamber distention occurs and wall tension increases. These studies were designed to determine if increased wall tension might impede RV myocardial blood flow in the normal canine right ventricle and thus contribute to RV failure. Hemodynamic data, the septal-RV free wall dimension, and RV myocardial blood flow were obtained at low and high levels of preload and in both the autoregulated and vasodilated (adenosine, 2 mg per kilogram of body weight per minute) states. Elevated filling pressure decreased RV myocardial blood flow in both the autoregulated (0.85 +/- 0.18 to 0.67 +/- 0.15 ml/min/gm; p less than .05) and vasodilated (2.25 +/- 0.50 to 0.85 +/- 0.25 ml/min/gm; p less than .05) states but did not change the transmural distribution of blood flow to the right ventricle. Vasodilator reserve was markedly impaired in the high-preload state. These observations suggest that preload is an important determinant of RV myocardial blood flow. Volume loading to treat RV dysfunction may be limited by impairment of RV myocardial blood flow.\r"

  ".U": "87212202\r", 
  ".W": "Our current approach to the management of neonates with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum is to perform a transarterial pulmonary valvotomy through a left anterolateral thoracotomy followed by a polytetrafluoroethylene shunt between the left subclavian artery and the pulmonary trunk at the site of the pulmonary arteriotomy. From October, 1983, to December, 1985, 7 consecutive neonates with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum were managed in this fashion. Mean age was 5.1 days (5 patients, less than 48 hours old), and mean weight was 3.3 kg (range, 2.5-4.3 kg). Right ventricular morphology was type I (tripartite) in 4 patients, type II (absent trabecular portion) in 2, and type III (absent trabecular and infundibular portions) in 1. The mean right ventricular to left ventricular peak systolic pressure ratio was 1.5. One patient who initially had valvotomy alone required a left subclavian-pulmonary trunk shunt the next day for hypoxemia. All other patients had a valvotomy and shunt during the same procedure. There were no operative or hospital deaths. Follow-up of 3.5 to 34 months (mean, 17.5 months) confirmed shunt patency in all patients. Three of 4 patients undergoing postoperative catheterization have shown good right ventricular growth; 2 have undergone successful repair at 10 and 23 months. There have been 3 late deaths at 3.5, 4, and 8 months. Two other patients are doing well and are awaiting postoperative catheterization. This procedure permits synchronous valvotomy and shunting without the need for cardiopulmonary bypass in these critically ill neonates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The sutureless intraluminal prosthesis was used in 22 patients with acute dissection of the ascending aorta (type A) between May, 1982, and September, 1985. The patients ranged from 26 to 77 years old (mean, 58 years). Diagnosis was established by aortogram in 18 patients and by two-dimensional echocardiogram in 4 patients. Additional procedures included resuspension of the aortic valve in 7 patients, single coronary artery bypass in 1 patient, and cesarean delivery of a term pregnancy in 1 patient. Nineteen patients survived operation and were discharged from the hospital (86% early survival). Three patients died, 2 of hemorrhage and myocardial failure in the operating room, and 1 of sepsis following a prolonged hospitalization. Early postoperative complications included one instance of renal failure, one perioperative myocardial infarction, and one cerebrovascular accident (CVA). There were no reoperations for bleeding. Follow-up was obtained on 17 patients (90%) and ranged from 10 to 50 months (mean, 30 months). Thirteen of the survivors are well, 11 have returned to work, 2 have had a CVA, and 1 has a descending thoracic aneurysm. We conclude that the intraluminal graft is a good option for repair of acute type A dissections because it reestablishes central aortic flow, obliterates the false channel entry site, minimizes operative blood loss, and permits expeditious repair with minimal trauma to friable tissues.\r"

We studied the efficacy of predonated autologous blood in decreasing homologous transfusion in two matched groups of 58 patients each. Group 1 received homologous blood perioperatively, and Group 2 was transfused with predonated autologous blood. An average of 1.97 units was predonated in Group 2 over 18 days. This resulted in a decline in whole blood hemoglobin concentration of 2.2 gm/dl. No complications resulted from phlebotomy in this ambulatory population consisting predominantly of patients with coronary artery disease. Transfusion of an average of 1.7 units of autologous blood in Group 2 reduced the volume of homologous transfusion by 46% compared with Group 1 (p less than .01). In Group 1, 38% of patients required no homologous transfusion compared with 64% in Group 2 (p less than .02). There were no complications related to autologous blood transfusion. Total transfusion requirement was related to the length of cardiopulmonary bypass. We conclude that autologous predonation is a simple, safe, and cost-effective method of reducing homologous transfusion and thereby decreasing the risk of transfusion-related reactions and infections.\r"

The occluder was inflated to produce moderate, severe, and critical LAD stenosis, and regional perfusion was measured by xenon-133 washout with the Silicon Avalanche Radiation Detector. BCP infusion produced a consistently higher aortic pressure, but CCP flow was better than BCP flow under all conditions, particularly without coronary collaterals (p less than .05). Regional myocardial perfusion of CCP is superior to BCP.\r"

Twenty-four animals (Group 1) received potassium cardioplegia, and 16 animals (Group 2) received potassium verapamil cardioplegia. Potassium or potassium verapamil cardioplegia, 10 ml per kilogram of body weight, was administered after application of the aortic cross-clamp and at 30-minute intervals during the 90-minute arrest. Myocardial temperature was maintained within a range of 8 degrees to 10 degrees C with topical ice saline solution, and electrical activity was monitored with specially designed plunge electrodes. Plunge electrode activity was recorded from the myocardium during arrest in 16 of the 24 animals in Group 1; no electrical activity was present in the animals in Group 2 (p less than .001). The addition of verapamil to potassium cardioplegia increased the tolerance of the myocardium to prolonged ischemia and resulted in less depletion of high-energy phosphate stores and better preservation of mitochondrial ultrastructure and left ventricular function. These data suggest that verapamil augments the preservation provided by potassium cardioplegia by initiating and maintaining a more complete electrical arrest.\r"

Reflux events that occur in the supine position may be significant because of their prolonged duration resulting from the absence of normal secondary peristalsis in the body of the esophagus.

Although current results, particularly those with neonates, suggest that arterial repair may displace the Mustard operation, it remains a milestone in the history of TGA.\r"

High-risk patients were identified if the electrocardiographic diagnoses included myocardial infarction, ischemia, left ventricular hypertrophy, left bundle-branch block, or paced rhythm. These 63 patients (29% of total) had significantly greater incidences of serious events, need for procedures, and death than low-risk patients whose initial electrocardiograms did not carry the above diagnoses. Patients with a low-risk initial electrocardiogram may not require the facilities of a coronary care unit and perhaps could be safely observed in an intermediate care area. However, many hospitals do not have an intermediate care facility available, and in those that do, daily costs may not be markedly different than for treatment in a coronary care unit. Whether these low-risk patients could be safely treated in general medicine beds, where potential cost savings would be much greater, is unknown.\r"

Its incidence as a significant cause of hirsutism or amenorrhea is controversial because it cannot be distinguished clinically from other causes. However, it is readily diagnosed by a marked increase in 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone levels after adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation. Seventy-seven randomly selected women with hirsutism or amenorrhea were tested, and eight women (10.4%) were found to have late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Plasma levels of other hormones were similar in patients with and without late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia and were of no benefit in making the diagnosis. It is concluded that the adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test should be more widely utilized in patients presenting with hirsutism or menstrual dysfunction.\r"

In this study, seven patients with primary EBV infections had peak bilirubin levels of 10.2 to 23.0 mg/dL (174 to 393 mumol/L) and, for the most part, presented initial diagnostic problems. Complications included the virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome and acute respiratory distress syndrome in one patient and transient renal failure in another. The laboratory data suggested that a combination of hemolysis and viral-induced cholestasis was responsible for the intense hyperbilirubinemia in at least five patients. Physicians should be aware that marked hyperbilirubinemia can occur with EBV-induced infectious mononucleosis and, thereby, obviate the need for costly diagnostic laboratory tests and, occasionally, invasive procedures.\r"

Iodine 123 uptake was increased, and a scan revealed an enlarged gland with homogeneous uptake. Repeated studies again revealed an increased T4 level and free T4 index and normal total and free T3 levels. A protirelin test showed a blunted thyrotropin response. Treatment with propylthiouracil was associated with disappearance of symptoms and normal T4 levels, but after 20 months of therapy, hyperthyroidism recurred and the patient was treated with iodine 131. This was an unusual case of T4 toxicosis because the patient was not elderly and was not exposed to iodine-containing compounds or drugs that impair T4-to-T3 conversion. There was no evidence of abnormal thyroid hormone transport or antibodies.\r"

We reviewed our experience with severe hyperkalemia (potassium levels greater than 5.9 mEq/L [greater than 5.9 mmol/L]) in adult inpatients during a one-year period, to evaluate the extent to which drugs could be implicated in this electrolyte disorder. Excluding hemolyzed samples, single unexplained values, and measurements obtained during cardiopulmonary bypass or resuscitation, drug therapy was a probable contributing factor in more than 60% of the hyperkalemic episodes; in 25%, drugs were temporally linked to the onset of the hyperkalemia. In declining order of frequency, the drugs associated with hyperkalemia were potassium chloride, captopril, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and potassium-sparing diuretics. In more than 80% of the drug-related hyperkalemic episodes, potassium regulation was compromised by underlying disease states. The most common was renal insufficiency, followed by diabetes mellitus and metabolic acidosis. This review underscores the dictum that caution should be exercised when drugs with hyperkalemic potential are used in patients with impaired potassium homeostasis.\r"

Forty-five patients exhibited some form of neurotoxic reaction that was severe enough in nine patients to require discontinuation of treatment or reduction in dosage of the drug. The most frequent neurotoxic findings were tremor (44 patients), peripheral neuropathy (ten patients), and ataxia (seven patients). Five patients developed unusual neurotoxic manifestations: brainstem dysfunction characterized by downbeat nystagmus, hemisensory loss and ataxia, severe dyskinesia, jaw tremor, and proximal myopathy. Neurophysiologic studies revealed varying degrees of predominantly demyelinating peripheral neuropathy. Neurotoxic symptoms improved after discontinuing treatment or decreasing the dosage of the drug. Age of the patient and total cumulative dose did not seem to be risk factors for development of neurotoxicity. These neurotoxic findings suggest that amiodarone-induced neurotoxic reactions are not only confined to the peripheral nervous system, but also that parts of the central nervous system (eg, basal ganglia, brain stem, or their connections) may also be involved.\r"

Four of five patients required surgical intervention for treatment. Two of five died; one death was directly attributable to S mitis infection. Eighteen strains were available for detailed bacteriologic study. Three strains had a minimum inhibitory concentration of greater than 0.1 micrograms/mL of penicillin and six other strains were tolerant to penicillin. This review suggests that S mitis can be an important pathogen in adults and may cause infections other than endocarditis.\r"

All patients fulfilled the American Rheumatology Association criteria for SLE. When appropriate, a renal biopsy was performed. Of the 30 patients studied, 12 had no abnormal tubular study results, whereas 18 patients had some form of defect in the handling of potassium, sodium, or hydrogen ions. Eight patients had distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) due to an isolated proton secretory defect. Five had dRTA of the gradient or acid back-leak type. Two had an unresponsive voltage-dependent form of dRTA; one had a responsive voltage-dependent form of dRTA. One individual had hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism and one had dRTA plus hypoaldosteronism. Clinically, patients with the abnormal tubular study results more often presented with nephritis or nephrotic sediment, peripheral edema, or anemia. Renal biopsies failed to demonstrate any difference in glomerular histologic findings and calculated activity, chronicity, or interstitial indexes. We conclude that SLE may be associated with a variety of tubular defects.\r"

Mean duration of the procedure was 234 minutes and mean volume of infused polyethylene glycol electrolyte lavage solution was 7.7 L.

Alcoholism and severe acute pancreatitis have been shown to cause left ventricular dysfunction. We studied 15 consecutive patients, hospitalized for the treatment of acute, alcohol-induced pancreatitis, and 28 control subjects by M-mode echocardiography to detect pericardial effusion and to assess left ventricular function. Seven patients (47%) with pancreatitis and three control subjects (11%) had pericardial effusion; the prevalence of pericardial effusion in patients with pancreatitis was significantly greater (Fisher's exact test) than in control subjects. There was no evidence of impairment of left ventricular function in the patients, all of whom had mild acute pancreatitis; the mean fractional systolic shortening of the left ventricle in patients was not significantly different from that of control subjects (38% +/- 8.5% vs 37% +/- 8.0%), and the mean velocity of left ventricular circumferential shortening in patients was significantly higher than in control subjects (1.58 +/- 0.34 circumferences per second vs 1.29 +/- 0.32 circumferences per second).

Stable cardiac or noncardiac patients who were not severely ill had very low deterioration and mortality, but unstable, severely ill patients with cardiac or noncardiac reasons for admission had high deterioration rates. If the goal is to admit patients at highest risk, the optimal strategy is to admit unstable, severely ill, and moribund patients in both the cardiac and noncardiac groups. By doing this, it is possible to decrease unit admission of patients likely to do well, increase the admission of patients likely to do poorly, while decreasing the number of patients admitted.\r"

With all three drugs, patients with lower weight received substantially higher doses with correlations of weight vs dose, based on milligrams per kilogram of body weight, ranging from -0.34 to -0.40. Because body weight declines with increasing age, lower-weight patients are also older and at greatest risk for drug toxicity. Patients weighing 50 kg or less (n = 155) received milligram-per-kilogram doses that were 31% to 46% higher than the group mean and 70% to 88% higher than patients weighing more than 90 kg. For all three study drugs, as patient weight declines, the mean milligram-per-kilogram dose rose sharply. There was no trend seen toward reducing doses for older patients. Low body weight, in addition to advanced age, is a major risk factor for overmedication. Physicians must recognize the need to reduce drug doses for their low-weight elderly patients.\r"

When transsphenoidal exploration of the sella turcica was unsuccessful and hypercortisolism persisted, the source of corticotropin was discovered using petrosal sinus and venal caval catheterization. A 1 X 1.5-cm carcinoid tumor of the lung was identified and removed, thereby correcting the hypercortisolism. The tumor was demonstrated by immunoperoxidase staining to contain corticotropin. Orally administered bromocriptine, with or without cyproheptadine therapy, may be useful in the palliative treatment of some patients with carcinoid or other ectopic corticotropin-producing tumors. We postulate that bromocriptine therapy acted directly on carcinoid tumor cells to directly inhibit corticotropin production by a dopaminergic mechanism.\r"

The risk, which was four times the control value, is consistent with other recent reports using similar, modern methods.

We have investigated this claim by a statistical analysis of the relationships between the number of neurons in nucleus locus ceruleus (nLC), cortical levels of neurotransmitters, number of cortical plaques and tangles, and age. We separated AD patients into two groups: AD-1, with a less severe loss of nLC neurons; and AD-2, with a greater loss. The AD-2 cases were associated with less choline acetyltransferase activity, smaller concentrations of somatostatin and norepinephrine, and more plaques and tangles in the cerebral cortex. Although the mean age at death was less and the duration of dementia was greater in AD-2 patients than in AD-1 patients, the differences in these age-related variables were not significant. Further evidence of heterogeneity came from discriminant function analyses based on nLC neuronal counts and age at death. These findings, suggesting two subtypes of AD, suggest heterogeneity.\r"

The patients with DAT showed significant behavioral and cognitive but not physiologic changes at a lower scopolamine dose (0.25 mg) than did the normal elderly controls. Cognitive tests of new learning and semantic knowledge revealed significant impairments at the 0.25-mg scopolamine dose in the patients with DAT, while the responses of the control population were essentially unchanged. Behaviorally, mild euphoria, motor incoordination, and hostility occurred in the patients with DAT but not the controls at the 0.25-mg dose. These differences were unrelated to peripheral physiologic changes produced by the different scopolamine doses. These results indicate that central nervous system functions such as cognition and certain elements of behavior are more sensitive to temporary cholinergic blockade in patients with DAT than in normal age-matched controls. We review implications concerning the status of central cholinergic function in patients with DAT in light of neuropathologically demonstrated cholinergic system lesions in DAT.\r"

We analyzed 187 families of bipolar patients (149 probands with a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder and 38 with a diagnosis of schizoaffective, manic subtype). Using traditional genetic methods, the morbid risk of bipolar illness in relatives was found to be 5.7% in the relatives of bipolar probands as contrasted with 1.1% in the relatives of probands with major depression. These values compared closely with those obtained using survival analysis. Relatives of probands with early onset were found to have a greater risk than relatives of probands with late onset. The sex of the relative, the sex of the proband, or the subtype of the proband (bipolar I or schizoaffective bipolar) did not influence the risk in the relative. The age at onset was found to be accelerated with birth cohort, with individuals born in more recent cohorts having an earlier onset. Multifactorial analysis found significant heterogeneity for sex-specific sibling correlations (with the brother-sister correlation smaller than the same-sexed correlations), and path analysis estimated transmissibility of liability to be 71%. The mixed model, which allows for a single major locus with a multifactorial background, gave evidence for the presence of a major locus when controlling for the effects of birth cohort and age at onset. However, this evidence is tempered when comparing the mixed model with a more general transmission model.\r"

However, this can be achieved using recently developed methods of multivariate genetic analysis. Examining self-report symptoms in a clinically unselected twin sample (3798 pairs), traditional factor analysis indicates that symptoms of depression and anxiety tend to form separate symptom clusters. Multivariate genetic analysis shows that genes act largely in a nonspecific way to influence the overall level of psychiatric symptoms. No evidence could be found for genes that specifically affect symptoms of depression without also strongly influencing symptoms of anxiety. By contrast, the environment seems to have specific effects, ie, certain features of the environment strongly influence symptoms of anxiety while having little impact on symptoms of depression. These results, which are replicated across sexes, suggest that the separable anxiety and depression symptom clusters in the general population are largely the result of environmental factors.\r"

Six hundred sixteen of these probands were entered into a family study, and 3423 of their first-degree relatives were evaluated. The probands were divided into five diagnostic groups: schizoaffective-bipolar (n = 37), schizoaffective-depressed (n = 18), bipolar I (n = 151), bipolar II (n = 76), and unipolar (n = 330). The relatives of bipolar I probands had a higher rate of bipolar I illness than the relatives of unipolar probands, but the relatives of unipolar probands did not have a higher rate of unipolar illness than the relatives of bipolar I probands. The relatives of probands with schizoaffective disorder, depressed subtype, had a higher rate of schizophrenia than the relatives of schizoaffective-bipolar probands, suggesting that bipolar schizoaffective disorder may be closer to pure affective disorder while schizoaffective depression may be closer to schizophrenia. An increase in bipolar II illness was also observed in the relatives of bipolar II probands. Overall, these data support the widely accepted distinction between bipolar and unipolar affective disorders.\r"

The aims were to evaluate the relationship between additional DSM-III diagnoses in alcoholics and outcome at follow-up, assess the relative prognostic power of different ways of measuring psychopathology by comparing categorical DSM-III diagnoses and a global symptom severity measure, and assess whether ratings of psychopathology add to the prognostic power of an alcohol-dependence measure. While coexistent psychiatric diagnoses generally predicted poorer treatment outcome, there were significant interactions in the relationship between diagnoses and treatment outcome for men and women. For men, having an additional diagnosis of major depression, antisocial personality, or drug abuse was associated with poorer outcome. For women, having major depression was associated with a better outcome in drinking-related measures, while antisocial personality and drug abuse were associated with poorer prognosis. The value of determining psychiatric diagnosis was supported by covariance analyses that suggested that prognostic significance of specific disorders was not accounted for by general psychopathology or general dependence dimensions.\r"

The ROC analysis offers a comprehensive means for comparing different tests or different scoring procedures for one test. As a demonstration we used the ROC analysis to evaluate three types of scoring rules for one psychiatric test, the Health Opinion Survey. The demonstration indicated that ROC analysis can profitably take a place among the standard methods for test evaluation in psychiatric research. In addition, ROC analysis can assist clinicians in selecting appropriate test procedures for particular patient populations.\r"

Three dimensions of personality are defined in terms of the basic stimulus-response characteristics of novelty seeking, harm avoidance, and reward dependence. The possible underlying genetic and neuroanatomical bases of observed variation in these dimensions are reviewed and considered in relation to adaptive responses to environmental challenge. The functional interaction of these dimensions leads to integrated patterns of differential response to novelty, punishment, and reward. The possible tridimensional combinations of extreme (high or low) variants on these basic stimulus-response characteristics correspond closely to traditional descriptions of personality disorders. This reconciles dimensional and categorical approaches to personality description. It also implies that the underlying structure of normal adaptive traits is the same as that of maladaptive personality traits, except for schizotypal and paranoid disorders.\r"

The cases selected were from the cytology registry of the University of California, San Francisco; all cases necessarily had histologic follow-up. By using receiver operating characteristics analysis, we were able to show that training and experience significantly influenced the interpretation of breast FNAB specimens. The two experts operated at a higher level of sensitivity and specificity than did three nonexperts. This study shows that training and experience are important in the interpretation of breast FNAB specimens. It also demonstrates the utility of receiver operating characteristics analysis in anatomic pathology.\r"

  ".W": "The performance characteristics and the value of data provided by the H*1 Automated Blood Cell Analyzer in the diagnosis of infectious disease are assessed. Data produced by the machine are precise over a wide range of complete blood cell counts and differential white blood cell (WBC) parameters. It is capable of accurately quantifying WBCs greater than 4000/mm3 (4 X 10(9)/L); red blood cells (RBCs), greater than 2.5 X 10(6)/mm3 (2.5 X 10(12)/L); and platelets greater than 1 X 10(3)/mm3 (1 X 10(9)/L). There is good agreement between the neutrophils and lymphocytes quantified by the standard microscopic count and the automated system; however, cells that are generally present in low incidence, namely, monocytes, basophils, and eosinophils, are less well correlated. The microscopic band cell count provides the greatest test efficiency in the diagnosis of infection. None of the unique parameters generated by the H*1 differential analyzer proved to have neither a test efficiency nor a diagnostic index greater than that of the absolute WBC count in the diagnosis of infection. The \"left shift\" in the leukocyte differential count as detected by the H*1 relates poorly to the presence of band neutrophils in the specimen. It is concluded that the state-of-the-art automated leukocyte differential count can dramatically reduce workload, but offers no advantage over the traditional differential WBC count in the diagnosis of infectious disease. Its potential value in the diagnosis of other conditions, particularly hematologic diseases, and in the sequential monitoring of infections in individual patients were not addressed by the present study.\r"

A triphasic process evolved in the blood and bone marrow of 43 patients. Early, the leukocyte count was elevated due to numerous atypical lymphoid cells, and the marrow was hyperplastic. Later, severe pancytopenia developed, and the marrow showed extensive infiltration by lymphoid cells with cellular necrosis and histiocytic hemophagocytosis. Terminally, the marrow showed massive necrosis with severe cellular depletion and marked histiocytic hemophagocytosis. The median survival time of the patients was six weeks. Opportunistic infections and/or acute hemorrhage were the major causes of death. We conclude that bone marrow damage secondary to an Epstein-Barr virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome plays a major role in the death of patients with infectious mononucleosis.\r"

Samples were taken from each liver at inferior and superior sites in the midaxillary, anterior axillary, and midclavicular lines. Histologic examination showed diffuse metastatic carcinoma, cirrhosis, fibrosis, necrosis, steatosis, or congestion in 19 livers; two livers were normal. Density was determined by saline displacement of 0.5- to 1.0-g specimens. Nonheme iron concentration was measured at each site in samples of the size obtained by wedge (0.5 to 1.0 g) and percutaneous needle (0.005 to 0.010 g) biopsy using specially developed chemical assays. Density was uniform within each liver. Despite the inclusion of diseased tissues, the variation in density among the 21 livers was small (coefficient of variation, 1.25%). The mean (+/- 1 SD) hepatic density was 1.051 +/- 0.013 g/mL (range, 1.017 to 1.077 g/mL). Within each liver, the nonheme iron also was uniformly distributed among the six sites. Chemical measurements of nonheme iron concentration were not significantly different in samples of the size obtained by wedge or percutaneous liver biopsy. All the hepatic nonheme iron determinations were below the upper 95% confidence limit of concentrations in adult males (480 micrograms/g). In the absence of focal lesions, the uniformity in hepatic density and nonheme iron distribution supports the assumption of several clinical methods for measuring liver storage iron (wedge and needle biopsy, determination of hepatic magnetic susceptibility, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging) that one sample of liver tissue is representative of the whole organ.\r"

Subsequent chemotherapy with immunosuppressive drugs led to remission of the thrombocytopenia. In this patient, phagocytosis of platelets by Kupffer cells was demonstrated by electron microscopy, and the degree of platelet phagocytosis in the liver was greater than in the spleen.

Multiple function tests by a \"blinded\" special technician in another location revealed that overall both forms of therapy obtained worthwhile clinical and statistical improvement, which was maintained at nine-month recheck testing; but there was no statistically significant superiority of one therapy over the other under the very specific circumstances of the research design. Ease of delivering care and other socioeconomic considerations become important factors in choosing either or both of these methods.\r"

The stability and symmetry of thermographic patterns over time among both healthy subjects and subjects whose pain remained at the same intensity across several recordings were found to be both high and consistent. This was true only if sensitivity was limited to no greater than 0.5C per color band. Greater sensitivity resulted in the creation of inconsistent asymmetrical patterns among healthy and pained subjects. Thermograms were evaluated by the authors' statistical analysis of the heat patterns and by a ten-member panel of scientists. They found thermography an excellent tool for monitoring changes in pain related to variations in near surface blood flow, such as those occurring during a sympathetic block. It was excellent for relating changes in near surface blood flow to changes in phantom limb pain intensity. There was a good relationship between changes in pain intensity and changes in symmetry of heat patterns for most of the disorders examined. Thermography had mixed usefulness in differentiating pain-free from pained subjects reporting knee pain (test efficiency, 98%), leg pain, and back pain (efficiency, 56%). It consistently indicated painful areas among patients with spinal cord injury.\r"

A group of 14 women who participated in the program and an inactive group of 26 women were examined one year prior to the study, at its beginning and at its end. During the year preceding the exercise program the mean bone density in both groups decreased significantly. During the exercise period the bone density of the exercise group increased by 3.8% while that of the control group continued to decline. This study demonstrates that an appropriate physical activity regime may be effective as a prophylactic treatment for postmenopausal bone loss.\r"

Twenty-eight amputations were classified as long bone (6 above knee, 4 below knee, 4 above elbow, 14 below elbow); 28 small bone (9 hand or finger and 19 foot or toe); and 5 disarticulations. Significant new bone formation occurred at the amputation site in 23 (82%) of the 28 long bone cases, but none occurred in the small bone or disarticulation cases. This difference was significant at the 0.0001 level (chi square = 40.53, 2 df). Fourteen (78%) of upper and nine (90%) of lower extremity sites had significant new bone formation. The average time from amputation to diagnosis of new bone was 38 weeks, range from 5 to 110 weeks. Eight of these 23 patients required surgical revision of the stump and/or revision or reconstruction of their prosthesis. Clearly, the ability to predict new bone formation in electrical burn amputees has important clinical and economic applications.\r"

In this retrospective study, we investigated a method for prognosticating wrist extensor recovery and the underlying mechanisms for improvement in strength. Thirty-five quadriplegic patients at the C4, C5, and C6 neurologic levels, admitted over a four-year period, were examined at one week, two months, and eight months postinjury for biceps and wrist extensor strength. Initial biceps strength was compared to final wrist extensor strength. All 16 C5 patients whose initial biceps strength was grade 3 showed wrist extensor improvement to grade 3; only three of 16 C4 patients showed the same improvement. We concluded that initial biceps strength is a reliable indicator of wrist extensor recovery, and most, if not all, C5 neurologic patients will gain one full motor level. This improvement may be due to compensatory factors, such as overwork hypertrophy and peripheral sprouting of nerves within the muscle, rather than to recovery of a root level.\r"

  ".W": "This study sought to determine if weakness and poor endurance of quadriceps and hamstring muscles are present in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with minimally involved knees; determine if there is an abnormal hamstring/quadriceps ratio or abnormal torque curves in RA patients; and begin to evaluate the feasibility of isokinetic (IK) exercise in RA patients. Sixteen RA patients with minimally involved knees and 16 matched control subjects were tested bilaterally with a Cybex II dynamometer. Torque values in the RA group were significantly less (78% for isokinetic and 81% for isometric). The hamstring/quadriceps torque ratio was significantly higher in the RA patients than in the controls: 66.8% vs 61.7%. There was no significant difference in endurance between the two groups. In the RA patients the angle at which peak torque occurred shifted later in the range of motion (37.4 degrees) compared with the control subjects (28.7 degrees). Except for IK torque of hamstring muscles in the control group, there was no significant difference in the torque values between the right and left sides in RA patients or control subjects. The findings suggested that even in RA patients with minimally involved joints, muscle weakness was present; exercise of quadriceps should be emphasized since in RA patients quadriceps were weaker than hamstrings; and isokinetic testing is feasible in selected patients with RA.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of heel lifts on activity in gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles were analyzed by signal averaged EMG. The goal was to formulate a more rational approach to prescribing heel lifts for conditions such as tendoachilles bursitis and postoperative management of heel cord rupture. Thirteen men walked on a level floor and a treadmill with heel heights of zero, 1.9, 3.8, and 5.7 cm. Results showed that as heel height increased there was a significant decrease (p = 0.03) in gastrocnemius EMG activity and an increase (p = 0.04) in tibialis anterior EMG activity during level floor walking. Treadmill walking produced less remarkable decreases in gastrocnemius activity and increases in tibialis anterior activity, indicating differences between treadmill and level walking. We conclude that heel lifts of 1.9 to 5.7 cm for men decrease gastrocnemius muscle activity, thereby reducing tension in the Achilles tendon during normal level walking. Therefore, therapeutic use of heel lift is justified for men with tendoachilles bursitis, tenosynovitis of Achilles tendons, and postoperative management of ruptured Achilles tendons.\r"

Some centers offer no treatment, some provide customized body jackets or wheelchair inserts, and others recommend early surgical spinal fusion. Spinal orthoses are frequently prescribed at significant cost and inconvenience to the patient, with little evidence as to effectiveness in preventing scoliosis. This paper reports the preliminary findings of 22 patients involved in a study assessing the usefulness of a modified Jewett hyperextension brace. Seven brace wearers and 15 controls were entered into the study. The preliminary results indicate a mean curvature of 23.6 degrees (+/- 12.8 degrees) in the experimental group and 35.7 degrees (+/- 24.8 degrees) in the controls. Over an observation period ranging from two to seven years, the wearers have shown an average curve progression of 8.8 degrees/yr while the control group progressed at 11.2 degrees/yr. This difference is not considered statistically significant. We conclude that wearing the brace minimally slows scoliosis progression, but does not ultimately prevent a significant curve.\r"

Small bowel transit was normal in two patients, rapid in seven patients, and delayed in one patient. Most of the patients were asymptomatic, ate three meals a day, and gained weight after the operation. These findings show that after pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy, most patients consume a regular diet and achieve an excellent nutritional status. Gastric emptying is normal, not slowed. Small bowel transit is faster than normal but is without clinical sequelae.\r"

Finally, a substantial proportion (25%) of patients who had only partial invasion of the muscular layer also had lymphatic metastases. These results differ significantly from what has been previously reported and lead us to conclude that the commonly used criteria of size and histologic grade are inadequate criteria and do not allow confident selection of patients with lesions suitable for local treatment.\r"

Nine tumors were primary; ten were recurrent (five after an anterior resection and five after an abdominoperineal resection). Prior irradiation ranged from 3000 to 12,000 rad (30 to 120 Gy). Four patients had synchronous distant metastases; three died of disease (one with local recurrence), and the fourth patient has been living with disease (distant metastasis). Fifteen patients (four with B2 tumors and 11 with Astler-Coller C2 disease) had no extrapelvic disease. One patient died of postoperative complications; two others died free of disease. Three of the 15 patients died of disease (all with local recurrence), and one has been living with disease (local recurrence). Eight (53%) of 15 patients have been living free of disease 12+ to 53+ months.

The aim of this study is to review the long-term (up to 20 years) results of Nissen fundoplication in 350 patients and to evaluate the effect of major modifications in the technique of fundoplication in these patients. Three hundred fifty patients with symptomatic chronic reflux esophagitis have been treated with Nissen fundoplication in our institution since 1966. They were divided into four groups: patients who had a long, tight fundoplication; patients who had a short, floppy fundoplication; patients with crural approximation; and patients without crural approximation. The preoperative and postoperative findings of these patients were evaluated in each group. Group 1 had more immediate and long-term dysphagia compared with group 2. Also, \"gas bloat\" syndrome was more prevalent in group 1 than group 2. The location of Nissen fundoplication (chest or abdomen) or the addition of hiatal hernia repair did not change the outcome. In patients with intact Nissen fundoplications, their esophagitis healed, and their symptoms disappeared. The rate of recurrence of symptoms was 5%. Recurrence of symptoms was associated with disruption of the fundoplication, which usually happened within the first two years after operation.\r"

This could not be explained by selection bias, as risk factor prevalence was equally distributed between these two groups. We conclude that primary gastric resection, with or without vagotomy, is the procedure of choice for repair of perforated gastric ulcers. Only intraoperative hemodynamic instability should limit operative selection to a faster, less definitive procedure.\r"

The results of biliary tract operations performed on 1256 patients were carefully scrutinized for the presence of postoperative hyperamylasemia and pancreatitis persisting after 48 hours. Patients were evaluated in the context of the presence or absence of preoperative pancreatic dysfunction. Similarly, various operative risk factors were evaluated, including cholangiography, choledocholithiasis, common duct exploration, choledochoscopy, choledochoduodenostomy, and sphincteroplasty. Operative cholangiography did not induce postoperative pancreatitis. The incidence of postoperative pancreatitis following cholecystectomy was 0.6%, which was significantly greater than the incidence following common duct exploration (8.4%). Pancreatitis following biliary tract surgery seemed to be not directly related to the performance of choledochoscopy, sphincteroplasty, or choledochoduodenostomy, as it developed with similar frequency in patients undergoing common duct exploration alone. The timing of operative therapy in patients with biliary tract pancreatitis did not significantly alter the frequency with which pancreatitis persisted in the postoperative period. In 970 patients undergoing cholecystectomy, one patient who had preoperative pancreatitis died of postoperative pancreatitis. Of 286 patients undergoing common duct exploration, seven patients died with pancreatitis. In three of these patients there was no active preoperative pancreatitis, and in one of these patients pancreatitis was the cause of death. Four patients with preoperative pancreatitis eventually died of pancreatitis in the postoperative period. Pancreatitis is an important complication of biliary tract disease and operations, and all efforts should be extended to suppress its occurrence and development.\r"

Forty-eight major injuries were identified in 35 neck explorations. Five patients were identified with clinical and diagnostic findings that were considered normal preoperatively; however, at operation six major injuries were found in these patients.

We reviewed 849 cases of femorodistal bypass to determine the incidence of technical graft failure, as well as other causes of early graft occlusion. The efficacy of adjunctive intraoperative arteriography was assessed. Early graft failure occurred in 62 (7.3%) cases and was due to technical defects in nine (14.5%) cases. Embolization caused early failure in six (9.7%) cases, coagulation disorders caused occlusion in ten (16.1%) cases, and failure was due to inadequate runoff in seven (11.3%) cases. No identifiable cause of graft thrombosis was found in 30 (48%) cases, but thrombectomy and empiric anticoagulation therapy salvaged 25 of these grafts. Intraoperative arteriography was very specific (98%) and moderately sensitive (76%) for the detection of technical defects in this series. Technical defects appear not to be the most common cause of early infrainguinal bypass graft failure and were found in only 1% of all cases reviewed. Critical attention must be given to other causes, such as emboli, and particularly to disorders of the host coagulation system that may threaten the success of the procedure.\r"

There were 51 patients with stab wounds, 45 with gunshot wounds, and eight with blunt trauma. All penetrating wounds were near the heart. In seven patients the window disclosed cardiac damage with no clinical signs of tamponade or shock. Fifty-one patients had signs of tamponade; however, only 12 of them had a cardiac injury diagnosed by pericardial window. Nineteen patients had cardiac injuries. One examination had false-negative results and one study had false-positive results. Cardiac wounds repaired included the right ventricle (eight), left ventricle (three), right atrium (five), and cardiac vein or pericardial wounds (three). Complications were negligible and consisted of minor wound infections (two) and postpericardiotomy syndromes (two). The pericardial window provides a rapid and safe means of diagnosing cardiac injuries in patients with equivocal signs of heart injury while sparing the patient without a heart wound a major operation.\r"

All patients underwent a one-stage conversion of the jejunoileal bypass to a gastric bypass. Patients were classified according to postbypass weight, the need for nutritional support, the type and severity of complication, and the time interval between jejunoileal bypass and the onset of the complication and correction of the complication. There were no operative deaths; one patient died 18 months after surgery of cirrhosis. The complication rate was 34%; however, most complications were minor. Our experience with this procedure has shown it to be highly effective in correcting complications other than polyarthritis. When coupled with nutritional support, it is safe even in malnourished patients.\r"

  ".W": "There is no agreement regarding the proper management of patients with advanced carcinoma of the rectum. We performed a study to clarify whether palliative resection with or without primary anastomosis is worthwhile and safe. Among 679 patients managed for cancer of the rectum, 125 were considered incurable and underwent palliative procedures. High and low anterior resections were performed in nine and 57 cases, respectively, abdominoperineal resection in 26, Hartmann's procedure in three, simple diverting colostomy in 17, and transanal excision in 13. The overall postoperative mortality rate was 0.8%. Postoperative morbidity was 18% in abdominal operations and none in local excisions. Among patients treated by abdominal resections, only one required subsequent reoperation for colonic obstruction secondary to local recurrence. The median survival was 6.4 months for patients treated by diverting colostomy, 14.8 months for abdominally resected cases, and 14.7 months for transanal excisions. We conclude that palliative resection, often with primary anastomosis or local transanal excision, can be done safely in patients with incurable rectal cancer. We believe this approach improves the quality of the remaining life for these patients.\r"

The only significant finding that differed between the two types of diarrhea was the white blood cell count on the day of diagnosis. The nonspecific diarrhea was self-limited, requiring antimotility agents in 45% of the episodes. The C difficile diarrhea responded promptly to vancomycin hydrochloride, with resolution of symptoms in an average of 3.3 days.

Twelve patients had undergone previous pancreatic pseudocyst drainage; four of them also had pancreatic pseudocysts present at the time of LPJ. In addition, 22 patients had pseudocysts identified preoperatively and/or confirmed at operation. The overall incidence of pseudocyst was 39%. Twenty-six patients (group 1) underwent pancreaticojejunostomy combined with pseudocyst drainage. Sixty-one patients (group 2) underwent pancreaticojejunostomy only. Operative morbidity and mortality results (19% and 8%, respectively, in group 1; 18% and 2%, respectively, in group 2) were similar. Patient outcome was also similar in the two groups (81% and 84% of patients obtained pain relief in groups 1 and 2, respectively). There were no pseudocyst recurrences in either group. Thus, there is a high incidence (39%) of pancreatic pseudocyst in patients undergoing LPJ for chronic pancreatitis. Combined drainage of the pancreatic duct and pseudocyst is safe and effective.\r"

Satisfactory immediate relief was obtained in 97% and 61% were completely relieved of pain initially. There were no deaths, 10% wound complication rate, and one instance of Horner's syndrome. Postsympathectomy neuralgia occurred in close to 40%, lasted a little over a month on the average but did not persist beyond ten weeks. In extended follow-up, only one patient failed to sustain satisfactory relief (97% of those relieved, 94% of the total) and 84% continued to enjoy the same degree of relief as they had immediately preoperatively. This frequency, degree, and duration of benefit establishes causalgic pain as one of the best indications for surgical sympathectomy.\r"

Three patients had papillary carcinomas and two had follicular adenomas. The latency period between radiation exposure and the diagnosis of thyroid neoplasm ranged from eight to 16 years. This limited series provided strong support for the recommendation that children and young adults who are to receive high-dose radiation therapy to the head, neck, and mediastinum should receive suppressive doses of thyroxine prior to radiation therapy in order to suppress thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone) and then be maintained on a regimen of suppression permanently.\r"

There have been two recurrences in the breast from 110 breast cancers (44% had a clinical stage greater than T1, and 41% had axillary-node involvement) in 107 patients followed up for four to 52 months (25.8 +/- 13.3 months [mean +/- SD]).

Only four postoperative intra-abdominal abscesses occurred, in three patients. The mortality rate was zero. A comparison of this series with a similar group of 24 patients who underwent drainage showed the relative rate of abdominal abscess formation to be 1.8% (undrained) vs 12.5% (drained).

Response to mitogen was measured by incorporation of tritiated thymidine as a function of lymphocyte concentration, with a constant amount of phytochemagglutinin and a standard incubation period. A saturation curve was obtained, and lymphocyte response was measured as the concentration necessary for half-maximal incorporation of the radioactive label. No alteration of in vitro lymphocyte response was present in patients after elective abdominal or abdominal wall operations.

Of 139 patients with clinical stage I disease, 117 underwent ELND. Five- and ten-year survival rates were 55.7% and 48.9%, respectively. Multifactorial analysis demonstrated that anatomical location, level, pathologic stage, and ulceration were the best predictors of survival. Thickness did not emerge as a significant variable. Our findings do not support basing treatment decisions, eg, ELND in this group of patients, solely on the thickness of the primary tumor.

Fibrinolytic activator activity (FAA) was studied after intimectomy of 3-cm segments of carotid artery in dogs. Endarterectomized segments and contralateral control arteries were resected immediately following intimectomy (group 1) and after blood flow restoration of ten minutes, three hours, and 24 hours (groups 2, 3, and 4, respectively). Areas of fibrinolysis around punch biopsy specimens from each endarterectomy segment and from the control artery were measured. Fibrinolytic activator activity, the ratio of the areas in endartectomized segments to control arteries, was reduced in groups 1 through 3 (mean, 60.7%, 70.1%, and 79.7%, respectively) and was normal in group 4 (94.3%). We conclude that canine FAA is significantly depressed at the endarterectomy site initially but returns to normal at 24 hours. The source of FAA may be synthesis by subintimal structures or delivery by the circulation. During this period of increased thrombogenicity, use of antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy would be justified.\r"

The serum bilirubin concentration was significantly increased in the BDL group and returned to normal following internal and external drainage. Mortality in the sham group was 16.5% and increased to 83.3% following BDL, but it decreased significantly (25%) to near-normal values after preoperative internal drainage. However, after external drainage no significant reduction in mortality (63%) was found.

Mitral valve prolapse and arterial dissection accounted for 51% of infarcts, migrainous infarction was the likely cause in 15% of infarcts, and uncommon causes accounted for 34% of infarcts. Atherosclerosis played a role in only two patients. Two thirds of the women were taking oral contraceptives, which may have been the primary cause of stroke in one woman who had recurrent venous thromboses followed by thrombosis of the aortic arch. Three patients (7.3%) died of acute causes. During follow-up (mean, 46 months), the annual incidence of death (0.7%) and recurrent stroke (0.7%) was low. Eighty-one percent of the survivors could return to work. We conclude that cerebral angiography and echocardiography are indicated in all adults younger than 30 years of age. After the acute phase of stroke, prognosis is reasonable.\r"

Computed tomography demonstrated 41 lobar, 11 putaminal, four thalamic, four pontine, four intraventricular, two caudate, two midbrain, two cerebellar, one globus pallidum, and one corpus callosum hemorrhage. Forty-three patients, with either progressive neurologic deterioration, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), or saccular aneurysms underwent surgery. The overall in-hospital survival, including those patients treated medically, was 87.5%. A presumed cause for the ICH was found in 55 (76.4%) patients. The main causes were ruptured arteriovenous malformations (21), hypertension (11), ruptured saccular aneurysms (seven), and sympathomimetic drug abuse (five). Surgical explorations demonstrated a necrotizing angiitis in one patient and arteriovenous malformations in two patients who had negative arteriograms. Young patients with nontraumatic ICHs represent a heterogeneous group. A cause can be established in most patients. Arteriovenous malformations account for less than one third of the hemorrhages in young adults, and other causes should be sought.\r"

In the absence of clinical toxicity at monthly visits, the decision to maintain the current dose or raise it was made by a computer, which compared current headache score with that of the previous month. Both drugs were superior to placebo. Neither drug was superior to the other.

To develop information on the relative rarity or frequency of neurologic worsening with the initiation of penicillamine therapy, we conducted a retrospective survey of 25 additional patients with Wilson's disease who met the criteria of presenting with neurologic disease and having been treated with penicillamine. The replies indicate that, at least from the patient's viewpoint, this syndrome occurs frequently. We suggest that the cause of this distressing syndrome, and ways to mitigate or circumvent it, must be discovered.\r"

Apart from impairments in perceptual-motor functioning, generally mild deficiencies in intelligence and, specifically, in memory were displayed in the MS group. Attentional processes appeared uncompromised. Increasing fatigue during testing could not account for poor performance. The memory deficits could be attributed to poor initial learning, although there was also evidence suggesting that accelerated forgetting of what had been learned may appear with the progression of MS. Seven patients (17.5%), as compared with none of the controls, were classified by blind clinical judgement of test performance as definitely impaired.\r"

The results suggest that incontinence in patients with multiple sclerosis is often due to the interaction of several factors, including central lesions, lesions of the conus medullaris and, also, coincidental pelvic nerve lesions associated with childbirth. Thus, incontinence is especially a problem in women with this disease.\r"

After unilateral frontal arcuate ablation inducing unilateral neglect, the response time on this task increased most when the monkey responded with the hand contralateral to the lesion, but also increased when the monkey used the hand ipsilateral to the lesion. The side of stimulation had no effect on response time. Control (anterior superior temporal) lesions did not cause neglect and only affected response time slightly in one monkey (using the limb contralateral to the lesion). We conclude that response time is increased in animals with unilateral neglect and that the increase results from a defect in intention to act (motor neglect) rather than from sensory neglect.\r"

In agreement with previous findings using the probe procedure, the present results indicate greater task-specific RH activation in recovering aphasics and, to a lesser degree, dysarthric patients and greater LH activation in both nonaphasic, RH-damaged patients and normal control subjects. On the basis of these data, we suggest that increasing participation of the nondominant hemisphere may subserve restitution of language in adults sustaining LH lesions.\r"

  ".W": "The diagnosis of intramedullary spinal cord metastasis (ISM) is difficult, and treatment is usually ineffective. We review our own experience with ISM as well as the pertinent medical literature, and suggest a practical diagnostic and therapeutic approach. The problem of the diagnosis of ISM is essentially that of the differential diagnosis of a noncompressive myelopathy in a patient with systemic cancer. Most such patients prove to have ISM, meningeal carcinomatosis, radiation myelopathy, or paraneoplastic necrotizing myelopathy. Neurologic features of value in this differential diagnosis are pain, the tempo and mode of progression of symptoms, and tumor cells in the spinal fluid. Oncologic features of value are the location of the primary tumor, the past exposure to therapeutic radiation, cerebral metastases, and the extent of systemic metastatic disease. The myelogram in ISM is either normal or nonspecifically abnormal; therefore, the diagnosis must be made on clinical grounds. Although no single finding is diagnostic of ISM, a careful clinical analysis will lead to the correct diagnosis in most cases. Radiation therapy is effective treatment for ISM, but only if it is administered early, before paraplegia supervenes. Thus, the diagnosis should be made and treatment begun as soon as possible. Intramedullary spinal cord metastasis is often multifocal rather than solitary; therefore, whole-cord rather than local spinal radiation should be given, if possible. If local radiotherapy is chosen, the construction of the portal can be based on the myelogram or, in the event of a normal study, on the clinical localization of the tumor.\r"

Evidence has been presented that in this form of MG the neuromuscular transmission is impaired by antibodies that bind to endplate determinants other than the AChR. We describe three patients with clinical manifestations of A-AChR-negative MG in whom antibody directed to reticulin (A-Ret) was detected. Antibody directed to reticulin is usually associated with celiac disease; however, none of the patients had symptoms or signs of celiac disease. To our knowledge, the association of A-Ret with A-AChR-negative MG has not been reported before. We postulate that A-Ret might help to differentiate between A-AChR-negative MG and congenital myasthenia. Further studies are needed to determine whether A-Ret plays a pathogenic role in A-AChR-negative MG or should instead be considered as an epiphenomenon.\r"

A matched control group was also studied. When all EEGs were considered together without regard to their changes, no significant differences were found between the two groups, especially with respect to the high incidence (60%) of EEG abnormalities both ipsilateral and contralateral to the tumor. Exact localization of the BT by EEG (within one electrode) was found in 88% of patients. When changes in time were considered, the BT group more often showed increasing slow waves, increasing sharp-wave discharges, depression of normal rhythms, a change in type of sz, increase in frequency of szs, and a change in neurological signs and symptoms, especially motor. For single, double, or triple criteria, a change in clinical signs was the most discriminative, with a deteriorating EEG as the next best indication of a tumor. Patients with the latter signs should then be selected for a computed tomographic or magnetic resonance imaging scan, even if the scan was normal initially, rather than following the expensive policy that all patients at all ages with chronic szs should undergo these later tests.\r"

Five of six patients showed reversal of BAER changes to normal; the remaining patient returned to near normal. Normalization occurred six to 24 days after the VB TIA.

In eight patients who met clinical criteria for brain death, mean cerebral blood flow was 1.6 +/- 2.0 mL X 100 g X min. This value was within the range of error inherent in the method, and therefore represented absent flow. In a patient with persistent respiratory efforts, flow values compatible with absent flow were obtained in the supratentorial compartment, while mean flows as high as 24 mL X 100 g X min were measured in selected regions of interest in the infratentorial compartment, correlating with the clinical evidence of residual function of the brain stem. Xenon-enhanced computed tomography may be a useful test to confirm the absence of cerebral blood flow in patients being evaluated for brain death.\r"

We observed an autopsy-proved case of SNE in which the diagnosis was established by the distribution and evolution of lesions documented by serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A 21-year-old woman insidiously developed diplopia and gait disturbance, and subsequently deteriorated to a vegetative state over seven months. An initial MRI obtained one month after presentation showed increased signal intensity that surrounded the aqueduct of Sylvius and involved the tectum of the midbrain. Serial MRI scans showed these lesions to extend and symmetrically involve the tectum of the midbrain, caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra, while sparing the mammillary bodies and red nuclei. Despite treatment with 2 g of thiamine administered intravenously daily, she continued to deteriorate and died. Results of an autopsy established the diagnosis of SNE and confirmed the MRI-identified distribution of lesions. To our knowledge, this case is the first report of MRI findings in an adult with autopsy-proved SNE, suggesting that MRI can be valuable in the early diagnosis of this disease.\r"

  ".W": "A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, two-year multicenter study demonstrated that natural human fibroblast interferon (interferon beta) administered intrathecally (IT) is effective in reducing the exacerbations of exacerbating-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). The mean reduction in exacerbation rate of 34 patients with MS who received interferon beta administered IT was significantly greater during the study than that of 35 control patients who received placebo. The prestudy exacerbation rates were comparable for both patients who received interferon beta and control patients, but the exacerbation rate of patients receiving interferon beta at the end of the study was significantly lower than that of the control patients. Interferon beta was administered by nine or ten lumbar punctures for the first six months of the study, and observations were continued for two years. In 95% of the recipients, interferon beta therapy was well tolerated, and the side effects experienced were clearly acceptable for the benefits achieved. Low doses of indomethacin dramatically reduced the toxicity of interferon beta therapy and played an important role in successful double blinding. This study confirms a preliminary report on 20 patients that initially suggested that interferon beta administered IT was of benefit in patients with MS. The number of treatments was fewer and the dosage of interferon beta administered was less in the present study than in the preliminary one. It is possible that even fewer treatments with lower doses of interferon beta administered might provide a similar degree of prophylaxis against exacerbations.\r"

The most important feature concerning prognosis for these depressive episodes appears to be the relationship between the depressive episode and the underlying demyelinating disease.

  ".W": "IgG synthesis within the central nervous system is the expression of a local pathologic immune reaction. Its detection is of great importance in a large number of neurologic diseases, especially multiple sclerosis (MS). The results obtained from the study of 115 neurologic patients (52 patients with MS and 63 patients with other neurologic diseases) using three different mathematic formulas (Tourtellotte's formula, the index of Tibbling and coworkers, and Schuller and Sagar's formula) are presented and statistically analyzed. Despite their obvious differences, the results from these three formulas are in accordance in 76% of the patients observed. The clinical correlations of these formulas are discussed; none of them allows a specific diagnosis of MS. The formula of Schuller and Sagar seems the most sensitive, detecting local central nervous system IgG synthesis in 79% of patients with MS, compared with 54% of patients with MS utilizing the index of Tibbling and coworkers and 50% of patients with MS utilizing Tourtellotte's formula. No correlation was established between serum and cerebrospinal fluid albumin concentrations, nor between serum albumin and IgG levels in cerebrospinal fluid. Thus, no evidence exists to support the inclusion of variations in serum albumin levels in the calculation of intrathecal IgG synthesis. Furthermore, Schuller and Sagar's formula allows classification of neuroimmunologic diseases and the evaluation of antibody-specific activity (ASA) in locally produced IgG. The comparison of intrathecal IgG ASA with serum IgG ASA, which reflects local and general immunity, respectively, seems potentially important.\r"

The elimination of sugar phosphates was faster than in complete glycolytic blocks. Mild intracellular acidosis occurred during ischemic exercise. The energy state was slightly low at rest but not during exercise. Postexercise recovery was mildly slowed. These findings suggest that phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy can detect partial defects, as well as full glycolytic blocks, in muscle metabolism.\r"

In addition, patients with right-hemisphere injury also showed multimodal neglect for targets in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the brain lesion.

The majority (60.8%) of waking records were normal during or after episodes of TGA. Mild or moderate and nonfocal abnormalities were found in a minority. Genuine epileptiform activity was observed only among patients who had seizure disorders. Amnestic episodes attributable to seizures were more brief and more apt to be repeated than TGA and usually responded to anticonvulsant drugs.

In the present study, we found a significant elevation of both autoimmune and allergic disorders in the dyslexics only, but no elevation in mixed- or left-handedness in either group. Moreover, the frequency of immune disorders was not higher in the mixed- or left-handed subjects. There was also no elevation in the comparison disorders, which argues against an overreporting bias. The elevation of immune disorders did not vary with linkage status, arguing against a common cause for dyslexia and immune disorders. These findings are discussed in light of Geschwind's hypothesis of a testosterone-mediated association within families between left-handedness, immune disorders, and dyslexia.\r"

The Caribbean basin and sub-Saharan Africa are endemic for ATLL. A similar etiology has been invoked in a chronic spastic myelopathy occurring in areas of high ATLL endemicity in Japan. An HTLV-I viral antigen has been demonstrated in cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytes of a Japanese patient with myelopathy. Human T-lymphotropic virus type I antibodies have occurred in patients in Florida and Japan (areas of HTLV-I endemicity) who were diagnosed as having clinically definite multiple sclerosis (MS), but not in patients with MS in other parts of the world. Human T-lymphotropic virus type I, like some lentiviruses--visna and human immunodeficiency virus, in particular--may be both lymphotropic and neurotropic. Tropical spastic paraparesis, the Japanese myelopathy, and, perhaps, an MS-like neurologic syndrome, may represent clinical variants of the same disease, a retroviral myelopathy.\r"

Surgery was performed in 43 eyes; three eyes had an intraoperative complication that prevented a posterior chamber lens implantation. The mean preoperative intraocular pressure was 17.6 mm Hg with the patients receiving a mean of 1.9 medications. The mean intraocular pressure (16.2 mm Hg) and the number of medications (1.4) administered to the 43 eyes having the planned surgery were significantly decreased an average of 23.4 months following cataract surgery. Seventy-two percent of the eyes had a postoperative visual acuity of 20/40 or better. Operative complications were similar to those reported for the same type of cataract surgery in nonglaucomatous eyes. However, there seemed to be an increased incidence of postoperative cystoid maculopathy (11.6%) in these glaucomatous eyes compared with previous reports in the literature and with the incidence in nonglaucomatous eyes that we treated. Our study shows that extracapsular cataract extraction with a posterior chamber lens can be effective in restoring vision without compromising intraocular pressure control in eyes with preexisting open angle glaucoma.\r"

A fourth patient developed aqueous misdirection after posterior chamber lens implantation only (without trabeculectomy). This latter was cured by repeated pars plana vitrectomy, not requiring removal of the pseudophakos. In only one of the three eyes with the triple procedure did the lens have to be removed and anterior vitrectomy performed, whereas the remaining two were cured by neodymium-YAG laser disruption of the anterior hyaloid. In these two cases, the posterior capsule remained intact. Neodymium-YAG laser vitreolysis should be the first step in the management of these cases because of its safety compared with open surgery.\r"

However, when the central 30 degrees of the visual field was tested, reversible visual field defects were found in 11 of 19 eyes. We believe that the substantial elevation of intraocular pressure during gravity inversion may pose potential risks to the eyes, and we recommend that inversion for extended periods of time be avoided.\r"

Ocular pressure and the adrenal response were monitored over a seven-hour period. The decrease in ocular pressure after metyrapone administration was significantly greater than that after placebo. The 14 subjects could be designated as responders or nonresponders by decline of ocular pressure after metyrapone administration compared with response after placebo. The responders could be further differentiated from the nonresponders by a smaller decrease in ocular pressure over time in response to the placebo and by a smaller decrease over time of plasma cortisol level in response to metyrapone. These results provide further evidence that plasma glucocorticoids may play a role in the regulation of ocular pressure.\r"

The largest sensitivity losses for both glaucoma and ocular hypertensive groups were disclosed by a color threshold test with blue lights designed to isolate the blue-sensitive pathways of the visual system. The loss of sensitivity for both the glaucoma group and the ocular hypertensive group is consistent with recent reports (from postmortem studies of human eyes) of extensive axon death even in the absence of glaucomatous field defects.\r"

Bilateral uveitis was noted in all patients, ranging from an anterior uveitis that was responsive to steroids to a severe panuveitis with vitritis, cataract, optic disc swelling, and macular edema. In one patient, topical acyclovir ointment resulted in a substantial decrease in the inflammatory reaction when added to systemic acyclovir therapy. Another patient displayed a keratitis that resolved with topical steroid therapy. Cataract and vitreous surgery were also beneficial in the management of these patients.\r"

A standard protocol of intravenous administration of methylprednisolone was followed, commencing with 1 g on three occasions in the first week. Additional immunosuppression was required in six patients. The therapy improved the patients' conditions, with a significant reduction in the severity of the scleritis in all patients. Side effects included psychological disturbances, hypertension, and elevated glucose levels, but no patient required cessation of treatment. Pulse methylprednisolone treatment alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive agents is an effective therapy in severe scleritis and has fewer potential side effects than more conventional regimens of corticosteroid administration.\r"

We studied 109 subjects, using a standardized personality inventory (the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory) that measures 20 personality scales-both normal and pathologic. Subjects were divided into three age-matched groups: (1) patients with keratoconus, (2) patients with other chronic eye diseases, and (3) normal controls. Results indicated that although chronic eye disease, including keratoconus, did have an impact on personality functioning in young and middle-aged adults, no specific complex of personality characteristics attributable to keratoconus could be identified. Patients with keratoconus differed from normal controls in much the same way as did patients with other chronic eye diseases, being less conforming and more passive-aggressive, paranoid, and hypomanic. They tended to more disorganized patterns of thinking and scored higher on substance abuse indicators. The influence of keratoconus on personality may be a function of the timing and nature of its onset in the context of the patient's psychosocial development.\r"

Two other measures for cell type-the number of epithelioid cells per high-power field (Epi/HPF) and the inverse SD of nucleolar area (ISDNA)-were evaluated as prognostic factors for survival following enucleation for uveal melanoma in 232 patients. Variables significantly related to the number of Epi/HPF were related to ISDNA. Larger, more anteriorly located tumors had a high number of Epi/HPF and a low ISDNA. The two measures were also correlated. Using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, both measures were related to tumor deaths. Worse prognosis was associated with a higher number of Epi/HPF and a lower ISDNA. Considered together in Cox' proportional hazards analysis, both measures independently predicted outcome. Separately, each measure predicted uveal melanoma-related deaths, in combination with largest tumor dimension, invasion of tumor to the line of transection, and location of the anterior tumor margin. Although ISDNA is the more objective measure of cell type, its practicality compared with other measures of cell type must also be considered.\r"

The probability of progression to severe retinopathy was significantly greater for eyes with the following baseline characteristics: greater overall retinopathy severity, higher fluorescein leakage, higher capillary nonperfusion, and lower electroretinographic oscillatory potential amplitudes. The summed amplitudes of the oscillatory potentials, the overall severity of retinopathy, and the severity of fluorescein angiographic leakage were found to be independent predictors of progression to severe proliferative retinopathy in a regression model; capillary nonperfusion was not found to predict progression independently when fluorescein leakage was included in the model. Probability curves based on the regression model can be used to support clinical decisions concerning when to perform panretinal laser photocoagulation and how often to follow up patients with less than severe proliferative diabetic retinopathy.\r"

The angiograms demonstrated that different-sized leaks appear in the retinal vessels in adjacent areas during the course of the inflammation. Most retinal vessels leaked only fluorescein sodium and no dextran of any size, suggesting that it is the unbound fluorescein that leaks out of these vessels and not fluorescein bound to plasma albumin. It was not possible to tell by clinical examination which areas would leak the larger-molecular weight tracers. Ultrastructural studies of the veins leaking the dextrans revealed areas of abnormal endothelial tight junctions, whereas the tight junctions were normal in areas where leakage occurred with fluorescein alone.\r"

At the time of penetrating keratoplasty and anterior chamber intraocular lens removal, we attempt to reimplant a posterior chamber lens whenever possible because of the complications associated with anterior chamber lenses. We developed a technique to exchange an anterior chamber lens with a posterior chamber lens during penetrating keratoplasty. The intraocular lens loops are inserted in the ciliary sulcus and the optic is sutured to the iris.\r"

  ".W": "A punch was developed for excision of the anterior lens capsule, performed primarily in conjunction with so-called endocapsular procedures. The punch allows uniform anterior capsulectomy without any significant damage to the zonule. The punch is particularly useful for eyes with weak or scarred lens capsules, which are difficult to manipulate with conventional tools for anterior capsulectomy.\r"

  ".W": "Because of a previously observed plateau of clinical response after long-term methotrexate (MTX) therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), we investigated whether such treatment might lead to acquired resistance to the drug. We studied the activity of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) (the target enzyme of MTX) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 11 RA patients who had been treated with MTX for a median of 43 months. The enzyme levels were markedly increased compared with levels found in the cells of 6 RA patients treated with other slow-acting drugs. Quantitative dot-blot analysis of DNA from 7 of these patients showed no evidence of DHFR gene amplification. No correlation was observed between increased levels of DHFR and either response to therapy or to the weekly MTX dosage. Phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes from 6 patients with increased levels of DHFR showed no evidence of MTX resistance in vitro. The increased DHFR levels may result from binding of MTX to the enzyme, which may block the normal degradation pathways; they do not appear to be a marker of impending drug resistance.\r"
