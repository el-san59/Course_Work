  ".W": "Rapid, transient induction of the human c-fos proto-oncogene by extracellular signals requires the presence in cis of the serum response element (SRE). Two protein factors that bind to the SRE in vitro are the serum response factor (p67SRF) and polypeptide p62. These polypeptides must interact with one another and the SRE for efficient serum induction of the c-fos gene. Here we use dimethyl sulphate genomic footprinting to establish the in vivo protein contacts on the SRE and flanking sequences. In human A431 cells the patterns of protection and hyper-reactivity that we find are consistent with the presence of p67SRF, p62, and at least one other protein immediately 3' to p67SRF. The protein-DNA contacts we observe within the SRE are present before induction by epidermal growth factor and are unchanged during gene activation and subsequent repression. Our results indicate that a specific DNA-protein architecture may be maintained at the c-fos SRE, regardless of changes in the transcriptional state of the gene. Such established structures could be important generally in rapid transcriptional responses to extracellular signals.\r"

  ".W": "Resting B cells express few, if any, receptors for interleukin-2 (IL-2), whereas activated B cells can express receptors for and respond to IL-2. IL-2 receptors can exist on the cell surface in three different forms; the complete high-affinity receptor, a heterodimer consisting of a chain of relative molecular mass (Mr) 70-75,000 (70-75K) and a chain of Mr 55K; the 70-75K chain alone, with intermediate affinity for IL-2; or the 55K chain alone, with low affinity for IL-2. We have previously reported that IL-5-stimulated B cells are induced to express the 55K chain. We report here evidence for the differential regulation of the expression of the two chains, namely that IL-4 and IL-5 can independently induce expression of the 70-75K and 55K chains respectively on murine B cells. As expected, cells stimulated to express the 55K chain alone are unresponsive to IL-2, whereas cells stimulated to express either the 70-75K chain or the 70-75/55K heterodimer respond to IL-2, at a high and low ligand concentration respectively, with a marked increase in proliferation. This orchestration of receptor expression and factor responsiveness may represent a novel activation pathway for B cells, where the two chains of a compound receptor are shown to be independently regulated.\r"

This modulation probably constitutes a major mechanism of presynaptic inhibition. Although recent work has implicated GTP-binding proteins in the mechanism of current inhibition, it is still unknown how the activation of those proteins alters the operation of the channels. In their initial description of the phenomenon, Dunlap and Fischbach proposed that noradrenaline acts by somehow reducing the number of functions calcium channels in the cell. By contrast with this hypothesis, I have found that inhibition of Ca2+ current is primarily due to a transmitter-induced change in the voltage-dependence with which channels are opened. Transmitters profoundly alter the voltage-dependence of channel activation, but there is little or no change in the number of functional channels activated by very large depolarizations. There is also little effect on the voltage-dependence of inactivation.\r"

Peptide binding to class II MHC proteins, and T-cell recognition of these complexes at the functional level has been demonstrated. Although considerable evidence suggests that class I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) recognize class I-peptide complexes, this has not yet been directly demonstrated. Chen and Parham have recently detected a low level of direct binding of radiolabelled influenza peptides to class I HLA proteins, but the relevance of this binding to T-cell recognition remains uncertain. We report here that purified class I proteins pulsed with influenza peptides can trigger antigen-specific, TCR-mediated degranulation by CTL. Effective pulsing depends on both peptide concentration and time, and can occur within 60 minutes. These results provide strong support for the formation of an antigenic complex that is recognized by CTL in which peptide antigens are bound to isolated class I proteins.\r"

In this retrospective review of 157 patients with retinal vein occlusion, 74 had unilateral major trunk occlusion (MTO), i.e., either central (CRVO) or hemicentral (hemi-CRVO) retinal vein occlusion, 12 had MTO in both eyes, and two had MTO in one eye and branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) in the other. In 69 patients there was unilateral BRVO. Thus, 8.9% of the patients had bilateral retinal vein occlusive disease of any type. Of the 88 patients with MTO in at least one eye, 13.6% had MTO disease in the fellow eye as well and only 2.3% had BRVO in the fellow eye. Major trunk occlusion in one eye thus appears to be a greater risk factor than BRVO for the bilateral occurrence of retinal vein occlusive disease. Another factor predisposing to bilateral occurrence in the group of patients with MTO was the coexistence of diabetic retinopathy (P less than 0.05).\r"

The putative tat-specific clone was active in trans-activation of the SIV MAC long terminal repeat in COS-1 and Jurkat cells. In contrast, the human immunodeficiency virus 1 long terminal repeat was significantly trans-activated only in the COS-1 cells. This suggests that trans-activation by the SIV tat gene is modulated by cell-specific factors. The structure of all of the clones suggested an mRNA splicing pattern more complex than that described for human immunodeficiency virus 1.\r"

  ".W": "The transactivator protein, tat, encoded by the human immunodeficiency virus is a key regulator of viral transcription. Activation by the tat protein requires sequences downstream of the transcription initiation site called the transactivating region (TAR). RNA derived from the TAR is capable of forming a stable stem-loop structure and the maintenance of both the stem structure and the loop sequences located between +19 and +44 is required for complete in vivo activation by tat. Gel retardation assays with RNA from both wild-type and mutant TAR constructs generated in vitro with SP6 polymerase indicated specific binding of HeLa nuclear proteins to the TAR. To characterize this RNA-protein interaction, a method of chemical \"imprinting\" has been developed using photoactivated uranyl acetate as the nucleolytic agent. This reagent nicks RNA under physiological conditions at all four nucleotides in a reaction that is independent of sequence and secondary structure. Specific interaction of cellular proteins with TAR RNA could be detected by enhanced cleavages or imprints surrounding the loop region. Mutations that either disrupted stem base-pairing or extensively changed the primary sequence resulted in alterations in the cleavage pattern of the TAR RNA. Structural features of the TAR RNA stem-loop essential for tat activation are also required for specific binding of the HeLa cell nuclear protein.\r"

The present study describes a female child with SCID who had a primary defect in the ability of T cells to secrete interleukin 2 (IL-2). B- and T-cell numbers were normal, but their functions were severely deficient. Mitogen and antigen-driven lymphoproliferative responses were diminished but were correctable in vitro with recombinant IL-2 (rIL-2). The patient's phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes expressed IL-2 receptors normally. Despite the presence of the gene for IL-2, the patient's cells were grossly deficient in messenger RNA for IL-2 and endogenous IL-2 production. Pokeweed mitogen-driven B-cell differentiation was decreased and was not corrected by the addition of normal T cells to the B cells. Two attempts at immune reconstitution by haploidentical bone marrow transplantation failed. Therapy with rIL-2 (30,000 units/kg, given daily i.v.) resulted in marked clinical improvement as well in improved T-cell functions. The child, now 3 yr old, has been on rIL-2 therapy for 2 yr and receives rIL-2 (30,000 units/kg) three times weekly at home. This case study points to a new direction in the treatment of such disorders with rIL-2.\r"

The capacity for ligand uptake was determined by examining the parameters that contribute to this constant, including the number of cell-surface binding sites and the internalization rate constant (ke). The maximum uptake of 14.G2a is 11-fold greater for M21 than for T293 cells, due to a 2.7-fold difference in binding sites and a 4-fold difference in the rate of antibody internalization. The capacity for ligand uptake correlates with the cytotoxic activity of the 14.G2a-RA immunotoxin against these two cell lines. Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate that the consequence of internalization of 14.G2a-RA is the intracellular release of undegraded ricin A-chain from the antibody. These studies indicate that the rate of internalization is a quantitative parameter that plays a key role in predicting the cytotoxic potency of this immunotoxin.\r"

SPECT/IMP imaging was performed in ten patients with probable SDAT and seven healthy subjects. Multiple ROIs were manually and semiautomatically generated, and uptake was quantitated for each ROI. Mean cortical activity was estimated as the average of the mean activity in 24 semiautomatically generated ROIs; mean cerebellar activity was determined from the mean activity in separate ROIs. A ratio of parietal to cerebellar activity less than 0.60 and a ratio of parietal to mean cortical activity less than 0.90 allowed correct categorization of nine of ten and eight of ten patients, respectively, with SDAT and all control subjects.

In 11 patients, high-resolution CT was used. In 12 patients, CT demonstrated cystic air spaces, usually less than 10 mm in diameter. In three of these 12, cysts were the only abnormality, but in six others, nodules (usually less than 5 mm in diameter) were also present. Two patients had only nodules and one, only emphysema. CT showed that many lesions that appeared reticular on plain radiographs were actually cysts. CT showed no central or peripheral concentration of lesions, but it did reveal that many small nodules were distributed in the centers of secondary lobules around small airways. CT findings correlated better with the diffusing capacity (rho = -0.71) than did the plain radiographic findings (rho = -0.57). Thus, CT was better than radiography at showing the morphology and distribution of lung abnormalities.\r"

The lesions were most often diffuse (n = 16), with a topographic predominance in the upper or middle lung zones in nine patients. Comparison of CT scans and chest radiographs shows that small and large cysts and micronodules are better detected with CT. Comparison of abnormalities found in patients in the early and late stages of the disease, as well as the evolution observed in one case, suggests that CT patterns progress from nodules to cavitated nodules and thick-walled cysts to cysts to confluent cysts.\r"

Myocardial infarction was defined on the basis of concordant reductions in segmental perfusion and glucose utilization; myocardial ischemia, on the basis of preservation of glucose utilization (metabolic viability) in segments with hypoperfusion at rest. Of the 142 segments analyzed, 101 had fixed defects, 31 had partially reversible defects, and ten had completely reversible defects. Preserved glucose utilization was identified in 47 (46.5%) of the segments with fixed defects and 20 (64.5%) of the segments with partially reversible defects. Of the ten segments with completely reversible defects, five (50%) were normal, and five (50%) exhibited ischemia at PET. Visual improvement in a persistent thallium defect at delayed imaging was not associated with residual glucose metabolic activity. Thus, PET can be used to detect glucose metabolic activity in a significant proportion of myocardial segments with fixed or partially redistributing defects seen at thallium SPECT, which suggests that the extent of tissue viability in patients with ischemic heart disease is underestimated at thallium scintigraphy.\r"

Restriction sites change, and affected sequences typically become heavily methylated. To characterize the alterations of the DNA, duplicated sequences were isolated before and after one or more sexual cycles. DNA sequencing and heteroduplex analyses demonstrated that the process (termed RIP) produces exclusively G-C to A-T mutations. Changes occur principally at sites where adenine is 3' of the changed cytosine. A sequence duplicated at a distant site in the genome lost approximately 10 percent of its G-C pairs in one passage through a cross. A closely linked duplication of the same sequence that was passed twice through a cross lost about half of its G-C pairs. The results suggest a mechanism for the RIP process.\r"

The effects of subtle interior packing changes, both separate from and combined with changes in buried side chain hydrophobicity, were measured. For the interior apolar-to-apolar substitutions studied, the two effects were of the same magnitude and alteration of packing without accompanying hydrophobicity changes substantially destabilized the protein.\r"

In 29 of the 47 patients we studied, the causative factor remained obscure. Variceal hemorrhage occurred in all and was the indication for our observation and treatment. In 11 adult patients (mean age of 22.1 years), surgical treatment was not performed because of reluctance of the patient or because of technical reasons: nine of the patients rebled and one patient died because of massive bleeding. Direct procedures on esophageal varices had a high rate of rebleeding (seven of 11 patients) independent of the age of the patient when the operation was performed. In 13 patients, shunting offered a good chance of long term protection: three of the 13 rebled at a mean follow-up study of 5.7 years. No recurrence of bleeding was observed in 15 patients when variceal eradication had been obtained after chronic endoscopic sclerotherapy at one to eight years of follow-up study (mean of 3.9 years). The data from this study indicate that sclerotherapy should be the first choice of treatment to control recurrent bleeding in extrahepatic portal hypertension caused by thrombotic obstruction, particularly in the young patient.\r"

  ".W": "The immune suppression that frequently accompanies severe injury undoubtedly contributes to subsequent infectious complications. Various lymphocyte subpopulations may be identified by surface antigen expression, and alterations in antigen expression by lymphocytes may reflect host immune competence. Using monoclonal antibodies (Moabs) and dual-color flow cytometry, we studied lymphocyte phenotypic expression in mice after either controlled burn injury or hind-limb amputation, with use of peripheral blood, lymph node, and spleen for cell preparation. Moabs were utilized specific for T cells (Lyt-1), helper/inducer cells (L3T4), suppressor/cytotoxic cells (Lyt-2), B cells (IgG), and activated T cells (Ia or IL-2 receptor). The assay techniques called for small amounts of tissue and avoided gradient procedures that might result in selective loss of some lymphocyte populations. The most consistent changes observed were depressions in percentages of L3T4+ and Lyt-2+ cells in spleens of burned mice, accompanied by depression in Ia+ (possibly activated or proliferating) subsets of L3T4+ and Lyt-2+ cells, and the appearance of increased percentages of non-B, non-T lymphocytes. Changes in lymph node cells were minimal. The major alteration seen in peripheral blood was substantial depression of Ia+ subsets, although burned mice had increased circulating Lyt-2+ cells on several late postburn days. Burned mice, unlike limb-trauma mice, had marked splenic hypertrophy with more than a 300% increase in spleen weight after the 30-day postburn period. Eschar excision/implantation experiments indicated that splenic hypertrophy and splenocyte phenotypic changes are related to the presence of burned tissue, which suggests that burned tissue may partially mediate immune changes that accompany severe burn injury.\r"

Total lymphocyte and T4 cell counts were low in children who died during the initial PCP infection but had considerable overlap with survivors. Response to phytohemagglutinin was measured in 5 of the 7 patients who died initially. In these patients, the mean phytohemagglutinin response was 1977 cpm. Of the 11 early survivors, 10 died within 27 months after PCP. Mean phytohemagglutinin response was 46,079 cpm in patients who died within 1 year, and 44,768 cpm in those who died later. Only 1 child is still alive 5 years after PCP illness. Children with AIDS and PCP infection have high initial mortality and poor long-term prognosis. Response to phytohemagglutinin is helpful in predicting who will survive initial PCP infection.\r"

Child-Turcotte-Pugh class was A in 11 patients, B in 30, and C in 20. Varices were F1 in 18, and F2-F3 in 43. During follow-up of up to 40 months, one patient was lost to follow-up and 22 patients died, seven of gastrointestinal bleeding and 15 of liver failure. The probability of death from any cause was significantly related to Child-Turcotte-Pugh class, ascites, encephalopathy, s-albumin, s-bilirubin, prothrombin index, and galactose elimination capacity. Independent prognostic variables according to Cox's model resulted s-albumin, s-bilirubin, encephalopathy, and varices. Considering only patients who died from liver failure, survival was univariately related to the same determinants, whereas the Cox's model individuated s-bilirubin, s-albumin, ascites, and galactose elimination capacity as independent prognostic indicators. Considering only patients who died from gastrointestinal bleeding no Cox model could be performed due to the small number of deaths. In patients with F1 varices, the probability of death from liver failure was 5 times higher than that from gastrointestinal bleeding; in patients with F2-F3 varices, liver failure and gastrointestinal bleeding each accounted for approximately half of the deaths. These data could become useful when programming a clinical trial of prophylaxis which considers reduction in mortality as the main end-point.\r"

  ".U": "89300679\r", 
  ".W": "The so-called \"low T3 syndrome\" has frequently been reported in patients with cirrhosis. In this study, we aimed to determine whether administration of propranolol to such patients leads to further changes in plasma thyroid hormones, since it can affect their peripheral metabolism. Twenty cirrhotics (11 with ascites) whom we investigated showed no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction. The free fractions of plasma T3 and T4 (FT3, FT4) were determined by radioimmunoassay before and after the achievement of an effective beta-blockade by propranolol. The activity of the sympathetic nervous system also was evaluated by measuring plasma norepinephrine concentration. Under basal conditions, cirrhotics showed a reduced FT3 (2.45 +/- 0.11 SEM vs 3.55 +/- 0.16 pg/ml; p less than 0.001) and comparable FT4 (7.62 +/- 0.79 vs 9.2 +/- 0.42 pg/ml) and FT3/FT4 ratio (0.38 +/- 0.04 vs 0.42 +/- 0.013) with respect to healthy controls. When patients with ascites were considered apart, a reduction of FT4 was also found (6.78 +/- 0.74 pg/ml; p less than 0.01). In these patients, many of whom showed an increased plasma norepinephrine concentration, an inverse correlation between log FT3/FT4 and log plasma norepinephrine concentration was found (r = -0.79; p less than 0.01). The effective beta-blockade did not lead to significant changes in either FT3 or FT4 or FT3/FT4, whether the patients were considered as a whole (2.52 +/- 0.19 pg/ml, 9.3 +/- 1.41 pg/ml, and 0.36 +/- 0.04, respectively), or were split into groups according to the presence of ascites. When administered to cirrhotics, propranolol did not worsen thyroid hormone abnormalities, thus appearing to be safe in this respect. This may result from an impaired influence of the sympathoadrenergic system on thyroid hormone metabolism.\r"

One hundred twenty-nine patients undergoing hemodialysis in 1986 and 1987 were tested for antibody against both viral antigens by EIA (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL). Seroreactive samples for HIV-1 and/or HTLV-I were confirmed by Western blot and, for HTLV-I, by viral cultures. Thirty patients (23.2%) were positive for retroviral infection (22 for HIV-1 alone, four for HTLV-I alone, and four for both HIV-1 and HTLV-I). The most important risk factor was intravenous drug use, followed by blood transfusion. Patients with HIV-1 had lower T4-T8 ratios and higher mortality than those with HTLV-I infection alone. It was concluded that HTLV-I, as well as HIV-1, infection is endemic in chronic dialysis centers in Miami. The clinical consequences of HTLV-I infection in relatively immunocompromised patients with chronic uremia who are undergoing chronic hemodialysis remains to be established.\r"

  ".W": "Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of a nondeletion form of Sicilian beta o hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobinemia (HPFH) (mutation in IVS2 nt1 position) homozygous for haplotype III revealed the presence of four sequence variations: C----T at -158 5' to G gamma, T----C at +2285, C----A at +2476, and A----G at +2676, all 3' to A gamma. The latter three variations in the putative A gamma enhancer are identical to those observed in the case of Seattle HPFH. However, a severe beta o-thalassemia case from Algeria (mutation in IVS1 nt1 position), also homozygous for haplotype III, revealed the same nucleotide variation, albeit an inefficient HbF production. We conclude that the variations in the A gamma enhancer element do not play a role in the regulation of HbF production. To assess both the linkage of these sites with the beta-cluster haplotype and the extent of the polymorphism, we examined several black and Mediterranean chromosomes, by PCR amplification followed by both EspI digestion and oligonucleotide hybridization. Our data indicate that these sequence variations in the enhancer element are absent in Mediterranean haplotypes I, V, and VII but are consistently associated with Mediterranean haplotypes II, III, and IX, as well as with the black beta c-associated haplotype. The common feature of all the latter haplotypes is the presence of a polymorphic PvuII site between A gamma and psi beta, which is thus in linkage disequilibrium with the variations in the A gamma enhancer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All the main TaqI alleles at five Y loci already found in Caucasians are also found in these two populations; 12 of the 16 Caucasian haplotypes were found in these two African populations, and two new haplotypes are Pygmy specific. A proposed phylogeny of the various haplotypes that was derived by using the parsimony criterion established that haplotypes XIII and XVIII, respectively the most frequent one and only one present in Pygmies, are probably ancestral.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sex hormone levels, total cholesterol, and HDL-C were measured in 67 men with CAD from among 191 consecutive male patients between the ages of 25 and 75 undergoing coronary angiography, in 26 men without angiographic evidence of CAD, and in 55 men who were clinically free of CAD. RESULTS: There was a consistently positive correlation between total estradiol or calculated free estradiol and both total cholesterol and HDL-C, which persisted after adjustment for potential confounders. Total cholesterol was associated with total testosterone after controlling for age, adiposity, and the presence or absence of CAD, but not with calculated free testosterone. No association was noted between total testosterone or calculated free testosterone and HDL-C. A significant interaction was observed between estradiol and testosterone with respect to total cholesterol. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates an association between sex hormone levels and lipoprotein metabolism, specifically between estradiol levels and both total cholesterol and HDL-C. Unlike most previous investigators, we were able both to control for the CAD status of our subjects and to consider unbound, biologically active hormone levels. In addition, we documented a complex interaction between endogenous testosterone and estradiol in relation to lipoprotein levels; this association should be considered in future studies.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The adverse effects of arc welding on pulmonary function have been previously documented. However, in many of these studies, the effects of welding exposure and smoking were not separated. Also, some studies did not adjust for or ignored the effects of asbestosis on pulmonary function. We assessed the long-term effects of welding on pulmonary function in welders who had no evidence of asbestosis on chest radiographs, and adjusted each individual value for height, age, and years of cigarette smoking. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study consisted of 226 male construction welders who had never worked in shipyards. Forced vital capacity (FVC) and flows were measured by spirometry, chest radiographs were obtained and examined for evidence of asbestosis using International Labor Office (ILO) criteria, and thoracic gas volume (TGV) was determined by planimetry. The subjects were also administered an occupational and respiratory questionnaire. Data on workers with asbestosis (ILO profusion 1/0 or greater) and pleural abnormalities were excluded. The mean age for the 226 subjects without asbestosis was 45 years, mean height was 175.7 cm, and mean duration of welding was 21.3 years. Pulmonary function measurements are presented as mean percentage of predicted (pop) and adjusted for height, age, and years of smoking. RESULTS: In 151 current cigarette smokers, mean midflows and terminal flows were decreased, FEF25-75 to 93.2 pop and FEF75-85 to 91.2 pop, but FVC, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and TGV were normal. The 43 nonsmokers also had reductions in flows but normal FVC and TGV. Flows in both groups were significantly (p less than 0.05) below those of the referent group. The regression coefficient was -0.0031 for years of welding and FVC pop, -0.0035 for FEV1 pop, and -0.0080 for midflow pop (FEF25-75) (all significant at p less than 0.05), but the coefficient for FEF75-85 pop was not significant. As calculated from regression equations, 40 years of welding would reduce FVC to 95.2 pop, FEV1 to 92.2 pop, midflow to 79.2 pop, and FEF75-85 to 81.7 pop. CONCLUSION: Long-term exposure to welding gases and fumes reduced flows in small airways of welders without asbestosis.\r"

Using [18F]N-methylspiroperidol and positron emission tomography, the authors assessed dopamine receptor occupancy in 10 schizophrenic patients before and after treatment with haloperidol. Responders and nonresponders had virtually identical indices of [18F]N-methylspiroperidol uptake after treatment, indicating that failure to respond clinically was not a function of neuroleptic uptake or binding in the CNS.\r"

Apnoea occurred significantly more frequently with propofol than with etomidate at each speed of injection and the incidence of apnoea greater than 60 seconds with propofol was significantly higher when injected over 20 seconds than 80 seconds.

In addition, cardiodynamic changes were measured using a left ventricular catheter and needle force probes. Propofol was associated with significant decreases in systolic (19.9%) and diastolic (25.3%) arterial pressures associated with a 17.3% decrease in cardiac output (CO) and a 11.6% reduction in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) without change in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP). These changes were most pronounced 1 min after the injection of propofol. At 5 and 10 min after the administration of propofol, heart rate (HR) decreased significantly. Minimal changes in hemodynamics were observed with etomidate. Propofol lowered systolic left ventricular pressure (LVPsys) by 17.6%. Signals generated by the force probes in the left ventricular myocardium showed a significant reduction (16.3%) in left ventricular force (LVF) and a decrease in early systolic rates of increase in force (dF/dt max) by 23.5% associated with propofol. In the presence of an unchanged preload, an unchanged HR, and a decreased SVR, the reduction in CO suggests that propofol has a negative inotropic effect. This negative inotropic effect was confirmed by a reduction in LVF and dF/dt max.\r"

The remaining 16 patients were explored for persistent symptoms, an abnormality on GI series, or a mass lesion on CT scan. Thirty-eight patients underwent resection of the tumor and seven had palliative bypass procedures. This study suggests that a high index of suspicion and early diagnostic evaluation including a small bowel series is necessary to prevent the large number of small bowel tumors presenting as surgical emergencies. In particular, small bowel tumors should be suspected in patients with abdominal pain of unknown etiology, unexplained weight loss, or occult GI bleeding.\r"

A retrospective study of 130 patients admitted to our unit with severe acute pancreatitis during the period from 1965 to 1987 revealed 18 cases of pancreatic abscess. All pancreatic abscesses were primary in nature, and no infected pseudocysts were included in the series. Clinical surveillance, repeated laboratory tests, conventional radiology, and especially ultrasonography and CT scan all contributed to the preoperative diagnosis. The applied treatment was surgical debridement of all necrotic tissue and either local or extensive external drainage. In 12 cases this procedure was combined with other surgical interventions. The recorded mortality rate was 16.66 per cent. Factors adversely affecting survival include: 1) severity of precipitating pancreatitis; 2) difficulty in making early and accurate diagnosis of the pancreatic abscess; 3) marked tendency for recurrence of sepsis; and 4) life-threatening associated complications and/or diseases.\r"

Fifty-nine patients were treated with intravenous streptokinase and heparin, and referred for elective catheterization. Angioplasty or bypass surgery was performed only in patients judged to be at risk for reinfarction. One or more predetermined criteria for infarct segment viability were present in 47 (80%) of 59 patients. Angina recurred in 24 patients and enzyme-positive reinfarction in 9 patients, but only 2 patients developed new Q waves or a creatine kinase rise to over twice the normal value. Of 18 patients judged to be at low risk for reinfarction, only 1 required urgent angioplasty or bypass surgery. Fourteen-day mortality was 7% and infarct vessel patency was 94%. These data indicate that physicians in small community hospitals with a close relationship to a referral center and with a carefully designed protocol can administer thrombolytic therapy safely and effectively. By subsequent stratification of patients according to the risk of recurrent infarction, 22% of patients eligible for revascularization were spared urgent angioplasty or bypass surgery.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether the diagnostic evaluation of patients admitted for nongastrointestinal disease, who subsequently bleed while in hospital (secondary bleeders), should differ from that of patients hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of GI bleeding, patients consecutively referred to a consultant service were prospectively evaluated. Ninety-four primary and 43 secondary bleeders underwent a detailed historical survey and endoscopic or radiologic diagnostic evaluation of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. Primary bleeders hemorrhaged with greater severity and potential or definitive bleeding sites were found in them more often than in secondary bleeders. Primary bleeders usually had upper gastrointestinal lesions, whereas secondary bleeders frequently had colonic bleeding. Prior historical events other than the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents did not affect the source or severity of bleeding. The clinical spectra of primary and secondary bleeders differ so that evaluation of secondary bleeders of modest severity should be modified and often can be deferred until the underlying disease has been controlled.\r"

The clinical course of immune thrombocytopenia in relation to human immunodeficiency virus infection and the patients' responses to splenectomy and immune variables were determined. All five patients developed antibody to human immunodeficiency virus 6 to 60 months (median, 24 months) before the onset of thrombocytopenia, and two patients became human immunodeficiency virus antigenemic (one patient at the onset of immune thrombocytopenia and the other 60 months after the onset of immune thrombocytopenia [24 months after splenectomy]). All five patients had a strong platelet-associated immunoglobulin G and three patients also had a weak platelet-associated immunoglobulin M on their platelets. In four of five patients danazol therapy failed, and three patients required moderate doses of prednisone. Because of the progression of immune thrombocytopenia, four of the five patients underwent splenectomy with preoperative high-dose intravenous immune globulin. All four had an excellent immediate response to splenectomy, with a rise in platelet count to more than 300 x 10(9)/L and sustained remission during postsplenectomy follow-up of 6 to 45 months. There was no significant drop in CD4 and CD8 counts after splenectomy, and all four patients remained clinically well.\r"

He was found to have a severe T-cell immunodeficiency and evidence of persistent Epstein-Barr virus infection. Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen was not found to be present within lymphoma cells. The combination of defective T-cell function and persistent Epstein-Barr virus infection may have predisposed this patient with rheumatoid arthritis to the development of a malignant clone of B lymphocytes.\r"

Forty-six percent of the grafts were atherosclerotic. The atherosclerosis was typically rapid in development, concentric, diffuse, without a fibrous cap, with numerous foam cells and inflammatory cells, including multinucleate giant cells, with erosion of the media by the inflammatory reaction. The histologic features of the grafts were similar to those reported in experimental models of immune-mediated atherosclerosis. On this basis we propose that aortocoronary saphenous vein graft atherosclerosis, and possibly intimal fibroplasia, may be an immune-mediated disease.\r"

We now further evaluate the distribution of the CTIR cell, characterize the coexistence of serotonin and calcitonin, and for the first time describe the coexpression of calcitonin and other calcitonin gene family peptides (calcitonin gene-related peptide and katacalcin) in the CTIR cell. Finally, the morphological ultrastructure of the secretory granule of the CTIR cell is analyzed. The finding of multiple calcitonin gene family peptides in prostatic and urethral EP cells and the specific localization of calcitonin to secretory granules strongly suggest that the calcitonin gene is expressed in this region and the products stored in the EP cells. The relatively high levels of calcitonin reported in the semen and the dendritic and nondendritic morphological features of the CTIR cell, respectively, suggest a lumencrine (exocrine), paracrine, and possibly endocrine role for calcitonin. The production of calcitonin and related peptides by the prostate may have implications in various pathologic processes of the prostate.\r"

They developed skills to maximize their independence, including independent electric wheelchair mobility and independent use of environmental control systems. They were able to communicate verbally by corking their tracheostomies, to write and type by using mouthsticks, and to use computers with mouth-sticks or pneumatic switches. All four patients were discharged to home with a family member as the primary care-provider. Successful discharge can be achieved only by adequate family teaching and counseling, optimal equipment prescription, adequate nursing and other community support for the primary care-provider, and close medical follow-up.\r"

The frequency of oesophageal symptoms and dysmotility did not differ between the two subsets, but patients with diffuse scleroderma had more pronounced motility disturbances. Calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, and telangiectasia were equally frequent in the two groups. Vital capacity, total lung capacity, and static lung compliance were lower among patients with diffuse scleroderma (p less than 0.001), who also had a higher frequency of lung fibrosis (p less than 0.001) and cardiomegaly (p less than 0.01). Sixty eight per cent of the patients with diffuse scleroderma and 62% of those with the CREST syndrome had a positive antinuclear antibody test, which was associated with oesophageal hypomotility (p less than 0.001), fat malabsorption (p less than 0.01) and pulmonary dysfunction (p less than 0.05). Thus, the severity of organ manifestations varied not only with the form of PSS, but also with the absence/presence of antinuclear antibody. This study shows that the term 'CREST syndrome' could be replaced by 'limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis'.\r"

Synovial tissue was obtained by needle biopsy. Hyperplasia of the synovial lining layer, present in 69%, was the most frequently observed abnormality in synovium obtained from uninvolved joints. Perivascular mononuclear cell infiltration was present in 31% and consisted predominantly of helper T-cells. Increased vascularity and fibrin deposition were not notable features. Clinically overt synovitis emerged in only two patients during a follow-up period of up to 36 months. In conclusion, a considerable degree of histological change was observed in the apparently uninvolved knee joints of patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. The presence of subclinical synovitis challenges current concepts of disease activity and clinical remission. Further study is required to determine whether the features described may be associated with progressive joint erosion.\r"

Photosensitivity was present in 87% of Ro-positive white patients and in 54% of Ro-negative white patients (p = 0.007). However, in black patients with SLE there was a strong negative association: 4% of Ro-positive patients were photosensitive while 55% of Ro-negatives were photosensitive (p = 0.001). This suggests that black SLE patients may possess a factor which 'blocks' photosensitivity, perhaps by preventing local tissue damage caused by the interaction of Ro antibodies and ultraviolet light.\r"

Lesions were asymptomatic in all but one patient (on naproxen), and the gastric antrum was the commonest region involved. Of the 11 patients who developed endoscopic abnormalities in both groups, seven (64%) were moderate to heavy smokers.

Our purpose was to define the role played by cytotoxic mechanisms in the control of leukemic cell growth in ANLL. Experiments were carried out at resting conditions and after in vitro activation with recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) and anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (moAb). At resting conditions, PBMC recovered from ANLL patients displayed a NK function that was not significantly different from controls (mean +/- standard error of the mean [SEM]: 21.9% +/- 3.9% versus control values of 27.5% +/- 2.9%; the P value was not significant [NS]), but they were unable to show cytotoxic activity against autologous and allogeneic leukemic cells. After in vitro boosting with rIL-2, PBMC were able to generate lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells, as demonstrated by an increased killing of NK-resistant Daudi targets (16.3% +/- 2.7%). Although LAK activity was quantitatively lower than in control subjects (mean +/- SEM: 16.3% +/- 2.7% versus control values of 79.8% +/- 3.1%; P less than 0.001), it still exerted a cytotoxic effect against autologous and allogeneic leukemic cells. Similar results were obtained when anti-CD3 moAb was used as a stimulus in vitro. Our data suggest that nonspecific cytotoxic cells may be triggered to exert an in vitro cytotoxic effect on leukemic cells, which could possibly play a key role in vivo in the control of leukemic cell growth regulation.\r"

  ".W": "The potential of using a blood test enumerating oncofetal ferritin-bearing lymphocytes (FBL) as a biomarker for early breast cancer was further explored. Nine hundred women attending a high-risk breast cancer clinic and 2500 normal-risk women were physically examined and their blood drawn for FBL determination using a newly developed radioimmunoassay. The FBL test results were compared to clinically or histopathologically diagnosed breast disease and to known breast cancer risk factors. A gradual increase in the mean FBL ratio was seen from normal risk disease-free women to those with in situ or early stage breast cancer. The percentage of women with positive FBL was 13.6% for the normal risk group, 19% and 25.7% for clinically and histopathologically diagnosed benign breast disease, respectively, and 100, 77.8, and 66.7% for in situ, Stage I, and Stage II breast cancer, respectively. In locally advanced disease (Stage III) the percentage of positive women was only 17.2%. It was further found that a negative FBL result in known breast cancer patients at Stage I, II of the disease was a bad prognostic marker indicating a shorter disease-free survival. The follow-up of patients after surgery by periodical clinical examination and the FBL test revealed that the positive FBL was declining after removal of the precancerous or malignant tumor and that it was highly sensitive (100%) in predicting tumor development and recurrence. Using a logistic regression analysis, an FBL-positive test indicated a significant association with risk of early breast cancer (odds ratio = 2.9; 95% confidence interval = 1.4-5.8). Being a measure of the immune response the positive FBL was associated with early breast cancer and good prognosis. Since patients with locally advanced cancer and poor prognosis were FBL negative but such patients were shown to have increased serum ferritin levels. It is suggested to use the FBL and serum ferritin assays for screening and diagnosis of breast cancer.\r"

High-dose rIL-2 toxicity included fluid retention, increased creatinine, oliguria, elevated liver enzymes, and significant hypotension. Immunologic studies showed that rIL-2 caused a drop in the number of circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells, T-cells, and natural killer cells which returned to pretherapy levels or above by 24 to 48 hours. The rIL-2 exerted no growth or stimulatory activity on the leukemic cell population. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of a Phase I study of IL-2 therapy in children.\r"

Over many years various treatments have met with varied claims of success, yet no treatment today is universally accepted. We review the underlying clinical problems, the presentation, the treatment and eventual outcome of 113 patients seen at this hospital over the last 20 years with laryngeal papillomatosis. Using multivariate analysis of age at presentation, sex, smoking habits, initial site of disease, frequency of treatment and eventual outcome, two distinct patterns are revealed both between juvenile and adult onset disease and between male and female patients. Single-site lesions in adults have the best prognosis. Female children with multiple confluent lesions at presentation have the worst prognosis.\r"

These 3 patients had very severe EH and absent CMI to HSV for many months after clinical recovery despite normal Ab and concanavalin A responses. In 2 of them, depletion of CD8+ T cells by panning restored the lymphoproliferative response to HSV. Thus their absent CMI may be due to suppressor cell function rather than lack of responsive cells.\r"

Patients with variceal hemorrhage were randomly assigned to receive sclerotherapy at weekly intervals using injection volumes of greater than 15 cc at each treatment or at mean intervals of three days using volumes of less than 10 cc per treatment. Esophageal perforation occurred in three patients (15%) in the small-dose, frequent-injection group as compared to none in the large-dose weekly treatment group (P = 0.07), leading to premature termination of the study. The mean time to rebleeding was significantly shorter in the small-dose, frequent-treatment group (P = 0.05). Variceal obliteration was achieved in a mean of 66% of patients in both groups with no difference in the time to obliteration or the frequency of other complications. Sclerotherapy offered at less than weekly intervals is less effective and is associated with an increased frequency of serious and life threatening complications.\r"

The temporal component consisted partly of seasonal variations and partly of short-term variations. A moderate effect of the SO2 air pollution on the temporal variation was observed, but it was weak, possibly owing to the relatively low levels of SO2 in Amsterdam. The present study shows that contact registration in family practices may yield useful data for epidemiological analysis.\r"

Control rats were treated with 0.25 ml of 50% ethanol or with 30 mg of TNB in 0.25 ml of saline. After 24 h, mucosal ulceration and hemorrhage were observed in TNB/ethanol-, 50% ethanol-, and to a lesser extent, in TNB/saline-treated rats. After 1 wk, mucosal damage was completely resolved in the 50% ethanol and TNB/saline-treated rats but the lesions in the TNB/ethanol-treated rats persisted and progressed to a chronic active inflammatory process after 3 wk. Myeloperoxidase activity was significantly elevated in mucosal scrapings from all treatment groups at all time intervals when macroscopic and microscopic mucosal injury was evident. Interleukin-1 was found to be the most sensitive indicator of mucosal inflammation, and its mucosal values correlated with myeloperoxidase activity. Leukotriene B4 was increased in control rats at 1 wk and in TNB/ethanol-treated rats at all time intervals. The maximal increase in leukotriene B4 was observed at 1 wk. Thromboxane B2 generation was reduced while platelet activating factor generation was not increased in TNB/ethanol-treated rats. These results indicate that in this TNB/ethanol model of gut inflammation, myeloperoxidase activity and interleukin-1 are reliable and sensitive indicators of colonic inflammation, and that thromboxane B2 is not involved in the acute lesions, whereas leukotriene B4 appears in the chronic active inflammatory response.\r"

However, it is not known what effect obliteration of varices has on the development of natural portosystemic shunts. We have studied 15 patients bleeding from esophageal varices due to extrahepatic portal venous obstruction with splenoportovenography, before and after endoscopic obliteration of varices. A splenorenal (natural) shunt was defined when the contrast, injected into the spleen, immediately revealed the inferior vena cava. Such shunts were seen in 6 (40%) of 15 patients after the obliteration of esophageal varices and with a mean interval between the two sessions of splenoportovenography of 23.5 mo. In contrast, none of the 13 patients with bleeding due to extrahepatic portal venous obstruction developed splenorenal shunts (p less than 0.05) in the absence of treatment over a mean period of 40.8 mo. After obliteration, reappearance of esophageal varices requiring sclerotherapy was observed only in patients who did not develop shunts (p less than 0.05). In conclusion, natural splenorenal shunts were seen frequently in a group of patients with extrahepatic portal venous obstruction observed for 23.5 mo who also underwent sclerotherapy. It appears that splenorenal shunts result from sclerotherapy, and protect patients from rebleeding and recurrence of varices.\r"

In certain other autoimmune diseases, an extended haplotype including complement alleles confers a greater relative risk than does B8, DR3. Hence, extended haplotypes were ascertained in autoimmune chronic active hepatitis by typing for HLA, complement alleles C4A, C4B, and Bf, and glyoxalase type 1 or 2. Eight of the 10 B8, DR3 haplotypes were A1, B8, DR3. Of the 8, 7 had the extended haplotype A1, B8, C4AQ0, C4B1, BfS, DR3, but this haplotype occurred in four instances with glyoxalase 2 and in three with glyoxalase 1. Thus, we find that in autoimmune chronic active hepatitis there is a high frequency of null alleles for complement but an extended haplotype does not cause any greater risk for disease than B8, DR3 alone.\r"

The use of a selective medium in which ornithine and lactate replaced arginine and glucose, respectively, allowed viral replication initiated in vivo to be maintained in the coculture for 2 months. Several antiviral compounds including the pyrophosphate analog (phosphonoformic acid) or nucleoside analogs (9 beta-arabinofuranosyl AMP, 1-(2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl)-5-iodocytosine, 1,2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-5-ethyluracil and 1,2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl thymine) were studied in both culture systems for their ability to inhibit duck hepatitis B virus replication. Hepatocytes were treated for 7 days with 1,2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-5-ethyluracil (10 microM) and 1,2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl thymine (0.5 microM) or for 14 days with 9 beta-arabinofuranosyl AMP (90 microM), phosphonoformic acid (100 microM) and 1-(2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl)-5-iodocytosine (6 microM). The effects of the drugs on viral replication were monitored by testing for duck hepatitis B virus DNA in the culture supernatant and in the cells by molecular hybridization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Optimal lymphokine-activated killer activity was demonstrated after 9 to 12 days of culture in recombinant interleukin 2. Lymphokine-activated killer activity, interleukin 2-induced lymphocyte proliferation and total lytic activity generated per culture in all patient groups studied were similar to those of normal control cells cultured under the same conditions. These in vitro data demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining lymphokine-activated killer cells from the blood of patients with liver tumors and provide a rationale for the future use of lymphokine-activated killer cells in adoptive immunotherapy of patients with primary and metastatic hepatic neoplasms.\r"

Most phase 1 exercise routines include a variety of range of motion (ROM) exercises, many of which focus on shoulder joint mobility. The purpose of our study was to examine the effect of shoulder ROM exercise therapy on inpatients after CABG surgery, because data in this area are limited. The results indicate that ROM exercises do not significantly (p greater than 0.05) ameliorate the early ROM loss associated with surgery. We conclude that the loss of shoulder ROM observed after surgery is a function of the surgical procedure and not lack of ROM challenge.\r"

Data indicated a statistically significant (by analysis of variance, p = 0.000) mean increase of 15 mm Hg in mean arterial pressure over the three lung hyperinflation sequences that was not volume dependent. There was a significant increase (p = 0.0001) in arterial oxygen pressure at 0 seconds after suctioning that increased with each increasing lung hyperinflation volume.\r"

However, alpha 1-PI retains its elastase inhibitory activity in vitro when exposed to 10 times the concentration of NO2 used in vivo. We suggested exogenous oxidants such as O2 and NO2 exert their effect in vivo in part through lipid peroxidation. We investigated the mechanism of inactivation of alpha 1-PI in the presence or absence of lipids under oxidant atmosphere. alpha 1-PI in solutions containing phosphate buffer (control), 0.1 mM stearic acid (saturated fatty acid, 18:0), or 0.1 mM linoleic acid (polyunsaturated fatty acid, 18:2) was exposed to either N2 or NO2 (50 ppm for 4 h). Elastase inhibitory capacity of alpha 1-PI was significantly diminished in the presence of 0.1 mM linoleic acid and under NO2 atmosphere (75 +/- 8% of control, P less than 0.01), whereas there was no change in elastase inhibitory capacity of alpha 1-PI in the presence or absence (buffer only) of 0.1 mM stearic acid under a similar condition (109 +/- 11 and 94 +/- 6%, respectively). The inactivated alpha 1-PI as the result of peroxidized lipid could be reactivated by dithiothreitol and methionine sulfoxide peptide reductase, suggesting oxidation of methionine residue at the elastase inhibitory site. Furthermore the inhibitory effect of peroxidized lipid on alpha 1-PI could be prevented by glutathione and glutathione peroxidase and to some extent by alpha-tocopherol.\r"

Most patients were in NYHA Functional Class III (septuagenarian 25%, octogenarian 23%) and in Class IV (septuagenarian 59%, octagenarian 72%) preoperatively. Early death was reported in 41 (6.5%) septuagenarians and in 2 (3.1%) octogenarians. Cardiac-related late mortalities were 6.4% and 6.3%, respectively. Five hundred and eighty-eight septuagenarians and 62 octogenarians were over 30-day survivors; 17.5% (sept) and 35.9% (oct) developed major postoperative complications, including bleeding, pericardial tamponade, sternal dehiscence, myocardial infarction, arrhythmia and pump failure. Mean hospital stays were 14.8 and 19 days, respectively. At follow-up (mean 38.2 months) patients had significant functional improvement by one or more classes in 80% and 60%. Mortality was adversely influenced by (1) NYHA Class IV, (2) use of intra-aortic balloon pumping, (3) postoperative hemorrhage, and (4) prolonged ischemic cross-clamp time. This experience indicates that if adequate trial of medical treatment of angina fails in the elderly patient, aortocoronary bypass surgery becomes a successful alternative.\r"

The risk of death by myocardial infarction during carotid surgery is in the neighborhood of 1%. With Doppler and ultrasonic imaging, it is now possible to recognize carotid stenosis in 11% of these cases. Depending on the extent of the clinical manifestations caused by one or the other of these lesions, there are several therapeutic options: surgery of the carotid with special protection of the myocardium during and after surgery or simultaneous carotid and coronary surgery in high risk cases. Between 1979 and 1986, simultaneous surgery was performed in 18 cases in our department. During the same period, 1194 carotid endarterectomies and 505 coronary bypasses were performed. These 18 cases included 13 males and 5 females with a mean age of 62 years (range: 43 to 78 years). The procedure performed in these cases were 17 carotid endarterectomies, one bypass of the innominate artery and an average of 2 aorto-coronary bypasses per patient. One death from myocardial infarction occurred in the immediate postoperative period and another patient died suddenly 8 months later. The evolution of arterial disease was evaluated in the other patients. Simultaneous carotid and coronary artery surgery is indicated in high risk carotid and coronary patients. Perusal of the results in the literature allows a better appreciation of the indications and risks of this type of surgery. Our series indicates the necessity for a careful preoperative workup in these patients and the need for more accurate screening to obtain better results.\r"

Both distal splenorenal shunts (DSRS) and small-diameter portacaval H-grafts (PCHG) are reported to produce decreased rates of postoperative encephalopathy. We prospectively evaluated 69 patients in whom 27 PCHG and 45 DSRS were performed over a seven-year interval. There were no significant preoperative differences between these groups. Operative mortality was 12.9% overall. DSRS was associated with decreased intraoperative blood transfusions and operative time. Postoperatively, DSRS was associated with significantly less encephalopathy, other postoperative complications, and ascites. Recurrent variceal bleeding was seen in three patients treated with PCHG and two patients with DSRS. We conclude that both DSRS and PCHG are effective in preventing recurrent variceal bleeding, but DSRS remains our procedure of choice because of its decreased rates of postoperative complications.\r"

An immunohistologic study showed that the psoriatic plaques contained an infiltrate composed mainly of activated helper T lymphocytes. After 15 days of cyclosporine treatment, CD4+ cells were significantly fewer in the epidermis and dermis, and Langerhans cells were more regularly distributed in the epidermis. Our studies of neutrophil chemotaxis showed that it is not significantly influenced by cyclosporine in vitro but is decreased in vivo.\r"

Tumor cells in 125 cases of various nonlymphatic skin tumors did not react with either UCHL1 or Ki-B3. Examination of 85 biopsy specimens from 13 different inflammatory skin diseases demonstrates that most reactive T cells in the skin carry the UCHL1 antigen, as controlled by simultaneous immunophenotyping in frozen tissue. With few exceptions, UCHL1 also detected the tumor cells in 28 cases of cutaneous malignant T cell lymphomas. In contrast, Ki-B3 failed to detect tumor cells in seven of eight cases of malignant B cell lymphomas of the skin.\r"

Immunol. 143:1018). The H-2Dd transcripts contained an additional 84 nucleotides derived from the first intervening sequence, whereas 60 extra bases were included in the H-2Kd mRNA. Proteins derived from these transcripts were recognized by mAb. Moreover, both Ag served as recognition elements for CTL, and the mutant H-2Kd molecule functioned as a restricting element for an Ag peptide. As a result of alternative splicing, the mutant proteins should have additional residues at their NH2 termini to increase their lengths by 28 (Dd) or 20 (Kd) amino acids. Immunoprecipitation and analysis on SDS-PAGE demonstrated that the mutant H-2Kd molecule was indeed larger than the normal H-2Kd protein, but the mutant and wild-type H-2Dd Ag were the same size. In addition, treatment of H-2Dd mutant and normal Ag with N-glycanase produced molecules of equal size, demonstrating that the mutant protein was completely glycosylated. Limited amino acid sequencing of this Ag indicated that it was normal H-2Dd. Therefore, before its transfer to the cell surface, post-translational modifications remove the additional NH2-terminal residues of the mutant Dd but not Kd protein.\r"

Monoclonal anti-Ig antibodies with specificity for mu, delta, or kappa chains, regardless of mitogenicity, induced increased c-fos and c-myc mRNA expression with kinetics and magnitude similar to that observed following stimulation of B cells with IL-4. Maximal levels of c-fos mRNA, approximately 30-fold over background, were observed 30 min after stimulation. Maximal levels of c-myc mRNA, approximately 10-fold over background, were observed 60 min after stimulation. Phorbol myristate acetate alone induced expression of these two oncogenes in a similar fashion, suggesting that protein kinase C may be involved in the regulation of their expression following anti-Ig crosslinking. Ionomycin induced only a small increase in c-myc and c-fos message (three- to four-fold), and did not synergize with phorbol myristate acetate, suggesting that the membrane Ig-mediated calcium mobilization may not play a major role in regulation of c-myc or c-fos expression in mouse B cells. In vitro nuclear run-on analyses indicate that c-myc expression is primarily regulated post-transcriptionally, whereas c-fos expression is regulated at the level of transcription. Anti-sense transcription was found to be constitutive for both the c-myc and C-fos loci and was further induced by anti-Ig and IL-4, suggesting an additional mechanism for regulation of these genes. The observation that both anti-Ig and IL-4 regulate the expression of c-fos and c-myc suggests that multiple second messenger generating systems regulate the expression of these oncogenes in normal B cells and that their expression may be necessary, but is not sufficient to drive quiescent B cells into cell cycle.\r"

The inhibition by resting PMN is resistant to blocking with catalase and superoxide dismutase, suggesting that reactive oxygen species are not involved. The addition of TNF greatly enhanced the PMN-mediated inhibition of LAK effector functions. This TNF-enhanced inhibition is reversed by catalase, but not by superoxide dismutase, implicating hydrogen peroxide in the augmented inhibition. Separation of PMN from effector cells and target cells totally abrogates the inhibition by both resting PMN and TNF-treated PMN. Formalin-fixed PMN, heat-treated PMN, PMN lysates, and PMN membrane all fail to mediate any inhibition of LAK. These results suggest that contact with intact viable PMN is needed for inducing LAK inhibition. However, pretreatment of LAK cells with PMN also decreases their cytotoxicity in subsequent chromium release assays. PMN can also inhibit NK cytotoxicity of fresh PBL. However, NK activity is much less sensitive to inhibition by resting PMN than is LAK. TNF also augments PMN inhibition of NK, and there is no significant difference between LAK and NK in sensitivity to the TNF-enhanced inhibition. Our results indicate that PMN can significantly influence the destruction of tumor targets by LAK and NK, and suggest that approaches to circumvent such regulation may be important in the outcome of immunotherapies with IL-2 and LAK cells.\r"

Residues 109, 113, and 116 were critical for stimulation of clones from both haplotypes, although the precise fine specificity varied, even among clones using the same restriction molecule. Residues 109 and 116 are also critical for stimulation of myoglobin-specific I-Ad-restricted clones (Berkower, I., L. A. Matis, G.K. Buckenmeyer, F.R. N. Gurd, D. L. Longo, and J. A. Berzofsky. J. Immunol. 132:1370, 1984). There was also considerable overlap in the size of the minimal determinant necessary for full activity: 106-118 for B10.BR and B10.D2 (Cease, K. B., I. Berkower, J. York-Jolley, and J. A. Berzofsky. J. Exp. Med. 164:1779, 1986) clones and 102-117 for B10.S clones. Despite this similarity in fine specificity, T cell clones were genetically restricted and could not be stimulated with the 102-118 peptide presented by Ia molecules of other haplotypes that could also present this epitope to syngeneic clones. These results suggest that binding of an immunogenic peptide to class II molecules is not sufficient to ensure recognition by a given T cell antigen receptor specific for the peptide, but do not indicate whether the major histocompatibility complex molecules interact directly with the T cell antigen receptor or induce a different recognizable conformation of the peptide.\r"

In a previous study, we have correlated this deficient activation with the inability of mitogens to stimulate hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in lpr T cells, although these cells bind mitogen and express the TCR/CD3 complex. In order to determine whether activation-deficient lpr T cells contain functional GTP-binding (G) protein(s) and phospholipase C, we examined the effects of the G protein activating agent sodium fluoride plus Al+3 (AlF-4). AlF-4 stimulated phosphatidylinositol turnover, a response characteristic of TCR/CD3 occupancy, in mature L3T4+ and Ly2+ T cells. Second, and more important, AlF-4 stimulated the same biochemical events in L3T4-, Ly2- (double-negative) T cells from the normal thymus or from the enlarged lymph nodes of autoimmune-prone mice homozygous for the lpr mutation. However, these double-negative T cells were unresponsive to receptor-active ligands such as T cell mitogens or anti-CD3-epsilon mAb, despite their ability to bind these ligands. These findings suggest that activation-deficient double negative T cells express the receptors, G protein(s) and effector enzymes necessary for second messenger formation and further suggest that the failure of these cells to generate the relevant second messengers in response to mitogens or anti-CD3-epsilon antibody may be due to inefficient coupling of the TCR/CD3 complex to G proteins.\r"

Moreover, when such cells are stimulated with LPS or F(ab')2 anti-mu, they show increased expression of TfR as early as 4 h after activation when the cells are at the boundary of G0 and G1 phase by cell cycle analysis. Cells treated with anti-mu increased TfR expression gradually, reaching a plateau after 46 h, whereas cells with LPS reached their plateau by 12 h. The kinetics of induction of increased TfR expression was similar for both small and large B cells. Inhibition of protein synthesis with anisomycin or inhibition of transcription with actinomycin-D blocked the increased expression of TfR at 4 h. Northern blot analysis showed a marked increase of TfR mRNA at 2 and 4 h with either anti-mu or LPS which was then followed by an apparent decline at 16 h. These findings together with other recent studies justify reevaluation of the generally accepted models placing TfR induction late in the G1 phase of the lymphocyte activation sequence. They support the concept that in the B lymphocyte the TfR gene is selectively transcribed earlier than previously thought, before the general increase in RNA synthesis.\r"

The studies reported here focused on recognition of the hen egg white lysozyme (HEL) tryptic fragment HEL(34-45) by two I-Ak-restricted T cell hybridomas. HEL(34-45) bound to I-Ak created more than one antigenic specificity. Experiments with truncated peptides and alanine-substituted peptides indicated that two T cell hybrids either recognized distinct regions of the HEL(34-45) peptide, or different determinants generated by interaction of the peptide with I-Ak. Although we identified residues of HEL(34-45) that were critical to T cell recognition, no positions in the peptide were identified as I-Ak contact sites using single alanine substitutions. This suggests that more than one site or region of the peptide contributes to the binding to I-Ak. Finally, the murine lysozyme equivalent of 34-45 did not bind to I-Ak. Substitution of the corresponding murine lysozyme (self) residue at position 41 of HEL(34-45) abrogated I-Ak binding of the peptide.\r"

In this report we show that the Ag presentation defect in a truncated-Ia expressing transfectant can be overcome by providing the second messenger for the Ia-mediated signaling event. Preincubation with dibutyryl-cAMP restored the ability of the truncated Ia expressing-transfectant to stimulate IL-2 release by otherwise nonresponsive T hybrids. This provides direct functional evidence that signaling via the cytoplasmic domains of MHC class II proteins leads to the generation of accessory signals in the B cell that are important in T cell activation. The dibutyryl-cAMP induced signal must be on the same cell as the restricting element, does not bypass the requirement for occupancy of the T cell receptor with its normal ligand, and is lost upon fixation of the cells. Thus T cell-B cell interaction involves a two way communication in which both cells sense and respond to the formation of the antigen/MHC/TCR complex.\r"

Previous studies from this laboratory and others have shown that SEB has the capacity to nonspecifically inhibit antibody responses both in vivo and in vitro. We have shown that the inhibitory activity of SEB is mediated, in part, by the activation of a CD8+, CD4-, and CD5- suppressor cell population. The present studies show that the activity of the SEB-induced suppressor cell population is mediated by a soluble factor. This factor nonspecifically inhibits both primary and secondary in vitro antibody responses. Delayed addition analysis demonstrates that the factor must be present early in the ongoing antibody response to exhibit suppressive activity. Monoclonal anti-I-J antisera block the activity of the factor, and eluates (but not filtrates) collected from monoclonal anti-I-J immunoaffinity columns possess suppressive activity. Furthermore, the activity is restricted at the \"I-J\" gene locus, but is not restricted at the Igh locus. Finally, size-exclusion chromatographic analysis shows that the factor possesses an apparent Mr of 26 kDa. These studies suggest that SEB induces the production of a suppressive factor with properties similar to those exhibited by Ag-induced, and typically Ag-specific, suppressor factors.\r"

  ".W": "Cyclosporine is crucial for the prevention of organ allograft rejection and allogeneic graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). Despite its potent immunosuppressive activity, cyclosporine elicits a T cell-mediated autoimmune syndrome after autologous or syngeneic bone marrow transplantation, which has been termed syngeneic GVHD (SGVHD). Recent studies have shown that for disease manifestation, a cytoxan and radiation-sensitive T cell dependent host resistance mechanism must be eliminated, allowing the clonal expansion of autoreactive cells. This report characterizes the autoregulatory lymphocyte population, present in normal animals, capable of inhibiting the adoptive transfer of SGVHD. First, twice the number of unfractionated splenocytes from normal animals to those from autoimmune donors ensured complete inhibition of the adoptive transfer of immune reactivity. Second, the phenotype of this host resistance mechanism in normal splenocytes involves dual regulatory T cell subsets. A helper/inducer subset (W3/25+) must be cotransferred with a cytotoxic/suppressor subset (OX8+) in a ratio that approximates the normal ratio in normal unfractionated splenocytes in order to affect inhibition of the transfer of SGVHD. Moreover the specific inducer regulatory activity resides in the OX22-, W3/25+ subset of Th cells.\r"

Assays of spleen cells for their ability to generate in vitro CTL responses to TNP-modified autologous cells (self + x CTL) and to alloantigens (allo CTL) showed that self + x CTL responses were greatly impaired at 3 to 4 wk postinfection and were undetectable thereafter. Allo CTL responses were normal at 3 to 4 wk, but were reduced at 8 to 9 wk and absent at 14 wk postinfection. This sequential loss of self + x and allo CTL responses was related to a selective defect in Ly-4(CD4)+ Th cell function associated with impaired production of IL-2 and deficient proliferative responses to Con A or to soluble Ag. Changes in the functional characteristics of Ly-4(CD4)+ T cells were unrelated to changes in their frequency in spleen, but did correlate with marked alterations in their distribution among four subsets defined by mAb SM3C11 and SM6C10. Assays of CTL responses generated by mixtures of spleen cells from normal and infected mice suggested that active suppression of Ly-4(CD4)+ Th function may contribute to this defect. Studies of Ly-2(CD8)+ T cells showed that infection with LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus also induced a major phenotypic shift in subpopulations defined by their reactivity with mAb 6C10. However, this phenotypic change did not appear to correlate with major functional defects.\r"

CD8+CD4- lymphocyte lines derived from infected individuals are shown to express AIDS virus-encoded proteins and generate reverse transcriptase activity. Infection of these CD8+CD4- lymphocytes is confirmed at the single cell level by the techniques of immunoelectronmicroscopy and two-color immunohistochemistry. This observation suggests that it may prove problematic to generate cloned, functional T lymphocyte populations from AIDS virus-infected individuals and raises the possibility that CD8+CD4- cells may serve as reservoirs for the AIDS viruses.\r"

Phosphorylation on tyrosine residues was detected by immunoaffinity purification of protein substrates with Sepharose linked antiphosphotyrosine mAb, 1G2. Although phorbol ester stimulated serine phosphorylation of the IL-2R alpha (p55) subunit recognized by alpha TAC mAb, IL-2 did not stimulate any detectable phosphorylation of IL-2R alpha or associated coimmune precipitated proteins. In fact, the tyrosine phosphorylated proteins did not coprecipitate with alpha Tac antibody and similar phosphoproteins were stimulated by IL-2 in IL-2R alpha- human large granular lymphocytes which express only the 70 to 75 kDa IL-2R beta subunit of the high affinity IL-2R. Anti-Tac mAb could inhibit IL-2-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation in activated T cells, which express both IL-2R subunits that together form the high affinity receptor complex, but not in large granular lymphocytes expressing only the IL-2R beta subunit. The data suggest that IL-2 stimulation of tyrosine kinase activities requires only the IL-2R beta subunit.\r"

  ".W": "Recent reports have indicated that in addition to its well characterized effects on B cells and hepatocytes. IL-6 also affects murine and human T cells and thymocytes. Our study was designed to analyze the effects of IL-1 and IL-6 in providing a second signal in T cell activation in the D10.G4.1 assay. Highly purified human rIL-6 was tested. rIL-6 had modest but detectable activity in the D10.G4.1 assay. Maximal enhancement of proliferation induced by IL-6 in the presence of mitogen in the D10.G4.1 assay was always far less than that induced by IL-1. The D10.G4.1 assay was used to test the possibility of synergistic interactions between IL-1 and IL-6. Quantities of IL-6 which alone were not costimulatory to D10 cells enhanced IL-1-induced D10 proliferation significantly when Con A was used as a costimulus. This synergistic response could be partially blocked by antibodies to rIL-6 and fully blocked by a mAb to rIL-1 alpha. In contrast, when 3D3 (a clonotypic activating anti-TCR mAb) was used as a costimulus, no synergistic interaction between IL-1 and IL-6 could be detected. The proliferation of D10 cells induced by IL-1 and 3D3 was unaffected by antibodies to IL-6 but was completely neutralized by antibodies to IL-1. These data suggest that although IL-6 alone cannot substitute for IL-1 in functional assays for IL-1, the presence of IL-6 significantly enhances T cell responses to IL-1 in the context of the appropriate costimulatory signal. These observations have important implications regarding the specificity and utility of the D10.G4.1 assay for the measurement of IL-1 in biologic samples.\r"

Fifteen T cell clones tested 3 days after Ag-specific stimulation proliferated with IL-2 but only five of these responded to IL-4. The remaining 10 also failed to respond to IL-4 in the presence of IL-1 and/or autologous B-LCL. The response of the latter five to IL-4 was independent of IL-2 as shown by the inability of IL-2R mAb to prevent proliferation. In contrast, transferrin R mAb blocked responses to both IL-2 and IL-4. IL-4 responder but not nonresponder clones demonstrated IL-4-enhanced responses to suboptimal concentrations of IL-2 (1 U/ml), but none of the clones showed enhanced responses with 1 U/ml IL-2 plus IL-1, IL-3, IL-5, or granulocyte-macrophage-CSF. IFN-gamma did not enhance or inhibit responses to either IL-2 or IL-4. TNF-alpha did not block proliferation supported by IL-4. In contrast, TNF-alpha did block proliferative responses to IL-2, but only by those clones which were incapable of responding to IL-4. Thus, proliferation of the IL-4-responder clones was not blocked by TNF-alpha when optimal or even supraoptimal concentrations of IL-2 were used as growth factor. Because all T cell clones themselves secreted TNF-alpha after specific stimulation, these results suggest a novel autocrine negative regulatory pathway, whereby IL-4-reactive helper cells would have a selective advantage over IL-4-nonreactive cells during the evolution of an immune response.\r"

The potentiating effect of IFN-gamma on LPS-induced TNF secretion (15.3 +/- 0.7 to 44 +/- 0.6 ng/ml) was also blocked by anti-class II ag mAb (44 +/- 0.6 to 0.3 +/- 0.03 ng/ml). We also report a relationship between interindividual differences in monocyte IL-1 and TNF secretions and the HLA-D-encoded genetic polymorphism. Heterozygotes were, in general, higher secretors of those cytokines than homozygotes. Analysis of these secretions in heterozygotes demonstrated a differential effect of certain haplotype combinations (i.e., DR2-DR4 vs DR2-DR3) that could be arbitrarily characterized as being \"low\" or \"high\" secretors (6,230 +/- 2,950 vs 13,029 +/- 6,541 cpm for IL-1, and 12 +/- 10 vs 25 +/- 15 ng/ml for TNF, p = 0.006 and 0.048). DR-associated Dw subtypes appeared to account for differences within certain haplotype combinations (Dw18 vs Dw19 in DRw13/DR4) (11,227 +/- 3,648 vs 17,166 +/- 3,176 cpm for IL-1, and 13 +/- 9 vs 25 +/- 10 ng/ml for TNF, p = 0.02 and 0.047). Interindividual differences were better explained by differences in LPS sensitivity than by differences in the kinetics of secretion and related not to the secretory process itself but to the rate of cytokine synthesis. Finally, there were no relationships between high secretor genotypes and IDD high risk genotypes. Thus, we conclude that, a) LPS-induced IL-1 and TNF secretions are, at least in part, regulated by class II MHC molecules, b) that HLA-D region-encoded genetic polymorphism accounts for interindividual differences in these secretions, and c) that the HLA-associated risk to develop IDD is not explained by these cytokine secretory differences as previously proposed.\r"

We subsequently selected stably transformed cells that expressed human CR2, as assessed by flow microfluorimetry analysis and immunoprecipitation of 125I-labeled surface membranes using the monoclonal anti-CR2 antibody, HB5. Utilizing flow microfluorimetry analysis, epitopes recognized by anti-CR2 mAb HB5, OKB7, B2, and four other anti-CR2 antibodies were detected on CR2 expressing transfectants but not parental cells. In addition, CR2 expressing transfected cells efficiently formed rosettes with sheep erythrocyte intermediates bearing human C3bi and C3d, but not C4b or C3b, consistent with the known ligand specificity of CR2. CR2 containing transfectants were also demonstrated to specifically bind EBV. Infection with EBV of CR2 expressing L cells and K562 cells resulted in mean expression of Epstein-Barr nuclear Ag (EBNA) at 48 h in 0.35% of CR2 expressing L cells and 3.7% of CR2 expressing K562 cells. Parental L cells and K562 cells did not express EBNA after EBV infection. These results indicate that CR2 alone is sufficient to transfer both C and EBV receptor functions to heterologous cells. In addition, expression of EBNA was found to be significantly higher in human K562 than mouse L cells, both expressing the same recombinant receptor. These results suggest that mechanisms other than CR2 binding lead to inefficient EBV infection and/or EBNA synthesis in mouse fibroblasts.\r"

  ".W": "Ligand binding and cross-linking of TCR/CD3 complex leads to T cell stimulation in immunologic responses. As a prelude to investigating the dynamic interactions of these receptors, we have characterized binding of the mAb OKT3 specific for CD3 on Jurkat cells. The association of both OKT3 and its Fab' fragment is rapid at 4 degrees C, and dissociation of Fab' is also rapid, but dissociation of OKT3 is slow, indicating bivalent binding in this case. Dissociation of OKT3 is substantially accelerated at 37 degrees C if internalization is prevented. From the concentration dependence, the binding of OKT3 at 4 degrees C appears to be very tight whereas binding of the Fab' fragment is weaker and biphasic. Scatchard analysis of the Fab' equilibrium binding data indicates two binding sites with KD values of 5.1 x 10(-9) M and 2.7 x 10(-8) M. The very tight binding of the bivalent antibody may be caused by inter- or intramolecular cross-linking between these sites. If Jurkat cells are warmed to 37 degrees C, there is an energy-dependent increase by about one-third of sites bound by OKT3 or its Fab' fragment over that seen at 4 degrees C. This increase may be related to a receptor recycling process because internalization of a similar number of the bound ligands occurs at similar rates. Other experiments have revealed that OKT3, but not its Fab' fragment, causes the receptor complex to become associated with the detergent-insoluble cytoskeleton, and there are also insoluble intracellular OKT3-binding sites. These cross-linking-induced receptor-cytoskeletal interactions are sensitive to moderate changes in salt concentration that should allow their molecular basis to be investigated.\r"

This binding is specifically inhibited by the saccharides diacetylchitobiose and Man(alpha 1-3)(Man(alpha 1-6]Man-O-methyl and by the high mannose glycopeptides Man5GlcNAc2-R and Man6GlcNAc2-R, but not by Man9GlcNAc2-R. rIL-2 also binds OVA, a glycoprotein which contains approximately 50% high mannose chains at a single glycosylation site, and to yeast mannan. This binding is inhibited by the same battery of saccharides which inhibit the binding to uromodulin. The conclusion that rIL-2 is a lectin is further supported by the observation that the sequence of IL-2 shares 27% homology with a 33-residue sequence of the carbohydrate-binding domain of human mannose-binding protein. The potential physiologic relevance of the carbohydrate binding activity is further elucidated by studies which show that 1) binding of soluble rIL-2 to immobilized uromodulin is enhanced at a pH of 4 to5 in the presence of divalent cations, and 2) neither uromodulin nor the high mannose glycopeptide Man5GlcNAc2Asn blocks the binding of rIL-2 to the IL-2R. Thus the carbohydrate-binding site of rIL-2 is distinct from the cell surface receptor-binding site, and might function preferentially in acidic microenvironments.\r"

Cytokines, produced by PBMC, were tested for their effects on plasminogen activator activity and PGE2 levels of a number of human synovial fibroblast-like cell lines. Evidence was obtained for a human monocyte polypeptide, synovial activator, which can stimulate synovial cell plasminogen activator activity but not PGE2 levels. Purified human rIL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta increased the levels of both products in the supernatants of the synovial cells; TNF-alpha raised the PGE2 levels but raised the plasminogen activator activity only weakly and inconsistently. Synovial activator was further distinguished from IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta (and TNF-alpha) on biochemical, immunologic, and functional criteria. No other purified native or recombinant human cytokine tested was active on the synovial cells when judged by the criteria in question. Synovial activator could therefore be a novel monokine. The differences in the type of response elicited by the various cytokines in the synovial fibroblast-like cells could have implications for the understanding of the cellular interactions occurring in rheumatoid lesions.\r"

Secreted Ig reacted strongly with viral capsid proteins VP1 and VP2 and had neutralizing activity. They reacted also with two nonviral white matter components which were present only in infected animals. Therefore, it is likely that Igs secreted at the site of infection play a role in limiting virus spread.

The development of such an in vitro migration assay was based on the ability of cells to migrate across polycarbonate filters in Boyden chambers. In the present paper, by using the same strategy, we studied murine bone marrow cells capable of migrating in vitro toward IT45-R1 conditioned medium. The responding cells were shown to represent a minor bone marrow subpopulation characterized by a low capacity to incorporate tritiated thymidine in vitro (less than 10% of control). Moreover, this cell subset was considerably impoverished with respect to granulocyte-macrophage CFU (less than 7% of control) and pluripotent hemopoietic stem cells (less than 12% of control). Potential generation of T cells of donor-type in the lymphoid organs of irradiated recipients was measured by using C57BL/Ka Thy-1.1 and Thy-1.2 congenic mice. Thy-1.1 irradiated mice were injected intrathymically or intravenously with the selectively migrated cell subset of Thy-1.2 donor-type bone marrow cells. The use of an i.v. transfer route allowed us to show that these cells possess thymus-homing and colonization abilities. In a time-course study after intrathymic cell transfer, these migrated cells were able to generate Thy-1.2+ donor-type thymocytes represented by all cortical and medullary cell subsets in a single wave of repopulation from day 20 to day 30 after transfer, with a peak around days 23 to 25. The degree of repopulation closely resembled that seen with unfractionated bone marrow cells in terms of absolute numbers of donor cells per thymus (82% of control, 22 x 10(6) Thy-1.2+ cells) as well as in percent donor cells per thymus (105% of control). Thy-1.2+ cells were also detected in the lymph nodes and the spleens of reconstituted recipient mice. Taken together, these results support the idea that the supernatant of the established thymic epithelium IT45-R1 induces the migration of a murine bone marrow subset that contains hemopoietic stem cells already committed to the lymphoid lineage (i.e., pre-T cells).\r"

The data showed that leaky scid mice are more frequent than is evident from serum Ig analysis and that the incidence of detectable B and T cells increases with age. IgM+ B220+ cells were not detectable in young adult mice (3 mo old), but in old mice (greater than or equal to 1 yr old) they were routinely present in the peritoneal cavity though not in the spleen. Striking differences in the representation of T cell subsets were seen in the thymus of these two age groups. Most young adult mice contained CD3- populations of CD4/CD8 double positive cells, and in some cases, CD4 or CD8 single positive cells as well. By contrast, identifiable T lineage cells in old mice were all CD3+ and predominantly single positive for CD4 or CD8. Detectable peripheral T cell populations numbered less than 10(5) cells, and the representation of T subset markers (CD4, CD8) varied widely among individual mice; further, Southern blot analysis of TCR gene rearrangements in the DNA of polyclonally stimulated lymphoid cultures from these mice showed very restricted heterogeneity relative to that of cultures from normal mice. We conclude that most leaky mice contain very few T cell clones.\r"

Trypsin-digested chicken ovalbumin (OVA-TD) fragments were used as the model Ag. The results demonstrate the peptides within OVA-TD, when injected into C57BL/6 mice, could prime T cells which lysed H-2b Ia-EL4 target cells in an OVA-TD-specific manner. In contrast to priming with OVA-TD, immunization of mice with intact OVA did not lead to generation of CTL against OVA-TD or OVA. Furthermore, target cells sensitized with intact OVA failed to be recognized by OVA-peptide-specific CTL indicating that the target cells serving as APC were unable to generate the relevant peptide determinants recognized by the T cells. These results support the idea that the processing pathway within APC for class I-restricted T cells may differ from that used for class II-restricted T cells. Using OVA-TD-specific CTL clones (phenotypically Thy 1+, CD8+, CD4-, Pgp-1+) isolated from primed animals to screen OVA-TD fractions separated by HPLC, two T cell peptide determinants were identified corresponding to OVA sequences 111-122 and 370-381. Both determinants were recognized by CTL clones in the context of the H-2Db molecule.\r"

  ".W": "Crystallographic studies of the HLA-A2 molecule have led to the assignment of a putative peptide binding site that consists of a groove with a beta-pleated sheet floor bordered by two alpha-helices. A CTL-defined variant of HLA-A2, termed HLA-A2.2F, differs from the common A2.1 molecule by three amino acids: a Leu to Trp substitution at position 156 in the alpha-2 helix, a Val to Leu substitution at position 95 in the beta-sheet floor of the groove, and a Gln to Arg substitution at position 43 in a loop outside of the groove. Another HLA-A2 variant, termed CLA, has a single Phe to Tyr substitution at position 9 that is sterically located adjacent to position 95 in the beta-sheet floor of the groove. We have determined which of the amino acid substitutions at positions 9, 43, 95, or 156 could individually affect recognition by panels of A2.1 allospecific and A2.1-restricted influenza viral matrix peptide-specific CTL lines, using a panel of site-directed mutants and CLA. Recognition by allospecific CTL lines was generally unaffected by any one of the amino acid substitutions, but was eliminated by the double substitution at positions 95 and 156. Allorecognition by some CTL lines was eliminated by a single substitution at position 9 or 95. In contrast, recognition by A2.1-restricted matrix peptide specific CTL was totally eliminated by a single substitution at position 9 or 156. The substitution at position 43 in a loop away from the peptide binding groove had no effect on allorecognition or matrix peptide recognition. These results indicate that amino acid residues in the floor or alpha-2 helical wall of the peptide binding groove of the HLA-A2 molecule can differentially affect allorecognition and viral peptide recognition.\r"

The clones were generated by culturing purified populations of CD3+CD4-CD8- and CD3+CD4+CD8+ T cells at limiting dilution (0.3 cell/well) in the presence of PHA, rIL-2, and irradiated PBMC as feeders. Twelve CD3+CD4-CD8- and 5 CD3+CD4+CD8+ clones were generated. Clonality was documented by analyzing TCR gamma- and beta-chain rearrangement patterns. All CD3+CD4-CD8- clones were stained by the TCR-delta 1 mAb that identifies a framework epitope of the TCR delta-chain, but not by mAb WT31 that identifies the TCR-alpha beta on mature T cells. In contrast, the CD3+CD4+CD8+ clones were all stained by WT31 and not by TCR-delta 1. All 17 clones were screened for various functional activities. Each secreted IL-2, IFN-gamma, and lymphotoxin/TNF-like factors when stimulated with immobilized mAb to CD3 (64.1), albeit in varying quantities. These clones secreted far less IL-2 and IFN-gamma than CD3+CD4+CD8- or CD3+CD4-CD8+ alpha beta expressing clones, but comparable amounts of lymphotoxin/TNF. All clones also functioned as MHC-unrestricted cytotoxic cells. This activity was comparable to that mediated by the CD3+CD4+CD8- or CD3+CD4-CD8+ alpha beta clones. Nine of 12 CD3+CD4-CD8- and 4 of 5 CD3+CD4+CD8+ clones were able to support B cell differentiation when activated by immobilized anti-CD3, but usually not as effectively as the CD3+CD4+CD8- or CD3+CD4-CD8+ alpha beta clones. The differences in the functional capabilities of the various clones could not be accounted for by alterations in the signaling capacity of the CD3 molecular complex as mAb to CD3 induced comparable increases in intracellular free calcium in each clone examined. When clones were stimulated with PWM, each suppressed B cell differentiation supported by mitomycin C-treated fresh CD4+ T lymphocytes. Suppression was dependent on the number of clone cells added to culture, but could be observed with as few as 12,500 cells per microtiter well. Phenotypic analysis of the clones revealed that all expressed CD29, CD11b, and the NKH1 surface Ag. These results demonstrate that the CD3+CD4-CD8- and CD3+CD4+CD8+ T cell clones exhibit many of the functional characteristics of mature T cells, although they produce IL-2 and IFN-gamma and provide help for B cell differentiation less effectively than CD3+CD4+CD8- and CD3+CD4-CD8+ alpha beta T cell clones.\r"

  ".W": "We used two human cell lines, NK-like YT-C3 and an EBV-containing B cell line, 3B6, as models to study the receptor(s) for IL-1. Two distinct types of saturable binding sites were found on both cell lines at 37 degrees C. Between 1 pM and 100 pM of 125I-IL-1-alpha concentration, saturable binding sites were detected on the YT-C3 cells with a K of 4 x 10(-11) M. The K found for the IL-1-alpha binding sites on 3B6 cells was 7.5 x 10(-11) M. An additional binding curve was detected above 100 pM on YT-C3 cells with a K of 7 x 10(-9) M and on 3B6 cells with a K of 5 x 10(-9) M. Scatchard plot analysis revealed 600 sites/cell with high affinity binding and 7000 sites/cell with low affinity for YT-C3 cells and 300 sites/cell with high affinity binding and 6000 sites/cell with low affinity for 3B6 cells. At 37 degrees C, the internalization of 125I-labeled IL-1 occurred via both high and low affinity IL-1R on both YT-C3 and 3B6 cells, whereas the rates of internalization for high affinity binding sites on YT-C3 cells were predominant in comparison to that of low affinity binding sites. In chemical cross-linking studies of 125I-IL-1-alpha to 3B6 and YT-C3 cells, two protein bands were immunoprecipitated with Mr around 85 to 90 kDa leading to an estimation of the Mr of the IL-1R around 68 to 72 kDa. In similar experiments, the Mr found for the IL-1R expressed on the murine T cell line EL4 was slightly higher (around 80 kDa). Whether these distinct affinity binding sites are shared by a single molecule or by various chains remains to be elucidated.\r"

We have analyzed the nature of membrane IL-1 in stimulated murine macrophages. We show that it consists of an IL-1 alpha precursor bound to the plasma membrane via a lectin-like interaction that is specifically dissociated with D-mannose. The dissociated IL-1 was detected as both a biological activity and, by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE, as a 33 kDa IL-1 alpha precursor. Treatment of macrophages with D-mannose before fixation depleted detectable IL-1 biological activity associated with the membrane. Pro-IL-1 alpha was glycosylated in these cells, as shown by incorporation of D-[14C]mannose; thus it is likely that a cell surface lectin binds pro-IL-1 via these carbohydrate residues. In addition to anchoring IL-1 precursor to the plasma membrane, this lectin-like interaction may also be important in the overall regulation of IL-1 release.\r"

We assessed the interaction of TNF with the lipid bilayer membrane system, liposomes, and the effects of membrane association on TNF bioactivity. High levels of TNF can be encapsulated within liposomes. At neutral pH, TNF binds to the surface of preformed liposomes (liposome-associated TNF), but does not partition into the lipid bilayer. TNF appears to bind to negatively charged phospholipid head groups of the outer membrane leaflet. Free TNF, liposome-associated TNF, and liposome-encapsulated TNF display comparable abilities to activate human peripheral blood monocytes and to lyse tumor cells. However, liposome-encapsulated TNF, as well as TNF bound to the outer surface of preformed liposomes, retains bioactivity in the presence of anti-TNF antibodies that neutralize free TNF. The interaction of liposomal TNF with cell surface TNF receptors thus appears to be preserved in the presence of neutralizing antibodies.\r"

  ".W": "MHC nonrestricted cytotoxic cells play an important role in the killing of tumor cells in vitro and potentially in vivo. The activity of these cells is regulated by several cytokines such as IL-2 and IFN. In the present study we provide first evidence that IL-6 significantly augments the cytotoxic activity of human NK cells. IL-6 is produced by many different cells and is also known as IFN-beta 2, B cell stimulatory factor 2, hybridoma growth factor, hepatocyte-stimulating factor, and 26 kDa protein. IL-6 stimulates the activity of human CD3- NK cells but not that of CD3+ non-MHC-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes. As is the case with IL-2, the IL-6-mediated augmented cytotoxicity was a result of a more efficient lysis, but was not caused by an increased effector to target cell binding. Moreover, the effect of IL-6 on NK cell activity was blocked by a mAb directed against IL-2, and IL-6 itself was found to be a potent inducer of IL-2 production in cultured human PBMC. Thus it may be concluded that IL-6 enhances the cytotoxic activity of NK cells via IL-2. This newly recognized property of IL-6, which is produced by almost any cell, may be of importance in host defense against microbes and malignancies and therefore could contribute to improve the adoptive immunotherapy by using lymphokine-activated killer cells.\r"

  ".U": "89309802\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of IL-7 on the in vitro growth and differentiation of day 12 to 14 murine fetal thymocytes were examined in three culture systems. In single cell suspension cultures, IL-7 and IL-2 induced a DNA synthetic response in a short term (1 day) assay, but neither cytokine supported continued cell growth. In conventional fetal thymus organ cultures, the addition of exogenous IL-7 resulted in a twofold increase in cell number over that which normally develops in unsupplemented fetal thymus organ cultures during a 7-day period. The most striking effects of IL-7 were noted in lobe submersion cultures (LSC), a system in which thymocyte growth was totally dependent on the addition of exogenous cytokine. Cells proliferated for a period of approximately 2 wk in IL-7, and cell viability could be maintained even longer. A high percentage of cells recovered after 7 to 14 days from IL-7-supplemented LSC resembled the earliest detectable fetal thymocytes with regard to cell surface markers: they expressed Pgp-1, lacked CD4, CD8, and CD3 and many expressed the IL-2R. These results suggest that IL-7 promotes the growth of cells that occur early in the T cell lineage. Cell populations recovered from LSC supplemented with IL-7 and IL-2 exhibited differential expression of some surface markers, particularly CD3 and NK1.1. In addition, cells from LSC supplemented with IL-7 were found to proliferate upon subsequent exposure to IL-2, but cells from LSC containing exogenous IL-2 were no longer responsive to IL-7. These results imply that IL-7 and IL-2 may act at different stages of thymocyte differentiation. Together with previous observations of IL-7-specific mRNA expression in the thymus, this study provides evidence highly suggestive of a pivotal role for IL-7 in T cell development.\r"

A novel H-2 class I, \"alloantigen\"-like glycoprotein was immunoprecipitated and isolated from all the tumor cell lines using an H-2Dd-specific mAb 35-5-8. The novel Ag was also recognized in vitro by anti-H-2Dd-specific CTL. In addition, DNA from all the thymomas, but not the DNA from normal adult AKR thymic cells showed a transcribed gene detectable with an H-2Dd-specific oligonucleotide probe. The molecular profile of the novel antigen was further studied by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and analyzed by a computer based image analyzer system and reverse-phase HPLC tryptic peptide mapping. Its molecular pattern was different from the syngeneic H-2Kk, H-2Dk, and the allogeneic H-2Dd gene products. The two-dimensional gel pattern of the novel H-2 class I molecule had a different overall structure reflected in isoelectric point, number, and distribution of polypeptide spots. The tryptic peptide map analysis showed six peaks exclusively identified with the novel Ag. The calculated degree of homology with the corresponding H-2Dd, H-Dk, and H-Kk peptides was 41, 56, and 51%, respectively. In addition, an unusual cell surface distribution of the novel Ag was observed in most of the leukemic lines. The removal of sialic acid residues by neuraminidase treatment facilitated the detection of the allodeterminants by anti-H-2Dd-specific mAb and CTL. Furthermore, we showed that in one AKR tumor line, 424, there is a close association of the novel Ag with the syngeneic class I molecules. Prior preclearance of the syngeneic class I molecules revealed the presence of the H-2Dd-like allospecificity. The genetic and molecular relationship between the expression of this novel class I-like glycoprotein and the recently sequenced Q5 gene is under current investigation.\r"

In most instances these substitutions had little or no effect, suggesting that neither alpha-helical nor beta-sheet regular structures may be strictly required for productive interaction with MHC molecules. Some of the same substitutions were also found to have no effect on the capacity of the peptide to stimulate OVA 323-336 specific T cell hybridomas, suggesting that regular structures such as alpha-helices or beta-sheets may not be strictly required for T cell stimulation, either. Second, we introduced, within the OVA 323-336 molecule, structural modifications predicted to alter its dipole characteristics and stabilize helical structures. No improvement of the IAd binding capacity was detected following these structural alterations. Surprisingly, some but not others of these analogs displayed increased antigenicity for OVA 323-336 specific T cell hybridomas. Third, a panel of analogs of OVA 323-336 were synthesized in which the crucial IAd binding core region was linked to non-native sequences of differing conformational propensities. When 22 such analogs were tested for IAd binding, it was found that these non-native sequences could drastically influence the binding capacity, but no correlation was found between their effect and their alpha-helical, beta-sheet, or beta-turn conformational propensity as calculated by the Chou and Fasman algorithm. In summary, all the data presented herein suggest that, at least in the case of OVA 323-336 and IAd, the propensity of the antigen molecule to form secondary structures such as alpha-helices, beta-sheets, or beta-turns does not correlate with its capacity to bind MHC molecules.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated signaling mechanisms that may underlie the T cell mitogenic properties of the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin. Ionomycin induces highly purified resting human T cells to proliferate in the presence of monocytes with accompanying IL-2R expression and IL-2 synthesis. Treatment of T cells with ionomycin triggers the hydrolysis of phosphoinositides, as evidenced by the accumulation of the hydrolytic by-products phosphatidic acid and inositol phosphates. Ionomycin also induces the activation of protein kinase C (PKC), as demonstrated by the auto-phosphorylation of PKC and the phosphorylation of the PKC target proteins CD4 and CD8. Ionomycin synergizes with PMA in enhancing the activation of PKC. It is concluded that, in addition to its putative activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent signaling pathways, ionomycin induces the hydrolysis of phosphoinositides and the activation of PKC in human T cells. The synergy of ionomycin with phorbol esters in triggering T cell activation may relate, at least in part, to enhanced activation of PKC.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies from our laboratory indicated that human NK activity against HSV-infected fibroblasts (HSV-Fs) but not K562 targets was sensitive to treatment with anti-HLA-DR plus C. In the current study, we have selected Leu-11a+ (CD-16) cells by fluorescence activated cell sorting and found that although Leu-11a enriched populations lysed K562 targets in 14-h 51Cr-release assays, they were unable to kill HSV-Fs targets unless a Leu-11a-depleted population was added back to the effectors or unless known activators of NK cells (IFN-alpha or IL-2) were added to the assays. In contrast, Leu-11a-enriched populations were able to mediate ADCC against HSV-Fs in the presence of sera from HSV-seropositive individuals without the requirement for accessory cells. We have begun preliminary characterization of the accessory cells which allow lysis of HSV-Fs by NK cells: they are HLA-DR+ cells which enrich in the light density fractions of Metrizamide density gradients. They need be present in very small numbers for lysis to take place and are not MHC restricted in that heterologous add-backs between anti-HLA-DR plus C and anti-Leu-11b plus C-treated populations are capable of target cell lysis at levels similar to those achieved with the autologous add-backs. Further, the levels of lysis in heterologous add-back experiments reflected the lytic potential of the effector rather than the accessory cell donor. Finally, although the requirement for accessory cells for NK lysis has been demonstrated for fibroblasts infected with HSV-1, CMV, and VZV, lysis of HSV-infected Raji lymphoblastoid cells is relatively accessory-cell independent, indicating that the requirement for accessory cells for lysis by NK cells is not a property of all herpesvirus-infected targets.\r"

  ".W": "In an attempt to understand the mechanisms of immunodeficiency induced by human T lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I), HSV-specific CD4+ human multifunctional T cell clones were infected with HTLV-I in vitro. Early after HTLV-I infection, when their growth was still IL-2-dependent, clones were found to have almost completely lost their cytotoxic activity. At that time, their HSV-Ag-induced proliferative response and helper function for anti-HSV antibody production by B cells were only partially impaired. After this initial phase, the HTLV-I-infected clone became IL-2-independent, and the helper function was also completely lost. IL-2-dependent HTLV-I-infected clones showed degrees of proliferative response and elevation of intracellular free Ca2+ concentration induced by anti-CD3 mAb equivalent to those of HTLV-I-uninfected clones. On the other hand, during the IL-2-independent stage, expression of CD3-TCR complex on the cell surface was markedly decreased, and no significant elevation of intracellular free Ca2+ concentration was detected in response to anti-CD3 mAb. These data indicated that the loss of cytotoxic activity of HSV-specific T cell clones observed early after HTLV-I infection was not the result of impaired antigen recognition via the CD3-TCR complex, but might be due to dysfunction in the effector phase. On the other hand, the dysfunction of helper activity found late after HTLV-I infection might have mainly occurred in the recognition phase due to the decreased expression of CD3-TCR complex. The present data appear to suggest certain aspects of the pathogenesis of the immunodeficiency occurring in HTLV-I infection.\r"

  ".W": "Approximately 20 to 50% individuals in every race are untypable by human alloantisera for at least one allele of HLA-C locus and the surface expression of HLA-C locus Ag in such an individual (HLA-C blank Ag) remains unknown. To investigate the structure and the surface expression of HLA-C blank Ag, two genes (Cb-1 and Cb-2) encoding HLA-C blank Ag were cloned and their primary structures were determined and compared with other HLA-C locus genes. The similarity of amino acids between Cb-1 and Cw1 was the highest among HLA-C locus genes previously published. Five amino acid substitutions between these molecules were shown to be located on the beta-strand of alpha 1 and alpha 2 domains, suggesting that they might change the conformational allodeterminants on the alpha-helical region of Cw1 which were recognized by antibodies. On the other hand, Cb-2 was the closest to Cw2.2. Six of nine amino acid substitutions between these molecules were observed on alpha 1 and alpha 2 domains, whereas three other substitutions were located on the leader peptide, the alpha 3 domain and the transmembrane. Two substitutions (residues 73 and 163) of the alpha-helical region of the alpha 1 and alpha 2 domains and one (residue 16) of exposed loop may make new allodeterminants which are not recognized by anti-Cw2 sera as well as other alloantisera. The surface expression of these genes was examined on transfected mouse L cells and human B cell line. Both gene products were expressed stably on the surface of these cells. These results suggest that HLA-C blank Ag are most probably expressed on cells in HLA-C blank individuals and that the primary structures of these Ag, which were not detectable by the available alloantisera, may be incapable of generating corresponding alloantibodies.\r"

A similar structure is recognized by the rat mAbs YE1/32 and YE1/48. We isolated a cDNA clone encoding the antigen recognized by mAb A1 by immunoselection of a cDNA library in the eukaryotic expression vector CDM8. COS 7.2 cells transfected with this cDNA clone expressed an mAb A1-reactive 85 kDa disulfide-linked dimer with 44 kDa subunits, which was also reactive with the mAbs YE1/32 and YE1/48. The A1 gene displayed extensive strain polymorphism, underwent no rearrangement in EL-4, and hybridized with multiple restriction fragments, suggesting that it is a member of a multi-gene family. The deduced polypeptide contained 262 residues with an m.w. of 30,648, multiple cysteines, and three potential N-linked glycosylation sites, consistent with previous observations. In contrast to most integral membrane proteins, the putative A1 protein had features of a type II integral membrane protein structure, with its carboxyl terminus exposed extracellularly and an intracytoplasmic amino terminus. There was significant homology with several type II integral membrane proteins, including the human and chicken asialoglycoprotein receptors, and especially the human low affinity Fc epsilon receptor, in the putative extracellular domains of these proteins. This analysis suggested that the A1 gene belongs to a novel supergene family of type II integral membrane proteins and suggested that the A1 protein itself may be involved in binding a soluble ligand such as carbohydrates or immunoglobulin.\r"

Ag used for immunization were SRBC, horse RBC, OVA, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, or CFA. Ag-draining LN, in the acute phase of the Ir, did not contain detectable LAK effector activity, nor an enhanced NK activity. After culture for 3 to 5 days in the absence of exogenously added IL-2, immunized LN cells developed a spontaneous LAK-like cytotoxicity. This activity represented a substantial fraction of the IL-2-generated LAK cytolysis and was mediated by a Thy-1+ cell population phenotypically indistinct from IL-2-induced LAK. Inclusion (on day 0 of culture) of antibodies to IL-2, IL-2R, IL-4, IL-6, IFN-gamma, or TNF suggests a marginal involvement of IL-2 and IL-4 in the generation of this response. LAK, induced in vitro by exogenously added IL-2, developed earlier in LN cells immunized with particle Ag (SRBC, horse RBC, and CFA), but not with protein Ag (OVA and keyhole limpet hemocyanin). This effect was not mediated by endogenous IL-4. During further culture time in the presence of a saturating IL-2 concentration, similar levels of LAK activity were generated in naive and immunized LN cells. This agrees with the similar or slightly higher LAK precursor frequencies in immunized versus naive LN as assessed by limiting dilution experiments. Considering the 2.7-fold to 18-fold increase in cell content of the immunized LN, due to a recruitment and expansion of Ag-reactive B and T lymphocytes, a de novo generation of LAK precursors at the site of the Ir, and resulting from the Ir, must be assumed. In conclusion, our results suggest an interrelation between immune reactivity and LAK responses.\r"

To determine the effects of interleukin 1 beta on protein synthesis, the molecular patterns of radiolabeled cell extracts of interleukin 1 beta-treated and nontreated keratinocytes were compared using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

  ".W": "To investigate the relationship between activation of the c-myc proto-oncogene and the controls of cellular growth and differentiation of epidermal cells, a transcriptionally activated c-myc gene (DM-myc) was introduced into the established murine keratinocytes, BALB/MK. Exponential growth rates of myc-transfectants were not significantly different from that of parental BALB/MK cells. C-myc RNA transcripts were not detectable in confluent, mitogen-deprived cultures of parental BALB/MK cells, whereas four out of five clones expressed elevated levels of myc mRNA under these conditions. All of the cell lines, however, displayed density-dependent growth arrest in the G0/1 phase of the cell cycle. Maximal stimulation of quiescent BALB/MK cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF) caused a 70- to 100-fold increase of [methyl-3H]-thymidine incorporation into DNA. In the four subclones that expressed the myc gene, the peak thymidine incorporation into DNA was significantly higher than in BALB/MK cells, ranging from 340- to 650-fold control levels. This increased sensitivity to EGF was not due to autocrine mitogenic activity or to a change of EGF binding. Type beta transforming growth factor strongly inhibited the EGF-induced DNA synthesis in BALB/MK cultures as well as in each of the five transfectants (IC50 4-40 pM). Furthermore, both BALB/MK cells and the transfected subclones could be induced to form cornified cell envelopes by increasing the extracellular concentration of calcium. Thus, the constitutive expression of c-myc in BALB/MK appears to affect predominantly the reinitiation of DNA synthesis by EGF.\r"

  ".W": "The association between erythema multiforme (EM) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection has long been appreciated, although the exact role which HSV may play in the pathogenesis of this herpes-associated EM (HAEM), is unknown. Previous studies have suggested, but not definitively demonstrated, the presence of HSV in lesions of HAEM. The presence of HSV would support the hypothesis that an immune-mediated response directed against HSV-specific antigens in the skin is central to lesion development in HAEM. The purpose of this study was to examine lesions of EM for the presence of HSV DNA by using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In addition, in situ hybridization using an HSV-specific RNA probe was performed to further localize the HSV nucleic acids within the skin. DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens of cutaneous lesions of HAEM and also from EM for which no precipitating factor could be documented, otherwise known as idiopathic EM (IPEM). DNA from lesions of bullous pemphigoid served as a negative control. Using PCR to specifically amplify HSV sequences which might be present, and then performing Southern analysis, we demonstrated HSV DNA in 9/13 HAEM and 6/9 IPEM biopsies. No HSV was detected in six lesions of bullous pemphigoid. In situ hybridization of three cutaneous HAEM lesions using an 35S-labeled HSV-specific RNA probe localized the HSV nucleic acids predominantly to the epidermis. Three biopsies of chronic dermatitis, used as negative controls, did not demonstrate this specific hybridization. These findings confirm the presence of HSV in lesions of HAEM and are consistent with the concept of an HSV-specific immune-mediated pathogenesis for this disease. In addition, most cases of IPEM appear to be herpes associated despite the absence of clinically apparent HSV infection.\r"

This study extends the analysis of this IL-2-like material to its reactivity with eight antibodies raised against natural IL-2, rec-IL-2 or IL-2 peptides. Four among them were found to react with the granular epidermal layer as well as with a simian virus 40 (SV40) transformed human keratinocyte cell line. Each of these four antibodies gave similar labeling patterns, although with different intensities, and competitively inhibited each other. Analysis at the messenger RNA level in epidermal cells and SVK 14 also indicated that this material is very likely different from IL-2. From the knowledge, for some of these antibodies, of the amino-acid regions they recognize on the IL-2 molecule, it is inferred that the skin antigen shares with IL-2 at least two overlapping epitopes located in the 33-54 amino-acid region of IL-2, a region that has been shown to be involved in the binding of IL-2 to the IL-2-receptor (IL-2-R) 55 kD chain. Indeed, a purified recombinant soluble species of this IL-2-R is shown in this study to bind specifically to the IL-2-like skin material. As far as IL-2-R bearing cells are found in normal epidermis (Langerhans cells) and as important infiltrates of IL-2-R positive T lymphocytes are often encountered in cutaneous diseases, a potential role for this IL-2-like material in skin immunophysiopathology is suggested.\r"

The authors studied 20 consecutive asymptomatic familial hypercholesterolaemic patients and an age- and sex-matched control group of consecutive normolipidaemic and asymptomatic patients admitted to the hospital for elective non-vascular surgery. The patients and the controls were studied non-invasively by measuring the ankle-arm systolic blood pressure ratio at rest. Peripheral atherosclerosis was common in this study population in contrast to the control group: an abnormal (less than 0.97) pressure ratio was found in 13 patients (65%) in the study group but in only one person in the control group. Eight out of 20 patients had coronary artery disease, and seven of them had an asymptomatic concomitant peripheral artery disease. Neither the classical risk factors, i.e. age, smoking, obesity, hypertension and glucose intolerance, nor serum lipid or lipoprotein status or the parameters of cholesterol metabolism correlated with peripheral atherosclerosis. It is concluded that atherosclerosis in familial hypercholesterolaemia is a multilevel disease that frequently affects also the peripheral arteries.\r"

The predictive accuracy of the questionnaire in the non-COPD and COPD group was 0.41 and 0.56, respectively. Prevalence rates of benign oesophageal disease in the non-COPD and the COPD groups were 34.5% (20-49%) and 44.5% (34-55%) respectively (P less than 0.001).

  ".W": "One hundred and thirty-three homosexual men seropositive for the antibody against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were enrolled in a prospective study in 1984-85. The 3-year cumulative incidences of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and AIDS-related conditions, by life-table analyses, were 18% and 34%. The cumulative incidence of immune deficiency defined as CD4 lymphocytes less than 0.5 x 10(9) l-1 was 70% at 3 years. Absence of antibodies to p24 antigen, HIV antigenaemia, CD4 lymphocytes less than 0.3 x 10 l-1 and elevated serum level of IgA were significantly associated with the development of AIDS. There was no association between disease progression and persistent generalized lymphadenopathy. When adjusted to the probable year of infection, these results are in accordance with previous cohort studies. It is concluded that most, or all, subjects seropositive for HIV will develop progressive loss of CD4 lymphocytes followed by clinical signs of immune deficiency, and that differences among previous cohorts with respect to disease progression are probably due to differences in the duration of infection.\r"

  ".W": "Parenteral treatment with interleukin-2 (IL-2) is effective against certain advanced cancers outside the central nervous system. Prior to commencement of Phase II trials in patients with brain tumors, the neurological and neuroradiological features of 10 patients treated with intravenous administration of repeated doses of IL-2 were studied. Three patients had malignant gliomas, and seven patients had extracranial cancer without evidence of intracranial metastasis. All were treated with intravenous doses of 10(5) U/kg three times daily for up to 5 days. The patients with gliomas received cranial computerized axial tomography (CT) scans before IL-2 therapy was initiated and during the later stages of treatment. The patients with extracranial cancer underwent T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging before and later during therapy. After two to 11 doses of IL-2, the patients with gliomas had marked neurological deterioration that was associated with a mild to marked increase in peritumoral edema and mass effect visible on CT scans. With cessation of treatment and appropriate supportive care, all returned to their pretreatment state. The patients with extracranial cancer were either neurologically unchanged or underwent minor transient changes in mental status (lethargy and confusion). In these patients, the MR signal intensity was quantified and compared in eight anatomic regions of interest. In six of the seven patients, there were increases in gray and white matter signal intensity consistent with increased cerebral water content. The percentage changes (means +/- standard error of the means) were 12.6% +/- 7.3% in the gray matter and 17.0% +/- 6.2% in the white matter. This study demonstrates that treatment with a high parenteral dose of IL-2 is not tolerated by patients with gliomas due to increased cerebral edema. In patients with extracranial cancer but no brain disease, parenteral IL-2 induces an increase in the cerebral water content of both gray and white matter.\r"

Irregularity in outline of the contrast material, bone contour-contrast material gaps, evidence of adherent discs and/or small joint compartments indicated synovial hyperplasia/pannus formation in 15 joints. Six of these (four with normal disc position) showed perforation between the joint compartments. In those with normal disc position the perforation seemed to occur in the central portion. Ten of the 15 joints had normal disc position; the remaining five had anterior disc displacement without reduction. One joint showed only disc displacement. Most joints with bone abnormalities (12 of 14) showed arthrographic signs of rheumatic involvement. Such signs were also observed in two of the six joints with no bone abnormalities, indicating the value of arthrography in the early diagnosis of patients with rheumatic disease and TMJ problems.\r"

The inhibitor does not appear to bind to IL-2 or the IL-2 receptor. This inhibition can be reversed with IL-2 but not interleukin 1. These observations may apply to the defects in IL-2 production and response demonstrable in rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune disorders.\r"

Frequency of these increased up to 100.0, 79.3 and 64.4%, respectively, through the course of the disease. Peripheral arthritis and/or enthesopathy occurred in 89.4 and 63.1% of juveniles and 37.5 and 27.5% of adults, respectively, while lumbar pain and/or stiffness occurred in 23.4% of the former and 82.5% of the latter during the first year of disease. Additional findings were high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anemia and hypergammaglobulinemia. Uveitis was the commonest extraarticular manifestation occurring in 20.6%. Our data suggest that the clinical pattern of AS in our patients was influenced by both age at onset and sex distribution of the disease.\r"

Back complaints were rarely seen in JRA and, furthermore, sacroiliitis of the AS type nerve occurring in this group. There were no significant differences between the group with seronegative enthesopathy and arthropathy and juvenile AS, either at onset or through the years. Clinical and radiographic assessment of axial involvement in children at risk should include a careful analysis of symptoms, periodical measurements of the spinal flexion and, starting from the 3rd year, radiographs of the pelvis.\r"

Because the 6R isomer persists at high concentrations in plasma for prolonged periods after iv leucovorin administration (J Clin Oncol 4:685-696, 1986), we have examined it to ascertain whether the 6R isomer could interfere with the cellular effects of the 6S isomer. The 6R compound had a poorer uptake into human CCRF-CEM lymphoblastic cells than the 6S compound, but the 6R compound could competitively inhibit the uptake of the natural isomer as determined in defined buffers. However, the 6R compound failed to interfere with cell growth support and enhancement of 5-fluorouracil cytotoxicity by the 6S isomer in CCRF-CEM cells in tissue culture experiments at concentrations up to 1 mM. Thus, the unnatural isomer of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate present in leucovorin preparations seems unlikely to have clinically relevant consequences.\r"

However, documentation of pregnancies in this patient group has been limited. Deoxyribonucleic acid flow cytometry has been shown to be a reproducible quantitative method with which to evaluate spermatogenesis. We assessed the ability of deoxyribonucleic acid flow cytometry on testicular aspirates to predict the quality of sperm production in 13 men undergoing electroejaculation. Semen analysis was performed on antegrade and retrograde specimens. Deoxyribonucleic acid histograms from testicular aspirates were evaluated for the relative proportions of haploid, diploid and tetraploid cells. These ratios were compared to the means reported for our own series of 25 patients who at vasovasostomy had sperm intraoperatively and to the similar figures from a group of 10 accident victims. Five patients had normal testicular ploidy compartments defined as within 2 standard deviations from control means. Of the 5 patients 4 had normal sperm counts and motilities (30 per cent or greater). Two patients have contributed sperm for artificial insemination; 1 has resulted in pregnancy. Three patients had moderately abnormal (2 to 4 standard deviations) testicular ploidy classes. These patients had adequate sperm counts but low motilities (5 per cent or less). Of the 5 patients with markedly abnormal (greater than 4 standard deviations) histograms 4 remained azoospermic despite repeated attempts at electroejaculation. Our data support the use of deoxyribonucleic acid flow cytometry on testicular aspirates as a predictor of which patients might succeed and those who are unlikely to succeed in an electroejaculation program.\r"

In 8 patients (42 per cent) complete success was achieved. These patients have regained reservoir function, are completely dry and void with electrical stimulation. The voiding is synchronous, with low voiding pressure and low residual urine volumes. Ten patients qualify as having partial success. They have regained reservoir function and are dry. One patient voids partially with stimulation, 5 depend on intermittent self-catheterization, 1 regained reservoir function and received an artificial sphincter, and 3 are catheter-dependent (these 3 all had been incontinent preoperatively despite continuous catheter drainage). The remaining patient entered the program long after a cerebrovascular accident and treatment has failed owing to poor selection. The stimulation parameters, once stabilized, did not need to be increased, and neither the surgical manipulation of the sacral roots nor the electrode implantation resulted in further neural loss in any patient.\r"

The hybrid monoclonal antibodies exhibit bimolecular specificity towards both antigenic determinants on the prostate carcinoma cell surface as well as toxin or toxic moieties (ricin A chain and pokeweed antiviral protein). These hybrid antibodies, when bound univalently to their cognate toxin, constitute the primary reagents responsible for selective in vitro prostate carcinoma cell kill; oncolytic impact is achieved by binding of the hybrid antibody-toxin complex (primary hybrid immunotoxin) to a prostate carcinoma cell surface-expressed antigen by the remaining univalent binding site of the hybrid antibody, allowing access of the toxin to the cytosol by internalization of the hybrid antibody-toxin complex. Internalization by endocytosis of a hybrid antibody-toxic subunit has been strikingly enhanced by the use of secondary monoclonal antibody reagents alone or in conjunction with other biomodifier reagents. For example, use of a second monoclonal antibody specific for ricin A chain to which ricin B chain (binding subunit) is chemically coupled results in selective and synergistic cell kill of targeted cancer cells. In vitro studies involving temporally staggered exposure of the cells to the individual components (primary hybrid antibody, toxin, and secondary antitoxin monoclonal antibody biomodifier) have been performed in a manner allowing maintenance of cytotoxic efficacy. It is concluded that sequential administration of these immunotherapeutic components, individually nontoxic, is a feasible strategy to develop an effective immunotherapeutic treatment of human prostate carcinoma.\r"

Eighty-two (15.1%) patients having surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysms were found to have a first-degree relative with an aneurysm, as compared to nine (1.8%) of a control group of 500 patients of similar age and sex without aneurysmal disease (p less than 0.001). Detailed analysis was next performed of the pedigree charts of patients with a positive family history of aneurysm who underwent repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms by all authors over the 9-year study period. This review identified a total study population of 86 families with 209 first-degree relatives with abdominal aortic aneurysms. Clinical and anatomic features of this familial group were compared to those of 460 patients operated on for abdominal aortic aneurysms who had no family history of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Patients with familial abdominal aortic aneurysms were more likely to be women (35% vs 14%), and men with familial abdominal aortic aneurysms tended to be about 5 years younger than the women. There was no significant difference between the patients with nonfamilial and familial abdominal aortic aneurysms in anatomic extent of aneurysmal disease, multiplicity of aneurysms, associated occlusive disease, or blood type. There was a history of aneurysm rupture in 35 of 86 (40.7%) families with familial abdominal aortic aneurysms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Endoscopic sclerotherapy has been widely advocated as primary therapy for patients surviving hemorrhage from esophageal varices. The potential for endoscopic sclerotherapy to limit subsequent surgical options remains unclear. The following study was undertaken to assess the endoscopic sclerotherapy-related incidence of splanchnic venous thrombosis in patients undergoing surgery for variceal bleeding. We retrospectively identified 27 patients who underwent portosystemic shunting after an episode of variceal hemorrhage documented by endoscopic examination. Eleven patients underwent endoscopic sclerotherapy before portosystemic surgery for shunting. Among the patients undergoing prior endoscopic sclerotherapy, 6/11 had partial splanchnic venous thrombosis at surgery compared with 2/16 in the non-endoscopic sclerotherapy group. This difference was statistically significant. Only one of the eight patients with splenic or portal vein thrombosis detected at surgery showed signs of the condition when an angiograph was performed. Endoscopic sclerotherapy appears to impose a significant risk for splanchnic venous thrombosis. This complication, not reliably detected by angiographic means, may limit the operative options and long-term outcomes of patients in whom endoscopic sclerotherapy fails.\r"

  ".W": "We studied whether a two-dose regimen of inactivated influenza virus vaccine was more effective than a single dose in inducing protective hemagglutination-inhibition antibody responses in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Participants included subjects with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, subjects with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related complex, and HIV-seropositive individuals with either lymphadenopathy only or no symptoms. Control subjects were HIV-seronegative heterosexuals and HIV-seronegative homosexuals. Two doses of inactivated influenza vaccine containing 15 micrograms of the hemagglutinin of influenza A/Taiwan/1/86(H1N1), A/Leningrad/360/86(H3N2), and B/Ann Arbor/1/86 were administered intramuscularly in the deltoid region 1 month apart. The second dose of vaccine did not significantly increase the frequency or magnitude of antibody responses of either HIV-seropositive or HIV-seronegative subjects over that achieved by a single dose. The two-dose regimen induced a protective level (greater than or equal to 1:64) of hemagglutination-inhibition antibody to influenza A(H1N1) or (H3N2) virus less often in subjects with symptomatic HIV infection than in uninfected control subjects (39% vs 87% or 46% vs 97%, respectively). Our results suggest that a substantial proportion of individuals with symptomatic HIV infection might remain unprotected from influenza, even after immunization with a two-dose regimen.\r"

  ".W": "The association between preoperative smoking cessation and postoperative pulmonary morbidity was studied prospectively in 200 consecutive patients undergoing an elective coronary artery bypass surgical procedure. Detailed respiratory, cardiovascular, and smoking histories were elicited. Preoperative arterial blood gas analyses and bedside spirometry were performed. Urinary cotinine levels were measured to verify smoking histories. During spirometry, severe angina developed in seven patients, who were hence excluded from the study; one patient died of hemorrhage intraoperatively. An observer unaware of patients' preoperative histories assessed the remaining 192 patients throughout the intraoperative and postoperative periods for pulmonary complications. Postoperative pulmonary complications occurred in a third of the current smokers. Patients who had stopped smoking for 2 months or less had a pulmonary complication rate almost 4 times that of patients who had stopped for more than 2 months (57.1% versus 14.5%). Patients who had stopped smoking for more than 6 months had rates similar to those who had never smoked (11.1% and 11.9%, respectively). Preoperative pulmonary dysfunction, increased pack-years of smoking, prolonged surgical time, and the use of enflurane were independently associated with postoperative pulmonary morbidity (P less than 0.05). We concluded that smoking cessation should occur at least 2 months preoperatively to maximize the reduction of postoperative respiratory complications.\r"

Lesions of the skull occurred most frequently, followed by cephalic rash, osseous mandibular destruction, enlarged neck nodes, and gingival disruption. Overall, during the course of the disease, 82% of the children with histiocytosis-X developed head and neck manifestations. There were ten deaths in this series, all associated with diffuse or multifocal disease. Interestingly, four of these patients presented with cephalic rash as a harbinger of diffuse and eventually fatal illness. The method of diagnosis and management of histiocytosis-X is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the risk of the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) during initial remission in 733 consecutive children with acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) who were treated with intensive chemotherapy. This complication was identified according to standard morphologic and cytochemical criteria in 13 patients 1.2 to 6 years (median, 3.0) after the diagnosis of ALL. At three years of follow-up, the cumulative risk of secondary AML during the first bone marrow remission was 1.6 percent (95 percent confidence limits, 0.7 and 3.5 percent); at six years, it was 4.7 percent (2 and 10 percent). The development of secondary AML was much more likely among patients with a T-cell than a non-T-cell immunophenotype (cumulative risk, 19.1 percent [6 and 47 percent] at six years). Sequential cytogenetic studies in 10 patients revealed entirely different karyotypes in 9, suggesting the induction of a second neoplasm. In eight of these patients, the blast cells had abnormalities of the 11q23 chromosomal region, which has been associated with malignant transformation of a pluripotential stem cell. There was no evidence of loss of DNA from chromosome 5 or 7, a karyotypic change commonly observed in cases of AML secondary to treatment with alkylating agents, irradiation, or both. We conclude that there is a substantial risk of AML in patients who receive intensive treatment for ALL, especially in those with a T-cell immunophenotype, and that 11q23 chromosomal abnormalities may be important in the pathogenesis of this complication.\r"

Postlicensure case-control efficacy studies have yielded markedly different estimates of efficacy, leading to contradictory recommendations to practicing physicians. To obtain additional information about the efficacy of the vaccine, we studied cases of invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b disease ascertained through active surveillance in areas with a total population of 34 million. We enrolled children 24 to 59 months of age who did not attend day-care centers. (Data from our day-care study have been published elsewhere.) For each case child, as many as three 24- to 59-month-old control children were chosen from a roster of acquaintances supplied by the child's parent. Conditional logistic regression was used, and vaccine efficacy was estimated to be 62% (95% confidence interval = 0%, 85%), which did not change significantly after adjusting for age and parental smoking, variables that were significantly different for case and control children. Results of this study support our previous finding of a positive protective efficacy, albeit lower than the efficacy of 90% found in children 18 to 71 months of age in the Finnish prelicensure trial.\r"

When he was 5 years of age, he had normal serum calcium and phosphorus levels and increased alkaline phosphatase activity. Treatment with modest dosages of vitamin D (5000 U/d for 3 weeks) resulted in hypercalcemia. At 10 years of age, high-dose vitamin D (40,000 U/d) plus phosphorus (1.1 g/d) therapy for 20 days resulted in symptomatic nephrolithiasis. When, 14 years of age, he had normocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, increased alkaline phosphatase activity, and normal circulating parathyroid hormone concentration. Levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were normal but those of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D were markedly increased. Rickets and osteopenia were evident on radiographs, and osteomalacia was present on trabecular bone obtained at biopsy. Balance study results showed increased intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus, hypercalciuria, and increased urinary phosphorus excretion. This patient manifests an unusual form of hypophosphatemic rickets in which hypercalciuria is a cardinal feature. In contrast with most varieties of hypophosphatemia, this disorder is characterized by appropriately increased production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in response to hypophosphatemia. It is recommended that urinary calcium excretion be assessed in all patients with hypophosphatemic rickets so that appropriate therapy will be instituted.\r"

We have prepared cell-free postnuclear extracts from freshly isolated human monocytes as well as THP.1 cells, a human monocyte-like cell line, and various blood lymphocytes and fibroblast cell lines. Using pre-IL-1 beta synthesized by in vitro transcription and translation, we have shown that only extracts derived from human monocytes and THP.1 cells were capable of cleaving precursor IL-1 beta to authentic mature IL-1 beta. Subcellular fractionation of the extracts suggested that the processing activity is found in the cytosol of monocytes or monocyte-like cell lines. The cleavage product of this protease is identical to authentic IL-1 beta as shown by mobility on SDS/PAGE and amino acid sequence analysis of the [3H]leucine-labeled product. The cleavage product is also capable of binding to the IL-1 receptor found on fibroblast membranes. Finally, mutation of Asp116----Ala116 rendered the IL-1 beta precursor resistant to cleavage by the processing activity. We conclude that a protease activity found only in monocytes will specifically process IL-1 beta to an active form.\r"

  ".W": "From neurointermediate pituitary glands of Xenopus laevis and Rana esculenta, previously unreported peptides termed hydrins, active on water permeability of frog urinary bladder and frog skin (Brunn or \"water-balance\" effect), have been isolated and sequenced. These peptides seem to be derived from the pro-vasotocin-neurophysin precursor. Hydrin 1, found in Xenopus, has been identified as vasotocin C-terminally extended with the Gly-Lys-Arg sequence; hydrin 2, found in Rana, has been identified as vasotocin C-terminally extended with glycine. Hydrin 2 has been detected in several Ranidae (R. esculenta, Rana temporaria, Rana pipiens) and Bufonidae (Bufo bufo, Bufo ictericus) and appears to have a large distribution in terrestrial or semiaquatic anurans. Hydrins, in contrast to vasotocin, are not active on rat uterus or rat blood pressure. They are absent from other vasotocin-bearers such as birds and could be involved specifically in water-electrolyte regulation of amphibians.\r"

  ".W": "By optically probing with a focused, low-power laser beam, we measured the spontaneous deflection fluctuations of the sensory hair bundles on frog saccular hair cells with a sensitivity of about 1 pm/square root of Hz. The preparation was illuminated by two orthogonally polarized laser beams separated by only about 0.2 microns at their foci in the structure under investigation. Slight movement of the object from one beam toward the other caused a change of the phase difference between the transmitted beams and an intensity modulation at the detector where the beams interfered. Maintenance of the health of the cells and function of the transduction mechanism were occasionally confirmed by measuring the intracellular resting potential and the sensitivity of transduction. The root-mean-square (rms) displacement of approximately 3.5 nm at a hair bundle's tip suggests a stiffness of about 350 microN/m, in agreement with measurements made with a probe attached to a bundle's tip. The spectra resemble those of overdamped harmonic oscillators with roll-off frequencies between 200 and 800 Hz. Because the roll-off frequencies depended strongly on the viscosity of the bathing medium, we conclude that hair-bundle motion is mainly damped by the surrounding fluid.\r"

  ".W": "A cDNA encoding a new form of the shared beta subunit (beta 3) of the platelet integrin gpIIb/IIIa and the vitronectin receptor was isolated from a placental cDNA library by screening with a beta 3 (gpIIIa) DNA probe. This beta 3 variant differs from the previously reported beta 3 in that the cytoplasmic domain is 8 amino acids shorter and has an alternative, 13-amino acid COOH-terminal peptide. The 3' untranslated region of the cDNA also differs from the previously reported sequence, while the region coding for the transmembrane domain and extracellular domain is identical to it. Reverse transcription combined with polymerase chain reaction was used to show that human placental tissue and two human cell lines contain the variant mRNA. The sequences of the cDNAs for the previously known beta 3 and the variant beta 3 described here suggest that the difference between the cytoplasmic domains of these subunits arises as a result of an alternative mRNA splicing. These cytoplasmic domains may provide alternative means for the beta 3 integrins to interact with cytoskeletal components.\r"

This approach is generally limited to studying gene function in adult mice since ectopic expression of many interesting genes is disease causing or may be lethal to the developing embryo. To extend the utility of the transgenic mouse system to the early stages of embryogenesis, we have developed a two-tiered method of gene regulation to control transgene expression. Our multiplex gene regulatory system (MGR) allows the establishment of transgenic lines that harbor inducible potentially lethal transgenes. These inducible transgenes are activated only when mated to a second transgenic animal. Induction in the MGR system provides a high degree of temporal and spatial control over transgene expression and should be suitable for engineering \"gain of function mutations\" for many developmental genes.\r"

However, in this work, mRNA for the HTLV-I tax1/rex1 genes was detected in fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells of adult T-cell leukemia patients and asymptomatic HTLV-I carriers by using reverse transcription followed by the polymerase chain reaction. By using fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the expression of tax1/rex1 mRNA was detected in five of the six adult T-cell leukemia patients and four of the eight HTLV-I carriers examined. The amounts of tax1/rex1 mRNA detected corresponded to approximately 10(5) to 10(6) times less than that in the HTLV-I-infected MT-2 cell line. These results indicate that, in some individuals infected with HTLV-I, the provirus in circulating blood cells is transcribed in vivo. Thus the expression of viral antigens in circulating blood cells in vivo is suggested.\r"

To investigate this question, we have compared the abilities of 35 odorants to stimulate the adenylate cyclase and to elicit an electrophysiological response. We report a strong positive correlation between the magnitude of adenylate cyclase stimulation and the summated electrical response of the olfactory epithelium (electro-olfactogram) evoked by individual odorants. We also show that the adenylate cyclase stimulator forskolin equally attenuates the electro-olfactogram response for all odorants tested. These data provide evidence that the adenylate cyclase mediates transduction for a wide variety of odorants.\r"

Pain threshold was measured immediately before and after treatment or rest. Pain threshold significantly increased (p less than .05) in the Auricular, Somatic, and Combined Groups following treatment, with no statistically significant differences in mean pain threshold change scores among treatment groups. The Control Group demonstrated no statistically significant change in pain threshold. The results indicate that TENS applied to any of the three sets of acupuncture points equally increases pain threshold, thus possibly increasing options in choosing stimulation sites for treating patients with pain.\r"

Compared with preoperative angiographic data, only 15 (28%) of the 54 patients were found to have 'complete' revascularization, with patent grafts and all stenosed coronary arteries bypassed.

On the day of surgery the heart rate rose during the second half of the observation period, peaking above 130 beats/min. Heart rate was inversely correlated to metoprolol concentration in plasma with coefficient -0.68 before induction of anesthesia and -0.77 two hours after termination of extracorporeal circulation. The perioperative efficacy of beta-blockade following a late preoperative oral dose of the agent thus appeared to be reduced and inadequate.\r"

In experiments on eight dogs (weight 9-13.5 kg), the gastroepiploic artery was found to be too small for coronary artery anastomosis, and therefore the splenic artery was used. The size approximation with coronary artery (diameter less than 1 mm) was good. Four dogs survived the month of the study. In two of them the anastomosis was patent, in another the splenic artery was patent despite occlusion of the anastomosis, and in the fourth dog both anastomosis and graft were thrombosed. The possibility of using visceral arterial grafts in coronary surgery is discussed.\r"

One monoclonal antibody, anti-APO-1, reacted with a 52-kilodalton antigen (APO-1) on a set of activated human lymphocytes, on malignant human lymphocyte lines, and on some patient-derived leukemic cells. Nanogram quantities of anti-APO-1 completely blocked proliferation of cells bearing APO-1 in vitro in a manner characteristic of a process called programmed cell death or apoptosis. Cell death was preceded by changes in cell morphology and fragmentation of DNA. This process was distinct from antibody- and complement-dependent cell lysis and was mediated by the antibody alone. A single intravenous injection of anti-APO-1 into nu/nu mice carrying a xenotransplant of a human B cell tumor induced regression of this tumor within a few days. Histological thin sections of the regressing tumor showed that anti-APO-1 was able to induce apoptosis in vivo. Thus, induction of apoptosis as a consequence of a signal mediated through cell surface molecules like APO-1 may be a useful therapeutic approach in treatment of malignancy.\r"

In contrast, an antibody to interleukin-4 inhibited parasite-induced IgE but not the eosinophilia.

We assessed the yield of various diagnostic methods, and found that bronchoalveolar lavage samples obtained by the instillation of 20 to 50 ml of normal saline (minilavage) contained detectable organisms in 51 of 53 patients (sensitivity of 96%) when the samples were embedded in plastic, cut in thick sections (1 micron), stained with toluidine blue O, and evaluated by light microscopy. In comparison, the diagnostic yield was 94% for lung biopsy, 85% for touch preparation of lung tissue, 32% for bronchial washing, and 14% for brush biopsy. It is significant that minilavage samples embedded in plastic were positive in all seven patients who did not have transbronchial lung biopsy because they were at high risk for complications. We conclude that the process of embedding minilavage samples in plastic and evaluating thick sections stained with toluidine blue O is a sensitive method of diagnosing PCP in patients with AIDS.\r"

In the case of sentinel hemorrhage, aortography is the initial diagnostic procedure of choice, followed by flexible esophagogastroscopy if necessary.\r"

  ".W": "We measured cerebral blood flow in 10 consecutive, but selected, patients with acute ischemic stroke (less than 48 hours after onset) before and after hemodilution. Cerebral blood flow was measured by xenon-133 inhalation and emission tomography, and only patients with focal hypoperfusion in clinically relevant areas were included. Hemodilution was done according to the hematocrit level: for a hematocrit greater than or equal to 42%, 500 ml whole blood was drawn and replaced by the same volume of dextran 40; for a hematocrit between 37% and 42%, only 250 ml whole blood was drawn and replaced by 500 cc of dextran 40. Mean hematocrit was reduced by 16%, from 46 +/- 5% (SD) to 39 +/- 5% (SD) (p less than 0.001). Cerebral blood flow increased in both hemispheres by an average of 20.9% (p less than 0.001). Regional cerebral blood flow increased in the ischemic areas in all cases, on an average of 21.4 +/- 12.0% (SD) (p less than 0.001). In three patients, a significant redistribution of flow in favor of the hypoperfused areas was observed, and in six patients, the fractional cerebral blood flow increase in the hypoperfused areas was of the same magnitude as in the remainder of the brain. In the last patient, cerebral blood flow increased relatively less in the ischemic areas. Our findings show that cerebral blood flow increases in the ischemic areas after hemodilution therapy in stroke patients. The marked regional cerebral blood flow increase seen in some patients could imply an improved oxygen delivery to the ischemic tissue.\r"

  ".W": "Seventeen patients with an intracranial arteriovenous malformation were studied with positron emission tomography. Cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume, oxygen extraction fraction, and glucose and oxygen metabolism were evaluated in both hemispheres, excluding the area of the malformation itself. Patients were divided into three groups according to the size of their malformation, and results obtained were compared with studies in healthy volunteers. The glucose metabolism was significantly (p less than 0.01) decreased in the ipsilateral hemisphere in all patients. The cerebral blood volume was significantly increased (p less than 0.001) ipsilaterally in the three groups, and contralaterally in patients with medium- and large-sized arteriovenous malformations. The cerebral blood volume to cerebral blood flow ration, an index of vascular mean transit time, was significantly increased (p less than 0.005) ipsilaterally in patients with medium- and large-sized malformations and contralaterally in patients with large ones. Cerebral blood flow, oxygen extraction fraction, and oxygen metabolism were within the normal range bilaterally in all three groups, but oxygen extraction fraction tended to be higher in patients with larger lesions. The lack of significant change in oxygen metabolism suggests that oxygen metabolism in cortical areas remote from the arteriovenous malformation has been maintained by compensatory hemodynamic mechanisms. These data reveal widespread metabolic and hemodynamic consequences of arteriovenous malformations and suggest that they are associated with impairment of glucose metabolism, both in ipsilateral regions remote from the lesion and in the contralateral hemisphere in patients with large lesions.\r"

Though the patient was symptom-free at the time of the study, 133Xe SPECT demonstrated vertebrobasilar insufficiency by showing an impaired vasodilatory response in both the occipital lobes and the right cerebellar hemisphere. Three weeks later, the patient suffered an extensive stroke in these same areas. We therefore suggest that this method could be of great value in the assessment of vertebrobasilar insufficiency.\r"

The report compares this automated closed system to the standard National Cancer Institute (NCI) manual protocols. Lymphocytes (approximately 2.0 x 10(10)) were harvested on the Cobe 2997 blood cell separator for each set of experiments. A set of experiments using automated Ficoll-Isopaque (FI) separation and a set of experiments using an automated wash for platelet reduction were compared to the respective manual methods. SteriCell culture containers were compared to roller bottles, and automated harvest was compared to manual harvest. The cytolytic activity of LAK cells was assayed against that of Daudi cells in a standard 51Cr release assay. The cytolytic activity of LAK cells prepared by a manual method and by the automated SteriCell method are equivalent. The manual and SteriCell FI separation procedures were substantially equivalent. The SteriCell harvest method gave higher recoveries than the manual harvest method (p = 0.04 and p = 0.07), but the overall recovery of LAK cells was not significantly different. Differential counts on the products were similar. Platelet reduction by the SteriCell automated wash procedure was greater than that by the manual procedure (p = 0.05). The SteriCell system represents an acceptable alternative to the manual methods for LAK cell generation and recovery.\r"

During that time, 9876 serologic investigations had been performed as a result of a positive direct or indirect antiglobulin test. Among these samples, sera from 45 previously transfused or pregnant patients contained anti-Fya and two contained anti-Fy3. Twenty-nine of the sera that contained anti-Fya (62%) were from blacks, 12 (25%) were from whites, and 6 (13%) were from Hispanics. Both examples of anti-Fy3 were made by black patients. Red cells (RBCs) from 21 of the black patients were Fy(a-b-), those from 7 were Fy(a-b+), and those from 1 could not be phenotyped. RBCs from 17 of the non-black patients were Fy(a-b+) and those from 1 could not be phenotyped. The population of transfused patients evaluated in this study was 47 percent black, 29 percent white, and 24 percent Hispanic. Calculations based on an expected Fy(a-) frequency of 88 percent in blacks, 33 percent in whites, and 20 percent in Hispanics predict that the racial makeup of the Fy(a-) population at our hospital would be 73 percent black, 18 percent white, and 9 percent Hispanic, which is not significantly different (p = 0.25) from the racial makeup of the patients forming anti-Fya and -Fy3. These data indicate that blacks make antibodies to Duffy antigens as frequently as non-blacks.\r"

  ".W": "Measurements of ionized and total calcium levels in supernatant plasma samples from citrated platelet concentrates (PCs) were made over 7 days of storage. Both ionized and total calcium increased significantly during the storage period: respectively, from 0.074 mM Ca2+ in fresh platelet-rich plasma to 0.084 mM in PCs stored for 7 days (p = 0.017), and from 1.94 mM total calcium to 2.06 mM (p = 0.014) over the same period. The increase in calcium was partially blocked by the addition of platelet activation inhibitors to the PCs. Platelet-poor plasma stored under similar conditions showed no significant change in ionized or total calcium, which indicated that the increases observed in PCs were due to the release of cellular calcium. Significant correlations (p less than 0.01) were found between ionized or total calcium levels and lactate concentration or pH, but not hypotonic shock recovery rate. The demonstration of non-zero levels of ionized calcium makes it likely that Ca2+-dependent enzyme systems such as calpain expression and thrombin generation are active in the plasma of citrated PCs and may contribute to the platelet storage lesion.\r"

Twenty millicuries (740 MBq) of 99mTc-RBCs, labeled by an in vivo technique, were given IV, and tomographic imaging of the intraabdominal vascular blood pool was performed. Fourteen patients with cirrhosis also had arterial portography, and 37 had scintiphotosplenoportography. In 38 of 46 patients with cirrhosis, SPECT images showed portosystemic collaterals. The coronary vein was seen in 52% of the patients, the short gastric vein in 11%, the gastrorenal or splenorenal shunt in 24%, the umbilical vein in 11%, and the anterior abdominal wall vein in 17%. Portosystemic collaterals were not shown in any of the patients with chronic hepatitis. Collaterals were identified on SPECT images in 10 of 11 patients in whom collaterals were documented by arterial portography and in all 28 patients in whom collaterals were shown by scintiphotosplenoportography. Furthermore, SPECT clearly showed a patent portal vein in three patients and the coronary vein in two patients, when these veins were not identified by means of scintiphotosplenoportography. This experience suggests that SPECT is useful for the noninvasive identification of portosystemic collaterals in patients with portal hypertension.\r"

The lack of a unified clinical approach has been partly due to the absence of a name for the clinical condition, which we propose to call juxtasternal arthro-osteitis. Although juxtasternal arthro-osteitis may be caused by septic arthritis, this study was based on 24 adult patients with noninfectious juxtasternal arthro-osteitis, collected retrospectively from records of patients who had sternal tomography and from rheumatology clinic populations. Twelve of the patients had an underlying systemic arthropathy that met standard diagnostic criteria; three patients had an unclassifiable systemic arthropathy; and nine patients had the idiopathic localized disease, which has been termed sternocostoclavicular hyperostosis. Radiographic findings in the various diseases followed definite trends, but were not sufficiently distinct to provide the sole basis for diagnosis. Initial failure to correlate dermatologic, rheumatologic, radiographic, and laboratory findings led to prolonged delays in diagnosis in many cases. When juxtasternal arthro-osteitis is encountered, a thorough evaluation should be made for systemic disease. Idiopathic sternocostoclavicular hyperostosis can be diagnosed only after systemic arthropathy or enthesopathy has been excluded.\r"

Use of single-photon emission computerized tomography with TI-201 should allow for a more accurate assessment of prognosis after myocardial infarction. A new radiopharmaceutical, technetium 99-m methoxyisobutyl isonitrile, provides a number of advantages over TI-201, including higher quality images, lack of redistribution, and the ability to assess first-pass ventricular function. Applications of TI-201 and technetium 99-m methoxyisobutyl isonitrile include assessment of arterial patency and myocardial salvage immediately after thrombolytic therapy, detection of resting ischemia after thrombolytic therapy, targeting of subsets of patients for further intervention, and predischarge assessment to predict the future course of patients after an acute myocardial infarction.\r"

The cells had both TCR beta and TCR gamma gene rearrangement but had negative results with the monoclonal antibody WT31, which reacts with a framework epitope on the T alpha/beta heterodimer (Ti) of the conventional T-cell receptor (TCR). This suggests an association of the CD3 molecular complex with a different polypeptide (the alternate TCR gamma).

One of the cases was also analyzed on frozen material. In Kikuchi's lymphadenitis, plasmacytoid monocytes expressed the CD38 and LN1 antigens in addition to their monocyte/macrophage antigens found in nonspecific reactive lymph nodes. These plasmacytoid monocyte aggregates contained large numbers of Mac387+ lysozyme+ macrophages, scattered HLADR+ dendritic cells, and high numbers of CD8+ T-lymphocytes. Collections of T-immunoblasts or areas of necrosis were observed within these aggregates. The authors speculate that the histologic feature of Kikuchi's lymphadenitis is the morphologic substrate of a T-cell-mediated cytotoxic immune reaction occurring in plasmacytoid monocyte aggregates and resulting in plasmacytoid monocyte damage and necrosis.\r"

  ".W": "Regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMA) detected by intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) are thought to be sensitive markers of myocardial ischemia. To assess the prognostic significance of RWMA as compared with other less costly technologies such as electrocardiography (ECG) and hemodynamic measurements [blood pressure (BP) and pulmonary artery (PA) pressure], 50 patients were prospectively studied who were undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery using continuous TEE, ECG (Holter), and hemodynamic measurements during the prebypass, postbypass, and early postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) periods (first 4 h). Echocardiographic and ECG evidence of ischemia was characterized during each of these three periods and related to adverse clinical outcomes (postoperative myocardial infarction, ventricular failure, and cardiac death). Clinicians were blinded to the TEE and ECG information. The prevalence of myocardial ischemia during the perioperative periods was as follows: prebypass, 20% (TEE) versus 7% (ECG); postbypass, 36% (TEE) versus 25% (ECG); ICU 25% (TEE) versus 16% (ECG). Neither prebypass TEE ischemia nor ECG ischemia occurring in any of the three periods predicted adverse outcome. In contrast, postbypass TEE ischemia was predictive of outcome: six of 18 patients with postbypass TEE ischemia had adverse outcomes versus 0 of 32 without TEE ischemia (P = 0.001). Seventy-three percent of the echocardiographic ischemic episodes occurred without acute change (+/- 20% of control) in heart rate, BP, or PA pressure. The authors conclude that: 1) prebypass myocardial ischemia was relatively uncommon, 2) the incidence of ECG and TEE ischemia was highest in the postbypass period, and 3) postbypass RWMA were related to adverse clinical outcome.\r"

  ".W": "Current concepts of the immunopathogenesis of sarcoidosis favor a central role of activated, interleukin-2 (IL-2) producing helper T-cells at sites of inflammation. Normally, activated T-cells release IL-2 and express IL-2 receptors (IL-2R). IL-2R+ cells, however, are not uniformly found in patients with clinically active disease. To determine whether the lack of IL-2R+ cells is caused by a dysregulation of the IL-2R gene or by the mode of T-cell activation in pulmonary sarcoidosis, we quantified IL-2 and IL-2R m-RNA transcripts, IL-2 release, and IL-2R surface protein in peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with sarcoidosis and normal control subjects before and after in vitro stimulation as a function of time. Additionally, we determined the percentage of IL-2R+ bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and peripheral blood lymphocytes in our study population and evaluated the in vivo transcriptional activity of the IL-2R gene. In peripheral blood lymphocytes, maximal IL-2R mRNA accumulation is found between 6 and 24 h, and maximal accumulation of IL-2 mRNA is found between 24 and 48 h. No differences emerged between normal subjects and patients with sarcoidosis. In six of 19 patients, we observed elevated numbers of IL-2R+ BAL lymphocytes and found IL-2R mRNA in those cells. These results are in accordance with the concept of a compartmentalized T-cell activation in sarcoidosis, resulting in IL-2 and IL-2R positive BAL cells and quiescent peripheral blood lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine if aerosolization of purified human plasma alpha 1-antitrypsin is an effective means for increasing lower respiratory anti-neutrophil-elastase defenses in alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. DESIGN: Nonrandomized, before-and-after trial with a 7-day treatment period. Companion studies in animals to determine lung epithelial permeability to alpha 1-antitrypsin. PATIENTS: Twelve patients with homozygous Z-type alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency and mild to moderate emphysema. INTERVENTIONS: Aerosol administration of human plasma alpha 1-antitrypsin, 100 mg every 12 hours for 7 days. Single, 100-mg aerosol dose to anesthetized sheep with indwelling thoracic lymph duct catheters for direct assessment of lung permeability. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Treatment resulted in increased alpha 1-antitrypsin levels in the lung epithelial lining fluid (0.28 +/- 0.07 microM before therapy to 5.86 +/- 1.03 microM after therapy) and increased anti-neutrophil-elastase capacity (0.78 +/- 0.38 microM before therapy to 4.16 +/- 0.95 microM after therapy). Aerosolized alpha 1-antitrypsin diffused across the respiratory epithelium and entered lung interstitial lymph (in sheep) and reached the systemic circulation (in sheep and humans). No side effects were noted. CONCLUSION: Short-term aerosol administration of human plasma alpha 1-antitrypsin to patients with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency is safe and feasible, resulting in a return to normal of anti-neutrophil-elastase defenses in the lower respiratory tract. The aerosol approach, therefore, merits serious long-term evaluation as an alternative to other parenteral forms of administering therapeutic proteins.\r"

Results indicated that the patients had short VOR time constants, asymmetric responses to both EVA and EHA rotation, and normal EHA modulation components. These findings suggest that unilateral peripheral vestibular loss causes a shortened VOR time constant even with the addition of dynamic otolithic stimulation and causes an asymmetry in semicircular canal-ocular reflexes and one aspect of otolith-ocular reflexes.\r"

The nature of the resistance was examined further. A number of cloned variants were generated, and thymidine kinase and DNA polymerase assays were carried out. Variants that were resistant to ACV were found to be thymidine kinase deficient. Evidence for alteration in the DNA polymerase was not found when ACV triphosphate or phosphonoacetic acid was used as the inhibitor. In vivo studies with the plaque-purified viruses showed that ACV resistance was associated with a reduced neurovirulence. In a zosteriform model, virus resistant to ACV was unable to induce secondary spread in the same dermatome, to invade the peripheral nervous system or the central nervous system, or to establish latent infections.\r"

  ".W": "Concomitant use of epidermal growth factor and fibronectin for the treatment of corneal epithelial wounds has a putative advantage of promoting complementary aspects of wound healing: epidermal growth factor enhances mitosis, while fibronectin increases cell-to-substrate adhesiveness and possibly cell motility. To determine if the combination of epidermal growth factor and fibronectin is synergistic in accelerating the speed of corneal epithelial wound coverage, epithelial wound closure rates were compared in serum-free rat corneal organ cultures among epidermal growth factor alone, fibronectin alone, their combination, and drug-free controls. Epidermal growth factor (50 to 1000 ng/mL) significantly increased the rate of wound closure over that of the drug-free controls, while fibronectin (50 to 100 micrograms/mL) had not significant effect. Wound closure rates with combined epidermal growth factor and fibronectin were no faster than with epidermal growth factor alone. The results indicate that fibronectin does not accelerate the rate of corneal epithelial migration when used alone or in combination with epidermal growth factor. This may reflect that the major role of fibronectin may be in the enhancement of cell-to-substrate adhesion and not of migration per se.\r"

Lymphopenia was associated with anti-Ro (SS-A) and, secondarily, with anti-single-stranded DNA. Renal disease in these SLE patients was inversely associated with anti-La (SS-B) and was positively associated with anti-double-stranded DNA. There were no associations between the HLA antigens and these clinical manifestations. The results support a model of disease expression in which individuals are nonspecifically potentiated for SLE. Their HLA antigen composition influences the production of particular autoantibodies that are related in complex ways to the different particular clinical findings of SLE manifested in individual patients.\r"

However, it has not been shown whether B27 is the gene that predisposes to the development of AS or if it is merely linked with the disease-susceptibility locus. Furthermore, if B27 itself is the disease-susceptibility gene, there may be epistatic loci that also contribute to the development of AS or modify its clinical manifestation. A class I HLA 9.2-kb Pvu II restriction fragment was recently identified, which, when present in a B27-positive individual, further increased the relative risk for developing AS (from 119 to 297). This study was therefore designed to confirm the association between AS and this restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and to map the location of this fragment in the genome. The data presented here suggest that the class I HLA 9.2-kb Pvu II RFLP represents a Pvu II polymorphism at the 5' end of the HLA-A locus that is tightly linked with both HLA-A3 and A9 alleles. However, there is no association between this RFLP and AS in a population of patients living in Baltimore.\r"

Antibodies to H5 alone were found in 1 of 21 pauciarticular JRA sera, 1 of 19 polyarticular JRA sera, and 3 of 11 systemic JRA sera. Antibodies to both H1 and H5 were found in 4 of 21 pauciarticular JRA sera, 4 of 19 polyarticular JRA sera, and 1 of 11 systemic JRA sera. Antibodies to the core histones (H2A and H2B) were found in 1 of 21 pauciarticular JRA sera, 1 of 19 polyarticular JRA sera, and no systemic JRA sera. No reactivity to histones was observed in 30 sera from age-matched children with nonrheumatic diseases. The presence of H1 and H5 antibodies did not correlate with antinuclear antibody titers or with a homogeneous pattern of immunofluorescence. The predominance of H1 and H5 antibodies and relative absence of antibodies binding to core histones in JRA contrast with findings in adult systemic lupus erythematosus. Further, the presence of antibodies to H5 alone in some of the JRA patients indicates that the immune response in these patients is directed to determinants that are not shared by sequences of mammalian proteins.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the phenotype of infiltrating mononuclear cells in patients with temporal arteritis (TA), we performed immunohistochemical studies on temporal artery biopsy specimens from 24 patients with biopsy-proven TA. Interdigitating reticulum cells (IRC) were observed in 41% of the patients; disease duration was significantly shorter in these patients than in patients lacking IRC (mean 1.5 months versus 3.8 months). Infiltrating cells consisted predominantly of HLA-DR-expressing macrophages and T lymphocytes, especially of the CD4 subset. There were few B cells and no K cells. No relationship between cellular distribution and disease duration or treatment was found. Interleukin-2 receptor expression was observed in 87.5% of biopsy specimens obtained prior to or within the first 4 days of treatment with prednisone, but in only 14% of specimens obtained later. The presence of IRC in patients with TA suggests an autoimmune reaction directed against an antigenic substance that resides in the arterial wall and is presented and processed in situ. DR-expressing macrophages activated by CD4+ T lymphocytes may contribute to arterial damage in TA. Corticosteroids do not modify cellular distribution but induce important functional changes, as demonstrated by the disappearance of interleukin-2 receptor expression in patients treated for more than 4 days.\r"

Using an anti-bromodeoxyuridine monoclonal antibody (MoAb) to specifically count myeloma cells in the S-phase (ie, labeling index, LI), we demonstrate that the IL-6 responsiveness of myeloma cells in vitro is directly correlated with their LI in vivo. Myeloma cells from all 13 patients with high LIs in vivo (greater than or equal to 1%) responded in vitro to IL-6, the strongest response occurring in cells from five patients with plasma-cell leukemia. In contrast, the cells of only two of eight patients with low myeloma-cell LIs in vivo (less than 1%) responded to IL-6 in vitro. After seven days of culturing with 1,000 U/mL recombinant IL-6 (rIL-6), the median LI value in the first group of patients (in vivo LI greater than or equal to 1%) was 11%, ie 11 times higher (P less than .01) than the median LI value (1%) in the second group of patients (in vivo LI less than 1%). Thus, the in vitro IL-6 responsiveness of myeloma cells is directly related to their in vivo proliferative status, and hence to the severity of the disease.\r"

The activity of human platelet PAI-1 was neutralized to the same extent by bovine activated protein C and bovine des-1-41-light chain-activated protein C. Both forms of activated protein C formed SDS-stable, divalent-cation independent complexes with platelet PAI-1, as demonstrated by immunoblotting using antibodies directed to either protein C or PAI-1. Since activated protein C neutralized PAI-1, the potential inhibition of the enzyme by PAI-1 was studied. Purified PAI-1 inhibited the amidolytic activity of bovine-activated protein C and bovine des-1-41-light chain-activated protein C with a k2 of 2.85 X 10(4) M-1 sec-1 for both proteins. These data suggest that the gla domain of activated protein C is not required for neutralization of PAI-1 activity, for complex formation with PAI-1, or for inhibition of the amidolytic activity of activated protein C by PAI-1.\r"

  ".W": "Although it has been demonstrated that lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells kill tumor cells in a selective way without being toxic to a variety of normal cells, contradictory results exist about the possible toxicity of natural killer (NK) and LAK cells for hematopoietic progenitor cells. Therefore, the cytolytic activity and growth inhibitory effects of LAK cells on normal bone marrow progenitor cells and the ability of LAK cells to eliminate neoplastic hematopoietic cells from populations of bone marrow cells in vitro was studied. The results of these experiments show the following: (1) LAK cells have little cytolytic activity against normal bone marrow cells; (2) normal bone marrow cells fail to cold target compete for the killing of the hematopoietic tumor cell lines K562 and HL60 or freshly frozen acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) blast cells by LAK cells; (3) LAK cells inhibit the growth of K562 and HL60 to more than 90% in clonogenic assays; (4) LAK cells have no inhibitory effect on hematopoietic progenitor growth in CFU-GM (colony-forming unit-granulocytes, macrophages), CFU-E (colony-forming unit-erythrocytes), BFU-E (burst-forming units-erythrocytes), or CFU-GEMM (colony-forming unit-granulocytes, erythrocytes, macrophages, megakaryocytes) assays. These results indicate that LAK cells have low toxicity for normal bone marrow and that LAK activity against tumor cells is not adversely affected by the presence of normal bone marrow cells. The differences in cytolysis and growth inhibition of neoplastic hematopoietic cells and hematopoietic progenitor cells by LAK cells in vitro could create a therapeutic index that might allow the use of LAK cells for cleansing of the autologous bone marrow graft and for adjuvant therapy in combination with autologous bone marrow transplantation without compromising the reconstitution of the bone marrow in the host.\r"

Cynomolgus monkeys received 1 microgram/kg/day rhIL-1b intravenously for 2, 7, and 14 days following 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment (75 mg/kg x 2 days). Compared with controls, a significantly shortened time to achieve an absolute neutrophil (ANC) count over 500/microL was observed in animals receiving 2- and 7-day courses of rhIL-1b (17 v 30 days), while animals receiving a 14-day course of rhIL-1b achieved an ANC over 500/microL by 23 days. Concomitantly, a marked increase in granulocyte-macrophage colonies (CFU-GM) was observed at 14 days following 5-FU in animals receiving 2- and 7-day rhIL-1b courses. In animals receiving a 14-day rhIL-1b course, a significant increase in CFU-GM relative to control was not seen until 21 days post 5-FU. Utilizing a serum-free colony assay system, a 50% inhibition of normal marrow CFU-GM growth was observed with the addition of sera obtained on day 9 post 5-FU from animals receiving rhIL-1b for 14 days. Sera obtained at any time from animals receiving 2- and 7-day rhIL-1b treatment did not show any growth inhibition. Addition of antibodies to TNFa to the coculture assay abrogated the CFU-GM growth inhibition. TNFa levels in sera with the inhibitory activity was relatively high (918 pg/mL). Our data indicate that rhIL-1b enhances hematopoietic recovery following 5-FU if administered for short periods of time (less than 7 days), whereas prolonged administration has a counterproductive effect that is due in part to the induction of TNFa production.\r"

Cleavage was monitored by sodium dodecylsulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), SDS-agarose electrophoresis, crossed immuno-electrophoresis, ristocetin and botrocetin cofactor activities, and ristocetin and botrocetin induced binding to fixed washed platelets. Cleavage of vWF by porcine elastase was dependent on both the concentration of porcine elastase and period of incubation. Incubation of vWF with concentrations of porcine elastase greater than 20 U/mL for 30 minutes resulted in loss of the 240 Kd vWF subunit and a corresponding loss of the high molecular weight multimers and formation of fragments with molecular weights on reduced SDS-PAGE of 150, 125, 115 Kd and minor bands at 44, 28, and 24 Kd and a band at 20 Kd, which increased in intensity as either the concentration of porcine elastase or the period of incubation increased. More than 50% of the ristocetin cofactor activity was lost during a five-minute incubation of vWF with 0.56 U/mL porcine elastase when no detectable structural changes in the vWF molecule had occurred. Botrocetin cofactor activity was more resistant. Similarly botrocetin induced vWF binding to platelets was retained by a fraction produced by digestion of vWF with porcine elastase, which contained predominantly a 20 Kd fragment of vWF. This fragment retained insignificant amounts of ristocetin related functions and therefore represents a useful piece of the vWF molecule for further exploration of the site involved in botrocetin induced binding to platelets.\r"

  ".W": "This study analyzes the expression of functional interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptors on leukemic B-cell precursors (BCPs) from B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP ALL) patients. We first investigated the specific binding of 125I-labeled recombinant IL-1 (125I-rIL-1) (4 x 10(17) cpm/mol) to fresh marrow blasts from 11 BCP ALL patients. In five of 11 cases, the binding of 125I-rIL-1 was significantly blocked by excess cold rIL-1. In these five cases, the cell-bound radioactivity ranged from 146 cpm/10(6) cells to 2,412 cpm/10(6) cells (mean +/- SE = 782 +/- 414 cpm/10(6) cells), indicating that 4 to 60 femtomols (mean +/- SE = 20 +/- 10 femtomols) of 125I-rIL-1 specifically bound per 10(7) cells. The estimated number of 125I-rIL-1 molecules bound per cell ranged from 219 to 3,618 (mean +/- SE = 1173 +/- 621). In all five cases, BCP colony formation was stimulated by 10 ng/mL (570 femtomolar) rIL-1, and the background-subtracted colony numbers ranged from 130 to 298 (mean +/- SE = 226 +/- 31). In contrast, no stimulation was observed in six cases that showed no significant 125I-rIL-1 binding. Hence, there was a high correlation between 125I-rIL-1 binding and IL-1 responsiveness, indicating that functional IL-1 receptors were detected in ligand binding assays. Scatchard plot analysis of the specific equilibrium binding data for leukemic BCPs from two IL-1-responsive BCP ALL cases yielded straight linear regression lines, indicating the existence of a single class of 132 to 154 high affinity IL-1 receptors/cell. The apparent affinity constants (Ka) values ranged from 5.2 x 10(9) mol/L-1 to 1.2 x 10(10) mol/L-1. Notably, the concentrations of IL-1 required for half-maximal receptor occupancy (kd = 83 pmol/L to 190 pmol/L) were approximately three orders of magnitude higher than those needed to elicit a half-maximal proliferative response of leukemic BCPs in colony assays (0.1 to 1.0 ng/mL = 5.7 to 57 femtomolar), indicating that only a small fraction of IL-1 receptors need to be occupied to stimulate leukemic BCPs. Notably, IL-1 unresponsive leukemic BCPs from one BCP ALL patient and two BCP ALL cell lines (REH, KM-3) did not exhibit any significant IL-1 binding (less than 10 IL-1 binding sites/cell), and two additional IL-1 unresponsive BCP ALL cell lines (NALM-6, HPB-NULL) expressed only 24 to 54 IL-1 binding sites/cell with a Ka of 7.8 to 9.8 x 10(9) mol/L-1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The absolute numbers of T suppressor/inducer (CD45R+CD4+) cells were elevated in patients with stage O through I disease but within normal range in stage II through IV leukemia. We further showed that the absolute numbers of NK-like (CD16+) cells and their activated counterparts (DR+CD16+) are elevated in B-CLL patients as compared with healthy subjects. The comparison of relative T and NK subsets in the blood of patients and controls showed that the proportions of CD4+, CD8+, and CD16+ cells expressing the activation marker HLA-DR were increased in B-CLL. Furthermore, the percentage of T-suppressor/inducer (CD45R+) cells within the CD4+ population was decreased in the patients. The proportion of T-suppressor/effector (CD11b+) cells within the CD8+ subset was reduced in subjects with stage II-IV disease only. When stimulated in vitro with the T-cell-dependent inducer TPA, B-CLL cells from patients in Rai stages II through IV secreted larger amounts of IgM as compared with cells from stage O through I patients. A positive correlation was observed between the degree of phenotypic activation of CD4+ T-helper cells and their functional capacity to augment IgM secretion by autologous B-CLL cells. Our findings indicate a tumor cell-directed regulatory role of T cells (and possibly NK cells as well) in B-CLL. Furthermore, monitoring of phenotypically activated and functional T-cell subsets may be helpful in the prediction of disease progression and timing of therapy in B-CLL.\r"

  ".W": "We generated a homogeneous population of cells with cytotoxic activity termed \"adherent lymphokine-activated killer\" (ALAK) cells from the peripheral blood of nine patients in the chronic phase of Ph1 positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The selective enrichment of CML ALAK cells depended on their propensity to adhere to plastic and proliferate when cultured in the presence of recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) for 14 days. Culture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells under these conditions resulted in growth of a uniform population of cells with morphologic characteristics of large granular lymphocytes. The NKH1+/CD3- phenotype associated with IL-2-stimulated natural killer (NK) cells was present on 79% +/- 9% of cells. Absence of colony formation in conditions promoting the growth of CFU-GEMM indicated that the CML ALAK population was not contaminated with viable hematopoietic progenitors. Cytogenetic analysis of the CML ALAK population revealed 119/120 Ph1 negative metaphases and l/120 Ph1 positive metaphase in six patients. Southern blot analysis of CML ALAK failed to demonstrate a bcr gene rearrangement in seven patients known to have a bcr gene rearrangement in myeloid cells. Comparison of ALAK populations derived from peripheral blood of CML patients and normals revealed similar cytotoxicity against the NK-sensitive K562 cell line (104 +/- 36 LU v 88 +/- 19 LU; P = NS) and the NK-resistant Raji cell line (93 +/- 26 LU v 98 +/- 28 LU; P = NS). The proliferative capacity of CML ALAK cells (101 +/- 33 fold expansion) exceeds the growth potential of the normal ALAK cells (22.3 +/- 3 fold expansion; P = .02). Direct comparison of equal numbers of CML ALAK cells and a CML LAK cell population produced by incubation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in rIL-2 for 14 days without adherence revealed that the CML LAK population had significantly lower lytic activity against K562 and Raji cell lines. We are able to expand CML peripheral blood mononuclear cells to provide a population of ALAK cells with potent cytotoxic activity. The CML ALAK population is relatively homogeneous, not contaminated with viable stem cells, not derived from a malignant lineage, and more cytotoxic than equal numbers of CML LAK cells. Further studies are underway to determine if this ALAK population may be effective in autologous killing of chronic myelogenous leukemia stem cells.\r"

We report the expression and secretion of IL-6 by two lymphoma cell lines, OCI-LY3 and OCI-LY12. Addition of recombinant IL-6 stimulated their growth, whereas addition of polyclonal anti-recombinant IL-6 (anti-rIL-6) had a marked inhibitory effect on proliferation.

  ".W": "Botrocetin (venom coagglutinin) induces binding of von Willebrand factor (vWF) to platelet glycoprotein Ib (GPIb), resulting in platelet agglutination. A mechanism whereby botrocetin causes vWF to change to an active platelet-agglutinating form is proposed. Incubation of native vWF with botrocetin yielded an increasingly active vWF with slower migration in two-dimensional immunoelectrophoresis but with no apparent change in vWF multimer pattern. The \"activated\" vWF eluted mainly in the void volume (Vo) (Bio-Gel A-15m column chromatography). Botrocetin eluted in the included volume (Vi). Vo peaks appeared to contain a vWF-botrocetin complex, based on bioassays and immunoassays. 125I-Botrocetin mixed with vWF eluted in two peaks: in the Vo, coincident with active vWF, and in the Vi. With von Willebrand disease (vWD) plasma lacking vWF, 125I-Botrocetin eluted in the Vi only. It did not bind to platelets without vWF. In aggregometric studies, antibodies (Ab) against botrocetin, vWF, and GPIb prevented botrocetin-induced platelet agglutination and caused dissolution of preformed platelet agglutinates. Immunostaining of aggregates with antibotrocetin Ab revealed a positive reaction. Botrocetin appears to act in a two-step manner, first binding with vWF to form a complex, which then binds to GPIb to cause agglutination. All three components, vWF, botrocetin, and GPIb, appear to be required for maintenance of stable platelet agglutinates.\r"

Flow cytofluorometric analysis performed by dual immunofluorescence in three cases demonstrated coexpression of Tac antigen with myeloid (CD13, CD14, or CD33) or lymphoid (CD10) antigen on significant proportions of peripheral blood leukemic cells. Radiolabeled IL-2-binding assay demonstrated the specific IL-2 binding sites in three cases examined. The exogenous IL-2, however, failed to induce proliferative response. A myeloid cell line, Yut-K3, established from peripheral blood leukemic cells from a CML patient with blastic crisis, also expressed cell-surface Tac antigen and CD13 concurrently. SIL-2R assay showed that Yut-K3 released a detectable amount of sIL-2R in its culture supernatant. The serum sIL-2R levels were significantly elevated (range: 2,580 to 172,000 U/mL) in 12 CML patients with blastic crisis and were slightly elevated in ten patients in chronic phase (range: 250 to 820 U/mL) and in three in accelerated phase (range: 790 to 1,305 U/mL) compared with those in 24 normal controls (range: 70 to 695 U/mL, P less than .01). These results indicated that the leukemic cells from CML patients with blastic crisis expressed and released IL-2 receptor (Tac antigen). Longitudinal studies performed in three cases of CML with blastic crisis showed that the change of serum sIL-2R level was closely associated with that of the number of peripheral blood leukocytes and blasts, the percentage of blasts and serum LDH levels, also suggesting that the serum sIL-2R level is a useful clinical indicator of the leukemic cell burden in vivo.\r"

Early passage cultures of normal diploid human mesothelial cells spontaneously expressed detectable levels of M-CSF mRNA transcripts, but lacked detectable transcripts for GM-CSF or G-CSF. Exposure of normal mesothelial cells to epidermal growth factor (EGF), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) induced expression of G-CSF mRNA. The combination of EGF and TNF induced threefold more G-CSF transcripts than did either factor alone. GM-CSF transcripts were induced only by the combination of TNF and EGF. Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) transcripts were induced by EGF, TNF, or LPS and were inhibited by hydrocortisone (HC). All malignant mesothelioma cell lines tested also spontaneously expressed M-CSF transcripts. However, in contrast to normal mesothelial cells, two of four malignant mesothelioma cell lines also autonomously expressed G-CSF and GM-CSF transcripts without TNF, EGF, or LPS stimulation. Secretion of biologically active CSFs was confirmed by testing media conditioned by the various cell types examined. The detection of biologically active CSFs correlated well with the presence of detectable CSF transcripts by Northern analysis. These data indicate that (a) normal human mesothelial cells spontaneously express detectable levels of M-CSF mRNA in culture; (b) EGF is an essential cofactor for optimal induction of G-CSF and GM-CSF expression; (c) exposure of normal mesothelial cells to inflammatory mediators such as LPS and TNF increases the levels of transcripts for CSFs and IL-1 beta; and (d) as compared with normal human mesothelial cells, some cell lines of human malignant mesothelioma exhibit aberrant gene expression for multiple cytokines, including G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-1 beta, and IL-6.\r"

EPI was measured as activity in a test sample that inhibited factor VIIa/tissue factor (TF)-catalyzed activation of 3H-factor IX (activation peptide release) in the presence of factor X. Of the 24 patients with DIC, 13 had sepsis and five had metastatic carcinoma, disorders in which tissue factor is believed to initiate DIC. EPI activity ranged from 68% to 300% (mean 134% +/- 50%). Serial measurements in nine patients failed to show depletion of EPI activity coincident with worsening DIC. DIC induced by tissue factor or other activating materials may progress despite normal EPI levels. In the patients with liver disease, of whom 15 had decompensated chronic hepatocellular disease (two fatal cases) and eight had acute fulminant liver failure (seven fatal cases), plasma or serum EPI activity varied from less than 20% to 194%. Values were distributed in a bimodal fashion. EPI activity could not be correlated with either the etiology of the liver disease or the degree of prolongation of the prothrombin time. Patients with chronic hepatocellular disease who survived had normal or elevated EPI activity. Patients with fatal hepatic dysfunction had low, normal, or high values for EPI activity. This must mean that secretion of EPI from cells other than hepatocytes can maintain normal plasma EPI levels.\r"

Based on the assumptions inherent in our model, which uses the Framingham Heart Study coefficients, we estimate the targeted program would reduce projected coronary heart disease absolute incidence by 8-10% in men ages 35-54 years and by 1-4% in men ages 55-74 years. Our model suggests that similar reductions in coronary heart disease incidence could be achieved by a 10 mg/dl populationwide reduction in serum cholesterol levels. In women, the targeted program would yield greater relative and absolute benefits and would be equivalent to a approximately 23 mg/dl populationwide reduction in serum cholesterol. We conclude that it would be inadvisable to rely solely on targeted cholesterol reduction programs to reduce national coronary heart disease.\r"

Length of stay after coronary surgery had a median and modal value of 7 days. There was, however, a long statistical tail of patients with a prolonged length of stay extending out to more than 180 days. Prolonged length of stay (greater than 10 days) could be correlated with preprocedural variables such as age, elective versus emergency status, angina class, ejection fraction, and gender. Length of stay increased from a mean of 6.9 +/- 1.4 days under the age of 40 years to 10.9 +/- 12.1 days over the age of 70 years (p less than 0.0001). Length of stay was correlated with the periprocedural variables of wound infection, neurologic event, arrhythmias, pneumonia, postoperative myocardial infarction, mortality, and pericarditis. Length of stay increased from 8.8 +/- 9.6 days without a neurologic event to 21.1 +/- 17.9 days with a neurologic event (p less than 0.0001). Similarly, without a wound infection, the average stay was 8.7 +/- 8.9 days; with a wound infection, the average stay was 32.2 +/- 25.8 days (p less than 0.0001). The correlates of prolonged stay were tested in another population comprising 781 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization followed by coronary artery bypass grafting in 1987. The predictors of prolonged stay in the 1987 population were wound infection, pneumonia, arrhythmias, age, neurologic events, postoperative infarction, and ejection fraction. Thus, length of hospital stay after coronary surgery may be predicted by multiple preprocedural and periprocedural variables.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Yorkshire pigs were fed a regular chow (control pigs), 2% high-cholesterol diet (for 10 weeks, cholesterol-fed pigs), and regular chow plus cod-liver oil (30 ml/day for 4 weeks, oil-fed pigs). Endothelium-dependent responses were examined in vitro in rings of femoral veins in the presence of the inhibitor of cyclooxygenase indomethacin. In control pigs, aggregating platelets, serotonin, and ADP caused endothelium-dependent relaxations. The platelet-induced relaxations were attenuated by methiothepin (a combined 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 serotonergic blocker) or apyrase (an ADPase and ATPase) and were abolished by the combination of the two agents. In quiescent rings, platelets caused contractions, which were reduced in the presence of endothelium; the contractions were prevented by ketanserin (a 5-HT2 serotonergic blocker) or methiothepin but not by R 68 070 (a thromboxane A2 receptor blocker) or dazoxiben (a thromboxane-synthetase blocker). In cholesterol-fed pigs, the platelet-induced relaxations were not altered, whereas in oil-fed pigs, the endothelium-dependent relaxations to platelets, serotonin, and ADP were augmented.

Endothelium-dependent relaxations in response to the calcium ionophore A23187, direct relaxations in response to sodium nitroprusside, and direct contractions in response to potassium chloride were comparable among the three groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The levels of IL-1 were decreased in patients with LN compared with those in normal controls and lower in LN patients with nephrotic syndrome (NS) than in those without NS. In contrast, the values in IgA nephropathy (IgAN) patients with or without NS did not differ from normal subjects. The addition of indomethacin, an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, partially restored this defect. These results suggest that the impaired IL-1 production of LN PBM is probably attributable, at least in part, to increased prostaglandin production and possibly influences the immune status of LN patients.\r"

The model was slightly modified by employing 6 exposures over 2 weeks and using Hill Top Chambers for application of the test material. Contact photoallergy was detected in guinea pigs treated with musk ambrette or tetrachlorosalicylanilide (TCSA), although with TCSA, a lower incidence of contact sensitivity and phototoxicity was also detected. The results of studies conducted with sunscreens showed that p-aminobenzoic acid was photoallergenic, whereas homosalate and 4-isopropyl-dibenzoylmethane (Eusolex 8020) were not. However, contact sensitization, and to a lesser degree primary irritation, was detected with Eusolex 8020 at the concentrations employed in this study.

In part I, irritant contact dermatitis in metal workers has been discussed. In 40 employees with dermatitis, patch tests were performed with a routine series, a series of common components of MWF, and a series of preservatives the employees worked with. Contact sensitization was established in 8 persons (2.8% of all workers), of whom 4 were allergic to biocides and/or corrosion inhibitors. Difficulties in interpretation of the relevance of positive reactions are discussed. Attention is paid to the use of biocides in MWF, their various types and their sensitizing capacities. Measures to reduce the induction of contact sensitization to preservatives in water-based fluids are discussed.\r"

The present study evaluates the relative importance of three therapeutic measures: antibiotics (trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole [TS]); fluid infusions (lactated Ringer's solution [RL] and 3% albumin [Alb]), and pharmacologic doses of corticosteroids (CS) (dexamethasone [DM]), using central hemodynamics (plasma volume [PV], cardiac output, oxygen consumption [VO2]), and survival as end-points. Septic shock was induced by intraperitoneal injection of live Escherichia coli bacteria. At 5 h in untreated septic rats, PV had dropped to 76%, cardiac output to 69%, and VO2 to 71% of preshock levels. Untreated septic animals had a mean survival time of 9.7 +/- 1.7 (SD) h, with none surviving 24 h. Regardless of therapy, cardiac output and VO2 at 10 h were predictors of survival time (p less than .01). Treatment was initiated at 5.5 h after bacterial injection, at a time when TS therapy alone had not improved the 24-h survival rate. Animals treated with DM, RL, and Alb, in this order, exhibited progressively improved central hemodynamics, and 24-h survival rate increased to 60% compared with 0 in untreated animals (p less than .001). The combination of DM and RL produced no further improvement. However, DM combined with 3% Alb restored VO2, cardiac output, and PV to 81%, 100%, and 125%, respectively, increasing the 24-h survival rate to 97% (29/30), significantly greater than that achieved by any other treatment modality (p less than .05).\r"

Relaxation responses to papaverine, and contractile responses to KCl and norepinephrine were also assessed using a bioassay technique. Prolonged hyperoxia in rabbits for 3 days produced loss of endothelium-dependent relaxation of the PA, and significant attentuation of contractile response to KCl and relaxation response to papaverine. These changes were prevented by subcutaneous SOD administration. Histological examination using light and electron microscopy revealed focal edema, destruction, and detachment of the PA endothelium in the PA strip preparations from these rabbits. Thus, it is concluded that a high concentration of oxygen exposure in rabbits for 3 days produces not only histological damage in the PA endothelium, but also causes impairment of vascular reactivity to constricting and relaxing agents. Subcutaneous SOD administration prevented oxygen-induced PA damage.\r"

Chest roentgenograms from the Second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a sample survey of the US civilian noninstitutional population, were used in conjunction with estimates of sensitivity and specificity of this technique determined from patients who underwent right heart catheterization to estimate the prevalence of pulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary artery pressure greater than 20 mm Hg at rest) in the US population aged 25 years and older. The prevalence is estimated to be very low in the population at large, primarily because of the low prevalence in women of all ages. The prevalence in men is 13.4 percent above age 34, and increases to 28.2 percent above age 64. Thus, in elderly men, pulmonary hypertension is relatively common and may have an important impact in the management of this age group.\r"

Open lung biopsy (OLB) frequently is recommended for diagnosis of pulmonary infiltrates in patients with NHL, but its usefulness for patient management and outcome has not been evaluated for patients with NHL. We reviewed the results of 20 consecutive OLB in 19 patients with previously diagnosed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma at Stanford University Medical Center during a nine-year period. Fifteen patients had known active lymphoma at time of OLB, and no patient had granulocytopenia. Ten of the 20 OLBs yielded specific diagnoses. A greater proportion of patients with stage I or II disease had specific diagnoses than patients with more advanced NHL. Five of 14 patients considered to have had a life threatening illness at the time of OLB had specific diagnoses from OLB vs five of six patients considered clinically stable. Chest roentgenograms that had discrete masses or nodules correlated with ability to establish a specific diagnosis by OLB. For patients in whom the results of OLB were nonspecific, management appeared unaffected by the OLB. The OLB in NHL appeared most useful for detecting recurrent NHL in clinically stable patients with discrete nodules or masses on chest roentgenogram. Pneumocystis pneumonia was the only infection identified by OLB.\r"

The prevalence of self-reported constipation, diarrhea, infrequent defecation (three or fewer bowel movements per week), and frequent defecation (two or more bowel movements per day) increased with aging. Women were more likely than men (P less than 0.05) to report constipation (20.8% compared to 8.0%) and infrequent defecation (9.1% compared to 3.2%). Blacks were more likely than whites to report infrequent defecation (P less than 0.05). Older respondents reporting constipation were more likely to use laxatives or stool softeners than younger respondents reporting constipation, but they were also less likely to have infrequent defecation. To evaluate factors predictive of impaired bowel function, case definitions were created using information concerning complaint of constipation, laxative use, frequency of defecation, and stool consistency. Female gender, black race, fewer years of education, low physical activity, and symptoms of depression were independent risk factors for impaired bowel function. This study provides national estimates of bowel complaints and their natural history and examines possible risk factors for constipation.\r"

  ".W": "At present our knowledge of enteric peptide-containing neurons in man is limited. In this study we have used human appendices removed at surgery to examine the peptidergic innervation by immunocytochemistry, immunochemistry, and pharmacological in vitro experiments. Immunocytochemistry revealed a variety of peptide-containing nerve fiber populations in the human appendix. VIP/PHI-, VIP/PHI/NPY-, SP/NKA-, galanin-, and enkephalin-containing nerve fibers were numerous; CGRP- and GRP-containing nerve fibers were moderate in number, while only scattered NPY-, enkephalin/BAM-, and somatostatin-containing nerve fibers could be found. No CCK-, dynorphin A-, or dynorphin B-immunoreactive nerve fibers could be detected. The coexistence of VIP/PHI, SP/NKA, and enkaphalin/BAM can be anticipated from the known sequence of their respective precursors. However, the coexistence of VIP/PHI and NPY was unexpected but corroborates previous observations in other species. Interestingly, SP and CGRP did not seem to coexist in nerve fibers of the human appendix. Immunochemistry (RIA and HPLC) confirmed the presence of VIP, NPY, SP, galanin, CGRP, GRP, enkephalin, and somatostatin. Motor activity studies suggest that acetylcholine plays a major role in the electrically evoked contractions, since atropine suppressed these contractions. Galanin (10(-8)-10(-6) M) and GRP (10(-9)-10(-7) M) caused concentration-dependent contractions that were unaffected by tetrodotoxin and thus probably reflect a direct action on smooth muscle receptors. GRP (10(-9) M) enhanced the electrically induced cholinergic contraction (to 193 +/- 24%), while met-enkephalin (10(-6) M) reduced it (to 54 +/- 6%). Both peptides failed to affect the contractile response to exogenous acetylcholine and probably act to modulate the release of acetylcholine. NPY, VIP, CGRP, SP, and somatostatin failed to induce contraction or to affect the electrically evoked contractions.\r"

  ".W": "Very recently, it has been reported that interleukin-1 (IL-1) has an inhibitory effect on progesterone production by porcine granulosa cells in vitro. In the present study we investigated the presence of IL-1 or IL-1-like activity in porcine ovarian follicular fluids (FF) as the first step in elucidating the physiological role of IL-1 in follicular growth and maturation. Since IL-1 and IL-1-like substances have interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R)/p55(Tac)-inducing activity (TIA), we determined the TIA in the FF by means of a highly sensitive TIA assay using flow cytometry. TIA was significantly higher (P less than 0.01) in the FF of small follicles than in those of medium-sized and large follicles. A significant negative correlation (P less than 0.05) was apparent between TIA and 17 beta-estradiol concentration in the FF. The conditioned media of porcine granulosa cells also showed TIA. Of these conditioned media, those from small follicles exhibited higher TIA than those from medium-sized and large follicles. TIA in the conditioned media decreased rapidly as the culture period was extended. Sex steroids such as 17 beta-estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, and androstenedione had no effect on IL-2R/p55(Tac) induction. These results indicate that porcine granulosa cells produce the IL-2R/p55(Tac)-inducing factor, the activity of which decreases in association with the maturation of the follicles. Because of the heterogeneity of IL-2R-inducing factors, the relationship between TIA in the FF and IL-1 should be elucidated. We discuss the possibility that this factor may play a role in follicular maturation and that enhancement of IL-2R/p55(Tac) expression by this factor may contribute to the local defense mechanism in ovarian follicles.\r"

  ".W": "Conditioned medium (CM) from two squamous cell carcinoma cell lines, SCC-9 and SCC-13, stimulated bone resorption in neonatal mouse calvariae in organ culture. Enhanced bone resorption induced by CM was associated with an increased production of prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2) by the calvariae. Complete inhibition of stimulated PGE2 synthesis by indomethacin only partially inhibited bone resorption-stimulating activity (BRSA) in the CM. Neither SCC-9 nor SCC-13 CM stimulated cAMP production in rat osteosarcoma cells (ROS 17/2.8). The BRSA in CM was completely inhibited by an antibody to interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha). Fractionation of SCC-9 CM by gel filtration and HPLC ion exchange chromatography revealed a single peak of BRSA and PGE2 synthesis-stimulating activity at 17-20K (termed SCMII). In mouse calvariae, SCMII increased medium Ca2+ and PGE2 in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations from 20 ng protein/ml to a maximum of 500 ng protein/ml. Preincubation of SCMII with antibody to IL-1 alpha completely inhibited SCMII-induced bone resorption. SCMII also enhanced thymocyte proliferation with activity that was equivalent to 353 U/ml IL-1. Antibodies to IL-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor had no effect on SCMII-induced bone resorption. Using specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta, IL-1 alpha was measured in high concentrations in both crude and partially purified fractions of SCC-9 and SCC-13 CM. In contrast, IL-1 beta was either undetectable or present in amounts below those that stimulate bone resorption. In addition, SCMII did not enhance cAMP production in bone cells. We conclude that the BRSA produced by the two squamous cell carcinoma cell lines SCC-9 and SCC-13 is IL-1 alpha.\r"

A total of 1,233 patients with active epilepsy were identified. Mean annual incidence of epilepsy was 24/100,000. Age-specific incidence ratios tended to increase with advancing age. Prevalence of active epilepsy was 629/100,000. Both prevalence and incidence were higher in males than in females. Age-specific prevalence of active epilepsy increased until 40-50 years of age, and declined in the oldest age groups. Of the various seizure types, highest prevalence ratios were observed for partial secondarily generalized seizures, complex partial seizures, and tonic-clonic seizures. Prevalence of partial seizures and generalized seizures had a different age-related pattern.\r"

The results were compared with those obtained by neodymium-yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser, bipolar electrocoagulation, and heater probe. Epinephrine (1:10,000), absolute ethanol, and 1% polidocanol were used as injection solutions. In acute, severely bleeding experimental ulcers as well as in transected submucosal arteries, injection methods were not as effective as thermal methods in achieving complete hemostasis, although injection therapy, especially with large volumes of epinephrine (1:10,000), very quickly decreased the rate of bleeding. Chronic experiments showed that epinephrine (1:10,000) caused almost no tissue injury, but also did not induce vessel thrombosis. In contrast, absolute ethanol and 1% polidocanol caused tissue necrosis, ulceration, and vessel thrombosis, the former by acute dehydration and fixation of the tissue, the latter by acute edema and subsequent inflammation and sclerosis. These data suggest that although epinephrine injection may slow or temporarily stop bleeding, this modality is not as efficacious as injection with 1% polidocanol or absolute ethanol in inducing definitive vessel thrombosis. In the present experimental conditions sclerotherapy was not as effective as thermal methods in achieving hemostasis. These data also show that injection therapy with 1% polidocanol and absolute ethanol is by no means safer than thermal methods.\r"

Stimulation with lipopolysaccharide enhanced IL1-beta production by mononuclear cells from active inflammatory bowel disease mucosa but not those from normal mucosa. Depleting the mononuclear cells of macrophages, by panning with monoclonal antibody 3C10, reduced the amount of IL1-beta produced.

A pronounced defect in suppressor cell function was observed in the patient group but not in matched controls irrespective of whether B cells or monocytes were used as the stimulus. This defect was observed for IgG, A and M. This defect was seen both in patients with active disease and with inactive CD suggesting the possibility that a primary regulatory defect might exist in this disease. The patient group displayed normal helper cell function.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to determine whether abnormal osteoblastic growth and/or differentiation play a role in the decreased bone formation in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. To do so, we compared bone formation evaluated by histomorphometric methods and the proliferation kinetics and phenotypic expression of osteoblastic cells isolated from the trabecular bone surface. We found that osteoblastic cells isolated from women whose trabecular bone had low double tetracycline-labeled surface and decreased mean wall thickness had a reduced rate of cell proliferation. The peak of [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA, the maximal DNA synthesis, and the area under the curve of bone cell proliferation were significantly lower in these women than in those with high double tetracycline-labeled surface. In addition, the parameters of bone cell replication correlated with osteoblastic surface and mean wall thickness. By contrast, the initial osteocalcin production and alkaline phosphatase activity and the response to 10 nmol/L 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (48 h) in vitro were similar in women with low, normal, or high bone formation. These results indicate that reduction of bone formation in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis results from an impaired proliferative capacity of cells of osteoblastic lineage present at the trabecular bone surface level.\r"

  ".U": "89327430\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of GH administration on the circadian osteocalcin (Oc) rhythm were determined in four prepubertal children with idiopathic short stature (height, less than 5th percentile; growth velocity, less than 50th percentile for age). Each child underwent 24-h sequential blood sampling on three occasions: immediately before the initiation of GH treatment, 6 months later, and at the end of 12 months of treatment. The growth rate increased more than 50% over baseline in three of the four children during at least one of the 6-month periods. Insulin-like growth factor-I levels increased during treatment in all of the children. Twenty-four-hour Oc levels increased on 7 of the 8 treatment days evaluated. When mean 24-h Oc patterns for each of the 3 study days were derived by averaging across individual subjects at each time point and then compared, we noted an upward shift in the entire pattern during treatment (t = 13.2 at P less than 0.001 and t = 5.9 at P less than 0.001 for 6 and 12 month comparisons vs. the pretreatment day, respectively). This was more easily appreciated after the data were smoothed using the method of running means. There was, in addition, a progressive improvement in the shape of the Oc pattern compared to a normative model derived from a study of healthy adult men. The correlation between the model and the pre-GH day was 0.46, that between the model and the 6 months of GH day was 0.77, and that between the model and the 12 months of GH day was 0.96. Cross-correlation analyses showed that the peak correlation between the 2 treatment days and the model occurred at zero lag. In contrast, the peak correlation between the pre-GH day and the model or the pre-GH day and either of the 2 treatment days occurred when the pre-GH series was lagged by 2-3 h. Thus, an additional finding is the synchronization of the Oc series that occurred during treatment. We conclude that GH treatment increases Oc concentrations in children with idiopathic short stature by affecting its circadian rhythm. This rise in Oc values may not necessarily reflect an increase in growth velocity.\r"

The broad distribution of CRH receptors in brain areas involved in respiratory regulation is consistent with this finding. This study was designed to investigate whether ACTH or cortisol mediates the respiratory stimulation effect of CRH. Bolus injection of 100 micrograms hCRH induced significant respiratory stimulation in all 10 normal subjects studied. hCRH given after the administration of 2 mg dexamethasone, which greatly reduced plasma cortisol levels, had the same respiratory effect on respiration. Thus, increase in plasma ACTH and cortisol concentrations are probably not involved in the respiratory analeptic effect of CRH.\r"

Despite a significant increase in the mean serum 24,25-(OH)2D level [2.1 +/- 0.6 (+/- SE) to 16.7 +/- 6.2 nmol/L; P less than 0.05] after a daily dose of 20 micrograms for 1 month, there were no consistent changes in serum calcium, immunoreactive PTH, or 1,25-(OH)2D concentrations. Intestinal calcium absorption and urinary calcium excretion rose slightly during 24,25-(OH)2D administration in the majority of the patients. In the three patients in whom it was measured, serum 1,24,25-trihydroxyvitamin D levels did not change (19 +/- 5 vs. 20 +/- 5 pmol/L). We conclude that exogenous 24,25-(OH)2D3 at this dose has no significant antagonistic action on 1,25-(OH)2D and may have weak agonistic action.\r"

There were no baseline differences between the groups with regard to gender, age, infarct location, serum creatine kinase levels, time between onset of symptoms and treatment and coronary artery patency rate.

Elective angioplasty was performed in 22 (21%) of 103 patients in Group I and 9 (9%) of 103 patients in Group II, with a success rate of 86% and 100%, respectively, reflecting the higher incidence of angina pectoris and antianginal therapy in Group I. Coronary bypass surgery was performed in 21 (20%) of 103 patients in Group I and 20 (19%) of 103 patients in Group II; there was one operative death in each group. During follow-up, coronary reocclusion or reinfarction, or both, occurred in 25 (29%) of 87 patients in Group I and in 16 (18%) of 87 patients in Group II with reperfused vessels (p = NS). Heart failure occurred in 40% of the patients in both groups who had increased end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes. The survival rate after 3 years was 78% in Group I and 80% in Group II (p = NS).

  ".W": "To determine whether coronary artery bypass surgery can improve function in left ventricular regions not amenable to direct revascularization, 24 patients with multivessel coronary artery disease were studied by radionuclide angiography and coronary arteriography before and 6 months after coronary artery bypass surgery. All had proximal stenosis of the left circumflex artery or a major obtuse marginal branch. Left ventricular regional function was assessed by dividing the left ventricular region of interest into 20 sectors; the 8 sectors corresponding to the posterolateral free wall were used to assess function in the left circumflex artery distribution. Change in function in the left anterior descending territory was not analyzed because of the non-specific septal hypokinesia that develops postoperatively. For the total group, coronary artery bypass surgery significantly increased both global left ventricular ejection fraction during exercise (43 +/- 13% to 50 +/- 14%, p less than 0.001) and the change in ejection fraction from rest to exercise (-7 +/- 10% to 0 +/- 6%, p less than 0.001). Such improvement was observed in 9 of 10 patients with all stenoses bypassed, and to an equivalent degree in 9 of 10 patients in whom the left circumflex artery either could not be bypassed or the bypass graft was occluded (but bypass grafts to other coronary arteries were patent). Similarly, regional ejection fraction in posterolateral segments during exercise also increased comparably after operation in patients with a patent (from 57 +/- 18% to 70 +/- 19%, p less than 0.001) or nonpatent (from 51 +/- 14% to 68 +/- 14%, p less than 0.001) left circumflex graft.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Eligible cases included all infants who were born from 1976 through 1980 to residents of the five county metropolitan Atlanta area and diagnosed with truncus arteriosus, transposition of the great arteries or tetralogy of Fallot. Eligible control infants were a sample of comparable infants without birth defects. Maternal interviews were conducted for 73% (83 of 114) of eligible cases and 72% (1,303 of 1,804) of eligible control infants. The results showed increased risks associated with maternal diabetes (odds ratio 5.6; 90% confidence interval 2.5 to 15.6), maternal stress related to job loss, divorce, separation or death of a close friend or relative (odds ratio 2.4; 90% confidence interval 1.4 to 4.2) and a history of a sibling with a cardiac defect (odds ratio 4.8; 90% confidence interval 2.2 to 10.5). The statistical power of the data was adequate to rule out threefold or greater increases in risk for a wide variety of other exposures, including maternal illnesses other than diabetes, contraceptive use, nonmedicinal drugs (for example, coffee, tea, alcohol, cigarettes, street drugs), employment and education. This population-based study offers no clues that could explain either the high rate of transposition of the great arteries or the temporal trend of an increasing rate of tetralogy of Fallot in Atlanta.\r"
