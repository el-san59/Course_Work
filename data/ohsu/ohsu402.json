This synthesis was concomitant with that of interferon alpha and was switched off when the specific antibodies in the central nervous system increased. No endogenous interferon gamma was detected in 11 serum samples or 13 samples of cerebrospinal fluid collected early in the course of the disease from patients with measles encephalitis and rubella encephalitis, or in serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples from seven patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. In serum collected after the 10th day after the onset of neurological symptoms interferon gamma was present at low concentrations in only three out of 11 serum specimens from patients with measles encephalitis or rubella encephalitis. Interferon gamma was present in patients with acute herpes encephalitis and there was active virus replication, but it was not present in postinfectious encephalitis. Possibly the local production of specific antibodies masks the viral antigens and switches off the induction of interferons.\r"

Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV 2) has been isolated from west African patients and may be transmitted by heterosexual contact. The prevalence of antibodies to HIV 1 and HIV 2 was studied by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) among various groups of subjects in The Gambia, west Africa--namely, prostitutes, blood donors, patients with suspected infection with HIV, patients attending clinics for sexually transmitted diseases, and patients with tuberculosis. Four cases of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) due to infection with HIV 1 were detected, of which three had been acquired abroad. No other subject was found to be positive for antibodies to HIV 1. The prevalence of antibodies to HIV 2 among the patients attending clinics for sexually transmitted diseases was found to have increased from 0/117 in 1984 to 10/185 (5%) in the last six months of 1986. One out of 278 blood donors was positive for antibodies to HIV 2 as were 10 out of 80 patients with suspected AIDS. HIV 2 seems to be transmitted sexually, and, although it has been present for only a short time, it seems to be endemic in The Gambia and is pathogenic.\r"

Six patients in whom these inhibitors had caused cough and a further two patients in whom they were suspected to have caused worsening of bronchial asthma were studied. Nine patients in whom angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors had not been associated with cough served as controls. In the controls lung function and bronchial reactivity were measured once; for the study patients these and the cough index were measured twice before rechallenge for two weeks with an angiotensin enzyme inhibitor and once afterwards. Rechallenge with drug for two weeks caused a significant decrease in the mean concentration of histamine causing a 35% fall in airways conductance and a significant increase in the cough index. Patients with cough showed bronchial hyperactivity compared with the controls, which increased after rechallenge with the inhibitors. Cough associated with converting enzyme inhibitors may be a variant of the cough in asthma.\r"

A patient could be evaluated sooner if symptomatic relief and endoscopically normal mucosa (grade 0) were noted after four to eight weeks' treatment. Patients treated with omeprazole responded significantly more rapidly than those treated with ranitidine (p less than 0.0001), cumulative healing rates at four, eight, and 12 weeks being 90%, 100%, and 100% respectively for those with grade 1 disease and 70%, 85%, and 91% respectively for those with grade 2 or 3 disease in the omeprazole group. Corresponding rates in the ranitidine group were 55%, 79%, and 88% (grade 1) and 26%, 44%, and 54% (grade 2 or 3). Relief of the major symptoms of heartburn, regurgitation, and dysphagia and improvements in the histological appearance of the mucosa occurred earlier and were again more pronounced during treatment with omeprazole than with ranitidine. This observed superiority of omeprazole 40 mg in the morning over ranitidine 150 mg twice daily in the short term treatment of reflux oesophagitis was obtained without major clinical or biochemical side effects, but further research is needed into longer term use of omeprazole and the effects of the acid inhibition it induces.\r"

Four also underwent barium meal examination. In all six cases small lesions were seen in the stomach at endoscopy, and histological examination of biopsy specimens taken from the lesions confirmed the diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma. The barium meal examinations were reported as normal in three patients and showed oesophageal candidiasis in the fourth. These findings suggest that Kaposi's sarcoma of the upper gastrointestinal tract is common in patients positive for HIV antibody, even those without cutaneous lesions. Endoscopy, with biopsy of suspicious lesions, is necessary to make the diagnosis and is recommended in all HIV antibody positive patients with persistent upper gastrointestinal symptoms.\r"

When 100 arthroplasties were performed each year the prophylactic use of systemic antibiotics minimised the total costs of the department--that is, the combined costs of prophylaxis and reoperation for deep sepsis. Some departments also used local antibiotic prophylaxis in the form of polymethylmethacrylate cement impregnated with gentamicin or a combination of systemic and local prophylaxis at almost as low a total cost and with comparable effect. Selection of a method of prophylaxis should not be determined solely on the basis of reducing costs. When a value was assigned to the effects of loss of health an economic optimum was established that allowed selection of a more costly method of prophylaxis together with further reductions in the incidence of infection and the need for reoperation.\r"

The case notes of 64 patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit and taken part in two trials of ranitidine treatment were reviewed. During those trials gastric juice was aspirated hourly and the pH and volume measured. In this study the values recorded during a six hour untreated control phase were used. Data on age, diagnosis, treatment, outcome, episodes of hypoxia, episodes of hypotension, and use of inotropic drugs were also reviewed. Full data were available for 61 patients: 27 had a mean baseline pH of greater than 5 during the control phase and 34 a mean baseline pH of less than 5. Significantly more of those with a high pH suffered hypotension (21/27 v 13/34) and received inotropic drugs (16/27 v 8/34). These findings suggest that hypotension in critically ill patients adversely affects gastric exocrine function; prophylaxis with drugs that can improve gastric mucosal blood flow may be more effective than with antacids.\r"

  ".U": "88108719\r", 
  ".W": "Diabetic nephropathy is the main cause of the increased morbidity and mortality in patients with insulin dependent diabetes. The prevalence of microalbuminuria was determined in adults with insulin dependent diabetes of five or more years' duration that had started before the age of 41. All eligible patients (n = 982) attending a diabetes clinic were asked to collect a 24 hour urine sample for analysis of albumin excretion by radioimmunoassay; 957 patients complied. Normoalbuminuria was defined as urinary albumin excretion of less than or equal to 30 mg/24 h (n = 562), microalbuminuria as 31-299 mg/24 h (n = 215), and macroalbuminuria as greater than or equal to 300 mg/24 h (n = 180). The prevalence of microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria was significantly higher in patients whose diabetes had developed before rather than after the age of 20. The prevalence of arterial hypertension increased with increased albuminuria, being 19%, 30%, and 65% in patients with normoalbuminuria, microalbuminuria, and macroalbuminuria respectively. The prevalence of proliferative retinopathy and blindness rose with increasing albuminuria, being 12% and 1.4%, respectively, in patients with normoalbuminuria, 28% and 5.6% in those with microalbuminuria and 58% and 10.6% in those with macroalbuminuria. An abnormal vibratory perception threshold was more common in patients with microalbuminuria (31%) and macroalbuminuria (50%) than in those with normoalbuminuria (21%). This study found a high prevalence (22%) of microalbuminuria, which is predictive of the later development of diabetic nephropathy. Microalbuminuria is also characterised by an increased prevalence of arterial hypertension, proliferative retinopathy, blindness, and peripheral neuropathy. Thus, urinary excretion of albumin should be monitored routinely in patients with insulin dependent diabetes.\r"

The 10 men and their partners were instructed how to use the device, which uses suction to induce penile engorgement and maintains erection with a constriction band. After three months they answered a questionnaire about its effectiveness and acceptability, assessing these by visual analogue scales. All the patients achieved lasting erections with the device and gave high mean scores for ease of use, effectiveness, and satisfaction, but three partners refused to complete the questionnaire having failed to come to terms with using the device. One couple stopped using it because of marital disharmony. This device provides a practical alternative for the treatment of erectile impotence in diabetic men. Unlike invasive treatments, it does not necessitate lengthy assessments of autonomic, endocrine, and erectile function and is safe to use and relatively cheap.\r"

The outcome for the 181 survivors was examined six or more years after diagnosis to assess morbidity in an unselected group of long term survivors. One hundred and thirty seven of the survivors were in first remission and probably cured (group I). Forty four (group II) had had one or more relapses, some of whom, who had isolated extramedullary relapses, also have a good chance of cure. In group I 136 patients had prophylactic cranial or craniospinal irradiation, while patients in group II, in addition to having that treatment, received local testicular (17) or craniospinal radiation (seven) for testicular or central nervous system relapse. Eight had additional prophylactic cranial radiotherapy after bone marrow relapse, and six had total body irradiation before bone marrow transplantation. The incidence of clinically important growth and endocrine morbidity was 20% in group I and 68% in group II. The morbidity in patients in group I was mainly attributable to early pubertal maturation. In group II 30 patients had growth failure, of whom 19 had gonadal failure from testicular or total body irradiation, 14 had growth hormone deficiency after doses of cranial irradiation of over 2400 cGy, and 10 had spinal growth impairment after craniospinal irradiation. Two also had early pubertal maturation. Five out of six patients who received total body irradiation had multiple endocrine deficiency. Neuropsychological sequelae of treatment were seen in 40 (42%) of 96 schoolchildren in group I and in 12 (38%) of 32 schoolchildren in group II. Postinfective sequelae of treatment were found in patients in both groups. These results show that the survivors who were in their first remission had a 42% residual morbidity related to treatment compared with an 82% morbidity in the survivors of one or more relapses who had multiple treatments.\r"

A total of 168 patients requiring large bowel investigation were therefore randomised to undergo either rigid sigmoidoscopy plus double contrast barium enema examination or total colonoscopy. Disease was found in 56 patients, including 14 with a carcinoma, 11 with polyps, and 16 with inflammatory bowel disease, the remainder having diverticular disease alone. Of the 89 patients allocated to double contrast barium enema examination, nine required a subsequent colonoscopy for suspected tumour or polyps, three because of incomplete radiological examination, and 12 for rectal bleeding for which no cause was found at the radiological examination. In 16 patients this yielded further information or altered treatment. Of the 79 patients undergoing total colonoscopy, only six required subsequent radiology. As both procedures were well tolerated with no major complications total colonoscopy may be the preferred initial investigation where facilities allow.\r"

Extra clerical staff were needed to implement the new recording and monitoring procedures introduced. With rigorous monitoring and organisation general practitioners may improve the uptake of preventive health care by their more deprived patients.\r"

  ".W": "The dynamic changes in blood gases in 34 dogs suffering severe steam inhalation injury were studied during the first 14 days post-burn to determine the effects of inhalation injury on lung function. Nineteen dogs received only severe steam inhalation injury, while 15 other dogs received both 30 per cent total body surface area (TBSA) deep burns and steam inhalation injury. The results showed marked reductions of PaO2, PaCO2, AB, SBE, T-CO2, SB, BBp, pHNR and SatO2 (P less than 0.05 approximately 0.01), whereas the P(A-a)O2 increased (P less than 0.05 approximately 0.01) within week 1 post-burn in both groups. These data suggest that the injured animals were suffering from hypoxaemia and respiratory alkalosis induced by disturbance of the gas-exchange function of the lungs. There was also metabolic acidosis, which was closely related to high fever, excessive catabolism, and particularly to hypoxaemia in week 1 post-burn. If the animals survived through the critical period (1-7 days post-burn), most of the abnormal gas parameters then gradually returned to the pre-burn levels. It is clear, therefore, that blood gas monitoring in patients with inhalation injury is not only of diagnostic importance but also of prognostic value.\r"

  ".W": "When tumor cells develop in healthy adults, they activate the cellular immune system--natural killer (NK) cells, antigen-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL), and the synthesis of antigen specific cytotoxic antibodies. These are aimed at killing the intruding cells. However, in cancer patients the tumor continues to grow. As tumor cells proliferate, they were shown to release factors that mediate the inactivation of the host immune defense systems. The study documented in this article examined peripheral blood lymphocytes, mononuclear cells (MNC), NK cells, T-helper cells (THC). This study confirmed the interaction of the released inhibitor factors with these mononuclear cells. NULL cells from healthy adults responding to interleukin-2 (IL-2) and NILL cells from patients with metastatic breast carcinoma nonresponsive to IL-2 were also isolated by the standard antibodies-pinning technique. The cells were obtained from age-matched subjects: ten healthy adults; ten patients each from Stage I, II, III, and IV metastatic breast carcinoma (BCa-I, BCa-II, BCa-III, and BCa-IV or MBCa); and ten patients with benign breast disease (BBD). The responsiveness of these THC, PBMNC, NK, NULL, and NILL cells in vitro to graded levels of phytohemagglutinin (PHA), Concanavalin A (Con A), and recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) was examined. Responsiveness was monitored by 3H-thymidine (3H-TdR) uptake, production and release of IL-2, interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R), and cytotoxic activities against K-562 cells and breast carcinoma short-term cell lines. A lack of functional IL-2R in peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with metastatic breast carcinoma was confirmed by nonsignificant anti-Tac antibody binding. An elevation in the expression of cell surface antigen GP-120 has been observed to be associated with the activation in vitro of T-cells from healthy adults and from patients with benign breast disease, but not of T-cells from patients with breast carcinoma. Biochemical studies of the GP-120 using high performance liquid chromatography combined with nitrocellulose blotting confirmed that the glycoprotein was resistant to trypsin and chymotrypsin, but susceptible to pronase. It contained sialic acid and lactosaminoglycan as O-linked sugars. It could be labeled with pariodate/NaB(3H4) and is recognized by MAbT-305 monoclonal antibodies. It contained sialic acid linked (2---3) to galactose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Although the origin of acute leukemia with the 4;11 translocation has been shown to be an early myeloid progenitor cell or a stem cell with the potential for differentiation into both lymphoid and myeloid lineage, few precise studies on acute leukemia with the 11;19 translocation have thus far been reported. This study focused on the clinical, morphologic, ultrastructural, and immunologic characteristics as well as the DNA in three cases of acute leukemia with the 11;19 translocation. All three patients were infants and showed hyperleukocytosis. The morphologic feature was French-American-British (FAB)-L2 in two patients, in one of which a few monocytoid blasts were also seen by electron microscopy. Cells from the third patient underwent morphologic changes from FAB-L2 at the time of diagnosis to M5b at relapse. Immunologic marker studies revealed that the blast cells from all three patients expressed Ia and B4, but none expressed B1, CALLA(J5), T antigens, or SIg. Cells from one patient simultaneously expressed myeloid antigen (MCS-II) both at diagnosis and relapse. Cells from two patients expressed myeloid antigen after being cultured for a short time in vitro. An analysis of immunoglobulin genes and T-cell receptor genes revealed rearrangements of the heavy chain genes and germ line configurations of the kappa and lambda light chain genes, and of the T-cell receptor beta chain genes. These findings suggest that acute leukemia with the 11;19 translocation has mixed lineage characteristics as a result of leukemogenesis in a stem cell with the potential for both lymphoid and myeloid, especially monocytic, differentiation.\r"

Monoclonal antibody A7, from a mouse splenocyte immunized against human colon cancer, was used as a drug carrier for colon cancer. The anti-cancer drugs mitomycin C (MMC) and neocarzinostatin (NCS) were bound covalently to A7 to form the conjugates A7-MMC and A7-NCS. The in vitro cytotoxic effects of the conjugates on SW1116 cells were stronger than those on free MMC or NCS. The conjugate A7-NCS, when administered to nude mice, brought about the highest NCS tumor concentration, whereas normal immunoglobulin G (IgG)-NCS distributed evenly in all tissues. The conjugates showed a strong antitumor effect on colon cancer transplanted into nude mice. Forty-one patients with colorectal cancer, including ten patients with postoperative metastasis, were given A7-NCS. The immunoperoxidase and drug concentration studies of the resected specimens showed that NCS was localized specifically in cancer. Patients receiving the conjugate did not experience serious adverse effects. Of the eight patients with postoperative liver metastasis, three showed evidence of tumor reduction on computed tomography (CT) scan and three claimed pain relief. The conjugate did not benefit patients with multiple lung metastasis or peritoneal metastasis.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to determine whether atherosclerosis impairs relaxations mediated by endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) in human coronary arteries. Epicardial coronary arteries were obtained from the hearts of cardiac transplantation patients with or without histologically documented coronary atherosclerosis (atherosclerotic arteries were from patients aged 42-55 years, nonatherosclerotic arteries were from patients aged 14-24 years). Transverse strip preparations were mounted in organ baths for isometric tension recording. Tension was induced with prostaglandins F2 alpha. Indomethacin (10(-5) M) was present to prevent possible interference from endogenously formed prostaglandins. The EDRF-mediated relaxations in response to substance P (10(-10) to 10(-8) M), bradykinin (10(-9) to 10(-7) M), and Ca2+-ionophore A23187 (10(-9) to 10(-7) M) were significantly attenuated in atherosclerotic arteries. In deendothelialized tissues these compounds had no effect. In contrast, endothelium-independent relaxations induced by isoprenaline (10(-7) to 10(-5) M) were not affected by atherosclerosis. Atherosclerotic arteries showed also normal relaxations with high concentrations of glyceryl trinitrate (10(-8) to 10(-7) M), but reduced relaxations with a lower concentration of the compound (10(-9) M). Acetylcholine (10(-7) to 10(-6) M) only produced endothelium-dependent relaxations in 8 of 60 arterial preparations (with or without atherosclerosis). In most of the arteries, it was a direct vasoconstrictor (which may have masked EDRF release in many cases). Omission of indomethacin from the bath solution increased the incidence of moderate acetylcholine-induced relaxations (9 of 16 preparations). It is concluded that atherosclerosis attenuates EDRF-mediated vasospasm and myocardial ischemia.\r"

The present investigations used 6 open-chest anesthetized dogs to evaluate the role of atrial pressure versus atrial stretch, the latter determined by atrial transmural pressure, in the release of ANF. In a paired design, animals underwent cardiac tamponade followed by constriction of the aorta and pulmonary artery. Tamponade produces a balanced increase in intra-atrial and pericardial pressures. Thus, despite an elevated atrial pressure, there is no increase in transmural pressure producing atrial stretch. Great artery constriction increases intra-atrial but not pericardial pressure, resulting in an increase in atrial transmural pressure and atrial stretch. Cardiac tamponade increased right atrial pressure (0.8 +/- 0.3 to G.6 +/- 0.6 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (3.7 +/- 0.6 to 8.8 +/- 0.6 mm Hg, P less than 0.001). Constriction of the aorta and pulmonary artery also increased right atrial pressure (1.5 +/- 0.8 to 6.3 +/- 0.8 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (4.6 +/- 0.3 to 7.8 +/- 1.0 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). Atrial transmural pressure increased only during great artery constriction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effects of chronic constriction of the thoracic inferior vena cava (TIVCC) on plasma atrial natriuretic factor (pANF) were studied in conscious dogs (n = 5). TIVCC decreased left and right atrial pressure and led to a decrease in pANF concentration from 199 +/- 12 to 104 +/- 14 pg/ml while plasma renin and vasopressin concentrations increased. These hormonal changes were associated with a significant fall in sodium excretion to less than 5 meg/day. pANF remained suppressed during chronic TIVCC as the dogs expanded their extracellular fluid volume and developed ascites. Acute release of TIVCC resulted in abrupt increases in left and right atrial pressure but only a modest rise in pANF from 96 +/- 16 to 185 +/- 45 pg/ml. The magnitude of the rise in pANF (twofold) contrasted sharply with the eightfold increase in sodium excretion that occurred over the first 24 hours. Our data suggest that decrease in atrial pressure below normal results in a decline in pANF, which, acting in concert with the activated renin-angiotensin system and vasopressin, may contribute to sodium retention. On the other hand, during acute release of TIVCC, which markedly increased atrial pressure and sodium excretion, pANF only returned to control levels. These data suggest that ANF release may be attenuated during chronic reduction in atrial pressure and also raise a question concerning the magnitude of the primary role of ANF in this natriuretic response.\r"

[3H]InsP3 and [3H]InsP2 are significantly elevated within 10 seconds of carbachol addition, while there is a lag in the accumulation of [3H]InsP. The time courses of the formation of the inositol phosphates suggest that carbachol activates a polyphosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C resulting in the formation of InsP3, which is subsequently metabolized to InsP2 and InsP. High-performance liquid chromotography analysis demonstrates the formation of both naturally occurring InsP3 isomers (Ins-1,4,5-P3 and Ins-1,3,4,-P3) and of inositol tetrakisphosphate (InsP4) as well. To investigate whether a guanine nucleotide-binding protein couples receptor stimulation to phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis in the heart, we developed a saponin-permeabilized cell preparation that would allow external manipulation of the intracellular guanosine triphosphate (GTP) concentration. In the permeabilized cell preparation, guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) stimulates the accumulation of [3H]InsP, [3H]InsP2, [3H]InsP3, and [3H]InsP4. The effect of GTP gamma S is half-maximal at 1 microM and maximal above 100 microM. In contrast, GTP gamma S is ineffective in promoting PI hydrolysis in the nonpermeabilized cell except at high concentrations. Other guanine nucleotides also lead to the accumulation of [3H]InsP in the permeabilized cell, while 5'-adenylylimidodiphosphate does not. Carbachol also stimulates PI hydrolysis in the permeabilized cell preparation although it is less effective than in the intact cell.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We previously have shown that alpha-adrenergic stimulation of canine Purkinje fibers and rat ventricle decreases automaticity. Experiments on rat ventricular myocytes in tissue culture have suggested that the decrease in automaticity induced by alpha-adrenergic stimulation depends on the development of sympathetic innervation and the presence of a pertussis toxin-sensitive, 41-kDa guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-regulatory protein. In the present study, microelectrode and biochemical techniques were used to test the role of the pertussis toxin-sensitive protein and sympathetic innervation in modulating automaticity of adult canine Purkinje fibers. Fibers were incubated in Tyrode's solution alone or in Tyrode's solution plus pertussis toxin (0.1-0.5 microgram/ml) for 24 hours and were then superfused with phenylephrine. Phenylephrine in the 5 x 10(-9)-5 x 10(-8) M range induced a decrease in automaticity in 63% of the 16 fibers not treated with pertussis toxin and an increase in automaticity in 37%. The former group had a higher level of pertussis toxin-sensitive substrate by the [32P]nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylation assay than the latter. In contrast, all fibers treated with pertussis toxin (0.5 microgram/ml) showed increased automaticity in response to phenylephrine and had no detectable pertussis toxin-sensitive substrate. Over the range of pertussis toxin concentrations studied, there was a smooth concentration-response relation between the substrate levels measured and the automatic response to phenylephrine. As ADP-ribosylatable substrate levels decreased, the percent of fibers showing an increase in automaticity increased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Outward currents were minimized by replacement of Cs+ -rich solution in the pipette and 20 mM tetraethylammonium in the bath. The ICa was evoked by command pulses of above -30 mV, and the maximum amplitude was obtained at about 0 mV. This ICa was dose dependently inhibited by increases in the [Ca2+]i above 30 nM. The Kd value of the [Ca2+]i required to inhibit the ICa was about 100 nM. The Ba2+ current was also inhibited by increases in the [Ca2+]i. Conversely, perfusion of Ba2+ into the cell up to 100 microM did not suppress the ICa. Changes in the [Ca2+]i did not modify the steady-state inactivation curve. The inhibition of the ICa evoked by the test pulse is most prominent when the preceding influx of Ca2+ during the conditioning pulse was large, as estimated using a double pulse protocol. This inhibition was proportionally reduced by increases in the concentration of the Ca2+ chelator, ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA). Therefore, the Ca2+ -dependent inactivation of the Ca2+ channel may contribute toward regulating [Ca2+]i in smooth muscle cells of the rabbit portal vein.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the role of extra-atrial atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in volume and blood pressure regulation, the plasma, atrial, ventricular, and hypothalamic levels of immunoreactive atrial natriuretic peptide (IR-ANP) were measured simultaneously in the spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) at the ages of 2, 6, and 12 months. Plasma IR-ANP in the 12-month-old, conscious SHR was significantly higher than that of the WKY (300 +/- 18 versus 200 +/- 20 pg/ml, p less than 0.05, n = 9), while no differences in plasma IR-ANP levels were found between the strains in younger rats. Acute volume expansion with saline (1.1 ml/100 g body wt) in hypertensive as well as in normotensive rats resulted in marked increases in right atrial pressure and plasma IR-ANP concentration. The older SHR had attenuated ANP release to volume loading as shown by the shift of the ANP versus right atrial pressure curve to the right. Right auricular IR-ANP concentration decreased, while that of left auricle increased with increasing age in both strains. No substantial differences were noted in auricular ANP concentration between SHR and WKY. However, the total atrial IR-ANP content (micrograms/atria) was consistently lower in SHR compared with WKY. In both ventricles, IR-ANP concentrations and contents increased with increasing age in WKY and SHR, but the ventricular levels of ANP were reduced in ventricles of the SHR heart compared with normotensive controls. The depletion of total ventricular IR-ANP was greatest in SHR with greatest ventricular hypertrophy and coincided with the attenuated ANP release to acute volume load. The increase of left but not right ventricular weight occurring secondary to 6 weeks minoxidil treatment was accompanied by higher ANP concentration in both strains. In contrast to the ventricles, the hypothalamic IR-ANP concentration was significantly increased in SHR compared with that of WKY and decreased in both strains after 6 weeks' treatment with antihypertensive drugs. Thus, ventricular and hypothalamic, as well as atrial, ANP respond to increased pressure overload in genetically hypertensive rats. Our results suggest that chronic stimulation of ANP release from ventricles is associated with depleted stores of ANP from both ventricles and reduced response to acute volume load. Our findings that ventricular ANP increased with increasing weight and in response to a hypertrophic stimulus in WKY and was decreased in SHR with severe ventricular hypertrophy suggest that ANP may locally have an inhibitory effect on the development of cardiac hypertrophy.\r"

  ".U": "88109890\r", 
  ".W": "Although encainide is an effective antiarrhythmic agent, plasma concentrations and pharmacologic effects are not well correlated. One explanation is the generation of active metabolites: while in most patients (extensive metabolizers; EMs) concentrations of the metabolites O-desmethyl encainide (ODE) and 3-methoxy-O-desmethyl encainide (3MODE) are higher than those of encainide, a small subset (poor metabolizers; PMs) lack the ability to extensively biotransform encainide. Considerable data from studies in vitro and animal studies, as well as indirect evidence in patients, indicate that ODE and 3MODE produce the effects seen during long-term encainide therapy in EMs. We now report the initial direct evaluation of the pharmacologic actions of these metabolites of encainide in man. Nine patients with ventricular arrhythmias, seven of the EM phenotype and two of the PM phenotype, were studied. Chronic high-frequency ventricular arrhythmias were suppressed by encainide therapy in seven of nine; monitoring arrhythmia frequency during withdrawal of encainide allowed definition of plasma concentrations of encainide and metabolites associated with arrhythmia suppression. Intravenous infusions of both ODE and 3MODE suppressed chronic ventricular arrhythmias, while infusions of placebo had no effect. ODE clearance was a function of metabolizer phenotype, with higher clearance (mean 914 ml/min; range 554 to 1,314) in EMs than in PMs (434, 298 ml/min); moreover, 3MODE was detected during ODE infusions in all seven EMs but in neither PM. 3MODE clearance was more uniform (mean 289 ml/min in EMs [range 180-410] vs 300 and 78 ml/min in the two PMs) and ODE was not detected in any subject during 3MODE infusion. Encainide itself was not detected after any infusion of ODE or 3MODE. During withdrawal of encainide therapy, ODE plasma concentration at the time of arrhythmia recurrence was 55 +/- 40 ng/ml (mean +/- SD), while ODE by infusion was effective at a concentration of 37 +/- 15 ng/ml. Similarly, plasma concentration of 3MODE at the time of arrhythmia recurrence after withdrawal of chronic encainide was 116 +/- 35 ng/ml and that during 3MODE infusion was 105 +/- 50 ng/ml. While both compounds prolonged QRS duration, ODE was the more potent, increasing QRS by 9.2 +/- 1.6% per 100 ng/ml vs 1.2 +/- 0.5% per 100 ng/ml for 3MODE. On the other hand, 3MODE prolonged the corrected JT interval by 1.9 +/- 0.6% per 100 ng/ml, while ODE shortened it by 2.7 +/- 1.9% per 100 ng/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In an animal preparation of congestive heart failure in the dog, during the development of cardiac failure due to rapid right ventricular pacing we observed significant decreases in cardiac output and arterial pressure and increases in pulmonary arterial and right atrial pressure. We also observed a related increase in right atrial pressure and increases in plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (c-GMP). Ultrastructure changes in the atrial myoendocrine cells indicated extreme stimulation of the secretory apparatus of ANP. The response of hemodynamic, renal, and hormonal variables was investigated after incremental infusions (0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.06 microgram/kg/min) of exogenous ANP. In healthy animals ANP significantly decreased mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, stroke volume, and right atrial pressure without changing heart rate or peripheral vascular resistance. As expected, we found a striking increase in urine flow and urinary excretion of sodium, chloride, magnesium and calcium and a smaller increase in potassium excretion. ANP suppressed renin secretion, and increased renal plasma flow, glomerular filtration rate, and filtration fraction. In dogs with heart failure ANP caused a small reduction in mean arterial pressure. No effect was seen on other hemodynamic variables or plasma renin concentration. The excretory effects on the kidneys were completely absent, and smaller increases in glomerular filtration rate and filtration fraction were observed. We found no difference between healthy dogs and animals with heart failure with respect to the secretion of c-GMP during ANP infusions in relation to the plasma levels of ANP. This suggests an intracellular defect that prevents the mediation of the hormonal signal into biological action in the presence of heart failure.\r"

Administration of etidronate by mouth (700-1400 mg daily for 1 month) or its intravenous infusion (300 mg daily for 5 days) decreased bone resorption as judged by urinary excretion of hydroxyproline and significantly increased renal tubular reabsorption of phosphate. No significant change in serum activity of alkaline phosphatase was noted with either regimen. 3. When etidronate was given by mouth there was a progressive decrease in fasting urinary calcium excretion and a rise in serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3]. In contrast, intravenous etidronate decreased serum values of 1,25-(OH)2D3 and was associated with a progressive increase in fasting calcium excretion, suggesting a decrease in the net influx of calcium from the extracellular compartment to bone. Significant inverse correlations were noted between the change induced in 1,25-(OH)2D3 values at 2 weeks and the changes in serum calcium, phosphate and fasting urinary excretion of calcium. 4. These observations suggest that the different effects of intravenous and oral etidronate on 1,25-(OH)2D3 values are a consequence of different doses of etidronate used and the different effects of these regimens on the accretion of calcium into bone.\r"

To test the influence of a sodium (Na+) stimulus within the central nervous system on the release of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), we examined the effects of intracerebroventricular infusion of high Na+ artificial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on blood pressure, urinary Na+ excretion and plasma ANP levels in conscious Wistar rats. 2. Infusion of high Na+ (0.6 mol/l) CSF into the lateral ventricle at a rate of 1 microliter/min for 60 min significantly increased mean blood pressure and urinary Na+ excretion, while normal Na+ (0.15 mol/l) CSF had no effects. Plasma ANP levels were higher in the high Na+ CSF group than in the normal Na+ group (154 +/- 39 vs 52 +/- 19 pmol/l, P less than 0.05). 3. Interruption of the sympathetic nervous system and the vascular action of vasopressin with intravenous hexamethonium and d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)arginine vasopressin attenuated the pressor and natriuretic responses to intracerebroventricular high Na+ CSF. Plasma ANP levels in these rats did not differ significantly from those in rats which were similarly treated but were given normal Na+ CSF. 4. These results indicate that elevation of the CSF Na+ concentration without peripheral volume loading can stimulate ANP release into the circulation. ANP release due to central Na+ stimulus appears to be mediated by the sympathetic nervous system, vasopressin, and/or haemodynamic change caused by these factors.\r"

The density of these binding sites for ANP on platelets is decreased after increased dietary sodium intake, when plasma ANP levels increase. ANP-binding sites were investigated in patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF), a condition in which there is an increase in the concentration of ANP in plasma. 2. In 24 patients with a clinical diagnosis of functional class III-IV CHF, plasma ANP (90.3 +/- 13.4 fmol/ml, mean +/- SEM) was significantly higher (P less than 0.001) than in 16 age-matched patients without cardiac disease (15.4 +/- 2.0 fmol/ml). The density of ANP-binding sites on platelets was significantly lower (P less than 0.01) in the 24 CHF patients (6.3 +/- 0.8 fmol/10(9) cells) than in the non-cardiac patients (11.8 +/- 1.4 fmol/10(9) cells). There was no significant difference in affinity of the ANP-binding sites between both groups. There was a significant non-linear inverse correlation of the density of ANP-binding sites on platelets with plasma ANP concentration. These results could not be explained by prior receptor occupancy secondary to the elevated concentration of circulating ANP. 3. In conclusion, ANP-binding sites on platelets are decreased in patients with severe CHF and with significantly elevated concentration of ANP in plasma.\r"

The analysis took into account the absolute value of APACHE II score of each day and the rate of change relative to that of the previous day. One hundred consecutive adult ICU admissions were used to determine the criteria that were tested on the following 112 consecutive adult ICU admissions. Daily APACHE II scores identified correctly 16 of the 34 patients who died. A second set of criteria was next derived by raising the values of the original limits in order to build-in greater margins of safety without too great a loss of sensitivity. The predictive power of daily APACHE II scores using the second set of criteria was superior to that of a single APACHE II score by a factor of 4. Predictions were not used to influence clinical decision-making during this study.\r"

While SIRs have the advantage of being simple to use and, therefore, require minimal training, recent research has demonstrated significant drawbacks to these devices. These drawbacks have included their large physical size, the tendency of such devices to cause significant hyperventilation, and the extreme variability of pressures necessary to activate the pop-off valve safety feature. This latter problem is especially serious in the infant where large pressure variations may increase the potential for pulmonary barotrauma. In an attempt to minimize the disadvantages of SIRs, we developed a prototype volume-controlled resuscitation device (VCD). We then compared the VCD to the SIRs in a cat model using blinded volunteer health care personnel previously familiar with SIRs only. Ventilation of the cat with the VCD yielded arterial and end-tidal CO2 values more closely resembling the physiologic state at a lower mean airway pressure. The data suggest that a human trial of manual ventilation with the prototype VCD is warranted.\r"

The best ventilator settings for CO2 elimination during high-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) have not been so clearly defined. A recent study has suggested that eucarbia will be obtained with HFJV when tidal volume (VT) per kg of body weight is kept within a narrow, well-defined range. In the same study, a \"bench test\" demonstrated that VT was directly proportional to the jet ventilator driving pressure (DP). The goal of our study was to confirm this recommended VT/kg to obtain eucarbia and to determine whether the relation observed between VT and DP in the laboratory was true clinically. We studied 14 patients admitted to the ICU for postoperative support. We determined a good correlation between DP and VT/kg (r = .811, p less than .001) for the group as a whole and a good inverse correlation between DP or VT/kg and PaCO2 for most individual patients; however, there was a poor inverse correlation between DP or VT/kg and PaCO2 for the group as a whole, due to wide patient-to-patient variation in the efficiency of jet ventilation. We conclude that there is no universal formula for setting jet ventilator DP or VT/kg to affect normocarbia in humans.\r"

This study demonstrated that samples of arterial blood may be obtained by radial arterial puncture both at rest and during exercise in practically all cases without morbidity. Samples from arterial needle puncture provide the same results as those from arterial cannulas. In the very rare patient in whom arterial puncture during maximal exercise is unsuccessful, the arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2) measured at 10 seconds after exercise correlates very well with the PaO2 at maximal exercise, and the 15-second value correlates nearly as well. Arterial cannulas are needed in the infrequent case when arterial puncture is not accomplished during maximal exercise and the 10-second or 15-second PaO2 decreases from the resting value. In this instance, determination of the exact extent of the hypoxemia requires an exercise sample obtained by cannula; however, the decrease in PaO2 obtained by arterial needle puncture at 10 or 15 seconds will be all that is needed many times to make a clinical decision. Values obtained at 20 seconds after maximal exercise reflect less of the exercise measurement and cannot be used; however, all episodes of significant hypoxemia (PaO2 less than 60 mm Hg) were captured by the analysis at 20 seconds after exercise.\r"

Patients with malignant pleural effusions, nonspecific pleural effusion, parapneumonic effusions and pleural transudates had low levels. The IFN gamma levels were higher in those with massive tuberculous effusion and apparent pulmonary lesion on x-ray film. We found that the T4/T8 lymphocyte ratio was higher in pleural fluid than in peripheral blood. Numbers of T3 and T4 lymphocytes were higher in tuberculous pleural effusions compared with those in other patients. There is no correlation between IFN gamma levels and lymphocyte subsets in pleural effusion. Perhaps pleural T-lymphocytes produce IFN gamma after stimulation by mycobacterial antigens and this lymphokine activates macrophages, increasing their bactericidal activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.\r"

Indications for bronchoscopy as a diagnostic tool for PT may include: (a) patients suspected of having PT with negative smears and in whom treatment must be started due to clinical status; (b) suspicion of associated neoplasia; (c) selected patients with negative Lowenstein cultures; (d) lack of material being obtained by simpler methods.\r"

We found a significant increase of ammonia, phenols, and indican and a significant decrease of glucuronic acid and urea synthesis rate parallel to the stage of CAH without LC. In 34 CAH patients with complete recovery, a retrospective 10-year follow-up was possible. Parallel to the normalization of liver morphology and general liver tests, detoxification parameters also normalized. However, the detoxification disorders in CAH without LC are mild in nature and do not produce hepatic encephalopathy. Probably, they are caused by a reduced synthesis of the urea-cycle enzymes and of glucuronyltransferase in the liver.\r"

  ".W": "Pylorus ligation changed the morphology and location of gastric lesions induced by water-immersion stress (WI stress) in rats; linear lesions in the corpus mucosa disappeared, and punctate lesions appeared in both the corpus and antrum, in association with the loss of H+ and the gain of Na+ in the gastric contents. Oral administration of antipeptic drugs such as amylopectin sulfate and sulfated glyptide or porcine pepsin significantly prevented or aggravated the lesions, respectively, although another type of elongated lesion appeared in response to high doses of antipeptic drugs. These antipeptic drugs or exogenous pepsin significantly reduced or increased pepsin activity, respectively, without effect on the acid output. Similar punctate lesions were produced in the atropinized rats (10 mg/kg) by instillation of acid solution (100 mM HCl plus 54 mM NaCl) with pepsin into the pylorus-ligated stomach and subjecting to WI stress. On the other hand, when the gastric contents were drained through a fistula to prevent accumulation of gastric juice in the pylorus-ligated stomach, WI stress again induced linear lesions only in the corpus mucosa. Acid hypersecretion in these rats induced by intravenous infusion of histamine, tetragastrin, or carbachol significantly aggravated the severity of lesions but did not change their morphology. These results suggest that pepsin in the presence of acid is prerequisite for development of gastric lesions in pylorus-ligated rats induced by WI stress. The morphological alterations may be accounted for by the distensions of the stomach due to accumulation of gastric juice in the lumen caused by pylorus ligation, but not due to acid hypersecretion.\r"

In this study, the role of food in the appearance of these peptides was assessed. The results show that after resection, rats nourished intravenously demonstrated neither a significant adaptation nor any of the detectable mucosal mitogens, whereas the rats nourished intragastrically demonstrated both hyperplasia and the mitogenic peptide(s). The association of the hyperplasia with the appearance of the mitogenic peptides in the small intestine suggests that they are important in the mechanism by which food promotes the adaptive hyperplasia.\r"

No clear relationship between sialic acid and hydrochloric acid outputs was observed; in contrast, close positive significant correlations were noted between sialic acid and pepsin outputs: r and P values ranging, respectively, from 0.82 to 0.63 and from less than 0.001 to less than 0.02. Measurement of sialic acid output content in basal secretion could thus serve to assess mucus glycoprotein output which appears, in large part, related to gastric juice proteolytic activity.\r"

The treatment periods were followed by 1 mo of placebo. The sulfonylurea dose was increased to achieve fasting plasma glucose levels less than 9 mM or to a total maximum daily dose of 25 mg. The mean final doses of glyburide (14.7 +/- 2.4 mg/day) and glipizide (15.2 +/- 2.2 mg/day) were similar. Postprandial (postdose) glipizide levels were higher than those of glyburide, whereas fasting (predose) glyburide concentrations were higher than those of glipizide. Both treatments improved glucose control by 25% compared with placebo. Glipizide therapy evoked higher postprandial insulin concentrations than did glyburide, whereas basal insulin concentrations were higher during glyburide. Insulin sensitivity, assessed by an insulin tolerance test, was more improved with glyburide than with glipizide. In conclusion, overall glucose control is similarly improved by glyburide and glipizide. However, glipizide amplifies the plasma insulin response to meals more than glyburide, whereas glyburide enhances basal insulin secretion more than glipizide. Both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors may contribute to these differences.\r"

Of the clinical characteristics present before the onset of treatment with an insulin pump, the most important variable to predict a future decision to terminate CSII was pregnancy, followed by female gender. In addition, there was a greater percentage of smokers, single or divorced patients, and patients with a history of treatment for mental illness in the dropout group, although none of these differences was statistically significant. There was no correlation between discontinuation of CSII and age, duration of diabetes, or prepump concentrations of HbA1c. Events occurring during CSII were also analyzed for predictive value. Patients who discontinued CSII had a higher incidence of ketoacidosis and a lower incidence of hypoglycemic coma while using a pump. The most common reason reported by patients for terminating CSII therapy, cited by 24 (47%) of the 51, was discomfort, irritation, or infection at the infusion site.\r"

Other uses include treatment of allergic conjunctivitis and chronic urticaria. Astemizole is not as effective for treatment of acute allergic symptoms because of its delayed onset of action. Astemizole and its active metabolite, desmethylastemizole, have long elimination half-lives permitting once-daily dosing. The incidence of sedation is lower than with conventional antihistamines, but increased appetite and weight gain do occur. Astemizole should be useful for both maintenance and prophylactic therapy in patients with chronic allergic conditions who cannot tolerate the sedative or anticholinergic effects of conventional antihistamines.\r"

These changes were associated with a significant increase in plasma cortisol (P less than 0.05) and smaller increases in plasma ACTH and arginine vasopressin (AVP), but plasma angiotensin II (AII) and aldosterone were unaffected. When hemorrhage (15 ml/kg BW over 10 min) was performed during ANP or control infusions, hypotension was greater (P less than 0.0004) during ANP treatment and the responses of plasma ACTH, AVP, catecholamines, and AII were enhanced compared with those to control hemorrhage. Plasma immunoreactive ANP during ANP infusions was significantly higher after hemorrhage (mean, 833 +/- 46; P less than 0.003), but the disappearance rate after the termination of ANP infusion was the same (3.1 min) with or without hemorrhage. These studies show that ANP infusions, achieving plasma levels observed in pathological states such as congestive heart failure, inhibit the expected responses of plasma AII and aldosterone to mild acute hypotension, but do not inhibit the responses of plasma AVP, ACTH, AII, and aldosterone associated with acute moderate hemorrhage in conscious sheep.\r"

The reduction in the hormone-responsive adenylate cyclase activity was associated with lower levels of beta-catecholamine receptors, without a change in apparent receptor affinity and with lower levels of the GTP-binding proteins Gs and Gi, visualized by NAD-dependent [32P]ADP ribosylation. The reduction in AP was correlated with a decrease in the steady state level of AP mRNA. RA had no effect on cell proliferation or saturation density. Retinoids thus inhibit the same features that are promoted by glucocorticoids in ROS 17/2.8 cells.

That is, the age-dependent decline in responsiveness of Sertoli cells to FSH was reversed during testicular regression. To determine whether this testicular regression-induced restoration of FSH responsiveness was mechanistically a reversal of the age-dependent decline in response, the ability of cholera toxin, forskolin, catecholamines, and pertussis toxin to stimulate cAMP accumulation in Sertoli cells cultured from hamsters undergoing testicular regression was assessed and compared to the responses of Sertoli cells from 18- and 36-day-old hamsters. The age-related decline in responsiveness was evident not only with FSH but also when cells were stimulated with isoproterenol, cholera toxin, forskolin, or pertussis toxin singly or in combination. While the FSH response of Sertoli cells from regressed testes was restored to values indicative of an immature Sertoli cell, the response of the cultured cells to cholera toxin, forskolin, catecholamines, or pertussis toxin either singly or in combination suggested that the adenylate cyclase system of Sertoli cells from regressed testes was unchanged from its \"adult\" activity. Thus, our original hypothesis that testicular regression/recrudescence was a mirror image of sexual maturation was an oversimplification. However, since FSH is the physiological regulator of Sertoli cell function, and its response is restored to levels found in the immature animal during testicular regression and declines to adult levels during testicular recrudescence, our original hypothesis that testicular recrudescence mimics sexual maturation (i.e. the animal goes through \"puberty\" each time it goes through a regression/recrudescence cycle) is still tenable. However, at the molecular level, differences in mechanism exist.\r"

In previous studies on this system of follicles we have shown (1) that the apical surface of the follicle cells is a major site of protein iodination and (2), that H2O2 is produced at the apical cell surface. In the present study we confirmed the previous finding that H2O2 generation is greatly stimulated by the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. We further found that TSH at a high concentration (greater than 10 mU/ml) and in the presence of Ca2+ stimulated H2O2 generation; TSH had no such effect on follicles incubated in Ca2+-free medium after pretreatment with EGTA. Forskolin did not stimulate H2O2 generation. Exocytosis of thyroglobulin was stimulated by TSH at a low concentration (0.1 mU/ml), and this stimulation was not dependent on Ca2+. Exocytosis was also stimulated by forskolin but not by A23187. Iodination of protein, including thyroglobulin, in the incubation medium was stimulated by A23187, TSH and forskolin. These observations suggest that stimulation of iodination in association with the apical surface of the follicle cells can be achieved separately by an increased rate of H2O2 generation and increased rate of exocytosis. Generation of H2O2 is Ca2+-dependent, whereas exocytosis is mediated by the adenylate cyclase-cAMP system; TSH at a high concentration can stimulate both these processes.\r"

  ".W": "In vivo and in vitro studies of beta-adrenergic influences on GH secretion have produced apparently conflicting data in which the in vivo effect seems to be inhibitory and the in vitro effect to be stimulatory. The present studies were designed to observe the in vivo effect of isoproterenol (ISO), a beta-adrenergic agonist, on 1) GH release during a brief interval after intraatrial infusion, and 2) GH release in response to GRF infused 10 min after ISO. ISO was found to stimulate GH release in both intact and hypothalamus-lesioned animals within 2 min after infusion, but GH returned to control levels within 10 min. ISO also profoundly inhibited the release of GH in response to GRF. Pretreatment of animals with somatostatin (SRIF) antiserum prevented the inhibitory action of ISO on GRF-induced GH release. No change in peripheral levels of SRIF was detected. Also, there was no suppression of GRF-induced GH release by ISO when the treatments were applied in vitro to dispersed perifused pituitary cells. These data show that beta-adrenergic systems can stimulate a rapid but brief release of GH in vivo, and that the subsequent inhibitory action on GRF-induced GH release might be by means of SRIF release.\r"

  ".W": "Effects of the administration of phosphate on nuclear 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] uptake by duodenal mucosal cells of Hyp mice were investigated. In Hyp mice fed a high phosphate diet (1.1% Ca and 2.0% phosphate) for 2 weeks, maximal nuclear 1,25-(OH)2D3 binding by duodenal mucosal cells is significantly increased from 5.01 +/- 0.49 x 10(3) to 8.23 +/- 1.10 x 10(3) sites/cell (P less than 0.05). No significant change was observed in normal mice fed the same diet. The serum phosphate concentration of Hyp mice increased significantly (P less than 0.01), whereas no significant change was found in normal mice. On this regimen, serum calcium, urinary cAMP to creatinine ratio, and cytosolic 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor number in Hyp mice were not changed significantly. On the basis of these data, we speculate that the recovery of serum phosphate in Hyp mice fed a high phosphate diet affects the recovery of nuclear 1,25-(OH)2D3 uptake by duodenal mucosal cells. The mechanism for this recovery is not related to either the secondary hyperparathyroidism or the change in cytosolic 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor content but, rather, to increased binding of 1,25-(OH)2D3-receptor complex to nuclei. Hypophosphatemia, therefore, appears to play a role in the vitamin D resistance in Hyp mice.\r"

Granulosa cells were fixed and stained with three fluorochromes that selectively bind to DNA (Hoechst 33342, blue), RNA (pyronin Y, red), or protein (fluorescein isothiocyanate, green). A flow cytometer equipped with a three-laser excitation system was used to analyze three colors of fluorescence from stained cells. Forward angle light scatter and axial light loss measurements were made on each cell to determine relative cell size. In addition, the ratios of RNA to protein and DNA to protein were measured. The major findings obtained from correlated measurements of cell cycle (DNA), protein, RNA, cell size, and ratios were: 1) the percentage of proliferating cells decreased while cell size increased during follicular maturation; 2) two subpopulations of granulosa cells were identified within each follicle based on relatively high and low protein contents; the fraction of cells in the high protein subpopulation increased, and the fraction of cells in the low protein subpopulation decreased during follicular maturation; 3) the high and low protein subpopulations also differed in cell cycle distribution, RNA content, and cell size; and 4) the distribution of cells into the two subpopulations and the degree of proliferation were influenced by stage of the ovulatory cycle, primarily in the most mature follicles. The results demonstrate the dynamic heterogeneity of the granulosa cell populations from individual ovarian follicles and show the influences of follicular maturation and stage of the ovulatory cycle on cell growth and metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the neural mechanism involved in suppression of GH secretion, we examined the effect of electrical stimulation of the midbrain central gray (CG) and several raphe nuclei on human (h) GRF-induced GH secretion in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats. A concentric bipolar stimulating electrode was implanted stereotaxically into each nucleus under pentobarbital anesthesia 1 week before stimulation. Blood samples were taken through a cannula placed in the right atrium via the right external jugular vein. Under pentobarbital anesthesia, 5 micrograms hGRF dissolved in 0.3 ml saline were systemically applied through this cannula. Ten minutes after the infusion, plasma GH was increased from the resting value of 28.5 +/- 7.1 ng/ml (mean +/- SE) to 686.1 +/- 62.0 ng/ml. Biphasic electrical stimulation was delivered for the first 10 min. When the CG was stimulated with a current of 500 microA, hGRF-induced GH secretion was markedly suppressed. However, even when the stimulation site was outside the CG, hGRF-induced GH secretion was suppressed. But with a smaller current (100 microA) the suppressive effect was observed only when the medial portion of the CG was stimulated. This suppression was abolished by prior lesioning of the hypothalamic periventricular nucleus (Pe), in which most of the somatostatin-immunoreactive fibers in the median eminence originate. The stimulation of the dorsal raphe with a current of 500 microA suppressed the GH increment at 10 min, but no suppression occurred with a current of 100 microA. This suppression was abolished by prior lesioning of the Pe. Electrical stimulation of the rest of the raphe nuclei had no effect on hGRF-induced GH secretion. These results suggest that electrical stimulation of the CG suppresses hGRF-induced GH secretion, and the most effective area is the ventromedial portion of the CG. These suppressive actions may be achieved by activation of the somatostatin neurons in the Pe.\r"

  ".U": "88111408\r", 
  ".W": "alpha 1-Adrenergic agonists have recently been found to potentiate vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) stimulation of rat pinealocyte cAMP and cGMP. alpha 1-Adrenergic agonists also elevate pineal intracellular Ca2+ [( Ca2+]i) and activate protein kinase-C. In the present study, the possible involvement of Ca2+ and protein kinase-C in the alpha 1-adrenergic potentiation of VIP-stimulated cAMP and cGMP accumulation was examined with agents that alter [Ca2+]i or activate protein kinase-C. It was found that treatment with a Ca2+ chelator or with inorganic Ca2+ channel blockers inhibited alpha 1-adrenergic potentiation of VIP-stimulated cAMP and cGMP responses. Increasing [Ca2+]i by treatment with A23187, ouabain, or K+ potentiated VIP stimulation of cAMP and cGMP response. These observations indicate that Ca2+ mediates the alpha 1-adrenergic potentiation of VIP-stimulated cAMP and cGMP accumulation, as is true for the alpha 1-adrenergic potentiation of beta-adrenergic stimulated cAMP and cGMP accumulation. Activators of protein kinase-C mimicked the large effect alpha 1-adrenergic agonists have on cAMP accumulation in VIP-treated pinealocytes and had a small effect on cGMP accumulation in VIP-treated cells. These effects were not blocked by the Ca2+ chelator EGTA. However, the effects of a protein kinase-C activator on the cGMP response in VIP-stimulated cells were amplified by K+ (15 mM) or ouabain (1 microM), presumably through an action causing an increase in [Ca2+]i. These results suggest protein kinase-C is involved in the alpha 1-adrenergic potentiation of VIP-stimulated cAMP accumulation, as is the case for the alpha 1-adrenergic potentiation of beta-adrenergic stimulated cAMP. Protein kinase-C is also involved in cGMP accumulation, provided that there is a modest increase in [Ca2+]i.\r"

SCE cultures were established from 20-day-old rats and maintained in SF media supplemented with insulin, transferrin, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and bacitracin. Radioimmunoassayable inhibin was measured using an antibody directed against a synthetic porcine inhibin-alpha (pI alpha) and measured using this same synthetic peptide as well as a highly purified ovine inhibin standard. Results of these determinations are expressed in terms of a synthetic peptide as femtomoles of pI alpha-(1-26)-G-Y-per ml/10(6) cells. Inhibin levels (+/- SEM) that accumulated at this rate in media from control cultures were 184.9 +/- 6.1 and 167.4 +/- 5.2 on days 0-4 and 4-8, respectively. When FSH (oFSH 17; 1-1000 ng/ml) was added, a dose-dependent increase in inhibin levels was significant at all time points beyond the initial 24 h. The simultaneous addition of 2 x 10(-7) M testosterone (T) with low doses of FSH addition of 2 x 10(-7) m testosterone (T) with low doses of FSH suppressed the inhibin response to FSH, but when T was combined with 300 ng/ml FSH, there was no effect of T on inhibin levels compared to FSH alone, regardless of time in culture. In spite of the modest effect of T, androstenedione (A; 2 x 10(-13) to x 10(-5) M) produced a dose-dependent suppression of inhibin levels. This inhibition was also observed at all doses of FSH. The action of A was not due to its conversion to estrogens, as 17 beta-estradiol had no effect on inhibin production by SCE cultures in either the presence or absence of FSH. The effect of EGF, a component of the basal serum-free medium, was next examined; it produced a 1.5-fold higher level of inhibin (188.7 +/- 9.5) compared to cultures without EGF (135.6 +/- 5.0). When SCE cultures were plated with FSH plus EGF, the stimulation of inhibin levels was additive. We conclude that in Sertoli cell cultures established from immature rats (1) the accumulation of inhibin in medium declines from 90 fmol/10(6) cells.day (initial 24 h) to 40-50 fmol/10(6) cells.day (over the first 48 h) and continues to accumulate in the medium for 8 days of culture; (2) FSH regulates the production of inhibin by Sertoli cells; the best dose response is observed over a 3-day period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Granulosa cells from immature hypophysectomized estrogen-treated rats were cultured in the presence of [35S]cysteine. Both conditioned media and cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an antibody directed against the N-terminal 26 amino acids of the alpha-chain of porcine inhibin (pI alpha 1-26), followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and fluorography. Treatment with FSH (100 ng/ml) and delta 4-androstenedione (10(-7) M) increased the secretion of 35S-labeled inhibin immunoreactivity by 2.6-fold over that in control cultures treated with androstenedione alone. The radiolabeled inhibin had mol wt (Mr) values of 45,000 and 30,000. Upon reduction, the 45,000 Mr polypeptide remained (with increased apparent Mr of 49,000), but the 30,000 Mr species disappeared with the concomitant appearance of two bands with 18,000 and 11,000 Mr. Competition studies with pI alpha 1-26 confirmed that these polypeptides were all related to inhibin. Furthermore, immunoblotting with an antibody directed against the porcine inhibin beta-A chain (pI beta A81-113) indicated that the 11,000 Mr peptide was the inhibin beta-A chain. Extracts of cells treated with FSH contained only a high Mr alpha-related species (Mr, 41,000 nonreduced; 49,200 reduced). The inhibin alpha antibody was also used to immunocytochemically stain cultured granulosa cells. Cells that had been treated with FSH or the adenyl cyclase activator forskolin (3 x 10(-5) M), but not untreated cells, exhibited positive staining. These results indicate that granulosa cells synthesize and store inhibin alpha-chain precursor with 49,000 Mr. Although some of the high Mr alpha-form was secreted, the majority of the alpha-subunit was processed to the 18,000 Mr form and dimerized with the 11,000 Mr beta-chain to form the mature inhibin dimer immediately before secretion. The cultured granulosa cells may provide a model for future studies on the hormonal regulation of inhibin alpha- and beta-gene expression as well as subunit dimerization and secretion.\r"

Chronic treatment of these cultures with 17 beta-estradiol and TRH (factors found to alter the amounts of GH and PRL secreted) caused shifts in the overall proportions of GH to PRL secreting cells. Each agent, however, influenced the cultures differently. Estradiol treatment resulted in cultures which contained only mammosomatotropes, whereas TRH treatment resulted in cultures that contained PRL-only cells in addition to the other two functional cell types present in control populations. These results indicate that factors which alter the amounts of GH and PRL secreted by GH3 cultures also change the types of secretors present. Moreover, the manner in which the proportions of dual hormone secretors changed in response to these factors supports the view that multipotential cells serve as a transitional cell type in a conversion from GH to PRL secretors.\r"

Classification of clinically dominant seizure type according to the International Classification of Epileptic Seizures (ICES) was possible in 1,005 cases (82.5%). Fifty-six percent of patients had partial seizures and 26.5% had generalized seizures. Subclassification of partial seizures revealed simple partial seizures (SPS) in 7.5% of the cases, complex partial seizures (CPS) in 23%, and partial secondarily generalized seizures (PSGS) in 25.5% of the cases. Simple partial onset was seen in 56% of the patients with CPS, and impairment of consciousness at the onset occurred in the remaining 44%. PSGS started with simple partial onset in 92% of the cases and the remaining 8% started with a complex partial phase. Tonic-clonic seizures were the most common type of generalized seizures, accounting for 23% of all and 88% of generalized seizures. Absence seizures were seen in 1% of the cases. A single seizure type was observed in 737 patients (60%) and the remaining 40% had multiple seizure types. SPS, CPS, and absence seizures were most commonly combined with other seizure types. The study revealed that distribution of seizure type varies as a function of age. Although the present study finds ICES relevant, difficulties in its utilization in epidemiological context are demonstrated.\r"

In the sample selection, care was taken to include factors believed to influence both the mental capabilities of epileptic patients and the individual functional cerebral organization. Results suggest that the interhemispheric prevalence pattern is related to the focus site. Controls as well as epileptic patients with a right hemispheric focus showed the expected left language lateralization; conversely, children with a left unilateral focus showed a different pattern of functional representation, suggesting an involvement of the right hemisphere in language mechanisms. It is emphasized that this atypical cerebral organization is found in subjects with no structural lesion and no therapy. It seems likely that the presence of a focal epileptic activity itself can alter the cerebral mechanisms underlying cognitive functions. A relationship between this modified hemispheric specialization and subtle neuropsychological dysfunctions observed in the children with focal epilepsy is suggested.\r"

The epileptic burst triggered cardiac and hemodynamic responses, as simultaneously monitored by arterial pressure, and hypothalamic and heart activity. During interictal epileptic activity, the single burst triggered a short-latency cardiac arrhythmia, characterized by sinus bradyarrhythmia and junctional rhythm, and lengthening of intervals between sphygmic waves with significant reduction of diastolic pressure. When the epileptic burst stopped, the cardiac activity resumed normal rhythm, and diastolic pressure returned to basal value. During ictal epileptic activity, the sinus and junctional bradyarrhythmic episodes lasted longer, and supraventricular extrasystoles, sinus arrest, and bigeminal ventricular extrasystoles were observed. Both systolic and diastolic pressures decreased from 120/85 to 100/65 mm Hg. The end of the ictal episode always marked resumption of normal cardiac rhythm and systemic pressure. Considering the absence of metabolic complications (blood-gas analytic parameters and acid-base balance being controlled) and the short latency of the cardiac and hemodynamic responses, it is suggested that during paroxysmal hypothalamic activity the observed cardiac arrhythmias and the hemodynamic modifications were neurogenic in origin. A role for cardiovascular alterations in sudden unexplained epileptic death is postulated.\r"

  ".W": "Ovarian cysts persisting after the onset of menses were demonstrated by ultrasound (US) in 40 of 71 (56%) nonconception cycles following ovulation induction with human menopausal gonadotropins (hMG) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Persistent cysts were self-limited and all resolved spontaneously within two cycles. They developed more frequently during stimulation cycles with (1) higher mean pre-hCG serum estradiol (E2), (2) a greater number of medium and large follicles at peak pre-hCG E2, and (3) a larger leading follicle diameter at peak pre-hCG E2. Persistent ovarian cysts frequently occurred despite a peak pre-hCG E2 lower than 1000 pg/ml. Although ovarian enlargement in the presence of cysts exceeded 5 X 5 cm in 25% of cases, no patient developed clinical symptoms of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Repeated induction of ovulation with hMG/hCG in the presence of nonfunctional, persistent cysts resulted in pregnancies in 6 of 15 cases (40%). Asymptomatic persistent ovarian cysts frequently follow an hMG/hCG regimen and, when nonfunctional, are not a contraindication to repeated ovarian stimulation. Persistent ovarian cysts appear to be an attenuated form of OHSS.\r"

The authors have established a number of significant differences in chemical and physical properties of follicular fluids of patients treated by different regimen, and concur with earlier evidence that the volume of a follicle, and its P and total protein content, are related to the maturity of the oocyte nested within the follicle. Overall, however, differences in concentrations of gonadotropins in follicular fluids between groups were not consistent with differences in follicular fluid steroid levels, and levels of immunoactive gonadotropins in follicular fluids were not in accord with dosages of exogenous immunoactive gonadotropin administered during hyperstimulation. The most favorable outcomes of IVF (greater than 70% of oocytes fertilized) were established with oocytes collected from patients treated with FSH only or with CC/hMG, and patients treated with FSH only yielded the highest average number of oocytes which fertilized in vitro (6.2 per patient).\r"

  ".W": "In an effort to overcome possible interference by endogenous gonadotropin-ovarian hormone dynamics, desensitization of the pituitary gonadotropins by a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) was achieved in 12 women with repeatedly failed attempts at multiple follicular stimulation. Eight women were scheduled for in vitro fertilization (IVF) and embryo transfer (ET), and 4 for gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT). Stimulation failure was characterized by premature luteinization, poor estradiol (E2) response, or inadequate follicular growth. The agonist was administered by nasal spray 500 to 600 micrograms/day beginning on days 21 to 23 of the menstrual cycle. A rapid desensitization occurred by 7.6 +/- 0.6 days (mean +/- standard error [SE]) following the initial dose. Gonadotropin stimulation was begun when pituitary and ovarian suppression was judged to be adequate. In response to gonadotropin stimulation, a continuous rise of E2 was observed in all patients with a mean of 989 +/- 46 pg/ml on the day of hCG. A cohort of synchronized follicles was recruited and matured. The mean number of growing follicles per patient was significantly higher (P less than 0.0001) in combined therapy than in previously failed cycles (8.0 +/- 0.3 versus 3.2 +/- 0.1). All the patients underwent oocyte retrieval and 94.3% of the harvested oocytes were preovulatory. A high fertilization rate (89.7%) of the inseminated oocytes occurred in IVF patients.\r"

Only four subjects could normalize plasma testosterone (T) levels (group A). After 18 months of GnRH therapy, testicular size of group A increased by 53% (P less than 0.01) over that previously attained with exogenous gonadotropins. However, despite further testicular growth, two men who were previously azoospermic on hCG/hMG remained so on GnRH. In the other two patients, total sperm count increased minimally. Thus, pulsatile gonadotropin levels achieved with GnRH are more effective in stimulating testicular growth, but not necessarily sperm output, than are stable gonadotropin concentrations obtained with hCG/hMG.\r"

A statistically significant (P less than or equal to 0.015) high-amplitude seasonal variation with the peak in April to May was detected in semen volume, sperm count, and sperm motility. A statistically significant (P less than or equal to 0.04) annual change of moderate T to large FSH amplitude was detected in each of the five plasma endocrine variables as well. Plasma LH, T, and E2 peaked in autumn, while FSH and 20 alpha-DHP peaked in summer. Analysis of postvasectomy LH, FSH, E2, 20 alpha-DHP, and T blood levels for the 3 years following vasectomy revealed loss of seasonal rhythmicity as a group phenomenon in LH, E2, and T. The amplitude of the seasonal variation in FSH was decreased and that in 20 alpha-DHP was unchanged compared with before-vasectomy baselines. For those annual rhythms which persisted following vasectomy, the peak time was unchanged. Compared with the prevasectomy group annual mean, that for each of the endocrine values was unchanged, except for that of LH and T, which was slightly, yet statistically significantly, elevated. The existence of prominent annual variation implicates their consideration in the design of research protocols involving investigation of reproductive phenomena in human beings.\r"

Endometrial explants decreased in size following castration, but there was no further change in the treatment groups. Histologic examination indicated atrophy and regression of experimental endometriosis in all groups of castrated animals. As expected, following castration, serum estradiol (E2) became undetectable, serum progesterone (P4) decreased, and cytosolic E2 and P4 binding capacity in the endometrial explants was lower. However, in danazol-treated animals, serum P4 and E2 receptor concentrations were significantly higher than in all other castrated groups, and in both danazol and E/P treated animals, concentrations of P4 receptor were significantly higher than in castrated controls. In contrast, GnRHa treatment had no effect on serum E2 and P4 levels nor on E2 or P4 receptors. The authors conclude that danazol and E/P preparations may have a direct effect on the ectopic endometrium through interaction with steroid receptors.\r"

Administration of indomethacin (3 mg/kg.day, s.c.) for 2 wk suppressed ex vivo colonic prostaglandin E2 production by 50% and increased [3H]thymidine incorporation into mucosal DNA in vivo, but induced colonic inflammation. Higher doses of indomethacin were toxic and associated with high mortality. By contrast, administration of aspirin (50 mg/kg.day, s.c.) for 2-20 wk suppressed colonic prostaglandin E2 production by 97% and was unassociated with colonic inflammation or systemic toxicity. Suppression of colonic prostaglandin E2 production was associated with a sustained stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation into colonic mucosal deoxyribonucleic acid (2-20 wk) and an increase in the [3H]thymidine labeling index when examined at 20 wk. Basal cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate content of colonic mucosa was markedly reduced in aspirin-treated rats. Moreover, addition of dimethyl prostaglandin E2 or 8-Br-cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate suppressed the elevated levels of [3H]thymidine incorporation into mucosal deoxyribonucleic acid in incubated colonic segments from aspirin-treated rats. The results demonstrate that sustained suppression of colonic prostaglandin synthesis by aspirin is associated with a persistent increase in colonic epithelial proliferative activity. They support a role for local colonic prostaglandin synthesis as a negative modulator of epithelial growth, possibly mediated through increases in colonic mucosal cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate.\r"

To assess whether intermittent courses of an elemental diet could reestablish growth, 8 children (aged 9.8-14.2 yr) with Crohn's disease and growth failure entered into a prospective trial. Each patient was studied during an observation year on standard therapy, then for an experimental year during which they received enteral elemental diet 1 out of 4 mo. An age- and disease-matched control group of 4 patients was treated by conventional medical therapy during both years. Elemental diet therapy was administered nocturnally, at home, by continuous nasogastric infusion and increased the daily caloric intake by 25% (p less than 0.01). Anthropometric measurements demonstrated significant height and weight gains in the elemental diet group vs. controls (p less than 0.01). Crohn's disease activity index and prednisone intake decreased significantly in patients receiving elemental diet therapy when compared with themselves and with controls on conventional medical therapy (p less than 0.05). In contrast, the rate of pubertal development was similar in both groups irrespective of the treatment modality. This study demonstrates that chronic intermittent elemental diet effectively reverses growth arrest, while decreasing prednisone requirements and Crohn's disease activity index in pediatric Crohn's disease patients prior to puberty.\r"

The state of activation of T lymphocytes in the intestinal lamina propria was compared with that of circulating lymphocytes and lymphocytes isolated from the spleen or mesenteric lymph nodes of normal nonhuman primates. Lamina propria lymphocytes (LPL) had significantly higher proliferation in response to recombinant IL-2 compared with the other populations. In agreement with this finding, LPL had a significantly higher percentage of interleukin-2 receptor-positive (IL-2R+) cells as determined by staining with fluoresceinated monoclonal anti-IL-2R antibody. Two-color immunofluorescence staining showed that both CD4+ and CD8+ lamina propria T cells were IL-2R+. It was also found that the percentage of major histocompatibility complex class II-positive T cells was higher in the lamina propria. Northern blot analysis with a cDNA specific for the IL-2R showed that unstimulated LPL had easily detectable IL-2R mRNA, whereas no IL-2R mRNA was found in unstimulated lymphocyte populations from other sites. The activation of the IL-2R gene in LPL was not associated with the activation of other cellular genes (actin, major histocompatibility complex class I). Although no IL-2 bioactivity was measured in culture supernatants of unstimulated lymphocytes, concanavalin A-stimulated LPL produced significantly more IL-2 than other lymphocytes. This finding was confirmed at the molecular level as IL-2 mRNA was not detected in unstimulated LPL but was found in concanavalin A-stimulated LPL. Thus, normal lamina propria T lymphocytes have selective expression of genes associated with cell activation.\r"

Neither of the pancake meals were broken up within 150 minutes by mechanical agitation in a normal saline medium, but both were disrupted in the presence of acid-pepsin, the light consistency pancake being broken up more rapidly than the heavy consistency pancake (0.5 +/- 0.1 v 0.2 +/- 0.1% radioactivity appearing in the bathing medium per minute, p less than 0.01). Under normal conditions, the pattern and rate of gastric emptying of both meals was similar. Stimulating acid secretion with pentagastrin (6 micrograms/kg bodyweight sc) delayed the onset of emptying of both pancakes and tended to increase the slope of emptying. Under these conditions, the denser pancake was emptied more slowly than the lighter pancake because of an increase in the lag period. Thus the data did not confirm the hypothesis that the rate of emptying of disruptible solid food from the stomach under normal conditions of acid secretion is influenced by the ease with which it can be broken down by mechanical agitation in an acid-pepsin medium. The trend for an accelerated rate of emptying after administration of pentagastrin, however, may well be explained by the increased rate of disruption of the food in the presence of acid, but the longer lag periods are more compatible with inhibition of gastric emptying caused by free acid in the duodenum.\r"

In the present study, we have evaluated the effects of the bolus administration of synthetic alpha-human-atrial natriuretic peptide (1 microgram per kg) to patients with liver cirrhosis and variable degrees of sodium retention. alpha-Human-atrial natriuretic peptide induced rapid and marked increases of diuresis and natriuresis in patients without sodium retention or with moderate retention. The results were comparable to those obtained in six healthy control subjects. Conversely, the diuretic and natriuretic effects of alpha-human-atrial natriuretic peptide were attenuated or completely blunted in patients with avid sodium retention. The two groups of patients differed not only in basal sodium excretion, but also in plasma renin activity and in plasma aldosterone levels, suggesting that the reduced responsiveness to atrial natriuretic peptide might be due to excessive antagonism by antinatriuretic factors. The direct relationship between baseline sodium excretion rate and that stimulated by human-atrial natriuretic peptide administration was consistent with this interpretation. In none of the subjects did plasma renin activity peptide and cortisol levels change after human-atrial natriuretic peptide, while plasma aldosterone slightly declined in cirrhotics. Blood pressure fell after the administration of the peptide, with the drug greater in cirrhotic than in normal subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The 67 patients studied had varying degrees of hepatic failure as a result of viral hepatitis or paracetamol overdose. Serum levels of digoxin-like immunoreactive substances were significantly increased in both viral hepatitis and paracetamol overdose, with mean values of 0.42 +/- S.D. 0.25 ng per ml (n = 36) and 0.53 +/- 0.19 ng per ml (n = 31), respectively, as compared to normal control subjects with mean values of 0.01 +/- 0.02 ng per ml (n = 21, p less than 0.001). A statistically significant correlation was found between serum digoxin-like immunoreactive substances and the degree of encephalopathy in the viral hepatitis patients and with the serum creatinine in the paracetamol overdose patients where renal failure was more severe. No correlation was found with liver damage as assessed by the prolongation of the prothrombin time, serum AST or bilirubin values. Experiments with ultrafiltration and heating showed that both free nonprotein-bound digoxin-like immunoreactive substances and the total digoxin-like immunoreactive substances measured were increased. Column chromatography of ultrafiltrates of fulminant hepatic failure serum on Sephadex G-25 demonstrated at least two peaks with digoxin-like immunoreactive activity. Reduced renal function is an important factor in the increased serum level of digoxin-like digoxin-like immunoreactive substances, but their presence due to liver failure, where there is increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier, could be relevant to the development of hepatic encephalopathy.\r"

The administration of atrial natriuretic peptide (0.05 micrograms/kg/min) produced a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure. Similar reductions in blood pressure were obtained during the administration of nifedipine (1.0 micrograms/kg/min). Atrial natriuretic peptide produced a consistent increase in glomerular filtration rate that was higher than the increase in renal blood flow; hence, the filtration fraction was significantly elevated. Atrial natriuretic peptide also elicited a significant increment in urine volume and urinary sodium excretion, while nifedipine was devoid of any significant effects on renal hemodynamics and renal excretory function during the experimental period. The administration of atrial natriuretic peptide superimposed on an ongoing infusion of nifedipine resulted in a greater fall of blood pressure than that seen during the administration of atrial natriuretic peptide or nifedipine alone. Sodium excretion was also potentiated, but there were no changes in renal hemodynamics or in the filtration fraction. These results suggest that calcium entry blockers potentiate the vasodepressor and the natriuretic effects of atrial natriuretic peptide but prevent its renal hemodynamic effects.\r"

Incubations with [3H]ethylketo-cyclazocine (EKC) at increasing doses revealed the presence of high affinity, low capacity, opioid peptide receptor-specific binding of the kappa-type. Scatchard analysis of the binding data showed, in the plasma membranes, linear plots at both stages of pregnancy with similar mean equilibrium association constants of 1.31 +/- 0.29 (+/- SE) X 10(9) mol/L-1 (n = 4) at midterm and 0.52 +/- 0.63 X 10(9) mol/L-1 at term (n = 4). In placental cells (n = 4) from term gestations, the binding plots were curvilinear; the first component had a Ka of 5.51 +/- 0.50 X 10(9) mol/L-1, and the second component had a Ka of 1.33 +/- 0.81 X 10(8) mol/L-1 (P less than 0.01). When standardized per mg tissue protein, the number of binding sites in plasma membranes increased from 13.8 +/- 9.8 fmol at midterm to 50.0 +/- 18.6 fmol at term (P less than 0.05). For term placental cells, the concentration of binding sites was 81.2 +/- 36.0 fmol for the high affinity sites and 713 +/- 390 fmol for the lower affinity sites. Specificity for the kappa-type of OPR was found based on the inability of mu- or delta-opioid peptides, as well as LHRH and TRH, to compete for [3H]EKC binding. Term placental cells incubated with various doses of opioid peptides had a 50% increase in placental lactogen production. The increase was significantly higher than controls only with kappa-agonists (P less than 0.05), maximal with 10(-9) mol/L EKC, and completely inhibited by 5 X 10(-6) mol/L naloxone. These results expand on previous data demonstrating the presence of opioid peptide receptor in placental plasma membranes and suggest a role for opioid peptides in regulating secretion of placental lactogen by placental cells.\r"

The patient presented with severe rickets despite therapy with extraordinarily high doses of 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 or 1,25-(OH)2D3. Unidirectional intestinal fractional calcium absorption when he was not treated with any calciferol was 14% (normal, 20-70%), as measured with stable calcium isotopes; no increase in calcium absorption occurred when serum 1,25-(OH)2D levels were more than 50-fold elevated. Cultured skin fibroblasts contained no detectable 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-24-hydroxylase activity in response to 1,25-(OH)2D3 (10(-9)-10(-6) mol/L). High dose iv calcium infusions and oral phosphorus supplementation for 135 days improved or normalized biochemical parameters and resulted in radiographic healing of the rachitic lesions. We conclude that 1) this patient had no response to 1,25-(OH)2D3 in vivo and in vitro; 2) long term parenteral calcium infusions were effective therapy in managing the patient's severe resistance to 1,25-(OH)2D; and 3) stable calcium isotopes are useful for measuring low levels of fractional calcium absorption.\r"

FSH bioactivity was measured using a sensitive specific in vitro granulosa cells aromatase bioassay. Before buserelin treatment, mean serum FSH bioactivity and immunoreactivity were 19.7 +/- 4.1 (+/- SE) IU/L (n = 5) and 13.7 +/- 3.8 IU/L, respectively, with a bioactivity to immunoactivity (B/I) ratio of 1.7 +/- 0.2. After the initiation of treatment with the GnRH agonist, FSH bio- and immunoactivities both transiently increased for 1-3 days. The increase in bioactivity was greater and prolonged, and the B/I ratio increased nearly 7-fold in 2 weeks. Serum FSH immunoreactivity declined to below the pretreatment level in 5 days and remained low for the rest of the treatment period. In contrast, serum FSH bioactivity did not decrease significantly below the pretreatment level during the 6-month treatment period, although the B/I ratio returned slowly toward the pretreatment value. After orchidectomy, both FSH activities increased dramatically, and the B/I ratio rose transiently from 1.5 to 7 in 2 weeks. Interestingly, serum FSH bioactivity and immunoreactivity decreased significantly (P less than 0.05) 1 day after orchidectomy in the buserelin-treated patients. In contrast, serum FSH immunoreactivity increased during the same period (P less than 0.05) in patients treated only by orchidectomy (FSH bioactivity was not measured). In conclusion, serum FSH bioactivity increases acutely more than FSH immunoreactivity after initiation of GnRH agonist treatment or orchidectomy. In the former case, serum FSH bioactivity subsequently returned to the pretreatment range. A clear decline during long term agonist treatment occurred only in serum FSH immunoreactivity, in contrast to the concomitant decline in serum LH bio- and immunoreactivities reported previously. The persistence of bioactive FSH may explain the inconsistent effects of GnRH agonist treatment on the suppression of spermatogenesis. The acute decrease in serum FSH after orchidectomy in the buserelin-treated men suggests that the testes may produce a factor that stimulates pituitary FSH secretion.\r"

We pharmacologically created a hypogonadotropic condition with a GnRH analog (GnRH-A) in six women with PCOD to investigate the role of deranged gonadotropin secretion in PCOD and to improve the response to pulsatile GnRH ovulation induction. Before GnRH and GnRH-A treatment the women with PCOD had increased LH pulse frequency [one pulse every 55 +/- 2 (+/- SE) min; P less than 0.05] and LH pulse amplitude (10.9 +/- 1.4 U/L; P less than 0.05) compared to normal women in the follicular phase of their menstrual cycle. Each PCOD woman completed one cycle of pulsatile GnRH administration for ovulation induction before (pre-A cycles; n = 6) and one or two cycles after (post-A cycles; n = 9) GnRH-A administration [D-Ser(tBu)6-Des,Gly10-GnRH; 300 micrograms, sc, twice daily for 8 weeks]. Pulsatile GnRH (5 micrograms/bolus) was given at 60-min intervals using a Zyklomat pump. Daily blood samples were drawn during the pulsatile GnRH ovulation induction cycles for the determination of serum LH, FSH, estradiol (E2), progesterone, and testosterone, and pelvic ultrasonography was done at 1- to 4-day intervals. Mean (+/- SE) serum LH levels were elevated during the pre-A cycle (49.2 +/- 3.1 IU/L) and decreased to normal levels during the post-A cycles (19.6 +/- 1.4 IU/L; P less than 0.0001). Mean testosterone concentrations were lower during the post-A cycles [88 +/- 2 ng/dL (3.1 +/- 0.1 nmol/L)] than during the pre-A cycles [122 +/- 3 ng/dL (4.2 +/- 0.1 nmol/L); P less than 0.0001]. In the follicular phase of the post-A cycles E2 levels were significantly lower [81 +/- 5 pg/mL (300 +/- 20 pmol/L) vs. 133 +/- 14 pg/mL (490 +/- 50 pmol/L); P less than 0.0001], preovulatory ovarian volume was smaller (24.6 +/- 2.0 vs. 31.4 +/- 2.4 cm3; P less than 0.01), and the FSH to LH ratio was higher (0.56 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.16 +/- 0.01) than in the pre-A cycle, suggesting more appropriate function of the pituitary-gonadal axis. Excessive LH and E2 responses to pulsatile GnRH administration in the early follicular phase of the pre-A cycle were abolished in the post-A cycles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Immunoreactive alpha-subunit was present at low but usually detectable levels in blood samples drawn at 10- to 20-min intervals for 12-24 h; however, no characteristic pattern of pulsatile alpha-subunit secretion was found. Serum from each man was examined by gel filtration chromatography. Each sample tested contained an immunoreactive alpha-subunit peak with a slightly lower elution volume than [125I]hCG alpha, as we had previously found in serum from normal men. To determine if this peak represented TSH alpha, two men were treated with 0.3 mg L-T4 daily for 7-14 days. Serum TSH levels decreased to less than 1.5 mU/L, and neither TSH nor alpha-subunit levels increased after the iv administration of 500 micrograms TRH. An alpha-subunit peak that eluted before [125I]hCG alpha was again found in the serum of T4-treated men. We conclude that glycoprotein hormone alpha-subunit is present in the serum of men with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in whom TSH secretion is completely suppressed by L-T4. The gonadotrophs represent the most likely source of this alpha-subunit. The finding of more normal alpha-subunit than LH secretion in these men indicates that the production of the gonadotropin subunits is differentially regulated in man and supports the hypothesis that factors in addition to GnRH regulate alpha-subunit gene expression.\r"

Serum FSH levels were determined by both the granulosa cell aromatase bioassay and RIA. The constant infusion of 4F-antagonist (30 micrograms/kg.h) to the four hypogonadal women resulted in a more pronounced decline in bioactive FSH (62%) than in immunoreactive FSH levels (30%), and the FSH bioactive to immunoreactive ratio decreased significantly (P less than 0.05). Infusion of 4F-antagonist in normal women in the midfollicular phase revealed a similar pattern of suppression of bioactive (64%) and immunoreactive FSH (29%). When 4F-antagonist was administered sc at a dose of 80 micrograms/kg twice daily for 3 days to normal women in the midfollicular phase of their cycles, the bioactive FSH response was biphasic, with the maximal decrease on the second day, followed by return to basal levels on the third day. Correspondingly, there was a precipitous decline in serum estradiol (apparent demise of the dominant follicle), followed by a progressive rise in estradiol levels. Thus, in contrast to immunoreactive FSH levels, bioactive FSH more clearly reflects the biological action of FSH on the follicle in response to GnRH antagonist administration in women. The disparity in the quantitative decline between serum bioactive and immunoreactive FSH levels after presumed blockade of the GnRH receptor may reflect the microheterogeneity of the FSH molecule and suggests that alterations in the biological activity of secreted FSH may be GnRH dependent.\r"

  ".W": "A reverse hemolytic plaque assay was used to measure the GH responses of fetal pituitary cells to GHRH, SRIH, T3 and glucocorticoids. Cells from eight human abortuses (18-22 weeks' gestation) showed accelerated plaque formation after treatment with 10(-7) mol/L GHRH-(1-44) [25.6 +/- 0.6% (+/- SE) of cells formed plaques (PFC); mean area, 14.5 +/- 2.7 X 10(4) micron2; all at 1 h], while 10(-7) mol/L SRIH-(1-28) slowed plaque formation (8.6 +/- 0.6% PFC; mean area, 4.2 +/- 0.8 X 10(4) micron2) vs. control (13.7 +/- 0.7% PFC; mean area, 5.3 +/- 0.8 X 10(4) micron2; all at 1 h). The proportion of PFC was equal in GHRH-treated and control groups by 4 h, suggesting that GHRH affects the amount of GH secreted per somatotroph rather than the number of cells that are preferentially responsive to GHRH. Qualitatively similar data were obtained using pituitary cells from four near-term rhesus fetuses. When cells were cultured in defined medium for 3 days, supplementation with T3 reduced basal GH secretion and attenuated the responses to GHRH. Culture with dexamethasone increased basal GH secretion and restored the responsiveness to GHRH. Dexamethasone also caused a shift in plaque area frequency distributions to patterns similar to those in serum-supplemented medium. We conclude that fetal somatotrophs are responsive to SRIH, GHRH, T3, and dexamethasone. Furthermore, glucocorticoids can maintain a subpopulation of fetal somatotrophs in the GHRH-responsive state.\r"

No elevations of plasma 7B2 were found after iv administration of ovine CRH in six patients with Cushing's disease and after iv administration of TRH and/or oral administration of bromocriptine in six prolactinoma patients. In experiments using cultured human somatotroph adenoma cells, high K+ induced 7B2 release. The apparent mol wt of 7B2 in plasma was 20,000, whereas that of 7B2 in the culture medium was about 45,000. These findings suggest that 7B2 is secreted by human GH-producing pituitary adenoma cells and that plasma 7B2 responses to GHRH and/or TRH may be characteristics of human somatotroph adenomas.\r"

  ".W": "In patients with TSH-secreting pituitary adenomas associated with hyperthyroidism, TSH secretion usually does not respond to exogenous TRH stimulation. To determine the basis for this unresponsiveness, we studied TRH binding to the membranes of two such TSH-secreting pituitary adenomas. The patients, a 28-yr-old man and a 60-yr-old woman, had clinical and biochemical hyperthyroidism with increased serum TSH levels (15.7 and 14 mU/L, respectively; normal range, 1.1-7.2) and alpha-subunit to TSH molar ratios greater than 1 (2.4 and 1.7, respectively). Neither patients had an increase in serum TSH in response to TRH (200 micrograms, iv). Immunocytochemistry of the two adenomas, removed by transsphenoidal surgery showed a pure population of thyrotropic cells. Binding studies were performed by incubation of tumor cell membrane suspensions with increasing amounts of [3H]TRH. Two PRL-secreting adenomas and one normal human pituitary were used as controls. The characteristics of the TRH-binding sites from the control tissues were similar to those previously reported (Kd, 56, 30, and 49 nM; maximum binding, 187, 46, and 94 fmol/mg protein, respectively). In contrast, no specific TRH binding was found in the two TSH-secreting adenomas. We conclude that the unresponsiveness of TSH after TRH administration is related to the absence of specific TRH-binding sites in these thyrotropic tumors.\r"

Experiments studying the relative contribution of each system suggested the possibility that gonococci increased their metabolic activity in response to interaction with neutrophils. This hypothesis was confirmed by demonstrating that undifferentiated HL-60 cells, which are unable to undergo a respiratory burst, induce a two- to three-fold increase in gonococcal O2 consumption. Gonococcal capacity to adhere to HL-60 cells did not correlate with extent of metabolic stimulation. Stimulatory activity was demonstrable in cell-free supernatant from neutrophils or HL-60 cells, and increased with duration of incubation. Supernatant applied to a G-15 Sephadex column yielded fractions that stimulated gonococcal O2 consumption. Elution profiles were similar for HL-60 cells, neutrophils, and a stimulatory factor previously isolated from pooled human serum. This stimulatory factor(s) failed to adhere to DEAE or C-18 HPLC columns. Stimulatory activity release from myeloid cells was inhibited by incubation at 4 degrees C or in the presence of NaF, indicating a critical role for glucose metabolism. Lactate, the principal product of resting neutrophil glucose catabolism, was demonstrable in cell-free supernatants after incubation at 37 degrees C. Lactate accumulation was inhibited by NaF and decreased temperature of incubation. Lactate at levels present in cell-free supernatant increased gonococcal O2 consumption twofold and restored stimulatory activity to dialyzed serum. Live, but not heat-killed gonococci eliminated lactate released from neutrophils during phagocytosis. Gonococci are able to utilize host-derived lactate to enhance their rate of O2 metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "Mononuclear cells may be important regulators of fibroblast glycosaminoglycan (GAG) biosynthesis. However, the soluble factors mediating these effects, the importance of intercytokine interactions in this regulation and the mechanisms of these alterations remain poorly understood. We analyzed the effect of recombinant (r) tumor necrosis factor (TNF), lymphotoxin (LT), and gamma, alpha, and beta 1 interferons (INF-gamma, -alpha and -beta 1), alone and in combination, on GAG production by normal human lung fibroblasts. rTNF, rLT, and rINF-gamma each stimulated fibroblast GAG production. In addition, rIFN-gamma synergized with rTNF and rLT to further augment GAG biosynthesis. In contrast, IFN-alpha A, -alpha D, and -beta 1 neither stimulated fibroblast GAG production nor interacted with rTNF or rLT to regulate GAG biosynthesis. The effects of the stimulatory cytokines and cytokine combinations were dose dependent and were abrogated by the respective monoclonal antibodies. In addition, these cytokines did not cause an alteration in the distribution of GAG between the fibroblast cell layer and supernatant. However, the stimulation was at least partially specific for particular GAG moieties with hyaluronic acid biosynthesis being markedly augmented without a comparable increase in the production of sulfated GAGs. Fibroblast prostaglandin production did not mediate these alterations since indomethacin did not decrease the stimulatory effects of the cytokines. In contrast, protein and mRNA synthesis appeared to play a role since the stimulatory effects of the cytokines were abrogated by cyclohexamide and actinomycin D, respectively. In addition, the cytokines and cytokine combinations increased cellular hyaluronate synthetase activity in proportion to their effects on hyaluronic acid suggesting that induction of this enzyme(s) is important in this stimulatory process. These studies demonstrate that IFN-gamma, TNF, and LT are important stimulators of fibroblast GAG biosynthesis, that interactions between these cytokines may be important in this regulatory process, that these cytokines predominantly stimulate hyaluronic acid production and that this effect may be mediated by stimulation of fibroblast hyaluronate synthetase activity.\r"

  ".W": "The protective effect of hydroxyl radical scavengers and iron chelators has strongly implicated the hydroxyl radical in several models of tissue injury. Based on in vitro studies showing gentamicin-enhanced generation of reactive oxygen metabolites in renal cortical mitochondria, we examined the effect of hydroxyl radical scavengers and iron chelators in gentamicin-induced acute renal failure. Rats treated with gentamicin (G) alone (100 mg/kg, s.c. x 8 d) developed advanced renal failure (BUN 215 +/- 30 mg/dl) compared to saline-treated controls (BUN 16 +/- 1 mg/dl, P less than 0.001). In contrast, rats treated with gentamicin and either dimethylthiourea (DMTU, an hydroxyl radical scavenger, 125 mg/kg, i.p. twice a day) or deferoxamine (DFO, an iron chelator, 20 mg/day by osmotic pump) had significantly lower BUN (G + DMTU 48.8 +/- 8 mg/dl, P less than 0.001, n = 8; G + DFO 30 +/- 7 mg/dl, P less than 0.001, n = 8). In separate experiments, treatment with two other hydroxyl radical scavengers (dimethyl sulfoxide or sodium benzoate) and a second iron chelator (2,3,dihydroxybenzoic acid) had a similar protective effect on renal function (as measured by both BUN and creatinine). In addition, histological evidence of damage was markedly reduced by the interventional agents. Finally, concurrent treatment with DMTU prevented the gentamicin induced increase in renal cortical malondialdehyde content (G: 4.4 +/- 0.2 nmol/mg; G + DMTU: 3.1 +/- 0.2 nmol/mg, P less than 0.0001, n = 8) suggesting that the protective effect of DMTU was related to free radical mechanisms rather than to some other effect. Taken together, these data strongly support a role for hydroxyl radical or a similar oxidant in gentamicin-induced acute renal failure.\r"

For the same changes in external pH, changes in [HCO3] and PCO2 affected cell pH similarly ([HCO3]: pHi/pHe = 0.67, PCO2: pHi/pHe = 0.64, NS). Isohydric changes in extracellular [HCO3] and PCO2 did not change cell pH significantly. Changes in peritubular [HCO3] elicited larger changes in cell pH than changes in luminal [HCO3], which were enhanced by peritubular 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate (SITS). The cell pH defense against acute increases and decreases in PCO2 was inhibited by sodium, but not by chloride removal. Peritubular SITS inhibited the cell pH defense against increases and decreases of PCO2, whereas luminal amiloride inhibited cell pH defense against increases in PCO2. Conclusions: (a) Steady-state cell pH changes in response to changes in extracellular [HCO3] and PCO2 are quantitatively similar for a given change in extracellular pH; (b) the rate of the basolateral Na/(HCO3)3 cotransporter is a more important determinant of cell pH than the rate of the apical membrane mechanism(s); (c) cell pH defense against acute changes in PCO2 depends on the basolateral Na/(HCO3)3 cotransporter (acid and alkaline loads) and the luminal Na/H antiporter (acid loads).\r"

The present study is based on our previous investigations that demonstrated both a loss of beta-adrenergic agonist high-affinity binding sites and a decreased adenylate cyclase activity in sarcolemma from failing hearts. Using cholera toxin and [32P]NAD, we labeled the alpha subunit of Gs (Gs alpha) and found a 59% reduction in the level of this protein. Further, a 50% reduction in Gs activity was noted in a reconstitution assay utilizing membranes from the mouse S49 lymphoma cell line cyc-, which is deficient in Gs. These data suggest that, in this model of pressure-overload left ventricular failure, the acquired defect in the beta-adrenergic receptor/adenylate cyclase system involves a deficiency in the coupling protein Gs. Such an abnormality may explain the decreased adrenergic responsiveness of the failing left ventricle.\r"

In contrast, BVH rats showed a sixfold greater ANF mRNA concentration in the left ventricle than age-matched WKY controls. BVH right ventricular ANF mRNA levels equaled those found in BVH left ventricles and were dramatically greater than WKY right ventricular controls. Unlike experimental models of hypertrophy, both left and right ventricles significantly increase ANF gene transcripts in the natural development of BVH. The left and right ventricles can concordantly respond to hypertrophy and increase ANF gene transcription.\r"

The phenotype of his B cells includes: (a) limitation to expression of the mu and delta H chain isotypes, (b) production of mu and delta H chains of reduced size and (c) delayed expression of L chain. Peripheral blood and B cell lines from the patient's mother and sister include 50% cells that express H chain without L chain. B cell lines from the mother and sister produce full-length mu and gamma H chains and truncated mu and delta chains corresponding to the H chains produced by the patient's B cells. Clones with normal and XLA phenotype have been isolated from B cell lines derived from the patient's mother. We conclude that the dimorphism of mother's and sister's B cells results from Lyonization, implying that the gene defect in XLA is intrinsic to B lymphocytes.\r"

Under steady-state conditions, spontaneous bile flow was far greater in obstructed rats (266.6 +/- 51.9 microliters/min per kg) than in controls (85.6 +/- 10.6 microliters/min per kg), while excretion of 3-hydroxy bile acids was the same in the two groups. Infusion of 10 clinical units (CU)/kg per h secretin produced a minimal choleretic effect in controls (+3.8 +/- 1.9 microliters/min per kg) but a massive increase in bile flow in the obstructed animals (+127.8 +/- 34.9 microliters/min per kg). Secretin choleresis was associated with an increase in bicarbonate biliary concentration and with a decline in [14C]mannitol bile-to-plasma ratio, although solute biliary clearance significantly increased. Conversely, administration of taurocholate (5 mumol/min per kg) produced the same biliary effects in control rats and in rats with proliferated biliary ductules. In the obstructed animals, the biliary tree volume measured during taurocholate choleresis (67.4 +/- 15.8 microliters/g liver) was significantly greater than that determined during the increase in bile flow induced by secretin (39.5 +/- 10.4 microliters/g liver). These studies indicate that, in the rat, the proliferated bile ductules/ducts spontaneously secrete bile and are the site of secretin choleresis. Furthermore, because the proliferated cells expressed phenotypic traits of bile ductular cells, our results suggest that whereas under normal conditions the biliary ductules/ducts in the rat seem to contribute little to bile formation, secretion of water and electrolytes is a property of biliary epithelial cells.\r"

This chemically modified protein was demonstrated by electroimmunotransblot technique and with rabbit polyclonal antibodies that recognize acetaldehyde adduct as an epitope (i.e., both anti-hemocyanin-AA IgG and anti-myoglobin-AA IgG). It has a molecular weight of 37,000. It can be detected in the liver of rats fed the alcohol-containing American Institute of Nutrition 1976 liquid diet for only 1 wk. Since the protein profiles of soluble hepatic proteins from alcohol-fed and control rats were identical on SDS-PAGE, the peroxidase-positive band demonstrated by electroimmunotransblot was most likely not a new protein synthesized de novo. Borohydride reduction was not necessary to stabilize this protein-AA. Intraperitoneal injections of ethanol (2 g/kg body wt) at 8-h intervals to rats over a 24-h period did not produce any detectable protein-AA in the liver. Incubation of the liver homogenate from a control liver with acetaldehyde without sodium cyanoborohydride for 4 h also failed to generate any protein-AA. Therefore, the formation of the 37-kD protein-AA in vivo reported here is dependent on chronic alcohol consumption.\r"

  ".W": "Human collagenase inhibitor is a ubiquitous glycoprotein capable of blocking the action of several connective tissue metalloproteinases, including collagenase, gelatinase, and proteoglycanase. The action of this proteinase inhibitor may constitute a pivotal step in the control of connective tissue matrix degradation. Using monospecific antibody to collagenase inhibitor as an immunocytochemical probe, we determined its in vivo localization in normal human skin and in a pathologic state, the altered connective tissue stroma surrounding basal cell carcinoma. Collagenase inhibitor was localized diffusely throughout the dermis and appeared to be associated with the extracellular matrix components, both in normal skin and in basal cell carcinoma. Intense staining was present in the stroma surrounding islands of basal cell carcinoma. The increased amounts of collagenase inhibitor may be a result of its production by stromal fibroblasts stimulated by cytokines of tumor or inflammatory cell origin. These findings are similar to those previously described for dermal collagenase. Both collagenase inhibitor and collagenase itself appear to be normal components of the extracellular matrix, and amounts of both are increased in the altered stroma surrounding neoplastic cells. Thus we suggest that the balance of degradative proteinase(s) to specific inhibitor may be an important factor in determining the composition of the extracellular matrix.\r"

  ".W": "Activated neutrophils may play a part in atopic disorders. In these studies, neutrophils were obtained from atopic and nonatopic adults for assessment of respiratory-burst activity. Superoxide production was measured in the resting state and after stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate, formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (f-met-leu-phe), or calcium ionophore A23187. Inhibition of this response by histamine was also measured. Neutrophils from atopic subjects produced more superoxide in the basal state, or in response to calcium ionophore A23187, or submaximal concentrations of f-met-leu-phe, than cells from control subjects. Histamine inhibition of f-met-leu-phe-stimulated superoxide production was less in atopic subjects than in control subjects. These findings suggest that neutrophils from atopic subjects may be hyperreactive in that they produce more superoxide in response to stimuli of low potency and are less readily inhibited than cells from control subjects. These properties may reflect a general attribute of cellular function in atopy and may contribute directly to tissue damage in allergic diseases.\r"

We report our crossed immunoelectrophoretic studies comparing antigenicity and allergenicity of Solenopsis invicta IFAWBE and IFA venom (IFAV). Rabbits were hyperimmunized with IFAWBE prepared from S. invicta or with IFAV obtained from S. invicta by an electric shock method. Crossed immunoelectrophoresis with anti-IFAWBE detected at least 29 precipitin lines in IFAWBE and three lines in IFAV, but none in a synthetic venom, transpiperidine. Anti-IFAV detected six precipitin lines in IFAV and five lines in IFAWBE, but no lines were detected with transpiperidine. Crossed-line immunoelectrophoresis confirmed the IFAV origin of at least three of the peaks in IFAWBE. Crossed radioimmunoelectrophoresis with 11 IFAWBE RAST-positive sera elicited radiostaining with five antigens in IFAWBE that were probably IFAV associated. One of these allergens was recognized by all sera; the other allergens were recognized by 8, 7, 5, and 4, respectively, of the 11 sera. Four of the antigens present in IFAV preparations had allergenicity. These findings indicate that IFA allergens probably originate in IFAV, but that transpiperidine, a major constituent of IFAV, does not appear to be immunogenic. The results suggest that IFAV may be a more appropriate reagent than IFAWBE for laboratory testing and for clinical diagnosis and immunotherapy of IFA-sensitive individuals.\r"

In this study, a double-blind, double-dummy randomized design was used so that half the subjects continued to receive theophylline and the other half was actually switched from theophylline to cromolyn sodium therapy. Assessment again consisted of the revised Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, the Selective Reminding test, the Benton Visual Retention test, Stroop tests I and II, and the Child Behavior Checklist. The group receiving placebo theophylline/active cromolyn sodium therapy demonstrated greater improvement on all tests of memory and concentration, with greatest significance for the Stroop test (p less than 0.03 by analysis of covariance). There were also significant correlations between length of time theophylline was taken and scores on the depression (p less than 0.03) and the obsessive-compulsive (p less than 0.04) subscales of the Child Behavior Checklist. These results support the findings of the previous pilot study but, in addition, raise concern about depression and anxiety as possible long-term side effects of long-term theophylline therapy.\r"

Disodium cromoglycate and theophylline inhibit histamine release (HR) from rat peritoneal, but not intestinal, mast cells. We found disodium cromoglycate (10(-4) to 10(-8) mol/L) to be ineffective in both human lung and human intestinal mast cell preparations, whereas theophylline (10(-3) to 10(-6) mol/L) inhibited both lung and intestinal mast cell HR. Quercetin (10(-4) to 10(-8) mol/L) and doxantrazole (3 X 10(-4) to 10(-7) mol/L), which inhibit both rat mast cell types, also inhibit HR in both human mast cell preparations. We also examined the actions of indomethacin and exogenous arachidonic acid and found that neither the lung nor the intestinal mast cells demonstrated the enhancement of HR stimulated by these agents in the basophil. In summary, we have found no pharmacologic differences between the human lung and intestinal mucosal mast cell such as exist in the rodent models. This underscores the limitations of applying the data from animal mast cells to the human mast cells, and at the same time demonstrates that human basophils and mast cells are different.\r"

Increases in specific airway resistance (SRaw) were induced by isocapnic hyperventilation with dry air on two occasions, 7 days apart. Before the tests, the subjects received oral terfenadine (120 mg, twice daily) or placebo for 3 days with the last dose administered 3 hours before the test. Baseline SRaw and spirometric values (vital capacity and FEV1) were similar for the two tests. Terfenadine yielded a significant (p less than 0.001) parallel shift to the right of the stimulus (hyperventilation)-response (SRaw) curve; 100% increases in SRaw occurred at ventilation rates of 44 L/min after placebo treatment and 64 L/min after terfenadine treatment. These data suggest that histamine release plays a role in hyperventilation-induced bronchospasm despite the fact that increase in plasma histamine has not been found in this situation, in contrast to exercise-induced bronchospasm.\r"

Patients received either cromolyn, 20 mg, terbutaline, 0.1 mg/kg up to 4 mg, or the combination, three times daily. The study design was double-blind, crossover with each patient receiving the three treatment regimens in randomized order for a period of 8 weeks each. Daily diary mean scores generally demonstrated best symptom control with cromolyn or the combination than with terbutaline alone. Cough was significantly less with cromolyn than with terbutaline (p less than 0.05). Morning peak flow measures were higher with combination therapy than with terbutaline (p less than 0.05). Evening peak flow measures were higher with the combination and cromolyn alone than with terbutaline alone (p less than 0.01). Methacholine challenge demonstrated less bronchial hyperreactivity with the combination or cromolyn alone than with terbutaline alone (p less than 0.02).

ELISA studies demonstrated elevated serum levels of IgG to an oak chip extract, inhibition of that ELISA by preincubation of serum with Penicillium sp., and absence of elevated IgG levels to an extract of freshly cut oak wood that had been stripped of bark to minimize mold contamination. The case analysis indicates that the patient likely had hypersensitivity pneumonitis on exposure to Penicillium sp., when he was cutting trees, and identifies cutting live trees as another occupational exposure that may cause hypersensitivity pneumonitis.\r"

IL-2, at high concentrations induced higher levels of Ig secretion in Staphylococcus aureus strain Cowan I (SAC)-activated B cells than at low concentrations. About 50% of SAC-activated B cells, lacking Tac antigen, were also responsive to Ig secretion by IL-2, although the required dose of IL-2 was higher than that for Tac-positive B cells. H-31 antibody which recognizes Tac antigen did not inhibit the induction of Ig secretion by high concentrations of IL-2 in both Tac-negative and Tac-positive B cells, suggesting that IL-2 might induce Ig secretion through a receptor distinct from Tac antigens. In contrast, IL-2 was ineffective in the absence of SAC stimulation even at high concentrations. Upon analysis by SDS-PAGE, p70/75 IL-2-binding molecules were detected on Tac-negative SAC-activated B cells. Similar IL-2-binding molecules distinct from Tac antigen (p55) were detected in both Tac-positive B and T cells. However, neither p55 nor p70/75 IL-2-binding molecules could be detected in the absence of SAC stimulation. These observations suggest that p70/75 IL-2 binding molecules are induced in human B-cells in the presence or absence of Tac antigen by SAC stimulation and these determinants play an important function in the transduction of IL-2 associated signal for B cell differentiation.\r"

High concentrations of IL-2 induced IgM secretion in these cells through a receptor distinct from Tac antigen. The acid-wash technique revealed that more than 60% of 125I-labeled IL-2 bound to the cells became acid-unremovable in the first 30 min of incubation at 37 degrees C and degradation products of 125I-IL-2 increased after 30 min of incubation. Treatment of the cells with NaN3 buffer inhibited the appearance of acid-unremovable 125I-IL-2, suggesting that acid-unremovable 125I-IL-2 was not due to fluid-phase pinocytosis but due to internalization. Loss of labeled bands by incubation of cells with 125I-IL-2 at 37 degrees C before affinity cross-linking demonstrated that 125I-IL-2 was internalized via novel IL-2-binding molecules. These results suggest that novel IL-2-binding molecules are responsible for internalization and may mediate signal transduction in B cells in the absence of Tac antigen.\r"

The suppressive substance is distinct from T. cruzi antigen inasmuch as the supernatant depleted of any residual T. cruzi antigen by an affinity column still retains the suppressive activity, whereas addition of T. cruzi antigens to control supernatant did not confer suppressive function. The suppressive supernatant does not contain detectable levels of IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, or IFN-gamma but a modest level of IL-1 and IL-2 inhibitory activities. However, both these inhibitory activities elute at a different position from the DTH suppressive activity on gel filtration. The DTH suppressive activity is heat labile (1 h, 56 degrees C), cryostable, but destroyed by trypsin treatment. It binds to ricin but not to lentil lectin. Sepharose 4B gel filtration and HPLC analysis in mild chaotropic agents (urea, ethylene glycol) demonstrate that the suppressive substance has an apparent Mr of 30 to 60 kDa, but full DTH-suppressive activity is retained only in an aggregated form.\r"

  ".W": "To clarify the relationship of the 290 and 145 kDa chains of the epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) antigen, we subjected urea extracts of skin basement membrane zone (BMZ) proteins and isolated 290 and 145 kDa chains of the EBA antigen cut out of sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels to treatment with clostridial collagenase. When the reaction products were electrophoresed, transblotted, and reacted with EBA patient sera or two monoclonal antibodies to the EBA antigen, the 290 kDa chain was degraded into the 145 kDa band that was resistant to cleavage with collagenase. The 145 kDa domain, isolated after collagenase treatment of the whole BMZ extract, was resistant to degradation by hyaluronidase, chondroitinase ABC, heparinase, and heparitinase but was readily degraded by V-8 protease. These data suggest that the EBA antigen consists of collagen and noncollagen domains of identical size (Mr 145,000), and that the 145 kDa noncollagen domain is generated via degradation of the native 290 kDa species by collagenase.\r"

Plasma CD levels correlated with the sizes of primary tumor masses in mice, and the presence of metastatic tumors did not significantly affect the relationship. Elevated plasma CD levels appear to be directly related to tumor pigmentation: mice who had nonpigmented tumors induced by injections of amelanotic melanoma cells (NP) did not have elevated plasma CD levels. These studies indicate that plasma CD levels may serve as a marker for pigmented malignant melanomas and may be useful in following patients who are at high risk for these tumors.\r"

  ".W": "We have developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for autoantibody to Ro/SS-A antigen (anti-Ro/SS-A) in order to more fully characterize the autoimmune response that occurs to this antigen in patients with subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE). The microtiter plate-immobilized, biochemically purified Ro/SS-A antigen reacted with anti-Ro/SS-A antibody, but not with other closely related specificities (anti-La/SS-B, anti-SM, anti-U1-RNP) or normal sera. The optimal pH of antigen-antibody reaction in this ELISA was 7.2. The binding of sera containing anti-Ro/SS-A was inhibited 80% by preincubation with the same amount of Ro/SS-A antigen used for coating the plate. Although 11 of the 14 (79%) SCLE sera studied had precipitating anti-Ro/SS-A antibody by immunodiffusion, 13 (93%) sera had abnormally elevated IgG, IgA, or IgM ELISA binding levels. A good correlation between IgG anti-Ro/SS-A ELISA binding levels and immunodiffusion titers was observed (r - 0.8588, p less than or equal to 0.001) suggesting that IgG is the major anti-Ro/SS-A antibody class detected by double immunodiffusion, Sera with a combination of high rheumatoid factor levels (latex 3+ or higher) and high anti-Ro/SS-A titers (1:8 or higher in immunodiffusion) tended to give an abnormally high IgM anti-Ro/SS-A ELISA binding levels. After rheumatoid factor activity was removed by absorption with heat-aggregated human IgG, a 50% decrease in IgM anti-Ro/SS-A ELISA binding was noted. On the other hand, absorption of rheumatoid factor-negative sera that contained high IgM anti-Ro/SS-A binding activity did not significantly decrease ELISA binding levels. Prednisone and 6-azathioprine reduced the level of IgG anti-Ro/SS-A autoantibody in sera of treated SCLE patients by 50%. The IgG subclass profile of anti-Ro/SS-A autoantibody was analyzed by using mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for the 4 human IgG subclasses. Of anti-Ro/SS-A positive SCLE sera, 91% had predominantly IgG1 subclass autoantibody. The coexistence of IgM and IgG anti-Ro/SS-A autoantibody and the predominance of the IgG1 subclass is compatible with the possibility that this autoantibody response is under T-cell control. The predominance of IgG1 in the autoimmune response to Ro/SS-A antigen in SCLE patients is consistent with the hypothesis that antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity could be an important immunologic effector mechanism in this disorder.\r"

  ".W": "In order to investigate the role of inflammatory cells in altering the collagenase production by epidermolysis bullosa (EB) fibroblasts, macrophage and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) factors obtained from mouse peritoneal fluids were added to the fibroblast culture system, and collagenase activity was assayed after a 48-h incubation. Data obtained here revealed that the response of collagenase production by fibroblasts was quite different, depending on the type of EB. Namely, EB dystrophica recessiva (EBDR) (n = 2) fibroblasts produced significant amounts of collagenase in the range of 5.07 (U/ml) to 6.04 in response to macrophage-conditioned medium, macrophage lysate, and PMN lysate, compared with 0.13 in the absence of these. On the other hand, EB dystrophica dominans (EBDD) (n = 1) fibroblasts showed little or no overt increase in enzyme production in the presence of macrophage lysate and PMN lysate, which resulted in a moderate increase to 3.82 in response to macrophage-conditioned medium. Furthermore, EB simplex (EBS) (n = 1) fibroblasts produced collagenase up to 3.84 in response to these three factors. These factors can be inactivated by treating with trypsin, pronase, and phenylglyoxal. Our data clearly indicated that, in the comparisons of EBDD and EBS fibroblasts, EBDR fibroblasts showed quite high response to factors derived from macrophages and PMNs in terms of collagenase production. This fact may raise a clue that accounts for the high levels of tissue collagenase activity, which plays a potentially major role in blister formation in EBDR.\r"

This study examined, by using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoelectron microscopy, the subcellular distribution of the HMSA-1 in malignant melanocytes. Fractionation of cell organelles and ELISA assay indicated that the HMSA-1 is rich in fractions of large granule, melanosome and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in melanoma cells. Immunoelectron microscopic study showed that the HMSA-1 is localized in the melanosomes of various developmental stages and vacuolar structures, which appeared to be the stage I melanosomes and which contained the matrix protein. Dopa cytochemistry revealed that the distribution of MoAb HMSA-1 reaction product is localized in the area different from that of tyrosinase, indicating that the synthetic processes of melanosomal matrix protein and tyrosinase are different. Furthermore, the reaction product with MoAb HMSA-1 was seen in the rough ER, indicating that the melanosomal matrix protein is synthesized by membrane-bound ribosomes and processed through the channel of ER.\r"

Fibrinolysis parameters assessed were tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity in plasma and in euglobulin fractions and rapid plasminogen activator inhibitor activity. All parameters were evaluated before and after venous occlusion to assess endothelial cell t-PA release in response to localized anoxia. Markers of deficient fibrinolysis were persistently undetectable t-PA activity and increased rapid plasminogen activator inhibitor activity after venous occlusion. Defective fibrinolysis was correlated with disease severity; it was noted only in patients with severe or moderate disease and in no patients with mild disease or in controls. Fibrinolysis abnormalities were independent of disease activity, suggesting that vascular endothelium injuries occurring during flare-ups persist during inactive phases of the disease. No correlation was found between fibrinolysis abnormalities and disease duration, corticosteroid administration, or the presence of lupus anticoagulant or anticardiolipin antibodies. These data support the hypothesis of parallelism between the severity of vascular injuries, suggested by deficient fibrinolysis, and the severity of clinical manifestations in SLE.\r"

The total cost of RA to Medi-Cal is projected to be $19.26 million (+/- $0.90 million) annually. Inclusion of possible gastrointestinal side effects of drug therapy increases the total cost to $20.49 million (+/- $0.91 million). While only 6.5% of the sample of RAs were hospitalized and 4.9% received nursing home care annually, these services are estimated to account for nearly 70% of RA-related expenditures. Less than 7% of Medi-Cal RAs receive disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). More than 75% of Medi-Cal RAs received aspirin or NSAIDs. These relieve pain and inflammation, but have not been demonstrated to halt the process of joint destruction.\r"

By creating a Task Force with varied representation, we were able to design a program that is applicable to all nursing units and which allows each unit to tailor orientation to its specific needs. The Preceptor Program has proven to enhance our ability to provide the new staff nurse with a personalized orientation that is both thorough and consistent, while providing existing staff nurses with an opportunity to enhance their professional practice. The improved quality of orientation coupled with significant cost savings has been particularly dramatic in our intensive care units. Though we remain committed to the concept of a Preceptor Program for orientation on all nursing units, we need additional data so that a decision can be made on valid criteria. It is our hope that the extension of our pilot program during 1987 will provide us with the opportunity to fully measure costs and benefits, so that we can move to a house-wide program. In addition to the benefits we originally anticipated, we now believe that a Preceptor Program will be a significant recruitment tool. During the interview process, nurse applicants frequently inquire about the availability of such a program and have been very favorably impressed when we have been able to offer them this approach to orientation. With a projected nationwide nursing shortage and expected increase in staff nurse turnover rates, we believe that a Preceptor Program will become a significant tool for both recruitment and retention of staff nurses.\r"

Activity increased significantly (P less than 0.05) from 2.37 +/- 0.31 mol glutamate/(mg jejunal protein.h) (X +/- SD) in the first week to 3.50 +/- 0.99 in the second week and 4.75 +/- 0.96 during the third week. The quantity of the glutaminase protein, measured with a dot immunobinding assay, remained constant during the first (592 +/- 174 cpm bound/g protein) and second (599 +/- 125) weeks and then increased significantly by the third week (784 +/- 270) after birth. These results indicate that the activity of glutaminase is regulated by alterations in both the quantity and activity of glutaminase protein. The oxidation of [U-14C]glutamine to 14CO2 in vitro also increased during the suckling period, with significantly (P less than 0.05) higher rates of oxidation observed by the third week after birth. The capacity of the developing rat jejunum to utilize both glutamine and -hydroxybutyrate (BHB) as fuel sources to support [methyl-3H]thymidine (3HTdR) incorporation was also determined. Addition of glutamine to jejunal homogenates in vitro resulted in a significantly (P greater than 0.05) higher rate of 3HTdR incorporation than was observed with either glucose or BHB as a fuel source during the early suckling period. In the late suckling period, the addition of BHB and glutamine together resulted in significantly (P greater than 0.05) higher rates of 3HTdR incorporation than that found with glucose as a fuel source. These data suggest that both glutamine and BHB are important fuel sources in the jejunum during the suckling period.\r"

Influenza immunization was performed without serious adverse reactions and there was no increase in absenteeism attributable to the vaccination. Among those who developed clinical influenza, there was a trend toward fewer days of illness in the vaccinated group compared with the placebo group (6.0 vs. 8.0, p = 0.07). There were no statistically significant differences between subjects receiving influenza vaccine and those receiving the placebo when comparing incidences of influenza-like illness, severities of illness, and sick absenteeism. Influenza immunization of hospital employees was performed at minimal cost and risk but provided little benefit, most likely because of an unexpected drift of the prevalent influenza strain away from the vaccine type.\r"

We show that in the peripheral blood IL-2 production was similar in RA and controls (3.7 vs 3.0 U/ml, respectively). However, blood lymphocytes from patients with joint effusions produced significantly less IL-2 than from patients without effusions (1.8 vs 5.7 U/ml, respectively). The amount of IL-2 produced by synovial fluids (SF) cells was significantly less than that produced by the corresponding blood cells (1.0 vs 1.6 U/ml). Further experiments revealed that the decreased IL-2 production was not due to its removal by IL-2 receptor positive cells in the SF and cell mixing experiments did not reveal any suppressor influences.\r"

From the result of sequential coprecipitation analysis of SDS-PAGE between SLE serum, antiinterleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor antibody (anti-Tac antibody) and anti-Ia antibody, the reactive antigen on the activated PBL and an adult T cell leukemia cell line proved to be an identical molecule of the IL-2 receptor on these cells. The role of this autoantibody in the modulation of T cell mediated immunity in patients with SLE is discussed.\r"

Twenty-four hour urate excretion and serum creatinine were not significantly altered. These findings persisted for the duration of TPN. In 2 patients with ileocolitis, the addition or deletion of either lipid emulsion or multivitamin infusions during TPN had no effect on urate values. Rather, the amino acid load or a specific constituent appears to be the causal factor. These data suggest that hypouricemia due to extensive net urate excretion is common during TPN therapy. Finally, patients with established gout may be at risk for acute gouty attacks during TPN therapy.\r"

Patients were treated with either a daily 2-hour infusion or 24-hour infusion for 7 days every 3 weeks for at least 2 cycles. Patients who demonstrated stable disease or improvement on therapy then were continued on a maintenance program of 5 days of recombinant interferon gamma administered every 3 to 4 weeks. The initial starting dose was 10 mcg. per m.2 per day with escalations to 30, 100, 300, 1,000 and 3,000 mcg. per m.2. Dose-limiting toxicity occurred at 1,000 to 3,000 mcg. per m.2, and included leukopenia, chills, fevers, rigors and hepatotoxicity as manifested by elevation in the transaminase and bilirubin levels. Tumor responses were seen initially at the 300 mcg. per m.2 dose level. Over-all, of 41 patients evaluable for therapeutic effectiveness 1 demonstrated a complete response 6 months in duration and 3 demonstrated partial responses 2, 9 and 13 months in duration. However, 6 patients demonstrated organ site responsiveness, including resolution of pulmonary lesions (2 complete and 1 partial responses), lymphadenopathy (1 complete and 1 partial responses), a pleural-based lesion in 1 patient with a partial response and complete resolution of hepatic metastases in 1 patient. We conclude that recombinant interferon gamma at a dose of 1,000 to 3,000 mcg. per m.2 for 7 days and repeated every 2 to 3 weeks had demonstrable anticancer activity in patients with metastatic renal carcinoma.\r"

Aortic elastase was significantly higher in patients with AAAs, multiple aneurysms, and ruptured AAAs compared with occlusive disease. The alpha 1-antitrypsin, was significantly lower in patients with multiple aneurysms and ruptured AAAs. These data suggest that the ratio between elastase and its major serum inhibitor, alpha 1-antitrypsin, is significantly altered in the aortic wall in different types of infrarenal aortic disease.

  ".W": "Platelet aggregation and release phenomena are central to most postulated mechanisms of thrombosis and neointimal hyperplasia after carotid endarterectomy. Therefore high-dose aspirin (HDA) has been advocated to minimize these sources of endarterectomy failure. We have defined low-dose aspirin (LDA) that selectively blocks platelet cyclooxygenase but preserves arterial wall cyclooxygenase in the nonhuman primate, Macaca fascicularis. We compared this theoretically optimal aspirin dose with HDA and no treatment (control) in a model of carotid endarterectomy. The aspirin was started before operation and continued for 6 weeks after operation, at which time the endarterectomized vessels were excised. The patency and morphologic findings of the arteries were measured. Platelet function was monitored by bleeding time and serum thromboxane A2 determinations. LDA and HDA were associated with 100% patency, whereas the control group had 50% patency. However, HDA did not protect the vessel from developing neointimal hyperplasia, which was seen in the control group and was associated with platelet adherence to the flow surface at 6 weeks. At 6 weeks, LDA significantly decreased but did not totally prevent neointimal hyperplasia and the flow surface was healed. Therefore the genesis of neointimal hyperplasia after endarterectomy may be more complex than simply a function of platelet-vessel wall interaction.\r"

  ".W": "Between October 1975 and November 1985, 907 lower limb bypasses were constructed in 715 patients (799 limbs) with glutaraldehyde-stabilized umbilical veins (UV-G) used as the predominant, or sole, graft material. Each reconstruction was classified in one of eight categories depending on the site of the distal anastomosis: above- and below-knee popliteal, anterior and posterior tibial, peroneal, trifurcation, sequential, and crural (tibial or peroneal) bypasses with adjunctive distal arteriovenous fistulas. Primary and secondary cumulative graft patency rates were determined for each category as well as cumulative actual palliation that combines end points of graft failure, amputation, and death. Half-life patencies for popliteal, tibial, and peroneal bypasses were 6.5, 2.3, and 1.7 years, respectively. Perioperative graft thrombosis occurred in 11% of popliteal reconstructions compared with 22% for the crural group. Nonocclusive graft failure caused by infection, aneurysm, or progressive foot gangrene occurred in 87 grafts (8%). The overall infection rate was 4.3%. Anastomotic aneurysms (1.4%) and strictures (2.1%) occurred infrequently as isolated phenomena. The incidence of graft dilatation and aneurysms assumed significant proportion after 5 years (36% aneurysms and 21% dilation); the diagnosis was particularly facilitated by B-mode imaging. Nevertheless, the overall clinical impact of graft degradation remained minimal (6% after 5 years). Twenty-two of 26 graft aneurysms were excised with successful graft replacement achieved in 10. During this 10-year period, our attitudes did change with regard to the indication for UV-Gs in relation to the maturation of infrapopliteal reconstructive surgery, appreciation of the superior results attainable with in situ saphenous vein, recognition of morphologic changes in long-term UV-G implants, and the growing documentation of poor results with polytetrafluorethylene in the crural position. We believe that UV-G is an acceptable alternative to the absent or deficient autologous vein, particularly in patients with limited life expectancy and where expediency may be a critical factor.\r"

The proportion of persons with diabetes mellitus, smokers, and types of bypass grafts was similar in both groups. More patients in the rt-PA-treated group had hypertension (p = 0.01). To evaluate the different lengths of follow-up, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used with a log-rank test to compare the proportion of persons with patent grafts in the two treatment groups. At 30 days, 86% of the rt-PA-treated grafts were still patent compared with 42% of the surgically treated grafts (p = 0.001). When risk factors on the Kaplan-Meier curves were compared, there was no statistical difference with regard to graft patency among the groups. According to simultaneous Cox regression analysis, no risk factor was significantly associated with graft patency. When amputation was evaluated between treatment groups simultaneously with other risk factors in a logistic regression analysis, smoking and age of the graft were marginally significant (p = 0.07), whereas all other factors were clearly not significant. In 91% of the rt-PA-treated patients, a secondary surgical procedure was required to maintain patency of the graft segment. Eighty-nine percent of the surgically treated patients required similar graft revisions. Two patients in the surgical group and one patient in the rt-PA-treated group had major complications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Two quantitative methods, Confidence Profiles and CAN*TROL, are used to analyze evidence and estimate the health and economic consequences of adding annual mammography to annual breast physical examinations in asymptomatic women aged 40 to 49 years who are at average risk for breast cancer. Such women have about a 128 in 10,000 chance of having breast cancer in the next ten years and about an 82 in 10,000 chance of dying of such a cancer. Adding annual mammograms to annual breast physical examinations each year during that age decade would reduce the probability of death to about 60 in 10,000, a reduction of about 26%. Screening would increase the expected lifetime of a woman destined to get breast cancer between ages 40 and 49 years by about 3.5 years. Ten years of screening with mammography in that age decade carries a risk of radiation-induced cancer of about one in 25,000 and a risk of a surgery recommendation for a lesion that is not cancer of about one in ten. If 25% of the women in this age group in the United States were screened every year, breast cancer mortality in the year 2000 would be decreased by about 373 deaths. In 1984 dollars, the cost of screening, workups, and continuing care in the year 2000 would be about $408 million. Treatment costs would be decreased by about $6 million, leaving a net increase in costs in the year 2000 of approximately $402 million (1984 dollars).\r"

All patients had stable weights without changes in intravenous calories or protein for 3 consecutive months. Our objectives were to assess oral intake of calories, carbohydrates, fat, and protein, to examine relationships between oral nutrient intakes and disease categories, and to compare oral and intravenous intakes to calculated resting energy expenditure (REE). Two patterns of oral nutrient intake were identified among the patients. Patients with short bowel syndrome, regardless of the underlying disease, consumed calories by mouth that clearly exceeded calculated resting energy expenditure (short bowel, non-Crohn's, 170% of REE; short bowel, Crohn's, 200 of REE); however, calories approximating the REE had to be given via HPN, suggesting that efficiency of absorption was at a very low level. Patients with diffuse gut diseases (radiation enteritis or pseudo-obstruction syndromes) had very low intakes of oral nutrients. The distribution of oral calories among carbohydrate, protein, and fat did not differ among the disease categories.\r"

However, such changes are variable and nonspecific, and represent hepatic injury rather than changes in hepatic function. Antipyrine (Phenazone) clearance is a sensitive indicator of hepatic microsomal enzyme activity and provides a more specific indication of hepatic function. This was used to investigate the effect of different TPN regimens. Patients receiving a postoperative 2000 kcal TPN regimen providing all nonprotein calories as dextrose (n = 16) showed a 34% reduction of mean antipyrine clearance after 7 days of TPN compared to controls (n = 13, p less than 0.05). This effect was seen also in patients receiving a 1600 kcal dextrose-based regimen (n = 8). In patients receiving a 2000 kcal TPN regimen in which 500 kcal were provided as lipid (n = 10), mean antipyrine clearance was not significantly different from that of the control group. This study indicates the sensitivity of hepatic microsomal oxidative function, an important route of drug metabolism, to different TPN regimens.\r"

Blood studies were performed in the early morning of each day. Fifteen subjects underwent the fasting measurements and the maintenance infusion, while 11 underwent all 3 days of the protocol. With the maintenance infusion serum bilirubin fell from the fasting value of (X +/- SD) 0.77 +/- 0.53 to 0.63 +/- 0.49 mg/dl for a reduction of 18% (p less than 0.05). For the subgroup of 11 subjects receiving two levels of formula infusion, fasting and maintenance serum bilirubin levels were 0.81 +/- 0.57 and 0.65 +/- 0.47 mg/dl, respectively, (p less than 0.05). With the twice maintenance infusion the plasma bilirubin decreased further to 0.46 +/- 0.29 mg/dl, a decrement of 43% relative to fasting (p less than 0.01). No other significant changes were detected during the protocol in the standard blood chemical and hematologic studies. Thus, the serum level of bilirubin is inversely related to the formula caloric infusion rate during continuous nasoenteric feeding.\r"

All animals suffered severe renal failure manifested by increased plasma urea and creatinine levels, decreased creatinine clearance, and increased fractional excretion of sodium. On day 4 of acute renal failure, rats receiving low dose amino acids had better-preserved renal function than those receiving high dose amino acids. However, the type of solution infused did not affect recovery of renal function.\r"

Our previous studies with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) have shown the effect of fat supply on phospholipid composition in pulmonary surfactant. Consequently, we attempted to determine whether fat supply would also improve the functional properties of the lung and surfactant. After polytrauma consisting of laparotomy, hypovolemia, and a single femur fracture, the animals were fed only parenterally for 14 days. Two groups of rats were infused via the jugular vein with isocaloric (260 kcal/kg/day) and isonitrogenous (5.62 gN/kg/day) regimens. The nonprotein calories were given either as glucose alone or 30% of calories as fat. Lung function was assessed by measurement of static lung compliance and total lung capacity. Surfactant isolated from lavage fluid was evaluated by means of a Wilhelmy balance. In agreement with our previous studies, in which we obtained a higher level of saturated lecithin in the fat groups, we found significantly (p less than 0.05) increased compliance (2.93 +/- 0.54 ml/cm H2O/kg BW) in the fat group compared to the carbohydrate group (2.02 +/- 0.36 ml/cm H2O/kg BW). Furthermore, a significantly (p less than 0.05) elevated total lung capacity was noted in the fat group (32.60 +/- 3.90 vs 26.00 +/- 1.45 ml/kg BW). The relatively improved surface tension properties as expressed by stability index (S = 0.89 +/- 0.24 vs 0.66 +/- 0.22) and minimum surface tension (gamma min = 18.5 +/- 5.01 vs 20.75 +/- 2.81) is a characteristic change, and was seen in the fat group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Each received a daily infusion of a 2.5-liter solution consisting of fat emulsion, amino acids, glucose, and additives from a \"3-liter bag.\" After infusions, the IPs were washed with three different rinsing methods, one including 45% v/v alcohol. After 70 days the ports were opened and examined for precipitation. Ports washed with alcohol showed no signs of precipitation, while four of six ports which were washed with conventional rinsing methods had precipitates.\r"

One patient with a severe short-bowel syndrome supported by long-term parenteral nutrition who suffered repeated episodes of ataxia and disorientation associated with elevated serum levels of D-lactate was studied. Results demonstrated no impact of glucose- vs lipid-based parenteral nutrition formulations on total acid production or serum D-lactic acid levels, increased serum D-lactate levels during administration of neomycin, but prompt resolution of both acidosis and clinical symptoms with discontinuation of oral intake. This study confirms the findings of other investigators that D-lactic acidosis may be a significant, heretofore unappreciated complication in patients with severe short-bowel syndrome, and that prompt resolution may be effected with abrupt discontinuation of oral intake. Furthermore, the present study suggests neither a detrimental nor a beneficial effect of parenteral nutrition on this syndrome.\r"

A GR assay was developed and performed directly on cell monolayers maintained in serum-free medium to which hydrocortisone at 5 nM, 50 nM, and 5 X 10(-4) M was added. Compared with control cells grown in medium without hydrocortisone, GR levels per cell decreased by 50% after 48 hours of growth in medium containing 5 nM hydrocortisone concentrations (50 nM or 5 X 10(-4) M), GR levels decreased to less than or equal to 28% of control values. In all hydrocortisone treatment groups there was an inverse relation between GR concentrations and Na-K ATPase activity. Binding of cell GR by the addition of the antiglucocorticoid RU 38486 in hydrocortisone-supplemented medium eliminated the glucocorticoid-induced stimulation of Na-K ATPase activity. These results demonstrate a time- and dose-dependent effect of glucocorticoids on GR binding activity and a direct relation between this receptor-hormone interaction and Na-K ATPase activity in intact renal tubular epithelial cells.\r"

Rabbit afferent arterioles were microdissected and incubated for two consecutive, 20 minute periods. Hourly renin release rate from a single arteriole was calculated. Basal renin release rate was 0.97 +/- 0.13 ng AI.hr-1.Af-1/hr (X +/- SEM, N = 18) and remained stable throughout the incubations. When afferent arterioles were exposed to alpha-hANP (0.01, 0.1 or 1 microM), renin release rate did not change significantly. Isoproterenol (5 microM) increased renin release rate from 0.92 +/- 0.28 to 1.50 +/- 0.46 ng AI.hr-1.Af-1/hr (N = 7, P less than 0.01). After pretreatment of afferent arterioles with alpha-hANP (1 microM), isoproterenol still increased renin release rate from 0.98 +/- 0.24 to 1.64 +/- 0.37 ng AI.hr-1.Af-1/hr (N = 7, P less than 0.01). The increases in renin release rate induced by isoproterenol were not different between the two groups. Pretreatment of rabbits with furosemide for two days before experiments resulted in greater basal renin release rates from microdissected afferent arterioles (1.70 +/- 0.35 ng AI.hr-1.Af-1/hr, N = 14). However, exposure to alpha-hANP (1 microM) did not alter this elevated renin release rate. It is concluded that atrial natriuretic factor may not have a direct action on juxtaglomerular cells.\r"

The distal tubular rejection fraction of sodium calculated from sodium and lithium clearances rose markedly from 4.7 to 13% (P less than 0.001) and returned to 6.2% at the end of the recovery period. Thus, under salt loading and water diuresis conditions, hANP infusion did not alter GFR, but reduced proximal reabsorption of sodium, and markedly enhanced the fraction of sodium escaping distal tubular reabsorption, suggesting that hANP-induced natriuresis is due, for an important part, to inhibition of sodium reabsorption in the distal nephron.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma immunoreactive atrial natriuretic peptide (irANP) levels, their chromatographic profile, relationship with hemodynamic variables, and responses to hemodialysis (HD) or postural changes were investigated in HD patients. Peripheral venous supine plasma irANP averaged 167 +/- 31 (+/- SEM) pg/ml in 12 normal subjects (age 63 +/- 2 yr). In 42 HD patients (mean age 65 +/- 1 yr), plasma irANP in peripheral arterio-venous fistulae was high (447 +/- 50 pg/ml, P less than 0.01) before HD and decreased (P less than 0.001) to 164 +/- 24 pg/ml after HD. The latter reduced body weight by -2.3 +/- 0.2 kg (P less than 0.001) and blood pressure from 139/77 +/- 4/2 to 126/73 +/- 4/2 mm Hg (P less than 0.01). Pre-dialysis plasma irANP in right atrium, pulmonary artery or avfistula correlated with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (N = 10, r = 0.66 to 0.73; P less than 0.05); HD-induced changes in these variables were also correlated (r = 0.80 to 0.90; P less than 0.05 to less than 0.01). Compared with supine values, upright posture decreased plasma irANP in 12 normal subjects and 8 HD patients (-40 and -42%, respectively, P less than 0.01). IrANP clearance from plasma averaged 24 +/- 5 ml/min across the hemodialyzer (N = 6) and 46 +/- 3 ml/min across the hemofilter (N = 4). We conclude that in terminal renal failure, circulating irANP consists largely of alpha ANP, is often elevated before HD, decreases with the change from recumbency to standing, falls after removal of excess fluid, and may depend strongly on left atrial and pulmonary arterial pressures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Urinary protein excretion and retinoid metabolism respectively were studied in 10 and 6 of these donors. The functional adaptation was characterized by an increase in glomerular filtration rate and tubular function, which began in the first two days after uninephrectomy. Changes in tubular function were also demonstrated by significant increases in the urinary excretion of beta 2 microglobulin (beta 2M), retinol binding protein (RBP), kappa and lambda light chains of immunoglobulins. In addition, a protein identical to or homologous to cellular retinoic acid binding protein (CRABP), appeared in the urine after nephrectomy. We did not find CRABP in serum samples either before or after nephrectomy, suggesting that urinary CRABP was synthesized by the remaining kidney. Increases in serum levels of Vitamin A and RBP were also observed in the post-nephrectomy period. These modifications in retinol metabolism suggest that these substances could have a role as renotropic growth factors in compensatory hypertrophy.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the direct toxicity of human Bence Jones protein (BJP), individual nephrons of male Sprague-Dawley rats were perfused in vivo at 20 nl/min with an artificial tubule fluid (ATF) that contained no protein, a human kappa BJP (5 g/dl), or bovine serum albumin (5 g/dl), and proximal convoluted tubule function and morphology were examined. Perfusion with BJP perfusate for less than or equal to 5 minutes produced no changes (P = NS) in absorption of water, Jv, (1.09 +/- 0.20 vs. 1.50 +/- 0.25 nl/min/mm), chloride, JCl, (95 +/- 47 vs. 123 +/- 41 pEq/min/mm), and glucose, JG, (39 +/- 3 vs. 40 +/- 5 pmol/min/mm) compared to perfusions with only ATF. However, perfusion for at least 20 minutes with the same BJP perfusate produced decreased (P less than 0.025) in Jv (0.58 +/- 0.12 vs. 1.15 +/- 0.14 nl/min/mm) and JG (27 +/- 3 vs. 38 +/- 3 pmol/min/mm) compared to perfusions with ATF alone; the decrease in JCl (64 +/- 47 vs. 119 +/- 27 pEq/min/mm) did not reach statistical significance. Perfusion for 20 minutes with ATF containing albumin resulted in no changes in Jv (1.22 +/- 0.21 vs. 1.15 +/- 0.14 nl/min/mm), JCl (207 +/- 29 vs. 119 +/- 27 pEq/min/mm), and JG (31 +/- 1 vs. 38 +/- 3 pmol/min/mm), when compared to the ATF perfusions. Immunocytochemistry, immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy of the BJP-perfused tubules demonstrated the kappa light-chain protein in endosomes and activated lysosomes. In addition, cellular desquamation and fragmentation, prominent cytoplasmic vacuolation, and focal loss of the microvillus border were found in the BJP-perfused tubules, but not in the albumin-perfused tubules. In conclusion, these functional and morphologic data show that a human kappa light-chain is toxic to the proximal convoluted tubule of the rat. This toxicity occurred in a time-dependent fashion when the lysosomal system was markedly activated. Direct damage of the tubule epithelium by BJP's may be involved in the development of the tubulointerstitial nephropathy associated with multiple myeloma.\r"

To study the efficacy of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in cyst infection, cyst fluid was obtained by percutaneous aspiration or at surgery from eight patients with ADPKD receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Cysts were categorized as nongradient or gradient by cyst-fluid sodium concentration. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole concentrations within cysts were determined and cyst fluid inhibitory and bactericidal titers were assessed in vitro against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Streptococcus fecalis. The mean cyst fluid trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole concentrations were 15.2 micrograms/ml and 42.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. Preferential accumulation of trimethoprim was observed in gradient cysts, exceeding serum levels more than eightfold. Sulfamethoxazole penetrated cysts to a lesser extent, with concentrations ranging from 10 to 70 percent of the serum level. Cyst fluid sampled prior to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole administration (control) demonstrated no antibacterial activity, while cyst fluid inhibitory and bactericidal titers following antibiotic administration were 1:32 or greater in most instances. These studies indicate that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is likely to be efficacious in the treatment of cyst infection in polycystic kidneys.\r"
