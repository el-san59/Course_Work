Two commercially available OTC thyroid products were analyzed for total thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) content. The strength of a liquid thyroid gland extract was unlabeled and that of the solid oral preparation was 45 mg per table. The T4 concentration of the liquid preparation was less than 10 micrograms/dL; that of T3 was below the analytical sensitivity of our assay (less than 15 ng/dL). Tablet content of T4 and of T3 was up to 0.5 micrograms and up to 50 ng, respectively. Preliminary data on these OTC thyroid gland extracts cannot be extrapolated to all OTC thyroid products, but they suggest that such products generally contain concentrations of T4 and T3 below clinical effectiveness. Further analytical study is warranted.\r"

A retrospective drug utilization review and a prospective drug use evaluation of ciprofloxacin were performed to determine if the agent was being used for appropriate indications, to ensure correct dosing and appropriate monitoring, and to determine whether its use is cost effective at the Veterans Administration Medical Center, Cleveland (VAMCC). For the retrospective review, 40 patients' charts were randomly chosen for review from computerized inpatient and outpatient prescription records. Drug use review criteria were developed by the Pharmacy Service and Infectious Disease Section. For the prospective evaluation, data were collected for all inpatient and outpatient requests for ciprofloxacin during a six-month period (May to November 1988) using the same criteria as in the retrospective study. Cost analysis was performed by identification and cost comparison of alternative therapy and by estimating the number of days saved by using appropriate oral therapy. All charts from the retrospective review were found to meet criteria for appropriate use. All patients for whom documented follow-up was performed had microbiologic or clinical cures. In the prospective evaluation, 168 patients were started on ciprofloxacin. Ninety-five percent of patients had appropriate justification for use according to criteria. Drug cost savings for the six-month period was +14,962.54 or +29,925.08/year. This covered drug and minibag acquisition costs only. An estimated 127 hospital days were saved (shortened length of +71,717.00 or +143,434.00/year.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It was hypothesized that printed information, such as in drug bulletins, influences physician prescribing behavior by changing their knowledge of drug efficacy and adverse effects and their perceptions of drug utility. Therefore, the impact of a drug bulletin was evaluated on these domains of influence. Interview data were used to assess changes in knowledge, perceived drug utility, and stated prescribing. Health insurance funds' records were used to collect actual prescribing data. Information in the bulletin on the treatment of renal colic changed physicians' knowledge as well as perceived utility of drugs used for renal colic (p less than 0.05). Significant changes in stated prescribing were also found. On the other hand, advice in the same bulletin on the treatment of the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) had no impact at all. It did not even improve the knowledge of the physicians about the drugs used for IBS. Apparently, the message about the treatment of IBS failed to gain the attention of the physicians. It is suggested that some messages are sufficiently transmitted through written information, and others that are seen as less relevant or too difficult to implement need more intensive strategies.\r"

Before control angiography was performed, the anatomic and procedural characteristics of the previous dilatation and the new symptomatic status were carefully reevaluated in all patients. Baseline clinical and angiographic characteristics including age, sex, ejection fraction, and number of diseased vessels in which repair was attempted were similar in both groups. Reasons for angioplasty were also similar with unstable angina being the most frequent indication: 29 (60%) in group 1 versus 13 (50%) in group 2. (p = NS). Morphology of the lesions was also similar, although longer lesions (greater than 12 mm) were dilated in group 2 (13 (43%) vs 10 (20%) in group 1; p less than 0.05). Angiographic success was achieved in 51 lesions (100%) in group 1 versus 28 (93%) in group 2 (p = NS). Primary angioplasty success (in the absence of major complications) was achieved in 46 (95%) procedures in group 1 versus 24 (92%) in group 2 (p = NS). Two patients in group 1 had a myocardial infarction, but there were no other major complications in either group. Preliminary data suggest that the outcome of repeat coronary angioplasty for restenosis is similar whether it is performed at the time of diagnostic catheterization or later on as an independent elective procedure.\r"

The patients were divided into two groups depending on the presence (group I) or absence (group II) of heparin treatment (170 to 220 IU/kg per day) during the acute phase of infarction. The collateral index was significantly higher in group I (1.5 +/- 0.9) than in group II (0.4 +/- 0.4; p less than 0.05). The left ventricular ejection fraction tended to be greater in group I than in group II (49 +/- 12% vs 38 +/- 16%), and there was a significant difference in regional wall motion of the infarct area that was evaluated by the percentage of segment shortening between the two groups (group I:7.4 +/- 9.2%, group II:-0.8 +/- 4.5%, p less than 0.05).

In the controls heart rate, arterial pressure, and coronary sinus blood flow were unchanged. In those receiving ethanol at a rate that produced a concentration in coronary sinus blood of 285 +/- 102 (mean +/- SD) mg/dl, heart rate-systolic arterial pressure product was unchanged; coronary sinus blood flow rose 27 +/- 36%, and coronary vascular resistance fell 17 +/- 22% (p less than 0.05 in comparison to baseline); arterial-coronary sinus oxygen content difference fell (p less than 0.05), and epicardial coronary arterial dimensions were unchanged.

  ".W": "To analyze the usefulness of a single exercise test to predict the presence of fixed obstructive coronary artery disease in patients with active coronary spasm, 91 consecutive patients with angiographically proven symptomatic coronary artery spasm who had performed a symptom-limited exercise test within the week before diagnostic coronary angiography were studied. Coronary angiography revealed significant coronary obstructions in 61 patients (67%). According to the type of angina, the prevalence of significant coronary stenosis was 53% for patients with angina at rest, 68% for those with effort angina, and 92% for those with mixed angina. Exercise-induced ST segment elevation was present in eight patients (9%), ST segment depression was seen in 37 patients (41%), and no ST abnormalities in 46 (50%). There was not a significant relationship between the ST segment response to exercise and the clinical variables assessed except for coronary anatomy. Abnormal exercise test results were significantly more frequent in patients with significant coronary obstructions than in those without significant coronary occlusions (62% versus 23%; p less than 0.01). ST elevation was not useful to predict the presence of fixed coronary lesions. However, ST depression strongly suggested the presence of underlying coronary lesions with a sensitivity of 54%, a specificity of 87%, and a positive predictive value of 89%. Using this criterion, 65% of the patients were correctly classified. The results indicate that despite the functional component of ischemia in patients with coronary spasm, ST segment depression with exercise is still a highly specific sign with a high positive predictive value for the presence of significant coronary artery disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To assess the prognostic value of an abnormal postexercise response in systolic blood pressure (SBP), treadmill exercise testing was performed in 217 survivors of acute myocardial infarction at an average of 9.3 weeks after infarction. During the mean follow-up period of 4 years, cardiac events were noted in 34 patients (16%), including cardiac death in 13 (6%), nonfatal reinfarction in 12 (6%), and coronary artery bypass graft surgery in nine (4%). An abnormal postexercise SBP response was defined as the ratio of SBP at 3 minutes of recovery to peak exercise SBP of 0.9 or more, on the basis of the cutoff point with the highest sensitivity and specificity to predict cardiac events. An abnormal postexercise SBP response occurred in 90 patients (42%). Patients with an abnormal postexercise SBP response had more exercise-induced myocardial ischemia. more left ventricular impairment, and more extensive coronary artery lesions than those without. Cox proportional hazards model demonstrated that the abnormal postexercise SBP response was ranked first in ability to predict cardiac death (p = 0.025, relative risk 15.41). Bypass surgery was associated with an abnormal postexercise SBP ratio (p less than 0.05). Nonfatal reinfarction could not be predicted by any clinical or exercise variables. In conclusion, an abnormal postexercise SBP response could be useful for predicting cardiac death and the need for bypass surgery after myocardial infarction. This response is probably the result of myocardial ischemia and left ventricular impairment.\r"

  ".W": "Although exercise-induced ST segment depression is thought to be unreliable marker of myocardial ischemia in the presence of resting electrocardiographic changes, this conclusion is based on limited and disparate data from studies often lacking acceptable measures of ischemia. To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the ST segment response in a blinded prospective protocol, we compared ST deviation to thallium201 SPECT scintigraphy in 95 patients during exercise. Diagnostic accuracy was poor in the 95 patients with resting abnormalities: left bundle branch block (LBBB) = 70%, complete right bundle branch block (cRBBB) = 75%, incomplete right bundle branch block (incRBBB) = 79%, intraventricular conduction delay (IVCD) = 44%, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) = 59%, digitalis = 53%, compared with a diagnostic accuracy of 90% in 29 patients without resting changes. There were 20 false negative and 17 false positive ST segment responses. The extent and direction of resting ST deviation varied substantially and had no influence on diagnostic accuracy. The extent of change in ST deviation with exercise required for a positive response did not alter diagnostic accuracy: -1.0 mm = 61%, -1.5 mm = 63%, and -2.0 = 61%. While the location of regional ischemia did not influence the accuracy of ST segment analysis, a QRS duration less than 120 msec did improve diagnostic accuracy. Our data confirm that ST segment analysis with exercise testing is not reliable in patients with resting electrocardiographic abnormalities and demonstrates that accuracy is not improved by adjusting for either resting or exercise-induced ST segment changes or for location of the ischemic region.\r"

The effect of the intensity of the exercise on alterations in cholesterol and lipoprotein fractions has not been defined and is the subject of this study. We divided 49 healthy men (aged 44 +/- 8 years) into four groups and evaluated them before and after 12 weeks of cycle ergometer exercise training at (1) an intensity of 65% of maximal achieved heart rate, (2) 75% maximal heart rate, (3) 85% maximal heart rate, and (4) a 12-week nonexercise control period. Pre- and post-training evaluations included maximal ergometer exercise ECG examinations with measurement of maximal minute oxygen consumption and serum total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. Low-density (LDL) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol levels were calculated. Dietary histories were obtained before and after the training period, and body weight and percentage of body fat were measured. Post-training oxygen uptake was significantly increased (training effect) in the groups exercising to 65%, 75%, and 85% maximal heart rate. Results of within-group analysis showed significant increases in the HDL cholesterol fractions in the 75% and 85% groups but not in the 65% group or the control group. Significant decreases in calculated LDL fractions occurred only in the 75% exercise-trained group with maximal heart rate. Aerobic exercise training favorably alters plasma lipoprotein profiles. A minimum training intensity equal to 75% maximal heart rate is required to the increase HDL cholesterol level.\r"

At the time of diagnostic cardiac catheterization, three groups of five patients received dose of 1, 2, and 3 mg intravenous nifedipine at a rate of 0.33 mg/min. Hemodynamic measurements and blood collections were made before, during, and every 5 minutes for 30 minutes after infusion of nifedipine. Heart rate increased and mean arterial pressure decreased significantly after the 2 and 3 mg doses of nifedipine. Systemic vascular resistance was significantly decreased and cardiac index increased after all doses of nifedipine. Maximal left ventricular dp/dt (dp/dtmax) was significantly decreased after the 3 mg infusion. The reduction in dp/dtmax was most consistent with a reduction in left ventricular contractility as opposed to changes in loading conditions. Plasma concentrations of nifedipine were significantly correlated with bidirectional changes in dp/dtmax (r = 0.86). Nifedipine concentrations below 28.2 ng/ml were associated with a rise in dp/dtmax, whereas concentrations above that level were associated with a reduction in dp/dtmax. These data indicate that intravenous nifedipine produces dose- and concentration-dependent depression of myocardial contractility in patients with coronary artery disease. Nifedipine concentrations associated with negative inotropic effects are readily achievable with common oral and sublingual doses.\r"

  ".W": "A new breed of swine, the Yucatan microswine, that was derived from repetitive inbreeding of selected, small Yucatan swine, was investigated as an animal model of advanced vascular atherosclerosis. Nineteen animals were fed an atherogenic diet for 9.9 +/- 1.5 (mean +/- SEM) weeks before and 19.9 +/- 1.8 weeks after balloon endothelial denudation of all four iliac arteries. In 18 (94.7%) of the 19 microswine, angiography performed at 33 to 87 weeks of age disclosed some degree of luminal diameter narrowing: six animals (33.3%) had one-vessel, six (33.3%) had two-vessel, four (22.2%) had three-vessel, and two (11.1%) had four-vessel disease. In 38 (50%) of 76 denuded arteries, angiographically apparent luminal diameter narrowing was observed as follows: three arteries (7.9%) were narrowed less than 50%; 10 arteries (26.3%) were narrowed 50% to 75%; seven arteries (18.4%) were narrowed 76% to 99%; and 18 arteries (47.3%) were occluded. Sixty-four arteries were harvested from 16 of the 18 microswine with angiographically apparent luminal narrowing, which yielded 748 histologic sections. Maximum cross-sectional area narrowing from atherosclerotic plaque exceeded 90% in 135 (18%) of the sections examined, while 65 sections (9%) were narrowed 76% to 90%, and 127 sections (17%) were narrowed 51% to 75%. Atherosclerotic plaque in these animals appeared histologically similar to the so-called \"complex\" lesion that is typical of human atherosclerosis, which consists predominantly of collagen with focal calcific deposits and a minor lipid component. The smaller size and lower weight of these animals, in comparison with full-size farm pigs and \"minipigs,\" facilitated transportation, handling, and instrumentation. These findings establish the Yucatan microswine as a useful, representative, and economical atherosclerotic animal model for the evaluation of novel interventional techniques.\r"

Premature ventricular complexes were present in 86 patients and were categorized by a three-tier decision-making tree using (1) multiformity confirmed in two channels, (2) variable coupling of greater than 80 msec of premature ventricular complexes of similar QRS morphologies, and (3) repetitive forms of greater than or equal to 2 premature ventricular complexes. Variable coupling was present in 51 patients, among whom 35 (69%) had repetitive forms; multiformity was present in 46 patients, among whom 37 (80%) had repetitive forms; repetitive forms were present in 41 patients, among whom only one patient (2%) did not demonstrate multiformity or variable coupling. Variable coupling, multiformity, or either were significantly associated with the occurrence of repetitive forms (chi square = 34, 15, 29, respectively, each p less than 0.005). There was a bimodal distribution between patients with uniform, fixed coupled premature ventricular complexes who had rare repetitive forms (1 of 26) and patients with multiformity and variable coupling of premature ventricular complexes who had significantly more repetitive forms (30 of 37; p less than 0.001). The frequency distribution of repetitive form length suggested a natural break point between five and six consecutive complexes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Eleven normomagnesemic patients, seven with orthodromic reentrant supraventricular tachycardia that used an accessory AV pathway, and four with typical AV nodal reentry were examined. All patients had a history of sustained supraventricular tachycardia requiring pharmacologic therapy or electrical cardioversion for termination of tachycardia. After baseline electrophysiologic study, including documentation of sustained supraventricular tachycardia that was reproducibly induced, parenteral magnesium sulfate (a bolus of 0.3 mEq/kg of elemental magnesium infused over a 10-minute period followed by a maintenance infusion of 0.2 mEq/kg/hr) was administered during sustained supraventricular tachycardia. The serum magnesium concentration increased from (mean +/- standard deviation) 1.9 +/- 0.2 mg/dl to 4.0 +/- 0.6 mg/dl (p = 0.0001). Except for flushing and mild diaphoresis during infusion of the magnesium sulfate bolus, and dry heaves in one patient, there were no untoward effects or significant changes in systolic blood pressure. During administration of magnesium, the tachycardia cycle length increased from 319 +/- 39 msec to 348 +/- 43 msec (p = 0.0001). Slowing of the tachycardia occurred predominantly in the antegrade limb of the circuit at the level of the AV node with the AH interval increasing from 171 +/- 66 msec to 197 +/- 68 msec (p = 0.0001), whereas there was no significant change in the HV interval (43 +/- 3 msec to 43 +/- 4 msec, p = NS) or the VA interval (106 +/- 43 msec to 110 +/- 47 msec, p = NS) during tachycardia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Stimulation at the right ventricular apex consisted of 19 cycles of an initial CL, followed by a variable number of cycles (0 to 50 cycles) of a new CL, and an extrastimulus to test for VERP. Fifteen patients were enrolled in each part of the study. In part A, initial CLs were long (mean +/- standard error, 650 +/- 20 msec) and new CLs were short (325 +/- 10 msec). VERPs were 259 +/- 6 msec after the long cycles, 238 +/- 6 msec after one short cycle (p less than 0.05), 224 +/- 5 msec after 10 short cycles, and 210 +/- 6 msec after 50 short cycles (p less than 0.05 versus 1 or 10 short cycles). Thus 43% of total shortening of VERP occurred in the first short cycle and 57% occurred in subsequent short cycles. In part B, initial CLs were short and new CLs were long. VERPs were 212 +/- 7 msec after the short cycles, 237 +/- 7 msec after one long cycle (p less than 0.05), 239 +/- 7 msec after 10 long cycles, and 247 +/- 7 msec after 50 long cycles (p less than 0.05 versus 1 or 10 long cycles). Thus 71% of total lengthening of VERP occurred in the first long cycle and 29% occurred in subsequent long cycles. In conclusion, following an abrupt change of CL in man, VERP changes markedly in the first new cycle (immediate effect) and then undergoes further, more gradual change over a large number of subsequent cycles (cumulative effects). Cumulative effects appear to be greater following shortening of CL than following lengthening of CL.\r"

In the 29 patients who underwent aortography, a proximal acceleration signal was observed in all 18 patients with severe and moderate regurgitation and in only one of the 11 patients with mild regurgitation. The sensitivity for the diagnosis of severe regurgitation from the existence of a proximal acceleration signal was 100%, specificity 50%, and predictive accuracy 47%. A close correlation between the area of the proximal acceleration signal and the width of the aortic regurgitant jet signal was observed (r = 0.81). An acceleration area of 45 mm2 or more was observed in eight of the nine patients with severe regurgitation, in four of the nine patients with moderate regurgitation, and in none of the patients with mild regurgitation. Sensitivity for the diagnosis of severe regurgitation from an area of proximal acceleration of more than 45 mm2 was 89%, specificity 80%, and accuracy 67%. These results suggest that evaluation of the area of the supra-aortic abnormal signal may be a useful auxiliary aid in estimating the severity of aortic regurgitation.\r"

  ".W": "Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is associated with obvious hemodynamic and blood purification advantages over intermittent hemodialysis. To determine whether this is reflected in favorable left ventricular (LV) structure and function, a group of 55 normotensive patients (aged 58.4 +/- 11.0 years) undergoing CAPD was analyzed by means of echocardiography. Characteristic findings were LV hypertrophy (158 +/- 50 gm/m2), mainly the result of septal thickening (13.3 +/- 2.8 mm), and left atrial dilatation (40.9 +/- 7.4 mm). Mean LV diameter in end diastole and end systole and posterior wall thickness were normal. Parameters of LV systolic function (ejection fraction [EF]: 62.0 +/- 13.0%; velocity of circumferential fiber shortening [Vcf]: 1.58 +/- 0.46 circ/sec) were in the upper normal range at a hyperdynamic circulatory state (cardiac index [CI] 4.67 +/- 1.82 L/min/m2. The amount of LV hypertrophy was related to the amount of hypercirculation (CI: p less than 0.001; hemoglobin: p less than 0.025) and quality of blood purification (creatinine, urea: p less than 0.02) but not to blood pressure, age, or duration of dialysis. Left atrial dilatation was inversely related to LV systolic function (EF, Vcf: p less than 0.001) and directly related to LV muscle mass (p less than 0.02). A low prevalence (13%) of pericardial effusion was independent of blood purification. We conclude that in normotensive patients receiving CAPD, a high prevalence of left atrial dilatation and asymmetric septal hypertrophy is found, the latter being related both to the amount of hypercirculation and the quality of blood purification.\r"

The catheter has a 9F diameter and incorporates a steering arm by means of which the catheter tip may be made to curve through an arc of 0 to 180 degrees, entirely through external manipulation. In this way the tip of the guiding catheter may be positioned below the mitral valve orifice and used for the introduction of a smaller catheter into the left atrial cavity. We tested the system in 20 patients, eight of whom had mitral stenosis. Left atrial catheterization was successful in all cases, and no difficulties were encountered in entry of the left atrium, nor were there any complications during or after the procedure. The technique will provide useful in the study of left atrial function (hemodynamic, electrophysiologic, secretory). It may also be helpful in percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty by permitting retrograde, rather than transseptal, access to the left atrium.\r"

In white males aged 55 to 64 years, the percent of ischemic heart disease deaths coded as occurring out of hospital or in the ER ranged from 49.6% to 70.4%. The percents tended to be higher in mountain states and around Lake Michigan. However, neighboring states sometimes had very different percents. Within regions, percents were higher in nonmetropolitan than in metropolitan areas. Standard mortality ratios for white males of all ages revealed that several states had relatively high rates of death out of hospital or in the ER. These included New York, Michigan, and Wisconsin. High rates of coronary death out of hospital or in the ER may be due to high overall coronary death rates, high percent of coronary deaths occurring out of hospital or in the ER, or both. Further studies are needed of geographic variation in sudden coronary death and cardiac arrest and factors that might explain the variation such as emergency medical services. Place of death data from death certificates may be useful in monitoring efforts to prevent sudden coronary death.\r"

On separate study days, single intravenous bolus doses of 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 3, 5, and 7 mg of nicardipine were administered over a 2-minute period. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured for 6 hours after an intravenous bolus of nicardipine was given, and serum nicardipine levels were measured throughout the study. Although the antihypertensive effect occurred immediately during the bolus infusion, peak average decreases in systolic and diastolic pressure ranged from 20 to 25 and 15 to 44 mm Hg, respectively, and occurred 2.5 +/- 0.6 minutes after infusion. Heart rate increased by 12 to 40 beats/min during the peak effect. The mean duration of action after an intravenous bolus dose was 24 +/- 5 minutes. A dose-response relationship was observed, as both nicardipine dosage and plasma nicardipine concentration correlated with reduction in blood pressure. These data indicate that bolus administration of nicardipine may provide a practical approach for the rapid parenteral treatment of hypertensive states.\r"

Therefore rapid control of blood pressure is essential to prevent poor outcome. In this study, 30 American Society of Anesthesiologists class I and II patients who did not have cardiac surgery and subsequently developed postoperative hypertension were randomly assigned to receive either nicardipine, a new dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, or placebo. Intravenous nicardipine was given as a loading bolus of 10 mg/hr for 5 minutes and was titrated to 15 mg/hr if needed to achieve a therapeutic response. After therapeutic response, intravenous nicardipine was decreased to 3 mg/hr and subsequently titrated in increments of 1.0 to 2.5 mg/hr to maintain blood pressure control. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures during titration and maintenance did not differ significantly from preoperative levels in patients treated with nicardipine. The mean time to therapeutic response for the nicardipine-treated group was 8.67 +/- 1.46 minutes, and the median time to offset of action was 15 minutes. Eleven of the 12 patients who received placebo were crossed over to antihypertensive therapy, and of these, 10 received intravenous nicardipine. In this group all achieved therapeutic response in 7.3 +/- 1.18 minutes. The usefulness of intravenous nicardipine for postoperative hypertension was demonstrated in this study by: (1) the rapid control of blood pressure, (2) its continued efficacy during maintenance, and (3) little need to adjust dosage to control blood pressure.\r"

Nicardipine was administered as a 2 mg bolus followed by an infusion, titrated to maintain a 10 to 20 mm Hg decrease in systolic arterial pressure. At rest, nicardipine significantly decreased systemic and coronary vascular resistances and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure but increased coronary blood flow, heart rate, and myocardial oxygen consumption. With bicycle exercise performed to evoke myocardial ischemia, nicardipine prolonged exercise duration, time to of 1 mm ST segment depression, and increased cardiac work to onset of angina in most patients. These changes in cardiac performance were not associated with alteration in the product of systolic pressure and heart rate or with increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. During increased heart rate induced by atrial pacing to cause ischemia, the heart rate threshold for myocardial ischemia was not changed by nicardipine. This occurred despite decreased myocardial oxygen consumption, unchanged coronary blood flow, and otherwise similar hemodynamic changes as those observed during exercise. However, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure remained lower and stroke volume increased more after nicardipine with pacing stress when compared with observations before nicardipine with the same heart rate stress. These findings support beneficial antiischemic actions of nicardipine with possible prevention of ischemia-related left ventricular dysfunction.\r"

Several pharmacologic classes of a antihypertensive drugs are available to reduce blood pressure, but they do so by different hemodynamic mechanisms. The physiologic therapeutic goal in patients with hypertension is to normalize the systemic vascular resistance without inducing major alterations in the cardiac output. In this study we compared the antihypertensive and hemodynamic actions of nicardipine, a calcium antagonist, with propranolol, a beta-blocking drug. Both drugs were effective in the treatment of hypertension. However, while propranolol therapy decreased the resting and exercise left ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac output, cardiac function was well preserved during nicardipine therapy. It is concluded that both nicardipine and propranolol exert similar antihypertensive actions but that they cause dissimilar hemodynamic consequences in patients with uncomplicated hypertension.\r"

Calibrated 2-lead ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring performed for 39 +/- 2 hours starting 4 +/- 1 days after AMI identified silent myocardial ischemia, defined as greater than or equal to 1 mm ST-segment change lasting greater than or equal to 2 minutes, in 27 patients. These patients had 5 +/- 1 episodes lasting a median of 11 minutes/episode (range 2 to 36 minutes/episode). Patients with and without silent ischemia had comparable baseline demographics, were receiving similar anti-ischemic medications and had similar severity of coronary disease by angiography. No reinfarctions occurred during the in-hospital period. Fourteen of 27 patients (52%) with silent ischemia had greater than or equal to 1 in-hospital clinical ischemic event (pulmonary edema, n = 5, cardiac death, n = 1, and postinfarction angina, n = 11). In contrast, only 7 of 32 patients without silent ischemia (22%) had greater than or equal to 1 in-hospital event (pulmonary edema, n = 1, cardiac death, n = 1, and postinfarction angina, n = 6). The frequency of ischemic events was significantly greater in patients with silent ischemia compared to those without silent ischemia, p less than 0.02. Silent ischemia occurs frequently very early after AMI and identifies a group of patients who are at increased risk for adverse in-hospital clinical outcomes.\r"

In 58 consecutive patients, coronary angiography showed a complete isolated occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery; 43 patients (74%) had previous myocardial infarction. Duration of previous angina pectoris was defined as the time from the first ischemic symptom to the date of myocardial infarction or of coronary angiography in the absence of myocardial infarction. Left ventricular ejection fraction was measured on the 30 degrees right anterior oblique projection of the left ventricular angiogram. Collateral circulation was graded as follows: none or filling limited to side branches (group 1) and partial or complete filling of the epicardial arterial segment (group 2). Group 2 (40 patients) had higher ejection fraction (57 vs 38%; p less than 0.0001) and longer duration of previous angina pectoris (11 vs 0.1 months; p less than 0.002) than group 1 (18 patients). A longer duration of previous angina pectoris probably allows collateral development before coronary occlusion in 1-vessel coronary artery disease, thereby limiting myocardial damage.\r"

Alcohol consumption was divided into 4 categories: none (0 ml alcohol/week), light (1 to 100 ml alcohol/week), moderate (101 to 300 ml alcohol/week) and heavy (greater than or equal to 301 ml alcohol/week). Alcohol consumption was positively related to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and inversely related to total cholesterol, but was not associated with triglyceride. After adjustment for these serum lipids as well as for cigarette smoking and systemic hypertension, the risk of coronary stenosis was significantly decreased in the moderate drinkers. A decreased risk among moderate drinkers also was noted in terms of Gensini's severity score. These findings suggest that moderate alcohol consumption may protect against severe coronary atherosclerosis.\r"

Baseline signal-averaged electrocardiogram was abnormal in 20 patients (20%): a QRS duration greater than 115 ms was seen in 6 patients, a late potential (root mean square voltage of last 40 ms of QRS [RMS40] less than 25 microV) in 9, both abnormalities in 5, with no significant differences between groups 1 and 2 (26 vs 15%, respectively). In both groups, comparison of recordings obtained before, during and after dipyridamole test revealed no significant changes in QRS duration and RMS40. Absence of significant differences was also observed when patients with transient ischemic ST elevation or ST depression were examined separately. During the test, 100% of abnormal basal recordings remained abnormal and 98% of normal recordings remained within normal limits. In only 2 patients (from group 1) RMS40, which showed borderline values at baseline, decreased to abnormal values during dipyridamole test. These data suggest that electrophysiologic abnormalities induced by transient myocardial ischemia may not bear any relation with the substrate for chronic reentrant ventricular tachyarrhythmias, as reflected by late potentials on the signal-averaged electrocardiogram.\r"

The 22 patients were divided into 2 groups: death associated with increased cocaine levels at necropsy (13 patients, aged 23 to 45 years [mean 32], and mean total blood cocaine level, 0.36 mg/dl) and noncocaine-related death (9 patients, aged 15 to 50 years [mean 32]). Of the 22 patients, 17 were men and 5 were women; 19 were black and 3 were white. Gross examination in the 22 patients disclosed that 8 patients (36%) had 1 or more of the 4 major (left main, left anterior descending, left circumflex, and right) coronary arteries narrowed at some point greater than 75% in cross-sectional area by atherosclerotic plaque. In 17 cases, the 4 major epicardial coronary arteries were divided into 805 five-mm long segments and a histologic section was prepared from each segment: of the 12 patients with a cocaine-related death, 41 (8%) of 544 five-mm coronary segments were narrowed 76 to 100% and 106 segments (19%) were narrowed 51 to 75% in cross-sectional area by plaque. Of the 5 cocaine addicts who did not die from cocaine overdose, 8 (3%) of 261 five-mm coronary segments were narrowed 76 to 100% and 19 segments (7%) were narrowed 51 to 75% in cross-sectional area by plaque. The frequency of coronary artery disease was greater in patients dying with cocaine in their blood at necropsy compared to those whose death was not cocaine related.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "ST-segment depression was measured during submaximal dynamic (treadmill) and combined isometric-dynamic (isodynamic) exercise at comparable rate-pressure products in 11 patients (mean age 63 years) with stable coronary artery disease who were participating in an exercise training program. Each patient completed 3 separate trials. Trial 1 (baseline) was a submaximal treadmill exercise test to determine the threshold heart rate-systolic blood pressure (rate-pressure product) for ST-segment depression (greater than or equal to 1.0 mm). During trials 2 and 3, patients performed (in random order) dynamic treadmill exercise and isodynamic exercise (treadmill walking 1.5 to 2.0 mph carrying 15 to 25 kg) until threshold rate-pressure product was achieved. During trial 1, each patient showed significant ST depression (mean 1.7 mm) at target rate-pressure product (mean 18,200). Subsequent dynamic exercise trials 2 and 3 showed similar mean ST depression (1.5 mm) and rate-pressure product (18,000). During isodynamic exercise trials 2 and 3, subjects showed only minimal ST depression (mean 0.4 mm) at a rate-pressure product similar to dynamic exercise (mean 18,590). Heart rates were significantly lower (-10/min) and systolic (+20 mm Hg) and diastolic (+25 mm Hg) pressure was higher during isodynamic exercise (p less than 0.05). The rate-pressure product is not a valid index of ST response during isodynamic exercise in stable exercise-trained cardiac patients. Attenuation of ST depression during isodynamic exercise may be attributed to a combination of increased diastolic perfusion pressure, decreased heart rate and possibly to reductions in venous return and ventricular diastolic wall tension due to increased intrathoracic and abdominal pressure.\r"

From 1982 to 1987, 74 patients less than or equal to 25 years old (mean age 12.6 years) with WPW syndrome on electrocardiogram underwent electrophysiologic study. Of the 74 patients, 14 (19%) had a history of syncope. During electrophysiologic study 9 of 14 patients with syncope had sustained (greater than 5 minutes or requiring termination due to hypotension) AF. Of the remaining 5 patients, 3 had inducible nonsustained AF and 2 had no AF. None of the 60 patients without syncope developed sustained AF; 34 had nonsustained and 26 had no AF. Occurrence of sustained AF had a sensitivity of 64% and specificity of 100% for history of syncope. All patients with syncope and AF (12) had a short RR interval between 2 consecutive preexcited QRS complexes during AF at less than or equal to 220 ms, in contrast to 9 of 34 patients without syncope (p less than 0.001, sensitivity 100%, specificity 74%). No patient with a short RR interval between 2 consecutive preexcited QRS complexes during AF of greater than 220 ms had a history of syncope. Thus, in these young patients with WPW syndrome, occurrence of AF with a rapid ventricular response during electrophysiologic study correlated well with a history of syncope and may be the cause of syncope in most patients. Electrophysiologic study may be helpful in identification of young patients with WPW at risk for syncope.\r"

The purpose of this study was to look for the most sensitive stimulation protocol and criteria that would help to define the mechanism of reentry. In 20 patients (group I) atrial pacing up to second-degree atrioventricular block was performed under control conditions and isoproterenol, and SVT was induced in 14 patients (70%), 11 in the control state and 3 while receiving isoproterenol. In 20 patients (group II) atrial pacing and programmed atrial stimulation using 1 and 2 extrastimuli delivered at 2 cycle lengths (600 and 500 ms) was performed in the control state and while receiving isoproterenol. SVT was induced in all patients, in 13 patients in the control state and in 7 while receiving isoproterenol. Programmed stimulation always induced SVT and was the only method capable of tachycardia induction in 14 patients. The mechanism of SVT could be established in 91%. The measurement of the ventriculoatrial interval was the most useful sign to define the site of reentry. Occurrence of a bundle branch block helped to delineate the mechanism in 4 patients. When a positive P wave in V1 preceded the esophageal atrial electrocardiogram, it suggested that there was reentry through a left-sided accessory atrioventricular connection in 6 patients. SVT could always be induced by programmed atrial stimulation in the control state and under isoproterenol. The location of the P wave in V1 compared to the ventriculogram and the esophageal electrocardiogram helped to define the mechanism of tachycardia.\r"

Supine and upright plasma norepinephrine (NE), blood pressure (cuff) and cardiac output (acetylene rebreathing) were measured. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), carotid sinus pressure, stroke volume and systemic vascular resistance were calculated. Stroke volume was assumed to be proportional to the degree of stretch of cardiac mechanoreceptors, carotid sinus MAP was assumed to be proportional to carotid sinus stretch and plasma NE to reflect sympathetic nervous activity. Plasma NE correlated inversely with stroke volume (r = -0.62, p less than 10(-14] and estimated carotid sinus MAP (r = -0.33, p less than 0.0002) and positively with systemic vascular resistance (r = 0.59, p less than 10(-10]. Holding systemic vascular resistance constant by partial regression, the inverse relation between plasma NE and stroke volume remained (partial r = -0.36, p less than 0.02). Multiple linear regression yielded the equation: plasma NE (pg/ml) = 720 + 4.3 age - 5.1 stroke volume (ml) - 1.0 carotid sinus MAP (mm Hg). Substituting mean supine and upright values for stroke volume and carotid sinus MAP in this equation, it can be roughly estimated that changes in stroke volume account for as much as 60% of the postural variation in plasma NE in hypertensives, whereas only 15% of this variation is caused by changes in carotid sinus pressure. These findings suggest that cardiopulmonary baroreflexes are primary activators of the sympathetic nervous system during postural adaptation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Follow-up phonocardiograms showed periods when 5 of 18 patients with silent MVP developed mid- or late systolic clicks. Of 57 patients with mid- or late systolic clicks, 15 had silent MVP, 6 developed a late systolic murmur with or without systolic clicks and 1 developed a pansystolic murmur. Two of 9 patients with an isolated late systolic murmur developed a pansystolic murmur. M-mode echocardiograms showed that left atrial and left ventricular dimensions at end-diastole and end-systole increased in patients with systolic murmur (33 +/- 10 vs 35 +/- 11, 46 +/- 6 vs 50 +/- 7 and 29 +/- 4 vs 31 +/- 5 mm, respectively, all p less than 0.001) and no statistically significant changes in any of these dimensions were found in patients without a systolic murmur. The degree of MVP evaluated by the anteroposterior mitral leaflet angle on the 2-dimensional echocardiogram was more severe in patients with a systolic murmur than in patients without systolic murmur (157 +/- 12 vs 131 +/- 16 degrees, p less than 0.001). The degree of prolapse did not change during the follow-up periods.

In vitro radiofrequency ultrasonic quantitative analysis of the mitral valve has been demonstrated to be a reliable tool in identifying normal, fibrotic and calcific valves. This study evaluates quantitative ultrasound characterization of the mitral valve in vivo. Thirty-three patients, scheduled to undergo mitral valve replacement, and 20 normal subjects (10 young and 10 older control subjects) were studied with a 2.25-MHz transducer. Radiofrequency signal was analyzed by a microprocessor system (used with an M-mode commercially available echocardiograph) for on-line evaluation of ultrasonic backscatter with 8 bits of amplitude resolution, 40-MHz sampling rate and a 1-microsecond acquisition gate. The integrated value of the rectified radiofrequency signal amplitude was deemed the integrated backscatter index. The highest value recorded with the ultrasonic analysis from each valve was taken as representative and expressed as the percent value with respect to the pericardial integrated backscatter index value of that subject. The 33 excised mitral valves underwent histologic examination. Four groups were identified: young controls (group I, n = 10); older controls age-matched with patients (group II, n = 10); patients with fibrotic mitral valves (group III, n = 13); and patients with calcific mitral valves (group IV, n = 20).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Five of 16 (31%) sustained VT and none of nonsustained VT patients had left ventricular aneurysms (p less than 0.05). These data indicate that VT is frequently inducible in patients with sustained VT and nonsustained VT and chronic Chagasic myocarditis.

This technique evaluates the whole cardiac cycle in short overlapping intervals and yields information for systolic and diastolic events, without assumptions regarding the position and orientation of the ventricle. Diastolic regional wall motion abnormalities were found in 31 of 32 patients and systolic abnormalities were present in 16 patients. Asynchronous regions most commonly detected during diastole were anteroapical and apical; they were found in 19 of 32 patients. Regional contraction abnormality was observed in the apical and the anteroapical regions in 6 of 16 patients. Dilatation-induced changes in left ventricular shape exaggerate the phenomenon of higher wall stress at the apex of the normal ventricle. Basal wall motion is thus relatively preserved in dilated cardiomyopathy.\r"

To assess the clinical correlates and potential determinants of LV mass, the relation of echocardiographically determined LV mass to a variety of clinical parameters was examined in a general population. From 1979 to 1983 Framingham Heart Study participants underwent routine evaluation including medical history, physical examination and M-mode echocardiography. LV mass was determined using an anatomically validated formula that incorporates measurements of LV wall thickness and LV internal diameter. The study population consisted of 2,226 men and 2,746 women (mean age 51 years, range 17 to 90). Age, height, systolic blood pressure and body mass index (a measure of obesity) were statistically significant and independent correlates of LV mass in both sexes (p less than 0.001). In men under age 50, leisure-time physical activity was associated with LV mass (p less than 0.05), but this was not observed in women. Results from multivariate analyses in which body mass index and subscapular skinfold thickness were included suggest that lean body mass is correlated with LV mass. Maintenance of ideal body weight and normal blood pressure, weight reduction in obese persons and blood pressure control in hypertensive patients may contribute to the primary and secondary prevention of LV hypertrophy and its sequelae. Clinical interpretation of echocardiograms should include consideration of the correlates of LV mass to gain better insight into the pathogenesis of LV hypertrophy.\r"

  ".W": "Doppler analysis of mitral flow provides a means of analyzing left ventricular (LV) diastolic function. While experimental studies have suggested that changes in left atrial pressure may affect the normal pattern of early diastolic filling, the effect of such changes on abnormal patterns of filling is unknown. Accordingly, the Doppler pattern of LV filling was analyzed in 20 subjects with LV hypertrophy (mean age 59 +/- 13 years, +/- standard deviation), in 25 healthy normal subjects (29 +/- 6 years) and in 11 elderly subjects (68 +/- 5 years). All underwent Doppler examination of LV inflow at rest and immediately after postural changes. In all 3 groups, head-down positioning increased early diastolic flow velocity (E) (p less than 0.001), and raised the E to late diastolic flow velocity (A) ratio (p less than 0.01). However, an abnormal E/A ratio never approached a normal resting value. Likewise, although E and the E/A ratio decreased significantly in normal subjects with head-up positioning, it did not become abnormal. The magnitude of change in E, A and E/A ratio did not differ among the 3 groups in response to postural changes. Thus, alterations of LV loading conditions alter the pattern of LV filling, whether normal or abnormal at baseline. The magnitude of change appears to be independent of the resting flow pattern. Although loading conditions may affect the Doppler pattern of filling, simple changes in venous return do not \"normalize\" an abnormal pattern, nor do they \"abnormalize\" a normal pattern.\r"

In contrast, recently developed digital Holter devices immediately digitize and analyze the electrocardiogram (ECG) on-line and may therefore be more reliable for ST-segment analysis. To test this hypothesis, the results of digital, on-line, 2-channel ST-segment analysis were directly compared to those of analog amplitude-modulated recordings in identical leads (CM5 and CM3), using a stripchart recorder meeting the American Heart Association specifications as the standard. Thirty-five patients (25 with coronary artery disease and 10 control subjects) underwent graded treadmill exercise testing. The reference ECG mean value for ST-segment depression in CM5 was -1.4 +/- 1.2 mm and in CM3 -0.5 +/- 1.2 mm. For digital analysis, the mean values and correlation coefficients for CM5 were -1.5 +/- 1.1 mm (r = 0.97) and for CM3 -0.8 +/- 1.3 mm (r = 0.93). For analog recording, the results for CM5 were -2.1 +/- 1.7 mm (r = 0.88) and for CM3 -1.3 +/- 1.9 mm (r = 0.85). The mean duration of ST-segment depression with the reference ECG was 7.1 +/- 4.1 minutes. Digital Holter showed a significantly better agreement (7.4 +/- 4.4 min, r = 0.97) than analog Holter (9.6 +/- 5.6 min, r = 0.84). Because analog amplitude-modulated Holter recordings overestimated the degree and duration of ischemic episode, digital, on-line and full disclosure devices should be preferred to assess myocardial ischemia.\r"

The clinical diagnosis alone of both venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism is inaccurate because of the insensitivity and nonspecificity of findings, a problem that also occurs with a variety of other disorders. Invasive, objective tests are still the reference standard, but they are not always easy to perform, they cannot be used for a considerable number of very ill patients, and they create some patient discomfort. There is an increasing trend toward using noninvasive methods, either alone or in combination. These methods entail less risk, can be performed more quickly and conveniently, and are usually more cost-effective. Practical approaches to diagnosing venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in the clinical setting are discussed.\r"

Both blastomas and embryonal lungs showed expression of cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, and carcinoembryonic antigen in their epithelial elements, and both contained scattered chromogranin-positive neuroendocrine cells. Rare surfactant-producing and Clara cell antigen-elaborating cells were identified in both groups. The mesenchymal components of blastomas and fetal lung showed smooth muscle, myofibroblastic, and blastematous differentiation. The blastematous elements demonstrated vimentin and keratin coexpression in four cases, providing some support for the contention that pluripotential blastema may give rise to the epithelial and mesenchymal elements of the distal lobule.\r"

Based on evidence of intercellular cohesion, as seen in the histologic results, the patients were placed into two subtypes, compact growth type and louse structure type. The survival rates were 46% and 28% at five years, respectively (P less than 0.05). Immunohistochemically, keratin, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), secretory component, lactoferrin, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), as histologic markers of epithelial differentiation, were detectable in large cell carcinoma of both types and more frequently in the compact growth type than in the loose structure type. The difference was significant in case of detection of keratin, EMA, and CEA (P less than 0.05). These observations suggest that a large cell carcinoma may differentiate into an adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. The presence of intercellular cohesion and use of these markers reflect prognosis of the disease.\r"

All cases were histologically examined and classified according to Salyer and Eggleston and to Marino and Muller-Hermelink classifications. Therefore, thymomas were subtyped as predominantly lymphocytic, mixed and predominantly epithelial and cortical, mixed and medullary, respectively. The frequency of the different histologic subtypes was determined, and histologic findings were related to patients' age, surgical stage, and survival. Through the application of Salyer and Eggleston classification, the three histologic subtypes did not correlate with patients' ages at time of diagnosis, surgical stage as determined by local infiltration, and prognosis as determined by survival curves. On the contrary, when Marino and Muller-Hermelink classification was applied, statistically significant relationships between histologic results and age, surgical stage, and prognosis were demonstrated. These results and their implications are discussed, with special reference to the important problem of histogenesis of thymomas and of their clinicopathologic staging.\r"

  ".W": "Clinicopathologic correlations were explored in 79 patients at high risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who had lymph node biopsy for persistent lymphadenopathies and were followed for intervals of up to 7.2 years. Three histologic patterns, follicular hyperplasia with cytolysis (A), follicular involution with hypervascularity (C), and a combination of the previous two (B), were recognized. Ninety lymph node biopsies (79 primary and 11 sequential) were classified into the three histologic patterns and the results correlated with the immunologic data and clinical course. Of 31 patients who showed a pattern A at the initial biopsy, the condition of 58% remained stationary and 42% progressed to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS); of 31 patients who had initial B pattern, the condition of 36% remained stationary and 64% progressed to AIDS; and of 17 patients who initially had histologic pattern C, the condition of 6% remained stationary and 94% progressed to AIDS. Forty-one patients died during this follow-up, representing 32% of those who had a pattern A, 52% of those who had a pattern B, and 88% of those who had a pattern C at the initial lymph node biopsy. Medial survival times were 54.4 months for pattern A, 35.6 months for pattern B, and 8.4 months for pattern C. Sequential biopsies showed persistence of the same pattern or changes generally in the direction of pattern A to pattern C over variable amounts of time. Lymphocyte evaluation expressed by total counts of T4 cells, T8 cells, T4/T8 cell ratios, and anti-lymphocyte antibody levels expressed by increases in counts of surface immunoglobulin-positive lymphocytes showed positive correlations with lymph node histologic patterns. All three parameters proved to be useful prognostic indicators for the course of the HIV infection. The pathogenetic significance of lymph node histologic patterns, although not clearly understood, suggests the relation of follicular hyperplasia (pattern A) to acute viral lymphadenitis and of follicular involution with hypervascularity (pattern C) to cellular immune deficiency.\r"

The mitotic rate per 20 high-power fields (HPFs) was also determined for each case. The PTCLs showed significantly higher proliferative activity than the HD cases, as evidenced by a mean S + G2M of 12.0% versus 5.0% for HD and a median mitotic rate of 27 versus 5 mitoses per 20 HPFs in the HD cases. Because morphologic distinction, particularly of mixed cellularity HD (HDMC), from the diffuse small cleaved cell (DSCCL) or mixed cell (DMCL) pattern of PTCL may at times be difficult, these subgroups were compared separately. The 2 cases of DSCCL plus 12 of DMCL yielded a higher proportion of S-phase cells than the 9 HDMC cases with S + G2M means of 9.9% versus 3.3% and a higher mitotic rate, median 21 versus 7 per 20 HPFs. These findings suggest that S-phase determination and mitotic rate provide additional parameters in discriminating PTCL from HD in the most histologically similar cases.\r"

Thereafter, heparin was infused for 10 days. Serial coagulation and fibrinolytic parameters were studied over 46 to 72 hours after the streptokinase infusion. A generalized fibrinolytic state was produced in both groups as evidenced by a fall in fibrinogen and plasminogen levels, prolongation of thrombin and reptilase clotting times, a rise in fibrinogen degradation products, and a shortening of the euglobulin lysis time. Recovery to preinfusion levels was similar in both groups of patients. Hemorrhagic complications requiring blood replacement occurred in 7/23 (30%) treated IC, and 4/23 (17%) in the IV group.\r"

Thirty-six well-differentiated squamous cell lesions of skin were independently classified as either WDSCC or KA by a panel of three pathologists. Six poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinomas (PDSCC) also were included in this study. Sections from paraffin blocks were prepared by standard techniques and analyzed by FCM. Mean DI values were: KA 0.96%, WDSCC 0.99%, and PDSCC 0.88%. The differences in the mean DIs were not statistically significant. Mean PI values were as follows: KA 16.7%, WDSCC 14.8%, and PDSCC 20.2%. Differences were not statistically significant. The authors conclude that the FCM measurements of DI and PI do not help in separating KA and WDSCC of skin.\r"

Obtaining sufficient serum quantity can be a problem when testing blood from transported neonates not accompanied by maternal samples. Reducing serum volumes used for testing might result in missed antibodies. The authors studied 1,177 sera for unexpected red cell antibodies by comparing one versus two drops of patient serum using a technique with LISS at 37 degrees C through the antiglobulin phase. The serum-to-red cell ratio using two drops was approximately 50: 1. Results of 60% (58/96) of samples containing antibody benefited by the use of increased serum. Eighteen percent; (17/96) had antibodies detected only with two drops that were missed entirely by one, and 43% (41/96) showed stronger positive reactions using two drops versus one. Importantly, antibodies detected only with or enhanced by two drops were clinically significant (anti-D, anti-K, anti-M, anti-c, anti-E). Thus, reducing serum-to-cell ratio is potentially dangerous, and blood banks should insist on adequate sample size to ensure patient safety.\r"

The charts of 34 patients were reviewed for evidence of sepsis or meningitis and the physician's response to the positive cultures. Three patients had subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE) with multiple positive blood cultures. All other patients, including six oncology patients, failed to show a positive correlation between the isolation of VS or NHS and the disease process. Speciation and MIC testing were performed on 13 isolates, including those from all SBE and four oncology patients. Because of the lack of significance of VS and NHS from blood and CSF specimens in patients other than those with SBE, the authors conclude that extensive microbiologic workup of VS and NHS is not necessary without appropriate clinical indications such as SBE or immunosuppression.\r"

Although the majority of insulinomas are benign, a significant proportion (4-16%) behave aggressively. Because malignant potential cannot be assessed adequately by histopathologic criteria, reliable serum and immunocytochemical markers for malignancy have been sought. Recent reports suggest that subunits of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) are of prognostic value in pancreatic endocrine tumors. Elevated serum levels of either the alpha-subunit or beta-subunit of hCG have been reported to be associated with malignancy in pancreatic endocrine tumors. Both hCG and its alpha-subunit have been demonstrated in malignant pancreatic endocrine tumors by immunohistochemistry. In this study, 17 insulinomas have been analyzed by immunohistochemistry using monospecific antibodies to both the alpha-subunit and beta-subunit of hCG. Clinical follow-up was obtained in all cases, and four of the tumors proved to be malignant. Alpha-subunit immunoreactivity was found in only two tumors, both of which were benign. Immunoreactivity for the beta-subunit was not found in any tumor. The authors' results indicate that for this subset of pancreatic endocrine tumors, staining for hCG subunits is of no value in predicting malignant behavior.\r"

Persistent but erratic elevation of percent hemoglobin F positive cells, as determined by a modified Kleihauer-Betke method, complicated the remainder of her pregnancy. The clinical impression of placental abruption with possible extension could not be documented by ultrasound or examination of the placenta at delivery. Hemoglobin electrophoresis followed by quantitative fetal hemoglobin first suggested the diagnosis of HPFH, which was confirmed seven months postpartum. Furthermore, the magnitude of percent positive F-cells could be profoundly altered by subtle changes in pH of the acid elution reagent. This case demonstrates that positive acid elution tests for maternal-fetal transfusion may be caused by elevated maternal hemoglobin F. Erratic results, elevated quantitative hemoglobin-F and sensitivity to reagent pH should alert the pathologist to this diagnosis and alter clinical management.\r"

The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that leukotrienes in tracheal lavage fluid are elevated in bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Twenty-six intubated infants (10 with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, 9 with hyaline membrane disease, and 7 normal controls) had tracheal lavage leukotriene levels determined by radioimmunoassay. Lavage fluid cell counts (alveolar macrophages) and leukotriene levels were significantly increased in infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The increased concentration of leukotrienes seen in the infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia would suggest a possible role for these compounds in the pathophysiology of this disease.\r"

We enrolled 176 healthy infants less than 1 year of age in a randomized controlled trial to determine the effects of diet on the course of mild diarrhea. When diarrhea occurred (56 episodes), infants were randomly assigned to a treatment diet (24 hours of electrolyte solution then dilute soy formula, dilute cow's milk formula, or undiluted soy formula) or their usual formula. Parents recorded daily weights, stool losses, and oral intake. The difference in effects of unrestricted and treatment diets was small and not clinically significant. Patients on an unrestricted diet averaged 0.7 fewer days of diarrhea (95% confidence interval [CI], -1.43 to 0.02), 5.0 fewer total stools (95% CI, -10.26 to 0.33), and 1% less weight loss (95% CI, 2% to -1%) compared with those receiving a treatment diet. Treatment failures were similar in both groups. An unrestricted diet does not appear to affect the course or symptoms of mild diarrhea.\r"

Adequate transmissions during symptoms were obtained in 36 (59%) of 61 patients. Goals of monitoring were achieved in all 13 patients with previous diagnoses. Of the 25 of 48 patients without prior diagnoses who provided transmissions during symptoms, 15 had sinus rhythm, while 10 manifested an arrhythmia. Abnormal transmissions were most common in patients with palpitations and never evident in patients with symptoms of chest pain.\r"

We compared values of 272 samples of serum glucose with values simultaneously obtained by chromogen test strips (Chemstrip bG) in newborns. The diagnostic sensitivity of a chromogen test strip less than 2.2 mmol/L for predicting a serum glucose level less than 1.9 mmol/L was 86% (95% confidence interval [CI], 75% to 94%), with 78% specificity (95% CI, 73% to 84%). The positive predictive value in our specimens, with a 21% prevalence of serum glucose levels less than 1.9 mmol/L, was 52% (95% CI, 41% to 62%), with a negative predictive value of 95% (95% CI, 91% to 100%). Fifty-eight of our serum glucose values were less than 1.9 mmol/L and the levels obtained by chromogen test strip were greater than or equal to 2.2 mmol/L in 8 of these cases. Review of these 8 cases showed that a delay in performing the laboratory glucose oxidase serum glucose could account for the discrepancy in 2 cases. Chromogen test strips are readily available and easy to use, but more sensitive, specific, accurate, and precise methods of serum glucose screening in newborns are needed.\r"

Levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D provided a measure of vitamin D sufficiency. As expected, blood lead level was associated with pica scores. However, none of the calcium measures differed between cases and controls. Controlling for four confounders (season, pica score, maternal education, and sex), yielded no significant differences between the two groups in the mean values of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level. There was no interaction between blood lead level and the four covariates. No relationship could be demonstrated between calcium status and the pica scores.\r"

As part of the establishment of regulations for the Michigan Department of Social Services, Lansing, a triage model has been developed that provides a means of standardizing the screening process used to admit mildly ill children to such centers. We present pilot guidelines for use by center personnel, discuss considerations inherent in formulating triage policy for child-care centers for sick children, and provide a starting point for those attempting to standardize regulations governing child-care centers for sick children.\r"

Overall, respiratory tract problems and ear, nose, and throat surgery were the most common reasons for readmissions. Malformations and intensive care sequelae infrequently caused readmissions. No combination of sociodemographic or perinatal variables identified the VLBW children who were destined for hospital readmissions. At 5 years of age, the VLBW children, compared with the normal-birth-weight children, had significantly more ongoing sensorineural problems (29.9% and 10.6%, respectively), ongoing respiratory problems (39.6% and 19.1%, respectively), and other morbidities (31.0% and 17.0%, respectively).

  ".W": "The aim of the present study was to elucidate the role of hole size and thickness in determining milk flow through nipple units during bottle feeding. Commonly used standard nipple units (SMA single-hole, Enfamil single-hole, and Twist-on) for term and preterm infants, as well as Nuk-type nipple units (SMA Nuk, Enfamil Natural, and Nuk) were tested. The size of the nipple hole and wall thickness were determined for each nipple unit. Airflow was measured by forcing pressurized air through the feed hole. Simulated sucks were used to measure the milk flow. A marked variability in airflow and milk flow was observed within and among the various types of nipple units studied. Within each type of nipple unit, both milk flow and airflow measurements correlated well with hole size. The thickness of the nipple units contributed minimally to the observed variability. We conclude that differences in hole size primarily account for the observed variability in milk flow. This finding may be clinically important in that rapid milk flow can lead to apnea and bradycardia in some preterm infants. The above observations imply that design changes are necessary to reduce the variability of milk flow within each nipple type. Moreover, milk-flow measurements made using a simple mechanical system and airflow measurements used by the industry are equally sensitive to evaluate nipple flow.\r"

Sixteen (7.6%) showed persistent microalbuminuria (mean albumin excretion rate of 70.9 +/- 56.2 micrograms/min). There were no significant differences between those with and without microalbuminuria with respect to age, sex, disease duration, and blood pressure over the previous 9 months and hemoglobin A1c level measured over the preceding 3 years. Within the group with microalbuminuria, there was no correlation between albumin excretion rate and blood pressure. However, there was a significant positive correlation between log albumin excretion rate and mean hemoglobin A1c values measured over the preceding 3 years. Our findings suggest that when microalbuminuria has developed, poorer metabolic control is associated with a higher albumin excretion rate. An actual rise in systemic blood pressure may not always precede the development of microalbuminuria.\r"

We hypothesized that such treatments would be associated with symptoms of the vulnerable child syndrome, persisting up to 6 months. Mothers of otherwise healthy infants who had jaundice and demographically similar infants without jaundice born at Yale-New Haven (Conn) Hospital were surveyed and compared 6 months after discharge from the hospital. By 6 months, the infants with jaundice had significantly more feeding difficulties, eg, they were less likely to be breast-feeding. Unexpectedly, the mothers of infants with jaundice switched from being less likely to leave their infants with someone else at 1 month to leaving the infants significantly more than mothers of infants in the comparison group. Although the mothers of infants in the comparison group reported a similar number of infant health problems, the mothers of infants with jaundice were more likely to judge the problems as serious and to have taken the infant to an emergency department. The benefits of treating jaundice in otherwise healthy infants should be weighted against the risks of developing the vulnerable child syndrome.\r"

Symptoms elicited included vaginal pain, increased urinary frequency, dysuria, and enuresis. A urinalysis was performed for all victims with symptoms, and those with positive or equivocal urinalysis results had a urine culture done. Urinalysis and urine culture were performed on a control group of 53 consecutive asymptomatic victims. Twenty percent (85/428) of the victims complained of one or more genitourinary symptoms. The most common symptom was vaginal pain (51%). Of the symptomatic victims, only 2 had a urinary tract infection. None of the 53 asymptomatic control victims had a urinary tract infection. There was no significant relationship between the presence of genitourinary symptoms and repetitive abuse, genital trauma, vaginal contact, or gender of the victim. However, patients younger than 6 years of age were more likely to have genitourinary symptoms than older patients. These findings indicate that urinary tract symptoms following sexual abuse are common but that urinary tract infection is quite uncommon. Our study does not support routine screening of children for urinary tract infection solely because they have been sexually abused.\r"

We present a statistical method for quantifying the certainty of diagnoses and defining a normal range, and illustrate its application with a specific example from a Tay-Sachs disease carrier screening program. This method can be applied to any test result based on a continuous variable and is particularly well suited to screening programs where the risk or incidence of a disease is known. We use an inconclusive range to reduce the likelihood of incorrect diagnoses resulting from measurement error and borderline results. The limits of the normal, inconclusive, and nonnormal ranges are based on three considerations: (1) the probability of misdiagnoses, (2) the expected frequency of inconclusive diagnoses, and (3) the reproducibility of the test results.\r"

The etiology, pathogenesis, and management of radiation enteritis are discussed. Two case reports exemplify the progressive nature of the disease. Case 1 demonstrates the classical picture of multiple exacerbations and remissions of partial small bowel obstruction and the eventual need for surgical management ten years after radiation therapy. Case 2 presents the more severe sequelae of an acute perforation with a 14-yr latency period. Predisposing factors in the progression of radiation injury include excessive radiation, underlying cardiovascular disease, fixation of the bowel, and an asthenic habitus. In both cases, radiation injury was localized to a discrete segment of bowel; therefore, resection with a primary end-to-end anastomosis was performed. In addition, diseased bowel was eliminated and, therefore, would not cause further complications such as intractable bleeding or fistula formation. The review focuses on current knowledge which may be applied to the treatment and prevention of radiation enteritis.\r"

  ".W": "Urinary and plasma gastrin immunoreactivities in normal subjects were studied by radioimmunoassays using three region-specific antisera. Urinary excretion of NH2-terminal big gastrin immunoreactivity (NT G-34-IR) in the fasting state (0.79 +/- 0.17 pmol/kg/h, mean +/- SE) was several hundred times as much as that of either COOH-terminal gastrin or gastrin/cholecystokinin immunoreactivity. Urinary NT G-34-IR increased significantly after feeding, and correlated closely with integrated plasma NT G-34-IR. Renal clearance of NT G-34-IR was 62.4 +/- 7.9 ml/min and about one hundred times greater than that of any other gastrin immunoreactivities, indicating that there exist different catabolic pathways of gastrin peptides in the kidney. Gel filtration of urine extract revealed that a single giant peak of NT G-34-IR eluted in a later position than NH2-terminal heptadecapeptide of big gastrin. These results suggest that most of plasma NT G-34-IR is excreted in urine, and urinary excretion of NT G-34-IR reflects well-integrated plasma NT G-34-IR. Therefore, urinary NT G-34-IR may serve as a feasible indicator for gastrin secretion.\r"

Plasma concentrations of glucagon, secretin, and norepinephrine were similar in cirrhotics with gastric vascular ectasia and cirrhotics without this lesion, these concentrations being significantly higher (p less than 0.05) than in healthy controls. However, there was no significant difference between plasma levels of arginine-vasopressin in patients with cirrhosis (with or without gastric vascular ectasia) and those in healthy controls. The biosynthesis of prostaglandin E2 in the antrum of the gastric mucosa was significantly higher in cirrhotics with gastric vascular ectasia than in cirrhotics without this lesion (p less than 0.05) and healthy controls (p less than 0.005). Prostaglandin E2 in the corpus was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) in cirrhotics with gastric vascular ectasia than in healthy controls. The biosynthesis of 6-keto PGF1 alpha (a stable metabolite of prostacyclin) and PGF2 alpha in the corpus and antrum of gastric mucosa was not significantly different in cirrhotics with gastric vascular ectasia, cirrhotics without this lesion and healthy controls. Since prostaglandin E2 has a vasodilator and acid-inhibitory effect, we speculate that high content of this prostanoid in the gastric mucosa may play a role in the pathogenesis of ectatic capillaries and acid inhibition present in some cirrhotic patients.\r"

Seven healthy subjects served as controls. The reflux was assessed both by using 99mTc diethyliminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scintigraphy and by measuring intragastric bile acid levels following endoscopic gastric juice aspiration. Before therapy, duodenal ulcer patients had significantly higher intragastric bile acid concentrations than did normal subjects (p less than 0.001). After truncal vagotomy and drainage, or partial gastrectomy, bile acid levels increased significantly, whereas they remained unchanged after medical therapy. Conversely, they were found to be significantly decreased after highly selective vagotomy. The results of HIDA scan measurements were compatible with those of gastric juice bile acids. We conclude that surgical treatment for duodenal ulcer by highly selective vagotomy is the only form of therapy, among the types considered, that leads to a reduction in duodenogastric reflux. It is of interest that medical therapy of the duodenal ulcer does not improve abnormal duodenogastric reflux, possibly contributing to both the failure of the medical treatment and recurrence of the ulcer.\r"

Excessive enteric protein loss was found in only two patients, confirming the relative infrequency of this condition. In addition, enteric protein loss did not appear to correlate with the serum albumin level; neither did it influence treatment or prognosis of the CCF.

Twenty-two geriatric facility resident volunteers, mean age 82 yr (range 65-94 yr) participated, of whom 16 had gastrointestinal dysmotility symptoms. Orocecal TT in the elderly subjects did not differ from that in younger adult controls (100 +/- 11 min vs 93 +/- 20 min). However, orocecal TT was longer in geriatric females (112 +/- 14 min) than in males (70 +/- 6 min, p less than 0.01). We conclude that age alone does not prolong orocecal TT, except when dysmotility symptoms have been present for a prolonged period.\r"

When they do occur in adults, intestinal obstruction or inflammation is the usual mode of presentation, hemorrhage being much less common. The patient described in this case report was 78 yr old, presented initially with iron deficiency anemia and, later, developed severe acute hemorrhage. The cause of the hemorrhage was ulceration at the tip of an invaginated Meckel's diverticulum. The ulceration was not peptic in origin, as is usually the case in similar presentations in children, no ectopic oxyntic mucosa being detected in the diverticulum of our patient. In previous reports, invaginated Meckel's diverticula have always been accompanied by intussusception, and abdominal pain has been an important part of the symptom complex in such patients. Our patient had no abdominal pain, and no intussusception was noted at surgery. This case emphasizes the need for considering a Meckel's diverticulum as the source of acute or chronic hemorrhage, irrespective of the patient's age. The utility of radionuclide blood pool imaging in arriving at a diagnosis in these cases is discussed.\r"

In another patient, the proximal end of the stent was embedded in liver parenchyma in the lateral view during fluoroscopy, despite apparently good positioning in the anteroposterior view. Avoidance of central puncture during establishment of percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage and checking two planes with fluoroscopy may help to reduce this risk. Close attention to these potential technical pitfalls would further improve the success rate of endoscopic biliary stenting.\r"

Endotoxin, a component of the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria, has been reported to be pro-cystogenic in experimental animals. Because endotoxin levels in urines (endotoxiuria) from PKD patients have not been reported, the Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay, which detects picogram quantities of endotoxin, was used to probe for this cyst-promoting chemical. Fifteen PKD patients (seven females, eight males), asymptomatic for UTI, were tested and compared with 10 female and 10 male controls. All urines were assessed for (1) evidence of aerobic bacteria by routine quantitative cultures, (2) bacteria and pyuria by microscopic examination of gram-stained urine, and (3) bacterial endotoxin by the LAL assay. LAL tests were positive in 73% (11/15) of PKD patients, but only 25% (5/20) of controls (P = 0.0058). There was no significant difference in test positivity between PKD females (71%) and males (75%). There was no correlation of age, degree of renal dysfunction, or urine osmolality with endotoxiuria. Routine quantitative cultures were negative for gram-negative bacteria in PKD patients and all controls (except one female), as were microscopic findings for intact bacteria and pyuria. Thus endotoxiuria, in the absence of classical signs, symptoms, and microbiological findings of UTI, raises the possibility that endotoxin is available intrarenally to promote cystogenesis even before a potential susceptibility of PKD patients to classical UTI is manifested. Sources of urinary endotoxin observed in PKD patients, such as cryptic intrarenal sites or leakage from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, remain to be defined.\r"

Cystic kidney cells in vitro stained positive for lectins from Cancanavalia ensiformis (concanavalin A), Triticum vulgaris, Erythrina cristagalli, Ulex europeaus, and Arachis hypogaea. Immunocytochemical and lectin staining revealed the renal and peritoneal cells to be of collecting tubule and mesothelial origin, respectively. Both cell types showed large depositions of glycogen granules in the cytoplasm during propagation in certain culture media; in kidney cells, dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) abolished glycogen depositions. Glycogen deposition also was observed in liver tissue obtained by needle biopsy from one patient. No bacteria were cultured from nor endotoxin detected in the renal cyst fluid. Relative to serum, the cyst fluids contained low sodium, potassium, and chloride levels. Thus, cultured ARPKD cells demonstrate a number of characteristics that are different from cells derived from the autosomal dominant form of renal cystic disease (ADPKD).\r"

We examined a group of 59 patients who underwent cadaveric renal transplantation and elective conversion from cyclosporine to azathioprine 8.3 +/- 3.8 months following transplantation. Forty-three of these patients received a first transplant and had panel-reactive antibodies (PRA) less than 40% (unsensitized). Sixteen patients received at least their second allograft or had PRA of 40% or more (sensitized). Average follow-up was 17.9 +/- 8.2 months. Nine patients (15%) failed conversion as manifested by the need to restart cyclosporine 1 to 10 months following conversion. All were in the unsensitized group. Of those successfully converted, there were six allograft failures, two from patient death, one from acute rejection, one from recurrent diabetic nephropathy, and two from patient noncompliance. All were in the unsensitized group, although the difference from the sensitized group was not statistically significant (P = 0.051). There were three rejection episodes, all successfully reversed, in the sensitized group and six rejection episodes in the unsensitized group, five of which were reversed. Overall renal function improved in both groups as shown by a significant decrease in serum creatinine. Neither group required increased doses of steroid to compensate for lack of cyclosporine. From these data we can recommend conversion from cyclosporine to azathioprine in patients with cytotoxic antibodies or those undergoing retransplantation.\r"

Serial 24-hour urine collections were used to determine creatinine excretion (UcreatV) and Ccreat. Subjects were examined after ad libitum (ad lib) food intake and after 2-week periods of high protein diet ([HPD] 1.6 g/kg body weight [BW] per day) and low protein diet ([LPD] 0.5 g/kg BW per day). Inulin clearance (Cinulin) was determined at the end of each 2-week diet period. UcreatV increased from 1,838.8 +/- 97.2 mumol/kg (20.8 +/- 1.1 mg/kg) BW to 2,068.6 +/- 106.1 mumol/kg (23.4 +/- 1.2 mg/kg) BW daily during HPD and decreased significantly to 1,555.9 +/- 167.9 mumol/kg BW per day (17.6 +/- 1.9 mg/kg BW per day) with beginning of LPD.

There was no difference between Cinulin after HPD (1.42 +/- 0.12 mL/s.1.73 m2; 84.9 +/- 7.2 mL/min/1.73 m2) and after LPD (1.36 +/- 0.05 mL/s.1.73 m2; 81.4 +/- 2.9 mL/min/1.73 m2). This study confirms the effect of protein intake on Ccreat and UcreatV, but fails to show an effect of changes in chronic protein intake on glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Ccreat during dietary protein restriction to 0.5 g/kg/d is similar to Cinulin and may be a useful measure of GFR under circumstances where more specific inulin or isotope studies are not available.\r"

In the present study we sought to determine if the localization of FN-binding antigens in the mesangium is capable of inducing glomerulonephritis. A group of rats were injected IV with the FN-binding antigen phenylated gelatin (DNP-GL) followed 2 hours later by rabbit anti-DNP antibodies. This experimental protocol resulted in the development of a glomerulonephritis characterized by an initial heterologous phase and a late autologous phase. Both phases of the disease were characterized by significant histologic changes, including focal segmental mesangial matrix expansion, inflammatory cell infiltration, and an increase in endothelial and mesangial cells. By immunoperoxidase we demonstrated mesangial deposition of rabbit IgG and rat C3 during the initial heterologous phase and mesangial deposition of rat IgG and C3 during the autologous phase. Significant proteinuria developed during the heterologous phase, but not during the autologous phase of the disease. By contrast, rats injected with DNP-GL alone or anti-DNP antibodies alone did not develop significant histologic glomerular changes or proteinuria. In conclusion, antigens that bind to mesangial FN are capable of inducing glomerulonephritis. This mechanism of localization of antigens in the glomeruli may be relevant to human immune complex (IC)-mediated diseases involving antigens that have the capacity to bind to FN.\r"

We analyzed the effect of chronic administration of EPO in 13 stable, regularly dialyzed end-stage renal failure patients over an 18-month period. The effects of EPO were evaluated according to standard criteria including clinical status, blood pressure control, hematology and biochemistry data, protein nutritional status, and dialysis efficiency. Following a 2-week control period, EPO was administered intravenously (IV) after the dialysis session according to a two-phase protocol. The first period (correction phase) consisted of a stepwise EPO dose increment, starting at 3 x 24 IU/kg/wk and doubling the dose every 14 days according to hemoglobin response in order to achieve a target hemoglobin level of approximately 11.0 g/dL (110 g/L). In the second period (maintenance phase) EPO dose was optimized to maintain the hemoglobin level between 100 and 110 g/L (10.0 and 11.0 g/dL), by adjusting either the unit dose or the frequency of injection. Anemia was corrected in all patients within 11 weeks, with EPO dose increasing from 72 to 360 IU/kg/wk. The stabilization of hemoglobin was achieved with an average EPO dose of 275 IU/kg/wk (50 to 476 IU/kg/wk). Concomitantly, a subjective and clinical improvement was noted in all patients. The dialysis efficacy remained in an acceptable range throughout the study, falling significantly (approximately 10%) through the first 3 months of treatment to stabilize at an effective urea clearance of approximately 120 L/wk. The dietary protein intake calculated from urea kinetic modeling ranged between 1.1 and 1.2 g/kg/d.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Here, two types of multilocus model are described: (1) a multiplicative model, representing epistasis (interaction) among loci, and (2) an additive model, which is shown to closely approximate genetic heterogeneity, which is characterized by no interlocus interaction. A ratio lambda R of risk for type R relatives that is compared with population prevalence is defined. For a single-locus model, lambda R - 1 decreases by a factor of two with each degree of relationship. The same holds true for an additive multilocus model. For a multiplicative (epistasis) model, lambda R - 1 decreases more rapidly than by a factor of two with degree of relationship. Examination of lambda R values for various classes of relatives can potentially suggest the presence of multiple loci and epistasis. For example, data for schizophrenia suggest multiple loci in interaction. It is shown in the second paper of this series that lambda R is the critical parameter in determining power to detect linkage by using affected relative pairs.\r"

Allelic identity by descent (ibd) for a completely polymorphic marker for sibling, uncle-nephew, grandparent-grandchild, half-sib, and first-cousin pairs is considered. Affected-unaffected pairs generally represent a poor strategy. For single-locus models, ibd depends on lambda R, the risk ratio for type R relatives compared with population prevalence, and the recombination fraction theta. The ibd for grandparent-grandchild pairs is least affected by recombination, followed by sibs, half-sib, uncle-nephew, and first-cousin pairs. For diseases with large lambda values and for small theta values, distant relatives offer greater power. For larger theta values, grandparent-grandchild pairs are best; for small lambda values, sibs are best. Additive and multiplicative multilocus models are considered. For the multiplicative model, the same formulas as in the single-locus model apply, except that lambda iR (for the ith contributing locus) is substituted for lambda R. For the additive model, the deviation from null expectation for ibd is divided among all contributing loci. Compared with the multiplicative model, for an additive model there is usually greater advantage in distant relationships. Multipoint analysis using linked marker loci for affected relative pairs is described. Simultaneous use of multiple markers diminishes the effect of recombination and allows for localization of the disease-susceptibility locus.\r"

The expected MLS (EMLS) is calculated as a function of the marker polymorphic information content (PIC) for various values of lambda R (relative risk ratio) and different relative types by using simulations. An m-allele model with equal allele frequencies is employed. The EMLS is calculated for two sampling strategies: scheme 1, which uses pairs only, and scheme 2, which also includes additional informative relatives. For scheme 2, the percent of the maximum achievable EMLS (i.e., for a marker with a PIC of 1.0) is approximately equal to the marker PIC value for all relative types. For scheme 1, the EMLS is greatly diminished unless PIC is high, especially for distant relatives. For example, scheme 1 is not cost-effective for sibs unless PIC greater than .7; for second- and third-degree relatives, PIC must be greater than .85. Therefore, in general, it will be worthwhile to type additional relatives in linkage studies using affected pairs. The comparative value of sibs versus distant relatives depends on lambda R, recombination theta, and PIC. For large lambda R and PIC values, distant relatives are preferred. Alternatively, for smaller lambda R and PIC values, sibs are best.\r"

This methodology is aimed at mapping complex traits which have been observed to be familial but for which Mendelian segregation, even after allowing for partial penetrance, is not apparent.

We extend this methodology to more distant genetic relationships and examine the power of identity-by-state methods for mapping when marker information is only available on pairs of affected relatives. The power depends on the polymorphism of the marker, the probability of identity by descent at the trait locus, and the recombination fraction between the trait and the marker loci.\r"

  ".W": "Because evidence from several sources suggests the existence of a major genetic factor contributing to the risk for breast cancer, there is current interest in searching for genetic linkage between the putative cancer susceptibility gene(s) and polymorphic DNA markers. However, because of high population rates of the nongenetic form of the condition, and because of the possibility of underlying genetic heterogeneity, it is expected that the number of informative families required for detection of linkage will be greater for breast cancer than for other conditions with major genetic components. Computer simulation approaches may be useful in estimating the power of proposed linkage studies. Here we have simulated multiple genotypes for a medium-sized breast-cancer family and have analyzed the generated pedigrees with a linkage program. The effects of possible phenocopies and of genetic heterogeneity were measured by comparing the results obtained when the parameters were varied in the models. When population-based rates for sporadic cases of breast cancer were incorporated, the number of families required to detect linkage was approximately twice that expected in the absence of phenocopies. Incorrect specification of the probability of phenocopies in the analytic model did not materially alter the power of the proposed study, although significant effects on the estimated recombination fractions were noted.\r"

On the human X chromosome, several genes have been described that \"escape\" inactivation and continue to be expressed from both homologues. All such previously mapped genes are located in the distal third of the short arm of the X chromosome, giving rise to the hypothesis of a region of the chromosome that remains noninactivated during development. The A1S9T gene, an X-linked locus that complements a mouse temperature-sensitive defect in DNA synthesis, escapes inactivation and has now been localized, in human-mouse somatic cell hybrids, to the proximal short arm, in Xp11.1 to Xp11.3. Thus, A1S9T lies in a region of the chromosome that is separate from the other genes known to escape inactivation and is located between other genes known to be subject to X inactivation. This finding both rules out models based on a single chromosomal region that escapes inactivation and suggests that X inactivation proceeds by a mechanism that allows considerable autonomy between different genes or regions on the chromosome.\r"

Maximum combined lod score equals 13.25 at theta = 0. This establishes very close linkage between ALPL and HOPS and allows for the regional assignment of the HOPS gene to chromosome 1p36.1-34. Prenatal RFLP studies in an informative Mennonite family correctly predicted an unaffected fetus following chorionic villus sampling at 12 wk gestation. In addition in our Mennonite population, a nonrandom association exists between the polymorphic ALPL alleles and HOPS. These results suggest that strong linkage disequilibrium exists between HOPS and the ALPL markers. This will allow for improved carrier assignment in this high-risk population. Preliminary analysis suggests approximately 1/25 Manitoba Mennonites are HOPS carriers.\r"

  ".U": "90144739\r", 
  ".W": "The segregation of COL1A1 and COL1A2, the two genes which encode the chains of type I collagen, was analyzed in 38 dominant osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) pedigrees by using polymorphic markers within or close to the genes. This was done in order to estimate the consistency of linkage of OI genes to these two loci. None of the 38 pedigrees showed evidence of recombination between the OI gene and both collagen loci, suggesting that the frequency of unlinked loci in the population must be low. From these results, approximate 95% confidence limits for the proportion of families linked to the type I collagen genes can be set between .91 and 1.00. This is high enough to base prenatal diagnosis of dominantly inherited OI on linkage to these genes even in families which are too small for the linkage to be independently confirmed to high levels of significance. When phenotypic features were compared with the concordant collagen locus, all eight pedigrees with Sillence OI type IV segregated with COL1A2. On the other hand, Sillence OI type I segregated with both COL1A1 (17 pedigrees) and COL1A2 (7 pedigrees). The concordant locus was uncertain in the remaining six OI type I pedigrees. Of several other features, the presence or absence of presenile hearing loss was the best predictor of the mutant locus in OI type I families, with 13 of the 17 COL1A1 segregants and none of the 7 COL1A2 segregants showing this feature.\r"

We have constructed a physical map spanning 10 megabases of this region of the chromosome by means of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and analysis of somatic cell hybrids. Our data have allowed us to establish the order of chromosome 21 loci--cen-(S16,S48)-S13-S46-S4-(S52,S110)-(S1,S1 1)--and are thus of immediate relevance both to multipoint linkage analysis in families affected by AD and for moving from this linkage to the isolation of the genetic defect. We have also been able to identify several CpG-rich sequences close to the four most centromeric loci, suggesting the location of genes in this region. These probes, which are all within 1.5 megabases of one another, are currently the markers most tightly linked to the AD locus. Genes identified in this region can therefore be considered as candidates for the disease locus.\r"

  ".W": "A single nucleotide transition within exon 5 of the beta-hexosaminidase alpha chain gene was identified in a Puerto Rican patient with GM2-gangliosidosis B1 variant as the mutation responsible for the unusual enzymological characteristics of this variant (G533----A; Arg178----His) (the DN-allele). A total of seven patients with enzymological characteristics of B1 variant have since been studied. They were Puerto Rican (DN), Italian, French, Spanish, two patients of mixed ethnic origin (English/Italian/Hungarian and English/French/Azores), and a Czechoslovakian. In confirmation of our earlier finding based on screening with allele-specific probes, all patients except the one from Czechoslovakia carried the same DN-allele. A new point mutation found in this patient changed the same codon affected in the DN-allele (C532----T; Arg178----Cys). An asymptomatic Japanese individual included as a control also carried one allele with the DN-mutation. Site-directed mutagenesis and expression studies in COS I cells demonstrated that either of the two point mutations abolishes the catalytic activity of the alpha subunit. The Spanish patient was homozygous for the DN-allele, but others were all compound heterozygotes. The Puerto Rican patient was a compound heterozygote with the DN-mutation in one allele and with the four-base insertion in exon 11, one of the two mutations found in the classical Ashkenazi Jewish Tay-Sachs disease, in the other allele. Abnormalities of the other allele were not identified in all other compound heterozygous patients. In these patients, the level of mRNA derived from the other allele was variable, ranging from being undetectable to being much lower than normal. This series of studies uncovered a new B1 variant mutation, confirmed our preliminary finding that the DN-allele has a surprisingly wide geographic and ethnic distribution, and pointed out the highly complex nature of the molecular genetics of this rare disorder. They also support our working hypothesis that mutations responsible for the unique enzymological characteristics of the B1 variant should be located in or near exon 5 of the gene and that this region of the enzyme protein is critical for its catalytic function.\r"

In the majority of cases, DC is an X-linked recessive trait. However, one or more autosomal form(s) of DC may exist. Although excessive spontaneous chromatid breakage has been reported in DC, it is not a consistent cytological marker for this disorder. We examined the frequency and specificity of X-irradiation-induced G2 chromatid breakage in fibroblasts from three unrelated DC patients (two males and one female). Metaphase cells from DC patients had significantly more chromatid breaks (16-18-fold and 17-26-fold at 50 and 100 rad X-irradiation, respectively) and chromatid gaps (10-12-fold and 6-7-fold at 50 and 100 rad, respectively) than those from two different controls. Analysis of banded chromosomes revealed a nonrandom distribution of chromatid aberrations in DC but not in controls, a distribution corresponding to some of the known breakpoints for cancer-specific rearrangements, constitutive fragile sites, and/or loci for cellular proto-oncogenes. The significance of this finding for cancer predisposition in DC patients is uncertain, but the increased susceptibility of X-irradiation-induced chromatid breakage may serve as a cellular marker of diagnostic value.\r"

Unlinked Mendelizing loci that are at linkage equilibrium in subpopulations may be statistically associated, not statistically independent, in the population as a whole if there is heterogeneity in gene frequencies between subpopulations. In the populations where DNA fingerprinting is used for forensic applications, the assumption that DNA fragments occur statistically independently for different probes, different loci, or different fragment size classes lacks supporting data so far; there is some contrary evidence. Statistical association of alleles may cause estimates based on the assumption of statistical independence to understate the true matching probabilities by many orders of magnitude. The assumptions that DNA fragments occur independently and with constant frequency within a size class appear to be contradicted by the available data on the mean and variance of the number of fragments per person. The mistaken use of the geometric mean instead of the arithmetic mean to compute the probability that every DNA fragment of a randomly chosen person is present among the DNA fragments of a specimen may substantially understate the probability of a match between blots, even if other assumptions involved in the calculations are taken as correct. The conclusion is that some astronomically small probabilities of matching by chance, which have been claimed in forensic applications of DNA fingerprinting, presently lack substantial empirical and theoretical support.\r"

  ".W": "The human X and Y chromosomes pair and recombine at their distal short arms during male meiosis. Recent studies indicate that the majority of XX males arise as a result of an aberrant exchange between X and Y chromosomes such that the testis-determining factor gene (TDF) is transferred from a Y chromatid to an X chromatid. It has been shown that X-specific loci such as that coding for the red cell surface antigen, Xg, are sometimes lost from the X chromosome in this aberrant exchange. The steroid sulfatase functional gene (STS) maps to the distal short arm of the X chromosome proximal to XG. We have asked whether STS is affected in the aberrant X-Y interchange leading to XX males. DNA extracted from fibroblasts of seven XX males known to contain Y-specific sequences in their genomic DNA was tested for dosage of the STS gene by using a specific genomic probe. Densitometry of the autoradiograms showed that these XX males have two copies of the STS gene, suggesting that the breakpoint on the X chromosome in the aberrant X-Y interchange is distal to STS. To obtain more definitive evidence, cell hybrids were derived from the fusion of mouse cells, deficient in hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase, and fibroblasts of the seven XX males. The X chromosomes in these patients could be distinguished from each other when one of three X-linked restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms was used. Hybrid clones retaining a human X chromosome containing Y-specific sequences in the absence of the normal X chromosome could be identified in six of the seven cases of XX males.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Our case-control study showed that a positive family history for reported appendectomy was significantly more frequent in families of 80 consecutive patients eventually proved to have histopathologic acute appendicitis than in families of surgical controls matched for sex, age, and number of siblings. The relative risk was 10.0 (95% confidence limits 4.7-21.4). The pattern of familial aggregation was further supported by the fact that the age-standardized morbidity ratio was four times greater among family members of cases than among controls. We then applied the unified mixed model of segregation analysis, as implemented in the computer program POINTER, to a new set of 100 multigenerational pedigrees of children with histopathologically confirmed acute appendicitis that were broken down into 674 nuclear families. Age-specific morbidity risk and lifetime incidence of acute appendicitis were estimated from relatives of controls matched for age and sex to probands. Complex segregation analysis supported a polygenic or multifactorial model with a total heritability of 56%. There was no evidence to support a major gene, although a rare gene could not be ruled out as the cause of a small proportion of cases. Specific studies to address genetic and environmental factors in this serious disease seem worthwhile; but, for now, a positive family history of appendicitis might join other evidence leading to improved clinical recognition of acute appendicitis.\r"

We postulated that a simple, inexpensive bicycle exercise test could provide objective documentation of cardiopulmonary reserve and, therefore, predict perioperative pulmonary as well as cardiac complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prior to elective surgery, 177 patients aged 65 years or older had assessment of the clinical history, results of physical examination, electrocardiogram, chest radiograph, blood chemistries, pulmonary function test findings, supine exercise test results, Dripps classification, and Goldman cardiac risk factors. Observations in patients with and without major perioperative cardiac and/or pulmonary complications were compared using univariate analysis followed by a multivariate logistic regression procedure. RESULTS: Major perioperative complications were pulmonary in 24 patients, cardiac in 25 patients, and either cardiac or pulmonary in 39 patients. By multivariate analysis, inability to perform two minutes of supine bicycle exercise raising the heart rate above 99 beats/minute was the best predictor of perioperative pulmonary, cardiac, and combined cardiopulmonary complication (p less than 0.0005). Among 108 patients who were able to achieve these exercise criteria, cardiac or pulmonary complications occurred in 10 patients (9.3%), with one death (0.9%). Among 69 patients unable to exercise satisfactorily, cardiac or pulmonary complications occurred in 29 patients (42%), with five total deaths (7.2%). CONCLUSION: Objective measurement of exercise capacity by supine bicycle ergometry appears to be of clinical value for preoperative risk stratification for both pulmonary and cardiac complications prior to major elective abdominal or noncardiac thoracic surgery in elderly patients.\r"

Suggestions that the mandated protocol for withholding CPR is too cumbersome and will result in an increase in CPR attempts led us to study the effect of the new law on in-hospital resuscitation practice. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 245 adult in-patients at a county teaching hospital who died during three-month periods before and after the law took effect. RESULTS: There was a statistically nonsignificant decline in the frequency of CPR attempts at the time of death, from 59 (50%) of 119 patients in 1987 to 57 (45%) of 126 patients in 1988. Use of explicit written \"do-not-resuscitate\" (DNR) orders increased significantly from 13 (22%) of 60 patients who died without CPR in 1987 to 64 (93%) of 69 patients in 1988. Patient and family involvement in decisions to withhold CPR was common before the law and did not change significantly. CONCLUSION: Although changing the way DNR decisions are documented, the legislation resulted in no significant change either in the frequency of CPR or in the degree to which patients are involved in these decisions.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical records were obtained for all patients discharged from Yale-New Haven Hospital during 1921, 1941, 1961, and 1982 with a diagnosis of either pulmonary tuberculosis or primary lung cancer. Each patient's entire clinical course was then thoroughly reviewed, including all available data obtained in the six-month intervals before and after the patient's hospitalization. Critical diagnostic information obtained during life at any time during this one-year period was acceptable as evidence for the diagnosis. RESULTS: According to modern diagnostic criteria, the existing evidence of pulmonary tuberculosis or primary lung cancer often did not justify those diagnoses in patients hospitalized during each of the four survey years. The proportions of justified diagnoses showed a consistent increase over time: 16%, 42%, 53%, and 86%, respectively, for tuberculosis, and 0%, 54%, 93%, and 93%, respectively, for lung cancer. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that some of the statistical changes in occurrence rates for these two pulmonary diseases may be due to temporal improvements in diagnostic precision, not just to environmental changes or therapeutic advances.\r"

The purpose of this case-control study was to determine whether antibiotic prophylaxis for a dental procedure reduces the risk of infective endocarditis in persons with high-risk cardiac lesions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cases consisted of eight subjects with high-risk lesions (six mitral, one aortic, one uncorrected tetralogy) whose first-time, native-valve infective endocarditis occurred within 12 weeks of a dental procedure and was diagnosed between 1980 and 1986. For each case subject, three control subjects were chosen from patients who underwent echocardiographic evaluation between 1980 and 1986, and who were matched for the specific high-risk lesion and age. Use of antibiotic prophylaxis, which was determined by interviews with patients and supplemented by the dentists, was defined as antibiotic taken both before and after the dental procedure. RESULTS: Antibiotic prophylaxis was used by only one of eight (13%) case subjects compared with 15 of 24 (63%) control subjects, for an odds ratio of 0.09, which is clinically impressive (indicating 91% protective efficacy) and statistically significant (p = 0.025). CONCLUSION: Although this report does not specifically assess the value of antibiotic prophylaxis for the current AHA recommendations, the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in persons with high-risk cardiac lesions is supported by the magnitude of protective efficacy observed in this study.\r"

The interventions included initial and periodic in-services, posters, and placement of boxes of gloves at every patient's bedside. Two comparable wards where no special intervention was instituted served as controls. RESULTS: A decrease in the incidence of C. difficile diarrhea from 7.7 cases/1,000 patient discharges during the six months before intervention to 1.5/1,000 during the six months of intervention on the glove wards was observed (p = 0.015). No significant change in incidence was observed on the two control wards during the same period (5.7/1,000 versus 4.2/1,000). Point prevalence of asymptomatic C. difficile carriage was also reduced significantly on the glove wards but not on the control wards after the intervention period (glove wards, 10 of 37 to four of 43, p = 0.029; control wards, five of 30 to five of 49, p = 0.19). The cost of 61,500 gloves (4,505 gloves/100 patients) used was $2,768 on the glove wards, compared with $1,895 (42,100 gloves; 3,532 gloves/100 patients) on the control wards. CONCLUSIONS: Vinyl glove use was associated with a reduced incidence of C. difficile diarrhea and is indirect evidence for hand carriage as a means of nosocomial C. difficile spread.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum cobalamin levels were assayed in 43 female SLE patients by a radio-dilution assay using purified intrinsic factor. RESULTS: Cobalamin levels were found to be significantly lower in the SLE group compared with a normal control group, eight of whom (18.6%) had serum cobalamin levels equal to or lower than 180 pg/mL (mean: 129.25 +/- 40.05 pg/mL). None of the SLE patients had been found to have pernicious anemia. The transcobalamin II level and unsaturated vitamin B12 binding capacity, but not the cobalamin level, were positively correlated with SLE activity. CONCLUSION: Our results may indicate a subtle cobalamin deficiency in SLE patients without pernicious anemia.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 56 patients with DH and 26 control subjects with the HLA-B8/-DR3 haplotype. All were examined for thyroid function abnormalities and thyroid autoantibodies. RESULTS: Patients with DH had a statistically significant increase in the prevalence of abnormal thyroid function test results and autoantibodies: 32% versus 4% for controls (Z = 2.01, p less than 0.02). In patients with DH, hypothyroidism was the most common thyroid abnormality (12 of 56) followed by hyperthyroidism (four of 56). Two patients had normal thyroid function test results with thyroid autoantibodies. Risk factors for thyroid abnormalities in patients with DH were increasing age (chi 2 = 6.55, p less than 0.02, significant) and the presence of thyroid microsomal antibodies. The HLA-B8/-DR3 haplotype was not a risk factor for thyroid abnormalities. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that thyroid disease is independently associated with DH. Examination of patients with DH should include thyroid function tests along with assays for antithyroid antibodies.\r"

These diseases contributed to 4,490 deaths, corresponding to a mortality rate of 18.9 per million United States population. Aplastic anemia was the most frequent cause of death, followed by thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and hemolytic anemia. Mortality rates varied by age, with a small peak in young children, lower rates for ages five through 34 years, and exponentially increasing rates beyond 35 years of age. Although drug relatedness could not be reliably ascertained from our data, other surveys have estimated that approximately 30% of fatal blood dyscrasias are caused by therapeutic drugs. Assuming that 30% drug attribution also applies to the U.S. population as a whole, approximately 1,350 blood dyscrasia deaths in the U.S. in 1984 may have been caused by drugs.\r"

The urine fraction containing the factor must be separated from whole urine by a gel filtration column (TSK-20) for the activity to appear. The assay requires addition of an aliquot of normal serum to provide the necessary IgM to which the CF-factor binds, resulting in the lectin-like activity that causes agglutination of mouse erythrocytes. All 22 CF patients tested, who were not receiving intravenous (IV) antibiotics had positive CF-lectin urinary activity, whereas five others receiving IV aminoglycosides were negative. Four patients with a clinical diagnosis of CF, but with normal sweat tests (35-54 mEq/L), all had positive urinary CF-lectin tests. A blind study in which urine samples were shipped from Miami, FL to Sepulveda, CA was completely successful in correctly identifying 11 samples from CF patients as compared with ten from non-CF patients. It was concluded that an assay for urinary CF-lectin factor is specific and reliable for confirming a diagnosis of CF when the sweat test is indeterminate, and when patients have not received recent IV aminoglycosides.\r"

  ".W": "Studies of the pathobiologic consequences of high blood pressure in childhood, as well as those following blood pressure levels into young adulthood, indicate that early intervention in the natural history of essential hypertension is warranted. In an exploratory study of the concept, 95 children out of 1604 (aged 8 to 18 years), who persistently scored higher than the 90th percentile for blood pressure over a 4-month period, considering the race, sex, and height of the children, were studied. Five series of replicate measurements with 30 total observations were obtained. Children with evidence of secondary hypertension were excluded. The study children were randomly divided into treatment (n = 48) and high-comparison (n = 47) groups. Treatment consisted of low-dose combined drug therapy (propranolol and chlorthalidone) with an educational program directed towards hypertension and dietary and exercise modification. Monthly follow-up was continued for 30 months. Significant systolic (-3.59 mm Hg) and diastolic (-1.73 mm Hg) changes were noted up to 30 months (p less than 0.05) with minimal side effects. Furthermore, analyses suggested that the blood pressure change, at least in the first month, was mostly attributable to drug therapy. Moreover, the mechanism of blood pressure change appeared to be race-specific, with whites having pulse rate changes and blacks having significant weight changes, which were associated with blood pressure change. This trial shows further research is warranted to determine optimum approaches for early treatment of essential hypertension to prevent future hypertensive disease.\r"

After membrane lipid extraction, phospholipid mass, class composition, and fatty acid profiles were measured in each group. Although there were no differences in the total phospholipid mass, the low ethanol primates had significantly elevated phosphatidylethanolamine in their membranes as compared with the other monkeys. Membrane phospholipid fatty acid profiles showed no differences among the three groups. There were also no differences in the animals' plasma liver enzymes. Results of this investigation suggest that, despite the absence of nutritional deficiencies and liver malfunction, low amounts (12%) of dietary ethanol cause elevations in phosphatidylethanolamine that may represent a specific change in the membrane's inner leaflet where this phospholipid is located. These results may have clinical significance because ethanol-induced modifications in membrane lipids may contribute to alterations in fluidity and lead to pathologic changes in function.\r"

Identifiable benefits of the unit were as follows: (1) Intensive observation and organization allowed for prevention of early recognition and treatment of complications; (2) familiarity with invasive monitoring permitted personnel to exert prompt, rational treatment of hemodynamically unstable patients; (3) continuity of care was improved before and after delivery; (4) residents and fellows learned a great deal about intensive care and the management of rare medical complications of pregnancy.

All had completed their families and had failed to benefit from previous medical treatment. The diagnosis and severity of premenstrual syndrome were assessed by means of prospective charting and psychological evaluation. All patients had clearly cyclic symptoms and psychological scores consistent with a major disruption of their lives before surgery. Six months after surgery, premenstrual syndrome symptom charting revealed complete disappearance of a cyclic pattern with scores equivalent to those of a normal population. Psychological measures 6 months after operation showed dramatic improvement in mood, general affect, well-being, life satisfaction, and overall quality of life. Surgical therapy, involving oophorectomy, hysterectomy, and continuous estrogen replacement, is effective in relieving the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome and is indicated for a small, selected group of women.\r"

The system uses a 5 MHz Doppler transducer coupled to a 6.5 MHz imaging probe. There was a steady increase in volume flow rate in the left ascending uterine artery from a mean of 94.5 ml/min before pregnancy to a mean of 342 ml/min in late gestation (reflecting a 3.5-fold increase). With the assumption of equal flow on both uterine arteries, the fraction of the cardiac output that is distributed to these vessels was calculated to be 3.5% in early pregnancy and to reach 12% near term. The mean diameter of this vessel in the nonpregnant state was 1.6 mm, increasing to 3.7 mm toward term. The resistance to flow, expressed as the peak systolic to end-diastolic flow velocity ratio, declined from a mean of 5.3 in the nonpregnant state to a mean of 2.3 near term. These changes reflect the perpetual growth and development of the uteroplacental circulation, which provides the metabolic demands of the growing fetus throughout gestation.\r"

  ".W": "The postpartum use of plasma exchange with fresh-frozen plasma was assessed in a group of seven women with severe preeclampsia-eclampsia and HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count) that persisted greater than 72 hours after delivery. During the study interval in which a total of 107 gravid women with HELLP syndrome were seen in our referral center, these seven patients (6.5%) demonstrated persistent thrombocytopenia (platelet count usually less than 30,000/mm3), rising lactic dehydrogenase (greater than 1000 IU/L) and evidence of multiorgan dysfunction. The seven case histories emphasize the variety of clinical and laboratory profiles that can be encountered in this small group of gravid women at risk for severe morbidity or mortality. Up to three 3 L plasma exchanges were required to effect permanent disease arrest and reversal. Utilization of the IBM 2997 Cell Separator system permitted bedside performance of procedures with enhanced convenience and optimal medical management. Successful plasma exchange was associated with (1) sustained increases in the mean platelet count at 24, 48, and 72 hours that were 2.2, 3.6, and 4.5 times the preexchange platelet counts and (2) a decreasing trend in lactic dehydrogenase concentrations below 1000 IU/L within 48 hours of exchange plasmapheresis. The current series of patients supports our recommendation that a trial of plasma exchange(s) with fresh-frozen plasma be considered for treatment of the infrequent postpartum case of HELLP syndrome that fails to abate within 72 hours of delivery and in which other evidence develops of an ongoing, widespread, and life-threatening thrombotic microangiopathy.\r"

However, the latter finding was based on a small number of cases in which estrogen was used. Women who underwent estrogen replacement therapy for greater than or equal to 2 years had significantly elevated risks of endometrial cancer (2.1 for 2 to 5 years and 3.5 for greater than or equal to 6 years). An elevated risk persisted for greater than or equal to 6 years after discontinuation of therapy. Women who exclusively used conjugated equine estrogen preparations less than or equal to 0.625 mg had no increased risk of endometrial cancer. A history of oral contraceptive use appeared to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer associated with estrogen replacement therapy. However, these latter two potentially important findings were based on a small number of cases in which hormones were used.\r"

The study population includes the 1362 perinatal deaths that occurred among 85,402 live births between 1983 and 1987 at hospitals of the University of Chicago Perinatal Network. After peer review of demographic, clinical, and pathologic data, each perinatal death was classified in one of the following categories: (1) the result of congenital malformation incompatible with life, (2) unavoidable, (3) potentially avoidable by patient, by health provider, or by both, or (4) of undetermined responsibility. Of 1362 deaths, 12.3% involved congenital malformations incompatible with life, 56.9% were classified as unavoidable, 28.1% were judged potentially avoidable, and 2.7% due to undetermined causes. Of potentially avoidable deaths, 36% were due to patient factors (primarily noncompliance), 59% to health provider factors, and 15% to combined patient and provider factors. There was a significant reduction in the potentially avoidable cases during the study period. The maximum attainable reduction in perinatal mortality under optimal conditions is calculated. Intervention plans to achieve this goal are discussed.\r"

A review of asphyxiated neonates greater than or equal to 36 weeks' gestation admitted to The Children's Hospital Newborn Intensive Care Unit in 1983 was conducted to devise a scoring system that would rapidly predict organ dysfunction observed in the immediate neonatal period. Comparison of potential score components to morbidity by multiple regression analysis yielded significant association with abnormalities in fetal heart rate monitoring, the 5-minute Apgar score, and neonatal base deficit. A scoring system was devised whose sensitivity (93.8%) and specificity (81.3%) were more predictive than any of its individual components. Prospective analysis in a similar population in 1984 validated its ability to distinguish severe from moderate morbidity after asphyxia. Positive predictive value for the score in the combined study groups (n = 98) was 79% and the negative predictive value was 83%. The scoring system may offer a rapid and accurate prediction of organ dysfunction in the immediate neonatal period after asphyxia.\r"

The rate of twin gestation was twice as high in obese women as that in underweight women. The proportion of infants born with low birth weight declined as prepregnancy weight status increased. The mean prenatal weight gain of underweight women who were delivered of term twin infants with birth weights in the range of lowest perinatal mortality (3001 to 3500 gm) was 44.2 +/- 12.4 pounds. For normal-weight women, the corresponding figure was 40.9 +/- 11.3 pounds. These mean gains were significantly higher than the gains of underweight and normal-weight women who were delivered of smaller infants at term.\r"

Cervical collagenous tissue at the corresponding stages showed a marked dissociation among abundant ground substances.

The levels of concentration of this hormone in this amniotic fluid correlated significantly with the levels in both maternal plasma and placenta for each patient. Gel filtration of amniotic fluid extracts revealed two major peaks of immunoreactive corticotropin-releasing hormone, one at the elution position of the rat hormone and the other at a small-molecular-weight region. Immunoreactive corticotropin-releasing hormone was not detectable in rat amniotic fluid or placenta. We concluded that immunoreactive corticotropin-releasing hormone, which may be derived from the placenta, is present in human amniotic fluid and that its detection in the human placenta but not in rat placentas suggests that the mechanism of corticotropin-releasing hormone gene expression in the placenta is species specific.\r"

In a univariate analysis, intrauterine growth retardation occurred more frequently in women who were black, single, primiparous, less than 17 or greater than 30 years old, short, thin, had a previous preterm delivery, consumed alcohol, took drugs, or gained limited weight. Preterm delivery occurred significantly more frequently in women who were black, single, thin, less than 17 or greater than 30 years old, had less than a twelfth grade education, or gained limited weight. In logistic regression analyses, race, parity, maternal age, a history of preterm delivery, smoking, short stature, low weight, and low weight gain remained significant risk factors of intrauterine growth retardation. Of these factors, smoking, short stature, low weight, and low weight gain showed the greatest correlation. Factors significantly related to preterm delivery included black race, single marital status, younger or older ages, previous preterm delivery, smoking, low weight, and very low or high weight gain. A previous preterm delivery and very low maternal weight had the greatest correlation. Identification of specific risk factors of both intrauterine growth retardation and preterm delivery should aid in the development of strategies to reduce the prevalence of these conditions.\r"

The study was performed in the third trimester and each subject evaluated had sonographic evidence of fetal growth retardation without other obvious abnormalities. Decreased maternal 2,3-diphosphoglycerate/hemoglobin molar ratio and hemoglobin oxygen affinity were related linearly to the birth weight normalized for the expected sea level values of gestational age expressed as a birth weight (gestational age-normalized) Z score. The correlation coefficients and p values were r = 0.71, p less than 0.001 and r = 0.67, p less than 0.001, respectively. The ponderal index-normalized Z score correlated with the 2,3-diphosphoglycerate/hemoglobin molar ratio (r = 0.46, p less than 0.04), but the relation was not as strong as the birth weight-normalized Z score. The crown-heel length/head circumference ratio did not correlate with the 2,3-diphosphoglycerate/hemoglobin molar ratio (r = 0.29, NS). The birth weight (gestational age)-normalized Z score did not correlate with hemoglobin, PCO2, or pH. In the regulation of hemoglobin oxygen affinity, calculations indicated that the 2,3-diphosphoglycerate/hemoglobin molar ratio played a highly significant role (p less than 0.001), pH was minimally significant (p less than 0.025), but PCO2 had little or no significant effects in this study. It appears that fetal growth is related to the maternal red blood cell oxygen transport parameters 2,3-diphosphoglycerate/hemoglobin molar ratio and hemoglobin oxygen affinity. Moreover, the 2,3-diphosphoglycerate/hemoglobin molar ratio is the principal regulator of hemoglobin oxygen affinity.\r"

Their birth weights were compared with the birth weight distribution expected for a population of the same race, gestation, sex, maternal height, and parity, born in the same geographic area, and during the same time period. Birth weights of children with spastic cerebral palsy tended to be significantly lower than the median birth weight of their comparison population. Analysis stratified by gestation at delivery suggested that if the reduced birth weight were causally associated with the spastic cerebral palsy, 22% of cases were attributable to being below the 10th percentile of the comparison population birth weight distribution. The risk of spastic cerebral palsy associated with poor intrauterine growth was dependent on gestation at delivery; poorly grown infants delivered between 34 and 37 weeks' gestation were at highest risk. Some probable pathways by which growth retardation could result in brain damage (intrapartum hypoxia, hypoglycemia, and hypothermia) were investigated. Only intrapartum hypoxia may have played a causal role but probably accounted for less than 2% of all cases. These data suggest that spastic cerebral palsy is associated with poor intrauterine growth in infants of more than 33 weeks' gestation, but no important causal mechanism has yet been identified.\r"

In normal fetuses total molar amino acid concentrations and fetal/maternal total molar concentration ratios did not change significantly between the second and third trimesters. Fetal and maternal concentrations of most amino acids were significantly correlated at both midgestation and late gestation. Small-for-gestational-age fetuses had significantly lower concentrations of total alpha-aminonitrogen; this was mainly because of a reduction of the branched chain amino acids valine, leucine, and isoleucine, and of lysine and serine. Maternal arterial concentrations of phenylalanine, arginine, histidine, and alanine were elevated in small-for-gestational-age pregnancies. Thus there are only minor changes in amino acid concentrations between midgestation and late gestation in normal fetuses with a constant fetal/maternal ratio. In small-for-gestational-age infants a significant reduction in alpha-aminonitrogen and in most essential amino acids was demonstrable in utero weeks before delivery.\r"

In five pregnant ewes, hypoxemia was created during 1 hour followed by fetal infusion of lactic acid during 2 hours. A micromanometer catheter positioned above the fetal aortic valve, an endocavitary phonocardiogram, and a fetal electrocardiogram allowed measurements of the two components of the preejection period--the isometric contraction time and the electromechanical delay. At the onset of hypoxemia, because of changes in isometric contraction time, the preejection period began to shorten. When acidemia was induced, the preejection period modified slowly in the opposite direction and lengthened, initially because of a prolongation of electromechanical delay and later because of an increase in the already shortened isometric contraction time. This process developed slowly and at the end of 2 hours of acidemia, preejection period were back to preexperimental values. It can be concluded that systolic time intervals can be normal and misleading when acidosis complicates hypoxemia.\r"

This increase, which occurs primarily in the alveoli, may be hastened by corticosteroids. However, because the lung is composed of more than 40 cell types, we asked whether the normal distribution of beta-adrenergic receptors changes with gestational age in a way that seems physiologically relevant. We compared lungs from fetal rabbits at 26 and 31 days' gestation with lungs from adult rabbits by autoradiography with 125iodocyanopindolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist. While the total silver grain concentration increased during gestation, the greatest proportional increase occurred in the alveoli. We conclude that pulmonary beta-adrenergic receptor concentration increases during gestation and that this increase is most dramatic for alveoli. This pattern is consistent with that previously observed after treatment of fetal rabbits in utero with corticosteroids.\r"

Inhibin contains two subunits, labeled alpha-subunit and beta-subunit. Here we report for the first time the detection of human inhibin alpha-subunit gene expression in preovulatory granulosa-theca cells by Northern analysis. The transcript is the same size as previously reported for human placenta and corpus luteum, suggesting that the same gene is being expressed in all three tissues. These findings are consistent with previously reported Southern analysis of deoxyribonucleic acid, which showed only one copy of the alpha-inhibin gene in the human genome. Thus current data strongly suggest that there is only one copy of the inhibin alpha-subunit gene in the human genome, and this same gene is expressed in granulosa-theca cells, corpus luteum, and placenta.\r"

Temperature difference in rapid-eye-movement sleep was lower than in non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (p = 0.014), reflecting convective heat loss from increased blood flow. Temperature difference also varied significantly with the locus of placement in the brain (p = 0.003), reflecting, in part, regional differences in cerebral blood flow. The thermocouple method gives qualitative, continuous information on local cerebral blood flow that could be useful in monitoring the vascular response to changing functional activity during prenatal brain development.\r"

Measurements were made of sound pressures outside and inside the ewe, and sound attenuation through maternal tissues and fluids was calculated. Sound pressures generated by low frequencies (less than 0.25 kHz) were 2 to 5 dB greater inside than outside the ewe. Above 0.25 kHz, sound attenuation increased at a rate of 6 dB per octave. For 4.0 kHz, sound attenuation averaged 20 dB. The sound pressure recorded at different locations within the amnion with respect to the sound source varied by up to 6 dB. The internal noise floor in the absence of externally generated sounds was as low as 50 dB (spectrum level) above 0.2 kHz. Thus the fetus is developing in an environment that is rich with internal and external sounds.\r"

Postnatally, the presence of pulmonary hypoplasia was associated with the severity of skeletal compression deformities (p less than 0.0001). The development of skeletal compression deformities was associated with severe oligohydramnios (p = 0.05) and duration of rupture of the membranes (p = 0.02) but not gestational age at rupture of the membranes (p = 0.77).

In a multiple logistic regression model adjusting for race, parity, marital status, maternal weight, weight gain, and alcohol use, smoking was associated with a fivefold increased risk of growth retardation in women older than 35 but less than a twofold increased risk in women younger than 17. Smoking reduced birth weight by 134 gm in young women but 301 gm in women older than 35.

Significant increases in cervical dilatation were observed at 48 hours with all doses of Mifepristone above 50 mg. The increases were significantly greater in patients with a gestational age greater than 10 weeks than in those less than 10 weeks' gestational age. Parity had no influence on cervical dilatation at 48 hours. Bleeding was observed significantly more often with 100 to 600 mg doses of Mifepristone than with 0 to 50 mg. No influence of gestational age or parity on bleeding could be detected. Abdominal cramps were reported more frequently with 200, 400, and 600 mg of Mifepristone at 48 hours and their occurrence appeared to parallel cervical dilatation.\r"

In the simulated luteal phases, replaced with estradiol valerate and progesterone, pregnancies could be established and maintained as indicated by the profile of serum human chorionic gonadotropin concentrations. Weekly determinations of serum 17 beta-estradiol levels indicated significantly higher values at 7 weeks' gestation, as compared with week 5. This observation precludes that the luteoplacental shift occurred before 7 weeks' gestation. The weekly serum determinations of progesterone were significantly higher week 9, as compared with week 5. Two pregnancies were achieved after the vaginal administration of micronized progesterone.\r"

  ".W": "Sixty-nine female patients with symptoms of stress urinary incontinence were randomized to treatment with either interferential therapy or weighted vaginal cones. Fifty-four patients completed treatment (interferential therapy, 30 patients; weighted vaginal cones, 24 patients). Patients were assessed by subjective response, pad testing, continence charts, and the maximum weight of cone that could be held actively and passively. Forty-seven patients were reassessed at 6 months (19 cones; 28 interferential), five patients (9.26%) required surgery, and two patients (3.7%) could not be reassessed. Subjective response to treatment was good, with 80% to 90% of patients cured or improved after treatment. After 6 months, 41.67% in the cone group and 40% in the interferential group were subjectively cured, with improvement in 50% and 30%, respectively. Of those patients initially referred for treatment, greater than 30% in each group were cured of symptoms. There was an objective improvement in both groups. In the cone group 50% had improved after treatment and greater than 60% had improved at 6 months as assessed by pad testing, while in the interferential group 76% had improved after treatment and 73% had improved at 6 months. There was no significant difference in improvement between the two groups in any of the methods of assessment. However, the cones require less supervision by trained staff and can be used at home by the patient. Their use results in a savings in time for the physiotherapy department. The use of the cones is recommended as a cost-effective method of treatment that can be added to the present therapy options available to the physiotherapist.\r"

In each case medical ovarian suppression resulted in complete relief from symptoms. For ongoing symptom relief, each woman elected to undergo bilateral ovariectomy and concomitant hysterectomy. Both medical ovarian suppression and ovariectomy with low-dose conjugated estrogen therapy afforded lasting relief from cyclic symptoms of premenstrual syndrome and a corresponding improvement in overall quality of life. We conclude that cyclic ovarian steroidogenesis is a powerful determinant for the expression of premenstrual symptomatology. Ovariectomy with low-dose estrogen replacement is an effective alternative for the woman with debilitating premenstrual syndrome who does not respond to conventional interventions.\r"

Mean survival time of the grafts in the collagen shield treated eyes was significantly longer than in the eyes treated with drops. In the eyes treated at the first sign of graft reaction, cyclosporine in collagen shields halted the rejection process; seven of these eyes survived the 120-day observation period, compared to one of the eyes treated with drops. These results indicate that the collagen shield is an effective delivery system for cyclosporine and the topically administered cyclosporine is effective in suppressing the initiation of graft rejection and in reversing a graft reaction in progress.\r"

The severity of conjunctival disease was associated with increased zeta sedimentation ratios (a measure of red cell aggregation) and fibrinogen levels. The presence of cotton-wool spots was also associated with higher fibrinogen levels. Plasma viscosity and quantitative IgG levels were above normal levels in most patients, although a relationship to disease severity was not established.

Each graft showed a unique, moderately irregular pattern of power distribution. Fair correlation was seen between the expected corneal power and that shown in the power map displays. These data suggest that moderate degrees of irregular astigmatism are compatible with good Snellen visual acuity after epikeratophakia for aphakia, though the effect of this irregularity on visual performance remains unclear.\r"

During the period of observation, five of 12 eyes had an episode of uveitis, but in no patient did this result in loss of intraocular pressure control.

Timolol pretreatment prevented the facility-increasing effect of both topical epinephrine and intracameral norepinephrine, but betaxolol pretreatment prevented neither. These findings indicate that no cumulative facility-increasing effect of epinephrine, beyond the acute (three hour) facility-increasing effect, develops within three days; there may be a facility-decreasing effect of large topical epinephrine doses on the vascular structures external to the trabecular meshwork; there is no, or only subthreshold, facility-affecting ambient beta-adrenergic tone in the meshwork; and the facility-increasing effect of both epinephrine and norepinephrine is mediated by beta 2-adrenergic receptors in the trabecular endothelium.\r"

The degree of myopia correlated with the age of onset and duration of media opacification. In the child without myopia, the hemorrhage did not obscure the posterior pole. None of the four children whose hemorrhage occurred after 2 1/2 years of age showed myopic anisometropia (mean, +0.16 diopters; S.D., 0.24).

We analyzed fluorescein angiography transit photographs in 100 eyes of 100 consecutive patients with age-related changes at the level of Bruch's membrane. Of these, 26 eyes had evidence of a prolonged choroidal filling phase during the initial dye transit. We suggest that this may represent a clinical correlate of diffuse thickening of Bruch's membrane, and that the two features are causally related.\r"

Clinical experience with these instruments in more than 20 cases of advanced proliferative vitreoretinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, and diabetic retinopathy indicates that these instruments facilitate delicate vitreoretinal dissections, particularly in the vitreous base and when fibrovascular tissues are closely adherent to the retina. Because of their smaller size, the microinstruments are more precise in their cutting capabilities than other instruments.\r"

These findings indicate an urgent need to systematically assess the beneficial and detrimental effects of these practices on China's health care system.\r"

  ".W": "Normal-weight bulimic patients have disturbed appetite, mood, and neuroendocrine function and often respond to antidepressants. Since these findings suggest abnormalities in brain monoaminergic pathways, the authors measured CSF monoamine concentrations in 27 normal-weight bulimic patients and 14 volunteers. Bulimic patients had a significantly lower mean CSF norepinephrine concentration. Levels of CSF 5-HIAA, the major serotonin metabolite, and CSF HVA, the major dopamine metabolite, were normal, although more frequent binge-eating in bulimic subjects was associated with a significantly lower CSF HVA level. Whether trait- or state-related, monoaminergic disturbances are part of this disorder's neurobiological syndrome. The lower CSF norepinephrine concentration suggests bulimia is not simply a variant of affective disorders.\r"

During the follicular and late luteal phases of the menstrual cycle, subjects completed a schedule of life events that monitors an individual's perception of 1) the frequency of occurrence of life events and 2) the degree of associated distress or pleasure. The patient group reported significantly more negative life events than the control group. Further, the patients with menstrual-related mood disorder showed significantly more distress associated with the same event when it occurred in the premenstrual phase than when it occurred in the post-menstrual phase.\r"
