The tumor type with the next highest frequency, 8%, was diffuse large cell lymphoma. The presence of EBV DNA in some HD biopsies suggests that EBV may be a factor in the pathogenesis of this disease. Alternatively, its presence may be secondary to the immune deficiency characteristic of HD. The clonal B-lymphocyte expansions reported in some cases of HD may result from EBV infection.\r"

The median percentage of the CIg(+) cells in S-phase was 2% compared with 5% for the CIg(-) cells. The median survival of patients with more than 2%, and those with 2% or less CIg(+) S-phase cells was 2 months and more than 13 months, respectively, from the time of study. Ploidy analysis identified four patterns of plasma cell DNA content: entirely hyperdiploid, entirely diploid, combined diploid and tetraploid stemlines, and tumors containing diploid and aneuploid CIg(+) cells. A monotypic CIg(+) double stemline myeloma was distinguished from two aneuploid tumors containing admixed normal, diploid polyclonal plasma cells. This technique provides an improved and expedient means for determining the proliferating fractions of myeloma cells and enhances recognition of double stemline tumors and clonal evolution in myeloma.\r"

The cases were retrospectively analyzed to evaluate the frequency of occurrence of various features that could either be helpful or misleading in the diagnosis. These features included peripheral palisading, Bowenoid nuclei, and keratinized cells. Results from the study include the fact that a major criterion for the histologic diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma (peripheral palisading) could seldom be appreciated in the cytology preparations. Large clusters of cells with crowded nuclei were found in every case and thus represent a useful cytologic parameter. However, because of the frequent absence of peripheral palisading, the study suggests there could be diagnostic confusion with lesions of small cell squamous carcinoma.\r"

Although the test is now usually performed with one of several commercially available disposable devices, most previous studies of the bleeding time have evaluated only the original template device described nearly 20 years ago. Therefore, we compared two commonly used bleeding time devices (Surgicutt and Simplate) with regard to multiple variables affecting the test in 40 hematologically normal young adults. Bleeding time was performed by the modified Ivy method according to the manufacturers' instructions in both horizontal (transverse) and vertical directions, before and two hours after a test dose of 650 mg of aspirin was administered. With both horizontal and vertical incisions, Simplate bleeding time values were greater than with the Surgicutt device (P = 0.0025). Bleeding time in the horizontal direction was greater than vertical with both devices (P = 0.0001). Values in males and females were not significantly different. Aspirin sensitivity, the difference between preaspirin and postaspirin values, was greatest with the use of the Surgicutt device in the horizontal position (mean postaspirin value 8.0 minutes). Both devices produced a reproducible uniform incision, caused minimal discomfort, and resulted in little or no scarring. The authors conclude that the results with Surgicutt and Simplate devices were comparable in many respects but that a horizontal Surgicutt bleeding time might be most sensitive in detecting disorders of primary hemostasis. Comparative studies of different bleeding time devices in normal subjects are necessary in order to accurately assess their clinical utility.\r"

However, they have generally been likened to jejunoileal carcinoids because of their considerable metastatic potential. Because of the paucity of documented cases, Meckelian carcinoids, unlike their counterparts in other topographic regions of the gastrointestinal tract, have hitherto not been systematically investigated with the use of immunohistochemical techniques. In this study, the immunophenotype of four Meckelian carcinoids was determined and comparatively evaluated against that of the corresponding mucosal epithelial endocrine cells. The results show that the immunohistochemical profile of Meckelian carcinoids is more akin to that of jejunoileal rather than that of appendiceal carcinoids. Despite the lymph node metastasis in one case, there were no complications attributable to any of the carcinoid tumors after a mean follow-up period of 10.2 years; this favorable prognosis is reminiscent of appendiceal carcinoids.\r"

All sputum samples from September 1973 to July 1975 showing atypia were randomized and negative controls added. The Saccomanno and fresh smears were evaluated independently and blindly and classified as negative, atypical, suspicious, or cancer. When each preparation was compared with the original diagnosis, the diagnostic accuracy for 55 squamous carcinomas was similar (fresh 95%, Saccomanno 86%) but significantly less in the Saccomanno preparations of 22 small cell carcinomas (fresh 100%, Saccomanno 24%) and 26 adenocarcinomas (fresh 96%, Saccomanno 52%). Four cases negative on fresh smears were suspicious or diagnostic of cancer on the Saccomanno slides. There were no cases of small cell carcinoma in which the Saccomanno preparations added information not available on the fresh smears. The authors conclude that in conjunction with fresh smears, the Saccomanno preparation may contribute to the diagnosis of non-small cell carcinomas but does not appear to aid in the diagnosis of small cell carcinoma.\r"

Three patients from the authors' files are found with myelofibrosis and bone marrow lymphocytosis after treatment for HD. Although somewhat unusual, the clinical impression initially was, in each case, isolated recurrence of HD involving the bone marrow, 6 to 11 years after initial diagnosis. In each case, after single or multiple marrow aspirates and biopsies were done, the differential between HD involving the marrow and myelodysplasia with myelofibrosis and lymphocytic infiltrates was made. The absence of diagnostic Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells was useful in diagnosing the latter. All three patients died of causes related to cytopenias, with two having progressed to overt acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. Myelofibrosis with lymphocytic infiltrates in the marrow, without diagnostic RS cells, in patients' status after treatment for HD, should alert one to the possibility of myelodysplasia.\r"

Compared with the normals, values for Vn, Sn, VVn and number of profiles per section were 16-20% smaller in the Hodgkin's monocytes and 19-32% smaller in those of the patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

In the Transfusion Safety Study, indistinguishable aliquots of four quality control (QC) samples have been routinely submitted for IB with each group of patient specimens. A false negative IB result was obtained for 1.7% of 179 assays of two known positive (QC) standards and a false positive result for 2.0% of 101 assays of two known negative (QC) standards. In addition, a test panel of 24 samples was sent on a single occasion to three widely used laboratories. A false positive result was reported by one laboratory and a false negative by a second. Although generally reliable, IB results may occasionally be in error. There is much more technical variability in the relative frequencies of antigen-antibody bands than has been recognized. These interlaboratory and intralaboratory comparisons show quality control checks are essential for all laboratories, and more than one specimen should be tested if its applicability to a specific patient is questionable. Specific bands are sufficiently inconstant for the same specimen to make appearance or disappearance on successive specimens prognostically unreliable.\r"

The authors assessed the diagnostic yield of a single determination of AST, LD, and three LD isoenzymes tests: LD-1 greater than LD-2; LD-1 greater than 90 U/L; LD-1/LD greater than 0.4. They also assessed the diagnostic accuracy of combined determination of AST with LD and AST with each of the above three LD isoenzymes tests. The efficiency of single determination of AST was better than that of LD (88% vs. 80%, 48 hours after admission). The most efficient single test for diagnosing AMI was the LD-1 greater than 90 U/L test (92%, 48 hours after admission). The efficiency of the combined AST/LD test was better than that of a single determination of each of the two enzymes (90% vs. 88% and 80%, 48 hours after admission). The highest efficiency was achieved, however, with combined determination of AST and any of the three LD isoenzymes tests. It was found to be more efficient than single determination of each of the LD isoenzymes tests (95.5-96% vs. 89-92.5%) and more efficient than the combined determination of the AST/LD test (95.5-96% vs. 89-90%). The authors conclude that AST should be determined in every patient with suspected AMI because its determination may contribute to the diagnostic yield of LD isoenzymes tests, especially in patients with AMI admitted 48-72 hours after onset of symptoms, when creatine kinase declined to near normal values.\r"

A review of all deaths in children with pacemakers in the last ten years also shows the high association of respiratory failure in patients with congenital heart disease and a pacemaker, underscoring this need. Various non-ECG monitoring modalities are discussed. Finally, analysis of the ECG monitor characteristics contributing to inappropriate sensing of the pacemaker stimulus was performed, showing the direct relation between the pacemaker stimulus amplitude seen by the monitor and the monitor sensitivity with inappropriate sensing, and the inverse relation between the monitor bandwidth and inappropriate sensing. Recommendations for monitor adjustment when monitoring patients with pacemakers are provided.\r"

One hundred fifty-nine infants were affected. The sex distribution was approximately equal. Fourteen infants (8.8%) were twins who were discordant for SUA. The smallest twin was the one affected in all but two cases. Of the 159 infants, 16 were stillborn and 19 died neonatally. The mean birth weight of all infants with SUA was 2.47 kg, and the mean gestational age was 35.9 weeks. Young primipara and older multipara mothers were more commonly affected. There was an increased incidence of SUA associated with maternal diabetes, epilepsy, toxemia, antepartum hemorrhage, hydramnios, and oligohydramnios. Twenty-six (16.4%) of the associated placentas had anomalies. Seventy-one infants (44.7%) had other congenital malformations. The presence of these malformations was associated with increased mortality. Screening for renal anomalies with ultrasonography or intravenous pyelography was performed in 27 patients and yielded positive results in five (18.5%). We recommend that renal ultrasonography be performed on all infants with SUA.\r"

We undertook a cross-sectional survey of students in ten public elementary schools in Tucson over a two-year period in an attempt to answer these questions. The sample included 503 fifth-grade students, 137 in self-care and 366 not in self-care. Demographic information and data on school absences were obtained from school records. Physical examinations were performed at school. Obesity was assessed using the body mass index calculation, in which body mass index = (body weight in kilograms)/(height in meters). Every visit to the school health office during the 1985-1986 and 1986-1987 school years was recorded for each child. There were no differences in age between those in the self-care and adult-care groups. Boys were more likely to be in self-care, as were non-Hispanic children. There were no differences in weight, body mass index, school days missed, or visits to the school health office between children in self-care and those in adult care. Our findings suggest that, by the criteria used in this study, 11-year-old children in self-care do not suffer more ill health than their counterparts in adult care.\r"

  ".W": "A brief course of testosterone injections is known to be an effective treatment for boys with constitutional delayed puberty. In this study, data from seven boys at least 14 years old who received testosterone enanthate (100 mg intramuscularly monthly for four months) were analyzed to see if linear and testicular growth responses could be useful diagnostically in excluding growth hormone deficiency (GHD) and isolated gonadotropin deficiency, two conditions that are often difficult to distinguish from constitutional delayed puberty. During four months of testosterone therapy, growth rate increased from 4.0 +/- 1.0 cm/y to 10.7 +/- 2.3 cm/y, and was greater than 8 cm/y in all patients. Since testosterone-induced stimulation of linear growth is largely GH-mediated, the large increase in growth rate in all boys is considered indicative of GH sufficiency. Testis length, which did not increase during testosterone therapy, increased by 0.6 to 0.8 cm in every patient (from 2.7 +/- 0.3 cm to 3.4 +/- 0.4 cm) over the following four months, indicating normal gonadotropin secretion and normal pubertal progression; in contrast, the increase in serum testosterone concentrations after discontinuation of testosterone treatment was more variable. It is concluded that the growth response to a four-month course of testosterone is helpful in excluding GHD in boys with delayed puberty, and an additional four months of follow-up is sufficient to document the onset of puberty, thereby eliminating the possibility of isolated gonadotropin deficiency.\r"

The fate of these induced antibodies over time is less well understood. We studied the antibody kinetics of beta-Capsa 1, a Haemophilus B polysaccharide vaccine, in 185 children aged 17 to 71 months. Ninety percent of the children vaccinated at age 2 years or older achieved reportedly immune serum antibody levels three weeks after vaccination; 45% vaccinated at age 18 months achieved such levels. In six months, the antibody levels fell significantly in all children. In those vaccinated at age 18 months, the levels six months after vaccination were not significantly different from those prior to vaccination. Our study raises the possibility that antibody kinetics may be as critical a consideration as immediate antibody response in deciding the proper clinical use of a polysaccharide-based vaccine.\r"

Sites of MRSA isolation were the respiratory tract (33%); nasopharynx (12%); gastrointestinal tract (12%); eye (8%); blood (6%); and catheter tips, wounds, or umbilicus (29%). Very low birth weight was a significant risk factor for MRSA acquisition. All isolates had the same phage type (47/54/75/83A), antibiogram, and whole-cell protein profile. Agarose gel electrophoresis of all 49 isolates disclosed a plasmid level of approximately 45 X 106 daltons (45 megadaltons) in ten different isolates and no plasmid DNA in 39 isolates. Cultures of NICU personnel failed to disclose MRSA carriers and environmental cultures for MRSA were negative. Ten selected isolates showed lower minimal bactericidal concentrations for hexachlorophene than for chlorhexidine. Standard infection-control measures such as contact isolation, hand washing with chlorhexidine, and cohorting (when possible) failed to contain the epidemic. Ultimately, eradication of MRSA from the NICU was associated with the institution of hexachlorophene hand washing.\r"

The mean compliance rate in the study group was 67%. Home pill counts were highly correlated with the other methods of measuring compliance, ie, change in serum ferritin level and urinary assay for tracer riboflavin. Statistically significant predictors of compliance included adverse side effects, initial estimate by the adolescent as to his probable level of compliance, and frequency of family reminders to take the medication. There was no significant correlation between self-esteem, locus of control, or most variables of the Health Belief Model and the level of patient compliance. Our findings suggest that home pill counts are an accurate method of assessing compliance and that instituting family reminders may be helpful in those adolescents who are potentially non-compliant.\r"

The most frequent cause of injury was oral contact with electrical cords or cord sockets, or contact with wall sockets either directly or via conductive foreign objects such as keys or pins. Data reported to the Consumer Product Safety Commission were also analyzed and corroborated our findings. We suggest a series of prevention strategies based on these data. A new wall outlet cover design is described.\r"

Growth was assessed at birth, term, and 8 and 20 months' corrected age and results of a Bayley Mental Developmental Index (MDI) and neurologic examination were evaluated at 20 months of age. Both groups had similar 20-month MDI scores (93 vs 90) and similar rates of neurologic impairment (14% vs 10%). More SGA infants (25%) than AGA infants (14%) had a subnormal head circumference at 8 months' corrected age, indicating failure to catch up in head growth. Subnormal head size at 8 months predicted the 20-month MDI score for both groups. However, multivariate analysis indicated that, whereas subnormal 8-month head size was directly associated with the MDI score in AGA children, in SGA children 8-month head size was not significantly related to the MDI score when neonatal illness, neurologic impairment, socioeconomic status, and race were controlled for. We conclude that in AGA VLBW infants, subnormal head size at 8 months results from major neonatal illness and has adverse later effects. In SGA infants, subnormal head size at 8 months has many causes, including growth retardation in utero, which may not have an adverse effect on outcome; if subnormal head size is superimposed with neonatal illness, a poorer outcome is likely.\r"

The focus of this study was on the relationship between sexual experience and self-esteem. Fifty-five percent of the students reported having had at least one coital experience; 7% reported having intercourse about once a week. The proportion of sexually experienced adolescents increased with age; 28% of 12-year-olds, 52.7% of 13-year-olds, 60.1% of 14-year-olds, 73.6% of 15-year-olds, and 90% of 16-year-olds reported having intercourse on at least one occasion. More boys of all ages were sexually active than girls. Six percent of students had had, or were suspicious of having had, a sexually transmitted disease; 7.8% were involved in a pregnancy. The average of the self-esteem scores for girls was significantly lower than the average for boys. There was an interaction effect between gender and coital history for self-esteem. Girls who reported having had intercourse had lower self-esteem scores than those who did not. On the other hand, self-esteem of sexually experienced and inexperienced boys did not differ, nor did self-esteem of virginal boys and girls. Boys and girls with a history of sexually transmitted diseases had lower self-esteem than all others. Pregnancy, on the other hand, did not seem to affect self-esteem of the sexually experienced adolescents. This cross-sectional study does not permit determination of whether the lower average self-esteem among certain girls was antecedent to or a consequence of sexual experience.\r"

A total of 1091 infants (54.6%) were discharged within 24 to 36 hours of birth, with documentation of outpatient follow-up in 994 (91.1%). Twenty-five (2.3%) of the early discharges required readmission within seven days of initial discharge compared with a 0.89% incidence among infants hospitalized greater than 48 hours. Twenty-four of the 25 readmissions did have outpatient follow-up, and no serious complications occurred. The data demonstrate that moderately early neonatal discharge can be safely accomplished in an indigent population with the aid of a successful outpatient follow-up program.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: High-dose (500 mg orally four times daily) vancomycin is considered by many investigators to be the most effective treatment for antibiotic-associated Clostridium difficile colitis. However, a lower dosage of 125 or 150 mg given three or four times a day has become popular, has been shown to be effective, and is less expensive than the high-dose regimen. We therefore decided to compare two vancomycin dosage regimens in a randomized trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study involved 46 hospitalized patients with serious underlying diseases complicated by C. difficile diarrhea or colitis. Patients were assigned (according to a table of random numbers) to treatment with either 125 or 500 mg of vancomycin orally four times daily for an average of 10 days. RESULTS: No significant differences in measurable responses to the two regimens were noted. There were no treatment failures. The mean duration of diarrhea after initiation of therapy was about four days, and almost all patients had no diarrhea after one week. The organism continued to be demonstrated in the stools of about 50 percent of patients for the first few weeks after completion of therapy, and nine (20 percent) patients developed a recurrence of their diarrheal illness. Vancomycin was well tolerated by all patients. CONCLUSION: Since the dose of 125 mg appeared to be as effective as the 500-mg dose, which is more expensive, the 125-mg dose is preferred when vancomycin is used in treatment of this disease, unless the patient is critically ill.\r"

Since patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) often experience progressive tissue wasting, we decided to examine serum lipid levels and body cell mass in patients with AIDS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum lipid levels and body cell mass were measured in 32 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), eight asymptomatic subjects who were anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody positive, and 17 heterosexual and homosexual control subjects who did not have antibodies to HIV. RESULTS: Mean triglyceride concentrations and the prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia (50 percent) were significantly increased in patients with AIDS compared with control subjects (p less than 0.002 and p less than 0.005, respectively), whereas the mean triglyceride levels of HIV-positive subjects were intermediate. There were no differences in cholesterol levels among the three groups. Using total body potassium adjusted for height and age (KHT) as a measure of body cell mass, 16 of 32 patients with AIDS but none of the HIV-positive or control subjects had significant depletion of body cell mass. There was no direct relationship between triglyceride levels and KHT among AIDS or HIV-positive subjects. In patients with AIDS, mean triglyceride levels and the prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia were similar in the presence and absence of wasting. CONCLUSION: Hypertriglyceridemia is a common finding in AIDS and is independent of the degree of wasting.\r"

Our aim was to determine prospectively the incidence of esophageal disorders and abnormal responses to edrophonium chloride and esophageal acid infusions in patients with MVP and troublesome non-ischemic chest pain. PATIENTS AND METHODS: After coronary artery disease was excluded, 20 patients with MVP and chest pain underwent esophageal manometry and provocative testing with edrophonium chloride and acid infusion. Seven patients with MVP but without chest pain served as control subjects; they also underwent esophageal manometry with provocative testing. RESULTS: Esophageal manometry revealed esophageal disorders in 16 patients: diffuse esophageal spasm in 14 patients, nutcracker esophagus in one, and hypotensive lower esophageal sphincter in one. Esophageal motility was normal in four patients. Injection of edrophonium and acid infusion tests evoked typical chest discomfort in three of 18 and five of 19 patients, respectively. In six of seven control subjects with MVP but with no chest discomfort, esophageal motility was normal and provocative testing did not produce chest discomfort (p less than 0.05 versus results in patients). CONCLUSION: Esophageal disorders were common and may account for chest discomfort in certain patients with MVP and persistent chest pain syndromes.\r"

We therefore performed further studies to determine whether increased cortisol binding is generally associated with CAH. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum samples were obtained from 15 hospitalized patients with long-term liver function test elevations but no evidence of cirrhosis, 15 normal subjects without a history of hepatitis, four healthy pregnant women, and 10 alcoholic patients with stigmata of cirrhosis. Serum cortisol binding was measured by an adaptation of a previously described charcoal uptake method. Thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) and sex hormone-binding globulin were determined by radioimmunoassays. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Charcoal uptake of 125I cortisol from sera of normal subjects and additional patients with CAH revealed that increased serum cortisol binding by a saturable site, presumably CBG, was associated with CAH. Cortisol binding was significantly correlated with immunoassayable TBG, suggesting that in CAH, similar mechanisms may be responsible for increasing the serum concentrations of CBG and TBG.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Amiodarone has proven to be effective in many cases of cardiac arrhythmias, refractory ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. Pulmonary toxicity is a possible side effect of the drug, with a reported incidence of 2 to 15 percent per year. To determine the effect of amiodarone on lung function, we prospectively studied serial lung function tests in a cohort of 91 patients with refractory cardiac arrhythmias treated with this agent. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Spirometry and carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) were measured at zero, three, six, 12, 18, and 24 months, with a mean follow-up of 351 days. RESULTS: For the whole population taking a mean dose of amiodarone of 367 mg daily (range: 136 to 512 mg), there was no accelerated rate of decline in spirometric indices or DLCO. Analysis of lung function changes by multivariate analysis demonstrated that an accelerated decline in DLCO values occurred in elderly patients (p less than 0.05) but not in patients with pre-existing lung disease or cigarette smokers. In four patients (4.5 percent), clinical evidence of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity developed that was associated with a fall in DLCO of greater than 20 percent. All four patients recovered after the drug was stopped. Another 15 patients, without clinical evidence of pulmonary toxicity, had a sustained decline in DLCO of greater than 20 percent. These 15 patients remained asymptomatic over the next 11 months without interruption of therapy. A greater than 20 percent fall in DLCO was a sensitive test for clinically evident amiodarone pulmonary toxicity, but had a positive predictive value of only 21 percent. CONCLUSION: An isolated fall in DLCO, in the absence of clinical evidence of toxicity, does not necessitate stopping amiodarone. An unchanged DLCO value appears to be a reliable negative predictor of pulmonary toxicity.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Plasma levels of the sympathetic neurotransmitters norepinephrine and epinephrine and of the sympathetic co-transmitter NPY were measured in 17 patients with CHF and 14 healthy control subjects at rest and after maximal exercise. RESULTS: Under resting conditions, plasma NPY and norepinephrine levels were elevated in patients with CHF compared with control subjects (551 +/- 48 pg/ml versus 311 +/- 22 pg/ml, p less than or equal to 0.001 for NPY, and 306 +/- 73 pg/ml versus 124 +/- 22 pg/ml, p less than or equal to 0.02 for norepinephrine). Plasma NPY correlated better with plasma norepinephrine than with epinephrine, indicating its origin from sympathetic nerve terminals. Acute stimulation of sympathetic activity by dynamic exercise increased plasma norepinephrine levels in control subjects and patients with CHF, but did not significantly alter the mean plasma NPY value in the latter group. CONCLUSION: NPY may play a role in the pathophysiology of CHF.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The concentrations of myeloperoxidase (MPO), a neutrophil granule constituent, and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), a specific eosinophil granule protein, were measured in jejunal perfusion fluid in an attempt to elucidate the neutrophil and eosinophil involvement of the small bowel in health and disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The control group consisted of 14 males and two females. Ten patients (seven males and three females) with Crohn's disease and seven patients (two males and five females) with celiac disease were also studied; in addition, one patient with relapsing giardiasis, one patient with giardiasis and complete absence of plasma cells in small intestinal lamina propria, and one patient with selective IgA deficiency and no IgA plasma cells in duodeno-jejunal lamina propria were evaluated. Segmental perfusion of the jejunum was performed according to a previously described method. MPO and ECP were measured by radioimmunoassays. RESULTS: In healthy control subjects, the concentrations of both granule proteins were in a narrow range and much higher than would have been anticipated from passive leakage from circulating blood. In patients with celiac disease, the perfusion fluid concentrations of MPO and ECP were on average 3.5 and eight times, respectively, higher than the values seen in the controls. The jejunal segment perfused in patients with Crohn's disease was endoscopically and histologically normal. The perfusion fluid concentrations of MPO and ECP were increased 3.5 and two times, respectively, compared with that in the control subjects. Both patient groups and the control group had similar perfusion fluid concentrations of albumin. Data on MPO and ECP expressed as jejunal secretion rates gave the same differences between patients and controls as just described for the jejunal fluid concentrations. Immunohistochemical studies of jejunal biopsy specimens from another group of patients with celiac disease demonstrated a prominent extracellular deposit of ECP in the lamina propria of the atrophic intestinal mucosa, whereas the release of neutrophil constituents (cathepsin G, MPO) was scarce. In Crohn's disease, an extracellular degranulation of ECP and, to a lesser extent, of cathepsin G was observed in relation to ulcerations only. CONCLUSION: Data obtained indicate that the local release of neutrophil and eosinophil granule components is enhanced in the jejunal tissue from patients with celiac sprue and Crohn's disease. The prominent extracellular deposit of eosinophil granule constituents with cytotoxic properties at the site of inflammatory intestinal lesions in celiac sprue might reflect a pathophysiologic mechanism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Treatment of such patients may be complicated by their underlying immunodeficiency, especially when aggressive regimens are used. Clinical presentation and treatment outcomes were assessed in 31 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who had or were at risk for infection with HIV-1 at a single community institution. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Lymphomas presented in advanced stages and involved extranodal sites. Twenty-six patients received therapy (two radiation, one surgery), and a total of 23 patients received chemotherapy. RESULTS: A 52 percent response rate was seen with the use of chemotherapy. A history of opportunistic infections, or Kaposi's sarcoma, or both impacted negatively on the ability to achieve a complete response. Sixty-four percent of the 11 patients who received an intensive chemotherapeutic regimen, MACOP-B (methotrexate, Adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, bleomycin) had complete remissions. Overall median survival for 23 patients who received chemotherapy was seven months. Patients achieving complete responses had a median survival of 20 months. CONCLUSION: Our results support intensive chemotherapy for patients with lymphoma and HIV-1 infection.\r"

  ".W": "We hypothesized that bioactive peptides might be released into the portal circulation and mediate pathophysiologic alterations accompanying small bowel obstruction. We studied this question in a subacute canine small bowel obstruction model using 50 percent diameter occlusion. Control animals underwent sham laparotomy. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), peptide YY, and gastrin were measured in portal and systemic plasma by specific radioimmunoassays at 24-hour intervals as the obstruction progressed to completion over 5 days. All peptides in both groups demonstrated portal and peripheral gradients. In control dogs, peptide concentrations did not change postoperatively but VIP increased markedly in obstructed dogs, demonstrating a median portal level of 95 pmol/liter at 96 hours compared with 31.5 pmol/liter in control animals. These portal VIP levels are known to cause hypersecretion and splanchnic vasodilation in experimental models. The release of vasoactive compounds such as VIP may mediate local pathophysiology in human small bowel obstruction. A similar explanation of the systemic effects is consistent with the known cardiopulmonary bioactivity of VIP.\r"

Early endoscopic evaluation was the best means of assessing the degree of injury after caustic ingestion. Routine steroid administration had no apparent clinical benefit.\r"

Among 323 consecutive patients with proved biliary obstruction, 21 (7 percent) developed acute cholangitis after examination. Four patients underwent emergency surgery for the control of sepsis with two deaths. Of the 21 parameters chosen for evaluation, malignant obstruction, fever (higher than 37.5 degrees C) within 72 hours before the procedure or when afebrile, and an increased aspartate transaminase level of 70 IU or more were the independent predictive factors identified by multivariate analysis. An increased temperature should be regarded as an absolute contraindication to examination unless followed by immediate ductal drainage. Since the risk of septic complications is minimal when none of the risk factors are present, routine urgent biliary decompression after ERCP is probably unnecessary for these selected patients. For patients with malignant obstruction or other risk factors, early elective surgical drainage is advisable. When surgery is not feasible, nonoperative drainage of the obstructed biliary system as a preventive measure might be considered.\r"

Tritium-labeled fluorodeoxyuridine (H3-FUDR) and technetium-99m-labeled macroaggregated albumin (Tc 99m-MAA) were infused through the hepatic artery, portal vein, and peripheral vein. Hepatic artery infusion resulted in a significantly improved tumor-to-liver ratio of FUDR uptake (p less than 0.001). The increased tumor uptake correlated with a two-fold increase in tumor arterial blood flow as compared with normal liver demonstrated by the MAA infusion. We conclude that infusional therapy is superior to both portal vein and systemic infusions. Portal vein infusion results in no uptake of drug by the tumor. Hepatic artery scintigraphy with MAA may be useful in selecting appropriate patients for this type of therapy.\r"

Nine of the 17 patients had disease accurately predicted by the Indacea scanning. The management of each of these nine patients was, or could have been, modified by the scan findings and unnecessary surgery eliminated. A number of patients without post-operative disease had an unexplained increase in plasma carcinoembryonic antigen level due to production of human antimouse antibody. The addition of excess mouse immunoglobulin to the plasma prior to assay blocked this artifactual increase.\r"

Using radiolabeled catalase and PEG-catalase in subtherapeutic tracer doses, the pancreas tissue distributions of each were determined in rats with and without pancreatitis. Rats with cerulein-induced pancreatitis developed tissue concentrations of catalase within the pancreas that were three times those of PEG-catalase. The relatively low levels of PEG-catalase in the pancreas outside of the vascular compartment suggest that the failure to prevent edema formation may result from inability of PEG-catalase to reach extravascular sites of injury because of the large molecular size.\r"

Operative mortality was 0. The follow-up rate was 93 percent. Overall mortality was 1 percent, with no death directly attributed to the operative procedure. Weight loss was studied over the 6-year study period. Four to 6 years postoperatively, overall weight loss was 50 to 64 percent of excess weight. The treatment failure rate 12 to 18 months postoperatively was 5 percent. The experience with gastric restrictive surgery in 12 centers involving 5,178 patients was reviewed and compared with our results. Overall operative and late mortality rates were quite similar to observed death rates for nonobese men and women between 25 and 64 years of age. These data suggest that gastric surgery for morbid obesity results in a significant reduction in health risk.\r"

Although the cholesterol saturation index was significantly increased compared with control subjects, it remained less than 1. In addition to the changes in biliary lipid composition, the corn and alfalfa-fed animals had significantly decreased transepithelial potential difference and short-circuit current when compared with control animals. These are changes in gallbladder mucosal function similar to those that have been reported in humans with gallstones. This model may therefore prove to be of great value in studying the pathogenesis of noncholesterol gallstones.\r"

We have recently reported that secretion of these salts exerts negative feedback control on the release of cholecystokinin (CCK). The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of long-term alterations of luminal concentrations of bile salts on CCK target organs, the pancreas and gallbladder. The bile salt pool in adult guinea pigs was either enriched by feeding 0.5 percent sodium taurocholate or depleted by feeding 2 percent cholestyramine. Pancreatic growth, gallbladder contractility, the concentration of cholecystokinin receptors in the gallbladder muscle, and meal-stimulated plasma levels of cholecystokinin were significantly stimulated by feeding the bile salt sequestrant cholestyramine to guinea pigs. Administration of the bile salt taurocholate produced the opposite effects. Inhibition of CCK release by bile salts and up-regulation of CCK receptors by CCK may be the mechanisms responsible for the actions of bile salts on CCK target organs.\r"

The animals were divided into four groups: control, naloxone, meal, and meal plus naloxone. In the control and naloxone groups, the fluxes did not change over the 4-hour observation period. Meal alone immediately stimulated the absorption of water and electrolytes in the Thiry-Vella loop (p less than 0.05). The addition of naloxone infusion to the meal stimulus resulted in significantly reduced absorption during the first hour after the meal (p less than 0.05). We concluded that endogenous opiates play a role in meal-stimulated jejunal absorption.\r"

The combination of biliary symptoms and a fibrotic ampulla of Vater portends a favorable surgical outcome in virtually all such patients. Patients with pancreatitis did worse overall, perhaps due to the existence of unappreciated subclinical parenchymal disease not related to sphincter dysfunction. Although endoscopic retrograde cholangiography was sensitive in demonstrating abnormalities of the pancreaticobiliary system, its specificity as a predictor of good results was poor. It seems prudent to temper one's enthusiasm for sphincteroplasty in the patient with pancreatitis, whereas patients with biliary symptoms, the postcholecystectomy syndrome, or both will usually benefit significantly from this procedure.\r"

Stimulation of the celiac neural bundle in the presence of hyperglycemia resulted in augmentation of pancreatic polypeptide release. Cholinergic stimulation appears to predominate, whereas beta-adrenergic fibers stimulate pancreatic polypeptide-cell secretion, and alpha-adrenergic fibers inhibit pancreatic polypeptide release. During euglycemia, both cholinergic stimulation and gastric inhibitory polypeptide infusion resulted in a marked release of pancreatic polypeptide. These stimulatory effects were additive, which suggests a linked hormonal and neural mechanism of pancreatic polypeptide release after a meal. In this in vitro human model, our data confirm that the splanchnic innervation of the pancreas has a potent regulatory role in pancreatic hormone release in man.\r"

We studied 24-hour continuous gastric pH in healthy subjects, patients with cholelithiasis, and patients who had undergone cholecystectomy. Cholecystectomy decreased the percentage of time that gastric pH is below 2 and increased the time it is above 4 and 6. Furthermore, there was a greater increase in the more alkaline pH values in patients who were symptomatic than in those who were asymptomatic. The results demonstrated that cholecystectomy is associated with an alkaline shift in the 24-hour gastric pH profile that is most marked in symptomatic patients. This suggests that gastric alkaline episodes may be related to some postcholecystectomy symptoms.\r"

Under acidic conditions (pH 4.5), aspirin (5 mM) reduced the intracellular pH from 6.99 +/- 0.03 to 6.87 +/- 0.04 (p less than 0.001) and depolarized cell membrane potential from -36.7 +/- 1.5 to -30.3 +/- 1.6 mV, p less than 0.001). Similarly, acetic acid (5 mM) acidified the cells (-0.20 +/- 0.02, p less than 0.001) and depolarized cell membrane potential (+9.6 +/- 1.9 mV, p less than 0.01). These changes suggest that, in the absence of luminal acid, small organic acids, such as aspirin and acetic acid, may have complex effects on the ionic conductances of the surface cell membranes without altering intracellular pH. In contrast, under acidic conditions, these agents increase the permeability of the apical cell membrane-to-acid back-diffusion from the gastric lumen.\r"

  ".W": "We studied 76 patients with symptoms of heartburn, regurgitation, or both and 38 asymptomatic control subjects by measuring the gastric emptying of technetium-99m-labeled oatmeal. In addition, we performed 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring and manometric studies of the esophagus on all study participants. Endoscopy was performed on all patients. Patients with proved reflux on 24-hour pH monitoring, in comparison to those without reflux and the control subjects, had a shorter lower esophageal segment with a lower pressure and more esophagitis. Delayed gastric emptying occurred with equal frequency in patients with and without reflux. Esophageal reflux was not associated with delayed gastric emptying. Delayed emptying was associated with less esophagitis than found in those with normal gastric emptying, suggesting that the prolonged presence of food in the stomach may have a buffering effect on gastric acidity. We concluded that delayed emptying is not a major factor in the pathophysiology of gastro-esophageal reflux disease and that therapy aimed at speeding gastric emptying cannot be supported by our results.\r"

We tested this hypothesis in a dietary model of pigment gallstones. The concentration of ionized calcium (Ca++) and unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) was measured in 15 normal dogs and in 15 dogs with pigment gallstones induced by 6 weeks of a methionine-deficient diet. Although there was minimal change in the gallbladder's ability to acidify or concentrate bile, both [Ca++] and [UCB] markedly increased. These values were compared with equilibrium concentrations in model bile solutions. In all normal bile, the [UCB] was equal to or lower than the mean [UCB] concentration of model bile solutions with comparable [Ca++]. However, in all but one bile sample from dogs with pigment gallstones, the [UCB] exceeded this concentration and was therefore supersaturated with calcium bilirubinate. This supports the hypothesis that calcium bilirubinate precipitation is important in the formation and growth of pigment gallstones.\r"

This study evaluated the ability to selectively assign nonsweet eaters to vertical banded gastroplasty and sweet eaters to gastric bypass. Compared with random assignment, the percentage excess weight lost at 2 years improved significantly with both groups combined. In the vertical banded gastroplasty group, the percentage increased from 41 +/- 19 to 55 +/- 19 percent. With selective assignment, the percentage excess weight lost with gastric bypass was still better than that with vertical banded gastroplasty. Weight loss with gastric bypass was still superior to that of vertical banded gastroplasty but at the expense of more complications. Gastric bypass was ineffective in 19 percent of the super obese patients. A combined restrictive, malabsorptive procedure may be necessary in such persons.\r"

The plasma clearance did not differ between the two groups: 11.3 +/- 2.5 ml.min-1.kg-1 in controls and 10.8 +/- 4.6 ml.min-1.kg-1 in cirrhotic patients. The sufentanil free fraction was also similar in controls (8.3 +/- 1.5%) and in cirrhotic patients (9.6 +/- 1.8%).

Eighty-five ASA I and II adult patients received atracurium, 0.4 mg/kg, during a thiopental-nitrous oxide-enflurane anesthetic. Train-of-four stimulation was applied every 12 seconds, and the force of contraction of the adductor pollicis muscle was recorded. Edrophonium, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, or 1 mg/kg; neostigmine, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02 or 0.05 mg/kg; or no reversal agent was given when there was either 1% or 10% recovery of the first twitch response. With profound blockade, the slope of the edrophonium dose-response relationship was significantly flatter (P less than 0.05) than that of neostigmine. The dose of neostigmine required to achieve 80% first twitch recovery (ED80) after 10 minutes was 0.013 +/- 0.003 mg/kg (mean +/- SEM) if given at 10% recovery, and 0.032 +/- 0.004 mg/kg if given at 1% recovery. The ED80 for edrophonium was 0.22 +/- 0.04 mg/kg and 1.14 +/- 0.33 mg/kg, respectively. These values corresponded to neostigmine:edrophonium potency ratios of 16.6 +/- 3.5 and 35.3 +/- 8.9 at 90% and 99% blockade respectively (P less than 0.006). We conclude that the relative potency of neostigmine is greater than that of edrophonium for antagonism of profound atracurium blockade.\r"

Electromyographic monitoring with train-of-four stimuli was used. The steady infusion rate was 62 +/- 15 (SD) micrograms.kg-1.hr-1 in neonates and infants. This rate was 40% of that required by children 3 to 10 years old (154 +/- 49 micrograms.kg-1.hr-1; P less than 0.05). In adolescents the vecuronium requirement was less than in children and was comparable to that reported in adults in other studies (89 +/- 13 micrograms.kg-1.hr-1). Despite considerable individual variation, the infusion rate could be reliably estimated on the basis of duration of greater than 90% NMB maintained by small doses of vecuronium given after intubation. Also, a close correlation existed between the duration of greater than 90% NMB maintained by 100 micrograms/kg of vecuronium and the individual infusion rate (r2 = 0.76).\r"

  ".W": "Protamine neutralization of heparin is often associated with severe hemodynamic side-effects, including pulmonary hypertension and systemic hypotension. Because prostanoids may be involved, the authors studied the role of arachidonic acid metabolites, especially thromboxane A2, in this process. During anesthesia with enflurane and fentanyl, four groups of pigs were studied: Group 1 (n = 10) received heparin (250 IU/kg), followed by protamine (100 mg) after 15 minutes to neutralize the heparin. The same protocol was used in group 2 (n = 11), except that the thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist BM 13.177 (10 mg/kg) was infused 5 minutes before the protamine. The protocol for group 1 was also used for group 3 (n = 7) except that these animals were pretreated with indomethacin (10 mg/kg). Animals in group 4 (n = 10) were given protamine only (100 mg). Pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance increased significantly in group 1 after protamine neutralization of heparin. This was accompanied by significant increases in plasma concentrations of the cyclooxygenase products thromboxane B2, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, and prostaglandin F2 alpha. Cyclooxygenase products increased to comparable degrees in group 2, but without hemodynamic effects. Leukocyte counts decreased comparably in both groups. Hemodynamic reactions, as well as changes in plasma prostanoid levels were absent in group 3, and group 4, but leukocyte counts were less affected in animals that received protamine alone. The results indicate that the hemodynamic side-effects of protamine are mediated by prostanoids and that thromboxane A2 release is the pivotal step, because side effects were effectively prevented by pretreatment with a thromboxane receptor antagonist.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The spread of 5 ml of a solution of radiological contrast medium (sodium iothalamate) and local anesthetic mixture after 45 (34 thoracic, 11 lumbar) paravertebral injections was studied in 31 patients by radiography and computed tomography and correlated with the clinical effects. Spread confined to the paravertebral area occurred after only eight (18%) injections. Spread was epidural after 31 (70%) injections and exclusively so in 14 (31%) injections. Mean sensory loss was greater after epidural spread, but a wide range of sensation loss was observed with all patterns of spread. Intrapleural spread occurred after three injections, as did spread into the psoas muscle. In addition, measurements were made of 114 paravertebral spaces in 20 patients by means of computed tomography. Dimensional factors identified as possibly leading to complications of a paravertebral injection included narrow width of the thoracic transverse processes (mean, 3.18 cm; range, 2.1-4.2 cm) and the wide range in paravertebral dimensions. The distance from bony landmarks to pleura frequently fell outside the limits recommended by many standard texts. We conclude that the spread of a small volume of solution after paravertebral injection is imprecise and unpredictable. Neurolytic and diagnostic paravertebral injections performed without the aid of radiological imaging and contrast media should be regarded as hazardous and interpreted with extreme caution.\r"

This study was undertaken to assess the effect of exogenous progesterone on minimal alveolar concentrations (MAC) of halothane in ovariectomized rabbits. Minimal alveolar concentration of halothane was determined in 84 female rabbits, 37 intact (group A), 20 ovariectomized and injected with inert carrier peanut oil (group B), and 27 ovariectomized and injected with progesterone in peanut oil (group C). Minimal alveolar concentration in group A, 1.68 +/- 0.06% (mean +/- SEM), did not differ significantly from that in group B rabbits, 1.77 +/- 0.06%. However, MAC in progesterone-treated rabbits, 1.48 +/- 0.06%, was significantly lower than the MAC of the other two groups (P less than 0.01). Plasma progesterone concentrations in group A, B, and C were 5.28 +/- 0.62 ng/ml, 6.83 +/- 2.00 ng/ml, and 37.33 +/- 4.25 ng/ml, respectively. These results suggest that experimental treatment with progesterone can reduce the amount of halothane required to produce anesthesia and may explain the phenomenon of decreased need of inhalation anesthetic in human parturients.\r"

To systematically examine its neuromuscular effects over a wide dose range and its interaction with all popular nondepolarizing neuromuscular relaxants, the effects of ketamine 2, 5, and 10 mg/kg IV were studied on a continuous but incomplete (50%) neuromuscular block preestablished by an IV infusion of d-tubocurarine, atracurium, vecuronium, and pancuronium. Indirectly stimulated adductor pollicis muscle response of monkeys anesthetized with 0.5-1.0% halothane in oxygen were quantified. Ketamine in the absence of a neuromuscular relaxant had no effect on the thumb twitch. In a dose-dependent manner, ketamine significantly enhanced the 50% depression of the thumb twitch preestablished by a constant IV infusion of each of the four muscle relaxants studied. Ketamine 2 mg/kg potentiated the neuromuscular relaxants in the following order of magnitude: vecuronium greater than atracurium greater than d-tubocurarine greater than pancuronium. However, with a 10 mg/kg dose of ketamine, pancuronium became as potentiated as was vecuronium, i.e., pancuronium = vecuronium greater than atracurium greater than d-tubocurarine. It is concluded that in the primate, ketamine potentiates all nondepolarizing muscle relaxants in a dose-dependent manner.\r"

Anesthesia in these unpremedicated subjects was induced by inhalation of nitrous oxide, isoflurane, and oxygen. Tracheal intubation was facilitated with succinylcholine and the lungs were next ventilated with oxygen and isoflurane to produce an end-tidal concentration of 1.7%. Isoflurane concentration was determined by infrared analysis of expired gas collected from a Teflon catheter inserted through the endotracheal tube. After 25 minutes at steady state, the EEG was recorded for 5 minutes prior to surgical stimulation. Arterial blood pressure, temperature, and ventilation were maintained at normal values. In elderly patients the EEG had both a greater proportion of total time in electrical silence (76.0 +/- 10.8% vs 37.6 +/- 15.4%; P less than 0.01) and a greater number of isoelectric periods (19.7 +/- 8.1 vs 10.7 +/- 5.4; P less than 0.05). This demonstrates a discrete alteration with age in the central nervous system sensitivity to isoflurane.\r"

In 2 patients, removal of coronary blood by manual injection of saline was not adequate, and diagnostic TV images could not be obtained. In 2 patients with tortuous coronary arteries, the catheter could not pass to the atheromatous plaques owing to lack of flexibility of the fiberoptic catheter. Furthermore, angina pectoris occurred in 2 patients during angioscopy, owing probably to interference with coronary blood flow by the guide catheter and/or fiberoptic catheter itself. For future clinical application of coronary angioscopy, further improvements in the instrument are necessary.\r"

  ".W": "Blood pressure, carotid-femoral and brachioradial pulse wave velocities were measured in 123 male subjects: 32 normal subjects and 91 age-matched patients with sustained essential hypertension. The ratio between brachioradial (BR) and carotid-femoral (CF) pulse wave velocities was used as a marker of pressure wave amplitude changes from the aorta to the brachial artery. The ratio was similar in normotensive and hypertensive subjects and decreased with age to the same extent in both populations. In older subjects, the decrease in the ratio indicated that the amplitude of pulse pressure was quite similar in the aorta and the brachial artery whether the subjects were normotensives or hypertensives. The study provided evidence that adaptive changes occur in the arterial (aortic) wall in hypertension, for the effects of age on pressure wave transmission are similar in normal subjects and hypertensive patients. Such findings may be of prime importance in understanding the brachial blood pressure readings of patients with hypertension.\r"

Twelve male rats were divided into two groups: 6 sedentary rats (S) and 6 training rats (T), which were forced to swim from nine weeks to twenty-five weeks of age. The ultimate tensile stress and the ultimate tensile extension ratio of ring specimens at the descending thoracic aorta were larger in T than in S (192.3 +/- 47.9 g/mm2, mean +/- SD, vs 147.8 +/- 26.0, p less than 0.05; 3.52 +/- 0.13 vs 3.18 +/- 0.27, p less than 0.05; respectively). The elasticity parameter, calculated by fitting stress-strain curves to exponential function in the stress level of 0-20 g/mm2, was lower in T than in S (1.79 +/- 0.15 vs 2.13 +/- 0.24, p less than 0.01). The contents of elastin (alkali-insoluble elastin preparation) and collagen were higher in T than in S (0.44 +/- 0.11 g/g dry aorta vs 0.30 +/- 0.06, p less than 0.05; 0.15 +/- 0.04 g/g dry aorta vs 0.11 +/- 0.04, NS, respectively). Although the aortic calcium content did not significantly change in the training rats (T 1.17 +/- 0.23 mg/g dry aorta, S 0.95 +/- 0.34), the content of calcium in elastin was lower in T than in S (1.75 +/- 0.51 mg/g dry elastin vs 2.63 +/- 1.00, p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All emergency department, LAX first-aid station, and paramedic records were examined. There were 8,735,000 passenger arrivals at LAX during the study period; 260 passengers (0.003%) developed medical complaints in flight, and of these 260, 115 (44.2%) had symptoms that lasted for more than one hour. Only 20 (8%) had in-flight physician assistance. One hundred thirty-seven (52.6%) passengers required only first-aid station treatment or signed out against medical advice, 123 (47.3%) were triaged to the ED, and 25 (9.6%) were admitted to the hospital. Seven passengers had fatal events while in flight. Most of the illnesses encountered did not require advanced medical treatment. We conclude that while in-flight medical illnesses occur more frequently than believed by airlines, true emergencies are rare. The rarity of true in-flight medical emergencies coupled with low physician availability bring into question the benefit of any comprehensive medical kit on airliners.\r"

Three historical variables were statistically less likely to be associated with pregnancy: last menstrual period that was on time, the patient thinking she was not pregnant, and the patient stating there was no chance she could be pregnant (P less than .001). There was, however, still at least a 10% chance of the patient being pregnant. Combinations of historical criteria were likewise unsuccessful at totally excluding pregnancy.

The percentage of patients requiring nonpsychiatric hospitalizations was not significantly different between the two groups (11.2% vs 14.0%, respectively). For the hospitalized patients, the length of time spent in the ICU and in the hospital was not statistically different between the two groups. A complication rate of 5.4% was found with the ipecac and activated charcoal treatment compared with a 0.9% complication rate in the activated charcoal group (P less than or equal to .05). Three episodes of aspiration pneumonitis occurred after administration of ipecac and activated charcoal, while no episodes of aspiration were noted after treatment with only activated charcoal.

Exposure to granular automatic dishwashing detergents has been associated with caustic injury similar to the pathology produced by other alkaline corrosives. Do LADDs produce similar toxicity? There is no published information that profiles the toxic manifestations associated with exposure to LADDs. To determine their toxicity, all LADD exposures reported to a regional poison information center over a 12-month period were collected. One hundred ninety-two human exposure cases were reviewed. Pediatric patients accounted for 76% of the exposures; 76% were ingestions, 12% were dermal exposures, and 12% were ocular exposures. Seventy-nine percent of the patients were exposed to a full-strength product, and 21% contacted a dilute product or one that had already been through the dishwashing cycle. Of the patients who ingested a LADD, 91.1% remained asymptomatic, 8.2% had minor symptoms, and only one (0.7%) suffered moderate toxicity. In contrast, 91.3% of all patients who had an ocular exposure developed minor or moderate toxicity (73.9% vs 17.4%). Of dermal exposures, 69.6% were asymptomatic, and those with symptoms were the result of inappropriate use. Overall, 78.7% remained asymptomatic, 18.2% developed minor toxicity, and 3.1% developed moderate toxicity. Small oral and dermal exposures usually do not result in toxicity and do not necessitate referral to an ED. Ocular exposures are associated with a high incidence of at least minor toxicity and require ED evaluation.\r"

The superior ductility of needles made by one manufacturer was related to the specific alloy, stainless steel ASTM 45500, used in their production. The ASTM 45500 stainless steel has a significantly greater tensile and yield strength than the other stainless steel alloys, accounting for its superior ductility.\r"

The close quarters and proximity of vital electronic equipment have generated concern among personnel carrying out defibrillation in the air. We address the chief safety issues in helicopter defibrillation by providing measurements of the transient leakage current resulting from contact with a paddle and tested in-flight electronic interference and survey the defibrillation experience of helicopter programs. Our data show that airborne defibrillation is safe. A maximum of 1.5 mA of transient leakage current was measured from a standard battery-powered defibrillator, well within the accepted safety standard of 50 mA. In flight, there was no interference with the avionics or medical equipment, and adequate clearance was available for personnel. Of the helicopter programs surveyed, 69 (87%) had defibrillated in flight without incident. We conclude that defibrillation can be performed in the helicopter without hesitation whether on the ground or in the air, provided standard defibrillation precautions are observed.\r"

Except for subtle personality and cognitive changes, all of the patients were making good neurological recoveries. The Halstead-Reitan Neuropsychological Test Battery, which has been shown to be accurate in identifying brain-damaged patients, was used as the measure of outcome. The age of the patients ranged from 16 to 49 years (mean, 25.6; SD, 9.3). The patients' educational levels ranged from elementary school to college (mean, 11.6 years of education; SD, 1.5). Halstead Impairment Indexes (HII) ranged from 0.0 to 1.0 (mean, 0.6; SD, 0.26). APACHE II scores were calculated using the worst values, obtained during the first 24 hours. These scores ranged from 5 to 35 (mean, 16; SD, 7). APACHE II was found to not significantly correlate with HII (r = 0.21, P greater than .05). ISS was calculated for each patient and ranged from 5 to 70 (mean, 27; SD, 13). ISS was found to significantly correlate with HII (r = 0.38, P less than .01). GCS ranged from 3 to 15 (mean, 9.3; SD, 3.4). Of all the correlations, GCS was the most strongly correlated with outcome as measured by the HII (r = -0.44, P less than .01). Our data emphasize that head-injured patients have subtle cognitive dysfunction even when apparently recovering well and demonstrate the need for formal psychological evaluation in all patients with injury significant enough to warrant hospitalization.\r"

The literature does not address this specifically but implies that meningeal signs are reliable and usually present in awake patients, except infants, the elderly, and the immunosuppressed. In the following three cases two adults and a 4-year-old child, none of them immunosuppressed, presented with bacterial meningitis with no meningeal signs. In the first case, mental status was completely normal; in the second, there was only minor lethargy attributed to pain medication. In the third, lethargy was attributed to head trauma. In all three the diagnosis of meningitis was delayed up to 19 hours; lumbar puncture was performed while meningeal signs were still absent and cerebrospinal fluid analysis was grossly abnormal. All three patients had Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis, and all three suffered massive brain damage within 24 hours of presentation and eventually died. Although the true incidence of absent meningeal signs in meningitis is unknown, the condition is rare. Clinicians cannot rely on the absence of neck stiffness to rule out meningitis, even in healthy and awake adults, and lumbar puncture should be performed whenever there is serious consideration of that diagnosis.\r"

Bone and cartilage grafts have been used for this purpose, but they have often failed to maintain position in the larynx and/or trachea following reconstruction, and they tend to be reabsorbed. The rotary door flap can provide an undelayed, one-stage epithelial resurfacing of the larynx and trachea while simultaneously restoring luminal support without the need for transfer of cartilage or bone. Luminal support for the trachea is provided by the bulk, turgor, and anterior traction of the intact sternohyoid muscle, which serves as the carrier for the rotated skin island. During inspiration the intact muscle, whose points of attachment are anterior to the plane of the larynx and trachea, contracts and tends to open the airway to provide dynamic luminal support. The need for internal stenting is minimized. The technique is described and experience in 20 patients is presented.\r"

Although some of these failure can be recaptured with subsequent laser surgery, the overall \"cure\" rate does not exceed 70%, even in the best hands. The contributions of Isshiki, LeJeune, and Tucker have demonstrated that tension in the vocal folds can be adjusted by laryngeal framework surgery.

We compared the findings of direct laryngoscopy, palpation of the neck, and CT with pathologic specimens in 29 patients who underwent surgery for carcinoma of the larynx. We found that CT scanning underestimated the extent of neoplastic involvement in over half the cases. With respect to cartilage invasion we determined a significant number of false-negative findings. Computed tomographic scanning was equivalent to palpation in predicting cervical metastasis. Our findings indicate that the role of CT scanning may be more limited than previously acknowledged, particularly in patients for whom nonconservation surgery is planned.\r"

The right vocal cord was paralyzed by severance and removal of 2.5 cm of the right recurrent laryngeal nerve. Evaluation 6 months postoperatively revealed the vocal fold remobilization on the right side to have an average of about one half the mobility of the left, normal side. After the recurrent laryngeal and superior laryngeal nerves on the left were severed, the vocal cord mobility dropped to only about one fourth. This suggests that the dogs had contralateral reinnervation. Nevertheless, the right vocal cord mobility, driven only by the right superior laryngeal nerve, was enough to secure an adequate airway without the need for a tracheotomy. This experiment was statistically significant on comparison with a control group. Electromyographic studies as well as PCA histochemistry were performed.\r"

Therefore, using epilated pigmented and albino guinea pig skin, we studied the acute injury and tissue repair caused by 40-ns, Q-switched ruby laser pulses. Gross observation and light and electron microscopy were performed. No specific changes were evident in the albino guinea pigs. In pigmented animals, with radiant exposures of 0.4 J/cm2 or greater, white spots confined to the 2.5-mm exposure sites developed immediately and faded over 20 minutes. Delayed depigmentation occurred at seven to ten days, followed by full repigmentation by four to eight weeks. Regrowing hairs in sites irradiated at and above 0.4 J/cm2 remained white for at least four months. Histologically, vacuolation of pigment-laden cells was seen immediately in the epidermis and the follicular epithelium at exposures of 0.3 J/cm2 and greater. Melanosomal disruption was seen immediately by electron microscopy at and above 0.3 J/cm2. Over the next seven days, epidermal necrosis was followed by regeneration of a depigmented epidermis. By four months, melanosomes and melanin pigmentation had returned; however, hair follicles remained depigmented and devoid of melanocytes. This study demonstrates that selective melanosomal disruption caused by Q-switched ruby laser pulses leads to transient cutaneous depigmentation and persistent follicular depigmentation. Potential exists for selective treatment of pigmented epidermal and dermal lesions with this modality.\r"

Eight animals were treated with 0.05% tretinoin cream daily for ten days prior to partial-thickness skin wounding. Daily tretinoin treatment was continued after wounding on two of eight animals. Treatment with topical tretinoin before wounding accelerated epithelial wound healing in partial-thickness wounds. Continued tretinoin treatment on the wounds themselves retarded reepithelialization. Biopsy specimens of wounds with continued tretinoin treatment revealed persistent inflammation and fibroplasia in the dermis. The healing epithelium itself displayed areas of spongiosis and intracytoplasmic pale eosinophilic periodic acid-Schiff-positive, diastase-resistant globules. These globules did not stain with alcian blue. These epidermal alterations may be a direct effect of tretinoin or may be secondary to the underlying inflammation. While the dermal inflammation associated with continued tretinoin treatment appears to retard reepithelialization, epithelial cell alterations may also play a role.\r"

X-ray analysis revealed patterns of calcium and phosphorus deposition in the von Kossa-positive areas, and the immunohistochemical staining using monoclonal antibodies identified increased chondroitin-6-sulfate in these areas when compared with normal skin. Scanning transmission electron microscopy observation combined with X-ray dot mapping show calcium and phosphorus to be codistributed within the mineralized area. This study confirms by new methods the increase in chondroitin-6-sulfate, alterations in elastin and collagen, and a high calcium and phosphorus elemental distribution matching the mineralized area in the PXE dermis.\r"

  ".U": "89087201\r", 
  ".W": "The management of parotid sialoceles and fistulae have been unsatisfactory in the past, and numerous methods of treatment with varying success and morbidity have been described. The present prospective study reports results of conservative therapy in 51 patients over a 3-year period. In 50 patients, the injury healed upon conservative management. During the early phase of the study, a limited conservative regimen through which the patients received nothing orally for 5 days only was used. During the latter part of the study, patients were administered nothing orally until complete healing of the injury. In terms of the time it took for healing of the injury, the differences of the two regimens (24 +/- 4 vs. 9.4 +/- 0.9 days) was highly significant (p less than 0.001). The response to conservative management depended on the severity of injury as demonstrated by sialography. Injury to minor intraparotid ducts (G1) healed in significantly less time compared with that to a major intraparotid duct (G2) or ductal injuries (p less than 0.001). There was no difference between the healing of G2 injury (10.3 +/- 1.8 days) and partial ductal transections (10.5 +/- 2.2 days) (p greater than 0.05). There was a significantly greater delay in healing with complete duct transections (21.5 +/- 3.7 days) compared with partial duct transections and G2 injuries (10.2 +/- 2.1 days) (p less than 0.01). There was no difference in the mean period for healing between salivary fistulae and sialoceles (p greater than 0.05). It is concluded that a new classification of parotid fistulae based on sialographic findings has prognostic and therapeutic value. Furthermore, the excellent results achieved with conservative therapy in this study suggest that it may be the initial treatment of choice for parotid fistulae.\r"

To test this hypothesis, a study of the metabolic responses that occurred during 5 days of continuous intravenous (I.V.) infusion of TNF both in rats and tumor-bearing humans was conducted. TNF administration was associated with anorexia, fluid retention, acute phase responses, and negative nitrogen balance. In both species, changes in nitrogen balance were related to the onset of anorexia and not to the development of hypermetabolism and accelerated net tissue breakdown. TNF may represent the primary afferent stimulus inducing many of the metabolic changes that occur during critical illness, but it is not solely responsible for the accelerated net proteolysis that occurs in these patients.\r"

  ".U": "89087205\r", 
  ".W": "From 1982 to 1986, nine patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma primarily involving the pancreas were managed at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions. This group of nine patients represents 2.2% of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (nine of 402) and 4.9% of all patients presenting with pancreatic malignancies (nine of 182) at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions during this period. Computed tomography (CT) scan findings of a large pancreatic mass (6 cm) with extrapancreatic extension and significant retroperitoneal lymph node enlargement suggested lymphoma. Diagnosis was established by radiographically-guided needle biopsy in four patients, by laparotomy in four, and by peripheral lymph node biopsy in one. In five jaundiced patients, initial chemotherapy with the nonhepatotoxic agents cyclophosphamide and prednisone resulted in marked tumor regression, allowing for early resolution of jaundice and subsequent addition of more aggressive adriamycin containing combination chemotherapy. Overall, complete remission has occurred in six of nine patients, with a median survival of 24 months (range 4-69 months). It is concluded from this experience that the majority of patients with pancreatic lymphoma can be managed without surgery. Excellent control of symptoms, including jaundice, as well as long-term remission, can be obtained with chemotherapy alone. The only role for surgery in this setting may be to aid in establishing the diagnosis when percutaneous biopsy is nondiagnostic.\r"

The question arises: has \"gloved hand\" debridement resulted in pancreatectomy? The histologists report only \"necrotic debris, of uncertain origin.\" To obtain objective data, pancreatography was performed in 13 patients, 10 weeks to 23 months after onset of massive pancreatic necrosis. Each patient had required delayed laparotomy for debridement and external drainage at some earlier stage of their illness. Pancreatography was correlated with the clinical assessment of diabetes and steatorrhea. Except in specific cases involving internal fistulae, pancreatography has not been previously reported in such patients. The results demonstrate that the main pancreatic duct usually maintained its normal length and configuration. Necrosis or stricture of the main duct, if it occurred, was more likely to be followed by diabetes. Steatorrhea was clinically detected in a single patient only. The necrotic tissue, up to several kilograms in wet weight, is largely dead adipose tissue. The pancreas, especially its head, is resistant to necrosis, much more resistant than is the retroperitoneal fat.\r"

The mortality rate of the 185 patients who were treated with operation was 18%. Of those patients treated nonoperatively, the mortality was 95% (one survivor). There was a definite difference in mortality among those patients treated with definitive operative procedures (11.3%) versus those patients treated with nondefinitive surgery (22.9%). This difference was consistent even in the presence of purulent exudate in the abdominal cavity and among those patients presenting in shock. The mortality among those patients who presented with a initial blood pressure of 90 mmHg or less were defined as being in shock, and the mortality in this subgroup was 52.8%. The mortality among those patients who had purulent fluid within the abdominal cavity was about the same, regardless of type of surgical procedure. The patients who underwent nondefinitive procedures required subsequent operative treatment in 25.7% of cases. Also noted was the lack of correlation between symptoms of ulcer disease and perforation. Those patients treated with definitive surgery (57%) and those treated with nondefinitive surgery (41%) reported no symptoms consistent with ulcer disease before operation.\r"

Sixty-five patients were prospectively investigated as to whether these patterns are indeed sepsis specific, or specific for metabolic stress without concomitant sepsis, or associated with the presence of organ failure. Virtually all aminoacid levels were decreased by 10-30% (p less than 0.05), whereas cystine and phenylalanine were significantly elevated. These changes were more pronounced in severe sepsis. Organ failure was not associated with significantly altered amino acid profiles. No differences were found between sepsis and stress without signs of sepsis. In addition, imminent death was not associated with aberrant amino acid profiles. We conclude that sepsis and metabolic stress are associated with changes in plasma amino acid profiles, but that such changes are aspecific and therefore poor indicators of disease severity.\r"

  ".U": "89087213\r", 
  ".W": "A phase II trial was conducted with 15 patients (mean age of 65.7 years) with locally recurrent or intransit melanoma of the extremities. After total outflow occlusion with pneumatic tourniquet, the cell-cycle nonspecific anti-neoplastic agent cis-diamminedicholoroplatinum (CDDP) was infused intra-arterially in a mean dose of 26.7 mg/m2 per infusion (2.6 infusions per patient). The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of CDDP infusion for control of intransit and recurrent melanoma of the extremities. Three to four weeks postinfusion, all visible residual disease was resected. Partial remissions were observed in ten patients (67%); five patients achieved stable disease status. No patient had complete regression of disease. At an average follow-up interval of 18.3 months (range 4-44 months), the mean local/regional disease-free survival was 14.8 months. Eighty per cent of patients (twelve of 15) had local/regional control of disease at an average follow-up of 14.8 months after CDDP infusion and surgical resection. Of five melanoma-related deaths, three patients had had no local/regional recurrence at the time of their demise. Three compartment syndromes resulted as a complication of the infusional therapy and occurred within 1-3 days of the treatment. In vitro growth of melanoma from lymph nodes draining the infused area was seen in all subjects studied. Outgrowth from tumor within the tourniquet infusion area was observed in two patients, both of whom experienced recurrences clinically at 24-months' postinfusion. Pharmacokinetic data of total CDDP concentrations from tissue and blood (n = 4) were available from pretreatment to 1 hour post-therapy. Biopsy data from patients pre- and post-treatment suggest substantial tumor uptake of CDDP as compared to local or distal normal skin, with minimal CDDP loss to the systemic circulation. Pharmacologic and clinical data of this phase II trial suggest that intraarterial infusion with tourniquet outflow-occlusion augments tumor tissue levels of CDDP within the infused extremity and enhances local control of high-risk and intransit disease.\r"

In 73 patients with sepsis and malnutrition (Training Group, Madrid) the following were determined: percentage of recent weight loss, triceps skin fold, midarm muscle circumference, serum albumin, serum transferrin, delayed hypersensitivity skin test response, total lymphocytes, and Nae/Ke ratio by multiple isotope dilution. The predictive power of Nae/Ke ratio was so strong (F = 105.1; p less than 0.00001) that it displaced anthropometric, biochemical, and immunologic variables from the linear equation derived from stepwise discriminant analysis using hospital mortality as the dependent variable. A theoretical curve of expected deaths was developed, based on an equation obtained by logistic regression analysis: Pr/death/ = 1/(1 + e[11.8-5.2 Nae/Ke]). Pre- and post-test probabilities on that curve allowed us to determine two cut-off values, Nae/Ke ratios of 1.5 and 2.5, which were markers for nonrisk and mortality, respectively. The model was tested in a heterogeneous data base of surgical patients (n = 417) in another hospital (Validation Group, Montreal). For patients exhibiting an abnormal Nae/Ke ratio (greater than 1.2) and a greater than 10% of probability of death, 54 deaths were expected and 53 observed (X2 = 1.8 NS). Two tests confirmed the basic agreement between the model and its performance, a G statistic of -0.704 and the area beneath the \"receiver-operating-characteristic\" (ROC) curve (Az = 0.904 + 0.0516 for the Madrid group vs. Az = 0.915 + 0.0349 for the Montreal group, NS). It was concluded from this analysis that, compared with the usual anthropometric measurements, the Nae/Ke ratio, if available, is the best method for identifying malnourished patients at risk of dying.\r"

In ten cases, the muscular layer of the esophagus was disrupted, and in three the mucosal layer of the jejunum was disrupted. There were 18 delayed complications: eight cases of anastomotic leakage (3.4%), and ten of stenosis (4.2%). The leakage in one case was classified as major, and those in the other seven as minor. Of the ten stenosis cases, there were five of membranous stricture, four of granular stricture, and one of narrowing after major leakage healing. Only this last case required further surgical treatment. The other nine were successfully dilated either endoscopically or by bougienage.\r"

The prolactin response to tryptophan was significantly enhanced after short-term lithium treatment; long-term lithium treatment had no effect. Other studies have shown that the prolactin response to tryptophan is also enhanced after long-term tricyclic antidepressant treatment in depressed patients and after short- and long-term lithium treatment in healthy subjects. The present findings suggest that lithium treatment enhances 5-HT function, but that homeostatic responses of the 5-HT system to long-term lithium treatment may differ in patients with affective disorder and healthy subjects.\r"

To investigate this relationship further, we administered the serotonin (5-HT) receptor antagonist, metergoline, and placebo to ten patients with OCD in a crossover study carried out under double-blind, random-assignment conditions. In a previous study of untreated patients with OCD, we found no differences in the behavioral response to single-dose administration of metergoline or placebo. In the present study, patients with OCD receiving clomipramine hydrochloride on a long-term basis (with an average 40% lessening in OC symptoms) responded to a four-day period of administration of metergoline with significantly greater self- and observer-rated anxiety compared with the four-day placebo period. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms also tended to be greater during the metergoline phase, with significant drug-time interactions for both OC symptoms and anxiety peaking on day 4 of the metergoline phase. As anticipated, metergoline lowered plasma prolactin concentrations (providing evidence of physiologically significant 5-HT antagonism) but did not alter plasma clomipramine concentrations. These data further support the hypothesis that clomipramine's therapeutic behavioral effects in OCD are mediated via serotonergic mechanisms.\r"

The same instructions were given to both groups. On two days, they were asked to eat a normal amount, and on two days, they were asked to eat as much as they could, ie, to binge. For each type of instruction, they were given a single- and a multiple-course meal. The patients ate significantly more than the controls when asked to binge, both on the multiple-course meals that they rated as typical of binges and on the single-course meals. When they were asked to eat normally, there was no significant difference in intake between patients and controls on either single- or multiple-course meals. After all meals, hunger ratings of patients were significantly higher than hunger ratings of controls. There was also a significant positive correlation between intakes of single- and multiple-course binge meals and an inverse correlation between intake of multiple-course binge meals in bulimic patients and their rating of how well they controlled their eating. Thus, a structured laboratory eating situation can be used to reveal differences between bulimic and normal individuals and has the potential for assessing clinical status and exploring mechanisms responsible for binge eating.\r"

The CSF, plasma, and urinary free cortisol levels were elevated in underweight anorexic patients and showed declines following weight recovery. Cortisol-binding globulin levels were similar in anorexics and controls. In contrast, underweight anorexics showed low CSF ACTH levels that returned to normal following weight recovery, and their plasma ACTH levels were normal. On hospital admission, bulimic patients demonstrated normal ACTH and cortisol levels. After their abstinence from binge-purge episodes, the CSF ACTH levels decreased significantly. Positive relationships were found among CSF, plasma, and urinary cortisol levels, and inverse relationships were seen between cortisol measures and CSF ACTH levels in patients with eating disorders. Secretion of ACTH into the CSF may respond to feedback by cortisol or, alternatively, may be suppressed by the hypersecretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone, leading to the depletion of the pro-opiomelanocortin molecule.\r"

Giemsa stains revealed that mast cells were present in lesions both with and without eosinophils. The only clinical features that distinguished patients with tissue eosinophilia from those without were an older age of incidence and a longer duration of disease prior to biopsy. Drugs were implicated as a causative factor in some patients both with and without eosinophils, but all four patients with tissue eosinophilia were believed to have drug-induced disease. We conclude that eosinophils do occur in skin lesions of erythema multiforme and are occasionally numerous.\r"

The interstitial mucinous fluid consisted predominantly of hyaluronic acid. Immunohistochemical staining in five cases showed prominent positivity for vimentin (four cases), isolated cytokeratin AE1/3-positive cells (two cases), and nonreactivity for carcinoembryonic antigen and milk fat globule-2. Ultrastructurally, epithelial cells that resembled granulosa cells of the nonneoplastic preovulatory follicle and occasional cells with steroidogenic organelles were also found.

In order to assess whether the clinical diagnosis at death influenced the decision to request necropsy in deaths occurring in the hospital, a 10% sample of all adult necropsies at the University of Kansas Medical Center (Kansas City) from 1962 through 1981 was obtained. These patients (cases) were matched by age, race, sex, and date of death to hospital deaths not undergoing necropsy (controls). The charts were reviewed, and the primary diagnosis at death was ascertained and categorized into one of the 14 categories of the International Classification of Diseases. There were 412 case-control pairs, with 237 men and 175 women in each group. Most patients were classified under the headings Circulatory (142 cases vs 140 controls) and Neoplasm (143 cases vs 148 controls), followed by Respiratory (21 cases vs 33 controls) and Digestive (44 cases vs 28 controls). Overall, no statistically significant differences were observed between cases and controls. There were no gender-specific differences in all but two of the categories. In men, the controls had more patients classified under the heading injury (19 vs seven). In women, the control group had more patients classified under the heading Respiratory (14 vs four). Because of multiple comparisons, these findings could have occurred by chance. These data suggest that the primary diagnosis at death is not a source of bias in the selection for necropsy. Consequently, necropsy-selection bias, if it exists, may be due to other factors, such as the complexity of the patient's clinical course.\r"

No lectins were bound specifically to adrenocortical cells. Binding of RCA-I was observed in some carcinoma cells focally but not in benign counterparts. With WGA and Con A, the cytoplasmic binding became apparent in the cells manifesting hypercorticism. In adrenocortical carcinoma, various WGA and Con A binding patterns were intermingled, but no specific patterns were identified. The focal nature of RCA-I binding, and no specific WGA and Con A binding properties in carcinoma, suggest that diagnosis of malignant neoplasm must still largely rely on clinical, hormonal, and structural criteria in adrenocortical neoplasms.\r"

  ".W": "In order to further define the pathobiologic changes that occur in Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) and Graves' disease (GD), 47 cases of these conditions and six of nodular thyroid hyperplasia were studied. Antibodies to cytokeratin, vimentin, LN-2 (a B-lymphocyte marker), UCHL-1 (a T-lymphocyte marker), and HLA-DR, and biotinylated Helix pomatia (Roman snail) lectin, were applied to paraffin sections using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method. Cytokeratin was not expressed in resting epithelium or nodular hyperplasia, but was strongly displayed by injured (HT) or diffusely hyperplastic (GD) glandular tissue. Vimentin was present throughout the cytoplasm of proliferating thyrocytes but was limited to basal portions of resting cells and those of nodular hyperplasia. HLA-DR was observed in injured and hyperplastic thyroid tissue, as was N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosamine, the target of H pomatia lectin. UCHL-1-labeled infiltrating lymphocytes were observed in both HT and GD, in areas with minimal epithelial changes, while LN-2 was observed only in association with well-formed lymphoid follicles. These findings suggest that T cells are implicated in the mechanism of both conditions, but that inflammation is not the initiating event for HT and GD; and that a \"switch\" in intermediate filament synthesis accompanies HLA-DR and N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosamine expression by thyroid epithelium. Since current theories implicate intermediate filaments as intracellular mediators, we hypothesize that certain cytokeratins may be associated with gene activity governing the expression of class II histocompatibility antigens and other membrane glycoproteins in HT and GD.\r"

By light microscopy, highly cellular areas of the tumor typical of medulloblastoma showed evidence of both glial and neuroblastic differentiation. The tumor also contained foci of mature and immature cartilage. Transitions were observed between the cartilaginous foci and the more densely cellular regions of the tumor. No frankly teratomatous features or mesenchymal components other than cartilage were present. We postulate that the production of cartilage within this neoplasm most likely resulted from the metaplastic transformation of preexisting mesenchymal elements within the tumor or from multipotential neural crest-derived ectomesenchymal cells. Alternatively, the cartilage could have been produced directly by the neuroectodermal cells themselves, possibly related to a capacity for the latter to produce a chondroid ground substance.\r"

Although she presented with features mimicking sepsis, biochemical analysis, ie, a spuriously high carbon dioxide content, suggested salicylate intoxication (admission salicylate concentration, 5.13 mmol/L). She died on the third day after admission. Autopsy showed no major source of infection except for bronchopneumonia. Long-term users of a high-dose aspirin are at risk for potential salicylate intoxication. The metabolism of salicylate, particularly its excretion kinetics, can make small upward dosage adjustments hazardous. Salicylate has widespread metabolic effects that can mimic other medical conditions, leading to delayed diagnosis of salicylate intoxication. Increased mortality and morbidity may result.\r"

  ".W": "Recent trends indicate that pathology is becoming a less attractive specialty to US medical graduates. This article discusses role models as an important but underutilized tool in medical education, and pathology education, in particular. Historically, the term role model has been used to describe a hero or a good teacher. Social scientists who study specialty choices in medicine, however, consider role model to be a much more heterogeneous concept. The information gained from these studies, therefore, needs to be sorted out carefully if erroneous conclusions about role models are to be avoided. For example, personality traits and attitudinal assessment studies encourage, unfortunately, either a totally passive stance toward recruitment, or a selective approach to those students who fit the specialty profile. However, there is no available evidence to support such approaches in pathology. Indeed, faculty role models have consistently been found to be influential recruiters into specialties that are not well known to the students (eg, pathology). Many different types of role models are present in pathology. Two important types are clinical consultants and physician-researchers. Positive faculty role models are an effective way to remove false impressions and negative assumptions about the practice of pathology, and they should be used more explicitly in recruiting efforts.\r"

Only etoposide potentiated rhTNF cytotoxicity; no increase in host toxicity was noted. Variably enhanced toxic side effects were seen with other combinations.

Healing of the initial injury was complicated in 70% of patients. Mean interval from initial injury to diagnosis of SCC was 37 years. The overwhelming majority of patients presented with a chronic intractable ulcer in previously injured skin. The regional relapse rate after surgical excision was very high, 58% of all patients. Predominant patterns of recurrence were in local skin and regional lymph nodes (93% of recurrences). Survival rates at 5, 10, and 20 years were 52%, 34%, and 23%, respectively. Five-year survival rates in previously burned and irradiated patients were not significantly different (53% and 50%, respectively). This review, one of the largest reported series, better defines SCC arising in previously burned or irradiated skin as a locally aggressive disease that is distinct from SCC arising in sunlight-damaged skin. An increased awareness of the significance of chronic ulceration in scar tissue may allow earlier diagnosis. Regional disease control and survival depend on surgical resection of all known disease and may require radical lymph node dissection or amputation.\r"

Local recurrence was six times more frequent in the NS group at three-year follow-up (59% vs 10%).

Univariate analysis revealed that the number of metastatic lymph nodes, clinical tumor stage at presentation, clinical and pathologic response, and menopause status were significant variables associated with survival and disease-free survival, but clinical node stage at presentation and estrogen receptor status were not. The number of metastatic lymph nodes had more prognostic value than the other factors, and when evaluated by multivariate regression, surgical node staging added significantly more information to the remaining variables. Surgical staging is an important component of treatment for patients with breast cancer undergoing preoperative chemotherapy because it can provide an accurate and quantitative method for subgrouping patients with different survival rates and it can be used to compare results between preoperative chemotherapy trials.\r"

However, the frequency of nodal metastasis was similar when adjusted for size and grade.

  ".W": "\"Spontaneous\" lung metastases develop in over 50% of the animals bearing subcutaneous isografts of WB-2054, a rat colon carcinoma. A metastatic variant has been developed by \"Fidler\" type in vivo selection, yielding 100% lung metastasis. In a five-week assay to test the organ specificity of this lung metastatic variant, however, \"experimental\" liver and lung metastases could be induced in 100% and 60% of animals on portal venous and intravenous injections, respectively. The results demonstrate selection of a metastatic variant from heterogeneous primary tumor, and suggest at least two interacting mechanisms: (1) mechanical (the anatomy of the blood-borne metastatic pathways) and (2) biologic (factors intrinsic to primary tumor subpopulations that can be selected for metastatic proclivity). In addition, liver metastases were successfully established from colon tumors induced by cecal wall injection of tumor cells. Such a spontaneous liver metastasis model will be useful to study the specific mechanisms involved during metastasis of colon cancer to the liver.\r"

The primary tumor was located in the right and transverse colon in 11 patients, left and sigmoid colon in 16, and rectum in five. The carcinoembryonic antigen level was elevated in 30 patients (94%); all patients underwent a computed tomographic scan of the abdomen and pelvis. The overall sensitivity of the computed tomographic scan was 41% (abdomen other than liver, 27%; liver, 58%; and pelvis, 22%). The RIGS system identified recurrent tumor in 81% of the patients. The most common site of metastasis was the liver (41%), independent of the primary location. Local/regional recurrences alone accounted for 40% of all recurrences. In six patients (18%), recurrent tumor was found only with the RIGS system. The RIGS system is more dependable in localizing clinically obscure metastases than other methods, and carcinoembryonic antigen testing remains the most accurate preoperative method to indicate suspected recurrences.\r"

Specific attention was directed at detecting vena cava thrombus and metastatic bone disease, factors with a significant impact on the therapeutic approach. The findings support the role of CT as the principle tool for overall staging and the observation that venacavography is not indicated if CT has excluded caval thrombus. Similarly, routine bone scans are not warranted in the absence of an elevated alkaline phosphatase level or bone pain. The key to the more efficient utilization of imaging resources is understanding the capabilities of the technology available.\r"

Patients underwent endoscopy again two to three days and one month after PDT and as needed when symptoms recurred. At one month, the average minimal diameter opening of 28 assessable tumors increased from 6 to 9 mm. Of the 35 patients who could be evaluated one month after PDT, the average improvement in food intake was from a liquid to a soft diet. Average survival time (from time of first treatment) was 7.7 months (n = 17) for adenocarcinoma, 5.8 months (n = 12) for squamous cell carcinoma, and 25 months (n = 2) for melanoma. Two patients with stage I adenocarcinoma were alive with no evidence of disease at 11 and 23 months. One patient with stage I squamous cell cancer died 18 months after PDT, with recurrence of tumor above the treated area noted eight months after treatment. One patient with stage I melanoma died of a synchronous colon cancer 31 months after PDT, with no evidence of residual melanoma.\r"

Despite the diversity of the NK target repertoire, it is typified by cells of relatively immature phenotype. The purpose of this study was to determine if colorectal carcinoma (CRC) targets were sensitive to spontaneous lysis by fresh human NK effector cells and to observe the role of CRC differentiation in this process. Results demonstrated that poorly differentiated CRC targets were susceptible to NK-mediated lysis whereas CRC targets with more differentiated structure were NK resistant. In addition, chemical induction of a more mature CRC phenotype confers NK resistance on a previously NK-susceptible target. This maturation-related modulation of NK sensitivity can provide a model with which to further study interaction between NK cells and CRC targets.\r"

Using a sensitive bioassay, we attempted to detect circulating cachectin activity in the serum of sarcoma-bearing rats and to correlate levels with measurements of cachexia and the extent of disease. In addition, we resected the tumor to determine the time course of reversal of cachexia and the disappearance of cachectin activity in the serum. Circulating cachectin activity was not detectable in the serum of non-tumor-bearing rats or in tumor-bearing rats until 28 days after implantation. With evidence of food intake and body weight decline, cachectin activity became detectable in the serum and levels increased as cachexia and tumor burden increased. Serum cachectin activity levels correlated directly with tumor burden and inversely with food intake and body weight change. After resection of the tumor, food intake and body weight increased and serum cachectin activity became undetectable. Serum triglyceride levels were higher in cachectic tumor-bearing rats than in pair-fed non-tumor-bearing controls, and levels decreased after tumor resection as cachectin activity decreased. The results suggest that cachectin is a humoral mediator of cachexia in this rat-tumor model.\r"

Lewy body-like intraneuronal hyaline inclusions, which ultrastructurally showed irregular accumulations of trilaminar membranous profiles, were detected in the spinal anterior horn, Clarke's dorsal nucleus, facial nerve nucleus, inferior olivary nucleus, and substantia nigra. This case could be considered as a unique form in the group of the infantile motor neuron diseases associated with multi-systemic degenerations in the central nervous system.\r"

To test this hypothesis, extensive neuropsychological tests were administered to 50 consecutive normotensive, middle-aged, healthy volunteers. Ten subjects (20%) had white-matter changes on magnetic resonance scans; 40 subjects (80%) had normal scans. The differences observed on neuropsychological testing between subjects with and without leukoaraiosis were not significant. While this study argues against a link between leukoaraiosis and dementia, prospective longitudinal studies are needed to determine the value of leukoaraiosis in predicting future cognitive decline.\r"

In comparison with age-matched control subjects, compartmental analysis of NE kinetics revealed an increased NE release rate into the extravascular compartment and decreases in NE clearance and volume of distribution of NE in the intravascular compartment. Clonidine therapy was associated with an initial dramatic decrease in the frequency of diaphoretic episodes as well as with a fall in NE release rate and increases in NE clearance and volume of distribution. We conclude that increased NE release and decreased plasma NE clearance result in elevated plasma NE levels in Shapiro's syndrome. Clonidine, which was associated with changes in NE kinetics, may provide effective treatment for this disorder.\r"

Eighteen subjects were instructed to increase and then decrease the right patellar reflex by mental effort, without contracting any muscles. Most subjects increased the reflex in both conditions. Subsequently, ten subjects were instructed to increase the right patellar reflex and decrease the left by mental effort. Measurement showed reflex asymmetry in seven subjects consistent with the instruction. The experiment was repeated in another 20 subjects with symmetric reflexes at rest. Ten of these subjects were, after random assignment, instructed to increase either the right or the left knee jerk. All subjects (and an additional 15 asymmetric control subjects) were examined by a neurologist without knowledge of the instruction. Three of the ten instructed subjects were correctly judged to be asymmetric, but the agreement between instruction and neurologic judgment was not statistically significant. Mentally induced reflex asymmetry is possible, and may be clinically relevant in some cases.\r"

Of the episodes, 61% were in boys and 39% in girls, with an age range of 1 month to 14 years (average, 3.2 years). The majority of episodes (73%) occurred in patients who were less than 5 years old, with 61% less than 3 years old and 28% less than 1 year old. Status epilepticus as the initial seizure occurred in 71% of episodes. In patients under 1 year of age, 75% of episodes were associated with acute causes (bacterial meningitis in 28% and electrolyte disorders in 30%), and 23% were idiopathic (19% associated with fever). In children less than 3 years old, 47% of episodes had an acute cause, 9% had a previously known seizure disorder, and 32% were idiopathic (30% associated with fever). In patients older than 3 years, 28% of episodes were associated with acute causes, 38% were known epileptics, and 13% were idiopathic (11% had fever). Overall mortality was 6%, with 1% of all episodes ending in death during the presenting seizure. We conclude that the etiology of status epilepticus is age related, with acute causes being more common in patients with a younger age at presentation. When our data are compared with other large studies in children, it appears that mortality associated with status epilepticus has decreased.\r"

Pathologic alterations consisted of pseudolaminar necrosis involving the whole cerebral cortex and other forebrain regions, with relative preservation of brain stem and spinal cord. Close correspondence existed between electrophysiologic, clinical, and major neuropathologic alterations.\r"

At a dose of 1000 to 3000 microgram, a picture consistent with apparent macular infarction appeared on fundus examination and fluorescein angiography by three days and gradually faded by 21 days. While light and electron microscopic examination of the retina showed no primary vascular lesions, striking damage to the inner retinal layers, mainly the nerve fiber layer, ganglion cell layer, and the inner plexiform and nuclear layer, was seen. Less severe effects in the outer retinal layers and the retinal pigment epithelium occurred. These observations suggest that the neurotoxic effect of intravitreal gentamicin was sufficient to cause a complete shutdown of the regional blood flow, perhaps by the mechanism of granulocytic plugging of the capillary bed. Although this toxic effect occurred at doses considerably in excess of what has been recommended for clinical use in humans, the \"safe\" dose of intravitreal gentamicin, nevertheless, remains to be established unequivocally.\r"

Greene melanoma cells were used to produce 2- to 4-mm thick tumors posteriorly in the suprachoroidal space in pigmented rabbits. Endophotocoagulation delivered through a 600-micron fiberoptic probe was performed to ablate the tumor tissue and a surrounding margin of normal tissue. A vitreous cutter was used simultaneously to remove liberated necrotic debris. The effect of the laser on tumor and normal ocular tissue was evaluated by light microscopy and the extent of the proliferative response by tritiated thymidine radioautography. Application of 100 to 400 pulses of laser energy using treatment parameters of 12 to 14 W of power and 0.1-s pulses resulted in complete ablation of melanoma tissue, overlying retina, and choroid. There was no substantial intraoperative or postoperative hemorrhage. Material liberated during the laser treatment was found to be nonviable. The effect of the laser on tissue appeared localized to within approximately 1.25 mm of the margin of the central lesion. The high-energy argon laser seems to offer a means of effectively ablating melanoma tissue via an internal resection approach.\r"

Four-millimeter-round buttons of eye wall containing RPE, choroid, and sclera were treated with 25 spots from the argon blue-green laser using 300 mW of power, a 500-micron spot size, and 0.1-s duration. Laser photocoagulation disrupts individual RPE cells acutely and lifts damaged RPE cells from Bruch's membrane. Treated areas become covered with irregular mounds of RPE cells within seven days. The acute damage and subsequent repair of the RPE in organ culture mimic the response of the RPE following laser photocoagulation in vivo. Thus, the morphologic response of the RPE to laser photocoagulation is an intrinsic property of this tissue that does not depend on the presence of the overlying retina.\r"

Collagen type V was detected both in striated collagen fibrils and in vascular and astrocyte basement membranes.

Electroretinograms and pattern-reversal visual-evoked potentials recorded from the four eyes with chorioretinitis were attenuated and degraded. Two of the children had been misdiagnosed as having congenital toxoplasmosis. Chorioretinal scars probably occur more frequently with the congenital varicella syndrome than has been previously recognized and should be included in the differential diagnosis of congenital chorioretinal scars. Hypoplasia of the optic disc may develop after an intrauterine varicella infection during the 16th week of gestation. Children with the congenital varicella syndrome should be examined by an ophthalmologist to exclude ocular abnormalities. These abnormalities are often subtle and difficult to diagnose correctly.\r"

This chemoattractant activity is primarily chemotactic. It consists of heat-stable and heat-labile components.

In a prospective, randomized, masked study of 79 consecutive cataract extractions with intraocular lens implantations, 40 patients received retrobulbar injections and 39 patients received periocular injections. In every instance, the volume of the injection was 5 mL. No significant difference in surgeon's assessment of akinesia and anesthesia was found. Supplemental anesthesia was required in eight (21%) of the patients who received retrobulbar injections and in 11 (28%) of the patients who received periocular injections. A significant increase in chemosis was found with periocular injections. There was one complication with retrobulbar anesthesia and none with periocular anesthesia. No significant difference in patient assessment of comfort was found. The efficacy of periocular anesthesia appears to be comparable to that of retrobulbar anesthesia.\r"

Degenerative changes in anterior pigment cells and iris stromal atrophy were thought to be late secondary features of microcoria. The findings suggest that congenital microcoria results from a defect of intermediate filaments in the terminal fetal stages of differentiation of the anterior pigmented epithelial cell of the iris, with absence of myofilaments and consequent failure of development of a functional dilator pupil muscle.\r"

We describe a liquid culture system that supports the proliferation and maturation of human erythroid progenitors. We seeded mononuclear cells from the peripheral blood (PB) of patients with beta-thalassemia in liquid medium in the presence of conditioned medium from human bladder carcinoma cells. Seven days later, RBCs, normoblasts, granulocytes, and monocytes disappeared, and the number of lymphocytes dropped considerably. In contrast, erythroid colony-forming cells increased fourfold to tenfold. The next step entailed the removal of colony-stimulating factor (CSF) and CSF-secreting cells, the exclusion of macrophages by harvesting nonadherent cells, and the lysis of T lymphocytes by treatment with monoclonal rat antihuman lymphocyte antibodies (CAMPATH-1) and complement. Reculture of the remaining cells in liquid medium supplemented with recombinant erythropoietin (EPO) resulted in the exclusive development of erythroid cells, with myeloid cells reduced to less than 2%. Stainable hemoglobin (Hb) appeared on day 3, with over 85% of the population containing hemoglobin by day 11 and the cell number increasing from 0.2 X 10(6) to 3 X 10(6) mL. By permitting the manipulation of culture conditions and components and increasing the cell yield, the liquid system may facilitate quantitative analysis of growth kinetics as well as biochemical and immunologic characterization of the developing erythroid cell.\r"

  ".W": "The adhesive glycoprotein fibronectin provides anchorage for fibroblasts and hematopoietic progenitor cells in vitro. Fibronectin also demonstrates growth factor activity for fibroblasts; however, there is no available information regarding its role as a hematopoietic growth factor. To distinguish growth factor activity of fibronectin from its anchorage activity for hematopoietic progenitors, we assessed the ability of purified human plasma fibronectin to promote human bone marrow erythroid, granulocyte-macrophage (GM) and mixed granulocyte-erythroid-macrophage-megakaryocyte (GEMM) colony formation in liquid suspension, methylcellulose, and fibrin clots under serum-free conditions. Addition of fibronectin to methylcellulose cultures, or to cultures formed in fibrin clots, using fibrinogen depleted of fibronectin by preadsorption over gelatin-Sepharose and clotted with thrombin, resulted in up to a twofold enhancement of proliferation of erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E), erythroid colony-forming units (CFU-E), and CFU-GEMM. This effect was concentration-dependent up to a fibronectin supplement of 100 micrograms/mL. By contrast, CFU-GM proliferation was not affected by the addition of fibronectin to the cultures. Fibronectin-adherent marrow cells overlaid with liquid medium formed both early and late-appearing erythroid colonies, whereas similarly cultured plastic-adherent marrow cells did not. Erythroid colony formation was observed in cultures of fibronectin-adherent marrow cells overlaid with methylcellulose but not in cultures of plastic-adherent marrow cells under the same conditions. Finally, the erythroid growth-promoting activity of fibronectin was inhibited by arginyl-glycyl-aspartyl-serine (RGDS), a tetrapeptide that competitively blocks the interaction of fibronectin with its receptor. We conclude that fibronectin plays a dual role in hematopoiesis: providing (a) anchorage for erythroid and primitive progenitors, and (b) as a proliferative stimulus for these hematopoietic cells. Both activities may be mediated by the cell adhesion domain of the molecule.\r"

  ".W": "Erythropoietin, a plasma glycoprotein produced primarily by the kidney, is a growth and differentiation factor for erythroid progenitor cells. Production of renal erythropoietin is regulated by modulation of mRNA levels in response to changes in tissue oxygenation. Exposure to cobalt, a nonphysiologic stimulus for erythropoietin production, also acts by inducing mRNA accumulation. To determine whether variations in erythropoietin mRNA levels result from enhanced transcription of the erythropoietin gene, in vitro transcription reactions were performed using isolated rat kidney cell nuclei. Quantitation of specific nuclear RNAs labeled during in vitro transcription revealed active erythropoietin gene transcription in kidney nuclei from anemic-hypoxic and cobalt-treated animals while erythropoietin transcriptional activity was undetectable in normal kidney nuclei. Time course studies showed that stimulation of transcription begins between two and four hours following cobalt treatment and parallels the kinetics of mRNA and plasma erythropoietin accumulation. These results indicate that tissue hypoxia and cobalt exposure specifically enhance erythropoietin gene expression. This increase in erythropoietin production is regulated at least in part at the level of gene transcription.\r"

Using the inducible promyelocytic cell line HL-60 as a model, we studied the mRNA expression of these genes. Differentiation of these cells along both a monocytic and a granulocytic pathway demonstrated that the mRNA levels of the two subunits of CD11b/CD18 increased in a pattern temporally and quantitatively similar to the increase in cell surface expression of this heterodimer. In contrast, the expression of MPO mRNA decreased in a temporal and quantitative pattern similar to the known decrease in MPO protein during differentiation, suggesting that regulation of these myeloid-specific proteins may occur at the level of mRNA expression. These findings have important implications with regard to the nature of the block in differentiation in acute nonlymphocytic leukemia and the regulation of myeloid gene expression.\r"

Adhesion to glass slides coated with fibronectin, collagen, fibrinogen, or plasma proteins was studied by perfusing platelet-rich plasma through a flow chamber that allowed time- and space-resolved observations of platelet adhesion. Platelet adherence was measured in an area of parallel flow lines and low shear rate under standardized conditions before and after dietary supplementation with vitamin E at doses of 200 and 400 IU/d. Platelet adherence differed in magnitude depending on the adhesive surface. There was a distinct preference of platelets to adhere to sites that had been previously occupied. A remarkable decrease in platelet adherence was observed after vitamin E supplementation. The average decrease in adhesion after 2 weeks of 200 IU vitamin E was 75%. After 2 weeks of 400 IU vitamin E, platelet adhesion was reduced by 82%. The inhibitory activity of alpha-tocopherol was dose dependent and correlated well with the increase in alpha-tocopherol concentration in platelets after supplementation. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a striking decrease of pseudopodium formation in alpha-tocopherol-enriched platelets. Our results suggest that vitamin E may also be an effective antiadhesive agent in vivo.\r"

  ".U": "89088517\r", 
  ".W": "The exposure of fibrinogen receptors is an early event in agonist-induced platelet activation. Previous measurements of fibrinogen binding or aggregation in platelet-rich plasma or washed platelets have failed to define whether the initial response to epinephrine results solely from a direct effect of this agonist. To address this problem, we have measured fibrinogen receptor exposure on platelets in whole blood by using flow cytometry and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled monoclonal antibody specific for the activated fibrinogen receptor (FITC-PAC1). We also measured platelet-bound fibrinogen with an antifibrinogen monoclonal antibody (FITC-9F9) as well as platelet aggregation in whole blood. In blood anticoagulated with citrate and in the presence of a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, epinephrine (0.1 to 100 mumol/L) caused significant FITC-PAC1 binding (P less than .001) that was maximal at 10 mumol/L epinephrine. The maximal epinephrine response was one third of that observed with 10 mumol/L adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and was eliminated by yohimbine, an alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist. Incubation of the blood with apyrase or phosphoenolpyruvate plus pyruvate kinase to remove extracellular ADP resulted in a 40% to 50% reduction in the epinephrine response. Despite this, FITC-PAC1 binding was still significant at epinephrine greater than or equal to 1 mumol/L (P less than .05). No reduction in epinephrine-induced FITC-PAC1 binding was observed in the presence of ATP alpha S, an ADP receptor antagonist; cinanserin, a serotonin antagonist; or WEB-2086, a platelet activating factor antagonist. Furthermore, addition of the thrombin inhibitors hirudin or leupeptin to citrated blood had no effect on the extent of the epinephrine response. Blood anticoagulated with hirudin also demonstrated an epinephrine response, even in the presence of apyrase. Similar results were obtained when FITC-9F9 was used to detect fibrinogen binding or when aggregation was assessed by a decrease in the number of single platelets. We conclude that epinephrine itself can induce fibrinogen receptor exposure, fibrinogen binding, and aggregation. This primary response is independent of synergistic interaction of epinephrine with traces of ADP, serotonin, platelet activating factor, or thrombin. However, such synergistic interaction with ADP present in whole blood may enhance the responses induced by epinephrine.\r"

Both surface expressed TM (antigen and activity), and the total TM pool (measured by radioimmunoassay and activity in detergent extracts) dropped to less than or equal to 20% of control values within 12 hours of TNF treatment. TM was not found in an immunologically recognizable form in the supernatants of treated cultures. Chloroquine (greater than or equal to 100 mumol/L) was able to abrogate the TNF effect on the total TM pool but not the effect on surface-expressed TM activity. We conclude that TNF induces the internalization and subsequent degradation of the TM molecule. None of the components of the protein C anticoagulant pathway, either alone or in combination, prevented the TNF-dependent downregulation of TM antigen.\r"

HBV DNA sequences were detected by dot-blot hybridization in 68 of 793 subjects (9%) with abnormal ALT but only in three of 618 subjects (0.5%) with normal ALT. HBV-core antibody (anti-HBc) was detected in 338 of 793 subjects (43%) with abnormal ALT as well as in 125 of 618 subjects (20.2%) with normal ALT. Among the 71 subjects positive for serum HBV DNA, 22 (31%) were positive for anti-HBc, while 49 (69%) were negative for all serologic markers of HBV infection. Thus, a high frequency of anti-HBc in apparently healthy HBsAg-negative individuals and a high prevalence of serum HBV DNA in the absence of immunologic markers of HBV infection suggest the existence of genetic variants of HBV that may be responsible for some of the presumed NANB hepatitis encountered in Sardinia and possibly other areas of high endemicity for HBV.\r"

Whether these defects result from abnormalities in plasma factors affecting platelet activity, platelet surface receptors, intracellular platelet mediators, or other aspects of platelet behavior is unknown. To examine the possibility that the abnormality in platelet function may result from aberrations in Ca2+ homeostasis, blood was obtained from 29 patients with severe uremia. The platelets were washed, loaded with the Ca2+ -sensitive probes indo-1 and aequorin, gel-filtered, and resuspended in either plasma or buffer. Of the 29 patients, seven had template bleeding times prolonged to 11 minutes or more, but platelet aggregation in plasma was not consistently impaired in these patients. However, in aequorin-loaded platelets from the patients with long bleeding times, the highest elevation of cytoplasmic calcium [( Ca2+]i) in response to the Ca2+ ionophore A23187, arachidonate, adenosine diphosphate (ADP), or epinephrine was lower than that seen in platelets from both uremic patients with less prolonged bleeding times and normal volunteers. The reduced [Ca2+]i response was associated with decreased aggregation of gel-filtered platelets suspended in buffer. Suspending washed aequorin-loaded uremic platelets in normal plasma for 20 minutes did not reverse the decreased agonist-induced rise in [Ca2+]i; platelets from a normal donor resuspended in uremic plasma aggregated and produced a normal increase in [Ca2+]i in response to agonists. We conclude that the platelet defect seen in some patients with uremia is associated with a decreased rise in platelet [Ca2+]i after stimulation and that this is a manifestation of an intrinsic platelet defect.\r"

There was a single class of heparin binding sites, with an apparent dissociation constant of 0.19 mumol/L and 1.9 x 10(6) sites per cell. The binding was not dependent on the anticoagulant property of heparin. Analysis of surface-iodinated cell lysates by heparin affinity chromatography revealed a major 120 Kd cell surface heparin-binding protein. Histidine-rich glycoprotein, a potent heparin antagonist found in human plasma and platelets, decreased the affinity of heparin for cell binding. Cell surface bound heparin was functionally active and markedly accelerated the inactivation of thrombin by antithrombin III. Heparin induced the release of two monocyte secretory proteins of 160 and 17 Kd. Our study supports the thesis that heparin and related glycosaminoglycans interact with monocytes and macrophages, as well as endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, and play an important and complex role in blood vessel wall biology.\r"

Incubation of factor V with plasmin resulted in a rapid increase in procoagulant activity, followed by a subsequent decline in the ability of factor V to serve as a cofactor in the prothrombinase complex. Identical results were obtained when these reactions were conducted in the presence of dansylarginine-N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl) amide (DAPA), indicating that the changes observed could not have occurred as a consequence of cleavage by alpha-thrombin. Analysis of the products of the reaction by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) revealed a temporal correlation between the rise and fall in factor V activity and the presence of several transient intermediates. These fragments are distinct from the subunits of alpha-thrombin-activated factor V (factor Va). The activation phase of the reaction was not significantly affected by the presence of phospholipid. In contrast, the rate of degradation of active fragments of factor V and the accompanying loss of activity were markedly enhanced in the presence of phospholipid vesicles. These data suggest that the action of plasmin upon factor V results in the transient formation of proteolytic fragments which express significant procoagulant activity.\r"

The effects of this heparin-neutralizing protein on the interaction between antithrombin III and cultured porcine aortic endothelial cells were examined. Displacement of 125I-labeled antithrombin III specifically bound to endothelial cells by unlabeled histidine-rich glycoprotein was much less potent than that by unlabeled antithrombin III. One hundred-fold molar excess of histidine-rich glycoprotein displaced specific 125I-antithrombin III binding only by 20%. Furthermore, the endothelial cell-mediated acceleration of thrombin inactivation by antithrombin III was diminished by protamine sulfate, but was not affected by histidine-rich glycoprotein even at a histidine-rich glycoprotein/antithrombin III molar ratio of approximately 7:1. These data indicate that histidine-rich glycoprotein does not interfere with the interaction of endothelial cell heparin-like compounds with antithrombin III. Thus, it may not play an important role in the modulation of anticoagulant activity of endothelial cells in vivo, suggesting that the commonly accepted view of the probable function of this protein is erroneous.\r"

Five of these antibodies (Abs) reacted with normal erythroid, but not myeloid, bone marrow cells. Each of the five antibodies, typified by Ab 69.20, immunoprecipitated a dimeric complex of 185,000, which is composed of two identical disulfide-bonded subunits. This antigen had affinity for transferrin, and was essentially identical in biochemical characteristics to transferrin receptors precipitated with the well-characterized MoAbs OKT9 and 5E9. However, this form of transferrin receptor lacked both the OKT9 and 5E9 antigenic determinants and, moreover, the 69.20 epitope was absent from the conventional transferrin receptor, as defined by Abs OKT9 and 5E9. Modulation experiments demonstrated that both 69.20 and OKT9 modulated large, virtually independent populations of transferrin receptors. Both forms of transferrin receptor appeared to be derived from the product of a single gene, but the form defined by MoAb 69.20 apparently predominates in cells of the erythroid lineage and some transformed cell types that manifest a special requirement for iron. These data suggest that cells with a high iron requirement synthesize two forms of transferrin receptor, possibly by means of differential mRNA splicing or by posttranslational modification of the transferrin receptor.\r"

  ".W": "This study describes a simple and relatively rapid method of purifying Reed-Sternberg (R-S) cells and their morphologic variants from the lymph nodes of patients affected by Hodgkin's disease. Our initial studies defined the optimal procedure for a quantitative disaggregation of Hodgkin's lymph nodes and the densities of R-S cells in several donors. These preliminary steps were helpful in the development of strategies for selectively concentrating R-S cells by density gradient centrifugation. We layered a single-cell suspension over Percoll of appropriate density, centrifuged these samples for 15 minutes, and collected a fraction enriched in R-S cells. Most of the R-S cells were distributed between densities of 1.060 and 1.072, with a peak at approximately 1.066 g/mL. R-S cells are denser than many mononuclear cells present in the lymph nodes of Hodgkin's patients and lighter than reactive cells such as eosinophils, mast cells, and neutrophils. However, the ranges of densities of these cell types overlap, making purification of R-S cells by isopyknic centrifugation impossible. Nevertheless, when this enriched fraction is further processed by velocity sedimentation in order to take advantage of the larger size of R-S cells as compared with all other cells, a substantial purification is achieved. We used three different velocity-sedimentation chambers to find the optimal conditions for obtaining the highest purity with a high final yield. The cells isolated by this method are viable, appear to be morphologically normal, and have been further characterized biologically.\r"

  ".W": "The involvement of the erythropoietin (EPO), plasminogen activator inhibitor type I (PAI1), and multi-drug resistance (MDR2) genes located in chromosomal region 7q21-22 was studied in patients with myeloid disorders and with or without a chromosome 7 abnormality. Separated blood mononuclear cells and granulocytes from 21 patients were used in restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) studies with gene-specific DNA probes. A marked weakness of one of the allelic bands was observed in granulocyte-derived DNA from heterozygous patients with monosomy 7. In four patients with a partial deletion of chromosome 7 long arm (7q-), marked weakness of an allelic band was observed in granulocyte-derived DNA with PAI1 probe (four heterozygous patients) and MDR2 probe (one heterozygous patient), implying deletion of these genes. In contrast, the EPO gene was not deleted in these patients, as demonstrated by the presence of two allelic bands of equal strength in granulocyte-derived DNA (two patients) or by gene dosage estimation (two patients). Two allelic bands of equal strength were also observed in three heterozygous patients with an arbitrary probe (pKV13) located in 7cen-q21.3. Unexpected hemizygosity or hybridization bands were not observed in any patient. We conclude that PAI1 and MDR2 are located distally of EPO in 7q22, and that none of these genes is commonly rearranged in myeloid disorders. The chromosome 7 long arm deletion breakpoint is located in a relatively narrow segment between the PAI1 and EPO genes in different patients. The deletion may involve a specific site in DNA, since the genetic distance between the PAI1 and EPO genes is only 3 cM.\r"

Seven of the 15 (47%) possessed a frankly elevated serum concentration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)2-D]. An additional patient with severe hypercalcemia (16.2 mg/dL) had a serum 1,25-(OH)2-D concentration in the midnormal range, not a suppressed value. To examine the potential existence of hypercalciuria in absence of overt hypercalcemia, prospective screening of 23 normocalcemic patients with lymphoma was undertaken. Four of the 23 patients (17%) had increased fractional urinary calcium excretion rates (0.35 +/- 0.3 mg calcium/100 mL glomerular filtrate [GF], mean +/- SE; normal, less than 0.16 mg/100 mL GF); two of the hypercalciuric patients had a frankly elevated serum 1,25-(OH)2-D concentration. Of the 19 hypercalcemic/hypercalciuric lymphoma patients identified, none had an elevated serum immunoreactive parathyroid hormone concentration. Fourteen of the 19 hypercalcemic/hypercalciuric patients (74%) suffered from B-cell neoplasms, three had Hodgkin's lymphoma, and two had adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. All hypercalcemic/hypercalciuric patients had widespread disease (stage III or IV). Six patients, four with hypercalcemia and two with hypercalciuria, had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). These data suggest that the deregulated synthesis of a 1,25-(OH)2-D-like metabolite is a common cause of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria in patients with lymphoma including patients with AIDS-associated tumors.\r"

The relationship between in vivo leukemic cell growth, intracellular ara-C metabolism, and clinical response to ara-C-containing TST was evaluated by comparing AML marrow cell growth kinetic and biochemical pharmacologic determinants obtained before therapy (day 0) and at the predicted peak of in vivo postdrug residual tumor proliferation (day 8). Serial measurements of DNA synthesis and net intracellular ara-C metabolism demonstrated marked increases in both determinants in day 8 residual tumor when compared with the pretreatment cells for newly diagnosed adults achieving complete remission but not for TST-refractory patients. The interrelationship of AML cell proliferation and biochemical pharmacology together quantitate cytotoxicity measured by both achievement and duration of remission and serve to predict eventual clinical outcome in response to TST with ara-C where both growth and favorable pharmacokinetics are intrinsic to the success of the drug schedule.\r"

The relationship between the level of gene expression and the clinical characteristics of the disease and response to therapy was studied. The levels of expression of c-myc and c-myb are weakly correlated and are unrelated to French-American-British (FAB) type of ANLL. The levels of expression of c-fms, c-fes, and c-fos are highly correlated with each other and are highest in leukemia with a monocytic component (c-fms v FAB = .71, c-fes v FAB = .75). High levels of c-myc expression are associated with a high probability of not responding to remission induction therapy (P = .004). The converse is true for c-fms expression levels. High levels of expression of c-myc or c-myb are associated with short remissions (P = .059 and .065, respectively), perhaps because they are associated with a high capacity for leukemic cell self-renewal and/or an inability of leukemic cells to differentiate in response to chemotherapy.\r"

One hundred ninety-two patients received induction therapy with daunorubicin and cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) with an overall complete response rate (CR) of 63%. Responding patients received repetitive cycles of Ara-C-based intensification therapy. Clonal abnormalities were detected in 69% of the patients with specimens adequate for cytogenetic analysis. Certain cytogenetic changes were closely associated with French-American-British (FAB) morphology, age, and outcome: t(8;21) (closely associated with FAB M2), t(15;17) (associated with FAB M3), and abn 16q22 (associated with FAB M4EOS) tended to occur in younger patients and were associated with favorable outcomes in terms of both CR rate and long-term disease-free survival. In contrast, 19% of patients who had -5/5q- and or -7/7q- and seven patients with trisomy 8 were older, had a poor prognosis, and usually failed to achieve remission (CR) because of chemotherapy-resistant leukemia. The adverse effect on CR rate and duration in this group of patients was independent of age, and there was no association with particular morphologic subtypes. These data suggest that cytogenetic findings should influence future therapeutic choices. In particular, patients with abnormalities associated with poor responses may be considered for investigational approaches and may also provide insights into mechanisms of drug resistance.\r"

Clonal chromosomal abnormalities were found in marrow blasts from 77 of 104 (74%) cases. Hyperdiploidy was much more frequent in B-lineage ALL cases, whereas normal diploidy was more common in T-lineage ALL cases. Fifty-nine of 104 cases (46 of 78 B-lineage ALL and 13 of 26 T-lineage ALL cases) had structural chromosomal abnormalities. Structural abnormalities involving 2p11, 7p13, 7p22, proximal q arm of 7 (7q11 or 7q22), 11q23-24, and translocations involving 12p11-13 appeared to be B-lineage specific. By comparison, structural abnormalities involving 7p15, 7q32, and 14q11 displayed T-lineage specificity. Structural abnormalities involving 9p22-p23 or 14q32, del (6)(q21-q23), del (12)(p11-p13), and the Philadelphia chromosome were found in B-lineage as well as T-lineage ALL cases. This study expands the current knowledge about immunophenotype-karyotype associations in ALL.\r"

The DNA blot hybridization pattern was consistent with a single-copy gene.

COS cells transfected with the CD14 cDNA released virtually all CD14 protein in soluble form following treatment with glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, and CD14 immunoreactivity was absent from the affected monocytes of a patient with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).

  ".W": "Activation of the respiratory burst oxidase in cell-free preparations from 32P-labeled neutrophils was compared with changes in levels of radioactively labeled phosphoinositides in the same preparations. With membrane particles, treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in the presence of cytosol led to activation of the oxidase without an alteration in levels of labeled phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) or phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PIP). Conversely, solubilization of the membrane particles with deoxycholate resulted in loss of nearly 98% of the radioactive PIP2 without activation of the oxidase. In this solubilized preparation, the oxidase could subsequently be fully activated by SDS in the presence of cytosol, even though the labeled PIP2 was almost totally depleted. Two PIP2-derived second messengers, diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, as well as the protein kinase C activator phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), failed to activate the oxidase. These results suggest that in a cell-free preparation from human neutrophils, detergent-mediated activation of the respiratory burst oxidase is independent of changes in the levels of phosphoinositides or phosphoinositide-derived second messengers.\r"

  ".W": "It has been shown that certain dogs have erythrocytes characterized by an inherited high concentration of reduced glutathione (GSH), five to seven times the normal level (high-GSH RBCs). We examined whether increased GSH in dog erythrocytes leads to increased protection against oxidative damage induced by acetylphenylhydrazine (APH) and/or 4-aminophenyl disulfide (4-AD). When erythrocytes were incubated with 30 mmol/L APH, the Heinz body count was appreciably higher in normal RBCs than in high-GSH RBCs, while there was no difference in the increase of the methemoglobin (metHb) concentration in both RBCs. In contrast, both the Heinz body count and metHb production were much higher in high-GSH RBCs than in normal RBCs when erythrocytes were incubated with 4-AD. Furthermore, the generation of the superoxide in erythrocytes treated with 4-AD, which was measured by spin trapping combined with electron spin resonance (ESR), was obviously higher in high-GSH RBCs than in normal RBCs. These results clearly indicate that erythrocyte GSH is an important defense against oxidative damage induced by certain compounds such as APH, but that, in contrast, elevated GSH appears to accelerate oxidative damage to erythrocytes produced by aromatic disulfides, such as 4-AD, which generated a superoxide in erythrocytes via its redox reaction with GSH.\r"

The hematocrit value was 41 to 45.8, the mean corpuscular volume was 61 fL, and the mean corpuscular hemoglobin was 18.9 pg. The HbF was 45% with a G gamma:A gamma ratio of 3:1. An acid elution preparation of the peripheral blood showed heterogeneous distribution of HbF, but all erythrocytes stained for fetal hemoglobin. The beta/alpha synthesis ratio in the peripheral blood was 0.25; the (beta + gamma)/alpha ratio was 0.55. Haplotype analysis revealed homozygosity for the -+-+ + + + pattern (Senegal, type IX) at seven polymorphic restriction sites within the beta-like gene complex. Digestion of DNA with Xmnl indicated that the -158 C-to-T transition was present in both beta-globin gene clusters. Oligomer hybridization analysis demonstrated homozygosity for the -29 A-to-G mutation in the beta-globin promoter region. Although this form of thalassemia can cause transfusion-requiring anemia, the high-HbF, high-G gamma phenotype associated with the linked +-+ + subhaplotype and -158 C-to-T substitution appears to have ameliorated the disease in this subject.\r"

Several mutations have been identified in either the A gamma or G gamma promoter which are considered causative to the continued production of one of the two gamma chains because the substitutions occur in sequence motifs essential for the expression characteristics of the gamma-globin gene in the 3' position. We report the discovery of a T----C mutation at position -175 in the A gamma promoter which was associated with a greatly increased level of Hb F (with mainly A gamma) and a decreased level of Hb A in the one (Black) heterozygote who had a beta c gene in trans. The same mutation has been observed in the G gamma promoter of a Black heterozygote who had high levels of Hb F with G gamma chains only. A detailed comparison between these two individuals indicated significant differences in the levels of Hb F and Hb A which may result from an additional mutation at position -158 in the G gamma promoter.\r"

Simultaneous exposure to the lipophilic dye MC 540 and white light inactivated cell-free virus, cell-associated virus, and virus-transformed cells. When used under experimental conditions that are known to preserve most mature blood cells, at least some coagulation factors, and a significant portion of the pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell compartment, MC 540-mediated photosensitization reduced virus titers by greater than or equal to 4 log and the concentration of in vitro clonogenic erythroleukemia cells by greater than or equal to 5 log. Animals that received a single intravenous injection of photosensitized virus were resistant to a subsequent challenge with live virus. High sensitivity to MC 540-mediated photosensitization appears to be a property that is shared by other enveloped viruses. Thus, photosensitization mediated by MC 540 may be of benefit in the sterilization of blood products (in particular, cellular products), the production of vaccines, and selected areas of antiviral therapy.\r"
