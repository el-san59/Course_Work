  ".W": "Forty-one patients seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) were assessed for cell-mediated cytotoxicity (CMC) against autologous target cells bearing the major envelope glycoprotein of HIV-1, gp120. Effector lymphocytes from over 85% of seropositive patients showed CMC specific for gp120-coated targets, whereas seronegative individuals had no detectable CMC. As a group, symptomless individuals had the highest levels of CMC; patients with AIDS-related complex and AIDS showed progressively diminished reactivity. The gp120-specific CMC was mediated by a population of non-T-cell effectors phenotypically resembling NK/K cells. Cytolysis was not restricted by major histocompatibility complex determinants, as shown by killing of heterologous gp120-adsorbed targets and of HIV-1-infected cell-lines. Gp120-specific CMC was highly augmented in the presence of interleukin 2, so it may be possible to develop therapeutic strategies aimed at destruction of virus-producing cell reservoirs in infected individuals through stimulation of HIV-specific host CMC.\r"

  ".W": "Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), which causes AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome), possesses an essential gene, tat, whose product, acting through the long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences of HIV-1, activates viral genes and replication. The mechanism by which tat trans-activates HIV genes is unclear. Some studies have reported that an increase in messenger RNA accumulation directed by the HIV-1 LTR can explain the action of tat, but others suggest that this increase in mRNA levels can only partially explain trans-activation, and that translational control mechanisms may also be involved. To test those possibilities we have established an efficient adenovirus system for delivering the HIV-1 LTR attached to a reporter gene (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; CAT) into cells and monitoring its activity. The HIV-1 LTR expressed from this adenovirus responds to trans-activation in a HeLa cell line constitutively expressing the tat protein by increasing the transcription rate of the HIV-1 LTR and the accumulation of mRNA encoding CAT. In this system the translational efficiency of this CAT mRNA in the cell is unaffected by the presence of tat.\r"

Studies in yeast, protozoa, slime moulds and flagellates show that telomeres are tandem repeats of simple sequences that have a G-rich and a C-rich strand. Mammalian telomeres have yet to be isolated and characterized, although a DNA fragment within 20 kilobases of the telomeres of the short arms of the human sex chromosomes has been isolated. Recently we showed that a chromosome from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe could, in some cases, replicate as an autonomous mini-chromosome in mouse cells. By extrapolation from other systems, we reasoned that mouse telomeres could be added to the S. pombe chromosome ends in the mouse cells. On setting out to test this hypothesis we found to our surprise that the telomeric probe used (containing both the S. pombe and Tetrahymena thermophila repeats) hybridized to a series of discrete fragments in normal mouse DNA and DNA from a wide range of eukaryotes. We show here that the sequences hybridizing to this probe are located at the telomeres of most, if not all, human chromosomes and are similar to the Tetrahymena telomeric-repeat component of the probe.\r"

FeLV isolates have been divided into three subgroups, based on the viral envelope-determined properties of interference and host range in vitro. FeLV-A is present in all natural isolates and is generally minimally pathogenic. FeLV-B is found with FeLV-A in isolates from approximately 40% of natural infections and in a higher percentage of cats with lymphoma. Following the fundamental observations of genetic reassortment of avian retroviruses with endogenous viral genes and the origination of lymphomagenic viruses during the ontogeny of AKR mice, we show here that transfection of feline cells with FeLV-A DNA results in its recombination with endogenous FeLV-related sequences to produce viruses with the structural and host range properties of FeLV-B. Thus in vitro propagation of a retrovirus may result in the generation of variants with very different properties.\r"

The discovery of linkage between HD and the DNA marker D4S10(G8) raised the possibility of isolating the disease gene on the basis of its chromosomal location, in addition to providing a limited presymptomatic test for the late onset disorder. But it has been difficult to isolate other DNA markers nearer to the HD gene, and this has hampered attempts to identify the disease locus and limited the applicability and accuracy of predictive testing. Recently, several new DNA markers from the region of the genome near the HD gene have been isolated using a directed cloning strategy. We describe here the characterization of one of these new markers, D4S95, a highly polymorphic locus which displays no recombination with the HD gene in the families tested. The high degree of polymorphism at this locus and its proximity to the HD gene make it extremely useful for predictive testing and as a new starting point for attempts to clone the disease gene.\r"

It is found in dividing cells of all mammals and amphibians tested, but not in quiescent cells. The protein shows a distinct granular distribution in the nucleus and is induced within four hours of serum stimulation of quiescent mouse fibroblasts. The p68 protein was first identified because of its specific immunological cross-reaction with the DNA tumour virus nuclear oncogene SV40 large T, detected with the anti-SV40 large T monoclonal antibody DL3C4, now renamed PAb204. Sequencing of human complementary DNA coding for the growth-regulated p68 nuclear protein has revealed the molecular basis for its cross-reaction with SV40 large T antigen and its extensive homology with the translation initiation factor eIF-4A. The sequence similarity between p68 and eIF-4A is interesting because eIF-4A acts as an ATP-dependent RNA helicase and T antigen is an ATP-dependent DNA helicase. We suggest that p68 could be a DNA or RNA helicase in the cell nucleus which is involved in replication, transcription or RNA processing and is required for cell growth.\r"

  ".W": "In humoral defence, pathogens are cleared by antibodies acting as adaptor molecules: they bind to antigen and trigger clearance mechanisms such as phagocytosis, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement lysis. The first step in the complement cascade is the binding of C1q to the antibody. There are six heads on C1q, connected by collagen-like stems to a central stalk, and the isolated heads bind to the Fc portion of antibody rather weakly, with an affinity of 100 microM (ref. 3). Binding of antibody to multiple epitopes on an antigenic surface, aggregates the antibody and this facilitates the binding of several C1q heads, leading to an enhanced affinity of about 10 nM (ref. 1). Within the Fc portion of the antibody, C1q binds to the CH2 domain. The interaction is sensitive to ionic strength, and appears to be highly conserved throughout evolution as C1q reacts with IgG from different species (for example see ref. 8). By systematically altering surface residues in the mouse IgG2b isotype, we have localized the binding site for C1q to three side chains, Glu 318, Lys 320 and Lys 322. These residues are relatively conserved in other antibody isotypes, and a peptide mimic of this sequence is able to inhibit complement lysis. We propose that this sequence motif forms a common core in the interactions of IgG and C1q.\r"

  ".W": "In the response of T cells to foreign antigens, the ligand for the T cell alpha/beta receptor is presented on a cell surface as a fragment of antigen complexed to one of the membrane molecules encoded in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The receptor apparently interacts via its variable elements (V beta, D beta, J beta, V alpha and J alpha) with residues within both the antigen and MHC portion of the ligand. The frequency of T cells responding to a conventional antigen plus self MHC is usually quite low, presumably reflecting the relative rarity of receptors with the particular combination of variable elements to match the antigen/MHC ligand. T cells also respond to allogeneic forms of MHC molecules in the absence of added antigen. In this case the frequency of responding T cells is very high. One hypothesis to explain this observation is that, in the absence of foreign antigen, MHC molecules are complexed to a large array of peptides derived from self-proteins. In this case the combination of the polymorphic MHC amino acid residues and many different self peptides presents so many possible ligands that the likelihood of recognition by a given T cell receptor is quite high. The recent crystallography experiments which revealed a dramatic binding cleft on the face of a human MHC molecule have given impetus to this view, but as yet there is no direct supporting evidence. We have recently described a close association between murine T cell receptors utilizing the V beta 17a element and reactivity to various allogeneic forms of the murine MHC molecule, I-E (ref. 8). In this paper, we show that this I-E ligand is detected on B cells, but not on I-E+ macrophages or fibroblasts expressing a transfected I-E gene. These results strongly suggest a B cell specific product combines with I-E to form the allogeneic ligand for V beta 17a+ receptors and thus support the concept of alloreactivity described above.\r"

  ".W": "Down-regulatory phenomena have been described in several experimental models of tissue-specific, T-cell-mediated autoimmunity. For example, resistance to active induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) can be induced by pretreating animals with non-pathogenic inocula of autoantigen or effector cells. Moreover, animals that have recovered from one EAE episode are resistant to subsequent induction of EAE. In some models, resistance to EAE has been transferred with immune cells to naive recipients. These experiments, which were based on transfers of unseparated immune cell populations, are difficult to interpret. Immune suppression circuits are known to be complex and involve various distinct cellular subsets. To further complicate the issue, resistance to EAE can be transferred not only by suppressor cells, but also by encephalitogenic effector cells injected in 'subclinical' doses. We describe now the isolation of homogeneous T lymphocyte lines from the spleens of Lewis rats that had recovered from T-cell-mediated EAE (tEAE) caused by the MBP-specific T cell line S1. These spleen-derived T line cells express the CD8 phenotype and specifically respond to determinants on the inducing S1 line, but not to the autoantigen MBP. Furthermore, the anti-S1 cells selectively lyse the encephalitogenic S1 T line in vitro and efficiently neutralize their encephalitogenic capacity in vivo.\r"

Recently, the three-dimensional structure of the foreign antigen binding site of a class I histocompatibility antigen has been described. Because a crystal structure of a class II molecule is not available, we have sought evidence in class II molecules for the structural features observed in the class I binding site by comparing the patterns of conserved and polymorphic residues of twenty-six class I and fifty-four class II amino acid sequences. The hypothetical class II foreign-antigen binding site we present is consistent with mutation experiments and provides a structural framework for proposing peptide binding models to help understand recent peptide binding data.\r"

Approximately 37% of the population were vaccinated by the end of the first year and 60% were vaccinated by the end of the second year. There were 35 cases of Hib disease, 4 of whom were vaccine failures. Cases of Hib disease were identified by multiple modality case ascertainment, consisting of: (1) active surveillance in KPMCP microbiology laboratories; (2) active surveillance on KPMCP pediatric wards by a study physician; (3) retrospective review of computer-stored hospital discharge diagnoses; and (4) a review of all hospitalizations outside the health plan. The medical records of cases, matched controls and a random sample of the population were reviewed to obtain information on vaccination and related variables. Efficacy was evaluated using two complementary methods. In a retrospective surveillance approach, efficacy was estimated to be 68% (95% confidence limits of 4, 89%). In a matched case-control analysis, efficacy was estimated to be 69% (95% confidence limits of -13, 91%). Adjustment for day care attendance and parental occupation slightly reduced the efficacy estimate. Other possible confounders including race, parental education and number of siblings were considered. Four cases of Hib disease were observed within 1 week following receipt of vaccine and before the time when immunity could have developed. There are several plausible explanations for the occurrence of these early cases including the possibility of chance alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Conjugated vaccine stimulated significant mean increases in antibody titer as measured by radioimmunoassay and bactericidal effect, as well as a modest increase in opsonizing activity. In contrast unconjugated vaccine caused lesser albeit significant rises in antibody titer, but a negligible antibacterial effect. These results suggest that vaccinating infants with conjugated PRP is more likely to stimulate production of antibodies that are protective against systemic infection caused by H. influenzae type b than vaccinating with unconjugated PRP.\r"

  ".W": "Human terminal deoxyribonucleotidyltransferase (nucleoside-triphosphate:DNA deoxynucleotidylexotransferase, EC 2.7.7.31) cDNA contains an open reading frame of 1530 base pairs (bp) corresponding to a protein containing 510 amino acids. The encoded protein is a template-independent DNA polymerase found only in a restricted population of normal and malignant prelymphocytes. To begin to investigate the genetic elements responsible for the tissue-specific expression of terminal deoxyribonucleotidyltransferase, genomic clones containing the entire human gene were isolated and characterized. Initially, cDNA clones were isolated from a library generated from the human lymphoblastoid cell line, MOLT-4R. A cDNA clone containing the entire coding region of the protein was used to isolate a series of overlapping clones from two human genomic libraries. The gene comprises 11 exons and 10 introns and spans 49.4 kilobases. The 5' flanking region (709 bp) including exon 1 was sequenced. Several putative transcription initiation sites were mapped. Within 500 nucleotides of the translation start site, a series of promoter elements was detected. \"TATA\" and \"CAAT\" sequences, respectively, were found to start at nucleotides -185 and -204, -328, and 465 and -505. Start sites were found for a cyclic AMP-dependent promoter analog at nucleotide -121, an eight-base sequence corresponding to the IgG promoter enhancer (cd) at nucleotide -455, and an analog of the IgG promoter (pd) at nucleotide -159. These findings suggest that transcripts coding for terminal deoxyribonucleotidyltransferase may be variable in length and that transcription may be influenced by a variety of genetic elements.\r"

The single-copy sequence that identifies the locus D13S3 is also closely linked to both collagen genes. Four enzymes reveal polymorphisms with COL4A1, and 10 haplotypes have been observed in Caucasoids. Within COL4A1 a nonrandom association of alleles exists only between alleles defined by Hae III and those defined by the other three enzymes. A random association of alleles of COL4A1 and COL4A2 is observed. Between the two collagen genes were detected three meiotic recombination events that contributed to the estimate of 2.8% recombination. This is higher than expected for two genes that lie within 650 kilobases of each other. The lack of linkage disequilibrium between COL4A1 and COL4A2 is in agreement with the relatively high recombination that is observed.\r"

By panning the responding T cells on plates that were coated with purified HLA-A2, an essentially pure population of CD8+ anti-HLA-A2 CTL was isolated in a single step and established as a cell line designated A2p. In addition to lysing HLA-A2+ target cells, the A2p cells lysed HLA-A2- cells, including mouse cells (P815), when purified native HLA-A2 was attached to them, but not when denatured HLA-A2 was attached. Thus, contrary to the general rule that T cells recognize sequential antigenic determinants in denatured protein antigens, the alloreactive CTLs appear to recognize determinants that depend upon the native configuration of HLA-A2; however, the possibility that these T cells recognize a peptide adduct persistently associated with purified, soluble HLA-A2 has not been ruled out.\r"

We have studied the genomic DNA of 10 affected individuals from six families with this disorder using probes from the 5' and 3' ends of the vWF cDNA and with a probe extending from the 5' end into the central region. Southern blots of restriction endonuclease digests and gene dosage analysis measurements carried out with quantitative slot blots of undigested genomic DNA separated these patients into three groups. The first group consisted of a family with complete homozygous deletions of the vWF gene in the four probands. Gene dosage analysis was consistent with heterozygous deletions in both of the asymptomatic parents and four asymptomatic siblings of this kindred (P less than 0.01). The second group was comprised of a family in which there was a complete heterozygous deletion of the vWF gene in the proband and one asymptomatic parent, suggesting that a different type of genetic abnormality was inherited from the other parent. Thus, the patient appeared to be doubly heterozygous for interacting genetic abnormalities affecting vWF expression. In the third group, no gene deletions could be detected. Alloantibodies developed only in the kindred with homozygous deletions. These techniques should prove useful in identifying carriers of severe von Willebrand disease and also in defining patients predictably at risk of developing alloantibodies to vWF.\r"

Endothelial cells and platelets were pretreated with indomethacin to prevent the formation of prostaglandins. The adhesion of thrombin-stimulated platelets to endothelial cells was reduced by superoxide dismutase and bradykinin. The inhibitory effect of both drugs was abolished by hemoglobin and was absent in strips of bovine aorta where the endothelial cells had been removed by scraping. It is suggested that the effects of bradykinin are mediated by the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor, which is protected from destruction by superoxide dismutase, and that endothelium-derived relaxing factor contributes to the nonadhesive properties of the vascular endothelium.\r"

The system is composed of the phage M13mp7 single-stranded (ss) target DNA; the Fok I restriction enzyme; an oligodeoxynucleotide adapter-primer, which permits one to introduce Fok I cuts at any specified site in the target DNA; and DNA polymerase, which converts the ss target into a ds form ready for cloning. In this system, the oligodeoxynucleotide adapter-primer serves several purposes. The 5' hairpin ds domain of the adapter-primer contains the Fok I recognition site. Its 3' ss domain selects a complementary site on the target ss DNA, hybridizes with it to form the ds cleavage site, and serves as a primer to convert the ss M13mp7 target to ds DNA.\r"

Five observers independently interpreted the set of radiographs, with one observer interpreting the set twice. Observer performance in detecting abnormalities in the mediastinum and the retrocardiac lung were analyzed by using receiver-operating characteristic techniques. The results indicate that the use of a filter has no significant overall diagnostic advantage (areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves were 0.90 for the filtered radiographs and 0.89 for the unfiltered radiographs). No significant differences were found in the analysis of the various types or locations of lesions in the mediastinum.\r"

Eight physicians each examined 11 posteroanterior storage phosphor chest images (obtained with an experimental high-resolution storage phosphor system) side by side with conventional film images of the same patients. The storage phosphor images were obtained only minutes after the conventional radiographs were obtained. Storage phosphor images were digitally printed onto films in two different formats: a full-size (12 X 14 in. [30.5 X 35.6 cm]) and a half-size format of four computer-processed, minified images (6 X 7 in. [15.2 X 17.8 cm] each). Most of the responses rated the quality and resolution/sharpness of conventional images, as well as their ability to display the complete lung field, as either \"excellent\" or \"good\"; however, the storage phosphor images received significantly better ratings (p less than .05). Computer-processed minified versions of the storage phosphor images also received better ratings than did the conventional images. When the physicians were asked to rate their confidence level in making diagnoses with each of the two techniques, in 74 of 88 cases they indicated that their level of confidence would be at least as high when using the storage phosphor images as when using the conventional images.\r"

In nine (17%) of the 54, a new finding, absence of cul-de-sac fluid in the presence of generalized ascites, was noted. Parietal peritoneal thickening with contrast enhancement of the peritoneum, making the peritoneum visible as a thin line along the abdominal wall, was present in 45 (62%) of studies. This is believed to represent confluent peritoneal metastases. Small-bowel involvement was present in half of the cases (wall thickening and irregularity with or without obstruction). Tumor involvement of the omentum was visible as soft-tissue permeation of fat, enhancing nodules, and/or an omental cake. Of the 26 patients without a previously known malignancy, identification of the primary tumor in addition to peritoneal carcinomatosis was possible in 13 (50%). Appreciation of the spectrum of CT findings in peritoneal carcinomatosis is essential for accurate evaluation of scans in patients with abdominopelvic malignancies.\r"

We reviewed the results of percutaneous drainage of nine abscesses in eight patients with Crohn disease. Six of these abscesses communicated with the intestine. Those with enteric communication had temporary palliation, with improved medical status. However, all patients required definitive surgery within 7 weeks of initial drainage. Percutaneous drainage in the three patients without enteric communication resulted in a permanent cure. Our experience with this small series suggests that abscesses that have an enteric communication in patients with Crohn disease can be temporarily palliated by percutaneous drainage. However, use of this technique is unlikely to result in long-term palliation or cure. It appears that abscesses with intestinal communication in Crohn patients can be cured by percutaneous therapy alone.\r"

A steerable sheath is introduced via a percutaneous nephrostomy and is advanced into the distal ureter. Reentry into the bladder is effected by a perforating guidewire (transseptal stylet). This technique was attempted in 21 patients. It was effective in 12 of 13 patients whose ureters had been severed during vaginal hysterectomy and in four of five patients who had dehiscence of an anastomosis of the ureter to a bladder pouch (uretero-Boari anastomosis). The procedure, however, failed in all three patients who had dehisced surgical ureteroneocystostomies. This experience suggests that percutaneous ureteroneocystostomy is a feasible alternative to surgery. An adequate residual length of the pelvic ureter and preservation of its vascular supply are the major factors predisposing to the success of this technique.\r"

We also compared the two separate plane/coil combinations for detection of the \"double-line\" sign (high signal inside a band of low signal, believed to be characteristic for avascular necrosis) and intertrochanteric conversion of hematopoietic marrow to fatty marrow. Coronal, large-field-of-view, body-coil images provided an adequate screening examination for the presence of avascular necrosis (sensitivity of 94%) and were preferred in all cases for mediolateral localization of focal abnormality. They were also better for assessing joint fluid and detecting fatty conversion of marrow. Sagittal, small-field-of-view, surface-coil images were preferred for anteroposterior localization in all cases and for superoinferior localization of focal abnormality in 15 of 18 cases.

  ".W": "Posttrauma damage due to anterior glenohumeral joint dislocation may result in recurrent dislocation. Currently CT arthrography is the method of choice to evaluate the extent of osseous and soft-tissue changes before reconstructive surgery. This study was undertaken to determine if MR was able to depict postdislocation abnormalities and if MR is a possible replacement for CT arthrography. Thirteen patients with recurrent anterior shoulder dislocation were evaluated with conventional radiography and MR; CT arthrography was performed in 10. Twelve patients underwent surgery, and the findings of MR and CT arthrography were verified. MR and CT arthrography showed the integrity of the glenoid labrum equally well. All humeral head defects, detected in nine patients with plain film radiography and CT, were easily identified with MR. Information about anterior joint capsule abnormalities is difficult to obtain with MR. However, separation of the capsule from the bony glenoid can be detected if a joint effusion is present to adequately distend the joint. Preliminary results of this study indicate that MR is useful in the assessment of postdislocation abnormalities and may possibly replace CT arthrography in the evaluation of patients with recurrent shoulder dislocation.\r"

The results were compared with the presence of skeletal symptoms and the findings on 67Ga-citrate scintigraphy, when available. Forty (4%) of the 980 patients had 77 scintigrams showing osseous involvement; there was an average of 3.5 lesions per study. Compared with patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, patients with Hodgkin disease had significantly fewer axial lesions (44% vs 82%, p less than .000001, two-tailed test) and more frequent involvement of the extremities. Subtle lesions were common. Of the lesions detected by scintigraphy, significantly more were detected by 99mTc-diphosphonate imaging (95%) than were detected by 67Ga-citrate (44%) (p less than .00001, two-tailed test), and most of these were far less apparent on the 67Ga-citrate study. Skeletal pain was an insensitive but specific indicator of skeletal disease. These results show that skeletal scintigraphy in patients with lymphoma typically reveals multiple subtle and asymptomatic lesions with frequent extremity involvement. Diffusely increased calvarial activity is commonly seen and often persists in proved remission. Increased juxtaarticular activity is specific for malignant skeletal involvement.\r"

To evaluate the radiographic abnormalities associated with positive scintigraphy, all areas of the skeleton that showed abnormal uptake were studied further by plain radiography. High-resolution CT was performed in all patients who had spinal lesions. Ninety-six patients (69%) had abnormal radionuclide uptake in 57 extraspinal and 101 spinal sites. Uptake was increased in 53 joints and three long bones and decreased in one joint. The knee was the most frequently involved site; the second was the sacroiliac joint. Radiographic and high-resolution CT changes were seen in only 12 (21%) of 57 extraspinal sites. In the spine, the abnormal scintigrams showed either focal increased uptake in affected vertebral bodies (detected mostly on the anterior view and seen in 51 lower thoracic and lumbar vertebrae in 24 patients) or diffuse increased uptake in adjacent vertebrae (detected in anterior and posterior views and seen in 50 different disk levels in 38 patients). Radiographic and high-resolution CT changes were seen at all scintigraphically positive sites. We conclude that bone scintigraphy is a useful method for screening patients with osteoarticular brucellosis. It is more sensitive than radiography in assessing involvement of the extraspinal skeleton and in the spine, it allows accurate localization of affected areas.\r"

MR was the more sensitive technique, detecting 98% of the brain contusions compared with only 56% by CT. CT was slightly better for showing hemorrhagic components, documenting 77% of hemorrhages compared with 71% for MR. The appearance of the contusions on MR was variable, depending on the T1- and T2-weighting of the images and the constituents of the contusions, such as edema, hemorrhage, and encephalomalacia. On MR, hemorrhagic components appeared as high signal on T1-weighted images and as either low or high signal on T2-weighted images, depending on the age of the hemorrhage. The approximate ages of hemorrhagic contusions were often suggested by their appearance on T1- and T2-weighted images. CT is very effective for evaluating acute head trauma, but MR is recommended for documenting brain contusions during the subacute and chronic stages of head injuries.\r"

The three imaging techniques were evaluated separately to assess their utility in defining the size, characteristics, and location of the AVM nidus, its arterial supply, and venous drainage. The studies were also evaluated for their ability to show associated parenchymal abnormalities, the presence of mass effect, and changes occurring after embolization. MR was superior to both CT and angiography in showing the exact anatomic relationships of the nidus, feeding arteries, and draining veins, as well as in demonstrating the extent of AVM nidus obliteration after embolization. MR was more sensitive than CT in revealing associated parenchymal abnormalities and subacute hemorrhage. Because of flow-related artifacts and low sensitivity in distinguishing calcification from rapid flow and/or hemosiderin, MR seemed to have a low sensitivity for detecting old hemorrhage within an AVM nidus. Angiography is still needed in the planning of either surgical or endovascular treatment of AVMs.\r"

Sixteen of 20 cases demonstrated extradural masses that were distinct from the interspace of origin and had intermediate signal on T1-weighted images but increased signal on T2-weighted images. In 12 cases there was migration of the sequestered fragment. Sequestered disks that migrated away from the interspace had an irregular, oblong appearance, while those near the interspace were round in configuration. Additionally, the interspace of origin consistently demonstrated loss of signal on T2-weighted images when compared with intact lumbar disks. Sagittal 12-weighted images best depicted the absence of a high-signal pedicle contiguous with the interspace of origin in sequestered disks. These findings were applied to a prospective group of 20 patients undergoing lumbar diskectomy. There was an 89% sensitivity, 82% specificity, and 85% accuracy for MR in distinguishing sequestered disks from other forms of lumbar disk herniation. We conclude that high-resolution MR imaging is sensitive in detecting disk disease and specific in characterizing various subtypes of extradural defects. MR uses morphology as well as changes in signal intensity to make these distinctions.\r"

The results showed that, according to the criteria used, more information was present on the MR images with Gd-DTPA in 18 of 30 patients. In six of 30 patients, the improved quality of the images led to a change in the neurosurgical or neurologic approach. Gd-DTPA proved to be a safe contrast medium; no side effects or adverse reactions were observed.

On testing 12-57 individual X chromosomes, all sites but one were nonpolymorphic. However, a PstI site that maps to exon 10 of the G6PD gene, which is still monomorphic in all British and Italian subjects tested, is polymorphic in west-African people. Specifically, it is absent from 22% of Nigerian X chromosomes. By sequence analysis we have shown that the absence of this PstI site results from a G----A replacement at position 1116, corresponding to the third base of a glutamine codon; no amino acid change is produced in the protein. Thus, a polymorphic silent mutation is demonstrated in a human gene.\r"

  ".W": "The Lowe oculocerebrorenal syndrome (OCRL) is characterized by congenital cataract, mental retardation, and defective renal tubular function. A map assignment of OCRL to Xq24-q26 has been made previously by linkage analysis with DXS42 at Xq24-q26 (theta = 0, z = 5.09) and with DXS10 at Xq26 (theta = 0, z = 6.45). Two additional families were studied and three additional polymorphisms were identified at DXS42 by using a 35-kb sequence isolated with the probe detecting the original polymorphism at DXS42. With additional OCRL families made informative for DXS42, theta remained 0 with z = 6.63; and for DXS10 theta = 0.03 and z = 7.07. Evidence for placing OCRL at Xq25 also comes from a female with Lowe syndrome and an X;3 translocation. We have used the Xq25 breakpoint in this patient to determine the position of OCRL relative to the two linked markers. Each derivative chromosome was isolated away from its normal counterpart in somatic cell hybrids. DXS42 was mapped to the derivative chromosome X containing Xpterq25, and DXS10 was mapped to the derivative chromosome 3 containing Xq25-qter. The markers DXS10 and DXS42 therefore show tight linkage with OCRL in six families and flank the Xq25 breakpoint in a female patient with an X;3 translocation. Linkage analysis with flanking markers was used to assess OCRL carrier status in women at risk. Results, when compared with carrier determination by ophthalmologic examination, indicated that the slit-lamp exam can be a sensitive and specific method of carrier determination in many cases.\r"

DNA content analysis failed to reveal additional G0-G1 peaks or \"shoulders\" suggestive of aneuploid subpopulations in any case. Full-peak coefficients of variation ranged from 3.8 to 8.0.

Lymphocytes were identified on the basis of light scatter characteristics, and the nature of the cells was confirmed by cell sorting and electron-microscopic examination. Lymphocyte subpopulations were characterized with antibodies to lymphocyte surface markers, specifically Ig, Thy 1.2, Lyt 1, Lyt 2, and L3T4. Natural killer cells were identified with anti-asialo GM1. Egg-induced granulomas had more lymphocytes of all phenotypes at all time points. Surprisingly, there was a significant number of cells staining positive for asialo GM1. On Day 16 after embolization there was a greater percentage of helper T cells, as defined by positive staining with L3T4, in the egg model, compared with the bead model. There was no obvious shift of lymphocytes from either the blood or spleen into the granuloma. These data confirm the importance of T cells in the direct participation of granulomatous inflammation, and the large numbers of asialo GM1-positive cells suggest a role for natural killer cells.\r"

The majority of them stained positively for fibrinogen and alpha 1-antitrypsin by immunohistochemical methods. Of possible etiologies, the globules appear most probably as phagosomes containing imbibed serum proteins under conditions of increased sinusoidal pressure with passive congestion. They are more common than generally realized, when compared with other reported forms of nonglycogenic hyaline globules in liver. They must be distinguished from alpha 1-antitrypsin-disease globules.\r"

Demographic differences between patients with AIDS with and without CMV were minimal. Cytomegalovirus was never the sole diagnostic criterion for AIDS in any patient but was always accompanied by at least one other opportunistic infection or neoplasm. The total clinical course did not significantly differ between the two groups, but the length of final hospitalization of patients with CMV was much longer. Therapy for CMV prolonged the clinical course in some cases but did not eliminate the infection or prevent death from CMV. At autopsy the most common sites of involvement were adrenal (75%), pulmonary (58%), gastrointestinal (30%), central nervous system (20%), and ocular (10%). Most patients (62%) had multiple sites of involvement. Gross pathologic findings were frequent but often subtle. Microscopic changes accompanying CMV inclusions were variable and usually limited in extent.\r"

First, these data showed that the progressive decline seen in longitudinal SDAT studies is of the same type and magnitude seen in cross-sectional comparisons. Thus, comparing SDAT groups differing in severity provides for the same observations as following up subjects with mild SDAT over time. This study also demonstrates that with certain kinds of tests, selective subject attrition may not be any greater in longitudinal investigations than found in normal aging research. Subjects who dropped out of the longitudinal study were not that different from those who remained in, at least in terms of initial test performance on challenging tests. In this study less than 5% of the subjects with SDAT originally classified as being in the mild stage of the disease remained in this stage after 6 3/4 years of investigation. This inexorable downward path of the subject with SDAT is what appears paramount. Given the similarity of staging in longitudinal and cross-sectional studies, prior test performance levels in the latter studies can be ascertained even if with less accuracy than in longitudinal studies.\r"

Comparison with a new monoclonal assay for C1q-bearing immune complexes (the 242G3 assay) revealed that the immune complexes in SLE bind specifically to solid-phase C1q, and not to fluid-phase C1q. The C1q solid-phase binding activity sedimented as 7S IgG, was insensitive to DNase treatment, and could be selectively absorbed by C1q-coupled beads and by bovine serum albumin-anti-bovine serum albumin C1q beads, but not by DNA. Thus, antibodies to double-stranded DNA do not interfere in the C1q SPBA. Isolated IgG from SLE serum precipitated the collagen-like portions, and not the globular, Fc-recognizing portions, of C1q. F(ab')2 fragments of IgG from SLE patient serum were able to bind C1q. These data show that in SLE sera, especially in those with low levels of CH50 and C1q, autoantibodies that react with the collagen-like part of C1q are detectable. Since in the C1q SPBA, the C1q molecule is randomly fixed to the solid phase, we can detect not only immune complexes, but also antibodies that react with the collagen part of C1q; this may explain the high percentage of positive results for SLE sera in the C1q SPBA, in contrast to results of other immune complex assays.\r"

The synovial lesions of Lyme disease patients and rheumatoid arthritis patients were similar and often consisted of the elements found in normal organized lymphoid tissue. In both diseases, T cells, predominantly of the helper/inducer subset, were distributed diffusely in subsynovial lining areas, often with nodular aggregates of tightly intermixed T and B cells. IgD-bearing B cells were scattered within the aggregates, and a few follicular dendritic cells and activated germinal center B cells were sometimes present. Outside the aggregates, many plasma cells, high endothelial venules, scattered macrophages, and a few dendritic macrophages were found. HLA-DR and DQ expression was intense throughout the lesions. In 6 of the 12 patients with Lyme arthritis, but in none of those with rheumatoid arthritis, a few spirochetes and globular antigen deposits were seen in and around blood vessels in areas of lymphocytic infiltration. Thus, in Lyme arthritis, a small number of spirochetes are probably the antigenic stimulus for chronic synovial inflammation.\r"

  ".W": "Elimination of neoplastic B cell populations from autologous bone marrow grafts also removes normal B lymphocytes. This is potentially hazardous for the reconstitution of the immune system in patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy and total body irradiation followed by autologous marrow rescue. Five pediatric patients with B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in first remission undergoing such a regimen were studied. They received bone marrow pretreated with anti-Y 29/55 monoclonal antibody and complement. B and T lymphocyte subpopulations reached normal levels within 6 months after autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT), and serum immunoglobulin levels became normal within 4 to 9 months. Vaccination with diphtheria and tetanus toxoid, trivalent poliomyelitis vaccine of the Salk type, and pneumococcal capsular antigens (38 to 54 months after transplantation) gave rise to specific antibody production. ABO isoagglutinins could be demonstrated in all patients. The response pattern was similar to that of patients who received unmanipulated autologous bone marrow. It is concluded that ex vivo anti-Y 29/55 depletion of the marrow graft does not induce relevant disturbances of humoral immune functions.\r"

  ".W": "Thrombin is a physiological agonist that promotes platelet aggregation and secretion. In this study we observed that thrombin can also inhibit a function of platelets related to primary hemostasis. Platelet stimulation by thrombin decreased the binding of von Willebrand factor (vWF) to glycoprotein (GP) Ib and decreased ristocetin-induced agglutination, in vitro reactions that correlate with initial platelet adhesion to the vessel wall. Binding of the monoclonal antibody API to GP Ib was also decreased. Cytoskeletal participation in the change of GP Ib was suggested because pretreatment of platelets with cytochalasin to prevent actin filament formation prevented the thrombin-induced decreases in vWF binding. API binding, and ristocetin-induced agglutination. Measurement of GP Ib in detergent extracts by electroimmunoassay demonstrated no loss after thrombin stimulation. Electroimmunoassay also demonstrated that the API epitope of GP Ib on intact thrombin-treated platelets was accessible for complete digestion by chymotrypsin. Therefore GP Ib was neither released from the platelet surface nor internalized by thrombin treatment. A previously recognized effect of thrombin is its induction of receptor sites on platelet surface GP IIb-IIIa for contact-promoting proteins, including vWF that are involved in the platelet spreading and aggregation that follow adhesion. Therefore the action on GP Ib may combine with the effect on GP IIb-IIIa to shift platelet reactivity from GP Ib-vWF-mediated initial contact with the vessel wall to GP IIb-IIIa-mediated spreading and aggregation.\r"

  ".W": "The identity of human bone marrow (BM)-derived T cell precursors with colony forming capacity has led to controversy because of contamination with mature clonogenic T cells. We achieved 2 Log elimination of mature T cells from BM using a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies: CD2, CD3, CD4, CD6, and CD8 followed by two successive baby rabbit C' treatment. T cell depleted BM can generate colonies of CD2+, CD3+, Ti+, mostly CD4+, in the presence of PHA, rIL2, and a prothymocyte differentiating activity derived from phytohemagglutinin (PHA) induced mononuclear cells. These precursors could be enriched three- to sixfold by percoll gradient centrifugation and then significantly bypass the number of contaminant mature T cells as shown by limiting dilution analysis. Colony generation by marrow precursors was inhibited by the addition of autologous T cells. This inhibition was mostly caused by the T8+ subset. CFU-TL growth was dramatically inhibited by eliminating CD7+ cells suggesting their positivity for this surface marker. These precursors needed major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II-positive cells for optimal growth but lack DR themselves.\r"

All patients were evaluable for response to therapy and toxicity. No complete response was achieved. In all cases a definite, although transient reduction in the absolute number of peripheral blood lymphocytes was observed. In eight patients an increase in the absolute number of granulocytes was detected. None of the patients experienced severe hematologic toxicity. Fatigue, malaise, and fever were the more common side effects, but all patients were able to finish their treatment as planned. The results of this pilot study suggest that low doses of recombinant alpha 2-IF have some activity in early and previously untreated B-CLL and that further studies of IF effectiveness in B-CLL seem warranted.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the control of porcine von Willebrand factor (vWF) biosynthesis we cloned human vWF complementary DNA (cDNA) and investigated the expression of the vWF gene in lungs from normal pigs and pigs with severe von Willebrand's disease (vWD). Recombinant clones spanning approximately 90% of human vWF cDNA were identified in a lambda gt10 human lung cDNA library by screening with oligonucleotides. One clone spanning nucleotides 960 to 3,240 of human vWF cDNA was used to investigate the steady-state levels of vWF mRNA in lungs from normal pigs and from pigs phenotypically determined to be homozygous for vWD. This clone hybridized with genomic DNA from pig leukocytes when Southern blots were processed under very stringent conditions; therefore, human cDNA clones were considered valid probes to detect porcine mRNA. Northern blot analysis of total RNA from normal pig lung and human umbilical vein endothelial cells identified the vWF mRNA as a molecular species of approximately 9.0 kilobases (kb). A very faint to undetectable band at 9.0 kb in total RNA from lungs of vWD pigs suggested a decreased rate of transcription of the vWF gene. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation of RNA from the vWD pigs confirmed by Northern analysis that the high-molecular weight fractions contained vWF mRNA and at the same size as normal pig mRNA. Dot blot hybridization analysis of vWF and actin mRNA processed under stringent conditions demonstrated that the relative ratio of vWF mRNA to actin mRNA in the vWD pigs varied from 21% to 41% of the ratio observed in normal pigs. Because the amount of vWF mRNA is not correlated to the amount of vWF activity or antigen in plasma of vWD pigs we conclude that posttranscriptional events are also probably involved in abnormal expression of vWF in these animals.\r"

  ".W": "Fluid shear stress in arteries and arterioles partially obstructed by atherosclerosis or spasm may exceed the normal time-average level of 20 dyne/cm2. In vitro, at fluid shear stresses of 30 to 60 dyne/cm2 applied for 30 seconds, platelet aggregation occurs. At these shear stresses, either large or unusually large von Willebrand factor (vWF) multimers in the suspending fluid exogenous to the platelets mediates aggregation. Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) is also required and, in these experiments, was released from the platelets subjected to shear stress. At 120 dyne/cm2, the release of endogenous platelet vWF multimers can substitute for exogenous large or unusually large vWF forms in mediating aggregation. Endogenous released platelet vWF forms, as well as exogenous large or unusually large vWF multimers, must bind to both glycoproteins Ib and the IIb/IIIa complex to produce aggregation. Shear-induced aggregation is the result of shear stress alteration of platelet surfaces, rather than of shear effects on vWF multimers. It is mediated by either large plasma-type vWF multimers, endogenous released platelet vWF forms, or unusually large vWF multimers derived from endothelial cells, requires ADP, and is not inhibited significantly by aspirin. This type of aggregation may be important in platelet thrombus formation within narrowed arterial vessels, and may explain the limited therapeutic utility of aspirin in arterial thrombosis.\r"

Previously we have shown that patients with ITP in its active phase have abnormal T cell subsets. We then examined the phenotypes of T and B lymphocytes in an additional 28 patients with ITP and 32 age- and sex-matched normal controls and compared the lymphocytes' capacity to respond to polyclonal T, T cell-dependent B, and B cell mitogens. Blastogenesis to optimal (5.0 micrograms/mL) and suboptimal (0.5 microgram/mL) concentrations of the polyclonal T cell mitogens were markedly depressed in patients compared with normal controls (P less than .0005). Similarly, a severe depression in response was noted with the polyclonal T cell-dependent B cell mitogen (P less than .000001). No difference was seen, however, with the polyclonal B cell mitogen. The proportions of pan-T and T helper/inducer lymphocytes were significantly depressed (P less than .005 and P less than .000005 respectively), and the T suppressor/cytotoxic lymphocytes increased (P less than .02) in patients relative to controls. But there was no difference in the proportion of B lymphocytes or in their functional response. The abnormal cellular immunity appears to be due to a defect in the T lymphocyte population without involvement of the B lymphocytes.\r"

By using immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry we observed that CD22 is expressed not only in the cytoplasm (as previously reported) but also on the cell surface of virtually all (15/16) BCP-ALL examined. CD22 that was biosynthetically labeled with 35S-cysteine and immunoprecipitated from the uncommon cytoplasmic CD22-positive/surface CD22-negative BCP-ALL cells was analyzed by single-dimension sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Our results indicated that the cytoplasmic form of CD22 comigrated with 125I/lactoperoxidase-labeled surface CD22. Therefore, cytoplasmic CD22 is probably a pool of fully processed glycoprotein. We also observed unusual cases of AML (approximately 20%) that expressed cytoplasmic CD22 based on immunofluorescent staining; however, biosynthetic labeling and immunoprecipitation revealed an apparently cross-reactive protein(s) of approximately 250 to 300 kd in AML cells. No T-ALL cell lines examined expressed either cytoplasmic or surface CD22. Thus, cytoplasmic and surface expression of bona fide CD22 appears restricted to B cells, which suggests that this molecule subserves a function unique to B cells.\r"

  ".U": "88193383\r", 
  ".W": "Drug resistance in myeloid leukemias may be mediated by an increased capacity to repair chemotherapy-induced DNA damage. Some tumor cell lines that are resistant to nitrosoureas contain the DNA repair protein O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (alkyltransferase). This protects cells by removing cytotoxic, nitrosourea-induced O6-alkylguanine adducts. We measured the level of alkyltransferase activity in myeloid leukemic cells freshly obtained from patients to determine whether the alkyltransferase was an important factor in nitrosourea resistance in these cells and whether inactivation of this protein could sensitize leukemic cells to nitrosoureas. Myeloid leukemic cells from patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia had higher levels of alkyltransferase than did myeloid precursors from normal donors (P less than .01). This difference did not appear to be due to the state of differentiation of the leukemic or normal cells. To show that this repair protein mediated nitrosourea resistance in leukemic cells, cells were treated with the modified base O6-methylguanine to selectively and irreversibly inactivate the alkyltransferase and then exposed to 1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU). An 18-hour incubation in 0.5 mmol/L O6-methylguanine caused an 87% +/- 3.6% decrease in alkyltransferase activity in leukemic cells and a 73% +/- 8.6% decrease in normal myeloid precursors. After treatment with O6-methylguanine, clonogenic leukemic cells from ten different donors became much more sensitive to BCNU, with a decrease in the dose needed to reduce colony survival by 50% (LD50) of 6.3 +/- 1.4-fold. A lesser effect was seen on CFU-GM, BFU-E, and CFU-GEM where the LD50 decreased two- to threefold. These studies show that nitrosourea resistance in myeloid leukemic cells can be abrogated by inactivation of the DNA repair protein O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase. This method of biochemical modulation of DNA repair will sensitize leukemic cells to nitrosoureas in vitro and has the potential of increasing the therapeutic index of nitrosoureas in this disease.\r"

A total number of 104 CD4+ T cell clones so obtained were tested for their ability to proliferate in response to autologous mitomycin-treated non-T cells. About half of these clones but none of 234 CD4+ T cell clones derived from normal lymphoid tissues or peripheral blood displayed a proliferative response to autologous stimulators. When clones proliferating in autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction (AMLR) were assessed for their ability to respond in allogeneic MLR (allo-MLR), most of them were found to exhibit consistent proliferation in response to more than one haplotype. Both the AMLR and the allo-MLR by HD clones were inhibited by adding monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) reactive with monomorphic determinants of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II (DR) antigens to the cultures, whereas MoAbs reactive with MHC class I antigens were without effect. These studies suggest that lymphoid organs involved by HD contain high proportions of CD4 T cells showing abnormal recognition of DR antigens. These unusual cells may play an important role in the pathogenetic mechanisms occurring in HD.\r"

Fifty-two patients (35 male and 17 female) with a median age of 49 years, were consecutively encountered between October 1983 and April 1987; these accounted for 39% of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cases seen in our institutions. Ten patients (19.3%) had adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) associated with human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-1). Patients with ATL had disease similar to that reported from southwestern Japan and the Caribbean. They had frequent skin lesions (60%), hypercalcemia (40%), and a rapid clinical course with a median survival of 1.3 years. The 35 HTLV-1-negative peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTL) were similar to PTL in western countries, manifesting frequent visceral, cutaneous, and vascular tropisms. Marrow involvement was documented at presentation in 39% and Stage III/IV disease in 80% of the PTL patients. The histology of PTL usually expressed prominent reactive features which is distinct from that in ATL. Several subcategories could be defined: Hodgkin's-like PTL in nine patients, T-zone lymphoma in three, angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy-like lymphoma in one, Lennert's lymphoma in three, and angioinvasive lymphoma in four. Two HTLV-1-negative PTL had neoplastic cells with clover-shaped nuclei and were designated as ATL-like. Morphologic classification based on the modified Working Formulation showed prognostic correlation, with median survival of less than 6 months for large cell/immunoblastic PTL, compared with 5 years for patients with small/medium cell PTL. Both low- and high-grade PTL seem to represent an incurable disease. Classical cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (seven cases) is relatively unusual in Taiwan, compared with the frequency of PTL. Post-thymic T-cell malignancies in Taiwan include HTLV-1-positive and HTLV-1-negative diseases, both of which have a poor prognosis and resemble similar T-cell malignancies in the East and West.\r"

Brachial artery infusion of 1.25 to 10 pmol/min CGRP and of 0.25 to 1.5 pmol/min SP produced maximal increases in forearm blood flow (177 +/- 75% and 198 +/- 50%, respectively), as measured by venous occlusion plethysmography. The vasodilation due to CGRP was prolonged, with a half-life of biological effect of approximately 18 min, while that due to SP was of short duration, with a half-life of biological effect of approximately 15 sec. There was rapid development of tachyphylaxis to the effects of arterial infusion of SP, but not of CGRP, during a prolonged infusion at one dose. CGRP did not alter the diameter of a superficial hand vein, either at rest or when the vein was constricted by a simultaneous infusion of norepinephrine or by the single deep breath reflex. In contrast, SP caused dilatation of veins preconstricted with norepinephrine, although the effect was only transient and dose-response curves could not be constructed. The venoconstrictor response to a single deep breath was abolished by SP. Simultaneous arterial infusion of both peptides produced at least additive, and possibly synergistic, effects on forearm blood flow. We propose that both CGRP and SP have a role in the regulation of vascular smooth muscle tone.\r"

  ".W": "Myocardial structure of left ventricular segments with recurrent myocardial ischemia was evaluated by morphometry and compared with that of segments with normal blood supply in 15 patients with exercise-induced myocardial ischemia. Left ventricular high-fidelity pressure measurements and simultaneous biplane angiocardiography were performed in patients at rest and during supine bicycle exercise. Left ventricular transmural biopsy samples were obtained during open heart surgery in a normally contracting region and in a region with exercise-induced de novo wall motion abnormalities. Transmural and endocardial and epicardial left ventricular muscle fiber diameter and interstitial nonmuscular tissue were determined by morphometry. Eight patients were restudied 8 months after successful bypass grafting. Heart rate and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased significantly preoperatively and postoperatively during exercise. However, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was significantly higher preoperatively (33 mm Hg) during exercise than postoperatively (19 mm Hg; p less than .01). Left ventricular ejection fraction dropped significantly during exercise (63% vs 54%; p less than .001) before surgery but remained unchanged (64% vs 66%; NS) after revascularization. Regional axis shortening of the normokinetic region increased slightly during exercise pre- and postoperatively, but decreased in the hypokinetic region from 42% at rest to 25% during exercise (p less than .001) before surgery and from 47% at rest to 41% during exercise (p less than .05) after revascularization. Transmural muscle fiber diameter (normal less than or equal to 23 microns) was significantly larger in regions with exercise-induced ischemia (29.3 microns, p less than .025) than in normally contracting regions (27.3 microns). Interstitial nonmuscular tissue (normal less than or equal to 10%) was significantly increased in regions with exercise-induced wall motion abnormalities (19.8%) compared with normally contracting regions (15.5%; p less than .05). In the endocardial half of left ventricular segments with recurrent myocardial ischemia interstitial tissue was significantly increased (23.7%; p less than .01) compared with that in the epicardial half of the same segment (17.5%). It is concluded that structural alterations of the myocardium (muscle fiber hypertrophy and increased interstitial nonmuscular tissue) develop especially in the endocardial layers of the transiently ischemic myocardium with normal function at rest.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Four patients with non-PCP lung disease served as control subjects. In PCP patients, BAL LDH was sixfold higher, and BAL ALB, fourfold higher than in the non-PCP patients. The increased LDH/ALB in BAL as compared to serum, in addition to a BAL isoenzyme pattern characteristic of lung, suggest that BAL LDH arises from a pulmonary source. We postulate that the high correlation observed between BAL and serum LDH (r = 0.93, p less than 0.001) reflects backflow of pulmonary-derived LDH into the blood through an alveolocapillary membrane (ACM) compromised by PCP. Furthermore, a comparison of BAL LDH/ALB for each isoenzyme with the same serum ratio showed less backflow for the cationic isoenzymes. The ACM appears to sieve proteins on an electrical basis which may account for the LDH isomorphic pattern observed in the serum of PCP patients.\r"

Stimulation at 6 Hz with 50 ms pulses between amplitudes of 15 and 25 mA uniformly produced pouch contraction and reservoir emptying. Stimulation at other frequencies did not cause pouch emptying although pressure increases were sometimes observed. Such electrical stimulation may be useful for voluntary control of intestinal reservoirs when used as replacement for urinary bladder or colon. The mechanism by which the intestinal contraction is produced appears to be different than that produced by slow wave pacing.\r"

This intestinal converted fraction, as measured by HemoQuant, was elevated as a predictor of the occult bleeding site in 152 patients with discrete lesions. The intestinal converted fraction, expressed as the percentage of total fecal hemoglobin, was similar with upper gastrointestinal and proximal colon lesions. Within the colon, values trended downward with more distal location: means +/- standard deviations were 18 +/- 14 proximal colon, 16 +/- 15 sigmoid, and 10 +/- 10 rectum. The amount of fecal blood also affected the intestinal converted fraction; correcting for hemoglobin concentration improved separation by site. Corrected intestinal converted fraction values were significantly lower with rectal (P less than 0.0005) and sigmoid (P less than 0.02) lesions than with proximal colon lesions. Unfortunately, large within-site variation caused considerable overlap between sites. We conclude that the intestinal converted fraction is influenced by the site and amount of bleeding. However, its clinical utility is compromised by substantial individual differences in luminal hemoglobin metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "Recent investigations indicate that microvascular injury, leading to increased vascular permeability and capillary stasis, precede the development of chemically induced hemorrhagic mucosal lesions in the stomach. The vascular damage is more amenable to protection by prostaglandins and sulfhydryls than the diffuse surface mucosal cell injury. The vascular and mucosal lesions may be the result of direct toxicity of damaging agents (eg, ethanol, HCl, NaOH) and the release of vasoactive amines and leukotrienes. We review here our recent studies performed in rats indicating that intraarterial infusion of LTC4 or LTD4 in the stomach caused vascular injury as revealed by monastral blue. Infusion of leukotrienes alone caused no hemorrhagic mucosal lesions but aggravated the damage caused by 25, 50, or 100% ethanol and 0.2 N HCl given intragastrically. The ethanol-induced mucosal lesions were slightly diminished by the lipoxygenase inhibitor L-651,392 and markedly decreased by eicosapentaenoic acid, which competes with arachiconic acid as a substrate for 5-lipoxygenase. These results are discussed and correlated with biochemical results from other laboratories demonstrating increased levels of leukotrienes in the gastric mucosa after administration of ethanol and decreased release following pretreatment with prostaglandins or sulfhydryl-related agents. New data thus support a mediatory role for leukotrienes in the pathogenesis of vascular injury and mucosal lesions in the stomach.\r"

  ".W": "The specific binding of [125I]epidermal growth factor [( 125I]EGF) to hepatic microsomal membranes was about 2-fold higher in adult male than in adult female rats. Scatchard analysis of the binding data showed that the sex difference in EGF binding was due to the difference in EGF receptor concentration rather than to a change in receptor affinity. From the developmental study, an apparent sex difference in EGF binding was observed from the pubertal period (4 weeks of age). Castration of adult male rats slightly, but significantly, decreased the EGF receptor level; and moreover, treatment of adult females with testosterone increased it only slightly. On the other hand, castration of neonatal male rats decreased the EGF receptor content almost to the female level. The decreased level of the receptor was completely restored by the combination of neonatal and pubertal treatments with testosterone. Neonatal or pubertal treatment alone of castrated animals had no significant effect on the decreased level of EGF receptors. These effects of testosterone were similarly observed when normal female rats were treated with the steroid. Moreover, hypophysectomy of the rats resulted in the marked decrease in EGF receptors only in the male animals. Treatment of hypophysectomized rats with either testosterone or T3 had no apparent effect on the EGF receptors. The membrane protein, cross-linked with [125I]EGF, had a mol wt of 170,000, and this protein (EGF receptor) was phosphorylated basally or by the addition of EGF. The rate of affinity labeling, or phosphorylation of EGF receptors, was in good agreement with the results of the EGF binding study. These results strongly suggest that the EGF receptor level in rat liver plasma membranes is in part regulated by the hypothalamopituitary unit and that neonatal androgens are essential for this regulation, probably through their effects on the hypothalamus.\r"

  ".W": "In a previous study, 5' deiodinase (5'D) activity was detected in skin but not in other tissues of premetamorphic tadpoles. When these tadpoles were stimulated to metamorphic climax by treatment with thyroid hormone, activity was increased in skin and was found also in gut and tail tissue. In the present study, 5'D activity was studied at various stages of spontaneous development from early prometamorphosis through metamorphic climax and including the adult frog. 5'D activity was detected in gut and skin at all stages studied and in metamorphosing tail tissue. It was minimal or absent in all other tissues examined. Activity in prometamorphic skin was comparable to that previously observed in premetamorphic skin but increased significantly during metamorphic climax and remained at this level in the adult. 5'D activity was not observed in tail tissue until resorption commenced and when present could not be correlated with tadpole stage or tail length. In both skin and tail, the 5'D activity exhibited values for Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) for rT3 and T4 in the nanomolar range. During prometamorphosis, the 5'D activity in gut exhibited a value for the rT3 Km in the micromolar range. As the tadpoles entered metamorphic climax, the rT3 Vmax of this activity in gut decreased and a second type of 5'D activity, with a Km for rT3 in the nanomolar range, was detected in this tissue. By stage XXI, only the latter component was observed, and its activity increased significantly during metamorphic climax. In the adult frog, 5'D activity in gut was comparable to that seen at the onset of climax. The adult frog also exhibited T3 5D activity in all tissues studied. These observations, together with those reported in the previous study, indicate that gut and skin are the principal T3-generating organs in anuran amphibia and suggest that increased activity of the 5'D system, at the time in the life cycle that the tissues require increased amounts of thyroid hormone, is an important part of thyroid hormone economy in this species.\r"

A dose as small as 3 ng of IL-1 beta injected icv induced a significant rise in plasma ACTH levels, whereas 100 ng/100 g body wt (approximately 300 ng/rat) was needed for a significant ACTH response when injected iv. Intracerebroventricular administration of 30 ng IL-1 alpha tended to increase plasma ACTH levels, but not significantly. Intravenous injection of 1000 ng/100 g IL-1 beta induced a maximal response with a pronounced elevation of plasma ACTH levels at 10 and 30 min after injection, but plasma ACTH levels fell at 60 min post injection. On the other hand, icv injection of 30 ng IL-1 beta raised plasma ACTH levels at 10 min, reaching peak values between 30 and 60 min post injection, and plasma ACTH levels remained elevated for 2-3 h after injection. Pretreatment with indomethacin completely prevented the ACTH response induced by either iv or icv injection of IL-1 beta. Administration of indomethacin did not alter the elevation of plasma ACTH levels induced by immobilization stress, however. On the other hand, vagotomy did not alter the ACTH response to iv administered IL-1 beta. Neither iv nor icv injection of IL-1 beta in a dose which induced a maximal ACTH response altered plasma PRL levels. These findings strongly suggest that the brain is the primary site of action of IL-1 beta, and that IL-1 beta transmits the message of the immune system to the brain and, possibly, CRF neurons. It is also suggested that prostaglandins may be involved in this central action of IL-1 beta.\r"

  ".U": "88195964\r", 
  ".W": "Epinephrine (EPI) has been described to stimulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. However, whether central EPI neuronal systems play a major physiological role in the regulation of ACTH secretion and whether that role is primarily stimulatory or inhibitory in nature is still controversial. The present study addressed these questions using different inhibitors of phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PNMT), which were either active peripherally or were both peripherally and centrally active. Male rats received either vehicle or a PNMT inhibitor at various times before further experimental procedures. A large decrease in hypothalamic EPI levels was observed in rats given central PNMT inhibitors, whereas these treatments did not affect hypothalamic norepinephrine (NE) levels. Plasma EPI, but not NE, was decreased to similar levels after treatment with peripheral or central PNMT inhibitors. Basal plasma ACTH decreased slightly during the 12 h after central PNMT inhibition. Central, but not peripheral, inhibition of PNMT significantly decreased the plasma ACTH response to ether vapor stress at 5 and 15 min. This effect was seen 3 or 12 h after PNMT inhibition. The suppression of the stress response was not due to a change in responsiveness of the pituitary to CRF. The hypothalamic content of CRF was significantly decreased 9 and 12 h after inhibition of central PNMT. Blockade of the stress response actually preceded the changes in CRF levels. The content of arginine vasopressin, another potent ACTH secretagogue, was not affected 3, 6, 9, or 12 h after that treatment. The effect on CRF was not observed in rats treated with the peripheral PNMT inhibitor, nor was it caused by manipulation and stress of the animals 12 h before death. The dat demonstrate that central inhibition of PNMT, which produces a selective decrease in hypothalamic EPI levels, blunts the response of plasma ACTH to ether vapor stress, and at later times also causes a selective decrease in CRF content. Furthermore, the altered ACTH response to ether stress is not due to a change in responsiveness of the pituitary to CRF or to an alteration in arginine vasopressin levels. Thus, an endogenous EPI neuronal system appears to stimulate CRF neurons responsible for the increase in ACTH after ether vapor stress.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between cAMP and protein kinase C in the regulation of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta HSD), 17 alpha-hydroxylase, and sulfotransferase was examined in human fetal adrenocortical cells under defined serum-free conditions in culture. Forskolin induced 3 beta HSD and 17 alpha-hydroxylase in a dose-dependent manner, with maximal effects at 10 microM. 12-O-Tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) at 1 nM depressed the induction of 17 alpha-hydroxylase activity by forskolin by more than 95% and increased the stimulation of 3 beta HSD activity by forskolin by 4- to 5-fold. Increases were maximal at 48-72 h of incubation. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfotransferase activity increased over 48 h when cells were transferred to serum-free defined medium. Addition of 10 microM forskolin stimulated sulfotransferase activity only when cells remained in 10% serum. TPA at 1 nM inhibited the increase in sulfotransferase activity. The concentration of TPA required for inhibition of forskolin-stimulated 17 alpha-hydroxylase and sulfotransferase activity was similar to that required for enhancement of forskolin-induced 3 beta HSD activity, suggesting that comparable levels of C kinase activation are involved in these events. Angiotensin II, carbachol, epidermal growth factor, and fibroblast growth factor had actions similar to those of TPA on one or more of these enzyme activities. TPA also had similar actions on enzyme activities when they were stimulated by cAMP analogs rather than by forskolin. These studies suggest that adrenal steroid biosynthesis is under dual regulation by cAMP and protein kinase C. cAMP induces enzymes required for synthesis of 17 alpha-hydroxylated steroids, including the adrenal androgens. Activation of protein kinase C may play a complementary role by enhancing the induction of enzymes required for non-17 alpha-hydroxylated steroid biosynthesis and inhibiting those involved in the synthesis of androgens.\r"

Plasma membranes and extracellular matrix vesicles were isolated, and specific activities of phospholipase A2 and alkaline phosphatase were determined. The results demonstrate that the response to hormone is both cell and membrane specific. 1,25-(OH)2D3 produces an increase in GC matrix vesicle alkaline phosphatase and phospholipase A2 specific activities at 10(-9) and 10(-8) M, but has no effect on these enzyme activities in RC membranes. RC cultured in 24,25-(OH)2D3 exhibit increased matrix vesicle alkaline phosphatase but decreased phospholipase A2 activities at 10(-7) and 10(-6) M hormone. No effect on the RC plasma membrane enzymes or on GC plasma membrane or matrix vesicle enzymes was observed.

  ".W": "The present study investigated the process by which the microsomal cytochrome P-450 17 alpha-hydroxylase enzyme (P-450(17) alpha) activity in Leydig cells is decreased by steroid products in an oxygen-dependent manner. Leydig cells were maintained in primary culture at ambient (19% O2) or reduced (1% O2) oxygen tension and treated with 8-bromo-cAMP or steroids for 48 h. The amount and activity of P-450(17) alpha present in the treated cells were measured to determine whether changes in the activity of the enzyme due to treatment correlated with changes in the amount of the enzyme protein. At ambient oxygen tension the amount of P-450(17) alpha declined in Leydig cells treated with cAMP, and this decrease could be prevented when cultures were maintained at reduced oxygen tension. Treatment of cultures with testosterone caused an oxygen-sensitive decrease in the amount of the enzyme similar in extent to the cAMP-induced decrease. Reductions in the amount of P-450(17) alpha corresponded to reductions in the activity of the enzyme. The decline in the amount of P-450(17) alpha was due to increased decay of the enzyme protein and not to a decrease in the rate of synthesis of P-450. In contrast to testosterone, neither estradiol nor cortisol affected the amount of P-450(17) alpha. The data are consistent with the proposal that steroid products acting as pseudosubstrates cause decreases in P-450(17) alpha activity by enhancing oxygen radical-mediated damage to the enzyme. The damaged enzyme resulting from this process is more prone to degradation than is the intact protein.\r"

  ".U": "88196007\r", 
  ".W": "We examined the effects of several in vitro experimental systems on the apparent potencies of putative secretagogues for stimulating ACTH release from rat anterior pituitary cells. Cells were prepared by trypsin digestion and gentle mechanical dispersion. Aliquots of the same cell preparations were tested in 1) a microperifusion system immediately after dispersion (day 0), 2) the same microperifusion system after 4 days of static suspension culture on a layer of Sephadex G-10 gel particles (day 4), 3) a static suspension system after 4 days of static suspension culture, and 4) a static monolayer system after 4 days of monolayer culture. Ovine CRF stimulated release of similar amounts of ACTH in all of the systems on days 0 and 4, except in one experiment, in which the response was less on day 4. Arginine vasopressin (AVP), oxytocin, and angiotensin II all appeared to be more potent in day 4 than in day 0 cells in the perifusion system, and the synergism of AVP with ovine CRF was also increased. Dioctanoylglycerol, which directly activates protein kinase-C, and forskolin, which directly activates adenylate cyclase, both stimulated greater release in day 4 cells. The mechanism(s) responsible for the difference in the responses of day 0 and day 4 cells is unknown. Epinephrine had only a small effect in the microperifusion system, but both epinephrine and norepinephrine had potencies comparable to AVP in the static suspension and monolayer systems. This was not due to prolonged exposure to the catecholamines, suggesting that these agents may act on other anterior pituitary cells to release metabolic products that secondarily stimulate the corticotrophs to release ACTH. The same situation appears to be true for atrial natriuretic factor. Gastrin-releasing peptide, its bioactive COOH-terminal half, which was active in a rat urinary bladder smooth muscle assay, its amphibian analog, bombesin, and cholecystokinin (26-33) were devoid of ACTH-releasing activity in all of the systems, in contrast to the findings of others. Since 4-day culture of dispersed cells improved most of their responses and diminished none, we postulate that they may more closely resemble normal pituitary cells in function, and since cellular metabolites are unlikely to accumulate in the interstitial fluid of the pituitary gland, we propose that the secretory functions of cells in perifusion systems may more closely resemble those in the pituitary gland in situ than they do in static incubation systems.\r"

A 49-amino acid region of the porcine molecule is 59-71% homologous to corresponding areas of rat, bovine, and human chromogranin A, and identical to the amino acid sequence of porcine pancreastatin. The sequence is preceded by an arginine at the N-terminus and followed by a GKR sequence at the C-terminus. Thus, porcine chromogranin A can serve as the precursor for pancreastatin, a polypeptide capable of inhibiting insulin release from the endocrine pancreas and acid secretion from parietal cells of the gut.\r"

These cells have been implicated in the genesis of proteinuria in some forms of immune-mediated renal disease. We measured ATL in 18 IDDM patients with diabetic nephropathy, 10 with nonnephrotic proteinuria (total urinary protein excretion rate greater than 0.5 and less than 3.5 g/24 h) and 8 with nephrotic proteinuria (total urinary protein excretion rate greater than 3.5 g/24 h), and in 17 age-, sex-, and duration-of-diabetes-matched diabetic control subjects without clinical proteinuria (total urinary protein less than 0.5 g/24 h). T-lymphocytes purified from peripheral blood were stained by direct immunofluorescence with the fluorescein-labeled monoclonal antibody anti-HLA-DR. Absolute number and percent of DR-positive T-lymphocytes were significantly higher in patients with nonnephrotic proteinuria (median and range 162 x 10(6)/ml, 40-320 x 10(6)/ml; 13.9%, 8.1-19.4%) compared with nonproteinuric control subjects (81 x 10(6)/ml, 2-240 x 10(6)/ml, P less than .05; 6.2%, 0-13.1%, P less than .01). In 8 patients with nephrotic proteinuria, absolute and percent DR-positive T-lymphocytes tended to be lower (36 x 10(6)/ml, 14-56 x 10(6)/ml; 3.4%, 1.1-5.4%) than in nonproteinuric control subjects. An increased number of activated T-lymphocytes may be part of an immune-mediated process associated with the development of proteinuria in diabetic nephropathy. In advanced renal disease with nephrotic proteinuria, this immune process may become exhausted.\r"

  ".W": "The term \"hemorrhagic gastritis\" is frequently applied to the subepithelial hemorrhages seen at endoscopy in alcoholic patients without a clear understanding of the histologic nature of these lesions. We prospectively screened 125 actively drinking alcoholic patients undergoing upper endoscopy for gastrointestinal bleeding. Gastric subepithelial hemorrhages were found in 20 of these patients. Biopsy specimens of hemorrhagic lesions and nonhemorrhagic mucosa 1 and 3 cm away were taken with a \"jumbo\" forceps. Gastric biopsy specimens from 12 patients with Barrett's esophagus served as controls for biopsy-induced trauma. Biopsy slides from the patients and controls were coded before histologic scoring. Mean hemorrhage scores (range, 0-4) for the target lesions (2.9 +/- 0.3) were significantly greater than scores for the adjacent mucosa (1 cm, 1.0 +/- 0.2; 3 cm, 1.1 +/- 0.2) or control biopsy specimens (0.8 +/- 0.1). Hemorrhage was superficial, occurring primarily in the foveolar region. Mucosal edema (score range, 0-4) was a prominent feature in the adjacent, nonhemorrhagic mucosa (target lesion, 0.7 +/- 0.2; 1 cm, 1.9 +/- 0.4; 3 cm, 2.0 +/- 0.3; controls, 0.8 +/- 0.1). Edema extended into the deeper gland zones in 11 of 20 patients but in none of the 12 controls (p less than 0.05). Inflammatory cell infiltrates were mild and scores did not vary significantly among the three biopsy sites in alcoholic patients. We conclude that subepithelial hemorrhages seen at endoscopy in alcoholic patients represent localized hemorrhage of the foveolar region with edema in the surrounding mucosa but without prominent inflammatory cell infiltration. Rather than use the term \"hemorrhagic gastritis,\" endoscopists should simply describe these lesions as subepithelial hemorrhages.\r"

  ".W": "The healing of acetic acid-induced gastric and duodenal ulcers was examined together with biochemical indices of growth in gastric and duodenal mucosa in rats with intact or removed salivary glands after treatment with epidermal growth factor (EGF) or somatostatin, or both. After the extirpation of salivary glands, the healing rate of gastric and duodenal ulcerations was delayed and gastric content of immunoreactive EGF was reduced. This was accompanied by a significant decrease in the contents of deoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid in the gastric and duodenal mucosa. Repeated administration of EGF either subcutaneously or orally accelerated the healing of gastroduodenal ulcers in rats with intact salivary glands and completely reversed the delay in ulcer healing in sialoadenectomized animals. These effects were also accompanied by a significant increase in the growth parameters of gastric and duodenal mucosa. Administration of somatostatin, which prevented the growth-promoting action of subcutaneous EGF, resulted in a significant decrease in the EGF-stimulated healing of gastric and duodenal ulcerations in both intact and sialoadenectomized rats. Our findings suggest that cell proliferation is an important factor in healing of gastric and duodenal ulcerations and that EGF plays an important role in ulcer healing due to its mitogenic action.\r"

Technical aspects for use of the internal mammary artery as a sequential graft to two or more coronary arteries is technically a feasible procedure when certain guidelines are followed. We advise its use primarily for left anterior descending/diagonal connections and avoid its use when there is a wide angle between the latter vessels to avoid kinking. The distal end-to-side IMA anastomosis is always performed first to the most important coronary artery. With this approach if there is a problem with length or lie of the IMA graft, the sequential anastomosis to the lesser important coronary artery may be aborted. The side-to-side technique is used most often. Postoperative angiograms in 11 patients have revealed no evidence of stenosis, occlusion, or late ill effects.\r"

Serum OC levels are generally believed to reflect the de novo synthesis of OC by osteoblasts and thus reflect bone formation. We measured serum OC levels by RIA in 48 patients receiving phenprocoumon anticoagulant treatment, which inhibits the posttranscriptional synthesis of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid, and in 22 matched normal subjects. The median serum OC level in the patients receiving phenprocoumon therapy was significantly lower than that in the normal subjects (P less than 0.0001). In 27 patients receiving anticoagulant therapy and in 21 normal subjects the proportion of noncarboxylated OC to total OC also was determined. The proportion of OC that was noncarboxylated was significantly higher in the patients receiving phenprocoumon therapy than in the normal subjects (P less than 0.0001). We conclude that OC carboxylation is impaired in patients receiving oral anticoagulant therapy. The decreased total OC levels in patients receiving phenprocoumon treatment might result from decreased bone formation, although these patients do not have symptoms of bone disease.\r"

Both serum BGP and BAP distinguished abnormalities well (mean Z scores for BGP and BAP, respectively) and gave concordant results in patients with hypoparathyroidism (-1.7, -1.4), hyperthyroidism (+1.1, +1.8), primary hyperparathyroidism (+3.6, +2.5), acromegaly (+1.2, +2.8), and postmenopausal osteoporosis (+0.4, +1.9). The 2 markers gave discordant results, however, in patients with glucocorticoid excess (-2.4, +0.9), Paget's disease (+1.8, +41.8), chronic renal failure (+16.3, +0.4), and osteolytic metastases (-1.4, +5.9). These discrepancies may have occurred because serum BGP and BAP concentrations reflect different aspects of osteoblast function or because there are differences in their clearance from the circulation. Consequently, more information is derived about the level of bone formation across the wide range of metabolic bone disorders when both biochemical markers are assayed.\r"

HLA DR antigen expression on tumour cells was present in about 60% of both tumour groups.

To explain the alteration in immunogenic properties of this Ag, the uptake of nBSA and cationized BSA (cBSA) by splenic APC has been investigated. T cell proliferation assays were conducted with nBSA and cBSA preparations with varying degrees of substitution. An inverse correlation between the degree of cationization and the amounts of Ag needed for optimal T cell reactivity was observed. To determine whether affinity for APC resulted in an increased uptake of cBSA, splenic APC were incubated with nBSA or cBSA for varying amounts of time. Comparisons were made at each time point between untreated Ag-pulsed APC (Ag uptake) and paraformaldehyde-fixed Ag-pulsed APC (processed Ag). Proliferation of T cells primed with nBSA or cBSA increased in proportion to the amount of time of APC exposure to high concentrations of nBSA, first appearing after a 2-h pulse and peaking at 8 h. Conversely, untreated APC needed only a 30-min cBSA exposure to induce either nBSA- or cBSA-primed T cell proliferation, indicating a rapid uptake of cBSA. Comparisons with proliferation induced by paraformaldehyde-fixed cBSA APC indicate that nBSA T cells recognize a lag phase-processed form of cBSA, whereas a majority of cBSA T cells recognize either a rapidly processed form of cBSA, or a membrane-processed cBSA molecule without a classical lag phase processing event. When monensin was used as an inhibitor of fluid phase pinocytosis in splenic APC, the presentation of nBSA was inhibited by 85%, but the presentation of cBSA was inhibited by only 20%. These results imply that nBSA enters the cell by fluid phase pinocytosis, whereas cBSA enters by a nonspecific adsorptive mechanism. The different modes of cellular entry for the two molecules, nBSA and cBSA, resulting in a rapid uptake of cBSA, may have important ramifications on T cell activation and immunoregulation.\r"

  ".W": "Th cell recognition of globular proteins requires the uptake and intracellular processing of the native Ag by an APC to produce a peptide fragment containing the T cell antigenic determinant, which is recognized in conjunction with Ia. This report describes the time course of the processing and presentation of a soluble globular protein Ag, pigeon cytochrome c (Pc), and of the presentation of a C-terminal peptide fragment of Pc, residues 81 to 104 (Pc 81-104), which does not require processing. Splenic B cells, acting as APC, require 6 to 8 h incubation with native Pc to process and present it to an I-Ek-restricted Pc-specific T cell hybrid, resulting in the secretion of IL-2. Moreover, the time required for B cells to process Pc is the same whether the Ag is taken up by nonspecific fluid phase pinocytosis or by binding to surface Ig. Once processed, Ag is lost from the B cell surface by 8 to 12 h, although when provided with fresh Pc, the same B cells are still capable of processing and presenting. In contrast to native Pc, only 1 to 2 h are required for the peptide fragment Pc 81-104 to become associated with B cells in a stimulatory fashion, and this time is similar for live and paraformaldehyde-fixed B cells, which cannot internalize or process the peptide. Washed free of excess peptide after 2 h, B cells lose their ability to stimulate T cells by 8 to 12 h, with a time course indistinguishable from that for the loss of processed native Pc. Prolonged incubation of B cells with the peptide for 18 to 24 h results in a dramatic loss of the ability to present Pc 81-104. Even when provided with fresh Pc or Pc 81-104, these cells have diminished ability to present these Ag. This loss is selective, inasmuch as these B cells remain equivalent to untreated B cells in the presentation of an unrelated Ag, OVA, to an I-Ak-restricted specific T cell. However, the ability to present another I-Ek-restricted antigenic peptide of the D glycoprotein of HSV to its specific T cell is also diminished. Loss of activity is observed after incubation only with the peptide and not with the native protein and is not due to a depletion of the antigenic peptide from the incubation medium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The proliferative status of thymocyte cell subsets in vivo was assessed by observing the effect of two antimitotic drugs, hydroxyurea (HU) and demecolcine. Both drugs had the greatest effect on the double-positive (DP) subset followed by the L3T4+ single-positive (SP) subset. However, the decrease in the latter type was delayed by several days, showing that their precursors rather than the cells themselves were killed by HU. Double-negative (DN) cells were less affected, indicating that they contain a resting subset and that they are renewed by emigration rather than by autonomous in situ proliferation. After drug treatment all cycling cells were eliminated from the thymus but, as shown by in vivo and in vitro bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, new cells rapidly reentered in cycle, starting from DN cells and Lyt-2+ SP cells and followed by DP cells. Lyt-2+ SP cycling cells represent an intermediary stage between DN and DP cells, and they are very transient. Injection of HU 24 h after in vivo BrdUrd labeling eliminated most labeled DN cells, but did not prevent the emergence of L3T4+ SP-labeled cells on day 3 as observed in control thymuses. These results suggest that these L3T4+ SP cells are generated from DP cells in the absence of proliferation. Cycling cells in the regenerating thymus were first located at the corticomedullary junction and then in the subcapsular region, suggesting a reverse migration process to that observed after cessation of proliferation. A model is proposed to summarize these sequential events.\r"

  ".W": "Stimulation of IL-2-producing T cell clones with chemically modified APC and Ag induces a state of proliferative unresponsiveness, i.e., subsequent stimulation with normal APC and Ag fails to elicit IL-2 production. One possible effect of chemical modification on the APC is the destruction of its ability to provide costimulatory signals. To test this, various potential costimulators were added to T cells at the time of exposure to Ag and chemically modified APC. None of the cytokines tested, including IL-1, had a positive effect; however, addition of allogeneic spleen cells allowed a T cell proliferative response and prevented the induction of subsequent unresponsiveness. Fractionation of the spleen cells showed that low density B cells and macrophages were the best source of costimulatory activity. Allogeneic resting B cells provided some costimulatory activity and resting T cells, none at all. Attempts to mimic costimulatory signals with the phorbol ester PMA were only partially successful. PMA prevented the induction of T cell unresponsiveness but failed to allow T cell proliferation in response to Ag plus chemically modified APC. Our results suggest that IL-2 production by normal T cell clones is dependent not only on T cell receptor occupancy, but also on short range costimulatory signals that are provided to different degrees by various non-T accessory cells.\r"

  ".W": "Two class I MHC mutant mouse strains, bm14 and bm13, differ from the strain of origin B6 in one and three amino acids in the alpha 1 and alpha 2 domains of the H-2Db molecule, respectively. These alterations result in specific failure to generate a CTL (Tc) response to the male-specific Ag H-Y. Immunization and/or restimulation in vitro with syngeneic male dendritic cells (DC), expressing very high levels of class I MHC molecules, restored the H-Y-specific Tc response of bm14 but not of bm13 mice. Serologically Db determinants were lost in normal spleen cells of both mutants, because FACS analysis showed a decreased binding of Db domain-specific mAb. Although bm13 DC show a higher fluorescence than bm13 normal spleen cells it is still strongly reduced (30 to 50%) in comparison with B6 DC. Surprisingly, bm14 DC show an equally very strong binding compared with B6 DC with these mAb. The quantitative expression of class I molecules on APC thus appears to be a major determinant in the regulation of Tc responses. In addition, immunization with DC markedly influenced the target cell specificity of the ensuing Tc response. The combined data clearly demonstrate that besides the highly efficient class II-restricted presentation of Ag to Th, shown previously, DC are also superior in the presentation of Ag in the context of class I molecules to Tc. bm14 DC are capable of directly activating H-Y-specific Lyt-2+ Tc memory cells without the need for L3T4+ Th. These biologic effects of DC can at least in part be explained by their very high class I MHC expression. Moreover, these results reiterate that class I MHC Db mutants and different APC can be used to study the contribution of specific class I domains to Tc recognition and restriction specificity.\r"

Cells capable of IL-4 production in lymphoid populations freshly isolated from mice were rare in comparison with those producing IL-2 when the cells were stimulated by nominal Ag, by alloantigens, or by mitogens. One cycle of in vitro Ag restimulation and rest, however, enabled us to detect high proportions of IL-4-secreting cells among keyhole limpet hemocyanin-primed lymph node cells. With cultures set up at monoclonal cell doses, it was shown that IL-2 and IL-4 are secreted by separate precursor populations at this stage of their development. The IL-4-secreting cells were further shown to be dependent upon the presence of IL-2, either secreted by separate precursors or exogenously added, for the production of detectable amounts of IL-4. Analysis of the frequencies of helper cells producing both IL-2 and IL-4 at various stages of the in vivo immune response and the requirements for their growth and differentiation should give a better understanding of the relative contributions of each cell type.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the properties which enable type 2 Ag, as exemplified by dextran and Ficoll, to stimulate high levels of antibody responses in the relative absence of T cells, we conjugated anti-IgD and anti-IgM mAb to both dextran and Ficoll and examined their B cell-activating properties. Such conjugated anti-Ig antibodies stimulated both early and later stages of B cell activation at picogram concentrations, which are at least 1000-fold lower than that required for B cell stimulation by unconjugated anti-Ig antibodies, and the level of proliferation they stimulated was on average 10-fold greater. Furthermore, concentrations of anti-Ig dextran (100 pg/ml) which modulated little sIgD from the B cell surface were strong inducers of enhanced B cell expression of MHC class II molecules. Conjugation of Fab fragments of anti-IgD or nonmitogenic anti-IgM mAb to dextran rendered them as mitogenic as dextran conjugated to strongly stimulatory anti-IgD or anti-IgM antibodies. The ability of dextran and Ficoll to serve as effective carrier molecules for anti-IgD was not related solely to their large m.w., because anti-IgD coupled to polymerized BSA (m.w. 1.5 X 10(6), was only 10- to 50-fold more potent than unconjugated anti-IgD antibodies at stimulating B cell DNA synthesis. These results suggest, therefore, that the unique ability of picogram concentrations of haptenated type 2 Ag to stimulate Ig secretion in the absence of T cells may be a function of their ability to promote effective cross-linking without resulting in the modulation of sIg. This would enable such Ag to mediate repetitive B cell signaling, a situation that cannot be achieved by unconjugated anti-Ig antibodies which result in modulation of sIg at their mitogenic concentrations. These compounds therefore may be employed to study B cell activation stimulated by sIg cross-linking at concentrations that may more closely reflect those which are achieved under physiologic conditions by type 2 Ag.\r"

  ".W": "Genetically related susceptibility for experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis was investigated in nine inbred strains of rats immunized with heterologous acetylcholine (AChR) from Torpedo californica. Wistar Munich and Fischer strain animals consistently developed severe, fatal disease associated with impaired neuromuscular transmission and increased sensitivity to low doses of curare. A lower incidence of disease was induced in Wistar Kyoto, ACI, Brown Norway, Buffalo, and Lewis strain animals. In contrast, Wistar Furth and Copenhagen strain animals were resistant to experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis, electrophysiologic responses were normal, and animals were insensitive to curare. All strains of animals manifested equivalent amounts of serum antibody to AChR and total muscle AChR was reduced to the same extent in both resistant and susceptible animals. In contrast, the amount of antibody-bound AChR was greater in susceptible Wistar Munich animals than the amount observed in resistant Wistar Furth animals. These data suggest that impaired neurotransmission is correlated with the extent of antibody binding to the AChR. The discordance in the amount of antibody bound to the AChR of resistant and susceptible animals may result from heritable differences in antibody properties. Cross-breeding experiments with Wistar Munich and Wistar Furth animals show that resistance for development of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis is recessive and indicate that disease susceptibility is linked to one or two genetic loci.\r"

These clones proliferated in response to stimulation with HSV in the presence of autologous APC. The HSV type specificity of the proliferative response was identical with that of the cytotoxic activity of the clones. The cytotoxic activity and the proliferative response were both inhibited by addition of anti-HLA-DR mAb to the culture. After culture of these CTL clones with autologous B cells and macrophages followed by HSV Ag stimulation, anti-HSV antibody was detected in the culture supernatant. The HSV type specificity of the helper function for antibody production was identical with that of the cytotoxicity, i.e., HSV-type common clones, upon stimulation with either HSV-1, or HSV-2, and HSV-1-specific clones, upon stimulation with HSV-1 but not with HSV-2, showed helper activity for anti-HSV antibody production by autologous B cells. Moreover, it was found that these clones produced humoral factors which help autologous B cells to produce antibody. The helper factors were produced by T cell clones in an HSV-type-specific manner. These data suggest that some CD4+ T cells can simultaneously manifest both specific cytotoxicity and helper activity for Ag-specific antibody production by B cells, and that these multifunctional T cells might play an important role in protection against viral infection.\r"

Substantial levels of IL-2 responsiveness were induced in T8+ cells by lectin, Con A, mAb directed against the CD3 Ag, OKT3, Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin or phorbol ester, PMA. In contrast, none of these stimuli was by itself sufficient for the induction of IL-2 responsiveness in the T4+ subset. The latter cells could, however, be induced to respond to IL-2 by combinations of PMA plus either of Con A, OKT3, or ionomycin (but not any combination of Con A, ionomycin, and OKT3). These data indicate that induction of IL-2 responsiveness in the resting T4+ subset is more complex, possibly requiring two intracellular activation signals, increase in the concentration of intracellular Ca2+ and activation of protein kinase C, whereas either signal may directly trigger IL-2 responsiveness in the resting T8+ cells. The data further suggest that under optimal conditions, growth of both resting T4+ and T8+ subsets may be independent of monocytes.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether the production and secretion of TNF and IL-1 by human mononuclear phagocytes could be independently modulated, we examined secretion of TNF and IL-1 by fresh monocytes and monocytes pretreated with IFN-gamma or granulocyte macrophage CSF before LPS stimulation. TNF and IL-1 secretion were in part differentially modulated. Fresh monocytes secreted large amounts of TNF and IL-1 after LPS stimulation and less than 6% as much without LPS. The capacity to secrete TNF in response to LPS decreased slightly in cultured monocytes but was markedly augmented by IFN-gamma (approximately five-fold more than fresh monocytes). In contrast, cultured monocytes secreted less than 5% as much IL-1 as fresh monocytes and, although augmented by IFN-gamma, IL-1 secretion remained much less than by fresh monocytes. These differences in modulation were reflected by differences in the molecular mechanisms regulating TNF and IL-1 secretion. TNF secretion was regulated primarily by changes in the duration of increased transcription and by an apparent increase in translation or protein stability in response to LPS; greater than 95% TNF produced was secreted under all conditions. In contrast, the changes in IL-1 secretion reflected primarily post-transcriptional regulation of IL1-alpha mRNA, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of IL-1 beta mRNA and a decrease in the fraction of IL-1 secreted by cultured compared with fresh monocytes (10 and 60%, respectively). Changes in translational efficiency or protein processing or stability appeared not to be important mechanisms regulating IL-1 secretion. Additional evidence that TNF and IL-1 can be differentially modulated was the selective decrease in TNF secretion and the failure of IFN-gamma to enhance TNF secretion by cultured monocytes from neonates, whereas results for IL-1 were similar with adult and neonatal monocytes. Results with tissue macrophages were similar to those with cultured monocytes. These results indicate that TNF and IL-1 production and secretion by mononuclear phagocytes can be differentially modulated, reflecting in part different mechanisms of regulation; this may allow them to play partially independent roles in the host immune response.\r"

BS had active lupus nephritis in 1982 and developed central nervous system lupus in 1986 without evidence of active nephritis. Two rabbit polyclonal anti-Id (BS-82 and BS-86 R-anti-Id) were raised against affinity-purified anti-DNA antibodies prepared from 1982 serum (BS-82) and 1986 serum (BS-86), respectively. In addition, murine monoclonal anti-Id was prepared against BS-82 Id. Direct binding assays showed that all three anti-Id had preferential binding to the immunizing anti-DNA antibodies (the homologous Id) and poor binding to anti-DNA antibodies prepared from the different dated sample of BS. This was confirmed by inhibition assays of binding of anti-Id to the homologous Id by various Id. Moreover, inhibition assays of binding of various Id to DNA by the R-anti-Id showed that the R-anti-Id was the most effective inhibitor for the homologous Id. Testing for Id expression in serial (1982 to 1986) serum samples of BS with the R-anti-Id as probes showed that BS-82 Id declined and was undetectable after October, 1984, whereas BS-86 Id was first detectable in July, 1985, and increased by June, 1986. These results clearly demonstrate spontaneous shifts in Id expression of human anti-DNA antibodies. The phenomenon of Id shift should be considered in any future strategy for the diagnosis and therapy of human autoimmune disease by anti-Id.\r"

One of these T sites, (NANP)n, is also the immunodominant B epitope on the CS protein. We took advantage of this fact to directly compare the effects of neonatal peptide administration on B and T cell function and observed that mice whose helper and proliferating T cells were tolerant to (NANP)n nevertheless produced normal levels of anti-(NANP)n antibodies after immunization with keyhole limpet hemocyanin-(NANP)n. Our results demonstrate differential susceptibility of the Th cells and B cells to toleragens and suggest that self-tolerance to peptide epitopes during the neonatal period reflects predominantly Th cell tolerance.\r"

The PBL containing mRNA for IFN-alpha 2 or -beta 1 were clearly identified by RNA-RNA in situ hybridization by using 35S-labeled alpha 2- and beta 1-probes. Although the two inducers gave similar levels of IFN in the culture medium (about 20 U/10(4) PBL), the patterns of expression of mRNA at the cellular level differed. The HSV induced only IFN-alpha mRNA in the PBL, with a lag of 1 to 2 h, and with a peak frequency of about 10 labeled cells/10(4) PBL at 6 h. Grain counts were high, the majority of cells having more than 50 grains. They were morphologically medium to large lymphocytes. The HSV-infected glutaraldehyde-fixed fibroblasts therefore induce IFN-alpha 2 mRNA in infrequent but highly efficient PBL, each cell capable of producing as much as 2 antiviral units of IFN-alpha. In contrast, SV induced both IFN-alpha 2 and -beta 1 mRNA in PBL, and without clear lags. IFN-beta 1 mRNA-positive PBL peaked somewhat earlier (4 h) than cells containing IFN-alpha 2 mRNA (6 h), and their mean frequencies were approximately 80 and 60/10(4) PBL, respectively, in a panel of PBL from six blood donors. Grain counts were lower than with the HSV inducer, the majority of cells having less than 50 grains, and most labeled cells were morphologically monocytes. The frequency of labeled PBL rapidly decreased with increasing culture time with both the SV and HSV inducers, was low at 12 h and almost absent at 24 h.\r"

  ".W": "The nature of the in vitro human cytotoxic T-cell responder population to HSV type 1 (HSV-1) was studied. In 5-day HSV-1-stimulated cultures that contained MHC-restricted activity, two phenotypically distinct populations of cells were present that were capable of lysing HSV-1-infected B cell lines in a 5-h 51Cr-release assay. The first was CD4+, CD8-, CD16- cell typical of class II-restricted T cells, whereas the other population bore a CD4-, CD8-, CD16+ NK-cell phenotype. Elimination of the NK cell fraction from bulk cultures by using anti-CD16 plus C frequently resulted in cell populations that killed in an Ag-specific, HLA-DR-restricted fashion. In some cases the anti-CD16-pretreated cultures retained a killing population that was unrestricted to MHC products. In no instance were any cytotoxic T cells that were restricted to class I Ag in evidence. Limiting dilution analysis of precursor frequency indicated that about 1 in 4000 to 1 in 8000 cells from peripheral blood are specific for HSV-1 in seropositive individuals. Comparisons of HLA class I-matched and HLA class II-matched targets with the autologous target by using limiting dilution analysis yielded results entirely consistent with those obtained in the bulk culture assay system.\r"

Transfection of the Ly-3 gene into mouse L cells results in cell surface expression of Ly-3 protein only in the presence of Ly-2 (or its human homolog, CD8), although Ly-2 surface expression is not similarly dependent on Ly-3. cDNA clones encoding Ly-3 have been isolated and sequenced and show little sequence similarity to Ly-2, whereas both Ly-2 and Ly-3 are homologous to Ig variable regions. One cDNA clone encodes a form of Ly-3 lacking a transmembrane region. Although two alleles of Ly-3 have been previously defined serologically, Northern blot analyses of Ly-3 mRNA from a series of inbred mouse strains show unusual polymorphisms in the lengths of Ly-3 mRNA species defining at least three allelic variants of this gene.\r"

  ".U": "88199020\r", 
  ".W": "The NKH1 Ag is expressed on all cells in human peripheral blood capable of mediating spontaneous non-MHC restricted cytolytic function (i.e., natural killing). The majority of NK cells do not express CD3 Ag and do not express TCR gene products. However, approximately 20 to 25% of NKH1+ cells coexpress CD3 and TCR proteins. Both NKH1+CD3+ and NKH1+CD3- effectors can proliferate in response to IL-2 which also results in enhancement of cytolytic function. In the present studies, we examined thymocytes after incubation with rIL-2 for the presence of NKH1+ cells and for the development of non-MHC restricted cytolytic function. NKH1+ cells and NK activity could not be detected in fresh thymus. After culture with rIL-2 only, NK activity appeared in 3 days, reached a maximum after 7 days, and was effective against a panel of NK-sensitive targets. NK activity was correlated with the expression of NKH1 on the surface of in vitro proliferating thymocytes and immunofluorescent cell sorting demonstrated that almost all cytolytic activity was mediated by NKH1+ cells. As expected given the thymic origin of these cells, the majority of NKH1+ cells in culture expressed CD3. However, all cultures contained NKH1+CD3- effector cells which represent 15 to 40% of the NKH1+ population. As in peripheral blood, both NKH1+CD3- and NKH1+CD3+ exhibited non-MHC-restricted cytotoxicity, but only CD3+ effectors could be inhibited by anti-T3 mAb. These findings demonstrate that rIL-2 alone can induce subpopulations of thymocytes to proliferate, to express the NKH1 marker and become NK active in vitro. Furthermore, they suggest that the thymus which plays a role in the differentiation of NKH1+CD3+ NK effectors may also play a role in the differentiation or maturation of NKH1+CD3- NK effectors.\r"

Decreases in toxicity are due in part to the steric constraints imposed on the two macromolecules, which result in both decreased antibody binding and toxin function. In examining the structural features that influence efficacy in holotoxin-antibody conjugates, it was found that the incorporation of a 29-residue polypeptide, derived from the insulin B chain between the antibody and ricin moiety, resulted in an increase in both potency and efficacy. In a murine model system, potency of the peptide spacer conjugate was increased nearly 10-fold; however, when examined by the procedure used to purge bone marrow, the peptide spacer conjugate was not demonstrably more toxic to nontarget cells than the nonspacer conjugate. Thus, in addition to increases of efficacy and potency, this novel immunotoxin demonstrated increased specificity by approximately 10-fold. To test the general utility of peptide spacer inclusion, a T101-ricin conjugate was constructed with the peptide spacer. It yielded a protein synthesis inhibition rate of -0.6 log/h on MOLT-3 cells, greater than 10-fold more efficacious than a previously constructed nonspacer T101-ricin conjugate examined under similar conditions.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of the current study was to characterize lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) activity induced with IL-4/B cell stimulatory factor-1 and to compare IL-4-induced LAK activity with IL-2-induced LAK activity. Culture of murine lymphocytes with high concentrations of IL-4 induced nonspecific lytic activity against a wide variety of tumors. Lytic activity induced by IL-4 increased with increasing concentrations of IL-4 over the range of 1.0 to 25 ng/ml. The kinetics of LAK induction by IL-4 and IL-2 were similar; however, IL-4 was less effective than IL-2 in maintaining lytic activity for longer culture periods and provided lower viable cell yields than did IL-2. Similar to IL-2, IL-4 induced blastogenesis and the generation of large granular lymphocytes, all LAK activity observed was exclusively associated with the large granular lymphocyte fraction, and the cytolytic effector cells were heterogeneous in regards to cell surface phenotype. The majority of IL-4-induced lytic activity was associated with mutually exclusive NK-like (i.e., NK-1.1+ Lyt-2-) and T cell-like (i.e., NK-1.1- Lyt-2+) LAK cells. The precursors for each subset were distinct and expressed the asialo-GM1+ Lyt-2- and the asialo-GM1+ Lyt-2+ phenotypes, respectively. Although IL-4-induced LAK effector cells were morphologically and phenotypically similar to IL-2-induced LAK cells, IL-2 generated equivalent numbers of T cell-like and NK-like LAK cells, whereas IL-4 generated 3.5-fold more T cell-like LAK cells than NK-like LAK cells. It might eventually be possible to exploit the preferential activation of T cell-like LAK by IL-4 for therapeutic advantage.\r"

Responding cells were T cells as judged by immunofluorescence staining. In vivo Ag-primed PBL were stimulated in vitro with specific Ag and further propagated in the presence of IL-2. Subsequent Ag-specific T cell proliferation required the presence of Ag-pulsed peripheral blood adherent cells (APC). T cell responses were restricted by the MHC of the APC; Ag presented by allogeneic APC did not support T cell proliferation. By using MHC-recombinant chicken lines, the gene products controlled by MHC class II loci were shown to restrict the T cell-APC interaction. This conclusion was substantiated by the inhibition of the Ag-specific T cell response by a mAb against chicken MHC class II gene products but not by a mAb against chicken MHC class I gene products.\r"

In contrast, peritoneal B cells from NZB and BALB/c mice were stimulated to incorporate tritiated thymidine by each of the phorbol esters, PMA and phorbol dibutyrate, acting alone. Stimulation of peritoneal B cells was apparent when cells were cultured at lower than usual cell densities, and responses were unaffected by coculture with splenic B cells. Responding cells adhered to plastic petri dishes coated with anti-mouse IgM antibody, but were not completely removed by treatment with anti-Ly-1.2 antibody plus C. These results indicate that phorbol esters constitute a complete signal that stimulates some peritoneal B cells to enter S phase.\r"

Lyt-2+ cells were appreciably more effective at suppressing tumor growth than unseparated T cells, and no protection was seen with injection of L3T4+ cells (except in the late states of tumor growth). It is suggested that class I alloantigens on the tumors are directly immunogenic for Lyt-2+ cells. Without need for help from L3T4+ cells, the responding Lyt-2+ cells rapidly differentiate into cytotoxic cells and destroy the tumor cells before macroscopic tumors can arise.\r"

The Fab/Fc fragment consists of a single Fab linked to Fc, and can interact with C and cellular Fc receptors. Although injection of BALB/c mice with either intact H delta a/1 or H delta a/1 Fab/Fc enhanced splenic B cell sIa expression, Ia expression was enhanced more by intact H delta a/1. Furthermore, injection of mice with 24G2, a mAb to the B cell and macrophage IgG2b Fc receptor, completely blocked the ability of 20 to 500 micrograms of H delta a/1 Fab/Fc to enhance B cell sIa expression, but had no effect on enhancement of B cell sIa expression by 100 micrograms of intact H delta a/1. This effect of 24G2 was mediated by its blocking of IgG2b receptor function rather than simply by its binding to B lymphocytes, since a mAb to the B cell IgE receptor did not interfere with the ability of H delta a/1 Fab/Fc to enhance B cell sIa expression. The different effects of 24G2 on B cell activation by intact H delta a/1 and H delta a/1 Fab/Fc were not a result of differences in the abilities of the intact antibody and its Fab/Fc fragment to activate B cells, since 24G2 did not interfere with the ability of AMS-15, a IgG2a anti-IgD mAb, to slightly increase B cell sIa expression. These observations indicate that a univalent ligand for B cell sIg can activate B lymphocytes in vivo through an IgGFc-IgGFc receptor-dependent interaction.\r"

  ".W": "Lymphocytes have surface receptors for a variety of hormones that play an important part in modulating the immune response. Most previous studies, however, have examined the effects of hormone agonists on heterogeneous bulk populations of cells, making it difficult to precisely identify the responding target cells. We have therefore studied a set of well characterized T cell clones for a series of adenylate cyclase-linked hormone receptors and examined changes in receptor expression that occur after cell activation. All clones tested had receptors for histamine, isoproterenol, and PGE1, but not for several other cAMP-active hormone agonists. The apparent receptor affinities and their specificities were characteristic of typical histamine H2, beta 2-adrenergic, and PGE receptors. The cAMP response to PG was higher and longer lasting than that to histamine or isoproterenol, both of which appear to undergo receptor desensitization. After activation of quiescent cells in IL-2-containing media, the cAMP response to all three ligands increased, peaking 4 to 5 days after stimulation, and then returned to basal levels as the cells ceased proliferating. Inasmuch as this effect did not require Ag, it appears that the coordinate regulation of responsiveness to these ligands is a direct result of lymphocyte activation. This increase in hormone receptor activity is functionally analogous to the up-regulation of receptors for other ligands that occurs after lymphocyte activation and further demonstrates the important immunoregulatory role played by the changing repertoire of surface receptors that is associated with activation.\r"

DNA binding protein found on the cell surface of human leukocytes; mAb 12A has an IgG1/k isotype, and mAb 24T has an IgG2b/k isotype. Both react with the DNA binding domain or adjacent region of the putative DNA receptor and inhibit the binding of [3H]DNA to PBMC at concentrations as low as 100 ng/ml. Stoichiometric studies indicate that both mAb react with monocytes and T cells with a kDa of 10(-7) M; about 0.5 x 10(6) molecules bind per cell at saturation. Flow cytometry indicated that 67% of lymphocytes and 98% of monocytes bore the DNA receptor. Dual labeling studies showed that 90% of B cells and 50% of T cells express the receptor; 50% of CD4+ T cells are receptor positive. Immunomatrices constructed with both mAb 12A and 24T allowed the receptor to be purified to a high degree of purity. A single protein of Mr 30,000 was readily observed after SDS-PAGE and silver staining of the gel; after electropheretic transfer of nitrocellulose this protein was shown to be a DNA binding molecule by use of a probe of biotin labeled DNA. These experiments provide further evidence to support the existence of a specific DNA receptor on human leukocytes; the availability of mAb to the receptor should be useful in its further characterization.\r"

Early treatment with mAb GK1.5 (days -1, 0, and +1 relative to virus injection) resulted in death, encephalitis, and increased demyelination in the majority of animals tested. Treatment with mAb 2.43 resulted in less meningeal inflammation and fewer demyelinating lesions in the spinal cord, irrespective of whether the mAb was given early or after demyelinating disease was established (days 15, 16, and 17). Beneficial response to mAb therapy did not correlate with titers of virus isolated from the central nervous system or serum.

Our previous studies have demonstrated that in vitro anti-Sm production in MRL/1pr mice requires the presence of T cells. In the present investigation, these T cells were found to express the L3T4+/Lyt-2- phenotype, unlike the aberrant L3T4-/Lyt-2-\"double negative\" 1pr T cells, and to utilize the L3T4 determinant in generating help for the anti-Sm response. The generation of anti-Sm did not require the presence of Sm-specific Th cells, as help could also be provided by T cells activated to an irrelevant Ag, or by nonspecific factors such as IL-2. There was no evidence for suppressor cell regulation of anti-Sm, even in animals negative for this specificity. These studies indicate that ongoing production of anti-Sm in MRL/1pr mice is dependent on the presence of T cells with a normal mature surface phenotype, and that these cells act in part through the elaboration of lymphokines. They further show that the anti-Sm status of individual MRL/1pr mice is not due to the action of suppressor cells. Because T cells appear to act primarily in a permissive fashion for the anti-Sm response, it is likely that events underlying the initial generation of Sm-specific B cell precursors are critical in determining whether an individual animal develops the Sm serologic specificity. Once these cells have arisen, clonal expansion of Sm-specific B cells may proceed in the presence of activated T cells or some of their products.\r"

Neurotensin (NT) is present in the lung and it has been shown to bind to mouse peritoneal macrophages and influence their phagocytic ability. In this study, the effect of NT on the production of IL-1 by rat alveolar macrophages (AM) has been investigated. Although NT did not stimulate the release of IL-1 or increase the apparent intracellular pool of IL-1 when incubated with AM, there was significant cell changes, such as increased adherence, spreading, and altered shape. Furthermore, when AM were stimulated with LPS, both the intracellular and extracellular pools of IL-1 were significantly increased by NT. This effect was dose dependent and was observed at concentrations ranging from 10(-11) to 10(-6) M. NT did not modify the kinetics of LPS-induced IL-1 release nor the effects of a given suboptimal concentration of LPS. The release of IL-1 by various inducers, including muramyl dipeptide (MDP) and zymosan was also enhanced by NT, suggesting a general modulator role for this neuropeptide. When NT was added concomitantly with other potentiators of IL-1 production, such as IFN-gamma and leukotriene B4, no synergistic effect on IL-1 release was seen. Kinetics experiments showed that optimal enhancement of IL-1 production occurred when AM cultures were preincubated with NT before addition of MDP or when NT and MDP were present together at the initiation of the 24-h AM cultures. Taken together, our data suggest that NT acts early in the induction process of IL-1. Because IL-1 plays an important role both in the initiation of the immune response and in the local manifestations of inflammation, NT released in the vicinity of pulmonary blood vessels and the respiratory epithelium may modulate immunologically relevant responses in the lung microenvironment.\r"

  ".W": "BALB/c mice were sensitized to lethal effects of human rTNF-alpha and of human rIL-1 alpha by simultaneous treatment with sublethal doses of actinomycin D (Act D) or D-galactosamine (GalN). In contrast, treatment with sublethal doses of TNF or IL-1 themselves resulted in desensitization of the mice to the lethal effect of these cytokines: mice injected with TNF or IL-1 in the absence of Act D or GalN responded to a second injection of TNF or IL-1, this time together with Act D or GalN, by a significantly delayed death, or even survived. Desensitization developed rapidly (0.5-1.0 h) and abated 24 to 48 h postinjection. Each of the two cytokines induced hyporesponsiveness to its own lethal effect as well as to that of the other. Injection of TNF or IL-1 at sublethal doses resulted also in hyporesponsiveness to the lethal effect of LPS on mice primed with bacillus Calmette-Guerin, an effect which most likely is mediated by TNF and IL-1 produced in those mice in response to the LPS. TNF and IL-1 in combination had an additive effect both in lethality and in desensitization of the mice. These findings suggest that some of the deleterious effects of TNF and IL-1 are modulated by antagonistic mechanisms; mechanisms which can be suppressed by sensitizing agents, specifically by agents inhibiting the synthesis of RNA or protein; but which, in the absence of such agents, are found to be augmented in response to TNF and IL-1, thus resulting in desensitization.\r"

The portion of the Fc region of IgG1 responsible for stimulation of IL-1 secretion appears to be located within the C gamma 3 domain of the molecule. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the biologically active pepsin-derived pFc' subfragment is located within the C gamma 3 domain and the long-term papain digests containing predominately Fc' are also active. In contrast, short term papain digests containing mostly intact Fc fragments were found to be unable to induce IL-1 secretion.\r"

We examined these issues by separating Peyer's patch (PP) B cells into membrane IgA (mIgA)-positive and mIgA-negative cells with panning or cell sorting. When LPS was used to activate these cells, mIgA-positive PP B cells were induced by IL-5 (either as crude T cell supernatant or rIL-5 to secrete large amounts of IgA. In contrast mIgA-negative PP B cells showed no significant amount of IgA secretion with IL-5. In addition, rIL-5 did not cause expression of mIgA by mIgM-bearing B cells. The mechanism involved in enhancement of IgA secretion was evaluated by utilizing an ELISPOT assay to quantitate IgA secreting cells. Both unsorted PP B cells and mIgA-positive PP B cells, when incubated with IL-5, showed an increase in the number of IgA-secreting cells that was proportional to the increase in total secreted IgA. However, LPS-activated PP mIgA-positive B cells, when incubated with rIL-5, showed no increase in proliferation, as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation indicating that the increase in IgA-secreting cells after incubation with IL-5 occurred not as a result of proliferation but rather through promotion of terminal differentiation. Thus, IL-5 acts as a differentiation factor on B cells which have already undergone isotype switch to IgA B cells, promoting differentiation into IgA-secreting cells with resultant increased IgA secretion.\r"

In the murine system, IL-6 indirectly supports the formation of several different types of hemopoietic colonies, including those derived from early blast cells, and directly supports the proliferation of granulocyte/macrophage progenitors. These results expand the range of known target cells of IL-6 to include hemopoietic progenitors in addition to B cells, T cells, and fibroblasts and provide further evidence that this cytokine plays an important role within a network of interacting cytokines that regulates many different biologic responses.\r"

  ".W": "Internal images of foreign Ag have been demonstrated in a variety of systems as anticipated by the idiotypic network theory formulated by Jerne. However, they seem to be of rare occurrence. In order to estimate the actual frequency of antibodies bearing internal images (Ab2-beta) of angiotensin II (AII), a phylogenetically conserved peptide made up of eight amino acids, nine rabbits were immunized with affinity or protein A purified anti-AII antibodies (Ab1) from allotype-matched rabbits. Four of nine antiidiotypic antibodies (Ab2) exhibited internal image-like reactivity. They recognized all the polyclonal Ab1 tested, whatever the species (rabbit, mouse, guinea pig). In addition, they were strongly reactive with three mAb specific for a carboxy terminus epitope on AII (mAb 110, 199, and 211) and with a fourth monoclonal Ab1 (133) identifying a more central epitope. Advantage was taken of this reactivity with mAb1 to purify Ab2-beta by affinity chromatography of Ab2 on Sepharose 4B covalently linked to the three monoclonal Ab1 specific for the carboxy terminus epitope. The eluate displayed typical internal image properties: 1) it reacted with all the polyclonal Ab1 tested, 2) this reaction was completely abolished by AII, and 3) rabbits and mice immunized with the eluate all produced Ab1. The AII related idiotypic network is thus characterized by high frequency and immunogenicity of AII internal images. In addition, reactivity of the latter with monoclonal Ab1 indicates variable expression on Ab2-beta of the epitopes defined by the mAb on the nominal Ag.\r"

  ".W": "Although the structural basis of internal images borne by beta type monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibody (Ab2) begins to be elucidated, there is little information on the repertoire of epitopes which make up the internal images expressed by polyclonal Ab2. We addressed this question by using a two-way approach in the angiotensin II (AII)-related idiotypic network, a system characterized by common occurrence of internal images on rabbit Ab2. First, two sets of internal images were purified in parallel by affinity chromatography on Sepharose 4B covalently linked to either mAb 110 (S4B-110), a mAb specific for a phenylalanine requiring carboxy terminus epitope (Phe8) on AII, or mAb 133 (S4B-133), reactive with a more central epitope also expressed on Phe8 substituted peptide analogs. The respective eluates, EL1 110 and E11 133, exhibited only partially overlapping reactivity, as demonstrated by 1) a different pattern of inhibition by various AII peptide analogues of EL1 110 and E11 133 binding to the same anti-AII antibody (Ab1) (either the homologous polyclonal Ab1 102 or mAb 133), 2) and a distinct profile of EL1 110 and EL1 133 binding to 12 biotinylated monoclonal Ab1 identifying a variety of epitopes on AII. To analyze further the respective distribution of mAb 110 and mAb 133 defined epitopes on Ab2-beta molecules, Ab2 were submitted to sequential affinity chromatography on S4B-110 followed by S4B-133, and the fractionated internal images were characterized by the pattern of binding to the various monoclonal Ab1. It was thus possible to purify two Ab2-beta subpopulations that exclusively imaged the determinant identified by mAb 110 (ii 110) or that identified by mAb 133 (ii 133). A third subpopulation which was successively retained on S4B-110 and S4B-133 expressed both internal images (ii 110 + 133), and was additionally reactive with all the other monoclonal Ab1 tested. In any case, monoclonal Ab1 binding to the different sets of internal images was totally inhibited by an excess of AII. These results indicate that the repertoire of internal epitopes is similar to that of the nominal Ag, but is scattered over distinct subpopulations of Ab2-beta molecules that can be fractionated by affinity chromatography. Some of the latter seem to bear several epitopes and resemble the whole nominal Ag, whereas others appear to image only one determinant. Second, we raised 7 anti-anti-idiotypic mAb (monoclonal Ab3) against affinity-purified Ab2-beta and analyzed their fine specificity for AII.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Mouse IL-3-dependent bone marrow culture-derived mast cells (BMMC) and mouse 3T3 fibroblasts, cultured separately or together, were examined for their cell surface expression and biosynthesis of globopentaosylceramide, a marker of the mouse serosal mast cell. As assessed by flow cytometric analysis, BMMC cultured for up to 7 wk in 50% WEHI 3-conditioned medium containing IL-3 did not bind the B1.1 anti-globopentaosylceramide mAb (six experiments). A total of 10 +/- 4% (mean +/- SD, three experiments) of 3T3 fibroblasts that had reached confluence in medium without IL-3 bound B1.1 antibody and, after an additional approximately 28 days of culture in that medium or in 50% WEHI 3-conditioned medium, 12 +/- 3% (mean +/- SD, five experiments) and 16 +/- 7% (mean +/- SD, three experiments) of the cells, respectively, bound the antibody. After coculture of BMMC and confluent 3T3 fibroblasts for 28 days in 50% WEHI 3-conditioned medium, followed by dispersal and purification of the cells, 92 +/- 18% of the mast cells and 92 +/- 16% (mean +/- SD, seven experiments) of the fibroblasts were B1.1+. Whereas the increase in the expression of the epitope bound by B1.1 antibody on fibroblasts was noted by day 14 of coculture, expression of the epitope on mast cells did not occur until day 21 (three experiments). Biosynthesis of globopentaosylceramide was assessed by intrinsic radiolabeling of each cell population and identification of the extracted neutral glycosphingolipids by TLC and autoradiography. Synthesis of globopentaosylceramide was not detected in extracts of 9 x 10(6) BMMC, 1 x 10(6) confluent 3T3 fibroblasts cultured alone for 28 days, or 9 x 10(6) mast cells purified from 28-day cocultures but was readily detected in extracts of 3 x 10(5) fibroblasts purified from the same cocultures. These findings indicate that BMMC stimulate an increase in the synthesis and expression of globopentaosylceramide on 3T3 fibroblasts and suggest that the subsequent appearance of this neutral glycosphingolipid on the surface of the mast cells is due to its secretion by fibroblasts and adsorption to the mast cell surface. Thus, the interactions between mast cells and fibroblasts during coculture alter the biochemical and Ag phenotypes of both populations.\r"

The results indicate that 1) in cell surface TCR-CD3- cell lines (MOLT 3, CCRF-CEM), TCR-beta, but not alpha-chains are present intracellularly. TCR-beta-CD3 complexes are readily found in these cell lines, but no evidence for final processing or cell surface expression of such incomplete TCR-CD3 complexes is observed. 2) In the cell surface TCR+CD3+ cell line HPB-ALL, both alpha- and beta-chains are present intracellularly. Whereas non-glycosylated forms of TCR-beta chain can be detected, only more mature forms of TCR alpha-chains are detected indicating that the alpha-chains are more rapidly glycosylated than the beta-chains. 3) The large majority of the intracellular alpha- and beta-chains is not disulfide linked and a small fraction of these is associated with CD3. 4) Only small amounts of the total intracellular TCR chains are found as CD3-associated disulfide-linked alpha beta-heterodimers. 5) Final processing of TCR chains for cell surface expression takes place after formation of these TCR-alpha beta-CD3 complexes. Thus, both the TCR alpha- and beta-chains are over-produced and only relatively small amounts of these chains form CD3-associated heterodimers that are processed for cell surface expression. Analogous results were obtained with a non-leukemic CTL clone. Based on these observations, a model for the biosynthesis and assembly of the TCR-CD3 complex is presented.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis that cytokines mediate neutrophil emigration induced by endotoxin (LPS) was studied by examining the potency, the kinetics of neutrophil emigration, and the tachyphylaxis of intradermal sites with IL-1, TNF-alpha and LPS. Human rIL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta, synthetic lipid A, and LPS were several orders of magnitude more potent than human rTNF. The kinetic profiles of neutrophil emigration induced by IL-1 alpha, TNF, and LPS were characterized by minimal emigration in the first 30 min, followed by rapid and transient emigration. After the injection of LPS, the onset and the time at which the rate of emigration was maximal consistently appeared 30 min later than IL-alpha or TNF, suggesting that neutrophil emigration in response to LPS was mediated by a locally generated cytokine. IL-1 and TNF were then examined as potential secondary mediators of LPS-induced emigration by comparing the patterns of tachyphylaxis between LPS and IL-1 alpha or TNF; i.e., the magnitude of neutrophil emigration into inflammatory sites was compared with sites injected 6 h previously (desensitizing injections) with a cytokine or with LPS. Tachyphylaxis was dose dependent with each and also between the IL-1 species; therefore, when tachyphylaxis between the cytokines and LPS was examined, relatively higher doses were selected for the desensitizing injections than for the test injections. With this approach, desensitizing injections of IL-1 alpha diminished the neutrophil accumulation after LPS, and LPS also desensitized sites to IL-1 alpha. However, tachyphylaxis was not observed between TNF and LPS, or between TNF and IL-1 alpha. These data suggest that IL-1, but not TNF, is a potential mediator of LPS-induced neutrophil emigration.\r"

In the former response the H-2Kb class I MHC molecule is used as CTL restriction element, in the latter response the H-2Db molecule. B6 dendritic cells (DC) are superior in the presentation of Sendai virus Ag to CTL in comparison with B6 normal spleen cells. Con A blasts have even less capacity to present viral Ag than NSC, and LPS blasts show an intermediate capacity to present viral Ag. H-2Kb mutant bm1 mice do not generate a CTL response to Sendai virus, but respond to Moloney leukemia virus, as demonstrated by undetectable CTL precursors to Sendai virus and a normal CTL precursor frequency to Moloney virus. Compared to B6 mice, other H-2Kb mutant mice show decreased Sendai virus-specific CTL precursor frequencies in a hierarchy reflecting the response in bulk culture. The Sendai virus-specific CTL response defect of bm1 mice was not restored by highly potent Sendai virus-infected DC as APC for in vivo priming and/or in vitro restimulation. In mirror image to H-2Kb mutant bm1 mice, H-2Db mutant bm14 mice do not generate a CTL response to Moloney virus, but respond normally to Sendai virus. This specific CTL response defect was restored by syngeneic Moloney virus-infected DC for in vitro restimulation. This response was Kb restricted indicating that the Dbm14 molecule remained largely defective and that a dormant Kb repertoire was aroused after optimal Ag presentation by DC. In conclusion, DC very effectively present viral Ag to CTL. However, their capacity to restore MHC class I determined specific CTL response defects probably requires at least some ability of a particular MHC class I/virus combination to associate and thus form an immunogenic complex.\r"

Host responses to Nb infection including spontaneous elimination of adult worms, development of intestinal mucosal mast cell hyperplasia and the generation of a polyclonal IgE response were all completely blocked by 0.5 mg anti-L3T4 antibody administered simultaneously with Nb inoculation. However, administration of 0.5 mg of anti-Lyt-2 antibody at the same time and 7 days after inoculation with Nb had no effect on any of these responses. Injection of anti-L3T4 antibody as late as 9 days after Nb inoculation interfered with spontaneous cure of Nb infection and anti-L3T4 antibody injection 11 days after Nb inoculation inhibited serum IgE levels measured on day 13 by 50%. In addition, administration of anti-L3T4 antibody at the time of the peak serum IgE response, 13 days after Nb inoculation, accelerated the decline in serum IgE levels. Injection of previously Nb-infected mice with anti-L3T4 antibody at the time of a second Nb inoculation prevented the development of a secondary IgE response but did not affect immunity to Nb infection based on finding no adult worms in the intestines of these mice. These data indicate that 1) L3T4+ T cells are required for spontaneous cure of Nb infection, development of intestinal mucosal mast cell hyperplasia, and the generation and persistence of an IgE response during primary infection with Nb and 2) L3T4+ T cells are required for a considerable time after inoculation for optimal development of these responses. However, L3T4+ T cells are not required for all protective responses in immune mice. In contrast, our data indicate that considerable depletion of the Lyt-2+ T cell population has no significant effect on either worm expulsion or the generation of serum IgE responses.\r"

The data show that CD2-specific messages are present in low quantities in resting PBMC and are rapidly increased by five- to sevenfold within 24 h of addition of optimal amounts of PHA. Similar induction of CD2 mRNA was seen after stimulation of PBMC with anti-CD3 mAb and PMA. Peak levels of CD2 message were maintained until 72 h post-stimulation and declined gradually thereafter. Despite stimulation with Staphylococcus aureus and PMA, purified B cells failed to demonstrate any CD2 mRNA. Unlike transferrin or IL-2R mRNA, Il-2 had no effect on the accumulation of CD2 messages in resting or PHA-stimulated PBMC. The time course of CD2 mRNA accumulation preceded lymphocyte proliferation and the appearance of additional cell surface CD2 Ag. The decay of CD2 mRNA was very rapid, with a t 1/2 of approximately 45 min. The protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, increased its half-time by fourfold to 3.5 h. The data imply the existence of a labile factor, dependent on protein synthesis that is important in the regulation of CD2 mRNA. Compared to other PHA-inducible lymphocyte genes, the kinetics of CD2 transcript accumulation are most reminiscent of the oncogenes N-ras and c-abl.\r"

In humans, three subregions, DP, DQ, and DR, of the class II genes as well as the DZ alpha and DO beta genes, have been extensively characterized. Although homologs of these human genes were identified in many species, their expressibility has not been well defined in species other than the mouse. We have previously cloned the rabbit homologs of the HLA-DP alpha and beta genes whose protein products had never been detected. The sequences of rabbit DP alpha 1 and DP beta genes are reported herein and they indicate that the rabbit DP genes encode functional alpha- and beta-chains. Unfavorable nucleotides surrounding the first AUG codon may, however, reduce the translational efficiency of the R-DP beta mRNA and explain the difficulty in generating serologic reagents specific for rabbit DP molecules. A complex mutation in the beta 1 domain of the R-DP beta gene was similar to the one found in the H-2A beta 1 gene of five strains of mice. The origin of this mutation is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "We demonstrate in the B16 melanoma (C57BL/6 derived) system that the soluble form of tumor Ag preferentially suppresses immune responses 1) by inhibiting CTL activity in the effector phase and 2) by induction of specific Ts that block CTL generation in the induction phase. Soluble melanoma antigen Ag injected i.p. into the tumor-bearing host can effectively augment melanoma growth in vivo. Two T cell types with the L3T4+ or double-negative/I-J+ phenotype are involved in the suppression of anti-melanoma CTL responses and can easily be generated in the in vitro primary 12 h-culture. Anti-melanoma Ts recognizes the GM3(NeuAc) structure and distinguishes GM3 molecular species. This is because liposomes constructed with GM3(NeuAc) but not with GM3(NeuGc) gangliosides alone can effectively induce the melanoma-specific Ts. It is thus likely that tumor cells can escape from the immunologic surveillance system by stimulating the repertoire of Ts for self-Ag, GM3, which has existed even in the unprimed conditions in order to maintain self-tolerance. These would appear to be the major escape mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of anti-CD3 mAb on MHC-unrestricted cytotoxic activity of NK depleted PHA-activated human T cells were examined. Anti-CD3 mAb had variable effects on killing of K562 or Daudi targets. Whereas lower concentrations of OKT3 often inhibited lysis of either target, higher concentrations (greater than 1 micrograms/ml) frequently increased K562 killing and always augmented Daudi lysis. However, lysis of the renal cell carcinoma, Cur, was consistently inhibited by OKT3 over a broad concentration range. Such variable effects were not related to differential regulation of heterogeneous subsets of effector cells, as similar patterns of OKT3-mediated modulation of tumor cell lysis by T cell clones was also observed. Another IgG2a anti-CD3 mAb, 64.1, and either F(ab')2 fragments of OKT3 or intact OKT3 in the presence of aggregated human Ig were found to inhibit lysis of Cur, K562, and Daudi targets consistently. Additional experiments were carried out to determine whether modulation of CD3 accounted for the inhibitory effects of the anti-CD3 mAb. PMA was noted to cause modulation of CD3 from the surface of PHA or alloantigen-activated T cells, and the combination of anti-CD3 and PMA caused even more marked modulation of CD3. Whereas preincubation with PMA and/or anti-CD3 decreased alloantigen-specific cytotoxic T cell function in relative proportion to the loss of CD3 expression, no consistent relationship between CD3 expression and the capacity of PHA-activated T cells to kill Cur targets was noted. PMA alone caused no consistent alteration of Cur lysis. Moreover, in the presence of PMA, anti-CD3 mAb caused no significant inhibitory effect on Cur lysis, in spite of increased modulation and in some cases virtual total loss of surface CD3 expression. These findings indicate that when FcR interactions are prevented, anti-CD3 mAb consistently inhibit MHC-unrestricted cytotoxicity by PHA-activated T cells. Despite this, the data support the conclusion that CD3/TCR complex interactions with target cells are not required for either target cell recognition or triggering of lysis by MHC-unrestricted cytotoxic T cells.\r"

Augmented NK activity peaks by 24 h after FAA injection and returns to normal after 6 days. Combined treatment of established murine renal cancer with FAA and rIL-2 results in up to 80% long term survival whereas FAA or rIL-2 alone were unable to induce any long term survivors. The optimal dose of rIL-2 required for use with FAA was in the range of 10,000 to 30,000 U/day. Further studies demonstrated that the regimen of FAA plus rIL-2 administration that was effective in treating established murine renal cancer also induced a more potent augmentation of NK activity than did either FAA or rIL-2 alone. Subsequent studies revealed that the therapeutic effectiveness of FAA plus rIL-2 was significantly reduced when tumor-bearing mice were treated with anti-asialo GM1 serum. These results are consistent with a role for augmented NK activity in the therapeutic effects of FAA plus rIL-2 murine renal cancer. In addition, these studies demonstrate that FAA and rIL-2 is a useful approach for cancer treatment in that subtoxic doses of rIL-2 can be used and significant anti-tumor efficacy occurs even without accompanying adoptive immunotherapy.\r"

The monoclonal IgM significantly inhibited sarcoma growth when given to the mice after inoculation with Moloney murine sarcoma/leukemia virus, and also potentiated the in vivo antibody response specific for M-MuLV Ag. These responses were significantly greater than the primary response to the virus alone in age- and sex-matched control mice, and were also seen in mice which were injected with the IgM antibody only and not with virus, suggesting that an Ag-independent mechanism may be involved. The M-MuLV-specific serum antibody responses induced by the monoclonal IgM, with or without prior virus inoculation, were predominantly of the IgG1 isotype, with some IgG2a; no other isotypes were found to have titers significantly higher than in the normal response to virus alone. M-MuLV-specific IgG1 was detected only in mice injected with monoclonal IgM, and not in the response to virus alone. The same sera also had high titers of anti-idiotypic antibodies, (Ab2), as well as anti-anti-idiotypic antibodies (Ab3). It appears, therefore, that passive immunization with M-MuLV-specific IgM mAb activates an idiotypic network, which results in both Ab2 and Ab3 responses; the M-MuLV-specific response may be considered a subset of Ab3.\r"

Developing an in vitro model to study this process has proved difficult due to the lack of an appropriate target cell that will express HSV antigens but is not simultaneously subject to viral induced cell death. The purpose of this study was to develop a model in which keratinocytes express cell surface HSV specific antigens but at the same time are protected from death due to viral infection. We found that keratinocytes infected with HSV in the presence of acyclovir (ACV) expressed such antigens yet remained viable for a period of time after the onset of antigen expression such that cytotoxicity studies could be successfully performed. Rabbit skin cells, a transformed keratinocyte line, or second passage human neonatal foreskin keratinocytes were grown in culture medium with or without 200 microM ACV and were infected with HSV. Examination by direct immunofluorescence with anti-HSV antibody revealed uniform HSV antigen expression by cells both with and without ACV by 8 h after infection. Cells infected without ACV exhibited marked structural abnormalities including formation of multinucleated giant cells, while cells with ACV showed fewer such changes throughout a 24-h period. An Ethidium Bromide-Acridine Orange cytotoxicity assay demonstrated significant increases in the cytotoxicity of infected cells not protected by ACV compared to that of cells with ACV (p less than .001). This in vitro model should prove useful in the investigation of HSV specific immune mediated cytotoxicity.\r"

  ".W": "The association of dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) with granular IgA deposits at the dermal-epidermal junction and a gluten sensitive enteropathy (GSE) suggests that a mucosal immune response may play an important role in the pathogenesis of DH. The degree of antigenic restriction, the immunoglobulin class and subclass response to dietary antigens, and the relationship of antibodies against dietary antigens to IgA-containing circulating immune complexes (CIC) in patients with DH, however, are not known. We have examined the serum of 33 patients with DH for IgG and IgA antibodies against gliadin, and against 3 dietary proteins not thought to be related to GSE, beta-lactoglobulin (beta-lacto), bovine gamma globulin (BGG), and casein. Eleven of 33 (33%) patients with DH had IgA anti-gliadin antibodies, whereas IgA antibodies against beta-lacto were found in 11 of 33 patients (33%), against BGG in 15 of 32 (47%), and against casein in 6 of 33 (18%); 17 of 32 (53%) patients had IgA antibodies against one or more of these dietary antigens. Significantly higher levels of IgA antibodies were detected against beta-lacto (2,500 +/- 2,320 ng/ml, mean +/- SEM) and BGG (2,340 +/- 1,890 ng/ml) than gliadin (1,250 +/- 851 ng/ml) in this group of antibody positive patients (p less than 0.05, Wilcoxon signed ranks test). Eleven of 17 patients with IgA antibodies against dietary antigens were found to have IgA-containing CIC, whereas only one of the 15 antibody negative patients had IgA-containing CIC (p = 0.0008, Fisher's exact test). IgA anti-gliadin antibodies were found to contain both IgA1 and IgA2 with a significantly increased proportion of IgA2 when compared with the IgA2 composition of the total serum IgA (IgA2: anti-gliadin antibodies = 34 +/- 4.2%; total serum IgA = 19 +/- 4.8%, p = 0.02, Students paired t test). IgG antibodies against these antigens were found to occur slightly more frequently in amounts not significantly greater than IgA antibodies. This data demonstrates that a serum IgA and IgG antibody response to dietary antigens occurs in approximately 50% of DH patients with a higher proportion of IgA2 than total serum IgA and does not appear to be restricted to gliadin. This is significantly different from the pattern of cutaneous immunoreactants in patients with DH, and suggests that the deposition of IgA in DH skin may be the result of an atypical mucosal immune response, a non-immunologic interaction of IgA1 and DH skin, or arise from a non-mucosal source.\r"

To evaluate the diffusion of the vascular proliferation in HIV-infected patients, we studied the number of vessels within the superficial dermis of clinically uninvolved skin by an indirect immunoperoxidase method. We used an antibody directed against VWF in skin biopsies from 20 LAS patients and 10 AIDS-related KS patients compared to 11 controls and 10 classical KS patients. An increase in the number of blood vessels in normal skin was found in LAS (p less than 10(-2)), classical KS (p less than 0.05), and AIDS-related KS (p less than 10(-2]. Statistical studies and comparisons between plasma and cutaneous values of VWF indicate that plasma VWF is a good marker of endothelial damage but a poor marker of vascular proliferation in HIV-infected patients.\r"

Stimulation of thymidine incorporation was associated with increased nuclear labeling after 22 h in the presence of bFGF under the same conditions used in the thymidine incorporation assay. bFGF was nearly as effective as epidermal growth factor (EGF) in stimulating keratinocyte growth and substantially less effective than crude placental extract, and was not additive with EGF in stimulating thymidine incorporation or proliferation of cells. The findings indicate that bFGF is a potent growth factor for keratinocytes.\r"

Outgrowth occurred only in cultures from patients who had antibodies to the viral capsid antigen of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The proliferating cells also contained EBV nuclear antigen, an occurrence confirming that proliferation was a result of latent EBV infection of the donors. Supernatants from these cell lines were tested for autoantibodies by screening against normal tissues. About 30% of the cell lines made autoantibodies, many of which reacted with smooth muscle or epithelial cells. Because EBV is harbored in a latent form in the majority of the adult population, reactivation of latent EBV infection in vivo may explain the production of autoantibodies seen in a variety of immunoregulatory disorders.\r"

One form of non-Alzheimer dementia may be designated as dementia of frontal lobe type (DFT), on the basis of a characteristic neuropsychological picture suggestive of frontal lobe disorder, confirmed by findings on single photon emission tomography. The case histories of seven patients exemplify the disorder: a presentation of social misconduct and personality change, unconcern and disinhibition, in the presence of physical well-being and few neurological signs. Assessment revealed economic and concrete speech with verbal stereotypes, variable memory impairment, and marked abnormalities on tasks sensitive to frontal lobe function. Visuo-spatial disorder was invariably absent. Comparisons of DFT and Alzheimer patients revealed qualitative differences in clinical presentation, neurological signs, profile of psychological disability, electroencephalography, single photon emission tomography and demography. DFT, which may represent forms of Pick's disease, may be more common than is often recognised.\r"

The active X is always the X that does not carry the gene defect. To determine if this were also true in carriers of atypical XLA and to provide carrier detection for all women at risk of being carriers of XLA, we developed a technique that permits analysis of X chromosome inactivation in cells from any woman. This technique combines the production of somatic cell hybrids that selectively retain the active X chromosome with the use of X-linked restriction fragment length polymorphisms that permit the distinction of the two X chromosomes. Three obligate carriers of typical XLA and four women whose sons might be considered to have atypical or sporadic XLA were studied. B cell hybrids from all seven women demonstrated exclusive use a single X as the active X. In addition, B cell hybrids from four of eight women at 25% or 50% risk of being carriers exhibited nonrandom X chromosome inactivation, indicating that these women were also carriers of X-linked forms of hypogammaglobulinemia. These results illustrate a technique that can be used both to help define XLA and to provide carrier detection for all women at risk of being carriers of this disorder.\r"

Children enrolled in the study had previously received PRP or PRP plus diphtheria and tetanus toxoids with pertussis vaccine at 18 months of age. A control group of children, who received a first dose at 36 months of age, was also studied. Ninety-five percent of children receiving a second dose of vaccine had a postimmunization anti-capsular antibody level of greater than or equal to 1 microgram/mL. In comparison, 70% of 36-month-old children who received their first dose of PRP had a postimmunization level greater than or equal to 1 microgram/mL (P = 0.09). The geometric mean titer at 37 months of age was 8.64 micrograms/mL in children who had received two doses of PRP vaccine, compared with 2.19 micrograms/mL in the group who received only one dose of PRP at 36 months of age (P = 0.04). We conclude that infants immunized at 17 to 19 months of age with PRP had an excellent immunologic response to reimmunization at 36 months of age.\r"

  ".U": "88199884\r", 
  ".W": "Moderate taste aversions were induced by pairing the initial consumption of 0.25% sodium saccharin (SACC) with either 25 mg/kg i.p. l-5-hydroxytryptophan or 30 mg/kg i.p. LiCl. The expression of these moderate conditioned SACC aversions was antagonized by pretreatments (i.p. or p.o.) with benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic drugs (lorazepam, diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, oxazepam, phenobarbital, meprobamate, and chlormezanone). Chlordiazepoxide produced less or no antagonism of the expression of stronger SACC aversions induced by 50 or 75 mg/kg l-5-hydroxytryptophan or by 60 or 90 mg/kg LiCl. Nonanxiolytic drugs, including dipsogenic compounds that increased the water intake of hydrated rats (2 M NaCl i.p.; isoproterenol HCl s.c.; and histamine diphosphate s.c.), and even additional 24 hr of fluid deprivation did not antagonize the expression of moderate conditioned taste aversions, indicating that anxiolytic drugs have a very selective effect and that they do not appear to act through homeostatic drinking mechanisms. An essential feature of the taste aversion conflict model is that thirsty rats encounter only SACC. When water was conspicuously available in addition to SACC in two-bottle tests, neither chlordiazepoxide nor phenobarbital antagonized the expression of conditioned taste aversion. Thus, anxiolytic drugs do not produce amnesia for the conditioned aversion, but attenuate the ability of conditioned SACC aversion to suppress SACC consumption in one-bottle tests. The antagonism of the expression of conditioned taste aversion measured with a one-bottle testing method offers a simple, sensitive, and selective screen for anxiolytic drugs. A possible mechanism by which anxiolytics increase both suppressed as well as unsuppressed fluid consumption is discussed.\r"

For both strains ethanol maintained higher response rates and was consumed in larger volumes than the water vehicle. In addition, blood ethanol levels increased with increases in ethanol concentration. However, LEW rats drank substantially more ethanol than F344 rats. The typical inverted U-shaped function between ethanol concentration and number of deliveries was observed for the LEW rats, whereas for the F344 rats much smaller differences were seen between ethanol and water maintained responding. For the LEW strain, as the fixed-ratio size was increased, the number of responses increased almost in direct proportion to the fixed-ratio size increase, so that at least at the lower fixed-ratio values the rats were obtaining similar numbers of deliveries at different fixed-ratio sizes. However, a decrease in ethanol deliveries and blood ethanol levels was observed at higher fixed-ratio sizes. Similar results were obtained in F344 rats, but the amount of responding was lower and less consistent. LEW rats showed significantly higher response rates, numbers of ethanol deliveries and blood ethanol levels. Ethanol-induced behavioral activation also was observed in LEW rats, but not in F344 rats. These results support the conclusion that ethanol serves as a strong positive reinforcer for LEW rats and as a weak positive reinforcer for F344 rats, and that genotype is a determinant of the degree to which ethanol functions as a reinforcer.\r"

Changes in cytosolic calcium levels were measured using the fluorescence probe Quin 2. Both CRF and K+ raise cytosolic calcium levels by stimulating calcium influx. SRIF induced an immediate inhibition of CRF and K+-stimulated calcium influx. This effect was concentration-dependent with IC50 values for SRIF's blockade of CRF and K+ stimulation of 64 +/- 13 pM and 100 +/- 15 pM, respectively. The SRIF analogs, SRIF 28, Trp8-SRIF and Tyr11-SRIF had the same rank order of potency to block CRF and K+-induced calcium influx. The inhibitory effects of SRIF on AtT-20 cells were abolished by pertussis toxin pretreatment. SRIF inhibition of both CRF and K+-induced calcium influx desensitized. The desensitization was rapid (T1/2 approximately 2.5 min), dependent on the concentration of SRIF and not due to the degradation of the peptide. The ability of SRIF to block CRF (cyclic AMP-dependent) and K+ (cyclic AMP-independent)-stimulated calcium influx into AtT-20 cells cannot be separated.\r"

  ".W": "Using the technique of brain dialysis in freely moving rats we have investigated the effect of various dopamine (DA) receptor agonists on the release and metabolism of DA in two terminal dopaminergic areas, the nucleus accumbens and the dorsal caudate. Low doses of various DA receptor agonists such as apomorphine (12-100 micrograms/kg s.c.), LY 171555 (5-50 micrograms/kg s.c.), pergolide (5-25 micrograms/kg s.c.), (+)-3PPP (0.5-2.5 mg/kg s.c.) and BHT 920 (10-250 micrograms/kg s.c.) reduce DA release and elicit hypomotility. The potency of the drugs and their effectiveness is similar in the two areas. Inhibition of DA release appears related to the ability of the various agonists to stimulate D-2 rather than D-1 receptors. Thus, the reportedly selective D-1 agonist, SKF 38393, was inactive on DA release and metabolism even at doses fully active in eliciting D-1-mediated effects (grooming); on the other hand apomorphine, a D-1/D-2 agonist, and pergolide, a D-2 agonist with rather weak D-1 activity, reduced DA release in a manner which was related to their agonist activity at D-2 receptors; finally LY 171555, (+)-3PPP and BHT 920, which selectively stimulate D-2 receptors, were fully active at reducing DA release in vivo. Apomorphine, pergolide, LY 171555 and (+)-3PPP given at higher doses elicited behavioral stimulation. In contrast, BHT 920 failed to do so. In further contrast (-)-3PPP (0.1-10 mg/kg s.c.), which failed to reduce DA release at low doses, actually stimulated it at high doses (10 mg/kg s.c.) and elicited hypomotility, thus resembling DA receptor antagonists.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The positive inotropic effect of the alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine was accompanied by a concentration-dependent increase in inositol trisphosphate (IP3) in electrically driven left auricles isolated from rat hearts. Further analysis of the myocardial phosphoinositide pathway revealed an additional increase in inositol phosphate and inositol bisphosphate with a concomitant decrease in phosphatidylinositol phosphate and phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate. The decrease in phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate and increase in IP3 preceded the increase in force of contraction. All effects were antagonized by the alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin. For comparison the effects of the beta adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline were studied. Isoprenaline produced a positive inotropic effect similar to that of phenylephrine but all phosphoinositide products remained unaffected. The influence of lithium and calcium ions were studied systematically. The stimulatory effect of phenylephrine on inositol phosphates was lithium-dependent. Without lithium phenylephrine did not detectably affect the phosphoinositide turnover. Phenylephrine caused a maximal increase in inositol phosphate, inositol bisphospate and IP3 at 10 mmol/l of lithium. Lithium itself had a concentration-dependent positive inotropic effect. However, lithium did not enhance the positive inotropic effect of phenylephrine. Variation of the extracellular concentration of calcium did not influence the stimulatory effect of phenylephrine on inositol phosphates indicating that inositol phosphate turnover does not require the presence of extracellular calcium. It is concluded that the stimulation of myocardial phosphoinositide breakdown generating an increased IP3 turnover may be involved in the mechanism(s) whereby alpha-1 adrenoceptor stimulation exerts an increase in myocardial force of contraction.\r"

Comparison of initial and followup renal pathology showed that the activity index of the biopsy improved in 82%, while the chronicity index worsened in 71% of patients. Normalization of C3, but not anti-DNA levels, was associated with a lowering of the activity index on repeat biopsy. Prolonged depression of serum C3 levels was associated with a trend (p = 0.066) towards worsening of the chronicity index, but the change in chronicity index showed no relationship to the duration of elevated anti-DNA. Our studies indicate that abnormal levels of C3 complement are predictive of the degree of persistently active glomerular disease, but that duration of abnormal C3 or anti-DNA are less consistent predictors of the acquisition of chronic, irreversible renal lesions.\r"

Trypsin treatment of the nuclear substrate abrogated ANA staining for all sera tested, while RNase treatment abrogated ANA activity for 6 of 8 sera.

  ".W": "Subjectively healthy HLA-B27 positive 1st degree relatives (n = 14) of patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) were investigated concerning the mass fraction of calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), strontium (Sr) and copper (Cu) in isolated blood cells using the nuclear microprobe technique. No relative had laboratory signs of inflammatory disease defined by acute phase plasma proteins. An accumulation of Mg, Ca, Mn and Fe was found in granulocytes compared with healthy controls. In platelets there was an accumulation of Fe and a reduction of the Cu content. In erythrocytes Ca was accumulated and the levels of Mg, Mn and Cu were reduced compared with the controls. Five of the relatives had radiological signs of sacroiliitis and 1 of these had sacroiliac tenderness. Relatives with and without radiological sacroiliitis showed no differences in the cellular metal amounts. When the alterations were compared with those previously found in patients with AS, a striking similarity was noted, although the changes were quantitatively less pronounced. In contrast B27 negative 1st degree relatives (n = 11) had normal mineral amounts in their cells. However, it seems less likely that altered metal handling could play a primary role for the disease susceptibility linked to HLA-B27 since B27 positive healthy controls (n = 12) without AS in the family had normal cellular stores of the measured elements. Rather our findings indicate that redistribution of cellular metals is an extremely sensitive marker of an inflammatory process not evident by clinical symptoms or increase of acute phase plasma proteins.\r"

The broad first peak also contained substantial amounts of EGF-like activity as higher MW forms of EGF. The broad first peak was further fractionated by heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography. A major fraction with growth factor activity eluted at 1.5 M NaCl and this fraction was shown to contain bFGF by immunostaining with antisera prepared against synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acid sequences 1-12 (amino terminal), 33-43 (internal), and 136-145 (carboxy terminal) of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF).

  ".W": "Emergency coronary artery bypass grafting after failed elective percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty can be performed with acceptable complication rates. Recently, however, a new class of patients with unsuccessful angioplasty has evolved with the use of thrombolytic therapy and emergent angioplasty as treatment for developing acute myocardial infarction. The efficacy of surgical intervention after failure of angioplasty in this setting has not been demonstrated. This report compares the results of coronary bypass done emergently after either failed elective or failed emergent angioplasty. Between March 1984 and September 1986; 1350 angioplasty procedures were performed at our institution, 393 for acute myocardial infarction. Of the 111 patients who came to operation, 42 had had unsuccessful elective angioplasty and 69 unsuccessful angioplasty done in the clinical setting of an evolving acute myocardial infarction detected by electrocardiographic criteria. Twenty-one of the 42 patients having unsuccessful elective angioplasty (group I) and 32 of the 69 with unsuccessful emergent angioplasty (group II) underwent emergency coronary artery bypass grafting. A retrospective nonparametric statistical comparison of the two groups was performed. Age, preoperative ejection fraction, distribution of vessels undergoing angioplasty, and number of vessels bypassed were not statistically different. All group II patients received thrombolytic therapy, and a reperfusion catheter was used in over half the patients in each group. Three group I and six group II patients required a preoperative balloon pump, and half the patients in each group required postoperative inotropic support. One patient in group I (4.7%) and two patients in group II (6.2%) died (no significant difference). Only five patients in group I (23.8%) and 11 in group II (34.3%) had enzymatic and electrocardiographic evidence of an acute myocardial infarction at discharge. Six patients in group II (15.6%) required reexploration for bleeding, versus none in group I (p = 0.04). Nonhemorrhagic complication rates, mean in-patient and acute care days, total hospital charges, and blood product utilization rates were not statistically different. These data indicate that emergency coronary artery bypass grafting can be performed when necessary in the setting of failed emergent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with results comparable to coronary bypass after failed elective angioplasty.\r"

  ".U": "88201259\r", 
  ".W": "Early endotracheal extubation has been shown to be a safe postoperative management option in patients having cardiac operations. However, few objective data exist on the response of ventricular performance to early termination of controlled ventilation. Seven patients undergoing routine elective coronary artery bypass grafting or adult repair of atrial septal defect were studied after intraoperative placement of left ventricular micromanometers, left ventricular minor axis dimension crystals, and left atrial and intrapleural pressure catheters. Physiologic data were recorded intraoperatively, during controlled mandatory ventilation in the intensive care unit, and during spontaneous respiration immediately after extubation. Extubation to spontaneous breathing was associated with a significant decline in intrapleural pressure and significant increases in left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, ejection diameter shortening, stroke work, and cardiac output. The augmented left ventricular diastolic filling seemed to result from the fall in intrapleural pressure and perhaps from normalization of right ventricular afterload. The preload recruitable stroke work relationship showed that myocardial contractility remained constant after extubation, and ventricular function improved primarily because of increased preload associated with shifting of the capacitance blood volume toward the chest. Thus endotracheal extubation enhances cardiac performance after uncomplicated cardiac surgical procedures, and by this mechanism early extubation may be clinically beneficial as a routine adjunct to postoperative care.\r"

Blood and tissue cultures were positive in four of five patients. Two-dimensional echocardiograms demonstrated moderately large vegetations on the three affected native valves and the patch and also revealed the development of vegetation on the mitral bioprosthesis as the disease progressed. All the patients were successfully treated by combined surgical and medical therapy, the latter consisting of co-trimoxazole, tetracycline, and streptomycin/gentamicin for 6 weeks; the affected valves and the ventricular septal defect patch were all replaced. There were no operative deaths and there has been no recurrence of infection to date. One patient died suddenly of an unknown cause 1 year after the operation.\r"

With a mean stimulation of 24.7 Hz, no episodes of interference, inhibition, or reprogramming of the pacemakers occurred. The proximity of the stimulation site to the pulse generator had no effect. We did not study electrodes placed parallel to the pacemaker electrode vector, a position that has been of concern to others and that should probably be avoided until proved safe.

Possibly, factors in addition to endolymphatic hydrops must be present to result in a crisis episode. By placing animals in an inverted posture, their intralabyrinthine pressure was elevated, causing additional stress on the inner ears. Standard electronystagmographic techniques were used to monitor vestibular imbalance, which appeared as spontaneous nystagmus in the dark. Nineteen of 23 animals with unilateral endolymphatic hydrops showed spontaneous nystagmus in an inverted posture. Physiologic mechanisms explaining these results are described.\r"

Here we report that comparison of the structure of myc from a ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast and from normal breast tissue of the same patient (Sc) revealed a tumour-specific rearrangement of one myc locus and amplification of the other myc locus. (For myc reviews see refs 1-4; for myc involvement in breast neoplasia see refs 5-7.) Within the second intron of the rearranged locus was a non-myc sequence with nearly complete homology to a long interspersed repetitive element (a LINE-1 sequence or L1).

Variables reviewed were mental status, neurological examination, presence or absence of loss of consciousness, clinical evidence of basilar skull fracture, and fracture on skull radiography. The neurological examination (including mental status and Glasgow coma scale) in the emergency room was the best predictor of subsequent deterioration or the presence of an operative hematoma. The only patients with Glasgow coma scale scores of 15 who required surgical evacuation of an extraaxial hematoma had focal neurological deficits referable to hemispheric compression, with or without an abnormal mental status. A Glasgow coma scale score of 13 or 14 places the patient at risk either of having a hematoma requiring surgery or of deteriorating. We recommend that a head CT scan be obtained on all patients with Glasgow coma scale scores of less than 15, abnormal mental status, or hemispheric neurological deficits. If no operative lesion is found on the CT scan, the patient should be admitted for observation because there is still a risk of deterioration. Those with a Glasgow coma scale score of 15, a normal mental status, and no hemispheric neurological deficit may be discharged to be observed at home by a competent observer despite basilar or calvarial skull fracture, loss of consciousness, or cranial nerve deficit. No benefit was gained from skull radiography in any group.\r"

A case is presented in which a large AVM was preoperatively embolized and later resected. There was clear intra- and postoperative evidence of edema and hemorrhage, which resulted in a fatal outcome. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) data from this patient obtained with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) both before and after embolization were compared with data from four patients with similar size supratentorial AVMs treated and studied in a similar protocol who did not develop perfusion breakthrough. Pretreatment hemispheric rCBF was significantly reduced in this patient's ipsilateral hemisphere (50 ml/100 g/min) compared to the control group mean (83 +/- 9.5 ml/100 g/min). A similar relative depression was found in the contralateral hemisphere. After therapeutic embolization, the ipsilateral rCBF increased by 33 ml/100 g/min and the contralateral hemispheric rCBF increased by 30 ml/100 g/min; this embolization-induced increase in rCBF was significantly higher than in the control group. Acetazolamide, known to increase rCBF in normal tissue by 35 +/- 3%, resulted in a 56% augmentation of ipsilateral hemispheric flow before embolization in the reported patient vs. a 22 +/- 10% increase for the control group. Postembolization, this hyperresponsiveness to acetazolamide remained unchanged. It is possible that these hemodynamic derangements may indicate a dissociation between the vasoconstrictive and vasodilatory reactivity in chronically hypoperfused territories adjacent to AVMs such that pharmacological or metabolic stimuli may induce further vasodilation, but sudden redistribution of large volumes of flow will not promote protective vasoconstriction.\r"

The radiotherapy was given before the second operation in two cases and before the first operation in the other case. Irradiation doses administered with a linear accelerator were 2.34 to 3.0 Gy for 3 to 3.5 weeks, and radical operations were done 1.5 to 2 months after irradiation. After the irradiation, vertebral angiography showed moderate to marked decrease of the hypervascular capsular stain and disappearance of the early draining vein. Computed tomographic scan showed enlargement of the central necrotic area within the heterogeneously enhanced tumor, which was unchanged in size. Radical operations, which had been impossible because of uncontrollable massive bleeding, were successful without any intraoperative bleeding after radiotherapy. Postirradiation radiological findings corresponded well with those of histopathological examination, which showed decrease in cellularity and in vascularity and diffuse coagulation necrosis around the collapsed tumoral vessels as radiation effects. Preoperative irradiation of the hypervascular neurinoma was though to facilitate radical surgery by abolishing or diminishing the risk of intraoperative bleeding.\r"

Meningiomas of the posterior fossa commonly present with decreased or absent hearing and can appear deceptively similar to acoustic neurinomas on radiographic and audiometric testing. Because total restoration of hearing can occur with meningioma, even with significant preoperative deficit, utilization of the translabyrinthine approach is less desirable if any preoperative question as to the diagnosis exists. Any hearing-impaired patient with a cerebellopontine angle mass that is not conclusively thought to represent acoustic neurinoma should be approached by the suboccipital technique to maximize the opportunity for restoration of hearing.\r"

This syndrome has been attributed to recurrent obstruction of the ventricular catheter, which then causes an increase of intracranial pressure. Only rarely has the SVS been reported in adults. We describe a 29-year-old woman whose shunt malfunction presented with long-lasting paroxysmal hypersomnia and was diagnosed with computed tomographic evidence of small lateral ventricles. This episodic hypersomnia presented every 2 to 3 weeks and each episode lasted 1 to 2 weeks. After revision of the ventricular catheter, her symptoms stopped and she remained well.\r"

PET demonstrated the evolution of the metabolic abnormality resulting from intrahemispheric (lateral geniculate) and interhemispheric (splenium) disconnection in the absence of occipital lobe infarction.

The purpose of this study was to search for HSV type 1 (HSV-1) proteins in tissue sections of 132 oral squamous cell carcinomas and 56 age- and site-matched controls. All tissues were incubated in rabbit anti-HSV-1 serum with the use of a modified direct immunoperoxidase technique. More than 42% of the cancers, but none of the controls, reacted positively. Thirteen selected oral carcinomas that exhibited positive polyclonal staining were incubated with the use of a peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique with a mouse monoclonal antibody raised against the 89 kilodalton HSV-1 envelope protein. None of these tissues exhibited a positive reaction. Similarly, no unequivocal ultrastructural viral particles were found in 11 oral carcinomas that stained positively with the polyclonal antibodies. These results are interpreted to indicate partial expression of a noninfectious viral genome. The presence of this genome in a high proportion of lesions in this study lends strong statistical support to the oncogenic relationship between HSV-1 and oral squamous cell carcinoma.\r"

Application of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS, 1-2 min) on the peroneal nerve trunk at the head of the fibula resulted both in a pain relief and in the disappearance of the tonic activity in the muscles supplied by the antagonist nerve. Simultaneously, the Hmax/Mmax ratio decreased to normal values (49%). This was followed by an after-effect lasting more than 30 min. The potential role of an impairment of reciprocal inhibition in the originating mechanism of these troubles is discussed.\r"

Transforming function was measured in quail embryo cells transfected with cloned myc genes. We found that only myc genes with a promoter of a retroviral long terminal repeat (LTR) located between the native p-myc promoter and the second p-myc exon have transforming function. Transforming efficiencies decreased with increasing lengths of unspliced sequences between the LTR and p-myc exon 2. p-myc DNAs with LTRs downstream of the coding region or upstream but in the opposite transcriptional orientation failed to transform embryo cells. Likewise, only those retroviral-p-myc combinations from chicken B-cell lymphomas with a LTR positioned as promoter upstream of p-myc exon 2 had transforming function. We conclude that substitution of a retroviral LTR for the promoter and for as yet poorly defined, untranscribed regulatory elements of p-myc is sufficient to convert chicken p-myc to a transforming gene. However, retroviral LTRs can only convert p-myc genes to embryo-cell-transforming genes from a limited number of positions, and not as position-independent enhancers. Further, we deduce that there are two classes of viral chicken B-cell lymphomas, those with and those without embryo-cell-transforming p-myc genes.\r"

The entire nucleotide sequence of the gene reveals the existence of 11 exons interrupted by 10 small introns (76-427 base pairs). Putative regulatory sequences have been identified in the promoter regions as well as dispersed in the introns. The deduced amino acid sequence of the Nagao isozyme indicates that the mature molecule is composed of 513 amino acids, of which 12 residues are different from the sequence of PLAP (98% homology). A sequence derived from exon III of the Nagao isozyme gene was used to synthesize a peptide (NH2-Lys-Leu-Gly-Pro-Glu-Thr-Phe-Leu-Ala-COOH) that contains two mutations with respect to the corresponding PLAP sequence. This peptide elicited rabbit polyclonal antibodies that reacted specifically with the seminoma Nagao isozyme but not with PLAP in electrophoretic transfer blots. These results indicate that the tumor, and possibly the normal testis, Nagao isozyme is encoded by a gene referred to as germ-cell alkaline phosphatase gene that differs from the PLAP gene expressed by syncitiotrophoblastic cells.\r"

S1 nuclease protection experiments utilizing a MYC first exon probe demonstrated transcriptional deregulation of the MYC gene associated with the T-cell receptor alpha locus on the 8q+ chromosome of SKW-3 cells. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the translocation-associated (8q+) MYC allele identified a single base substitution within the upstream flanking region; the homologous nontranslocated allele contained an additional substitution and a two-base deletion. None of the deletions or substitutions localized to putative 5' regulatory regions. The MYC first exon sequence was germ line in both alleles. These results demonstrate that alterations within the putative 5' MYC regulatory regions are not necessarily involved in MYC deregulation in T-cell leukemias, and they show that juxtaposition of the T-cell receptor alpha locus to a germ-line MYC oncogene results in MYC deregulation.\r"

The start site for nifA mRNA synthesis was found to be the same during symbiosis and microaerobiosis, and a deletion analysis of nifAp demonstrated that DNA between positions -62 and -45 is essential for induction. Mutants isolated as being unable to induce nifA microaerobically also were found to be defective in symbiotic nitrogen fixation with alfalfa.

Cell line L-KbAla expresses the reciprocal mutant gene that has position 152 of the Kb molecule mutated from glutamic acid to alanine, leaving positions 155-156 unchanged. Electrophoretic mobilities of the mutant Kb molecules reflect only those changes predicted by the mutations. Mutant-specific (anti-Kbm1) and native-specific (anti-Kb) CTL lyse L-KbTyr-Tyr and L-KbAla target cells equally well. Unlabeled target inhibition of lysis revealed a pattern of recognition and inhibition that suggests that the amino acid differences between Kbm1 and Kb create at least two discrete determinants that can be recognized by different populations of CTL.

To determine if the failure of the B cells to produce immunoglobulin might be due to expression of the XSCID gene defect in B-lineage cells as well as T cells, we analyzed patterns of X chromosome inactivation in B cells from nine obligate carriers of this disorder. A series of somatic cell hybrids that selectively retained the active X chromosome was produced from Epstein-Barr virus-stimulated B cells from each woman. To distinguish between the two X chromosomes, the hybrids from each woman were analyzed using an X-linked restriction fragment length polymorphism for which the woman in question was heterozygous. In all obligate carriers of XSCID, the B-cell hybrids demonstrated preferential use of a single X chromosome, the nonmutant X, as the active X. To determine if the small number of B-cell hybrids that contained the mutant X were derived from an immature subset of B cells, lymphocytes from three carriers were separated into surface IgM positive and surface IgM negative B cells prior to exposure to Epstein-Barr virus and production of B-cell hybrids. The results demonstrated normal random X chromosome inactivation in B-cell hybrids derived from the less mature surface IgM positive B cells. In contrast, the pattern of X chromosome inactivation in the surface IgM negative B cells, which had undergone further replication and differentiation, was significantly nonrandom in all three experiments [logarithm of odds (lod) score greater than 3.0]. These results suggest that the XSCID gene product has a direct effect on B cells as well as T cells and is required during B-cell maturation.\r"

To derive an animal model that will allow us to define some of these phenomena at the molecular level, we have chosen to induce the expression of a viral oncogene in all tissue types, with the hope of identifying sites that are more susceptible to malignant transformation. When the gene for simian virus 40 large tumor antigen (T antigen) was placed under the control of a major histocompatibility complex class I gene enhancer, the resulting transgenic mice not only developed choroid plexus papillomas, as seen with wild-type simian virus 40, but also lymphoid hyperplasia and multiple endocrine neoplasias. The development of lymphoid hyperplasia was preceded by an elevated level of expression of T antigen in these tissues at an early age. Surprisingly, the striking thymic hyperplasia has not been observed to progress toward malignancy. The multiple endocrine neoplasias developed later in life and involved the pancreas, pituitary, thyroid, adrenals, and testes. While not preceded by an elevated level of expression of T antigen, once endocrine tumors appeared they quickly progressed toward malignant growth. Although other tissues also exhibited a basal level of expression of the viral oncogene similar to that detected in endocrine tissues, they rarely developed tumors. This transgenic mouse model seems particularly suitable for a molecular understanding of events responsible for certain tissue types being so much more susceptible to neoplastic conversion, with others being so refractory.\r"

Clear labeling of hemopoietic cells was observed in the bone marrow and spleen of mice injected intravenously with recombinant 125I-labeled Multi-CSF showing that injected Multi-CSF can obtain access to such cells in situ. A high proportion of injected 125I-labeled Multi-CSF of both types became localized in the liver and in the kidney (in cells of the Bowman's capsule and proximal renal tubules). The kidney appeared to be an active site of degradation of Multi-CSF with the early appearance of low molecular weight labeled material in the urine.\r"

  ".W": "Mutations in human lymphocytes are commonly due to gene deletion. To investigate the mechanism of deletion for autosomal genes, we immunoselected lymphocytes mutated at the HLA-A locus and cloned them for molecular analysis. Of 36 mutant clones that showed deletion of the selected HLA-A allele, 8 had resulted from a simple gene deletion, whereas 28 had resulted from a more complex mutational event involving reduplication of the nonselected HLA-A allele as indicated by hybridization intensity on Southern blots. In 3 of the 28 clones, retention of heterozygosity at the HLA-B locus indicated that the reduplication was due to recombination between the two chromosomes 6; but in the remaining 25 clones, distinction could not be made between recombination and chromosome reduplication. The results indicate that mutations in normal somatic cells frequently result in hemizygosity or homozygosity at gene loci and, thereby, resemble the mutations thought to be important in the etiology of various forms of cancer.\r"

DNA from RF/J thymic lymphomas induced by N-methyl-N-nitrosourea was then examined serially as the tumors were passaged in vivo and adapted to growth in culture as uncloned and, in some cases, cloned lines. Patterns of Tcrb-specific restriction fragments from most tumors changed extensively during continued propagation. Analysis of the patterns often suggested that initial DNA rearrangements within the Tcrb complexes of monoclonal tumors had been followed by further rearrangements within the same genes. However, these different patterns may alternatively have represented successive outgrowth of separate lineages from lymphomas that were polyclonal in origin.\r"

  ".U": "88203682\r", 
  ".W": "The effect of Ca2+ upon the rate constant of force redevelopment following a period of isotonic shortening with immediate restretch to the starting sarcomere length was studied in rabbit psoas fibers at 5 degrees C. Control experiments support the assumption that the rate constant of force redevelopment represents isometric cross-bridge turnover kinetics (fapp + gapp), where fapp and gapp are the rate constants characterizing the transitions from the non-force-generating states to the force-generating states and back to the non-force-generating states, respectively. Parallel measurements of the rate constant of force redevelopment and of force, stiffness, and fiber ATPase during isometric contraction allow the effect of Ca2+ upon fapp and gapp to be determined. Analysis reveals that Ca2+ has a marked effect upon fapp, while gapp remains approximately unchanged. Furthermore, in the range above 25-30% of maximum Ca2+ activation, regulation of force, stiffness, and ATPase is mediated through changes in fapp. Below this range, however, it cannot be ruled out that, in addition, cross-bridges are also switched in and out of the turnover process (\"recruitment\"). As a consequence of regulation through turnover kinetics, both Ca2+ sensitivity and the slope of force-pCa (-log[Ca2+]) relations are shown to be affected by the ratio fapp/gapp, which may represent an important mechanism of modulation of contractile function in addition to modulation through changes within the regulatory protein system.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty patients who had undergone anterior cruciate ligament reconstructive surgery were placed randomly and independently in an Electrical Stimulation Group (n = 10) or Voluntary Exercise Group (n = 10) to compare the effectiveness of these two muscle-strengthening protocols. Patients in both groups used simultaneous contraction of quadriceps femoris and hamstring muscles during a training regimen that consisted of either voluntary exercise or electrical stimulation trials five days a week for a three-week period within the first six postoperative weeks. After patients completed the training regimen, bilateral maximal isometric measurements of gravity-corrected knee extension and flexion torque were obtained for both groups and percentages were calculated. Results showed that patients in the Electrical Stimulation Group finished the three-week training regimen with higher percentages of both extension and flexion torque when compared with patients in the Voluntary Exercise Group (extension: t = 4.35, p less than .05; flexion; t = 6.64, p less than .05). These results indicate that patients in an electrical stimulation regimen can achieve higher individual thigh musculature strength gains than patients in a voluntary exercise regimen when simultaneous contraction of thigh muscles is prescribed during an early phase of postoperative rehabilitation.\r"

Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity of these azurophilic granules, as assessed by cytochemical staining, is unusually intense. In addition, M3 is universally associated with a chromosomal translocation, t(15;17)(q22;q11.2). In this report, the MPO gene was localized to human chromosome 17 (q12-q21), the region of the breakpoint on chromosome 17 in the t(15;17), by somatic cell hybrid analysis and in situ chromosomal hybridization. By means of MPO complementary DNA clones for in situ hybridization and Southern blot analysis, the effect of this specific translocation on the MPO gene was examined. In all cases of M3 examined, MPO is translocated to chromosome 15. Genomic blot analyses indicate rearrangement of MPO in leukemia cells of two of four cases examined. These findings suggest that MPO may be pivotal in the pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia.\r"

The regimens were 3 grams of ticarcillin plus 100 milligrams of clavulanic acid given intravenously every four hours, or 600 milligrams of clindamycin given intravenously every six hours plus 3 to 5 milligrams per kilogram per day of gentamicin given intramuscularly. The diagnosis of endomyometritis was based upon an oral temperature of 100.4 degrees F. or higher on any two occasions, excluding the first 24 hours post partum, uterine tenderness and the absence of another focus of infection. Ninety-one patients were treated. Treatment failure rates were three of 49 in the clindamycin and gentamicin group and four of 42 of the ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid group. Treatment failures did not appear to be different from successes demographically or in risk factors for endomyometritis. The results of this study suggest that ticarcillin with clavulanic acid is as effective in the treatment of postcesarean endomyometritis as the standard regimen of clindamycin and gentamicin.\r"

Long-term CsA-treated CTA recipients that were assayed at various times prior to 100 days posttransplant also did not demonstrate any significant mixed lymphoid chimerism. However, following extensive CTA survival (greater than 100 days) significant mixed donor-host lymphocyte chimerism became evident in the peripheral blood, and in one recipient a large quantity of donor bone marrow remained viable in the ACI limb allograft at necropsy (greater than 200 days posttransplant).

Two patients (4%) sustained Q-wave myocardial infarctions. The mean duration of follow-up for the total group was 37 months (6 to 73 months). Of the 43 patients with successful dilation, 4 died, 1 had an non-Q-wave myocardial infarction and 8 had symptomatic restenosis (4 underwent successful repeat angioplasty, 1 had repeat percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and then bypass surgery, 1 had repeat bypass surgery alone and 2 had medical therapy).

Although 58 patients had symptomatic relief with the initiation of intensive medical therapy, 46 (44%) continued to have episodes of angina despite maximal tolerated triple-drug antianginal therapy as well as aspirin or heparin, or both. In-hospital mortality for the 104 patients was 4%. The incidence of myocardial infarction was 8%, and differed (p less than 0.01) for the medically responsive group (3%) vs the medically refractory group (13%). Based on clinical status and coronary anatomy, patients were referred for either bypass surgery (46%), coronary angioplasty (41%) or continued medical therapy (13%). Choice of therapy varied according to the extent of coronary disease, with coronary angioplasty attempted in 72% of patients with 1-vessel disease, 44% of patients with 2-vessel disease and 7% of patients with 3-vessel disease. Angioplasty was performed with an initial success rate of 88%, and compared favorably with bypass surgery in terms of in-hospital mortality (0 vs 11%), late mortality (2.8 vs 7.7%), freedom from angina (62 vs 69%) and subsequent employment (44 vs 27%) at 18 months follow-up. The favorable results of angioplasty in this prospective observational study suggest that additional randomized trials should be conducted in this important patient group.\r"

Abrupt reclosure occurred in 54 patients (4.7%), developing during the dilatation procedure in 43 patients (80%) and delayed by 11 +/- 2 hours after the procedure in 11 patients (20%). Patients were divided into 3 groups based on subsequent management: (1) 22 patients (40%) in whom the involved vessel was reopened by additional dilatation, (2) 14 patients (26%) in whom the involved vessel was not reopened but the patient was treated medically, and (3) 18 patients (33%) in whom abrupt reclosure was managed by emergency bypass surgery, yielding an overall emergency surgery rate of 1.6%. Patients whose abrupt reclosure was reopened were more likely to have luminal thrombus (54 vs 28%) and less likely to have extensive local dissection after dilatation (14 vs 61%; p less than 0.025) than patients undergoing emergency surgery. Patients treated medically despite continued vessel occlusion were more likely to have collateral blood flow to the occluded zone (54 vs 11%, p less than 0.01) than patients undergoing surgery.

  ".W": "Although percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) is being widely performed in patients with multivessel disease, the eventual role it will play will depend on several factors, including the immediate and long-term results, procedural risks and restenosis. An important consideration is that of completeness of revascularization. This is based on cardiac surgical experience, which has documented that if revascularization is complete, the clinical outcome will be improved. The importance of this concept has been borne out in practice. Although complete revascularization is ideal, it cannot be achieved in a substantial number of patients with multivessel disease because of the presence of old total occlusion that cannot be dilated, diffuse and distal disease or a planned dilation strategy. However, many patients with successful dilation but incomplete revascularization do well. In these patients, attempts are made to identify and then dilate a \"culprit\" lesion. Dilation of these most physiologically important stenoses often results in an excellent short-term outcome. Currently, 2 studies have been initiated to compare the role of PTCA with that of coronary artery bypass grafting for the treatment of patients with multivessel disease. For these studies, initial success and long-term outcome in terms of morbidity and mortality as well as cost considerations will be assessed. The results of these studies will help to put into perspective the complementary roles of PTCA and coronary artery bypass grafting.\r"

  ".W": "Prophylactic therapy to prevent the first variceal hemorrhage ceased being recommended for any cirrhotic because risks outweighed benefits. In this study, we identified cirrhotics that have never bled who are most prone to hemorrhage from varices. We developed a numerical grading system which combined size with other endoscopic characteristics, so varices would get an aggregate grade of 1 to 10. Varices were classified as either high grade (scored greater than or equal to 8) or low grade (scored less than or equal to 7). The grading system had a predictive value for bleeding when studied prospectively for a mean duration of 26 months in 52 patients subjected to placebo (15 patients) or various treatments (37 patients) in a randomized trial. High grade varices had a significantly higher association with bleeding than did low grade varices; 73% versus 7% (p less than 0.001) analyzing all 52 patients (of which 21% bled), and 83% versus 11% (p less than 0.05) analyzing the 15 placebo-treated patients (of which 40% bled). An esophagram positive for varices proved to be a sensitive screen for high grade varices, picking up 91% of them. However, it was a poor predictor of bleeding (one-third bled), since only 45% of radiologically evident varices were high grade. Since almost all cirrhotics with high grade varices can be expected to bleed within 2 yr, this group should be the focus of controlled trials to determine whether low risk prophylactic therapies reduce the incidence of first variceal hemorrhage.\r"

The cell surface phenotype of peripheral blood lymphocytes and synovial fluid lymphocytes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory joint diseases was analyzed by use of these and other well-characterized anti-T-cell monoclonal antibodies. In the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, there was a markedly decreased percentage of T4+2H4+ suppressor-inducer cells (3.1 +/- 1 percent) and an increased percentage of T4+4B4+ helper-inducer cells (29.1 +/- 9 percent) as compared with the proportions found in the peripheral blood of normal individuals (T4+2H4+: 19.0 +/- 6 percent, T4+4B4+: 23.0 +/- 7 percent). Moreover, patients with other chronic and acute inflammatory joint diseases exhibited highly similar synovial T-cell findings to those of the patients with rheumatoid arthritis (T4+2H4+: 4.2 +/- 3 percent, T4+4B4+: 33.1 +/- 9 percent). In contrast, there were no significant differences between the normal control subjects and patients with rheumatoid arthritis in the percentage of T4+2H4+ cells in peripheral blood lymphocytes, nor were there significant differences between normal control subjects, patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and patients with other joint diseases (osteoarthritis, gout, B27+ spondyloarthropathy, and psoriatic arthritis) in the number of T4+4B4+ cells or in the T4/T8 ratio of peripheral blood lymphocytes. However, very low numbers of T4+2H4+ (suppressor-inducer) peripheral blood lymphocytes were seen in a subgroup of patients, including five of seven with Reiter's syndrome and several patients with systemic rheumatic disease syndromes. In addition, although the percentage of T4+2H4+ cells in peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with osteoarthritis (13.7 +/- 7 percent) and gout (14.3 +/- 7 percent) was decreased compared with that of normal controls (19.0 +/- 6 percent) (osteoarthritis versus normal controls p less than 0.025), this difference appeared to reflect alterations due to age rather than disease. Consistent with the phenotypic changes observed, synovial T cells were also functionally defective, since autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction-activated T4 cells from the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis failed to exhibit suppressor-inducer activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A 66-year-old man with homozygous deficiency of factor VII (less activity than 4 percent of normal) had a minimal hemorrhagic tendency and severe coronary atherosclerosis, and underwent aortocoronary saphenous vein bypass surgery. Although plasma factor VII coagulant activity and cross-reacting material were markedly reduced, comparable amounts of factor VII antigen were detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of both the patient and of a normal subject by Western blotting techniques. Accelerated coagulation was observed following brief exposure of the patient's phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells to low concentrations of ambient factor VII in vitro. Evidence indicates that factor VII plays a role in vivo in both hemostasis and atherogenesis and it might be assumed that factor VII deficiency would both predispose to excessive bleeding and forestall atherosclerosis. However, these observations suggest that factor VII-mediated thrombin generation may proceed by partitioning of small amounts of factor VII on tissue factor-expressing cells and that factor VII contained within monocytes may facilitate tissue factor-induced coagulation by these cells. These features may provide efficient coagulation activation despite a deficiency of the plasma coagulant protein. The current results may explain, at least in part, the minimal bleeding tendency, and also the occurrence of thrombosis and atherosclerosis in certain persons with factor VII deficiency.\r"

  ".W": "We have used mixed- and co-cultures of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells to investigate the role of phospholipase activation and arachidonic acid metabolites in the production of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF). Inhibition of phospholipase A2 with para-bromophenacyl bromide, dexamethasone or quinacrine, alone or in combination, blocked arachidonate release by 50%-60% but had no effect on EDRF production as assessed by cyclic GMP accumulation in mixed- or co-cultures of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells. Inhibition of the phospholipase C-diacylglycerol (DAG) lipase pathway of arachidonate release by the DAG lipase inhibitor RHC-80267 also caused partial inhibition of arachidonate release and had no effect on EDRF. When both phospholipase A2 and phospholipase C pathways for arachidonate mobilization were inhibited (dexamethasone + RHC 80267), arachidonate release was totally inhibited while EDRF release remained intact. We conclude that neither phospholipase activation nor arachidonate mobilization is required for EDRF release from cultured bovine endothelial cells.\r"

  ".W": "Among 640 randomly selected women who were attending a sexually transmitted disease clinic and did not have trichomoniasis, 33% had bacterial vaginosis as defined by a composite of four clinical criteria: (1) Vaginal discharge was homogeneous; (2) vaginal discharge had a pH greater than or equal to 4.7; (3) vaginal discharge had an amine-like odor when mixed with 10% potassium hydroxide; (4) vaginal discharge contained clue cells representing greater than or equal to 20% of vaginal epithelial cells. Previously published Gram stain criteria for bacterial vaginosis correlated better than results of semiquantitative cultures for Gardnerella vaginalis with presence or absence of clue cells and with composite clinical criteria. Of 293 women with bacterial vaginosis by Gram stain criteria, 65% had symptoms of increased vaginal discharge and/or vaginal malodor, while 74% had signs of characteristic homogeneous vaginal discharge or amine-like odor. Elevated vaginal pH was the least specific and amine-like odor the least sensitive sign of bacterial vaginosis. Gram stain criteria for bacterial vaginosis were not associated with the concentrations of endocervical or vaginal inflammatory cells but were significantly associated with a clinical diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease. After adjusting for coinfection, sexual behavior, and other variables, bacterial vaginosis remained associated with adnexal tenderness (odds ratio = 9.2, p = 0.04). Bacterial vaginosis, previously implicated as a risk factor for obstetric infections, may be a risk factor for pelvic inflammatory disease.\r"

Sixteen of 120 (13%) subjects had bacterial vaginosis during the study. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis or in the prevalence of isolation of Gardnerella vaginalis between the sexually active and virginal groups. Only a few cases of bacterial vaginosis (one of eight), wet mount clue cells (four of 11), sniff tests (two of eight), and abnormal vaginal fluid succinate/lactate ratios (none of 6) persisted for 3 months in the absence of therapy. These results are discussed in light of several recent reports that suggest using the isolation of G. vaginalis or the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis as evidence of sexual abuse in children. It is concluded that bacterial vaginosis should not be considered an exclusively sexually transmitted disease. The presence of the condition is neither proof of sexual activity nor warrants male sexual partner therapy. In addition, therapy seems unwarranted for the incidental finding of bacterial vaginosis in the patient without symptoms.\r"

Systolic blood pressure was significantly lower in the propofol group after induction of anaesthesia, tracheal intubation, placement in the semirecumbent position in the hoist, bath immersion and after 5, 10 and 30 minutes of treatment. Diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower in the propofol group after intubation, placement in the hoist, bath immersion and after 5, 10 and 15 minutes of treatment. Heart rate was significantly lower in the propofol group after induction, intubation, placement in the hoist and bath immersion. There was no significant difference in the quality of induction between the two groups. Quality of maintenance of anaesthesia was judged to be poor in six out of 20 patients who received methohexitone compared with one out of 20 who received propofol but this difference did not reach statistical significance. There was no significant difference between the recovery times for the two groups but six out of 20 patients who received methohexitone were judged to have a poor recovery from anaesthesia compared with none in the propofol group (p less than 0.05). Propofol was associated with excellent induction, maintenance and recovery characteristics but it had a propensity to produce greater decreases in blood pressure, which were most marked when the patient was placed in the semirecumbent position in the hoist.\r"

An overall mean blood propofol concentration of 3.67 micrograms/ml was achieved within 2 minutes and maintained stable for the subsequent 80-90 minutes of surgery. The decrease of systolic and diastolic arterial pressures at induction was much less than that previously described after larger induction doses of propofol and there was a negligible haemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and intubation or to the subsequent surgery.

Cardiovascular dynamics were recorded in the awake state one minute after induction and 1, 5 and 30 minutes after tracheal intubation; coronary blood flow (argon wash-in) and myocardial oxygen consumption were determined in the awake state and 5 and 30 minutes after intubation. Both anaesthetics decreased systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures, heart rate and cardiac index to the same extent. Myocardial blood flow and oxygen consumption were also reduced in both groups due to a reduction in cardiac work. Tracheal intubation produced a marked increase in arterial pressure in the etomidate group, while haemodynamic changes were absent in the propofol group, Myocardial lactate production was not observed in either group 5 or 30 minutes after tracheal intubation.\r"
