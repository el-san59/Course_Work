The patient's change in mental status was first reported nine days after the initiation of therapy. Her delirium significantly improved after misoprostol was discontinued and her mental status returned to normal within a week. Because no other factors related to this patient changed significantly, the delirium experienced by this patient possibly resulted from misoprostol therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Altretamine is a National Cancer Institute-designated group C antineoplastic agent used in the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. Altretamine is a highly lipid-soluble drug available only for oral administration as a capsule. The drug is activated through metabolic oxidation to intermediate methylol derivatives and formaldehyde. It is unclear which metabolite is the major species responsible for cytotoxicity or the primary mechanism of cytotoxicity. As a single agent in the treatment of ovarian cancer, altretamine demonstrates a response rate similar to other active agents in this disease (21-39 percent). The major utility of altretamine is in combination with other agents such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, fluorouracil, melphalan, and cisplatin. However, few randomized trials have evaluated the contribution of altretamine in these multiagent combinations. Dose-limiting toxicities include gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, anorexia), hematologic, and neurotoxic (peripheral neurotoxicity). The therapeutic role of altretamine is limited because of a toxicity profile similar to that of cisplatin, one of the more active agents in ovarian cancer. Its use should be reserved for patients who are not candidates for more standard platinum-based regimens.\r"

  ".W": "Since live rubeola vaccine became available in 1963, routine immunization of children at age 15 months has been the recommended strategy for eliminating measles in the United States. However, due to increasing measles outbreaks, especially among previously immunized populations, the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP) recently recommended modifying the one-dose measles vaccination policy to a two-dose schedule, one at 15 months and one at age 5 or 6 years. To address the present college population, ACIP recommended vaccinating all college students who lack proof of immunity. We used the methods of decision analysis to examine the cost effectiveness of implementing such a program in a specific college population, namely, students at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). We developed a model to examine three possible vaccination strategies: \"wait,\" \"screen,\" and \"vaccinate all.\" Estimates of probabilities and cost were derived from several outbreaks at UCLA as well as statewide data. In the baseline case, the least expensive strategy is to wait until an outbreak occurs before implementing a vaccination program. The additional cost incurred by screening per measles case avoided is $122,871. However, using sensitivity analysis, we found that the overall cost of elective vaccination strategies is driven by the cost of the vaccine itself. If vaccine could be provided at a nominal cost to the university, a strategy of vaccinating all students without proof of immunity (by either history of two vaccinations or positive titer) would provide the high level of immunity needed to prevent outbreaks and still be most cost effective ($16,644 per measles case avoided).\r"

Isradipine, 5 mg administered orally, induced a significant reduction in arterial pressure from 165 +/- 6/88 +/- 3 mm Hg to 140 +/- 5/76 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) within 2.5 hours by a decrease in total peripheral resistance associated with an increase in heart rate and cardiac output. Contrary to the acute effect, oral therapy with isradipine for 3 months reduced arterial pressure through a decrease in total peripheral resistance but without causing an increase in heart rate or cardiac output or activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Isradipine slightly reduced left ventricular mass and improved cardiac systolic function and left ventricular filling. Renal blood flow increased, and renal vascular resistance (p less than 0.01) and total blood volume (p less than 0.002) decreased without a change in either sodium excretion or body weight. Thus, isradipine, when given for 3 months, decreased arterial pressure by reducing total peripheral resistance without activation of reflexive mechanisms. Its favorable effects on systemic hemodynamics, total blood volume, renal blood flow, and cardiac structure and function suggest isradipine to be an excellent choice for antihypertensive therapy.\r"

There were no significant changes from baseline to the end of the study in serum triglycerides, total high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, HDL3 cholesterol, HDL2 cholesterol, or apolipoprotein A-I. These data suggest that even if total fat intake remains at 39-40 en%, many men show lowered LDL cholesterol if saturated fatty acid intake is minimized and that diets high in polyunsaturated fatty acids do not necessarily lower HDL-cholesterol concentrations.\r"

Rats were fed diets containing different doses of linolenic acid or menhaden oil for 3 mo. Constant ratios of n-3 to n-6 fatty acids were maintained by concomitant increases in safflower oil as the n-6 fatty acid source. Results showed that AA concentrations in liver, platelet, and lung phospholipids and concentrations of eicosanoids synthesized in tissues were significantly (P less than 0.05) suppressed both by linolenic acid and menhaden oil; however, there was a lack of a dose response within groups fed different amounts of the same dietary fat. These results indicate that the ratio of n-3 to n-6 fatty acids in the diets, rather than the absolute amount of n-3 fatty acids, is the determining factor in inhibiting eicosanoid biosynthesis from AA.\r"

During the first 2 d mild symptoms of intolerance developed in 63% of patients on whole milk, 37% on acidified milk, and 54% on LFD whereas severe intolerance, necessitating withdrawal, was encountered in 22% receiving whole milk and none receiving LFD. Stool weights and fat excretion on day 3 were greater (P less than 0.02) in the remaining milk-fed patients whereas nitrogen balance remained strongly positive in all three groups. Eighty-seven percent of patients were methane producers, and high excretion rates were associated with better milk tolerance. The results suggest that although undiluted cow milk will not form a suitable tube feed for malnourished African patients, products such as acidified milk may prove cost effective.\r"

Errors in measured VO2, VCO2, and RQ were less than or equal to 2.5% when VO2 and VCO2 were 4-43 mL/min and flow rate was 100-2000 mL/min. The relative error in predicted VO2 was increased as the inspired oxygen concentration (FiO2) was raised but the error was less than 4% when the value of FiO2 minus expired oxygen concentration (FeO2) was greater than or equal to 0.015 and the FiO2 was less than or equal to 0.6. Sixteen studies were performed on seven very-low-birth-weight (VLBW), mechanically ventilated infants aged less than or equal to 11 d. VO2 was 8.37 +/- 1.81 mL.kg-1.min-1, VCO2 was 8.15 +/- 2.03 mL.kg-1.min-1, and RQ was 0.969 +/- 0.061 (means +/- SD). The MGM, Jr. is accurate for studies of low-birth-weight infants on mechanical ventilators when VO2 and VCO2 are greater than or equal to 4 mL/min, flow rate is less than or equal to 3000 mL/min, and FiO2 is less than or equal to 0.6.

The extent to which these indices reflect milligrams per liter quantities of n-6 and n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated derivatives of EFA (LCPs), required for cell membrane accretion, is unknown. Thus, 18:2n-6, the triene-tetrene ratio, and n-6 and n-3 LCPs were measured in plasma phospholipid of preterm infants' cord blood (n = 22) and of preterm infants fed formula (n = 12) or of preterm infants who received fat-free parenteral nutrition (n = 15) on postnatal day 3. Whether expressed as percent or milligrams per liter, 18:2n-6 was markedly higher and the triene-tetrene ratio lower in infants fed formula than in infants who had received no lipid. However, concentrations of n-6 and n-3 LCPs were similar in the two groups of infants and significantly higher than cord values. In the absence of an exogenous lipid source, it is suggested that tissue stores of LCPs are released in response to birth.\r"

RED was estimated after an oral ethanol bolus (0.6 g/kg), before and after a 14-day treatment with DHT (2 x 125 mg per day percutaneously; Andractim, Besins iscovesco, France). A mean 11.5-fold increase in DHT levels and a 2.0-fold decrease in T values were observed after DHT administration, confirming the good compliance with treatment. RED was decreased after DHT (0.168 +/- 0.043 vs. 0.137 +/- 0.043 g/l/hr; mean +/- SD; p less than 0.01 using Wilcoxon's paired comparison test).

DESIGN: A prospective, randomized, single-blind, multicenter trial. PATIENTS: Patients with osteoarthritis receiving treatment with ibuprofen, piroxicam, or naproxen and experiencing abdominal pain were eligible. INTERVENTIONS: Patients who were expected to receive at least 3 months of NSAID therapy and who did not have a gastric ulcer at the time of the initial screening endoscopy were randomized to receive misoprostol, 200 micrograms four times a day, or sucralfate, 1 g four times a day. A gastric ulcer was defined as a lesion of the gastric mucosa 0.3 cm or greater in diameter. Patients were followed clinically, and repeat endoscopies were performed after 4, 8, and 12 weeks. MAIN MEASUREMENT: The development of a gastric ulcer, which was regarded as a prophylaxis failure. RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-three patients were evaluable for efficacy analysis. A gastric ulcer developed in 2 of the 122 (1.6%, 95% CI, 0.3% to 6.4%) patients on misoprostol, compared with 21 of 131 patients on sucralfate (16%, CI, 10.4% to 23.7%). The difference in ulcer rates was 14.4% (CI, 10.4% to 19.5%; P less than 0.001). CONCLUSION: In patients receiving chronic NSAID therapy for osteoarthritis, treatment with misoprostol for 3 months was associated with a significantly lower frequency of gastric ulcer formation, compared with treatment with sucralfate (P less than 0.001).\r"

In addition to producing the complications of contracture, skin breakdown, and pain, it can cause peripheral nerve entrapment. Nerve entrapment due to heterotopic ossification may be misdiagnosed, and it is difficult to evaluate and treat without recurrence. Computed tomography is especially useful in localization before surgical release of the entrapped nerve. Resection of heterotopic ossification can be successful using disodium etidronate to decrease the risk of recurrence, and resection can improve range of motion and nerve function. Two case studies of nerve entrapment due to heterotopic ossification are presented with the results of computed tomography localization, successful resection, and long-term follow-up. Clinicians should be aware of this complication and the potential for rapid nerve injury. If heterotopic ossification is causing clinically significant peripheral nerve entrapment, early surgical treatment may be indicated, and may be successful.\r"

  ".W": "Consecutive patients (n = 1,289) discharged from two inpatient rehabilitation facilities were prospectively examined to determine the extent to which rehabilitative outcomes, functionally based progress, and associated resource utilization (in terms of rehabilitation length of stay) can be concomitantly predicted using the Tufts/New England Medical Center functional assessment tool and bivariate and multivariate statistical comparisons. A high percentage (greater than 50%) of statistically significant associations between the predictor variables and seven outcome measures were seen. The R2s corresponding to these associations were generally small and resistant to enhancement by commonly accepted statistical manipulations. Consequently, they are, in general, of limited predictive value for determining functional prognosis or resource utilization among rehabilitation inpatients. Although functionally based predictors appear to be the best predictors of functional progress, their effectiveness as predictors of other domains (eg, discharge outcome and rehabilitation length of stay) is variable. The implication is that a prospective payment system using such an array of predictors and directed primarily at cost containment is likely to overlook potentially important gains in functional progress and patient outcome. Furthermore, the functionally based predictors, taken individually, varied in effectiveness as predictors among facilities, and, taken collectively, they varied in effectiveness as predictors for different diagnostic groupings within a facility. The inconsistency of predictions according to the various domains appears to further limit their application to a prospective payment model.\r"

  ".W": "In a study of 7 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), we characterized the T cell population present in the synovial membrane, thought to be the location where T cells trigger the disease. Synovial membrane lymphocytes from the RA patients were found to have a selective expansion of gamma/delta T cells (8.8% in synovial membrane versus 4% in peripheral blood). Expansion of the gamma/delta T cell subset was not found in the synovial membrane of patients with osteoarthritis. We characterized the gamma/delta T cell repertoire using monoclonal antibodies Ti gamma A, BB3, and delta TCS1, which recognize the gene products encoded by V gamma 9, V delta 2, and V delta 1-J delta 1, respectively. The majority of the synovial gamma/delta T cells did not express the repertoire encoded by these genes, which is found in nearly 100% of the peripheral blood gamma/delta T cells of healthy volunteer donors and in the thymus at early stages of development. We conclude that the synovial membrane of patients with RA displays a selective expansion of a specific population of gamma/delta T cells expressing a clonotypic receptor not yet serologically defined, which might be implicated in the development of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin-2 (IL-2) production was studied in T lymphocytes and isolated CD4+ T lymphocytes from 12 patients with primary fibromyalgia syndrome and 10 healthy volunteers. The dose and time kinetics of IL-2 production by concanavalin A-stimulated T cells and CD4+ T cells of fibromyalgia patients differed from findings in controls by 1) a need for a higher concentration of mitogen in order to achieve optimal IL-2 secretion, and 2) a delay in the peak time of optimal IL-2 secretion. Unlike normal IL-2 secretion, which was higher after removal of CD8+ T cells, the pattern and degree of IL-2 secretion by cells from fibromyalgia patients were not changed following removal of CD8+ T cells. Addition of calcium ionophore in assays using suboptimal concanavalin A concentrations did not correct the reduction in IL-2 secretion by fibromyalgia patient T cells, but addition of phorbol myristate acetate induced normal secretion of IL-2. These findings suggest that there is a defect in the IL-2 pathway, which is related to protein kinase C activation and does not involve impairment of Ca2+ elevation, in patients with fibromyalgia.\r"

Posterior delta rhythm was found only in patients without GTCS. Focal abnormalities, albeit transient, were more frequent among patients with GTCS. The initial electroencephalogram was of some early predictive value in patients with only absences at the time of the initial registration.

HIV-negative and HIV-positive drug users who had injected a mean of three times a day in the preceding 4-6 months had a T-cell reactivity which was 40-50% lower compared with seronegative and with seropositive drug users who had not injected in the preceding months.

The prevalence of p24 antigenemia in 89 hospitalized Zairian AIDS patients was significantly lower than in 47 clinically comparable AIDS patients in the USA (17 versus 48%, P less than 0.0001). Prevalence of p24 antigenemia in sera from 200 asymptomatic HIV-1-infected individuals was also lower in individuals from Zaire compared with 83 individuals in the USA (3.5 versus 7%). In African individuals, antigenemia prevalence increased with advanced clinical status: 8% in ambulatory AIDS patients, 17% in hospitalized AIDS patients and 18% in postmortem AIDS patients. Acid hydrolysis treatment of sera from 63 Zairian AIDS patients initially negative for p24 antigen showed an 11% positivity rate confirmed by neutralization, suggesting that immune complexing of p24 antigen may play a role in the observed lower p24 antigenemia rates reported for African individuals.\r"

Expression of CD45RO on CD4 lymphocytes was variable; absolute numbers were not increased, although the percentage was increased in four out of nine infected children. All the infected children except two (who had comparatively low numbers of CD45RO+ CD8 cells) were clinically well, which suggests that an increase in CD45RO+ CD8 cells may be indicative of a functionally active immune response against HIV.\r"

In contrast, HIV was isolated from 92% of cell samples (99% in subjects with less than 900 x 10(6)/l CD4 cells, 46% in those with CD4 counts greater than or equal to 900 x 10(6)/l). Since most cell samples were positive, a scoring method was designed to quantify the cellular viral load. The results obtained demonstrated that the cellular viral load was closely related to CD4 counts. We also found that the cellular viral load was higher in subjects with either positive plasma isolation or positive p24 antigenaemia. The measurement of the cellular viral load by this scoring method appears to be useful for the management of HIV-seropositive individuals and for the evaluation of therapeutic trials.\r"

The major elements of the programme include the diagnosis and treatment of conventional STD, and the promotion of condom use to prevent the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Using estimates of numbers of HIV-seropositive prostitutes, numbers of sexual contacts, susceptibility of clients to HIV, HIV transmission efficiency, rates of condom use and the basic reproductive rate of HIV infection in Kenya, we estimate that the programme is responsible for preventing between 6,000 and 10,000 new cases of HIV infection per year among clients and contacts of clients. The total annual operating cost of the programme is approximately US$77,000 or between US$8.00 and US$12.00 for each case of HIV infection prevented. Programmes to reduce the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections which are targeted at high-frequency STD transmitters, such as prostitutes, can be effective and relatively inexpensive to undertake. More such programmes should be developed and evaluated in different settings.\r"

With a fifth construct containing an immunodominant gp41 sequence, significant differential recognition was observed in approximately 67% of individuals with asymptomatic HIV infection [groups II and III of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) classification of HIV infection] and 37% of patients with symptomatic disease (CDC group IV). Furthermore, among patients with CDC stage IV disease antibody levels against this construct and the titre achieved decreased with progression to further disease from approximately 40% in AIDS-related complex (ARC) patients (CDC group IVA and IVC-2 to 14% in those with AIDS (other group IV diseases).

In 1982 Hamlyn et al demonstrated the presence of a Na+, K(+)-ATPase inhibitor in the plasma of essential hypertensives and showed a significant correlation of the Na+, K(+)-ATPase inhibition with the blood pressure. In this study we examined whether an Na+, K(+)-ATPase inhibitor could be found in the blood of essential hypertensives as compared to patients with secondary hypertension (renal hypertension, renal artery stenosis, pheochromocytoma). Second, the possible correlation between an inhibition of Na+, K(+)-ATPase and the intracellular electrolyte composition was examined. The results demonstrate a similar reduction of Na+, K(+)-ATPase inhibition in both essential hypertensives and secondary hypertensives as compared to normotensive controls. Further, the intracellular electrolyte composition (Na+, Na; K+, Ca) does not show a significant correlation to the degree of Na+, K(+)-ATPase inhibition, whereas a significant correlation between the degree of Na+, K(+)-ATPase inhibition and intracellular Cl- concentration could be demonstrated. The present study shows that an endogenous Na+, K(+)-ATPase inhibitor is also present in secondary forms of hypertension, thus implying that a specific role in the pathogenesis of primary hypertension for an Na+, K(+)-inhibitor is unlikely.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma from normal humans and rats on a high sodium intake, and from patients and rats suffering from hereditary hypertension has an increased cytochemically detectable glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)-stimulating/Na-K-ATPase inhibiting activity. The hypothalamic content of this activity is also increased by a high sodium intake and in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). Using cytochemical techniques, the ability of plasma and the hypothalamus of reduced renal mass hypertensive rats to stimulate G6PD activity and to inhibit Na-K-ATPase was measured. The mean G6PD-stimulating capacity of the plasma from the hypertensive and normotensive groups of rats was 351 +/- 67 and 11.42 +/- 1.98 G6PD-stimulating units/mL respectively (P less than .001). The time courses of the ability of plasma from a hypertensive and a normotensive rat to inhibit fresh tissue Na-K-ATPase after 2, 4, 6, and 8 min of exposure demonstrated that the hypertensive rat plasma had a greater capacity to inhibit Na-K-ATPase. The mean G6PD-stimulating capacity of the hypothalamus from the hypertensive and normotensive groups of rats was 252,263 +/- 147,958 X 10(3) and 6.38 +/- 2.35 X 10(3) G6PD-stimulating units per hypothalamus, respectively (P less than .01). It is proposed that the raised concentration of cytochemically detectable G6PD-stimulating/Na-K-ATPase-inhibiting substance in both genetic and nongenetic forms of hypertension may be a manifestation of a communal hypertensinogenic mechanism. Thus, the raised plasma concentration would have a direct peripheral vascular constricting effect and the high hypothalamic concentration would be responsible for a central nervous hypertensinogenic effect.\r"

Because relatively little is known about the venous and capillary actions of ANP in humans, we investigated the spectrum of vascular actions of ANP in the human forearm. In seven healthy subjects, ANP was infused intraarterially in consecutive doses of 0, 10, 50, and 250 ng/100 mL tissue/min together with vehicle or norepinephrine 1 ng/kg/min. In seven other subjects, 0.5 ng/kg/min angiotensin II and 10 ng/kg/min serotonin were used as a constrictor. Venous occlusion plethysmography was used to measure forearm blood flow, venous compliance, capillary filtration rate, and maximum venous outflow. Intraarterial infusion of ANP induced a dose-dependent increase of forearm blood flow but the relative increases were not influenced by concomitant vasoconstriction. Venous compliance was not affected by the infusions, but serotonin and angiotensin II decreased the changes of both forearm volume and venous pressure. ANP antagonized these effects of angiotensin II. Capillary filtration rate was not affected by ANP infusion. ANP alone had no effect on the maximum venous outflow, but it attenuated the decrease induced by norepinephrine and angiotensin II. These results indicate that in the human forearm ANP has predominantly arterial effects, whereas the venous actions become manifest only in the presence of vasoconstriction. The venous effect of ANP may therefore gain importance in disease states with elevated levels of vasoconstrictors, for instance, in congestive heart failure.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the possible physiologic role of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) in the observed dissociation of aldosterone secretion from the renin-angiotensin system during hypoxic exercise, 12 untrained men, ages 18 to 24, were studied on two separate days for 30 min during hypoxic (16% O2) and normoxic (room air) exercise on a bicycle ergometer. Workloads were adjusted to produce individual heart rates that remained within 70 to 75% of their previously measured maximum. Hemoglobin saturation decreased during hypoxia from 98 +/- 0.1% to 90 +/- 0.4% (P less than .01). Plasma aldosterone levels increased significantly (P less than .01) under both breathing conditions, yet were on average 36% lower during hypoxia than during normoxia (P less than .001). Plasma ANF levels increased during exercise under both conditions (P less than .01), yet levels were 45% greater during hypoxia than during normoxia (P less than .001). Plasma renin activity, adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, potassium, and systolic blood pressure increased during exercise on both study days (P less than .01, compared to basal level), and showed no difference between normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Plasma pH was slightly higher during hypoxic exercise (P less than .05, compared to normoxia). We conclude that acute hypoxemia is a potent enhancing stimulus for ANF release during dynamic exercise and that ANF is probably a contributing factor in the dissociation of aldosterone secretion from the renin-angiotensin system under these conditions.\r"

As compared to a 4 week placebo phase, cilazapril decreased arterial pressure in both study groups (from 124/83 +/- 9/6 to 114/77 +/- 9/5 mm Hg and from 143/102 +/- 13/7 to 137/96 +/- 10/10 mm Hg; P less than .025); exchangeable sodium (-158 mmol and, respectively, -104 mmol) and upright plasma aldosterone (-24% and -15%) also tended to fall. Heart rate, the chronotropic response to posture or isoproterenol, plasma norepinephrine levels, the concentration/pressor response curve to norepinephrine, plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentration, plasma angiotensin II and the responses of blood pressure or plasma aldosterone to angiotensin II were unchanged after 8 weeks of cilazapril. Plasma renin activity increased (+175% to +650%). These findings indicate that the blood pressure lowering effect of cilazapril in the stable phase of pharmacological intervention is not associated with modifications of sympathetic-dependent pressor reactivity or beta-adrenergic sensitivity. Plasma angiotensin II concentration and angiotensin II-dependent pathways including the pressor and aldosterone responsiveness to angiotensin II are also unchanged.\r"

Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) infusion during placebo was associated with a significant increase of diuresis, natriuresis, kaliuresis, urinary noradrenaline, and dopamine excretion. Plasma aldosterone significantly decreased. Blood pressure was slightly reduced. The administration of carbidopa significantly reduced urinary dopamine excretion but did not modify natriuresis, diuresis, indexes of adrenergic and renin-aldosterone system activity, blood pressure, or heart rate, both in basal conditions and in response to ANP infusion.

DESIGN--Seroprevalence estimated by reactivity in an enzyme immunoassay for antibodies to C100 protein with supplementary testing with a recombinant immunoblot assay and an assay for hepatitis C virus RNA. SETTING--Outpatient genitourinary medicine clinic in central London. PATIENTS--The panel of 1046 serum samples was from 1074 consecutive patients attending the clinic during November and December 1987 and having blood taken for routine testing for syphilis. Before samples were anonymised demographic and risk factor information was extracted from the clinic notes. Samples had already been tested for antibody to HIV-I and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen. MAIN RESULTS--Significantly more homosexual subjects than heterosexual subjects were positive for hepatitis C antibody determined by enzyme immunoassay alone (19/275 (6.9%) v 8/771 (1.0%), odds ratio 7.14, p less than 0.0001) and also when reactive serum samples were also tested by recombinant immunoblot assay (6/270) (2.2%) v 3/770 (0.4%), odds ratio 5.88, p less than 0.02). There were also significant associations in patients positive for hepatitis C antibody with positivity for antibodies to HIV and to hepatitis B core antigen, lifetime number of sexually transmitted diseases (homosexual men only), and age (all groups combined). Most patients whose serum samples contained specific antibodies to hepatitis C virus were viraemic. CONCLUSIONS--The study provides strong evidence for the sexual transmission of hepatitis C virus. Assays derived from other gene products are desirable to investigate the specificity and sensitivity of the enzyme immunoassay for C100 antibody as a marker of hepatitis C virus infection.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Clinical experience suggests that combinations of antiarrhythmic agents provide more effective control of ventricular tachyarrhythmias than does therapy with single agents. METHODS AND RESULTS. Antiarrhythmic and electrophysiological effects of three class I antiarrhythmic agents, one from each subclass A, B, and C, were assessed in single use and in combination with amiodarone in patients with inducible, sustained ventricular tachycardia that was not suppressed by monotherapy with these agents. Thirty-one patients underwent an electrophysiology test on four occasions: at baseline; after 2-4 days of treatment with quinidine, mexiletine, or encainide; after 2 weeks of treatment with 1,200 mg/day amiodarone; and last, after 2-4 days of treatment with both amiodarone and the previously tested class I agent. The combination of a class I agent and amiodarone prevented the induction of sustained ventricular tachycardia in only one of 31 (3%) patients. Ventricular tachycardia became hemodynamically stable in 11 of 31 (34%) patients because of a marked prolongation in the tachycardia cycle length. It increased from 323 +/- 39 to 423 +/- 84 msec (n = 11, p less than 0.01) by adding encainide to amiodarone therapy, and it showed a tendency to lengthen when quinidine was added to amiodarone (from 373 +/- 77 to 425 +/- 58 msec; n = 10, NS). Each class I agent increased amiodarone-induced depression in myocardial conduction, but the extent of the additional depression seemed to differ among the three subclasses. Ventricular refractoriness was increased by all class I agents when used in combination with amiodarone, although not by mexiletine or encainide when used alone. CONCLUSIONS. Class I antiarrhythmic agents slow ventricular conduction and increase ventricular refractoriness when used in combination with amiodarone. When amiodarone and class I drugs by themselves do not suppress the induction of ventricular tachycardia, the combination of amiodarone and a class I agent seldom results in noninducibility; however, it often lengthens the ventricular tachycardia cycle length and may render the ventricular tachycardia hemodynamically stable.\r"

Silent myocardial ischemia is an adverse prognostic marker in patients with coronary disease; however, controlled data on the effect of treatment are sparse and contradictory, and the relations among the occurrence of ST segment depression, drug efficacy, and heart rate are unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS. Sixty patients with stable coronary artery disease, a positive treadmill exercise test and asymptomatic ST segment depression on ambulatory electrocardiographic recording were assessed in a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial. Treadmill exercise tests and 72-hour electrocardiographic recordings were obtained at the end of two 2-week treatment periods with sustained-release diltiazem 180 mg b.i.d. or equivalent placebo. Episodes of asymptomatic ST depression decreased by 50% or more in 70% of the patients from a median number of 4.5 (range, 0-19) to 1.5 (range, 0-13) (p = 0.0001); their cumulative duration also decreased from 78.5 (range, 0-60) to 24.5 (range, 0-411) minutes (p = 0.001). No circadian variation was found in the efficacy of diltiazem. The occurrence of ischemic type ST segment depression was modulated by changes in heart rate rather than by absolute heart rate. Diltiazem also improved exercise test end points but to a lesser extent. Time to ST segment depression increased to 341 +/- 148 from 296 +/- 154 seconds (p = 0.005). Although less frequent with diltiazem administration (45 versus 54 patients, p less than 0.03), exercise-induced ST depression was more often asymptomatic (98% versus 72% of patients, p less than 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS. Diltiazem reduces the frequency and severity of ischemic type ST depression in patients with stable coronary artery disease.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The use of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) in thrombolytic therapy is frequently associated with significant fibrinogenolysis. In contrast, recombinant vampire bat salivary plasminogen activator (Bat-PA) displays strict fibrin specificity, an attribute that could be desirable in a fibrinolytic agent. METHODS AND RESULTS. The efficacy and fibrin selectivity of Bat-PA was evaluated and compared with that of t-PA using a rabbit model of femoral arterial thrombosis. Administration of 8.1, 14, and 42 nmol Bat-PA/kg by bolus intravenous injection restored flow in 50%, 75%, and 80% of the rabbits, respectively. The incidence of reperfusion after bolus intravenous injection of 14 and 42 nmol t-PA/kg was 15% and 78%, respectively. The maximal femoral artery reperfusion flows were equivalent after treatment with 42 nmol Bat-PA/kg or 42 nmol t-PA/kg, but the time to reach maximal flow for Bat-PA was approximately one half that of t-PA. Furthermore, the rapid restoration of flow by 42 nmol Bat-PA/kg, in contrast to equimolar t-PA, was accomplished without fibrinogenolysis and with only small decreases in the plasminogen and alpha 2-antiplasmin levels. Equipotent doses of Bat-PA and t-PA both resulted in approximate 2.5-fold increases in the template bleeding times of aspirin-pretreated rabbits. The clearance of Bat-PA from rabbits exhibited biexponential elimination kinetics; approximately 80% was cleared by the relatively slow beta phase (half-life of 17.1 minutes). Overall, Bat-PA was cleared approximately fourfold slower than t-PA. CONCLUSIONS. Bolus intravenous administration of Bat-PA would facilitate prompt initiation of thrombolytic therapy, and the avoidance of plasminemia could result in fewer and less severe bleeding complications.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), the specific, fast-acting inhibitor of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), binds to fibrin and has been found in high concentrations within arterial thrombi. These findings suggest that the localization of PAI-1 to a thrombus protects that same thrombus from fibrinolysis. In this study, clot-bound PAI-1 was assessed for its ability to suppress clot lysis in vivo. METHODS AND RESULTS. Autologous, canine whole blood clots were formed in the presence of increasing amounts of activated PAI-1 (0-30 micrograms/ml). Approximately 6-8% of the PAI-1 bound to the clots under the experimental conditions. Control and PAI-1-enriched clots containing iodine-125-labeled fibrin (ogen) were homogenized, washed to remove nonbound elements, and delivered to the lungs of anesthetized dogs where the homogenates subsequently underwent lysis by the endogeneous fibrinolytic system. 125I-labeled fibrin degradation products appeared in the blood of control animals within 10 minutes and were maximal by 90 minutes. PAI-1 reduced fibrin degradation product release in a dose-responsive manner at all times between 30 minutes and 5 hours (greater than or equal to 76% inhibition at 30 minutes, PAI-1 greater than or equal to 6 micrograms/ml). PAI-1 also suppressed D-dimer release from clots containing small amounts of human fibrin (ogen). t-PA administration attenuated the effects of PAI-1, whereas latent PAI-1 (20 micrograms/ml) had no effect on clot lysis. Blood levels of PA and PAI activity remained unaltered during these experiments. CONCLUSIONS. The results indicate that PAI-1 markedly inhibits endogenous fibrinolysis in vivo and, moreover, suggest that the localization of PAI-1 to a forming thrombus is an important physiological mechanism for subsequent thrombus stabilization.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Organic nitrates such as nitroglycerin and isosorbide dinitrate are useful in the treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF), but tolerance develops rapidly during continuous administration. Because combination therapy of nitrate and hydralazine has been shown to provide both short- and long-term benefit but nitrate alone produces hemodynamic tolerance, we questioned whether hydralazine can preserve the favorable preload effects of nitroglycerin. METHODS AND RESULTS. Using an in vivo model of nitroglycerin tolerance in the CHF rat, we examined the effects of hydralazine bolus dosing during continuous nitroglycerin infusion. Continuous infusion of nitroglycerin alone (10 micrograms/min) produced initial reductions in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 40-50%, which returned to baseline by 8 hours (tolerance development). Coadministration of hydralazine (2 x 0.1 mg) maintained the effects of nitroglycerin infusion on left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (45% reduction at 10 hours). This hydralazine dose alone reduced left ventricular peak systolic pressure by approximately 12 +/- 3% but had no effect on left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Hydralazine dosing did not affect steady-state plasma concentrations of nitroglycerin or metabolites, and hydralazine was unable to prevent nitroglycerin tolerance induced in vitro. CONCLUSIONS. The beneficial interaction of hydralazine on the preload effects of nitroglycerin may explain the long-term clinical efficacy of hydralazine/nitrate combination in CHF. Our results also suggest that the mechanism of in vivo nitrate tolerance in CHF may be systemic rather than vascular in origin.\r"

The mechanisms underlying the susceptibility to vascular disease in these subjects are unknown. We investigated whether a parental history of premature heart attack or stroke in hypertensive subjects is associated with abnormalities of sodium handling. METHODS AND RESULTS. Patients with mild, uncomplicated essential hypertension were divided into two subgroups according to family history: a subgroup with a parental history of premature heart attack or stroke (FV+, n = 18) and a subgroup with a family history completely negative for vascular accidents (FV-, n = 14). The two subgroups were comparable with respect to age, weight, sex distribution, blood pressure, duration of hypertension, cardiovascular risk factors, renal function, and organ damage. Baseline plasma renin activity (PRA), concentrations of aldosterone (PA), atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), and norepinephrine, and urinary electrolyte excretion were also comparable in the two subgroups. Despite these similarities, the responses to an acute saline load, measured under controlled metabolic and experimental conditions, were different in the two subgroups. In the FV+ subgroup at 60 minutes of saline load, PRA fell by 1.0 +/- 0.2 ng/ml/hr and PA concentration by 89.4 +/- 26 pg/ml and ANF concentration increased by 38 +/- 9 pg/ml, whereas in the FV- subgroup the corresponding responses were -2.3 +/- 0.3 ng/ml/hr (p less than 0.005), -190 +/- 43 pg/ml (p less than 0.05), and 80 +/- 13 pg/ml (p less than 0.005), respectively. Urinary sodium excretion was delayed in the FV+ subgroup (270 +/- 67 mu eq/min at 60 minutes) compared with the FV- subgroup (555 +/- 157 mu eq/min at 60 minutes, p less than 0.05). At 120 minutes of saline load, significant (p less than 0.005) differences in PRA and ANF concentration were still observed. In a control group of eight normal subjects the responses to a saline load were comparable to those in the FV- subgroup but greater than those in the FV+ subgroup at 60 minutes. CONCLUSIONS. These results provide evidence that the hormonal and renal adjustments to an acute salt load are impaired in hypertensive patients with a parental history of vascular accidents. We speculate that abnormalities of sodium handling may represent markers of a more rapid development of vascular injury in human hypertension.\r"

Both groups used serum aminoglycoside concentration data when making dosing decisions. Improved response rates were seen in the experimental (60%; 42/68) compared with the control group (48%; 36/68). A higher, but not statistically significant, incidence of toxicity was found in the control (7/75; 9.7%) versus the experimental group (4/72; 5.1%). Mean length of total hospital stay was significantly longer for patients in the control group (20.3 days) compared with the experimental group (16.0 days) (p = 0.028). The variables from multivariate analysis with a significant impact on length of stay were patient group and length of aminoglycoside therapy. On the basis of a reduced length of stay, a potential cost savings of $1311 per patient can be achieved.\r"

Twenty-four hour energy expenditure and its components, i.e. 'basal metabolic rate', activity energy expenditure and diet-induced thermogenesis were measured, using continuous whole-body indirect calorimetry, in patients receiving total parenteral nutrition while in remission from Crohn's disease (weight 51.9 +/- 9.9 kg, body mass index 19.2 +/- 2.0 kg/m2). 2. Total parenteral nutrition was infused continuously over 24 h in four subjects and cyclically, between 22.00 and 10.00 hours, in eight subjects. Twenty-four hour energy expenditure (6.83 +/- 1.10 MJ/24 h) was lower than total energy intake (10.09 +/- 1.63 MJ/24 h), resulting in a positive energy balance (3.26 +/- 1.42 MJ) in all subjects. Repeated measurements of resting energy expenditure in the continuously fed subjects (5.82 +/- 1.11 MJ/24 h) did not change significantly at different times of day (coefficient of variation 2.2-6.6%). In contrast, in cyclically fed subjects, resting energy expenditure was 24.2 +/- 9.0% higher towards the end of the 12 h feeding period than the 'basal metabolic rate', which was measured just before the start of the feeding period. 3. Diet-induced thermogenesis, calculated as the increment in resting energy expenditure above 'basal metabolic rate' over the 24 h period (adjusted for the reduction in energy expenditure during sleep), was found to be 0.60 +/- 0.29 MJ or 6.1 +/- 3.1% of the energy intake. 4. The energy cost of activity (activity energy expenditure) in the continuously fed patients, calculated as the difference between 24 h energy expenditure and the integrated 24 h measurements of resting energy expenditure, was 0.88 +/- 0.53 MJ, i.e. 12.9 +/- 5.9% of the 24 h energy expenditure. 5. The non-protein non-glycerol respiratory quotient exceeded 1.0 for varying periods of time (0.5-17 h) in 11 subjects, indicating net lipogenesis from carbohydrate. 6. The results demonstrate favourable rates of deposition, during intravenous feeding, of both energy and nitrogen over a 24 h period in patients recovering from an episode of Crohn's disease. The efficacy of these commonly used total parenteral nutrition regimens in these patients is related to three features that are absent in normal healthy individuals, namely a low basal metabolic rate, a low activity-related energy expenditure and prolonged periods of lipogenesis from carbohydrate.\r"

The site of this sodium retention has been localized in the cortical collecting tubule by micropuncture studies. Whether or not this phenomenon is an intrinsic renal problem or is the consequence of changes in hormonal activities is still a matter of discussion. 2. Using the model of puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrotic syndrome in the rat, we measured Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity in nephron segments from control and nephrotic rats and investigated the regulatory role of aldosterone and endogenous-ouabain-displacing factor. 3. Nephrotic animals had a twofold increase in Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity in the cortical collecting tubule only (control versus nephrotic: 1065 +/- 68 versus 2081 +/- 274 pmol h-1 mm-1, P = 0.036), which was not modified by adrenalectomy and was independent of the kidney content of endogenous ouabain-displacing factor. Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity in the cortical collecting tubule correlated with the sodium balance in both control and nephrotic rats. 4. The data are consistent with the view that sodium retention in this model of the nephrotic syndrome is a primary event, i.e. an increase in sodium transport throughout the cortical collecting tubule expressed as a twofold increase in Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity which is no longer under hormonal regulation (aldosterone and endogenous ouabain-displacing factor).\r"

The withdrawal response was obtained as the magnitude of initial depression in ventilation induced by two breaths of O2 from steady-state hypercapnic hypoxia. Nine monozygotic twin pairs, aged 44 +/- SD17 years, and 7 dizygotic twin pairs, aged 39 +/- 8 years, were studied. Mean values for ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia, and the withdrawal response were not different between MZ and DZ. The within-pair variance ratio (VDZ/VMZ) for the withdrawal response was significantly greater than one (p less than 0.05), although neither VDZ/VMZ for the hypoxic response nor that for the hypercapnic response was greater than one. These observations suggest that the peripheral chemosensitivity is influenced by genetic factors even in adult women, including aged subjects, when genetic influence is not apparent in the ventilatory responses to progressive hypoxia and hypercapnia.\r"

Esophageal pressure (Pe), gastric pressure (Pg), airway pressure, and transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi), obtained by subtracting Pe from Pg, were measured using a newly developed multiluminal nasogastric catheter. For each patient, different PS levels were selected every 20 minutes, and measurements were made at each PS level. We defined the optimum PS level as the level that showed the minimum Pe value. Respiratory rate (RR) decreased and tidal volume (VT) increased with an increase in PS level. RR and VT at the optimum PS were 19.7 +/- 5.5 breaths per minute and 11.7 +/- 4.5 ml/kg, respectively. Pdi decreased linearly with increasing PS level in all patients. Mean Pdi at the optimum Ps was 4.2 +/- 1.2 cm H2O. Based on the relationship between Pdi and PS level, we constructed an equation to estimate the optimum PS level as follows: Optimum PS level = [( Pdi during T-piece mode] - 4)/0.8. We conclude that Pdi measurement is helpful for titrating the required PS level.\r"

  ".W": "Assessment of the breathing pattern at maximal exercise in patients is limited because the range of ventilatory responses (minute ventilation; tidal volume; respiratory rate) at maximal exercise in normal humans is unknown. We studied 231 normal subjects (120 women; 111 men) equally distributed according to age from 20 to 80 years. Each subject performed a progressive incremental cycle ergometer exercise test to their symptom-limited maximum. Mean ventilation at the end of exercise (Vemax) was significantly higher in men (mean +/- SD, 97 +/- 25 L/min) than in women (69 +/- 22 L/min) (p less than 0.001). Minute ventilation at the end of exercise as a fraction of predicted maximal voluntary ventilation (Vemax/MVV) for all subjects was 0.61 +/- 0.14 (range, 0.28 to 1.02). There was no difference in Vemax/MVV between men (0.62 +/- 0.14) and women (0.59 +/- 0.14). Tidal volume at the end of exercise (Vtmax) was higher in men (2.70 +/- 0.48 L) than in women (1.92 +/- 0.41 L) (p less than 0.001). Any differences in Vtmax between men and women disappeared when Vtmax was corrected for baseline FVC. Respiratory rate at the end of exercise (RRmax) was 36.1 +/- 9.2 breaths per minute for all subjects. There was no difference in RRmax between men and women. The Vemax correlated best with carbon dioxide output at the end of exercise (r = 0.91; p less than 0.001) and with maximal oxygen uptake (r = 0.90; p less than 0.001) for all subjects. This study of a large group of subjects has demonstrated the wide range of possible breathing patterns which are adopted during exercise and has provided a wide range of \"normal\" responses which must be taken into consideration when maximal ventilatory data from exercise tests are analyzed.\r"

  ".W": "We have shown that in patients with COPD, myocardial efficiency during exercise is enhanced following acute elevations of plasma phosphate (Pi). A decrease in Hb-O2 affinity (increase in P50) was not responsible for the improvement. We postulated that the physiologic benefit was due to the acute reversal of a subclinical myocardial Pi depletion. To further test this hypothesis in a chronic state, we studied nine stable hypoxemic (PaO2 = 64 +/- 2 mm Hg [+/- SEM]) patients with COPD over five weeks: two weeks at normal plasma Pi; and three weeks at elevated plasma Pi, induced by etidronate disodium (Didronel; 750 mg orally daily). Administration of etidronate disodium increased (p less than 0.05) plasma level of Pi (4.4 +/- 0.2 to 5.8 +/- 0.1 mg/dl), RBC level of Pi (3.1 +/- 0.2 to 4.1 +/- 0.2 mg/dl), RBC level of 2,3-DPG (16.2 +/- 1.1 to 21.3 g+/- 1.3 mumol/g of Hb) and P50 (23.7 +/- 0.5 to 26.0 +/- 0.8 mm Hg). At the end of the treatment, the widening of the C(a-v)O2 with exercise (7.1 +/- 0.8 to 8.9 +/- 0.6 ml/dl) was less pronounced than under control conditions (6.9 +/- 0.4 to 10.1 +/- 0.6 ml/dl; p less than 0.02); concomitantly, the crossover point (COP; the PaO2 below which a rightward-shifted Hb-O2 curve causes the C(a-v)O2 to become narrower rather than wider) increased (37 +/- 2 to 49 +/- 1 mm Hg). Indicators of myocardial work efficiency were not affected by etidronate disodium at rest or during exercise. We postulate that during exercise the potential beneficial effect of the rightward shift of the Hb-O2 curve upon cardiac function was negated by the fall of PaO2 to or below the COP level, a situation which would limit increases in tissue O2 extraction.\r"

This study seeks to determine the effects on respiratory pattern of stimulation with CO2 and a change in posture from supine to semirecumbent posture (hips flexed, head of bed elevated at 30 degrees to the horizontal) in patients having undergone cholecystectomy. Canopy spirometry and respiratory inductive plethysmography were used to measure minute ventilation, tidal volume, and rib cage and abdominal motion in 14 otherwise healthy women, prior to elective cholecystectomy and on the first and third postoperative days. Preoperatively, the relative contribution of the chest wall compartment to tidal volume (Vc/VT) was increased both by moving from the supine to the semirecumbent posture and by stimulation with 4 percent inhaled CO2. On the first postoperative day, there was a reduction in abdominal motion. In contrast to what happened in the preoperative period, there was no change in the relative contribution of the rib cage and abdomen when the patients moved from the supine to semirecumbent position. With CO2 stimulation, there was a further increase in the already increased absolute tidal volume of the chest. On the third postoperative day, there was an increase in abdominal motion in the supine and sitting position and during 4 percent CO2 stimulation. These results demonstrate that the response to a change in posture and to 4 percent CO2 stimulation are markedly altered in the postoperative period by the reduction in abdominal motion.\r"

We therefore surveyed 112 patients after a remote myocardial infarction, and 121 cardiologists and internists, regarding the use of sublingual nitroglycerin. Of the physicians, 84 percent routinely prescribed nitroglycerin to patients after a myocardial infarction, and 79 percent of the patients had the tablets available (83 percent of these, at all times). Most patients used the tablets less than once per month, and 37 percent of the patients who always carried nitroglycerin had not used it at all during the preceding year. Although 89 percent of the patients claimed to know when to use the drug, 57 percent had used it or would use it for symptoms such as dizziness, rapid heartbeat, or presyncope. All patients having nitroglycerin claimed it relieved their symptoms, even if the relief was only partial, the time elapsed until relief could not be specified, and the symptoms were of a type unlikely to be relieved by the drug. We suggest that the practice of routinely prescribing nitroglycerin to patients after a myocardial infarction should be reassessed.\r"

The 11 patients whose bronchial hypersensitivity improved with antiallergic agents consisted of eight short-term cases of less than one year's duration and three long-term cases of more than one year's duration. Thus, improvement in bronchial hypersensitivity was observed in 8 of 11 (73 percent) short-term cases, and 3 of 13 (23 percent) long-term cases. A significant improvement in %FEV1 was observed only in the short-term cases treated with antiallergic agents, but the improvement of baseline FEV1 did not seem to explain entirely the improvement in bronchial hypersensitivity seen. The decrease in bronchial hypersensitivity was in parallel with that of other asthmatic symptoms. These results suggest that antiallergic agents might be most effective in the treatment of asthmatic patients with a short-term disease duration.\r"

The subjects were assessed during periods of clinical stability for each year on LTOT. At the onset of treatment, their mean age (+/- SEM) was 60.0 +/- 1.3 years, and at the time of death, they were aged 65.0 +/- 1.3 years. The median duration of LTOT was five years. For each year leading up to death, mean values of FEV1, PaO2, and PaCO2 were obtained. A rate of decline of FEV1 of 73 +/- 10 ml/yr was observed, and this was accompanied by a decline in PaO2 of 0.47 +/- 0.01 kPa/yr. Patients died with a mean FEV1 of 0.55 +/- 0.04 L and a PaO2 of 5.1 +/- 0.2 kPa. A small rise in PaCO2 occurred, on average 0.25 +/- 0.09 kPa/yr, throughout the study, but accelerating in many cases during the three years before death. Hypoxic cor pulmonale appears to be associated with a rapid deterioration in airway function, a steady decline in PaO2, and a slow rise in PaCO2 during the years leading up to death. These physiologic changes measured in a stable clinical state while breathing air appear to occur in spite of LTOT. The LTOT may merely prevent death from episodes of severe hypoxemia while the pathophysiologic changes in the lung progress. Hence the benefit to be expected from LTOT is only temporary. Generally, those patients with lower levels of FEV1 will obtain diminishing clinical benefit, inversely related to the severity of airflow obstruction at the time of commencement of LTOT.\r"

  ".W": "Direct mechanical ventricular actuation (DMVA) is a non-blood-contacting method of biventricular cardiac massage which may be applied expediently for total circulatory support. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of DMVA application for patients suffering refractory cardiac arrest. Following informed consent, DMVA was applied in 22 patients. Vascular access for hemodynamic monitoring was possible in only 12 patients, whose outcomes serve as the basis for this report. The mean age of the patients was 48.2 +/- 4.2 years (seven men; five women). The average time from witnessed cardiac arrest to DMVA application was 81 +/- 9 minutes. Application took less than two minutes from the time of skin incision and resulted in immediate hemodynamic improvement. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures averaged 78 +/- 4 and 41 +/- 4 mm Hg, respectively, with a mean cardiac output of 3.14 +/- 0.18 L/min during a mean of 228 +/- 84 minutes of circulatory support (range, 25 minutes to 18 hours). In selected cases the device was temporarily removed for 2 to 3 minutes and open-chest cardiac massage (OCCM) performed at similar compression rates. DMVA increased arterial pressures 65 percent and cardiac output 190 percent compared to OCCM. Initial arterial pH (7.12 +/- 0.04) improved by the time the device was removed (7.24 +/- 0.05). Serum lactate levels decreased from 18.0 +/- 2.3 mumol/L to 14.9 +/- 2.9 mumol/L. Four patients were successfully defibrillated: two had inadequate cardiac function and died within 1 h, and two were successfully resuscitated, but later died from cardiac failure and respiratory insufficiency. Another patient regained normal neurologic function during DMVA and was successfully bridged to cardiopulmonary bypass for emergent coronary artery bypass grafting, but died later from myocardial infarction. There were only two complications: (1) a cardiac laceration during pericardiotomy (1/22 patients); and (2) a ventricular rupture during OCCM (1/22). No complication resulted from the device. We found DMVA to be a feasible method for acute cardiovascular stabilization in victims suffering refractory cardiac arrest. Human clinical trials employing earlier DMVA application are required to determine its resuscitative potential.\r"

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-one healthy diabetic subjects without neuropathy were studied. Subjects were randomized to take either a double-blind trial of 600 mg ponalrestat or placebo once daily for 6 wk. The median nerve action potential (MNAP) and conduction velocity (NCV), before and after 20 min of forearm ischemia, were measured at the start and finish of the study. Results: RICB (MNAP remaining after ischemia) decreased from 39.5 to 29.4% in the ponalrestat-treated group (P less than 0.05) and increased from 48.1 +/- 10.2 to 49.5 +/- 6.5% in the placebo-treated group. MNAP and NCV were unchanged in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Aldose reductase inhibition with ponalrestat partly reverses RICB in diabetes, perhaps by improving nerve hypoxia or reducing nerve energy substrates.\r"

NIT-1 is a pancreatic beta-cell line established from one of these transgenic mice. Immunocytochemical staining of passage 18 cells showed most contained insulin, with less than 5% containing glucagon, and none containing pancreatic polypeptide or somatostatin. Glucagon content radioimmunoassayed in cell extracts was only 0.27% of the insulin content. Two-hour insulin secretion at 16.5 mM glucose was 638 ng/10(6) cells (41% of intracellular content) compared to only 1.3 ng glucagon (32% of intracellular content). Stimulated insulin secretion was consistently observed in response to 11 and 16.5 mM glucose between passages 11 and 19. At passage 19, both theophylline and tolbutamide stimulated insulin secretion at 5.5 mM glucose. Northern-blot analysis confirmed high levels of insulin mRNA but only trace glucagon mRNA and undetectable somatostatin mRNA. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-induced MHC class I RNA expression was correlated with markedly increased antigen expression at the cell surface. Similarly, a MHC-linked \"occult\" class I-like antigen detected by Cr release assay only after exposure of standard NOD/Lt islet cells to IFN-gamma was strongly induced by IFN-gamma in NIT-1 cells. Cell surface MHC class II antigen was not constitutively expressed on NIT-1 cells and could not be detected after IFN-gamma incubation, despite demonstration of IFN-gamma-induced Aa, Ab, and Li invariant-chain RNA transcripts. Similarly IFN-gamma induction of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (Icam-1) transcripts was not accompanied by demonstrable cell surface expression of ICAM-1 antigen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the renal and hormonal responses to volume expansion induced by water immersion in subjects with diabetic nephropathy (n = 12) and in healthy control subjects (n = 9). Immersion induced similar average increments in sodium excretion (+/- 223 vs. 176 mumol/min) and comparable decrements in renovascular resistance (RVR; -15 vs. -16 U). However, whereas the control subjects responded uniformly, the response among diabetic subjects was highly variable, with a subset of patients exhibiting paradoxical antinatriuresis and vasoconstriction. Immersion was associated with marked elevation of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in plasma of diabetic versus control subjects (61 +/- 9 vs. 19 +/- 2 pM, respectively; P less than 0.001). Yet for each picomolar increment in plasma ANP during immersion, the corresponding increases in urinary excretion of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (26 vs. 279 pmol/min) and sodium (9 vs. 47 mumol/min) and the reciprocal lowering of RVR (0.7 vs. 1.9 U) were blunted in the diabetic versus control group. Volume contraction in the postimmersion period was associated with disproportionate antinatriuresis and renal vasoconstriction in the diabetic group, despite a persistent elevation of ANP (29 +/- 2 vs. 16 +/- 2 pM, P less than 0.01). We propose that renal insensitivity to ANP in diabetic nephropathy could contribute to altered vasoreactivity and abnormal excretory responsiveness to changing plasma volume. Blunted natriuresis in response to ANP release and enhanced sodium retention during volume contraction could account for the expanded extracellular fluid volume that has consistently been reported to accompany the development of diabetic nephropathy.\r"

  ".U": "91285276\r", 
  ".W": "Insulin resistance in skeletal muscle may be an expression of the genetic basis of a common form of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in humans. Impaired insulin action results from an apparent postreceptor defect in insulin signal transduction that limits the influence of the hormone on various protein serine/threonine kinases and phosphatases that are thought to contribute to the mechanism by which insulin affects intracellular events. The fact that numerous responses to insulin are affected suggests that the cause of insulin resistance involves an early step in insulin action. Therefore, we examined the influence of insulin on protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) activities, which may counteract the protein tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor in skeletal muscle of insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant humans. Insulin infusion in vivo produced a rapid 25% suppression of soluble-PTPase activity in muscle of insulin-sensitive subjects, but this response was severely impaired in subjects who were insulin resistant. Insulin did not affect PTPase activity in the particulate fraction of muscle from either group, but basal particulate activity was 33% higher in resistant subjects than in sensitive subjects. Either or both of these abnormal characteristics of PTPase activities could be central to the causes of insulin resistance and NIDDM.\r"

  ".W": "Twelve healthy volunteers were given one week's oral treatment with each of 300 mg nizatidine, 40 mg famotidine, and placebo once daily in a randomised, placebo controlled, double blind study. Three hours after administration, nizatidine led to a significant reduction in the mean (SD) resting heart rate compared with placebo (63.6 (6.4) beats/minute on placebo to 55.9 (7.2) beats/minute on nizatidine (p less than 0.05)), whereas famotidine did not influence the heart rate significantly. Both drugs, however, increased significantly the pre-ejection period and the ratio of pre-ejection period to left ventricular ejection time on mechanocardiography and led to a significant decrease in cardiac output on impedance cardiography. The exercise heart rate on nizatidine as well as the resting heart rate on concurrent administration of nizatidine and the beta receptor blocking agent atenolol were subsequently investigated in the same volunteers. Nizatidine slightly inhibited exercise tachycardia by 4.4% (p less than 0.05). When compared with placebo, the mean resting heart rate was decreased on atenolol alone by a mean of 10.6 beats/minute (p less than 0.01) and fell further on co-administration with nizatidine to a total of 16.1 beats/minute (p less than 0.05 versus atenolol alone). In conclusion, the effect of nizatidine in reducing the heart rate needs careful evaluation in elderly patients with heart failure or those also taking beta blockers. In contrast to famotidine, long term treatment with 300 mg nizatidine a day has mainly negative chronotropic effects.\r"

Six healthy male volunteers (aged 21-33 years) were studied using a triple lumen perfusion technique. A plasma like electrolyte solution containing polyethylene glycol (5 milligrams) as a non-absorbable marker was perfused into the jejunum at 10 ml/min, and net water and electrolyte transport and transepithelial potential difference were measured. Subjects were studied single blind on two occasions with either intravenous atrial natriuretic peptide (6 pmol/min/kg for 90 minutes) or placebo (saline), both after controlled sodium intake over three days. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations rose from (mean (SD)) 10.3 (3.6) pmol/l to a peak of 96.0 (61.8) pmol/l. Jejunal net water and electrolyte fluxes and potential difference were identical in both the atrial natriuretic peptide and the control studies. Compared with placebo atrial natriuretic peptide induced a significantly greater diuresis (peak 10.2 (6.0) v 1.8 (1.0) ml/min, p less than 0.05) and natriuresis (peak 1069 (351) v 376 (208) mumol/min, p less than 0.01) and haemoconcentration (haematocrit 0.405 (0.040) v 0.368 (0.018), p less than 0.01). There was no difference in blood pressure, pulse rate, plasma electrolytes, and plasma osmolality between the two studies. There was no evidence to suggest an effect of atrial natriuretic peptide on jejunal water and electrolyte transport in healthy human subjects.\r"

Twenty four hour collections were made using a rectal catheter in 10 normal volunteers taking their normal diet plus 200 g baked beans. Total daily volume ranged from 476 to 1491 ml (median 705 ml). Women and men (both n = 5) expelled equivalent amounts. The median daily flatus hydrogen volume was 361 ml/24 h (range 42-1060) and the carbon dioxide volume 68 ml/24 h (range 25-116), three volunteers produced methane (3, 26, and 120 ml/24 h), and the remaining unidentified gas (presumably nitrogen) or gases contributed a median 213 ml/24 h (range 61-476). Larger volumes of flatus were produced after meals than at other times. Flatus produced at a faster rate tended to contain more fermentation gases. Flatus was produced during the sleeping period, but the rate was significantly lower than the daytime rate (median 16 and 34 ml/h respectively). Ingestion of a 'fibre free' diet (Fortisip) for 48 hours significantly reduced the total volume collected in 24 hours (median 214 ml/24 h), reduced the carbon dioxide volume (median 6 ml/24 h), and practically eradicated hydrogen production. The volume of unidentified gas was not significantly affected (median 207 ml/24 h). Thus fermentation gases make the highest contribution to normal flatus volume. A 'fibre free' diet eliminates these without changing residual gas release of around 200 ml/24 h.\r"

Both feeds proved effective; nine of 13 patients randomised to receive the amino acid based feed were in clinical remission within three weeks as defined by a simple activity index compared with eight of 11 treated with the whole protein feed. Patients in clinical remission were then crossed over onto the other feed. None of the six patients who were changed to the whole protein feed relapsed over the subsequent three week period compared with three of seven patients who were changed to the amino acid based feed. In responders the median serum C reactive protein concentration fell from 21 mg/l (range 9-82) on entry to 6 mg/l (range 3-19) at six weeks. Seven patients relapsed within eight months of starting solid food (mean 3.7 months), while nine were still in remission (follow up period 3-9 months, median six months). Detailed studies of staged reintroduction of food and permitted food additives were carried out over a four year period in a patient with extensive stricturing small bowel Crohn's disease who had been brought into remission by open treatment with enteral feeding. Carrageenan, other permitted emulsifiers, bread, meat, potatoes, oranges, refined sugar, dairy produce, flour, and rice were all reintroduced without any objective ill effect, but green vegetables provoked a clinical and biochemical relapse within one week of introduction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Blood is used only for gas exchange evaluation and is replaced with plasma in the intervening periods. Data are obtained at blood flow rates (QB) of 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 l/min for gas: blood flow ratios (QG:QB) of 2:1 and 5:1. The test has been conducted on Bentley BOS-CM50 oxygenators (n = 10). With heated dry air ventilation there was no significant change in VCO2 with time for all QB and QG:QB combinations. Plasma leakage did not occur into the gas compartment of the MMO. Similar results were obtained with heated humidified air ventilation. The findings are in agreement with existing animal studies of 4-7 days duration.\r"

About 21% of the unfertilized oocytes were totally degenerated. The majority (56%) of the remaining oocytes was arrested at the metaphase II stage. They contained coherent chromosomal plates and had extruded the first polar body with nuclear material. About 13% of oocytes underwent spontaneous activation. In most of these cases the second polar body was retained and many subnuclei or one big nucleus was formed. Five percent of metaphase II oocytes penetrated by sperm were not activated, likely as a result of oocyte immaturity. The developmental ability of abnormal embryos was poor. Several one-cell-stage zygotes were arrested at the pronuclear stage or at mitosis of the first mitotic division. Polyspermic embryos, especially those which contained four or more pronuclei, did not divide or formed uneven, multinucleated blastomeres. However, some triploid and tetraploid embryos often appeared normal morphologically despite their lethal chromosomal abnormalities.\r"

We have isolated a murine homeobox gene that encodes a homeodomain similar to that encoded by the Drosophila Distalless (Dll) gene. Dll has a crucial role in Drosophila limb morphogenesis, partially specifying pattern along the proximo-distal axis of the limb. The murine counterpart is expressed in a restricted region of the developing brain, within the diencephalon and the adjacent telencephalic regions.\r"

  ".W": "Human immune responses to schistosome infection have been characterized in detail. But there has been controversy over the relative importance of ecological factors (variation in exposure to infection) and immunological factors (acquired immunity) in determining the relationships between levels of infection and age typically found in areas where infection is endemic. Independent effects of exposure and age on the rates of reinfection with Schistosoma haematobium after chemotherapy have been demonstrated in the Gambia and Zimbabwe. This age effect could be the result of acquired immunity to infection. Indeed, allowing for variation in exposure and age, low rates of reinfection in the Gambia are correlated with high amounts of specific IgE antibodies--human IgE can kill S. mansoni schistosomulae in vitro. Further, animals can acquire immunologically mediated resistance to S. mansoni infection, although nonimmunological factors could also be involved. Acquisition of this immunity seems to be related to the cumulative effects of repeated infection and provides only partial protection. These characteristics are consistent with immuno-epidemiological data for both S. mansoni and S. haematobium infections of humans. We have now analysed age-prevalence data for human infection with S. haematobium, and find patterns of variation that are indeed consistent with the epidemiological effects of acquired immunity predicted by mathematical models.\r"

  ".W": "Although most investigators now agree that chronic hyperglycemia is the basis for diabetic retinopathy, this has not been proven definitively. Even if chronic hyperglycemia is the initial common pathway leading to retinopathy and other complications of diabetes, it appears to act by different mechanisms in different tissues. The enzyme, aldose reductase, may play a major role in the development of diabetic retinopathy, but contradictory evidence exists. At the present time, results of the only study of aldose reductase inhibition and diabetic retinopathy reported in humans were negative. Another mechanism worthy of consideration is nonenzymatic glycation (glycosylation) of proteins, but there is no direct evidence of a causal role in diabetic retinopathy. Several growth factors have been identified in the retina that may promote neovascularization, and at least two inhibitors may prevent the process. There is evidence to support a role for basic and, perhaps, acidic fibroblast growth factors in retinal vasoproliferation. Transforming growth-factor beta, a peptide produced by capillary pericytes and smooth muscle cells and activated by the interaction of these cells with vascular endothelial cells, appears to be an important inhibitor of neovascularization, as is the vascular basement membrane.\r"

The sera from the remaining 16 patients and from 12 control subjects reacted either weakly or not at all with the doublet protein. No correlation was found with any specific type of AMD. The serum antibodies also immunocrossreacted with the same proteins from isolated photoreceptor outer segments; this was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence on intact retinas. The crossreactivity of the serum antibodies with a protein of Mr 58 to 62 kD, the lower band present in the bovine purified neurofilament-68 kD preparation, suggests strongly that this protein may be a component of the neuronal cytoskeleton. However, it is not clear whether these autoantibodies play a direct role in the etiology of AMD or represent a nonspecific response to retinal damage.\r"

Leukoplakia is limited to the epithelium, so a selective removal of this part of the mucosa seems to be the best preventive treatment. Carbon dioxide laser surgery accomplishes a superficial removal by evaporation. A total of 70 patients with 103 oral leukoplakias were treated with carbon dioxide laser evaporation. This resulted in an excellent wound healing with virtually no scarring. The patients were followed up during a period of up to 12 years (mean 5.3 years), showing a cure rate of 90%.\r"

Patients were evaluated clinically for 48 to 52 hours following initiation of treatment. The Streptozyme test was used to measure acute to convalescent antibody titer. Both regimens resulted in a greater than 92% cure rate. Early treatment was associated with significantly fewer and milder signs and symptoms on Day 3 and a significantly lower rise in the antibody titer. On the other hand we found 8 (7%) relapses and 18 (16%) early and 14 (13%) late recurrences in this group; all were significantly higher than the corresponding numbers of 2 (2%), 6 (5%) and 4 (3%), respectively, in the late treatment group. This study shows the beneficial effect of early treatment with penicillin V on the clinical course of Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis. This study also shows that delayed penicillin treatment may be associated with a lower incidence of subsequent Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis.\r"

Treatment is chosen on the basis of disease stage and patient response. Combination carbidopa-levodopa (Sinemet) is appropriate for any significant degree of disability, and other antiparkinsonian drugs and anticholinergic agents may be used as adjuncts.

The analysis of somatic mutants of the Igk-VO chi 1 gene reported here indicates that, as found during the primary response, hypermutation is also activated during the secondary response. Somatic mutations in the Igk-VO chi 1 gene increased in sequences obtained at day 14 and day 21 in the primary response and again in the secondary response at days 3, 5, and 7. The ratio of replacement to silent mutations also increased, particularly between days 5 and 7, suggesting that a stage of negative selection operates on new somatic mutants generated in the secondary response. Most Igk-VO chi 1 mutants isolated in the secondary response had the features of selected memory clones (i.e., they carried mutations known to increase binding affinity for the hapten). However, some clones had chain-termination codons, and others had mutations predicting a nonfunctional light chain. At least three and possibly five of these clones also expressed the mutation characteristic of the memory response to 2-phenyloxazolone (His-34----Asn-34/Gln-34). We conclude that after a second antigenic challenge, new somatic variants, including some leading to the loss of antigen binding, are generated by hypermutation of cells derived from the memory pool.\r"

An RNA transcript for cell-free translation was prepared from a cDNA construct that encompasses the region encoding the 980 amino-terminal residues of the viral polyprotein precursor. Processing of the in vitro translation product proceeded cotranslationally in the presence of microsomal membranes and generated four major membrane-associated products. Two of these four major products, named gp35 and gp70, were shown to be transported into microsomes and heavily glycosylated, suggesting that the processing events are partly mediated by the signal peptidase of the endoplasmic reticulum. The other two products, p19 and p21, were probably associated with the outer surface of the microsomal membrane. Analysis of processed proteins translated from a series of truncated forms of the cDNA construct as well as determination of amino-terminal amino acid sequences of gp35 and gp70 indicated that these four products are arranged from the amino-terminal end of the polyprotein precursor in the order: NH2-p22-gp35-gp70-p19. Both gp35 and gp70 could be candidates of initially processed forms of envelope proteins of the hepatitis C virus.\r"

Previously, deregulated expression of exogenous myc genes has been shown to inhibit induced differentiation in Friend erythroleukemia (MEL) cells and in human monoblastic U-937 cells. To examine the nature of the block of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced differentiation in v-myc-expressing U-937 cells, we have studied the effect of other inducers utilizing signal pathways distinct from phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (i.e., 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxycholecalciferol and retinoic acid). We show that v-myc also inhibits differentiation associated with these inducers. However, the v-myc-associated block of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-, 1 alpha,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol-, and retinoic acid-induced differentiation retinoic acid-induced differentiation can be overcome by adding interferon gamma as a costimulatory factor. Costimulation with interferon gamma restores terminal differentiation, as shown by acquisition of a macrophage phenotype and an irreversible growth arrest in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, but induces only limited differentiation on its own. The differentiation is accomplished without altering the expression or nuclear localization of the v-myc protein. These results argue against the widely held view that down-regulation of myc expression is a general prerequisite for terminal differentiation of hematopoietic cells and suggests that interferon gamma induces a signal(s) that circumvents the v-myc activity.\r"

  ".W": "The permeability of gap junctions in cultured striatal astrocytes was investigated by the scrape-loading/dyetransfer technique. Prolonged application of norepinephrine (NE) (10 microM) reduced by half the extent of dye (Lucifer yellow) spread. This effect was linked to the activation of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors since it was mimicked by methoxamine and antagonized by prazosin. The adenosine agonist 2-chloroadenosine (10 microM), which potentiates the NE-evoked activation of phospholipase C (PLC) in striatal astrocytes, also potentiated the NE-evoked closure of gap junctions, the effect being as important as that observed with the uncoupling agent octanol. Measurements of inositol phospholipid turnover performed in identical experimental conditions revealed a close relationship between the extent of PLC activation and the magnitude of the uncoupling process. The effect of NE was mimicked by both phorbol ester and arachidonic acid, suggesting that biochemical events linked to PLC stimulation such as protein kinase C activation and/or eicosanoid production are likely involved in the NE-induced uncoupling. In addition, in the presence of a cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, the stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors by isoproterenol (10 microM) led to a large increase in cAMP accumulation correlated with an extension of dye diffusion. This observation suggests that junctional permeability could also be controlled by a cAMP-dependent mechanism. Altogether these results indicate that intercellular communication between cultured astrocytes can be regulated by different second messenger pathways as a result of the action of neurotransmitters on their receptors.\r"

Amino acid sequence comparisons show that the different alpha subunits fall into at least three classes. These classes have been conserved in animals separated by considerable evolutionary distances; they are present in mammals, Drosophila, and nematodes. We have now obtained cDNA clones encoding two murine alpha subunits, G alpha 12 and G alpha 13, that define a fourth class. The translation products are predicted to have molecular masses of 44 kDa and to be insensitive to ADP-ribosylation by pertussis toxin. They share 67% amino acid sequence identity with each other and less than 45% identity with other alpha subunits. Their transcripts can be detected in every tissue examined, although the relative levels of the G alpha 13 message appear somewhat variable.\r"

A recently identified gene encoding a G protein alpha subunit, G alpha 16, is specifically expressed in human cells of the hematopoietic lineage. The G alpha 16 cDNA encodes a protein with predicted Mr of 43,500, which resembles the G q class of alpha subunits and does not include a pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylation site. In comparison with other G protein alpha subunits, the G alpha 16 predicted protein has distinctive amino acid sequences in the amino terminus, the region A guanine nucleotide-binding domain, and in the carboxyl-terminal third of the protein. Cell lines of myelomonocytic and T-cell phenotype express the G alpha 16 gene, but no expression is detectable in two B-cell lines or in nonhematopoietic cell lines. G alpha 16 gene expression is down-regulated in HL-60 cells induced to differentiate to neutrophils with dimethyl sulfoxide. Antisera generated from synthetic peptides that correspond to two regions of G alpha 16 specifically react with a protein of 42- to 43-kDa in bacterial strains that overexpress G alpha 16 and in HL-60 membranes. This protein is decreased in membranes from dimethyl sulfoxide-differentiated HL-60 cells and is not detectable in COS cell membranes. The restricted expression of this gene suggests that G alpha 16 regulates cell-type-specific signal-transduction pathways, which are not inhibited by pertussis toxin.\r"

Using that vector, we introduced a hybrid RNA maturase (splicing) gene into mitochondria of rho 0 petite cells and showed the gene to be functional in crosses. The hybrid maturase is an in-frame fusion between the N-terminal half of the maturase encoded by intron 1 of the COXI (cytochrome oxidase) gene and the C-terminal half of a similar maturase encoded by COXI intron 2. pMIT transformants can provide a functional maturase in crosses to restore respiration and COXI polypeptide synthesis to a respiratory-deficient strain defective in the synthesis of a maturase encoded by COXI intron 1; the transformant will also restore respiration to two splicing-defective cis mutants of COXI introns 1 and 3. We detect a 68-kDa polypeptide comparable in abundance to other major mitochondrial translation products as a likely product of the hybrid maturase gene. Transformants containing an internal 218-amino acid deletion mutation of the hybrid maturase gene no longer express a functional maturase in crosses and produce the expected shortened polypeptide of approximately 40 kDa; however, those transformants still restore respiration to the COXI cis mutants. These studies show the utility of the pMIT transformation system for the expression and reverse genetic analysis of yeast mitochondrial genes.\r"

Functional substance P-binding antibodies were reconstituted from the cloned variable domains by using vectors for expression in myeloma cells. With these and other vectors a general system for the cloning and expression of mAbs under a series of promoters (of the rat VGF8a gene, the neurofilament light-chain gene, and the methallothionein gene) has been created. The activity of these plasmids was confirmed by expressing the recombinant NC1/34HL mAb in GH3 pituitary cells, PC12 pheochromocytoma cells, and COS cells. DNA from the described constructs can be used to target the expression of the NC1/34HL mAb to the central nervous system of transgenic mice. This procedure will allow us to perturb substance P activity in a controlled way in order to dissect its multiple roles.\r"

This population bound to FN but not to collagen, laminin, or vitronectin. Its binding to FN was inhibited by anti-FN antibody or a mixture of synthetic peptides corresponding to two different sites of FN, termed the V10 sequence and the RGDS (Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser) sequence, which interact, respectively, with the VLA-4 and VLA-5 FN receptors expressed on T-lineage cells. CD4-8- thymocytes also adhered to a monolayer of a thymic stromal cell clone, MRL104.8a, that induces growth-maintenance and differentiation of such thymocytes. The involvement of FN-FN receptor interaction in this adhesion was demonstrated by the following lines of evidence: (i) the MRL104.8a cells expressed FN molecules on their surface and (ii) the adhesion of CD4-8- thymocytes to MRL104.8a monolayers was almost completely inhibited by simultaneous addition of anti-FN antibody and a mixture of peptides (V10 plus RGDS) capable of binding to anti-FN receptors (VLA-4 and -5). Most important, blocking the adhesion of CD4-8- thymocytes to the thymic stromal cell monolayer resulted in potent inhibition of the differentiation of these thymocytes, which was otherwise induced toward the expression of CD4 and/or CD8 molecules. These results indicate that immature CD4-8- thymocytes adhere to thymic stromal cells preferentially through FN-FN receptor interaction and that such adhesion has a critical role in inducing and/or supporting the differentiation of these thymocytes.\r"

Serotonin type 1A receptors may activate a similar pathway in hippocampal neurons. To develop a system in which receptor/G protein/K+ channel coupling can be experimentally manipulated, we have used a highly efficient recombinant vaccinia virus vector system to express human serotonin 1A receptors in primary cultures of rat atrial myocytes. The expressed 1A receptors activated the inwardly rectifying K+ conductance that is normally activated by the endogenous muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Maximal responses to either agonist occluded further activation by the other agonist. The average activation time constants for serotonin were about 5 times slower than for acetylcholine. The data support suggestions that the intracellular signaling pathway from seven-helix receptors to G proteins and directly to ion channels is widespread in excitable cells. After a fraction of the G proteins are activated irreversibly by guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate, subsequent transduction proceeds more efficiently. One possible interpretation is that multiple G-protein molecules are required to activate each channel. Vaccinia virus expression vectors are thus useful for expressing seven-helix receptors in primary cultures of postmitotic cells and have provided a heterologous expression system for the signaling pathway from seven-helix receptors to G proteins and directly to ion channels.\r"

  ".W": "The Rex protein of the type I human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-I) is essential for the replication of this pathogenic retrovirus and, surprisingly, can also replace the function of the structurally distinct Rev protein of the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). Rex action requires a 255-nucleotide viral RNA stem-loop structure termed the Rex RNA response element (RexRE) located in the 3' retroviral long terminal repeat. Rex function leads to the induced cytoplasmic expression of the incompletely spliced family of viral mRNAs that uniquely encode the HTLV-I structural and enzymatic proteins (Gag, Pol, and Env). Our studies now demonstrate that Rex acts by binding directly to the RexRE in a sequence-specific manner. These effects of Rex require the presence of a 10-nucleotide subregion of the RexRE that is essential for Rex function in vivo. Dominant-negative mutants of Rex also bind to the RexRE with high affinity, while a recessive-negative Rex mutant altered within its arginine-rich, positively charged domain fails to engage the RexRE. Analogously, both the wild-type and dominant-negative Rex proteins specifically bind to the structurally distinct HIV-1 Rev response element, a finding that likely underlies the respective stimulatory and inhibitory effects of these HTLV-I proteins in the heterologous HIV-1 system. However, consistent with their lack of amino acid homology, the binding sites for Rex and Rev within the HIV-1 Rev response element are distinct.\r"

  ".U": "91288558\r", 
  ".W": "The microtubule-associated protein tau that is incorporated into paired helical filaments (PHFs) undergoes some form of aberrant posttranslational processing in Alzheimer disease. Difficulties in deciding which changes are critical for PHF formation stem in part from the lack of immunochemical markers specific for PHF tau. The only monoclonal antibody (mAb) that is known to react with PHF tau but not with the predominant normal adult tau species is mAb 423. Another mAb (7.51, described in this paper) recognizes a segment of tau that is included in the minimal recognition unit required by mAb 423. Unlike 423, which is PHF tau-specific, mAb 7.51 recognizes all PHF core-derived tau as well as native soluble tau and recombinant tau expressed in bacteria and so serves as a generic tau marker. Both epitopes are in the 12-kDa fragment released from the Pronase-resistant core of the PHF (which encompasses the tandem repeat region). The mAb 7.51 epitope requires segments located in the last two repeats, which are common to all tau isoforms. The mAb 423 epitope requires sequences located near both the N and the C terminus of the 12-kDa fragment common to three- and four-repeat tau isoforms. Fragments denatured by concentrated formic acid and SDS regain 423 reactivity when denaturing agents are removed. Since the primary amino acid sequences of PHF tau and normal tau are identical in the repeat region, we conclude that 423 reactivity also requires a modification(s) occurring within an approximately 90-residue segment that are not present in tau proteins so far described in the human brain.\r"

  ".W": "The tau protein is a microtubule-associated protein that is normally located in nerve axons. In Alzheimer disease, it is a constituent of paired helical filaments (PHFs), which are the principal fibrous component of the characteristic neurofibrillary tangles. The tau protein, therefore, is abnormally sequestered in an insoluble form in PHFs in the cell body and dendrites in Alzheimer disease. We have used two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to selectively measure the levels of normal, soluble tau protein and of PHF-associated tau protein in the brain. mAb 423 binds to PHFs and recognizes a 12-kDa fragment of tau protein released by formic acid treatment of PHFs, but it does not recognize normal tau protein. In contrast, mAb 7.51 recognizes normal tau protein as well as the PHF core-derived tau fragment, but its epitope is concealed in the PHF-bound form. The differential binding properties for these two mAbs have enabled us in this study to quantify insoluble PHF-associated tau protein in the somatodendritic compartment as well as normal soluble tau protein in its predominantly axonal location. Our findings demonstrate that a distinct immunochemical presentation of tau protein recognized by mAb 423, a PHF-specific marker, can be used to quantify neurofibrillary pathology in Alzheimer disease independently of the presence of normal tau proteins.\r"

The deduced amino acid sequence was about 37% identical with rat Gi1 alpha and Gx alpha proteins and contained three conserved motifs commonly found in all GTP-binding proteins. Disruption of gpa1 was not lethal but conferred sterility and sporulation deficiency on Sch. pombe cells. Thus, the gene is essential for the sexual development and is probably coupled to mating-factor receptors. In contrast to Saccharomyces cerevisiae GPA1, which plays a negative role in mating-factor signal transduction, Sch. pombe gpa1+ apparently has a positive function. A gpa1 transcript of 2.2 kilobases was detected in vegetatively growing cells. A 1.6-kilobase gpa1 transcript appeared in addition to the 2.2-kilobase transcript when cells were derepressed for mating or meiosis.\r"

Using P-element transformation experiments, we demonstrate that control elements guiding Kr expression in the central or in the anterior domain at the blastoderm stage are each composed of multiple subelements that interact synergistically. We provide evidence that bicoid (bcd) and hunch-back (hb) gene products, as well as at least one other activator, are needed to activate Kr expression in the central domain. We localize and describe regulatory elements within the 4.1-kilobase region proximal to the Kr promoter that are responsible for expression in the ectoderm, mesoderm, amnioserosa, and nervous system. Finally, a protein instability motif encoded in the second exon appears to be important for resetting the dynamic Kr pattern.\r"

The dose of ISG was 2 ml i.m. at premedication and 2 ml i.m. on postoperative day 3. Probable non-A, non-B hepatitis developed postoperatively in ten of the 100 controls and two of the 96 in the ISG group. Two ISG patients and three controls with non-A, non-B hepatitis still have increased serum aminotransferase values after 3-5 years, but liver biopsy revealed hepatitis, which histologically was very mild, in only two control and two ISG patients. Low-dose gamma globulin thus reduced the incidence of acute, probable non-A, non-B hepatitis in cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.\r"

The results reveal that HIV testing is clearly not cost-beneficial for most firms, although the benefits of HIV testing may outweigh the costs for some large firms that offer generous fringe-benefit packages and that recruit workers from populations in which the prevalence of HIV infection is high. The analysis also indicates that the testing decisions of unregulated employers are not likely to yield socially optimal economic outcomes and that existing state and federal legislation related to HIV testing in employment settings has been motivated primarily by concerns over social equity.\r"

In view of its enzymatic activity and high copy number, it seems likely that CD45 functions in transmembrane signal transduction by lymphocyte receptors that are coupled to activation of tyrosine kinases. The B cell antigen receptor was found to transduce a Ca(2+)-mobilizing signal only if cells expressed CD45. Also, both membrane immunoglobulin M (mIgM) and CD45 were lost from the surface of cells treated with antibody to CD45, suggesting a physical interaction between these proteins. Finally, CD45 dephosphorylated a complex of mIg-associated proteins that appears to function in signal transduction by the antigen receptor. These data indicate that CD45 occurs as a component of a complex of proteins associated with the antigen receptor, and that CD45 may regulate signal transduction by modulating the phosphorylation state of the antigen receptor subunits.\r"

The p53 mutational spectrum differs among cancers of the colon, lung, esophagus, breast, liver, brain, reticuloendothelial tissues, and hemopoietic tissues. Analysis of these mutations can provide clues to the etiology of these diverse tumors and to the function of specific regions of p53. Transitions predominate in colon, brain, and lymphoid malignancies, whereas G:C to T:A transversions are the most frequent substitutions observed in cancers of the lung and liver. Mutations at A:T base pairs are seen more frequently in esophageal carcinomas than in other solid tumors. Most transitions in colorectal carcinomas, brain tumors, leukemias, and lymphomas are at CpG dinucleotide mutational hot spots. G to T transversions in lung, breast, and esophageal carcinomas are dispersed among numerous codons. In liver tumors in persons from geographic areas in which both aflatoxin B1 and hepatitis B virus are cancer risk factors, most mutations are at one nucleotide pair of codon 249. These differences may reflect the etiological contributions of both exogenous and endogenous factors to human carcinogenesis.\r"

The presence of high concentrations of nitrate in Antarctic waters suggests that it might be possible to increase primary production significantly and thereby alleviate the net accumulation of atmospheric carbon dioxide. An analysis of the food web for these waters implies that the Southern Ocean may be remarkably inefficient as a carbon sink. This inefficiency is caused by the large flux of carbon respired to the atmosphere by air-breathing birds and mammals, dominant predators in the unusually simple food web of Antarctic waters. These top predators may transfer into the atmosphere as much as 20 to 25 percent of photosynthetically fixed carbon.\r"

This small sequence element is in the V3 loop, the envelope domain that is the principal neutralizing determinant of HIV-1. Thus, the V3 loop not only serves as a target of the host immune response but is also pivotal in determining HIV-1 tissue tropism.\r"

There were four men and three women, with a mean age of 60 years. Three patients had multivessel disease and all patients had rest angina; none had evolving myocardial infarction. All patients were pretreated with aspirin and were given heparin. IC rt-PA was infused at the rate of 1 mg/min to a total of 50 mg, and angiographic changes were observed every 15 minutes. At 50 minutes, angiographic improvement was seen in two patients (28%), one of whom had complete and one of whom had partial resolution of ICFD. In two patients (28%) there was no change in the lesion, and three patients (42%) had worsening of the lesion appearance. In two of the latter, paradoxical closure was observed at the end of the infusion, and was treated successfully with ad hoc emergency angioplasty. This pilot study suggests that IC rt-PA at the dosage used may have variable effects on complex coronary lesions associated with unstable angina, and this may be of relevance in further trials evaluating IC thrombolysis in unstable coronary ischemic syndromes.\r"

  ".W": "Pre- and post-treatment myocardial scintigraphy with technetium-99m hexakis 2-methoxy-isobutyl-isonitrile (Tc-99m sestamibi) was performed in patients who underwent thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction comparing planar imaging and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Twenty-one patients were injected with Tc-99m sestamibi before thrombolytic treatment. SPECT and planar imaging were acquired after completion of the treatment. The scintigraphy was repeated 5 days later in 20 subjects. Planar and SPECT studies were evaluated using an uptake score. Patients were divided according to the status of the infarct-related vessel (patent in 13 patients, group 1, and occluded in seven, group 2) and to the presence of functional recovery in serial echocardiographic controls (present in 10 patients, group A, and absent in 10, group B). The scintigraphic defect extent in the 5-day images correlated with the enzymatic infarct size: SPECT: r = 0.75, p less than 0.0002; planar: r = 0.68, p less than 0.002. The decrease of the uptake defects correlated with the reduction of the left ventricular wall asynergy (admission versus 1 month echocardiogram): SPECT: r = 0.92, p less than 0.000001; planar: r = 0.82, p less than 0.00001. The percent decrease of the uptake defects was significantly higher in patients in group 1 and group A compared with group 2 and, respectively, group B--SPECT: group 1: 51.4 +/- 27.7 versus group 2: 13.1 +/- 8.6, p less than 0.02; group A: 64.2 +/- 15.3 versus group B: 11.9 +/- 8.1, p less than 0.0002; planar group 1: 41 +/- 30.4 versus group 2: 7.7 +/- 6.2, p less than 0.05; group A: 52.5 +/- 24.3 versus group B: 6.1 +/- 6, p less than 0.0002. This study confirms the reliability of pre- and post-treatment myocardial scintigraphy with Tc-99m sestamibi for evaluating the outcome of thrombolytic treatment in myocardial infarction. The results seems slightly more accurate using SPECT, but a simple three-view planar study also gives useful data.\r"

  ".U": "91289887\r", 
  ".W": "It has recently been shown that early left ventricular filling is a multifactorially determined phenomenon, the characteristics of which are highly dependent on relative changes in any of its determinants (left ventricular end-systolic volume, the constant of isovolumic left ventricular pressure decay, left atrial pressure at the onset of mitral valve flow, and left ventricular and left atrial compliance). Thus changes in the pattern of filling do not necessarily reflect changes in diastolic properties; they might instead simply reflect changes in loading conditions. To define a clinically implemented approach where the contribution of each of the covariates of early filling to the filling process and their modification by load manipulation could be assessed, nine patients with ischemic heart disease underwent simultaneous assessment of micromanometer left ventricular pressure and two-dimensional echo-guided Doppler mitral flow velocity before and after administration of nitroglycerin (0.2 mg intravenously). Nitroglycerin induced a significant reduction in the early-filling E wave (from 41 +/- 5 cm/sec to 32 +/- 7 cm/sec; p less than 0.002), whereas the late-filling A wave did not change (from 51 +/- 12 cm/sec to 55 +/- 9 cm/sec; p = 0.15), so that the E/A ratio decreased 27 +/- 16% (p = 0.016). End-systolic volume, the constant of isovolumic left ventricular pressure decay, and left atrioventricular pressure crossover at the onset of mitral flow decreased (from 49 +/- 37 to 43 +/- 38 ml [p = 0.016], from 52 +/- 14 to 47 +/- 13 msec [p = 0.016], and from 19 +/- 10 to 12 +/- 7 mm Hg [p = 0.08], respectively), whereas left atrial compliance (defined as stroke volume/atrioventricular pressure crossover) and left ventricular compliance (computed as change in volume/change in pressure at early and late diastole) did not change (p = 0.15 and p = 0.38, respectively); the diastolic pressure-volume relationship, however, was displaced slightly leftward and markedly downward, suggesting relief of pericardial constraint. A multilinear regression analysis, performed with pooled data at baseline and during infusion of nitroglycerin in each patient, identified left atrioventricular pressure crossover at the onset of mitral flow as the only significant predictor (p less than 0.02) of peak E wave velocity in the circumstances considered. Thus the interaction among covariates of early left ventricular filling and the relationship between filling and diastolic left ventricular and left atrial properties can be addressed with relative ease by means of this clinically implemented approach, in an effort to sort out the contribution of each cofactor to such a complex event.\r"

For the group as a whole, averaged right atrial pressure rose significantly (p less than 0.001) from 4.4 +/- 1.8 mm Hg at baseline to 6.7 +/- 3.0 mm Hg during vessel occlusion, and average right atrial ANP concentrations increased significantly (p less than 0.005) from 50.1 +/- 18.8 pg/ml to 59.7 +/- 21.4 pg/ml during balloon inflation. Data analysis of subgroups did not show any differences in right atrial pressure elevations between patients with left anterior descending artery (LAD) or right coronary artery (RCA) disease; ANP elevation was significant only in patients with LAD occlusion (p less than 0.001). In individual patients no statistically significant correlations were found to be present between changes in right atrial pressures and changes in atrial ANP concentrations. During vessel occlusion, PR dropped from 0.86 +/- 1.11 ng/ml/hr to 0.65 +/- 0.85 ng/ml/hr (p less than 0.001) in all patients, and PA decreased from 63.0 +/- 50.9 ng/ml to 52.2 +/- 43.4 ng/ml (p less than 0.01). Our data support the concept that, although an increase in right atrial pressure leads to ANP release in the majority of patients, atrial pressure and stretch are not the only regulatory factors of ANP release in humans.\r"

Receptor-effector systems for atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), which is known to regulate intracellular calcium (Ca2+), were studied in the kidney during hypertensive-diabetic cardiomyopathy in rats. Animals were divided into four groups: control, diabetic (D), hypertensive (H), and diabetic plus hypertensive (D + H). Diabetes was induced by a streptozotocin (65 mg/kg) injection and hypertension was induced by abdominal aortic constriction; studies were done at 1 and 6 weeks. Plasma ANP was increased at 1 week in the D, H, and D + H groups. There was a significant increase in the activity of Ca2+ + magnesium (Mg2+) adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), which acts as a Ca2+ pump, in the kidney basolateral membrane from D, H, and D + H group at the 1 week study. Ca2+ + Mg2+ ATPase, on the other hand, was significantly decreased in the D + H group only at 6 weeks. This was associated with a decrease in plasma ANP, an increase in the kidney ANP receptor number, and a decrease in guanylate cyclase activity. The response of the Ca2+ pump to ANP was also attenuated. Since ANP is known to mediate its cellular effects in part by increasing Ca2+ + Mg2+ ATPase, the observed changes in the D + H group may contribute to the development of nephropathy and CHF.\r"

  ".U": "91289893\r", 
  ".W": "The atria, strategically located at the junction of the venous and arterial circulation, contain a network of neural and humoral structures by which they sense and regulate intravascular volume. Atrial receptors, most commonly consisting of complex unencapsulated nerve endings discharging into myelinated vagal fibers, are located in the intrapericardial portions of the caval and pulmonary veins and the adjacent atrial walls. Receptor activation by atrial distension results in increased afferent vagal fiber discharge, which in turn leads to tachycardia (Bainbridge's reflex) and decreased renal sympathetic nerve activity, renal vasomotor tone, and antidiuretic hormone activity. In addition, atrial distension also releases ANF, a peptide with potent diuretic, natriuretic, and vasorelaxant actions. The combined effect of these neurohumoral changes is the production of a large hypotonic diuresis. In the clinical setting the volume-regulating role of the atria is demonstrated by the tachycardia-polyuria syndrome. Laboratory and clinical evidence points to the activation of atrial neurohumoral mechanisms in response to atrial distension as the mediators of the polyuria that often accompanies paroxysmal tachycardias. The involvement of these mechanisms in other forms of cardiac congestion and the capability to easily measure in the blood an index of atrial distension, namely ANF, provide the opportunity to elucidate the pathophysiology and hence to open new therapeutic avenues in many cardiac disorders.\r"

  ".U": "91289900\r", 
  ".W": "To evaluate the prevalence of left ventricular thrombi after thrombolytic therapy, 144 consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were prospectively studied with two-dimensional echocardiography 1 and 8 days after admission. Patients were treated 2.1 +/- 0.8 hours after the onset of symptoms. Thrombolytic protocol included 120 mg of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), 5000 IU of heparin, followed by a continuous infusion of 25,000 IU/24 hours for at least 5 days, and 250 mg of aspirin a day. Seventy-six patients had AMI of the anterior wall; of these, seven (9.2%) developed left ventricular thrombi. The remaining 68 patients had infarctions of the inferior wall; of these, two (2.9%) developed left ventricular thrombi. Since anterior wall infarction not treated with thrombolytic therapy is associated with a 25% to 40% rate of left ventricular thrombi, we conclude that early thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA, heparin, and aspirin reduces the formation of left ventricular thrombus in AMI of the anterior wall. Apical left ventricular thrombi developed more frequently in patients with previous infarctions compared with those without (4 of 17 versus 4 of 127, p = 0.01). During the 12-month follow-up period, no patient in the study had manifestations of peripheral emboli.\r"

  ".W": "If coronary angioplasty can be safely performed at the time of the initial diagnostic catheterization, it may result in shorter hospitalization stays and lower overall costs. Combined coronary angiography and angioplasty was performed electively on 733 patients between January 1, 1984, and September 1, 1988. These patients were divided into three major subgroups based upon their indications for angioplasty: 444 (61%) procedures were performed for restenosis; 190 (26%) procedures were performed in patients for unstable angina; and 99 (13%) procedures were performed in patients without unstable angina or previous angioplasty. A subset of 219 patients from this study who underwent elective combined coronary angiography and angioplasty during 1986 were compared with a matched population of 191 patients from the angiography and angioplasty as separate procedures). The success and complication rates were similar for both of these groups. Patients who underwent the combined procedure were hospitalized for a mean of 4.6 days with average total charges of $11,128, compared with 8.0 days and $13,160 for patients undergoing separate procedures (p less than 0.001). Significant savings were also realized with respect to total contrast dose, fluoroscopic time, and total procedural time. Thus in informed patients with suitable coronary anatomy, the strategy of combined angiography and angioplasty may present an opportunity for decreasing hospitalization stay, reducing total charges for revascularization, and reducing radiation exposure without compromising the safety or effectiveness of the procedure.\r"

  ".W": "The demonstration in animals that recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator produces prolonged thrombolysis after its clearance from the circulation has prompted a few pilot studies of bolus administration in patients. Alteplase (bolus dose of 70 mg) resulted in the highest recanalization rate in our previous pilot study comparing bolus doses of 50, 60 and 70 mg of alteplase in patients with acute myocardial infarction. The aim of the present trial was to assess the efficacy and safety of the same bolus dose in a larger number of patients. A further objective was to study the angiographic reocclusion rate at 12 to 24 hours in patients who had a recanalized infarct-related coronary artery at 90 minutes and were randomized at that time to a bolus dose or an infusion for 3 hours of 30 mg of alteplase. Sixty patients with acute myocardial infarction and angiographically documented total occlusion of the infarct-related coronary artery before thrombolysis were treated within 5 hours of onset of symptoms with an intravenous 70-mg bolus dose of alteplase (or 80 mg if body weight was greater than or equal to 90 kg). Each patient received 5,000 IU of heparin intraarterially and 100 mg of aspirin by mouth before administration of alteplase. Coronary angiography was repeated 60 and 90 minutes after alteplase administration. The recanalization rate of the infarct-related coronary artery was 55% (95% confidence interval, 43 to 66%) at 60 minutes and 48% (95% confidence interval, 37 to 60%) at 90 minutes. Pretreatment levels of lipoprotein (a) were not significantly related to recanalization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) secretory function is preserved after cardiac transplantation. Thirteen hemodynamically stable outpatients performed supine exercise on a bicycle an average of 7 months after orthotopic cardiac transplantation. Right atrial pressure increased 2.2-fold (6 +/- 1 to 13 +/- 2 mm Hg) and pulmonary artery wedge pressure 2.1-fold (11 +/- 1 to 23 +/- 7 mm Hg) with exercise in the transplant recipients. Resting venous ANP level (114 +/- 19 pg/ml) and peak exercise venous level (373 +/- 61 pg/ml) was elevated in transplant recipients (p less than 0.001) compared with control subjects (21 +/- 1 and 92 +/- 14 pg/ml, respectively. This represents a 3.3-fold (114 +/- 19 to 373 +/- 61 pg/ml) increase in the ANP level from resting to exercise in transplant recipients and a 4.4-fold (21 +/- 1 to 92 +/- 14 pg/ml) increase in control subjects. A correlation between venous ANP levels and hemodynamics (right atrial pressure) was observed r = 0.49 p = 0.01. It is concluded that ANP levels at rest are elevated after cardiac transplant, the levels correlate with the intracardiac hemodynamics, and exercise-induced augmentation of plasma levels occurs.\r"

DNA data-base comparisons of the sequences surrounding the repeat indicate that the synapsin I gene and the A-raf-1 gene lie immediately adjacent to each other, in opposite orientation. PCR amplification of this synapsin I/A-raf-1 associated repeat by using total genomic DNA from members of the 40 reference pedigree families of the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humaine showed it to be highly polymorphic, with a PIC value of .84 and a minimum of eight alleles. Because the synapsin I gene has been mapped previously to the short arm of the human X chromosome at Xp11.2, linkage analysis was performed with markers on the proximal short arm of the X chromosome. The most likely gene order is DXS7SYN/ARAF1TIMPDXS255DXS146, with a relative probability of 5 x 10(8) as compared with the next most likely order. This highly informative repeat should serve as a valuable marker for disease loci mapped to the Xp11 region.\r"

Most reported mutations have been single base substitutions. We now report three different frameshift mutations in three unrelated individuals with type IA OCA. The first individual has a single base deletion within a series of five guanidines, resulting in a premature stop codon in exon I on one allele and a missense mutation at codon 382 in exon III on the homologous allele. The second individual is a genetic compound of two separate frameshift mutations, including both the same exon I single base deletion found in the first individual and a deletion of a thymidine-guanidine pair, within the sequence GTGTG, forming a termination codon (TAG) in exon I on the homologous allele. The third individual has a single base insertion in exon I on one allele and a missense mutation at codon 373 in exon III on the homologous allele. The two missense mutations occur within the copper Bbinding region and may interfere with either copper binding to the enzyme or oxygen binding to the copper. These five different mutations disrupt tyrosinase function and are associated with a total lack of melanin biosynthesis.\r"

Treatment with the alternative drug of children not cured with the first treatment resulted in negative stools in 11 of 12 cases examined one month after the second round of therapy. In order to minimize the risk of the development of drug resistance, our data suggest that infected patients be treated with one drug, and therapeutic failures with another. Evidence from experiments in mice with isolates obtained after failures of one treatment in children suggests that therapeutic failure does not necessarily indicate the presence of drug-resistant schistosomes. The value of using mice to assess drug resistance in schistosomes is questioned.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of variation of arterial CO2 tension (PaCO2) on the electroencephalogram (EEG) and posterior tibial nerve somatosensory cortical evoked potentials (PTN-SCEP) during opioid/N2O anesthesia have not been well documented. We studied the effects of hypocapnia (PaCO2 approximately 23 mmHg) and hypercapnia (PaCO2 approximately 50 mmHg) during steady-state alfentanil/N2O anesthesia in 16 patients. EEG and PTN-SCEP were recorded continuously, while PaCO2 was altered in 15-min intervals by varying the inspired CO2 concentration. Hypocapnia caused significant increases in power in the delta, theta, and beta bands (P less than 0.01), with the greatest increase observed in the alpha band. Relative power increased in the alpha band but remained unchanged in the delta, theta, and beta bands. Median frequency and 95% spectral edge frequency were unaltered during hypocapnia. In contrast, hypercapnia caused a significant decrease of power in the alpha and beta bands, whereas delta and theta power remained unchanged. This was reflected in a significant decrease of the 95% spectral edge frequency, from 8.9 (6.7-11.6) to 7.0 (5.6-8.6) Hz. All EEG parameters returned to normal upon restoration of normocapnia. There was a significant negative correlation between power in the alpha band and end-tidal CO2 in all patients (r = 0.47 to -0.89). PTN-SCEP latencies and amplitudes were not significantly different from control values during hypocapnia and hypercapnia. It is concluded that variations in PaCO2 within the limits 20-50 mmHg produce substantial changes in the EEG power spectrum, especially in the alpha band (8-12 Hz), but do not alter PTN-SCEP.\r"

The mean number of intubation attempts was 1.83 (range, one to five) with difficulty of intubation of 6.48 and confirmation of 7.75, on a linear scale from 0 (lowest) to 10 (highest). Determination of ETT position revealed intratracheal intubation in 96% and esophageal intubation in 4%. Placement was confirmed by direct visualization or radiography in all cases. Sensitivity and specificity for ETT localization was 100% (P less than .0001). CONCLUSION: This hand-held infrared capnometer reliably confirms ETT placement under emergency conditions.\r"

The six male HL were subsequently compared with eight male heart transplant recipients (H), as well as the 12 male C. All subjects had normal spirometry, but lung volumes of both transplant groups were somewhat less than those of C. The HCVR of HL and C were indistinguishable (2.68 +/- 0.28 versus 2.71 +/- 0.22 L/min/mm Hg, respectively). The increment of mouth occlusion pressure (delta Pm0.1/delta CO2), however, was markedly greater in HL (P much less than 0.01). The three male groups also had equivalent HCVR, and again, the HL had an increased delta Pm0.1/delta CO2. HL men exhibited larger increments of VT and decreased frequency responses during CO2 rebreathing than did male C and H, although these differences were statistically significant only in the comparison between the transplant groups. We conclude that HL with normal spirometry have appropriate HCVR, despite pulmonary denervation. Pm0.1 responses of these subjects are increased, however, reflecting either a compensatory response to greater respiratory impedances or an occult alteration of ventilatory mechanics. Moreover, compared with subjects with similar pulmonary function, e.g., heart transplant recipients, the breathing pattern of HL during progressive hypercarbia is consistent with the absence of vagal-mediated inflation inhibition.\r"

  ".W": "A significant limitation of standard bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) technique is the inability to measure or calculate epithelial lining fluid (ELF) volume and, therefore, in vivo concentrations of substances in the ELF. We evaluated a new rewash BAL procedure with the radiolabeled tracer technetium pertechnetate (99mTcO4-) that theoretically should be immune to even exaggerated fluid shifts during BAL. To test this theory, we measured ELF volume in control sheep using isosmotic (280 mosm/L) hypoosmotic (140 mosm/L) and hyperosmotic (570 mosm/L) BAL solutions to induce exaggerated fluid shifts during the lavage procedure. The mean ELF volume of the lavaged lung segment was not significantly different for the three solutions (isosmotic, 1.7 +/- 0.8 ml; hypoosmotic, 1.1 +/- 1.2 ml; hyperosmotic, 2.1 +/- 1.6 ml). The slope of the 99mTcO4- disappearance curve, however, was significantly steeper for the hyperosmotic solution (-0.40 +/- 0.04%/min) compared with the other solutions (isosmotic, -0.14 +/- .01%/min; hypoosmotic, -0.12 +/- 0.07%/min). Calculation of ELF volume using sodium as an endogenous tracer gave consistently smaller values with each of the mannitol solutions (isosmotic, 0.21 +/- 0.30 ml; hypoosmotic, 0.02 +/- 0.03 ml; hyperosmotic, 0.18 +/- 0.18 ml). The failure of sodium to provide accurate estimates of the ELF volume may be due to complicated sodium movement in the lung and errors in our assumption of the initial concentration of sodium in the ELF fluid. We conclude that the rewash BAL technique with 99mTcO4- gives values of ELF volume that are not significantly affected by even exaggeration of the fluid flux that invariably accompanies BAL.\r"

  ".W": "We tested the hypothesis that airway perfusion modifies the contractile response of airway smooth muscle to allergen challenge by influencing the clearance of locally released spasmogens. In six intact, lightly sedated, sheep allergic to Ascaris suum, we measured tracheal mucosal blood flow (Qtr) with a soluble gas uptake method and tracheal dead space (Vtr), an index of airway smooth muscle tone, by helium dilution before and serially after local aerosol challenge with A. suum extract or ragweed extract (control). The former challenge was repeated during continuous intravenous infusion of either vasopressin or nitroglycerin, which by themselves had no effect on Vtr and decreased and increased Qtr, respectively. Ragweed had no effect on Qtr and Vtr, whereas A. suum increased mean (+/- SE) Qtr by 111 +/- 31% (p less than 0.05) and decreased mean Vtr by 15 +/- 2% (p less than 0.05) immediately after challenge, with Qtr returning to baseline by 40 min and Vtr by 80 min. Vasopressin infusion prevented the A. suum-induced increase in Qtr and prolonged the decrease in mean Vtr (p less than 0.05). During nitroglycerin infusion, A. suum failed to alter Qtr or Vtr. Vasopressin and nitroglycerin had no effect on the contractile responses of tracheal smooth muscle to A. suum in vitro. These results indicate that the effects of vasopressin and nitroglycerin on antigen-induced airway smooth muscle contraction in vivo were due to alterations in airway blood flow rather than to alterations in the release of or airway smooth muscle responsiveness to chemical mediators.\r"

Leukotrienes B4 and D4 were recovered most frequently: 59% and 54%, respectively. Leukotriene B4 was found in highest concentration, 1.29 +/- 3.46 ng/0.1 mL. The concentrations of leukotrienes B4 (p less than .03), (4 (p less than .01), and E4 (p less than .02) were significantly higher in culture-positive than in culture-negative MEEs. Neither the concentration nor the type of AA metabolite correlated with bacterial species isolated, chronicity of effusion, age of subject, or consistency of MEE. These data suggest that the AA metabolites are synthesized relatively frequently during otitis media of childhood. Leukotriene B4 is the most frequently detected AA metabolite in MEEs and is highly associated with the presence of viable bacteria.\r"

  ".W": "An animal model of protracted acute peritonitis was used to study the effects on survival of different amounts and types of dietary fat. Guinea pigs (n = 132) were provided with gastrostomies and allowed to recover. Intraperitoneal osmotic pumps were then placed, allowing for effusion of viable bacteria during the next week. Three days after pump implantation, the animals were randomized to receive one of nine diets, differing only in fat content (3.5%, 14%, or 56% of total calories) and fat composition (100% Microlipid [primarily safflower oil, rich in linoleic acid], 100% MaxEPA [fish oil containing 35% omega-three fatty acids], or a 50:50 mixture of both oils). At the end of 2 weeks, survival rates were compared. Among all types of fat used, the level of fat did not affect outcome, with survival rates of 13% (6 of 45) at the low level of fat used, 30% (13 of 44) at the medium level, and 26% (11 of 43) at the high level (P greater than 0.10). However fat composition significantly influenced survival across all levels of fat, with a 39% (17 of 44) survival rate in the groups given equal amounts of Microlipid and MaxEPA, compared either to 21% (9 of 44) for the 100% Microlipid groups, or to 9% (4 of 44) for the 100% MaxEPA groups (p less than 0.05). A second experiment was performed with 58 animals fed five different mixtures of fats, all at 14% of total calories. Diets were made with fat ratios of 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100 Microlipid to MaxEPA. The survival rate in the 50:50 group was 83% (10 of 12), which is significantly higher than the survival rates with any of the others (p less than 0.05). It is concluded that the amount of fat in the diet does not strongly influence outcome in this model. However an equal mixture of safflower and fish oils significantly improves survival rates compared to diets made with single-oil preparations.\r"

In this study the combined effect of the methionine-deprived TPN with administration of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was examined in Yoshida Sarcoma (YS)-bearing rats, from aspects of effects on the tumor metastasis and the host animal's life span, in the following four groups treated with: methionine-deprived TPN with administration of 5-FU, methionine-deprived TPN without administration of 5-FU, L-methionine-contained TPN plus 5-FU, and L-methionine-contained TPN without 5-FU. In the first experiment, TPN was continued for 8 days in the four groups, and the anti-cancer effect of methionine-deprived TPN and administration of 5-FU based on both the growth of the primary tumor at the implanted site and the tumor metastasis was studied from the view point of pathologic findings of animals killed immediately after these treatments. In experiment 2 the survival period was examined after these treatments for 10 days with subsequent oral feeding until death. The results were as follows: proliferation of YS, transplanted subcutaneously, was markedly suppressed; particularly hematogenous metastasis, characteristic in YS, was prominently blunted then obtained an apparent longer survival period in rats treated with the methionine-deprived TPN with administration of 5-FU.\r"

A graded exonuclease deletion technique was used to produce 12 clones with deletions of 175-308 nucleotides in the first conserved domain of envelope. This included 9 clones with frameshift deletions and 3 clones with in-frame deletions. Isogenic pairs of env deletion clones were produced with or without an additional deletion in the vif and vpr genes. Upon transfection, all clones produced virus particles, as determined by p24 antigen, reverse transcriptase, and sucrose gradient assays with conditioned media. Virus particles produced from clones with deletions in env or vif and vpr, or both regions, banded on sucrose gradients with a mobility similar to that of virus produced by the parental clone. The p24 gag capsid protein in the particles was resistant to trypsin, but the particles were disrupted by treatment with Triton X-100, suggesting the presence of a surrounding lipid bilayer. Furthermore, electron microscopic studies revealed both mature and immature virus particles derived from COS cells transfected with the env deletion clones. Cocultivation experiments with lymphoid cells and cells transfected with each of the env deletion clones demonstrated that the virus particles were noninfectious.\r"

Further immunoblotting using either cyanogen bromide fragmented RT or truncated mutants of RT along with cross-competition studies enabled the location of various immunogenic regions of RT to be identified. Three antibodies recognized a linear epitope in the N-terminal region (amino acids 128-176). Also, a neutralizing RT antibody recognized a conformational epitope in this region. Three monoclonals had epitopes mapped to linear sequences in the RNase H region at the C-terminus of the RT. Another neutralizing antibody, also requiring folding of the RT protein had its epitope more centrally located (231-353). Of the remaining 13 monoclonals, 7 were roughly located in the C-terminal region and required folding of the protein for epitope recognition and only three of the remaining six could be mapped to conformational epitopes in N-terminal and central regions of the RT. None of the antibodies tested recognized HIV-2 RT products p68 and p55 in Western blot.\r"

To prove apnoea, the ventilator was disconnected for ten minutes and oxygen was insufflated to avoid hypoxaemia. No respiratory movement was seen in any patient. Ten minutes after disconnecting the ventilator, PaCO2 was increased to 78 +/- 3 mmHg and pH was reduced to 7.17 +/- 0.02. Adequate oxygenation was maintained in all patients. Cardiac output increased from 4.8 +/- 0.7 to 5.7 +/- 0.8 L.min-1 (P less than 0.05), and mean pulmonary artery pressure increased from 11 +/- 1 to 17 +/- 2 mmHg (P less than 0.01). However, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, pulmonary artery wedge pressure and right atrial pressure did not change. Plasma catecholamines were measured in three patients. Plasma norepinephrine concentrations increased in all three patients but the changes in plasma epinephrine were minimal. These circulatory responses to acute hypercapnia were less than those reported in awake volunteers and in patients during general anaesthesia. However, since plasma norepinephrine concentration increased during the test, some sympathoadrenal response, probably of spinal origin, was present, and may have prevented the direct depressant circulatory effects of acute hypercapnia. In conclusion, the apnoea test did not produce haemodynamic disturbances when respiratory acidosis was limited to a pH 7.17 +/- 0.02 and PaCO2 60-80 mmHg.\r"

However, no change was observed in perfusion distribution following thoracotomy during normocapnia, PaO2 decreased from 160 +/- 10 to 113 +/- 15 mmHg together with a shift of perfusion toward the low Va/Q region. However, no change was observed in Qs/Qt. When ventilation was changed from normocapnia to hypocapnia with thoracotomy, PaO2 decreased from 113 +/- 15 to 98 +/- 12 mmHg and Qs/Qt increased from 0.3 +/- 0.8 to 3.4 +/- 2.0%. After thoracotomy, a shift of perfusion toward the low Va/Q region was observed, which was probably responsible for the decrease in PaO2. The decrease in PaO2 during hypocapnia was due to an increase in the true shunt rather than the development of low Va/Q region. Hypocapnia combined with thoracotomy produced a further reduction of PaO2 and a greater increase in Qs/Qt.\r"

DESIGN: Experiments were performed on sperm samples from two groups of men classified, respectively, as fertile and infertile, based on their reproductive history. SETTING: The study was carried out in an andrologic laboratory of a University Hospital. PATIENTS, PARTICIPANTS: Fertile men were healthy sperm donors; infertile men were patients with fertility problems. INTERVENTIONS: D-mannose binding sites were visualized by fluorescence microscopy using a mannosylated neoglycoprotein probe. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The hypothesis as reported in the objective section was formulated before data collection and was not modified thereafter. RESULTS: Sperm from fertile men displayed a characteristic pattern of changes in the expression of D-mannose binding sites during in vitro capacitation. This pattern was altered in sperm from infertile men. CONCLUSIONS: If the relationship between defective expression of D-mannose binding sites and decreased sperm fertilizing ability is validated by parallel tests of sperm-zona binding, it may be used for development of chemical tests replacing the current ones using human zonae pellucidae.\r"

DESIGN: Experimental. SETTING: Reproductive research laboratory. ANIMALS: Fourteen cyclic cynomolgus monkeys receiving hMG alone for 8 days or buserelin acetate plus 8 (group 1), 12 (group 2), or 16 (group 3) days of hMG administration always starting from day 1 of the cycle. RESULTS: The different treatments were effective in over-riding the specific ovulatory quota of 1, and more large follicles developed in treatments involving long duration and higher doses of hMG. In buserelin acetate plus hMG treatments, the frequency of dissociated follicles and follicles in late atresia were, respectively, lower and higher than in hMG alone treatment. The numbers of recoverable mature oocytes (germinal vesicle breakdown) were similar to the numbers of such oocytes recovered after hyperstimulation performed for human in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET). However, the number of mature oocytes enclosed in typically preovulatory follicles was very low because there were numerous dysmature follicles. CONCLUSION: These data suggest a deleterious effect of buserelin acetate plus hMG treatments on the recruitable follicles at the time when treatments start. The implications of these observations in the field of human IVF-ET are discussed.\r"

INTERVENTIONS: Norplant contraceptive implants were inserted in 31 subjects between 13 and 77 months before this study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, estradiol (E2), and progesterone (P) were serially assayed for one menstrual cycle. RESULTS: Almost half of the cycles among Norplant users were anovulatory; all the rest (55%) had some form of dysfunction: diminished gonadotropin surge, luteal phase insufficiency (low P levels and shortened luteal phase), and E2 profiles different from normal controls. CONCLUSIONS: Anovulation is clearly one of the main mechanisms of action of Norplant, but even in presumptive ovulatory cycles, the dysfunctions described possibly contribute to the high contraceptive effectiveness of Norplant.\r"

DESIGN: Retrospective. SETTING: Assisted reproductive technology center. PATIENTS: Nine normally cycling women from whom blood samples were drawn daily; 18 patients undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. RESULTS: During the menstrual cycle, average (+/-SE) hGH levels in serum ranged between 7.97 +/- 2.71 microIU/mL on day 11 and 2.11 +/- 0.38 microIU/mL on day 22. Serum hGH levels did not correlate with peripheral levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone, P, or E2 and were related to the serum E2:FSH ratio (adhibited as an index of ovarian response to FSH) on cycle day 10 only. Levels of hGH in sera of patients undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation were near 4 microIU/mL and were directly related to peripheral E2 levels at the time of induction of oocyte maturity. When corrected for differences in follicle number between stimulated patients, changes in serum E2 content were independent of respective hGH levels. CONCLUSION: The findings challenge speculation that endogenous peripheral hGH content might relate to ovarian responsiveness to FSH.\r"

PATIENTS, PARTICIPANTS: The study concerned five infertile women 29 to 39 years of age. INTERVENTIONS: Ovaries were stimulated with human menopausal gonadotropin under gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) action. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The height of platelet aggregation was compared between FFs and synthetic PAF-acether. RESULTS: Mean FF concentration of PAF-acether was 1,367 to 3,467 pg/mL among women. Values were higher for patients in a long than in a short GnRH-a protocol (P less than 0.05). However, PAF-acether concentration was not related to fertilization rate. CONCLUSIONS: Platelet-activating factor-acether is possibly involved in oocyte release from the follicle, a process occulted by follicular puncture.\r"

SETTING: Patients were treated in the fertility clinic and in vitro fertilization unit of our institution, which is a government, university-affiliated hospital. PATIENTS: Ninety anovulatory patients were treated with hMG. Of these, 12 were at high risk for ovarian hyperstimulation. The criteria for potential ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome were rising excessive 17 beta-estradiol levels of greater than 1,500 pg/mL in the presence of multiple follicles with a mean diameter greater than 15 mm. These patients were transferred for continuation of treatment to our in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) unit. INTERVENTIONS: The patients underwent ova retrieval by the ultrasonically guided transvaginal approach. RESULTS: Of the 12 patients, 5 conceived (41.6%). Two patients had a mild ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, and 1 had a moderate syndrome and was hospitalized for observation for 48 hours. CONCLUSION: In view of the results, we suggest that IVF-ET should be considered in cases in which ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is imminent, rather than withhold human chorionic gonadotropin and cancelling the treatment cycle.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective. SETTING: Outpatient IVF program. PATIENTS: Eighty patients exhibited four early estradiol (E2) patterns. Patients with pattern A and B remained on a flare-up ovarian stimulation protocol. Patients with pattern C were randomized to three ovarian stimulation protocols. Patients with pattern D were treated with the flare-up protocol using a high pure follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) dose. RESULTS: Patterns, A, B, C, and D occurred in 44%, 16%, 25%, and 15% of the patients, respectively. The E2 pattern recurred in 77% of subsequent IVF cycles. Pattern A and B patients achieved a 41% (23/56) and 22% (5/23) ongoing pregnancy rate (PR) per stimulated cycle. An early luteal phase Lupron protocol had the best ongoing PR per stimulated cycle (10/27, 37%) in patients with a pattern C response. Pattern D patients had a 20% (5/25) ongoing PR per stimulated cycle. CONCLUSION: The Lupron screening test allows prospective selection of stimulation protocols in ovulatory patients undergoing IVF. Early E2 patterns A and B should be treated with the flare-up protocol. Pattern C patients benefit from the luteal phase Lupron protocol and pattern D patients benefit from a high pure FSH flare-up protocol.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective study of all patients undergoing hMG-IUI between January 1, 1984 and December 31, 1989. SETTING: University affiliated private clinic. PATIENTS: Four hundred twenty-four infertility patients undergoing 779 cycles of hMG-IUI. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The relationship between estradiol (E2), number and size of follicles, age, and initial semen quality on pregnancy and multiple gestations in hMG-IUI cycles. RESULTS: The number of follicles greater than or equal to 12 mm was correlated with births and predicted all multiple births (r = 0.140, P less than 0.001). The corrected birth rate was 25.8% for age less than 35 and 14.0% for age greater than or equal to 35 when four or more follicles were greater than or equal to 12 mm. The uncorrected clinical pregnancy rate (PR) and birth rate were 12.8% and 10.5%, respectively. Decreased births were associated with tubal adhesions alone (P less than 0.03) or with endometriosis (P less than 0.002), more than four cycles of treatment (P = 0.01), initial sperm count less than 5 x 10(6) per mL (P less than 0.01), initial sperm motility less than 30% (P less than 0.002), and age greater than or equal to 35 (P less than 0.01). Estradiol was correlated with birth rate (r = 0.160, P less than 0.001), which increased from 3.6% when E2 was less than 500 pg/mL to 19.6% when E2 was greater than or equal to 2,500 pg/mL. CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of hMG-IUI is related to the number of follicles greater than or equal to 12 mm, to E2, and to age. Optimal PRs from hMG-IUI require mild ovarian hyperstimulation.\r"

Significantly fewer (43%) internal medicine residents reported receiving training in either 35 cm or 60 cm LGIE than family practice residents (77%). When asked if they would suggest LGIE to screen an asymptomatic patient, 67% of family practice and 84% of internal medicine residents replied affirmatively. Those residents who had received training were significantly more likely to suggest screening LGIE. The screening decision was not influenced by the specialty of the physician who supervised the resident training. Out-of-pocket cost to the patient was expected to be a major consideration in the screening decision, but this was not supported statistically. Greater availability of residency training in LGIE will likely increase its use in screening.\r"

Lactase synthesis and processing was studied in 0- and 15-day-old rats after IP administration of [35S]methionine, and changes in precociously cortisone-induced sucrase-isomaltase were used as an internal control. Mucosal lactase and sucrase-isomaltase were separately immunoprecipitated and analyzed by autoradiography after electrophoresis. In both 0- and 15-day-old rats, mucosal lactase appeared as a 200K lactase precursor band at 30 minutes and as 200K and 225K lactase precursor bands at 60 minutes and was cleaved to form a 130K lactase band 120-240 minutes after labeling; sucrase-isomaltase similarly appeared as 210K and 220K bands at 30-60 minutes and was cleaved to form 140K I and 120K S subunits by 240 minutes in day 15 rats. To determine the role of luminal proteases, intestinal segments were isolated in situ and the luminal contents were flushed 30 minutes after labeling. Unflushed segments were used as controls. Only lactase precursor and sucrase-isomaltase precursor were present 240 minutes after labeling in flushed intestinal segments, but lactase precursor and sucrase-isomaltase precursor were cleaved in unflushed segments. Addition of trypsin or elastase into the lumen of flushed segments resulted in partial cleavage of lactase precursor but not of sucrase-isomaltase precursor. Luminal contents collected from the small intestine of day 15 rats 120 and 240 minutes after labeling showed 35S-labeled 130K and 80K polypeptides in lactase immunoprecipitates. It is concluded that intestinal lactase is synthesized as lactase precursor and transported to brush border membrane and cleaved by luminal proteases, and the amino end polypeptide cleaved from lactase precursor is released into the lumen.\r"

Among other functions, the gastrointestinal tract has endocrine functions, plays an important role in volume regulation of the body, and seems to be a target organ for atrial natriuretic factor. Therefore, the presence of atrial natriuretic factor was investigated in the human gut. Immunoreactive atrial natriuretic factor was found in intraoperatively obtained samples of normal human colon. Acidic extracts of human large intestine contained about 0.4 pmol/g wet wt of atrial natriuretic factor. Analysis of atrial natriuretic factor immunoreactivity by gel-filtration and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography showed that about 65% of the immunoreactivity corresponded to the atrial natriuretic factor phohormone and about 35% corresponded to the C-terminal ANF99-126. Immunohistochemistry showed atrial natriuretic factor prohormone location in enterochromaffin cells of the colon mucosa. Altogether, these findings show the presence of atrial natriuretic factor prohormone in enterochromaffin cells of the human large intestine and may suggest this organ as a site of atrial natriuretic factor synthesis in humans.\r"

The decline of alanine aminotransferase levels following interferon therapy showed independent, positive correlations with female sex (P less than 0.03) and younger age (P less than 0.05). The Knodell's fibrosis score was strongly positively correlated with age (P less than 0.0001).

For this purpose, a wide battery of FITC lectins specific to glucose, mannose, galactose, fucose, N-acetyl-neuraminic acid, N-acetyl-galactosamine and N-acetyl-glucosamine residues were incubated on liver cryostat sections or intraportally perfused under physiological conditions. All the resulting hepatic sections were examined under fluorescent microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. With the exception of N-acetyl-galactosamine- and fucose-binding lectins, all the perfused lectins specifically bound to the microvascular wall as confirmed by blocking methods using their corresponding sugars. A wide range of binding was, however, observed among the lectins, and the latter were classified into four groups according to their affinities for the different segments of the hepatic microvasculature: (a) equal affinity for all segments (concanavalin A); (b) different affinities depending on acinar zone (wheat germ agglutinin, Ricinus communis toxin, phytohemagglutinin E, Erythrina cristagalli agglutinin and Pisum sativum agglutinin); (c) preferential binding to the sinusoidal network (Lathyrus odoratus, phytohemagglutinin); and (d) lectins that fail to bind to the hepatic microvasculature (N-acetyl-galactosamine- and fucose-binding lectins). Sinusoidal segment walls in acinar zone 1 expressed a higher concentration of certain lectin-binding carbohydrate residues (N-acetyl-neuraminic acid, N-acetyl-galactosamine, galactose, mannose and glucose) than in acinar zone 3. The labeling patterns obtained through the incubation of liver sections or through in vivo perfusion with the different lectins did not always coincide. Only concanavalin A, wheat germ agglutinin and phytohemagglutinin E lectins proved to be concordant (i.e., they produced identical labeling patterns in both procedures).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The powerful immunosuppressive drug FK 506, which augments the response after partial hepatectomy in normal rats, had the same effect in T cell-deficient nude rats. The cytotoxicity of natural killer cells in treated nude rats was not significantly changed by FK 506 therapy. However, the serum of FK 506-treated nude rats increased hepatocyte proliferation when added to third-party hepatocyte cultures, suggesting that FK 506 had induced a serum growth factor in the nude rats or had suppressed an inhibitory factor. A hypothesis was advanced that FK 506 (and cyclosporine) affects hepatic growth by nonimmunological pathways.\r"

IgG antibody to hepatitis C virus was detected in 93% of acute cases and 91% of chronic cases. Of the 101 patients with IgG antibody to hepatitis C virus, 57% had IgM antibody to hepatitis C virus. None of the 20 healthy subjects or 40 patients with acute or chronic hepatitis A or hepatitis B had IgM antibody to hepatitis C virus. At the onset of clinical symptoms in acute hepatitis C, IgG antibody to hepatitis C virus was detected in 8 (57%) and IgM antibody to hepatitis C virus in 9 of 14 patients (64%). Eventually, both IgG and IgM antibody to hepatitis C virus became detectable in 13 of 14 patients with acute hepatitis C. Seven patients with antibody to hepatitis C virus resolved the acute infection within 6 mo and all seven cleared IgM antibody to hepatitis C virus, whereas two cleared IgG antibody to hepatitis C virus. Six patients had a chronic outcome of the acute infection and IgM antibody to hepatitis C virus persisted in detectable amounts for more than 6 mo in all (mean = 15.5 mo). Among 88 patients with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis with IgG antibody to hepatitis C virus, IgM antibody to hepatitis C virus was detected in 45 (51%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91293731\r", 
  ".W": "The recently introduced antibody test for hepatitis C virus infection has already proved to be valuable in many situations such as screening blood donors and diagnosing chronically infected patients, but this antibody assay has certain limitations. Hepatitis C virus itself is usually present in clinical specimens at very low titers; therefore a useful assay for the virus must have very high sensitivity. We have developed a simple, highly sensitive assay for hepatitis C virus RNA based on the polymerase chain reaction. In this test RNA extracted from hepatitis C virus-infected serum or plasma is used as the template for double polymerase chain reaction with nested primers. Sensitivity studies demonstrate that this assay is able to detect hepatitis C virus at or beyond the sensitivity level of chimpanzee infectivity. Preliminary studies in chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis showed that 16 of 36 patients positive for antibody to hepatitis C virus and 2 of 4 patients negative for antibody to hepatitis C virus were positive in the polymerase chain reaction test. By retesting the polymerase chain reaction-negative patients with several sets of polymerase chain reaction primers, we found hepatitis C virus RNA in 35 of the 40 patients including all 4 seronegative patients. Normal human plasma and plasma from patients with hepatitis B infection did not react in this test. This assay has proved to be valuable for determining the presence of hepatitis C virus RNA in various samples. Furthermore, it offers the possibility of diagnosis of hepatitis C virus infection in patients who do not react in the presently available antibody tests.\r"

The limit of detection is 5 mg/l of free light chain, with an assay range of 5-120 mg/l, intrabatch precisions from 1.5-6.4%, and interbatch precisions from 6.5-8.9%. The assay was only slightly less sensitive than colloidal gold staining of cellulose acetate electrophoreses for the detection of Bence-Jones protein in urine. For the serial monitoring of response to chemotherapy in patients with myeloma, the assay correlated well with serum paraprotein estimates obtained by densitometric scanning of Ponceau stained cellulose acetate electrophoreses, but not with serum beta-2 microglobulin measurements, even after correction for the effects of creatinine. These assays may prove to be of use for the monitoring of tumour response in the treatment of Bence-Jones myeloma.\r"

The TSH was towards the upper end of the normal range. Subsequently pituitary function tests showed subnormal production of luteinising hormone in response to luteinising hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) and a short synacthen test with a low 30 minute cortisol value. Long synacthen testing showed a normal response at four days, confirming that the abnormalities were due to a pituitary or hypothalamic cause.

Patients received treatment for a mean of 7.9 weeks (range 4-20). Fourteen were treated with de-methyl-chlortetracycline (600 mg/day), and 1 also received chloramphenicol (1 g/day); 1 was treated with ampicillin (2 g/day), and 4 were treated with amoxicillin (1.5 g/day). In all patients, the clinical response was rapid and excellent, body weight increased significantly, diarrhea subsided, and fecal fat values returned to normal. Intestinal biopsies obtained after treatment was completed showed significant improvement based on a decrease in the number of macrophages staining positive with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), normalization of villous structure, and decreased dilatation of lymphatic channels; free bacilli were absent, as shown both by light and electron microscopy. Seventeen patients have been followed for a mean of 99.4 months (range 6-300). Two died 30 and 72 months after diagnosis of Whipple's disease, 1 of laryngeal carcinoma and the other of colonic carcinoma. Fifteen patients are in excellent health. Three patients treated with tetracycline have had clinical and/or histologic relapses. In our experience, short-course antibiotic treatment with tetracycline or ampicillin and derivatives can be effective in WD, with few relapses and excellent outcome. No neurologic symptoms, either initially or during follow-up were observed.\r"

Preliminary results from this study indicate that a kinetic perturbation is induced in tumor cells by nutritional manipulation. Lipid-based feeding seems to produce effects similar to those of chemical or physical anticancer agents, thus suggesting a possible supporting role of nutritional manipulation in cancer treatment strategy.\r"

Patients were selected from a group of 315 cases of biopsy-proved amyloidosis in which bone marrow aspiration and biopsy had been done. There was no detectable monoclonal immunoglobulin in the serum or in the urine in 28 patients. Of 13 patients with immunoglobulin-derived amyloidosis, a clonal excess of plasma cells in the bone marrow could be detected in 11 (sensitivity, 85%), even though no immunoglobulin could be found circulating in the serum or urine after immunofixation with two light chain antisera of different sources. The 15 remaining patients had other forms of amyloidosis; 14 had polyclonal populations of plasma cells in the bone marrow (specificity, 93%). The positive predictive value of clonal excess was 92% and its negative predictive value was 88%. We conclude that, in the subset of patients with amyloidosis who do not have a circulating M component in the serum or urine detection of a clonal excess of plasma cells is useful in characterizing the type of amyloidosis. Correct classification is important for appropriate assessment of prognosis and therapy for the group of patients.\r"

Urinary sodium excretion (EH, + 370% vs. C, + 120%; P less than 0.001) and urine volume (EH, + 137% vs. C, + 62%; P less than 0.01) increased significantly more in EH than in controls after ANP injection. Glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, and plasma concentrations of angiotensin II, aldosterone and arginine vasopressin remained almost unchanged after ANP injection, whereas the filtration fraction increased to the same extent in both groups. Both proximal (EH, - 15% vs. C, - 5%; P less than 0.01) and distal fractional reabsorption (EH, - 12% vs. C, - 5%; P less than 0.01) of sodium decreased more markedly after ANP in EH than in controls. The increase in plasma cGMP and urinary excretion of cGMP was the same in the two groups. Mean blood pressure decreased and heart rate increased to the same extent in both groups. It is concluded that the increase in urinary sodium excretion and urine volume induced by ANP bolus injection is exaggerated in EH due to a more pronounced reduction in the reabsorption of sodium and water in both the proximal and the distal tubule.\r"

  ".U": "91294762\r", 
  ".W": "During a 10-year period 39 patients with acromegaly, aged 23-73 years, underwent selective adenomectomy via a trans-sphenoidal or transfrontal (one case) approach. Six to 12 months after the operation, the serum level of growth hormone (GH) was reduced to less than 5 micrograms l-1 in 28 patients (74%) in at least two of three random samples and/or suppressed to less than 3 micrograms l-1 during an oral glucose load, thus fulfilling the commonly used criteria for a successful operation. In 10 patients these criteria for adequate GH reduction were not fulfilled, but their median S-GH level was reduced from 38 to 11 micrograms l-1 (P less than 0.01) after the operation. Surgery was successful in 11 of 13 (85%) patients with a microadenoma (less than 10 mm in diameter), in 10 of 14 (71%) patients with an adenoma of diameter greater than 10 mm but still enclosed in the sella, and in seven of 11 (64%) patients with locally invasive tumours. Impaired pituitary function was observed in 23% of the patients after surgery, independent of tumour size. In one patient the postoperative period was complicated by a lethal intracranial infection. During follow-up for 1-10 years, four patients relapsed, after 1, 1.5, 6 and 9 years, respectively. Patients for whom surgery appeared to have been ineffective at the evaluation 6-12 months postoperatively, or who later relapsed were identified by early (within 7 d) postoperative serum GH with a sensitivity of 90%. The accuracy for identification of a satisfactory outcome of surgery was 85%, and the predictive value was 90%. The corresponding values for the GH response to TRH measured 6-12 months postoperatively were 47, 40 and 54%, respectively. It is concluded that the basal level of serum GH measured 1-7 d postoperatively has higher sensitivity and specificity than the GH response to TRH 6-12 months postoperatively for evaluation of the effect of surgery on GH overproduction, and that it has a higher predictive power with regard to the long-term outcome of surgery for acromegaly.\r"

The higher F-Tyr accumulation in tumors (mean 27% above contralateral tissue) was associated with two-fold transport rates into tumors, while the rate constants describing irreversible incorporation were decreased. The increased F-Tyr transport was not correlated to 68Ga-EDTA accumulation and cannot be explained by disruption of the blood-brain barrier. Kinetic analysis of 2-(18F)-fluoro-deoxy-glucose accumulation in the same patients demonstrated that increased metabolic rates in tumors are mainly caused by altered phosphorylation rates while transport of glucose is less affected. Since F-Tyr transport rates clearly separated tumors from normal tissue and since F-Tyr accumulation was related to tumor grade, PET studies of F-Tyr uptake are of clinical value for diagnosis and classification of brain tumors.\r"

In rhesus monkeys, we have been able to increase this ratio by taking advantage of the lag time between 18F-DOPA injection and the formation of its main metabolite, the amino acid 18F-fluoromethoxydopa, the entrance of which into brain is responsible for most of the brain's nonspecific radioactivity. By infusing an unlabeled amino acid, L-phenylalanine, starting 15 min after 18F-DOPA administration, we preferentially blocked the accumulation of 18F-fluoromethoxydopa by preventing its entrance into brain through competition at the large neutral amino acid transport system of the blood-brain barrier. This method appears as reliable as the original and more sensitive, as demonstrated by the comparison of normal and MPTP-treated animals under both conditions.\r"

Total daily doses were 8 mg/kg of cefixime and 40 mg/kg of amoxicillin. One hundred twenty-six patients were randomly assigned to receive treatment; 64 cultures grew pathogens. Pathogens were eradicated from the middle ear after 3 to 5 days of therapy in 27 (79.4%) of 34 children given amoxicillin and 26 (86.7%) of 30 children given cefixime (p = 0.47). When Streptococcus pneumoniae cases were analyzed, bacteriologic cure occurred in 14 (93.3%) of 15 children given amoxicillin and 12 (75%) of 16 given cefixime (p = 0.333). When cases of Haemophilus influenzae infection were analyzed, significantly more cures occurred with cefixime (10/10, 100%) than amoxicillin (8/13, 62%) (p = 0.046). Pathogens associated with failure of amoxicillin therapy were H. influenzae (five cases, two beta-lactamase-positive), S. pneumoniae (one case), and Moraxella catarrhalis (one case, beta-lactamase-positive). The four failures with cefixime therapy were all in patients infected with S. pneumoniae. Rates of rash, diarrhea, and vomiting were the same in both groups and did not necessitate stopping therapy. We conclude the following: (1) Cefixime and amoxicillin were equivalent in overall clinical and bacteriologic efficacy for otitis media. (2) Cefixime was more efficacious than amoxicillin in treating H. influenzae otitis media and should be preferred when H. influenzae is the suspected etiologic agent. (3) Side effects of both drugs were mild and equivalent.\r"

  ".W": "In this retrospective study the management of infants who had undergone resection of more than 50% of the small bowel as newborn infants between 1970 and 1988 was analyzed to define prognostic factors. Small bowel resections were performed for atresia (36 cases), volvulus (22 cases), gastroschisis (10 cases), necrotizing enterocolitis (11 cases), and other disorders (8 cases). Patients were classified into two groups depending on the length of residual small bowel: group 1 (n = 35) had less than 40 cm of small bowel and group 2 (n = 51) had 40 to 80 cm of residual small bowel. Patients in group 2 had significantly better survival rates than those in group 1 (92.0% vs 66.6%; p less than 0.001). The patients in group 1 who were born after 1980, when home parenteral nutrition was introduced, had better survival rates than those who were treated before 1980 (95.0% vs 65.0%; p less than 0.01). The time required for acquisition of intestinal adaptation depended on the intestinal length (average, 27.3 months for group 1 and 14 months for group 2; p less than 0.01) and on the presence or absence of the ileocecal valve. Parenteral or supportive enteral nutrition, or both, ensured normal growth in both groups. We conclude that more than 90% of infants now survive after extensive small bowel resection with parenteral nutrition and that the remaining small intestine will adapt with time. Home-based parenteral nutrition allowed children to be treated in the best psychosocial environment.\r"

Colonic biopsy specimens demonstrated edema and mixed hypercellularity of the lamina propria, with prominent eosinophilia. Rectal bleeding ceased if formula feedings were decreased or withheld. Of multiple medications administered, sulfasalazine seemed to improve rectal bleeding most effectively in our patients and allowed for more rapid reintroduction of enteral feedings.\r"

  ".U": "91294980\r", 
  ".W": "One hundred forty-four newborn infants with pulmonary interstitial emphysema were stratified by weight and severity of illness, and randomly assigned to receive treatment with high-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) or rapid-rate conventional mechanical ventilation (CV) with short inspiratory time. If criteria for treatment failure were met, crossover to the alternate ventilatory mode was permitted. Overall, 45 (61%) of 74 infants met treatment success criteria with HFJV compared with 26 (37%) of 70 treated with CV (p less than 0.01). Eighty-four percent of patients who crossed over from CV to HFJV initially responded to the new treatment, and 45% ultimately met success criteria on HFJV. In contrast, only 9% of those who crossed over from HFJV to CV responded well to CV (p less than 0.01), and the same 9% ultimately met success criteria (p less than 0.05). Therapy with HFJV resulted in improved ventilation at lower peak and mean airway pressures, as well as more rapid radiographic improvement of pulmonary interstitial emphysema, in comparison with rapid-rate CV. Survival by original assignment was identical. When survival resulting from rescue by the alternate therapy in crossover patients was excluded, the survival rate was 64.9% for HFJV, compared with 47.1% for CV (p less than 0.05). The incidence of chronic lung disease, intraventricular hemorrhage, patent ductus arteriosus, airway obstruction, and new air leak was similar in both groups. We conclude that HFJV, as used in this study, is safe and is more effective than rapid-rate CV in the treatment of newborn infants with pulmonary interstitial emphysema.\r"

  ".W": "The systemic and pulmonary vascular effects of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) were investigated in 12 newborn lambs during normoxia and during alveolar hypoxia (10% oxygen, 5% carbon dioxide, and 85% nitrogen). Lambs had catheters in the descending aorta, main pulmonary artery, and were studied after a 3-day recovery. We infused ATP or an equal volume of saline solution (control) into the right atrial line in doses ranging from 0.01 to 2.5 mumol/kg per minute. In normoxic lambs, ATP caused a significant decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance in doses of 0.08 to 2.5 mumol/kg per minute, and in systemic vascular resistance in doses of 0.3 to 2.5 mumol/kg per minute. Infusion of ATP in hypoxic lambs caused decreases in pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance in all the doses tested. Systemic vascular resistance decreased, and cardiac output and heart rate increased in doses greater than 0.3 mumol/kg per minute in hypoxic lambs during ATP infusion. The effects of ATP in hypoxic lambs were not blocked by propranolol, indomethacin, or theophylline. Plasma ATP levels in left atrial blood samples did not change significantly during the infusion of ATP. We conclude that ATP is a vasodilator in lambs, and its effects are specific for pulmonary circulation at doses of less than or equal to 0.15 mumol/kg per minute. The vasodilator effects of ATP appear to be independent of P1 purinergic and beta-adrenergic mechanisms, and of prostacyclin synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "We assessed the toxicity and efficacy of high-dose chemotherapy consolidation with reinfusion of purged autologous bone marrow in women with metastatic breast cancer responding to a dose-intense outpatient regimen. Thirty women with hormone-unresponsive metastatic breast cancer, previously untreated with adjuvant doxorubicin or with any chemotherapy for metastatic disease, were treated with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, doxorubicin, fluorouracil, vincristine, and leucovorin for 16 weeks. Twenty-four patients responded to therapy; 8 showed a complete response, and 16 showed a partial response. These patients proceeded to the next phase of the protocol, ie, marrow harvest and treatment with 6000 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide and 800 mg/m2 thiotepa given over 4 days. Harvested marrow was purged with 100 micrograms/mL 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide, and all patients engrafted satisfactorily. The predominant side effects were myelosuppressive and gastrointestinal, and there were no deaths from toxic effects. Three of the 16 patients who showed a partial response after the outpatient phase of treatment achieved a complete response after high-dose therapy. The partial response seen in two more patients converted to a complete response at all sites except bone. The median time to disease progression for all patients in this study was 13 months, and the median survival was 22 months. Four of the original 30 patients remained without disease progression a median of 27 months from entry into the study. This study indicates that this dose-intense regimen can be safely administered, even with the use of purged marrow, with an acceptable toxicity profile. This approach results in a high response rate in women with metastatic breast cancer and could form the basis for a regimen to be tested in the high-risk adjuvant setting.\r"

These abnormalities may be due, at least in part, to decreased Na,K-ATPase activity in various segments of the nephron during obstruction. The reason for this decreased activity has, however, remained speculative. The present study examines the potential mechanisms underlying the decreased Na,K-ATPase activity in obstruction. The Na,K-ATPase activity was markedly reduced in basolateral membrane vesicles prepared from the cortex of the obstructed kidney of rats with unilateral ureteric obstruction of 24 hours duration when compared to basolateral membrane vesicles from contralateral kidneys of the same rats or to basolateral membrane vesicles from kidneys of sham operated animals. However, no such difference was present three days post-release of unilateral ureteric obstruction. When basolateral membrane vesicles were incubated with sodium dodecyl sulphate to permeabilize the vesicles, no difference in the proportion of enzyme latency was detected between the basolateral membrane vesicles from obstructed kidneys and those from sham operated rats. Immunoblotting with antibodies to the alpha subunit of Na,K-ATPase revealed equal amounts of enzyme in the basolateral membrane vesicles from contralateral kidneys, obstructed kidneys and sham operated rats. When incubated with liposomes under conditions conducive to fusion and lipid exchange the activity of Na,K-ATPase in basolateral membrane vesicles from obstructed kidneys was reconstituted almost to normal levels. This increase in enzyme activity did not occur in basolateral membranes from contralateral kidneys or in membranes from kidneys of sham operated rats incubated in the same manner.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The diagnosis of haemophilia A and the identification of carriers has greatly improved with knowledge of the structure of the gene for factor VIII. This has permitted the defect to be tracked in families by the study of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), irrespective of the nature of the molecular defect. However, this approach is time-consuming and the information yielded falls away as more polymorphisms are added. Within the factor VIII gene lies another source of polymorphism, a dinucleotide repeat sequence of varying length known as (CA)n. Conventional mapping localised this (CA)n repeat to intron 13. The polymerase chain reaction, used to examine (CA)n variability in genomic DNA from 25 males and 67 females, revealed eight allelic bands between n = 16 and n = 24. 91% of females were heterozygous for this repeat, and family studies showed X-linked mendelian inheritance with allelic frequencies ranging from 1% to 45%. The intron 13 (CA)n repeat is tightly linked with established RFLPs and tracks with haemophilia A in family studies. The analysis requires DNA from other family members, and relatives of sporadic cases of haemophilia A are only amenable to exclusion. Nonetheless, this intron 13 (CA)n repeat provides the most highly informative marker so far available for factor VIII gene tracking studies in haemophilia A kindreds and a result can be available within a day.\r"

Here we demonstrate a case of extreme dental dimorphism, and presumed body-size dimorphism, in a Miocene hominoid sample in which these limitations have been overcome. Lufengpithecus lufengensis from the late Miocene site of Lufeng, China, was more dimorphic than the most dimorphic living hominoid, the orangutan, and may have been more dimorphic than any living anthropoid.\r"

  ".W": "The L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel is an important link in excitation-contraction coupling of muscle cells (reviewed in refs 2 and 3). The channel has two functional characteristics: calcium permeation and receptor sites for calcium antagonists. In skeletal muscle the channel is a complex of five subunits, alpha 1, alpha 2, beta, gamma and delta. Complementary DNAs to these subunits have been cloned and their amino-acid sequences deduced. The skeletal muscle alpha 1 subunit cDNA expressed in L cells manifests as specific calcium-ion permeation, as well as sensitivity to the three classes of organic calcium-channel blockers. We report here that coexpression of the alpha 1 subunit with other subunits results in significant changes in dihydropyridine binding and gating properties. The available number of drug receptor sites increases 10-fold with an alpha 1 beta combination, whereas the affinity of the dihydropyridine binding site remains unchanged. Also, the presence of the beta subunit accelerates activation and inactivation kinetics of the calcium-channel current.\r"

  ".W": "The AP-1 family of transcription factors, which includes the proto-oncogene products c-Jun and c-Fos, controls the stimulation of cellular genes by growth factors and the expression of oncogenes, including src and ras. Transcriptional activation by c-Jun is regulated by a cell-type-specific inhibitor that represses the activity of a transcriptional activation domain (A1) of c-Jun by operating through the adjacent negative regulatory region (delta). Here we show that cotransfection of the src or ras oncogene enhances the transcriptional activity of a GAL4:c-Jun hybrid that includes the delta-A1 region of c-Jun, suggesting that the DNA binding and dimerization domain of c-Jun is not required for stimulation by Src or Ras. Moreover, induction of c-Jun activity by Src and Ras occurs in cell lines containing the c-Jun inhibitor but not in a cell line lacking it. The region in c-Jun essential for the stimulatory action of these oncogenes maps to domain A1. These findings suggest the existence of signal-transduction pathways that result in an increase in transcriptional activity of c-Jun and AP-1 by disrupting the c-Jun:inhibitor interaction.\r"

After clipping the aneurysm and removing the clot, three cisternal drainage catheters were inserted into both sylvian cisterns and the prepontine cistern, and continuous ventricular drainage was performed routinely. Postoperatively, tPA (0.5 mg/2.5 ml) was infused as a bolus into both basal cisterns and the lateral ventricle twice daily for about 6 days. Angiography and cerebral blood flow studies using single photon emission computed tomography were performed on Day 4 or 5 and between Days 7 and 10 after onset of the hemorrhage. To date, there have been no cases that have shown angiographic vasospasm or delayed ischemic neurological deficits. This preliminary study indicates that the intrathecal bolus injection of tPA produces a marked effect on vasospasm.\r"

A patient with a basilar impression accompanied by a Chiari malformation and von Recklinghausen's disease who underwent transoral decompression is reported. Preoperative cine-mode magnetic resonance imaging visualized an associated obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid pulsatile flow at the level of the foramen magnum. Tonsilar herniation (Chiari I malformation) and hydrocephalus were also present. Postoperatively, the obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid flow was resolved concomitant with the correction of the cervicomedullary angulation. On the basis of observations made by magnetic resonance imaging, the surgical treatment of basilar impression accompanied by Chiari malformation is briefly discussed.\r"

Dilution in normal saline, in vitro aging, and contact with glass caused a great proportion of these patients' red cells to develop multiple spiny or rounded projections. Under identical conditions, such shape changes did not occur in normal patients or in those with Huntington's disease. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the age-induced increase in acanthocytic-appearing cells could be reversed with chlorpromazine. These data suggest that the red cells from these patients with striatal degeneration are deficient in their ability to preserve normal shape in the face of echinocytic stress and that this observation has diagnostic and, possibly, pathophysiologic significance.\r"

We induced acute severe T-cytopenia with OKT3. Fifteen patients completed treatment for 10 days. Side effects were common and severe and included hypotension, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and myalgia. In two of two patients tested, there was a transient though major rise in the levels of interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor in the first 12 hours of treatment. Nonetheless, we did not detect new clinical or MRI activity of MS during the period of treatment, although many patients deteriorated transiently in disability scores. At the conclusion of follow-up, only four patients had deteriorated by 1.0 or more points on the Expanded Disability Status Scale of Kurtzke (EDSS) (73% stabilization rate). Of those patients who deteriorated, two died of complications of MS (EDSS 10). Only two patients had clinical improvement at 1 year follow-up. The attendant toxicity of OKT3 makes it unlikely that it will play a major role in the treatment of MS.\r"

The actual dipole locations were measured from skull radiographs, and we based MEG localization on a spherical head model with the inclusion of volume currents. MEG estimates of the sources were within several centimeters (mean, 1.69 cm) of the measured locations. We conclude that MEG localization was promising.\r"

To investigate this, we retrospectively analyzed serum samples from nine chronic progressive MS patients who were treated with monthly intravenous infusions of the interferon inducer polyinosinic acid polycytidylic acid polylysine in carboxymethylcellulose (poly ICLC). Using a bioassay we found that the mean peak total interferon level was 177 U/ml 12 hours after infusion, and using a radioimmunoassay we found that the mean peak gamma-IFN level was 15.9 U/ml 12 hours after infusion, so that gamma-IFN made up approximately 10% of the total. Greater gamma-IFN induction did not correlate with clinical worsening; induced gamma-IFN levels were not higher in two patients who worsened on treatment, and the highest levels were found in a patient who remained stable. Either chronic progressive MS is not sensitive to gamma-IFN or the effects of gamma-IFN are masked by other mediators induced by poly ICLC.\r"

Little is known about the immunobiology of myoblast transplantation. Transplantation rejection is mediated to a large extent by CD8+ T cells, which recognize alloantigens encoded by class I HLA genes, and by CD4+ T cells, which recognize alloantigens encoded by class II HLA genes. Gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) is a potent inducer of HLA class II molecules as well as beta 2-microglobulin, which is co-expressed with HLA class I. IFN-gamma may be a critical cytokine involved in graft rejection. We purified human myoblasts by flow cytometry and incubated them in vitro for varying time periods with recombinant human IFN-gamma. The inducibility of HLA-DR and -DP molecules raises a note of caution concerning possible rejection phenomenon which might occur following myoblast transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "Problems arising from controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for intrauterine insemination, such as premature luteinization and asynchronous ovarian follicular development, are identical to those encountered with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for in vitro fertilization (IVF) and gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT). It has been suggested that the adjunctive use of GnRH agonists for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation improves the efficiency of GIFT and IVF cycles. We hypothesized that adjunctive use of leuprolide acetate, a GnRH agonist, would have a similarly beneficial effect on cycle quality and cycle fecundity in subfertile women treated with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and intrauterine insemination. We randomly assigned the first cycle of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and intrauterine insemination for each of 97 subfertile women to include either human menopausal gonadotropins (hMGs) alone or hMGs following midluteal pre-treatment with leuprolide. If a pregnancy did not occur in the first cycle, the woman was given the other treatment in the second cycle. Although the cycles that included leuprolide required a larger amount of hMGs and more days of stimulation per cycle, the mean estradiol concentrations and numbers of follicles were not different. Despite prevention of premature luteinization with leuprolide, the cycle fecundity was not different between groups (0.11 with adjunctive leuprolide treatment and 0.22 with hMGs alone). We conclude that in unselected subfertile patients, the adjunctive use of leuprolide for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and intrauterine insemination does not improve cycle fecundity compared with treatment cycles that do not include adjunctive leuprolide therapy.\r"

  ".U": "91296450\r", 
  ".W": "A total of 137 children with acute otitis media with effusion were randomly allocated to treatment with cefprozil (30 mg/kg/day divided into two equal doses), an investigational cephalosporin or amoxicillin clavulanate potassium (40 mg/kg/day divided into three equal doses) for 10 days. The most common pathogens obtained from middle ear cavities by tympanocentesis were Streptococcus pneumoniae (33%), Haemophilus influenzae (19.6%) and Moraxella catarrhalis (8.3%). Patients were scheduled for follow-up visits at midtreatment, at end of therapy and at 30 days. Of the 137 children 122 were evaluable. Five of 60 patients (8.3%) treated with cefprozil and 14 of 62 patients (22.5%) treated with amoxicillin clavulanate potassium were considered therapeutic failures because of persistence of symptoms and/or isolation of the original pathogen or superinfection (P = 0.05). Rates of relapse, reinfection and persistent middle ear effusion as documented by tympanogram were comparable in both groups. When persistent middle ear effusion was analyzed by pneumatic otoscopy, 64 of 103 affected ears (62.1%) treated with cefprozil and 80 of 105 affected ears (76.1%) treated with amoxicillin clavulanate potassium were abnormal (P = 0.04). Loose stools were more common in children treated with amoxicillin clavulanate potassium than in children treated with cefprozil (P = 0.0004). Based on the efficacy results from this study, the lower gastrointestinal side effects and the convenience of twice-a-day dosing, we believe that cefprozil in a dosage of 30 mg/kg/day divided every 12 hours represents a potential alternative for the treatment of acute otitis media with effusion in children.\r"

Peak serum concentrations were adjusted to 8 to 10 micrograms/ml; thus a larger total daily dosage was administered to patients receiving tobramycin every 6 hours. The shorter dosing interval was associated with better pulmonary function at follow-up and significantly longer time before next hospital admission for a pulmonary exacerbation. During the study hospitalization there were no differences in pulmonary function tests, clinical score, sputum carriage of P. aeruginosa, toxicity or necessary length of hospitalization. A 6-hour tobramycin dosing interval was more efficacious than an 8-hour dosing interval in the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients.\r"

  ".W": "The polymerase chain reaction (PCR), from primers corresponding to conserved sequences within the catalytic domains of the protein-tyrosine phosphatases, was used to amplify protein-tyrosine phosphatase-related cDNAs from a HeLa cell library. After probing the same cDNA library with one of the PCR products, 10 positive clones were identified. The longest of these clones (3984 base pairs) contained 2739 base pairs of open reading frame and, after a stop codon, a 3' nontranslated segment of 1222 base pairs. A 4.3-kilobase transcript was detected by Northern blot analysis of HeLa cell poly(A)+ RNA. The open reading frame predicts a protein of 913 amino acids (approximately 104 kDa), termed PTPH1. The sequence of PTPH1 can be described in terms of three segments. (i) The N-terminal segment displays homology to the domains in the cytoskeletal-associated proteins band 4.1, ezrin, and talin that direct their association with proteins at the interface between the plasma membrane and the cytoskeleton in structures such as focal adhesions. (ii) There is a central segment bearing putative phosphorylation sites for protein-serine/threonine kinases. (iii) A segment that is homologous to the members of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase family is located at the C terminus. The structure is discussed in the light of the potential role of PTPH1 in controlling cytoskeletal integrity and the possibility that overexpression of PTPH1 may reverse transformation induced by oncogenic protein-tyrosine kinases, such as the members of the src family.\r"

We now report that heparin at low concentrations also stimulates the autophosphorylation of the EGF receptor and of the recombinant 56-kDa domain of the EGF receptor that lacks the EGF binding site. To study the stimulations of phosphorylation of threonine residues, a fusion protein was prepared with glutathione S-transferase (GST) and an EGF receptor fragment, TK8 (residues 647-688), that contains the threonine phosphorylation site but no tyrosine. We show that the phosphorylation of threonine residues in GST-TK8 by extracts of A431 cells is stimulated by heparin but not by EGF. These and other results suggest that heparin acts as a chaperone, a substrate modulator, that enhances the susceptibility of the substrate to phosphorylation by protein kinases.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effects of isoproterenol and carbachol on fluid-phase endocytosis by Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with beta-adrenergic, M1, or M3 cholinergic receptors. Isoproterenol increased cAMP production and carbachol increased intracellular Ca, indicating successful expression of the receptor genes and coupling to typical signal transduction pathways. Carbachol inhibited the uptake of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or Lucifer yellow (markers of fluid-phase endocytosis) in both M1- and M3-containing cells but not in wild-type cells, whereas isoproterenol did not affect pinocytosis in cells transfected with beta-adrenergic receptors. Carbachol inhibited the transit of HRP from an exchangeable pool to a nonexchangeable pool by a latent process requiring minimally 5 min of incubation. During the latent period, only one peak of low-density HRP-containing vesicles was found on Percoll gradients; after 5 min, HRP appeared in both high- and low-density vesicles. Carbachol-treated cells contained less HRP in the high-density fraction enriched in lysosomal markers. Early endosomes from CHO cells labeled for 5 min with HRP underwent fusion to make a more dense population of vesicles in the presence of ATP and KCl at 37 degrees C but not at 4 degrees C. The fused material contained increased levels of G proteins as detected either by ADP ribosylation with appropriate toxins or by immunoblotting with specific antibodies. These findings suggest that GTP binding proteins are internalized in endocytic vesicles and enter into a complex trafficking process involving fusion with other vesicular compartments. Trafficking of endosomes to these compartments is inhibited by activated M1 and M3 muscarinic receptors in CHO cells.\r"

  ".W": "Many virally encoded proteinases cleave themselves out of a polyprotein, with cleavage occurring usually at their own N terminus. This property was used to develop an in vivo screening system using the lacZ gene fragment of M13mp18. When a fusion protein of the alpha fragment of beta-galactosidase and an active 2A proteinase of human rhinovirus 2 was expressed, alpha complementation was not affected, as the 2A proteinase cleaved itself off the alpha fragment. However, fusion of an inactive 2A prevented alpha complementation, as the 2A polypeptide remained fused to the alpha fragment. After random mutation of the 2A gene by PCR amplification, mutants were screened; M13 phage defective in alpha complementation were obtained at an efficiency of 5% and were shown to contain mutated 2A genes. Intermolecular cleavage was then examined by expressing an alpha fragment-inactive proteinase fusion protein as substrate for an active 2A proteinase expressed from an M13 vector. alpha complementation indicated intermolecular processing of the 2A cleavage site on the alpha fragment-inactive proteinase fusion protein. This versatile system thus allows the high-density screening of both active and inactive proteinase mutants, cleaving either intramolecularly or intermolecularly, and should be applicable to other proteinases of high specificity.\r"

Recombinant 48-amino acid peptide (48X) derived from expression of base pairs 611-761 of the DNA sequence completely inhibited anti-F1-160 binding to nerve. Recombinant peptides expressed from DNA lacking this region did not inhibit anti-F1-160 binding to nerve. Three peptides were synthesized to encompass the 48X peptide, a 12-amino acid peptide and two 18-amino acid peptides. The 12-amino acid peptide TPQRKTTEDRPQ (12X), corresponding to bases 615-651, completely inhibited the binding of anti-F1-160 antibodies to nerve at a concentration of 80 ng/ml (30 microM). The two 18-residue peptides did not inhibit, even at 10 micrograms/ml. Thus, the epitope of F1-160 crossreactive with nervous tissue can be mapped to a 12-amino acid peptide. Some humans with T. cruzi infection make antibodies to F1-160 and to the 48X and 12X peptides. Control sera from uninfected persons did not react with these antigens. Anti-48X antibodies, immunoselected from human serum with 48X peptide, bind to human nerve axons. This demonstrates that some individuals infected with T. cruzi make antibodies to the F1-160 epitope crossreactive with nervous tissues.\r"

The cleavage reaction provided a sensitive assay with which to screen extracts prepared from recombination/repair-deficient mutants. Cells with mutations in ruvC lack the nuclease activity that cleaves synthetic Holliday junctions in vitro. This deficiency was restored by a multicopy plasmid carrying a ruvC+ gene that overexpressed junction-resolving activity. The UV sensitivity and deficiency in recombinational repair of DNA exhibited by ruv mutants lead us to suggest that RuvC resolves Holliday junctions in vivo.\r"

The mechanism of the cis-acting Tnp and the relevance of inhibition to cis action have been addressed in the current study. A specific colony morphology assay for transposition of Tn5 was shown to be sensitive to Inh produced in trans and was used to screen for mutants in Inh and/or Tnp with altered regulation. A dominant mutant in IS50R that promotes transposition in trans was isolated and characterized. The mutant (449F) carries a Leu----Phe mutation at position 449 in Tnp. This mutation reduces the frequency of Tn5 or IS50R transposition in cis but allows Tnp-449F to act as efficiently in trans as it does in cis. Tnp-449F is sensitive to inhibition and, furthermore, Inh-449F is a competent inhibitor in trans. These results show that Tnp-449F is a trans-acting transposase, unlike wild-type Tnp, which is cis-acting.\r"

To gain further insight into the mechanism of this induction, we prepared somatic cell hybrids between different human cell lines and a murine cell line, RAG, that does not express murine class II MHC antigens before or after treatment with murine IFN-gamma. Some of the resulting cell hybrids express murine class II MHC antigens when treated with murine IFN-gamma. This inducible phenotype is correlated with the presence of human chromosome 16. It has been shown previously that the induction of class I MHC antigens by human IFN-gamma in human-rodent hybrids requires the presence of species-specific factors encoded by chromosome 6, which bears the gene for the human IFN-gamma receptor, and chromosome 21, whose product(s) is necessary for the transduction of human IFN-gamma signals. In this report, we show that the induction of murine class II MHC antigens by human IFN-gamma in the human-RAG cell hybrids requires, likewise, the presence of human chromosomes 6 and 21, in addition to chromosome 16. In some of these hybrids, when all three of these human chromosomes were present, induction of cell-surface HLA-DR antigens was also observed. Our results demonstrate that human chromosome 16 encodes a non-species-specific factor involved in the induction of class II MHC antigens by IFN-gamma.\r"

The enzyme crystallizes in the space group C2 with unit cell dimensions a = 258.5, b = 153.2, and c = 51.9 A and beta = 97.7 degrees. The asymmetric unit is composed of three monomers related by noncrystallographic threefold symmetry. A total of 295 of 304 amino acid residues have been built into the monomer. The last 9 residues in the C terminus were not included in the final model. Each monomer consists of 34% alpha-helix and 18% beta-strand. Three solvent-exposed loop regions (residues 69-84, 178-191, and 212-229) are not well defined in terms of electron density. The catalytic trimer of ATCase from B. subtilis shows great similarity to the catalytic trimer in Escherichia coli ATCase, which was used in constructing the model for molecular replacement. The unliganded trimer from B. subtilis, which is not cooperative, resembles the T (inactive) state slightly more than the R (active)-state form of the E. coli trimer. However, certain regions in the B. subtilis trimer exhibit shifts toward the E. coli R-state conformation.\r"

All three members of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) subfamily (RAR alpha, RAR beta, and RAR gamma) can repress transcriptional induction of the human collagenase gene or a heterologous promoter that contains the collagenase promoter AP-1-binding site. In contrast, the retinoid X receptor fails to repress Jun/AP-1 activity, demonstrating a significant difference between the two regulatory systems through which retinoids exert their transcriptional control. Analysis of RAR alpha mutants in transfection studies reveals that the DNA-binding domain is important for the inhibition of Jun/AP-1 activity, even though the RAR does not bind the collagenase AP-1 site. Rather, gel-retardation assays reveal that bacterially expressed full-length RAR alpha inhibits binding of Jun protein to target DNA. These data suggest that the RAR alpha may form a nonproductive complex with c-Jun and provides a simple mechanisms by which retinoic acid may limit cell growth and possibly malignant progression.\r"

  ".W": "Several results suggest that P elements have recently invaded natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster after a horizontal transfer from another species. The donor species is thought to come from the willistoni group, which contains P elements very homologous to those of D. melanogaster. However, more divergent P elements are present in many other Drosophilidae species. We have analyzed such elements from Scaptomyza pallida, a species phylogenetically distant to D. melanogaster. We report here the isolation of two coding P elements from S. pallida (PS2 and PS18) that are 4% divergent from one another. At least one of these elements (PS18) is active since it is able to transpose in D. melanogaster and to mobilize a D. melanogaster defective P element, even though its nucleotide sequence is 24% divergent from the canonical P element of D. melanogaster. To our knowledge, a P element that is active and strongly divergent from the D. melanogaster P element has not been reported previously. Sequence comparison between the complete P elements of D. melanogaster and S. pallida reveals that the structural characteristics are maintained: PS2 and PS18 contain terminal inverted repeats and internal repeats very similar to those of the D. melanogaster P element. In addition, the noncoding regions cis necessary for the transposition are more conserved than the coding sequences. Two domains found in the D. melanogaster P transposase (helix-turn-helix and leucine zipper) are well conserved in the putative proteins encoded by PS2 and PS18. This study provides insights into which parts of P elements are functionally important and correlates with functional studies of the P element in D. melanogaster.\r"

Synapsin I is a principal target of intracellular protein kinases and is thought to be involved in the release of neurotransmitter from axon terminals. We present several lines of evidence which indicate that rat brain synapsin, in addition to this role, may function as a DG kinase. Purified rat brain DG kinase was digested with trypsin, which produced three major fragments whose sequence was identical to three regions in synapsin I. Using a rabbit anti-synapsin polyclonal antiserum, the elution profile of synapsin immunoreactivity coincided exactly with that of DG kinase activity in column fractions from the final step in the DG kinase purification procedure. As is the case with synapsin, the purified enzyme was a strongly basic protein with an isoelectric point greater than 10.0. Finally, incubating the DG kinase with highly purified bacterial collagenase, an enzyme that partially degrades the proline- and glycine-rich synapsin, resulted in the simultaneous loss of DG kinase activity and synapsin immunoreactivity. We conclude that cytosolic rat brain synapsin is capable of functioning as a DG kinase.\r"

It has been shown to bind reversibly to membranes, though its cDNA-predicted sequence contains no obvious membrane-binding domains. However, smg p25A does contain a cDNA-predicted C-terminal Cys-Ala-Cys sequence at positions 218 through 220, which suggests that it may be posttranslationally modified. In the present study we used two different approaches to investigate this possibility. First, we incubated pheochromocytoma cells with [3H]mevalonolactone, examined the proteins that became labeled by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and demonstrated that two of these proteins exactly corresponded to smg p25A. Second, we purified smg p25A from bovine brain membranes and analyzed both the full-length protein and a proteolytically derived C-terminal peptide by a combination of high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. This approach revealed that the protein's C-terminal region is methyl-esterified and contains two geranylgeranyl groups linked via thioether bonds to Cys-218 and Cys-220. Since smg p25A is one of several small GTP-binding proteins that share a C-terminal Cys-Xaa-Cys consensus sequence (where Xaa is an unspecified amino acid), our results suggest that these proteins may be similarly geranylgeranylated and methyl-esterified.\r"

  ".U": "91296788\r", 
  ".W": "Three separate processes may contribute to rapid beta-adrenergic receptor desensitization: functional uncoupling from the stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding protein Gs, mediated by phosphorylation of the receptors by two distinct kinases, the specific beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK) and the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), as well as a spatial uncoupling via sequestration of the receptors away from the cell surface. To evaluate the relative importance and potential role of the various processes in different physiological situations, a kinetic analysis of these three mechanisms was performed in permeabilized A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells. To allow a separate analysis of each mechanism, inhibitors of the various desensitization mechanisms were used: heparin to inhibit beta ARK, the PKA inhibitor peptide PKI to inhibit PKA, and concanavalin A treatment to prevent sequestration. Isoproterenol-induced phosphorylation of beta 2 receptors in these cells by beta ARK occurred with a t1/2 of less than 20 sec, whereas phosphorylation by PKA had a t1/2 of about 2 min. Similarly, beta ARK-mediated desensitization of the receptors proceeded with a t1/2 of less than 15 sec, and PKA-mediated desensitization with a t1/2 of about 3.5 min. Maximal desensitization mediated by the two kinases corresponded to a reduction of the signal-transduction capacity of the receptor/adenylyl cyclase system by about 60% in the case of beta ARK and by about 40% in the case of PKA. Receptor sequestration was much slower (t1/2 of about 10 min) and involved no more than 30% of the cell surface receptors. It is concluded that beta ARK-mediated phosphorylation is the most rapid and quantitatively most important factor contributing to the rapid desensitization. This rapidity of the beta ARK-mediated mechanism makes it particularly well suited to regulate beta-adrenergic receptor function in rapidly changing environments such as the synaptic cleft.\r"

Now we report an identical spectrum of activities of FK506, CsA, rapamycin, and 506BD on IgE receptor-mediated signal transduction that results in exocytosis of secretory granules from the rat basophilic leukemia cell line RBL-2H3, a mast cell model. Both FK506 and CsA inhibit receptor-mediated exocytosis (CsA IC50 = 200 nM; FK506 IC50 = 2 nM) without affecting early receptor-associated events (hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol, synthesis and release of eicosanoids, uptake of Ca2+). In contrast, rapamycin and 506BD, which share common structural elements with FK506, by themselves have no effect on IgE receptor-mediated exocytosis. Both compounds, however, prevent inhibition by FK506 but not by CsA. Affinity chromatography with FK506, CsA, and rapamycin matrices indicates that the same set of immunophilins present in RBL-2H3 cells have been found in Jurkat T cells and calf thymus; however, the relative amounts of these proteins differ in the two cell types. These results suggest the existence of a common step in cytoplasmic signaling in T cells and mast cells that may be part of a general signaling mechanism.\r"

Additionally, in vitro prenylation analysis demonstrated farnesyl modification of H-ras but geranylgeranyl modification of five rab proteins (1a, 1b, 2, 3a, and 6). Together, these results suggest that the carboxyl-terminal CC/CXC motifs (X = any amino acid) specifically signal for addition of geranylgeranyl, but not farnesyl, groups. A rab1b mutant protein lacking the two carboxyl-terminal cysteine residues was not prenylated in vitro. However, since a mutant H-ras protein that terminates with tandem cysteine residues was also not modified, the CC motif may be essential, but not sufficient, to signal prenylation of rab1b. Finally, rab1b and rab3a proteins were not efficient substrates for either farnesyl- or geranylgeranyltransferase activities that modify CAAX-containing proteins (A = any aliphatic amino acid). Therefore, rab proteins may be modified by a prenyltransferase(s) distinct from the prenyltransferases that modify carboxyl-terminal CAAX proteins.\r"

  ".W": "Small GTP-binding proteins of the rab family have been implicated as playing important roles in controlling membrane traffic on the biosynthetic and endocytic pathways. We demonstrate that a distinct rab protein, rab4p, is associated with the population of early endosomes involved in transferrin-receptor recycling. An antibody to human rab4p was found to detect a doublet of approximately 24-kDa proteins on immunoblots from various cell types. Seventy-five percent of these proteins were tightly membrane bound and could be released only by detergent treatment. Upon isolation of early endosomes, late endosomes, and lysosomes, by free-flow electrophoresis and Percoll density-gradient centrifugation, most (70%) of the rab4p was found to cofractionate with early endosomes and endocytic vesicles containing 125I-labeled transferrin. The rab proteins previously localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and/or Golgi apparatus were not found in these fractions. We also localized rab4p to transferrin-receptor-containing early endosomes by immunofluorescence after expression of rab4 cDNA. The association of rab4p with early endosomes and other vesicles involved in the intracellular transport of transferrin receptor suggests that rab4p may play a role in regulating the pathway of receptor recycling.\r"

  ".W": "von Willebrand disease Normandy (vWD Normandy) is a recently described phenotype in which a mutant von Willebrand factor (vWF) appears structurally and functionally normal except that it does not bind to blood coagulation factor VIII. This interaction is required for normal survival of factor VIII in the circulation; consequently, vWD Normandy can present as apparent hemophilia A but with autosomal recessive rather than X chromosome-linked inheritance. A vWF missense mutation, Thr28----Met, was identified in the propositus in or near the factor VIII binding site. The corresponding mutant recombinant vWF(T28M) formed normal multimers and had normal ristocetin cofactor activity. However, vWF(T28M) exhibited the same defect in factor VIII binding as natural vWF Normandy, confirming that this mutation causes the vWD Normandy phenotype. The distinction between hemophilia A and vWD Normandy is clinically important and should be considered in families affected by apparent mild hemophilia A that fail to show strict X chromosome-linked inheritance and, particularly, in potential female carriers with low factor VIII levels attributed to extreme lyonization.\r"

Plasma and urine samples were collected for 10 and 24 h, respectively, and assayed for ddI by high-performance liquid chromatographic methods. The mean maximum concentrations of drug in plasma at the end of 15-min infusions for the 20-, 50-, and 100-mg/kg doses were 33.3, 90.0, and 202 micrograms/ml, respectively. Area under the concentration-time curve data deviated significantly from linearity. The mean total clearance for the low dose (250 ml/min) was significantly greater than that for the high dose (190 ml/min). Renal clearance, which averaged between 98 and 116 ml/min, was dose independent. Renal clearance implied that nonrenal clearance decreased at the high dose (92 ml/min) when compared with that of the low dose (134 ml/min). The average urinary recovery of ddI for the high dose (51.2% of dose) was significantly greater than that for the low dose (45.8%). The volume of distribution at steady state averaged between 7.6 and 10.5 liters and decreased with increasing dose; however, it was not statistically significant. The mean half-life and mean residence time were invariant with respect to dose and averaged between 0.94 and 1.07 h and 0.61 and 0.71 h, respectively. In this dose range, ddI pharmacokinetics are dose dependent.\r"

MUG324 was significantly more resistant to nalidixic acid (greater than 64 micrograms/ml). The MICs of other antimicrobial agents known to interact with either the gyrA or gyrB gene products were determined. Although the nalidixic acid MIC for MUG116 increased, no significant increases in the MICs of other agents that interact with the gyrA gene product were seen. The MICs of all agents that interact with the gyrA gene product were significantly increased for MUG324. The gene that imparts low-level nalidixic acid resistance was cloned from strain MUG116. The DNA sequence of this gene was determined, and by comparing the deduced amino acid sequence with sequences of proteins in data bases, this protein was found to be approximately 70% homologous with the gyrB gene product of Escherichia coli.\r"

Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Citrobacter freundii, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited with MIC90s of less than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml. Serratia marcescens was less susceptible to Ro 09-1428, with a MIC90 of 25 micrograms/ml. The most distinctive feature of Ro 09-1428 was its potent activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, with MIC90s of 0.39 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Most of the ceftazidime-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, and C. freundii were inhibited by Ro 09-1428, while those of S. marcescens were resistant at a concentration of 12.5 micrograms/ml. Ro 09-1428 was more active than ceftazidime against staphylococci. PBP 3 was the most sensitive target in E. coli and P. aeruginosa. The response to ferric iron in growth medium suggests that Ro 09-1428 may be taken up by transport mechanisms similar to those of other catechol cephalosporins. In accordance with its in vitro activity, Ro 09-1428 activity was equal to or greater than ceftazidime activity in efficacy against experimental septicemias in mice. The results indicate that Ro 09-1428 is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with advantages over ceftazidime in its activity against P. aeruginosa, staphylococci, and ceftazidime-resistant strains of C. freundii and E. cloacae.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this study was to determine whether hyperoxia enhances aminoglycoside activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The existence of tobramycin-oxygen synergy was determined by using the in vitro postantibiotic effect (PAE). P. aeruginosa strains were incubated for 1 h in medium containing tobramycin at four times the MIC in the following gas mixtures: normoxia (21% O2), hyperoxia (100% O2, 101.3 kPa), or hyperbaric oxygen (100% O2, 274.5 kPa). Tobramycin was removed after 1 h and bacteria were incubated under normoxic conditions; growth rates were measured for 5 h. Exposure of three P. aeruginosa strains to hyperoxia prolonged the PAE of tobramycin approximately twofold compared with the PAE after exposure to normoxia (P less than 0.05). Exposure of P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 to tobramycin and hyperbaric oxygen prolonged the time required for bacteria to increase 1 log10 CFU/ml compared with the time after exposure for this increase to occur in tobramycin-treated, normoxic or hyperoxic groups (P less than 0.02). Pulse-chase labeling of bacteria with L-[35S]methionine, immediately after removal of tobramycin, showed that protein synthesis rates were decreased compared with those in controls (P = 0.0001). Moreover, in tobramycin-treated groups, hyperoxia and hyperbaric oxygen induced 2- and 16-fold decreases, respectively, in protein synthesis rates compared with normoxia; these results did not achieve statistical significance. In the absence of tobramycin, hyperoxia increased bacterial growth (134%; P less than 0.01) and protein synthesis (24%; not significant) compared with normoxia. Hyperbaric oxygen, however, delayed the growth recovery of bacteria (P less than 0.05). We conclude that hyperoxia enhances the bacteriostatic effects of tobramycin in a synergistic manner.+\r"

Students from four classes (1985, 1986, 1987, and 1988) were studied in 1985 and 1986. The faculty were family physicians, internists, and pediatricians who provided 20% of the undergraduate medical education for the last 30 months of a four-year curriculum. The study's goal was to develop estimates of the primary care teaching physicians' productivity, to compare them with the productivity of physicians not involved in teaching, and to provide estimates of revenue shortfalls that occurred for the physicians who were teaching. The estimated productivity of the teaching physicians, working 29 hours a week in ambulatory-care settings, was lower by 30-40% when they were teaching medical students than the productivity of nonteaching physicians regionally and nationally. The average patient-care revenue loss for a full-time-equivalent faculty member per full-time-equivalent student for 1985 was estimated to be $27,531 (regional comparison) or $21,143 (national comparison). The corresponding figures for 1986 were $24,294 and $21,525, respectively. The study's results should be useful to those who are planning to establish ambulatory-care delivery systems and also to directors of existing ambulatory-care delivery systems who may be contemplating accepting medical students.\r"

We have also observed blunting of cardiopulmonary and arterial baroreflex function in SHR-S compared to WKY. In the current study, ANP stores in 12 brain nuclei thought to participate in the pathogenesis of hypertension, including locus coeruleus (LC), A1/C1 area (A1/C1), nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS), medial preoptic nucleus (MPON), suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), supraoptic nucleus (SON), anterior hypothalamic area (AHA), paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN), ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMN), dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMN), lateral hypothalamic nucleus (LN), and posterior hypothalamic area (PHA), were compared in 10-week-old male SHR-S and WKY rats following 3 weeks of 1% v 8% NaCl feeding. Individual brain nuclei were obtained by the micropunch technique and ANP content of bilateral brain nuclei from individual rats was measured by radioimmunoassay. ANP content was significantly decreased in NTS and LC and elevated in AHA of SHR-S compared to WKY rats on either diet. Dietary NaCl supplementation was associated with increased ANP content in PVN of both strains. These alterations in ANP content in SHR-S may be related to the reduced release of norepinephrine from nerve terminals in AHA and to the presumed central defect in baroreceptor function.\r"

The diets were consumed for 3 days before each study day. After 3 days of LK diet, blood pressure was slightly higher than under the other conditions. Serum potassium on LK was significantly lower than on HK (3.8 +/- 0.1 v 4.3 +/- 0.2). The ANH infusion did not cause any changes in blood pressure or urinary sodium and potassium excretion. Urine volume increased with ANH infusion under all diet conditions. Plasma renin activity and plasma angiotensin II levels were significantly lower on LK than on LS or HK, probably reflecting sodium retention. Increase in plasma ANH levels of about 75% (well within normal range) suppressed all hormonal parameters on LS and HK diets, but had no significant effect on LK diet. The pattern of aldosterone changes closely followed the changes in the renin-angiotensin system. We conclude that under various physiologic conditions ANH suppresses aldosterone predominantly through suppression of renin.\r"

We conclude that acute atriopeptidase inhibition by UK 79300 effectively increases endogenous ANP levels up to 2.5-fold. However, these changes were not accompanied by significant effects on left ventricular hydraulic load.\r"

  ".W": "It has been shown that only a small fraction of CD4+ T cells are infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in vivo, particularly early in the course of infection. An even smaller proportion of cells have been shown to be expressing virus. Recent studies suggest that plasma viremia in asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals, representing active viral replication, is more common than was previously believed (range 23-100% of patients). To determine the in vivo state of HIV expression, samples of peripheral blood of 49 HIV-infected individuals at all stages of disease were examined. All subjects were positive for viral DNA by standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and a modified PCR was utilized to detect HIV-specific mRNAs (gag, major splice junction, env, and tat/rev). Patient's plasma was also assayed for p24 antigen and viremia. The results were as follows: (formula: see text) Overall, the findings suggest that active viral expression occurs at all stages of HIV infection. In particular, the presence of gag mRNA was determined in only 2 of 14 patients with T4% greater than 30% but in 20 of 35 patients with T4% less than or equal to 30% (p less than 0.05), demonstrating a direct association between the presence of message for a structural protein, and more advanced immunosuppression. Determination of the expression of certain HIV-specific messages from within a patient's cells adds a new dimension to understanding the pathogenesis of HIV infection. The presence of HIV-specific mRNAs, and in particular gag message, in many healthy seropositives may further argue for early initiation of antiviral therapy.\r"

Increased levels of IFN-alpha and TNF-alpha were found in some, but not all, cases with PHI. During progressing disease IFN-alpha occurred in serum with increasing frequency and concentration. Raised levels of TNF-alpha were found in all stages of chronic infection, but were less common in patients with AIDS than were raised levels of IFN-alpha. The levels of the two substances were not correlated. There was a correlation between IFN-alpha, but not TNF-alpha, and the occurrence of HIV-1 p24 antigen in serum. These results suggest that IFN-alpha and TNF-alpha are induced by different agents during HIV-1 infection. The findings would be consistent with the hypothesis that IFN-alpha and TNF-alpha are counteracting forces that have important down- and upregulatory effects, respectively, on HIV-1 replication in vivo.\r"

Results indicated that: (1) sIL-2R levels were significantly increased in most HIV-1 seropositive patients. This increase appeared to be correlated with low CD4 cell counts and with the presence of detectable levels of p25 antigen. Furthermore, initially high levels of sIL-2R appeared to be correlated with progression of disease. (2) IL-2 levels were found to be increased in about 43% of asymptomatic carriers (ASY) and subjects with lymphoadenopathy-associated syndrome (LAS) compared with 12% in the case of AIDS-related complex (ARC) and AIDS patients. (3) There was a positive correlation between serum levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1 alpha in nearly all patients. Detectable levels of both cytokines were found in 34% of ASY and LAS patients and only rarely were detectable in ARC and AIDS patients. (4) Sixteen patients in whom progression of disease was observed were studied initially and at the moment they upstaged. No significant modification of serum levels of the three cytokines and sIL-2R studied could be evidenced. It was concluded that sIL-2R could be a useful marker of disease activity and progression, though a prospective study is necessary. For IL-2, IL-1 alpha, and TNF-alpha, this study indicated the presence of variable alterations in serum levels in HIV-1-infected patients.\r"

The data indicate that most of the lens care regimens tested, when coupled with meticulous rubbing, were capable of safely decontaminating the contact lenses, that is, they reduce the amount of infectious HIV-1 on the lenses by greater than a 10 log concentration (10(-10], relative to standard controls. Most tested lens care regimens, if properly followed, would virtually eliminate any chance of the lens serving as a vector for HIV.\r"

These assays measured the titer of infectious virions and the amounts of HIV-1 core antigen p24 in soluble, intraviral, and intracellular forms. CRDS treatments were performed for 1 h at 37 degrees C. H9 cells pretreated with 0.1 to 100.0 micrograms/ml of CRDS appreciably inhibited HIV-1 infection. CRDS-treated HIV-1 virions were less able to infect H9 cells than untreated virions. The simultaneous treatment of H9 cells and HIV-1 virions with CRDS induced a significant inhibition of HIV-1 infection, resulting in the temporary disappearance of virions at the highest dose of CRDS. In contrast, CRDS treatment of newly HIV-1-infected H9 cells caused a significant decrease in the titer of infectious HIV-1 and the p24 amounts of all three forms, but no absolute elimination. Taken together, these results indicate that CRDS may block the binding of the HIV-1 envelope to the H9 cell surface, with emphasis on the high affinity of CRDS to the HIV-1 envelope.\r"

  ".W": "The recombinant chimeric plasminogen activator, rt-PA-delta FE/scu-PA-e, consisting of amino acids 1 to 3 and 87 to 274 of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and amino acids 138 to 411 of single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (scu-PA), has a markedly increased thrombolytic potency following its continuous intravenous infusion in animal models of venous thrombosis (Collen et al, Circulation, in press). In the present study, the thrombolytic potencies of intravenous bolus injections of rt-PA-delta FE/scu-PA-e, of recombinant t-PA (rt-PA), and of recombinant scu-PA (rscu-PA), given alone or in combination, were compared with those of intravenous infusions in a hamster pulmonary embolism model. Dose-dependent clot lysis was obtained in the absence of systemic activation of the fibrinolytic system and fibrinogen breakdown. In bolus injection experiments, the maximal rate of clot lysis, expressed in percent clot lysis per milligrams per kilogram compound administered, was 120 +/- 10 for rt-PA, 54 +/- 8 for rscu-PA, and 2,100 +/- 500 for rt-PA-delta FE/scu-PA-e (P less than .01 v rt-PA or rscu-PA). Comparative results with continuous infusion over 1 hour were 270 +/- 64, 99 +/- 18, and 1,500 +/- 250 (P less than .01 v rt-PA or rscu-PA) percent lysis per mg/kg compound infused for rt-PA, rscu-PA, and rt-PA-delta FE/scu-PA-e, respectively. Thus, rt-PA and rscu-PA are more potent when administered as an infusion than as a bolus, whereas rt-PA-delta FE/scu-PA-e is at least as potent when administered as a bolus. Combined bolus injections of rt-PA and rscu-PA had a 2.2-fold synergistic effect on clot lysis, but no synergism was observed with combined bolus injections or with combined infusions of rt-PA and rt-PA-delta FE/scu-PA-e, or of rscu-PA and rt-PA-delta FE/scu-PA-e. The present study thus shows that rt-PA-delta FE/scu-PA-e is much more potent for clot lysis than rt-PA or rscu-PA when administered as a bolus injection, but no synergistic interaction is observed between the chimera and either rt-PA or rscu-PA.\r"

  ".W": "The present studies have examined the regulation of the jun-B early response gene by cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent signaling pathways. The 2.0-kb jun-B transcript was at low but detectable levels in uninduced human HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells. In contrast, treatment with 1 mmol/L8-bromo-adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br-cAMP) in the presence of isobutylmethylxanthine, an inhibitor of cAMP-dependent phosphodiesterase, was associated with increases in jun-B transcripts that were maximal by 1 hour and then decreased to near pretreatment levels by 6 hours. Similar findings were obtained with 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-CPT-cAMP) and N6,2'-0-dibutyryladenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (dBt-cAMP). jun-B transcripts were also increased with other agents that increase intracellular cAMP levels, such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and forskolin. Moreover, inhibition of cAMP-dependent protein kinase by the isoquinolinesulfonamide H-8 blocked 8-Br-cAMP-induced increases in jun-B expression. The results of nuclear run-on assays demonstrate that treatment of HL-60 cells with PGE2, forskolin, 8-Br-cAMP, and dBt-cAMP is associated with increases in the rate of jun-B transcription. The present findings also demonstrate that the related jun-D gene is similarly regulated by a cAMP-dependent pathway. Taken together, these findings suggest that stimulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase is involved in the induction of jun gene expression in myeloid leukemia cells.\r"

During the period 1987 to 1989, seropositivity rates were as follows: untransfused hemophiliacs 0% (0 of 11 cases), hemophiliacs treated exclusively with vapor-heated factor VIII or IX concentrates 0% (0 of 9 cases), hemophiliacs treated only with cryoprecipitate or single donor blood products 0% (0 of 9 cases), and hemophiliacs regularly treated with unheated or dry heat-treated factor VIII or IX concentrates 95% (21 of 22 cases). Corresponding alanine aminotransferase (ALT) results were similar: values were always below the upper limit of laboratory normal (40 U/L) in untransfused hemophiliacs, hemophiliacs treated with vapor-heated factor concentrates, or those who received only cryoprecipitate or single donor blood products. By contrast ALT values were greater than 40 U/L in 82% (18 of 22 cases) of hemophilic children regularly infused with unheated or dry heat-treated factor concentrates. Three conclusions are drawn from this data: (1) HCV is a major cause of chronic hepatitis in multitransfused hemophilic children, (2) unheated and dry heat-treated clotting factor concentrates carry a very high risk of transmitting HCV infection, and (3) clotting factor concentrates inactivated by vapor heating carry a very low and perhaps zero risk of transmitting HCV infection. These findings are of therapeutic significance for previously untransfused hemophiliacs susceptible to HCV infection.\r"

  ".W": "Exposure of human peripheral blood to 100 ng/mL of bacterial endotoxin for 2 hours resulted in a 20-fold increase in monocyte procoagulant activity. The activity was functionally identified as tissue factor, because it was not expressed in plasma deficient in factor VII and was specifically inhibited by a monoclonal antibody directed against human tissue factor. When the stable prostacyclin analog, iloprost, was added to blood 30 minutes before endotoxin, a dose-dependent inhibition of monocyte procoagulant activity occurred, with an I50 of 20 nmol/L. Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) produced similar effects, with an I50 of 150 nmol/L. Exposure of THP-1 monocytic cells to 100 ng/mL endotoxin resulted in a threefold increase in procoagulant activity after 2 hours and a 20-fold increase after 6 hours. A 30-minute pretreatment with iloprost or PGE1 again inhibited development of procoagulant activity, with I50 values of 5 nmol/L and 150 nmol/L, respectively. Treatment of THP-1 cells with iloprost 2 hours after exposure to endotoxin significantly inhibited further increases in procoagulant activity. Iloprost was less potent under these conditions, 30% inhibition being obtained at 100 nmol/L and 70% at 1 mumol/L. These results suggest that prostacyclin may be a physiologic modulator of monocyte tissue factor expression; in addition, its stable analog, iloprost, may have clinical potential for the treatment of thrombotic disorders in which elevated monocyte procoagulant activity plays a role.\r"

In this study, anti-PAI-1 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) were used to identify interaction sites of PAI-1 with these components. The binding sites of 18 different MoAbs were established and are located on five distinct \"linear\" areas of PAI-1. MoAbs, binding to two distinct areas of PAI-1, are able to prevent the inhibition of t-PA by PAI-1. In addition, two interaction sites for fibrin were identified on PAI-1. The area located between amino acids 110 and 145 of PAI-1 contains a binding site for both components and its significance is discussed in the context of the t-PA inhibition by fibrin-bound PAI-1. Subsequently, the MoAbs were used to assess the role of platelet-PAI-1 in clot-lysis. An in vitro clot-lysis system was used to demonstrate that clot-lysis resistance is dependent on the presence of activated platelets and that PAI-1 is a major determinant for lysis-resistance. We propose that, upon activation of platelets, PAI-1 is fixed within the clot by binding to fibrin and retains its full capacity to inhibit t-PA and u-PA.\r"

To obtain quantitative information on the in vivo activation and inactivation of the protein C system during the acute phase of endothelial damage, several components of the protein C pathway were studied in 28 MSF patients. Upon admission (day 1), patients showed clear evidence of endothelial damage as reflected by the significant decrease in the ratio VIII:C/vWF:Ag (0.36 +/- 0.14, mean +/- SD) compared with normals (0.98 +/- 0.14), and clinical and laboratory signs of hemostatic alterations such as decreased platelet count, positive fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products, and increased thrombin:antithrombin-III complex levels. Antigenic protein C (72% +/- 18%) and protein C inhibitor (PCI) (41% +/- 20%) were significantly decreased (P less than .001). Complexes of activated protein C (APC) with PCI or with alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1AT) and of plasma kallikrein with PCI (KK:PCI) were measured using sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. APC:alpha 1AT complex levels were increased in patients at day 1 (27 +/- 13 ng/mL) compared with controls (7 +/- 2 ng/mL), and APC:PCI and KK:PCI complexes, which were not detectable in any of the controls, were present in 57% and 75% of the 28 MSF patients, with mean levels of 11 +/- 5 and 46 +/- 16 ng/mL, respectively. After remission of the disease (day 30), a trend toward normal values in the majority of the parameters studied was found. This study shows that, in the course of endothelial injury, MSF patients experience a generalized activation of the protein C pathway, resulting in consumption of protein C and PCI, and in the appearance of APC:inhibitor complexes. Moreover, these data provide the evidence that KK:PCI circulating complexes occur in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "The goal of the present study was to assess the relative importance of receptor-bound and secreted plasminogen activator urokinase (u-PA) in generating cell-surface plasmin and fostering destruction of normal tissue by tumor cells. We first showed that active site-inhibited u-PA could displace endogenous u-PA from the surface of the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line HCT 116. We then prepared expression vectors for u-PA and for a mutant molecule in which the codon for the active site serine residue was changed to encode alanine. Expression of non-functional mutant u-PA decreased the level of cell-bound active u-PA by more than 95% via a mechanism that involved competition for receptor sites. Decreased cell-surface u-PA activity was associated with a decrease in cell-bound plasmin activity to undetectable levels, suggesting that receptor-bound u-PA plays an important role in the generation of plasmin on the cell surface. Transfectants that secreted eightfold to 20-fold elevated levels of active wild-type u-PA showed approximately 50% increases in cell-associated u-PA and only twofold to fourfold increases in cell-associated plasmin, suggesting that the role of secreted u-PA in generating cell-surface plasmin activity was relatively minor. In parent cells and both types of transfectants there was a good correlation between the amount of plasmin bound to the tumor cell surface and the extent to which a basement membrane substrate was degraded. These studies show that receptor-bound u-PA provides an efficient mechanism for plasmin generation on the surface of tumor cells, which, in turn, contributes significantly to their degradative potential.\r"

  ".U": "91300110\r", 
  ".W": "Primitive blast colony-forming cells (BI-CFC) from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients are defective in their attachment to bone marrow-derived stromal cells compared with normal BI-CFC. We investigated the effect of recombinant interferon-alpha 2a (IFN-alpha) on this interaction between hematopoietic progenitor cells and bone marrow-derived stromal cells by culturing normal stromal cells with IFN-alpha (50 to 5,000 U/mL). At 50 U/mL we found that: (1) the capacity of stromal cells to bind two types of CML primitive progenitor cells (BI-CFC and long-term culture-initiating cells) was increased; and (2) the amount of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the stromal layer was increased. However, sulfated GAGs were not directly involved in binding CML BI-CFC, unlike binding by normal BI-CFC, which is sulfated GAG-dependent. Neuraminidase-treated control stromal cells bound an increased number of CML BI-CFC, reproducing the effect of IFN-alpha, whereas the binding to IFN-alpha-treated stromal cells was unaffected by neuraminidase treatment. Thus, the enhanced attachment by primitive CML progenitor cells to INF-alpha-treated stromal cells might be due to changes in the neuraminic acid composition in the stromal cell layer. Our in vitro evidence may provide insights into the mechanism of action of IFN-alpha in vivo. Prolonged administration may alter the marrow microenvironment in some patients such that it can restrain the aberrant proliferation of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive stem cells while permitting Ph-negative stem cells to function normally.\r"

The complications included pancreatitis (10), peptic ulceration (8), and pseudo-obstruction (8), in addition to colonic perforation and small bowel obstruction. When laparotomy was performed it was well tolerated. This paper supports the view that successful management of abdominal complications following transplantation requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. Where doubt exists in the presence of an acute abdomen, laparotomy is the appropriate way to establish a definitive diagnosis.\r"

  ".U": "91300411\r", 
  ".W": "Long-term results are presented of 28 patients who were diagnosed with neuroblastoma at more than 12 months of age and who received melphalan 180 mg/m2 (n = 6) or 240 mg/m2 (n = 22) to consolidate remissions of Stage IV disease or to control refractory disease. Twenty-four patients also received dianhydrogalactitol 180 to 240 mg/m2, and 11 received total body irradiation 450 to 600 cGy. Autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) was performed with marrow that was unpurged (n = 2) or purged ex vivo (n = 26) with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) 20 micrograms/ml plus ascorbate 200 micrograms/ml. The median time to an absolute neutrophil count of 500/microliters was 21 days and to self-sustaining platelet counts more than 20,000/microliters, 28 days. One patient required infusion of unpurged reserve marrow. Two groups of patients underwent ABMT: (1) 17 patients (Group I) who were in first remission a median of 7 months after diagnosis; and (2) 11 patients (Group II) who had refractory disease or were in second remission. For Group I, event-free survival was 29% at 12 months and 6% at 24 months post-ABMT. All Group II patients died of disease or ABMT-related toxicity. Overall, of the 28 patients, one is a long-term relapse-free survivor; five died of ABMT-related toxicity; ten patients with tumors present at ABMT had progressive disease within 6 months of ABMT; and 12 patients with no measurable disease at ABMT relapsed 4 to 32 months (median, 12) post-ABMT. Among the latter, six relapses involved the primary site, and six were restricted to distant sites. These results--in accord with the long-term outcome in other series--suggest that for neuroblastoma high-dose melphalan cannot be relied on to ablate residual disease or to salvage patients with refractory tumors. In addition, the pattern of relapse in several patients could be explained by infusion of incompletely purged autografts; this would support recent laboratory evidence that 6-OHDA/ascorbate is a suboptimal purging method.\r"

Seventeen of 20 patients underwent complete (14 patients) or partial (3 patients) resection. Three patients had shown evidence of metastases after EBRT by the time of surgery. The 4-year actuarial local control and disease-free survival rates of the 17 patients undergoing resection were 81% and 64%, respectively. Twelve patients received IORT at the time of resection for microscopic disease (10 patients) or gross residual sarcoma (2 patients). Of the ten patients receiving IORT for microscopic tumor, one patient has died of local failure and peritoneal sarcomatosis and two patients have died of distant metastases only. The remaining seven patients are disease-free. One patient treated for gross residual sarcoma has experienced a local failure 1 year after IORT and is without disease 7 years after salvage chemotherapy. The other patient treated for gross residual sarcoma has died of local failure. Five patients did not receive IORT at the time of resection because of the extensive size of the tumor bed. Three of these patients are disease-free with one patient alive with lung metastases and one patient dying of hepatic metastases. Aggressive radiation and surgical procedures appear to provide satisfactory resectability and local control with acceptable tolerance.\r"

Polyethylene tubes and human cholesterol stones were implanted surgically into the gallbladder of cats. Sham cholecystostomy was performed as control operation. These cats were euthanized at two, six, and 12 weeks, and the implants were removed, cultured, and studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Cultures and SEM also were undertaken for material scraped from the mucosal surface of the biliary tract from these animals. Colonization of bacteria on the polyethylene tubes and the gallstones was found six and 12 weeks after implantation. Adherent bacterial biofilms were demonstrated on the surfaces of these implants. This experiment showed that transient bacterobilia exists in the feline biliary tract. The foreign body implants have facilitated the adhesion of planktonic bacteria in the bile onto their surfaces and have initiated the formation of adherent biofilms within which these bacteria persisted until the system was sampled.\r"

Using the model of a Markov process for decision analysis, survival and costs under four possible strategies to treat gallstones were compared: expectant management with cholecystectomy (EC) or lithotripsy (EL) reserved for symptomatic gallstones; prophylactic cholecystectomy (PC) or lithotripsy (PL) for all gallstones. Life expectancy for the different strategies varies by few days. Only if high annual rates of pain and complication occurred in subjects with silent gallstones would both prophylactic procedures marginally increase life expectancy. Prophylactic cholecystectomy then would be more cost-effective than prophylactic lithotripsy. Expectant strategies remain much cheaper than prophylactic management over a broad range of probability values and procedural costs. Expectant use of lithotripsy costs less than cholecystectomy. A low success rate of lithotripsy would raise the direct costs of lithotripsy above those of cholecystectomy but leave total costs of both strategies in the same order of magnitude. Lithotripsy appears to be a feasible alternative to treat symptomatic but not asymptomatic gallstones.\r"

Duodenal bile was collected prior to beginning the diet and at four weeks. There was no correlation between deoxycholate and arachidonate among the 34 patients before beginning the diet. With placebo, deoxycholate decreased while arachidonate and glycoprotein increased. With ursodiol, deoxycholate decreased while arachidonate decreased and glycoprotein did not change. With aspirin, there was no change in deoxycholate but a decrease in arachidonate and no change in glycoprotein. Our data do not support a role for biliary deoxycholate in the regulation of biliary arachidonate.

DESIGN: Pituitary and ovarian responses to GnRH-a and the outcome of IVF were studied prospectively. Data from patients injected with hCG were analyzed retrospectively. SETTING: Program of IVF at the Rambam (Governmental) Hospital, Haifa, Israel. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: One or two doses of buserelin acetate 250 to 500 micrograms were administered to six patients with moderate response (Estradiol [E2], 1,494 +/- 422 [+/- SD] pg/mL) and 8 patients with exaggerated response (E2, 7,673 +/- 3,028 pg/mL) to gonadotropin stimulation. Progesterone (P) and E2 were administered for luteal support. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist effectively triggered luteinizing hormone (LH)/follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) surge. Mature oocytes were recovered in all patients. Luteal E2 and P were lower than in patients injected with hCG. No signs of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome were observed. RESULTS: Serum LH and FSH rose over 4 and 12 hours, respectively, and were significantly (P less than 0.05) elevated for 24 hours. Of all mature oocytes, 67% fertilized and 82% cleaved. Four pregnancies were obtained. CONCLUSIONS: A bolus of GnRH-a is able to trigger an adequate midcycle LH/FSH surge, resulting in oocyte maturation and pregnancy. Our preliminary results also suggest that it allows a more accurate control of ovarian steroid levels during the luteal phase and may prevent the clinical manifestation of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.\r"

DESIGN: Serial blood samples were obtained during 1 month from sexually active Norplant users experiencing regular menstrual bleeding patterns and a control group of noncontracepting women trying to conceive. The sequential blood samples were assayed for the presence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). SETTING: All samples were obtained from women receiving contraceptive service and health care at the Center for Research and Services in Human Reproduction and Contraception, Santo Domingo, The Dominican Republic. Assays for hCG were performed at the Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Tampere, Finland. PATIENTS, PARTICIPANTS: A total of 32 women using Norplant implants were enrolled in the treatment group, and 20 women of proven fertility who were attempting to conceive served as a control group. INTERVENTIONS: Duration of Norplant use was as follows: 4 in the 2nd year of use, 13 in the 3rd year, 11 in the 4th year, 3 in the 5th year, and 1 in the 7th year. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The determination of pregnancy was based on the presence of hCG in the luteal phase, using a sensitive and specific immunoenzymatic assay that can detect dimeric hCG as early as 7 days after ovulation. RESULTS: Nine pregnancies were detected. All were in the control group trying to conceive. Six of these advanced to clinical pregnancies, and three did not proceed beyond the next expected menses. None of the Norplant users had evidence of hCG production, whether the observed cycles were anovulatory or ovulatory. The probability of finding no pregnancies in the ovulatory months at risk among Norplant users is between 1 in 50 and 1 in 150,000. The null hypothesis that Norplant users conceive at a natural rate can be rejected at the 0.05 level. CONCLUSION: Interruption of early pregnancy (menstrual abortion) does not play a role in the mechanism of action of Norplant contraceptive implants.\r"

Only patients with at least one oocyte unfertilized were included in this study. RESULTS: Stimulation with GnRH-a/hMG, as compared with CC/hMG stimulation, resulted in larger numbers of oocytes (P less than 0.00001), a higher fertilization rate (P less than 0.02), and oocyte retrieval at a later average cycle day (P less than 0.000005). Cytogenetic findings of immaturity were observed in 33.9% of unfertilized oocytes after CC/hMG stimulation, compared with only 17.8% after GnRH-a/hMG stimulation (P less than 0.0005). Aneuploidy findings were the same for both groups. CONCLUSION: In GnRH-a/hMG stimulation, oocytes approach the normal day of ovulation more closely.

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: The response to subcutaneous (SC) gonadotropin replacement therapy, using human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) or hCG alone, was evaluated in male hypothalamic hypogonadism. DESIGN: Sixteen patients with hypothalamic hypogonadism were treated with gonadotropins for induction of puberty and normalization of spermatogenesis. The results were analyzed retrospectively. SETTING: The study was carried out in a clinical endocrinology department providing tertiary care and in private practices of endocrinology. PATIENTS: Eight patients with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and eight patients with Kallmann's syndrome in prepubertal or early pubertal stages. INTERVENTIONS: Human chorionic gonadotropin and hMG were administered SC in individual dosages. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Increase of serum testosterone (T), testicular volume, semen volume, and sperm count were evaluated. RESULTS: Normalization of serum T and complete sexual maturation was achieved in all patients. Spermatogenesis was induced in all but two patients. Seven patients showed normal findings in semen volume and sperm count, and two patients had semen quality close to normal. In five patients sperm count remained less than 10 x 10(6)/mL. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained by SC gonadotropin replacement prove this mode of administration to be effective in stimulating steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis in hypogonadotropic males.\r"

The aim of thrombolytic agents is to restore antegrade flow of blood in occluded coronary arteries. The process of reperfusion may be dysrhythmogenic because of the heterogeneous return of electrical activity in myocardial cells. This study examined the incidence and type of dysrhythmia occurrence and the associated changes in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) during infusion of tissue-type plasminogen activator (TPA). A retrospective chart review of 41 subjects showed that 80% of subjects experienced dysrhythmias during TPA therapy. The most common dysrhythmia was sinus bradycardia, followed by idioventricular/accelerated idioventricular rhythm, ventricular premature beats, and ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation. There was a significant difference between MAP changes when there were no dysrhythmias and MAP changes when dysrhythmias occurred (p less than 0.05). The largest change in MAP (-22.71 mm Hg) was observed when dysrhythmias occurred in those subjects with blockage of the left anterior descending artery, although there was no statistically significant difference in changes in MAP among the groups of different sites of blockage (p greater than 0.05).\r"
