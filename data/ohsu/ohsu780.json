  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To study the health of Royal New Zealand Navy personnel who participated in atmospheric nuclear weapons tests conducted by the United Kingdom at Malden Island and Christmas Island in 1957 and 1958. DESIGN--Blinded, controlled follow up of up to 30 years. SETTING--New Zealand. SUBJECTS--528 Men known to have participated in the tests and a control group of 1504 men who were in the Royal New Zealand Navy during the same period but did not participate in the tests. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Mortality and incidence of cancer. RESULTS--Follow up for the period 1957-87 was 94% complete in test participants and 91% complete in the controls. There were 70 deaths among test participants and 179 deaths among controls, yielding a relative risk of 1.08 (90% confidence interval 0.85 to 1.38, p = 0.29). The relative risk of death from causes other than cancer was 0.96 (0.71 to 1.29, p = 0.59) whereas the relative risk of death from cancer was 1.38 (0.90 to 2.10, p = 0.09) and of the incidence of cancer was 1.12 (0.78 to 1.60, p = 0.29). For cancers other than haematological malignancies the relative risk was 1.14 (0.69 to 1.83, p = 0.31) for mortality and 1.01 (0.67 to 1.50, p = 0.48) for incidence. There were seven deaths from haematological cancers among test participants (relative risk 3.25, 90% confidence interval 1.12 to 9.64, p = 0.02), including four leukaemias (5.58, 1.04 to 41.6, p = 0.03). The relative risk for incidence of haematological cancers was 1.94 (0.74 to 4.84, p = 0.10) and that for leukaemia was 5.51 (1.03 to 41.1, p = 0.03). There were no cases of multiple myeloma in the test participants during the follow up period, but the expected number was only 0.3. CONCLUSIONS--Although the numbers are small, the findings for leukaemia are similar to those for British participants in the nuclear weapons test programme. Some leukaemias, and possibly some other haematological cancers, may have resulted from participation in this programme. There is little evidence of an increased risk for non-haematological cancers, and there is no evidence of an increased risk for causes of death other than cancer.\r"

SETTING--Military hospital in Wiltshire. PATIENTS--116 Patients on a general surgical waiting list at Leighton Hospital near Crewe. INTERVENTIONS--Preselection for medical fitness at a waiting list review clinic. RESULTS--Roughly half of patients offered the facility of travelling 120 miles (190 km) for their routine elective operation at the health authority's expense accepted. The average waiting list time declared by the patients who travelled was 28 months, and 13 patients stated that their condition prevented them from working. Only four patients regretted their decision to participate in the scheme. Lack of visitors did not cause undue concern. CONCLUSIONS--Some patients did not agree to travel for their operation but almost all of those who did so found the scheme satisfactory. Some minor problems were encountered but these could probably be overcome by ensuring use of appropriate transport, extending the postoperative stay when necessary, and more careful selection of patients for an anaesthetic. For efficient use of theatre time in such schemes it is crucial that the operating consultant surgeon should be in charge of case selection.\r"

A retrospective review of a cohort of 1504 7 year old children living in semirural Somerset found that the development assessment by a health visitor at age 3 1/2 years had a sensitivity of 45% for identifying the 103 children with special educational needs, whereas the sensitivity of the preschool examination by a general practitioner was 56%. There was no relation between results of preschool developmental assessment and later reading ability. Of the 23 children in special schools, 22 had been identified independently of the developmental screening programme before starting school. Intervention was started at a mean age of 1 year 5 months (range 2 months to 3 years) for children with severe learning difficulties, and 3 years 9 months (2 years 3 months to 6 years 6 months) for children with moderate learning difficulties. The preschool medical examination revealed fairly minor medical problems: 29 of 81 children referred for specialist opinions were shown to be medically normal, and for only seven of the medically abnormal children was information about their conditions given to their teachers. In Somerset screening the development of all children at predetermined ages has not been very useful.\r"

  ".W": "Sixty patients with primary bone tumours were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 0.5 T with both conventional spin-echo (SE) and short inversion time inversion recovery (STIR) sequences. The results have been reviewed in order to evaluate the accuracy of STIR and conventional SE sequences in the detection of tumours, the definition of intramedullary extent and soft-tissue involvement. The intraosseous neoplastic extent has been compared with macroslides of surgical specimens in 24 cases. The role of the STIR sequence in detection of recurrences in the post-surgical follow-up was also evaluated. The STIR sequence, designed to suppress signal from fat, also enhances the signal from tissue with long T1 and T2 relaxation times, such as neoplastic and inflammatory tissue. The STIR sequence with T1 of 120-130 ms in all cases suppressed the high signal from fatty bone marrow, giving a clear depiction of tumour extent, in both its intramedullary and soft-tissue components, and is superior to conventional SE images. The high sensitivity (100% of our cases) of this technique is counterbalanced by its lack of specificity: on STIR sequences both tumour and peritumorous oedema give an increase of signal intensity, limiting assessment of tumour extent. Peritumoral oedema, only present in our series in malignant neoplasms, may however be differentiated on the basis of the configuration of the abnormal areas, and by comparing STIR images with short repetition time/echo time sequence results.\r"

The ages of the 11 men and six women ranged from 25 to 83 years. Nine patients had been treated for malignant melanoma and the others for various primary neoplasms. Intussusception on CT was characterized by thickening of the affected bowel segment in all 14 patients and by the presence of intraluminal fat density material in 13, a concentric ring or \"target\" lesion in four, and an intra-luminal soft-tissue mass in nine. Five patients had intussusception, without other evidence of disease, caused by metastases in three patients, lipoma in one and idiopathic in one. Eleven of the other 12 patients had extensive disease, and one had small bowel cytomegalovirus infection. Five of these patients had more than one site of bowel involvement. Ten of the 12 patients had progression of disease on follow-up CT examinations and six died between 26 days and 7 months after diagnosis of intussusception. Intussusception may occur as the first indication of tumour recurrence or metastasis, but is more commonly a manifestation of widespread disease. However, even in patients with malignant neoplasms, it may be idiopathic or a result of benign neoplasm.\r"

  ".U": "90268295\r", 
  ".W": "Using commonly assumed alpha/beta ratios for tumours and late-reacting tissues, the linear-quadratic (LQ) model has been used to compare low dose-rate (LDR) gynaecological treatment with high dose-rate (HDR) techniques given in small fraction numbers. Even in the absence of relatively favourable tissue recovery constants (mu values) it is shown that, provided a modest extra amount of geometrical sparing of critical tissues is available (by means of spacing or shielding), HDR treatment in a small number of fractions may be used in place of an LDR regime without loss of therapeutic ratio. This general result, although not universally true, does indicate that HDR treatment delivered in a small number of fractions may be more feasible than is sometimes thought. These findings do not contradict currently accepted radiobiological philosophy, which cautions against the use of small numbers of high-dose fractions. Primarily they serve to emphasize the importance of the recommendations of the ICRU (1985), which stress the need to consider the complete time-dose pattern of radiation delivery to all the critical tissues in an intracavitary treatment.\r"

The object of this technique was to reduce the number of local recurrences in pelvic and abdominal lymph nodes. Except in the case of two patients, it was possible to infuse both extremities. Side effects of the treatment were generally mild. In a postoperative study of the surgical specimens, metastases were found in 18 lymph nodes. All of these showed selective necrosis of existing metastases and conservation of the morphology of healthy nodes. Necrosis of the primary tumor was occasionally produced.\r"

All ten patients improved within days of the procedure as confirmed by a decrease in measurable hormone levels (gastrin, adrenocorticotropin, and 5-hydroxy indole acetic acid) or by a decrease in tumor size and improved symptoms. Three patients underwent repeated reembolization from two to four times over nine to 50-month intervals for symptom control. Complications of and indications for HAE in these patients are discussed. It appears to be an effective treatment for dealing with the hormonal syndromes and local symptoms related to the hepatic metastases of hormone-secreting tumors.\r"

Complete remissions (CR), however, are rare, and a few patients do not respond adequately to alpha-IFN. That the poor response to alpha-IFN treatment could be related to a particular immunologic surface marker profile of the HC was investigated in this study. The results showed that most patients who do not respond adequately to alpha-IFN HC have a peculiar immunologic phenotype with a positive response to the Leu1 (CD5) monoclonal antibody, usually absent on HC but characteristically expressed on B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. Of nine HCL patients with this phenotype, only three had partial remissions (PR) and six minor responses (MR) compared with the three CR, 16 PR, and three MR observed in the 22 Leu1 (CD5)-negative patients. The authors postulate that a more extensive immunologic analysis of HCL patients at diagnosis may be predictive of the response to IFN treatment.\r"

The primary mechanism presumably is the emergence of autoantibodies to various structural proteins or receptors. Two studies have recently shown that a significant percentage of patients treated with recombinant alpha-interferon (r alpha-IFN) do form autoantibodies. The authors report six additional cases of development or exacerbation of autoimmune phenomena in patients receiving alpha-IFN therapy. Five of these patients developed symmetric polyarthropathies and the sixth had thyroiditis. The presence of a history of underlying autoimmune disease or baseline serologic abnormalities in five of these patients, including the patient who developed thyroiditis, suggests that alpha-IFN treatment can lead to the exacerbation of an underlying subclinical autoimmune process.\r"

The lymphoproliferative disorder was characterized by increased peripheral blood large granular lymphocytes (LGL) with azurophilic granules (natural killer [NK] cells) which had limited antigen expression: CD2+, CD3-, CD4-, CD8-, CD16+, NKH-1-. The LGL failed to express T-cell or T-cell-related antigens, with the exception of CD2. No functional or gene rearrangement studies were performed on the patient's lymphocytes. However, the results of immunophenotyping, including CD25, W26, and HLA-DR, were suggestive of an inactive state, and the negative finding for CD3 antigen was consistent with unarranged gene T-cell receptors. This is the first reported case of TGLD in an HIV antibody-positive patient.\r"

Young men (average age, 27.6 years) with a high incidence of intravenous drug abuse (86%) were found. The status of the HIV infection at diagnosis of HD was: four patients, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS); eight patients, persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL); and ten patients, asymptomatic. The natural history of HD was unusual, with a high incidence of B symptoms (81%), advanced Stages III to IV (90%), bone marrow invasion (50%), cytopenias before treatment (45%), opportunistic infections (68%), and aggressive histologies. A decreased response to chemotherapy with poor marrow tolerance and a significant decrease in survival, 18 months, was observed. The AIDS and cytopenias pretreatment were associated with a shorter statistically significant survival, which defines the importance of immunodeficiency in HD prognosis. Complete remission after treatment was a factor that contributed to a longer statistically significant survival. The PGL or asymptomatic patients survived longer but also had a poor course, and five of them had AIDS criteria during evolution. A high incidence of HD in relation to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in patients with HIV infection in the six cooperating hospitals was found. Criteria for considering HD as an AIDS-associated lymphoproliferative disease in our environment are discussed.\r"

The DNA and karyometric measurements of Feulgen-stained nuclei were made with a video cytometry system. The five-year and ten-year adjusted survival rates were 74.4 +/- 10.1% and 59.5 +/- 15.6%, respectively. Cox's survival analysis for mortality showed that only stage, age, sex, and 5N exceeding rate had predictive value (overall P = 0.0012) in decreasing order. Patients with the best prognosis were young females with clinical Stage I disease and low 5N exceeding rate tumors. When karyometric and histometric variables were considered by themselves survival correlates with the standard deviation (SD) of the nearest nuclear distance and nuclear elongation; that is, patients with crowded, high cellularity tumors and elongated cells had the worst prognosis. In univariate analyses only clinical stage correlated with adjusted survival rate. Multivariate survival analysis for morbidity showed that patients in Stages greater than or equal to II and high SD of ploidy values were free of symptoms for short intervals. When morphometric data were considered alone, patients with high variance in the chromatin texture and highly variable nuclear areas had shorter asymptomatic intervals.\r"

The SCC-Ag was an indicator of histologic differentiation of squamous cell carcinoma but not of malignant potential. The population density of LC correlated well with the histologic stage, vessel invasion, and postoperative survival time. In patients with a marked infiltration of LC, survival time was longer than for those in whom the infiltration was slight (P less than 0.05). The density of the LC can serve an indicator of defense of the host against the carcinoma. There was no correlation between SCC-Ag and S-100 protein-positive cells.\r"

A colorimetric proliferation assay and an anchorage-dependent cell culture system were used. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), nerve growth factor (NGF), neurite-inducing factor (NIF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and a cell-free extract from selected embryonic chick eye tissues (CIPE) were assayed for their capacity to control proliferation. Basic FGF, NGF, and CIPE stimulated proliferation of IMR 32 NB cells in serum-containing culture conditions. The NIF and CNTF had no effect. The concentration of bFGF required to induce half-maximal cell growth was 4.6 +/- 1.8 ng/ml, but the half-maximally effective dose of NGF was 7.5 +/- 2.7 ng/ml. In combination these two growth factors were additive within a small concentration range. In serum-free culture conditions bFGF affected both proliferation and cell differentiation by promoting neurite growth and cell aggregate formation. In contrast, NGF induced cell neurite outgrowth only. These results, in conjunction with the evidence that bFGF-like molecules are present, in IMR 32 NB cells may support the notion that NB cells regulate their proliferation by an autocrine mechanism. Basic FGF and NGF, two distinct neurotrophic factors, appear to be involved in the regulation of NB cell proliferation.\r"

To determine what effect, if any, papillomavirus infection has on DNA ploidy values of genitourinary condylomas, DNA was measured with and without DNAse exposure in seven urethral condylomas, shown by prior in situ hybridization to contain abundant human papillomavirus types 6 and 11. Normal human skin was used as a negative control. Consecutive paraffin-embedded tissue sections were stained according to Feulgen before and after DNAse treatment. The DNA was measured by image analysis. In control tissue, DNAse obliterated DNA, and the Feulgen reaction was negative. In six of seven condylomas the DNA content was reduced, but a measurable Feulgen reaction was still present in isolated cells. In the seventh case there were no significant changes in the histograms. This observation strongly suggests that the presence of human papillomavirus has a significant effect on measurements of DNA ploidy in genital condylomas and, by implication, possibly also in other tissues containing the virus. Possible mechanisms are discussed.\r"

The clinical and histologic findings in these two groups showed many similarities. Except for a characteristic clinical presentation of patients with a primary cutaneous FCC lymphoma on the trunk, there was no single clinical or histologic criterion that reliably differentiated between both conditions in all cases. Follow-up data showed that only a small number of patients of the malignant group developed (four of 35 cases) or died of (two of 35 cases) systemic lymphoma. The favorable prognosis of this type of cutaneous lymphoma implies that lack of systemic lymphoma after a five-year follow-up cannot be used as a diagnostic criterion in retrospective studies.\r"

The outcome is unfavorable for most patients; of 11 of 12 patients with follow-up, 45% had local recurrence, 54% had distant metastasis, and 45% were dead of disease within 10 years of diagnosis (mean, 3 years). Metastases to lymph nodes were common (72%). Immunohistochemical studies on paraffin-embedded tissue revealed that most tumors reacted with antibodies known to mark adenocarcinoma: B72.3 (11 of 11) and Lewis Y (ten of ten). High and low molecular weight cytokeratins were present in most tumors (nine of ten and seven of nine cases, respectively), supporting the concept that these adenocarcinomas were of ductal origin. Parotid ducts adjacent to CSCED expressed B72.3 in six of nine cases studied, but parotid ducts from normal tissue (adjacent to benign mixed tumors or enlarged periparotid lymph nodes) rarely expressed this marker (one of 17 cases). The detection of B72.3 diffusely in parotid ducts, especially those with atypia, may imply the presence of malignant tumor nearby, which could be useful in evaluating limited tissue from the parotid. However, further studies are necessary to confirm the significance of this finding.\r"

No significant correlation between tumor ploidy and patient age was found. Patients with diploid tumors had a significantly improved relapse-free and overall survival compared with patients with aneuploid tumors (P = 0.0001). In a Cox multivariate model with parameters including ploidy, histologic grade, tumor size, and patient age, ploidy (P = 0.02) and tumor size (P = 0.05) emerged as significant independent predictors of overall survival. Only ploidy was independently significant in the analysis of relapse-free survival.

In 43.75% of the cases, severe dysplasia was minimal in amount, 43.75% intermediate, and 12.5% extensive. Severe dysplasia was spatially associated with the main tumor in only 31.25% of cases. In 43.75% of the cases all of the severe dysplasia was isolated (i.e., not adjacent or intermingled with any carcinoma). Whereas this study confirms one general association between severe dysplasia and the presence of carcinoma within the gland, the data do not strongly support the concept that the dysplasia is a direct precursor to centrally located low-grade Stage A carcinomas. From a practical viewpoint, severe dysplasia in the TUR was seen in 15.6% of cases and was not predictive of the amount of tumor within the gland.\r"

All 40 cases had severe dysplasia which varied in amount (extensive in 35% of cases; intermediate in 55%; minimal in 10%). Severe dysplasia was predominantly concentrated in peripheral and posterior regions of the gland. Those cases with extensive severe dysplasia had more multifocal small cancers (14.6/case) compared with cases with intermediate (7.5/case) or minimal severe dysplasia (5.5/case). Most dominant tumor nodules had some intermingled severe dysplasia, and in 30% of the dominant tumor nodules, intermingled severe dysplasia occupied between 10% and 25% of the tumor nodule. Severe dysplasia was located next to the dominant tumor nodule in all cases. Nineteen percent of dominant tumor nodules had extensive adjacent severe dysplasia ranging from 5 to 14 mm in maximum diameter, showing that the potential exists for needle biopsy of prostate cancers to obtain only severe dysplasia. These data show a close relationship between severe dysplasia and Stage B cancers. In contrast, centrally located low-grade multifocal cancers, as seen in Stage A (incidental) carcinoma, had a significantly weaker association with severe dysplasia as compared with central, intermediate-grade, multifocal tumors or peripheral multifocal tumors of any grade.\r"

The role of hereditary factors and associated etiologic factors in male breast cancer are reviewed. The overall prognosis of male patients with breast cancer is poor compared with female patients with breast cancer, possibly related to a delay in diagnosis and difference in regional spread of the tumor. Increased surveillance of families with a history of male breast cancer and the presence of associated etiologic factors appears advisable.\r"

Only histologic grade (P = 0.01) and kind of surgery (total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy +/- omentectomy versus unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, P = 0.02) were found to have a significant influence on survival prognosis (Cox model). All other factors (age, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] stage, integrity of the capsule, unilaterality versus bilaterality, and histology) were of no prognostic importance. Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy without any additional staging reduces five-year survival probability (62% versus 84%). Therefore this kind of operation should be abandoned. Furthermore, histologic grade should be a stratification criterion in studies, which will be necessary for proving the value of adjuvant therapy in Stage I epithelial ovarian carcinoma.\r"

Some authors have noted acroosteolysis to be acquired secondarily to the initiation of an immune complex disease that results in the vascular occlusion of the small arteries of the hand. Although the pathoetiology is unknown, the Hajdu-Cheney syndrome of idiopathic acroosteolysis is distinct from the other forms because a generalized skeletal dysplasia is the most distinct feature, and it is usually not present in early childhood. The purpose of this study is to present an unusual case of cervical instability in a girl with Hajdu-Cheney syndrome. This case not only demonstrates that cervical osteolysis and acroosteolysis can coexist and require primary surgical intervention but also that patients with these concurrent problems need to be monitored closely to identify any subsequent changes that may require secondary surgical stabilization.\r"

The percentage with significant negative ulnar variance (the distal ulnar was at least 2 mm shorter than the radius) was 6.0% in Group 1 and 55.6% in Group 2. The difference between the two groups was significant. The mean ulnar variance of normal subjects in Taiwan differed significantly from the variance in Swedes and American blacks but not American whites. In Chinese patients with Kienbock's disease, the ulnar variance was predominantly negative, and the distribution of ulnar variance was similar to that of Swedish or American white patients. This study confirmed the association between negative ulnar variance and the occurrence of Kienbock's disease.

It appears to have a worse prognosis in the predominantly nonwhite population seen with this condition in the United States than previous studies from Scandinavia would suggest. Early roentgenographic diagnosis is critical, since toddlers can have infantile tibia vara at an early stage instead of physiologic genu varum. Aggressive bracing is appropriate treatment until age three years. Correction to valgus alignment with upper tibial osteotomy predictably can produce complete resolution of the condition if performed by age four years. After that age, the procedure becomes less effective. Prognosis for Langenskiold Grade IV disease is guarded at best, regardless of age, because the physis behaves as if effective growth arrest has already occurred. Young patients with Grade IV or greater lesions should have corrective osteotomy combined with a physeal procedure to attempt restoration of growth in the medial physis. Early effective treatment can prevent permanent intraarticular incongruity.\r"

One patient with multiple deformities was only observed; the remaining eight patients were initially treated by closed reduction. Due to difficulties encountered in reduction and especially in stabilization, all hips were subsequently treated surgically, with a total of 42 procedures. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head developed in five hips, four of which had been treated with closed reduction with the patients under general anesthesia. At the follow-up evaluation, six patients had reached adulthood. Clinically, satisfactory results were obtained in 12 of 16 hips but roentgenographically in only six hips. Both femoral and innominate osteotomies are necessary to achieve and maintain the reduction in EDS patients with CDH.\r"

By correlating the degree of macroscopic and microscopic loosening at the bone-cement interface, a classification of the stages of loosening at the bone-cement interface was devised. Examination of the femoral bone-cement interface of solidly fixed prosthesis components has demonstrated the presence of polyethylene wear particles and a macrophage response at the interface prior to loosening. This suggests that wear particles may migrate along bone-cement interfaces that are both macroscopically and microscopically solid, and emphasizes the important role of wear particles in prosthesis loosening.\r"

All patients were evaluated functionally and roentgenographically. There were five Ficat Stage II and five Ficat Stage III lesions. The involvement of femoral head necrosis averaged 33%. Good results were obtained in seven patients after an average of 28 months from the surgical procedure. The Borden and Gearen modification requires calibrated guide wires inserted under an image intensifier to obtain precise rotation and rigid internal fixation of the femoral head. This procedure is technically easier to perform than the original Sugioka osteotomy and gives similar results.\r"

Ninety-three normal subjects were tested. No statistical significance was found between right and left lower limb scores (limb symmetry index) as related to sports activity level, gender, or dominant side. This allowed an overall symmetry index score to be established for the population as a whole. An 85% symmetry index score was found in more than 90% of the normal population for the one-legged hop for distance test and the one-legged timed hop test. Thirty-five patients with ACL-deficient knees were tested. The patients also had KT-1000 and Cybex testing and completed questionnaires rating symptoms, sports activity levels, and sports functional limitations. The cutting-type tests and the vertical jump test did not detect functional limitations in a reliable manner. In the one-legged hop tests, 50% of the patients performed normally, however, all reported giving-way episodes with sports, indicating a lack of sensitivity of these tests in defining functional limitations. Patients with abnormal one-legged hop test scores were considered at serious risk for giving way and limitations during sports activities. Statistically significant relationships were found among abnormal scores on the one-legged hop-type tests and (1) self-assessed difficulty with pivoting, cutting, and twisting, (2) quadriceps weakness (Cybex), and (3) patellofemoral compression pain.\r"

A special computer program based on the theory of a rigid body spring model was applied to calculate the important anatomic and biomechanical factors of the knee joint. The tibiofemoral mechanical angle was 1.2 degrees varus. Hence, it is difficult to rationalize the 3 degree varus placement of the tibial component in total knee arthroplasty suggested by some authors. The distal femoral anatomic valgus (measured from the lower one-half of the femur) was 4.2 degrees in reference to its mechanical axis. This angle became 4.9 degrees when the full-length femoral anatomic axis was used. When simulating a one-legged weight-bearing stance by shifting the upper-body gravity closer to the knee joint, 75% of the knee joint load passed through the medial tibial plateau. The knee joint-line obliquity was more varus in male subjects. The female subjects had a higher peak joint pressure and a greater patello-tibial Q angle. Age had little effect on the factors relating to axial alignment of the lower extremity and load transmission through the knee joint.\r"

Function was assessed using the d'Aubigne scale coupled with measurement of range of motion (ROM) and stability. Pain relief was substantial (75%), and functional ability improved commensurately. ROM improved from a preoperative average of 83 to a postoperative 123. Three (5.7%) arthroplasties failed and were subsequently revised, while three (6.8%) of the knees examined at review have static radiolucent lines at the tibial bone-cement interface. The remaining 44 knees examined (93.2%) showed no signs of impending failure and have sustained their functional result. The polyethylene tibial components are not metal backed, and it is of interest that bone-cement interface failure has been unusual. This operation is a somewhat exacting procedure, but with the correct choice of patient and technique, a predictable result can be expected.\r"

The mean age was 65 years (range, 32-90 years). Fifty-three percent had rheumatoid arthritis, and 47% had osteoarthritis. The mean interval from initial to revision TKA (129 knees) was four years (range, three months to 11 years) and from the first to second revision (seven knees) was 2.4 years (range, seven months to 5.5 years). The most common reasons for failure were loosening (73%), patellar complications (13%), and instability (10%). The mean follow-up time was 5.2 years (range, two to 12 years). Function, instability, motion, and pain all improved after revision TKA, but these improvements were significantly less than those seen after primary TKA. One-third of the patients still ambulated with crutches, a walker, or not at all. While mean postoperative flexion was 100 degrees, 24% could not flex to 90 degrees. Most patients (90%) were malaligned at the time of failure and remained so after revision (78%). The increased incidence of radiolucent lines (tibial, 61%; femoral, 24%) was not related to increased failure. Complications were not increased over primary TKA. The failure rate was 5.8% at 5.2 years, or approximately 1% per year. A successful clinical result was defined as a knee with mild or no pain, mild or no instability, and flexion to at least 90 degrees.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At the late evaluation, there were satisfactory results in 60% of the patients with patellofemoral arthritis and/or lateralization. The rather extensive consolidation time and the long period of revalidation are disadvantages as are the difficulties with kneeling and hypoesthesia around the scar.\r"

Correction to a femorotibial angle between 6 degrees and 14 degrees of femorotibial valgus was associated with an optimal clinical result. Undercorrection to less than 5 degrees of femorotibial valgus was associated with a high (62.5%) failure rate. Patients whose distal femur had a femoral shaft-transcondylar (FS-TC) angle of less than 9 degrees have an increased incidence of undercorrection. A poor prognosis was noted in knees whose patellofemoral joint preoperatively had moderate or severe roentgenographic evidence of osteoarthritis (OA) when compared to the group whose patellofemoral compartment had no or mild roentgenographic evidence of OA. Accurate femorotibial realignment was essential for success. The slope of the distal femoral articular surface, the FS-TC angle, affects the degree of correction and should be considered in preoperative planning.\r"

The lateral displacement corrects the varus position of the metatarsal, while the plantar displacement prevents the distal fragment from tilting dorsally into a metatarsus elevatus deformity that could produce metatarsalgia. Seventy-four cases of hallux valgus treated by this method were reviewed five years postoperatively. Sixty-six cases (89%) were graded as satisfactory and eight (11%) as unsatisfactory. Roentgenographic analysis in 61 cases showed the operation had reduced the hallux valgus angle by an average of 15 degrees and the intermetatarsal angle by an average of 4 degrees. The operation shortened the first metatarsal by an average of 5 mm. Although this caused callosities on the forefoot, it did not produce metatarsalgia. The operation is technically uncomplicated and yields a high percentage of satisfactory results.\r"

L-dopa was administered 500 mg initially and over three weeks was gradually increased to 500 mg orally three times a day. Treatment was continued for six months or until the fracture healed. After six months, 21 patients (84%) had no pain with full activity and solid bony union by roentgenograms and were considered healed. This study suggests that L-dopa improves the capacity of nonunited fractures to heal. Proof would require a randomized, double-blind series of patients.

Computed instrumental testing of these knees, however, revealed measurable degrees of residual cruciate laxity in spite of the absence of patient symptoms.

The purpose of this work was to identify the etiology of this deformity using a rabbit model. Twenty-two eight-week-old rabbits were divided into two groups. In Group I, the medial periosteum was excised from the left proximal tibial metaphysis. A partial osteotomy was created 5 mm distal to the epiphyseal plate, involving the medial one-half of the tibial metaphysis. Two 0.7-mm Kirschner wires were placed as markers on each side of the osteotomy. In Group II, the identical procedure was performed from the lateral side. Standard roentgenograms were obtained postoperatively and weekly until death by sodium pentobarbital overdose at six weeks. The angular deformity, medial growth, and lateral growth were calculated from the markers on the roentgenograms. All tibias were decalcified and analyzed under light microscopy. In Group I, all 11 rabbits developed valgus deformity averaging 12.2 degrees; asymmetric growth was statistically significant. In Group II, ten of 11 rabbits developed varus deformity averaging 9.8 degrees; asymmetric growth was not statistically significant. Despite obvious asymmetric growth in both groups, light microscopy failed to reveal any asymmetry of the physis. Valgus and varus deformities are secondary to asymmetric growth, which is not demonstrable by light microscopy.\r"

The use of additional test series in Indonesia to detect allergy to traditional cosmetics and perfumes merits further investigation.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this study was to compare the response of respiratory drive to progressive hypoxia under eucapnic and hypercapnic conditions in patients with severe COPD. Twenty-five patients with severe COPD and 13 nonsmoking young men were studied. The pressure in the occluded airway measured 0.1 second after the onset of inspiration was used as an index of respiratory drive. The occlusion pressure was measured at levels of SaO2 between 97 and 85 percent while eucapnic. The PETCO2 was then increased 10 mm Hg and the study repeated. The response of respiratory drive to hypoxia as measured by the slope of the regression line relating occlusion pressure to SaO2 was weak and variable in eucapnic hypoxia, and some subjects had no demonstrable response. When mild respiratory acidosis was created by increasing the PETCO2, the response to hypoxia was much greater and occurred in all subjects studied. Respiratory acidosis resulting from acute elevation of the PaCO2 greatly potentiates the increase in respiratory drive in response to hypoxia in normal subjects and in patients with severe COPD. Increase in occlusion pressure may occur with slight degrees of hypoxia when acute hypercapnia is present. These observations suggest that patients with acute respiratory failure complicating COPD, treated with controlled oxygen administration with only partial correction of hypoxia and continued respiratory acidosis, will have high respiratory drive.\r"

However, little is published regarding therapy for unusual intraoperative findings, especially when the existence of multiple tears of the aortic wall would increase the operative difficulties and the associated risks. Our report concerns the presentation of three consecutive cases where multiple traumatic transections of the thoracic aorta could not be diagnosed by standard preoperative techniques. Our attention is focused on different technical options and their outcome when unusual intraoperative findings are present. We concluded that the event of unusual intraoperative findings may change the initial surgical management in favor of a more definitive procedure which usually carries a longer aortic cross-clamp time. In this instance, the availability of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) techniques is warranted.\r"

This study revealed adults with CF to function on a par with their healthy peers in nearly all respects, a finding at odds with those from uncontrolled studies and which suggests to us that many previous conclusions about the psychosocial health of adults with CF have been unwarranted. Future psychosocial studies involving patients with CF should include control groups and inferences about the effect of these patients' physical illness on their psychosocial health should not be made in the absence of normative data.\r"

However, in a recent study of patients being weaned from mechanical ventilation, we found that tachypnea was quite accurate in predicting an unsuccessful weaning outcome. The present study was undertaken to examine the relationship between nonobtrusive measurements of respiratory frequency, using a calibrated inductive plethysmograph, and detailed measurements of pulmonary function in 11 adult patients with cystic fibrosis of varying severity. Respiratory frequency was increased in the patients with cystic fibrosis compared with a group of healthy control subjects, as was minute ventilation and mean inspiratory flow. Respiratory frequency was a sensitive predictor of respiratory dysfunction, being significantly (p less than 0.05) correlated with airway obstruction (r = 0.76), hyperinflation (r = 0.52), arterial oxygenation (r = -0.59), rib cage-abdominal discoordination (r = 0.54), and maximum ventilation during exercise (r = 0.66). Despite the presence of tachypnea, the patients did not display shallow breathing; indeed, tidal volume was not correlated with any of the above abnormalities. In conclusion, respiratory rate was a useful indicator of respiratory dysfunction in this group of patients with cystic fibrosis.\r"

A case-control comparison revealed that these 18 patients died sooner than hemoptysis-free patients with CF matched for age, sex, and pulmonary function (p less than 0.02), with the excess mortality occurring within the first three months after BAE. Of all 25 patients followed, six died of cardiorespiratory failure within three months of BAE; in two of them, hemoptysis was a contributing cause of death. The 19 patients who lived more than three months after BAE had a mean survival after embolization of 3.5 years (five were still alive at the end of the study). Most patients experienced long intervals (greater than 1 year) free of major hemoptysis. Extended follow-up (mean, 35 months) revealed a higher incidence of recurrent severe bleeding than previously reported for 13 of these patients followed a mean of 11 months. Repeat BAE for severe recurrence was performed successfully in eight of nine patients, without complication.\r"

The temperature to which the nebulizer solution of each system fell during generation was measured. The nebulizers were then kept at set temperatures, generated aerosols collected and either droplet size or solute concentration measured. The droplet solute concentration was found to increase. The droplet size decreased along with the droplet solute concentration increase. The ultrasonic nebulizer also was tested: its high output made the concentration of the solution in the droplets much more stable. However, the proportion of droplets depositing in the tubing and valves changed markedly with aerosol flow rate. The potential for large changes in droplet solute concentration, droplet size and output during nebulization should be considered in therapeutic and diagnostic applications of nebulized aerosols.\r"

They were compared to maps of 15 CAD patients who exercised to fatigue, without angina, and eight normal subjects. Peak exercise heart rates were similar (NS) in all groups. With exercise angina, patients with two and three vessel CAD had significantly (p less than 0.05) greater decrease in the body surface sum of ST integral values than patients with single vessel CAD. CAD patients with exercise fatigue, in the absence of angina, had decreased ST integrals similar (NS) to patients with single vessel CAD who manifested angina and the normal control subjects. There was, however, considerable overlap among individuals; some patients with single vessel CAD had as much exercise ST integral decrease as patients with three vessel CAD. All CAD patients had persistent ST integral decreases at 5 min of recovery and there was a direct correlation of the recovery and peak exercise ST changes. Exercise ST changes correlated, as well, with quantitative CAD angiographic scores, but not with thallium perfusion scores. These data suggest exercise ST integral body surface mapping allows quantitation of myocardium at ischemic risk in patients with CAD, irrespective of the presence or absence of ischemic symptoms during exercise. A major potential application of this technique is selection of CAD therapy guided by quantitative assessment of ischemic myocardial risk.\r"

Two nebulizer systems, System 22 Mizer (MedicAid) and Respirgard II (Marquest) were modified by adding 40 cm of corrugated tubing (volume 150 ml) to allow the patients to be studied in both the sitting and supine posture. Modification of the nebulizers caused a reduction in lung deposition in the sitting position for the System 22 Mizer but increased deposition in the Respirgard II compared with the unmodified apparatus. The ratio of upper to lower zone deposition (corrected for 133Xe distribution) was increased in the supine position for both devices (p less than 0.01). The best upper zone deposition was achieved with the unmodified System 22 Mizer in the sitting position. Respirgard II had the lowest nonpulmonary deposition and the lowest incidence of adverse effects. The supine position was associated with a redistribution of deposition to the upper zones. To attempt to reduce upper zone recurrence of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, the supine posture is suggested for less efficient nebulizer devices, ie, the Respirgard II, but for more efficient systems, ie, System 22 Mizer, the sitting position is probably suitable. This postulate needs to be confirmed by a clinical trial.\r"

  ".W": "Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed in 51 adult immunocompromised patients (30 acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS] and 21 non-AIDS) as part of an extensive diagnostic evaluation for diffuse pulmonary infiltrates. Because multiple episodes occurred in several patients, a total of 60 BALs were performed. A diagnosis of fungal pneumonia was eventually made in 12 patients (24 percent). The organism was identified in BALs from seven of the 12, including five of seven cases of cocciodoidomycosis, one of two cases of aspergillosis, and one of three cases of cryptococcosis. Among the AIDS patients, only one case of coccidioidomycosis was diagnosed, whereas six such diagnoses were made from the 25 BALs performed on the 21 non-AIDS patients. This suggests that coccidioidomycosis is not as frequent an infection in AIDS patients in this endemic area as has been suggested previously. Candida-like organisms were identified in 23 BALs, but in no case were they clinically pathogenic. Their presence correlated with oral candidiasis (p = 0.01). Twenty-seven of 29 episodes related to Pneumocystis carinii were identified by Papanicolaou-stained cytocentrifuged BAL preparations, all but two of which were in AIDS patients. In addition, BALs detected six episodes of bacterial pneumonia and three of five cases of radiation pneumonitis. Overall, the diagnostic sensitivity of BAL was 52 of 60 or 87 percent. While examination of induced sputum for the presence of Pneumocystis may eliminate the need for bronchoscopy in some AIDS patients, BAL remains an excellent diagnostic procedure in the immunocompromised patient without AIDS.\r"

These cells showed significant cytotoxicity against autologous AM phi. The AM phi which had been cultured for four days served as better targets than freshly isolated AM phi. Kinetic study showed that the lysis of AM phi was proportional to the incubation time of MNCs with IL-2 and that LAK cells against AM phi required two days of in vitro culture with IL-2 for their induction. Freshly isolated MNCs did not lyse AM phi but did lyse K562 target cells, indicating that AM phi are natural killer-resistant. The phenotypes of effector cells against AM phi were found to be CD8+ or CD16+ (or both). These studies indicate that IL-2 can generate LAK cells against autologous AM phi, and this cytolytic activity must be taken into account when IL-2 or LAK cells are used for immunomodulation in patients with cancer.\r"

During total cardiopulmonary bypass, we measured systemic to pulmonary bronchial blood flow (Qbr[s-p]) which is the volume of blood accumulating into the left side of the heart in the absence of pulmonary and coronary flow. A cannula was introduced into the right upper pulmonary vein and advanced into the lowermost portion of the left side of the heart. From this cannula Qbr(s-p) was vented by gravity and measured. Inspired gas (10 L/min, endotracheal tube, 50 percent O2 + 50 percent N2O) relative humidity was less than 20 percent and greater than 85 percent in group A (n = 25) and in group B (n = 25), respectively. Mean (+/- SE) Qbr(s-p) was 40.7 +/- 0.06 ml/min or 1.32 +/- 0.12 ml/min (percent cardiac output) in group A and 21.7 +/- 1.8 ml/min or 0.68 +/- 0.06 ml/min in group B. These data indicate that under these conditions Qbr(s-p) is increased by dry gas lung inflation in humans.\r"

The mean single breath transfer factor (Dco) and the mean membrane diffusing capacity were significantly lower (p less than 0.001) in patients with tropical eosinophilia compared with control subjects. However, the mean capillary blood volume was not significantly different (p greater than 0.2). The positive correlations between Dm and transfer factor (r = 0.825), between Dm and effective alveolar volume (VA) (r = 0.721), and between Dco and VA (r = 0.774) were also highly significant (p less than 0.001) in study patients prior to treatment. These data suggest that reduction in single breath transfer factor in untreated tropical eosinophilia may be due to a reduction in membrane diffusing capacity, which in turn may be due to a reduction in area of membrane available for diffusion, as evidenced by the significantly reduced VA (p less than 0.001) in these patients. Since pulmonary capillary blood volume was normal, the pulmonary perfusion was within normal limits. Following three weeks of treatment with diethylcarbamazine citrate, although there was a significant rise in single breath transfer factor (p less than 0.001) and membrane diffusing capacity (p less than 0.05), both Dco (p less than 0.01) and Dm (p less than 0.01) continued to be significantly lower than those of control subjects. However, pulmonary capillary blood volume did not show any change (p greater than 0.2).\r"

To investigate whether the modulation is implicated in the pathogenic mechanism of pulmonary disease, we determined the MFI of CD3, CD4 and CD8 on lung and blood lymphocytes in ten normal subjects and 54 patients with various pulmonary and extrapulmonary diseases. Although there were no significant differences in MFI of these accessory molecules on lung lymphocytes among the groups, MFI of CD3 on lung lymphocytes was significantly decreased compared with that on blood lymphocytes in all groups, demonstrating the modulation of CD3 on lung lymphocytes. Since it has been shown that T cells whose CD3/TCR is modulated are hyporesponsive to various mitogenic signals, our observation seems to represent another aspect of the mechanism whereby the local pulmonary milieu maintains the autoregulation of immune response.\r"

Among 136 employees examined, there were 107 current and 29 medically terminated workers; 23 (17 percent) subjects had a positive platinum salts prick skin test and 19 (14 percent) displayed a positive cold air challenge. RAST binding for platinum salts IgE antibodies showed a high level of agreement with platinum skin prick test results. A proportion (63 percent) of the population (74 current and 12 terminated workers) underwent repeat platinum skin testing one year later. Among current workers, there was conversion of the platinum skin test from negative to a positive test in five employees, with three conversions occurring in workers who showed only a positive cold air challenge test the year before. Platinum skin sensitivity, asthma symptoms, and nonspecific airway hyperresponsiveness persisted for years after termination of exposure in some medically terminated workers presumably because of a delay in removal from work of employees who became sensitized to platinum salts. It is suggested that proper surveillance for occupational asthma involves the use of several testing procedures. Prompt removal from work of individuals found to become sensitized to platinum salts is important in this industry.\r"

There was no difference in the girls. Both boys and girls with NS had about three times more allergic rhinitis and ten times more atopic dermatitis than the general population. In NS patients with associated allergic disease, skin test and allergen-specific IgE antibodies by radioallergosorbent test (RAST) were performed. Most of the patients with dust mites (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoides farinae), egg white, or cow's milk protein-specific antibodies had positive skin tests. One hundred of the 206 children with NS received renal biopsies and serum IgE levels were measured. During the acute nephrotic phase the geometric mean serum IgE levels in minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS), IgM mesangial nephropathy (IgMN), hepatitis B virus-associated membranous nephropathy, and treatment-responsive focal segmental glomerular sclerosis patients were all significantly elevated, in descending order of significance. These high serum IgE levels decreased in remission of NS and elevated again during relapse. The relationship between high serum IgE levels in NS patients and the incidence of allergic diseases showed that one third to one fourth of either IgMN or MCNS patients developed allergic diseases. These results suggest that NS patients had a higher allergic disease incidence. Serum IgE level may serve as one of the prognostic factors. However, an increase in the IgE level may be a reflection of body immunoregulatory imbalance that plays a direct pathogenic role in the occurrence of NS and proteinuria.\r"

  ".W": "Pulse oximetry is widely used in the critical care setting, but few studies have examined its usefulness in clinical decision making. One area where pulse oximetry might be useful is in the titration of fractional inspired O2 concentration (FIO2) in ventilator-dependent patients. Unfortunately, documented guidelines for this use do not exist, and in a survey of directors of intensive care units, we found that they employed a wide range of target O2 saturation (SpO2) values. Consequently, we undertook a study to determine if SpO2 could be reliably substituted for measurements of arterial O2 tension (PaO2) when adjusting FIO2 in ventilator-dependent patients. We examined a number of SpO2 target values in 54 critically ill patients aiming for a PaO2 of greater than or equal to 60 mm Hg, while minimizing the risk of O2 toxicity. In white patients, we found that a SpO2 target of 92 percent was reliable in predicting a satisfactory level of oxygenation. However, in black patients, such a SpO2 reading was commonly associated with significant hypoxemia (PaO2 as low as 49 mm Hg), and a higher SpO2 target, 95 percent, was required. In addition, inaccurate oximetry readings (ie, greater than 4 percent difference between SpO2 and direct SaO2 measurements) were more common in black (27 percent) than in white patients (11 percent, p less than 0.05). In conclusion, a SpO2 target of 92 percent was reliable when titrating supplemental O2 in white patients receiving mechanical ventilation; however, in black patients, such a SpO2 reading was commonly associated with significant hypoxemia, and a higher SpO2 target, 95 percent, was required to ensure a satisfactory level of oxygenation.\r"

Intermittent inspiratory chest tube occlusion (IICTO) is recognized as effective in controlling even the largest BPF; however, IICTO, as previously described, is difficult to use for a variety of reasons. We report two cases of BPF in association with ARF managed with a simple new device that allows the application of IICTO with virtually any mechanical ventilator. The effectiveness of the device and associated technique in controlling BPF leaks is clearly demonstrated and may have played a role in the eventual recovery of a patient with BPF. Further study of the technique is warranted.\r"

We therefore studied the effect of epinephrine and norepinephrine on MDO2 and MVO2 using OCCM after five minutes of cardiopulmonary arrest in 21 pigs. After OCCM of three minutes, seven animals each received placebo (controls) or epinephrine (45 micrograms/kg) or norepinephrine (45 micrograms/kg). All drugs were given blindly. At 90 seconds after epinephrine or norepinephrine, mean arterial blood pressure was significantly higher than in the control group. Prior to cardiac arrest, MBF, measured with radioactive microspheres, was 193 +/- 30 ml/min/100 g. During CPR but before drug administration, MBF was 51 +/- 23 in the control group, 71 +/- 10 in the group with epinephrine, and 74 +/- 11 ml/min/100 g in the group with norepinephrine. At 90 seconds after epinephrine, MBF increased to 126 +/- 18 and after norepinephrine to 107 +/- 30 ml/min/100 g (p less than 0.05). Compared to OCCM alone, MDO2 increased from 9.6 +/- 1.7 to 17.1 +/- 3.2 ml/min/100 g after epinephrine and from 9.4 +/- 1.8 to 13.6 +/- 4.2 ml/min/100 g after norepinephrine (p less than 0.05). There was an increase in MVO2 from 4.0 +/- 1.5 to 9.4 +/- 3.0 ml/min/100 g after epinephrine (p less than 0.05), whereas MVO2 increased only from 4.2 +/- 0.8 to 5.1 +/- 2.0 ml/min/100 g after norepinephrine. Because epinephrine led to a greater increase in MVO2 than norepinephrine, the myocardial oxygen ER remained unchanged. The oxygen requirements of the fibrillating heart seemed to be increased via beta 2-adrenergic stimulation. In both the control and epinephrine-treated groups, only three of the seven animals could be successfully resuscitated, whereas all of the animals in the group with norepinephrine survived the 15-minute period of observation. In this model, norepinephrine, in contrast to epinephrine, improves the balance between MDO2 and MVO2 and eases restoration of spontaneous circulation.\r"

On autopsy, a quantitative histologic analysis of the heart revealed that the area of disarray was limited both to the ventricular septum and the left ventricular free wall as in a normal heart. This is not typical of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy because the extent of disarray is high in most cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Some form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, however, seemed to be present in this patient because right ventricular pressure overload did not affect the left ventricular free wall. To clarify the relation between hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and Noonan's syndrome, quantitative histologic analysis is necessary.\r"

While massive hemoptysis has traditionally been defined in terms of the volume of blood produced within a period of time, with a rate of 600 ml in 24 hours the most commonly used definition, a more functional definition has been proposed: bleeding into the tracheobronchial tree at a rate that poses a threat to life. It is the life-threatening nature of this symptom that often results in the early involvement of thoracic surgeons in the care of these patients.\r"

Effects of glucose on both diacylglycerol mass and protein kinase C were evident at 5 and 15 min but waned by 30 min. An increase in glucose concentration in the medium also increased the incorporation of [14C]glucose into the glycerol backbone of diacylglycerol, triacylglycerol, and phospholipids. Several observations implied that [14C]glucose was being incorporated into diacylglycerol through the de novo pathway for glycerolipid synthesis rather than being derived from phospholipids. 1) [14C]glucose incorporation into all the lipids was suppressed by 2-deoxyglucose. 2) The incorporation of [14C]glucose into diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol was evident by 1 min and increased linearly for at least 30 min. In contrast, incorporation into phosphatidylcholine occurred with a lag of at least 5 min. 3) Although only 10% of the [14C]glucose incorporated into lipids was present in diacylglycerol versus greater than 50% in phospholipids, the specific activity of [14C]glucose in diacylglycerol was fivefold higher than that in phospholipid when expressed as a function of mass. 4) Glucose had no effect on labeled diacylglycerol or phosphatidic acid production in glomeruli that had been prelabeled with [3H]glycerol. Glucose-induced increases in diacylglycerol may contribute to the activation of glomerular protein kinase C observed in early diabetes.\r"

Previous results showed that coxsackievirus B4 (CB4)-infected genetically identical db/db mice with and without diabetes could be distinguished by the levels of CB4-neutralizing antibody and virus-specific antibodies as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the numbers of splenic antibody-forming cells. Our results show that the diabetic genotype db/db R was deficient in total spleen lymphocytes and lymphocyte subsets and was unable to produce agglutinating antibody to sheep erythrocytes (SRBCs) or specific antibody to noninfectious CB4. The db/db AL mutant expressing the diabetic phenotype was not as deficient in spleen cell parameters. The response to noninfectious CB4 was delayed but substantial. The db/db AL mouse was also unique with its higher agglutinating antibody levels after virus infection than its uninfected control or the infected or uninfected db/db R mouse. In vitro SRBC immunization of spleen lymphocytes determined that this enhanced response was largely dependent on the diabetic milieu and was not a property of the cells. Genetic predisposition to diabetes is characterized by immunodeficiency as evident from inadequate levels of antibodies to infectious or noninfectious antigens and absolute and relative deficiency in spleen lymphocyte subsets and total numbers of spleen cells. Phenotypic expression of diabetes results in partial amelioration of the immunodeficiency evident in diabetic genotype db/db R without disease.\r"

A significant relationship was found between these two parameters. Similar results were obtained when protein glycosylation and Ca2(+)-ATPase activity were measured in membranes from normal erythrocytes preincubated with glucose. In this condition, both parameters showed a clear time and dose dependence. Incubation of erythrocyte membranes instead of intact erythrocytes with glucose and glucose-6-phosphate strongly suggests that only the glycosylation of the membrane inner-surface proteins can affect Ca2(+)-ATPase activity. The simultaneous presence of 10 mM glucose and 5 mM ATP in the incubation medium did not affect the degree of erythrocyte membrane protein glycosylation but significantly blocked the inhibitory effect of glucose on Ca2(+)-ATPase activity. However, 5 mM ATP only partially blocked the inhibitory effect of 100 mM glucose, suggesting a competitive mechanism of glucose and ATP for the enzyme active site. Our results show that glycosylation of erythrocyte membrane proteins significantly inhibits Ca2(+)-ATPase activity. This effect could contribute to the development of the capillary closure process observed in diabetic patients. Furthermore, it could represent an index of a general impairment of enzyme function arising in cells chronically exposed to high glucose levels.\r"

In this study, we analyzed the effect of fasting and refeeding and streptozocin-induced diabetes and subsequent insulin treatment on the expression of the erythroid/brain and liver GT polypeptides and their mRNAs in rat liver. The erythroid/brain GT mRNA in livers of control rats corresponded to 1-3% of the amount of liver GT mRNA. After a 4-day fast, its level increased approximately 3-fold and represented 8-10% of the liver GT mRNA, whereas the corresponding protein increased 4-fold. In livers from diabetic rats, levels of the erythroid/brain GT mRNA increased up to 2.4-fold and gradually returned to normal with chronic insulin treatment. Levels of the corresponding protein were minimally altered. Levels of immunoreactive liver GTs were not significantly changed by 2 days of fasting, 7 or 14 days of diabetes, or subsequent insulin treatment for 3, 5, or 7 days but increased up to 75% with refeeding for 3-48 h. Liver GT mRNA levels minimally decreased in diabetic or insulin-treated rats, decreased 45% after a 2-day fast, and increased up to 5-fold on refeeding for 24 h.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The relative youth of the discipline of family medicine and the bimodal age distribution of its members limit the availability of mentors for junior faculty. Junior faculty members seeking mentor relationships can benefit from taking a proactive approach to identifying needs likely to be met by a mentor. These needs include: professional socialization, role modeling, nurturing, teaching, and advocacy. Multiple mentors may be required to meet these needs. Family medicine departments can foster mentor relationships by providing formal and informal mechanisms for interaction between junior faculty members and the senior faculty within and outside the department. Future research which characterizes successful components of mentor relationships and examines creative ways of meeting mentoring needs would benefit the discipline of family medicine.\r"

Of 1,264 telephone calls, 392 (31.0%) resulted in a medication prescription. Of these calls, 176 (44.9%) were for refills of previously prescribed medicines. The most common drugs for new telephone prescriptions were decongestants/antihistamines/antitussives, antibiotics, and pain medications. Medicines were more likely to be prescribed via telephone for the diagnoses of upper respiratory infections, headache, low-back pain, or bronchitis. A patient was more likely than expected to get a telephone prescription for new problems when a message was left in the office for the physician by a caller other than the patient's son or daughter.\r"

As a result, educators have begun to consider the relationship between gender and both performance and career preference. The current study explores the relationship between a student's gender and the educational experience of the student. In the setting of established primary care teaching physicians' offices at the University of Illinois College of Medicine at Rockford, gender and diagnosis data were collected on all patient encounters over the course of one year for the 129 students enrolled in the program. Women medical students were 29% less likely than chance to see male patients, and male students were 5% less likely than chance to see female patients in this setting. This finding was especially marked for encounters with younger adult patients and for sexually sensitive examinations, but was noted with all groups of adult patients. The qualitative effect of this on both educational experiences and health care delivery needs to be addressed.\r"

A questionnaire was mailed to a systematic sample of all adult women patients of an academic-affiliated family practice (n = 939) in a rural southeastern United States community. Approximately 64% of the sample responded, and 440 (91%) of the returned questionnaires could be used in the analysis. Over half of the patients had no gender preference for the examining physician; when a preference was indicated, it was for a woman physician. Patients expressing a preference were more likely to be younger, never married, nulliparous, and black. Gender of the examining physician was a major factor in the desire for a chaperone during pelvic exams. A chaperone was desired most often when the examining physician was male, and this was especially so when a female physician was preferred. The results indicate most women desired a chaperone when the physician was male, but preferred no chaperone or had no preference when a woman physician was involved.\r"

  ".W": "Responses of national samples of 329 residency-trained family physicians and 237 obstetricians were studied to determine the attitudes of family physicians and obstetricians toward the practice of obstetrics by family physicians. The attitudes of obstetricians and family physicians varied greatly, and the attitudes of obstetricians toward obstetric care provided by family physicians tended to become less supportive following the time of the obstetricians' training. In particular, obstetricians felt strongly that family physicians were inadequately trained to provide uncomplicated obstetric care. These negative attitudes were reflected in obstetricians' opinions regarding hospital obstetric privileges for family physicians. From a list of 11 obstetric privileges, obstetricians indicated that residency-trained family physicians should be granted a mean of 2.2 privileges, while family physicians who currently practice obstetrics indicated a mean of 6.6 (P less than .001). Family physicians who felt well supported by obstetricians during their obstetric training were more likely to develop positive attitudes toward obstetric practice than those who were not well supported. Both obstetricians and family physicians indicated that the adequacy of maternity care in rural areas would decline if family physicians withdrew from maternity care. There was strong agreement that rising malpractice premiums may soon force family physicians to stop delivering babies. This study concludes that there are vast differences among obstetricians and family physicians in perceptions regarding obstetric practice by family physicians which may adversely affect such practice.\r"

Using Spearman coefficients, the correlation for total MSSI scores between birth and nine months was .75. The correlations for individual items between birth and nine months ranged from .22 to .76. The MSSI at birth was strongly correlated with the Dyadic Adjustment Scale at nine months (r = .41, P = .001). Scores on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale at birth were inversely and significantly associated with the MSSI at six weeks postpartum (r = .50, P = .004). The MSSI assesses important elements of a new mother's environment which are related to her satisfaction with an intimate other, as well as depressive symptoms. These findings are similar to those in earlier reports.\r"

  ".W": "In normal individuals there is an adaptive immune response to a foreign antigen in which antibodies of increasing affinity are produced with time. This is not always true of an autoimmune response. However, because only a limited number of autoantigens have been cloned or purified, this issue has not been studied well. In primary biliary cirrhosis the predominant manifestation of autoimmunity is antimitochondrial antibodies that react with dihydrolipoamide transacetylase. The availability of recombinant dihydrolipoamide transacetylase and the development of a rapid and reproducible enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for autoantibodies has allowed us to address the affinity of autoantibodies using thiocyanate inhibition. Thiocyanate is a chaotropic compound known to inhibit antigen-antibody binding in a concentration-dependent manner. We used this property to inhibit the binding by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of human recombinant dihydrolipoamide transacetylase with serum autoantibodies from 55 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. The relative affinity and serum autoantibody titers were then compared with the histological stage of the liver biopsy sample. Interestingly, we found a considerable heterogeneity of relative affinities. These relative affinities did not correlate with the histological stage or the serum titer of antimitochondrial antibodies. However, the ability of serum autoantibodies to inhibit intact primary biliary cirrhosis enzyme activity was found to correlate highly (R2 = 0.751) with the relative affinity. Thus there are profound differences between patients with respect to qualitative expression of autoantibodies. The significance of this data will be unclear until more is determined regarding the nature of the epitope that drives T cells and leads to B-cell responses.\r"

  ".W": "There is increasing interest in the changes of the endothelial lining of the hepatic sinusoids during the development of chronic liver disease. In this study we looked for evidence of hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cell transformation and basement membrane production in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Morphological transformation to vascular-type endothelial cells, as evidenced by the development VIII-related antigen, was seen at the interface between portal tracts or fibrous septae and hepatic parenchyma; the most marked changes were observed in patients with established cirrhosis. Increased immunohistochemical staining for the basement membrane components type IV collagen and laminin was also found in a similar distribution. Raised serum levels of hyaluronic acid, a glycosaminoglycan metabolized by normal hepatic endothelial cells, were found in most patients and correlated strongly with advancing histological stage. Furthermore, significant positive correlations were found between serum hyaluronic acid and serum levels of laminin and type IV collagen. The unique structure of the normal endothelial lining of the hepatic sinusoids is important in the maintenance of hepatic function. Our data show that significant changes in endothelial cell structure and function occur in primary biliary cirrhosis and appear to be a contributing factor to the progression of the disease. Further studies are needed to determine the extent and importance of these changes in other forms of chronic liver disease.\r"

  ".U": "90269748\r", 
  ".W": "This study was designed to test the hypothesis that increasing the infusion rate of bile salts could overcome drug-induced cholestasis. Cholestasis was induced by administration of 17.5 mumol/L estradiol-17 beta-D-glucuronide during the infusion of taurocholate, tauroursodeoxycholate or dehydrocholate at 20 nmol/min/gm liver. After 30 min, a bolus of 10 mumol of the bile salts was added to the perfusate, and the infusion rate of each bile salt was increased. Taurocholate at a rate of 62 or 125 nmol/min/gm liver, caused a prompt dose-dependent increase of the depressed bile flow and bile salt excretion. A higher rate of taurocholate infusion (180 nmol/min/gm liver) was less effective than either the 62 or 125 rate in increasing bile flow. Infusion of tauroursodeoxycholate at 250 or 390 nmol/min/gm liver also led to a dose-dependent recovery. Further increase of tauroursodeoxycholate infusion rate of 580 nmol/min/gm liver did not provide any additional recovery in bile flow. Dehydrocholate, at rates of 62 or 125 nmol/min/gm liver, gave only a slight enhancement of bile flow. Both taurocholate and tauroursodeoxycholate caused a marked removal of the estradiol-17 beta-D-glucuronide, which had accumulated in the liver. At lower taurocholate infusion rates, the estradiol-17 beta-D-glucuronide was excreted mainly in the bile. At the highest rate, however, biliary excretion of estradiol-17 beta-D-glucuronide declined significantly, and a marked back-efflux of the estrogen into the perfusate was noted. In contrast, tauroursodeoxycholate led to enhanced biliary estradiol-17 beta-D-glucuronide excretion at all increased tauroursodeoxycholate infusion rates and to only a small increase in back-efflux of estradiol-17 beta-D-glucuronide at the two highest tauroursodeoxycholate infusion rates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The reason for the discrepancy between bile flow and biliary bile acid excretion during ursodeoxycholate infusion in rats is unknown. We found that ursodeoxycholate-glucuronide is formed during ursodeoxycholate infusion at higher doses. Ursodeoxycholate infusion (1 to 3 mumol/min/100 gm body weight) for 90 min caused marked hypercholeresis, and the previously reported discrepancy between bile flow and biliary bile acid excretion was observed when bile acid concentrations were measured by regular enzymatic methods. However, the appearance of ursodeoxycholate-glucuronide was observed on thin-layer chromatography analysis and up to 30% of the ursodeoxycholate in bile was found to be glucuronidated when determined by the enzymatic method after beta-glucuronidase treatment. The choleretic activity of ursodeoxycholate-glucuronide (25.2 microliters/mumol) was about 3 times higher than that of ursodeoxycholate (8.9 microliters/mumol) when infused at 0.25 mumol/min/100 gm body weight and ursodeoxycholate-glucuronide also stimulated higher biliary bicarbonate excretion than ursodeoxycholate. These results indicate that the discrepancy between bile flow and biliary bile acid excretion caused by high-dose infusion of ursodeoxycholate into rats can be explained by glucuronide conjugation of ursodeoxycholate that cannot be detected by the regular enzymatic method. The glucuronidation of ursodeoxycholate might also be important in the ursodeoxycholate-induced increase in biliary bicarbonate excretion.\r"

  ".W": "Isolated rat hepatocytes have been advocated as a model to study aspects of mechanism of chemical-induced interference with biliary excretory function. Some technical problems do exist in studying efflux, such as the reuptake of the previously excreted substrate. Another concern is the loss of liver-specific functions in hepatocytes with continuing time in culture. It is important to address such technical aspects and to determine whether the process of efflux is compromised in primary cultures of hepatocytes. In the presence of Na+ the apparent efflux of taurocholate from hepatocytes was shown to be significantly confounded by reuptake of substrate. The unidirectional efflux was best demonstrated in buffer where choline replaced Na+. A comparison of efflux kinetics for cultured cells to those in suspension showed that both apparent affinity for transport carriers and transport capacity were greater in the former. The simple diffusion component for efflux increased with the time in culture, but affinity for transport carriers and transport capacity remained unchanged over 6 to 24 hr. However, it was not possible to determine meaningful kinetic constants after 24 hr in culture because the uptake of taurocholate was so low. Primary cultured hepatocytes may therefore be of limited value in the study of efflux of bile salts in the longer term, mainly because of the inability of cells to take up and accumulate a sufficiently high level of bile salts.\r"

Protoporphyrin-induced reduction of bile flow was similar in the presence of each bile acid. The cholestasis was greater at high doses (2,000 to 10,885 nmol) than at low doses (1,500 nmol) of protoporphyrin, unrelated to the amount of lactate dehydrogenase released into the perfusate, and it was not altered by increasing bile acid infusions. Bile acid excretion was inhibited by high protoporphyrin doses. Periportal birefringent pigment deposits were seen in canaliculi and ductules when the biliary protoporphyrin concentration exceeded 161 nmol/ml, 345 nmol/ml and 1,036 nmol/ml for ursodeoxycholate, chenodeoxycholate and taurocholate, respectively; or, when the protoporphyrin (nanomole) to bile acid (micromole) ratio exceeded 3.23, 7.03 and 23.43, respectively. The maximal ratio of ductular deposits to portal tract deposits examined was 0.9. Electron microscopy showed these deposits were associated with canalicular thrombi. Thus, biliary thrombi were produced by infusion of bile acids and protoporphyrin. The occurrence of thrombi varied with bile acid structure. Explanations for this finding are speculative. The presence of periportal thrombi, however, did not influence the degree of functional cholestasis.\r"

Histological examination of liver biopsy specimens before treatment revealed accumulation of fat within hepatocytes, bile duct epithelium and endothelial and Kupffer cells. Cholesterol crystals were recognized by their birefringence in frozen sections. A striking feature was the presence of markedly hypertrophied Kupffer cells and portal macrophages with foamy, tan-colored cytoplasm that stained readily with the periodic acid-Schiff reagent and aldehyde fuchsin. Periportal fibrosis was noted in all cases; incomplete cirrhosis was present in one case. Distinctive and hitherto undescribed lysosomal accumulations of triglyceride and cholesterol crystals were noted. The patients were treated with lovastatin, a cholesterol-lowering agent, for at least 12 mo. No significant changes were seen in serum lipoprotein concentrations or liver histopathology after therapy. Thus lovastatin did not have an obviously beneficial effect on abnormal lipid metabolism in these patients.\r"

The objective of this study was to investigate this relationship in a different experimental model of cirrhosis in rats and to learn whether alteration of drug-metabolizing activity by hepatic enzyme induction changes the threshold for urinary sodium retention. Cirrhosis was induced in untreated and phenobarbital-treated rats by bile duct excision. Liver function, assessed by the aminopyrine breath test, and urinary sodium excretion on a constant salt diet were measured weekly for up to 4 wk. In untreated rats, the aminopyrine breath test rate constant of elimination was reduced by about 40% within 1 wk of surgery. Aminopyrine rate constant of elimination then decreased more slowly, but linearly. Urinary sodium excretion was initially unchanged, but sodium retention occurred after 2.5 wk and was maintained until the end of the experiment. Phenobarbital-treated rats had greater initial aminopyrine rate constant of elimination, but we saw a similar fall in aminopyrine rate constant of elimination of about 40% within 1 wk of bile duct excision to a value still above baseline aminopyrine rate constant of elimination of untreated controls. Aminopyrine rate constant of elimination remained at a plateau for 3.5 wk without changes in urinary sodium excretion.

Unlabeled ferritin with tracer doses of labeled ferritin in concentrations of 0.02 to 2,700 nmol/L were studied. Rats were made iron deficient by feeding an established iron-deficient diet for 3 wk. Rats were iron loaded by injection of iron dextran (50 mg/wk) for 3 wk. The mean percentage of uptake of ferritin was similar for doses ranging from 0.22 to 22.2 nmol/L of 125I-labeled ferritin. Uptake of ferritin in the normal animal was saturable, with an apparent maximal velocity of uptake of approximately 9.1 pmol/gm/min and a Michaelis-Menten constant of approximately 5 nmol/L at 37 degrees C. Uptake was minimal at 4 degrees C. The mean uptake of ferritin was 78% +/- 10% in the iron-deficient rats (mean hepatic iron = 1.5 mumol/gm), 79% +/- 10% in the normal animals (mean hepatic iron = 9.2 mumol/gm) and 78% +/- 8% in the iron-loaded animals (mean hepatic iron = 192 mumol/gm). In this experimental system, modulation of hepatic iron did not affect uptake of ferritin, suggesting that regulation of the hepatic ferritin receptor may not depend on hepatic iron content. The rapid uptake of ferritin by the liver despite iron overload is consistent with other observations of the nonregulation of non-transferrin-bound iron by hepatic iron and may play a role in the progressive iron overload seen in hemochromatosis.\r"

The antibody F35.25 recognized an epitope located between amino-acid residues 32 and 53 on the preS1 sequence of the large HBsAg protein. This domain could be involved in the recognition of hepatitis B virus by hepatocyte receptors. PreS1 antigen detection by monoclonal antibody F35.25 closely correlated with the presence of complete virions in the serum of HBsAg carriers, as demonstrated by ultracentrifugation-gradient experiments and electron-microscopical examination. Of the 19 HBsAg carriers with chronic liver disease, preS1 antigen was detected in 17 (90%): all of the 11 HBeAg- and hepatitis B virus-DNA--positive cases (group 1) and six of eight anti-HBe--positive cases with low levels of hepatitis B virus replication (group 2). PreS1 antigen/HBsAg ratios parallel to preS1 antigen titers were significantly higher in the HBeAg-positive group (34% and 1:10(6] than in the anti-HBe--positive group (18% and 1:10(2]. In contrast, preS1 antigen was not detected in 18 (90%) of the 20 HBsAg healthy carriers positive for anti-HBe and negative for serum hepatitis B virus-DNA (group 3). Our results show that in chronic HBsAg carriers the serum expression of preS1 antigen correlates well with the level of hepatitis B virus replication (serum hepatitis B virus-DNA and/or liver HBcAg) and that it may be useful in assessing the clinical importance of the chronic viral infection.\r"

After the addition of citrulline, incorporation of tritiated thymidine into primary cultured hepatocytes of adult rat increased in a dose-dependent fashion in the range of 0.1 to 5 mmol/L. The citrulline-added group also showed significant increase in ornithine and polyamine contents in hepatocytes. The incidence of epithelial cell foci in the in vivo-in vitro tumor promotion analyzing system significantly rose in the group maintained with 5 mmol/L citrulline and in the group maintained with 1.5 mmol/L phenobarbital. These findings suggest the possibility that citrulline has a promotion effect on hepatocyte proliferation and that at high concentrations it plays the role of a hepatocarcinogenesis promoter.\r"

Studies using peroxidase-antiperoxidase staining and immunoelectron microscopy revealed that the 9B2 antigen was first detected in cytoplasm and packaged in microvilli-lined vesicles, then vectorially transported to the cell surface and eventually fused with microvilli-lined vesicles from neighboring cells to form bile canaliculi in well-differentiated hepatoma cell lines. However, the 9B2 antigen of poorly differentiated lines was synthesized in cytoplasm, then transported directly to and evenly distributed on the cell membrane. These results lead us to conclude that human hepatoma cell lines could serve as a good in vitro model to study the formation of bile canaliculi in human hepatocytes. The bile canaliculi of human hepatocytes may be preformed and assembled in the intracellular, microvilli-lined vesicles, then vectorially transported to the cell surface, where they form the bile canaliculi through vesicles fusion. Finally, formation of bile canaliculi and transport of 9B2 antigen may be related to the differentiation of hepatocytes or progression stages of human hepatoma cells.\r"

  ".W": "The abundant heme-binding protein of the liver, probably identical with Z-protein or liver fatty acid-binding protein, has an apparent molecular weight of 14,000 Da and is presumably involved in the intracellular transport of a variety of compounds. The cellular and subcellular distribution of HBP in the liver was studied in adult male and female rats by postembedding immunocytochemistry using the protein A-gold technique. By light microscopic examination heme-binding protein is present exclusively in parenchymal cells and not found in the sinusoidal lining cells or other cells in portal tracts. Immunoreactivity for heme-binding protein is uniformly strong throughout the liver lobule in female rats but is markedly reduced in the pericentral region in male animals. By immunoelectron microscopy heme-binding protein immunoreactivity is localized in cytoplasm and nuclear matrix. The mitochondria and peroxisomes and the secretory apparatus are free of the label. In nuclei, gold labeling is confined to the interchromatin region (euchromatin) and nucleoli; condensed chromatin (heterochromatin) and nucleolus-associated chromatin are negative. The subcellular localization was substantiated by radioimmunoassay and immunoblotting of nuclear and cytosolic fractions. Immunoblotting shows that the heme-binding protein-like immunoreactive protein in the nucleus has a slightly larger molecular weight than that in the cytoplasm.\r"

Hypoxia did not impair uptake of infused [3H]leukotriene C4, but inhibited biliary excretion of radioactivity by about 50% compared with normoxic control experiments. In addition, the leukotriene metabolite pattern in bile was profoundly altered and was characterized in hypoxia by a 75% to 80% decrease of both leukotriene C4 and polar metabolites, representing omega-oxidation products, whereas the appearance of leukotriene D4 in bile was not affected. Reoxygenation was followed by a marked increase of biliary excretion of polar metabolites, indicating that leukotrienes taken up and stored in the liver cells during the hypoxic period now underwent omega-oxidation with subsequent elimination of the omega-oxidized products. Hypoxia also inhibited the biliary excretion of radioactivity after [3H]leukotriene E4 addition because of an almost complete absence of omega-oxidation products in bile, whereas N-acetyl-leukotriene E4 excretion was not affected. Induction of liver injury by carbon tetrachloride treatment decreased single-pass uptake of [3H]leukotriene C4 by 30%, and only 36% of the radioactivity taken up by the liver was eliminated into bile within 1 hr, compared with 78% in normal livers. The pattern of biliary leukotriene metabolites, however, was not significantly different. Lowering the pH in the perfusion medium from 7.4 to 7.1 had no effect on uptake, metabolism or biliary elimination of infused [3H]leukotriene C4. The data show that hypoxia and experimental liver injury, but not acidosis, impair hepatic processing of cysteinyl leukotrienes. Thus, in leukotriene-induced shock syndromes, leukotriene elimination and inactivation may be impaired giving rise to a \"vicious circle.\"\r"

Histopathological studies showed evidence of severe Alzheimer type II astrocytosis in the brains of all cirrhotic patients. Saturation-binding assays revealed a single saturable binding site for [3H]-PK 11195 in brain, with affinities in the 2- to 3-nmol/L range. Diazepam was found to be a relatively potent inhibitor of 3H-PK 11195 binding (IC50 = 253 nmol/L), whereas the central benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 displaced 3H-PK 11195 binding with low affinity (IC50 greater than 40 mumols/L). Densities of [3H]-PK 11195 binding sites were found to be increased by 48% (p less than 0.01) and 25% (p less than 0.05) in frontal cortex and caudate nuclei, respectively, from cirrhotic patients. Densities of [3H]-PK 11195 binding sites in frontal cortex from two nonencephalopathic cirrhotic patients were not significantly different from control values. No concomitant changes of affinities of these binding sites were observed. Because it has been suggested that peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors may be localized on mitochondrial membranes and may therefore be involved in cerebral oxidative metabolism, the alterations observed in this study could be of pathophysiological significance in hepatic encephalopathy.\r"

Portal hypertension was caused by cirrhosis in 53 patients and by a prehepatic block in two patients. For 21 of these patients (37%) with portal hypertension, Mallory-Weiss syndrome was the first bleeding manifestation. They numbered 6.2% of the whole population. In the remaining 34 patients (63%) sclerotherapy treatment had been previously performed. No lesions that suggested peptic esophagitis were seen in these 55 patients, although in 25 of them (45.4%) a gastroesophageal reflux was observed. The frequency of bleeding from a Mallory-Weiss tear was significantly higher in patients with advanced liver disease, particularly with Child-Pugh classifications C and B. In patients with prehepatic block, a hemorrhage from a Mallory-Weiss tear may occur, but the frequency is significantly lower than it is in patients with cirrhosis. The bleeding tear was treated by transendoscopic esophageal and cardial wall sclerosis (paravariceal technique) and was, in all cases, successfully controlled. Mallory-Weiss syndrome is observed more frequently in patients with portal hypertension and cirrhosis. Gastroesophageal reflux apparently does not play a major role in the pathogenesis of this syndrome. It may simply be the manifestation of an abnormal gastroesophageal function. Mallory-Weiss syndrome can also be observed as a cause of rebleeding in patients treated with chronic sclerotherapy. Paravariceal endoscopic sclerotherapy is apparently the treatment of first choice to stop hemorrhage.\r"

  ".W": "A familial predisposition to arterial hypertension has recently been suggested as one important component of the susceptibility to diabetic kidney disease. Sodium-lithium countertransport activity, a marker of risk for essential hypertension, has been found to be increased in diabetic patients with overt nephropathy. We have measured red blood cell sodium-lithium counter-transport activity in 36 microalbuminuric insulin-dependent diabetic patients, a group at high risk of progression to clinical nephropathy and cardiovascular disease, and compared it with that of a matched group of 36 normoalbuminuric diabetic patients. Sodium-lithium countertransport was higher in the microalbuminuric (0.43 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38-0.47] mmol/l red blood cells [RBC]/hr) than in the normoalbuminuric diabetic patients (0.29 [0.25-0.33] mmol/l RBC/hr, mean difference 0.14 [0.08-0.20]; p less than 0.0001). Microalbuminuric patients had a higher frequency of parental hypertension than normoalbuminuric diabetic patients (56% vs. 28%, p less than 0.05). Sodium-lithium countertransport was related to mean arterial pressure in the microalbuminuric patients (r = 0.54, p less than 0.001) and to daily insulin requirements in both groups (microalbuminuric patients r = 0.39, p less than 0.05; normoalbuminuric patients r = 0.42, p less than 0.01). In a subset of patients in whom lipoproteins were measured, sodium-lithium countertransport activity was related to total and very low density lipoprotein triglycerides (r = 0.41, p less than 0.05 and r = 0.48, p less than 0.05) and to apolipoprotein B (r = 0.56, p less than 0.05), independently of body mass index, albumin excretion rate, glycemic control, and insulin dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The object of these studies was to investigate whether destruction of the renal medulla in normal rats would alter vascular capacitance. Conscious bromoethylamine-treated rats (n = 15) were compared with control saline-injected rats (n = 12). Mean circulatory filling pressure was measured during a brief circulatory arrest caused by inflation of a right atrial balloon. Blood volume was determined from plasma volume (iodine-125-labeled albumin) and hematocrit. Mean circulatory filling pressure was measured at resting blood volume and after rapid blood volume changes. Vascular compliance was derived from the mean circulatory filling pressure-blood volume curve. The bromoethylamine-treated rats were significantly hypertensive compared with control rats (mean arterial pressure 133 +/- 2 and 114 +/- 3 mm Hg, respectively, p less than 0.001) and had a significant tachycardia (475 +/- 8 and 443 +/- 10 beats/min, respectively, p = 0.02). Blood volume, plasma volume, hematocrit, and sodium excretion were no different. There was no significant difference in mean circulatory filling pressure (6.5 +/- 0.2 and 6.8 +/- 0.2 mm Hg, respectively, p = 0.4) or vascular compliance (3.64 +/- 0.20 and 3.53 +/- 0.12 ml/kg/mm Hg, respectively, p = 0.7). The position of the vascular pressure-volume curve was unchanged indicating no change in vascular capacity. This would suggest that the destruction of renal medullary vasodepressor mechanisms does not result in alterations in vascular capacitance.\r"

Smooth muscle cells from MHS rats exhibited increased growth in culture in comparison with the Milan normotensive strain (MNS) as determined by population doubling times (24.5 +/- 2 and 34.8 +/- 2 hours, n = 4, respectively). Hormone receptor number, evaluated by binding assays using [125I]Ang II, showed no difference in either receptor number or affinity for both cell types. The functional responsiveness of Ang II receptors was evaluated by measuring the activation of phospholipase C, Na(+)-H+ exchange, and cytosolic Ca2+ levels. Phospholipase C activity was determined as tritium-labeled inositol trisphosphate and bisphosphate release before and after 15-second exposure to 10(-7) M Ang II. Ang II-stimulated phospholipase C activity in MNS (p less than 0.02) but not in MHS cells. Na(+)-H+ exchange was measured as the dimethylamiloride-sensitive 22Na+ influx into acid-loaded vascular smooth muscle cells with and without 10(-7) M Ang II. In MNS cells, Ang II significantly stimulated (p less than 0.001) antiporter activity but not in MHS cells, which showed a uniformly blunted response. MHS cells exhibited higher basal cytosolic Ca2+ levels than MNS cells, but Ca2+ rapidly increased in the presence of Ang II in MNS but not in MHS cells. Direct activation of phospholipase C by GTP-gamma-S in permeabilized cells indicated that both strains exhibited similar coupling levels by guanine-nucleotide binding proteins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Among the three regions examined, aortic arch, thoracic aorta, and lower abdominal aorta, the difference in uptake between the normotensive and hypertensive arterial walls was significantly different, p less than or equal to 0.05, p less than or equal to 0.0001, and p less than 0.05, respectively. The uptake by the different regions of the hypertensive arterial wall is consistent with the pathological changes present in these areas. Furthermore, the extent of liposome uptake by the aortic wall is strongly correlated with the height of the blood pressure (r = 0.85, p = 0.001, n = 11). We conclude that neutral small unilamellar liposomes can be used to carry agents into the arterial wall in vivo in the study of hypertensive vascular disease and could be especially useful for the delivery of pharmacologically or biologically active agents that would otherwise be inactivated within the circulation or are impermeable to the arterial wall.\r"

  ".W": "There is controversy as to whether platelet intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i) is increased in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) as compared with Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Discrepant results may be due to methodological problems including platelet activation during the collection process and leakage of intracellular dye used for [Ca2+]i measurement. To provide further insight into this problem, [Ca2+]i was estimated in fura-2-loaded platelets isolated from eight SHR and seven WKY rats at 12-14 weeks of age by using a two-syringe blood collection method and a correction method for fura-2 leakage. Basal [Ca2+]i was higher in SHR than in WKY rats (61.6 +/- 5.6 vs. 54.0 +/- 3.9 nM, p less than 0.02). However, the difference disappeared when a correction for fura-2 leakage was not used (109.7 +/- 18.4 vs. 94.9 +/- 9.2 nM, p less than 0.1). Thus, differences in [Ca2+]i between SHR and WKY rats may be obscured if dye leakage from platelets is not taken into account. Thrombin (0.1 units/ml) induced a rise in [Ca2+]i that was greater in SHR than WKY rats, both in the presence (491.4 +/- 31.6 vs. 377.5 +/- 21.7 nM, p less than 0.002) and absence (264.9 +/- 33.6 vs. 228.2 +/- 30.1 nM, p less than 0.05) of calcium in the media. These results indicate that thrombin-stimulated calcium influx as well as discharge of calcium from intracellular stores is increased in SHR platelets. Thus, under both basal and stimulated conditions, platelet calcium handling is abnormal in the SHR.\r"

High salt induced hypertension in young and adult but not in old DS rats although red blood cell Na+ was slightly increased in all age groups of DS rats fed a high salt diet. The kinetic parameters of the Na(+)-K+ pump were similar in DS and DR rats fed a low salt diet. Ouabain-sensitive transport rates were not suppressed in erythrocytes of salt hypertensive Dahl rats. Maximal velocities of the Na(+)-K+ pump (related to Na+i) decreased significantly with age in all groups except in DS rats fed a high salt diet. This was compensated by an age-dependent increase in the affinity for Na+i so that no substantial differences in transport rates between young and old rats were seen at physiological cell Na+ and plasma K+ levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The reduction in blood pressure to normotensive levels within 3 hours of unclipping the one-kidney, one clip Goldblatt hypertensive rat has been attributed to the release of potent blood pressure-lowering lipids, one of which is thought to be identical to platelet activating factor. The specific platelet activating factor receptor antagonist WEB 2086 was infused intravenously into hypertensive one-kidney, one clip rats, and the mean arterial blood pressure changes after unclipping were examined. Before infusion, blocking doses of WEB 2086 were confirmed to effectively abolish the fall in blood pressure induced by exogenous platelet activating factor. Serotonin release in response to exogenous platelet activating factor was also inhibited in platelets preincubated with plasma from rats infused with the antagonist. Hypertensive rats were given a bolus blocking dose of WEB 2086 (5 mg/kg i.v.) and the same dose by infusion (5 mg/kg/hr i.v.) before they were unclipped. A control group was given a bolus volume of saline and infused with saline before unclipping. In WEB 2086-treated rats, blood pressure fell from a baseline mean of 181 +/- 13.0 to 125 +/- 23 mm Hg after 4 hours, a fall of 28%. Saline-treated rats fell from a mean of 194 +/- 23 to 127 +/- 25 mm Hg (33%). There was no significant difference in the blood pressure fall between the two groups. Therefore, platelet activating factor is unlikely to be responsible for the restoration of normal blood pressure after unclipping the Goldblatt hypertensive rat. We attribute the fall in blood pressure to other presently unidentified renomedullary lipids.\r"

Intrarenal infusions of either NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (inhibitor of endothelium-derived relaxing factor formation), or L-arginine (precursor of endothelium-derived relaxing factor formation) did not modify basal levels of those parameters. However, the infusion of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine inhibited the acetylcholine-induced increases in renal blood flow and diuresis without affecting natriuresis, which increased significantly. The infusion of L-arginine failed to further enhance hemodynamic and excretory effects elicited by acetylcholine. The concomitant infusion of L-arginine and NG-monomethyl-L-arginine did not change renal blood flow, urine flow, or sodium excretion rate. L-Arginine administration prevented the inhibitory effect of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine on acetylcholine-induced renal vasodilatation and diuresis. Glomerular filtration rate and mean arterial pressure did not change throughout the experiment. The results indicate that the vasodilatory and diuretic responses to intrarenal acetylcholine in meclofenamate-treated dogs are largely dependent on endothelium-derived relaxing factor.\r"

Plasma anti-Xa activity during hemodialysis was highest in regimen; d) and significantly lower when heparin was used. Mean beta-thromboglobulin concentrations changed to the same extent in the three groups. Plasma platelet factor 4 concentrations were higher after the use of heparin. The extracorporeal circuit was maintained patent in all groups; the volume of blood retained in the dialyzers did not differ markedly.

Eighteen non-transfused RDT patients with hematocrit less than 26% were treated with rEPO to raise the HCT to 30-35%; then the dose was individually adjusted to maintain the HCT. The mean HCT rose from 22.3% to 31.5%. Ten patients received iron substitution before rEPO. During rEPO therapy five further patients had to be supplemented with iron; all patients needed an increase in the oral iron doses and three required i.v. iron. During the correction phase mean serum ferritin dropped from 203 micrograms/l to a minimum of 71 micrograms/l and was 102 micrograms/l after six months. Serum iron and TIBC changed only moderately. It thus appears that iron demand rises markedly during rEPO therapy, requiring iron substitution in most patients. Serum ferritin is the most sensitive parameter for development of iron deficiency.\r"

Forty patients, 24 women and 16 men, were treated by PE and observed for 1-3, 3-12 and over 12 months. Immunological, biological and clinical course and any undesirable side effects were evaluated using a detailed questionnaire. Concomitant therapies were reported and most frequently consisted of corticosteroids, colchicine, factor XIII or vasodilators (nifedipine, captopril). The therapeutic effectiveness of PE was assessed on the basis of improvements in cutaneous, digestive, joint, muscular, lung, cardiovascular and renal lesions. Our findings confirmed the effectiveness of short-term PE on scleroderma (52% of the patients improved during the first 3 months). However, this improvement was transient (5% improvement between 3 and 12 months and only 2.5% over 12 months) and limited to the cutaneous and muscular lesions. Thus, PE cannot be recommended for the treatment of progressive systemic sclerosis.\r"

PTH levels were higher in CRF patients undergoing hemodialysis therapy (hemodialysis patients) by all three methods. However, PTH levels measured only by i-PTH assay and intact PTH assay were significantly higher in patients with CRF who were not on dialysis (non-dialyzed CRF patients). PTH levels were above normal when creatinine clearance was below 45 ml/min in the intact PTH assay and 66 ml/min in the i-PTH assay. I-PTH levels were well correlated with the severity of osteitis fibrosa evaluated by the degree of periosteal resorption in the digits of hemodialysis patients. Since special handling of the sample is required for the intact PTH assay, i-PTH assay is the most suitable method for diagnosing secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with CRF.\r"

Ultrafiltration is step-wise decreased (a) or switched on and off (b) accordingly. Blood volume decrease with constant ultrafiltration is compared with method (a) and (b) in 4 stable haemodialysis patients. Constant ultrafiltration rate and the same total amount of ultrafiltrate causes a nearly 3% (mean) greater volume reduction as compared with method (a) and (b).

In order to plot the \"mental deterioration curve\" of patients on a hemodialysis program, the present study was made on 62 patients in a general hospital in Spain. The possible repercussions of treatment of kidney disease on intellectual (Weschler's Adult Intelligence Scale-WAIS test) and perceptive (Benton test) capacity were investigated. Samples were grouped according to whether they had been on dialysis for up to four years (less than 4) or more than four years (greater than 4). The WAIS test for the greater than 4 group indicated a lower I.Q. These results indicated that it was after four years on dialysis that greater negative effects began to be seen in perceptive-intellectual capacity. The Benton test indicated that time on hemodialysis adversely affected the patient's capacities. A sharp decline was seen particularly between two and four years in the less than 4 group, suggesting that patients' mental conditions vary with time on dialysis but that their resources and capacities are still fairly untroubled by the treatment in the first two years. In the light of these findings, the deterioration curve should be taken into account when planning kidney transplant, in order to take advantage of the initial period if possible.\r"

In such a device, the cells would have to exhibit transport properties when exposed to uremic plasma. To test the feasibility of a bioartificial kidney, LLC-PK1 cells derived from the proximal tubule were grown to confluence on microporous, cellulose nitrate membranes and transepithelial transport of inulin, glucose and tetraethylammonium (TEA) was investigated with standard tissue culture medium and with the hemofiltrate obtained from a uremic patient. Inulin, which is neither reabsorbed nor secreted by renal epithelial cells, did not diffuse through the LLC-PK1 monolayer in either tissue culture fluid or hemofiltrate. Glucose was preferentially reabsorbed and TEA was preferentially secreted in both media. In hemofiltrate, LLC-PK1 cells reabsorbed glucose at the same rate as in tissue culture fluid but secreted TEA at a significantly higher rate. This difference was related to the pH of the fluids since it was abolished by correction to the same pH value. For both solutes, the passive transepithelial leakage was significantly lower in hemofiltrate. We conclude that LLC-PK1 cells retain their reabsorbtive and secretory transport characteristics under uremic conditions.\r"

MP boluses (30 mg/kg) were given to 10 consenting patients suffering from acute renal failure, immediately before blood started to circulate through a hollow-fiber Cuprophan dialyzer. To avoid drug loss through the dialyzer membrane, dialysate flow was withheld during the first hour of treatment and ultrafiltration was kept near zero (sham dialysis). Control procedures were carried out in a similar way, without MP. MP concentration, differential WBC count and anaphylotoxin C5a were serially measured during the procedures. MP pharmacokinetics was evaluated in six other uremic patients off dialysis. As shown by similar C5a levels in dialyzer effluent blood, complement cascade was activated by Cuprophan to a comparable degree whether or not patients received MP. Neutrophil count dropped 68% during the control procedure and 54% during sham dialysis preceded by MP (95% confidence interval of the difference, 1.97-27.2). Sham dialysis did not apparently influence serum MP levels, as shown by similar peak values in patients undergoing sham dialysis (203 micrograms/ml +/- SEM 33) and in patients off dialysis (177 micrograms/ml +/- 42). In vitro aggregometry showed that the uremic milieu does not interfere with the antiaggregating effect of MP. Our results show that MP at the dosage of 30 mg/kg does not affect complement-mediated granulocytopenia in any important way.\r"

The method utilizes the diffusion of drugs from the blood through the peritoneal membrane to the peritoneal cavity if administered intravenously (IV) and perorally (PO) and in the opposite direction if applied intraperitoneally (IP). The present work uses an open, two-compartment pharmacokinetic model reversibly linked with the compartment representing the peritoneal cavity and an analog-hybrid computer to simulate drug levels in sampled and unsampled compartments under conditions of various routes of administration (IV, IP and sequential IV, IP and PO) and different clinical status (presence and absence of peritonitis). The drug chosen for simulation was ciprofloxacin (CIP), a new synthetic antibacterial agent of the 4-quinolone group. Eight patients were included in the study, and CIP concentrations in plasma and dialysate were obtained by HPLC analysis to assess the reliability of the model and the efficiency of the sequential dosing scheme. CIP plasma and dialysate levels were adequate for the majority of microbes causing CAPD peritonitis. The proposed regimen was efficient in 85% of cases.\r"

Blood passed first through a cuprophan dialyzer and then through AN69 dialyzers that were not in contact with dialysis fluid. Plasma C3a and C5a were measured in samples taken from the afferent and efferent blood lines of the acrylonitrile dialyzers at 15, 60 and 240 min. Plasma C3a concentrations decreased significantly in blood that had passed through AN69 dialyzers. This decrease, indicating membrane adsorption, was maximal (by 65% in AN69HF and by 59% in AN69P) at 15 min and minimal (by 53% in AN69HF and by 18% in AN69P) at 240 min. The decrease in plasma C5a concentrations was smaller and significant throughout HD only with AN69HF. The amount of C3a adsorbed was at least 45,000 micrograms in AN69HF and 18,000 micrograms in AN69P. These findings demonstrate that acrylonitrile dialyzers adsorb more C3a and C5a than they produce. This membrane adsorption may explain why the increase of plasma C3a and C5a is inhibited during HD.\r"

  ".W": "L-histidine ammonia-lyase (histidase) was encapsulated within cellulose nitrate artificial cells, and its kinetic parameters were evaluated. Microencapsulated histidase had an apparent activity of histidase in solution. Encapsulation did not alter the Km of histidase. The Km of histidase solution and the Km apparent of micro-encapsulated histidase were both 20 mM. Encapsulation of histidase resulted in increased stability of enzymatic activity at storage temperatures of 4 degrees C and 37 degrees C. At 37 degrees C histidase solution reached 50% of its original activity after 9.5 days of storage, while microencapsulated histidase reached the same level after 15 days. At 4 degrees C histidase solution had 63% of its original activity after 21 days of storage, while encapsulated histidase had 95%. In vitro experiments to evaluate the feasibility of microencapsulated histidase for possible experimental therapy in histidinemia were carried out. These experiments evaluated the effectiveness of encapsulated histidase in depleting histidine. Three different volume ratios of histidase loaded artificial cells to substrate solution were tested. A ratio of 1: 100 allowed 25% histidine depletion after 120 hours. A 1: 50 ratio allowed 35% histidine depletion after 72 hours. A 1: 25 ratio allowed 40% histidine depletion after 24 hours (Int J Artif Organs 1990; 13: 189-95).\r"

To determine the mechanism producing these airway changes and assuming that changes in the trachealis muscle reflect changes in muscle of the entire tracheobronchial tree, we examined the in vitro smooth muscle mechanics and morphometric parameters of tracheae from guinea pigs demonstrating hyperresponsiveness in vivo vs. tracheae from control guinea pigs. No differences between these groups were found in luminal volume at zero transmural pressure, passive pressure-volume characteristics, or area of airway wall. Smooth muscle areas were slightly less in tracheae from hyperresponsive guinea pigs. Tracheae from hyperresponsive guinea pigs had both significantly increased isovolumetric force generation and isobaric shortening compared with tracheae from controls when evaluated over the range of transmural pressures from -40 to 40 cmH2O. We conclude that the in vivo airway hyperresponsiveness induced with repeated antigen challenge is associated with both increased force generation and shortening of tracheal smooth muscle without increased muscle mass, suggesting enhanced contractile activity.\r"

Intravenous administration of 14, 15-[3H]LTC4 (0.5 microCi/kg) revealed a rapid clearance from the circulation (half time = 90 s). Circulatory metabolism was apparent, with early formation (within 1 min) of LTD4 and LTE4 shown by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Urinary 3H excretion comprised 10% of the original dose. [3H]LTE4 (characterized by coelution with authentic standards during RP-HPLC analysis) was observed in early urine samples. By use of a sensitive and specific RP-HPLC radioimmunoassay analysis, immunoreactive material coeluting with LTE4 was detected in urine from allergic sheep. Excretion of this material was significantly increased during antigen-induced acute bronchoconstriction in eight conscious allergic sheep [preantigen, 65.70 +/- 24.27 (SE) pg; 0-1 h postantigen, 208.00 +/- 71.10 pg, P less than 0.05], but not during late responses. However, total postantigen LTE4 excretion (37.8 - 956.1 pg/8 h) was highly correlated (r = 0.976, P less than 0.001) with the severity of bronchoconstriction (445.3 - 2,409.1% specific pulmonary resistance per hour) assessed by measurement of the area under the curve of pulmonary function plotted against time. These findings represent an important demonstration of in vivo allergen-induced peptide LT generation in a physiologically characterized animal model of prolonged allergic bronchoconstriction and further substantiate an important role for LT in this model of allergic asthma.\r"

J. Appl. Physiol. 54: 840-851, 1983). In anesthetized dogs, both a systemic vein (I-V) infusion and systemic artery (I-A) infusion of L-lactic acid were studied to control for potential effects of factors other than pH on PVR. During progressive I-A infusion (n = 9) to a pH of 6.94 +/- 0.06 there was no significant change in PVR or its distribution. In contrast, I-V infusion (n = 9) to a pH of 7.08 +/- 0.09 increased median PVR from 3.6 to 21.7 mmHg.1(-1).min (P less than 0.001), due to an increase in middle segment resistance (0.0-15.4 mmHg.1(-1).min, P less than 0.02). Examination by light and electron microscopy demonstrated pulmonary capillary obstruction with hemolyzed erythrocyte (RBC) membranes with I-V infusion, but representative I-A animals did not demonstrate these findings. Conceivably, the systemic vascular bed filtered the fragmented RBC membranes in the I-A model, but this microvascular obstruction with altered RBCs and RBC fragments caused the pulmonary hypertension observed in the I-V infusion. We conclude that lactic acidosis does not increase pulmonary vascular tone in dogs, a finding compatible with most previous studies in which observed increases in PVR may be attributed to other effects from I-V acid infusion on circulating blood elements.\r"

On 2 separate days (48 h apart) each SEN and MAT animal was exposed to an ambient temperature (Ta) of 42 degrees C (relative humidity 20%) until a Tc of 41 degrees C was attained and then cooled at a Ta of 26 degrees C until Tc returned to the initial control level.

The rate of Tc change during heating was 63% greater (0.070 +/- 0.005 vs. 0.043 +/- 0.004 degrees C/min, P less than 0.05) and the time to 41 degrees C reduced by 36% (54 +/- 6 vs. 85 +/- 10 min, P less than 0.05) in MAT vs. SEN animals during the first exposure, although the cooling rate was slower in the MAT (0.048 +/- 0.004 degrees C/min) vs. SEN (0.062 +/- 0.006 degrees C/min) animals (P less than 0.05). The heating rate was unchanged in MAT animals between trials 1 and 2. However, SEN animals had a 95% increase in heating rate in trial 2 compared with trial 1 (P less than 0.05), and the corresponding time to 41 degrees C was decreased by 44% (P less than 0.05). As a result, rate of heating and time to 41 degrees C were similar in the two groups during trial 2. The cooling rate was similar between trials within each group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this study, orocecal transit during mild exercise was measured in 21 women by detecting a rise in expired H2 after ingestion of 20 g lactulose in a 350-ml (360 kcal) liquid meal. Motilin, gastrin, and cortisol were measured in peripheral venous blood when, as evidenced by a breath H2 rise, the first portion of the meal arrived at the cecum. Comparison was made between seated rest and a treadmill walk at 5.6 km/h up a 2% grade. The walk predictably elevated heart rate, O2 uptake, and rectal temperature and also reduced transit time from 98 min at rest to 75 min during exercise (P less than 0.001). Faster transit in exercise was associated with a significant rise in cortisol, while gastrin and motilin levels were both unchanged. In conclusion, in women mild concurrent exercise accelerates orocecal transit rate of at least the first portion of nonabsorbable carbohydrate in a liquid meal. Although the mechanism for the effect remains unknown, it may be secondary to some aspect of the stress response to physical activity.\r"

Oleic acid (2-20 mg.kg-1.h-1), LY171883 [leukotriene (LT) D4/LTE4 receptor antagonist, 10 mg/kg + 1 mg.kg-1.h-1] + oleic acid (10 mg.kg-1. h-1), or triolein (20 mg.kg-1.h-1) were infused intravenously into anesthetized pigs. Treatment with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor was designed to possibly enhance LT release. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid concentrations of LTB4, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 were measured by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay. Oleic acid caused dose-related hypoxemia and pulmonary hypertension and increased pulmonary vascular resistance, lung water, and alveolar-capillary membrane permeability. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid levels of LTB4, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 showed no significant changes in oleic acid- or indomethacin + oleic acid-treated pigs, compared with triolein-treated controls. Indomethacin modestly attenuated the oleic acid-induced hypoxemia and the early increases (i.e., 0-0.5 h) in mean pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance. In contrast, LY171883 provided no protection against any oleic acid-induced cardiopulmonary effect (measured or calculated). We conclude that LTs are not likely to be important mediators of oleic acid-induced lung injury in the pig.\r"

After the dive, spinal cord decompression sickness was detected by recording a reduced amplitude of the somatosensory evoked potential compared with predive base-line values. After the diagnosis of decompression sickness and rapid perfusion fixation of the animal, the spinal cord was removed and examined histologically. Numerous space-occupying lesions (SOL) that disrupted the tissue architecture were found in each cord, mainly in the white matter. The size and distribution of the SOL were determined using computerized morphometry. Although SOL occupied less than 0.5% of the white matter volume, we tested a number of algorithms to assess whether the SOL may have been directly involved in the loss of spinal cord function that followed the dive. We determined that the loss of somatosensory evoked potential amplitude may be attributed to the SOL if 30-100% of the spinal cord fibers that they displaced were rendered nonconducting. A number of possible mechanisms by which SOL may interfere with spinal nerve conduction are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Shifts in the power spectrum of the diaphragm EMG to lower frequencies may occur in the presence of fatiguing inspiratory flow-resistive loads (IRL). However, such a shift of the centroid frequency (fc) could follow a reduction in central output through a differential reduction in end-inspiratory high-frequency power (HFP). In unanesthetized goats, we tested the hypothesis that activation of the endogenous opioid system by IRL would differentially reduce central respiratory output, causing a reduction in fc. IRL was imposed for 180 min after which naloxone (0.1 mg/kg, NLX) was given. fc was computed from the power spectral density estimated by the Welch method. IRL reduced fc from 148.0 +/- 9.8 (SE) Hz at base line to 141.1 +/- 8.9 Hz or to 95.5 +/- 1.3% of base line by 180 min (both P less than 0.05). NLX increased fc to 148.9 +/- 9.9 Hz or to 100.6 +/- 1.1% of base line (both P less than 0.05). The decline in fc during IRL was found to be the result of a reduction in HFP, predominantly toward the end of inspiration. The reversibility of this fc shift with NLX suggests a central mechanism consequent to elaboration of endogenous opioids and not a peripheral (muscular) event consequent to muscle fatigue.\r"

Several groups have speculated that this improvement results from preferential edema accumulation in the dorsal lung regions and redistribution of perfusion away from these regions when the patients are turned to the prone position. We used radiolabeled microspheres to measure the regional distribution of perfusion (Qr) to the dorsal, mid, and ventral lungs of eight dogs in vivo in the supine and prone positions, before and after inducing acute lung injury with OA, and correlated the Qr observed after injury with the degree of regional extravascular lung water (EVLWr). Before OA, Qr increased along the gravitational gradient when the animals were supine but was more uniformly distributed when they were prone. After OA, Qr again followed a gravitational gradient when the animals were supine but was preferentially distributed to the nondependent regions when they were prone. EVLWr was similar in all regions, regardless of whether OA was injected when the animals were supine or prone. The gravitational Qr gradient is markedly reduced in the prone position, both before and after lung injury. The prone position-induced improvement in oxygenation is not the result of redistribution of Qr away from areas in which edema preferentially develops.\r"

VO2 was measured breath by breath during 6 min of rest before exercise, a progressive maximal cycle ergometer test, and 15 min of recovery in five McArdle's patients, six age-matched control subjects, and six maximal O2 consumption- (VO2 max) matched control subjects. The McArdle's patients' ventilatory threshold occurred at the same relative exercise intensity [71 +/- 7% (SD) VO2max] as in the control groups (60 +/- 13 and 70 +/- 10% VO2max) despite no increase and a 20% decrease in the McArdle's patients' arterialized blood lactate and H+ levels, respectively. The recovery VO2 responses of all three groups were better fit by a two-, than a one-, component exponential model, and the parameters of the slow component of the recovery VO2 response were the same in the three groups. The presence of the same slow component of the recovery VO2 response in the McArdle's patients and the control subjects, despite the lack of an increase in blood lactate or H+ levels during maximal exercise and recovery in the patients, provides evidence that this portion of the recovery VO2 response is not the result of a lactacid mechanism. In addition, it appears that the hyperventilation that accompanies high-intensity exercise may be the result of some mechanism other than acidosis or lung CO2 flux.\r"

Total CW resistance decreased sharply as frequency rose to 3-4 Hz and remained relatively constant at higher frequencies. Total CW reactance became less negative with increasing frequency but showed no tendency to change sign. Above 2 Hz, diameters measured at different locations changed asynchronously between and within the rib cage and abdomen. \"Local pathway impedances\" (ratios of esophageal or gastric pressure to a rate of diameter change) showed frequency dependence similar to that of the total CW less than 3 Hz. Local pathway impedances increased during contraction of respiratory muscles acting on the pathway. We conclude that 1) total CW behavior is mainly a reflection of its individual local properties at less than or equal to 3 Hz, 2) local impedances within the rib cage or within the abdomen can change independently in some situations, and 3) asynchronies that develop within the CW during forcing greater than 3 Hz suggest that two compartments may be insufficient to describe CW properties from impedance measurements.\r"

It has caused pulmonary hypertension in calves, and we found it caused pulmonary hypertension in sheep as well. To investigate the mechanism of pulmonary hypertension with propylene glycol, we injected an average loading dose of 30% propylene glycol (0.5 ml/kg) into adult sheep, which was followed by a rise in thromboxane levels (P less than 0.05) in systemic arterial plasma and lung lymph and by a dramatic increase in pulmonary arterial pressure (17 +/- 1 to 35 +/- 4 mmHg, P less than 0.05) and a fall in cardiac output (2.7 +/- 0.5 to 1 +/- 0.2 l/min). Indomethacin pretreatment blocked the rise in thromboxane in lung lymph and arterial plasma and substantially, although not entirely, blocked the rise in pulmonary arterial pressure. Pulmonary intravascular macrophages (PIMS), which are present in sheep and calves, can release thromboxane in response to a stimulus. To test whether PIMS might be the source of the thromboxane and pulmonary hypertension, we injected propylene glycol into guinea pigs and dogs, which are reported to have no PIMS, as well as into newborn lambs, which are not believed to develop many PIMS until the 2nd wk of life. In dogs and guinea pigs there was no response to propylene glycol. In lambs there was a rise in pulmonary vascular resistance but significantly less than in adult sheep; indomethacin blocked this response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Mucociliary transport in the airways is governed by the interaction between ciliary activity and the depth and rheological properties of the liquids (mucus) covering the epithelial surface. A change in one of these parameters may not predict the direction and magnitude of a concomitant change in mucociliary transport. We therefore determined the effects of physiological (neurotransmitters) and pathological (inflammatory mediators) stimuli on ciliary beat frequency (CBF), surface liquid velocity (SLV), surface liquid depth (SLD), and viscoelasticity of mucus in pieces of sheep trachea (n = 5 for each treatment) mounted in a chamber such that the submucosal side was bathed with Krebs-Henseleit perfusate (KH) and the luminal side was exposed to conditioned air. SLV, SLD, and CBF were measured with a microscope provided with an electronic micrometer and strobe light. Apparent viscosity and shear elastic modulus were measured with a microcapillary method using mucus collected at the downstream end of the preparation. Control CBF, SLV, and SLD were 11.6 +/- 0.4 (SE) Hz, 91 +/- 8 micron/s, and 33 +/- 5 microns, respectively, at base line and did not change during KH perfusion for 100 min. Perfusion with both acetylcholine and epinephrine (10(-5) to 10(-3) M) produced concentration-dependent increases in mean CBF (maximum increases at 10(-3) M of 16 and 9%, P less than 0.05), whereas only acetylcholine increased mean SLV (+56% at 10(-3) M, P less than 0.05). Perfusion with platelet-activating factor (10(-7) to 10(-5) M) decreased both mean CBF and SLV in a dose-dependent fashion (-6 and -63% at 10(-5) M, P less than 0.05), whereas antigen perfusion (1:60 dilution) increased mean CBF (+10%, P less than 0.05) but decreased SLV (-47%, P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To partition clearance between these areas we determined the bronchial branching pattern, the anatomical sites of particle deposition, and subsequent clearance in the same animal. Using a 2.85-microns particle tagged with 57Co for inhalation and deposition in the sheep lung, we followed clearance via a series of computer-stored gamma-scintillation lung images. The same sheep was reinhaled, and the particle distributions for both inhalations were compared. After the animals were killed, the bronchial branching pattern and length of the bronchial tree were documented. The number of particles depositing in all bronchi down to 1 mm diam was determined by scintillation counting, and the number in respiratory bronchioles and alveoli was microscopically counted. We conclude that particles deposited in bronchi greater than or equal to 1 mm diam clear in 2-4 h postdeposition. Bronchi distal to 1-mm-diam bronchi and alveoli clear evenly over 72 h, and the number of particles equal to the tracheobronchial deposition cleared after 45 h.\r"

The suppression of accessory respiratory muscle activity has been investigated and a role for sleep-disordered breathing hypothesized, but the suppression of diaphragmatic activity has rarely been considered. We hypothesized that the activity of the diaphragm was suppressed by an area of the dorsolateral pons during REMS. Lesions in this region have previously been shown to abolish the atonia of REMS. The diaphragmatic electromyogram (EMG) activity was analyzed in five naturally sleeping cats before and after pontine lesions leading to REMS without atonia. Although respiratory timing parameters were not altered by the lesion, the inspiratory rate of rise was significantly increased in all cats, and the brief pauses (40-100 ms) in the diaphragmatic EMG normally seen in REMS were virtually abolished. We conclude that the dorsolateral pons has a role in suppressing diaphragmatic activation during REMS. This suppression affects the average rate of rise of diaphragmatic activity and also leads to brief intermittent complete cessation of ongoing muscle activity. These decrements in diaphragm activity could jeopardize ventilation during REMS.\r"

In 11 normal resting subjects, VO2rb calculated with end-tidal sampling overestimated VO2ss by 16 +/- 15% (SD) (P less than 0.003). This error was proportional to the increase in pulse rate during rebreathing, so that pulse-corrected VO2rb slightly underestimated VO2ss by 2.1 +/- 12.2% (P = 0.66) in the six subjects who rebreathed 28% O2 in the rebreathing bag but significantly underestimated VO2ss by 7.5 +/- 6.7% (P less than 0.04) in the six subjects who rebreathed 21% O2 in the rebreathing bag. During exercise, VO2rb underestimated VO2ss by 4 +/- 12% (P less than 0.001) and by 7 +/- 6% at O2 consumptions greater than 2,000 ml/min if O2 in the rebreathing bag was kept above 20% throughout rebreathing. We found that VO2rb calculated with end-tidal gas concentrations underestimated VO2ss by 1-43% in patients with moderate-to-severe obstructive lung disease, with even greater errors when mixed expired samples were used. The magnitude of the discrepancy correlated poorly with abnormalities in standard pulmonary function tests. Based on these data, VO2rb closely approximates VO2ss in normal subjects, provided hypoxia during rebreathing is avoided and cardiac acceleration from rebreathing is taken into account during resting measurement.\r"

Six subjects performed light and heavy rhythmic forearm exercise. Trials were conducted with the subjects supine and standing. Forearm blood flow (FBF, plethysmography) and skin blood flow (laser Doppler) were measured during brief pauses in the contractions. Arterial blood pressure and heart rate were also measured. During the first 6 min of light exercise, blood flow was similar in the supine and standing positions (approximately 15 ml.min-1.100 ml-1); from minutes 7 to 20 FBF was approximately 3-7 ml.min-1.100 ml-1 less in the standing position (P less than 0.05). When 5 min of heavy exercise immediately followed the light exercise, FBF was approximately 30-35 ml.min-1.100 ml-1 in the supine position. These values were approximately 8-12 ml.min-1.100 ml-1 greater than those observed in the upright position (P less than 0.05). When light exercise did not precede 8 min of heavy exercise, the blood flow at the end of minute 1 was similar in the supine and standing positions but was approximately 6-9 ml.min-1.100 ml-1 lower in the standing position during minutes 2-8. Heart rate was always approximately 10-20 beats higher in the upright position (P less than 0.05). Forearm skin blood flow and mean arterial pressure were similar in the two positions, indicating that the changes in FBF resulted from differences in the caliber of the resistance vessels in the forearm muscles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Sigmoidal baroreflex response relationships were provoked with ramped neck pressure-suction sequences comprising pressure elevations to 40 mmHg followed by serial R-wave-triggered 15-mmHg reductions to -65 mmHg. Each R-R interval was plotted as a function of systolic pressure minus the neck chamber pressure applied during the interval. Compared with control measurements, base-line R-R intervals and the minimum, maximum, range, and maximum slope of the R-R interval-carotid pressure relationships were reduced (P less than 0.05) from bed rest day 12 through recovery day 5. Baroreflex slopes were reduced more in four subjects who fainted during standing after bed rest than in six subjects who did not faint (-1.8 +/- 0.7 vs. -0.3 +/- 0.3 ms/mmHg, P less than 0.05). There was a significant linear correlation (r = 0.70, P less than 0.05) between changes of baroreflex slopes from before bed rest to bed rest day 25 and changes of systolic blood pressure during standing after bed rest. Although plasma volume declined by approximately 15% (P less than 0.05), there was no significant correlation between reductions of plasma volume and changes of baroreflex responses. There were no significant changes of before and after plasma norepinephrine or epinephrine levels before and after bed rest during supine rest or sitting.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The respiratory and mean arterial pressure (MAP) responses to slow ramp pressure stimulation of carotid baroreceptors were compared in pentobarbital-anesthetized vagotomized dogs breathing 100% O2. Carotid sinus pressure (CSP) was raised from 50 (control) to 220 mmHg and then returned to control as linear ramps (+/- 1 mmHg/s) in isolated sinuses. MAP, heart rate (HR), ventilation (VE), frequency (f), and tidal volume (VT) were expressed as percent of control. The maximum difference between responses to positive and negative ramps at a given CSP (MAX) and the average difference (AVG) served as indicators of the hysteresis for each response. In 27 dogs MAP changed monotonically with varying CSP with insignificant (P = 0.27, MAX) or barely significant (P = 0.03, AVG) hysteresis, monotonic function being one that is continuously nondecreasing or continuously nonincreasing. Similar responses were obtained for HR. VE decreased as CSP increased, but the change was not monotonic. During negative ramp, VE increased back to control with an overshoot. Hysteresis for VE was pronounced (P less than 0.0001, both measures). The VE response was primarily determined by f; VT increased with CSP. To eliminate secondary respiratory effects due to alterations in MAP, in seven dogs similar experiments were performed after ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium. Hysteresis in VE and f persisted. To assess the role of changing arterial PCO2 (PaCO2) on VE, the CSP was held constant (after a ramp rise) at 140, 150, or 180 mmHg before reducing it at -1 mmHg/s to 50 mmHg; however, a significant hysteresis in VE was still observed. Further experiments, to eliminate secondary reflexes due to altered PaCO2, were performed in seven dogs after ganglionic blockade and paralysis with Flaxedil, with phrenic nerve activity as an indicator of (\"neural\") respiration. The hysteresis in VE and f were no longer significant. In summary, the results indicate that 1) slow ramp carotid baroreceptor stimulation elicits both VE and cardiovascular responses, the VE response showing a dramatically higher hysteresis than the cardiovascular responses; 2) the ventilatory hysteresis is partially explained by the secondary changes in PaCO2 and perhaps by cardiovascular variables; and 3) the central processing of the baroventilatory reflex appears to be rate sensitive at a slower rate of pressure change than that which causes rate sensitivity in the baropressure reflex.\r"

The purpose of this study was to chronically stimulate skeletal muscle electrically to transform the biochemical capacities of the three major subcellular systems (i.e., metabolic, calcium regulating, and contractile) to resemble those of heart muscle. The latissimus dorsi muscle (LDM) of mongrel dogs weighing 22-27 kg was stimulated via the thoracodorsal nerve at 2 Hz for 6-8 wk. This stimulation protocol reduced the phosphorylase (glycogenolytic) and phosphofructokinase (glycolytic) activities by 70%. The aerobic (citrate synthase activity) and fatty acid oxidative (3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity) capacities were not significantly increased by chronic stimulation and remained at about one-fourth those in the canine heart. The calcium-dependent sarcoplasmic reticulum adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase) activity in the microsomal fraction, which was sixfold greater in the nonstimulated LDM than in the heart, was reduced by electrical stimulation to a level similar to that of the dog heart. The contractile capacity was evaluated by determining the percentage of types I and II fibers, the myofibrillar ATPase activity, and the proportion of myosin isoforms. The transformed muscle was comprised of 93 +/- 2% type I fibers, a myofibrillar ATPase activity similar to that in heart with primarily a slow-twitch muscle myosin isoform. In conclusion, electrical stimulation of canine LDM at 2 Hz for 6-8 wk resulted in two of the three biochemical systems, which confer physiological expression and fatigue resistance to muscle being transformed to resemble those of the myocardium.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of the present study was to determine whether the diaphragm, like limb muscles, generates high levels of intramuscular pressure during contraction. Studies were performed on in situ diaphragm strips in 15 dogs. An isometric force transducer was used to measure strip tension, and intramuscular pressure was assessed using both wick and balloon catheter techniques. Tension and intramuscular pressures were recorded during a series of graded contractions elicited by electrically stimulating strips via intramuscular electrodes. Similar techniques were used to record the tension and intramuscular pressures developed during graded contractions of a limb muscle, the vastus medialis. Intramuscular pressure was linearly related to tension in both the diaphragm and vastus medialis. However, for a given level of tension development, vastus medialis pressures were two- to threefold greater than those developed within the diaphragm. For example, at a tension of 2 kg/cm2 vastus medialis and diaphragm intramuscular pressures were 105 +/- 11 and 25 +/- 4 mmHg, respectively, when assessed with wick catheters, and were 159 +/- 11 and 48 +/- 5 mmHg, respectively, when assessed by the balloon catheter technique. These differences may reflect the fact that thick rounded muscles, like the vastus, may be capable of generating higher intramuscular pressures than the thin sheetlike diaphragm. To determine whether intradiaphragmatic pressure swings were large enough to explain the vascular compression produced by contraction, we measured phrenic arterial impedance during contraction in nine animals. In these animals the inferior phrenic artery was cannulated and pump perfused at a constant flow rate. With contraction, phrenic arterial pressure rose; i.e., phrenic arterial impedance increased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The response of the multibranched model is described in the companion article (J. Appl. Physiol. 68: 1514-1527, 1990). Here we describe the methods used and the responses of single components of the larger model. Perivascular pressure is modeled as a function of intravascular and transpulmonary pressures (Pv and Ptp, respectively) and vessel length as a function of lung volume. These and the relationship between vascular area (A) and transmural pressure (Ptm) were modeled primarily from the dog data of Smith and Mitzner (J. Appl. Physiol. 48: 450-467, 1980). Vasomotor tone is modeled as a radial collapsing pressure (Pt) in the same plane as Ptm. In view of lack of information about the relationship between Pt and A for a given active state, different patterns were assumed that span a wide range of possible relationships. The P-F and Pin-Pout relationships of single vessels were very similar to those reported for the entire intact circulation. Of note, the slope of the Pin-Pout relationship in the low Pout range (0-5 Torr) was very low (less than 0.25) and increased gradually with Pout toward unity. Vasomotor tone caused an apparent parallel shift in the P-F relationship in the physiological flow range of the dog (2-8 l/min) regardless of the pattern used to model the Pt vs. A relationship; different patterns affected the P-F relationship only over the low flow range before the parallel shift was established.\r"

To examine this question we developed a multibranched model in which an arterial vascular bed bifurcates sequentially up to 8 parallel channels that converge and reunite at the venous side to end in the left atrium. Eight resistors representing the capillary bed separate the arterial and venous beds. The elastic behavior of capillaries and extra-alveolar vessels was modeled after Fung and Sobin (Circ. Res. 30: 451-490, 1972) and Smith and Mitzner (J. Appl. Physiol. 48: 450-467, 1980), respectively. Forces acting on each component are modified and calculated individually, thus enabling the user to explore the effects of parallel and longitudinal heterogeneities in applied forces (e.g., gravity, vasomotor tone). Model predictions indicate that the contribution of distensibility to nonlinearities in the pressure-flow (P-F) and atrial-pulmonary arterial pressure (Pla-Ppa) relationships is substantial, whereas gravity-related recruitment contributes very little to these relationships. In addition, Pla-Ppa relationships, obtained at a constant flow, have no discriminating ability in identifying the presence or absence of a waterfall along the circulation. The P-F relationship is routinely shifted in a parallel fashion, within the physiological flow range, whenever extra forces (e.g., lung volume, tone) are applied uniformly at one or more branching levels, regardless of whether a waterfall is created. For a given applied force, the magnitude of parallel shift varies with proportion of the circulation subjected to the added force and with Pla.\r"

  ".W": "We have shown that administration of the antifibrotic agent cis-4-hydroxy-L-proline (cHyp) to rats at the onset of exposure to hypoxia prevents collagen accumulation in pulmonary arteries and the rise in pulmonary blood pressure. In this experiment, we tested whether cHyp is effective when administered after hypertension was already established. Rats were exposed to hypoxia (10% O2) for 21 days. Groups were hypoxic animals treated with cHyp (200 mg/kg sc twice daily) on days 10-21 (hypoxic cHyp) and saline-injected hypoxic animals (hypoxic). On day 21, we measured mean right ventricular pressure, hematocrit, collagen content of main and intrapulmonary arteries, and wall thickness of arterioles. Treatment reduced right ventricular pressure from 21 +/- 1 to 17 +/- 1 mmHg (P less than 0.05), hematocrit from 66 +/- 1 to 56 +/- 1% (P less than 0.05), hydroxyproline content of intrapulmonary arteries from 30 +/- 3 to 11 +/- 2 micrograms/vessel (P less than 0.05), and wall thickness from 27 +/- 3 to 16 +/- 2 microns (P less than 0.05). These results show that vascular collagen content is increased in established pulmonary hypertension and that cHyp treatment is effective in partially preventing the hemodynamic, structural, and biochemical changes if started after pulmonary hypertension is established. cHyp may also affect the rheological properties of blood.\r"

  ".W": "The plasticity of two selected mRNAs was studied in two typical fast-twitch muscles at different time intervals after orchiectomy (GDX). The levator ani muscle of the rat (LA) is exquisitely sensitive to androgens, whereas the superficial vastus lateralis (SVL) lacks such sensitivity. In vitro translation of RNA isolated from both tissues indicated that actin was among the most repressed proteins of the LA at day 10 postsurgery (GDX-10 days), whereas the template activity of the SVL mRNAs remains virtually unmodified. We used an available actin cDNA and demonstrated that the expression of the LA actin message is reduced by 85% in GDX-10 days and can be recovered after testosterone propionate (TP) injections (GDX + TP). In contrast, the actin expression in SVL remains constant up to day 20 postsurgery. In the LA, the expression of creatine kinase (CK) mRNA was increased 140% in GDX-5 days and decreased 34 and 17% in GDX-10 days and GDX-20 days, respectively, although the measured CK activity, as well as the in vitro translation of the message, remained elevated in those two latter groups. Control level of the CK mRNA expression was recovered in the GDX + TP group. Again, the expression of the message was unchanged in SVL, suggesting that the protein synthesis of this skeletal muscle is far less sensitive to androgen deprivation than that of the LA muscle.\r"

An increase in stress recovery of the pulmonary tissues was measured with the interrupter technique after aerosolized histamine. These data demonstrate that aerosolized histamine caused an increase in the tissue viscoelastic properties. The most reasonable explanation for the mechanism of this increase would seem to be via reflex pathways stimulated by centrally located receptors.\r"

We analyzed bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and by specific radioimmunoassay. The mean concentration of LTB4 was higher [0.31 +/- 0.09 (SE) ng/ml, range 0.15-0.51] in BAL fluid of sensitized subjects who developed a late asthmatic reaction than in BAL fluid of subjects who developed an early asthmatic reaction (0.05 +/- 0.04 ng/ml, range 0-0.224), and no LTB4 was detectable in the control subjects. We also performed BAL 8 h after TDI exposure on four TDI-sensitized late-dual reactors who were on steroid treatment. In this group of subjects no LTB4 was detectable. These results suggest that LTB4 may be involved in late asthmatic reactions induced by TDI.\r"

We studied the effect of high and low blood flow rates on Kf,c in papaverine-pretreated blood-perfused isolated dog lungs perfused under zone 3 conditions with and without paraquat (PQ, 10(-2) M). Three Kf,cs were measured successively at hourly intervals for 5 h. These progressed sequentially from isogravimetric blood flow with low vascular pressure (I/L) to high flow with low vascular pressure (H/L) to high flow with high vascular pressure (H/H). The blood flows of H/L and H/H were greater than or equal to 1.5 times that of I/L. There were no significant changes in Kf,c in lungs without paraquat over a 50-fold range of blood flow rates. At 3 h after PQ, I/L-Kf,c was significantly increased and both isogravimetric capillary pressure and total protein reflection coefficient were decreased from base line. At 4 and 5 h, H/L-Kf,c was significantly greater than the corresponding I/L-Kf,c (1.01 +/- 0.22 vs. 0.69 +/- 0.09 and 1.26 +/- 0.19 vs. 0.79 +/- 0.10 ml.min-1.cmH2O-1.100 g-1, respectively) and isogravimetric blood flow decreased to 32.0 and 12.0% of base line, respectively. Pulmonary vascular resistance increased to 12 times base line at 5 h after PQ. We conclude that Kf,c is independent of blood flow in uninjured lungs. However, Kf,c measured at isogravimetric blood flow underestimated the degree of increase in Kf,c in severely damaged and edematous lungs because of a high vascular resistance and derecruitment of filtering surface area.\r"

Natural rabbit surfactant, Survanta, or 0.45% NaCl was injected into the left main stem bronchus by use of a Swan-Ganz catheter. Radio-labeled palmitic acid was then given by intravascular injection at two times after surfactant treatment, and the ratios of label incorporation and secretion in the left lower lobe to label incorporation and secretion in the right lung were compared. The treatment procedure resulted in a reasonably uniform surfactant distribution and did not disrupt lobar pulmonary blood flow. Natural rabbit surfactant increased incorporation of palmitate into saturated phosphatidylcholine (Sat PC) approximately 2-fold (P less than 0.01), and secretion of labeled Sat PC increased approximately 2.5-fold in the surfactant-treated left lower lobe relative to the right lung (P less than 0.01). Although Survanta did not alter incorporation, it did increase secretion but not to the same extent as rabbit surfactant (P less than 0.01). Alteration of endogenous surfactant Sat PC metabolism in vivo by surfactant treatments was different from that which would have been predicted by previous in vitro studies.\r"

After a resting cycle (1 low-voltage followed by 1 high-voltage electrocortical activity epoch), the fetal lung was distended via an endotracheal tube using mean airway pressure of approximately cmH2O.

  ".W": "A new device that utilizes the voltages induced in separate coils encircling the rib cage and abdomen by a magnetic field is described for measurement of cross-sectional areas of the human chest wall (rib cage and abdomen) and their variation during breathing. A uniform magnetic field (1.4 X 10(-7) Tesla at 100 kHz) is produced by generating an alternating current at 100 kHz in two square coils, 1.98 m on each side, parallel to the planes of the areas to be measured and placed symmetrically cephalad and caudad to these planes at a mean distance of 0.53 m. We demonstrated that the accuracy of the device on well-defined surfaces (squares, circles, rectangles, ellipses) was within 1% in all cases. Observed errors are due primarily to small inhomogeneities of the magnetic field and variation of the orientation of the coil relative to the field. Using a second magnetic field (80 kHz) perpendicular to the first, we measured the errors due to nonparallel orientation during quiet breathing and inspiratory capacity maneuvers. In 10 normal subjects, orientation effects were less than 2% for the rib cage and less than 0.7% for the abdomen. In five of these subjects, orientation effects at functional residual capacity in lateral and seated postures were generally less than or equal to 5%, but estimated tidal volume during spontaneous breathing was comparable to measurements in the supine posture. In five curarized patients, we assessed the linearity of volume-motion relationships of the rib cage and abdomen, comparing cross-sectional area and circumference measurements. Departures from linearity using cross-sectional areas were only one-third of those using circumferences. In seven normal subjects we compared cross-sectional area measurements with respiratory inductive plethysmography (RIP) and found comparable estimates of lung volume change over a wide range of relative rib cage contributions to tidal volume (-5 to 105%), with slightly higher standard deviations for the RIP (SD = 10% for RIP; SD = 4% for cross-sectional area).\r"

Female adrenalectomized rats received an injection (50 microCi/100 g body wt ip) of [3H]triamcinolone acetonide and remained sedentary or were immediately exercised by endurance running at 23 m/min for up to 90 min. Receptor activation, as quantified by binding to DNA-cellulose, steadily increased from 10-20% of the receptors capable of binding DNA in uninjected controls to 25-45% by 5 min and to 53-80% by 90 min after receiving the hormone in all muscles studied (fast-twitch red vastus lateralis, fast-twitch white vastus lateralis, slow-twitch soleus, mixed gastrocnemius, and heart). Exercise did not influence the time-course changes in percent activation. When activation was determined from changes in the conformational state of the receptor as measured by diethylaminoethyl-cellulose anion exchange chromatography, there was a similar time-dependent formation of activated receptor forms in all muscle types. However, exercise did not inhibit or delay the appearance of the activated receptor from the unactivated state. These results indicate that glucocorticoid receptor activation occurs at a rate that is independent of both fiber type and delivery of steroid to working muscles during exercise. If exercise alters receptor activation, a longer time period, beyond 90 min of running, or even additional training may be needed for inhibition to be expressed.\r"

This paper quantitatively assesses the effects of experimental error on resolution. The washout curves from five typical distributions were studied using linear programming and Monte Carlo methods. A measurement error of 0.1% was assumed in the mixed-expired N2 signal. Only 7 of the first 17 breaths contribute independent information about the underlying distribution, and only rough resolution of the underlying distribution is possible in the presence of error. Only two modes of ventilation plus an estimate of dead space can be confidently resolved. It is not possible to separate VA/V greater than 10 from dead space. A 10-fold reduction in experimental error will not greatly improve resolution. Experimental error, by reducing the linear independence of the defining kernels, significantly limits the information content and resolution of the multibreath N2 washout.\r"

Animals of group 1 served as control; in animals of group 2, both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems were blocked; in animals of group 3, only the parasympathetic system was blocked. In each group, the animals were randomly divided into two subgroups characterized by their ventilatory pattern: rate of 60/min with a 6-ml/kg tidal volume or rate of 40/min with a 9-ml/kg tidal volume. Bronchopulmonary reactivity to infused histamine was assessed by the respiratory compliance and conductance values measured during bronchoconstriction and expressed as a percentage of the corresponding basal values. In group 1 the animals ventilated with a 9-ml/kg tidal volume were found significantly less reactive than those ventilated with a 6-ml/kg tidal volume. This difference was abolished in groups 2 and 3. These results demonstrate that the effects of increased tidal volume on bronchopulmonary reactivity are vagally mediated and suggest that the decrease observed in histamine-induced bronchoconstriction is mainly due to reflex effects evoked by stretch receptor stimulation.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of the pericardium on ventricular loading during respiration was studied in 17 acutely instrumented anesthetized dogs. Changes in intrapericardial surface pressures (Ppe) on the ventricles were measured by use of air-filled flat latex balloons during acute changes in ventricular loading with the chest open or during negative intrathoracic pressure (NITP) produced by phrenic nerve stimulation with the chest closed. Ppe always demonstrated a phasic change within a cardiac cycle, with its maximum near end diastole and minimum near end systole, and a waveform similar to ventricular dimensions measured by sonomicrometer crystals. With the chest open we found that 1) inferior vena caval constriction decreased Ppe on both ventricles at end diastole (P less than 0.01), 2) aortic constriction increased Ppe on both ventricles at end systole and end diastole (P less than 0.05), and 3) pulmonary artery constriction increased Ppe on the right ventricle (RV) (P less than 0.01) while decreasing Ppe on the left ventricle (LV) at end diastole (P less than 0.05). Thus regional Ppe over a ventricle is influenced by changes in ventricular loading conditions. During NITP with lung volume either constant or increased, Ppe over the anterolateral LV decreased less than two independent extrapericardial measures of intrathoracic pressure, and this resulted in an increased transpericardial pressure at end systole (P less than 0.05) and end diastole (P less than 0.01). During NITP with increased transpericardial pressure, Ppe over the anterior LV, lateral LV, and RV inflow showed small regional differences, but all decreased less than esophageal pressure (P less than 0.01). These results sugges that the increase in transpericardial pressure during late diastole to early systole, produced by increases in ventricular volume during NITP, could effectively attenuate the increases in ventricular preload and afterload caused by respiration, analogous to a negative feedback loop.\r"

We have recently shown (J. Appl.

We questioned whether the same interpretation would apply after induced constriction. Accordingly, we performed interruption experiments on anesthetized, paralyzed, tracheostomized, open-chest mongrel dogs during passive expiration, measuring pressure at the trachea and in three different alveolar regions with alveolar capsules. We recorded measurements before and after the administration of increasing concentrations of histamine aerosol (0.1-30.0 mg/ml). We found a significant increase in the heterogeneity of alveolar pressures during the relaxed expiration with increasing concentrations of histamine. Despite the introduction of significant mechanical heterogeneities, delta Pinit still reflected the pressure drop as the result of the resistance of the conducting airways. delta Pdif, however, reflected a combination of the stress recovery of the tissues and pendelluft.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between surface myoelectric signal parameters and the level of voluntary or electrically elicited contractions was studied in 32 experiments on the tibialis anterior muscle of 22 healthy human subjects. Contractions were performed at 20 and 80% of the maximum voluntary contraction torque. Two levels of stimulation current were used, yielding, respectively, a maximum M wave and an M wave approximately 30% of the maximum. A four-bar electrode probe was used to detect single- and double-differential signals from which mean and median frequency of the power spectrum and average muscle fiber conduction velocity were estimated. Measurements obtained from voluntary contractions showed a positive correlation between contraction levels and both conduction velocity and spectral parameters. Conduction velocity increased by 21.2 +/- 10.9% when voluntary contraction level increased from 20 to 80% of the maximal value. Spectral parameters increased by similar amounts. Tetanic electrical stimulation was applied to a muscle motor point for 20 s via surface electrodes. Rectangular current pulses with 0.1-ms width and frequencies of 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 Hz were used. Four types of behavior were observed with increasing stimulation level: 1) the two spectral parameters and conduction velocity both increased with stimulation in 15 experiments, 2) the two spectral parameters decreased and conduction velocity increased in 8 experiments, 3) the two spectral parameters and conduction velocity both decreased in 6 experiments, and 4) the two spectral parameters increased and conduction velocity decreased in 3 experiments. Conduction velocity increased with increasing stimulation current in 72% of the experiments, indicating a recruitment order similar to that of voluntary contractions, although it decreased in the other 28% of the cases, indicating a reverse order of recruitment. Contrary to what is observed in direct stimulation of nerves, motor units are not in general recruited in reverse order of size during electrical stimulation of a muscle motor point. This discrepancy may be the result of geometric factors or a lack of correlation between axonal branch diameter and the diameter of the parent motoneuron axon. Changes of conduction velocity and spectral parameters in opposite directions may be the result of the combined effect of the motor unit recruitment order and of the different tissue filtering function associated with the geometric location of the recruited motor units within the muscle.\r"

  ".W": "Lipocortin I is a corticosteroid-inducible protein that has potent anti-inflammatory activity. To determine whether lipocortin I is present on the epithelial surface of the human lung, we used a specific polyclonal antibody by the technique of Western blotting to evaluate bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of normal individuals and patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Lipocortin I was a normal constituent of the epithelial surface of the normal lung and comprised 0.23 +/- 0.03% of BAL fluid proteins. Four separate immunoreactive species were detected, at 37, 36, 34, and 33 kDa, consistent with previously published results. Corticosteroids increased the amounts of lipocortin present in normal volunteers and in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. These results demonstrate that lipocortin I is normally present in the human lung and further suggest that lipocortin I may be an important modulator of the anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids in the lung.\r"

  ".W": "Endurance training by swimming (219-229 h) resulted in a significant protection against hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced injuries in Langendorff-perfused rat hearts. The protection was manifested as improved flow characteristics and a smaller release of creatine kinase into the perfusate. The concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) was lower in the trained than in the respective control hearts. The trained hearts also showed a lower reoxygenation-induced increase in TBARS. The myocardium of the right ventricle and that of the left subepimyocardium were the most affected by reoxygenation. The swimming program induced a decrease in the activities of catalase and glutathione reductase in all parts of the myocardium measured. A decrease in vitamin E concentration in the subendomyocardium of the left ventricle and an increase in the activity of thioredoxin reductase also occurred. An increase in the concentration of reduced glutathione due to training was also observed, especially in the left subepimyocardium, whereas the glutathione disulfide concentration and the activity of superoxide dismutase were unaffected. The activity of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase increased in the right ventricle. The results suggest both the importance of cellular redox state and the role of a lower degree of enzymatic antioxidants in training-induced protection against ischemic injuries.\r"

  ".U": "90270191\r", 
  ".W": "In the guinea pig isolated perfused lung, we have examined the relationship between the effects of capsaicin and neuropeptide release and the possible existence of an axon reflex arrangement. Bolus injections into the pulmonary artery of capsaicin (1-100 pmol), substance P (10-1,000 pmol), and neurokinin (NK) A (10-100 pmol) produced a concentration-dependent bronchoconstriction, whereas calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP, 20-40 nmol) was without effect. Repeated administration of capsaicin at 40- to 60-min intervals was not associated with tachyphylaxis. These data support the presence of a NK2- (or NKA) type of tachykinin receptor in the guinea pig airways. Tetrodotoxin (0.3-3 microM) inhibited the effect of capsaicin, indicating that an axon reflex was operant. Capsaicin increased overflow of CGRP-like immunoreactivity (-LI) and NKA-LI, the latter only during concurrent infusion of the enkephalinase inhibitor phosphoramidon (3 microM). Phosphoramidon also increased overflow of CGRP-LI, suggesting that both NKA and CGRP were catabolized by a similar enzyme. The purine nucleoside adenosine did not cause any detectable overflow of CGRP-LI, indicating that neuropeptides may not be involved in adenosine-evoked bronchoconstriction and that bronchoconstriction per se does not induce neuropeptide overflow. Capsaicin and NKA had only minor effects on buffer flow, whereas substance P produced pulmonary vasoconstriction. These data clearly demonstrate that capsaicin acts via an axon reflex in the guinea pig airways. Supramaximal concentrations of capsaicin are needed to detect neuropeptide overflow, but the possibility exists that released neuropeptides mediate its effects.\r"

  ".W": "Using techniques of mathematical simulation, we compared two methods of evaluating pulmonary vascular permeability, i.e., transvascular protein flux. Both methods calculate a transport rate constant [pulmonary transcapillary escape rate (PTCER)] after making external radiation detection measurements of an intravenously administered radiolabeled protein. With one method, lung tissue time-activity data are acquired by positron emission tomography (PET) and are interpreted with a two-compartment model. With the other method, the time-activity data are acquired with simple detector probes and are interpreted by linear regression after normalizing for various physical factors (slope-intercept or SI method). The results show that significant errors in calculating PTCER can result from using the SI method, because it ignores the effects of back-flux on the tissue time-activity measurements. Both methods produce errors if the data analysis includes activity from vascular volumes not involved in tracer exchange with the extravascular compartment. Significant errors can also occur with the PET method, particularly when permeability is nearly normal, if pulmonary vascular volume changes significantly during the period of data collection. On balance, the PET method appears to be the method of choice for accurately evaluating pulmonary vascular permeability by protein flux measurements, although both methods may be useful in clinical applications.\r"

To improve RV analysis, custom computer-aided design programs were employed to obtain RV volumes and three-dimensional models from biplane ventriculograms. Biplane RV ventriculograms were analyzed from 14 anesthetized dogs and 22 RV casts. Computed volumes were highly correlated with reference RV volumes (r = 0.98, n = 36, P less than 0.01) with a range of 5-73 ml. Three-dimensional wire-frame and solid models constructed from the ventriculographic images provided excellent detail and a new perspective in chamber shape. This modeling technique was then used to examine RV volumes, geometric conformation, and regional shortening in 10 pigs during inotropic stimulation and preload reduction. Changes in RV volumes, ejection fraction, and regional motion were detected as well as alterations in chamber conformation. In summary 1) computer-aided design offers an accurate and simplified means to compute RV volumes using basic microcomputer equipment, and 2) three-dimensional reconstruction provided a unique view of RV geometry and a means to examine regional RV function.\r"

The following data were analyzed: acetylene cardiac output (Qc), lung tissue volume (Vti), and carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) measured by rebreathing techniques in a population of 86 healthy subjects (51 men and 35 women). Each subject was measured twice with a computerized rebreathing system using a test gas of 10% He-0.3% C18O-0.7% C2H2-25% O2-balance N2 while sitting at rest. The estimated coefficients of variation for repeated measurements were 6.8, 10.3, and 5.7% for Qc, Vti, and DLCO, respectively. Chebyshev's inequality was used to estimate the imprecision for a single measurement of these parameters and for averages of two or more repeated values. A single measurement of Qc would be within 14.2% of a \"true\" mean 90% of the time, whereas an average of three consecutive measurements would be within 8.2% of the true mean 90% of the time. Single measurements of Vti and DLCO were found to be within 21.7 and 12.0%, respectively, of the true mean 90% of the time. When three consecutive measurements are averaged, Vti is within 12.6% and DLCO is within 6.9% of the true mean 90% of the time. We conclude that 1) rebreathing Qc is as reproducible as other measurements of cardiac output, 2) rebreathing measurements of DLCO are as reproducible as those made by the single-breath technique, and 3) an average of two to three measurements of Vti should be made to obtain values with a reasonable degree of precision.\r"

The total respiratory impedance was partitioned into pulmonary and chest wall impedances to characterize the oscillatory mechanical properties of each component. The pulmonary and chest wall resistances were not frequency dependent in the 3- to 15-Hz range. The mean pulmonary resistance was 13.8 +/- 3.2 (SD) cmH2O.l-1.s, although the mean chest wall resistance was 8.6 +/- 2.0 cmH2O.l-1.s. The pulmonary elastance and inertance were 0.247 +/- 0.095 cmH2O/ml and 0.103 +/- 0.033 cmH2O.l-1.s2, respectively. The chest wall elastance and inertance were 0.533 +/- 0.136 cmH2O/ml and 0.041 +/- 0.063 cmH2O.l-1.s2, respectively. With a linear mechanical behavior, the transpulmonary pressure oscillations required to ventilate these tracheotomized animals were at their minimal value at 3 Hz. As the ventilatory frequency was increased beyond 6-9 Hz, both the minute ventilation necessary to maintain normocapnia and the pulmonary impedance increased. These data suggest that ventilation by body-surface oscillation is better suited for relatively moderate frequencies in rabbits with normal lungs.\r"

The esophageal electrode was similar to that used by other investigators to record PCA activity (P. C. Kosch et al. J. Appl. Physiol. 64: 1968-1978, 1988). Simultaneous recordings from the intramuscular and esophageal electrodes were obtained during wakefulness and sleep. Changes in esophageal electrode activity were compared with changes in intramuscular electrode activity under four conditions: 1) voluntary maneuvers, 2) differences in state, 3) nasal airway occlusion during non-rapid-eye-movement sleep, and 4) spontaneous variations in respiratory efforts during non-rapid-eye-movement or rapid-eye-movement sleep. Although similar results were obtained from the esophageal and intramuscular electrodes, differences were present between the two recordings during both wakefulness and sleep. The esophageal electrode recorded activity from surrounding muscles during voluntary maneuvers, vocalization, and quiet breathing in wakefulness. Discrepancies between the two electrode recordings during sleep occurred under conditions of increased and decreased respiratory motor output. The data suggest that the esophageal electrode may not give an accurate assessment of PCA activity during many conditions in wakefulness and sleep.\r"

A new electromyographic technique was developed to implant hooked-wire electrodes into the PCA by using a nasopharyngoscope. A previously described technique was used to induce upper airway occlusions during NREM sleep (Kuna and Smickley, J. Appl. Physiol. 64: 347-353, 1988). The PCA exhibited phasic inspiratory activity during quiet breathing in wakefulness and sleep in all subjects. Discounting changes in tonic activity, peak amplitude of PCA inspiratory activity during stage 3-4 NREM sleep decreased to 77% of its value in wakefulness. Tonic activity throughout the respiratory cycle was present in all subjects during wakefulness but was absent during state 3-4 NREM sleep. In this sleep stage, PCA phasic activity abruptly terminated near the end of inspiration. During nasal airway occlusions in NREM sleep, PCA phasic activity did not increase significantly during the first or second occluded effort. The results, in combination with recent findings for vocal cord adductors in awake and sleeping adults, suggest that vocal cord position during quiet breathing in wakefulness is actively controlled by simultaneously acting antagonistic intrinsic laryngeal muscles. In contrast, the return of the vocal cords toward the midline during expiration in stage 3-4 NREM sleep appears to be a passive phenomenon.\r"

Guinea pigs given saline intratracheally breathed normally and had arterial O2 saturations (SaO2) greater than 94%. In contrast, guinea pigs that had an estimated 10(-4) M intra-alveolar concentration of amiloride had chest wall retractions and 88 +/- 3.6% (SD) SaO2 (P less than 0.01). Extravascular lung water (EVLW) per gram of dry lung weight 4 h after birth was significantly greater in newborns that received amiloride (8.3 +/- 1.1, n = 5) than in those that received saline (5.6 +/- 0.9, n = 7, P less than 0.01). The degree of perivascular fluid cuffing at 25 cmH2O inflation was quantitatively similar in amiloride- and saline-treated animals. The effect of amiloride was dose dependent. Intratracheal amiloride did not affect EVLW in 9-day-old guinea pigs. This study demonstrates that intratracheal amiloride before the first breath results in respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and an abnormally high EVLW. Epithelial sodium transport contributes normal lung liquid clearance after birth.\r"

FRTL-5 cells were sonicated and incubated with 0.5 mumol/L rT3 with a tracer amount of [125I]rT3 in 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer containing 1 mmol/L EDTA and 0.5 mmol/L dithiothreitol. The released 125I- was separated by Dowex-50WX2 column and counted. The amount of I- released was tissue, incubation time, temperature, and pH dependent, strongly suggesting that the reaction is enzymatic. The activity was completely inhibited by propylthiouracil. The Km value for rT3 was approximately 0.32 microM when analyzed by Lineweaver-Burk plot. TSH, dibutyl cAMP, and Graves' IgG induced I-5'-D activity in a dose-dependent manner. However, cycloheximide (5 mumol/L) abolished the stimulating effects of these agents on I-5'-D activity. These results suggest that TSH, dibutyl cAMP, and Graves' IgG induced I-5'-D activity through the synthesis of new enzyme protein. A significant positive correlation between thyroid-stimulating antibody activity assayed by measuring cAMP production using FRTL-5 cells and I-5'-D activity induced by the Graves' IgG in 10 patients with untreated Graves' disease was observed (r = 0.79; P less than 0.01). The present findings suggest that type I iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase exists in FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells and that Graves' IgG as well as TSH stimulate the activity at least in part by activating adenylate cyclase.\r"

One primary case and several variations were provided, which differed in respect to age, sex, goiter size, severity, etc. The questionnaire was based on the format used in a similar survey of members of the European Thyroid Association. The aim of the survey was to determine 1) how expert thyroidologist employ diagnostic procedures for this disorder, and 2) the choice of therapy of the three treatment options and its manner of implementation. Questionnaires were sent only to clinically active members. The overall response rate was 62%. Data analysis was possible on 52% of members surveyed and was performed using SPSS and a specific Fortran program. In the laboratory evaluation of the primary case a radioiodine uptake, scan, serum total T4, and basal TSH were requested by 92%, 47%, 83%, and 66%, respectively, with 84% of respondents using an ultrasensitive TSH assay. For management of the primary case, radioiodine treatment was the first choice of 69% of the respondents. Antithyroid drugs were used briefly (3-7 days) before 131I by 28%, whereas 41% said they would employ thioureas after 131I. Of those using 131I, 66% tailored the dose to achieve euthyroidism as the goal of therapy, while 34% aimed for hypothyroidism requiring T4 replacement. Only 30% of respondents chose thioureas as a first line of treatment (72% propylthiouracil; 28% tapazole). The duration of drug therapy was a predetermined fixed interval for 80% of the respondents, with 90% treating for 1-2 yr. Other specific trends in diagnostic approach and therapeutic preferences were identified for the eight variations on the primary case problem.\r"

No effect was observed at 1 and 10 micrograms/mL, but at 100 micrograms/mL, RU486 inhibited the simulation of progesterone secretion induced by LH and cAMP. It is suggested that the main target of RU486 is the cytochrome P450scc function [catalyzing the formation of pregnenolone (D5P) from cholesterol], since no accumulation of D5P or hydroxy derivatives of progesterone was observed. As RU486 is an antiglucocorticosteroid and antiprogesterone agent, the effects of dexamethasone and progesterone were also investigated. Dexamethasone did not modify progesterone secretion, but progesterone inhibited its own synthesis in both the presence and absence of LH. Thus, under these experimental conditions RU486 displayed a progesterone-like effect. However, since the effect of RU486 was observed only at a concentration around 10(-4) M, the mechanism of action may not involve a receptor pathway and may not apply to most clinical circumstances.\r"

To facilitate detection of cases of IGHD1A, we have developed a rapid method that uses polymerase chain reaction amplification of small amounts of genomic DNA, digestion with a single restriction endonuclease, and visualization of DNA fragments after gel electrophoresis. Employing this method we have identified two subjects with IGHD1A among a cohort of seven Chinese subjects with severe growth retardation due to GHD.\r"
