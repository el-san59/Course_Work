N22 results solely from activation of interneurons in the dorsal gray of the cord at the root entry zone, but N13 may receive contributions from the nucleus cuneatus.

An abnormal visual evoked potential was found in 58%, 69%, and 81% of the eyes tested in possible, probable, and definite MS and in 88% of the non-MS group. The 28' PR produced the most abnormal responses, the greatest number with either greater than 3 standard deviations (SD) from the mean or greater than 2 SD in both MS and non-MS groups. The FL was second best at producing the most abnormal responses, but more often produced the only abnormality (29), compared with 28' PR (11). The 56' PR produced the only abnormality in none of the MS pts and in only one of the non-MS pts. In all categories (most abnormal, greater than 3 SD, greater than 2 SD, the only abnormality of greater than 3 SD or greater than 2 SD, and other peaks abnormal), the 28' PR was usually by far the best stimulus for definite (and probable) MS, but equally as effective was the FL in the possible MS pts Our data suggest the usefulness of 28' and not 56' PR, but the FL is especially useful in pts with possible MS.\r"

In the resulting VER amplitude/pressure curves glaucoma patients did not show the sign of autoregulation of optic nerve head circulation which is seen in healthy subjects. It is known that topically applied timolol maleate may affect optic nerve head circulation. Therefore the pressure compliance test was performed in 20 healthy eyes before and after 3 days of topically applied timolol maleate 0.5%. The aim of the study was to test the effect of topically applied timolol on optic nerve head autoregulation. In addition we determined the ocular perfusion pressures, heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure. While the ocular perfusion pressures show a slight, but statistically not significant, decrease under timolol, the systemic parameters and the autoregulation behavior did not change.\r"

Paraffin-embedded tissues containing mycotic organisms were stained with CFW and examined under a fluorescent microscope. Several fungi such as Candida sp, Aspergillus sp, Phycomycetes, Fusarium solani, Histoplasma capsulatum, Cryptococcus neoformans, Rhinosporidium seeberi, and others were studied. Trephine corneal biopsy specimens (2 mm) and methanol-fixed corneal scrapings containing Acanthamoeba sp were also examined. The walls of fungi and Acanthamoeba cysts stained bright greenish white in contrast to the reddish-orange background of the supporting tissues. The results demonstrate that the CFW method is a highly reliable and rapid technique for identification of mycotic organisms as well as cysts of Acanthamoeba. This method may also be applied in surgical pathology when performing frozen sections, as well as cytologic examination of corneal smears, vitrectomy specimens, and others.\r"

In the five patients who received the intramuscular dose, no cefotaxime or its major metabolite could be detected in the vitreous. In the 25 patients who received the subconjunctival dose, cefotaxime or its metabolite could be only detected in patients with aphakia or in those who previously underwent vitreal surgery.

Vision correlated inversely with the grade of AVCR. The presence of concomitant systemic AVC correlated directly with the grade of AVCR. It is concluded that grade I AVCR and the majority of grade II AVCR represent isolated retinal vascular anomalies, and there is no need for extensive search for systemic AVC if these patients remain asymptomatic.\r"

Visual loss is mainly due to central nervous system (CNS) demyelination involving the visual tracts, but primary retinal ganglion cell degeneration may also be operative. All patients in this study were male. Vision ranged from 20/20 to no light perception (NLP). All but one patient with bilateral cataracts had normal anterior segment examinations. Seven patients had exotropia, and esotropia developed in one patient. Electroretinography (ERG) and electrooculography (EOG) findings were normal in two patients with severe visual loss. Macular pigmentary changes were observed in three patients. Optic pallor was noticed in seven patients. Optic nerve hypoplasia was seen in one patient. Visual-evoked responses were abnormal in two patients and borderline in one. Progressive visual field abnormalities were noticed in three patients, large field cuts in two patients, and normal fields in another two patients. The diagnosis of ALD should be considered in all boys presenting with unexplained visual loss, dementia, and adrenal dysfunction.\r"

Over the ensuring 12 years, the patient experienced multiple recurrences of invasive malignant melanoma that emerged from the progressive primary acquired melanosis. Two of these recurrences were composed of nonpigmented spindle cells, and in the most florid invasive malignant melanoma that developed, the spindle cells formed a nodule 7.5 mm thick. The spindle cells were organized into fascicles and small bundles, the latter separated by a loose stroma that was devoid of mucopolysaccharides. The fascicular and neuroidal features in this case were sufficiently well developed to suggest the incorrect diagnosis of a neural tumor or a neurofibroma. However, the presence of intraepithelial atypical melanocytes at the edge of the spindle cell lesion, the absence of mucopolysaccharides in the stroma, the mitotic activity, and the absence of intercellular reticulin fibers favored the diagnosis of a spindle cell invasive malignant melanoma. This morphologic variant of conjunctival melanoma is compared with related cutaneous lesions of melanoma featuring a spindle cell population.\r"

The cysts were remarkable for possessing a superior dome of either creamy or yellowish material (probably reflecting the lipid-rich decapitation secretion), surmounting a clearer fluid inferiorly, as well as for being restricted to the eyelid margins where the glands of Moll are located. Light microscopy disclosed a double-layered cuboidal cellular lining, which focally became more plump or hobnailed, exhibited apical decapitation secretion, and was occasionally thrown into papillary folds. Electron microscopy demonstrated cellular debris and segments of interrupted plasmalemmas within the cystic cavity, intercellular widenings constituting canaliculi, cytoplasmic election-dense secretory granules, flocculent mucous vacuoles, and swirls of smooth-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum. Basal cells were focally interspersed between the secretory cells and the basement membrane, and occasionally manifested spotty myofilamentary differentiation. These findings are supportive of an origin of the lesions from the secretory rather than the ductal portion of the glands of Moll. They corroborate conclusions drawn from dermatologic investigations that the cysts are an essentially proliferative process as opposed to the result of passive ductal dilatation.\r"

Thresholds for Nd:YAG laser-induced damage were determined for injection-molded and lathe-cut polymethylmethacrylate lenses. When aimed at a membrane in contact with a posterior convex surface, the average thresholds were 0.96 +/- 0.18 mJ (Standard deviation [SD]) and 1.80 +/- 0.55 mJ, respectively. The difference was significant at P = 0.001. When injection-molding polymethylmethacrylate was used to make lathe-cut IOLs, very few iridescent clefts were present, and the threshold to Nd:YAG laser-induced damage was 0.94 +/- 0.25 mJ. Iridescent clefts are therefore produced during the injection-molding process but they do not lower the threshold to Nd:YAG laser-induced damage. Rather, the reduced threshold in injection-molded lenses is most probably a result of the polymethylmethacrylate used in their manufacture. Clinically, iridescent clefts in a lens suggest that it has been manufactured by an injection-molding process and that Nd:YAG laser posterior capsulotomy must be performed at the lowest possible energy level to avoid damage.\r"

The excised specimen was studied histopathologically and exhibited a lining that was virtually indistinguishable from that of the normal canaliculus, except for hyperplasia of the cellular wall and the focal presence of a superficial mucin-producing columnar cell monolayer at the lumen. The medial edge of the excised specimen showed a merging of the cyst into a nonectatic portion of the canaliculus. Inflammation in the wall of the cyst and in this terminal portion of the canaliculus was not identified. This is believed to be a unique entity of an idiopathic ectasia with mild epithelial proliferation of a segment of the canaliculus.

  ".W": "The structural requirements of skeletal reconstruction should be included in the consideration of an appropriate type of bone graft, whether autogenous or allogeneic tissues are chosen. This analysis should include the nature of any fixation devices to be used, as well as characteristics of the host and donor bone. The mechanical properties and biomechanical response of the graft must be balanced against the type and magnitude of the load to which the graft will be subject. For example, the information presented here suggests that, from a biomechanical perspective, frozen bone would be better suited than freeze-dried bone when the graft is subject to large torsional loads or else the graft must be appropriately protected during incorporation by adequate internal fixation or external bracing. In a situation that is primarily subjected to compressive loads, however, freeze-dried grafts would be just as biomechanically sound. Thus, an understanding of the normal biomechanics of the anatomic region to be reconstructed is crucial. The mechanical properties of the graft are affected by preservation, storage, and sterilization. Incorporation and remodeling of the graft further alter its properties. These properties are, in turn, influenced by the host immune response as well as the local biomechanical environment. The influence of each of these factors is predictable. Obviously, there are numerous considerations in choosing approaches to skeletal reconstruction other than the mechanical issues discussed here. However, an understanding of the mechanical properties involved will help in optimizing the clinical success of these choices.\r"

In 29 cases followed for an average period of 3.9 years, all of the grafts showed radiographic evidence of union. Five hips showed clinical or radiographic evidence for acetabular loosening. Three of these hips required reoperations for symptomatic loosening. In two of these, sufficient bone stock was present to permit another revision without further bone grafting. Twenty-five of the remaining 26 hips were functioning satisfactorily with a mean Harris score of 84 points. In view of the major bone loss following multiple previous operative procedures in these young patients, the results of revisions using structural femoral head allografts were clearly superior to those with resection arthroplasty, the most likely alternate solution. Graft resorption, lack of posterior coverage, and incomplete cement mantle contributed to the failures.\r"

  ".U": "87174526\r", 
  ".W": "To summarize, six issues have been identified in this article that need to be considered before adequate assessment of relative efficacy of treatment programs can be attempted, starting at the front door of treatment. First, the differential referral sources that bring these youngsters to treatment must be considered, with their differential perspectives and definitions of problem behavior. Second, the differential characteristics of the patient population must be assessed. This involves, primarily, systematic and thorough medical and psychiatric diagnosis, but it also includes careful assessment of genetic, familial, social, legal, and developmental characteristics that subcategorize these youngsters. As indicated, when this is done the typical adolescent referred for treatment is likely to have a lifetime diagnosis of attention deficit disorder, conduct disorder, some drug use diagnosis (most likely alcohol and marijuana), past legal problems, a family in turmoil (which has included personal, physical, and possibly sexual abuse to the youngster and also genetic loading for alcoholism), or some learning disability. Third, the differential characteristics of treatment programs must be adequately described and catalogued. No such assessment instruments currently exists. The differential characteristics based on philosophy, treatment strategies, personnel selection, patient admission criteria, treatment techniques employed, length and type of treatment, and length and type of aftercare, all must be assessed. Fourth, the presence or absence of differential treatment strategies responsive to the particular needs of individual adolescents must be categorized. In addition to the overall philosophic flexibility of the program, the capability of responding to particular issues such as the presence of major depressive disorder, learning disability, sexual abuse, or the need for a careful neurologic assessment for subtle temporal lobe issues, must be identified in the program. Fifth, the differential response of the youngster to the treatment process as it is progressing must be able to be assessed and considered as a variable. For example, the ability of the youngster to participate in group confrontational sessions and honestly review his or her past behavior is a measurable variable that to date is ignored in program evaluation. Essentially the only variable currently assessed is treatment completion or failure to complete treatment. Sixth, appropriate outcome variables need to be identified and used. While abstinence is a laudable theoretic goal of treatment, the reality falls somewhat short of that goal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "87174529\r", 
  ".W": "Chemical dependency is part of a significant pattern of serious health problems resulting from the breakdown of social control over impulsive, pleasure-driven adolescent behavior. The drug epidemic in North America, after two decades of relentless increases, shows encouraging signs that stopping it may be possible. Chemical dependency prevention became a serious concern in the 1970s in response to the rising drug epidemic. Initial efforts focused on drug-specific education in the mass media and in the schools. After discouraging and even counterproductive results, nonspecific or generic prevention efforts were tried in both areas. These efforts, too, did not prevent drug use or drug problems. More recently, using cigarette smoking prevention initiatives in schools as a model, hopeful results have been achieved. These efforts combine education about immediate negative effects of drug use with training in skills to resist peer pressure to use drugs. These efforts also build youth peer rejection of drug use. Promising a wider community effort to prevent chemical dependency are several macro prevention programs. These include efforts to decrease tolerance for drug use and to identify drug users in four specific areas: families, schools, highways, and the workplace. Chemical dependency can be prevented by a variety of interventions, including one-to-one encounters, school-based skills training, and society-wide initiatives to reject drug use. The teenage years are a time of unique vulnerability to initiation of drug and alcohol use. The clear goal of prevention is to help young people to survive these years without using drugs, including the gateway drugs: alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and cocaine. The pediatrician can play a vital role in successful prevention activities with patients, with their families, in communities, and in the nation as a whole.\r"

Despite preconditions which selected for a more seriously ill treatment group, patients who received ribavirin showed prompter resolution of the illness than did untreated controls. Greatest clinical improvement in treated patients occurred between the first and second days of ribavirin therapy; mean ribavirin treatment duration was 4.5 days. Ten of 22 ribavirin-treated patients continued to excrete RSV after conclusion of antiviral therapy. No adverse hematologic, renal or metabolic effects occurred with ribavirin therapy. Our experience with ribavirin therapy during a major epidemic confirms and extends the results of previous controlled evaluations demonstrating this treatment safe and effective in high risk and seriously ill infants with RSV bronchiolitis and bronchopneumonia.\r"

To characterize the infectious complications associated with such reservoirs, we reviewed the 10-year experience of the Pediatric Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, and Children's Orthopedic Hospital, Seattle, WA, with 61 patients (49 with leukemia, 8 with lymphoma, 4 with solid tumors) who had intraventricular reservoirs placed for administration of chemotherapy. The reservoirs were in place for a median of 36 weeks and were punctured a median of 29.5 times, Infectious complications occurred in 14 of 61 patients (23%) and Propionibacterium acnes was the most common organism recovered from cultures. Twelve patients (19.7%) had 19 episodes of clinically suspected and microbiologically documented meningitis or of positive intraventricular reservoir cerebrospinal fluid cultures without symptoms which were treated successfully. Local cellulitis occurred at the site of intraventricular reservoir placement in 2 patients (3.3%) and removal of the intraventricular reservoir was necessary for successful management. Nine patients had their intraventricular reservoir removed (5 because of associated infection and 4 because of malfunction unassociated with infection).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We used a risk score based on clinical history and a respiratory score based on the respiratory physical examination, to assess 101 infants with afebrile pneumonitis in the emergency department. Admission and length of hospitalization were decided independently of the study. The population was divided into three groups depending on outcome: mild disease--outpatient management or hospitalization for up to 48 hours; moderate disease--three or more days of hospitalization; and severe disease--admission to the intensive care unit. Twenty-four infants were followed as outpatients. Seventy-seven children were hospitalized: 12 for 48 hours, and 61 for a mean of 4.5 days. Four children were admitted to the intensive care unit. Patients in group 2 versus group 1 were significantly younger and sicker on initial examination, as evidenced by a worse average respiratory score, general appearance, and severity of retractions. Other parameters, including risk score, did not predict course of illness as measured by length of hospitalization. Respiratory physical examination, especially general appearance and severity of retractions, and young age are associated with a worse outcome in afebrile pneumonitis.\r"

Nineteen children were seen and followed in the emergency department of Oklahoma Children's Memorial Hospital over a one-year period. The final clinical diagnoses included acute otitis media, pneumonia, acute gastroenteritis, roseola, and cellulitis of the leg. In the entire group there was no meningitis or subsequent death. One child was hospitalized. The statistical analysis (binomial test at the 0.05 level) confirms that the incidence of serious illness manifested only by high fever is no higher than 0.15. The mere presence of very high fever does not necessarily indicate a serious illness. Laboratory and other diagnostic work-up and hospitalization should be based on clinical evaluations, rather than done routinely.\r"

All wheezing visits to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Emergency Department were analyzed for 1982 and 1983, for ages two to 18. Nine thousand four hundred twenty-five visits fit the study requirements, 27% of the total number of emergency department visits for all causes. The a priori hypothesis used to construct the model was that temperature change, not absolute temperature, would be a good predictor of emergency department visits. Although not attempting to prove a cause-and-effect relationship, by studying temperature velocity (the rate of change of temperature) and the direction of change of temperature (a seasonal variable reflecting rising or falling temperature), a model was created that was highly significant (P less than 0.0001) and could explain 35% of the daily variation in asthmatic emergency department visits (R2 = 35%, r = 0.59). When weekly emergency department visits were analyzed, the model could explain 49% of the variation in the number of emergency department visits (R2 = 49%, r = 0.70). Carbon monoxide, barometric pressure, and relative humidity were also statistically significant predictors but were clinically insignificant, explaining only a few percentage points of the total variation. By taking advantage of the seasonal pattern of wheezing through the use of temperature velocity, predictive models for asthmatic wheezing can be greatly improved. They may also aid in planning emergency department staffing, and even help prevent emergency department visits by premedication or lifestyle change during high-risk periods.\r"

Using puppies six to 12 weeks of age, and three to nine kilograms in weight, we have been able to reliably produce shock (89%) without an excessive initial mortality rate (11%). The animals experienced a decrease in mean arterial pressure to 50% of the baseline level within 1.3 to eight minutes after the injury. This model will permit the study of various methods of resuscitation from blunt abdominal trauma in future experiments.\r"

No opiates were involved and an intussusception was subsequently found. We speculate that the coma and miosis were induced by an endogenous opioid which could also mask the abdominal pain, thus explaining this presentation of intussusception. If so, miosis would be a valuable clue for diagnosing such children.\r"

Five days later, the fever remained and erythema appeared on the oropharynx, tongue, and lips. The skin of the palms and soles became erythematous and indurated, and both conjunctivae became injected. Desquamation of the skin occurred on both thumbs and one finger, and an anterior cervical lymph node was found to be enlarged. The patient was diagnosed as having Kawasaki disease, and treatment with aspirin was started. The desquamation progressed to involve the entire surface of the palms and soles, and then symptoms resolved. Twenty years after recognition of Kawasaki disease, this enigmatic illness continues to defy attempts to understand its etiology and pathogenesis. Most experts agree that the cause is either an environmental toxin or an infectious agent, but other possible causative agents may need to be proposed and investigated.\r"

All subjects wore markers over their mandibles, hips, and knees and were filmed three times with the weighted belt worn on a randomly selected trial. Frames from a 10-second interval of film from each trial were studied, and the summed displacement at each bony landmark between each frame of film was calculated. A significant decrease in displacement at the mandible (p less than .02) was found when the weighted belt was worn. The decrease in displacement was not significant at the hip or knee. Approximation was shown to decrease the postural sway of healthy subjects. Further study is indicated to investigate the effect of approximation on patient populations.\r"

Measurements of lumbar lordosis, pelvic tilt, and abdominal muscle performance were taken of 31 healthy adults aged 20 to 33 years. Each measurement was taken twice, and the measurements were shown to be reliable. The Spearman's rho correlation of the abdominal muscle performance measurements with pelvic tilt was .18 and with lordosis was .06. The Pearson product-moment correlation of lordosis with pelvic tilt was .32. The results indicate that lumbar lordosis, pelvic tilt, and abdominal muscle function during normal standing are not related. This study demonstrates the need for a reexamination of clinical practices based on assumed relationships of abdominal muscle performance, pelvic tilt, and lordosis.\r"

Forty-eight male and female students between the ages of 18 and 35 years volunteered as subjects. Head-neck positions involving the sagittal and horizontal planes and combinations of these were tested. The nondominant hand was used to apply tension to the lever of an isokinetic analyzer under both isometric (static) and isotonic (dynamic) conditions. Peak torque was determined for each H-N position under each condition. Differences in peak torque were elicited more easily from the female subjects than from the male subjects. Head-neck rotation (horizontal plane) appeared to have a greater influence on elbow flexor muscle torque production than movements in the sagittal plane, particularly when movements in the two planes were combined. We concluded, therefore, that H-N position must be considered during rehabilitation of the upper extremity.\r"

Static strengths of the eight muscle groups were measured using a hand-held dynamometer, and strength deficits were calculated against the side ipsilateral to the side affected by the CVA. A two-way analysis of variance for repeated measures revealed significant differences (p less than .001) in the strength deficits of the eight muscle groups and between initial and discharge strength deficits. The strength deficits of the shoulder medial rotator and abductor muscle groups were significantly less than those of any other muscle group. No difference was found in the proportion of muscle groups improving in strength in patients tested within six weeks after the onset of hemiplegia versus patients tested six weeks later. Our results do not confirm the common expectation of relatively lesser involvement of the elbow flexor muscles after a CVA. The results do suggest that patients improve in muscle strength concurrent with a rehabilitation program.\r"

A 20-MHz pulsed Doppler device was used to measure BFV changes in the femoral artery of 20 anesthetized rats after electrical stimulation. The animals were stimulated under the following conditions: four different pulse rates, changes in stimulus voltage, and changes in polarity. Blood flow velocity also was measured in the unstimulated hind limb. Although each of the four pulse rates caused significant increases in BFV, the 20-pulse-per-second rate produced BFV increases significantly greater than the other three pulse rates. The BFV changes, on the average, occurred less than 1 minute from the onset of stimulation and lasted up to 14 minutes after the cessation of the stimulation. The BFV increased with increases in voltage intensity. Both the positive and negative poles elicited significant increases in BFV, but the negative pole produced the greatest increases. Blood flow in the unstimulated hind limb was unchanged after stimulation. This study indicates that HVS of muscle does cause significant increases in blood flow to the stimulated rat hind limb.\r"

We developed a prototypal pelvic fixation system and compared it with a pelvic strap stabilization system. The prototypal pelvic fixation system consisted of fixation of the anterior superior iliac spines and sacrum, and the pelvic strap stabilization system consisted of a strap across the anterior superior iliac spines and a posterior pad. Small, but statistically significant, pelvic position changes occurred during isometric trunk extension and flexion muscle strength testing with the two stabilization systems. The pelvic angle changes were greater in extension than in flexion and greater when only the pelvic strap stabilization system rather than the prototypal pelvic fixation system was used. Our findings indicate that a more extensive prototypal pelvic fixation system minimizes pelvic movement to a greater extent during isometric trunk extension and flexion muscle contractions compared with the strap stabilization system.\r"

In 32 patients with locally recurrent carcinoma, the sensitivity of the barium enema examination was 88%; for CT it was 69%. Conversely, the barium enema examination was not useful for detecting remote metastases shown on CT, which disclosed disease at one or more sites in 47 (90%) of the 52 patients. CT best evaluated recurrences remote from the anastomosis, pelvic recurrences in patients with colostomies, and hepatic metastases.

Radiologic findings in the gastrointestinal tract included superficial or deep mucosal ulcerations, perforation or fistula formation, luminal narrowing, rigidity and thickening of the intestinal wall, and inflammatory infiltration of the mesentery. These were seen on barium examinations and computed tomographic (CT) scans. Findings of pancreatitis were seen on CT scans in one patient. In another, a cholangiogram showed abnormal bile ducts caused by CMV cholangitis.

Two patients had significant acute renal abnormalities, including one case of interstitial nephritis and one of renal vein thrombosis.

Thrombosis was seen in the portal circulation, the hepatic veins, and the intrahepatic inferior vena cava. It is known that concomitant portal vein thrombosis may be seen in 20% of patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome. Three of the four patients in the current study had this finding, one with extensive thrombosis of portal, mesenteric, and splenic veins and the other two with portal vein branch involvement. In one patient hepatic vein thrombosis was demonstrated with CT, and in three inferior vena cava clot was demonstrated. All four patients had the distinctive hepatic parenchymal contrast enhancement pattern seen in this condition, which the authors think may be at least partially caused by associated portal thrombosis. The presence of portal venous thrombosis should prompt the observer to consider the diagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome. Detection of hepatic vein clot confirms the diagnosis and may be seen in this condition in association with inferior vena cava thrombus.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-one patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were given either an intraarterial injection of iodized poppyseed oil (Lipiodol) alone (group A, n = 6), an emulsion of iodized oil and doxorubicin hydrochloride (Adriamycin) (group B, n = 15), or chemoembolization with the same emulsion followed by gelatin sponge (Gelfoam) particles (group C, n = 10). Hepatic resection was subsequently performed. The frequencies of complete necrosis of tumor in the main lesion, daughter tumors, tumor thrombus, and foci of intracapsular invasion were evaluated in the cut surface of the resected specimen. Group C demonstrated the best therapeutic effects, showing complete necrosis of the main lesion in 83% (P less than .01), daughter tumors in 53% (P less than .01), tumor thrombus in 17%, and foci of intracapsular invasion in 67%. These results are superior to those reported previously for chemoembolization without iodized oil. Group B showed better results than group A, but the difference was not significant. Iodized oil alone (group A) had practically no therapeutic effect but was helpful in differentiating small HCC from regenerative nodules.\r"

Specific causes for bleeding included lung abscess, chronic pneumonia, tuberculosis, lung cancer, and bronchiectasis. In 120 patients the hemoptysis was massive, with volumes exceeding 500 ml/day. The majority (n = 225) were treated during peak hemorrhage. Embolization was performed with one of three methods: particulate embolization with polyurethane or velour, obturation with the angiographic catheter combined with peripheral embolization by means of infused albumin macroaggregates, and regional infusion of sclerosing agents. Effective hemostasis was obtained initially in 278 patients (90.8%), including 87.5% of those treated during peak hemorrhage. In 26 of 28 cases without initial response, the pulmonary artery was the source of bleeding. Recurrent bleeding, within 1-4 days, requiring surgery was observed in 39 patients with initially successful hemostasis. Of 158 patients who were treated without surgery, subsequent episodes of hemoptysis occurred in 36. Combined methods of embolization may improve the efficacy of treatment of operable and inoperable patients with lung disease complicated by hemorrhage.\r"

In each case computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a large cerebral infarction confined to vascular territories associated with small subdural hematomas. There was no history or visible evidence of significant head trauma. Autopsy of one infant confirmed the presence of a hemispheric infarct, thin subdural hematoma, and an area of subintimal hemorrhage in the carotid artery ipsilateral to the infarct. The remaining two patients survived with residual hemiparesis. CT findings of a large cerebral infarction with an associated subdural hematoma in an infant without a history of a significant trauma should suggest the possibility of child abuse and may be the primary manifestation of abuse in some patients.\r"

T1-weighted images were obtained on a high-resolution, thin-section MR imaging system. When \"cystic-appearing\" lesions were found, T2-weighted images were obtained in order to better characterize the tumor. As in other areas of the body, MR images of parotid tumors are not usually histologically specific. MR findings may be distinctive in rare cases and define the internal architecture of complex parotid masses. Although poor tumor margination was a clue to malignancy, this was not a consistent finding. The real advantage of MR imaging in evaluating parotid masses was its ability to accurately reveal the extraparotid or intraparotid location of a tumor and demonstrate the relationship of the tumor to the facial nerve. Small and medium-sized mass lesions could be seen as superficial or deep to the facial nerve. Larger masses producing some distortion of the normal course of the nerve made identification of the nerve more difficult, if not impossible. In malignant tumors with gross invasion of the facial canal, MR images can show the extent of nerve involvement.\r"

Because contrast resolution is better with MR imaging, it appears to be superior to CT in distinguishing the parotid gland from surrounding structures. Four intraparotid lesions were more conspicuous on T2-weighted MR images than on CT scans.

Images were obtained at 0.5 T before and after the injection of Gd-DTPA (0.1 mmol/kg). Lesions were identified in eight of 12 precontrast and ten of 12 postcontrast studies. In these 12 patients adenomas were found at transsphenoidal surgery. The other patient, with normal images, was found to have an ectopic source of ACTH. Coronal images corresponded remarkably well with the neurosurgeon's intraoperative findings. Serial T1-weighted images disclosed early enhancement of the pituitary gland and delayed enhancement of the cystic adenomas. The discrepancy in times to peak enhancement accounted for improved lesion/pituitary contrast in some early images and for reversal or diminution of lesion/pituitary contrast in later images.\r"

Complete thrombosis was seen in three giant aneurysms in which high signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted images filled the lumen, and no flow effects were seen. Partial thrombosis was detected in four aneurysms as persistent areas of medium to high signal intensity within the lumen on T1- and T2-weighted images. In five cases, the cause of the intraluminal signal that was present was difficult to determine. The ability of MR to indicate flow within the lumen in 12 of 15 cases provided for greater diagnostic confidence than with CT, which was strongly suggestive of an extraaxial tumor in nine patients. Calcification of the wall of the aneurysm was better detected with CT.\r"

Likewise, in four patients diffuse cisternal enhancement on CT scans was not identifiable with MR. Nodular or focal cisternal masses were identified with both CT and MR imaging in three patients; in two, however, MR imaging provided less information. Ependymal and subependymal metastases identified with CT (two patients) were indistinguishable on MR images from periventricular abnormalities of radiation therapy and/or hydrocephalus. These findings suggest that leptomeningeal metastasis may be so subtle or inapparent as to be overlooked with MR imaging alone.

However, there were no occurrences of neuropsychiatric disorder, encephalopathy, or seizure. High-dose technique allows superior visualization of upper lumbar and conus detail and may be advantageous in patients with large subarachnoid spaces and in multi-level examinations. This study supports the results of previous trials that suggested the relative safety of iohexol as a contrast agent and extends those observations to a higher dose range. Because of the increased rate of adverse reactions at the highest dose levels (despite the absence of major adverse reactions), iohexol should continue to be used conservatively, with doses carefully tailored to each examination.\r"

Two of the cancers were seen on whole-breast mammograms, and six were seen on radiographs of thin-section specimens. Four of the 11 breast cancers were apparent only on histologic study of breast tissue that was not suggestive of malignancy. No cancer was found in subjects under the age of 39 years. Five carcinomas were found in the 40-69-year age group; six were found in the 70-year and over age group.

The reference consisted of a Min-R/OM1 combination (or its equivalent) exposed through a 4.5-cm thick breast via 28 kV and a molybdenum target-beryllium window tube with a 0.03-mm Mo filter. Radiographs of an improved breast phantom were used to relate computed relative SNR values of techniques to diameters of the smallest calcific and soft-tissue objects demonstrated in mammograms. Without use of a grid, four Mo target/filtration combinations yielded similar computed dose and SNR levels, as did a tungsten target tube operated at 23 kV without a filter. Operation of the latter tube at 27.5 kV with a 0.051-mm rhodium filter should reduce dose by half but also SNR by 22%. However, such operation with a grid should greatly improve imaging moderate to large breasts without increasing dose over reference values.\r"

Tomography demonstrated 85 of the 323 nodules to be calcified granulomas. The shape of the 238 uncalcified nodules was classified as benign, malignant, or indeterminate. None of the 38 nodules classified as benign proved to be malignant during 2 years of follow-up. Of the 33 nodules with a malignant shape, 31 proved to be malignant at operation or clinical follow-up. Among the 167 nodules characterized as indeterminate, 128 were benign and 39 were malignant on follow-up. In this series, the plain tomographic procedure, including fluoroscopy and repeat chest radiography, allowed an accurate diagnosis in 67% of solitary pulmonary opacities.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective review of chest radiographs from 205 patients with blunt chest trauma who also underwent aortography was performed. Forty-one of the 205 had aortographically proved aortic rupture. Discriminant analysis of 16 radiographic signs indicated that the most discriminating signs were loss of the aorticopulmonary window, abnormality of the aortic arch, rightward tracheal shift, and widening of the left paraspinal line without associated fracture. No single or combination of radiographic signs demonstrated sufficient sensitivity to indicate all cases of traumatic aortic rupture on plain chest radiographs without the performance of a large number of aortographically negative studies. The bedside anteroposterior \"erect\" view of the chest proved far more valuable than the supine view in detecting true-negative studies. Despite significant reader variability in the interpretation of the various radiographic signs, in general the analysis confirmed the role of chest radiography in this clinical situation, but suggests that its most beneficial use is in excluding the diagnosis and eliminating unwarranted aortography rather than in predicting aortic rupture.\r"

In three patients (13%) the radiographs showed nodular opacities that corresponded in size and configuration to nodules seen at autopsy. In 21 patients (87%) the lesions were not radiographically identifiable, in some cases because they were obscured by infection. The positive and negative predictive values of four radiographic findings for intrathoracic Kaposi sarcoma were evaluated, using a control group of 14 AIDS patients without intrathoracic Kaposi sarcoma at autopsy. Findings with a high positive predictive value were parenchymal nodular and reticular opacities (100%), pleural effusions (89%), and hilar and/or mediastinal lymphadenopathy (92%). None of these findings is specific, but the presence of any one in a patient with AIDS should increase the possibility of intrathoracic involvement by Kaposi sarcoma.\r"

It was proposed that the demonstration of normal ventilation in areas with matched radiographic opacity and perfusion defects does support the diagnosis of PE. To test this hypothesis, a retrospective review was done of selected cases from a consecutive series of 85 pulmonary angiography studies. Cases were reviewed if the following criteria were met: chest radiography, ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy, and angiography of the relevant regions had all been performed within 24 hours of one another, and there was a radiographic opacity corresponding to the perfusion defect. Sixteen cases fulfilled these criteria. Six patients had normal ventilation in the regions of the radiographic infiltrate and perfusion defect, and all had PE. No patient had an area of opacity and perfusion defect and normal ventilation without PE.\r"

Retrospective targeted reconstruction (25-cm field of view) improved spatial resolution, while magnification did not. The bone reconstruction algorithm improved spatial resolution, compared with the standard algorithm, and in patients, bone algorithm images were considered superior to standard reconstructions. Although using the bone algorithm increases the visible image noise, increasing the kilovolt peak and the milliamperage can reduce this noise. However, in the patients studied, this reduction in noise was not usually judged as significant, except in the posterior, paravertebral part of the lung. An optimal technique for CT of the lung parenchyma should include thin-collimation, targeted scans reconstructed with a high-spatial-frequency algorithm and, in some patients, increased kilovolt peak or milliamperage.\r"

Four patients with a true IFTO underwent fallopian tube recanalization: in the first two, a small soft-tipped guide wire was used, and in the other two, a guide wire and 3-F catheter were used.

Histologic findings were recorded on serial, axial diagrams to ensure precise pathologic correlation with the MR images. MR permitted identification of eight of 12 (67%) adenocarcinomas as hypointense foci (relative to the surrounding, higher intensity, peripheral zone); but tumor volume was under-estimated with MR imaging in five of eight cases (63%). Nodules of prostatic hyperplasia were identified correctly in only one of nine patients (11%). These findings suggest that, despite that fact that high field strength MR imaging currently does not depict all pathologic foci within the prostate, it may be of predictive value in the differential diagnosis of prostatic abnormalities when their locations are demonstrable.\r"

All eight cases of adenomyosis were correctly diagnosed from MR images. On T2-weighted MR images, diffuse adenomyosis appeared as a thickening of the junctional zone, whereas focal adenomyosis appeared as a low-signal-intensity mass poorly marginated from the adjacent myometrium. Ten of the 12 leiomyomas were correctly diagnosed from MR images. In the other two cases of leiomyoma, differentiation between focal adenomyosis and leiomyoma was not possible.

Of the 39 kidneys studied, 29 (74%) showed one or more changes on MR imaging: subcapsular or perinephric fluid (n = 10), focal (n = 16) or diffuse (n = 8) loss of the corticomedullary junction (CMJ), and focal areas of increased (n = 7) or decreased (n = 3) signal intensity. The CMJ changes were more prominent with increasing numbers of shock waves administered during the procedure. These relatively subtle changes detected on MR imaging may not be apparent with other imaging techniques. The long-term clinical significance of these findings is not yet known, although no apparent serious renal pathologic condition was detected.\r"

In both cases parts of each lesion had very low signal intensity on both short repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) sequences and long TR/TE sequences. Other portions of both lesions had intermediate signal intensity (equal to or higher than that of muscle but lower than that of fat) on short TR/TE sequences and increasing signal intensity on longer TR/TE images. In one case, the lesion also had a cystic component that showed MR changes typical of complex fluid. The authors propose that the MR signal characteristics demonstrated in these cases may be explained by the unique tissue components of the lesion, particularly hemosiderin and fat.\r"

The findings indicated that patients are sensitive to physicians' interpersonal styles and that they want physicians to explain procedures and results in an understandable manner and to monitor their well-being during procedures. The sample size of the study is small; thus further confirmation is needed.

One possible mechanism of the action of Au(I) compounds is that they protect unsaturated membrane lipids and proteins against oxidative degradation caused by activated phagocytes that are not properly regulated. In this study it has been shown that superoxide ion (O-2.), a product of activated phagocytes, can be oxidized to electronically excited singlet oxygen (O1(2)delta g), an agent that is capable of peroxidation of unsaturated fatty acid derivatives. It has also been shown that antiarthritic Au(I) compounds are effective deactivators of O1(2)delta g with quenching constants on the order of 10(7) M-1 sec-1.\r"

Although questions like these make an implicit demand to remember and enumerate specific autobiographical episodes, respondents frequently have trouble complying because of limits on their ability to recall. In these situations, respondents resort to inferences that use partial information from memory to construct a numeric answer. Results from cognitive psychology can be useful in understanding and investigating these phenomena. In particular, cognitive research can help in identifying situations that inhibit or facilitate recall and can reveal inferences that affect the accuracy of respondents' answers.\r"

Now a polypeptide with comparable chromatographic behavior and biological activity has been purified from the rat H-540 Leydig cell tumor in quantities sufficient for amino acid sequencing. The activator contains 30 amino acid residues and has a molecular weight of 3215. The synthetic construct based on this sequence is virtually equipotent with native H-540 tumor SAP in an adrenal mitochondrial cholesterol side-chain cleavage assay. Hormonal regulation of the intracellular concentration of this activator may control the rate of cholesterol metabolism in steroidogenic organs.\r"

Experiments on chemically skinned single fibers from rabbit psoas muscle with pH ranging between 6 and 7.25 demonstrate that the depression of maximal calcium-activated force by inorganic phosphate correlates nicely with the concentration of the acidic (diprotonated) species. Therefore, in addition to the well-known depressant effect on the contractile machinery of lowering pH per se, any decrease of intracellular pH associated with fatigue further depresses force production by converting more of the total inorganic phosphate within the cell to the inhibitory diprotonated form.\r"

IGF messenger RNAs were localized to perisinusoidal cells of liver, to perichondrium of cartilage, to sclera of eye, and to connective tissue layers, sheaths, septa, and capsules of each organ and tissue. All of the hybridizing regions are comprised predominantly of fibroblasts or other cells of mesenchymal origin.

The excitatory postsynaptic potentials are depressed by an antagonist of excitatory amino acids.

A set of ten heptad elements, characteristic of alpha-helical coiled coils, is a striking feature of the central part of each derived amino acid sequence.

After 2 weeks of continuous pumping, the mean stroke work of the SMVs was 0.4 X 10(6) ergs, a performance that compares favorably with the animal's cardiac ventricles. This study shows that canine skeletal muscle which has not received prior training or electrical conditioning can perform sustained work at the high levels needed for an auxiliary cardiovascular pump. It might be possible eventually to use such muscle pumps in humans to assist the failing circulation and to provide support in children with certain types of congenital heart defects.\r"

Studies of the adopted-away children of alcoholics show that the predisposition to initiate alcohol-seeking behavior is genetically different from susceptibility to loss of control after drinking begins. Alcohol-seeking behavior is a special case of exploratory appetitive behavior and involves different neurogenetic processes than do susceptibility to behavioral tolerance and dependence on the antianxiety or sedative effects of alcohol. Three dimensions of personality have been described that may reflect individual differences in brain systems modulating the activation, maintenance, and inhibition of behavioral responses to the effects of alcohol and other environmental stimuli. These personality traits distinguish alcoholics with different patterns of behavioral, neurophysiological, and neuropharmacological responses to alcohol.\r"

  ".W": "Transcriptional enhancement is a general mechanism for regulation of gene expression in which particular proteins bound to specific DNA sequences stimulate the efficiency of initiation from linked promoters. One such protein, the glucocorticoid receptor, mediates enhancement in a glucocorticoid hormone-dependent manner. In this study, a region of the 795-amino acid rat glucocorticoid receptor that is active in transcriptional enhancement was identified. The active region was defined by expressing various receptor deletion mutants in stably and transiently transfected cells and examining the regulated transcription of hormone-responsive genes. Mutant receptors lacking as many as 439 amino-terminal amino acids retained activity, as did those with as many as 270 carboxyl-terminal amino acids deleted. This suggests that the 86-amino acid segment between the most extensive terminal deletions, which also includes sequences required for specific DNA binding in vitro, is sufficient for enhancer activation. In fact, a 150-amino acid receptor fragment that encompasses this segment mediates constitutive enhancement.\r"

Continuous scintillation camera imaging showed that reovirus serotypes 1 and 3 were cleared from the circulation in less than 10 minutes by specific and distinct target organs. Reovirus serotype 1 accumulated predominantly in the lungs and the liver, whereas serotype 3 accumulated in the liver and the spleen with very little virus uptake by the lungs. Incubation of reovirus serotype 1 with a monoclonal antibody directed against the viral hemagglutinin before injection totally inhibited the clearance of the virus by the lungs. Similar results were obtained when viruses biolabeled with 35S were used. These results demonstrate that viruses can be rapidly transported through the bloodstream to specific target organs and that the localization of the viruses depends on the interaction between specific viral surface components and the target organ.\r"

This assay measures the frequency of variant erythrocytes produced by erythroid precursor cells with mutations that result in a loss of gene expression at the polymorphic glycophorin A (GPA) locus. Significant linear relations between variant frequency (VF) and radiation exposure were observed for three different variant cell phenotypes. The spontaneous and induced VFs agree with previous measurements of radiation-induced mutagenesis in other systems; this evidence supports a mutational origin for variant cells characterized by a loss of GPA expression and suggests that the GPA assay system may provide a cumulative dosimeter of past radiation exposures. VFs for some survivors differ dramatically from the calculated dose response, and these deviations appear to result primarily from statistical fluctuations in the number of mutations in the stem-cell pool. These fluctuations allow one to estimate the number of long-lived hemopoietic stem cells in humans.\r"

Different categories of these cells were influenced by dominance (presumably indicated by the presence and size of horns), breed and familiarity, and threatening faces such as those of humans and dogs.

Cellular heterogeneity in the content of this glucocorticoid receptor-like molecule was evident. By immunoadsorption to antibody-coated tissue culture plates, the cells were separated into populations positive (100%) and depleted (38%) for this membrane antigen. Gel electrophoresis, specific immunoblot, and autoradiographic (binding of [3H]dexamethasone mesylate) analysis of the membrane proteins from the membrane antigen-positive group revealed multiple protein bands ranging in size from 85 to 145 kilodaltons. Furthermore, comparison of the glucocorticoid sensitivity of these groups of cells showed complete lysis of the membrane antigen-positive cells and only partial lysis of the antigen-deficient group, which suggests that the lysis response of cells to glucocorticoids is mediated by a glucocorticoid receptor-like molecule located in the plasma membrane.\r"

Of these, four were in elective cases (7%) and the remainder (21%) were in the urgent group. A major complication more than doubled the average hospital stay to 29 days. There were three deaths (3% of the entire group), all in patients who had emergency exploration, and all in patients over age 70. We advocate earlier elective cholecystectomy for patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis--before patients reach an older age, when associated systemic diseases increase their overall risk should emergency operation be necessary.\r"

Four had reduction in pulmonary valve gradients from 67 +/- 9 mm Hg to 39 +/- 9 mm Hg (P less than .01), whereas one patient with a dysplastic pulmonary valve did not. Operative evaluation of the pulmonary valves revealed the morphologic effects of the balloon forces on the stenotic valves to be commissure splitting in one patient, cusp tear in one patient, and a combination of commissure splitting and cusp avulsion in two patients. There were no deaths. Patients with combined infundibular and pulmonary valve stenosis have a high potential for cusp avulsion due to fixation of the balloon in the infundibulum and retraction of the balloon into the ventricle during systole. Echocardiography, cardiac catheterization pressure gradients, and cineangiography should be used to assess infundibular stenosis and avoid percutaneous balloon angioplasty in patients who have combined pulmonary valve stenosis and infundibular pulmonary stenosis.\r"

Percutaneous intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT) and angiodilatation have afforded limb salvage in some of these patients. Proper patient selection appears to be the hallmark of success with IAT. During a recent three-year period, we used IAT in 32 extremities in 28 patients who had acute arterial insufficiency. Before IAT, 16 extremities were painful at rest, and 16 had incapacitating claudication. The overall success rate was 38%, but some degree of thrombolysis occurred in 88%. Limb salvage was achieved in 27 of 32 extremities (84%). Only five of 17 limbs (29%) with arterial graft thrombosis required no operation or an operation of lesser magnitude than predicted before IAT. Of six extremities with native arterial embolism, four (67%) were completely cleared with IAT. Major complications occurred in eight cases (25%), with two IAT-related deaths (6%). This study suggests that IAT is best reserved for individuals with acute limb ischemia caused by arterial embolus, those whose degree of ischemia would tolerate a 24-hour trial of IAT, and those whose femoral or tibial runoff is not likely to require remedial operation.\r"

All six infants who were 30 to 34 weeks gestation and referred after 1979 survived. Severe pneumonia at admission decreased from 24 to 11 per cent in two five year periods. Delayed primary anastomosis and Livaditis circular myotomy overcame many problems of the \"long gap\" associated with pure esophageal atresia, resulting in successful anastomosis in all eight patients treated in the latter years.

Although still controversial, the results of several studies have shown a possible influence of a local decrease in gastric somatostatin in the physiopathologic characteristics of peptic ulcer disease. In the present study, immunoreactive SS content (SLI) of antral (SLI-a), corpal (SLI-c) and fundic (SLI-f) mucosal extracts was measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) in control patients (C) and in those patients with duodenal ulcer (DU) or gastric ulcer (GU) to further study a possible role of SS in peptic ulcer disease. Fifty-five patients (C = 20, DU = 21 and GU = 14) were included in the study. Gastric mucosal samples were obtained either by endoscopic biopsy (4.6 +/- 0.2 milligrams of weight) or operation (52.3 +/- 3.8 milligrams of weight). RIA was performed after a modified Arimura's method and results were expressed as nanograms per milligram of tissue plus or minus standard error of the mean. Chromatographic analysis of gastric mucosal extracts was performed on a Sephadex G-25 fine column. A great interindividual variation in SLI levels was observed (a range of 0.02 to 5.30 nanograms per milligram of weight). The mean SLI concentrations were: C (SLI-a, 2.55 +/- 0.45, SLI-c, 0.99 +/- 0.46 and SLI-f, 1.03 +/- 0.21); DU (SLI-a, 0.48 +/- 0.16, SLI-c, 0.43 +/- 0.13, and SLI-f, 0.58 +/- 0.12), and GU (SLI-a, 1.10 +/- 0.25, SLI-c, 0.40 +/- 0.10, and SLI-f, 0.81 +/- 0.24). Significantly greater amounts of SLI contents were found in the antrum of control patients as compared with those found in the corpus or fundus (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01, respectively). SLI-a levels were lower in peptic ulcer patients (DU, p less than 0.001 and GU, p less than 0.05) than in control patients. There was also a significant difference between SLI-a levels in DU versus GU patients (p less than 0.05). No significant differences were found in SLI-c and SLI-f contents in all three groups studied. In conclusion, these results suggest that decreased SS levels in antral gastric mucosa could be the alteration underlying the various physiopathologic mechanisms involved in the development of peptic ulcer disease.\r"

This information is important for planning strategies to enhance tumor drug uptake and to improve tumor response to therapy. Dye injection studies have demonstrated hepatic tumor vascular supplies in an anatomic manner, but offer no physiologic data. To evaluate hepatic drug distribution in patients with metastases to the liver and colon and rectum (6-3H) 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR) and 99m-technetium (TC) macroaggregated albumin (MAA) were infused through the hepatic artery prior to lobectomy of the right hepatic lobe in three patients and before wedge resection of a metastasis in one patient. Forty to 100 specimens of the tumor and liver taken at biopsy were assayed in order to map drug and albumin distribution. Nuclide scanning of the specimen was performed upon two patients. A linear relationship between levels of 3H (representing fluoropyrimidine metabolites) and 99mTc (representing blood flow) was demonstrated in both the tumor (correlation coefficients 0.69 to 0.87, p less than 0.01) and liver (correlation coefficients 0.76 to 0.90, p less than 0.001). The liver immediately adjacent to the tumor retained substantially more 99mTc-MAA than either the tumor itself or liver remote from the tumor, as demonstrated by both nuclide scanning and tissue biopsies. The rim of the liver adjacent to the tumor with enhanced 99mTc uptake had a different histologic appearance from a \"normal\" liver at a distance from the tumor in all instances. A radionuclide hepatic scan showing increased tumor uptake of 99mTc-MAA after arterial injection predicts an increased likelihood of tumor response to treatment. The results of this study demonstrate for the first time, in human beings, that increased 3H-FUdR uptake occurs in portions of the tumor which retain more 99mTc-MAA and explains the capacity of the arterial 99mTc-MAA perfusion scan to predict tumor response in the treatment of metastases to the liver and colon and rectum.\r"

  ".U": "87178637\r", 
  ".W": "Several instances of fatal postoperative tetanus have been reported, and it has recently been stated that failure to secure adequate immunization for surgical patients may have medicolegal repercussions. In order to investigate according to which criteria for the immunization surgical patients can be considered protected, 178 patients who were more than 50 years of age and who were admitted electively during one year to two surgical departments were studied. To investigate immunity relative vaccination history, all patients admitted during the first two months were offered participation in this study. One hundred and twenty-seven (86 per cent) of these patients were studied by detailed registration of vaccination history and determination of antitoxin concentration in serum. Forty-seven per cent had never been vaccinated against tetanus and 67 per cent had antitoxin concentrations in serum below the protective level. To investigate in detail the duration of immunity and the effect of revaccination, patients with documented complete primary vaccination only were studied during the entire period. An additional 51 patients have been entered into the study during the last ten months. Antibody concentration in the serum corresponded to a continuous fall off in immunity after vaccination. Patients who had received a complete three dose primary vaccination within the last five years or a revaccination within the last ten years were well protected. Forty-four patients received revaccination during the study and were controlled by blood sample four weeks later. Every patient obtained satisfactory antibody concentrations, and it was concluded that no special requirements in recommendations for vaccination are needed, even for elderly patients. Thirteen patients who underwent extensive surgical procedures had serial blood samples taken every three days. Antitoxin concentrations in serum increased sigmoidally with time, and the slow initial increase suggested that revaccination should optimally be given some days before the operation to assure protection in the first few postoperative days.\r"

  ".U": "87178638\r", 
  ".W": "Two hundred and seventy-five patients with advanced carcinoma of the stomach invading the serosa were morphovolumetrically classified into three types: funnel, column and mountain. The funnel type, in which cancer cells narrowly invaded the deep wall compared with the extent of spread in the mucosa, was associated with less frequent metastases and a better prognosis (five year survival rate of 49 per cent). The column type, in which cancer cells invaded the deep wall as wide as the mucosa, and the mountain type, in which cancer cells widely invaded the deep wall, were associated with high frequent metastases and a poor prognosis (five year survival rates of 17 and 13 per cent, respectively). Division was also made into expanding and infiltrative types. In patients with the column type, those with infiltrative type had a poorer outcome than did those with the expanding type, while patients with the funnel type had a better prognosis than those with the other two types, regardless of the infiltration and expansion. The expanding type had a propensity for metastases to the liver and infiltrative type for peritoneal seeding. Combination of these classifications provides a prognostic evaluation and assessment of the behavior of advanced carcinoma of the stomach.\r"

Subcutaneously implanted hollow cylindrical cellulose sponges were used as an inductive matrix for the growth of granulation tissue. The control implants were injected immediately after implantation with 1 milliliter of physiologic saline solution while the experimental implants were injected with a corresponding volume of saline solution containing live micrococci 10(7) microorganisms per milliliter. Cytologic and bacteriologic analyses of wound fluid aspirated from the central dead space of the implants were carried out three, seven and 14 days after implantation. Local blood flow and albumin extravasation were measured on day seven and granulation tissue grown into the implants was analyzed chemically on days seven and 14. No macroscopic infection with pus formation occurred, while Micrococcus varians was cultured from each inoculated implant. In the inoculated implants, the number of wound fluid neutrophils, granulation tissue blood flow and albumin extravasation increased significantly above the control level. Correspondingly, the amounts of granulation tissue deoxyribonucleic acid, nitrogen, collagen hydroxyproline, hexosamines and uronic acids in the inoculated implants exceeded significantly the control value on both days seven and 14. To conclude, inoculation of experimental wounds with nonpathogenic Micrococcus varians organisms enhanced local inflammatory reaction and blood flow, and promoted granulation tissue formation.\r"

The complete liquid diet was identical to more traditional clear liquid diets in terms of cleanliness of the intestine and general profile of bacterial flora. This complete diet was well accepted by patients and was superior in its provision of energy, protein, vitamins, minerals and nitrogen. The use of this low residue supplemental diet was associated with a statistically earlier return of intestinal function and a trend toward shorter length of hospitalization. The results of this study indicate that low residue nutritionally complete liquid diets not only offer comparable mechanical cleanliness but also outstanding nutritional advantages not obtained with traditional preparatory diets.\r"

Unemployment increased after both severe and mild injuries, while employment status changed more frequently after severe injuries. Age had a minimal effect on neuropsychological and employment outcomes after minor head injuries (GCS greater than 13). The findings suggest that regardless of acute severity, closed head injury influences long-term quality of survival.\r"

Peak systolic, peak diastolic, and mean flow velocity values are analyzed from fast-Fourier transformed (FFT) Doppler spectra at selected depths for 50 presumed normal subjects ranging in age from 22 to 79 years. Interindividual variation is high for peak flow but moderate for mean flow velocity values, which hence are more likely to discriminate normal from abnormal. Flow velocity values within the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) and the basilar artery (BA) are significantly lower than in the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and the middle cerebral artery (MCA), which is also unique in showing significantly decreasing values with increasing age: calculated mean flow velocities are 47.3 +/- 13.6 and 45.3 +/- 13.5 cm/sec in the ACA, and 58.4 +/- 8.4 and 44.7 +/- 11.1 cm/sec in the MCA in patients less than 40 years and greater than 60 years, respectively, but 34.2 +/- 7.8 and 29.9 +/- 9.3 (PCA) (patients less than 40 years and patients greater than 60 years), and 34.9 +/- 7.8 and 30.5 +/- 12.4 (BA) (patients less than 40 years and patients greater than 60 years). A new scanning system is introduced, which we suggest will reduce interindividual variations and improve the accurate separation of nearby vessels, which are major causes for the comparatively large standard deviations at present.\r"

We present a review of the literature from 1911 to 1984 with respect to 372 patients with MVT, including five of our own patients. Data on 99 of these patients were obtained from autopsy reports and were not included in the study. This disease is common in the sixth and seventh decades of life, with 81% of these older patients having associated illnesses. MVT involves segments of the small bowel, but rarely of the colon, with hemorrhagic infarcts rather than gangrene. This disease does not conform to a pattern, although a prodromal period of days or weeks of abdominal pain (which is usually out of proportion to physical findings), marked leukocytosis, and dehydration are all highly suggestive of MVT. Serosanguineous fluid obtained by means of peritoneal tap is a useful diagnostic tool. A high index of suspicion, early diagnosis, and prompt surgical intervention with the addition of anticoagulants seems to improve survival and reduce recurrence.\r"

This prospective clinical study compared two groups of patients (n = 13) receiving either a 25% BCAA solution or a 45% BCAA solution at 30 kcal/kg/day and 1.5 gm protein/kg/day for 7 days after operation. Whole-body nitrogen balance and forearm muscle amino acid and ketoacid flux were measured. There were no significant differences between the two groups in mean cumulative nitrogen balance (+13.1 gm versus +18.0 gm) between the two groups. Patients receiving the 45% BCAA solution had significant mean uptake of total BCAA, leucine, and isoleucine compared with results in patients receiving the 25% BCAA solution. Despite this increased uptake of BCAA in the 45% BCAA group, there was no increased efflux of alanine, glutamine, or the BCAA ketoacids, ketoisocaproic, ketoisovaleric, or ketomethylvaleric. However, increased release of aspartate was noted in the 45% BCAA group compared with the 25% BCAA group. Thus use of a 45% BCAA-enriched solution infused in patients after surgery results in a significant increase in forearm muscle uptake of the BCAA that is not demonstrated in whole-body nitrogen economics.\r"

  ".U": "87178700\r", 
  ".W": "The circular stapler has lowered the leakage rate of an esophageal anastomosis to a level hitherto achieved by only a few surgeons performing hand anastomosis on selected patients with carcinoma of the esophagus. However, the esophageal anastomosis performed with a stapler is also associated with a high stricture rate. Our prospective study was conducted to determine the leakage rate and the incidence of stricture after esophagogastric anastomosis was performed with a stapler, the relationship of stricture to the size of the stapler, and the risk of stricture in relation to time. In a group of 174 patients with carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus, resection was performed, and a one-stage esophagogastric anastomosis was constructed. There were 33 hand anastomoses, 64 anastomoses with an EEA stapler (U.S. Surgical Corp., Norwalk, Conn.), and 77 anastomoses with an ILS stapler (Ethicon Ltd., Edinburgh, U.K.). The anastomotic leakage rate was 3.4% (6/174); 3% with the hand technique and 3.5% with the stapler technique (4.7% for the EEA and 2.6% for the ILS). After leakages and hospital deaths were excluded, 133 discharged patients were evaluated for the occurrence of anastomotic strictures. Only those who complained of dysphagia were investigated. The incidence of stricture for hand anastomosis was 8.7%-EEA 20% and ILS 10%; the overall incidence of anastomoses with a stapler was 14.5%. The true incidence would probably be higher if all patients were assessed by endoscopic or radiologic examination after operation. All three sizes of EEA staplers had a high incidence of stricture. For the ILS stapler the 25 mm size had the highest stricture rate (28.6%) of all groups, but for the 29 and 33 mm sizes, the incidences were 5.3% and 0%, respectively. Actuarial analysis showed an increasing risk of stricture with a reduction in the size of stapler used and was 32.5% and 35%, respectively, for the ILS 25 mm and EEA 25 mm staplers at 131/2 months. The risk of stricture occurrence was highest in the first 4 months. Treatment by bougienage was satisfactory. In conclusion, esophagogastric anastomosis performed with a stapler is a very safe procedure with respect to leakage but is associated with a high risk of stricture, except when the largest ILS staplers are used. However, dilatation readily overcomes the stricture occurrence and adequately compensates for the reduced leakage rate and its attendant serious consequences.\r"

Because adequate tissue oxygenation is necessary for wound healing and resistance to infection, we postulate that hemodialysis may contribute to the wound morbidity frequently seen in dialyzed patients.\r"

Since this is also a function of arterial inflow rate, we have tested the hypothesis that uncorrected for arterial inflow, these tests may be misleading. Change in venous foot volume after elevation and on exercise was measured in 44 subjects. Arterial inflow was also determined. In a few patients arterial flow was varied by cooling or by exercise. The times of half-volume restoration were measured. Calculated were: the rate of total blood flow into the foot; the rate of venous regurgitation; and \"venous sufficiency indices\" for elevation and for exercise with and without correction for arterial inflow rate. These indices combine volume and time data in a single numeric value. Volume change on elevation was uninfluenced by the rate of arterial inflow. Volume change on exercise and the halftime of volume restoration varied significantly with the rate of arterial inflow as did the \"venous sufficiency indices.\" These variances were significantly reduced by correcting for arterial inflow rate. We conclude that for foot volume studies to measure regurgitation and for data obtained at different times to be comparable, corrections must be made for the rate of arterial inflow to the foot.\r"

Acid perfusion stimulated blood flow to the duodenal wall in a concentration-dependent fashion up to 80 mmol/L HCl (0 mmol/L; 0.44 +/- 0.05, 10 mmol/L; 0.84 +/- 0.14, 50 mmol/L; 1.44 +/- 0.11, 80 mmol/L; 2.03 +/- 0.12, 100 mmol/L; 1.82 +/- 0.07 ml/gm/min X +/- SEM). The pH in the lamina propria of the mucosa, which was measured with antimony microelectrodes was not changed in experiments during perfusion with 50 and with 80 mmol/L HCl in normotension. Acidosis in the lamina propria could be demonstrated only when the duodenum was perfused with 100 and with 80 mmol/L HCl combined with hemorrhagic hypotension. Damage to the mucosa, which developed after 30 and 60 minutes of acid perfusion, also showed a H+-dependent pattern. Reduction of blood flow by hemorrhagic hypotension aggravated the morphologic damage. We conclude that luminal acid stimulates blood flow in the duodenum. The decrease in blood flow induced by hypotension results in a greater susceptibility to mucosal damage.\r"

An identical graft, lacking only the FN coating, was implanted as a control in the contralateral carotid artery. A second group of 10 dogs was similarly treated, but each animal received 2 grains of aspirin and 50 mg of dipyridamole (Persantine) daily, beginning 3 days before surgery and continuing for the duration of the experiment. By means of a quantitative, gamma-camera, platelet adherence to the grafts was studied for 5 days after implantation. Graft patency was assessed with the Doppler velocity meter and was confirmed by surgical reexploration when thrombosis was suspected. FN coating increased platelet adhesion to the grafts in animals untreated with aspirin by a factor of threefold to fivefold. In those animals receiving antiplatelet drugs, patency of FN-coated grafts at 5 days was significantly (p less than 0.05) higher (80%) than in untreated animals (27.2%). In addition, mean platelet deposition on the grafts in these animals was reduced compared with untreated controls. Thus although FN coating of PTFE grafts significantly increases their affinity for platelets, this effect can be effectively abolished by pretreatment with aspirin and dipyridamole.\r"

An important diagnostic triad has emerged, which should alert the physician to the possibility of a complicated hepatic hemangioma: the clinical signs of an acute inflammatory liver process contrasted with a normal white blood cell count and liver function tests. Hemangiomas of the left lobe were either missed or poorly demonstrated on selective hepatic angiographic examination, and in two patients the diagnosis was made only at the time of laparotomy. Hepatic resection was successfully performed in all patients; there was minimal morbidity and none of the patients died. In two patients with multiple hemangiomas, only symptomatic or easily resectable lesions were removed. All patients are alive and well; three have been followed up for more than 5 years. We conclude that resection in asymptomatic cases should be carried out only in those cases that require a diagnostic laparotomy and in those where the lesion is easily resectable. The majority of patients with symptomatic and complicated tumors should undergo resection, but even in these patients continued conservative treatment is appropriate when the risk of major resection outweighs the small risk of live-threatening bleeding.\r"

  ".W": "Both clinical and experimental evidence suggest that the time course of edema formation is different from that of edema resolution. To better describe and quantify this difference, we followed the accumulation of high-pressure pulmonary edema in live dogs with the thermal-green dye (TGD) double-indicator technique at steady-state levels of lung liquid. We raised left atrial pressure (PLa) in steps of 5 to 10 mm Hg as high as 25 mm Hg and followed edema to steady-state levels. Lung water was then measured as PLa was lowered to initial values. By plotting steady-state edema against PLa, pressure-volume relationships were constructed. There was little change in edema until PLa reached approximately 15 mm Hg, at which point further changes in PLa were associated with large increases in lung liquid. At PLa = 25 mm/kg, the average lung water had increased by 10 ml/kg. In each animal there was slow resolution of edema with decreases in PLa from its peak back to its initial value, but in no animal was edema fully reabsorbed even though PLa was maintained at about 5 mm Hg for as long as 10 hours. Several possible explanations account for these observations. Water could be trapped in alveolar and central interstitial spaces. In addition, vessel closure in edematous lung units could further influence water reabsorption. These observations raise the possibility that pulmonary edema in the presence of normal filling pressures may represent resolution of a transient high-pressure edema as opposed to a capillary leak syndrome.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine the long-term biologic fate of these neoarteries that were regenerated in PU/PLLA vascular grafts. The PU/PLLA vascular grafts (1.5 mm internal diameter [ID]) were implanted into the abdominal aortas of rats (N = 8) and were evaluated 1 year after implantation by means of macroscopic inspection, light microscopy, and electron microscopy. All implants were patent; three implants were normally shaped, two were slightly dilated (+/- 10% of the original ID), and three implants were aneurysmal. Arterial pulsations were reduced but still visible in the normally shaped implants and absent in the other implants. In all implants, the neointima was complete. The neomedia varied among the implants: In the normally shaped implants, smooth muscle cells were predominantly circularly arranged as in normal arterial tissue; in the other implants, smooth muscle cells were predominantly longitudinally arranged. The neoadventitia showed a completely fragmented graft lattice, which was organized by fibrohistiocytic tissue. These results suggest that the pattern of arrangement of smooth muscle cells in the neomedia determines the ultimate biologic fate of neoarteries regenerated in microporous, compliant, biodegradable vascular grafts. Only those neoarteries with predominantly circularly arranged smooth muscle cells in the neomedia were able to function normally as an arterial substitute for a 1-year period after implantation into the rat abdominal aorta.\r"

It provides a detailed analysis of the influence of preoperative factors and the postoperative blood pressure response to fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events during follow-up. All patients suffered from severe hypertension. Arteriosclerosis was limited to the renal arteries in 52% of the patients, while 48% showed overt extrarenal arteriosclerosis. Hypertensive target organ damage was present in 68% of the patients. At a mean of 8.5 months postoperatively, 80% of the patients showed beneficial and 20% showed unsatisfactory blood pressure responses. These results were not related to the presence or absence of extrarenal arteriosclerosis. Overall, late (10 years) patient survival was significantly lower than the expected survival of a reference population (79% versus 92%; p less than 0.0001). Late patient survival was not influenced by the absence or presence of extrarenal arteriosclerosis (82% versus 82%) or target organ damage (83% versus 82%), but late survival was significantly better with beneficial (87%) than with unsatisfactory blood pressure responses (67%). This effect was especially conspicuous in the presence of extrarenal arteriosclerosis (88% versus 57%; p = 0.04) but not in its absence (86% versus 74%; p = 0.41). In terms of long-term survival, these findings clearly demonstrate the favorable effect of successful surgical treatment of patients with renovascular hypertension caused by arteriosclerosis. Moreover, they illustrate that the mere presence of preoperative extrarenal arteriosclerosis or target organ damage is not sufficient argument against surgical therapy.\r"
