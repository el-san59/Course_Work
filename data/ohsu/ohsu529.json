  ".W": "In a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we examined the effect of mountain cedar (MC) immunotherapy on the MC-induced late cutaneous response (LCR). Fourteen MC-sensitive patients were intradermally skin tested before and after immunotherapy with MC extract. We measured the size of the wheal at 15 minutes and the area of tissue swelling at 6 hours. Patients were matched by the size of the LCR and started receiving either MC immunotherapy or placebo immunotherapy. MC-specific immunoglobulins (MC sIgG, MC sIgG1, MC sIgG4, and MC sIgE) were measured by ELISA. Symptom-medication scores (SMSs) were recorded on a daily basis during the MC season and tabulated at the end of the study. Comparison of the 14 paired patients revealed no significant differences between MC-treated and placebo-treated groups in preimmunotherapy MC sIgG1 and SIgG4. However, when MC immunotherapy was compared to placebo immunotherapy, patients receiving MC immunotherapy developed significantly higher MC sIgG1 (p less than 0.04) and MC sIgG4 (p less than 0.01) after immunotherapy. Patients receiving MC immunotherapy also demonstrated significantly greater suppression of the LCR after immunotherapy (p less than 0.005) with the postimmunotherapy LCR correlating significantly with both MC sIgG4 (rs = 0.715; p = 0.008) and cumulative dose of MC received (rs = 0.808; p = 0.004). MC sIgE was similar in both groups after immunotherapy. The reduction in SMSs in the MC-treated group did not reach significance, nor was there a correlation of SMSs with MC sIgE, sIgG, sIgG1, or sIgG4.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The two most common symptoms of this inflammatory disorder observed at entry to a hospital are headaches and mild memory deficits. Further progression of this disease may result in focal neurologic alterations and seizures. Currently, the most common laboratory abnormality noted is an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The complement (C) system is known to play a role in many inflammatory processes; it may also be involved in CNS vasculitis. In this longitudinal study of patients with CNS vasculitis, we detected C activation by highly sensitive and specific assays that are capable of identifying breakdown products formed after C activation: C3a des arg, C4a des arg, C5a des arg, C1rC1s-C1-inhibitor complex, and terminal C complex (C5b-9). We present two cases of documented CNS vasculitis in which serial measurements of these C-activation products correlate with disease activity. Our results indicate that a temporal association exists between C activation and the clinical presentation of CNS vasculitis. We conclude that physicians should monitor C-activation by-products in plasma when they attempt to follow the clinical course of CNS vasculitis.\r"

We present in this article the results of an 8-year pollen count in the atmosphere of Naples, Italy. The pollen content was examined with a volumetric spore trap (Lanzoni VPPS-2000) like that of Hirst. The results of the pollen counts were subsequently compared with results of skin tests of patients born and still living in and around Naples to determine the pollinosis of that area. We found that the most important allergenic pollen in the Naples area is Parietaria, with very long-lasting periods of pollination. The first period, more important, occurring from March to July, and the second period of much lower intensity, occurring from the end of August to the end of October. Pollen allergy to Parietaria was found to be present in 82.02% of pollen-allergic patients. It was followed by Gramineae (32.12%), Olea (23.11%), and Artemisia vulgaris (17.08%). These data are quite different from data of the pollinosis in northern Italy and in the northern Mediterranean area, as well as the southern coast of France, where allergic sensitization to Poaceae is the most important.\r"

This randomized crossover study consisted of two phases separated by a 1-week washout period. All subjects fasted 10 hours preceding drug administration. Each subject received two 4 mg albuterol repeat-action tablets with and without a high fat content breakfast. Plasma albuterol concentrations were determined by a gas chromatographic/mass spectrophotometric assay. Relative bioavailability was assessed by comparing areas under the plasma-albuterol concentration time curves as well as peak concentrations and time to peak concentration. No significant differences were noted between the two treatment phases in the area under the curve or peak plasma concentrations. The areas under the curve were 100 and 105 hr.ng/ml when the drug was administered with and without food, respectively. The corresponding peak plasma concentration values were 9.4 and 10.4 ng/ml, respectively. The only significant difference observed was in the maximum time to reach peak plasma concentrations, which was delayed by about 1 hour when the drug was administered with food. Therefore, food has minimal effect on the absorption of albuterol from repeat-action tablets.\r"

The outcome of the RAST was found to be strongly dependent on how the isocyanate test antigen was synthesized. Specific IgE from selected workers with isocyanate asthma reacted optimally to conjugates with less than or equal to 10 isocyanate molecules bound per molecule of human serum albumin. Further haptenization resulted in decreased specific binding and increased nonspecific binding because of high levels of total IgE. The hapten and carrier specificity of isocyanate-induced IgE antibodies were studied by direct RAST and RAST inhibition. The existence of new antigenic determinants related to both the isocyanate hapten and the carrier could be demonstrated. It was important to use a test antigen prepared from the same isocyanate as that to which the worker had been exposed, since the cross-reactivity between different isocyanate haptens was partial and varied from one patient to another. It was confirmed that isocyanate-specific IgE antibodies can be demonstrated only in a subgroup of workers with isocyanate-related bronchial asthma.\r"

This monoclonal antibody was obtained by immunizing mice with whole Lolium perenne-pollen extract and by screening the antibody producing hybrids for reactivity with Dactylis glomerata-pollen extract. Grass 4B1 is physicochemically separable from the group I allergen. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies to grass 4B1 do not react with group I allergen or vice versa. Ninety-five sera with IgE antibodies to grass pollen were tested for IgE antibodies to grass 4B1, and greater than 90% was positive in this test.

  ".W": "Adenosine-5'-monophosphate (AMP) is a bronchoconstrictor agonist in subjects with atopic and nonatopic asthma. In this study we have investigated the effect of repeated airway challenge with AMP in 10 atopic, subjects without asthma. At the first visit, subjects had repeated inhalation challenges with increasing doubling concentrations of AMP, and the provocation concentration required to reduce FEV1 by 20% of baseline was determined (PC20 AMP). When the FEV1 had returned to within 5% of the baseline, the AMP challenge test was repeated on a further one or two occasions. When the maximum concentration of AMP (400 mg/ml) failed to produce a PC20, a bronchial provocation test with histamine was performed and the PC20 was determined. On the second visit, the effect of three consecutive inhalation challenge tests with histamine on the airway response to this agonist was determined. On the third visit, the duration of induced refractoriness to AMP was assessed. With the first AMP challenge, all subjects demonstrated bronchoconstriction with a geometric mean (GM) PC20 of 332 mg/ml. With a second AMP challenge, five of the 10 subjects became refractory and failed to achieve a PC20. In the remaining five subjects, the GM PC20 increased from 110 to 583 mg/ml. With a third AMP challenge, these subjects also failed to achieve a PC20. The initial GM PC20 histamine for the group was 22.9 mg/ml, which did not change significantly with two further histamine challenges or when the airways were refractory to AMP, suggesting that loss of AMP effect was not related to loss of contractility of airway smooth muscle or down regulation of H1-histamine receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although these programs have been in existence since the 1950s, there has been no systematic study of their effectiveness. The purpose of the present study was to determine outcome in 103 children discharged consecutively after a long-term hospitalization. These children had both severe asthma and significant psychologic problems. Eighty-three of the 103 children had required continuous or frequent intermittent steroids for asthma control. In the year before admission, they had been hospitalized for asthma a mean of 2.6 times for 11.8 days and had had 4.6 visits to emergency rooms and 6.6 visits to physician offices for acute wheezing. Use of medical resources for asthma decreased significantly in the year after long-term hospitalization compared to the year before hospitalization (hospitalization: -34%, p less than 0.0001; hospital days: -39%, p less than 0.0002; emergency room visits: -46%, p less than 0.00001; physician office visits for acute asthma, -42%; p less than 0.00001; and a composite score giving increasing weight to more intensive and costly care: -30%, p less than 0.0001). Long-term hospitalization for children with asthma not responsive to outpatient management is associated with improvement in their use of medical resources.\r"

Two heat-stable protein allergens, designated as Sa-I and Sa-II, were identified from boiled shrimp (Penaeus indicus) extracts. Sa-I was isolated by ultrafiltration, Sephadex G-25, and diethylaminoethyl-Sephacel chromatography, whereas, Sa-II, the major allergen, was purified by successive chromatography on diethylaminoethyl-Sephacel, Bio-Gel P-200, and Sepharose 4B columns. Sa-I, was homogeneous by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), elicited a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE corresponding to a molecular weight of 8.2 kd. Sa-II was also found to be homogeneous by PAGE, crossed immunoelectrophoresis, and immunoblotting. On sodium dodecyl sulfate- PAGE, it elicited a single band with a molecular weight of 34 kd. Sa-II was found to contain 301 amino acid residues and was particularly rich in glutamate/glutamate and aspartate/asparagine. Solid-phase radioimmunoassay-inhibition studies revealed that Sa-I and Sa-II share 54% of the allergenic epitopes, suggesting that Sa-I may be a fragment of Sa-II.\r"

All patients were followed by use of the skin prick test (SPT), allergen and histamine bronchial challenges, and tests for allergen-specific IgE, IgG1, and IgG4 levels. In the group treated with active extracts for 2 years (group A), the previously reported decrease in bronchial responsiveness to cat extract (p less than 0.001) and histamine (p less than 0.01) was even more pronounced after the second year. After 1 year of active treatment in the original placebo group (group B), a significant decrease in the bronchial responsiveness to cat extract was noted (p less than 0.001). The responsiveness to histamine was decreased only in the patients treated with cat-dander extracts (p less than 0.05). A significant decrease in the SPT (p less than 0.001) and an increase in the allergen-specific IgE (p less than 0.001) and IgG4 (p less than 0.001) was also noted in patients (group B) treated with cat-dander extracts.

To study the molecular basis of these associations, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) mapping was performed on a group of 45 white ragweed-allergic patients with full-length HLA-DR beta, DQ beta, and DQ alpha cDNA probes. The data on 41 of these subjects were used for the purposes of statistical analysis. With the DR beta probe, we found that the presence of three polymorphic restriction fragments correlated with responsiveness to Amb a V and with the DR2 specificity, namely, a 6.5 kb Eco RI fragment, a 9.4 kb Hind III fragment, and a 2.2 kb Hind III fragment. The presence of four fragments detected with the DQ beta probe correlated with responsiveness to Amb a V and with Dw2 specificity: a 2.3 kb Eco RI fragment, a 13.0 kb Pst I fragment, a 2.9 kb Taq I fragment, and a 5.2 kb Eco RV fragment. The DR beta Eco RI 6.5 kb and the DQ beta Eco RI 2.3 kb fragments were studied in detail; the concordant presence of these fragments was even more strongly associated with responsiveness to Amb a V. Fifteen of 17 responders had both fragments, whereas only one of 24 nonresponders had both fragments (p = 5 x 10(-7). This is the first time that such an association has been found between a person's immune response to a well-defined antigen and a set of HLA class II DNA restriction fragments.\r"

This study examined the effects of serum theophylline levels of 10 to 20 mg/L and the administration of a placebo on selected measures of physical performance and work capacity to determine any ergogenic outcomes. Seven male and three female elite athletes from a variety of team sports and aged 18 to 30 years participated in the study. The variables measured were height, mass, maximal oxygen consumption, muscular endurance, muscular power, muscular strength, FVC, FEV1, and reaction time. When the scores obtained after ingestion of theophylline and a placebo with a double-blind, crossover technique were compared, no significant difference was found for any of these variables. A two-way analysis of variance of FEV1 scores obtained before and after maximal exercise revealed no significant \"F\" ratios. This indicated that none of these trained athletes demonstrated exercise-induced asthma and that there was no difference in airway resistance after maximal exercise while they were under the influence of theophylline or placebo. We conclude that no ergogenic effects were attributable to theophylline therapy which should therefore remain an acceptable means of management of athletes with asthma participating in international sporting events.\r"

Ten athletes with asthma (15 to 30 years of age) undertook 8 minutes of submaximal exercise (80% of anaerobic threshold) on the treadmill ergometer, once after inhaling rimiterol and once after inhaling a placebo. Treatment with all bronchodilator drugs was stopped for the 12 hours preceding each exercise test. Two puffs (400 micrograms) of rimiterol or placebo were administered in a double-blind crossover manner 2 minutes before each exercise test. Lung function measurements were made before exercise and immediately, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 minutes after completion of exercise. The results of a two-way analysis of variance revealed significant (p less than 0.01) difference in the FEV1 scores obtained after rimiterol inhalation and placebo inhalation, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 minutes after cessation of exercise. After inhalation of rimiterol, there were no significant changes in FEV1. After inhaling the placebo, significant reductions (p less than 0.01) in FEV1 occurred after cessation of exercise (5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes). All subjects exhibited EIA after placebo, and none after rimiterol. The mean maximum drop after exercise in FEV1 after inhalation of rimiterol (2.807 +/- 5.55) and placebo (24.54 +/- 8.4) was significantly different (t = 6.849). It was concluded that inhalation of rimiterol 2 minutes before exercise afforded significant protection from EIA in all subjects tested.\r"

  ".W": "A selected candidate international standard preparation of birch (Betula verrucosa)-pollen extract was studied together with other birch-pollen extracts in a multinational study involving 20 laboratories in 11 countries. The biologic activity of the extract had previously been demonstrated in quantitative skin prick testing. The study methods comprised RAST inhibition, histamine release, quantitative immunoelectrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, and other methods. The results from RAST inhibition were calculated as parallel-line assays with statistical tests for linearity and parallelism. Analysis of variance was applied to test the significance of differences between potency estimates. In all assay methods, the candidate standard could be used to assign relative potencies to other birch-pollen extracts. The candidate standard was adequately stable during 36 months of storage at or below 5 degrees C. On the basis of this study, the World Health Organization has established the preparation as the International Standard for birch-pollen extract with assigned units of 100,000 IU per ampule.\r"

  ".U": "89109899\r", 
  ".W": "We have investigated the effects of BN 52021 (a specific PAF antagonist derived from Ginkgo biloba) on PAF-induced human eosinophil and neutrophil chemotaxis. In response to an optimal concentration of PAF (10(-6) mol/L), the drug was significantly more potent (p less than 0.001) in inhibiting eosinophil as compared to neutrophil locomotion. These inhibitory effects were observed in a dose-dependent manner with a concentration of drug required to produce 50% inhibition of 7.0 (+/- 2.2) X 10(-6) mol/L and 2.3 (+/- 0.2) X 10(-5) mol/L for eosinophils and neutrophils, respectively. Sodium cromoglycate, nedocromil sodium, salbutamol, and dexamethasone (preincubated with cells up to 6 hours) had no effect over a wide dose range (10(-3) to 10(-9) mol/L). BN 52021 was significantly more effective in inhibiting chemotaxis when the cells were preincubated with the compound for up to 1 hour before commencement of the locomotion assay, whereas washing the cells completely abolished this effect. Inhibition by BN 52021 was specific for PAF in that it had no effect on chemotaxis induced by either leukotriene B4, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, or a purified human mononuclear cell-derived neutrophil chemotactic factor. BN 52021 also inhibited the specific binding of [3H]-PAF (10(-8) mol/L) to eosinophils and neutrophils in a concentration-dependent fashion with a concentration of drug required to produce 50% inhibition of 1.5 (+/- 0.3) X 10(-6) mol/L and 9.1 (+/- 2.5) X 10(-7) mol/L, respectively. These results suggest that BN 52021 has potential as an anti-inflammatory agent in conditions associated with PAF-induced accumulation of neutrophils and eosinophils.\r"

Antibiotic treatment resulted in relief of headaches in 94% of group I, 75% of group II, and 5% of group III patients. The distribution of sinus infections found by both rhinoscopy and radiography were similar; however, rhinoscopy may have found the disease earlier than radiography. Flexible fiberoptic rhinoscopy is an efficient method for the office diagnosis of sinusitis.\r"

  ".W": "Classical transplantation Ag are found on nearly all cells, whereas Ag encoded by the genes of the Qa/Tla region have a restricted tissue distribution. To investigate the cause of these different patterns of expression, we have compared the regulatory regions of Q10, a Qa region gene that is expressed only in liver, with those of H-2Ld. Gel retardation analysis shows that the nuclear factor (rI) that binds to the inverted repeat (TGGGGATTCCCCA) of the class I regulatory element (CRE) present in H-2Ld and other classical class I genes does not bind to the equivalent region of the Q10 gene. However, the Q10 CRE binds another nuclear factor (rII) that binds to the H-2Ld CRE. The sequence of the Q10 CRE differs from the sequence present in classical class I genes by three nucleotides, two of these changes are within the inverted repeat sequence (TGaGGAcTCCCCA) and disrupt the region of dyad symmetry. We have used site-specific in vitro mutagenesis to individually change these two nucleotides and have investigated the ability of this region to promote transcription with and without these substitutions. A change of either base restores transcriptional activity in chloramphenicol acetyl transferase assays and allows for binding of the rI nuclear factor. These results suggest that the failure of the Q10 CRE to bind the rI nuclear factor may play a role in preventing Q10 expression in tissues other than the liver and fetal yolk sac. Thus, the dichotomy between the widespread tissue expression of classical class I genes and the restricted tissue expression of class I genes of the Qa/Tla region may be due in part to differences in the cis acting regulatory sequences that interact with trans-acting nuclear factors to direct transcription.\r"

Murine rTNF-alpha administration not only reduced the decline of neutrophil and total blood cell counts after radiation, but also accelerated the subsequent normalization of peripheral blood cell counts. This was accompanied by accelerated regeneration of primitive hematopoietic progenitors, as determined by the in vivo spleen CFU assay, and the in vitro assay of the more mature hematopoietic cell compartment. This demonstrates that pretreatment with murine rTNF-alpha enhances hematopoietic reconstitution after sublethal irradiation, and indicates a possible therapeutic potential for this agent in the treatment of radiation-induced myelo-suppression.\r"

It was polymerized and able to bind to C3IBb-Sepharose but not to C3i-Sepharose. No extracellular precursor was present. The intracellular form, detected between 1 and 4 h after labeling, was similar but had a slightly lower Mr. It also bound reversibly to C3iBb-Sepharose, and polymers could be demonstrated by cross-linking. Pulse-chase experiments suggested the existence of an earlier, but undetectable, intracellular precursor(s). This form could not be immunoprecipitated even when harsh solubilization conditions and/or antibodies against reduced and denatured P were utilized. Studies with endoglycosidases F and H and tunicamycin indicated that the detectable intracellular precursor contains high mannose N-linked carbohydrate that is processed to the complex form before secretion. The sugars are not required for polymerization, secretion, or functional activity, or responsible for the electrophoretic heterogeneity. Polymerization of P is therefore an early intracellular event, perhaps carefully controlled to prevent anomalous aggregation.\r"

The addition of fetal bovine serum to melanoma and astrocytoma cells growing in synthetic medium (insulin-transferrin-selenium) resulted in reactivity with Ab32-27M. As antibody 32-27M detects N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuGc)-containing gangliosides, the effect of adding a number of different gangliosides to melanoma and astrocytoma cells cultured in the synthetic medium was studied. Only the addition of NeuGc-GM3 resulted in the development of Ab32-27M reactivity. The identity of the antigenic structures developed after addition of fetal bovine serum or NeuGc-GM3 was determined by analysis of the gangliosides from both samples. The major component detected in melanoma cell lines was shown to be N-acetylneuraminic acid-NeuGc-GD3. Another, slower moving component, present in some melanomas and in astrocytomas may be N-acetylneuraminic acid-NeuGc-GD2. The cell type specificity for these processes can be most readily explained by postulating that all cells can take up exogenous gangliosides but only melanoma and astrocytoma cells have sufficiently high levels of GM3 alpha 2----8-sialyltransferase for the conversion of added NeuGc-GM3 to disialogangliosides to be effective. These results demonstrate a novel pathway for exogenous glycolipid processing that can lead to novel Ag expression but may also play a role in normal glycolipid metabolism and function.\r"

  ".U": "89110061\r", 
  ".W": "It has been previously demonstrated that maley-lated-BSA (maleyl-albumin) induces functional activation in murine peritoneal macrophages. Furthermore, maleyl-albumin has been shown to interact with two distinct sites on human monocytes; one site is the scavenger receptor, a 260-kDa oligomeric protein which recognizes modified forms of low density lipoprotein (LDL), and the second is a lower affinity site which has yet to be structurally characterized. In the present study, we wished to quantitatively assess the number and character of maleyl-albumin-binding sites on murine peritoneal macrophages and to determine which site or sites are involved in signaling the macrophage to undergo extensive functional development. Binding studies. demonstrate at least two distinct receptors for maleyl-albumin on murine peritoneal macrophages. Scatchard analyses of the binding isotherms reveal two sites characterized by dissociation constants (Kd) of 17.6 nM and 4.9 microM and maximal binding of 1.2 x 10(5) and 1 x 10(6) sites/cell, respectively. The contribution of the scavenger receptor, determined by binding analyses of malondialdehyde-LDL, is described by two sites with Kd of 39.4 pM and 9.6 nM, and maximal binding of 2.7 x 10(3) and 1.9 x 10(4) sites/cell, respectively. Maleyl-albumin blocks binding of malondialdehyde-LDL, whereas modified LDL fails to inhibit binding of maleyl-albumin. Maleyl-albumin, at concentrations producing lower affinity binding, stimulates tumor cytolysis, expression of mRNA encoding TNF, and suppression of INF-gamma-induced expression of Ia Ag. Malondialdehyde-LDL fails to elicit these responses. We conclude that macrophage activation produced by maleyl-albumin is mediated by interaction with the low affinity, high capacity binding site for maleyl-albumin rather than the scavenger receptor.\r"

Antibodies in 78% of sera from HTLV-I seropositive subjects reacted with synthetic peptide 4A (amino acids 190 to 209) from a central region of HTLV-I gp46. Human anti-HTLV-I antibodies also bound to synthetic peptides 6 (29% of sera) and 7 (18% of sera) from a C-terminal region of gp46 (amino acids 296 to 312) and an N-terminal region of gp21 (amino acids 374 to 392), respectively. mAb 1C11 raised to affinity-purified HTLV-I gp46 reacted with gp46 external envelope glycoprotein and gp63 envelope precursor in immunoblot assay and also bound to the surface of HTLV-I+ cells lines HUT-102 and MT-2. Antibody 1C11 did not react with HTLV-II or HIV-infected cells or with a broad panel of normal human tissues or cell lines. In competitive RIA, anti-gp46 antibody 1C11 was inhibited from binding to gp46 either by antibodies from HTLV-I seropositive subjects or by HTLV-I env-encoded synthetic peptide 4A, indicating that 1C11 bound to or near a site on gp46 within amino acids 190 to 209 also recognized by antibodies from HTLV-I-seropositive individuals. When tested in syncytium inhibition assay, mAb 1C11 did not neutralize the infectivity of HTLV-I. Thus, HTLV-I infection in man is associated with a major antibody response to a region of gp46 within amino acids 190 to 209 that is on the surface of virus-infected cells.\r"

Parasites were surface iodinated and cultured in the presence or absence of a crude phospholipase C (PLC) preparation or phosphatidylinositol-specific PLC (PIPLC). Culture supernatants were then analyzed: 1) by centrifugation to ascertain which molecules released from the surface were soluble or contained in membrane vesicles; 2) by immunoprecipitation with antibodies specific for the \"cross-reacting determinant,\" an epitope revealed on some GPI-anchored proteins only after cleavage of the diacylglycerol from the protein by PIPLC, and 3) by immunoprecipitation with immune mouse sera to establish co-identity with previously described, immunologically relevant surface Ag. By using these techniques, schistosomula were shown to possess three GPI-anchored surface Ag of m.w. 38,000, 32,000 and 18,000 which are spontaneously released from the surface of schistosomula in association with membrane, but remain insoluble until cleaved by PIPLC. All three molecules were recognized by antibodies from mice vaccinated with irradiated cercariae and/or chronically infected mice. Moreover, the m.w. 38,000 component was recognized by a previously described protective mAb (E.1). A major developmental modification appears to occur in the expression of these molecules because, by the same techniques, no GPI-anchored surface Ag were detectable on 7-day-old lung stage parasites. The finding that these important parasite immunogens are GPI-anchored and released from the surface of the parasite in membrane vesicles may, in part, explain why they elicit strong immune responses capable of damaging the schistosomulum tegument.\r"

Clinical information was obtained on 282 sexually active female and 54 male patients aged between 14 and 44 years presenting for either asymptomatic physical examination or urogenital symptoms at a community-based family practice clinic that primarily serves middle socioeconomic class patients. A direct fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal antibody staining test for C trachomatis was found to be positive in 34 (12 percent) of 282 women and 15 (28 percent) of 54 men. Two (11 percent) of 19 pregnant women were found to be infected. Significantly more women presenting with urogenital symptoms or as a sexual contact of a symptomatic partner or those with abnormal findings on physical examination were found to have a positive test than were those who had no symptoms and no abnormal findings on physical examination. Similar trends were found in men, but were not statistically significant. It is recommended that primary care physicians presumptively treat those patients who have urogenital symptoms or have been exposed to sexual partners with urogenital symptoms and test asymptomatic patients who have signs of a possible C trachomatis infection.\r"

Twenty-two family physicians responded to a mail survey in which they selected from among their respective practices a sample of patients whose care they considered to be particularly difficult. This sampling procedure resulted in a total of 205 difficult patients. Physicians' perceptions of these patients were obtained through ratings of the applicability of 40 behavioral and physical characteristics drawn from the literature. Factor analysis of these data resulted in the identification of two factors underlying physicians' perceptions of difficult patients: medical uncertainty, characterized by particularly vague, difficult to describe, undifferentiated medical problems; and interpersonal difficulty, reflected in a perceived abrasive behavioral style. In addition, physicians self-rated the importance of various motivations for practicing medicine. The top six ranked mean ratings indicate that the primary motivations for practicing medicine were satisfaction derived from solving medical problems and the desire to help people. The interaction of these physician and patient characteristics is offered as a partial explanation for the development of difficult physician-patient relationships.\r"

For all 21 situations, physicians' estimates of patients' responses were significantly lower than physicians' preferred response ratings. The physicians' estimates and preferences regarding patients' interest in family conferences were compared with actual patients' ratings obtained in a previous study. The patient ratings were significantly greater than the physicians' estimates of patient ratings for 14 of 21 situations; the physicians' preferences ratings were significantly higher than the actual patient ratings for 11 situations and lower for three situations. The mean number of actual family conferences conducted in the previous month was 2.6, and 66 percent of respondents had conducted at least one such conference during this time. These data indicate that physicians may be more interested in family conferences than their patients are, but that they may underestimate the degree to which patients do, in fact, want them. The implications of these data for teaching, practice, and research are discussed.\r"

Patients entering two primary care clinics (N = 239) completed a questionnaire assessing their interest in physician level of involvement for each of six representative clinical situations: hospitalization for serious illness, new diagnosis of serious illness, depression, marital or relationship problems, stress-related symptoms, and frequent visits without improvement. Most patients indicated that they would want family conferences with their primary physician if a family member experienced hospitalization, new diagnosis of a serious illness, or depression. Slightly less than one half of the patients indicated that they would want family conferences for the remaining situations. Among those patients desiring family conferences, majorities responded that they would want their primary physician to provide all of Doherty and Baird's levels 2 through 5 (ongoing medical information and advice, feelings and support, systematic assessment and planned intervention, and family therapy), especially for hospitalization for serious illness and for depression. Most patients who indicated that they would want their physician to provide family therapy in the family conference also responded that they would want referral to a mental health professional for family therapy. The implications of these findings for clinical practice, residency training, and future research are discussed.\r"

Previous analyses of outpatient data demonstrated that the frequency of visits to the clinic of primary care, acute care clinic, emergency room, and consultant clinics were all significantly higher for patients randomized to internal medicine compared with family practice. In the present study, patients' charts were reviewed for information regarding hospitalizations. During the 3.4-year study period, there were a total of 61 hospital admissions for internal medicine (35 of 249 patients), and 58 for family practice (27 to 271 patients). Age (mean 47 years) and sex of patients in both groups were equivalent. The average total cost of hospitalization for each patient was greater for those randomized to the Internal Medicine Clinic: $7,193 for internal medicine patients as compared with $5,764 for family practice patients. The professional costs per hospitalization showed greater variation: $913 for Internal Medicine Clinic patients and $629 for Family Practice Clinic patients. Internal Medicine Clinic patients had a longer mean length of hospitalization (7.5 days) when compared with that of Family Practice Clinic patients (6.3 days). It can be concluded that in this clinical environment the hospitalization patterns are different for patients assigned to the Internal Medicine Clinic compared with the Family Practice Clinic: both cost and length of care for hospitalization are less for those followed by the Family Practice Clinic.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this study was to evaluate different approaches to the diagnosis of post-operative myocardial infarction. A total of 232 patients, mostly hypertensive and/or diabetic patients, who were undergoing elective non-cardiac surgery were evaluated pre-operatively. They were followed serially from the day of operation to discharge or the sixth post-operative day with daily clinical evaluations, electrocardiograms, creatine kinase and creatine kinase isoenzymes. In total 22% (51/232) of the patients had post-operative ECG changes in two or more leads. Only 1% developed new Q waves; most of the changes involved changes in the T or ST segments. Seventy percent of patients who had changes in their electrocardiogram were completely asymptomatic. The highest risk of ECG changes or symptoms occurred on the day of operation and the first post-operative day; evidence of post-operative infarction was infrequent after the second post-operative day. Creatine kinase levels rose an average of 250-300 IU on the first and second post-operative day (also the peak time for post-operative ECG changes), reducing its utility as an adjunct to the diagnosis of post-operative infarctions. Importantly, 52% (12/23) of the patients who had greater than or equal to 5% MB isoenzyme had neither ECG changes nor symptoms; the diagnosis of a myocardial infarction should not be made in these patients. In summary, most patients who experience ischemia or infarction post-operatively are asymptomatic. Symptoms should not be required for the diagnosis of post-operative infarction. Seemingly minor differences in criteria can produce major discrepancies in post-operative myocardial infarction rates (from 1 to 9%). The development of a final set of criteria will require further study but the diagnosis of post-operative infarction should probably be based on ECG changes, their duration and consistency, and the association of a positive MB fraction.\r"

The hazard for mortality from the index stroke was high initially, but declined to a negligible level by 6 months post-stroke. In contrast, hazards for mortality from subsequent strokes, cardiac diseases and non-cardiovascular causes each peaked midway through the first year, declined during the remainder of that year, and then increased in the latter part of the follow-up. Proportional hazards analysis indicated that advanced age and increased stroke severity were the only factors significantly related to increased risk from each of the four causes of death. Other risk factors were significant only for one or two select causes of death. White patients were less likely to die from subsequent strokes, but more likely to die from cardiac diseases, than were non-white patients (primarily blacks). Males were more likely to die from both the index stroke and non-cardiovascular causes than females. A history of cardiac disease increased the risk of death from both the index stroke and from future cardiac events, while a history of hypertension or diabetes increased the risk of death from non-cardiovascular causes, and a history of previous stroke increased the risk of death from subsequent stroke.\r"

These criteria focus on the internal structure of a method rather than its output. When we assessed the published methods by these criteria most of the methods failed most of the criteria. We believe that the problem and its solution lie at a fundamental level--real understanding of the true nature of causality assessment, which we suggest is an inherently subjective evaluation based on the multiple uncertainties that an assessor has about a case and not an objective attribute of the drug-event connection that can be determined from unambiguous evidence elicited in response to \"operational questions\".\r"

One method, a screening questionnaire, was used to identify women with CM, and two others, a symptom severity questionnaire and a daily diary, were used prospectively to record the severity of symptoms in relation to the menstrual cycle. The screening questionnaire was assessed for test-retest reliability and for agreement between the recalled severity of symptoms and those recorded during prospective measurement. The symptom severity questionnaire and diary were assessed by examining their ability to discriminate between pre- and postmenstrual phases of the menstrual cycle, differences in symptom severity at these times being the cardinal feature of CM. Test-retest reliability of premenstrual symptoms by the screening questionnaire gave correlation coefficients over 0.70 for 9 of the 11 items assessed. The symptom severity questionnaire showed significant differences between pre- and post-menstrual scores for 8 of the 11 items assessed and the diary for each of the 2 items assessed. Comparison of symptom severity as recalled and as prospectively recorded showed only modest agreement. These results show that the instruments used to assess symptom severity performed satisfactorily but that the screening questionnaire used to identify women with CM, although reliable, correlated only moderately well with prospective measurement.\r"

The reliability of respondents' reports can be greatly improved by employing a well-established screening scale composed of multiple replicate items. A practical question that arises is whether interview time can be saved by using only a portion of the original scale. The cost of shortening established scales in terms of the sensitivity and specificity of the screen is modelled statistically, and the robustness of the model is assessed using mental health data obtained on samples of psychiatric patients and community controls. Both the statistical model and the empirical examples suggest that items from highly reliable measures can be dropped without much loss in sensitivity or specificity. Suggestions are made for selecting subsets of items when shortening a screening scale and these are illustrated with screening scales for depression.\r"

In contrast, clinical medicine deals with individual, tailor-made (\"private\") hypotheses; the uncertainty (e.g. the diagnosis or recurrence risk in relatives) is ontological, and the main feature of the analysis is probability. The same logical rules are at times mistakenly applied to both. Disregard of these subtleties may lead to paradoxes, contradictions, and at times diastrously false conclusion. The basic principles and distinctions are laid out with illustrations that are most readily provided from medical genetics, but apply to all branches of medicine.\r"

However, this observation failed to predict compensatory growth patterns that produce many of the deformities recognized as features of individual syndromes. The deformities resulting from premature closure of a coronal, sagittal, metopic, or lambdoid suture can be predicted on the basis of the following observations: 1) cranial vault bones that are prematurely fused secondary to single suture closure act as a single bone plate with decreased growth potential; 2) asymmetrical bone deposition occurs mainly at perimeter sutures, with increased bone deposition directed away from the bone plate; 3) sutures adjacent to the prematurely fused suture compensate in growth more than those sutures not contiguous with the closed suture; and 4) enhanced symmetrical bone deposition occurs along both sides of a non-perimeter suture that is a continuation of the prematurely closed suture. These observations regarding growth in craniosynostosis are illustrated with clinical material in this report.\r"

Over an 18-year period, 141 patients with GSW's were evaluated, 90 of whom were operated on; 75 of the surgical cases were followed for 2 years or more. Thirty operative patients had initial vascular repair, while eight required thoracotomies. Total plexus palsy was present in 19 of those selected for operation. The average interval between injury and operation was 17 weeks. Six patients required early operation for an expanding aneurysm with progressive neural loss. Persistent complete loss of function in the distribution of one or more elements and/or noncausalgic pain not managed by medications provided the major operative indications. Four patients required sympathectomies for causalgia. Of 166 lesions in continuity believed to be complete, based on clinical examination and electromyography, 48 with preserved intraoperative nerve action potentials (NAP's) were spared resection or were treated with a split repair with excellent eventual results on a weighted grading system. By comparison, only seven of 55 elements believed to have incomplete loss or to be recovering did not have NAP's and required repair. Fifty-three of 98 lesions repaired by grafts and 18 of 26 wounds with suture repair recovered to a Grade 3 level or better. Most elements were in continuity but 14 were found \"blown apart\" and required repair, usually by grafting. The best outcome was achieved with upper trunk and lateral and posterior cord lesions, but recovery occurred with some C-7 to middle trunk and medial cord to median repairs. Results with lower trunk and most medial cord lesions were poor unless early regeneration was proved by operative NAP's, in which case either neurolysis or split repair could be performed. Surgery is warranted for selected GSW's to the plexus.\r"

The mean polyol content in the control samples showed that the fructose, inositol, and glucitol levels were significantly greater in CSF than in serum. A comparison of the lumbar CSF from control subjects and 11 patients with malignant tumors exposed to the CSF showed the fructose and inositol levels to be significantly lower (54% and 45%, respectively) and the glucose content to be slightly higher (110%) in the tumor cases. These differences were markedly greater in the ventricular than in the lumbar CSF and greater in patients with tumors exposed to the CSF space than in those with tumors buried in the brain tissue. In ventricular CSF obtained from seven patients with malignant brain tumors before and after radio- and/or chemotherapy, significant increases in fructose (34%) and glucitol (48%) levels were found, but the other polyols did not change significantly. In culture, the human glioblastoma cell growth rate was higher in the medium containing fructose and glucose than in that containing glucose alone. A notable amount of fructose and glucose was consumed by cultured glioblastoma cells. The roles of polyols contained in CSF and the effects of fructose on the growth of cultured glioblastoma cells are discussed in light of these findings and of previous reports.\r"

Eleven patients subsequently received radiation therapy to the whole brain, 30 to 44 Gy. Before radiation therapy, eight patients responded completely and four partially; there was one non-responder. The median Karnofsky score before high-dose MTX therapy was 60 and increased to 90 after treatment. Five of the eight complete responders reached a Karnofsky rating of 100. The three longest responders (one of whom received MTX only) were without recurrence of their disease at 29+, 32, and 32+ months posttherapy. The median response period is 9+ months. The median survival time from the date of the first MTX treatment is 9+ months, and the three longest survival times are 29+, 32+, and 54+ months.

These patients commonly fulfill the laboratory criteria of the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) or cerebral salt wasting; the classification depends on the volume status of the patient. The authors have been dissatisfied with the standard therapy of fluid restriction for the critically ill neurosurgical patient because of 1) slow rates of sodium correction; 2) poor applicability in patients requiring multiple intravenous medications and/or nutritional support; and 3) possible dangers of inducing or enhancing cerebral ischemia in patients who already may be fluid-depleted. Reported successes in the treatment of hyponatremia due to SIADH by administration of urea and normal saline led to the authors' routine use of this therapy for hyponatremic neurosurgical patients. A retrospective review of an 18-month period revealed 48 patients (3% of all neurosurgical inpatients) with hyponatremia from various causes who received 62 treatments of urea and normal saline. Treatment consisted of 40 gm urea dissolved in 100 to 150 ml normal saline as an intravenous drip every 8 hours and an intravenous infusion of normal saline at 60 to 100 ml/hr for 1 to 2 days. The mean pretreatment serum sodium level (+/- standard deviation) was 130 +/- 3 mmol/liter (range from 119 to 134 mmol/liter). There was a significant mean posttreatment elevation to 138 +/- 4 mmol/liter (range 129 to 148 mmol/liter) (p less than 0.001, Student's t-test). Average daily fluid intake and output on treatment days were 2719 +/- 912 and 2892 +/- 1357 ml, respectively. There were no treatment complications in this group. It is concluded that urea and saline administration results in a rapid, safe, and effective correction of hyponatremia, making this method superior to fluid restriction in many neurosurgical patients.\r"

  ".W": "Eight patients undergoing an end-to-side vertebral artery (VA) to common carotid artery transposition between August, 1979, and July, 1982, had a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) interposition graft placed when a direct anastomosis was believed not to be satisfactory. Five of these patients are living; clinical and radiographic follow-up studies over periods ranging between 54 and 82 months show that their transpositions are patent. Two patients died perioperatively, one from an acute anterior myocardial infarction and the other from acute VA occlusion with a propagating thrombus. A third patient died of myocardial infarction 20 months after graft placement; the anastomosis had been found patent at 12 months. This report gives the clinical and radiographic follow-up results in a previously reported group of patients with PTFE interposition grafts. Some of these patients have been followed for over 6 years after surgery: the average radiographic follow-up period in the five survivors is 60 months, and all grafts are patent without evidence of progressive stenosis. Expanded PTFE appears to be an acceptable material for short interposition grafts in operations involving the VA; however, direct artery-to-artery anastomosis is preferred. The results of longer PTFE grafts in reconstructive cerebrovascular surgery have not been adequately studied.\r"

  ".U": "89110432\r", 
  ".W": "In a series of 32 surgical cases of carotid-ophthalmic artery aneurysm, seven of the lesions were located in the \"carotid cave.\" This special type of aneurysm is usually small and projects medially on the anteroposterior view of the angiogram. At surgery, it is located intradurally at the dural penetration of the internal carotid artery (ICA) on the ventromedial side, appears to be buried in the dural pouch (carotid cave), and is often difficult to find, dissect, and clip. The aneurysm extends into the cavernous sinus space, and the parent ICA penetrates the dural ring obliquely. An ipsilateral pterional approach was used in all 32 cases, and ring clips were used exclusively because the aneurysms were located ventromedially. Clipping was successful in five cases. All patients returned to their preoperative occupation, although vision worsened postoperatively in two cases. The technical steps required for successful obliteration of this aneurysm are summarized as follows: 1) exposure of the cervical ICA; 2) unroofing of the optic canal and removal of the anterior clinoid process; 3) exploration of the ICA around the dural ring and opening of the cavernous sinus; 4) direct retraction of the ICA and optic nerve; and 5) application of multiple ring clips to conform to the natural curvature of the carotid artery; a curved-blade ring clip is especially useful. The relevant topographic anatomy is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis that cerebral arteriovenous difference of oxygen content (AVDO2) can be used to predict cerebral blood flow (CBF) was tested in patients who were comatose due to head injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or cerebrovascular disease. In 51 patients CBF was measured daily for 3 to 5 days, and in 49 patients CBF was measured every 8 hours for 5 to 10 days after injury. In the latter group of patients, when a low CBF (less than or equal to 0.2 ml/gm/min) or an increased level of cerebral lactate production (CMRL) (less than or equal to -0.06 mumol/gm/min) was encountered, therapy was instituted to increase CBF, and measurements of CBF, AVDO2, and arteriovenous difference of lactate content (AVDL) were repeated. When data from all patients were analyzed, including those with cerebral ischemia and those without, AVDO2 had only a modest correlation with CBF (r = -0.24 in 578 measurements, p less than 0.01). When patients with ischemia, indicated by an increased CMRL, were excluded from the analysis, CBF and AVDO2 had a much improved correlation (r = -0.74 in 313 measurements, p less than 0.01). Most patients with a very low CBF would have been misclassified as having a normal or increased CBF based on the AVDO2 alone. However, when measurements of AVDO2 were supplemented with AVDL, four distinct CBF patterns could be distinguished. Patients with an ischemia/infarction pattern typically had a lactate-oxygen index (LOI = -AVDL/AVDO2) of 0.08 or greater and a variable AVDO2. The three nonischemic CBF patterns had an LOI of less than 0.08, and could be classified according to the AVDO2. Patients with a normal CBF (mean 0.42 +/- 0.12 ml/gm/min) had an AVDO2 between 1.3 and 3.0 mumol/ml. A CBF pattern of hyperemia (mean 0.53 +/- 0.18 ml/gm/min) was characterized by an AVDO2 of less than 1.3 mumol/ml. A compensated hypoperfusion CBF pattern (mean 0.23 +/- 0.07 ml/gm/min) was identified by an AVDO2 of more than 3.0 mumol/min. These studies suggest that reliable estimates of CBF may be made from AVDO2 and AVDL measurements, which can be easily obtained in the intensive care unit.\r"

  ".W": "A wavelength-shifted Nd:YAG laser, tuned to coincide with the infrared absorption peak of water at 1.44 microns, was used to make lesions in normal rabbit brain. A total of 48 lesions were made with power up to 20 W, with energy up to 40 joules, and with two different spot sizes. These lesions were compared to lesions made with 1.06 microns radiation from an Nd:YAG laser under identical operating conditions. Measurements of blood-brain barrier damage and width, depth, and volume of tissue affected were obtained 30 minutes after placement of the lesions. It was found that 1.44-microns lesions produced photoevaporative tissue loss at the highest intensities used. The layer of coagulated tissue remaining after photovaporization had a mean thickness of 0.6 mm irrespective of the volume of tissue removed. There was no photovaporization in the 1.06-microns lesions. In addition, the amount of peripheral edema per unit volume of tissue coagulated was approximately half at the 1.44-microns wavelength. These findings suggest that the 1.44-microns Nd:YAG laser may be a useful surgical instrument since it combines the photoevaporative effect of the CO2 laser while maintaining the advantages of the conventional Nd:YAG laser (quartz fiber delivery and effective hemostasis).\r"

  ".W": "Single neuronal units with physiological characteristics of superficial dorsal-horn neurons were recorded extracellularly in laminae 1, 2, and 3 of cat spinal cord. When focal electrical stimulation was applied to the ipsilateral dorsal column, most of the units were excited transsynaptically at various latencies consistent with an effect mediated by large myelinated axons. Units recorded in laminae 2 and 3 had earlier latencies of activation than units in lamina 1. Units with cutaneous receptive fields only for noxious stimuli were activated at significantly longer latencies than units responsive to innocuous stimuli. The time course of these effects was consistent with the concept that many cells in laminae 1 to 3 receive direct excitatory synaptic input from collaterals of dorsal-column fibers, and some lamina 1 cells receive excitatory synaptic input from lamina 2 neurons. Previous reports have emphasized the inhibitory action of dorsal-column stimulation on nociceptive responses of cells in laminae 4 and 5 of the dorsal-horn, particularly those of the spinocervical tract in cats and the spinothalamic tract in primates. The present study suggests that some of this inhibition might be sustained by a network of interneurons in or near the substantia gelatinosa and marginal layer. The therapeutic efficiency of dorsal-column stimulation for pain relief in humans may depend in part on the activation of neurons in the superficial layers of the dorsal horn.\r"

Expressed as a percentage of that in soybean oil-fed rats, 22:6(n-3) in sunflower oil-fed rats was as follows: neurons, 49; astrocytes, 47; oligodendrocytes, 10; lung, 27; testes, 32; retina, 36; liver, 35 and kidneys, 45. Ten wk after the change in diet of 60-d-old rats from one containing sunflower oil to one containing soybean oil, the fatty acid composition of the brain cells had not reached control values, e.g., that obtained in animals continuously fed soybean oil; 22:6(n-3) was 77, 65 and 80% of control levels for astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and neurons, respectively. In contrast, the recovery measured by the decay of 22:5(n-6) was complete within 10 wk. For 22:6(n-3), it took approximately 2 wk for liver and kidney to recover to the control value, 3 wk for lung, 6 wk for retina and 10 wk for testes. The decrease of 22:5(n-6) was rapid: the control values were reached within 2 wk for kidney, liver and lung and within 6 wk for retina.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Fish fed a diet containing 2% 18:3(n-3) grew at the same rate as fish fed a diet containing 2.5% cod liver oil plus 2.5% corn oil. The best growth rate was observed in fish fed diets containing either 5% cod liver oil or 5% linseed oil. Growth rate was depressed by supplementation with 4% 18:3(n-3) or 1.25% n-3 HUFA mix.

The ratio of 20:3(n-9) to 22:6(n-3) of the fish showing good growth was less than 0.4.

Urea nitrogen (UN) was lower and amino nitrogen (AN) was higher in plasma of deficient animals than in pair-fed controls. No significant alteration in the nitrogen retention or in the general pattern of other nitrogen metabolites in plasma and urine was observed in vitamin A--deficient rats as compared to controls. However, there was a significant increase in the excretion of urinary ammonium nitrogen (Am-N) in relation to creatinine (CR). Activities of hepatic carbamoylphosphate synthase-I (CPS-I) and ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTC) were significantly lower in vitamin A--deficient animals than in control rats at the end of 13 wk of feeding. While the liver levels of ornithine and polyamines were significantly greater, that of glutamine was lower in vitamin A--deficient rats than in pair-fed controls. The results suggest that vitamin A deficiency leads to a reduced efficiency of urea synthesis pathway, thus accounting for the increased Am-N excretion seen in vitamin A deficiency.\r"

Milk was collected from the dam, and the stomach contents and liver were collected from the suckling pups 24 and 48 h after administration. Analysis of the isotopic ratio (3H/14C) in the milk and stomach contents indicated that the secretion of 3H in the milk was 20-25% as great as the secretion of 14C. The only labeled form of 3H and 14C in the stomach contents was pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), indicating that PN-glucoside was hydrolyzed to PN and subsequently metabolized prior to secretion by the mammary gland. The isotopic ratio in the livers of the pups was similar to that of the stomach contents. Furthermore, the relative distribution of the two isotopes among the hepatic metabolites of the pups was similar. The results of this study indicate that intact PN-glucoside is not secreted in milk, although vitamin B-6 derived from the limited hydrolysis and metabolism of PN-glucoside is delivered to the mammary gland for secretion.\r"

Two experiments were conducted with a purified diet which had a basal biotin level of 0.01-0.02 mg/kg. A third study was done with a nonpurified diet with or without a supplement of 1.0 mg biotin/kg. Each study was initiated with fry weighing less than 2 g/fish, and was continued for 16-20 wk at 15 degrees C. The first experiment, a cross-over design with pair-feeding, showed that the unsupplemented purified diet produced a biotin-specific deficiency condition in the trout. Dietary requirements could therefore be estimated (expt 2): maximal weight gain and maximal liver biotin concentration, 0.08 mg/kg; maximal activity of hepatic pyruvate carboxylase and acetyl CoA carboxylase, 0.05 mg/kg; and maximal white muscle pyruvate carboxylase activity, 0.14 mg/kg. No differences were found between fish fed the supplemented nonpurified diet and fish fed its unsupplemented counterpart (expt 3). The biotin requirement of the trout for growth does not exceed that of other vertebrates. These results also raise a question as to the level of supplementation which may be necessary for trout diets under field conditions.\r"

  ".W": "Histidine (His) is elevated in plasma and brain during protein deficiency as well as in several pathological conditions, leading to the possibility of a direct effect on central nervous system (CNS) function. In this study, groups of weanling rats were fed diets containing graded levels of casein or a single indispensable amino acid (IAA: Leu, Val, Ile, Phe, Trp, Thr, Met or Lys) in order to produce nutritionally-deficient states. Body weight gains and food intakes were recorded daily for 2 wk. Whole brain and serum samples were obtained and analyzed for amino acid (AA) content. All weight gain and food intake responses could be predicted by the Saturation Kinetics Model. The only consistent pattern observed in AA profiles which could be correlated with food intake was an increase in brain His concentrations. Limiting dietary casein or IAA elevated brain His above controls 2.5- and 1.5-fold, respectively. Food intake was generally depressed by 50% at brain His concentrations above 105 nmol/g. Since His is the precursor of the depressant neurotransmitter histamine (HA), systemic increases may be significant in that HA could be a possible cause of the anorexia observed in protein and IAA deficiency.\r"

Amino acid concentrations in plasma were determined before and 30, 60 and 180 min after the consumption of aspartame. Under these conditions, which mimic realistic aspartame consumption, aspartame had no significant effect on plasma concentration of any amino acid. In addition, the effect of aspartame alone or with carbohydrates on plasma and brain amino acid levels was studied in rats after acute or subacute (14 d) oral treatment. In subacute dosing experiments aspartame was included in the diet. Brain monoamine concentrations were also measured in the same animals. Plasma concentrations of large neutral amino acids were modified under acute conditions. In contrast, after subacute treatment no significant differences in plasma or brain amino acid concentrations or in brain monoamine concentrations were observed.\r"

Diets 1 and 2 provided 18 and 25% kcal, respectively, as protein with 36% of total calories as ethanol, while in diet 3 alcohol provided 28% and protein 25% of total calories. Three series of isoenergetically pair-fed rats, as well as an ad libitum group fed a solid diet, were studied. A primary maternal malnutrition was evident in rats fed diet 1. With respect to diet 2, the 96% postnatal mortality which occurred may have been due to an inhibition of milk production mediated by exaggerated blood alcohol concentrations present in the lactating dams. Diet 3 seemed to be nutritionally adequate for the extra requirements for lactation and a direct effect of ethanol was observed in the sucklings. High blood alcohol levels (25-50 mmol/1) were obtained in dams fed ethanol diets 1 and 3; however only 1% of maternal blood alcohol appeared in the blood of sucklings, demonstrating a low transfer of ethanol from mother to offspring through the milk. Finally the model for postnatal exposure to alcohol via mother's milk is discussed in terms of other indirect alcohol-related factors which make it difficult to evaluate the direct impact of ethanol per se in the normal development of the suckling pups.\r"

  ".U": "89110483\r", 
  ".W": "The fermentation of pectin by colonic bacteria produces short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) which are then absorbed by the host. The purpose of this study was to determine whether pectin, added to a chemically defined diet, would increase hepatic lipogenesis and whether this effect is mediated by intestinal bacteria. Eighteen Sprague-Dawley rats underwent placement of a feeding gastrostomy and a swivel apparatus. Postoperatively, rats were randomly assigned to one of three groups: 1) No Pectin received a fat-free chemically defined diet, 2) Pectin received the same diet with the addition of 1% (w/v) pectin, and 3) Neomycin received the same diet with 1% w/v pectin and neomycin (80 mg/kg of body weight daily). On the 5th postoperative d, all diets included 12.5% (v/v) deuterium as D2O. After the infusion of the labeled diets for 24 hr, the content and deuterium enrichment of liver palmitate, stearate and oleate were measured and the production rates calculated. The liver content and production rates of these fatty acids were higher in Pectin animals than in either the No Pectin or Neomycin animals. Since the effect of pectin on hepatic lipogenesis was reduced by the concomitant administration of the intestinal antibiotic neomycin, it appears that this effect depends on the bacterial fermentation of pectin. It is postulated that the SCFA produced during pectin fermentation promote lipogenesis via a direct stimulatory effect, in addition to being carbon donors.\r"

Apart from vitamin A formation, carotenoids show unique physicochemical properties and interesting biological effects. The inverse association between the ingestion of carotenoid-containing fruits and vegetables and the risk of certain forms of cancer has attracted significant attention. In considering the effects of carotenoids in mammals, a distinction should clearly be made among functions, actions and associations. Furthermore, carotenoids might well be classified in relation to defined biological actions, and not just in relation to nutritional activity.\r"

Postoperative changes (T2 to T3) were generally less than 1.0 mm for linear measurements and less than 2.0 degrees for angular measurements. The removal of maxillomandibular fixation (MMF) splints accounted for 85% to 95% of the counterclockwise rotation in the proximal and distal mandibular segments from T2 to T3. Maxillary inferior repositioning and large mandibular advancements exhibited the greatest tendency for relapse; however, the changes were less than with comparable procedures using nonrigid methods for stabilization. Except for large mandibular advancements, relapse was essentially unrelated to the magnitude of the surgical repositioning. Although the use of skeletal, maxillomandibular, and transosseous wire fixation have traditionally provided satisfactory clinical results, the use of rigid internal fixation in combined osteotomy procedures provides better stabilization of dentosseous segments when compared with these nonrigid methods, and may be particularly indicated in complex surgical procedures.\r"

Autogenous tissue is presently the material of choice, but requires a second surgical site. In addition, it is a free graft, and thus its fate is unknown. A technique has been developed that uses a pedicled autogenous flap composed of a portion of the temporalis muscle and pericranium to act as an interpositional material in temporomandibular joint surgery. The flap, based on the deep temporal arteries, and pedicled off of the coronoid process, is rotated anterior to the articular eminence and then posteriorly into the temporomandibular joint where it is sutured to the retrodiscal tissue. This procedure allows maintenance of tissue viability and functional movement of the flap during mandibular excursions. The technique offers numerous advantages over the existing autogenous, allogeneic, and alloplastic materials presently used in temporomandibular joint surgery.\r"

No histologic evidence of granular cells was noted in the recurrent lesion. The recurrent ameloblastoma was treated by marginal resection of the body of the mandible and immediate reconstruction with an iliac bone graft. The anatomic restoration was excellent, and there is no recurrence 5 years postoperatively. This case supports the view that the granular cell odontogenic cyst is a unicystic (monocystic) granular cell ameloblastoma, and that the presence of granular cells in ameloblastoma is not a permanent feature and may be of little value as a prognostic indicator of aggressiveness.\r"

  ".W": "The recovery of rat muscarinic receptor number from the effects of a specific alkylating ligand, N-[4-(2-chloroethylmethylamino)-2-butynyl]-2-pyrrolidone (BM 123), in three tissues is presented as an exponential function of time. No significant difference was found in the recovery rate constants derived from analysis of recovery time courses in corpus striatum, cerebral cortex and ileal longitudinal muscle. The single rate constant (0.021/hr) was also independent of amount and duration of BM 123 dose. Additional analysis of agonist-defined high and low affinity subsites in cortex revealed that recovery of these populations also followed similar time courses although the alkylation proceeds more slowly for the high affinity sites. The rate constant for recovery of both subsites was 0.029/hr. Recovery from BM 123 alkylation occurred in NG108-15 neuroblastoma X glioma cells. The presence of cycloheximide in the recovery medium did not significantly inhibit this recovery process in the clonal cell line, suggesting that de novo receptor synthesis is unnecessary for regeneration of unalkylated receptors.\r"

Unalkylated receptor number increased in alkylated preparations whether viewed as femtomoles per milligram of protein or as a percentage of the atropine-protected control. The rate of recovery was independent of pH over the range 6 to 9 and it was slowed but not eliminated by incubation at 4 degrees C. Muscarinic receptor recovery from BM 123 was linearly dependent on the concentration of alkylated receptors, indicating first-order kinetics and yielding a rate constant 0.026/hr. Of the other chloroethylamines examined for evidence of in vitro muscarinic receptor recovery from alkylation, only one, phenoxybenzamine, exhibited irreversible receptor blockade under these conditions. Each of the others showed different rates for regeneration of free receptors.\r"

  ".W": "Intrarenal administration of cholinergic agents produces diuresis. However, neither cholinergic innervation or specific cholinergic receptors have been shown to be present in the kidney. Recently, we have demonstrated that carbachol, a cholinergic agent, stimulates phosphoinositide hydrolysis in the inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) cells. The effect was blocked by atropine (a cholinergic antagonist), suggesting that phosphoinositide hydrolysis occurs through the interaction of carbachol with specific cholinergic receptors in these cells. Therefore, we examined the cholinergic receptors in IMCD cells by measurement of radioligand binding of a cholinergic receptor antagonist, I-quinuclidinyl (phenyl-4-3H)benzilate([3H]QNB). The IMCD cells were prepared from rabbit kidneys by incubating the inner medullary slices with collagenase and treating the isolated cells with hypotonic solution to lyse cells other than IMCD cells. Binding of [3H]QNB to IMCD cells was measured at 37 degrees C for 60 min in the absence (total binding) and the presence (nonspecific binding) of 100 microM atropine (a muscarinic receptor antagonist). The specific binding (the difference between total and nonspecific binding) of [3H]QNB to IMCD cells was saturable with a Bmax (maximum binding sites) of 27.5 fmol/mg of protein and Kd (dissociation constant) of 0.27 nM. Atropine, but not hexamethonium (a nicotinic antagonist), was able to displace [3H]QNB from IMCD cells with a Ki of 0.1 microM. It is, therefore, concluded that specific high affinity muscarinic receptors are present in IMCD cells. These receptors may play a role in producing the pharmacologic actions of cholinergic agents on the kidney.\r"

  ".W": "Antagonist-precipitated withdrawal after acute opioid administration (acute physical dependence) is an interesting phenomenon in that the opioid abstinence syndrome is generally thought to develop only after prolonged exposure to opioid agonists. The purpose of this study was to examine further this phenomenon in humans by characterizing the antagonist dose-response function. The effects of i.m. naloxone (0, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10 and 30 mg/70 kg) were assessed 6 hr after single i.m. injections of morphine (18 or 30 mg/70 kg) in six subjects with a history of chronic opiate use. Naloxone reversed residual morphine effects, including miosis and respiratory depression. The degree of reversal was dose-related to 10 mg/70 kg of naloxone with no further increases at the highest naloxone dose. Simultaneously, observer ratings of withdrawal signs and subjective reports of withdrawal symptoms were increased in an orderly dose-related manner to 30 mg/70 kg of naloxone. Reversal of residual morphine effects and onset of precipitated withdrawal were evident by 5-min postnaloxone; peak effects occurred within 15 min. This study confirmed the occurrence of antagonist-precipitated withdrawal after brief opioid exposure in humans, demonstrated the rapid onset of withdrawal effects and characterized the naloxone dose-response function.\r"

Slices or membranes prepared from various brain regions were equilibrated with 1.25% halothane at 37 degrees C, resulting in tissue concentrations greater than those found in brains of completely anesthetized animals (greater than 40 nmol/mg of lipid). Under these conditions, no effects of halothane were observed on agonist or antagonist binding to alpha-1 adrenergic, beta adrenergic, alpha-2 adrenergic or muscarinic cholinergic receptors, or on the ability of 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate to reduce agonist binding affinity. This concentration of halothane also had no effect on norepinephrine-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation, or inositol phosphate accumulation in response to norepinephrine, carbachol, histamine or 5-hydroxytryptamine. Halothane did reduce potassium-evoked release of [3H]norepinephrine from slices of rat cerebral cortex although it did not affect potassium-evoked release of [3H]acetylcholine. These results suggest that halothane may be relatively specific in its synaptic actions and may affect depolarization-evoked release of norepinephrine at concentrations achieved clinically.\r"

  ".W": "Our objective was to determine if the intracellular cysteine precursor, L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate (OTZ), would protect rats against the hepatotoxicity of 1,1-dichloroethylene (DCE) by altering the toxin's biologic fate. Fasted male rats were pretreated with 10 mmol of OTZ per kg s.c. in saline or with saline only 1 hr before administration of 14C-labeled DCE (50 mg/kg) p.o. in mineral oil. Serial blood samples were taken from permanent jugular cannulas between 1 and 24 hr to monitor the time course of injury and circulating levels of 14C-derived label. DCE caused less liver injury in the OTZ-pretreated group. This protection was associated with about 50% less total, acid soluble and acid precipitable 14C-label in serum; 30% less label in urine; and at 24 hr, 30 to 68% less covalently bound label in liver, kidney and lung. Extent of peak liver injury in individual animals correlated well with the amount of 14C-label in serum at early times and with the amount covalently bound to liver at 24 hr, but correlated poorly with label excreted into urine. An explanation for the apparent decrease in DCE metabolism by OTZ-pretreated animals was investigated by examining effects of OTZ on liver constituents known to have a role in DCE metabolism. Fasted rats given 10 mmol of OTZ per kg showed a persistent loss of hepatic cytochrome P-450 at 3 and 6 hr whereas their hepatic and renal reduced glutathione contents were transiently diminished at 3 hr.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A recent report shows that gentamicin nephrotoxicity in critically ill patients is more frequent and more severe than usual in individuals who are substantially overweight. The present study utilizes an overfed rat model to examine the influence of obesity on the nephrotoxic potential of gentamicin. After 52 weeks on an energy-dense diet, obese animals outweighed pellet controls by more than 80% (913 +/- 86 vs. 507 +/- 52 g; X +/- S.D., n = 7). When animals were treated twice daily for 6 days with 30 mg/kg of gentamicin i.p. based on total body mass, obese rats sustained more cortical necrosis than control (median score 3+ vs. 0), higher serum creatinine (4.36 +/- 2.72 vs. 0.71 +/- 0.17) and greater creatinine adjusted N-acetyl hexosaminidase excretion. The impact of obesity on intrinsic susceptibility to gentamicin nephrotoxicity was assessed by dosing animals for 5 days to ideal body mass plus 40% of excess body mass, the current clinical practice for achieving normal gentamicin concentrations in obese patients. Obese rats again sustained more frequent and severe cortical necrosis (2+ vs. 0) and excreted more N-acetyl hexosaminidase than control animals. Urine pH averaged 1.7 U below normal in obese animals, but restoration to normal values by 2 weeks on the pellet diet did not diminish the toxicity increase. Results from the overfed rat closely resemble the recent clinical observation that obese patients sustain more frequent and severe kidney damage from aminoglycoside antibiotics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The metabolic clearance of antipyrine was utilized as an in vivo measure of the activity of the hepatic microsomal oxidative enzyme system. Subchronic (7 days) p.o. treatment of rats with DEHP, mono-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate or 2-ethylhexanol produced a substantial increase in both wet liver weight and antipyrine clearance relative to corn oil-treated controls. In contrast, i.p. administration of DEHP resulted in a minor but statistically significant stimulation of liver growth and antipyrine metabolism. Whereas chronic administration of the plasticizer or its metabolites produced apparent induction of hepatic microsomal oxidative enzymes, administration of a single dose of each compound was associated with immediate inhibition of the metabolism of antipyrine. The present data suggest that the products of deesterification of DEHP are primarily responsible for the stimulation of hepatic metabolism observed after long-term exposure to the plasticizer, whereas the parent compound and both metabolites have the potential to produce acute inhibition of hepatic microsomal oxidation in vivo.\r"

An avidin biotin-amplified competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay has been developed which utilizes solid phase acetaminophen bound to metallothionein and antiserum obtained from rabbits that were immunized with 3-(N-acetyl-L-cystein-S-yl)acetaminophen covalently bound to keyhole-limpet hemocyanin. Over 25 synthetic analogs of acetaminophen conjugates and structurally similar compounds have been ranked relative to their ability to compete in the avidin biotin-amplified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The most effective inhibitor was 3-(N-acetyl-L-cystein-S-yl)acetaminophen, which had an observed 50% inhibitory concentration of 120 fmol/well. Approximately 6200-fold higher concentrations of unbound acetaminophen and 5.2 x 10(6)-fold higher concentrations of N-acetyl-L-cysteine were required for comparable inhibition. It was demonstrated with acetaminophen analogs that the hydroxyl group and the N-acetyl moiety of acetaminophen were important in epitope recognition. A 5000-fold decrease in detection was observed when the analog did not contain the hydroxyl group or when the N-acetyl moiety was replaced with a hydroxyl substituent. Recognition by antibody was also dependent upon the stereochemistry of the analogs. The 50% inhibitory concentration for 3-(L-cystein-S-yl)acetaminophen was 2300 fmol/well, whereas a 25-fold higher concentration of 3-(D-cystein-S-yl)acetaminophen was required for 50% inhibition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Administration of acetaminophen at doses of 50, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 mg/kg to mice resulted in evidence of hepatotoxicity (increase in serum levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase) at 4 hr in the 300, 400 and 500 mg/kg treatment groups only. The formation of 3-(cystein-S-yl)acetaminophen adducts in liver protein was not observed in the groups receiving 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg doses, but was observed in the groups receiving doses above 300 mg/kg of acetaminophen. Greater levels of adduct formation were observed at the higher doses. 3-(Cystein-S-yl)acetaminophen protein adducts were also observed in serum of mice receiving hepatotoxic doses of acetaminophen. After a 400 mg/kg dose of acetaminophen, 3-(cystein-S-yl)acetaminophen adducts in the liver protein reached peak levels 2 hr after dosing. By 12 hr the levels decreased to approximately 10% of the peak level. In contrast, 3-(cystein-S-yl)acetaminophen adducts in serum protein were delayed, reaching a sustained peak 6 to 12 hr after dosing. The dose-response correlation between the appearance of serum aminotransferases and 3-(cystein-S-yl)acetaminophen adducts in serum protein and the temporal correlation between the decrease in 3-(cystein-S-yl)acetaminophen adducts in liver protein and the appearance of adducts in serum protein are consistent with a hepatic origin of the adducts detected in serum protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Zacopride and ICS 205-930 showed similar affinity (-log kB approximately 8.0), whereas GR38032F showed lower affinity (-log ka approximately 7.0) at 5-HT3 receptors in the guinea pig ileum. After i.v. administration to anesthetized rats, zacopride was approximately 10-fold more potent than either ICS 205-930 or GR38032F, which were equipotent as inhibitors of serotonin-induced bradycardia (5-HT3-mediated activation of the von Bezold Jarisch reflex). After oral administration to anesthetized rats, zacopride remained approximately 10-fold more potent than ICS 205-903, which was approximately 2-fold more potent than GR38032F as an inhibitor of serotonin-induced bradycardia. Furthermore, the inhibitory effectiveness of GR38032F persisted for less than 3 hr after oral administration and for less than 15 min after intravenous administration. ICS 205-930 produced maximal inhibition of serotonin-induced bradycardia for over 3 hr with heart rate returning to control values 6 hr after oral administration. Zacopride possessed the longest duration of inhibitory effectiveness in urethane-anesthetized rats with maximal inhibition still apparent 6 hr after oral administration. All three agents inhibited cisplatin-induced emesis after i.v. administration in dogs with zacopride being 10-fold more potent than ICS 205-930 or GR38032F, which were equipotent. These comparative data with three 5-HT3 receptor antagonists indicate that in animals, zacopride was more potent and longer acting than either ICS 205-930 or GR38032F. Furthermore, after oral administration to rats, GR38032F was slightly less potent than ICS 205-930 and possessed the shortest duration of action.\r"

Recently it has been reported that the circular layer of the antrum is not homogenous in its electrical activity. Therefore, circular muscles from the regions adjacent to the myenteric and submucosal borders of the circular layer were studied separately to compare the actions of ethyl alcohol through the thickness of the circular layer. In the first series of experiments concentration-response data were collected to describe the effects of ethyl alcohol on the contractile activities of myenteric and submucosal muscles. The data show that ethyl alcohol is more effective as an inhibitor of myenteric contractions than submucosal contractions. Next, experiments were performed to determine the electrical mechanism responsible for the contractile effects. Circular cells of submucosal and myenteric regions were impaled, and the muscles were exposed to several concentrations of ethyl alcohol ranging from 0.1 to 1.5%. Slow wave activity was reduced in frequency and amplitude in both regions. The inhibitory effect of ethyl alcohol on electrical activity was greater in submucosal muscles, but mechanical activity was less affected in these muscles because excitation-contraction coupling occurs at more polarized levels in the submucosal portion of the circular layer.\r"

The IC50 value for CGS-9343B inhibition of histamine plus 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine-induced [14C]aminopyrine accumulation was 306 nM. The drug was more potent than the H2-histamine receptor antagonist, cimetidine (1128 nM), less potent than the nonspecific calmodulin antagonists, trifluoperazine and fenoctimine (IC50 = 40 and 224 nM, respectively), and equipotent with the H+, K+-adenosine triphosphatase inhibitor, omeprazole (365 nM). CGS-9343B showed an IC50 of 369 nM for carbachol-induced [14C]aminopyrine accumulation in dispersed mucosal cells. CGS-9343B must be added to cells before or simultaneously with acid secretagogues in order to be effective. The drug did not reverse previously stimulated secretion. Unlike trifluoperazine and fenoctimine, CGS-9343B had anticamodulin activity for inhibition of calmodulin-activated (Type I) phosphodiesterase in the same range of potency as observed for the inhibition of aminopyrine accumulation. In anesthetized rats and dogs the i.v. infusion of CGS-9343B did not block histamine plus pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion. However, i.a. administration of CGS-9343B to anesthetized rats produced a significant inhibition of acid secretion. In vivo the order of potency was omeprazole greater than cimetidine much greater than CGS-9343B. These data provide evidence for involvement of calmodulin in the acid secretory process and suggest that the pursuit of selective calmodulin antagonists such as CGS-9343B may prove useful for understanding the regulation of the hydrogen ion secretory process.\r"

In animals subjected to constant flow LCX perfusion, after beta adrenoceptor blockade with nadolol (4 mg/kg), alpha-1 adrenoceptor blockade with prazosin (0.5 mg/kg) and alpha-2 adrenoceptor blockade with idazoxan (1.0 mg/kg), intracoronary (c) injection of dopamine (0.01-10 micrograms/kg) produced a dose-dependent decrease in LCX perfusion pressure which was unaltered by administration of the dopamine-2 receptor antagonist domperidone (10 micrograms/kg) but which was blocked completely by the dopamine-1 receptor antagonist SK&F R-83566 (5 micrograms/kg). Similarly, under conditions of constant pressure LCX perfusion and after combined beta, alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptor blockade, i.c. administration of dopamine produced a dose-related increase in LCX coronary blood flow which was inhibited by SK&F R-83566 but not by domperidone. Direct i.c. administration of the selective dopamine-1 receptor agonist, fenoldopam (1 microgram/kg), resulted in an increase in LCX coronary blood flow which was eliminated completely after administration of SK&F R-83566. Doses of the selective dopamine-2 receptor agonist, dipropyldopamine (0.1-30 micrograms/kg), effective in producing blood flow increases in the femoral vascular bed and which could be antagonized by domperidone, produced only minimal and inconsistent changes in LCX coronary blood flow. Our data demonstrate that direct, dopamine-mediated coronary vasodilation in vivo occurs via stimulation of a vascular receptor of the dopamine-1 subtype.\r"

  ".W": "The present study describes the high degree of sensitivity of the mitochondrial fraction of the striatum to Mn++-mediated perturbations in mixed-function oxidase activity. This study also defines the brain mitochondrial cytochrome P-450 subject to increase by Mn++. In the striatum of Mn++-treated animals (7 days) hydroxylation of benzo(a)pyrene and D-amphetamine was significantly increased in both the mitochondrial and the microsomal fractions. The effects were more pronounced in the mitochondrial fraction where hydroxylation activities were increased by 2- to 3-fold. SKF-525A (2-diethylaminoethyl-2,2-di-phenylvalerate hydrochloride) effectively inhibited NADH-dependent hydroxylation of both substrates by the mitochondrial fraction. In the Mn++-treated animals, significant increases in mitochondrial and microsomal cytochrome P-450 concentration were also noted. In the mitochondria, the hemoprotein concentration was increased by nearly 2.5-fold; in the microsomes the concentration of the cytochrome was increased by about 1.6-fold. Mn++ appeared to selectively increase cytochrome P-450 concentration since that of other cytochromes including the mitochondrial b, c1, c and a, and the microsomal cytochrome b5 was not increased. In addition, the activity of mitochondrial delta-aminolevulinate synthetase was not increased and that of the microsomal heme oxygenase was inhibited by Mn++ treatment. It is suggested that increases in the microsomal and the mitochondrial cytochrome P-450 may reflect intrinsic properties of cytochrome P-450 isozymes in these organelles, including their turnover rate, preferential utilization of heme and/or susceptibility to degradation. The possible relevance of the findings to Mn++ neurotoxicity of dopamine pathways is discussed.\r"

Norepinephrine elicited concentration-dependent contractile responses which were antagonized in a competitive manner by the selective alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist, rauwolscine, with a dissociation constant of 15.7 nM, whereas the selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin, produced nonparallel rightward shifts in the norepinephrine concentration-response curve with a marked depression in the maximal response, indicating noncompetitive antagonism. B-HT 933, a selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist, also produced a concentration-dependent contraction in canine pulmonary vein, with the maximal contraction elicited by B-HT 933 being approximately 45% of that produced by norepinephrine. The response mediated by B-HT 933 was antagonized in a competitive manner by rauwolscine with a dissociation constant of 4.4 nM, whereas prazosin again behaved in a noncompetitive manner producing nonparallel rightward shifts in the B-HT 933 concentration-response curve with a marked depression in the maximal response. However, another alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist, corynanthine, weakly blocked the response produced by B-HT 933 with a dissociation constant of 1400 nM, and this low affinity for corynanthine is consistent with interaction at alpha-2 adrenoceptors. Cirazoline, a selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonist, also produced a concentration-dependent vasoconstrictor response in canine pulmonary veins which was antagonized competitively by both alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonists, corynanthine and prazosin, with dissociation constants of 180 and 1.4 nM, respectively, indicative of an interaction with alpha-1 adrenoceptors. Rauwolscine (10 nM) did not significantly affect the response produced by cirazoline.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "ICI 147,798 has been shown to exhibit both diuretic and beta-antagonist properties in vivo. The present study investigated the nature and selectivity of the beta-antagonism in a variety of isolated tissues. ICI 147,798 produced a concentration-dependent suppression of the maximum chronotropic response of norepinephrine in guinea pig right atria (beta-1 adrenoceptor). ICI 147,798 caused a concentration-dependent shift to the right of the salbutamol concentration-response curve in the guinea pig trachea (beta-2 adrenoceptor), and Schild analysis suggested competitive inhibition. Propranolol produced parallel shifts to the right of the norepinephrine concentration-response curve in guinea pig right atria, except at relatively high concentrations. The inhibitory effects of propranolol in guinea pig right atria were reversed by greater than 95%, whereas the effects of ICI 147,798 were only slightly reversed after a 6-hr washout period. Preincubation of propranolol with ICI 147,798 in guinea pig right atria prevented completely the suppression of the norepinephrine maximum chronotropic response. Postincubation of propranolol with ICI 147,798 partially reversed the suppression of the maximum chronotropic response. ICI 147,798 had no effect on the maximum chronotropic responses of either histamine (H2-receptor) or forskolin (adenylate cyclase activation) in guinea pig right atria and had no effect on agonist responses in a variety of other receptor systems. The insurmountable beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonism was evaluated based on the assumptions of irreversible competitive antagonism, mixed competitive and noncompetitive antagonism and slowly dissociating competitive antagonism (\"hemi-equilibrium\" conditions). Concentration-dependent changes in norepinephrine KA values suggested the first three possibilities were unlikely.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In conscious rabbits, i.v. injections of 0.31, 1.0 and 3.1 mg/kg of ICI 147,798 and 1.0 mg/kg of propranolol caused significant bradycardia. ICI 147,798 produced a dose-dependent shift to the right of the dose-response (chronotropic) curve of isoproterenol with suppression of the maximal tachycardia, an effect characteristic of insurmountable beta receptor blockade. Propranolol also produced a shift to the right of the dose-response curve of isoproterenol without affecting the maximal tachycardia. ICI 147,798-induced antagonism was specific for beta adrenoceptors as it failed to modify the effects of acetylcholine, angiotensin II, phenylephrine, adenosine, histamine and prostaglandin E2 on mean arterial pressure and heart rate. In rabbits with prior autonomic blockade, ICI 147,798, like propranolol, failed to inhibit the positive chronotropic effects of theophylline which are mediated by postreceptor mechanisms. In reserpinized rabbits, ICI 147,798 was found to have no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Unlike the effects of propranolol, which were attenuated by first-pass through the hepatic vascular bed, the effects of ICI 147,798 were unaffected suggesting an absence of first-pass metabolism. The effects of propranolol (1.0 mg/kg i.v.) were not detectable at 24 hr after injection, whereas significant beta receptor blocking activity was still present at 24 hr after ICI 147,798 (1.0 mg/kg i.v.). The results suggest that ICI 147,798 is a specific, long-acting, insurmountable beta-1 receptor blocking agent without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Intracerebroventricular zolantidine dimaleate produced an inhibition of the response that was both time- and dose-dependent, with no effect on base-line responses. A dose of 20 micrograms produced maximal (93%) inhibition of FSIA when given 10 min before footshock, with a calculated ID50 of 7.18 nmol. Eight additional H2-antagonists with varying structures and brain-penetrating qualities also exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of the response with no effect on base-line nociception. The potencies of these compounds for inhibition of naloxone-resistant FSIA correlated significantly (r = 0.966, P less than .001; rho = 0.980, P less than .002) with their affinities at the H2-receptor, providing strong support for the hypothesis that brain histamine and H2-receptors are important components of naloxone-resistant FSIA.\r"

The mucosal effect is dose-dependent, reproducible and sustained. Responses to bradykinin were unaffected by amiloride (1 mM) or piretanide (1 mM) but were attenuated by acetazolamide (1 mM), indicating the charge-carrying ion species to be bicarbonate. This was confirmed by abolishing the short circuit current response to bradykinin with bicarbonate-free solutions. Tetrodotoxin (1 microM) did not alter the response, indicating that neurons are not involved. This effect of bradykinin on gallbladder bicarbonate transport appears to be dependent upon arachidonate metabolism because the cyclooxygenase inhibitor piroxicam reversibly abolished the effect. In addition, prostaglandin E2 was more effective (EC50 = 0.01 microM) than bradykinin in stimulating short circuit current. This newly appreciated ion transporting effect of bradykinin occurs in a tissue where kinin effects upon afferent nerve endings and smooth muscle are also evident and raise several questions about kinin involvement in stone formation or local inflammatory events.\r"

Administration of isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX, 1.25-5.00 mg/kg) to rats which were performing a fixed-ratio 30 operant for food reinforcement caused a dose-dependent suppression of responding and a decrease in colonic temperature. Administration of behaviorally inactive doses of the opiate antagonist naloxone (1.25-5.00 mg/kg) 10 min after the beginning of the fixed-ratio 30 session significantly increased the behavioral effects of IBMX (1.25-5.00 mg/kg) injected 30 min before the session, with no consistent effect upon IBMX-induced hypothermia. The coadministration of behaviorally inactive doses of morphine (0.05-1.50 mg/kg) with IBMX (5.00 mg/kg) 30 min before the fixed-ratio 30 session antagonized the operant behavioral effects of IBMX. These results suggest that the operant behavioral effects of IBMX provide a model with which to examine the expression of opiate withdrawal without the confounding changes associated with the acute pharmacological actions of opiates.\r"

On the other hand, \"chronic\" imipramine administration (15 mg/kg i.p./day for 5 consecutive days) increased selectively the threshold of the supraspinal micturition reflex. Intravenous administration of cumulative doses of imipramine (up to 14 mg/kg) exerted a progressive inhibitory effect on the supraspinal reflex and voiding efficiency, possibly related to direct inhibition of muscular contractility at the bladder level. However, with the dose regimen used to compare the action of imipramine on spinal and supraspinal reflexes (15 mg/kg i.p., 60 min before), imipramine did not affect the volume-pressure curve or myogenic activity in decentralized bladders (bilateral removal of pelvic ganglia). The effect of acute imipramine on threshold of the spinal vesico-vesical reflex was absent in rats receiving oral p-chlorophenylalanine to deplete 5-hydroxytryptamine stores in the central nervous system. On the other hand, p-chlorophenylalanine pretreatment did not prevent the action of chronic imipramine administration on the supraspinal reflex. Acute administration of desipramine, the major metabolite of imipramine, increased threshold of the spinal but not supraspinal micturition reflex. These findings indicate that the ability of imipramine to modulate vesico-urethral motility at the central nervous system level may involve different mechanisms. Inhibition of 5-hydroxytryptamine reuptake in nerve terminals may be important for the acute modulatory effect of imipramine on the spinal reflex.\r"

In the present study, the effects of indomethacin and ketoprofen on the intrapleural leukocyte accumulation induced by carrageenan or zymosan-activated serum (ZAS) were investigated. Rats were given indomethacin or ketoprofen p.o. (1, 3 or 9 mg/kg) 1 hr before intrapleural injection of carrageenan (1 mg) or ZAS (0.5 ml). Pleural exudates were harvested 4 hr later. In each model of pleurisies, ketoprofen and indomethacin reduced the volume of exudate and leukocyte count in a dose-dependent manner but ketoprofen was more active than indomethacin. Ketoprofen and indomethacin had no effect on the protein concentration and the total complement activity of the exudates induced by carrageenan or ZAS. The spontaneous and directed migrations of leukocytes elicited by ZAS were unaffected by indomethacin and ketoprofen, whereas those of leukocytes elicited by carrageenan were more inhibited by ketoprofen than by indomethacin. These data demonstrate that ketoprofen is more active than indomethacin in reducing the in vivo leukocyte migration evoked by carrageenan or ZAS and suggest that the main effect of these two drugs is to reduce the increase in vascular permeability. Neutrophil chemotactic responsiveness and generation of chemotactic factors alone cannot explain the anti-inflammatory effect of ketoprofen and indomethacin.\r"

Rabbit hearts were perfused for 20 min under hypoxic conditions, followed by 45-min reoxygenation. Hypoxic insults induced cessation of cardiac contractile force, rise in resting tension, depletion of myocardial high-energy phosphates, accumulation of tissue calcium and release of creatine kinase and ATP metabolites such as adenosine, inosine and hypoxanthine. These alterations were not returned to the initial levels upon reoxygenation. Administration of either 69 microM lidocaine or 55 microM disopyramide after the onset of oxygen deficiency (between 8th and 20th min of the hypoxia) resulted in a significant suppression of hypoxia-induced rise in resting tension, tissue calcium accumulation and release of creatine kinase and ATP metabolites, whereas hypoxia-induced decline in cardiac contractile force and depletion of myocardial high-energy phosphates were not affected by the treatment. The latter two variables were improved markedly during 45-min reoxygenation when the heart had been treated with the agents. The improvement was accompanied by a suppression of the release of creatine kinase and ATP metabolites and the tissue calcium accumulation. The results suggest that lidocaine and disopyramide are beneficial for posthypoxic recovery of cardiac function and metabolism.\r"

Despite the continuous exposure of a large proportion of the population to PX, little is known about PX disposition in humans. The present study was performed to define the metabolic partial clearances of PX in humans and, by determining the effects of cimetidine and allopurinol pretreatments on PX disposition, assess the relative importance of cytochrome P-450 and xanthine oxidase in PX biotransformation. The combined formation of the 7-demethylated products 1-methylxanthine (1-MX), 1-methyluric acid (1-MU) and 5-acetyl-amino-6-formylamino-3-methyluracil (AFMU) accounted for 67% of PX clearance. Formation of 7-methylxanthine (7-MX) and 1,7-dimethyluric acid and renal excretion of unchanged PX comprised 6, 8 and 9% of PX clearance, respectively. Allopurinol pretreatment had no effect on PX plasma clearance but decreased 1-MU excretion and increased 1-MX excretion, with the combined excretion of these metabolites remaining constant. Cimetidine pretreatment decreased PX plasma clearance by 30%. Metabolic partial clearances to 1-MX + 1-MU and to AFMU were reduced to a similar extent (ca. 40%) in the cimetidine treatment phase, but other pathways were not significantly affected. These data are consistent with 1-MX and AFMU being derived from a common intermediate, the formation of which is mediated by cytochrome P-450. Xanthine oxidase catalyzes only the secondary conversion of 1-MX to 1-MU.\r"

After i.v. methadone administration (1 mg/kg b.wt.) plasma AVP levels rose significantly to a mean maximum value of 102.8 +/- 18.8 pg/ml at 15 min postinjection. Plasma sodium and plasma osmolality did not change significantly, whereas plasma potassium decreased significantly. Blood gas variables showed the development of a slight respiratory acidosis. Mean arterial blood pressure increased and heart rate decreased, both significantly, after methadone administration. Naloxone (0.1 mg/kg b.wt.) administered i.v., 15 min before methadone, prevented the changes in plasma AVP levels as well as other variables, with the exception of the heart rate. Naloxone administration itself did not induce changes in any variable recorded. The dose-response study showed increasing plasma AVP levels upon administration of increasing doses of methadone above the 0.5 mg/kg level. On account of the magnitude of response and the lack of changes in biochemical and hemodynamic variables sufficient to explain the documented AVP response, we conclude that methadone exerts a stimulatory influence on the systemic release of AVP. We consider the documented release of AVP to be a direct effect of the methadone administration, on account of the findings from the dose-response study and on account of the total blockade of the response after naloxone administration before methadone.\r"

  ".W": "The interaction of the prejunctional inhibitory action of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) on noradrenergic transmission with the neuronal amine uptake mechanism has been studied in rabbit isolated ear artery preparations. Release of norepinephrine in response to stimulation of periarterial sympathetic nerves (30 pulses, 1 Hz) was deduced from the efflux of radioactivity which had been incorporated into the noradrenergic transmitter pool as [3H]norepinephrine. 5-HT (100 nM), applied alone, had no effect on the stimulation-induced efflux of radioactivity. However, in the presence of cocaine (1 microM), 5-HT reduced stimulation-induced efflux. The inhibitory effect of 5-HT, in the presence of cocaine, on stimulation-induced efflux was abolished by the nonselective 5-HT1/5-HT2 receptor antagonist, methiothepin (30 nM), but not by the selective 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, ketanserin (6 nM), or by the alpha adrenoceptor antagonist, phentolamine (30 nM). These findings indicate that the uptake of 5-HT into periarterial sympathetic nerves may limit its prejunctional \"5-HT1-like\" receptor-mediated inhibitory effect on noradrenergic transmission. In arteries which were incubated with 5-HT (1 microM) and the monoamine oxidase inhibitor, pargyline (10 microM), before loading the transmitter stores with [3H]norepinephrine, methiothepin (30 nM) enhanced stimulation-induced efflux markedly. The enhancing effect of methiothepin was not observed in arteries which were preincubated with cocaine (10 microM) together with 5-HT and pargyline. It is suggested that, following its uptake into periarterial sympathetic nerves, 5-HT may be coreleased with norepinephrine to activate prejunctional 5-HT1-like receptors and thereby mediate an autoinhibitory effect on transmitter release.\r"

  ".W": "The administration of hydrocortisone (HC; 75 mg/kg i.v. daily for 10 days) to rabbits significantly increased the metabolic clearance (Clm) of sulfamethazine (SMZ) from 1.92 +/- 0.05 to 2.85 +/- 0.06 liters/hr/kg (P less than 0.01). However, p.o. availability of SMZ was similar before (0.42 +/- 0.06) and after (0.39 +/- 0.03) steroid treatment. Furthermore, total liver blood flow as measured by the radioactive microsphere technique was increased (P less than 0.01) from 3.64 +/- 0.15 to 5.12 +/- 0.54 liters/hr/kg by HC treatment. Estimates of presystemic intestinal extraction and hepatic extraction were derived. These data predicted that intestinal extraction ranged from 0.11 to 0.15 in untreated rabbits and from 0.11 to 0.16 in HC-treated rabbits. Moreover, intestinal clearance was shown to contribute less than 4% to Clm of SMZ on both study days. By comparison, estimates of hepatic extraction ranged from 0.51 to 0.53, and from 0.54 to 0.56 in untreated and HC-treated rabbits, respectively. Based on the concept of a well-stirred, perfusion-limited model of hepatic elimination, the HC-induced increases in hepatic enzyme activity and blood flow were shown to make comparable contributions to the increase in hepatic clearance. It is concluded that the liver is the major site of SMZ acetylation in untreated and HC-treated, rapid acetylator rabbits. Furthermore, the increase in Clm of SMZ observed in vivo after HC treatment is attributable primarily to increases in hepatic N-acetyltransferase activity and liver blood flow.\r"

  ".W": "To clarify the role of hypothyroidism in diabetes-induced sympathetic neuropathy, we examined the responsiveness to sympathetic nerve stimulation and to agonists of the left atria of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, and compared it with those in hypothyroid, thyroxine(T4)-treated diabetic or T4-treated hypothyroid rats. Positive inotropic response of isolated left atria to transmural nerve stimulation (TNS) was examined in the presence of atropine. In diabetic rats, plasma triiodothyronine and T4 levels decreased markedly. The responses to TNS and norepinephrine (NE) also decreased. The decrease was greater in response to TNS, which may be due to the reduction of presynaptic NE release. As to the postsynaptic response, the maximal response to NE decreased without any significant change in ED50 value, and a similar decrease in the maximal response to Ca++ was also observed in spite of a slight decrease in the beta receptor density. Therefore, in diabetic rats the decreased response to TNS may result mainly from a decreased NE release from nerve endings and a decreased contractility beyond the adrenoceptor level. In hypothyroid rats, the response to TNS and NE decreased, and the decrease was again greater in response to TNS. The decrease in the NE response was due to the increased ED50 value without any change in the maximal response. Similarly, the maximal response to Ca++ did not change. Thus in the hypothyroid rats, the decreased response to TNS probably results from a decreased NE release from nerve endings as well as a decreased sensitivity to NE.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The antiarrhythmic action of Ca++ antagonists may either be due to vasodilation and negative chronotropism or to trans-sarcolemmal Ca++ influx inhibition. In these studies we investigated the possible individual and additive effects of coronary flow, heart rate and Ca++ antagonism on ventricular arrythmia development in isolated, paced, globally underperfused guinea pig hearts. When the coronary flow during ischemia was raised from 5 to 7% of control and/or the stimulation frequency was decreased from 6 to 4 Hz, ATP and creatine phosphate levels were conserved and intraventricular conduction slowing leading to ventricular tachycardia (VT) was delayed. In contrast, when the coronary flow and pacing rates were fixed at 7% and 6 Hz and diltiazem (10(-6) M) was included in the perfusion medium, there was no effect on tissue high-energy phosphate depletion and development of VT. Even when the breakdown of ATP and the onset of VT were accelerated by isoprenaline (10(-6) M), diltiazem was not antiarrhythmic at this flow rate. Only when the coronary flow was reduced to 5% of control, in the absence and presence of isoprenaline, did diltiazem delay ventricular arrhythmias through a mechanism that was independent of changes in coronary flow and heart rate.\r"

CCK and gastrin induced the Ca++-dependent and tetrodotoxin-sensitive release of [3H]ACh from the LM-MP preparations preloaded with [3H]choline. Proglumide, but not scopolamine, hexamethonium and [D-Pro2,D-Trp7,9]substance P inhibited the release of [3H]ACh induced by CCK and gastrin. The desensitization to CCK and gastrin was observed with a 30-min exposure of the preparation to CCK and gastrin, respectively, and the cross-desensitization to peptides was not observed, thereby indicating that these peptides induce the release of ACh mainly via respective receptors. Bicuculline which inhibited completely the release of [3H]ACh induced by GABA inhibited the release of [3H]ACh induced by CCK but not by gastrin by 42.3 +/- 4.22%. CCK, but not gastrin, produced the Ca++-dependent and tetrodotoxin-sensitive release of endogenous GABA and [3H]GABA from LM-MP preparations preloaded with [3H]GABA. The release of [3H]GABA induced by CCK was antagonized by proglumide, but not by scopolamine, hexamethonium and [D-Pro2,D-Trp7,9]substance P. These results provide evidence that the GABAergic neuron is stimulated by CCK, but not by gastrin and stimulates the cholinergic neuron.\r"

Saline or KT-362 (300 micrograms/kg/min i.v.) were infused 15 min before and throughout occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. There were no significant differences between groups in ischemic bed size or collateral blood flow, however, during ischemia and after reperfusion, KT-362 produced a significant decrease in the heart rate-systolic pressure product, an index of myocardial oxygen demand. In addition, there was a significant decrease in the incidence of reperfusion-induced ventricular fibrillation in the drug-treated animals. KT-362-treated dogs showed a marked improvement in myocardial segment function of the ischemic-reperfused region at 1, 2, and 3 hr of reperfusion as compared to the saline-treated animals (3 hr percentage of segment shortening of pretreatment: saline group, 14 +/- 10; KT-362 group, 59 +/- 7). These results demonstrate that KT-362 has a favorable effect on the functional recovery of the ischemic-reperfused myocardium and incidence of ventricular fibrillation, and may be of potential benefit as a new therapeutic agent for the treatment of coronary heart disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The novel antidepressant moclobemide is a reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO), preferentially of type A. Moclomide was active in three animal models considered predictive for antidepressant activity: 1) it prevented dose-dependently akinesia and blepharospasm induced in mice and rats by Ro 4-1284, a short-acting amine releasing agent. Prevention of akinesia by moclobemide also depended upon the dose of Ro 4-1284. For comparison also, effects of cimoxatone, harmaline, tranylcypromine and clorgyline are presented: 2) in cats, it selectively and dose-dependently suppressed rapid eye movement sleep without disturbing the sleep-wakefulness cycle; and 3) in the behavioral despair test in mice, it decreased the immobility score to a similar degree as amitriptyline or imipramine. In addition, moclobemide potentiated 5-hydroxytryptophan-induced stereotypies in rats with a potency similar to cimoxatone and with a duration of action of less than 24 hr. Moclobemide had almost no effect on the spontaneous behavior in mice, rats, cats and monkeys. Only in higher doses, marginal sedation and slight impairment in motor performance were seen. Moclobemide did not prevent pilcarpine-induced salivation in mice, demonstrating the absence of anticholinergic activity. Blood pressure and heart rate of freely moving, spontaneously hypertensive rats were only slightly decreased for less than 3 hr. Moclobemide moderately potentiated the pressor effect of p.o. tyramine in rats. In conclusion, the reversible MAO inhibitor moclobemide is active in animal models sensitive to all major drugs used in the treatment of depression. In contrast to imipramine-like antidepressants, it lacks anticholinergic activity and it differs from classic MAO inhibitors by potentiating only weakly the pressor effect of p.o. tyramine.\r"

Ciprofloxacin and pefloxacin caused dose-dependent inhibition of colony formation both from normal bone marrow cells and from the leukemic line K-562 cells. This inhibition exerted by ciprofloxacin and pefloxacin was statistically significant at concentrations of 25 micrograms/ml and above. Ciprofloxacin appeared to be the most potent inhibitor of colony formation among the antimicrobial agents tested. Although the inhibitory effect of pefloxacin on normal hematopoietic stem cells was similar to that of cefazolin and chloramphenicol, the inhibitory effect of pefloxacin on leukemic cells was more prominent than that of cefazolin and chloramphenicol. In a proliferation assay in liquid culture of the cell line HL-60, ciprofloxacin and pefloxacin caused a dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation. Both drugs failed to induce cellular differentiation, as assessed by the nitrogen blue tetrazolium dye reduction assay. In therapeutic concentrations no cumulative toxic effect of the combination of ciprofloxacin with cytosine-arabinoside, vincristine, actinomycin D and doxorubicin on colony formation by HL-60 cells was observed. It is concluded that ciprofloxacin does not exert in vitro inhibitory effect on human leukemic cells when assayed at concentrations of less than or equal to 5 micrograms/ml. However, at concentrations of 25 and 50 micrograms/ml of ciprofloxacin alone and in combination with several antineoplastic agents exerts an inhibitory effect on colony formation.\r"

Benzoylglycine and the 3- and 4-methyl analogs showed nonlinear plasma protein binding varying between 20 and 80% over a concentration range of 5 to 450 micrograms/ml. For 2-methylbenzoylglycine an extremely high protein binding, practically approaching 100%, was observed at low plasma levels (less than 50 micrograms/ml). All conjugates were cleared largely via the kidney (greater than 80% of the dose) and, except for the 2-methyl analog, eliminated rapidly from plasma. Plasma concentration and renal excretion rate data were analyzed simultaneously with a previously developed physiologically based kidney model. Tubular secretion appeared to be a function of the total drug concentration in renal plasma, except for 2-methylbenzoylglycine, presumably due to its tight protein binding. The average values of the parameters characterizing the tubular transport maximum (TM in milligrams per minute) and the apparent affinity for the secretory system (KT in micrograms per milliliter) were: benzoylglycine TM = 5.5 +/- 0.8, KT = 40 +/- 5; 3-methylbenzoylglycine TM = 7.1 +/- 3.3, KT = 49 +/- 1; 4-methylbenzoylglycine TM = 8.0 +/- 1.6, KT = 14 +/- 6. Secretion of 2-methylbenzoylglycine was not saturated. Accordingly, only the ratio TM/KT = 163 +/- 54 ml/min could be calculated.

Plasma protein binding of 4-amino-, 3-hydroxy- and 4-hydroxybenzoylglycine was low (less than 15%) and practically constant over a range of 5 to 450 micrograms/ml, whereas the 2-hydroxy analog showed concentration-dependent protein binding (40-80%). The excretory patterns of the 4-amino, 3- and 4-hydroxy analogs were essentially the same; rapid elimination from plasma into urine (greater than 80% of the dose), mainly by very efficient supply-limited tubular secretion. Conversely, the excretion of 2-hydroxybenzoylglycine was characterized by a lower plasma clearance and total renal excretion (64% of the dose), and a limited capacity of the tubular secretory system. The methoxybenzoylglycines showed nonlinear plasma protein binding varying between 10 and 70%, rapid clearance from plasma, largely by renal excretion (72-84% of the administered dose). Tubular secretion of 2- and 3-methoxybenzoylglycine was saturated, whereas complete saturation was not achieved for the 4-methoxy isomer.

Ro 5-4864 produced a biphasic response (consisting of an increase followed by a decrease in spontaneous firing) in approximately 50% of the neurons studied. The remaining neurons responded to Ro 5-4864 application with decreased spontaneous activity. The EC50 and IC50 values for the excitatory and depressant responses to Ro 5-4864 were 490 and 450 nM, respectively. Preincubation with PK 11195 [N-methyl-N-(methyl-1-propyl)chloro-2-phenyl-1-isoquinoline-3-carboxamid e; a peripheral benzodiazepine receptor antagonist] reduced the potency of Ro 5-4864 to inhibit cell firing in a competitive fashion, but did not alter Ro 5-4864-elicited excitations. A similar effect was observed with the monocarboxylic acid anion transport inhibitor UK 5099 [alpha-cyano-beta-(1-phenylindol-3-yl)acrylate]. In contrast, the increases in cell firing elicited by t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (a GABA-gated chloride channel blocker) were enhanced 6-fold by coperfusion with both Ro 5-4864 and PK 11195. These findings suggest that the Ro 5-4864 induced depressions of Purkinje neuron spontaneous activity is mediated by peripheral benzodiazepine receptors, whereas the excitation may result from modulation of the gamma-aminobutyric acid-gated chloride ionophore.\r"

The decrease in 5-HIAA concentration after a 3 mg/kg s.c. dose of buspirone persisted at 4 hr but not at 7 hr. The decrease was due apparently to a reduced turnover of serotonin; the accumulation of 5-hydroxytryptophan after decarboxylase inhibition was also suppressed by buspirone, not only in hypothalamus but also in brain stem, hippocampus and striatum. 1-(2-Pyrimidinyl)-piperazine (1-PP), a major metabolite of buspirone, did not affect hypothalamic 5-HIAA concentration at doses up to 10 mg/kg s.c. Both buspirone and 1-PP increased hypothalamic concentrations of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol (MHPG) sulfate, the norepinephrine metabolite, the effect being more pronounced with 1-PP but occurring after doses as low as 0.3 mg/kg s.c. with each compound. The increase in MHPG sulfate concentration persisted for at least 4 hr after a 3 mg/kg s.c. dose of each compound. The increase in MHPG sulfate produced by buspirone may have been due partly to 5-HT-1A receptor activation, inasmuch as other serotonin agonists have been found to cause a similar increase. 1-PP is reported to lack affinity for 5-HT-1A receptors so its elevation of MHPG sulfate concentration may have resulted from alpha-2 receptor blockade. The increase in MHPG sulfate concentration after buspirone injection may have been due at least partly to formation of the metabolite, 1-PP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Dogs were divided into two groups; one group received no pretreatment, the other group was pretreated with atropine sulfate, 2 mg/kg. Both groups received two i.v. doses of cocaine, 1 mg/kg, approximately 3.5 hr apart. Thirty minutes before administration of the second cocaine dose, yohimbine, 0.25 mg/kg, i.v. was administered. In control animals which did not receive atropine or yohimbine, there was no difference in the cardiovascular responses to the two cocaine doses administered on this schedule. Administration of cocaine alone increased mean arterial blood pressure 9.6 +/- 2.2 mm Hg and increased the rate-pressure product, an index of myocardial oxygen consumption, 12.6 +/- 4.7%. Coronary blood flow was increased 13.1 +/- 4%. Yohimbine pretreatment significantly enhanced the cardiovascular actions of cocaine and this enhancement was most pronounced in the presence of atropine. When cocaine was administered after treatment with both atropine and yohimbine, mean arterial blood pressure was increased 44.2 +/- 7.2 mm Hg, heart rate was increased 30 +/- 7.9 beats/min and the rate-pressure product was increased by 72 +/- 10.1%, whereas coronary blood flow was increased only 42.8 +/- 12%. These data suggest that presynaptic alpha adrenergic and cholinergic muscarinic blockade may significantly increase the risk of cocaine-induced cardiovascular toxicity.\r"

  ".W": "A single i.p. administration of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) caused within 1 wk of exposure a dose-dependent progressive inhibition of liver fatty acid synthetic rate with concomitant decreases in hepatic fatty acid synthetase and acetylcoenzyme A carboxylase activities. Similarly, hepatic cholesterol synthetic rate was markedly inhibited with increasing dosage of TCDD, although the corresponding decrease in 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase activity was of lesser magnitude. Linear regression analyses of the reciprocals of the responses versus the dose revealed that the TCDD concentration which caused 50% inhibition of the activities of various lipogenic enzymes and of lipid synthetic rates ranged from 11 to 20 micrograms/kg (34-67 nM) with an average of 15 micrograms/kg (47 nM). Hepatic cholesterol synthesis seemed to be more sensitive to inhibition than fatty acid synthesis whether it was based on TCDD dosage or duration of exposure. The degree of inhibition of all the above parameters except fatty acid synthesis in liver and adipose tissues increased from 1 to 2 wk of exposure but was less pronounced after 4 wk exposure. Significantly, the adipose tissue was found to be more sensitive than the liver with respect to inhibition of fatty acid synthesis by increasing dosage of TCDD. Thus, the biochemical mechanism of loss of adipose mass caused by TCDD exposure may well be mediated by strong inhibition of lipid synthesis in the adipose tissue coupled with increased mobilization of depot fat.\r"

In the presence of atropine (10(-6) M), propranolol (10(-6) M), phentolamine (10(-5) M), indomethacin (10(-6) M) and pyrilamine (5 x 10(-6) M) EFS (biphasic; pulse width, 1.0 msec; frequency 0.5-5 Hz for 30 sec; intensity, 20 V) produced noncholinergic, nonadrenergic muscle contraction in a frequency-dependent fashion (P less than .001). Phosphoramidon potentiated the contractile responses to EFS (P less than .01). Leucine-thiorphan (10(-5) M), another NEP inhibitor, potentiated EFS-induced contraction in a similar fashion as phosphoramidon (186 and 182% of control, respectively; each comparison, P less than .025). Captopril, bestatin, leupeptin and physostigmine (each drug, 10(-5) M) were without effect (P greater than .5, N = 5). Capsaicin (1.5 x 10(-8) M) produced long-lasting atropine-resistant smooth muscle contraction, an effect potentiated by phosphoramidon (10(-5) M (P less than .001). Removal of the epithelium slightly but significantly (P less than .05) increased the contractile responses to capsaicin and to EFS at impulse frequencies of 2 and 5 Hz, and phosphoramidon substantially increased contractions in tissues without epithelium. The trachea, bronchi and lungs each contained significant NEP activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Association rates (k+1) of 1.25 x 10(8) M-1 min-1 and 2.49 x 10(8) M-1 min-1 at 25 and 37 degrees C, respectively, were obtained, whereas dissociation rates (k-1) at the same temperatures were 1.93 x 10(-2) min-1 and 1.03 x 10(-1) min-1 at 25 and 37 degrees C, respectively. Saturation isotherms of [3H]CTOP binding to rat brain membranes gave apparent Kd values of 0.16 and 0.41 nM at 25 and 37 degrees C, respectively. Maximal number of binding sites in rat brain membranes were found to be 94 and 81 fmol/mg of protein at 25 and 37 degrees C, respectively. [3H]CTOP binding over a concentration range of 0.1 to 10 nM was best fit by a one site model consistent with binding to a single site. The general effect of different metal ions and guanyl-5'-yl-imidodiphosphate on [3H]CTOP binding was to reduce its affinity. High concentrations (100 mM) of sodium also produced a reduction of the apparent mu receptor density. Utilizing the delta opioid receptor specific peptide [3H]-[D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin, CTOP appeared to be about 2000-fold more specific for mu vs. delta opioid receptor than naloxone. Specific [3H]CTOP binding was inhibited by a large number of opioid or opiate ligands.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We investigated the effects of experimental diabetes on muscarinic receptors in rat bladder smooth muscle, 2, 4 and 8 weeks after i.v. injection of 65 mg/kg of streptozotocin. At all time points, diabetic animals had a lower body weight, higher serum glucose levels and reduced serum insulin levels than age-matched controls. Diabetic animals had a markedly increased urine output and significant enlargement of the bladder dome. The amount of muscarinic receptor labeled with [3H]quinuclidinyl benzylate (QNB) was higher in the bladder dome of diabetic animals than control animals, whereas the affinity of the labeled antagonist for its binding sites was similar in both groups. Muscarinic agonists and antagonists inhibited [3H]QNB binding with similar inhibitory constants (Ki) in control and diabetic dome. The rank order of Ki values in inhibition of [3H]QNB binding by muscarinic agonists and antagonists: atropine less than acetylcholine less than carbachol less than AF-DX 116 = pirenzepine less than bethanechol, is consistent with the presence of M2 muscarinic receptors in the bladder dome. In functional studies, muscarinic agonists induced a larger contractile response in bladder dome muscle strips from 8-week-diabetic animals than from controls. ED50 values were similar in control and treated groups, with the rank order of ED50 values being in good agreement with the Ki values obtained from receptor binding studies, i.e., acetylcholine less than carbachol less than bethanechol. These data show a direct correlation between the diabetes-induced biochemical and functional alterations in muscarinic receptor properties of rat bladder.\r"

CGS 20625 had a gamma-aminobutyric acid ratio of 0.9 and increased t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate binding by 20% in vitro, a profile indicative of a partial agonist or mixed agonist/antagonist. In vivo, CGS 20625 blocked a pentylenetetrazol discriminative cue with an ED50 = 1.7 mg/kg p.o. The compound selectively increased conflict responding in the Cook-Davidson paradigm with a minimal effective dose of 0.3 mg/kg p.o., as compared with 3.0 mg/kg p.o. for diazepam. At doses as high as 100 mg/kg p.o., CGS 20625 had no effect on variable interval responding, suggesting minimal sedation. Unlike diazepam, CGS 20625 had no effect on rotorod performance at doses up to 100 mg/kg p.o. indicating no overt muscle relaxation, and did not potentiate the action of ethanol in this behavioral paradigm. Also, CGS 20625 had no marked effect on locomotor behavior, did not potentiate hexobarbital sleep time and had no sedative activity at doses up to 300 mg/kg p.o. CGS 20625 was efficacious in preventing pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures (ED50 = 0.7 mg/kg p.o.), had less efficacy with no clear dose-response relationship against picrotoxin-induced seizures and had no effect on either strychnine or electroshock-induced convulsions at doses up to 300 mg/kg p.o.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At low concentrations (33 microM) of the cofactor (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-L-biopterin dihydrochloride TH activity was increased 2.5 to 3-fold. Kinetic analysis of TH activity as a function of (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-L-biopterin dihydrochloride concentration indicated that the enzyme isolated from control slices was composed of multiple species with different Km's for cofactor. Treatment with forskolin (1.5-15 microM) converted the enzyme into a single species with a low Km (28 microM) for (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-L-biopterin dihydrochloride. The dopamine (DA) agonist R-(-)-N-n-propylnorapomorphine (0.1 microM) reversed forskolin-induced activation of TH. Concentration-response curves were obtained for inhibition of forskolin-stimulated TH by R-(-)-N-n-propylnorapomorphine and the DA autoreceptor-selective agonists (+)- and (-)-3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-n-propylpiperidine and 3-[4-(4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridyl-1)-butyl]indole.

This \"exponential growth\" assumption, however, may not always be as biologically plausible as the alternative assumption that cells tend to grow geometrically in time. The general CKM model and applications of it that presume exponential cell growth are reviewed here. Geometric CKM models are then considered, previous erroneous analyses of these models are reviewed, and a corrected mathematical treatment is provided. It is pointed out that the presumption of exponential instead of geometric proliferation kinetics may lead to underestimates of small increments in CKM-predicted cancer risk above background if the geometric assumption is true. An evaluation of pertinent biological evidence is provided, which indicates that precancerous cells may typically proliferate geometrically. Consequently, if CKM models are used for environmental risk assessment, it may be prudent for one to presume geometric cell growth unless specific data support an alternative assumption.\r"

In multivariate analyses, the relative risks of breast cancer for women in the highest quintile of consumption of saturated fat and animal proteins were 3.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.9-4.7) and 2.9 (1.8-4.6), respectively. A reduced risk was found for women who derived less than 28% of calories from fat versus greater than 36%. A similarly reduced risk was found for women who derived less than 9.6% of calories from saturated fat or less than 5.9% from animal proteins.

All of the rats in group 3 developed mammary hyperplasia and tumors (fibroadenomas and lipomas), in some cases with malignant histologic structure. Rats in group 4 developed similar mammary tumors, but with later appearance and significantly slower growth. A fifth group of rats, not virus inoculated but castrated and estrogen treated as in group 3, did not develop any demonstrable mammary lesions. The results show that the effects of the virus on the mammary gland are dependent upon an estrogenic background, which by itself cannot cause tumor development in males. It is suggested that viral DNA is incorporated into the cellular DNA in such a way that it influences the synthesis and/or activity of steroid receptors, triggering tumor development.\r"

For (DBA/2 X BALB/c)F1 mice, 50 mg of L-histidinol per mouse was required for protection; for hematopoietic precursor cells, protection was dependent on the dose of L-histidinol. In contrast, both L1210 leukemia cells and colon 26 adenocarcinoma cells were more efficiently killed by combinations of L-histidinol and cisplatin.

To further evaluate the underlying risk of disease in these patients, we compared the incidence of all cancers with that expected in the general population. The average radiation dose was approximately 500 mGy to the thyroid and less than 10 mGy to other organs. In the 35,074 patients, 3,746 cancers occurred following the first 5 years after examination, and the resulting standardized incidence rate (SIR) was 1.01 (95% confidence interval = 0.98-1.04). SIRs were significantly increased for endocrine tumors other than thyroid cancer (1.93) and for lymphomas (1.24), leukemias (1.34), and nervous system tumors (1.19). The risk of leukemia was similar for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (SIR = 1.30) and non-CLL (SIR = 1.34). SIR was significantly decreased for cancers of the female genital organs (0.86). The risk for cancer of all sites and types combined was highest 5-9 years after examination (SIR = 1.07) and did not differ from unity thereafter. With greater than or equal to 10 years of follow-up, risk was not statistically associated with the dose of 131I. Overall, the data exclude cancer risk increments greater than 5% (SIR = 1.05) with 95% confidence. The significant increase in the risk of non-CLL, a prominent radiogenic malignancy, however, warrants special attention. We are continuing our study to determine the possible factors involved in the significant increase in the risk of leukemia.\r"

This technique has been used in 20 patients undergoing adrenalectomy for hyperplasia or a small benign adenoma. In our series chest tube drainage usually was not necessary, operative morbidity was minimal and most patients were discharged from the hospital within 1 week postoperatively. The posterior surgical approach remains an excellent method to perform adrenalectomy in selected patients. The transthoracic modification described can enhance operative exposure of a high-lying adrenal gland through this incision, particularly on the right side.\r"

  ".W": "In a short-term prospective study 36 patients with absorptive hypercalciuria were initially treated with diet alone followed by either trichlormethiazide (4 mg. per day) or oral neutral phosphate (1,500 mg. of elemental phosphorus per day) for 6 weeks. Study subjects were then crossed over to the second drug for an additional 6 weeks. In response to dietary treatment urinary calcium decreased from a pre-treatment value of 346 +/- 63 mg. per 24 hours to 308 +/- 90 mg. per 24 hours. Oral phosphate therapy caused a further decrease in urinary calcium to 218 +/- 85 mg. per 24 hours, an over-all decrease of 37 per cent. Parathyroid function did not change significantly with phosphate administration but circulating levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D decreased by 22 per cent (73 +/- 12 to 57 +/- 16 pg. per ml., p less than 0.001). Pre-treatment renal phosphate threshold did not correlate with the response to oral phosphate administration. Trichlormethiazide treatment led to a 34 per cent decrease in urinary calcium with a mean value on treatment of 228 +/- 80 mg. per 24 hours. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D levels decreased by 10 per cent. Pre-treatment fasting calcium excretion, parathyroid function and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels did not correlate with the response to trichlormethiazide. We conclude that both drugs by pharmacological means improve the biochemical abnormalities in absorptive hypercalciuria and should be efficacious in its treatment.\r"

Laser energy of a neodymium:YAG laser with an 8 nsec. pulse duration and a repetition rate of up to 50 Hz. was coupled into a flexible 600 resp. 400 micron. quartz fiber. Laser-induced breakdown was created with 35 to 50 mJ. at the fiber tip, resulting in a shock wave that disintegrated the calculus into tiny fragments. A total of 56 patients with 58 calculi (54 ureteral and 4 kidney stones) was treated from June 1987 to March 1988. Of the calculi 48 could be fragmented completely, while 6 others were reduced to a size small enough to be removed with forceps. Four stones composed of calcium oxalate monohydrate could not be disintegrated. The combination of laser stone disintegration with flexible ureterorenoscopy implies the possibility of an atraumatic, 1-step procedure for fragmentation of ureteral and kidney calculi.\r"

Patients were followed for a median of 10.1 years. Nuclei were extracted from paraffin-embedded archival material and isolated nuclei were stained with propidium iodide. Of the 76 tumors 73 were evaluable by flow cytometry providing high quality deoxyribonucleic acid histograms: 27 (37 per cent) showed a deoxyribonucleic acid diploid or normal pattern, 17 (23 per cent) exhibited a significant increase in the 4C peak (deoxyribonucleic acid tetraploid) and 29 (40 per cent) showed a distinct aneuploid peak. High grade (grades 3 and 4) and high stage (stages T2 to T4) tumors had a significantly higher incidence of abnormal (either tetraploid or aneuploid) deoxyribonucleic acid patterns than low grade (grades 1 and 2) and low stage (stages Tis/Ta/T1) tumors (p less than 0.005). The 5 and 10-year rate free of disease for patients with deoxyribonucleic acid diploid tumors was 67 per cent compared to 22 and 18 per cent, respectively, for patients with tumors showing abnormal ploidy patterns (p less than 0.0005). At 5 and 10 years after diagnosis an estimated 18 per cent of the patients with deoxyribonucleic acid diploid tumors will die of bladder cancer. In contrast, an estimated 53 per cent of the patients with tetraploid tumors and 82 per cent and 86 per cent of those with aneuploid tumors will die of squamous cell bladder carcinoma by 5 and 10 years after diagnosis (p less than 0.0001). These results demonstrate that nuclear deoxyribonucleic ploidy measured by flow cytometry is an important objective prognostic variable for patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder.\r"

Initially, scheduled 2-hour voiding resulted in a mean 33.1 per cent increase in urge incontinence, a mean 28.5 per cent decrease in stress incontinence and no change in continual leakage. Subsequently, biofeedback was used to teach selective control of the sphincter muscles and/or inhibition of detrusor contractions. Individualized home practice included a voiding schedule, sphincter exercises, active use of the sphincter to prevent urine loss and strategies to manage urgency. After 1 to 5 biofeedback sessions patients with urge incontinence demonstrated an average 80.7 per cent decrease in incontinence, while stress incontinence was decreased an average 78.3 per cent and patients with continual leakage were less successful, with a mean 17.0 per cent improvement. The findings indicate that biofeedback training is an effective intervention for episodic stress or urge incontinence after prostatectomy. However, its usefulness appears to be limited in patients with postoperative incontinence characterized by continual leakage.\r"

Followup ranged from 3 to 37 months, with an average of 20.8 months. There were 112 (76 per cent) male and 36 (24 per cent) female patients. The cuff was implanted around the bladder neck in 78 patients (53 per cent) and around the bulbar urethra in 70 (47 per cent). Socially acceptable urinary control was achieved in 90 per cent of the 139 patients with active devices in place. It was necessary to remove the sphincter in 11 patients (7.4 per cent). The reasons for removal were infection and erosion in 8 patients (5.4 per cent), infection without erosion in 2 (1.3 per cent), and erosion due to excess pressure and poor tissues in 1 (0.7 per cent). Comparison of success and failure rates associated with incontinence of different etiologies revealed that patients with incontinence after failure of a conventional antistress incontinence operation and those with incontinence after transurethral resection or radical prostactectomy had the highest success rate, and that patients with incontinence secondary to pelvic fracture or exstrophy and epispadias had the highest failure rates. The deactivation feature (the lock) of the new artificial sphincter model was beneficial for primary deactivation, urethral catheterization or cystoscopy, or for elective nocturnal decompression of the bladder neck or urethral tissues.\r"

A prolonged bulbocavernosus reflex latency (that is more than 45 msec.) or the absence of a reflex response of the bulbocavernosus muscles during electrical stimulation of the glans penis is considered a sign of neurological disease. Since only a few experimental studies have been performed in man related to the neurophysiological mechanism of erection, and since the results of these studies were contradictory the diagnostic validity of bulbocavernosus reflex measurement was reassessed. We determine whether men with abnormal bulbocavernosus reflex latencies have concomitant organic erectile dysfunction as confirmed by nocturnal plethysmographic and rigidity recordings. The bulbocavernosus reflex was recorded in 90 subjects and 19 had abnormal bulbocavernosus reflex latencies. Of these 19 subjects 8 had normal nocturnal erections, thus, confirming a diagnosis of psychogenic impotence. These results cast some doubts on the validity of bulbocavernosus reflex measurement for the diagnosis of organic erectile dysfunction due to a neurological disease.\r"

Poor response was seen frequently in patients with disorders of the vascular system and/or damage to the cavernous body of the penis. Priapism after the injection was not observed. Moreover, we never observed any other severe side effects. Intracavernous injection of prostaglandin E1 could be applicable to the therapy of impotence, especially that due to neurogenic disturbance. Since prostaglandin E1 acts quickly and loses its validity rapidly it is considered to be a more suitable agent than other vasoactive drugs.\r"

Chlamydia trachomatis was not isolated from any patient or control. No other significant differences were found between patients and controls. We did not identify an infectious cause of chronic nonbacterial prostatitis.\r"

  ".W": "Although tumor volume is an important factor in predicting prognosis in carcinoma of the prostate, direct and accurate estimation of tumor volume is not practical clinically at present because the tumor may not always be palpable (stage A) and when palpable it is difficult to estimate volume in 3 dimensions. For this reason the clinical staging of prostate cancer currently is based on estimations of the per cent of gland involved with tumor: in stage A by per cent of tissue involved with cancer and in stage B by digital palpation (less than 1 lobe, 1 lobe and 2 lobes). In stage A prostate cancer the per cent of the specimen involved with tumor and the volume of tumor have been shown to correlate with tumor progression. Our study was designed to determine if either or both of these morphometric factors would be good predictors of pathological stage in stage B prostate cancer. We analyzed 56 step-sectioned radical prostatectomy specimens: 28 without capsular penetration, 15 with capsular penetration only and 13 with seminal vesicle involvement. The per cent of gland involved with tumor (correlation coefficient 0.67, p less than 0.001) and tumor volume (correlation coefficient 0.55, p less than 0.001) correlated well with pathological stage. Stepwise linear regression showed that the combination of the per cent of gland involved with tumor and the total Gleason grade was statistically the best predictor of pathological stage.\r"

Whole-mount sectioning of the prostate was performed at 4 mm. intervals and processed in the same manner as radical prostatectomy specimens. A total of 36 patients (43 per cent) had transitional cell carcinoma of the prostate: 94 per cent of these had prostatic urethra involvement and 6 per cent had a normal prostatic urethra but transitional cell carcinoma was present in the periurethral structures. In situ prostatic duct or acini, ejaculatory duct and seminal vesicle involvement occurred, respectively, in 67, 8 and 17 per cent of the patients with prostatic involvement. Of the patients with prostatic involvement 39 per cent had stromal invasion (22 per cent focal and 17 per cent diffuse invasion). The incidence of carcinoma in situ of the bladder neck or trigone (59 per cent), previous intravesical chemotherapy (59 per cent) and ureteral carcinoma (79 per cent) was significantly increased in patients with prostatic involvement. In patients with carcinoma in situ of the trigone or bladder neck, or in whom previous intravesical chemotherapy treatments have failed prostatic involvement should be suspected so that this disease can be detected before stromal invasion occurs.\r"

The electrical techniques that have been described to test sensation involve the use of costly and complex equipment; electrical current also is not the natural stimulator of bladder nerves. Trigonal sensitivity testing held promise as a simple, effective and inexpensive test of bladder sensation. We evaluated a modified version of this technique in 89 women: 78 had urodynamically proved lower urinary tract dysfunction and 11 were control patients. The technique proved to be of no value in distinguishing among various urodynamic diagnoses. In particular, patients with detrusor instability or bladder hypersensitivity showed no characteristic patterns on trigonal sensitivity testing. Sensitivity values correlated neither with the first sensation to void nor the cystometric bladder capacity during urodynamic testing. It does not appear to contribute any clinically useful information in the evaluation of lower urinary tract dysfunction in women.\r"

The Whitaker test was performed using the standard perfusion rate of 10 ml./min. in male adult dogs using a long-term indwelling renal intrapelvic cannula before and after application of ureteric obstruction, and after one month. Control animals underwent a sham procedure. Results of in vivo and in vitro perfusion studies were compared. Perfusion studies at multiple flow rates were also performed. The Whitaker test reliably detected the presence of ureteric obstruction and the degree of partial obstruction could be determined. Multiple flow rate studies did not significantly improve test results. Provoked pressures in the highest grade of obstruction were less than expected and this may be due to pyelovenous reflux.\r"

The presence of obstruction was confirmed by intravenous pyelography. Growth rate of the animals and furosemide-stimulated diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid renography were used to grade the obstruction. As correlated to urinary creatinine concentration the excretion of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha dominated in nephrectomized, unobstructed control animals. With the degree of ureteral obstruction becoming more severe, the output of PGE2 increased, while that of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and TxB2 decreased. As a result the ratios PGE2/6-keto-PGF1 alpha and PGE2/TxB2 were three times as high in severely obstructed rabbits as in control animals. The renal output of cyclic AMP was unaffected by chronic obstruction. We conclude that the renal metabolism of prostanoids is affected in a unique way in chronic partial obstruction of the ureter.\r"

In five dogs the internal pudendal or penile artery was acutely clamped unilaterally or bilaterally with a non-crushing vascular clamp. In eight dogs, the internal pudendal or penile artery was ligated, unilaterally or bilaterally, and occlusion was maintained for two months. In both models, electrodes were implanted around the cavernous nerves for electroerection. In unilateral occlusion, blood flow in the contralateral internal pudendal artery was recorded via an ultrasonic probe. In both unilateral and bilateral occlusion, intracavernous pressure in both corpora cavernosa was recorded through a 21-gauge butterfly needle connected to a Statham transducer. In the chronic model, selective pudendal angiography was done after the erection study was completed; the dogs were then sacrificed and the penile tissue was examined histologically under light microscopy. Unilateral acute clamping of the internal pudendal or penile artery caused a compensatory increase in arterial flow in the contralateral pudendal artery with only moderate impairment of intracavernous pressure on the ipsilateral side, but bilateral occlusion resulted in a marked reduction in the intracavernous pressure response to neurostimulation. In contrast, chronic obstruction of penile vessels had a minimal effect on erectile function due to the development of a rich network of collaterals around the penis. Histological evaluation revealed mild local changes in the cavernous tissue with characteristic compensatory enlargement of branches of the cavernous artery on the control side in cases of unilateral occlusion.\r"

  ".W": "Urinary diversion is the final therapeutic approach in several bladder pathologies including selected cases of bladder cancer, neurogenic bladder, and painful bladder syndrome. While there have been a few experimental studies on the effects of urinary diversion and subsequent undiversion on bladder capacity, the pharmacological changes occurring with diversion and undiversion have not yet been investigated. Our primary objectives were to determine the functional and pharmacological alterations in the defunctionalized bladder and the effects of refunctionalization on these changes. Thirty-two male adult canines weighing 15 to 20 lb. were used for this study. Three groups of dogs were urine diverted for one, three, and six month durations (four dogs per group). Another three groups of dogs were urine diverted for one, three, and six months (four dogs per group); these dogs were then undiverted for three months. Six control animals received either one or two sham operations at one, three, and six months. In all groups the functional and contractile characteristics of the bladders were assessed by urodynamics and in vitro contractile studies; bladder weight and muscarinic receptor density were also measured. Intravesical capacities determined by in vivo cystometry were reduced significantly to 74%, 63%, and 47% of control values at one, three, and six months respectively after urinary diversion. Bladder capacity returned to above normal levels in bladders diverted and then subsequently undiverted. Similarly, the compliance and bladder weight of the diverted bladders were significantly less than control, while diverted bladders subsequently undiverted were similar to controls. Maximal bladder contractility in response to bethanechol stimulation was less in diverted bladders compared to control. This decrease in contractility was accompanied by a decrease in muscarinic receptor density. After undiversion maximal bladder contractility to bethanechol reached control levels; this was accompanied by a parallel increase in muscarinic receptor density to control values. There was no effect of diversion or undiversion on the maximal response of bladder strips to methoxamine stimulation. Thus, a bladder that has been diverted (defunctionalized) for a period of time showed decreases in capacity, compliance, and contractility to muscarinic stimulation along with a decrease in muscarinic receptor density. All of these parameters were restored after refunctionalization of the bladder.\r"

Intravenous administration of raveron reduced both the passive and active pressure in dog detrusor in vivo. It did not act in a dose dependent fashion. Chronic treatment with raveron for three to four months caused changes in in rabbits with vesical neck obstruction. An increase in contractility along with a reduced rate of increase in passive force (measurement of bladder stiffness) was observed in relation to obstructed rabbits without treatment. Parallel morphological changes were also observed in this group, consisting of increased muscular hypertrophy, decreased bladder wall thickness and reduced collagen content (readings taken from Masson-Trichrome sections). No influence was observed with bladder specimens from rabbits with six to eight week vesical obstruction or normals that received treatment. In vitro dose response studies showed that a 3.3% dose of raveron significantly reduced passive force in two groups (treated normals and treated rabbits with six to eight week vesical obstruction). Pharmacology studies with potassium chloride and acetylcholine suggest that raveron acts as a calcium antagonist by blocking the influx of extracellular calcium.\r"

The peptides examined included: vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, substance P, somatostatin, [Met]enkephalin, bombesin and gastrin. The greatest density of nerves was found in the smooth muscle of the distal urethra, followed by the bladder neck, middle urethra, and proximal urethra, with the least in the detrusor muscle. The greatest number of nerve fibres stained for acetylcholinesterase, followed by vasoactive intestinal polypeptide- and catecholamine-containing fibres. Substance P-immunoreactive nerve fibres were confined to the bladder neck and distal urethral regions. [Met]enkephalin-and gastrin-immunoreactive nerves were most dense in the distal urethra but absent in detrusor muscle, while somatostatin-immunoreactive nerve fibres were sparsely distributed throughout the lower urinary tract. No nerve fibres showing immunoreactivity to bombesin were found. Catecholamine-containing, acetylcholinesterase-positive, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-, substance P-, [Met]enkephalin- and gastrin-immunoreactive nerves were also found on the adventitial-medial border of blood vessels in the pig urinary tract. In the intrinsic external urethral sphincter, located in the distal urethra, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide- and gastrin-immunoreactive nerve fibres were found bordering a small number of individual striated muscle fibres, while catecholamine-containing nerves were found predominantly in the connective tissue surrounding the striated muscle fibres. Dense populations of acetylcholinesterase-positive nerve fibres were found associated with the striated muscle fibres, with end plates on some of them. Intramural ganglia, composed of two to 30 neurones, were found in the bladder neck and middle and distal regions of the urethra. In the smooth muscle, and in the vicinity of the striated muscle regions of the intrinsic external urethral sphincter, there were small ganglia, containing two to three neurones, which were vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-, [Met]enkephalin- and somatostatin-immunoreactive. The results are compared to the autonomic innervation of the human bladder and urethra as previously described and it is concluded that the lower urinary tract of the pig is a good model for some features of the lower urinary tract of man, but a poor model for others.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of oxalate on kidney mitochondria were evaluated in vitro to test whether oxalate exposure leads to derangement(s) in mitochondrial function that could in turn promote the formation of kidney stones. Our previous studies demonstrated that oxalate is transported across the mitochondrial membrane via the dicarboxylate carrier. The present studies indicated that oxalate competitively inhibits the uptake and oxidation of exogenous malate and succinate in isolated mitochondria but has no effect on mitochondrial respiration in the presence of a mixture of glutamate plus malate or glutamate plus pyruvate. Oxalate attenuates the increase in mitochondrial respiration produced by the uncoupler CCCP or by the Ca2+ ionophore A23187, and the latter effect is more pronounced in kidney than in liver mitochondria. The apparent Ki of oxalate for the response to Ca2+ ionophore is 1.9 +/- 0.3 mM in kidney and 6.1 +/- 0.2 mM in liver mitochondria. Similarly, the ability of oxalate to attenuate calcium-induced swelling of mitochondria is more dramatic in kidney than in liver mitochondria (apparent KiS of 1.7 +/- 0.1 and 18.2 +/- 0.7 mM, respectively). Oxalate has no effect on the rate of calcium uptake by energized mitochondria or on the rate of ruthenium red-insensitive calcium efflux from mitochondria in either tissue. The above findings indicate that oxalate interacts with the inner mitochondrial membrane or with processes controlling membrane integrity to a greater extent in kidney than liver mitochondria. The effects of oxalate on membrane permeability or integrity may be more important than its effects on mitochondrial energy production or calcium sequestration in the pathogenesis of calcium oxalate microlith formation in the kidney.\r"

Two major contraindications in using an ileal ureter are compromised renal function (serum creatinine greater than 2) and a functionally abnormal bladder. We used ileum to bridge a ureteral defect in animals with half of a solitary kidney and low grade azotemia to see if the antirefluxing mechanism of the lower ureter prevented further deterioration in renal function. Twelve female mongrel dogs underwent a right nephrectomy, followed by a left partial nephrectomy six weeks later. Group I (six dogs) had a six cm. segment of ileum interposed between the upper and lower ureteral segments (nonrefluxing). Group II (five dogs) had a ten cm. segment of ileum placed from the upper third of the ureter to the bladder (refluxing). Cystograms, intravenous pyelograms, serum electrolytes, BUN and creatinine were obtained preoperatively, six weeks after the right nephrectomy, one month after left partial nephrectomy and six months after ileal replacement prior to sacrifice. The BUN and creatinine deteriorated in Group II compared to Group I, p = .02 and p = 0.4 respectively (Mann-Whitney test). The BUN and creatinine also deteriorated between one month after left partial nephrectomy and six months after ileal replacement within Group II, p = .07 and p = .14, respectively (Wilcoxon matched-pairs test) but not in Group I. These data suggest that the antirefluxing mechanism of the lower ureter might prevent further deterioration in renal function. We feel that ileum can be used with caution, as an interposition in compromised renal function.\r"

  ".W": "In 10 formalin-preserved adult male cadavers, dissection of the penile veins, arteries and nerves revealed information of clinical importance. The main venous drainage of the corpora cavernosa is via the cavernous veins, with additional drainage through the circumflex, deep dorsal, and crural veins. The arterial supply of the cavernous bodies varied remarkably, and the incidence of an accessory internal pudendal artery was high. The cavernous nerves, previously believed to be microscopic structures, were in fact identifiable grossly, and we were able to follow them from the region of the hilum of the penis to the prostate. The nature of these nerves was then confirmed by serial histologic sectioning. This detailed knowledge of the venous drainage and arterial and nervous supply of the penis, as well as of the relationships among the cavernous structures in the hilum of the penis, can elucidate the cause of erectile dysfunction and provide a valuable guide for surgical correction of vasculogenic and neurogenic impotence.\r"

Exposures to nicotine measured during the flights using personal exposure monitors were found to be variable, with some nonsmoking areas attaining levels comparable to those in smoking sections. Attendants assigned to work in nonsmoking areas were not protected from smoke exposure. The type of aircraft ventilation was important in determining the levels of in-flight nicotine exposure. The environmental tobacco smoke levels that occurred produced measurable levels of cotinine (a major metabolite of nicotine) in the urine of passengers and attendants. Passengers who experienced the greatest smoke exposure had the highest levels of urinary cotinine. Changes in eye and nose symptoms between the beginning and end of the flights were significantly related both to nicotine exposure during the flight and to the subsequent urinary excretion of cotinine. In addition, subjects' perceptions of annoyance and smokiness in the airplane cabin were also related to in-flight nicotine exposure and urinary excretion measures.\r"

In the patients with office hypertension, both the left atrial index and left ventricular mass index were significantly less than in patients with daytime hypertension and not statistically different from those of the normotensive subjects. Left ventricular filling rate at rest and ejection fraction at peak exercise were significantly greater in the office hypertensive group than in the daytime hypertensive group but were no different from those of the normotensive subjects. These findings demonstrate that patients with blood pressure elevation only in the physician's office have cardiac size and function similar to those of normotensive individuals. Thus, the average daily blood pressure best predicts cardiac end-organ damage.\r"

We prospectively compared physical signs with hemodynamic measurements in 50 patients with known chronic heart failure (ejection fraction, .18 +/- .06). Rales, edema, and elevated mean jugular venous pressure were absent in 18 of 43 patients with pulmonary capillary wedge pressures greater than or equal to 22 mm Hg, for which the combination of these signs had 58% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Proportional pulse pressure correlated well with cardiac index (r = .82), and when less than 25% pulse pressure had 91% sensitivity and 83% specificity for a cardiac index less than 2.2 L/min/m2. In chronic heart failure, reliance on physical signs for elevated ventricular filling pressure might result in inadequate therapy. Conversely, the adequacy of cardiac output is assessed reliably by pulse pressure. Our results facilitate decisions regarding treatment in chronic heart failure.\r"

She displayed no stigmata of Cushing's syndrome and had normal plasma and urinary cortisol levels. A second patient without clinical findings of Cushing's syndrome also had normal basal steroid levels. This patient displayed partial suppressibility with dexamethasone, had low-normal levels of serum corticotropin, and excreted a low concentration of urinary 17-ketosteroids. She also developed mild adrenal insufficiency after the operation. We believe the adrenal adenomas in these patients secreted enough cortisol to suppress the contralateral adrenal gland but not enough hormone to elevate basal steroid levels. Therefore, we suggest that all patients with adrenal masses be studied with the overnight dexamethasone suppression test rather than basal steroid hormone measurements to detect low levels of autonomous cortisol secretion. In addition, patients with adrenal masses that are not removed surgically should have serial adrenal function tests performed.\r"

Fifty-seven percent said that cigarettes would be harder to quit using than their problem substance. These ratings were related to the level of cigarette dependence and the perceived difficulty of quitting the use of the problem substance. The alcohol-dependent persons were about four times more likely than the drug-dependent persons to say that their strongest urges for cigarettes were at least as great as their strongest urges for their problem substance. Cigarettes were generally rated as less pleasurable than alcohol or other drugs. Thus, experiential experts on dependence judge cigarette dependence as at least as \"addictive\" as other drug use, but not as pleasurable, indicating important similarities and differences between cigarette dependence and other forms of dependence on psychoactive substances.\r"

Squamous cell carcinoma antigen levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. Elevated pretreatment serum levels of squamous cell carcinoma antigen were identified in 39 of 89 patients (44%) who had head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Of the 16 patients evaluated from this group with recurrent or persistent disease, 15 (93.5%) demonstrated elevated levels of squamous cell carcinoma antigen. However, of the 21 evaluable patients who remained disease free, only 10 (48%) had post-therapy levels within the normal range.

The most common cause for decannulation difficulty was subglottic stenosis (50%). Several risk factors were specifically identified, including a period of cricothyroid cannulation exceeding 30 days, the presence of diabetes, and advanced age. These findings suggest that airway sequelae following cricothyroidotomy in cardiothoracic surgery patients is higher than previously reported.

Although the disorder is usually self-limited, the potential exists for symptoms so severe that operative intervention cannot be avoided. Relief of progressive airway compromise traditionally has involved bypassing the obstruction with tracheotomy. Recently, endoscopic surgical management of the most severe cases has been reexamined by the authors and others. Thirteen infants and children underwent supraglottoplasty (also referred to as epiglottoplasty or partial arytenoidectomy) for severe, complicated laryngomalacia. Endoscopic laser removal of flaccid supraglottic tissue resulted in improvement of the airway in all patients. In most patients, associated symptoms improved or completely resolved. Supraglottoplasty is an effective alternative to tracheotomy in carefully selected patients with severe laryngomalacia.\r"

Forty-six tumors originated in the maxillary sinus, and 14 originated in the ethmoid sinuses. Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and endoscopic sinus examination aided in early diagnosis of sinus cancer. Computed tomography aided in staging tumors; Caldwell-Luc alone was inadequate for staging tumors invading deeper sites such as the orbits or pterygoid muscle. There were 15 early (T1 or T2) and 31 advanced (T3 or T4) maxillary sinus cancers. Multimodality therapy incorporated radiation, surgery, and chemotherapy. The 5-year survival rate was 49%. We prefer preoperative radiotherapy for advanced lesions and postoperative radiotherapy for early lesions. The use of preoperative radiation therapy has increased our globe salvage rate. All but one of the patients who developed recurrent disease showed recurrence at the primary site prior to developing regional or distant metastasis. Radiation therapy, combined with aggressive surgical management to remove all tumor, provided the best survival rates in advanced lesions.\r"

  ".W": "Malignant transformation of the squamous mucosa in the human oropharynx may be accompanied by alterations in carbohydrate production. Glycoconjugate expression was assessed by examining lectin-binding patterns and ABH isoantigen expression in human biopsy specimens from nine cases of carcinoma in situ and ten cases of invasive squamous cell carcinoma as well as adjacent normal squamous mucosa. Ten different fluorescein-conjugated lectins were used. Each lectin binds to specific nonreducing end-terminal carbohydrate residues. Wheat germ agglutinin and peanut agglutinin displayed intense cytoplasmic and/or membrane binding in more than 90% of the carcinoma in situ and squamous cell carcinoma specimens. However, only 40% of normal squamous epithelium specimens displayed intense cytoplasmic and/or membrane binding with wheat germ agglutinin and peanut agglutinin. Bandieraea simplicifolia I and Helix pomatia exhibited weak binding in less than 35% of normal and neoplastic tissues. Weak canavalia ensiformis binding was identified infrequently in the superficial layers of normal squamous mucosa, but was not found in neoplastic epithelium. None of the cases displayed binding for Dolichos biflorus, Ulex europaeus I, Sophora japonica, Glycine maximus, or Ricinus communis. Monoclonal antibodies directed against ABH blood group isoantigens showed increased cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for anti-H in dysplastic and neoplastic tissues, when compared with normal squamous mucosa. These findings indicate that wheat germ agglutinin and peanut agglutinin and H isoantigen are useful markers of malignancy in squamoproliferative lesions of the oropharynx, apparently reflecting alterations in expression of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and galactose-related sugars, which appear following malignant transformation.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to develop and describe in detail a reproducible porcine model for musculocutaneous flap study. The model was required to demonstrate the following: 1. consistent, easily identifiable anatomical landmarks for muscles and muscular vascular pedicles; 2. flap survival, consistent with the musculocutaneous perforator arrangement of blood supply; 3. ease of islanded- or free-flap formation; 4. arrangement of flaps on each animal, allowing paired studies of control and experimental flaps; and 5. a maximum number of flaps per animal, without undue morbidity or mortality. Pilot dissections were made of the pectoralis, trapezius, latissimus dorsi, gracilis, biceps femoris, and tensor fasciae latae muscles and their major vascular pedicles. After establishing the anatomical landmarks, we formed musculocutaneous flaps at each site to verify the above five requirements. A total of 72 muscle/vessel pedicle dissections were performed, incorporating formation of 61 island musculocutaneous flaps. The skin component overlying an islanded muscle block survived in 60 instances, confirming the reliability of the flap model. We concluded that five pairs of musculocutaneous flaps could be fashioned on one pig, using the bilateral control/experimental paradigm if desired. The pectoralis, latissimus dorsi, trapezius, gracilis, and biceps femoris muscles were used. The ventral muscle group (pectoralis, gracilis) was raised in one operating session, and the lateral muscles (trapezius, latissimus dorsi, biceps femoris) were raised in one further session per side. Three new porcine flaps are described--the pectoralis, biceps femoris, and trapezius. Morbidity was confined to mild splinting of the limbs for one day. This is also the first example of the use of ten musculocutaneous island flaps on one pig, and represents an opportunity for performing physiological, pathological, or pharmacological experiments on the musculocutaneous flap.\r"

  ".W": "Neurally mediated hypotension and bradycardia are believed to be common causes of syncope. We used the \"upright-tilt test\" (duration, less than or equal to 10 minutes) with or without an infusion of exogenous catecholamine (isoproterenol [1 to 5 micrograms per minute], given intravenously) to elicit bradycardia, hypotension, or both in 24 patients with recurrent syncope and in 18 control subjects. A conventional electrophysiologic test performed before the tilt test was positive in 9 of the 24 patients, revealing arrhythmias that may have caused recurrent syncope, but was negative and thus nondiagnostic in 15 patients. The tilt test alone (i.e., without isoproterenol) induced symptomatic bradycardia or hypotension in 1 of the 9 patients with positive electrophysiologic tests (11 percent), 4 of the 15 patients with negative electrophysiologic tests (27 percent), and none of the controls. When the isoproterenol infusion was administered during the tilt test, 9 of the 11 patients with negative electrophysiologic and tilt tests had syncope, marked slowing of the heart rate, and hypotension. In contrast, isoproterenol was associated with tachycardia and only a slight decline in arterial pressure in the 8 remaining patients with positive electrophysiologic tests and the 18 control subjects, and syncope developed in only 1 of the 8 patients with positive electrophysiologic tests and negative tilt tests (13 percent) and 2 of the 18 control subjects (11 percent). We conclude that an isoproterenol infusion administered in conjunction with the upright-tilt test may be useful for identifying susceptibility to neurally mediated recurrent syncope.\r"

The outpatients were evaluated medically and psychiatrically and then were prescribed decreasing doses of oxazepam on the basis of daily clinic visits. The inpatient program combined comprehensive psychiatric and medical evaluation, detoxification with oxazepam, and the initiation of rehabilitation treatment. The mean duration of treatment was significantly shorter for outpatients (6.5 days) than for inpatients (9.2 days). On the other hand, significantly more inpatients (95 percent) than outpatient (72 percent) completed detoxification. There were no serious medical complications in either group. Outcome evaluations completed at one and six months for 93 and 85 percent of the patients, respectively, showed substantial improvement in both groups at both follow-up periods. At one month there were fewer alcohol-related problems among inpatients and fewer medical problems among outpatients. However, no group differences were found at the six-month follow-up, nor were differences found in the subsequent use of other alcoholism-treatment services. Costs were substantially greater for inpatients ($3,319 to $3,665 per patient) than for outpatients ($175 to $388). We conclude that outpatient medical detoxification is an effective, safe, and low-cost treatment for patients with mid-to-moderate symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.\r"

Studies performed included an assessment of muscle strength by electronic myometer, muscle biopsy, echocardiography, and radionuclide cardiac scanning, with comparison to healthy control subjects of similar age. The patients' mean (+/- SEM) daily alcohol consumption was 243 +/- 13 g over an average of 16 years. These patients had no clinical or laboratory signs of malnutrition or electrolyte imbalance. Forty-two percent of the patients, as compared with none of the controls, had strength of less than 20 kg as measured in the deltoid muscle. Muscle-biopsy specimens from 23 patients (46 percent) had histologic evidence of myopathy. In the cardiac studies, when the alcoholic patients were compared with 20 healthy controls, the patients had a significantly lower mean ejection fraction (59 vs. 67 percent), a lower mean shortening fraction (33 vs. 38 percent), a greater mean end-diastolic diameter (51 vs. 49 mm), and a greater mean left ventricular mass (123 vs. 106 g per square meter of body-surface area). One third of the alcoholics had an ejection fraction of 55 percent or less, as compared with none of the controls. Endomyocardial biopsy specimens from six patients with ejection fractions below 50 percent showed histologic changes of cardiomyopathy. The estimated total lifetime dose of ethanol correlated inversely with muscular strength (r = -0.65; P less than 0.001). In an analysis that also included six patients with symptomatic alcoholic cardiomyopathy, the estimated total lifetime dose of ethanol correlated inversely with the ejection fraction (r = -0.58; P less than 0.001) and directly with the left ventricular mass (r = 0.59; P less than 0.001). We conclude that myopathy of skeletal muscle and cardiomyopathy are common among persons with chronic alcoholism and that alcohol is toxic to striated muscle in a dose-dependent manner.\r"

All had complete clearing of the stains after an average of 6.5 laser treatments to each lesional area; skin over bony prominences required approximately half as many sessions as skin on the cheek. Children less than seven years old required fewer sessions (mean +/- SD, 5.8 +/- 1.1) than older children (7.1 +/- 1.1; P less than 0.05). Treated skin was identical in texture and color to adjacent normal skin in 33 (94.3 percent) of the children, whereas 2 (5.7 percent) had small, isolated, depressed scars in areas accidentally traumatized soon after laser treatment. The only other side effect was transient hyperpigmentation, which occurred in 20 patients (57 percent). These results can be attributed to two distinguishing characteristics of the flashlamp-pulsed tunable dye laser: an emission wavelength of 577 nm, theoretically ideal for selective absorption by the intravascular target oxyhemoglobin, and a pulse duration of 360 microseconds, which closely matches the thermal relaxation time for dermal blood vessels and hence avoids diffuse nonspecific thermal necrosis with subsequent scarring of the treated skin.\r"

  ".W": "We applied a new technique of catheter ablation to treat atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia and preserve anterograde conduction, performing this procedure in 21 patients with repetitive episodes of tachycardia refractory to antiarrhythmic drugs. Using atrial activation in the His-bundle lead as a reference, we selected the optimal site of ablation by positioning an electrode catheter so that atrial activation occurred simultaneously with or earlier than the reference activation during tachycardia. At this site, the His-bundle deflection was completely absent or was present only at a low amplitude (less than 0.1 mV). In the majority of patients, these criteria could be met by withdrawing the catheter 5 to 10 mm from the site of the His-bundle recording (adjacent to the reference catheter). Shocks of 160 or 240 J were delivered at this site (cumulative energy [mean +/- SD], 689 +/- 442 J). Treatment resulted in preferential abolition or impairment of retrograde nodal conduction. Anterograde conduction, although modified, was preserved in 19 patients; complete heart block persisted in 2 patients. Sixteen patients remained free of arrhythmia, without medication or implantation of a pacemaker, for a mean follow-up period of 14 +/- 8 months (range, 7 to 42). Tachycardia was not inducible in 14 patients in a follow-up electrophysiologic study performed 3.6 +/- 6 months after the procedure. We conclude that catheter ablation is an effective alternative for the treatment of atrioventricular nodal tachycardia in patients with drug-resistant tachycardia.\r"

  ".W": "Requesting an autopsy is never a pleasant or comfortable experience, either for physician or for family members. Sometimes the family has had previous unhappy experiences with this procedure, and certainly many clinicians have been repelled by sights, sounds, and behaviors they have observed in morgues. Such experiences can have far-reaching negative effects and reflect poorly upon the profession of pathology. Berger's important paper contains important messages for pathologists concerned with the performance of pediatric autopsies and for clinicians requesting consent. His paper should be read and heeded by both groups. Several studies have looked at factors that might affect autopsy rates, especially in perinatal deaths. Early separation of mother from baby emerged as an important factor in one of these, whereas maternal age, race, and sociocultural background played no important role. One of these studies investigated attitudes and experiences of the requesting physicians, and found these factors to be key determinants in the family's response to a request to perform a postmortem examination. One result of that study was that more experienced physicians were more likely to request a postmortem examination, and to receive an affirmative answer. The pediatric postmortem examination remains an indispensable part of clinical management. Its importance for science, clinical practice, and medical administration is beyond question. However, its greatest and most unique value is to the families of the deceased children. Clinicians and pathologists must continue to work together to ensure that this procedure is performed whenever indicated, that the information gained is maximized, and that the results are communicated to the family promptly, accurately, clearly, and with sensitivity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Large molecule diseases are degenerative disorders due to storage of glycogen, glycoproteins, or mucopolysaccharides. Table 7 presents a compendium of laboratory investigations one should consider using when abnormalities are found in multiple organ systems. The investigation of a child with a mucopolysaccharidosis is used as an example of the use of this table. Investigating pediatricians should realize that many laboratory tests involved in the diagnosis of metabolic disease required special collection and handling by the laboratory.\r"

CSF culture results were positive for 20 patients and they were sterile at 18 to 36 hours after start of therapy for 281 patients. Seizures, subdural effusions, and hemiparesis were found significantly more often during hospitalization in those with delayed sterilization of CSF. Children with persistently positive cultures had a significantly higher incidence of neurologic abnormalities at the time of hospital discharge (45% v 19%) and at follow-up (41% v 13%) and of moderate to profound hearing impairment (35% v 15%) than did those with prompt sterilization of CSF. Repeat CSF examination is a useful prognostic indicator in infants and young children with bacterial meningitis.\r"

The neonatal mortality rate in the white infants increased from 3.99 in mothers residing in zip codes with a median family income greater than $25,000 to 12.1 for mothers residing in zip codes with a median family income less than $11,000. With decreasing socioeconomic status there was also a significant increase in the percentage of white infants weighing less than 2,500 g (percentage of low birth weight increased from 3.75 to 8.33) and weighing less than 1,500 g (percentage of very low birth weight increased from 0.56 to 1.46). When the source of the socioeconomic difference in white neonatal mortality was partitioned, 77.4% was due to deterioration in the birth weight distribution and 22.6% to deterioration in the birth weight-specific mortality rates. For the black cohort, the neonatal mortality rate increased from 5.9 in the most, to 9.0 in the least affluent strata. Although decreasing residential median family income was associated with an increase in the percent low birth weight (8.19 v 12.86), the percentage of very low birth weight was not significantly different (1.59 v 2.10). When the source of the differential in black neonatal mortality was partitioned, only 29% was due to deterioration of the birth weight distribution, whereas 71% was secondary to less favorable birth weight-specific mortality rates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Partial correlations indicated that intraventricular hemorrhage influences cognitive and motor development independently of the other predictor variables. Socioeconomic status predicted language ability and recovery of attention to a novel stimulus independent of the other predictors. Medical complications other than intraventricular hemorrhage also made an independent contribution to the variance in language outcome. Implications of these findings are discussed.\r"

Infections in individual patients ranged from one to greater than 50. The hospital-acquired urinary tract infection rate for the study period was 14.2 infections per 1,000 admissions. In the patients in whom all urinary tract infections were well documented, the following characteristics were defined: (1) 92% (97 of 105) of the infections occurred in catheterized patients; (2) almost half (49 of 105) of the infections occurred in patients exposed to only intermittent catheterization; (3) 28% (29 of 105) of the infections were asymptomatic; (4) fever was the most frequent finding in the symptomatic patients and occurred in 66% (60 of 105); (5) pyuria was found in only 51% (35 of 69) of the urinalyses performed at diagnosis; (6) 85% (89 of 105) of the infections were single-organism infections; (7) 82% (101 of 123) of the causative organisms were Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas sp, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus spp, Klebsiella spp, or Enterobacter sp. The urinary tract infections in the 60 patients were not complicated by bacteremia, and no direct relationship between the infections and the minimal mortality in our patients could be established.\r"

Multimodal management of all patients included diagnosis, demystification, medication, close follow-up with supportive counseling, and referral as indicated for psychosocial and educational assistance. Long-term follow-up of 12 children who continued to receive methylphenidate was done for an average of 16 months. Initial total self-esteem was low in 30% of all subjects, intermediate in 55%, and high in 15%. No statistically significant changes occurred in self-esteem during the short-term phase of the study despite clinically significant behavioral responses to medication as assessed by serial questionnaires. At long-term follow-up, total, general, and academic self-esteem scores were improved significantly, however. These findings indicate that many preadolescents with attention deficit disorder/hyperactivity exhibit low self-esteem. Despite clinical response to medication, short-term improvement in self-esteem may not occur; however, long-term, multimodal management that includes medication does appear to improve self-esteem.\r"

Opinions differ regarding whether expressive language delay is a disorder worthy of active intervention or an indication of normal variation in the onset of expressive language. The purpose of this research was to follow for 5 months 26 2-year-old children in whom expressive language disorder had been carefully diagnosed to discover the rate of improvement and its predictors. Improvement was variable, with approximately one third of the children showing no improvement, one third showing mild improvement, and one third in the normal range at posttest. Nearly two thirds of the variance in improvement could be accounted for by three child variables measured by the pretest: parentally reported vocabulary size, parentally reported problems with having regular meals, and observed frequency of quiet activity not requiring the parent's management. A screening procedure involving only one of those variables, reported vocabulary size, was 81% accurate in identifying children's improvement status. The implications of these results for the management of children with expressive language disorder are discussed.\r"

No statistically significant differences in sex distribution, racial (ethnic) background, family history, mode of onset, morbidity, or mortality rates were found between the two age groups. The frequently held view that children with early-onset lupus do worse probably relates to the fact that even though they survive as long as children with the older-onset disease, they die younger because they have the onset of their lupus at a younger age.\r"

The aim of this study was to evaluate, under controlled conditions, whether bovine whey proteins can elicit symptoms of infantile colic in colicky formula-fed infants. The mean age for entering the study was 6.4 weeks and the mean age for colic debut was 3.7 weeks. In 24 of 27 infants with severe colic, the symptoms disappeared when they were given a cow's milk-free diet (Nutramigen). These 24 infants were entered into a double-blind crossover study. The infants (receiving cow's milk-free diet) were given the contents of identical capsules with each meal during day 6. The same procedure was repeated on day 10. The capsules contained either whey protein powder (with Nutramigen added) or human albumin powder (with Nutramigen added). Eighteen infants receiving the whey protein-containing capsules reacted with colic, two infants receiving placebo reacted with colic (P less than .001), and four infants did not react at all. Crying hours per day for the 24 infants were 5.6 hours for formula-fed infants and 0.7 hour for cow's milk-free diet-fed infants (P less than .001). Crying hours per day were 3.2 hours for the infants receiving whey protein capsules and 1.0 hour for those receiving placebo (P less than .001). In conclusion, bovine whey protein can elicit symptoms of infantile colic in colicky formula-fed infants.\r"

Rates were three times higher among boys than girls. The occurrence of two harvest-related peaks and the absence of fatality in children less than 1 year of age suggest that presence of children on the farm when supervision is diminished is a key factor in farm-related fatalities. Moving machinery (tractors, wagons, and trucks) was the source of injury in approximately 55% of all deaths. Drowning accounted for 15% of all farm-related deaths. Two fatalities related to gravity box wagons could have easily been prevented with simple safety devices. These findings suggest a need for developing environmental interventions in farms. This will require the allocation of more resources to farm safety programs and a revision of current farm safety legislation.\r"

The psychologic morbidity of Munchausen syndrome by proxy in six children is described. The children reacted with developmentally appropriate behavior problems ranging from feeding disorders in infants, withdrawal and hyperactivity in preschool-aged children, to hysterical disorders and personal adoption of Munchausen syndrome behavior in adolescents. Parental psychologic and behavioral styles, family dynamics, and responses from legal and children's protective services systems make protection of the child within the home difficult, if not impossible. Even with protection from further physical injury, severe psychologic trauma remains likely. Extreme caution is suggested in allowing these children to remain in the family.\r"

Post hoc analysis showed significant differences (p less than .02) between the involved shoulders and all uninvolved shoulders. No significant difference was found among the uninvolved shoulders. The results of this study indicate that kinesthetic deficits occur after glenohumeral dislocation and may result in abnormal neuromuscular coordination and subsequent reinjury of the shoulder. Clinicians should consider rehabilitation of shoulder kinesthesia using therapeutic activation of the shoulder joint and muscle receptors when treating patients with previous dislocations.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of ultrasound on the percutaneous absorption of benzydamine hydrochloride from a gel base was investigated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study of 10 healthy volunteers. Using two similar experimental protocols, the effect of both 1:1 (2 msec on, 2 msec off) pulsed-output ultrasound (3.0 MHz at 1.0 W/cm2 and 0.0 W/cm2 [control]) and continuous-output ultrasound at a range of frequencies (0.75, 1.5, and 3.0 MHz at 1.5 W/cm2) were investigated. A placebo control (benzydamine gel massaged with ultrasound applicator switched off) was incorporated into each protocol. Percutaneous absorption of benzydamine was assessed by measurement of the residual amount of drug in the formulation base after treatment. Drug assay was by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and ultraviolet detection. Statistical analysis of the results for both continuous and pulsed ultrasound treatment showed that no significant differences existed between data for ultrasound treatment versus no ultrasound. In conclusion, although phonophoresis has been alleged to enhance percutaneous absorption of numerous drugs, ultrasound did not enhance the percutaneous absorption of benzydamine under the experimental conditions of this study.\r"

The nondominant upper limbs in six subjects (two female, four male) were immobilized in a plaster cast for 14 days. Testing consisted of isometric muscle strength output of elbow flexors and extensors; movement time; and IEMG output of the agonist, antagonist, and second agonist contractions during the ballistic movements. An analysis of variance revealed a decrease in flexor strength of the casted limb (p less than .05). Movement time was not significantly slowed. Antagonist IEMG amplitude was decreased (p less than .01) during flexion, and agonist IEMG amplitude (p less than .05) and antagonist IEMG amplitude (p less than .05) were diminished during extension of the casted limb. In conclusion, short-term upper limb immobilization affects primarily elbow flexion strength and some IEMG characteristics during a ballistic forearm movement, suggesting an influence on the neuromuscular aspects of the affected muscles.\r"

Sixteen children with CP (2-10 years old) performed six gait trials, three with the handle on the rolling walker positioned horizontally and three with the handle positioned vertically. Using the footprint-on-paper method, gait characteristics of right and left step width, step length, and stride length; cadence; and velocity were determined. A two-way analysis of variance for two repeated measures indicated no significant differences in the measured gait characteristics between handle positions. Significant differences between the first trial and subsequent trials for both horizontal and vertical handle positions were found using Duncan's multiple comparison test. This study suggests that in this sample of children, altering the handle position did not lead to any immediate statistically significant changes in the gait characteristics measured. Results suggest that walkers with vertical handles should not be prescribed under the assumption that the gait characteristics of the child using the walker will be changed. This study does not rule out other changes that might occur with the use of vertical-handled walkers.\r"

Thirty-one patients who had experienced a cerebrovascular accident a mean of 44 days before testing participated in the study. Static elbow flexion force was tested with a hand-held dynamometer, twice with the HN rotated toward the paretic side and twice with the HN rotated toward the nonparetic side. Elbow flexion force did not differ with the HN in the two positions (F = 0.008, p = 931). Results of this study support the conclusion that HN position in the transverse plane does not influence the production of static elbow flexion force on the paretic side in patients with stroke. Clinicians, therefore, may wish to reexamine any emphasis they place on HN position for facilitating elbow flexion force production on the paretic side of patients with hemiparesis.\r"

Using a dynamometer, we collected isokinetic measurements during trunk flexion and extension at speeds of 60 degrees and 120 degrees/sec on 61 healthy subjects (29 men, 32 women; 20-60 years old) while standing. Extension and flexion peak torque measurements were calculated for each subject at each speed. Male and female subjects' data were analyzed separately. Each subject's body weight was paired with peak torque at each speed, and Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients (r) were calculated. The correlation coefficients ranged from .27 to .39 for extension and from .66 to .70 for flexion, establishing a positive linear relationship between body weight and each of the isokinetic measurements. Body weight accounted for very small proportions of the variance (as low as 7%-15% in extension isokinetic measurements). In attempting to use a client's body weight to predict isokinetic peak torque measurements, the clinician should be aware that a great deal of unaccounted for variance exists. We recommend that clinicians use other variables (eg, activity level, age) in addition to body weight to control for individual differences among healthy subjects when measuring isokinetic trunk extension muscle performance.\r"

Young men were recruited to match the elderly men on the basis of right-leg length. Each subject participated in three filmed trials of free-speed ambulation down a 14-m walkway. The processed film was analyzed for eight gait characteristics. Differences in characteristics between the two groups were examined using a correlated t test (p less than .01). No significant differences were observed between the groups for step and stride length, velocity, ankle range of motion, vertical and horizontal excursions of the center of gravity, and pelvic obliquity; however, the younger men demonstrated a significantly larger stride width than the elderly men (p less than .01). The results suggest that the two populations of healthy adult men have similar gait characteristics.\r"

Nine subjects with a forefoot varus and nine subjects with a forefoot valgus walked across a force platform three times for each of the following five treatment conditions: 1) barefoot, 2) shoes only, 3) rigid orthoses with shoes, 4) semi-rigid orthoses with shoes, and 5) soft orthoses with shoes. Force data were analyzed to determine the area under the center-of-pressure curve. A significant omnibus F ratio was obtained for treatments (p less than .001) and the deformity X treatments interaction (p less than .05) using a two-factor, mixed analysis of variance for repeated measures. Tukey's post hoc comparisons for the Varus Group resulted in significant differences (p less than .05) between the following treatment conditions: 1) barefoot and shoes only, 2) barefoot and rigid orthoses with shoes, 3) barefoot and semi-rigid orthoses with shoes, and 4) barefoot and soft orthoses with shoes. Tukey's post hoc comparisons for the Valgus Group resulted in significant differences (p less than .05) between the following treatment conditions: 1) barefoot and rigid orthoses with shoes, 2) barefoot and semi-rigid orthoses with shoes, and 3) barefoot and soft orthoses with shoes. The shoes-only treatment condition, in comparison with the barefoot condition, significantly reduced the center-of-pressure area for the Varus Group only.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The evolution of the PKC system from its origins in the problem-oriented system of medical care is described, and the philosophy of problem-knowledge coupling is contrasted to the basic philosophy of traditional clinical medical practice and never computerized expert decision-support systems. We suggest that problem-knowledge coupling could be a useful tool in physical therapy because it improves the collection and synthesis of patient information and uses the unique nature of individual patient problems coupled with the clinical literature as the bases for clinical practice decisions.\r"

Two physical therapists (Tester 1 and Tester 2) took measurements on 40 subjects without low back pain (LBP) and on 40 subjects with LBP. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to determine the degree of agreement between repeated measurements taken by the same therapist and between measurements taken by the two therapists. The ICC values for intratester reliability of Tester 1 were .84 for subjects without LBP and .94 for subjects with LBP. The ICC values of Tester 2 were .73 for subjects without LBP and .83 for subjects with LBP. Intertester reliability generally was poor, with ICC values of .41 for subjects without LBP and .50 for subjects with LBP. The results suggest that measurements of lumbar lordosis with a flexible rule may be reliable if taken by the same physical therapist. The degree of reliability, however, may vary from therapist to therapist. The intertester reliability of these measurements appears to be poor, but these conclusions must be interpreted carefully because of the limited number of therapists participating in this study.\r"

Ninety-three percent of the patients were found to be clinically improved, and 91% of patients were judged solidly fused on evaluation of motion radiographs. Compared with our previously reported results for lumbar fusion without internal fixation, supplementation of lumbar fusion by translaminar facet screw fixation significantly improved the clinical results, as well as the time required for fusion, with no significant increased risk.\r"

Single-cut CT scans performed at the time of isokinetic trunk strength assessment demonstrated psoas and erector spinae atrophy through a significant decrease in muscle density, with only a trend towards decreased cross-sectional area. Findings also indicated that there was a significant correlation between increased mechanical trunk strength performance and greater muscle density on CT scan. Strength was significantly lower for the male patients undergoing spinal fusion compared with those undergoing disc excision. However, no significant difference was found in strength measures between: males with high versus low pain level and working versus nonworking males at the time of evaluation.\r"

  ".W": "Spinal cord concussion is a transient disturbance of spinal cord function, with or without vertebral damage and no demonstrable pathologic changes, that results from a rapid change in velocity following trauma, and resolves within 48 hours. In a retrospective review of patients with spinal injury referred to a tertiary care center, spinal cord concussion was observed in 3.7% of patients. Thirteen cases are presented. A variety of clinical presentations may occur, all of which can be explained on the basis of the magnitude or direction of acceleration of the spinal cord. The cervical cord is most commonly affected, but concussion can occur at any level of the spinal cord. Spinal cord concussion is often associated with pre-existing vertebral abnormalities that result in narrowing of the spinal canal or areas of hypermobility.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty consecutive patients underwent standardized surgical treatment for isthmic lumbosacral spondylolisthesis. Twenty-two (44%) had mechanical symptoms only and were treated with in situ fusion. Twenty-eight (56%) had back and radicular symptoms and underwent decompression and fusion. Follow-up averaged 40.4 months. Satisfactory results were achieved in 30 (60%). Patients under 30 and over 50 appeared to do better. Success rate was not related to degree of slippage. Success rate in compensation cases was 39%, versus 83% in non-compensation cases (P less than 0.001); males, 53%, versus females, 78% (0.05 less than P less than 0.1); back pain only, 73%, versus radiculopathy, 50% (0.05 less than P less than 0.1); smokers, 48%, versus nonsmokers, 74% (0.05 less than P less than 0.1). Pseudoarthrosis rate was 12%, and this correlated with failure (P less than 0.002). Thus, a trend towards an unsatisfactory outcome was seen in males, middle-aged individuals, those with a smoking habit, and patients with radicular symptoms. A compensable work situation and pseudoarthrosis had a profoundly negative influence on outcome.\r"
