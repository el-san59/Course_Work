  ".W": "We have observed many focal dilatations or very small aneurysms in terminal arterioles and capillaries of 4 of 5 patients and 6 dogs who had recently undergone cardiopulmonary bypass. A smaller number of sausagelike dilatations distended medium-sized arterioles. Two other patients had a small number of the same microvascular changes following proximal aortography. Thirty-four patients and 6 dogs not undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass had none. (A 35th patient who had not undergone cardiopulmonary bypass or aortography showed a small number of dilatations; mediastinal air was a suggested source.) Some of the dilatations exhibited various forms of birefringence. Because most of the dilatations appear empty, we speculate that they are the sites of gas bubbles or fat emboli that have been removed by the solvents used in processing. These microvascular events, occurring only in conjunction with major arterial interventions, may be the anatomical correlate of the neurological deficits or moderate to severe intellectual dysfunction seen in at least 24% of patients after cardiac surgical procedures assisted by cardiopulmonary bypass.\r"

  ".W": "The number of motor units in the thenar muscle group was calculated by dividing the surface electromyogram and twitch force, in maximal stimulation of the median nerve, by estimates of the average electromyogram and twitch force from single units. The following three techniques were used to estimate the average electromyogram from single units: spike-triggered averaging from units recorded with a needle electrode, intramuscular microstimulation of motor nerve branches, and graded whole nerve stimulation at the wrist. The first two techniques also provided independent estimates of motor unit numbers based on the average force generated by single units. The five estimates (three based on the electromyogram and two on force) ranged from 116 to 170 motor units in the thenar group. Correcting for cancellation when unit responses sum to form the compound action potential or twitch increased the estimated number of units, which ranged from 130 to 179. The estimates were not statistically different from one another but were substantially lower than some previous electrophysiological estimates based on graded whole nerve stimulation. The recruitment pattern of single units during whole nerve stimulation was recorded and simulated mathematically. The most likely reason for the higher estimates in previous studies using graded whole nerve stimulation is shown to be alternation of motor units. Potential errors in all the techniques are discussed and compared.\r"

  ".W": "The number of motor units in the thenar muscle group was estimated in 11 patients with cervical spinal cord injuries. The surface electromyogram and twitch force, in response to maximal stimulation of the median nerve was divided by the average surface electromyogram and twitch of single units. The average single unit size was obtained by intramuscular microstimulation of motor nerve branches and by graded whole nerve stimulation, which provided three independent estimates, two based on the electromyogram and one based on force. The motor unit estimates from the patients covered a wide range. Some had essentially normal motor units both in numbers and contractile properties, while others had varying reductions in numbers of units. Those patients who showed a large reduction in motor unit numbers also had greatly enlarged units, which produced an average of up to sixfold the normal force. These enlarged units summed to produce maximal compound action potentials and twitches that were sometimes indistinguishable from normal. Magnetic resonance imaging scans of the cervical spine obtained from some patients provided independent evidence that patients with low motor unit counts had sustained direct injury to the anterior aspect of the spinal cord at the relevant segmental levels. Some patients showed a normal number of motor units long after the injury. No evidence of transneuronal degeneration could be demonstrated in the thenar group in these patients with the current techniques.\r"

Most specimens were from the least abnormal area of the resection. Stable intracellular recordings could be obtained for up to 8 hours. Most of the recorded neurons had electrophysiological characteristics similar to those of regular-firing pyramidal cells and were in layers III to V, which was confirmed by intracellular staining with Lucifer yellow. Local extracellular stimulation evoked a sequence of excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. After application of the gamma-aminobutyric acid antagonist, bicuculline (10-30 microM), extracellular stimulation induced large excitatory postsynaptic potentials and epileptiform bursts. Spontaneous bursts occasionally occurred in bicuculline. This effect of bicuculline was observed in all the tissue samples, even those from infant patients (n = 4, age 8-16 months). Kynurenic acid depressed or abolished both spontaneous and stimulation-induced bursts. The competitive antagonist for N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, DL-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid decreased the duration of bicuculline-induced bursts. These data provide evidence that, similar to rat and cat neocortex, excitatory and inhibitory amino acids are important transmitters to pyramidal cells in immature human neocortex.\r"

Two physicians, who were unaware of the treatment order, used an objective rating scale and independently assessed the patients; interobserver correlation was excellent (r = 0.93-0.81). We found that botulinum toxin produced a significant reduction in spasticity (p = 0.009) and a significant improvement in the ease of nursing care (p = 0.009). There were no adverse effects during this short-term trial. This is the first demonstration of the beneficial effect of botulinum toxin on focal spastic muscle contractions.\r"

In this study, we used in vivo microdialysis to determine if insulin-induced hypoglycemia altered striatal amino acid efflux in similar fashion in the immature brain. Microdialysis probes were inserted into the right striatum of rats on postnatal day 7. After a 2-hour recovery period, in each animal a 30-minute baseline sample was obtained. Then insulin (0.6 mu/kg, intraperitoneal injection) was administered (n = 6) and dialysate sampling was continued over the next 210 minutes (terminal blood glucose level less than 5 mg/dl). Untreated control rats (n = 6) were sampled over the same time interval. After pre-column derivatization with o-phthaldialdehyde, dialysate samples were assayed by high-pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection to measure their amino acid content; eight amino acids (glutamate, aspartate, taurine, glutamine, alanine, serine, glycine, and asparagine) were consistently detected. In controls, amino acid efflux did not change over 4 hours. In hypoglycemic animals, glutamate efflux increased (peak: 238 +/- 85% of baseline, p = 0.02, repeated measures analysis of variance [ANOVA]), glutamine efflux declined (to 44 +/- 5% of baseline, p = 0.002, ANOVA), and taurine efflux increased (up to 310 +/- 120% of baseline; p less than 0.06, ANOVA). In contrast with 9- to 12-fold increases in aspartate efflux reported in adult striatum, aspartate efflux increased only slightly (to 174 +/- 69% of baseline; not significant).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We evaluated 3 patients with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome who presented with subacute progressive neuropathies. The neuropathies were predominantly motor and maximal in the lower extremities. Two patients were confined to a wheelchair and one was ventilator-dependent and bedridden. Sensory loss predominantly involved small fiber modalities. Electrophysiological studies showed multifocal marked conduction slowing and conduction block indicating segmental demyelination, with associated axonal degeneration that was accentuated distally. Examination of sural nerve biopsy specimens demonstrated axonal degeneration in all 3 patients and perivascular infiltrates in 2. Levels of quinolinic acid, a neurotoxic metabolite of L-tryptophan, were elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid in the 2 patients in whom it was measured. The cause of the neuropathy is unknown but may include immune mechanisms or toxicity of eosinophils, L-tryptophan, its metabolic products, or contaminants within L-tryptophan preparations.\r"

On the basis of these findings, it is proposed that NMDA antagonists may be beneficial as adjunctive treatment in the therapy of Parkinson's disease. CPP locally injected into the subthalamic nucleus, entopeduncular nucleus--the rat homologue of the internal pallidal segment--or substantia nigra pars reticulata of monoamine-depleted rats stimulates locomotor activity and alleviates rigidity, whereas local microinjection of CPP into the neostriatum is ineffective. These results make it unlikely that the neostriatum is the site of the antiparkinsonian action of NMDA antagonists in monoamine-depleted rats, whereas the subthalamic nucleus, internal pallidal segment, and substantia nigra pars reticulata appear to be important for the effects of NMDA antagonists.\r"

The highest CSF neopterin concentrations occurred in those with neurological opportunistic infections, primary central nervous systems lymphoma, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) dementia complex. In general, the CSF concentration of neopterin was independent of CSF cell count and blood-brain barrier disruption to albumin. In the patients with AIDS dementia complex, CSF neopterin concentrations correlated with severity of disease and decreased in conjunction with clinical improvement following treatment with zidovudine. These results suggest that CSF neopterin, although not disease-specific, may be useful as a surrogate marker for the presence of AIDS dementia complex and its response to antiviral therapy.\r"

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of alpha 1-antichymotrypsin were also measured in 15 patients with Alzheimer-type dementia, 26 control subjects, 6 with vascular dementia, 7 with cerebrovascular disorder, and 11 with degenerative disorders. In control subjects, there were no age-related changes or sex differences. Serum and CSF levels were significantly and specifically higher in patients with Alzheimer-type dementia than in other subjects (serum, p less than 0.001; CSF, p less than 0.05). Serum levels of alpha 1-antichymotrypsin were significantly elevated in the early stage of Alzheimer-type dementia, whereas there was no definite correlation between serum levels and the degree of dementia. CSF levels of alpha 1-antichymotrypsin tended to parallel the severity of dementia. Serum levels were not correlated with CSF levels. These data indicate that serum and CSF levels of alpha 1-antichymotrypsin might be independently upregulated in Alzheimer-type dementia. We concluded that the measurement of serum levels of alpha 1-antichymotrypsin could be useful as a screening marker for Alzheimer-type dementia. In addition, CSF levels also could be a useful marker for Alzheimer-type dementia, because they might reflect the state of dementia.\r"

All 7 cats were subjected to repeated 6-hour sleep monitoring for observation of interictal discharges, which were observed most often in the immediate postictal period. Their frequency decreased gradually throughout the experiment in both the medicated and control animals, but they never completely disappeared except from the contralateral amygdala in 1 medicated animal. Upon primary site restimulation, all of the medicated animals responded with a generalized convulsion once the afterdischarge was induced. When these animals underwent secondary-site amygdaloid kindling, 3 showed a positive transfer effect. The findings suggest that although phenobarbital is a potent anticonvulsant, it has little effect on the acquired seizure susceptibility of previously amygdaloid kindled cats.\r"

In the search for a symptomatic treatment of multiple sclerosis, digoxin (0.02 mg per kilogram of body weight) was given intravenously to 7 patients with probable or clinically definite multiple sclerosis. All of these patients had temperature-dependent symptoms. In 3 patients, improvement of clinical deficits was observed concurrent with significant changes in evoked potential findings. Digitalis derivatives may be useful in ameliorating symptoms in selected patients with multiple sclerosis.\r"

To understand this phenomenon better the College of American Pathologists, Northfield, III, and the Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, Ga, have conducted a collaborative study with 44 laboratories where 16 instruments manufactured by nine companies are evaluated. The purposes were to assess measurement variation on several reference materials used for standardizing total cholesterol measurements and to evaluate a new stabilized liquid serum as a potential reference material. Lypophilized, frozen, fresh-frozen, and stabilized materials at three concentrations were measured for total cholesterol. The results show that the average coefficient of variation of measured total cholesterol for all instruments, laboratories, vials, and replicates is 3.6% to 4.1% for each of the materials measured (excluding the results for one instrument). For one instrument, however, significant bias was found on the stabilized liquid serum material. Results from the fresh-frozen materials indicate that the instrument systems evaluated allow laboratories to attain the National Cholesterol Education Program analytical performance goals.\r"

An increased incidence of coronary platelet-fibrin thrombi was noted when compared with a non-PTCA cardiac autopsy population (five of 53 patients). Apparently there was an increased incidence of coronary atheroemboli and thromboemboli in the patients with coronary platelet-fibrin thrombi (eight patients) when compared with patients who did not have platelet-fibrin thrombi (five patients), although this was not statistically significant. There was no evidence of a systemic hypercoagulable state or of disseminated intravascular coagulation. The pathogenesis of this is unclear; however, vasospasm and a disruption of the endothelial surface induced by PTCA with subsequent platelet activation are possible causes. Although not statistically significant, there was a proponderance of female subjects (seven patients) and an increased incidence of diabetes mellitus (six patients) and hypertension (13 patients) when compared with a control population of all patients undergoing PTCA at The Cleveland (Ohio) Clinic Foundation in 1987, suggesting that diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and female sex may be clinical risk factors for fatal complications following PTCA.\r"

Infarct area for each slice was determined as follows: (1) grossly, by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining of each slice, and (2) microscopically, by complete histologic sectioning of the triphenyl tetrazolium chloride-stained surface of each slice. Planimetry of necrotic and nonnecrotic areas was performed from tracings and photographs of triphenyl tetrazolium chloride-stained slices and from actual histologic sections. When triphenyl tetrazolium chloride and histologic measurements were compared, necrotic tissue area had decreased 11.4% +/- 15.0% (2.59 +/- 1.04 vs 2.09 +/- 0.86 cm2). Nonnecrotic tissue area decreased 20.6% +/- 24.0% (8.31 +/- 3.79 vs 5.16 +/- 2.73 cm2). In this model of ischemia followed by reperfusion, with fixation and processing, viable tissue shrank almost twice as much as necrotic tissue. This differential shrinkage introduces an error resulting in overestimation of infarct size by histologic quantitation.\r"

This study, which describes a population of 66 patients with Barrett's esophagus spanning 1 to 80 years of age, analyzes the cellular constituents of their lesional tissues by endoscopic biopsy and histochemical and morphometric studies. Goblet cell metaplasia, identified in 50% (n = 14) of pediatric patients, increased significantly to involve 84% (n = 32) of biopsy specimens from adult patients with Barrett's esophagus. This increase was exponential by linear regression analysis (R2 = .64) between the ages of 5 and 29 years. Pediatric patients usually had 25 or less goblet cells per square millimeter of Barrett mucosa with no identifiable epithelial dysplasia or cancer; Nissen fundoplication lessened esophageal inflammation, but the Barrett mucosa persisted. Goblet cell metaplasia maintained a plateau (mean of 57 cells per square millimeter of Barrett mucosa) between the ages of 41 and 80 years. Dysplasia, in situ carcinoma, or invasive carcinoma was found in patients with Barrett's esophagus who were aged 41 years or older. This study demonstrates persistence of Barrett mucosa, increased incidence of goblet cell metaplasia, and predictable changes in goblet cell number with advancing patient age. The relationship between Barrett mucosa and malignant neoplasm remains uncertain, but the goblet cell may serve as a marker of disease chronicity in which setting neoplasia evolves.\r"

Twenty-seven percent of the patients had marrow reticulin grade 0 using the Bauermeister scale, 42% had grade N, 27% had grade 1, and 4% had grade 2; no patient had a Bauermeister grade 3 or 4 reticulin level.

Histologic evaluation of the lymph node biopsy specimen demonstrated near-total effacement of the nodal architecture by a population of pleomorphic immunoblasts. The predominant cell population expressed CD3, CD2, CD5, and CD4, while results of testing for CD8 were negative. On the basis of the morphologic and immunohistologic features, a diagnosis of high-grade, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, T-cell immunoblastic type, was made. Despite the fact that aggressive behavior is usually associated with immunoblastic lymphomas, the patient has done well for 33 months after cessation of carbamazepine in the absence of chemotherapeutic treatment. The clinical features of this patient's illness, therefore, suggest that it is best regarded as a so-called pseudolymphoma.\r"

The mean full-peak (G0/G1) control cell DNA histogram coefficient of variation was 5.5%. DNA aneuploidy was more common in intraductal carcinomas compared with atypical hyperplasias (71% of intraductal carcinomas vs 36% of atypical hyperplasias) and correlated with a lack of cytologic (nuclear) and architectural differentiation (63% moderate vs 93% poor and 38% cribriform vs 82% solid). In addition, multiple DNA stemlines were observed in 40% of intraductal carcinomas. We conclude that (1) some atypical hyperplasias demonstrate abnormal DNA content consistent with neoplastic transformation, (2) aggressive forms of intraductal carcinoma are more frequently associated with DNA content abnormalities, and (3) frequent DNA stemline heterogeneity in intraductal carcinoma supports the hypothesis that multiple genetic events occur in the development of mammary intraepithelial neoplasia.\r"

The lymphomas are usually of a high grade and of B-cell phenotype. While the frequent presence of reactive monocytoid B lymphocytes in patients with AIDS-related lymphadenopathy has recently been documented in several studies, to our knowledge, there are no reported cases of monocytoid B-cell lymphoma, the neoplastic counterpart of monocytoid B lymphocytes, in patients with AIDS. We now describe a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patient with HIV-related lymphadenopathy in whom monocytoid B-cell lymphoma developed during the course of his disease. The morphologic and immunologic features of the lymphoma were characteristic of monocytoid B-cell lymphoma, and the involved lymph node exhibited a reversed CD4/CD8 ratio. Moreover, using the polymerase chain reaction, we were able to demonstrate HIV genome in DNA extracted from the lymph node tissue. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a case of monocytoid B-cell lymphoma occurring in an HIV-positive patient and in which we were able, by using a sensitive molecular biologic technique, to demonstrate HIV sequence in paraffin-embedded, fixed lymph node sections.\r"

Three of these four patients have returned to work. The fatal adrenal group only showed amelioration of rigidity and bradykinesia. Though these patients are now able to perform their basic daily living activities, and one of them has renewed her household tasks, the other two have not yet been able to return to work. The differences observed between the ventral mesencephalon- and the fetal adrenal-transplanted patients may be related to the heterogeneity of their disease and/or the type of graft implanted. However encouraging our results may be, this experimental procedure obviously requires further studies, and should not be practiced outside of highly qualified clinical research centers.\r"

We performed semiquantitative analysis of lymphocyte phenotype, using antisera to CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD22 molecules, in 11 separate perivascular cuffs in three tissue sections from the lesion edge. Total cells in the cuffs varied from 10 to 100; ratios of CD4+/CD8+ cells in individual cuffs varied from 1.3 to 4.7. Although intense parenchymal infiltrates bordered the least cellular cuffs, parenchymal and perivascular cell phenotypes were indistinguishable, arguing against selective trafficking of lymphocytes into tissue. Individual microfoci of cells displaying CD45RA, CD25, and TQ1 antigens were present. The remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity of T lymphocytes in the multiple sclerosis lesion border is consistent with exposure in situ to a diversity of differentiating stimuli. Histologic demyelination correlated very closely with the signal-intensity abnormality observed on magnetic resonance imaging. These studies provide unusual insight into the histologic and immunocytochemical morphologic appearance of the active multiple sclerosis plaque.\r"

Exclusionary criteria for all groups included cerebrovascular risk factors. All subjects had Hachinski Ischemic Index scores of less than 2 and computed tomographic scans showing no infarct. The WMHIs were classified as periventricular WMHIs or deep WMHIs and graded 0 through 3 (0 indicated absent, and 3, severe). For the group with DAT and older control subjects, periventricular WMHIs and deep WMHIs were graded 2 or 3 in fewer than 17% and 27% of subjects, respectively, whereas in the younger control subjects, all ratings were grade 1 or less. Serum cholesterol and systolic blood pressure values, although within the normal range, were elevated significantly in older control subjects when compared with those in younger control subjects. No significant differences in WMHI ratings, blood pressure, cholesterol, or triglyceride levels were found between patients with DAT and age-matched control subjects. Systolic blood pressure levels correlated with the severity of periventricular WMHIs only in older control subjects. Age correlated with periventricular WMHIs and deep WMHIs within both the older control subjects and the patients with DAT. There was no significant correlation between WMHIs and the severity of dementia in the group with DAT. These results suggest that, in subjects screened for cerebrovascular risk factors, WMHIs are rare and occur with identical frequency in patients with DAT as in age-matched healthy control subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In March 1986, we began a 6-month short course trial of therapy for tuberculous meningitis, in which 28 patients were analyzed. The diagnosis was based on the following cerebrospinal fluid test results: in 53.5% of the cases, Mycobacterium tuberculosis was identified by direct smear; in 57%, culture in Lowenstein-Jensen medium was positive; in 83.3%, the detection of anti-bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was positive; and in 74%, the dosification of adenosine deaminase activity was positive. In addition, in 21.4% of the cases, the diagnosis was established by means of autopsy findings. Moreover, the diagnosis was supported by bacteriological analyses from another tissue or body fluids. Despite the administration of an antituberculous therapy, 32.4% of the patients died: all of the decreased had reached the last stage of the disease by the beginning of treatment. Sixteen percent of the patients who survived after more than 18 months of follow-up after therapy had ended suffered neurological sequelae. With the 6-month therapeutic regimen, the morbidity/mortality is similar to that found in the longer-course therapies. The latter regimen is therefore thought to be a good and acceptable therapeutic option for the treatment of tuberculous meningitis.\r"

To test the hypothesis that these extrapyramidal signs are similar clinically and neurochemically to the extrapyramidal signs of Parkinson's disease, a group of 20 patients satisfying clinical criteria for probable Alzheimer's disease were studied and assessed clinically for the presence of rigidity, tremor, and bradykinesia. In those patients with extrapyramidal signs, qualitative differences were observed between the signs in these patients and in subjects with Parkinson's disease. Fifteen of 20 patients underwent fluoro-18-dopa scans, which showed no significant difference in fluoro-18-dopa uptake into the caudate and putamen between normal subjects and the rigid and nonrigid patients with Alzheimer's disease, in contrast to the marked reduction in fluoro-18-dopa uptake into the putamen that is observed in Parkinson's disease. This provides clinical and in vivo neurochemical support for the hypothesis that extranigral factors may be involved in the pathogenesis of rigidity in Alzheimer's disease.\r"

Comportment and most activities of daily living were preserved even when speech was unintelligible. Although several aphasia types may be associated with primary progressive aphasia, a nonfluent aphasia profile and phonemic paraphasic errors are most useful in differentiating it from the much more common clinical syndrome, \"probable Alzheimer's disease.\" The clinicopathological correlates of probable Alzheimer's disease differ from those associated with primary progressive aphasia.

Preshunt cognitive testing demonstrated progressive deterioration during 2 years, and positron emission tomography showed significant reductions in regional cerebral glucose utilization of 34% to 49% as compared with age- and sex-matched control subjects in frontal, temporal, parietal, and whole brain regions. Periodic testing, carried out during a 2-year period after shunt surgery, showed steady improvement in clinical status. Parallel to the clinical changes, there was a significant reversal in neuropsychologic test scores with increased brain volume and increased regional cerebral glucose utilization in several brain regions. These results documented the considerable potential for recovery of compromised brain function in older subjects even after 4 years of progressive brain disease.\r"

None of these patients demonstrated signs of dementia or severe neurological dysfunction. Pathological patterns of hexamethyl-propyleneamine oxime uptake were seen in 14 patients, seven of whom had normal results during neurological examination. Only four patients had signs of cerebral atrophy on cranial computed tomographic scan. These data suggest that subtle changes in cerebral perfusion seem to arise early in the course of human immunodeficiency virus infection and may indicate human immunodeficiency virus encephalopathy before neurological symptoms or noticeable structural damage occurs.\r"

Targets preceded by cues on the same side were termed validly cued; and those on the opposite side, invalidly cued. For all subjects, validly cued targets were responded to faster than those that were invalidly cued. The difference between reaction times for invalidly and validly cued targets, which is hypothesized to measure attentional movement, was significantly increased for the patients. The performance of the controls on certain neuropsychological tests was correlated with their attentional ability. These correlations were altered by progressive supranuclear palsy. Physostigmine treatment of the patients induced a speeding of responses to invalidly cued targets as a function of the duration of the disease. These studies show defects in cognition and attention in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy and demonstrate that physostigmine reduces some of the abnormal visual attentional performance.\r"

The advisory panel's recommendations will shape the MCAT to be introduced in 1991. Presented here are data the panel used in deciding to keep the score scale for the upcoming MCAT. Survey data on student selection practices in U.S. and Canadian medical schools and acceptance information for 1987 applicants showed that medical schools used the scores differently within each school and between the schools in deciding whom to admit. The data demonstrated the value of the current reporting system and led the advisory panel to recommend retention of the 15-point MCAT score scale in 1991.\r"

The review was conducted also because of concern expressed by some that NBME examination scores are misused in medical schools and in resident selection. In this paper, selected aspects of score reporting are defined, the uses of score reports outlined, and the potential for misuse described. It should be noted that the NBME is obliged to make available numerical scores to state medical boards and to examinees. Individual scores are reported to others only with the permission of the examinee. The results of an opinion poll conducted by the NBME of medical educators and medical students are presented. The range of opinion is broad but favors numerical score reporting and a designated pass/fail score.\r"

These needs will not be met unless there is an adequate supply of physicians receptive to and appropriately trained for the challenges and opportunities of practice in a rural community. A declining interest by matriculating and graduating medical students in primary care practice makes it problematic that the needs of rural America can be met in the near future unless medical schools attempt to reverse the trends in medical students' specialty choices. In October 1989, the University of Washington School of Medicine conducted a working conference on physician manpower issues facing rural communities in Washington, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho. The discussions and conclusions of this conference about increasing the percentage of graduates entering rural practice apply to other regions of the country, and this paper summarizes the conference's recommendations.\r"

In 1988 the author mailed a questionnaire to 256 program directors of residencies in the major nonpsychiatry specialties. A total of 236 (92%) responded. Their responses indicate that emergency medicine and family practice residency programs provide the most training in EPI, followed by pediatrics, internal medicine, obstetrics-gynecology, and surgery. But overall, EPI training was meager. The findings indicate that 75% of the programs never assigned EPI-oriented readings to the residents and 70% of the programs never gave lectures or seminars on that subject. The author concludes that EPI skills are frequently absent in current medical practice because physicians have not been taught these skills; he recommends that more training is essential and indicates what it might consist of.\r"

The training programs located in a private institution, with the majority of the faculty from the medical school and with a small number of trainees who already had the M.D. or Ph.D. degree, generated the highest proportion of graduates seeking academic careers. Discriminant analysis was done to determine whether a combination of variables would discriminate between those who chose academic careers and those who did not. It indicated that the status of the institution (public or private); the entry degree of the trainee; and the productivity of the training program faculty were sufficient to correctly classify 75.3% (67 of 89) of the students who chose academics and 71.9% (59 of 82) of those who did not. There is now a baseline of data that can be used in future studies.\r"

Four hundred fifty (364 men and 86 women) responded (75%). The women were less likely than the men to be employed full-time; however, proportionately more women than men held full-time academic appointments, treated patients from low-income families, and served in underserved areas in inner cities. The women reported working fewer hours per week and having fewer patients than did the men. The women published scientific articles as often as did the men but were less likely to serve on professional committees, receive professional awards, or develop medical procedures. The women were less concerned about the oversupply of physicians and malpractice litigation. Implications of the findings for health manpower planning and practice pattern expectations are discussed.\r"

Interviews were conducted with 116 people: the presidents and/or deans of all eight Texas HSCs and/or medical schools, other deans and faculty, community leaders in five border counties, and state officials. The school and community perspectives about past and present AHEC activities were compared. Some of the barriers were: insufficient components of the health care delivery system to support medical education in severely underserved areas; differing school and community priorities; cultural differences between the school faculty and the community; and feeling among community physicians and dentists that AHECs were a source of competition. The school and community respondents agreed that the AHEC program needs more cooperative planning and training that emphasizes public health education for future AHEC-like activities with border populations.\r"

The interviews showed that there was variability in the preparation and progress made by the Saudi residents but the benefits to the university in providing training to a small group of carefully selected foreign-trained physicians were greater than the disadvantages. The information gained during the review reinforced the need to do periodic examinations of training opportunities for foreign physicians and yielded recommendations for improving such training.\r"

  ".W": "Rural America is dynamic and challenging, and it is vastly different from what it was mid-way through the century. Unfortunately, many people, including policymakers, have a very outmoded picture of what today's rural America is really like. This paper begins by exploding seven common myths about rural America. Next, three characteristics of the rural environment--diversity, sparse population, and interdependency with broader social and economic forces--are examined in relation to health care delivery and medical education. The contribution of health care to the economic needs of rural America is also explored. The paper closes by noting both altruistic and self-serving motives for the medical education establishment to become more concerned and involved in rural health issues.\r"

  ".W": "Skills needed by physicians to address and prevent our communities' leading causes of premature death--injuries, cancer, cardiovascular disease, homicide, and suicide--are not in the typical roster of medical school learning experiences. And traditional, urban, hospital-based venues of medical education scarcely model for students appealing careers in the community. These twin problems are especially severe in rural America. Yet rural training sites are ideal locations for students to confront the array of social, political, and economic forces underlying ill health in our society. If learning in medical schools is to be suitable for rural practice, students must receive early and sustained exposure to rural communities and to rural physician role models. To facilitate this educational redirection, medical schools must (1) sensitize their existing faculty and residents to community health needs via in-service training on community health topics, (2) encourage faculty and residents to provide service and education outreach to rural communities, and (3) promote rural health research. Finally, to prevent the marginalization of rural health concerns within the academic agenda, efforts should be made to develop university-community partnerships in which model rural training practices and a \"field\" teaching faculty are established and nourished by the medical center.\r"

Given no substantial changes in residency training, the following recommendations are made. Develop a consensus definition of \"rural.\" Educate rural communities to the purpose of residency training. Residency review committees should support rural rotations of at least six months; consider the number of residencies at a site irrelevant for accreditation; judge the quality of the product as the standard of accreditation; and define teaching competency by other than specialty label. All medical school departments should be involved in seeking solutions to the problems of rural health. New opportunities for funding of rural residency training should be sought. If major changes in residency training are possible, internal medicine, family practice, and pediatrics should merge as a single primary care specialty and for residency training. Only this residency should be considered primary care for residency reimbursement purposes, and only its graduates should be reimbursed for primary care services.\r"

Characteristics of successful rural practices include group practice, retention of the same health care providers for more than three years, a community-oriented focus, integration of non-M.D. health care providers, and a commitment to education within the practice. Academic medical centers with area health education centers (AHECs) should consider developing expanded AHECs to provide the education, planning, consultation, and expertise now needed by rural communities.

Cultural ethnocentricity and professional ethnocentricity, the third assumption, are counterproductive. This is especially true in rural America. The fourth assumption, one can only accomplish what one can imagine, sets an infinite range of possibilities for rural health care.

  ".W": "Within the United States Public Health Service, the programs of the Bureau of Health Care Delivery and Assistance have played an important role in improving access to primary care services in rural America. In part, this has been accomplished through the administration of grants to assist in establishing systems of care and the assignment of National Health Service Corps (NHSC) health professionals. From a peak of over 1,600 NHSC-obligated scholarship recipients available for service in 1985, the number of available obligated practitioners has decreased to around 120 in 1990. A main focus of the NHSC has, therefore, necessarily changed from the placement of obligated health professionals to the recruitment of volunteers and increased emphasis on the retention of current providers. The systems of care that have been most successful in their retention efforts have been: group practices, composed of a nucleus of individuals who had been at the site for three to five years; community-oriented, utilizing non-physician providers as part of the delivery team; and those committed to continued provider education. The NHSC has initiated programs to help increase the likelihood that medical students will choose a primary care career and spend all or part of that career serving those most in need. These programs include the National Medical Association Minority Mentor Network, the American Medical Student Association Health Promotion/Disease Prevention Program, the Commissioned Officer Student Training and Externship Program, and the American Academy of Family Physicians Residency Advocate Program. To meet the future needs for access to care in rural America, partnerships with academic centers must be enhanced and expanded.\r"

As a broadly cross-protective AIDS vaccine should protect against infection from all isolates of HIV-1 and HIV-2, we tested CTL specific for the HIV-1 265-279 epitope with peptide analogues from HIV-1ELI, HIV-2 and two simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) isolates, and with recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing the respective gag genes, to determine whether there was any cross-reactivity for this CTL epitope. CTL from the HIV-1-infected donor could recognize the HIV-1ELI peptide, the HIV-2 peptide and recombinant vaccinia virus-infected target and one of the two SIV peptide-treated targets.

The HIV-2BEN sequence is highly divergent from those of previously described HIV-2 and SIV strains. Evolutionary tree analysis of eight HIV-2 sequences reveals the existence of three HIV-2 groups. HIV-2BEN belongs to a group with two isolates from Ghana and The Gambia. Based on a comparison of HIV-2BEN with six HIV-2 isolates, SIVsmm and SIVmac, the variability of the structural env and gag proteins is similar within the HIV-2/SIVsmm/mac and HIV-1 groups. In contrast, the regulatory HIV-1 proteins are more highly conserved than those from HIV-2 strains. Multiple sequence alignments reveal that some domains of the envelope and regulatory proteins are well conserved among HIV-1, HIV-2/SIVsmm/mac, SIVagm and SIVmnd. The identification of conserved domains within the external glycoprotein could help to develop broadly active vaccines.\r"

Since the infection of susceptible cells with HIV leads to cell fusion and subsequent loss of viability, the present study was undertaken to see whether HIV infection can alter the relative content of unsaturated FAs in the host cell membrane and to determine whether this change correlates with cell death. Peripheral lymphocytes (PBLs) of a healthy donor and two CD4+ cell lines were chosen: MT-4, which is killed following HIV infection, with significant cell death being observed 5 days postinfection, and H9 which is not killed. Measurements of FA content of the two cell lines and PBLs, either before or at 6, 24, and 48 h after infection, showed a significant rise in the concentration of unsaturated FAs followed by a drop in the concentration of saturated FAs in the MT-4 cell line. With regard to the H9 cell line similar results were obtained at 6 h from infection. However, at 24 and 48 h the concentrations of saturated FAs returned to preinfection levels while the concentrations of unsaturated FAs dropped to levels even lower than those obtained at zero time. No significant changes in FA composition were found with PBLs.\r"

Virus-specific whole-virus enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (WVE), Western blot (WB) and synthetic peptide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (SPE) were used in sequential fashion to determine the true prevalence of infection; 27% were reactive to HIV-1, 5% to HIV-2, and 10% to both viruses. Of 239 specimens positive on WB for both HIV-1 and HIV-2, SPE diagnosed 38% as HIV-1-reactive and 16% as HIV-2-reactive, while 46% remained reactive to both viruses. Using WVE or one of two rapid (5-10 min) mixed (HIV-1 and HIV-2) antigen tests (RMATs) as a screening test, followed by SPE as a supplemental test, gave results with sensitivity of 97.3-99.2%, specificity of 99.5-99.7%, and positive predictive value for diagnosing HIV infection of 99.4-99.6%, with important savings in time and reagent costs. SPE allows more specific distinction between HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections than WB, and could replace it as a supplemental test in many settings. WB may be required for specimens reactive on screening tests but negative on SPE, until sensitivity of the SPE is further evaluated. A mixed antigen screening test followed by SPE seems to be an efficient testing strategy for diagnosing HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections.\r"

We describe eight children born to mothers who were infected with HIV-2; five developed AIDS, and three were still seropositive at 17-49 months of age. The only apparent route of HIV-2 transmission was from mother to child, except for one child who had been transfused. Three of the children with AIDS died, all having decreased CD4+ lymphocytes and mitogen responses. Further studies are needed to determine the prevalence and natural history of mother-to-child transmission of HIV-2.\r"

Fifty per cent were found to be seropositive, with half of the seropositives meeting the World Health Organization (WHO) clinical AIDS definition. The HIV seropositives had a mortality rate of 50%, which was significantly higher (P = 0.004) than the 30% mortality rate seen in the seronegative group. Direct costs during hospitalization did not differ ($60.30 for HIV seropositives, $56.50 for HIV seronegatives), but pre-hospitalization expenses were significantly higher in the HIV-seropositive group ($170 for HIV seropositives, $110 for HIV seronegatives). Years of productive life lost due to death were also significantly higher for HIV seropositives versus HIV seronegatives (30.6 versus 21.3 years; P = 0.0007), and 73% of the premature mortality in the study population was attributable to HIV infection.\r"

Spanish speakers reported fewer traditional risk factors than English speakers. They were also less likely to report a history of drug or alcohol use or sexually transmitted diseases, and to have had fewer sexual partners.

The purpose of this study was to identify variables associated with HIV risk-taking among younger gay men. Ninety-nine gay men aged 18-25 in three medium-sized West Coast communities completed self-report questionnaires regarding HIV-related behaviors and attitudes. Of the respondents, 43% reported having engaged in unprotected anal intercourse during the previous 6 months. Men who engaged in unprotected anal intercourse reported greater enjoyment of unprotected anal intercourse, perceived less risk of unprotected anal intercourse, labeled themselves as more at risk for AIDS, reported poorer communication skills with sexual partners, and were more likely to have a boyfriend/lover than men who had not engaged in high-risk sex. In addition, respondents perceived the likelihood of acquiring HIV from unprotected anal intercourse with young gay men to be significantly lower than with older gay men. These findings highlight the need for HIV risk-reduction interventions designed specifically for young gay men and identify critical areas to be targeted in such interventions.\r"

These results suggest that identification of healthy women at high risk of HIV infection using non-serological information is not feasible. Thus, since the yearly cost of universal serological screening is prohibitively expensive in the Zairean context, HIV/AIDS education and prevention campaigns may in fact be a more cost-effective means of preventing perinatal transmission of HIV.\r"

To investigate the possibility that HIV-1 can infect fetal central nervous system (CNS) tissue and therefore possibly serve as the substrate for the abnormal neurodevelopment characteristic of pediatric AIDS, eight abortus CNS samples (one set of twins) from seven HIV-1-seropositive intravenous drug users (IVDUs) and eight control abortus CNS samples from eight HIV-1-seronegative IVDUs were analyzed for HIV-1 infection. HIV-1 nucleic acid was detected only after the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in three of eight CNS samples from HIV-seropositive IVDUs but not in samples from seronegative subjects. In situ hybridization confirmed that HIV-1 DNA sequences were in cells in the CNS parenchyma of two of the three positive samples. This study demonstrates that HIV-1 can infect human fetal CNS tissue in vivo, but that the use of PCR may be necessary for its detection.\r"

The drug was not only effective when added to cells immediately after infection, but it also reduced virus production by cells with an established infection. When the liposomal formulation of MTP-PE was used only one treatment was required to achieve maximal effects. During these studies it was noted that the placebo liposomes had some effect in reducing the reverse transcriptase levels found in the supernatants of infected cells. This reduction could not be explained by direct cytotoxic effect.

This has raised the possibility that certain host susceptibility factors (i.e., environmental cofactors) might influence the progression of the disease. In this study we demonstrate that morphine can function to activate HIV/LTR-CAT fusion gene (HIV-long terminal repeat-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) when transfected into undifferentiated human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. The stimulatory effect of morphine is amplified in SH-SY5Y cells that have been induced to differentiate first with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and is much less in cells differentiated with retinoic acid (RA). Morphine does not appreciably activate HIV/LTR-CAT expression in human MOLT-3 and other T cells. Morphine activation of HIV/LTR-CAT in the SH-SY5Y cells is not reversible by naltrexone and appears to involve a Fos/Jun signaling system. Our results suggest that narcotics such as morphine may lead to activation of latent HIV infection. This may be particularly important in tissues, such as brain, which can host latent HIV infection and which is uniquely damaged in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) as evidenced by neuronal degeneration and dementia. We also predict that these findings may have important implications for the pathogenesis of AIDS, particularly in opiate drug abusers.\r"

The results show that HIV-1 isolates with distinct replicative capacity can be distinguished by the intensity of radioactive labeling over single infected cells after in situ hybridization. Sequential isolates from patients with clinically progressive HIV-1 infection show a gradual increase in replicative capacity over time. In PBMC cultures infected with such sequential isolates, intensity of radioactive label over single infected cells increases and is strongest with isolates obtained at the time of low CD4 counts in blood. The results suggest that the restriction of virus replication that operates in the early stages of HIV-1 infection is gradually lost with progression of the disease.\r"

Antibodies directed against restricted regions of the HIV-1 glycoproteins gp120 and gp41 are likely to represent important factors involved in host defense against HIV-1. Definition of qualitative and quantitative differences in the spectrum of anti-gp120 and anti-gp41 antibodies between two vastly different groups of HIV-1-infected individuals, long-term asymptomatic carriers, and individuals with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) who died, might reveal the epitope specificity of antibodies contributing to prevention of clinical disease. To accomplish this goal, sera from both groups were assayed for antibodies recognizing synthetic peptides from gp120/gp41 which were shown in earlier experiments to mimic epitopes on the two HIV-1 glycoproteins. None of the sera recognized all of the distinct 27 peptides from gp120 and gp41. The spectrum of antibodies was distinct for each of the sera from both groups of HIV-1-infected individuals. Nevertheless, antibody responses distinguishing the two groups from each other were discerned. In particular, it was possible to predict the unfavorable outcome of disease by comparative measurements of levels of antibodies to a peptide (303-338), corresponding to the entire V3 hypervariable loop of gp120 and/or by providing evidence for declining levels of these antibodies during the course of infection. Antibodies recognizing additional peptides [(219-245), (280-306), (425-452), (658-682), (729-758), (808-845), and (845-862)] were significantly less prevalent in AIDS patients than in asymptomatic carriers. It appears possible that maintenance of high levels of the respective antibodies would contribute to preventing AIDS in HIV-1-infected individuals. Active immunization with antigens containing epitopes defined by the respective peptides and/or administration of the corresponding antibodies may be considered as a modality for therapy of HIV-1 infections.\r"

The assay is based on cocultivation of serially diluted PBMC of a seropositive person with phytohemagglutinin-stimulated normal PBMC. The microassay has comparable sensitivity with the standard virus culture method in detecting positive HIV cultures. Since the microassay uses only 2-3 x 10(5) patients' PBMC, the assay is also most suitable for HIV isolation from HIV-infected infants or from AIDS patients with extremely low T-cell counts. The microassay can also be used to measure antiviral effects of a drug on persistent HIV infection in vitro. Because the microassay measures the relative number of infected PBMC, it can be readily used for following the quantitative antiviral effect of a drug in a clinical trial.\r"

  ".W": "The antiviral activity against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 of the two structurally related thymidine analogs azidothymidine and fluorothymidine, both alone and in combination, was tested. Fluorothymidine was tenfold more active than azidothymidine. The selectivity indices of the two compounds were similar. The combination of azidothymidine and fluorothymidine showed clearly synergistic antiviral activity, and diminished cytotoxicity. The inhibition of reverse transcriptase from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 by the triphosphates of azidothymidine and fluorothymidine, both alone and in combination was also tested. Azidothymidine triphosphate was a fourfold stronger inhibitor than fluorothymidine triphosphate. The combination of the two showed only additive (and not synergistic) effects upon reverse transcriptase. The combination of azidothymidine and fluorothymidine showed both synergistic antiviral activity and diminished cytotoxicity, and may therefore represent a promising therapeutic strategy. The additive (and not synergistic) inhibition of reverse transcriptase by the combination of the triphosphates indicates that in cell culture additional factors other than inhibition of the reverse transcriptase by the triphosphates influence the antiviral activity of the combination. Such factors might include effects upon normal nucleoside metabolism or metabolism of the analogs. Alternatively, one of the nucleosides might have an additional mechanism of action besides inhibition of the reverse transcriptase.\r"

Between 1980 and 1986, among 25-44 year olds in the highest cumulative incidence group for AIDS, sepsis mortality increased from 3.3 to 15.2 deaths/100,000/year, an increase of 11.9 deaths/100,000/year (95% confidence interval (6.9, 17.0) deaths/100,000/year); mortality from central nervous system abscesses increased from zero to 1.7 (0.1, 3.2) deaths/100,000/year; and mortality from endocarditis increased from 0.8 deaths/100,000/year to 2.4 deaths/100,000/year, an increase of 1.6 (-0.5, 3.7) deaths/100,000/year. Age-matched New Jersey patient populations with low cumulative incidence of AIDS did not sustain a similar increase. The HIV disease-associated increase in sepsis mortality among young populations represents a new component of the substantial increase in U.S. sepsis mortality that occurred over the last two decades, but was previously limited to older populations.\r"

Ten patients (mean age = 49) were admitted in serious condition (CI = 1.8 +/- 0.2 L/min/m2, PCWP = 28 +/- 6 mmHg, systolic aortic pressure = 88 +/- 20 mmHg, urine output 11 +/- 20 ml/hr) and were treated by maximal sympathomimetic support and i.v. enoximone. Two had to be implanted with a total artificial heart (TAH) and one with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) for recurrent fibrillation despite hemodynamic improvement, within 8 hr. Two have received transplants and are living well after 20 months. Seven who initially improved markedly have been listed as urgent transplant candidates: two of these have been successfully transplanted, and three died suddenly after 6, 25, and 45 days, respectively. One has undergone successful coronary surgery. One patient (age 62, diabetic) was secondarily rejected for a transplant and died. This experience clearly shows that despite initial spectacular hemodynamic improvement, which was due to optimized medical management, death rate before transplant because of sudden ventricular fibrillation remains unacceptably high. This should prompt early mechanical support, with less invasive systems, in patients with AMI.\r"

This complication must be addressed before the full potential benefit of these devices, especially fully implantable devices, can be realized. A review of research reports and clinical data was conducted to ascertain if similarities existed between the patterns of infection reported in human TAH recipients and those seen in the experimental animal models. Infection was reported in approximately 57% of the human TAH recipients and approximately 47% of the implanted animals. Implant periods ranged from 1-620 days for the humans, and 32-287 days for the animals. The spectrum of organisms isolated from both groups were similar, with a high proportion of infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis. In addition, numerous isolates of Enterobacter and Enterococci were obtained from the animals. Positive blood cultures have often been observed in animals within 2-4 weeks following implantation of the devices. The similarities noted in this review suggest that the calf may be an appropriate animal model in which to study the pathogenesis of TAH-related infection.\r"

Artificial hearts have come into practical use as left ventricular assist devices, and have contributed to the saving of many patients with severe postoperative low cardiac output syndrome, but they sometimes encounter severe complications, i.e. cerebrovascular bleeding, thromboembolism, infection, or multiple organ failure. It is very important, therefore, to control coagulation and fibrinolysis adequately during cardiac support by an LVAD.\r"

It was hoped that thereby problems of shortening dialysis could be separated from problems inherent in the patient. Otherwise healthy dialysis patients (n = 556) were divided into age groups (less than 50, 51-75, and greater than 75 years) and studied during four periods, 1966-75, 1976-82, 1983-85, and 1986-88. Dialysis time was shortened from 17 to 2.7 hr per treatment during that time, but a Kt/V of 1.3 maintained. Generally, both first- and four-year cumulative survival improved as dialysis was shortened, and four-year cumulative survival was best in all age groups during 1986-88 when dialysis was shortest. During this time, the four-year cumulative survival was no different from that of the age-matched total U.S. population. Shortening of dialysis time and increasing efficiency while keeping at least a 4.0, stable, weekly Kt/V has not been harmful to healthy patients on dialysis, but has led to continued improvement on cumulative survival.\r"

Patients in Group 1 had significantly lower BUN, creatinine, hematocrit, and serum albumin. Results of all other laboratory tests were not significantly different. Numbers of hospitalizations and days in the hospital were higher in Group 1. Causes of hospitalization were similar in all groups. Mortality rate was 8% in Group 1 vs. 4.4% in Group 2. Dialysis prescription using UK has maintained the annual mortality rate at about 14% for the past nine years.\r"

Kt/V was less than 0.8 in 16 patients (Group A), 0.8-1.0 in 20 (Group B), and greater than 1.0 in 15 (Group C).

Dialysis-related hospital admissions were similar (p greater than 0.05). These data suggest patients with higher body weights, and men, frequently had a Kt/V less than 0.8. Kt/V that did not influence biochemical parameters or hospitalizations in this population. This indicates that Kt/V may not be a good predictor of morbidity, and/or some heavier patients may do fairly well even with a Kt/V less than 0.8.

To evaluate the relative risk (RR) of dying, by income, a Cox survival regression model was used to adjust for age, race (black versus white), gender, dialytic treatment modality, year of first end-stage renal disease (ESRD) therapy, and primary cause of ESRD. The average household income reported from census data for the ZIP Code of residence for each patient was analyzed as a socioeconomic indicator. Treatment modality on day 120 of ESRD was classified as either center hemodialysis (HD) or CAPD. All new patients, aged 20-59 and registered at the Michigan Kidney Registry between 1/1/80 and 12/31/87 were included in the study. Patients were followed from day 180 of ESRD until death, censoring at transplant, or 12/31/87. The adjusted relative risk of dying decreased for black patients by 3.3% per $1,000 increase in income (p less than 0.01), while the trend by income for white patients was negligible (p greater than 0.10). The difference in trends for the two groups was statistically significant (p less than 0.01). This is a surprising result, since white patients have higher death rates, overall, than do black patients, particularly among subgroups with diabetes and hypertension whose RR was 1.77 and 1.82, respectively. Poor socioeconomic status of the area of residence has a strongly negative effect on survival for black patients, but not for white patients. The reasons for the relationship of death rates with income, especially for black patients, need to be examined in greater detail.\r"

The authors studied fundamental behaviors of endothelial cells (EC), including adhesion, spreading, migration, and growth, on various segmented polyurethanes (SPU) with a wide variety of wettability. Endothelialization has a synergistic action on these cellular behaviors that was quantitatively evaluated by phase contrast microscopy. Surface characteristics of SPU were analyzed by contact angle measurement and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Adhesion, spreading, migration, growth, and endothelialization in vitro of bovine aortic EC on relatively hydrophobic SPU exceeded those on both a hydrophilic SPU, and a very hydrophobic siliconized one. Minimal interaction with EC was found for hydrophilic SPU. Adherent cells tended to be delaminated from siliconized SPU in a later culture period. The addition of a peptidyl antagonist of adhesive protein receptor inhibited adhesion of EC on SPU. These results suggest that surface characteristics, possibly regulating adsorption of adhesive proteins, are important factors in the development of vascular SPU prostheses.\r"

One method involves in situ heparin immobilization on a segmented polyurethane urea (Biomer) surface via hydrophilic poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO, Mn = 4,000) spacers. The other method uses PEO/poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) block co-polymer and heparin covalently linked in a block co-polymer system (PEO-PDMS-Hep). These surfaces have demonstrated high heparin bioactivity in vitro and excellent blood compatibility in in vitro-ex vivo experiments. This report evaluates the long-term in vivo blood compatibility of these heparin immobilized surfaces. Vascular grafts (6 mm ID, 7 cm in length) were fabricated with Biomer, and heparin was immobilized in situ with PEO spacers (B-PEO4K) and coated on their luminal surfaces with PEO-PDMS-Hep. Biomer and PEO (Mn = 4,000) grafted Biomer (B-PEO4K) were used as controls. The grafts were implanted in the abdominal aorta of dogs and retrieved at 3 months or when graft occlusion was suspected. Retrieved grafts were evaluated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). TEM measured the thickness of the adsorbed protein layer on the surface and the protein distribution (albumin, fibrinogen, and IgG) visualized by an immunogold method. All heparin immobilized grafts were patent at 3 months, whereas Biomer and B-PEO4K grafts occluded within 1 month. SEM pictures of heparin immobilized surfaces after 3 months demonstrated minimal platelet adhesion and activation without detectable fibrin formation. Heparin immobilized surfaces showed a thin protein layer (300-600 A) even after 3 months, with high concentrations of albumin and IgG and less fibrinogen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Two biomaterials--polyurethane, a commonly used substance, and Velcro pile (used in the Jarvik 7 heart)--were evaluated. Two control substances, polyethylene and serum-coated polystyrene, were used for comparison. Neutrophil superoxide release was measured following incubation with these materials for 10, 30, and 120 min in the absence of additional stimulation and after stimulation with formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine (fMLP) or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). The authors observed that the incubation of neutrophils on both polyurethane and Velcro resulted in substantially increased superoxide release that was greater after the 10 min than after the 30 or 120 min association. These activated neutrophils exhibited a poor additional response to fMLP but responded well to PMA. The effect of implantation of the Novacor left ventricular assist device on peripheral blood neutrophil function was also evaluated. The peripheral blood neutrophils exhibited normal superoxide release and chemotaxis. These studies suggest that biomaterials may have a profound local effect on neutrophils, which may predispose the patient to periprosthetic infection, but that the reactivity of circulating neutrophils is unimpaired.\r"

Thromboxane B2 (TxB2) levels were evaluated at the proximal anastomosis (w), 5.0 (x), 25.0 (y), and 50.0 (z) cm distal from w, and platelet counts and mean platelet volumes were monitored at sites w and z. TxB2 levels increased after blood entered the graft and progressively increased until the blood exited at the distal anastomosis. Platelet counts did not significantly change across the graft. Over time, systemic platelet counts decreased to approximately 50% of each dog's pregraft baseline levels and remained depressed over a 1 year period. Mean platelet volumes peaked 1-3 weeks after implant and remained greater than pregraft levels. Examination of the graft luminal surface showed a developed pseudointima characteristically similar to that which develops in mature human vascular grafts. These results suggest that healed vascular grafts in canines continue to stimulate platelet release of TxB2, reduce systemic platelet counts, and increase mean platelet volumes over 1 year. These data further suggest that platelets are stimulated by the graft and consumed.\r"

The washed red blood cell concentrate was reinfused after protamine injection. Plasma C3a was measured by radioimmunoassay preoperatively, 5 min before CPB, at 5, 60, and 90 min during CPB, 5 min after protamine infusion, at the end of surgery, and after 24 hr. In addition, a clinical score based on renal, pulmonary, neurologic, and myocardial postoperative evolution was given (0-8) to every patient. Results were compared with the C3a changes and clinical scores obtained from 26 routine (no CS) cardiac surgical patients. Results showed maximal C3a generation after protamine and no further activation in cases of CS concentrate reinfusion, which ranged from 400 ml to 2,000 ml. No difference in clinical score was observed between the CS (1 +/- 1) and control (0.85 +/- 0.6) groups. The authors conclude that the CS does not enhance complement activation resulting from extracorporeal circulation and can be safely used as a blood saving strategy in cardiac surgery.\r"

All experiments were done with three types of medical grade polymer material (from USSR): silicone rubber (SR), polyurethane \"Vitur\" (PU), and polyethylene (PE). Biochemical, radioisotopic, SEM, and EDAX methods were used in in vitro and in vivo experiments. The diffusion chamber model was used in animal experiments. SR was shown to induce greater changes in complex formation processes and to adsorb more Ca containing complexes than PE or PU. In addition to the degree of SR calcification seen after 21 days, implantation accentuated these findings. The possibility of calcification of polymer materials without direct contact of material and cells was observed. Combining the in vitro and in vivo experimental data, the authors propose a hypothetical scheme of biomaterial calcification.\r"

A perturbation solution to the one-speed radiative transport equation was used in the design and calibration of these cuvettes. A series of tests were performed with these cuvettes in an extracorporeal left ventricular assist device bovine model, and in a recirculating closed-loop flow system containing anticoagulated whole baboon blood, to determine to what extent they affect platelet and erythrocyte function ex vivo and in vitro. Serial hemolysis tests, thromboxane radioimmunoassay measurements, platelet counts, and activated partial thromboplastin times were measured. All of these tests with cuvettes in the extracorporeal and in vitro circuits were statistically indistinguishable from baseline measurements, suggesting the usefulness of this system for the measurement of microemboli in blood-contacting materials of extracorporeal circuits and cardiac assist devices.\r"

Aggregation was markedly enhanced by HMV-1 cells in a cell number-dependent fashion under shear stress of 12 dyne/cm2. Enhancement was not observed at a high shear stress of 108 dyne/cm2. A monoclonal antibody against GPIIb/IIIa, 7E3 completely abolished enhancement of aggregation by HMV-1. Apyrase had similar inhibitory effects. Scanning electronmicroscopy showed that direct contacts of platelets with HMV-1 cells could be demonstrated when platelet-platelet interaction was inhibited by 7E3 or apyrase. These results may indicate that, at a shear stress of 12 dyne/cm2, direct contacts of platelets and HMV-1 cells may trigger enhancement of platelet aggregation.\r"

Because percutaneous or endoscopic drainage methods are fraught with complications, an endoprosthesis for surgical intubation of the biliary tract has been developed. Thirty patients were treated by this method. After choledochotomy, the endoprosthesis is positioned surgically above the sphincter of Oddi, thereby avoiding ascending cholangitis. Twenty-nine patients (13 with gallbladder cancer, 11 with cholangiocarcinomas, 5 with metastases) presented with neoplastic compression, and one patient had an early postoperative stricture with loss of substance after right hepatectomy for hepatic metastases. The operative mortality was 3.3% (one pulmonary complication). Resolution of jaundice was obtained in all but two patients, and pruritus always resolved. The mean survival time for the patients with cholangiocarcinoma was 12.2 months and 6.33 months for those with gallbladder cancer. Indices of satisfaction (Bismuth's method) were 71% (gallbladder cancer), 93.5% (hilar cholangiocarcinoma), and 92% (metastatic compressions). This new type of surgical endoprosthesis is an alternative in the palliative treatment of neoplastic hilar compression because it is well tolerated, has a low rate of operative mortality or morbidity, and affords an acceptable quality of life for the patients.\r"

The development of a novel transvenous PDA occlusion technique using a temperature-shape changeable occluder device, and the verification of its in vitro performance, were demonstrated in this study. The principles of this technique are: 1) the bar form device was inserted into the PDA transvenously by a guide wire and a pushing catheter, 2) the device was dashed with hot water through catheters, 3) the device was expanded by hot water in the PDA, and the PDA was occluded. The occluder device, made of a shape memory polymer (polynorbornene), was designed to have the monobloc configuration of a thin disk with a hole for a guide wire in the center and a cone. The barlike device by hot press was fully expanded within 10 sec upon immersion into 45 degrees C water. The mock-circulation test with the \"great arteries\" and a specially designed \"PDA\" showed 1) the introduction of hot water (45 degrees C) through the catheters caused expansion of the device which stayed in the \"PDA\" without any support, 2) the \"aortic\" pressure and the distal \"aortic\" flow increased rapidly, and the \"pulmonary\" flow reduced promptly. This resulted in a drastically reduced shunt ratio at the PDA from 68% to 30%. Thus, the novel PDA occlusion technique developed here functioned well to occlude the PDA in a great arteries model.\r"

The balloon was asynchronously inflated (CS occlusion) for 5 sec and then deflated for 5 sec with 1 cc/sec of flow. The left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded with inflation of a percutaneous transluminal coronary angiography balloon and therapy started immediately. In a control group (no therapy, n = 4) all developed VF by 30 min after coronary artery occlusion. The drugs lidocaine (L), esmolol (E), adenosine (A), and deferoxamine (D) were evaluated for effects on eliminating developing VF with intravenous (i.v.) administration compared with RV administration with venous blood (VB) or arterial blood (AB). The percent survival after CA occlusion (no VF) was: L i.v., 0%; L RV with VB, 43%; L RV with AB, 17%; E i.v., 50%; E RV with VB, 70%; A. i.v., 29%; A RV with VB, 88%; D i.v., 17%; and D RV with AB, 80%. There was a trend toward lower myocardial necrosis (seen by tetrazolium stain and/or light microscopy) in the RV survivors (especially with VB) compared with the group i.v. survivors. These data suggest that RV antiarrhythmic drug delivery is a feasible alternative to i.v. administration during CA occlusion.\r"

The therapy has several problems, including difficulty in handling, sterilization, and time consumption. To solve these problems, new materials able to induce antitumor immune cells were investigated. Pokeweed mitogen (PWM) and PWM-conjugated materials (CMC-1) could induce strong killer cells by short-term stimulation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). The induced killer cells showed a wide killing spectrum in vitro against human tumor cell lines (MKK-1, PRMI4788, NBT-2, ZR-7530, H-1, Hela, KB, HMV-1, PC-10, C-1). Human PBL stimulated for a short time by CMC-1 also showed a tumoricidal effect on tumor bearing (MKN-1, MKN-45) nude mice. These results suggest that CMC-1 may solve the problems with currently used LAK therapy and may provide easily applicable extracorporeal immunotherapy for cancer.\r"

In the current study, the antithrombotic effect of E5510 during HD was investigated. Eleven mongrel dogs with bilateral ureteral ligation were given 0.1 mg/kg of E5510 orally 1 hr before undergoing 4 hr HD using hollow fiber dialyzers, (PMMA 5, regenerated cellulose 6) without heparin and under general anesthesia. Blood samples were taken before the administration of E5510 and before and 1, 2, 3, and 4 hr after starting HD; blood counts, hematocrits, blood chemistries, and plasma thromboxane levels (TxB2) were examined. Platelet aggregation, activated clotting times (ACT), and activated partial thrombin times (APTT) were also measured, and sequential plasma E5510 concentrations were determined. In 10 of 11 anuric dogs, non-heparin HD was successfully done with minimal clotting in the dialyzer and drip chambers. The maximum aggregation rate was depressed to less than 20% of the initial value throughout HD. Plasma TxB2 concentration was depressed, and ACT and APTT were mildly, but not significantly prolonged. Neither hemorrhagic complications nor other side effects of E5510 were observed.\r"

Recently, a method using hypertonic citrate has been reported as being safe and efficacious, and having several advantages over the usual techniques. Two patients who suffered cardiac arrests after dialysis using hypertonic citrate are discussed. Both received anticoagulation as described in the literature, although the citrate infusion rate was lower than recommended. Electrocardiograms obtained during the first such session showed no change in the Q-Tc interval with initiation of the infusion in either patient. Both were noted to have cardiac arrest within 5 minutes of discontinuation of dialysis, without warning symptoms, following the second and fifteenth treatments, respectively. The initial rhythm of ventricular fibrillation did not respond to standard advanced cardiac life support therapy, and the patients were not successfully resuscitated until they received intravenous calcium. The authors postulate that the loss of positive calcium flux from the dialysate, in conjunction with circulating unmetabolized citrate, caused an electrolyte imbalance leading to the potentially fatal arrhythmia. Caution is recommended in using this method of regional anticoagulation.\r"

Correction of anemia was accompanied by an increase in natural killer cells and a decrease in B lymphocytes. In the 11 patients (Group 1) with a baseline helper/suppressor (T4/T8) ratio greater than or equal to 2, the latter significantly decreased from 3.0 +/- 0.3 to 2.1 +/- 0.3 through both an increase in T8 cells and a decrease in T4 cells (p less than 0.005). Among the 12 patients with a pre-EPO T4/T8 ratio less than 2 (Group 2), no difference in T cell subsets was observed. The decrease in ferritin levels observed over the study period was not significant. In addition, the mean increase in hemoglobin levels during the first month of rhEPO therapy was greater in Group 2 than in Group 1 (1.1 +/- 0.3 vs. 0.6 +/- 0.3 g/dl, p less than 0.025). No change in any parameter was observed in eight control patients not receiving rhEPO. These results suggest that rhEPO can induce changes in lymphocyte subpopulations of hemodialysis patients through mechanism(s) yet to be clarified; conversely, the T4/T8 ratio might be a predictive factor for the erythropoietic response to rhEPO.\r"

All patients underwent dialysis with polysulfone hollow fiber dialyzers. Mean time-averaged blood urea nitrogen (BUN) value was 50 +/- 12 mg/dl, and Kt/V for urea was 1.20 +/- 0.34/dialysis. The initial dose of EPO was 2,800 +/- 950 U/dialysis (45 +/- 17 U/kg/dialysis). The maintenance dose averaged 2,500 U/dialysis. Within the mean time of observation, 15 +/- 4 weeks, all but one patient responded to EPO by eliminating transfusion requirements, and 29 of 32 achieved the target hematocrit of 30-33%. For patients with hematocrits below 25% before EPO, the increase averaged 1.6 +/- 0.8%/week. The dose of EPO was lower and the hematocrit response was higher than reported previously. The rate of increase in hematocrit did not correlate with small molecular weight solute removal. Mean red blood cell survival was 52 +/- 18 days. No adjustments in blood pressure (BP) medications or dry weight were required to control BP. These data and earlier experiences with recovery from the anemia of ESRD after more effective dialysis suggest that the bone marrow response to EPO may be augmented by high flux hemodialysis.\r"

During the last 5 years, heart transplantation in neonates and infants (0-28 days and 1-12 months, respectively) has been the most rapidly growing area within the pediatric patient population. No adequate mechanical circulatory support system, designed to be used as a bridge to transplantation, is available for many of these pediatric patients. Neonates are the smallest candidates to potentially benefit from heart transplantation, and their often acute need for either heart transplantation or temporary circulatory support indicates that any new development of a pediatric bridging device should focus on this youngest group. Subsequently, such a device may be modified to any weight or age group. An innovative total artificial heart design was developed in an attempt to meet the anatomic and physiologic requirements of neonates and infants. This report discusses the rapidly growing pediatric heart transplantation patient population, as well as an innovative total artificial heart design.\r"

  ".W": "The Utah-100 total artificial heart was initially designed and tested in 1983. General design goals, including improved fit for human application, improved reliability, and elimination of thrombus formation, were identified as improvements over the clinically used Jarvik-7 artificial heart, previously developed at the Institute for Biomedical Engineering, University of Utah. Specific design goals included 1) elimination of connector and valve-associated thrombus formation and 2) elimination of gross mineralization, thrombus formation, and creases on the blood-pumping diaphragm of the device. Explant retrieval results from 29 calves and sheep implanted with the Jarvik-7 artificial heart were compared with results from 25 calves and sheep implanted with the Utah-100 artificial heart. Macroscopic thrombus formation was found in 44% of the connectors of the Jarvik-7 artificial-hearts, compared with 2% (p less than or equal to 0.01) in animals with the Utah-100 artificial heart. Subvalvular and supravalvular thrombi were observed in 33% of the valves in the Jarvik-7 artificial heart and 10% (p less than or equal to 0.01) of the valves in the Utah-100 artificial heart. Mineralization of the pumping diaphragm was observed in 12% of the animals implanted with the Jarvik-7 artificial heart and in 4% of the animals with the Utah-100 diaphragms. Thrombus formation in the diaphragm-housing interface occurred in 2% of Jarvik-7 ventricles and in 6% of the Utah-100 ventricles. There were no identifiable diaphragm creases in the Utah-100 diaphragms, but a 10% incidence was found in Jarvik-7 devices. These results validate substantial progress toward improved design and fabrication methods in the Utah-100 total artificial heart.\r"

The pumping unit consists of biolized surface-treated pusher plate blood pumps powered by an interventricular electrohydraulic energy converter. A variable volume device references the back side of the pusher plates to lung pressure. Electrical power is supplied by a transcutaneous energy transmission system, integrated with a wearable external battery pack. An implanted internal battery provides back-up power. System design and optimization efforts have resulted in a compact pumping unit package and an overall TAH that meets anatomic, physiologic, and engineering requirements. Overall pumping unit basic dimensions are 98 mm diameter and 80 mm thick. The blood pumps have a truncated conical shape and are separated by a thin interventricular septum 21 mm thick. Theoretical stroke volume is 64 ml, and maximum stroke length is 13.2 mm. Normal pump operation is at 90% of full stroke, which yields a net output of 53 ml, with valve regurgitation taken into account.\r"

Our soft TAH, which has no quick connectors, can be squeezed and bent, making it easily implantable, and blood damage is reduced by the use of trileaflet and biflap polyurethane valves. The soft ventricles were made by vacuum forming, after which the pieces were welded together by radiofrequency heat sealing. A rapid clamshell can be pushed and slipped over the soft heart to prevent deformation of the ventricle. Three calves have had the 60 cc soft TAH implanted, both with and without a clamshell. The cardiac outputs were as high as 7 L/min, without a vacuum applied during diastole. Two lambs received the 20 cc TAH (as an acute experiment); it fit and functioned well. One healthy lamb received a 20 cc left ventricular assist device (LVAD) with a pulsating artificial atrium as a survival experiment. The lamb survived for 8 days, after which the device was removed and the lamb returned to the meadow. Thrombosis in the TAH was minimal, and the plasma free hemoglobin values in all the TAH and LVAD experiments were usually lower than 5 mg/dl and often lower than 2 mg/dl.\r"

In the actuator is a brushless DC motor sandwiched between two metal bellows or two pusher-plate pumps connected with the blood pumps by polyvinylchloride tubes. A roller-screw system coupled with the bellows is used for alternative pumping, and silicone oil transmits the action. The pumps are elliptical, and the right pump has a flatter and longer shape than the left to fit the extremely short distance between the right atrium and the sternum. To evaluate in vivo performance, the pumps were implanted as a pneumatic system in a calf weighing 53 kg and three goats weighing 54-55 kg. The pump fit well in the animals, and the calf survived for 111 days, and one goat was alive for 8 days. The EHTAH system could provide an output of 6 L/min with pusher-plate pumps as oil chambers on in vitro evaluation. This system could become one of the most suitable approaches for a totally implantable system.\r"

Active filling (-10 mmHg) inside inner blood sacs was produced by the suction effects of the outer sacs attached to a moving actuator. Two acute animal experiments were performed using the pendulum pump with a Coridale sheep (50 kg weight), and a male calf (70 kg weight). A test was made of 30 minutes of tether-free operation of the implanted pendulum pump inside the small chest of the calf.

A model of the pump, including the cannulae and the interference of the cannula and the left atrial wall, was added to a simulator of the circulation. It was implemented on a PC-AT using the analog simulating software AGO1000. An interval of 1 msec real-time per calculation step was evaluated to provide stable results. The calculation speed was approximately 100 msec per step. First simulation studies showed that both the positioning and resistance of the cannulae exert a major influence on system performance and equalized the different pressure-flow characteristics of vaneless and impeller pumps (difference of dp/dQ decreases from more than 6 times without cannulae to 130% with cannulae). In addition, the effects of suction in the atrial cannula, and changes of ventricular performance during changes in pumping power, could be properly simulated. The comparison with animal tests proved that the model is a suitable tool for testing control algorithms for centrifugal pumps.\r"

The in vitro atrial shunt was comprised of a 8 mm (PTFE) Teflon graft placed between the left and the right atrium. Other features under study were 1) cardiac output (CO) response to preload, 2) CO relationship to mean aortic pressure, and 3) balance of ventricular outputs. The tests were performed by varying the right filling pressure and monitoring ventricular output and inflow/outflow pressures. Effects of changes in afterload were simulated by varying the (AoP) pressure from 80 mmHg to 120 mmHg, and the (PAP) pressure from 15 mmHg to 40 mmHg. The test results indicated a rise in CO from 4 L/min to 9 L/min, with a change in mean right atrial pressure from 0 mmHg to 12 mmHg. No significant difference in CO was found as afterload pressures were varied. The interatrial shunt (IAS) was effective in establishing ventricular balance over a wide range of preload and afterload conditions, and a mean positive flow from left to right was maintained in the atrial shunt, even at conditions simulating an extreme left-right imbalance.\r"

The device is a non centrifugal, valveless, low speed rotary pump, electrically powered, based on Wankel engine principle. The authors developed an implantable electrical actuator resulting in a compact, sealed motor-pump unit with electrical and magnetic components insulated from fluids. The results in the flow curve and in the pumping action show some common points but also some basic differences compared to classical pulsatile pumps or centrifugal pumps. The blood coming from the atrium follows a continuous movement without any stop flow but with variations creating pulsatility. Ejection and filling of the pump are simultaneous. It is always an active filling. Hydraulic efficiency depends on clearance in the pumping chamber and outlet port pressure. A 60 cc device allows flows up to 8-9 liters. The implantable motor is cyclindrical in shape, has a moderate weight (490 grams) and presents a good efficiency (32% for a rotary speed of 90 rpm against a mean aortic pressure of 150 mm of Hg). The authors conclude that their device could be proposed after further experimental studies, as an LVAD for shortterm assistance with a good promise for permanent application.\r"

The working mechanism of this system is as follows: 1) liquid gas is used for the driving source; 2) a liquid gas is stored in its liquid state in the circuit; 3) a liquid gas is vaporized, and the vaporizing pressure squeezes the blood pump, causing ejection of blood; 4) vaporized gas is aspirated and compressed by a small compressor to liquefaction through the heat exchanger, then negative pressure is applied to the blood pump and blood is aspirated; and 5) the blood pump is driven in this closed cycle. To demonstrate the mechanism of this system, a prototype was developed using Freon 114 as the liquid gas. In this system, the maximum flow of the AH at a 100 pulse per minute rate, was about 6.9 L/min, using a 90 ml sac type blood pump. The advantages of this AH driving mechanism are as follows: 1) a small system is available because pressure chambers are not necessary; 2) a biventricular system is available, with a single compressor; 3) no compliance chamber is necessary if the system is small enough to be implanted.\r"

The error sources were examined using in vitro test conditions, with both the inflow and outflow, as well as COMDU flow readings, being analyzed. Transducer and calibration error sources were also identified, and the accuracy of the method for determining cardiac output for the in vitro test conditions was quantified. With a more accurate calibration scheme, the in vitro average error was reduced from -16.2% (range of 0.1% to -41.1%) to 0.1% (range 4.8% to -3.65). The major error sources were identified as missed inflow, transducer calibration and drift, and system variance.\r"

The advantages of a TPF VCC over the currently employed flexible compliance chambers are as follows: 1) the TPF VCC has rigid external walls, eliminating the deleterious effects of fibrous ingrowth; 2) the internal diaphragm is made of Saran HB, which has a permeability two orders of magnitude less than that of butyl rubber; and 3) the TPF VCC has an external volume of 477 ml, comparable to that of the flexible compliance chambers used for electric VADs with a stroke volume of 100 ml. Experiments were conducted with the VCC attached to an electric VAD operated in a mock circulatory system. The results show that the strong temperature sensitivity of Freon vapor pressure does not compromise VAD flow output over a temperature range of 6 degrees C. Since body temperature generally fluctuates no more than 5 degrees C, this result is promising. A compromise is seen, however, in VAD power consumption. As the temperature of the VCC drops 6 degrees C, the mean pressure of the system drops 95 mmHg, causing an increase in power consumption that may require introduction of a temperature control system.\r"

The LVAD was driven by a pulsatile piston pump acting on an attached segmented polyurethane diaphragm. Bjork-Shiley tilting disc valves were used to provide unidirectional flow through the inlet and outlet ports. A seeded blood analog fluid, which matched the kinematic viscosity of blood at high shear rates and the refractive index of Plexiglas, was used to make the measurements. At each location, 250 instantaneous velocity realizations were collected at eight instances during the pump cycle. The maximum Reynolds shear and normal stresses were calculated for each pump cycle time and location after filtering the data. The results reveal that the highest Reynolds shear and normal stresses occur in the near wall region just proximal to the aortic valve during diastole, and reach values of 5,300 dynes/cm2 and 10,800 dynes/cm2, respectively. The elevated turbulent stresses are observed during the period of regurgitant flow through the aortic valve, with peak stress values arising during the period of peak regurgitant flow. This supports the hypothesis that a regurgitant turbulent jet is formed near the wall of the prosthetic aortic valve and may be contributing to blood damage.\r"

A two-corner piston rotates on an eccentric shaft in a trochoidal path, thus creating a gap seal. The pump is driven by a water-cooled DC motor. For right ventricular assist, a cannula was inserted into the right ventricle through the right atrium, and into the left ventricle for left ventricular assist. From a total of 10 experiments, two left ventricular assists, two right ventricular assists, and three biventricular assists were evaluated. The pump produced a pulsatile flow of 3 L at 70 rpm. Energy requirements were 2.19 watts for left, 2.06 for right, and 7.26 for biventricular assists. Plasma hemoglobin remained as low as 10 mg/dl during monoventricular, and increased during biventricular assists to 20 mg/dl after 3 hr, when it started to chop again; after 6 hr it was 16 mg/dl. From these preliminary results it is concluded that this new type of blood pump may be suitable as a circulatory assist device.\r"

The actuator was designed to be fixed on the goat's back with a saddle. The pump was connected between the left atrium and descending aorta and placed paracorporeally on the chest wall. Linear action of an actuator bellows was delivered by silicone oil in a U-shaped polyvinylchloride tube to activate the pump. The maximum output in the 56 kg goat was 5.0 L/min. Goats could stand and sit freely. The first goat with a pusher-plate type pump died on the fifth day because of thromboembolism, but the second goat with a diaphragm type pump survived for 42 days. Blood chemistries remained within normal limits. Pump control was easy in both the duty-control mode and the stroke-control mode. With the automatic negative pressure control (ANPC) to prevent atrial wall sucking, the left atrial pressure was kept within +/- 10 mmHg, although left atrial pressure sometimes went below -80 mmHg without ANPC. Considering reliability, automaticity, and portability, the electrohydraulic ventricular assist system has become another choice for a practical, electrically driven ventricular assist system.\r"

The EHTAH system demonstrated physiologic autoregulation with Starling-like responsiveness to preload. Output varied from 4 to 9 L/min, as right atrial pressure increased from 3 to 15 mmHg. Device output was minimally influenced by afterload. The efficacy of an IAS to balance the EHTAH was demonstrated over a wide range of preload and afterload conditions. Interatrial shunt flow rates, reflective of the degree of right-left imbalance, varied from 2% to 14% (IAS flow from left to right) of cardiac output. Left atrial pressures typically did not exceed right atrial pressures by more than 6-8 mmHg using an instrumented vascular graft such as the IAS. The simplicity and distinct anatomic, surgical, and engineering advantages of the IAS approach to right-left balance of implanted electrically powered artificial hearts justify further development toward a reliable long-term design.\r"

Histologic observations indicated that this biomaterial provoked only a transient, modest inflammatory response, and the resorption rate was compatible with the nerve regeneration processes. Phagocytosis of the biomaterial began after neoangiogenesis and cell migration had taken place from both stumps into the nerve guide material. For comparison, the regeneration achieved was evaluated in nerve guides made of either HYAFF11p75 or Silastic, and in nerves repaired with the autograft technique. Recovery was assessed in vivo 90 days after implantation by measuring the nerve compound action potential (CAP) and conduction velocity (NCV) of the regenerated tibial nerve. The results demonstrate that the nerve guide tubes made of HYAFF11p75 were able to support and direct axonal growth, thereby suggesting a possible use for such biomaterial in the management of short nerve gaps in human pathology.\r"

The characteristic features of the system are that polymers have recognition sites and are solution-castable on material surfaces. These co-polymers were prepared by radical co-polymerization of styrene with peptidyl macromer, which include an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence, the minimal core peptide recognizable by cell adhesion receptors. Upon casting and subsequent immersion into water, RGD-peptide chains were enriched at the interface with water. Bovine endothelial cells (ECs) adhered to the cast surface, and adhesion was partly directed by RGD-recognition mechanisms. These co-polymers, incorporated with artificial bioactive ligands, may provide an artificial extracellular matrix (ECM) for implantable devices and hybrid organs using a conventional solution-casting technique.\r"

Protamine, a basic polypeptide, depresses the metabolic activity of Staphylococcus epidermidis in a standardized biofilm assay.

Rifampin produced predominant lysis and killing with foci of genetically programmed resistance. The combination of protamine with antibiotics produced no change, except the combination with rifampin where clear classic synergism with a totally bactericidal outcome was demonstrated. Protamine is a member of the larger family of charged polycations, some of which possess membrane potential altering properties, possibly interfering with the protective nature exhibited by the negatively charged bacterial biofilm matrix.\r"

Such treated pericardium calcified significantly less (13 +/- 4 micrograms/mg dry weight) than did conventionally processed pericardium (114 +/- 25 micrograms/mg) after 63 days of subcutaneous implantation in rats. To test the ability for spontaneous in vivo endothelialization, 5 sheep had 6 mm grafts made from postfixation treated pericardium (PTP) implanted into the carotid artery, compared to PTFE grafts on the contralateral side, which spontaneously endothelialize in animal models. In a pregnant animal, both grafts occluded. All remaining pericardial grafts remained patent, but one additional PTFE graft occluded and another one was stenosed. The area covered with red thrombus was significantly smaller in the PTP grafts (3.05 +/- 3.9%) than in the PTFE grafts 42 +/- 14% (p = 0.0036); TEM and SEM showed endothelial cells growing directly on the PTP, but only on myofibroblasts in PTFE grafts.

Both the ultrafine polyester mesh, and the collagen cross-linked with a hydrophilic reagent, have a special affinity for host cells. In the current study, the focus was on neointima formation on the CUFP, compared with that on glutaraldehyde-treated equine pericardium (GA graft), over longer time periods. Twenty-one CUFPs, and 19 GA grafts as controls, were implanted as patches in the right ventricular outflow tract in 40 dogs. In the CUFP at 28 days, a thin neointima, which was almost endothelialized, had been formed. Fibroblasts and vasa vasorum were seen inside both the neointima and the graft wall. The CUFP showed a white, shiny, smooth, thin, and uniform neointima with endothilialization at 486 days, and the neointima was firmly anchored by day 699. In the GA graft at 484 days, however, the neointima was partly detached from the GA graft and almost no fibroblasts had infiltrated the graft wall. Therefore, neointimal formation on the CUFP is almost completed within 1 month and maintained over the long term.\r"

Oxymercuration/demercuration or hydroboration reactions can be used. SEM reveals film surfaces are smooth, uniform, and featureless. ATR/FTIR spectra and advancing/receding water contact angle measurements confirm the presence of surface OH groups and suggest the presence of surface acyl groups. Albumin adsorption and retention are markedly enhanced for surface OH and C16 concentrations as low as 5% reaction yield. Kinetics, isotherm, and competitive albumin/fibrinogen adsorption studies suggest that surface hydroxylation, and perhaps C16 acylation as well, markedly improve the albumin affinity, but not the fibrinogen affinity, of this material. The SR film can be durably coated on several materials, making it possible to favorably treat many blood-contacting devices, using a simple immersion process.\r"

Little is known concerning endotoxin transfer from dialysate to blood by diffusion. The present paper describes technical determination of diffusive and convective clearances for endotoxins based on conventional mass and momentum transfer models. Fractional diffusive transport of endotoxins with molecular weights of 1,000 and 10,000 daltons approximated unity. This indicates that clean-up of contaminated dialysate is necessary for safe hemodialysis treatment with highly permeable dialysis membranes. Diffusive in-flow of endotoxin with a molecular weight of 1,000 was calculated to be 278 and 88 pg/min for PAN-12CX2 and MC0.8H at an endotoxin concentration of inflowing dialysate of 2 pg/ml. These results demonstrate that dialysate should be carefully cleaned to prevent diffusive inflow of endotoxins from dialysate to blood.\r"

Cuprophan induces the most profound leukopenia, and also induces the most pronounced leukocytosis. For treatments with a given membrane there was, however, no correlation between leukopenia and leukocytosis. Leukopenia was independent of blood flow, while leukocytosis was strongly influenced by this factor. These observations indicate that different factors cause leukopenia and leukocytosis. Although a larger area induced more leukopenia, the effect was small. Membrane area had no effect on leukocytosis. There were no acute clinical side effects during dialysis that could be related to the leukocyte overshoot. The cause and chronic clinical consequences of leukocyte overshoot are unknown.\r"

Therefore, we introduced ultrafiltration of dialysis fluid before entering the dialyzer. Fifteen patients, (ten women, five men) were treated for 4 weeks with nonsterile, and then with sterile dialysis fluid. The bacterial loading in the dialysis fluid before hemodialysis was 1.34 X 10(5)/ml, and after hemodialysis 2.9 X 10(3)/ml; the endotoxin concentration was high and varied between less than 1 EU/ml and greater than 10 EU/ml before and after hemodialysis. After ultrafiltration of the dialysis fluid by a polyamide hollow fiber membrane, all samples were free of bacteria and the concentration of endotoxin was lower than the detectable limit (less than 0.03 and less than 0.5 EU/ml). With ultrafiltration of dialysis fluid we can obtain sterile dialysate, which is endotoxin free. Interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor in the patients with ultrafiltration was significantly lower than without ultrafiltration.\r"

To examine this possibility, residual blood volumes were determined following 95 treatments with dialyzers containing Hemophan membranes in 11 patients. No heparin was added to the saline used to prime the dialyzers. The anticoagulant effect of heparin was measured using recalcified activated clotting times (RACT). Two heparin doses, calculated by a pharmacokinetic model to increase baseline RACT by 12.5% and 25%, were used for each patient. The mean heparin loading doses were 10.2 +/- 2.8 and 15.3 +/- 2.2 IU/kg, respectively, and the mean infusion rates were 11.1 +/- 3.2 and 14.7 +/- 3.2 IU/kg/h, respectively. Residual blood volumes were determined by red cell lysis and hemoglobinometry. In 88 treatments, residual blood volume averaged 1.6 +/- 1.5 ml. In the other seven treatments, residual blood volume greater than 10 ml was seen. In five of these cases, clotting appeared to propagate from the arterial drip chamber. Residual blood volume did not correlate with the level of heparin. The data show that low-dose heparin can be used with Hemophan membranes, and suggest that blood tubing design may be an important factor in blood circuit clotting during hemodialysis.\r"

  ".W": "Electrolytes undergo electrostatic resistances in reaching membrane surfaces and passing through membrane pores when weakly charged dialysis membranes are used in hemodialysis treatments. Diffusive permeability to an electrolyte of weakly charged dialysis membranes depends upon the effective charge density of the membranes, which varies with ionic strength. The authors carried out dialysis experiments at a temperature of 310 K, with 32P-Na2HPO4 in aqueous NaCl and bovine serum, to obtain diffusive permeability to an inorganic phosphate ion of regenerated cellulose, and polymethylmethacrylate membranes of various fixed charge densities at varying ionic strengths ranging from 1.66 to 100 mol/m3. Diffusive permeability to an inorganic phosphate ion increased with ionic strength. Bovine serum, having an ionic strength of approximately 150 mol/m3, gave higher diffusive permeability to an inorganic phosphate ion. The internal structure of dialysis membranes, such as pore size, surface porosity, and tortuosity, also affects diffusive permeability. The electrolyte diffusion theory gives an effective charge density of -5.3 mol/m3 for the cellulosic membrane. In conclusion, ionic strength enhances diffusive permeability to an inorganic phosphate ion in both aqueous NaCl and bovine serum. Inorganic phosphate ion transport through negatively charged dialysis membranes depends upon the degree of dissociation of inorganic phosphate, the molecular size and valence of hydrated inorganic phosphate ion, the effective charge density and internal structure of the membrane, and ionic strength.\r"

These symptoms were: 1) \"angina,\" resistant to O2 and nitrates, with biochemical stigmata of infarction, but without electrocardiogram (ECG) localization; 2) intractable persistent hypotension, not hypovolemic, lasting 1 or 2 days; 3) esophagal spasms, with inability to swallow solid food. Because we knew that these symptoms were compatible with hemolysis (biochemically proven by the increase in serum LDH during dialysis and by a fall in haptoglobin) due to red cell fragmentation (RCF), we switched these patients from fistula dialysis (A) to central catheter dialysis (B), with the same apperture, blood flow, etc. The total number of sessions of A versus B were 512 and 891; the mean LDH ratios (serum LDH postdialysis divided by predialysis) were 1.8 and 1.0 (= no RCF); angina events were 132 (26%) for A, and 25 (3%) for B; persistent hypotension was seen 37 (7%) times in A and 5 (0.6%) times in B; esophagal spasms were noted 65 (13%) times for A, and 0 times for B. This clinical improvement was so overwhelming that 3 patients refused to be dialyzed again using their well functioning fistulae. This study also proved the need for a better designed and manufactured peripheral dialysis catheter-needle.\r"

Whole vessel static testing of circumferential compliance (8.9 +/- 1 [SEM] X 10(-2)% mmHg at 100 mmHg) revealed behavior virtually identical to the paired natural vessel from which each AMVP was derived in nine canine carotid arteries. We implanted 16 canine-origin AMVPs into nine dogs (12 femoral and three carotid arteries, and one infrarenal aorta) with no antithrombotic drugs. Angiographic patency was maintained in 15 of 16 (one occlusion within 3 days) for follow-up from 3 days to 6 years, with no aneurysm formation in three AMVP at over 4 1/2 years. Explant analysis revealed preservation of AMVP elastica and collagen with no inflammation or dystropic calcification of the AMVP, and almost total thrombus free flow surfaces. These results suggest that allograft AMVPs could achieve long-term patency equivalent to saphenous veins.\r"

However, the native vein is pliable without any stiffness. We developed a soft and pliable graft that can maintain patency of the lumen because of its compliance. Fresh porcine ureter was incubated in a ficin solution to remove cell components and noncollagenous proteins. One percent protamine sulfate solution was injected into the ureter lumen to impregnate the inner surface. The ureter was then crosslinked with a 1% glutaraldehyde solution, dipped into a 1% heparin solution for 5 hours, and rinsed with distilled water. This procedure made the ureter very soft and pliable, and also conferred antithrombogenicity to the graft by heparinization. The grafts were implanted into the posterior vena cavae of 20 dogs and were removed from 1 to 878 days after implantation. Eighteen grafts were patent, but two grafts were occluded at the anastomotic site at 218 and 107 days, respectively. As a control experiment, nonheparinized grafts were implanted into 15 dogs; all were occluded with fresh thrombi. All the patent grafts kept their original elasticity, which allowed them to heave in unison with the heartbeat, and were similar in appearance to the native vena cava. Heparinization was effective in preventing thrombus formation. These results indicate that this type of graft is an ideal prosthesis as a venous graft, having physiologic properties such as compliance and antithrombogenicity.\r"

  ".W": "A method to accelerate the endothelialization of vascular prostheses by seeding venous tissue fragments was developed. A piece of peripheral vein was obtained, chopped into small fragments, and stirred into 20 ml of saline, making a tissue suspension. This suspension was sieved through the wall of a highly porous vascular prosthesis (water porosity: 3,600-4,000). The prostheses, (7 mm ID and 5.7 cm in length) seeded with tissue fragments, were implanted into the thoracic descending aortae of 20 dogs, and were removed from 1 to 371 days after implantation. Ten prostheses, preclotted with fresh blood, were used as controls. In the seeded grafts, an infinite number of endothelial cells migrated and proliferated from the fragments. These had produced numerous capillaries by 5 days after implantation that had reached and opened onto the luminal surface of the prosthesis. From these openings, numerous endothelial cells spread out and formed colonies. With the increase in the size of the colonies, the inner surface was completely endothelialized within 5 weeks. This quick neointimal formation by seeding venous tissue fragments might be applicable to several artificial organs.\r"

  ".W": "The percutaneous placement of intravascular devices creates a portal for microbial invasion that can result in local infections or septicemia. In nature, resistance to \"exist site\" infection in percutaneous organs, such as teeth, is prevented by a dense collagen/epithelial barrier. A new percutaneous access device has been developed that incorporates a porous polyurethane \"button\" at the subdermal level. This device promotes the development of a collagen/epithelial interface, thus inhibiting sinus formation. Twelve percutaneous access devices (PCADS) were implanted in calves; eight devices were utilized for venting of, and hard wire passage to, an implantable left ventricular assist device (LVAD) and served as controls. Four devices were utilized for long-term vascular access. The PCADS remained in situ for 2-127 days (mean 70). Excellent healing was apparent in all cases, and no exit site or catheter related infections occurred. Histologic examination demonstrated fibroblastic in-growth and collagen deposition within the porous polyurethane, which provides a barrier to epithelial migration and firmly anchors the device. These PCADS appear to reduce exit site infections and may improve upon currently available long-term vascular access catheters.\r"

  ".U": "91069688\r", 
  ".W": "From March 1978 through July 1985, 23 patients underwent implantation of 24 intraluminal ringed prostheses (IRP). There were 18 men and 5 women, with a mean age of 54.7 years, range 15-74 years. Eleven IRP were placed in the ascending aorta, two in the transverse arch, and 11 in the descending aorta. Pathology included acute aortic dissection in four patients, chronic dissection in four, and aortic aneurysm in 16. There were eight hospital deaths (35%). Causes of death included acute cardiac failure in seven patients, and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm in one. IRP complications requiring revision included right coronary artery occlusion in three of 11 patients (27%) with an IRP in the ascending aorta. Graft revision was also required in three of 11 IRP implanted in the descending aorta (27%), due to graft occlusion in one and graft stenosis in two. Of the six patients with IRP complications, there were three hospital deaths (50%). All 15 hospital survivors were followed for a mean of 68.5 months, range 5-112 months. There were four late deaths (26.7%). Causes of late death included hemoptysis in one, cardiomyopathy in one, and aortic redissection and rupture in two. We conclude that patients undergoing repair of aortic pathology with IRP have an important risk of early phase events, as technical problems can occur due to malposition and slippage of the securing rings.\r"

A catheter tip valve design is presented (Buchwald-Wigness, Strato Medical Corporation, Beverly, MA) which incorporates features designed to decrease the risk of thromboembolism and reduce the need for maintenance procedures. Aspiration and infusion are controlled by separate valves, making it possible to engineer optimized inlet and outlet parameters. The outlet valve is an elastic sleeve expanded around the sidewall outlet ports which opens under injection pressure. The inlet valve is a tubular elastic element compressed against the inlet port from within the lumen, opening under aspiration pressure. A series of valves were prototyped with outlet pressures ranging from 2 to 100\" H2O, and inlet pressures ranging from -40-70\" H2O, and flowrates at 36\" H2O of greater than 1,400 ml/hr. Dog implants of two prototypes with outlet valve pressures of 10\" H2O, and inlet pressures of -40\" H2O, demonstrated that dormant periods of up to 7.5 weeks could be achieved without detectable blood cell entry into the lumen. No significant hemolysis was observed in blood samples aspirated with a 6 cc syringe (8% scored \"slightly hemolyzed\" vs. 44% with the nonvalved controls) indicating that a hemodialysis application is likely.\r"

The model requires precise continuous measurement of Na flux in the dialysate stream, and a device to accomplish this (Ionflow) was developed and evaluated. In vivo studies showed that changes in body content of Na agreed to +/- 40 mEq, with total Na flux measured by Ionoflow. This agreement is excellent, considering that +/- 1 mEq/L in blood Na represents approximately 40 mEq in the average patient. The Ionoflow is considered accurate to +/- 10 to 20 mEq Na over a dialysis. The Ionoflow fulfills monitoring requirements necessary to implement clinical trials of closed loop Na modeling.\r"

Accuracy was compared in a database of 339 3/week modeling sessions in 256 patients. The standard of comparison was Kt/V obtained by 3 point variable volume single pool modeling, using K values estimated from KoA, Qb, Qd, and UF rate. The most accurate formula was Kt/V-LN, which correlated with Kt/V to a high degree (0.994), and with a [%ERROR] of only 2.2 +/- 1.7 (SD). There was no correlation of %ERROR with the modeled Kt/V. The least accurate formula was Kt/V-PRU. Although the correlation of Kt/V-PRU with modeled Kt/V was high (0.962), the [%ERROR] was 12.0 +/- 11, and %ERROR correlated significantly with modeled Kt/V (0.68). The Kt/V-PRUopt showed a high correlation with modeled Kt/V (0.962), and a [%ERROR] of 5.0 +/- 3.8; the latter had a minimal correlation with modeled Kt/V (-0.168). The relative accuracies of the three formulae were: Kt/V-LN vs. Kt/V-PRU = 5.98, Kt/V-LN vs. Kt/V-PRUopt = 2.45. The results suggest that Kt/V-LN is a more accurate estimate of Kt/V than any formula based on PRU alone.\r"

Various formulas have been derived to make calculation of Kt/V simpler. We compared the kinetically measured Kt/V (A) to estimated Kt/V derived from approximate total body water (0.6 body weight) and uniform dialyzer clearance (B), Kt/V = 0.04 PRU-1.2 where PRU is % reduction in BUN (C) and Kt/V = In(R-0.03-UF/W) where R is post/pre BUN, UF is ultrafiltration L/HD and W is postdialysis weight (D) in 26 patients. The correlation coefficient (r) was 0.14 (p less than 0.05) for A vs. B; 0.75 (p less than 0.01) A vs. C; 0.77 (p less than 0.01) A vs. D; and 0.97 for C vs. D. In an additional 51 patients, Kt/V was calculated using formulas B, C, and D. The r was 0.91 C vs. D, 0.70 B vs. D, and 0.68 B vs. C. With B, greater than 30% of the patients could have been misclassified using NCDS criteria for adequacy of dialysis. The study suggests that use of formulas C and D, but not B, is appropriate and accurate for Kt/V calculation. Formula C may be simpler and easier than D, as UF and W are not required. Serial Kt/V could be easily and accurately calculated using C and D for quality assurance and quantitation of dialysis.\r"

Values were compared with those seen in the plasma or with peripheral blood monocytes of 30 hemodialysis (HD) patients (10 treated with Cuprophan [CU]; 10 with Polyacrylonitrile [PAN]; and 10 with Cellulose Acetate [CA]). Results showed that in CAPD patients with bacterial peritonitis B2M, IL-1 and LTB4 concentrations in the PDE were significantly higher than those seen in CAPD patients without peritonitis, or in the plasma of HD patients treated with PAN or CA, but were similar to those seen in HD patients treated with CU. At the same time, in vitro PM from CAPD patients with bacterial peritonitis produced more B2M, IL-1, and LTB4, than did PM from CAPD patients without peritonitis, or peripheral blood monocytes from HD patients treated with PAN or CA. The authors conclude that in CAPD patients, bacterial peritonitis is able to induce PM B2M production, probably via a cytokine mediated process, which may be analogous to what occurs with peripheral blood monocytes of HD patients treated with CU.\r"

  ".W": "A muscle powered cardiac assist device (MCAD) for right ventricular support requires optimized diastolic filling to obtain full stroke and acceptable fluid dynamics. A valved and spring-assembled skeletal muscle ventricle (SMV) was designed as a prototype MCAD, regardless of fluid dynamics. The present study addresses the optimal bypass method for right ventricular support, and predicts the future design for an implantable MCAD. Latissimus dorsi muscle (LDM) of 11 dogs were conditioned electrically for a one year maximum, and transformed into fatigue-resistant muscles (Type I fibers). Superior and inferior vena cavae were anastomosed using one arm of a Y-shaped vascular graft, as an inflow conduit, and the outflow conduit was placed on the main pulmonary artery. SMV was wrapped with transformed LDM and the bypass method was varied by SVC and/or IVC ligation. SMV demonstrated sufficient right ventricular support on total bypass (70% compared with control output), and the maximum pump off-to-on flow ratio (200%) was obtained. Maximum SMV power output was 0.27 X 10(6) erg, which was equivalent to that of canine right ventricle. Right atrial-to-pulmonary artery bypass was also constructed by using SMV in another 14 dogs, and also showed that total bypass was preferable for optimal SMV diastolic filling. In conclusion, specific requirements for a future MCAD include a subsystem assembly such as a spring, magnet, or alternative auxiliary muscle pump assembly for MCAD filling, and total bypass with optimized fluid dynamics and anatomic fitting.\r"

This device will be useful in situations where biventricular failure has been partially treated by placement of a left ventricular assist device, or when right ventricular failure occurs in isolation. This pneumatically actuated, R-wave synchronized, sac type pump contains no valves, and is connected by a graft to the pulmonary artery. The RVAD was tested in a circulation simulator to verify its hemodynamic efficacy and then implanted in six calves for 2-4 weeks to evaluate its biocompatibility. In vitro testing of the RVAD demonstrated that it restored normal hemodynamics in the presence of severe simulated RVF. In six animal implantations, a small amount of thrombus was found in one pump. No anticoagulants were employed. Thrombus was present in the connecting graft in three animals; in two this was clearly related to technical implant errors. No evidence of significant hemolysis was found. This simple RVAD has been found to be hemodynamically effective, is simple to use, and is well tolerated. Refinements in the interconnection graft between the pulmonary artery and the device are necessary.\r"

It can be demonstrated that in cases of a normally beating heart, this BVAD decompresses both ventricles by 60-70%, while the aortic pressure is slightly increased; on the other hand, in case of ventricular fibrillation, the BVAD with two spindle pumps maintained the entire circulation, at an arterial pressure between 80 and 90 mmHg with a flow volume between 3.5 and 4 L/min.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the feasibility of using skeletal muscle (SM) to provide pulmonary artery (PA) counterpulsation in an acute pulmonary hypertension (PHT) model. PA counterpulsation was achieved in six dogs with a dual chambered pump powered by the latissimus dorsi muscle. A rate-responsive stimulator was used to make the muscle contract in counterpulsation. Graded PHT was induced by infusing 150 microns glass beads into the PA, while RV and PA pressures were monitored. With PA pressures ranging from 19/10 to 115/62 mmHg, effective counterpulsation was observed. The degree of counterpulsation was influenced by the extent of PHT induced, with the amount of RV tension-time index (TTI) unloading correlated with the level of PA systole (r = 0.92). Therefore, results were divided into two groups (Group 1: PA systole less than or equal to 40 mmHg, and Group 2: PA systole greater than 40 mmHg). In Group 1, RV TTI decreased from 11.29 +/- 0.76 to 9.99 +/- 0.72 mmHg.sec, PA diastole increased from 20 +/- 2.3 to 31 +/- 3.0 mmHg, and PA mean increased from 24 +/- 2.2 to 2.9 +/- 2.2 mmHg (all p less than 0.05). In Group 2, RV TT1 decreased from 15.12 +/- 1.83 to 10.99 +/- 0.90 mmHg.sec, PA diastole increased from 41 +/- 3.5 to 64 +/- 6.2 mmHg, and PA mean increased from 49 +/- 4.8 to 55 +/- 5.7 mmHg (all p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Endurance testing was initiated on eight systems before testing was halted due to failure of four of the systems. Three failed due to environmental leakage. Solutions were straightforward, involving gasket changes and o-ring resizing. The fourth failure involved a magnetic coupling piston swelling and seizing. The failure was attributed, after long investigation, to hydrogen adsorption by the samarium-cobalt magnets. An unknown number of coupling magnets were affected in this fashion, necessitating complete replacement of magnets to resolve the problem. However, this was beyond the scope of the program, and no further endurance testing was accomplished. The test experience of the Nimbus/CCF LVAS has demonstrated all functional aspects of the complete LVAS, both in vitro and in vivo, and the endurance and reliability potential is indicated as well. Although the LVAS program is currently inactive, its legacy of technical innovations continue to drive the development of other medical devices.\r"

After completion of the preparation, ventricular fibrillation was induced. The devices were synchronized to pump simultaneously at a rate of 85-100 bpm. The combined use of the counterpulsation devices provided maximal aortic pressure of 111.4 +/- 25.1 mmHg during ventricular fibrillation for a period of 15-60 min. The mean left ventricular pressure was 17.7 +/- 4.4 mmHg, and the cardiac index 64.5 +/- 23.6 ml/kg/min. Cardioversion of ventricular fibrillation to sinus rhythm restored normal hemodynamics. The counterpulsation device implanted on the ascending aorta was not able to maintain circulation for more than 5 min after the induction of ventricular fibrillation, if used alone. In conclusion, the use of two counterpulsation devices implanted on the ascending aorta and pulmonary artery was able to maintain circulation in experimental animals during ventricular fibrillation.\r"

There were 18 sheep, of which nine each served as the control and RVAD groups. Hemodynamic parameters and blood samples were collected from the coronary sinus. Area at risk and area of infarct were detected by gentian violet injection and triphenyltetrazolium (TTC) staining. Hemodynamic parameters (left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), cardiac output (CO], and creatine kinase levels in coronary sinus blood tended to be beneficial, to some degree, in the RVAD group. Electron microscopic examination revealed chromatin clumping and mitochondrial destruction, however this ultrastructural damage was more severe in the control group. The ratio of area of infarct to area at risk in the RVAD group was significantly less than that in the control group, being 20.25 +/- 6.93% vs. 47.24 +/- 10.53% (p less than 0.05). The infarct size induced by RCA occlusion was significantly reduced by the RVAD, due to the right ventricular unloading via reduced myocardial oxygen demand.\r"

A novel mechanical cardiac assist device (MCAD), that has advantages over a conventional intraaortic balloon pump and left ventricular assist devices, has been developed. It consists of a high efficiency rotary solenoid, coupled to a pair of actuator plates that clamp on a shunt aortic graft section, and operates in a diastolic counterpulsation mode. The system has been evaluated in six anesthetized, thoracotomized dogs with myocardial ischemia. The MCAD was activated 30-40 min after coronary artery occlusion and synchronized with the R-wave. As illustrated by a representative sample of the data obtained from one of several trials, the preliminary experimental results demonstrated that the MCAD worked effectively to fulfill the primary functions of a counterpulsation assist device, i.e., augmentation of coronary perfusion and reduction in the vascular impedance to ventricular ejection.\r"

The post-transition moduli for both basal and marginal chordae are greater than the pretransition values by a factor of approximately 10. In addition, the stress carried by the marginal chordae is higher than that supported by the basal ones at all recorded strains, indicating the marginal chordae are stiffer than the basal chordae. The authors determined the number and distribution of chordal insertions, and found a marginal to basal insertion ratio of almost 2 to 1. The implication is that it may be possible surgically to remove basal chordae without seriously compromising mitral valve function.\r"

This study was designed to assess the long-term anticalcification efficacy of GPBP AI3+ preincubation. Rat (50-60 gm, male, CD Sprague-Dawley) subdermal implants of GPBP, pretreated with 0.01 M or 0.1 M AICI3, were carried out for 21, 60, 90, and 120 days. Each explanted GPBP was analyzed for Ca2+ by atomic absorption spectroscopy and for AI3+ by atomic absorption spectroscopy or neutron activation irradiation. Results showed profound long-term (implant duration 120 days) inhibition of calcification after GPBP preincubation in 0.1 M AICI3 (Ca2+ = 21.8 +/- 12.6 micrograms/mg), compared to control (Ca2+ = 329.0 +/- 20.3 micrograms/mg). After preincubation in 0.1 M AICI3 and 21 day rat subdermal implantation, GPBP AI3+ levels declined from 9033 +/- 680 micrograms/g (control = 6.3 +/- 3.7 micrograms/g) to 2700 +/- 156 micrograms/g; however, there was no further significant decline in GPBP AI3+ levels after long-term implantation of 120 days (2618.4 +/- 349 micrograms/g). The authors conclude that GPBP preincubation in 0.1 M AICI3 markedly inhibited pathologic calcification to 7% of control values in the rat model after long-term (120 day) subdermal implantation.\r"

Aortic valves harvested from dogs were treated with PC (PC valve). Right ventricle (RV)-pulmonary artery (PA) bypasses were placed in 12 dogs with PC-valved conduits, and the main PA was ligated. X-ray right ventriculography at 36 days (1 dog) and 37 days (1 dog) revealed an excellent open/close performance of the PC valve, and there was no visible thrombus in the valve. In our basic study, PC treated collagen gel disks implanted in the subcutaneous layer of growing rats showed remarkably less calcium deposition than did those treated with glutaraldehyde (GA). Biologic materials cross-linked with PC maintain their pliability, and become more hydrophilic and more hydrated than those cross-linked with GA. The hydrophilicity and hydration provide sufficient antithrombogenicity and a suitable environment for metabolism in the tissue fluid which contains oxygen, nutritive substances, and electrolytes, leading to inhibition of material degeneration. Therefore, PC valves are expected to show good valve function, sufficient antithrombogenicity, and excellent durability with less calcification, when compared to GA treated valves.\r"

Non-biologic components showed changes which may have affected prosthesis function. The synthetic material covering the metal/plastic frame showed interstitial mononuclear cells. Two of the three explanted valves showed changes in the polymeric plastic, and one in the metal components, including accentuated notching along the surfaces when compared to unimplanted prostheses. A larger number of prostheses must be examined before definite conclusions can be drawn.\r"

Because of durability concerns, it was replaced by the expensive Pyrolytic Carbon (PC) in numerous cardiac valves. However, the durability problem could be related to design rather than poor materials selection. Recent reports on brittle fracture of PC, leading to sudden deaths, have prompted a critical comparison between DR and PC in the St. Vincents Mechanical (SVM) heart valves. Three SVM-DR and SVM-PC valves were subjected to accelerated life cycle tests, and examined for wear at 400 million cycles. These results were compared to those of Bjork-Shiley Delrin (BS-DR) valves. Wear in BS-DR valves in vivo for more than 17 years were also analyzed and compared. Using a linear (wear depth)-log (cycles) plot, wear rates in mm/log (million cycles) were obtained. The results showed that the wear rates for DR and PC in SVM valves are close. The double reduction in wear rate of the SVM-DR, compared to BS-DR, is probably due to the lower contact stresses of the SVM valves. SVM-DR in vivo should, therefore, have lower wear. The PC discs also showed edge chipping and hairline cracks. The authors conclude that the durability of DR can be improved by design and, since it is more impact resistant than PC, it is a safer, more inexpensive occluder material for cardiac valves.\r"

A Bjork-Shiley monostrut valve with an 18 mm disk was modified so that permanent magnetic material was implanted in the disk and an electromagnet was fitted around the ring of the valve. The opening of the disk is controlled by the interaction of the magnetic field created by the permanent magnets, and the field created by the electromagnet. The coil can be activated intermittently so that the valve can be held in the closed position or allowed to open and close unimpeded. The unit was designed to hold a maximum hydrostatic pressure equivalent to 50 mmHg. Power consumption by the prototype, while holding a pressure of 50 mmHg, is less than 10 watts. The overall diameter of the valve and electromagnet is 27 mm. The design and test results indicate that it is feasible to develop a unit suitable for chronic implantation in experimental animals and, possibly, in prosthetic blood pumping devices.\r"

This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of PEMF on metabolically derived osteoporosis in rats. Sixteen 5 month old female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups (G-1,2,3). G-1 was given a normal diet and no exposure to PEMF; G-2,3 were oophrectomized and fed a low calcium diet for 8 months; and G-3 was also exposed for 24 hr/day to PEMF generated by applying a 15 Hz, 5.6 A peak to peak square wave to Helmholtz coils (64 cm I.D., 200 turns/coil). The rats were sacrificed at 4, 6, and 8 months. Skeletal changes were analyzed by measurements of acid extracted bone calcium and bone mineral content (BMC) using single photon absorptiometry (SPA). Although all animals started at approximately the same weight (mean of 290.0 g), G-2 showed a more progressive increase. While the mean weight after 8 months in G-1 was 350.0 g, and 352.5 g for G-3, that in G-2 was 400.0 g. The calcium content of the femur in G-2 and G-3 at 8 months was lower than that of G-1, but there were no significant differences among the three groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

No study, however, has yet determined how NMP excitability correlates with that of normal muscle or nerve. In six anesthetized dogs, one hemilarynx was denervated and the paralyzed thyroarytenoid, cricothyroid, and posterior cricoarytenoid muscles were reinnervated via NMPs originating from the ansa hypoglossi nerve. After 4.6 to 5.7 months, an electric stimulator delivering biphasic pulses of variable amplitude and widths was used to test thresholds for contraction in nine stimulatable NMPs, six intact recurrent laryngeal nerves (RLN), and five normal cervical muscles. With one exception (2.1 mA), NMP rheobases varied between 0.0002 and 0.04 mA (mean = 0.020 SD +/- 0.012, n = 6). Two NMPs belonging to animals stimulated for several hours had higher values (0.1 mA). Rheobase varied from 0.01 to 0.09 mA for control RLNs (mean = 0.058 SD +/- 0.025), and from 0.05 to 0.35 mA for muscles (mean = 0.144 SD +/- 0.109). Histologic correspondence with reinnervation was established in implanted muscles by type grouping on ATPase stains. These data suggest that 1) nerve pedicles may offer promise for the eventual construction of implantable low energy consuming laryngeal devices, and 2) the appropriate charge to be injected over time remains to be determined.\r"

The authors' prosthesis is a silicone tube coated with freeze dried collagen sponge. Cells infiltrate this collagen layer and synthesize new tissue, which will become the neoesophagus. The silicone tube imparts rigidity to the prosthesis and prevents infection, leakage, and dislocation of the prosthesis at the anastomotic site. After formation of the epithelized neoesophageal lumen, the silicone tube drops into the stomach as the result of peristalsis in response to food. Eventually, no artificial prosthesis remains in place, and the defect is replaced by ingrowing tissue. This process was shortened by mucosal cell seeding. Before replacement, the authors harvested oral mucosal (OM) cells, cultured them for 10 days, and seeded them in the collagen layer of the prosthesis just after anastomosis. The neo-esophageal lumen was formed 1 week after the operation without any local complications, infection, leakage, or stenosis, and 2 weeks later the firm, epithelized neoesophagus was completed. OM cell seeding accelerated not only epithelization, but also regeneration of mesenchymal tissue. Parallel with this, transmission electron microscopy showed that most of the cells in the neoesophagus exhibited large nuclei and prominent rough endoplasmic reticulum, indicative of active collagen production.\r"

This is not possible with the currently available impermeable solid silicone tube. The authors developed a reinforced, porous polyurethane tubular prosthesis which has the potential for complete incorporation. However, because these prostheses are implanted in a contamined area such as the airway, they all become infected. In order to prevent infection, the authors evaluated the effect of omental wrapping in guinea pigs. The authors' tubular prosthesis was implanted subcutaneously in the abdominal area with the ends open to the air. Ten prostheses were wrapped with omentum and 10 prostheses were not. In 4 weeks, all control prostheses were infected and marsupialized. All the wrapped prostheses remained in place and were macroscopically not infected. Microscopically, all wrapped prostheses were well vascularized and were incorporated by granulation tissue, which did not occur in the prostheses of the control group. From these results the authors conclude that omental wrapping would be an effective way to prevent infection of porous tracheal prostheses in an open-to-the-air situation, and allow rapid tissue ingrowth and incorporation in the host.\r"

Because new membranes that remove low molecular weight proteins, such as beta 2-microglobulin by diffusion are now available for clinical use, both back filtration and back diffusion become problems. This paper gives the mass transfer rate of solutes from the dialysate to blood compartment. As markers of toxic or antigenic substances, inulin (MW 5,200), lysozyme (MW 14,300), and alpha-lactoalbumin (MW 14,400) were used. The dialyzers tested were the CLSU-12W, AM-FP10, BK-1.0P, and FB-110U. The UFR controller set the flow rate on the blood side at 200, dialysate at 500, and ultrafiltration (QF) as 0 to 50 ml/min. Under these conditions, the inulin back clearance is 16 (CLSU) to 26 ml/min (FB), even if the QF is 50 ml/min, and is 10 to 34 ml/min for lysozyme at QF = 0 ml/min. Although a substantial amount of solute moves into the blood compartment, back clearance does not drastically decrease with increase in QF. To avoid contamination of the blood side, clean-up techniques for the dialysis line or online protein adsorber should be followed.\r"

Model simulations indicate that under otherwise identical conditions typical of high flux dialysis, an increase in hematocrit from 20 to 33% will increase the amount of dialysate fluid entering the blood from 2.4 L to 3.8 L in a 4 hr treatment. We used the mathematical model to investigate the effect of the following variables on backfiltration: blood flow rate, ultrafiltration rate, inside fiber diameter, fiber length, and membrane permeability. While increasing the blood flow rate may enhance solute transport, it was found to increase backfiltration substantially through its effect on the axial pressure drop. This effect was most pronounced at the higher hematocrits due to the higher viscosity. It was found that increasing the fiber ID, decreasing the fiber length, and decreasing the permeability of the membrane (all at constant surface area) could be beneficial in reducing backfiltration. However, these results do not consider the potential negative impact of these changes on solute clearance. Finally, the mathematical model enhanced our understanding of the transport processes governing backfiltration. Due to protein concentration gradients in the lumen, protein osmotic pressures as high as 50-100 mmHg can be obtained in high-flux dialysis. As a result, providing an outlet hydrostatic blood pressure greater than the inlet hydrostatic dialysate pressure is not sufficient to guarantee the absence of backfiltration.\r"

Postoperatively, patients received vitamin D and calcium supplementation. Before PTX, a markedly elevated bone turnover was found, with increased fluxes of calcium from plasma into the exchangeable calcium pool. This pool was three times larger than normal, indicating a high risk of extraosseous calcifications. Despite a marked fall in parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels after PTX, bone cell activity was maintained, as indicated by elevated values for Ca retention. Although Ca efflux from plasma into other compartments of the exchangeable pools remained above normal, the size of the total exchangeable calcium pool markedly decreased after PTX, indicating that PTX with autotransplantation, followed by vitamin D therapy, can normalize bone turnover and shift the balance of calcium flux towards mineralized bone. Reduction in the exchangeable calcium pool may explain the clinical finding that extraosseous calcifications regress in some patients after PTX.\r"

  ".W": "Accurate measurement of blood flow during hemodialysis is essential to avoid underdialysis. When blood roller pumps are pushed to the high-flow rates demanded by high performance dialyzers, flow may be overestimated. This study examined the effect of inflow (Pa) and outflow (Pv) pressures induced by hemodialysis roller pumps on flow in vitro and in vivo. Blood flow was measured volumetrically, and with an ultrasonic flow probe, whereas Pa was adjusted from -50 to -400 torr and Pv from 50 to 300 torr. Only Pa influenced flow. At -200 torr, true flow measured volumetrically averaged 8.5% +/- 1.3% less than the blood pump revolutions per minute (RPM) meter reading. At -400 torr, the difference was 33.0% +/- 1.9%. There was no visible indication that flow was reduced to less than pump meter readings. Pv, hematocrit, and the source of pump tubing had no significant effect. Flow measured with an ultrasonic transit-time probe during routine hemodialysis in 64 patients was 9.0% +/- 2.7% less than pump meter readings when Pa varied from -180 to -220 torr. Blood pump meter readings greater than 400 ml/min were usually inaccurate because of low Pa. Prepump monitoring of arterial inflow pressure can prevent hidden reductions in blood flow that decrease dialysis efficiency.\r"

The water evaporation rate from the skin (reflecting the perspiration rate) was also monitored. Results showed a temporary elevation in CA levels in the ultrafiltrate before hypotension occurred. This rise did not continue for long, returning to baseline when hypotension actually occurred. The temporary elevation may reflect transient compensation by the sympathetic nervous system for the decrease in vascular wall tension. It was also found that there was considerable water evaporation from the skin during hypotension. Because sweat gland activity is reflexively modulated by the baroreceptor, perspiration after a drop in blood pressure may reflect the normal diminiution in baroreceptor activity.\r"

When metabolic acidosis was not corrected with CAVHD, a sterile BD was substituted for either acetate- or lactate-based dialysate. Pre- and post-BD substitution levels of lactate, HCO3, PCO2, anion gap, and pH were recorded, as well as dose of intravenous (i.v.) bicarbonate. Improvements in pH and serum HCO3 were seen in all seven cases. Anion gap decreased in all but one of the patients who were switched from lactate to bicarbonate dialysate, with improvement most marked in those patients with marked elevation of the anion gap. No adverse effect on PCO2 was noted. Lactate dialysate may be less effective when serum lactate levels are high, and may contribute to further elevation of lactate levels and anion gap. These data suggest that bicarbonate dialysate may be preferable to lactate or acetate dialysate in CAVHD patients with persistent metabolic acidosis.\r"

Twenty-four CAPD patients were evaluated in vivo (12 who had never had peritonitis, and 12 with an overall peritonitis incidence of more than one episode per 8 patient/months), for the effects of different peritoneal dialysis fluids (PDF) and Ca++ concentrations (1.25, 1.75, and 2.25 mmol/L) on PM0: cytoplasmic Ca++ concentration; superoxide generation; leukotriene B4 (LTB4) release; and bacterial killing for Staphylococcus epidermidis. The same parameters were also evaluated after adding 1,25(OH)2D3 (0.25 microgram/L) to the PDF. Results showed a direct correlation between the PDF Ca++ concentration and PM0 Ca++ levels, superoxide and LTB4 generation, and bacterial killing such that, with 2.25 mmol/L of Ca++, these values were significantly higher than those seen with 1.75 mmol/L. The addition of 1,25(OH)2D3 potentiated the Ca(++)-induced effects. On the other hand, with PDF Ca++ levels of 1,25 mmol/L, an inhibition of the aforementioned parameters was seen. However, this effect was reversed by the addition of 1,25(OH)2D3. These in vivo results confirm the importance of Ca++ and 1,25(OH)2D3 in PM0 antibacterial function in CAPD patients, and may be useful in determining the prophylaxis and therapy of peritonitis.\r"

Heart failure was characterized by left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) greater than 18 mmHg and systolic aortic pressure (SAP) in stage A: 116 mmHg greater than or equal to SAP greater than 70 mmHg; in stage B: 70 mmHg greater than or equal to SAP greater than 30 mmHg; and in stage C: SAP less than or equal to 30 mmHg. Both modalities of mechanical assistance produced significant salutary hemodynamic effects in stages A and B. No difference was observed in stage C. In conclusion, the combined use of PACD and IABP is more effective than the use of either of these devices alone. This modality of mechanical assistance may easily be applied in patients that cannot be weaned from extracorporeal circulation, and in whom IABP was unsuccessfully applied.\r"

We have built a new drive unit, VCT200, to apply ASD easily and automatically. After IABP insertion in the final weaning stage, this method drives the LVAS and IABP alternately, with electrocardiogram (ECG) synchronization. The pumping ratio of IABP increases while that of LVAS decreases according to recovery of natural heart function. In in vitro studies, ASD was effective when bypass flow (BF) was less than 50% of total flow (TF) (TF:BF + cardiac output [CO]), and its advantages increased under lower BF conditions. Mean aortic pressure (mAP) and CO increased 10 mmHg and 15%, respectively, with this method (IABP:LVAS = 1:1) when BF was 30% of TF. During in vivo studies, mAP increased 75.7 +/- 6.7 mmHg to 80.1 +/- 3.6 mmHg (p less than 0.001), and the CO increased from 3.1 +/- 0.5 L/min to 3.3 +/- 0.5 L/min (p less than 0.001), while the endocardial viability ratio (DPTI/TTI) increased 20-30%. This method was used in a 62-year-old man in which LVAS was applied after ventricular aneurysmectomy, BF was reduced from 2.2 L/min to 1.1 L/min by using ASD without any change in systemic perfusion. This reduction of BF could not be achieved with LVAS alone. From these data, this system could wean patients from LVAS and then switch to IABP smoothly, easily, and automatically, without hemodynamic instability.\r"

  ".W": "A right ventricular assist device (VAD) based on the principle of counterpulsation has been developed at our institution. The device is a valveless, pneumatically actuated, 40 cc, sac-type pump, with a single inlet-outlet port. For right ventricular support, the \"Uniport\" pump is anastamosed end-to-side to the pulmonary artery. In previous experimental trials, the device has been shown to impart minimal trauma to blood components. In this study, biventricular failure was induced in eight Holstein calves by normothermic ischemia during cardiopulmonary bypass. A Pierce-Donachy left VAD (LVAD) was used for left ventricular support following the ischemic insult. Hemodynamic measurements were obtained throughout the study, and each animal served as its own control. A significant increase in post injury cardiac output (33.5 +/- 11.4%) was obtained with use of the Uniport and LVAD, as compared to use of the LVAD alone (p less than or equal to 0.005). Other hemodynamic parameters of right heart failure, including right atrial pressure (RAP), pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), and left atrial pressure (LAP) were not significantly affected. These data suggest that the Uniport right ventricular assist device significantly improves cardiac output in this model of moderate right ventricular failure. Additional studies are required, however, to optimize pump stroke volume, and to further define the performance envelope of the device.\r"

The jet of oxygenated venous blood entrains blood inside the left ventricle and pumps into the aorta through the aortic valve. Jet velocity is kept below the hemolytic threshold of 1000 cm/sec. The device was placed in a mock circulatory system that stimulates the left ventricle and vascular system by generating a pressure wave (120/75 mmHg) with a 4 L/min cardiac output (CO). A bypass loop (from the venous reservoir to aorta using a Biomedicus pump, Biomedicus Inc., Eden Prairie, MN) was set up, and the jet pump was installed. When the jet pump is turned on, bypass flow rate (BF) is 2.5 L/min, entrainment pumping 1.5 L/min, and peak ventricular pressure (VP) falls below aortic pressure (AP), while maintaining the mean AP. Time tension index (TTI) is decreased 31%. This result, when compared with simple bypass at differing BF, shows more than a 20% reduction in TTI. This simple jet pump provided significant unloading of the left ventricle and may be potentially useful as a left ventricular assist device.\r"

  ".W": "Thromboembolization studies were performed on two calves supported by extracorporeal left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) using a light scattering (He Ne Laser) microemboli detector (LSMD). The LSMD system was placed on the outflow cannula of the LVAD in the extracorporeal loop of each animal. The measurements included the size, number, and rate of production of circulating microemboli in the range 20 microns less than microemboli diameter less than 1,000 microns. These data were compared to independently and concurrently obtained measurements of emboli shear rate (CPF), platelet count, red blood count (RBC), leukocyte count (WBC), plasma free hemoglobin, factors XIII, X, and V, and sorbitol dehydrogenase. Embolic number and volume were seen to be most dynamic in the very early phases of acute thromboembolization (0-40 minutes) with a peak embolic response within the first 30 minutes. The dynamics of reduced emboli volume, rather than number, may be implicated in the later stages of the thromboembolic passivation of these ventricles. The LSMD results generally showed an inverse correlation of microemboli volume rate with CPF measurements for each ventricle. LSMD, CPF, and leukocyte and platelet counts, showed a direct correlation with reduced counts for each additional ventricle for both calves. Factor XII was seen to have a more direct correlation in time with LSMD measurements for each ventricle than other parameters under investigation. This study represents the first time laser scattering and filtration methods have been applied simultaneously with hematologic assays in order to study the dynamics of device associated thrombogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of right ventricular (RVAD) and biventricular assist devices (BVAD) in an acute porcine model of right heart ischemic failure produced by occluding the right coronary artery for 2 min (RCAO) were compared. Right and left ventricular pressures were measured with Millar transducers and respective septal-to-free wall dimensions (RVSFWD, LVSFWD) with ultrasonic crystals. RCAO alone resulted in significant right heart failure, marked by a 36 +/- 5% reduction in cardiac output (pulmonary artery flow) and a 54 +/- 16% reduction in RV stroke work. Isolated RVAD significantly improved the hemodynamic conditions by restoring pulmonary blood flow and left heart filling to control levels. RVAD also resulted in reduced RVSFWD to control levels and increased LVSFWD via a rightward septal shift due to right heart unloading. Biventricular support resulted in the same hemodynamic improvement, but estimated LV peak systolic wall stress was reduced by 65 +/- 15% compared with control, due to concomitant LV unloading and reductions in LVSFWD. Therefore, either right or biventricular devices are effective in treating RV failure. The advantage of biventricular support is that the left ventricle is also unloaded, thus allowing improved circulatory support with minimal LV wall stress.\r"

  ".W": "This article describes two patients with artificial heart valves who suffered thromboembolytic complications during circulatory assistance using a Biomedicus centrifugal pump. The first case involved a 25-year-old man who presented acute blockage of a mechanical aortic valve. Emergency surgery was performed to replace this valve with a bioprosthesis. Postoperatively the patient developed severe left heart insufficiency and a Biomedicus centrifugal pump was placed between the left atrium and the ascending aorta. After 3 days of total left ventricular assistance, weaning was started and successfully completed with explanation on the 5th day. Two days later the patient died of multiple coronary embolism with thrombosis of the valve. The second case involved a 30-year-old man. Six months before, he underwent surgical procedure with placement of Bio-prosthesis for dissecting aortic aneurysm due to annuloectasia. Upon admission for terminal dilated myocardiopathy, the patient was in kidney failure almost requiring dialysis. Because of this patient's size (Marfan syndrome), no donor heart was immediately available and left circulatory assistance with a Biomedicus pump had to be initiated. The patient lived without mechanical ventilation, in good clinical condition until day 23 when he presented acute right heart failure due to extensive valvular and coronary thrombosis. From these two cases, several important comments can be made about anticoagulation therapy, partial unloading of left ventricle, or need for biventricular assistance, and efficiency of centrifugal devices in these clinical applications.\r"

  ".U": "91069742\r", 
  ".W": "The closing velocity of a mechanical heart valve (MHV) leaflet has been conventionally related to the valve sound, and possibly to recently observed MHV cavitation phenomenon. Presently, the MHV leaflet terminal closing velocity has been indirectly assessed either by listening to the valve sound and/or averaging over the closing period. Leaflet motion during the closing phase is not uniform. Using a laser sweeping technique developed in this laboratory, an experimental study was carried out to analyze the closing motion of Baxter Duromedic (DM) 29 mm mitral MHVs. The results were compared with that of a St. Jude Mechanical (SJ) 29 mm mitral MHV, using the same technique. The in vitro experiment was carried out by mounting the testing MHV at the mitral position of a mock circulatory testing facility, with heart rates ranging from 70-120 beats/min, ventricular pressure slopes (dp/dt) from 1800-5600 mmHg/sec, and cardiac outputs from 5.0-7.5 liters/min. This paper introduces the laser sweeping technique developed for precision monitoring of MHV leaflet motion, and presents the detailed leaflet motions within the last 3 degrees before final closure. The experimental results showed that the final closing velocity of DM, which is known to generate a louder valve sound and has a shorter closing period than that of SJ, actually has approximately the same closing velocity within the range of the experiment. Theoretical analysis further confirms that a short closing period may not lead to a higher leaflet final closing velocity.\r"

Nevertheless, the closing volumes and closed valve leakage volumes were, on average, lower than other prosthetic valves.

The follow-up period ranged from 32 to 145 months (mean 89 months). Regurgitant flow of the tricuspid bioprosthesis was studied by color Doppler echocardiography. Peak velocity (Vp) and pressure half time (PHT) were measured by continuous wave Doppler echocardiography. Operative mortality was 13.7% (4/29), with the actuarial survival rate, including operative deaths, 75% at 10 years. Valve thrombosis developed in one patient 4 years after TVR. Color Doppler showed regurgitation in 7 of the 20 patients who were completely followed up, but they were all asymptomatic and required no special intervention. Cusp tear or calcification requiring reoperation was not observed in this study, including 8 patients younger than 35 years of age. The Vp was significantly slower, and PHT was significantly prolonged, in the tricuspid rather than the mitral position. These data demonstrate that bioprosthetic valves in the tricuspid position can be used safely. Doppler examination should be performed taking these different flow dynamics into account.\r"

A total artificial heart (TAH) model was employed to better understand the hemodynamic influence of an LVAD on the failing right ventricle. Biventricular failure was simulated by reducing both ventricular drive pressures of the TAH. After getting hemodynamic data, LVAD pumping in the case of right ventricular failure was simulated by increasing just the left ventricular drive pressure. In the LVAD-simulating condition, cardiac output increased and right atrial pressure decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) compared with the biventricular failure condition, whereas right ventricular function and minute work were the same in these two conditions. Even though changes were accompanied by adaptive increases in pulmonary resistance, substantially lower pulmonary artery and left atrial pressures resulted in the LVAD-simulating condition. From a hemodynamic perspective, these results indicate that an LVAD can increase right ventricular volume work by decreasing right ventricular pressure work, whereas right ventricular net pressure-volume work is unchanged and right ventricular failure is not worsened.\r"

After 2 weeks the VAD was quickly replaced by a centrifugal pump, MD-10 (Iwaki Pump, Tokyo, Japan), 760 g in weight and phi 70 mm x 84 mm in size, set on the back, without anesthesia. A 100% nonpulsatile bypass flow was immediately obtained, and the pump was set to maintain the same mean aortic pressure as before the switch; central venous pressure, cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, oxygen consumption, blood lactate, plasma adrenalin, noradrenalin, renin activity, angiotensin II, and aldosterone were measured. Behavior of the goats did not change, and fluid infusion and higher cardiac outputs were not required. Most of the parameters did not deviate from control levels after the switch. In conclusion, a mammal immediately accommodates well to nonpulsatile flow.\r"

Ten data points were taken for each patient. LV cannulation results in higher VAD flow index at decreased preload, lower VAD systolic and vacuum pressures, and shorter diastolic durations. Eleven of the 28 patients survived. Although survival was greater in patients with LV cannulation, survival was more dependent upon reversibility of myocardial damage, eligibility for transplantation, or the development of complications. These data indicate that LV cannulation provides better VAD performance than LA cannulation in the fill-to-empty mode.\r"

Between 1987 and 1989, 14 patients received an LVAS as a bridge to cardiac transplantation: 3 developed early tamponade (33 +/- 12 hr postoperatively) and 5 were diagnosed with a late tamponade (9.4 +/- 3.2 days postoperatively). One patient had both early and late tamponade. Early tamponade was more common in those with increased perioperative blood loss (5,270 +/- 1,942 ml vs. 1,420 +/- 1,160 ml in other patients, p less than 0.05). Early tamponade was suggested by reduction in mean arterial pressure (74 +/- 1 to 64 +/- 3 mmHg), LVAS output (5 +/- 0.5 to 2.7 +/- 0.7 L/min), LVAS stroke volume (55 +/- 4 to 23 +/- 5 ml), and an increase in central venous pressure (13 +/- 1 to 21 +/- 1 mmHg, p less than 0.05 for all values). Late tamponade was associated with a marked rise in central venous pressure (14 +/- 1 to 22 +/- 2 mmHg, p less than 0.05), with only a mild decrease in LVAS output (4.9 +/- 1 to 3.8 +/- 0.9 L/min) and stroke volume (49 +/- 8 to 36 +/- 3 ml), without a significant change in mean arterial pressure. Two of these five late episodes occurred in patients who were anticoagulated with heparin (PTT 52 and 100 sec), and in one other with warfarin (PT 27 sec, PTT 55 sec); two patients were not on any anticoagulants. Surgical drainage of pericardial effusions, and especially of clotted blood found frequently posterior to the left ventricle in the space created by the LVAS decompressed left ventricle, resulted in an immediate return of all hemodynamic measurements to normal in both early and late tamponade.\r"

Centrifugal assist was employed only after failure to wean with usual resuscitative measures, including multiple high dose inotropes and intraaortic balloon pumping. There were five men and one woman, 46-59 years of age (mean 61 years). All patients had undergone coronary artery bypass grafting, with two patients having had concomitant left ventricular aneurysmectomy and two aortic valve replacement. Five patients had left ventricular assist only and one had biventricular assist. Duration of assist ranged from 26 to 72 hr (mean 48 hr). Complications were ubiquitous, and the resultant prolonged hospitalization was resource intensive. All hospital survivors remain alive and are in New York Heart Association functional Class II, with an average follow-up of 24 months, (6-41 months). Compared with preoperative values, current left ventricular function is improved in 2 patients, has deteriorated in 3, and is unchanged in 1. Thus, the Sarns centrifugal pump will allow salvage of some patients who otherwise are not weanable from CPB. Survivors can expect a reasonable functional capacity as reflected by this experience.\r"

The dose-dependent inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation induced by collagen showed that a ten-fold higher activity was found for a linear decapeptide, VVVRGDSVVV (V = Val), and a 100-fold increase for cyclic tetrapeptide, cyclo(RGDG), as compared with RGDS (half inhibition concentration, 0.1 mmol/L).

In this paper, the surface property that alters cell adhesion, spreading, migration, and proliferation processes is shown to be a determinant of endothelial cell assembly or angiogenesis in vitro. This was clearly demonstrated on slightly hydrophobic cellulosic surfaces, which induced organized three-dimensional cellular assemblies of bovine thoracic endothelial cells. The results indicated that this was driven by enhanced migratory response and/or retraction or involution of two-dimensional adherent cells, in which cell-cell interaction was enforced in a time dependent fashion. The present study strongly suggests that the mechanism leading to in vitro angiogenesis is primarily due to a weak cell-substrate interaction relative to cell-cell interaction.\r"

A unique composite patch that may be used to augment the pericardial tissue when primary closure is not possible has been developed. The patch is made of a hydrogel, poly (2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate), reinforced with an ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) mesh. The mesh provides the needed mechanical properties, whereas the patch's surface properties are comparable to the hydrogel. Two types of patches were fabricated: one with the mesh weave at a perpendicular orientation and one at 45 degrees to the principle loading direction. The patches were mechanically tested and compared with canine pericardium. Ultimate tensile strength of the patches is not significantly different from canine pericardium (p less than 0.05), are the patch suture strength is nearly twice that of canine pericardium. The perpendicular patch is stiffer than canine pericardium, whereas the 45 degree patch is not (p less than 0.05). The 45 degree patch shows considerable promise as a pericardial substitute because it closely matches the properties native canine pericardium.\r"

Monocytes/macrophages were labeled with fluorescent ligands or monoclonal antibodies specific for 1) receptors for C5a, formyl-met-leu-phe (fMLP); Fc region of IgG; C3b (CR1); and C3bi (CR3), 2) Class II histocompatibility antigens HLA-DR and HLA-DQ; and 3) monocyte/macrophage surface antigen CD14. The cells were analyzed using flow cytometry. Results indicated that there were no differences between monocytes and peritoneal macrophages in their receptor expression for fMLP, CR1, or CR3. However, paired t-testing indicated that peritoneal macrophages had significantly increased expression of Fc and C5a receptors, as well as enhanced antigen expression of HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, and CD14. These results suggest that peritoneal macrophages from CAPD patients are activated with increased expression of receptors and antigens important in host defense.\r"

The effects of 24 weeks of treatment with Simvastatin, a new HMG coenzyme A-reductase inhibitor (at 20 and 40 mg/day) on serum lipid, lipoprotein, and apolipoprotein A-I and B concentrations, as well as safety parameters and subjective side effects, were evaluated in eight patients (mean duration CAPD 24.80 +/- 7.50 months, age 54.50 +/- 13.70 years). Maximal effects on plasma lipoprotein and apolipoprotein concentrations were achieved after 4 weeks, and remained stable thereafter during the study. Mean fasting plasma cholesterol concentrations decreased from 280.5 +/- 60.2 mg% to 190.2 +/- 40.4 mg/dl (p less than 0.005) (-47%); mean plasma LDL-cholesterol concentrations also decreased from 257.6 +/- 13.4 mg% to 190.5 +/- 15.4 mg/dl (p less than 0.001) (-35%). Apolipoprotein A and B concentrations decreased significantly from 1.78 +/- 0.19 to 1.40 +/- 0.22 g/L (p less than .005) and 1.81 +/- 0.26 to 1.38 +/- 0.20 g/L (p less than .005). These data substantiate the view that Simvastatin is well tolerated and that no serious clinical or adverse laboratory effects have been observed. It appears to be a promising drug for the effective control of hyperlipemia in a large proportion of hypercholesterolemic patients, reducing their cardiovascular morbidity while on CAPD.\r"

A statistically significant increase in phosphate clearances (4 and 6 hr dwell times) (1.36%) and a reduction in drainage volume (2 hr dwell time) (1.36%) were observed after treatment. Urine output and percent dextrose reabsorption were unchanged. The ultrafiltration (UF) showed a tendency to increase, which lasted for 15 days after discontinuation of treatment. This tendency allowed the patients to reduce, during the same period, the amount of hypertonic solution (23.8 L vs. 21.3 L) required. The tendency to increase UF over time deserves further study.\r"

Five anuric, stable, PD patients entered a 4 month study to determine the NTPD session length necessary for clinically adequate dialysis and creatinine clearance similar to those on four daily 2 L CAPD exchanges. NTPD was performed using a modified PAC-X-2 cycler, with the drain phase regulated by a target volume. One patient completed 3.5 months of study, one 4 months, three 6 months, and one patient each continued on NTPD for 13, 14, and 32 months. The mean NTPD session time was 9 hr 24 min (range 8 hr 35 min to 9 hr 55 min) at the end of 4 months. All patients had clinically adequate dialysis. Three patients preferred NTPD over CAPD, particularly because of an empty abdomen during the daytime. One patient required an increase in NTPD time, and an addition of one daytime exchange, because of low creatinine clearance. In conclusion, NTPD provides weekly creatinine clearances comparable to CAPD, with an acceptable duration of nightly dialysis sessions in most anuric patients. A new PD machine providing inexpensive dialysis solution in large quantities, as well as safe and false alarm free dialysis sessions, is needed for practical NTPD implementation.\r"

A self-calibrating, wearable blood glucose monitor has been developed to overcome these impediments. The wearable blood glucose monitor is a 410 g forearm-mounted instrument with three miniature pumps for blood sampling, calibration, and insulin infusion, and a flow cell containing an enzyme-electrode sensor capable of determining plasma glucose levels accurately and precisely in undiluted whole blood. The unit is connected to a computer controller with graphics display. Venous blood is drawn from a 21 gauge single lumen cannula through the sensor flow cell. A rate determination of glucose is completed in 20 sec and the blood is returned to the arm vein. Heparinized saline wash solution follows. No blood loss or significant systemic heparinization occurs. Cycle time is set from 2 to 5 min. The method is linear to at least 300 mg/dl glucose, independent of hematocrit, and free of interferences from blood constituents at normal venous pO2 with a coefficient of variation of 1-3% between calibrations. The sensor has a service life of at least 3 weeks. This wearable blood glucose monitor, with its high performance sensor, reduced size, and ease of operation, shows promise for evaluating and treating diabetes.\r"

Platinum (Pt) catalyzed electrodes have been demonstrated in vitro to show high sensitivity to glucose and long cycle life but are more sensitive to co-reactants compared with enzymatic methods. The authors developed a special data processing method (compensated net charge ratio, or CNCR) in which the measured electrode response is very sensitive to glucose, completely insensitive to urea, and only moderately sensitive to amino acids. Other endogenous and exogenous co-reactants show only minor interferences. The CNCR method involves the determination of the ratio of net oxidation charge to total charge during one complete cycle of a cyclic voltammogram. Prototype electrodes tested in vitro in spiked plasma have shown typical sensitivities of greater than 2 x 10(-4) CNCR units per 1 mg/dl change in glucose concentration, with linear response up to 400 mg/dl. For in vivo testing, a modified 5 F vascular catheter with membrane covered surface mounted electrodes was used at a vena cava site in swine. Several sensor designs were tested in vivo, with sensitivities of 1-5 x 10(-4) CNCR units (mg/dl).\r"

The variation of albumin, IgG, and IgM sieving coefficients with time during dead-end filtration was investigated using human pooled plasma and two types of hollow fiber filters (cellulose acetate PF 100 and ethylene vinyl alcohol Eval 2A). For the same filtrate flux (3.6 10(-3) cm/min) the transmembrane pressure (TMP) rises faster with time for the Eval filter because of its smaller hydraulic permeability (0.26 10(-4) cm/min mmHg vs. 7.3 10(-4). The albumin S' of the PF 100 reaches 0.95 after 20 min of filtration but drops to 0.4 after 50 min, whereas the S' of the Eval filter, which never exceeds 0.6, remains at this level for at least 50 min. By varying the inlet flow rate the authors show that for a given membrane, the critical parameter that governs the S' is the TMP. These data suggest that it is essential to specify the TMP when quoting a value of S', and the most permeable membrane, with the highest maximum S', is not necessarily the one that maximizes the overall recovery over a long period.\r"

Hepatic ischemia was created in rats by clamping the hepatoduodenal ligament for 90 min with splenofemoral bypass. Reperfusion was induced by unclamping the vessels and disconnecting the splenofemoral bypass. Then aPGI2 (350 ng/kg/min) was infused for 60 min just before hepatic ischemia, and SOD and CAT (5,000 units/kg each) were administered immediately before the start of reperfusion. Serum enzyme and mitochondrial function assessments of livers were made just after ischemia, and after 2 hr of reperfusion. Survival rate was also assessed in a separate group of rats. Liver enzymes such as SGOT, SGPT, and LDH showed no correlation to liver viability. The administration of aPGI2 alone showed no effect on ischemically injured mitochondria; however, the free radical scavengers (SOD, CAT), in combination with aPGI2, showed significant improvement of mitochondrial function together with extension of survival. The ultrastructure of hepatocytes was better preserved in the treated groups. These agents improved the viability of ischemic-reperfused injured livers.\r"

Nonpulsatile high flow and pulsatile low flow blood are supplied to the portal venous (PV) and hepatic arterial (HA) circulations. Controlled low blood flow (5-10 cc/kg [patient]/min) is exchanged between the high flow extracorporeal perfusion circuit (1 cc/g [liver]/min) and the patient. The system was evaluated in perfusions of fresh, excised pig livers (n = 5). The average oxygen consumption was 9 +/- 3 microliters/g/min, and bile production averaged 4.7 microliters/g/hr. Perfusion pressures and flows were normal in both the HA and PV circulations for about 4 hr. Pressures then gradually rose, especially in the HA circulation, causing flow to decrease, with subsequent mottling and discoloration of the liver. Red blood cell, platelet, and white blood cell counts fell continuously. Maintenance of liver function was assessed by clearance of an 80 mg taurocholic acid challenge. An average of 56% of injected acid was cleared from the perfused livers (n = 5) in the first half hour, compared with 90% and 25% for the in situ (n = 3) and unperfused (n = 3) control livers, respectively. The system consistently maintained livers in a moderately well functioning state through the first 4 hr of perfusion. Adequate support of animals with induced hepatic failure must now be demonstrated.\r"

Male rats excreted more APAP as the sulfate conjugate than female rats, which correlated with the twofold greater APAP sulfotransferase activity in the male versus female rats (301 +/- 24 vs. 156 +/- 18 pmol/mg protein/min). Also, as sulfate conjugation became saturated, there was a dose-related shift in APAP metabolism to glucuronide conjugation in both genders. After sacrifice, hepatocytes were cultured with APAP (0, 150, 250, 500, and 1,000 microM). Gender differences in APAP sulfation and glucuronidation persisted in culture for up to 4 days, with sulfation predominating in the male rats, similar to that seen in vivo. With increasing APAP dose, there was a saturation of sulfate conjugation and a shift to glucuronidation as observed in vivo.

By adding a safe unbinding agent to the blood (solutizer), which itself is adsorbed, hemoperfusion can become efficient and practical. Canines were made hyperbilirubinemic with an intravenous infusion of a 5 mg/ml solution (with Na2CO3) for 1 hour. Peak concentrations of 14-22 mg/dl were reached in adult dogs (25-35 kg). Hemoperfusion was then initiated with or without (control) the solutizer (sodium benzoate). The bilirubin unbinding effect of sodium benzoate was rapid and effective. Because of the simultaneous adsorption of sodium benzoate, a small activated carbon section that was presaturated with the solutizer was located proximal to the main hemoperfusion column, in addition to continuous infusion to reach 20 mM in the blood. Comparison of the normalized bilirubin concentration for benzoate augmented hemoperfusion with the average for control dogs, shows that benzoate results in a threefold decrease in the normalized bilirubin concentration after 1.5 hr of hemoperfusion. Sodium benzoate may also have the advantage of protecting platelets during hemoperfusion.\r"

Sixteen patients were unweanable from cardiopulmonary bypass at the time of surgery; nine were patients who developed cardiogenic shock postoperatively in the intensive care unit. One was a donor organ failure; one had a failed PTCA; and one an acute myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock preoperatively. Two patients were bridged to cardiac transplantation. Of the 28 nontransplant candidates, 20 (71.4%) were weaned successfully, 14 (50%) were discharged from the hospital, and 13 (46%) are alive from 1 to 46 months postoperatively (mean, 21.1 months). Three patients received right ventricular support alone; all three were weaned, and two (66.7%) were discharged. Ten patients received left ventricular assistance alone. Six (60%) were weaned, and four (40%) were discharged. Two patients received left ventricular support initially but were taken back for right VAD insertion because of right-sided heart failure; one (50%) is alive. Fifteen patients received biventricular support. Eleven (77.3%) were weaned, and eight (53.3%) were discharged. Patient ages ranged from 19 to 73 years, with a mean age for men of 59 years and 50.5 years for women. There were no thromboembolic events. Various clinical parameters were evaluated to determine effect on weanability and survival. These results show survival equivalent to any other VAD at this time. The centrifugal pump is a convenient and effective means of maintaining ventricular support in individuals who are believed to have salvageable myocardium.\r"

  ".W": "Prophylactic implantation of a Hemopump (Johnson and Johnson, Skillman, NJ) has been evaluated in nine patients selected for high risk coronary angioplasty. They were unstable patients, refractory to maximal pharmacology, with indications for revascularization, but contraindications for surgery such as low ejection fraction and lack of material for bypass. In all, the target lesion was located on the last patent vessel. The pump was inserted under local anesthesia, without any graft. A specially designed occluder permitted avoidance of retrograde bleeding during implantation. The bypass flow ranged from 2.5 to 3.2 L/min, and permitted a rise in cardiac index from 2.05 to 2.55 L/min/m2, with a drop in capillary wedge pressure from 13 (7-18) to 10 (7-13) mmHg. During balloon inflation, no electrocardiographic changes were observed, because only minor ventricular arrhythmias occurred. No significant hemolysis was seen (plasma free hemoglobin less than 10 mg/dl in all) after 2 hr of pumping. The only limitation of the technique appears to be difficulty at the time of implantation from narrow, stenosed, or tortuous iliofemoral arteries (3 patients). This experience strongly supports the benefit of temporary left ventricular Hemopump support in high-risk situations and clearly shows the need for a smaller pump.\r"

  ".W": "Immediate placement of a Hemopump (HP) ventricular assist device was undertaken in nine patients (seven men, two women) after other attempts at weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) after coronary bypass surgery had failed. All nine patients (100%) were successfully weaned from CPB, and six (63.3%) gradually improved enough to permit removal of HP support. Five (83.3%) of the six who were weaned from CPB survived beyond hospital discharge. HP support was evaluated in terms of vital organ function, incidence of complications, and clinical outcome. In both survivors (S) and nonsurvivors (NS), serial hemodynamic measurements were taken. Although there were few differences in hemodynamic parameters between groups at 4 hr, by 24 hr the S group had markedly improved cardiac index, Glasgow Coma Scale, urinary output, and pulse pressure and required far less inotropic support than did the NS group. All four patients who required high dose inotropic agents to maintain acceptable end-organ perfusion on HP support died; three were unable to tolerate weaning from the HP, and all died within 72 hr of surgery because of ineffective myocardial recovery. None of the survivors required additional early inotropic augmentation. Renal perfusion appeared to be well maintained, even with mean arterial pressures below 60 mmHg during HP support. There were no episodes of hemolysis, infection, or limb ischemia in either group. Thus, the Hemopump provided excellent circulatory support for those patients who could not be weaned from CPB by traditional methods.\r"

The system aspirates the left ventricular blood and actively pumps it into the aorta. Five patients (four men, one woman), aged 47-71 years (mean, 62 years), were candidates for hemopump support because of refractory cardiogenic shock. Three were recovering from repeated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, and two required postoperative emergency CABG for failed percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). One patient died during insertion, and four had the hemo-pump successfully placed. All patients had low cardiac out-put and had intraaortic balloons in place. Average insertion time took 20 min, with maintenance on the hemopump for an average of 13 hr. One patient was maintained on the hemopump for 12 hr, but because of continued deterioration, was placed on a total artificial heart (Harvik 7-70). Patients 3 (hemopump inserted transthoracically) and 4 had the hemopump discontinued because of brain death, and the fifth survived. This patient is alive and working 1 yr later. The hemopump is an effective left ventricular support system that is less invasive than conventional transthoracic systems.\r"

  ".W": "The Nimbus pump is an indwelling, electromagnetic powered left ventricular (LV) assist device inserted transfemorally. The inflow cannula (7 mm) is positioned across the aortic valve and the pump in the descending aorta. Indications for insertion include cardiogenic shock despite maximal medical support and PCWP greater than 18 mmHg, MAP less than 90 mmHg, and Cl less than 2 L/min/m2. Twelve patients underwent the attempt at surgical insertion of the Nimbus pump. Diagnoses included eight acute myocardial infarctions (AMI), two ischemic cardiomyopathy, one postpartum cardiomyopathy, and one transplanted heart rejection. Eight (67%) of twelve patients had successful insertion. One patient had peripheral vascular disease preventing passage, and three had femoral vessels too small for insertion (less than 7.5 Hagar dilator). Five patients with the diagnosis of AMI had successful insertion and three (60%) underwent sufficient LV recovery for removal of the device; the other two patients died of stroke and ventricular arrhythmias, respectively. Three patients with the diagnosis of cardiomyopathy had progression of the disease process, and their needs exceeded the capabilities of the pump and they died of multiorgan failure. The Nimbus pump is an attractive LV assist device because of its pumping capacity (3.5 L/min) and minor surgical procedure for insertion. However, its application is limited because of access route and size. The device appears to work well for patients in cardiogenic shock after AMI (60% recovery) but does not appear indicated for patients with cadiomyopathy.\r"

Subjective and objective symptoms were registered during HD and 12 and 36 hours thereafter. Type of membrane, membrane area, or Kt/V were of no importance for the occurrence of subjective or objective symptoms. The patients registered fewer symptoms during 2 hr HD with high blood flow than during 4 hr HD with slow blood flow (p = 0.04). Headache was particularly more frequent during the 4 hr HD. Blood pressure, and to some extent subjective symptoms, were influenced by ultrafiltration volume but not by type of membrane. Biocompatibility is not a determinant of acute side effects of hemodialysis.\r"

HD with PEGC resulted in lower granulocyte elastase production, protein and blood cells adsorption on the membrane surface than those with OC. Minimum heparin in HD with PEGC was three times lower than that with OC, with the thrombin-antithrombin III complex elevation lower than that in HD with OC. The results indicate that the grafted PEG effectively suppresses blood and membrane interaction, thus improving biocompatibility and reducing thrombogenicity in clinical HD.\r"

No BMG membrane adsorption and/or plugging was seen with cellulosic membrane dialyzers during in vitro experiments using human plasma. On the other hand, all synthetic polymer membrane dialyzers had adsorptive properties, and in a dialyzer with a polymethylmethacrylate membrane, a large amount of BMG was removed by adsorption alone. Dialyzers with cellulose triacetate and polyacrylonitril membranes showed higher values of BMG diffusive dialysance (greater than 20 ml/min) and sieving coefficient (greater than 0.9). From in vitro experiments using an aqueous solution containing several solutes with relatively small or middle molecular weights, all HPM dialyzers had a higher overall mass transfer coefficient than any conventional membrane dialyzer.\r"

The in vitro injury model using cultured bovine ECs showed the following: 1) a dose-dependent transmembrane injury, determined by monitoring intracellular calcium mobilization, occurred spontaneously upon addition of complement-activated serum. 2) The respiratory rate of adherent ECs, monitored by an oxygen electrode, was reduced with increases in activated complement serum levels, and increased further with time. 3) Whole cell activity, measured by the rate of cellular proliferation, was reduced with an increase in activated serum complement levels. 4) These cellular responses were almost completely absent in the presence of C3 antiserum, strongly indicating that activated C3 fragments are responsible for EC injury. Thus, complement activation during extracorporeal circulation may injure endothelium at the transmembranous, mitochondrial, and/or proliferative levels, depending upon contact time and concentration of activated complement.\r"

Better preserved platelet number and function, lower fibrinopeptide A levels, and lack of thrombus deposition were observed in the Duraflo II treated group, relative to the untreated control group, during the entire bypass period.

Various commercially available blood oxygenators were tested by using a modified AAMI/ASAIO in vitro blood trauma protocol. Direct gas contact oxygenators showed a marked decrease in total platelet count and significant platelet damage. Platelet depletion and platelet damage were lower in membrane oxygenators than in direct gas contact oxygenators. Differences in platelet damage were observed between membrane oxygenators. The observed differences between devices demonstrate the influence of materials and hemodynamic design on platelet depletion and damage.

IPFC levels were determined by chlorotetracycline fluorometry during extracorporeal circulation (ECC) with systemic heparin in eight Yorkshire pigs (weighing 30-40 kg; 3 control and 5 ECC); the ratio of slow phase organelle calcium sequestration to fast phase platelet-membrane binding is an index of free calcium. During 3 hr of ECC with a hollow fiber oxygenator (HFO) (Bentley CM-50) and AF (Bentley 1025), seven blood samples were collected 5 min before and during ECC. The platelet deposition (CPM/microCi) on HFO (PDHFO) was simultaneously measured with In-111-labeled autologous platelets (300-400 microCi) and a Geiger probe detector at -5, 0, 5, 30, 45, 60, 120, and 180 min. During ECC, IPFC and HFO thrombus increase significantly (p less than 0.05) at 45 min with respect to control IPFC values of 0.4 +/- 0.1, suggesting direct participation of calcium activated platelets in thrombosis on HFO. The decline of IPFC is due to extrusion and sequestration by dense granules, and decline in HFO thrombus is due to embolization. On the other hand, the embolus in the arterial filter was trapped in a linear fashion, with a consistent increase with time of ECC.\r"

Hemolysis in extracorporeal circuits has been found to occur with shear stress greater than 132 dynes/cm2, turbulence as measured by Reynold's number greater than 1,000, and velocity greater than 120 to 200 cm/sec. These parameters need to be considered when sizing the proper arterial cannula for a required flow rate. In-vitro measurements of the pressure drop across six arterial cannulae at varying flow rates were performed using human blood with a hematocrit of 43%. Shear stress, Reynold's number, velocity, and pressure drop were calculated for each catheter at flow rates from 50 to 1,000 cc/min. The maximum mean flow rate to maintain the shear stress, Reynold's number, velocity, and pressure drop within the accepted range, was determined for each cannula. Recommended maximum blood flow rates for each of the six cannulae are given. Internal diameter, length, and cannula geometry appear to be the factors most affecting the flow achievable without causing red blood cell damage and hemolysis. Ten French Biomedicus, 10 French Cook, and 10 French Elecath arterial cannulae appear best suited to deliver the range of blood flow rates used in neonatal ECMO.\r"

Understanding the disadvantages they present, a temporary prosthesis which effectively protects the small bowel, and is easy to remove, has been developed. The device is a 600 to 1,000 ml, silicone rubber, expandable balloon. When implanted in the pelvis or retroperitoneal cavity, and filled, this balloon displaces the intestinal loops out of the pelvic irradiation field. It may remain either filled or empty between each irradiation session. Due to its particular elliptical shape, once empty, the balloon can be removed through a 3 cm incision under local or peridural anesthesia at the completion of radiotherapy. Eleven patients with recurrent (8) or primary (3) cancer have been implanted. The protective effect has been evaluated on successive biologic tests, performed during treatment. No problem related to the prosthesis, no alteration of the biologic tests, nor bowel injury have been observed after several months follow-up. This device is suitable for preventing intestinal complications during therapy, allowing a higher dose of radiations in some cases.\r"

The authors propose a new method of determining cardiac output with Swan-Ganz catheters with varying time constants from thermal dilution curve data based on Newton's cooling law. Values for blood flow rate determined by the new method using a completely stirred tank of original design, mimicking the natural heart and using bovine blood, are almost the same as values observed at varying saline infusion volumes, saline temperatures, and saline infusion times.\r"
