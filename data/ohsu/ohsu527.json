  ".W": "Somatic cell hybrids derived from twitcher mouse cells and from control human fibroblasts were selected by two different methods. One method utilized 6-thioguanine-resistant twitcher cells as a parental line and the other used neomycin-resistant control human fibroblasts as a parental line so that hybrid lines could be selected in either HAT or in G-418 medium, respectively. The hybrid lines were analyzed for galactocerebrosidase activity. Since the twitcher cell lines are deficient in galactocerebrosidase activity, the presence of this activity in these hybrid lines depends upon the presence of human chromosome contents. Both galactocerebrosidase-positive and -deficient hybrid lines were analyzed for their human chromosome contents by the use of isozyme markers. In hybrids derived from both selection methods the expression of galactocerebrosidase activity was associated with the presence of human chromosome 17 marker isozymes. This was confirmed cytogenetically by means of trypsin-banded Giemsa staining of intact human chromosome 17 in three galactocerebrosidase-positive hybrid lines.\r"

  ".W": "The decision to screen for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN-2) is generally based on family history, the rationale for this approach being the presumed 100% penetrance of the disease. To determine the validity of this presumption we have estimated--by applying modifications of the life-table method--the clinical and screening age-at-diagnosis distributions for MEN-2, using families from the Cancer Research Campaign Medullary Thyroid Cancer Register and one large American family. The clinical penetrance of MEN-2 is shown to be incomplete, an estimated 41% of gene carriers not presenting with symptoms by age 70 on the basis of clinical history. Screening by the standard tests for detecting the earliest manifestations of the syndrome increases the penetrance to an estimated 93% by age 31. There is no evidence of a difference in the age-at-diagnosis distributions between maternal and paternal transmission, or among different families, but there is some suggestion of an earlier onset of medullary thyroid cancer in female gene carriers, and of a tendency of pheochromocytoma to cluster in families. These results can be used to calculate risks to relatives of affected individuals, which in turn can be used to guide decisions on which individuals to screen.\r"

  ".U": "89103315\r", 
  ".W": "Having found evidence for segregation at a major locus for a quantitative trait, a logical next step is to identify those pedigrees in which major-locus segregation is occurring. If the quantitative trait is a risk factor for an associated disease, identifying such segregating pedigrees can be important in classifying families by etiology, in risk assessment, and in suggesting treatment modalities. Identifying segregating pedigrees can also be helpful in selecting pedigrees to include in a subsequent linkage study to map the major locus. Here, we describe a strategy to identify pedigrees segregating at a major locus for a quantitative trait. We apply this pedigree selection strategy to simulated data generated under a major-locus or mixed model with a rare dominant allele and sampled according to one of several fixed-structure or sequential sampling designs. We demonstrate that for the situations considered, the pedigree selection strategy is sensitive and specific and that a linkage study based only on the pedigrees classified as segregating extracts essentially all the linkage information in the entire sample of pedigrees. Our results suggest that for large-scale linkage studies involving many genetic markers, the savings from this strategy can be substantial and that, compared with fixed-structure sampling, sequential sampling of pedigrees can greatly improve the efficiency for linkage analysis of a quantitative trait.\r"

G6PD deficiency in different geographical areas appears to have arisen through independent mutational events, but within the same population it may also be heterogeneous. One example is the island of Sardinia, where careful clinical and biochemical studies have identified four different G6PD variants. We cloned and sequenced the four G6PD variants from Sardinia and found that only two mutations are responsible for G6PD deficiency in this area: one mutation is the cause of the G6PD Seattle-like phenotype, a milder form of G6PD deficiency; the other mutation is responsible for all forms of very severe G6PD deficiency in Sardinia and, possibly, in the Mediterranean.\r"

  ".W": "The Lowe syndrome (LS), or oculocerebrorenal syndrome, has been studied using DNA-based linkage analysis, and the findings have been correlated with the result of a thorough ophthalmologic examination. It was found that the LS gene was linked to markers in the Xq24-q26 region and that the locus DXS42 was the most closely linked marker, giving a LOD score of 3.12 at zero recombination distance. Combined with earlier data, this forms the basis for carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis by using tightly linked flanking markers. A summary of our and other data suggests that the loci DXS17, DXS11, DXS87, and DXS42 are located on the proximal side, and DXS86 and DXS10 on the distal side of the Lowe locus. In isolated cases of LS the question of whether the mother is a carrier of the mutation arises. It was found that a lens examination with slit-lamp illumination and a count of the total number of lenticular opacities is a reliable method of ascertaining the carrier state.\r"

  ".W": "The locus DXS98, detected with the 1.5-kb anonymous probe p4D-8, was recently shown to be closely linked and proximal to the locus for the fragile X syndrome, with theta = .05 at lod = 3.406, by utilizing a limited number of meioses informative for a two-allele MspI RFLP. Because DXS98 may be the closest available marker to the fragile X locus (FRAXA), we sought to increase its utility for linkage studies by extending its PIC and confirming its localization to Xq27, proximal to FRAXA. We have isolated 15 kb of genomic DNA (lambda 4D8-3) from the DXS98 locus by using p4D-8 to screen a genomic phage library containing partial Sau3A-digested human DNA. Three additional RFLPs for the enzymes BglII and XmnI were found by using the entire lambda 4D8-3 as probe. Combined heterozygosity for the four RFLPs in 25 unrelated females was 48%, as compared with only 28% when the MspI RFLP alone was used. In situ hybridization of unique sequences from lambda 4D8-3 was performed on metaphase chromosomes of lymphocytes and lymphoblasts from patients with the fragile X syndrome. Grains on the X chromosome were significantly clustered at band Xq27. Following fragile site induction, all nine grains in the q27-28 region were proximal to the fragile site. Confirmation of the location of DXS98 proximal to FRAXA and the new RFLPs at this locus make DXS98 more useful for linkage analysis and physical mapping in the region of the fragile X mutation.\r"

  ".W": "A 7-generation kindred with the HLA-linked form of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA1) was studied to determine whether the SCA1 gene maps centromeric or telomeric to the HLA loci. The DNA markers flanking the HLA-(A-B) region were used for polymorphism studies and multilocus linkage analysis. These two markers are the cDNA for the beta-subunit of HLA-DP, which is centromeric to HLA-(A-B), and the cDNA for coagulation factor XIIIa (F13A), which is telomeric to HLA-(A-B). Haplotypes were constructed using multiple polymorphisms for these two DNA markers, and pairwise linkage analysis revealed a maximum lod score of 2.18 for SCA1 versus HLA-DP at a recombination fraction of .05 and a maximum lod score of 0 for SCA1 versus F13A at a recombination fraction of .50. A possible crossover between HLA-(A-B) and HLA-DP was identified, but lack of samples from key individuals hampered the analysis. To clarify the phase and improve the analysis, the two chromosomes 6 for the crossover individual were separated in somatic cell hybrids. The results strongly favored the probability that the crossover occurred between HLA-(A-B-DR) and HLA-DP with SCA1 segregating with HLA-DP, consistent with a location centromeric to HLA-(A-B). Multilocus linkage analysis was used to evaluate further the location of SCA1 relative to F13A, HLA-(A-B), and HLA-DP; the results indicated that the SCA1 gene locus is centromeric to HLA-DP with odds of 46:1 favoring this most likely location over the second most likely location, i.e., telomeric to HLA-(A-B) between the HLA complex and F13A.\r"

A DNA clone detecting an RFLP at the ERBA beta locus has been used to probe a large number of lung tumors. Virtually all SCLC had lost heterozygosity, showing that the 3p deletion in SCLC includes this gene. A substantial but smaller proportion of non-small-cell carcinomas had lost heterozygosity at ERBA beta. Among all non-small-cell tumors some had lost heterozygosity at the proximal locus DNF15S2 (band 3p21) but not at ERBA beta, whereas none were found where the reverse was true. Therefore, the locus which plays a role in non-small-cell tumorigenesis probably lies closer to DNF15S2 than to ERBA beta and is almost certainly not the latter.\r"

Only 49% of personnel costs were covered by income from patient charges. In a genetics clinic in a private specialty hospital, 5.5 and 2.75 h were required to provide cognitive services to each new and follow-up family, respectively. The mean charge for each new family was $25/h and for follow-up families $13/h. The amount collected was less than 25% of that charged. In a pediatric genetics clinic in a large teaching hospital, new families required a mean of 4 h and were charged $28/h; follow-up families also required a mean of 4 h, and were charged $15/h. Only 55% of the amounts charged were collected. Income from patient charges covered only 69% of personnel costs. In a genetics outreach setting, 5 and 4.5 h were required to serve new and follow-up families, respectively. Charges were $25/h and $12/h, and no monies were collected. In all clinic settings, less than one-half of the total service time was that of a physician, and more than one-half of the service time occurred before and after the clinic visit. In no clinic setting were cognitive genetics services self-supporting. Means to improve the financial base of cognitive genetics services include improving collections, increasing charges, developing fee schedules, providing services more efficiently, and seeking state, federal, and foundation support for services.\r"

In patients with preeclampsia (group 3) the serum inhibition of platelet-activating factor activity was significantly lower than that in groups 1 and 2. However, no detectable amounts of platelet-activating factor were observed. The mean values of platelet aggregation induced by platelet-activating factor, adenosine diphosphate, collagen and ristocetin, and the prostaglandin I2-inhibitory concentration of 50% which is inversely correlated with platelet sensitivity to prostaglandin I2, were not significantly different between groups 2 and 3. It is suggested that in preeclampsia the defect in serum inhibitory potential of platelet-activating factor--induced platelet aggregation may contribute to the disturbance in the homeostatic balance between proaggregant and antiaggregant substances.\r"

One hundred cases in which bradycardia was noted were compared with 48 cases in which abnormal fetal heart rate patterns did not occur. Case and control subjects were matched to provide an equivalent risk of developing ascending infection in the two groups. Fetoplacental weight ratio and the presence of other placental diseases were also considered. The presence of acute inflammation in the umbilical cord (p = 0.03), amnion (p = 0.01), and choriodecidua (p = 0.03), and higher grades of inflammation in chorionic plate (p = 0.03) were linked to the presence of abnormal fetal heart rate patterns. No other placental factors were associated with increased risk of fetal bradycardia. The association of abnormal fetal heart rate patterns with acute inflammation suggests that intra-amniotic inflammation is important in the genesis of fetal bradycardias. The inflamed amniotic fluid could alter fetal metabolism via effects on the pulmonary or gastrointestinal systems or effects on umbilical and chorionic vessels.\r"

  ".W": "While observation of fetal breathing movements has been used in fetal assessment, quantitative parameters (percent time spent in breathing [incidence], breath rate, or breath rate variability) have not been adequately evaluated as predictive tools. We examined 283 patients with high-risk pregnancies between 32 and 42 weeks' gestation and correlated their fetal breathing movement parameters with the rates of perinatal mortality, intrapartum fetal distress, neonatal acidosis, low 5-minute Apgar score, and intrauterine growth retardation. Fetal breathing data from standardized 60-minute biophysical tests were analyzed and compared with our institutional standards. Parameter values greater than 2 SD from the means of a previously studied normal population were considered abnormal. Whereas no individual parameter was a highly accurate predictor of adverse outcome, a fetal breathing movement incidence of less than 5% provided the best cutoff for diagnostic accuracy. Seventy percent of fetuses with 30 minutes of apnea had normal outcomes, whereas abnormally high breath rates (greater than 60 breaths/min) and low breath rates (less than 33 breaths/min) occurred with equal frequency among normal and pathologic fetuses. Breath interval variability was of no benefit in detecting fetuses with poor outcomes. Observation of fetal breathing movement incidence appeared to be most effective in pregnancies complicated by chronic hypertension and least effective in those with preeclampsia.\r"

  ".W": "The application of the nonstress test between 24 and 32 weeks' gestation has been limited by high rates of \"false\" nonreactivity in normal fetuses, by use of term criteria, and the lack of age-appropriate interpretative standards. To establish such standards, we studied 30 normal fetuses undergoing 90-minute fetal heart rate recordings at 2-week intervals from 24 to 32 weeks' gestational age. Using a specially programmed computer we quantified (1) baseline fetal heart rate, (2) incidence of 10- and 15-beat accelerations, and (3) incidence of fetal heart rate decelerations. With a criterion of three 15-beat accelerations per 30 minutes 91% of tests were reactive within 90 minutes. A criterion of three 10-beat accelerations per 30 minutes was associated with 100% reactivity within 60 minutes. Suitable interpretative criteria may be established for nonstress tests before 32 weeks' gestation by extending the testing time or by decreasing the minimum amplitude required of fetal heart rate accelerations.\r"

The favorable clinical response correlated with urodynamic findings of increased urethral closure pressure and improved abdominal pressure transmission to the proximal urethra (p less than 0.05); in the patients who had a poor clinical response to estrogens, no significant changes in urethral dynamics were noted. Changes in urethral cytologic findings also correlated well with clinical and urodynamic findings. Patients with a favorable response to estrogen showed a maturation change from transitional to intermediate squamous epithelium (p less than 0.02), whereas nonresponders showed no significant changes in urethral cells.\r"

Penetration rates were standardized (hamster egg in vitro penetration assay index) by comparison with semen from fertile controls in each bioassay. Saturation of heparin-binding domains was achieved in 100% of raw ejaculates (prewash), but in only 53% of \"swim-up\" (postwash) samples. The dissociation constants ranged from 0.31 to 48.75 nmol/10(6) cells, and binding site concentrations from 0.47 to 20.82 x 10(17) binding sites/cell. Heparin-binding affinity was significantly greater in prewash compared with postwash samples (p less than 0.01). In prewash samples the number of binding sites differed significantly between subjects having low and high penetration indices (5.67 +/- 1.05 vs 2.01 +/- 0.34 x 10(17) binding sites/cell, p less than 0.05). In prewash samples, binding affinity for heparin significantly correlated with hamster egg in vitro penetration assay indices (R2 = 0.142, p less than 0.05). In contrast, the number of binding sites in prewash samples was negatively correlated with hamster egg in vitro penetration assay indeces (R2 = 0.201, p less than 0.05). These data indicate that the heparin-binding assay may prove to be a rapid, sensitive, and inexpensive means of assessing fertilizing potential of human spermatozoa.\r"

Twenty-eight percent of the pregnancies failed to progress beyond the first trimester. One pregnancy was terminated at 22 weeks' gestation because of severe fetal malformation. Important antenatal events included premature uterine activity in six patients although only one patient with a singleton pregnancy ultimately was delivered prematurely. Retroplacental hemorrhage occurred in four patients but was of clinical consequence in only one. There was a high incidence of breech presentation at term in singleton pregnancies (12%). The cesarean section rate in this series was 21%. An international registry of cryopreserved pregnancies would facilitate data collection in this relatively new clinical field.\r"

  ".W": "We characterized the innervation of human myometrial tissues by electrical field stimulation and electron microscopy. Nerve-specific parameters (pulse duration 0.6 msec) were used for electrical field stimulation to selectively activate intrinsic nerves. In specimens from nonpregnant, nonparous women (n = 6), tetrodotoxin (10(-6) mol/L) significantly reduced the response to electrical field stimulation by 70%. Contractions to electrical field stimulation were also inhibited to 60% by atropine (10(-5) mol/L) as well as by guanethidine (10(-5) mol/L) and phentolamine (10(-5) mol/L). Propranolol (10(-5) mol/L) had no detectable effect. We obtained similar results from about 50% of the specimens from nonpregnant, parous women (n = 15). The contractile responses of specimens from the term pregnant uterus (n = 13) to electrical field stimulation were not influenced by tetrodotoxin. Ultrastructurally we found nerve profiles in close proximity to muscle cells. About 30% of nerve varicosities in tissues from nonpregnant, nonparous patients could be classified as adrenergic (small, dense-cored vesicles), 53% as cholinergic (small, agranular vesicles), and about 17% as indeterminant (sometimes large, dense-cored vesicles). However, nerve varicosities were rarely observed in term pregnant specimens. These results indicate the presence of tetrodotoxin-sensitive, excitatory innervation of human myometrium consisting of alpha-adrenergic and cholinergic components. Furthermore, denervation may be nearly complete at term and recovery of innervation occurs at a considerable length of time after delivery.\r"

Responses to potassium chloride were used to normalize the data. At comparison with the term vessel, the preterm artery contracted more to angiotensin II and arachidonic acid and was more sensitive to oxytocin. Contractions were greater in term arteries to vasopressin, norepinephrine, prostaglandin D2, and prostaglandin E2 but similar in both group of arteries to bradykinin, histamine, acetylcholine, and prostaglandin F2 alpha. Neuropeptide Y, linoleic acid, uridine triphosphate, and thrombin were ineffective. Hyperoxia inconsistently induced weak, short-lived contractions. Contractions to cooling manifested marked desensitization and tachyphylaxis. Serotonin was the only agonist that displayed the pharmacodynamic features most likely to be important for closure: potency, efficacy, and long duration of action (greater than 2.5 hours). It was postulated that cellular elements surrounding umbilical vessels are primary sources of vasoactive agents that are important to closure of the fetoplacental circulation at birth.\r"

  ".W": "In baboons, the placenta remains in situ and functional with respect to the potential for aromatization after removal of the fetus (fetectomy). Fetectomy therefore was used to study effects of the fetus and estrogen on placental delivery. By term, serum estradiol levels in untreated, intact baboons had increased to 4 to 8 ng/ml, and fetoplacental delivery occurred on day 184 +/- 1 (mean +/- SE). Fetectomy at midgestation resulted in a nondetectable serum estradiol level and a marked decline in progesterone level; however, placentas were maintained in situ and were delivered on day 171 +/- 6. After fetectomy therefore the initiation of placental delivery and, presumably, myometrial contractility did not require an elevation in estrogen. Administration of estradiol (1 to 10 mg/day) to baboons after fetectomy resulted in normal serum estradiol concentrations, but placental delivery was prevented. When estrogen was discontinued on days 215 to 250, the serum estradiol level declined, and placental delivery occurred on day 262 +/- 18, a value greater than in intact baboons or untreated baboons after fetectomy (p less than 0.001). Thus estrogen prevented placental delivery in baboons after fetectomy.\r"

Some filamin, myosin, and calcium-binding protein were also present. The thin filaments activated skeletal or smooth muscle myosin magnesium adenosine triphosphatase at least 30-fold. Activation was regulated by Ca2+; maximum observed Ca2+ sensitivity was greater than 10 times. The thin filaments were dismantled into component proteins by the method of Smith and Marston. Actin and actin-tropomyosin-activated myosin magnesium adenosine triphosphatase, but the activation was not Ca2+-regulated. Added caldesmon inhibited adenosine triphosphatase activation by as much as 80%, with 50% inhibition at 1 caldesmon per 50 actin. Caldesmon inhibition was not Ca2+ dependent, but inhibition could be reversed by further addition of Ca2+ and calmodulin. It is concluded that the thin filaments of uterine smooth muscle are Ca2+ regulated and that this regulatory system could be involved in control of uterine smooth muscle contractility. A mechanism for thin filament regulation, mediated by caldesmon, is proposed.\r"

The decreased systemic vascular resistance response to angiotensin II in the pregnant animals was accompanied by a reduced pressor response. Contractility to phenylephrine hydrochloride and norepinephrine was reduced in aortic rings isolated from pregnant, compared with nonpregnant, guinea pigs. Treatment with meclofenamate, a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor, did not restore vasoreactivity in either the pregnant animal or the isolated vessel to levels observed in the nonpregnant state.

Hybridization was superior to cytologic and colposcopic examinations and was equivalent to histopathologic study for papillomavirus detection. Infection with virus types 6 and/or 11 was associated with milder disease, whereas virus types 16 and/or 18 infection alone or in association with types 6 and/or 11 was associated with more severe disease. Because papillomavirus infection may not be detected by cytologic or colposcopic examination and specific virus types have been documented to be associated with invasive disease, deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization analysis for at least these virus types should be carried out in conjunction with conventional procedures when evaluating women with cervical disease. Filter in situ hybridization is a simple, rapid, noninvasive procedure and has enhanced diagnostic value over conventional procedures by defining infecting virus types.\r"

Specifically, we characterized the enzyme activity under optimal in vitro conditions in cytosolic fractions of uterine decidua vera tissue obtained at term and compared the substrate and cosubstrate specificities of prostaglandin dehydrogenase in cytosolic fractions of decidual tissues. The incubation conditions were optimized with either prostaglandin E2 or F2 alpha and nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide or nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate as substrates to ensure linearity of product formation with time of incubation and protein concentration. The apparent Michaelis-Menten constant of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide-dependent prostaglandin dehydrogenase for prostaglandin E2 was 5.5 mumol/L. The apparent Michaelis-Menten constant of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent prostaglandin dehydrogenase for prostaglandin F2 alpha was 15 mumol/L. Prostaglandin E2 serves as a better substrate for prostaglandin dehydrogenase than does prostaglandin F2 alpha, irrespective of the cosubstrate. In cytosolic fractions of decidual tissues, the specific activity (apparent Vmax) of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide-dependent prostaglandin dehydrogenase was greater than that of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent prostaglandin dehydrogenase. In addition, we found that in decidual tissue obtained before or after the onset of labor, the specific activity of prostaglandin dehydrogenase varied widely. In tissues obtained after delivery by cesarean section, no significant differences were apparent in the specific activity of the enzyme before (9.3 to 125.8 nmol/min/mg protein) and after (27.8 to 103.4 nmol/min/mg protein) the onset of labor. In cytosolic fractions of decidual tissue obtained after vaginal delivery, the specific activity of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide-dependent prostaglandin dehydrogenase ranged from undetectable levels to 38.4 nmol/min/mg protein. We speculate that nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide-dependent prostaglandin dehydrogenase in decidua serves to regulate the levels of bioactive prostaglandins in decidua vera tissue and the amounts of prostaglandins (and metabolites) produced in decidua or fetal membranes that reach myometrium and fetal membranes and enter maternal blood and amniotic fluid.\r"

Group 2 consisted of 65 oocytes from 14 patients, none of whose oocytes had been fertilized. In group 1, 52.3% of the oocytes were found to be immature (germinal vesicle stage or metaphase-telophase I), whereas in group 2 only 26% were found to be immature. Thus oocyte nuclear immaturity was the major cause of fertilization failure when companion oocytes were fertilized. When no oocytes of a patient were fertilized, most oocytes were found to be mature, so other factors, such as sperm dysfunction or zona binding abnormalities, must account for most of the fertilization failure in this group of patients.\r"

  ".W": "Absence of end-diastolic velocity on umbilical artery velocimetry suggests extreme elevation of placental vascular resistance and is associated with adverse pregnancy outcome. This study was undertaken to assess whether antepartum improvement of abnormal umbilical artery waveforms occurs. Thirty-one fetuses identified with absence of end-diastolic velocity between July 1985 and December 1987 at Women's Hospital underwent sequential umbilical artery velocimetry at 1- to 3-day intervals. The presence of end-diastolic velocity on subsequent scans was considered an improvement in waveforms. The mean diagnosis-to-delivery interval (20.5 +/- 4 days), gestational age at delivery (32.5 +/- 1.2 weeks), and birth weight (1440 +/- 210 gm) were significantly higher in five fetuses that showed improvement in waveforms, compared with the 26 fetuses that did not show improvement in waveforms (9.5 +/- 3.5 days, 29.5 +/- 0.9 weeks, and 940 +/- 70 gm, respectively). Ten perinatal deaths occurred, for a perinatal mortality rate of 32.3%. There was significant perinatal morbidity in the overall group as judged by intrauterine growth retardation, meconium, 5-minute Apgar scores less than 7, and cesarean section for fetal distress. We conclude that although absence of end-diastolic velocity is associated with adverse pregnancy outcome, antepartum improvement in umbilical artery waveforms occurred in 15% of the fetuses studied and was associated with an improvement in perinatal outcome. Factors that influenced this improvement, though unclear, might be related to maternal bed rest or medication and require further investigation.\r"

Ovulation was induced with human chorionic gonadotropin, and ovulation points were counted before and after induction of endometriosis. Periovarian adhesions were graded, and ovaries were histologically examined. A significant decrease in the number of ovulation points was observed in ovaries with endometrial tissue (p = 0.001) but not in ovaries that contained adipose tissue (p = 0.095). Periovarian adhesions decreased the number of ovulation points (p less than 0.01) in ovaries that contained adipose or endometrial tissues. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that an increase in adhesion severity was correlated with a decrease in the number of ovulation points (p less than 0.05), but endometrial tissue was not (p = 0.45). We conclude that, in the rabbit model, minimal ovarian endometriosis impairs ovulation primarily through a mechanism related to periovarian adhesions.\r"

Pregnancy was associated with no change in methoxamine sensitivity, an increase in phenylephrine sensitivity, and a decrease in norepinephrine sensitivity. These differential changes in drug sensitivity suggest (1) the alpha 1-receptor population is functionally similar between the two groups of animals, (2) uptake 1 is inhibited, and (3) either catechol-O-methyltransferase activity is increased or the alpha 2- or beta-receptor population changes in this circulation during pregnancy. These data illustrate the complexity of the change in the adrenergic system during pregnancy.\r"

Initial treatment was based on clinical assessment, and propylthiouracil was usually given in doses of 300 to 800 mg daily. In compliant women seen by midpregnancy, euthyroidism was achieved by a mean of 8 weeks; however, the daily dose was decreased to less than or equal to 150 mg by delivery in only 10%. Metabolic status at delivery correlated directly with pregnancy outcome, and women treated earlier in pregnancy were more likely to be euthyroid at delivery and to have good outcomes. Diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis antecedent to pregnancy was associated with earlier treatment, and 80% of 28 such women were euthyroid by delivery. Conversely, 32 women with a first diagnosis during pregnancy had the preponderance of morbidity, including five of six stillbirths and six of seven cases of heart failure. This group was characterized by a relative delay in gestational age at diagnosis. Preterm delivery, perinatal mortality, and maternal heart failure were more common in women who remained thyrotoxic despite treatment and in those who were never treated. Although we infrequently achieved maintenance doses recommended by most, because there were minimal adverse effects from therapy described here and because uncontrolled thyrotoxicosis caused significant maternal and perinatal morbidity, aggressive medical therapy seems appropriate, especially when pregnancy is advanced.\r"

The results revealed that preventive medical practices, which have a high impact on morbidity and mortality, were not practiced to a significant degree by the spouses of obstetrician-gynecologists. Approximately 17% of the spouses did not have yearly Papanicolaou smears. Women older than 55 years of age were less likely to have this screening test than their younger cohorts. Only 65% perform breast self-examination, and 36% did not have screening mammography performed when recommended. In the postmenopausal group, 57% of the spouses did not receive estrogen replacement therapy, whereas 32% had both estrogen- and progesterone replacement therapy and 11% took estrogen alone. Contraceptive measures used by respondents indicated essentially equal distribution among methods available.

Fresh medium without radiolabel was then added for variable times (the chase period) before termination of the experiment. Autoradiography was used to follow changes in the regional distribution of the cells that divided during the pulse period and had 3H-thymidine-labeled DNA. Laser-treated explants, evaluated after a pulse with no chase, showed a fourfold increase in cell division (P less than .001) over nontreated controls. Nearly 60% of this cell division was localized to the anterior, nonfiltering region of the trabecular meshwork where it inserts into the cornea beneath Schwalbe's line. Trabecular cell division in other regions of the meshwork was not increased over controls at this time. After seven or 14 days of chase without radiolabel, the regional distribution of radiolabeled cells changed in laser-treated explants but not in controls. By 14 days, only 26% of the labeled cells remained in this anterior insert region, while 60% were found in the region of the burn sites. Macroautoradiography of whole explants corroborated these observations. Our data support the hypothesis that laser trabeculoplasty causes early cell division by a population of cells in the anterior meshwork; these new cells then migrate and repopulate the burn sites over the next few weeks.\r"

We examined preoperative and post-operative visual acuity, intraocular pressure, body weight, fluids infused during surgery, hematocrit, and cardiopulmonary bypass time. On the first postoperative day mean intraocular pressure increased 2.1 mm Hg (P = .003) from baseline preoperative levels. Over the first postoperative day intraocular pressure increased in 29 (63%) of the patients. Three patients (7%) had a greater than 10 mm Hg rise. The mean intraocular pressure returned to baseline by the third postoperative day. Patient weight increased from preoperative levels an average of 9.3 lbs (P less than .0001) on day 1 and 6.5 lbs on day 3. Mean hematocrit decreased 11.3% (P less than .0001) on day 1 from baseline and remained at that level through day 3. None of the patients complained of visual dysfunction during the course of this study and none showed more than a two-line decrease in near visual acuity. The increase in intraocular pressure did not correlate with the postoperative weight gain or hemodilution. However, the medications necessary after cardiac surgery may be a significant confounding variable. This study demonstrates that one cause of ocular problems from cardiopulmonary bypass surgery may be related to the dynamics of intraocular pressure.\r"

Nd:YAG laser photodisruption may be useful in the treatment of some cases of subinternal limiting hemorrhages.\r"

These patients were followed up for one to 20 months after the initial appearance of the hemorrhage. No subretinal new vessels were associated with these hemorrhages, which resolved over one to 15 months. Our findings indicated that hemorrhages occurring within areas of atrophy are not necessarily associated with subretinal new vessels, and that this type of hemorrhage has a good prognosis for resolution.\r"

Visual acuity with spectacles was 20/40 in five of 11 eyes; with contact lenses it reached 20/40 in ten of 11 eyes. However, two patients could not wear the contact lenses because of lens decentration caused by the marked distortion in corneal topography. Even with contact lenses, visual acuity could only be improved to 20/25 or better in six of 11 eyes.\r"

  ".W": "A patient with a left sensorimotor trigeminal neuropathy was found to have edema of the corneal stroma induced by cold. Examination at room temperature demonstrated an anesthetic left cornea with minimal injection of the left eye and multiple punctate epithelial erosions. Corneal thickness, mean endothelial cell size, coefficient of variation of cell size, endothelial permeability to fluorescein, and aqueous humor flow rate, measured at room temperature were similar in the two eyes. After 47 minutes in a cold room at 4 C, the corneal thickness in the left eye increased from 0.55 to 0.65 mm, whereas that of the right eye remained at 0.55 mm. During the period of maximum swelling, the left cornea had clinical stromal edema with folds in Descemet's membrane but no epithelial edema. After return to room temperature there was a gradual return to normal corneal thickness over three hours. Fluorophotometry showed no evidence of increased endothelial permeability during corneal swelling in the left eye. Specular microscopy after 15 minutes of cold exposure demonstrated many swollen and irregular endothelial cells with darkened areas between cells in the left eye. Sensory nerve deficiency in the human cornea can produce an abnormal sensitivity to cold, resulting in defective control of corneal hydration. This study suggests that this effect may be on the endothelium.\r"

Rabbit corneas were inoculated with Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. faecalis, or Haemophilus influenzae. Corneal scrapings were processed before and during antibacterial therapy using a coagglutination assay to detect pneumococcal capsular antigen (Phadebact Pneumococcus test) and an enzyme immunoassay to detect group A streptococcal cell-wall antigen (TestPack Strep A test). In untreated infected eyes, both immunoassays were highly specific and as sensitive as Gram stain for detection of the respective microorganisms. For S. pneumoniae keratitis, the sensitivity of coagglutination was 82% and Gram stain, 73%. For S. pyogenes keratitis, the sensitivity of enzyme immunoassay was 100% and Gram stain, 62%. Immunoassays and Gram stain were less sensitive than culture during antibacterial therapy. Successful clinical application of the coagglutination assay in a patient with pneumococcal keratitis permitted early use of specific cephalosporin treatment.\r"

There was significantly less bromodeoxyuridine uptake in irradiated vs nonradiated melanomas (P less than .0001). Similarly, tissue culture growth of irradiated tumors was significantly less (P less than .007). These data demonstrate destruction of reproductive integrity of helium ion-irradiated melanomas. The incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine and fine needle aspiration biopsy techniques may be useful in the delineation of successfully irradiated tumors from tumors with apparent growth secondary to radiation vasculopathy.\r"

Sixty patients scheduled for routine extracapsular cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation were randomly assigned into one of three treatment groups: (1) carbachol, (2) acetylcholine, or (3) 0.5% balanced salt solution (placebo). Baseline intraocular pressures were determined the day before surgery, and postoperative pressures were measured approximately 24 hours after surgery. The group intraocular pressures averaged over preoperative and postoperative values were 21.06 mm Hg in the acetylcholine group, 19.36 mm Hg in the control group, and 17.30 mm Hg in the carbachol group. The average difference between preoperative and postoperative intraocular pressure measurements for the three groups were 7.33 mm Hg for the acetylcholine group, 8.73 mm Hg for the control group, and 2.20 mm Hg for the carbachol group. Only carbachol was significantly different from placebo on statistical subsequent testing. Carbachol is suggested as the agent of choice both for achieving intrasurgical miosis and prophylaxis of increasing intraocular pressure after cataract surgery.\r"

Cerebral antiography documented an arteriovenous malformation of the brainstem in Case 1. Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed a lesion of high signal intensity on T2-weighted images involving the dorsal mesencephalon in Case 2. Involvement of the superior cerebellar peduncle produced ipsilateral dysmetria and ataxia. Lesions involving the fourth cranial nerve nucleus or its fascicles, before decussation in the superior medullary velum, and adjacent sympathetic fibers may produce an ipsilateral Horner's syndrome and contralateral superior oblique muscle paresis.\r"

Ninety-seven percent of 106 undergraduate training programs and 91% of 169 residency programs offered curriculum units in this field. Most of these programs also provided supervised clinical care. Areas of reported faculty dissatisfaction included problems with attitude and interest of psychiatric faculty and with the amount of curriculum time allotted. The authors conclude that although the amount of curriculum time devoted to training in alcoholism and drug abuse is growing, further investment in developing faculty and fellowships is warranted to increase the quality of teaching commitment.\r"

In addition, lifetime history of depression, current mood, and chronic stress were investigated as predictors of maternal interaction. Unipolar depressed women displayed relatively more negative, less positive, and less task-focused behaviour toward their children. Current mood and chronic stress, more than psychiatric history, contributed to the prediction of interaction style.\r"

The results indicated that axis IV functions well as a shorthand method for identifying the more severe psychosocial stressors. However, the DSM-III requirement that the stressor be important in the development or exacerbation of the current disorder resulted in discrepancies between the axis IV and PERI assessments.\r"

The ability of D,L-laudanosine (10(-10) to 5 X 10(-5) M) to displace ligands specific for these receptors from their binding sites was tested. D,L-Laudanosine failed to inhibit the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to central benzodiazepine receptors in the cerebral cortex, the binding of [3H]PK 11195 to peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites in the cerebral cortex and kidney, the binding of [3H]Ro 5-4864 to peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites in the kidney, or the binding of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate to muscarinic receptors in the cerebral cortex.

  ".W": "The performance of three commercially available pulse oximeters was assessed in five anesthetized dogs in which increasing levels of methemoglobin were induced. Hemoglobin oxygen saturation in each dog was monitored with three pulse oximeters (Nellcor N-100, Ohmeda 3700, and Novametrix 500) and a mixed venous saturation pulmonary artery catheter (Oximetrix Opticath). Arterial and mixed venous blood specimens were analyzed for PaO2, PaCO2, and pHa using standard electrodes. An IL-282 Co-oximeter was used on the same specimens to determine oxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin as percentages of total hemoglobin. Methemoglobin levels of up to 60% were induced by intratracheal benzocaine. As MetHb gradually increased while the dogs were breathing 100% inspired oxygen, the pulse oximeter saturation (SpO2) overestimated the fractional oxygen saturation (SaO2) by an amount proportional to the concentration of methemoglobin until the latter reached approximately 35%. At this level the SpO2 values reached a plateau of 84-86% and did not decrease further. When, at fixed methemoglobin levels, additional hemoglobin desaturation was induced by reducing inspired oxygen fraction, SpO2 changed by much less than did SaO2 (regression slopes from 0.16 to 0.32). Thus, at high methemoglobin levels SpO2 tends to overestimate SaO2 by larger amounts at low hemoglobin saturations. Plots of SpO2 versus functional saturation (oxyhemoglobin/reduced hemoglobin plus oxyhemoglobin) show an improved but still poor relationship (regression slopes from 0.32 to 0.46). The Oximetrix Opticath pulmonary artery catheter behaves similarly but provides somewhat better agreement with functional saturation than do the pulse oximeters in the presence of methemoglobinemia. Pulse oximetry data (SpO2) should be used with caution in patients with methemoglobinemia.\r"

Twenty-nine icteric patients (mean total bilirubin 19.2 mg/dl, range 2.3-84.3 mg/dl) were compared with 46 controls. The difference between SpO2 and oxyhemoglobin percentage of hemoglobin (HbO2corr) or fractional saturation as measured by a seven wavelengths Corning Co 2500 Co-oximeter and corrected for the spectral error induced by hyperbilirubinemia in that co-oximeter was greater in icteric patients (bias and precision: 2.9% +/- 2.2% vs. 1.7% +/- 2.7%, P less than 0.03). However, icteric patients had also higher corrected carboxyhemoglobin levels (CoHbcorr) (1.8% +/- 0.7% vs. 1.3% +/- 0.8%, P less than 0.005) due to production of carbon monoxide during the catabolism of hemoglobin. Pulse oximeters read most of CoHb as oxyhemoglobin. After correcting SpO2 for carboxyhemoglobin in both groups of patients, the 99% confidence limits from the obtained regression line were the same in icteric patients (-0.81%, 1.03%) as in controls (-0.89%, 1.08%). There was thus no demonstrable direct influence of high bilirubin plasma levels on SpO2 as measured by a Nellcor pulse oximeter.\r"

Paired blood samples were analyzed by the instrument under test and by standard clinical laboratory instruments. The differences between the measurements of the new and the standard instruments are summarized as follows (mean +/- standard deviation, units of measure, number of samples): pH (-0.039 +/- 0.02, 154); PCO2 (2.63 +/- 1.8 mmHg, 154); venous PO2 (-2.0 +/- 3.0 mmHg, 72), hematocrit (4.7 +/- 2.7%, 98), potassium (0.18 +/- 0.13 mmol, 100), and ionized calcium (0.195 +/- 0.11 mmol, 100). Because the differences in arterial PO2 measurements were markedly heteroscedastic, a logarithmic transformation was employed, which upon retransformation gave the test instrument's 95% confidence limits as within 5.1% below to 46% above the nominal value on 82 samples. However, on the 14 samples having nominal values below 165 mmHg (the upper limit of the calibrated range of the GEM-6) the 95% confidence limits were from 5.4% below to 23.6% above the nominal reading. No failures of the test instrument occurred during the evaluation, and quality control standards run before, midway through, and again after sampling from each patient all gave readings within the manufacturer's tolerance. For all variables except hematocrit and ionized calcium, this instrument matches the values from the laboratory well enough over the clinically important range to supplant it for intraoperative monitoring purposes.\r"

A portocaval shunt preparation enabled the determination of the pharmacodynamics of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants both during temporary liver exclusion and intraportal injection in the same animal. To demonstrate the validity of the model in pigs, in a pilot study the influence of hepatic uptake on neuromuscular blockade by pancuronium (n = 3) and its congener Org 6368 (n = 3) was determined. Thereafter, the influence of hepatic uptake on neuromuscular blockade by gallamine (3.4 mg/kg, n = 5), Org 6368 (0.3 mg/kg, n = 5), and vecuronium (0.1 mg/kg, n = 4 and 0.15 mg/kg, n = 5) was studied in pigs anesthetized with pentobarbital. Each pig received one relaxant, which was injected four consecutive times under different conditions. The first injection was into the jugular vein (iv) the second into the portal vein, the third was iv while the liver was excluded for 10 min and the fourth was iv (control). After each injection the onset time, intensity, recovery rate, and total duration of neuromuscular blockade were measured. These variables were compared between the four injections for each relaxant. In the pilot study the influence of hepatic uptake on neuromuscular blockade was similar for pancuronium and Org 6368. For gallamine the onset time, intensity, recovery rate, and duration of action were similar after all four injections. For Org 6368 the variables of neuromuscular blockade were similar after iv and intraportal injection, but exclusion of the liver prolonged the neuromuscular block.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Intercostal nerve blockade from T6-T12 was produced in seven healthy males to study its effect on: 1) supine pulmonary function, 2) inspiratory effort, 3) hypercapnic ventilatory response, including mouth occlusion pressures with and without an expiratory load, and 4) ventilation during progressive exercise on a cycle ergometer. Studies during control and blocked states were performed on different days. Lower chest and abdominal wall paralysis was documented with electromyography. Findings include a minimal decrease in peak expiratory flows with intercostal blockade (P = 0.02), but no other changes in supine resting pulmonary function tests, inspiratory effort, or hypercapnic ventilatory response slopes. Minute ventilation, respiratory rate, and VT/TI during exercise were also minimally increased, indicating an increase in the drive to breathe, which was unrelated to a change in metabolic rate. During exercise, total time to exhaustion was decreased following intercostal nerve blockade. Bilateral intercostal nerve blockade produced minimal decreases in peak expiratory flow at rest in supine subjects. During seated exercise, there was a slight increase in respiratory drive, probably due to minor alterations in the mechanics of breathing induced by intercostal blockade. The authors conclude that, in healthy young subjects, intercostal nerve blockade does not exert a clinically significant adverse affect on pulmonary mechanics and that ventilatory function is well-maintained even at extremes of ventilatory demand.\r"

Measurements were performed preoperatively and at four specific intraanesthetic intervals: after tracheal intubation, before surgery, and 10 and 30 min after incision. Measurements and sampling sequence took 5-7 min, and therapy for the probable cause of ischemia was instituted following completion of this sequence. Myocardial ischemia was defined as type II or III CKG, 0.1 mV or greater horizontal or downsloping depression of V5 ECG ST segment, 0.2 mV or greater elevation of V5 ECG ST segment, or myocardial lactate production. Thirty-nine patients (74%) had a total of 89 episodes of myocardial ischemia. Seventy-four episodes (83%) were detected by the CKG, 31 (44%) were evident on the ECG, and 13 (15%) by evidence of lactate production. The concordance among the indices of myocardial ischemia was poor. Patients with an abnormal preoperative ECG experienced a greater number of ischemic episodes (P less than 0.001). Elevation of PCWP or the presence of A-C or V-waves greater than 5 mmHg above the mean did not individually reflect ischemia reliably. Intraoperative myocardial ischemia is common in vascular surgical patients and is most sensitively detected by ventricular wall motion abnormality.\r"

The power spectrum of the electroencephalogram (EEG) was used to quantify the effect of the opioids. Eight male surgical patients, 52-80 yr old, were randomly divided into eight groups of ten to receive fentanyl, 5, 7, 10, or 13 micrograms/kg, or sufentanil, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, or 1.3 micrograms/kg. The opioid was given iv over 1 min at a constant rate of infusion. Three to four minutes after the start of the opioid dose, thiopental was given iv in 25 mg increments every 30 s until the patient was unconscious. Power in the 1-3 Hz band reached maximum levels in less than 4 min after the start of opioid administration. At fentanyl doses of 7.0 micrograms/kg or less, or sufentanil doses of 1.0 micrograms/kg or less, the EEG effects did not increase in proportion to the dose of opioid. There was not a significant difference in the maximum power achieved in the 1-3 Hz band for sufentanil, 0.5, 0.7 and 1.0, and fentanyl, 5 and 7 micrograms/kg. Doses of fentanyl, 10 or 13 micrograms/kg, or sufentanil, 1.3 micrograms/kg were substantially more effective; the maximum power increased significantly between 7 and 10 micrograms/kg of fentanyl and 1.0 and 1.3 micrograms/kg of sufentanil (P less than 0.0001). The potency of sufentanil and fentanyl were compared by super-imposing, the dose versus response (power) curves. The potency ratio was 1:8 (sufentanil:fentanyl).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Responses were defined in terms of percentage changes in the evoked twitch tension of the adductor pollicis muscle, and dose-response curves were constructed following probit transformation of the responses. End-tidal concentrations of enflurane during the were study were 0.9-1.2%. When compared with the dose-response curve determined during N2O/fentanyl anesthesia the curve determined during N2O/enflurane anesthesia was displaced significantly to the left (P less than 0.05). As a result, the doses of mivacurium that depressed twitch tension by 50% (ED50) and 95% (ED95) were 39 and 67 micrograms/kg, respectively, during N2O/fentanyl anesthesia, and 27 and 52 micrograms/kg during N2O/enflurane anesthesia. Regression lines describing the relationship between the maximum depression of twitch tension (response) and the time interval between the injection of mivacurium and the return of twitch tension to 90% of the control value (duration) were constructed. The response-duration line for N2O/enflurane anesthesia was displaced significantly to the left of the line for N2O/fentanyl (P less than 0.05), indicating that enflurane anesthesia was associated with a prolongation of mivacurium-induced neuromuscular blockade. The neuromuscular blocking effect of mivacurium is both enhanced by and prolonged during N2O/enflurane compared with that during N2O/fentanyl anesthesia.\r"

Serum sodium, glycine, potassium, chloride, ammonia, osmolality, carbonate, and blood urea nitrogen of 17 patients having TURP and 10 having cystoscopic examination were measured. Electroretinograms and visually evoked potentials (VEPs) were recorded in the preanesthetic preparatory area and in the recovery room immediately after surgery. Four patients reported visual aberrations coincident with increases in serum levels of glycine from a mean before surgery of 137.7 +/- 45.1 to 7,812.2 +/- 2,486.6 microM/l, mean +/- SD, after TURP. These patients also showed a reduction of serum sodium from 138 +/- 4.5 to 122 +/- 8.6 mEq/l that correlated significantly with serum levels of glycine (rho = -0.81). There were no statistically significant changes of serum ammonia and osmolality. Electroretinograms consistently demonstrated complete loss of oscillatory potentials. Thirty hertz flicker-following was also abolished. VEPs were more variably affected with prolongation of component \"P100\" latency found in both groups and probably resulting from sedative effects of diazepam. Patients experiencing the TURP syndrome showed abolishment of 30 Hz flicker-following in their VEPs. The elevated serum levels of glycine may contribute directly to visual aberrations resulting from glycine's role as an inhibitory transmitter in the retina.\r"

The authors recently demonstrated in the canine model a close correlation between actual IAP and the bladder pressure measurements obtained from a transurethral catheter. The purpose of this study was to clinically validate this technique. The authors studied 16 patients, and compared IAP in three positions (supine, with compressions, and semi-erect) utilizing both direct intraperitoneal pressure monitoring and the pressure obtained with a transurethral bladder catheter. Their results demonstrated a linear relationship between the two methods described, with a mean r value of 0.95 in the supine and semi-erect positions, and 0.99 with abdominal compressions (P less than 0.0001). The authors conclude that transurethral monitoring of bladder pressure offers a safe, simple, and highly accurate method for evaluating IAP at the bedside. Studies evaluating the indication for its use in the operating room and intensive care settings appear warranted.\r"

To examine clonidine's acute maternal and fetal effects, the authors injected clonidine, 300 micrograms, epidurally in seven chronically prepared, near term ewes. Unlike epidural saline injection, clonidine increased maternal and fetal serum glucose (by 178 +/- 30% and 190 +/- 30%, respectively; mean +/- SEM, P less than .01) 1 h following injection. Maternal and fetal serum cortisol and arterial blood gas tensions were unchanged following clonidine. Epidural clonidine injection produced minor decreases (10-15%) in heart rate in ewe and fetus, without altering maternal and fetal blood pressure, intra-uterine pressure, or uterine blood flow. Maternal and fetal serum clonidine concentrations peaked at 58 +/- 8 and 73 +/- 5 min following injection, respectively, and declined with similar half-lives. Heart rate correlated negatively with serum clonidine concentration in both ewe and fetus (P less than .05). Apart from hyperglycemia, which does not occur in humans, these results in sheep suggest that epidurally administered clonidine does not adversely affect the fetus and may be evaluated as an analgesic in obstetrics.\r"

As a result, protons come to electrochemical equilibrium across lipid vesicles within tens of minutes. The ability of a series of inhalation anesthetics to enhance the conduction of protons across model membranes was examined. When clinically relevant concentrations of halothane, isoflurane, enflurane, or chloroform were equilibrated with sonicated lipid vesicles, significant increases in the proton conduction were found. However, for even high anesthetic concentrations (above 8 MAC) of ether and cyclopropane, no increases in proton conduction could be detected. These results rule out a common mechanism for general anesthesia involving enhanced proton conduction across membranes.\r"

Spinal cord ischemia was produced by infrarenal balloon occlusion of the aorta in unanesthetized animals. Animals were observed for 3 days for neurologic evaluation. Fasted animals received intravenous dextrose, 0.5 g.kg-1, or placebo before a period spinal cord ischemia. The dextrose was administered as either a bolus of a 50% solution (D50) 15 min before ischemia or as an infusion of a 5% solution (D5W) over 90 min before ischemia. With either mode of administration, preocclusion plasma glucose level was moderately increased as compared with that in animals that received lactated Ringer's solution in equivalent volume, i.e., for the D50 bolus: 291 +/- 82 (SD) versus 166 +/- 67 mg.dl-1 (P less than 0.005); and for D5W infusion: 177 +/- 38 versus 137 +/- 13 mg.dl-1 (P less than 0.01). With either mode of administration, neurologic outcome was poorer (P less than 0.025) at 72 h in the animals that had received dextrose. For example, of the 10 animals that received D5W by infusion, nine were paraplegic (unable to walk) 72 h after ischemia, whereas only three of 10 control animals were paraplegic. The adverse effect of an increased blood glucose level has been demonstrated previously for cerebral ischemia. The present results are the first demonstration that increased plasma glucose may result in a worsened neurologic outcome after spinal cord ischemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty were patients with normal renal function, undergoing a variety of surgical procedures, and 20 were undergoing cadaver renal transplantation because of end-stage renal disease. Plasma concentrations of pipecuronium were measured for 6 h after administration using a sensitive and specific capillary gas chromatographic assay. Plasma concentration versus time data were analyzed by nonlinear regression and fit to a two-compartment or three-compartment model; in addition, the data were analyzed by a non-compartmental method based on statistical moments. Neuromuscular blockade was assessed by measuring the mechanical evoked response of the adductor pollicis muscle to train-of-four stimulation of the ulnar nerve. The pharmacokinetic parameters derived by compartmental modelling were (normal vs. renal failure, respectively): volume of distribution at steady state (309 +/- 103 vs. 442 +/- 158 ml.kg-1, mean +/- SD), plasma clearance, (2.4 +/- 0.6 vs. 1.6 +/- 0.6 ml.kg-1.min-1), mean residence time (140 +/- 63 vs. 329 +/- 198 min), and elimination half-life (137 +/- 68 vs. 263 +/- 168 min). The same parameters as derived by the non-compartmental method were (normal vs. renal failure, respectively): volume of distribution at steady state (307 +/- 80 vs. 426 +/- 119 ml.kg-1, mean +/- SD), plasma clearance (2.4 +/- 0.6 vs. 1.6 +/- 0.6 ml.kg-1.min-1), mean residence time (134 +/- 41 vs. 323 +/- 228 min), and elimination half-life (118 +/- 35 vs. 247 +/- 168 min).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Possible development of tachyphylaxis to local anesthetics in the nerve itself (time-dependent change in axonal conduction properties) was studied in the aortic nerve of eight rabbits anesthetized with urethane. The nerve was immersed in Tyrode solution with or without bupivacaine at pH 7.4 and 38 degrees C in a trough molded from the surrounding tissues. After control measurements the nerve was exposed to increasing bupivacaine concentrations until complete nerve block at minimal blocking concentration. Subsequently, bupivacaine concentrations were reduced and kept constant for 4 h (partial block). Finally, intact nerve function was confirmed after bupivacaine washout with Tyrode solution. For quantification total nerve activity was recorded continuously and related to drug concentrations. Two findings argue against the occurrence of tachyphylaxis at the nerve itself: 1) nerve activity decreased rather than increased over time in the presence of constant bupivacaine concentrations during partial block; and 2) for the same bupivacaine concentration, nerve activity during partial block was always lower than during the initial blocking experiments. Thus, drug effectiveness increased rather than decreased over time, which cannot be reconciled with the theory that tachyphylaxis might be mediated by changes in axonal conduction properties.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of halothane on maximal and submaximal Ca2+-activated tension development of the contractile proteins of newborn and adult cardiac muscle from rabbits was determined. Right ventricular muscle was removed from newborn and adult rabbits, and the sarcolemma was disrupted (skinned) by homogenization. Fiber bundles were dissected from the homogenate and mounted on tension transducers. Fiber bundles were alternately immersed in relaxing solution [( Ca2+] less than 10(-9) M) and contracting solutions (various [Ca2+] from 10(-5.6) to 10(-3.8) M), which were saturated with 100% N2 alone or with three concentrations of halothane-N2 mixture. In the absence of halothane, newborn skinned myocardial fibers were slightly more sensitive to submaximal Ca2+ concentrations than were adult myocardial fibers. [Ca2+] required for 50% maximum tension were 10(-5.43) M and 10(-5.31) M, respectively (P less than 0.05). Halothane (1-3%) decreased the maximal Ca2+-activated tension (at [Ca2+] = 10(-3.8) M) similarly in adult and newborn myocardial fibers in a dose-dependent fashion. Tension was reduced by 5.9% for each 1% increase in halothane concentration. Halothane also decreased the sensitivity of adult myocardial skinned fibers to submaximal Ca2+ concentrations (10(-5.6) M to 10(-5.0) M) by shifting the Ca2+-tension response curve to the right. Only 3% halothane decreased the sensitivity of newborn myocardial skinned fibers to Ca2+. The authors conclude that halothane causes less depression of Ca2+ activation of the contractile proteins in newborn than adult rabbit myocardium and that this effect of halothane cannot account for greater negative inotropy of halothane in the newborn.\r"

This study was undertaken to determine the effects of negative inotropic drugs used during anesthesia on different areas of the left ventricle. Forty mongrel dogs were anesthetized and instrumented for measurement of global and regional function. Regional function in the short axis of the basal and apical territories of the left ventricle was assessed by subendocardial sonomicrometry. Three different interventions were performed: In the first group 67% N2O, replacing 67% N2, was added to opiate anesthesia; in the second group halothane was given by stepwise increases in inspired concentration to 2%; in the third group verapamil (60 micrograms.kg-1.h-1) was infused during isoflurane anesthesia. Apical and basal segmental shortening were compared. During baseline conditions and with agents in concentrations that caused minimal myocardial depression (67% N2O or 1.0% as opposed to 0.5% halothane) differences in systolic shortening between regions were statistically significant. Further myocardial depression affected the apex significantly more than the base: when substantial myocardial depression was induced by halothane (1.5 or 2%) or verapamil, differences in regional function were abolished. Thus, the apical region of the left ventricle is more dynamic and more sensitive to negative inotropic interventions than the basal region. This should be borne in mind when segmental myocardial function is evaluated.\r"

This study investigated the effects, in mice, of the dihydropyridine Ca++ antagonist, nitrendipine, on acute tolerance to nitrous oxide after 60 min exposure to anesthetizing concentrations, and also the withdrawal syndrome which occurred following removal from nitrous oxide. Control mice were anesthetized by nitrous oxide concentrations in the range 1.28-1.51 atmospheres. Nitrendipine 10, 50, and 100 mg.kg-1, i.p., produced a dose-dependent potentiation of nitrous oxide anesthesia (P less than 0.05 for nitrendipine 50 and 100 mg.kg-1). Tolerance to nitrous oxide anesthesia developed over 60 min (13% increase in ED50, P less than 0.05). Concurrent administration of nitrendipine at all doses prevented the development of nitrous oxide tolerance. After 60 min exposure to nitrous oxide 1-1.5 atmospheres, all control mice showed handling seizures. Nitrendipine diminished or prevented nitrous oxide withdrawal seizures, in a dose-dependent manner (P less than 0.05 for nitrendipine 50 and 100 mg.kg-1). These results support the importance of the role of dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca++ channels in the mechanism of tolerance and dependence to central depressant drugs. They also suggest that acute and chronic tolerance to sedative drug action may share some common pathways, and that tolerance and physical dependence may share a common mechanism through voltage-operated Ca++ channels.\r"

FEV1 and MEF75 values were measured 15', 30', one hour, and two hours post-drug inhalation. Statistical analysis (ANOVA) showed that clenbuterol delivered by DDS, administered by patients or by physician, produced a greater increase in FEV1 values (P less than .05) and MEF75 values (P less than .01) in comparison to the conventional MDI on each test day. No significant differences existed between physician or patient administration of clenbuterol with DDS and MDI.

PGE1 decreased systemic arterial mean pressure (-16%) and pulmonary arterial mean pressure (-15%) and increased cardiac index (+20%) and heart rate (+11%). Arterial PO2 decreased from 99 +/- 6 to 77 +/- 8 mm Hg (p less than 0.01, mean +/- SEM) with no change in mixed venous PO2 and in O2 consumption. PGE1 increased true shunt from 21 +/- 4 to 32 +/- 5% of total blood flow (p less than 0.01) with no significant modification in the pattern of VA/Q distribution. Thus, in ARDS, pulmonary hypertension is reduced by PGE1 at the price of a deterioration in pulmonary gas exchange. The clinical relevance of these findings remains to be evaluated.\r"

Changes of the pulmonary vascular tone were determined on the pulmonary driving pressure/flow curve, which was generated by upright exercise. Fifteen patients with COPD and mean pulmonary pressure greater than or equal to 20 mm Hg were studied at control (Week 0) and after 1 wk of nifedipine treatment (180 mg daily, Week 1). It was possible to pursue the same nifedipine daily dosage for 2 months in 10 patients, who were re-evaluated after 8 wk of treatment and after nifedipine withdrawal the following week. At Week 1, mean pulmonary transmural pressure was reduced (32.8 +/- 4.1 versus 27.3 +/- 2.8 mm Hg, mean +/- SE, p less than 0.05) via active pulmonary vasodilation because the pulmonary driving pressure/flow curve was shifted right and downward. Both mean transmural pulmonary pressure lowering effect and active pulmonary vasodilatation regressed during long-term nifedipine treatment. Oxygen reduced pulmonary transmural pressure (32.8 +/- 4.1 versus 28.6 +/- 2.9 mm Hg, p less than 0.05, Week 0); however, this effect always disappeared during nifedipine treatment. We conclude that nifedipine should not be used as long-term treatment for COPD-related pulmonary hypertension and that nifedipine inhibits the oxygen capability to reduce pulmonary pressure.\r"

We used perfused, contracting, intact rat diaphragm to measure the influence of therapeutic theophylline levels (10(-4) M) on tension development, in the presence or absence of the three most commonly used calcium channel blocking agents, or in the absence of calcium. Concentrations of diltiazem (10(-4) M), verapamil (10(-5) M), or nifedipine (10(-6) M) sufficient to completely block transmembrane calcium channels, were used. During the experiment, each diaphragm preparation was subjected to one of two fatiguing procedures: one to mimic that encountered during tachypnea and one to mimic that encountered during increased respiratory resistance. Our findings showed that therapeutic levels of theophylline were related to statistically significant (p less than 0.0005) increases in diaphragmatic contractility under control conditions and to statistically significant reductions in the sensitivity of the preparation to fatigue. All three calcium channel blockers negated the positive influence of theophylline. Zero calcium also prevented theophylline from enhancing the contractile properties of the diaphragm. It is our conclusion that theophylline enhances the contractile properties of the diaphragm by altering the transmembrane movement of calcium. Calcium antagonists, in turn, inhibit the beneficial effects of theophylline on diaphragm function.\r"

Although the role of these bacteria in the pathogenesis of the disease is uncertain, their accurate identification is important for epidemiologic and treatment purposes. Therefore, the aims of this study were: (1) to identify these bacteria in patients with bronchiectasis without cystic fibrosis using the protected catheter brush (PCB) in order to avoid oropharyngeal contamination, and (2) to compare the results of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) with PCB. Quantitative culture was performed on PCB and BAL specimens obtained from the most severely affected lobes of 23 patients with bronchiectasis. Results of PCB showed no significant growth (less than 10(3) colony-forming units [cfu]/ml) in nine patients and 17 significant isolates (greater than 10(3) cfu/ml) in the rest: H. influenzae, 5; P. aeruginosa, 4; K. ozaenae, 2; S. aureus, 2; P. fluorescens, 1; S. pneumoniae, 1; Veillonella, 1; and coag.-ve Staph., 1. For BAL, the results were the same (20 isolates) regardless of whether 10(4) or 10(5) cfu/ml was chosen as the cutoff point. More organisms were cultured from BAL specimens, and these included all but one of the organisms cultured from PCB. We conclude that the bacteriology of bronchiectasis in Hong Kong is different from that reported in sputum studies in the West (mainly H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and S. aureus), and with 10(4) cfu/ml as the cutoff point, BAL gives comparable results to PCB.\r"

  ".U": "89104034\r", 
  ".W": "Paralysis of the diaphragm promotes an increase in the activation of the rib cage inspiratory muscles, and previous studies have suggested that this compensation is primarily due to vagal mechanisms (6). To test this hypothesis, we have assessed the effect of diaphragmatic paralysis on the electrical response of 19 parasternal intercostal muscles in eight anesthetized, vagotomized, spontaneously breathing dogs in the supine posture. Complete diaphragmatic paralysis was induced by section of the C5, C6, and C7 phrenic nerve roots in the neck. With the animals breathing room air, diaphragmatic paralysis resulted in a mean 94% increase in the peak height of integrated parasternal activity (p less than 0.001) associated with a 14 mm Hg decrease in arterial PO2 (p less than 0.05) and an 8 mm Hg increase in arterial PCO2 (p less than 0.001). The augmented parasternal activity was unrelated to the duration of inspiration and persisted when the animals were given a hyperoxic gas mixture. Thus the rib cage inspiratory muscles still compensate for diaphragmatic paralysis in the absence of vagal signals and of hypoxemia. This compensation probably results from the considerably augmented CO2 load placed on the extradiaphragmatic muscles.\r"

Five normal subjects exercised to maximal volitional effort and flow:volume and pressure:volume loops, and end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) and breathing pattern were measured. All subjects increased expiratory flow rate and reduced EELV sufficiently so that the forced vital capacity loop was approximated during at least some portion of expiration, but the generation of pleural pressure remained effective, i.e., equal to or only slightly in excess of that required to produce maximal expiratory flow (Pmax). Subsequently, while at rest, subjects used visual feedback and were able to closely mimic the flow:volume, EELV, and breath-timing achieved in maximal exercise; however: (1) expiratory pressures were excessive and usually exceeded average Pmax; (2) abdominal expiratory muscle activity was increased, as indicated by positive shifts in expiratory gastric pressure; and (3) total ventilatory work was increased 15 to 40% greater than that achieved in maximal exercise. Maximal voluntary efforts (MVV) caused EELV to increase and ventilatory work was increased 20 to 300% greater than during maximal exercise. We conclude that accurate determination of maximal effective ventilatory output available for maximal exercise or precise quantitation of the metabolic cost of producing maximal exercise ventilation requires replication of the pressure:volume, breath-timing, and EELV characteristics achieved in maximal exercise.\r"

Although clinical improvement occurs over several months, symptoms such as fatigue and dyspnea persist in many patients in the long term. To determine whether continued respiratory muscle weakness might contribute to these symptoms, we compared lung function tests, respiratory muscle strength, and exercise performance in 13 patients 2 years after type B botulism. We found that residual symptoms including dyspnea and fatigue were common in botulism patients at 2 years postintoxication. Lung function tests had returned to normal in all patients. Maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures were similar between botulism patients and control subjects. Evaluation of individual results showed evidence of inspiratory muscle weakness in four of 13 patients with botulism (Plmax less than 65% predicted). Maximal oxygen consumption and maximal workload during exercise were reduced in botulism patients in comparison to control subjects. During exercise, botulism patients had a more rapid and shallow breathing pattern and a higher dyspnea score at a given minute ventilation in comparison to control subjects. Reasons for premature exercise termination in botulism patients were multifactorial. Although respiratory muscle weakness may have been contributory in some patients, most appeared to be limited by reduced cardiovascular fitness, leg fatigue, or reduced motivation.\r"

As increased ventilatory drive is often associated with augmented upper airway dilating muscle activity, we evaluated in anesthetized dogs the effect of salicylate on the electrical activity of three upper airway muscles, the alae nasi, the genioglossus, and the posterior cricoarytenoid. The electromyograms of these muscles were compared with those of the diaphragm before and at 15-min intervals after intravenous salicylate administration (250 mg/kg). Salicylate induced a gradual increase in ventilation and in the electrical activity of all muscles examined (p less than 0.001). Compared to baseline activity, salicylate increased the electrical activity of the genioglossus more than that of the diaphragm (p less than 0.01). The increase in upper airway muscle activity was observed also in vagotomized dogs, and was not accounted for by changes in arterial blood gases or pH. Increases in upper airway muscle electrical activity were associated with a significant decrease in upper airway resistance to airflow (mean reduction of 62 +/- 7% SE, p less than 0.01). The preferential increase in genioglossus electrical activity and the decrease in upper airway resistance observed in this study with salicylate suggest that salicylate, and possibly other pharmacologic agents that stimulate ventilation, may improve upper airway patency.\r"

Its association with pneumonitis is well established, but the mechanism of lung injury is unknown. To clarify this issue, we performed bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in six patients with MTX pneumonitis and in three control groups. In those with drug-induced pneumonitis, there was a significant increase in the total number of lavage cells recovered as well as in the percentage and absolute number of lymphocytes compared with those in the other groups. Patients receiving the drug without evidence for pulmonary toxicity had lavage findings that were not different from those in the other control groups. The ratio of BAL phenotypic helper/suppressor T-cells was studied in three patients with MTX toxicity and was found to be increased compared with that in normal healthy control subjects. Our findings show that MTX pneumonitis is characterized by a lymphocytic alveolitis with a predominance of phenotypic helper T-cells and a relative deficiency in the percentage of suppressor T-cells. The presence of increased lavage lymphocytes suggests that an immunologically mediated injury rather than a direct toxic effect of this drug may be a significant pathophysiologic mechanism in this disorder.\r"

Fractionation and reconstitution experiments revealed that LECL originated predominantly from polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL). Circulating total leukocyte counts and serum thiocyanate levels were also determined. The data were analyzed using Spearman's correlation coefficient and by multiple regression analysis. Cigarette smoking was associated with elevated intracellular and especially extracellular LECL responses, the latter being strongly correlated (p less than 0.0001) with cigarettes smoked per day, serum thiocyanate levels, circulating leukocytes, and PMNL counts. Abnormalities of the spirometric parameters FEV1/FVC, FEF50/FVC, FEF25, FEF25-75, and FEF75-85 correlated best with extracellular LECL (p less than 0.0002 to p less than 0.0001), but also with pack-years (p less than 0.006 to p less than 0.0001), cigarettes smoked per day (p less than 0.008 to p less than 0.0002), thiocyanate levels (p less than 0.04 to p less than 0.002) and leukocyte counts (p less than 0.03 to p less than 0.002). According to stepwise multiple regression analysis of the data the combination of the independent variables extracellular LECL, pack-years, and numbers of circulating PMNL accounts for 35.6% of the variation in lung function in the group of cigarette smokers, with LECL being the most important contributor (26%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In asthmatic patients, LTC4 produced oxygen desaturation on two occasions. At a lower dose (2.0 nmol) LTC4 produced a marked fall in SaO2% that lasted less than 15 min and occurred in the absence of significant bronchoconstriction as measured by changes in FEV1, FEF25-75, and SGaw. At a higher cumulative dose (7 nmol), LTC4 caused prolonged oxygen desaturation with slow recovery and this was associated with significant bronchoconstriction. In contrast, histamine inhalation produced a single response with a fall in both FEV1 and SaO2% of short duration. The dose-response characteristics of LTC4 and histamine on oxygen desaturation in asthmatic patients appear to differ significantly and probably are dependent on relative sensitivities of pulmonary vascular and bronchial smooth muscle to these agonists. A single inhaled dose of LTC4 in nonasthmatic subjects produced a marked drop in PaO2 with significant increase in AaPO2, and this was associated with a mean (SEM) decrease in FEV1 of 14% (2.5) from the baseline. The mean cardiac output fell by 15% (3.4) without significant changes in blood pressure and heart rate. There was no electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial ischemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

NK cells were enumerated by flow cytometry using the monoclonal antibody anti-Leu 11A. Cigarette smokers had a significantly lower proportion of NK cells than did subjects who had never smoked (5.5 +/- 0.3% versus 7.4 +/- 0.4% of lymphoid cells; p = 0.0002). NK cells were also decreased among ex-smokers (5.6 +/- 0.4%; p = 0.002), including subjects who had not smoked for more than 20 yr. The white blood cell and lymphocyte counts were increased in smokers compared with those in never smokers (p less than 0.0001). In contrast to NK cells, the smoking-related changes in leukocyte count were not present in ex-smokers, even those who had stopped smoking within the past year. Multivariate analysis confirmed that both current and past smokers had significant decreases in both the number and proportion of NK cells after controlling for age, sex, and lymphocyte count. These data indicate that cigarette smoking is associated with a decrease in the number and proportion of circulating NK cells, and that this effect is present many years after smoking cessation. This quantitative NK cell deficit may contribute to the elevated risk of malignancy in this population.\r"

Complement biosynthesis by A549 pneumocytes and WI-38 fibroblasts was demonstrated by incorporation of [35S]methionine into immunoprecipitable complement proteins. Using this technique, A549 pneumocytes were demonstrated to synthesize Clr, Cls, C4, C3, C5, C6, C7, C8, C9, Factor B, Factor H, Factor I, and C1s inactivator. In comparison, WI-38 fibroblasts were shown to synthesize Cls, C4, C3, C5, C6, C8, and C9. Because previous work has demonstrated the central role of C3, C5, and their activation products in regulating lung inflammation and tissue injury, we further investigated the production of C3 and C5 by both lung pneumocytes and fibroblasts using enzyme-linked immunospecific assays. A549 cells cultured in the presence of 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS) produced antigenic C3 (135 ng C3/ml/24 h) at a greater rate than did identical cells maintained in serum-free culture conditions (70 ng C3/ml/24 h).

The number of arrested mitoses noted was significantly increased in rats at 4 wk after irradiation compared with that in control animals (p less than 0.05).

Despite small differences in the mean linear intercept seen at 1 and at 16 months, both male and female tsk mice were found to be similarly susceptible to the development of the emphysematous lesion. Three main phases were observed in the evolution of the emphysema. The first phase, from 4 days to 2 months after birth, included enlargement of the peripheral lung units, already evident at 4 and at 15 days, and destruction of the lung parenchyma, which occurred between 15 days and 1 month and rapidly progressed for as long as 2 months. A second phase of stabilization or of mild progression of the emphysematous lesion occurred between 2 and 8 months of age. A third phase, in the advanced age between 8 and 16 months, included a further exacerbation of the parenchymal destruction. At 16 months of age, the lungs of the pa mice also showed some patchy areas of air-space enlargement with destruction of the alveolar septa.\r"

Roentgenographically, an initial diffuse, pin-point micronodularity subsequently becomes associated with conglomerates, usually in the upper lobes, closely resembling the progressive massive fibrosis (PMF) of the pneumoconioses. The lower lobes, on the other hand, become relatively translucent, in some instances with bulla formation and the development of pneumothorax. Pulmonary function, initially with both restrictive and obstructive features, eventually becomes markedly obstructive with hyperinflation and air trapping. At this late stage, pathologic examination reveals emphysema in addition to the granulomatous inflammation and fibrosis surrounding the talc particles in the pulmonary interstitium.\r"

The airways in postmortem specimens of lung obtained from 18 patients who suffered from asthma were compared to similar airways from 23 patients without asthma. Each airway was projected onto a digitizing board of a microcomputer to trace the internal and external perimeter of the airway and to calculate the submucosal and mucosal thicknesses. The relaxed length of the airway smooth muscle and the shortening required to occlude the airway lumen were calculated. These data show that the wall area was greater (p less than 0.001) in the membranous and cartilaginous airways of asthmatic patients and the airway smooth muscle shortening required to occlude the lumen was less in asthmatic than nonasthmatic airways (p less than 0.001). The increased wall area was due to increased areas of epithelium, muscle, and submucosa. We conclude that the walls of the airways of patients with asthma are thickened by chronic inflammation and that this thickening could be as important as smooth muscle shortening in determining the airway responsiveness of these patients.\r"

  ".W": "A 59-yr-old man was given over a 30-month period a cumulative dose of 36 g of propranolol for treatment of angina pectoris. He then presented with respiratory disease, having all the clinical, radiologic, and functional characteristics of interstitial pneumonitis. No other cause of pneumonitis was found. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) showed a lymphocytic alveolitis with lymphocyte subset inverted ratio. After a 9-wk period of drug withdrawal, clinical and radiologic improvement was observed along with resolution of BAL abnormalities. Propranolol therapy was resumed for 6 wk and induced the recurrence of BAL abnormalities. Propranolol treatment was finally stopped, and 15 wk later, clinical symptoms abated, chest roentgenogram and pulmonary function tests were improved, and BAL data returned to normal. This observation seems to exemplify the possible diagnostic value of coupling provocation test with BAL cell data in some hypersensitivity pneumonitis induced by drugs. In addition, these data support the role of a cell-mediated immunologic mechanism in the pathogenesis of propranolol-induced pneumonitis.\r"

  ".W": "To determine if a relationship exists between maximal static respiratory pressures measured at the mouth and age greater than 55 yr, and if so, whether regression equations can be derived that accurately reflect this, we measured maximal inspiratory (Plmax) and expiratory (PEmax) pressures in 64 normal women and 40 normal men older than 55 yr of age. We found no relationship between PImax and PEmax and age greater than 55 yr (all r squared values less than 0.14). We tested the reproducibility of our measurements of PImax and PEmax in 13 and 12 subjects, respectively, on three separate occasions. Repeated measures analysis showed no significant differences in these measurements. Using the measurements obtained in this large study, we calculated 95% confidence limits for PImax and PEmax values in men and women older than 55 yr of age. The 95% confidence limits for PImax in men were 55 to 161 cm H2O, and 26 to 124 cm H2O in women. The 95% confidence limits for PEmax in men were 90 to 256 cm H2O, and 46 to 184 cm H2O in women. We conclude that given the large interindividual variation, a cross-sectional study such as this or other previous studies may not be able to reveal age-dependent changes unless very large numbers are used, and even then potential for bias exists. However, with the small intraindividual coefficients of variation in repeated measurements of PImax and PEmax, a longitudinal study may provide more pertinent information.\r"

  ".W": "Inflammatory cells and lymphocyte populations were examined in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, lung tissues, and peripheral blood from rats at various times after the intratracheal instillation of silica. In lavage fluid, there was a rapid initial increase in the percentage and number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), which slowly decreased during the course of the experiment. In addition, compared to controls, there was an increased number and percentage of lymphocytes throughout the 75 days of the experiment. The lymphocytic populations, which were determined by an indirect immunofluorescence method with monoclonal antibodies to lymphocyte surface markers, showed a predominance of the T-helper phenotype from Day 14 through the end of the experiment (Day 75). The number of PMNs obtained from collagenase digest of the lung was increased over control levels up to Day 7 after silica administration and remained at a relatively constant level until Day 14, after which time they decreased slightly in number. The total number of lymphocytes peaked on Day 14, with cells of the T-helper phenotype predominating after this time. In the peripheral blood, T-helper cells from silicotic rats were significantly increased over control rats on Days 7 and 14 but returned to normal control values after this time. The lymphocyte subsets in the BAL, but not in the peripheral blood, more closely reflect the lymphocyte patterns in the lung. The results of these experiments suggest that T-helper cells may play an important role in the inflammatory-fibrotic events in the lungs of rats with silicosis.\r"

None of the AEW had clinical, radiographic, or physiologic evidence of asbestosis, but six had radiographic evidence of pleural plaques and/or thickening. The mean duration of asbestos exposure was 16.3 +/- 2.3 yr, and the mean period since exposure was 10.8 +/- 0.5 yr. All but three of the AEW and none of the UEW had asbestos bodies detected in the first 20 ml of BAL fluid recovered (0.1 to 35 asbestos bodies/ml). The AEW had a significantly higher mean percentage (19.1 +/- 2.8% versus 9.7 +/- 1.6%) and concentration (31.6 +/- 5.2 x 10(3) cells/ml versus 14.7 +/- 2.5 x 10(3) cells/ml) of BAL lymphocytes compared with that in the UEW, with an increased mean concentration of each phenotype measured. In PB, the mean lymphocyte concentration was also higher in the AEW than in the UEW (2.0 +/- 0.3 x 10(3) cells/ml versus 1.5 +/- 0.3 x 10(3) cells/ml), but the difference was not statistically significant, and there was no increase of any phenotype measured. BAL lymphocytosis did not correlate with exposure history or BAL asbestos body count, but was greater in AEW with pleural abnormality (30.1 +/- 2.9% versus 11.8 +/- 1.6%). BAL concentrations of CD-20, CD-3, and CD-4, but not of CD-8 cells were significantly increased compared with those in the AEW without pleural abnormality. Further longitudinal studies are needed to determine the prognostic significance of these findings.\r"

Between 1981 and 1987, 2,269 cases were reported. In 96% of cases, infection was caused by M. avium complex (MAC). The number of cases has risen steadily since 1981, but the rate as a percentage of AIDS cases has remained stable at 5.5%. DNTM was seen less frequently in AIDS cases with Kaposi's sarcoma than in other AIDS cases (p less than 0.01). Rates of DNTM were lower in Hispanics and declined with age but were not significantly different by patient sex or means of acquiring HIV infection. Rates of disseminated MAC varied by geographic region from 3.9% to 7.8% (p less than 0.0001). As assessed by helper/suppressor T-cell ratios, AIDS patients with DNTM were not more immunologically impaired than those with other opportunistic infections. Life table analysis revealed that AIDS patients with DNTM survived a shorter time (median, 7.4 months) than did other AIDS patients (median, 13.3 months; p less than 0.0001). We conclude that DNTM is acquired by unpreventable environmental exposures. Because DNTM adversely affects survival of AIDS patients, effective therapeutic agents must be vigorously sought.\r"

If GER triggers asthma and asthma causes GER, a vicious circle could arise with an increase in the severity of asthma symptoms. The aim of this investigation was to determine whether postprandial reflux in asthmatics with GER disease is increased during histamine-induced bronchospasm and also if theophylline increases GER during provoked episodes of bronchospasm. Ten patients with chronic asthma and pathologic GER were challenged with either histamine or saline in randomized order with and without their regular dose of oral slow-release theophylline. FEV1 was recorded at regular intervals during the hour of provocation, and acid reflux (pH less than 4) was monitored by antimony pH electrodes in the esophagus. GER was not more pronounced during the provoked bronchospasm period irrespective of theophylline treatment or not. It seems unlikely that mild bronchospasm provokes reflux in patients with asthma and GER. It would appear that mild bronchospasm is rather protective against gastroesophageal reflux.\r"

A series of as many as six measurements were obtained for each child over approximately a 2-month period beginning in February 1981. Concurrent measurements of ambient ozone, and fine particle and fine sulfate concentrations were obtained at a site near the study community. The maximal hourly ozone concentration observed during the study was 78 ppb. Child-specific linear regressions were fit that related short-term pulmonary function changes to air pollution or temperature. We found that decrements in FVC, FEV75, MMEF, and Vmax75 were associated with ozone, but not with particulate levels. Decrements in FVC, MMEF, and Vmax75 were also associated with temperature. Although slopes of pulmonary function on ozone varied across children, in general there was no evidence that this variation represented heterogeneity of response as opposed to random estimation errors. In addition, no evidence was found that individual response to ozone was related to sex, presence of asthma, respiratory illness before 2 yr of age, or the MMEF/FVC ratio, a rough surrogate for airway size. We conclude that ambient exposures to ozone at levels well below the National Ambient Air Quality Standard of 120 ppb are associated with transient decreases in lung function, the long-term significance of which is uncertain.\r"

The current study aimed to establish whether BHR to histamine can be demonstrated in normal infants. Twelve infants, mean age of 7.8 months (range, 3 to 18 months), were studied. None had any history of a previous significant respiratory illness. Respiratory function was monitored using the maximal flow at function residual capacity (VmaxFRC) obtained with the forced expiratory flow-volume technique. Histamine was inhaled in doubling concentrations from 0.125 to 8 g.L-1. A greater than 30% fall in VmaxFRC was considered a response. All infants responded to histamine, the geometric mean concentration for their response being 1.4 g.L-1. Associated transient changes for the group were an increase in respiratory rate (p less than 0.02) and a fall in SaO2 (p less than 0.001). Forced expiratory flow-volume curves were concave in all infants after the last dose of histamine. We speculate that humans are born with \"bronchial hyperresponsiveness\" and that genetic or environmental factors determine which infants lose it thereafter.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effect of beta-adrenoceptor blockade and residual alpha-adrenoceptor effects during sympathetic stimulation on mast cell secretion of histamine in 12 natively allergic mongrel dogs. Bronchial mast cell response was measured as the arteriovenous difference (AVd) in plasma histamine concentration [H] across the bronchus. Plasma [H] was determined simultaneously from the azygos outflow tract and femoral artery as a marker of mast cell response prior to and for 90 s after intra-arterial injection of sham diluent and 1:100 and 1:30 dilutions of Ascaris suum antigen. Sympathetic (alpha-adrenergic) stimulation was elicited with continuous infusion of the nicotinic agonist, dimethylphenylpiperazinium (DMPP) under conditions of muscarinic blockade with atropine and beta-adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol. Plasma epinephrine (EPI) increased from 315 +/- 106 to 34,127 +/- 10,711 pg/ml (p less than 0.02). Control animals receiving sham infusion in place of sympathetic stimulation additionally had neural blockade with hexamethonium and alpha-adrenoceptor blockade with phentolamine. Plasma EPI was 90 +/- 58 pg/ml and did not change significantly during mast cell degranulation. Significant AVd in [H] was elicited after 1:30 A. suum antigen in both control (72.9 +/- 12.5 ng/ml versus 2.8 +/- 10.1 ng/ml at baseline; p = 0.031) and beta-adrenergically blocked (alpha-stimulated) (106.1 +/- 20.1 versus -1.5 +/- 35.9 ng/ml at baseline; p = 0.031) animals. However, alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation did not elicit significantly augmented secretion of [H]. We demonstrate that beta-adrenoceptor blockade blocks completely the inhibition of mast cell secretion caused by sympathetic stimulation with DMPP. However, alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation does not cause significant augmentation of mast cell secretion in the large airways of the dog.\r"

SETTING: Veterans hospital coronary care unit. PATIENTS: Eleven patients with decompensated class III or IV heart failure. INTERVENTIONS: A bolus of intravenous amrinone followed by a continuous infusion at 10 micrograms/kg.min for 72 hours. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At 24 to 36 hours there was a reduction in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (35%), right atrial pressure (20%), and systemic vascular resistance (25%) with an increase in cardiac output (30%). By 72 hours all these parameters had returned nearly to baseline levels. This partial cardiovascular tolerance to amrinone was accompanied by a 126% increase in the plasma epinephrine, a 182% increase in norepinephrine, a 31% decrease in the number of beta-adrenergic receptors on lymphocytes, and a 36% decrease in isoproterenol-stimulated cyclicadenosine monophosphate on lymphocytes. The number of sequestered receptors doubled during the treatment, and the extent of sequestration correlated well with the extent of receptor down-regulation. CONCLUSIONS: The hemodynamic responses to amrinone had virtually returned to baseline by 72 hours. This tolerance was accompanied by increased plasma catecholamines, and a down-regulation, desensitization, and sequestration of beta-adrenergic receptors on lymphocytes. We suggest that these receptor changes also occur in cardiovascular tissues and may in part account for the tolerance to amrinone.\r"

INTERVENTIONS: Cocaine hydrochloride (0.15 mg/g body weight) was administered intravenously with no other interventions; with propranolol hydrochloride intravenously (0.5 mg per mouse) before and after cocaine; and with phentolamine intravenously (10.5 micrograms per mouse) before cocaine.

Cocaine hydrochloride always resulted in the accumulation of transudative ascitic fluid (saline controls, no measurable ascitic fluid; cocaine administration, 20.2 +/- 12.9 micrograms per mouse; ascitic fluid protein concentration, 23.5 +/- 8.5 g/L).

CONCLUSIONS: Massive cocaine intoxication is associated with increased lung water and transudative ascites. Fluid accumulation is not prevented by either alpha- or beta-adrenergic blockers. Propranolol, administered either before or after cocaine, sharply reduces mortality. The results should be extrapolated to treatment in humans with caution.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To image and identify by noninvasive methods the sites of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) catabolism in patients with myeloproliferative disease in whom chronic hypocholesterolemia was previously reported. STUDY DESIGN: The 99mTechnetium-LDL (Tc-LDL) distribution in patients with myeloproliferative diseases was compared with that in normal subjects. The Tc-LDL distribution was also compared with the distribution and organ uptake of a macrophage-seeking radiotracer. 99mTc-sulfur colloid (Tc-SC). SETTING: Major metropolitan referral center and institutional practice. PATIENTS: Three normal subjects, two patients with polycythemia vera, two with post polycythemia myeloid metaplasia, and one with agnogenic myeloid metaplasia. The patients were being managed with hydroxyurea or phlebotomy. INTERVENTION: Ten mCi of Tc-LDL (homologous) was injected intravenously. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Gamma camera images of Tc-LDL biodistribution and organ uptake were obtained 4 hours after injection of the tracer. In normal subjects, the Tc-LDL was predominantly taken up by the liver, with relative nonvisualization of spleen and central or peripheral marrow. Patients with myeloproliferative disease showed marked splenic uptake of Tc-LDL. Peripheral bone marrow uptake extended to the lower tibia in two patients with post-polycythemia myeloid metaplasia. Splenic and bone marrow uptake paralleled that of Tc-SC. Hypercellularity of central and peripheral marrow at the sites of Tc-LDL uptake was confirmed by biopsy specimens. The Tc-LDL uptake, however, was not correlated with collagen fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that spleen and bone marrow are sites of LDL catabolism in patients with myeloproliferative disease and suggest the role of macrophages in the hypocholesterolemia and accelerated LDL catabolism of myeloproliferative disease.\r"

Percutaneous CPB involves a modified Seldinger technique that is easily applied. All patients except those with massive trauma were resuscitated with the use of percutaneous CPB. One patient requiring a very difficult proposed angioplasty received percutaneous CPB support while triple-vessel angioplasty was performed. Percutaneous CPB appears to be beneficial in resuscitating patients with refractory cardiac arrest or other forms of circulatory collapse except trauma. Limited use for brief periods in high-risk patients having elective angioplasty might be applicable.\r"

In addition a percutaneous left heart assist device (transseptal insertion of left atrial cannula via a femoral vein) was employed in 5 patients with profound cardiogenic shock after acute myocardial infarction. Thirty patients (41.7%) were weaned from the left heart assist device and 21 (29.2%) were discharged from the hospital. Two patients (40.0%) were weaned from the right heart assist device, but both later died during the postoperative period. Of the 5 patients in whom a percutaneous left heart assist device was inserted, 4 underwent successful emergency percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, but all 5 patients died. Causes of death included severe coagulopathy, irreversible extensive myocardial infarction and cardiac failure, refractory arrhythmias, severe \"shock\" lung, and multisystem failure. In summary, satisfactory results can be achieved with a roller pump-driven left and right heart assist device for severe postoperative heart failure. Further experience should be obtained with the percutaneous technique to assess its efficacy in treating patients with acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock.\r"

In our experience, the Pierce-Donachy external pneumatic ventricular assist device has proved to be one of the most effective devices for these patients. Since 1981, 30 patients aged 15 to 71 years (mean age, 52 years) with profound cardiogenic shock refractory to conventional therapy after cardiotomy were supported with the Pierce-Donachy ventricular assist device. Fourteen required left ventricular support, 7 needed right ventricular support with an intraaortic balloon, and 9 had biventricular assistance. Duration of support ranged from three hours to 22 days (mean length, 3.6 days). Seven of the first 11 patients seen died in the operating room of bleeding, biventricular failure, or both. However, 16 patients (53%) had improved cardiac function, 15 (50%) were weaned, and 11 (37%) were discharged. Of the last 19 patients in the series, 47% survived. Factors affecting survival were myocardial infarction (75%) and renal failure (90%). Common complications were bleeding (73%) and biventricular failure (83%).\r"

The increasing number of patients who would be candidates for total heart replacement suggests a large role for a permanent implantable total artificial heart. To that end, the Pennsylvania State University is developing an electric motor-driven total artificial heart; the results with implants in calves are encouraging. In this device, a roller-screw mechanism is used to translate the rotation of a brushless direct-current motor into rectilinear motion of a pusher-plate assembly, which in turn empties the blood sacs. The total artificial heart of the future will function under automatic control without percutaneous leads, and this should provide the patient with a nearly normal life-style. Although further experimental efforts are necessary to prepare the device for clinical trials, the technology to provide a safe and reliable electric blood-pump system is at hand.\r"

  ".W": "We studied 36 asymptomatic children 7.7 +/- 2.5 years after a Mustard operation. Fifteen children had sinus rhythm on all electrocardiograms made during follow-up. Only 2 had normal 24-hour Holter recordings throughout follow-up, 6 had periods of supraventricular tachycardia, and 3 had periods of atrial flutter. The electrophysiological evaluation of sinus node function was normal in 5 of the 31 children who were studied. The behavior of the atrial myocardium was electrophysiologically abnormal in most of the children. Atrioventricular node function, on the contrary, was normal in nearly all of the children. Eleven children had normal hemodynamics. Four had severe or complete obstruction of the superior vena cava, 1 had a severe pulmonary venous obstruction, 3 had a severe left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, and 2 had a large left-to-right shunt. Only 3 children had normal hemodynamic and electrophysiological studies. We conclude that the absence of symptoms and a normal routine examination of children a long time after a Mustard operation does not exclude hemodynamic and electrophysiological abnormalities, which can sometimes be severe. In view of these disappointing results, we decided to replace the Mustard operation with the arterial switch operation in children with transposition of the great arteries.\r"

Fifty-eight persons had large-bowel carcinomas diagnosed, 80% of which were localized. One hundred sixty persons had adenomatous polyps removed. Forty percent of cancers and 58% of polyps were detected in persons with only one or two positive test slides out of a total of six. In 33% of persons with a positive screen, the diagnostic workup consisted of a repeated stool guaiac test and/or sigmoidoscopy only. A major drawback to improving the results of mass screening programs for colorectal cancer is the limited gastrointestinal workup conducted by physicians in many persons with a positive fecal occult blood test.\r"

Antimalarial compliance was assessed and found to be age-related, with noncompliance reported in 41% of patients younger than 40 years and in only 19% of patients older than 40 years. Eight of 35 women who were receiving chloroquine phosphate reported menstrual irregularities. Further investigation of this possible association is underway. We continue to stress compliance with antimalarial medication.\r"

After evaluating such a case, we retrospectively analyzed all cases of established constrictive pericarditis seen in this institution in the last six years. The clinical and laboratory features of this cohort of 30 patients are similar to those of other reported series. Pleural effusion was present in 18 (60%) of 30 cases. In six (12%) of the 18 cases, pleural effusion was a major component of the clinical presentation, and in three (10%) of these six cases, the persistence of pleural effusion of unknown origin was the indication for referral to this institution. Analysis of pleural fluid in four cases revealed three exudates and one transudate. We believe this is the first report of unexplained pleural effusion as the presenting manifestation of constrictive pericarditis, and this diagnosis should be added to the list of causes of unexplained pleural effusion.\r"

We describe the first patient in whom a pheochromocytoma was diagnosed by a glucagon test, after which the blood pressure (but not the plasma catecholamine) response to a second injection of glucagon was blocked by pretreatment with phenoxybenzamine. After the tumor (which contained both pheochromocytoma and ganglioneuroma tissue) was removed, a third glucagon test result was negative. This experience suggests that patients with normal plasma catecholamine levels who are suspected of harboring a pheochromocytoma may be accurately diagnosed, but potentially dangerous increases in blood pressure may be minimized, by performing the glucagon test after alpha-adrenergic blockade.\r"

We retrospectively applied the criteria to 471 patients with acute low-back pain in three teaching hospital walk-in clinics. Roentgenograms were obtained at the initial visit in 99 patients (21.1%); the number would have increased to 217 (46.1%) if the criteria had been used. The following four patient characteristics were associated with actual roentgenogram use: older age, longer duration of symptoms, reflex asymmetry, and point vertebral tenderness. Adoption of the 11 criteria studied herein may inadvertently increase roentgenogram use, thereby raising health care costs and exposing more patients to gonadal irradiation. The standard of practice in these three clinics seemed to entail use of less broad roentgenogram selection criteria. Other published guidelines for roentgenograms emphasize clinical follow-up, reserving further evaluation for patients who fail to improve after a trial of bed rest and analgesics.\r"

Recently, anabolic steroid therapy has been shown to increase total body calcium and forearm density in osteoporotic patients, perhaps by causing an increase in bone formation. It is not known if these agents affect vertebral density. We have measured vertebral mineral density in 71 postmenopausal osteoporotic women before and after treatment with either the anabolic steroid nandrolone decanoate or antiresorptive therapy. After a mean treatment period of 14 months, there was a mean increase of 20% in vertebral mineral density in the former group, and no significant change in the latter group. The difference in the time-weighted mean rates of change between the two groups was significant. The results suggest that nandrolone decanoate therapy increases bone formation.\r"

  ".U": "89104587\r", 
  ".W": "The immediate delivery of bystander-administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), coupled with the rapid delivery of advanced cardiac life support, can significantly reduce mortality from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Because the majority of sudden cardiac deaths occur in the victim's home with family members present, family members of cardiac patients at high risk for sudden death are the logical focus of CPR training. However, previous research has shown that only a small minority of family members of cardiac patients actually learn CPR and that health care professionals have failed to recommend CPR training in this population, in part due to concerns about their ability to learn CPR. The purpose of this study was to describe learning capabilities in this population and to identify characteristics of unsuccessful learners. To this end, we taught CPR to 83 family members of cardiac patients who were at risk for sudden cardiac death. Subjects had no CPR training within the past two years. Eighty-one percent of the subjects successfully learned CPR. Of the demographic and psychological characteristics examined, only gender, age, and depression were significant in explaining differences in CPR skills attainment ability. The elderly, the depressed, and males were more likely to be unsuccessful in demonstrating adequate CPR skills. Our results suggest that the majority of family members of cardiac patients can learn CPR successfully. Specific training strategies may need to be developed and tested to enhance CPR training in those family members of cardiac patients predicted to have difficulty learning CPR.\r"

A fiberoptic flow-directed thermal dilution pulmonary artery catheter capable of continuously monitoring the mixed venous saturation, while more expensive than a conventional pulmonary artery catheter, theoretically could result in better patient care, and might be cost-effective if it resulted either in fewer blood tests being ordered or in less time in the intensive care unit. To test this hypothesis, we designed a randomized trial in our Medical Intensive Care Unit to compare a standard pulmonary artery catheter with a fiberoptic catheter. Twenty-six patients received a standard catheter and 25 patients received the fiberoptic catheter. There were no statistical differences between the groups in age, time in the intensive care unit, number of tests ordered, hours of mechanical ventilator therapy, hours of vasoactive drug therapy, or mortality rate. The only statistically significant differences between the groups were that (1) the fiberoptic catheter required a longer insertion time and (2) there were more technical problems in consistently obtaining the wedge pressure in the patients with the fiberoptic catheters. We conclude that routine substitution of a fiberoptic catheter for the standard pulmonary artery catheter is not indicated.\r"

  ".W": "Although satisfactory results have been obtained with conventional synovectomy of the knee, there are frequent complications, and a long period of rehabilitation is necessary after this surgery. We performed arthroscopic synovectomy of the knees of 30 patients (33 knees), 22 of whom had rheumatoid arthritis. These patients underwent the procedure after failure to respond to an intraarticular injection of either osmic acid or yttrium 90. The operated knee was moved 3-5 hours after the arthroscopy, and the patients walked the next day. No rehabilitation was needed. The followup period ranged from 6 months to 36 months, with an average of 17.7 months. Except for 1 patient with severe arthritis, all patients experienced improvement. Results were rated as \"good\" or \"very good\" in 27 knees. Six months after synovectomy, the patients were asked to rate their improvement; the mean +/- SEM degree of improvement was 79.1 +/- 22.9%. All patients had significant improvement in the range of motion of the knee. One patient required manipulation of the knee (while under anesthesia) soon after the arthroscopy. There were no other complications. There was no detectable radiographic evidence of disease progression in 24 patients who were seen 1 year after the procedure or in 9 patients who were seen 2 years after the arthroscopy. Thus, arthroscopic synovectomy appears to be an effective and simple treatment for chronic knee synovitis, and has a low morbidity rate.\r"

Notably, neither the incidence of leukopenia nor the dosage or duration of cyclophosphamide or corticosteroid therapy correlated well with infection, which occurred most frequently in men over 60 years of age. Patients with Wegener's granulomatosis appeared to be at greater risk of infection than those with the other forms of vasculitis. These results suggest that this treatment regimen may not be as safe as was previously thought.\r"

SF from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and from control patients was found to stimulate chondrocyte proteoglycan synthesis in bovine articular cartilage. A monoclonal antibody directed primarily against IGF-1 (and to some extent, IGF-2) partially blocked the stimulatory action of serum and totally blocked the stimulation by SF. These findings indicate that IGFs are major regulating factors of cartilage proteoglycan synthesis in human SF. In addition, we measured serum and SF levels of IGF-1 in RA patients and control patients, using a radioimmunoassay. No difference in immunoreactive serum IGF-1 was detected between patients and controls. The IGF-1 levels in SF were consistently lower than in serum, for both patient groups. No differences in IGF-1 concentration were found between RA and non-RA SF. The relevance of these data with respect to joint inflammation is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Forty-two sib pairs concordant for ankylosing spondylitis (mean disease duration 20.1 years) were assessed to define the relative role of genetic and environmental factors in determining age and calendar year of disease onset, systemic features, functional outcome and prognosis, and radiologic progression. Twenty-seven pairs were of the same sex (male/male n = 21, female/female n = 6). The correlation coefficient was not significant for age at onset (rs = 0.235), but was much higher for calendar year of onset (rs = 0.702, P less than 0.01). These data were confirmed by two-way analysis of variance: between sibs, the F probability was 0.07 for age at onset (41 degrees of freedom, F ratio 1.6) and was less than 0.001 for calendar year of onset (41 degrees of freedom, F ratio 5.45). Thus, it is suggested that environmental factors play the greater role in the timing of onset. Concordance for the presence or absence of uveitis was only 43%, again suggesting that genetic factors are less significant than the environment. Conversely, genetic factors are more important in influencing prognosis. A disability and pain index revealed that sibs had a closer score than expected by chance alone (P = 0.035); also, the correlation coefficient for blinded radiologic analysis (pelvic and lumbar views) was significant for pairs of sibs (rs = 0.859, P less than 0.01), but was not significant for random pairs of subjects (rs = -0.144). In contrast, within-sib pair and random subject-pair analyses of hip radiographs revealed rs = -0.111 and -0.033, respectively, neither of which was significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thrombocytopenia (20 X 10(3)/microliters) was pronounced in the third week of treatment and six patients (33.3%) needed platelet support. Contrary to earlier claims, our experience suggests that treatment with low-dose Ara-C is associated with significant cytopenias. Ara-C does not obviate the need for intensive supportive care and CR rates are no longer better. Low-dose Ara-C does not seem to be a choice in previously untreated ANLL patients who otherwise have a high probability of achieving a CR with standard multidrug chemotherapy protocols.\r"

Complete responses were observed in two patients with soft tissue metastases. Thirteen patients experienced partial responses with a median duration of response of 4+ months. Partial responses were predominantly observed in soft tissue disease; however, five patients with visceral metastases experienced partial tumor regression. Median survival for the study group was 4+ months. Hormonal receptor status did not predict response to LDCI-FU.

All 14 patients were evaluable for toxicity; one patient was inevaluable for response due to early death. A total of 24 courses of therapy were administered. The dose-limiting toxicity was myelosuppression with 73% of patients experiencing Grade III or IV neutropenia. Grade II or above thrombocytopenia occurred in 30% of the patients. Renal and neurologic toxicity was minimal. Two patients experienced laryngeal edema from vigorous hydration with one of them requiring a tracheostomy for respiratory compromise. Partial responses were seen in six patients (46%). Two of the six patients had received previous treatment with standard dose cisplatin. Two patients achieved long-term responses (54+, 44+ months, respectively). Both of these patients were previously untreated, inoperable (T4N3M0, T3N1M0), and subsequently received radiation therapy after two cycles of chemotherapy. Median duration of response in the remaining responders was 3 months (range, 3-10 months). High-dose cisplatin may benefit selected patients with inoperable, advanced head and neck tumors. However, further randomized trials need to be conducted before firm conclusions can be established.\r"

After two or three cycles of therapy, 74 patients were judged to have stable disease and assigned at random either to chemotherapy maintenance with the same regimen (38 subjects) or to chemotherapy discontinuation (36 subjects). The two study groups were comparable for all the major prognostic factors. Median time to progression was 26 weeks for the chemotherapy group compared to 24 weeks for the nonchemotherapy group (P = NS). Median survival was prolonged in the treatment arm (47 weeks) compared to nontreatment arm (30 weeks), which was statistically nonsignificant. A patient self-assessment of the quality of life revealed a significantly worse tolerance to therapy and a better physical condition in the chemotherapy group. Objective MACC toxicity was significant with two treatment-related deaths. This study failed to demonstrate sufficient therapeutic benefits to justify the increased cost and toxicity of continuing treatment in nonresponding NSCLC patients.\r"

Therapeutic irradiation may induce prostatic glandular atypia, which in its severe form can be confused with persistent adenocarcinoma on prostatic biopsies. In the current study, 37 postirradiation prostate biopsy specimens were evaluated by immunohistochemistry using a specific monoclonal anticytokeratin antibody (KA1) that reacts with the basal cells of normal or hyperplastic glands, but is nonreactive with the lumenal cells or with prostatic carcinoma cells. Persistent carcinoma was observed in 19 cases in which antibody staining was absent. The noncarcinomatous glands retained reactivity, but this reactivity appeared in a new and previously undescribed pattern. The irradiated lesion was characterized by cellular pleomorphisism, with enlargement of nuclei and loss of polarity. The immunoreactivity was seen in the enlarged basal cells and was seen to focally extend to involve the lumenal cell layer. In five of 37 cases, glands were seen that were so atypical on the routinely stained sections that a distinction from cancer could not be made. These same glands in the adjacent section reacted with KA1 in each case allowing us to conclude that the changes were benign. We conclude that the interpretation of postirradiation prostatic biopsy specimens may be aided by immunohistochemistry with this anticytokeratin antibody.\r"

  ".W": "We have compared the pyruvate kinase (PK) isoenzyme pattern of three rhabdomyosarcomas with foetal skeletal muscle tissue of 19 and 23 weeks of gestation, together with adult muscle in relation to immunohistochemical and morphological criteria. In foetal tissue of 19 weeks of gestation a focal immunopositivity for desmin and myoglobin was observed, whereas in tissue of 23 weeks an overall positivity for these proteins was present. Two of the three neoplasms were poorly differentiated and of the alveolar subtype. They were desmin immunoreactive. Some large spindle-shaped cells expressed myoglobin. The third one was more differentiated in microscopic characteristics and all cells showed immunoreactivity for desmin and myoglobin. In the foetal tissues five forms of pyruvate kinase isoenzymes were present with K2M2 as the predominant form. In adult muscle tissue only M4 was present. The tumors were characterized by a profound shift to the K-type, whereas the M4-type was not expressed at all. A difference in isoenzyme composition of pyruvate kinase was found between the morphologically less differentiated tumors and the more differentiated tumor; in the latter more M-subunits were expressed.\r"

  ".W": "Neopterin excretion levels were assessed in 66 consecutive patients affected by non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). The logarithm of the mean value of the whole series was 2.71 (log [mumol neopterin/mol creatinine]), significantly higher (P less than 0.001) than the control value (2.12). Fifty-six of 66 patients had a raised excretion of neopterin in amounts statistically related to the stage of disease. The mean value (2.51) of patients in Stages I-II was lower than the mean value (2.86) of patients in Stage III-IV (P less than 0.001). The 2-year probability of survival was 64% for patients in Stages I-II and 34% for patients in Stages III-IV. However, patients with lower neopterin excretion (less than 2.65) fared better than patients with higher neopterin excretion, regardless of the stage. Longitudinal analysis showed a trend toward a correlation between response to therapy and neopterin excretion. In NHL, the raised neopterin excretion appears to be a consequence of activation of the host immune system rather than a product of the malignant cells. But this excessive activation of the monocytes-macrophages, as reflected by urinary neopterin levels, is not accompanied by a better outcome. In conclusion, although neopterin cannot be considered a typical tumor marker, nevertheless it is an useful prognostic marker in NHL.\r"
