The study consisted of 79 patients with MS diagnosed in the two most northern counties of Norway between 1974-82. Diagnostic category, age at onset, sex, county, symptom groups, course of disease and occupation groups were identified as possible prognostic variables. Forty one patients (51%) were unemployed at last follow up. None of the 15 patients with probable or possible MS were unemployed due to MS. The multivariate analyses selected the nonremittent course or heavy physical work and age over 30 at onset as high risk factors associated with early unemployment.\r"

In addition, pattern reversal visual evoked responses (VER), brainstem auditory evoked responses (BAER) as well as spinal and scalp recorded somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) were investigated by stimulating both the index finger and the posterior tibial nerve. The reflex response was altered uni- or bilaterally in 56 per cent of the patients and the abnormalities of the ECR were related to the categories of diagnostic probability. Pathological results were found in 28 per cent of the hands without clinical evidence of sensorimotor deficit. Although ECR abnormalities were often associated with clinical signs, significant correlation was found only with hyperreflexia and/or increased muscle tone in the corresponding upper limb. Pathological ECR were more common than pathological SSEPs with finger stimulation recorded under identical stimulus conditions. Fewer abnormalities were found by ECR testing than with VER, but the proportion of abnormal ECR was higher than that of BAER. ECR provides a valuable supplement to existing electrophysiological procedures for detecting lesions in the central nervous system.\r"

The interrelationships of these measures were then examined using factor analytic procedures. Three ventricular dimensions were found. To validate these three dimensions, the relationship of each with age was examined and then the age-corrected scores of seven clinical groups were compared on each of these dimensions. The magnitude of the relationship between these dimensions and age was impressive and each dimension contributed unique information regarding these age-related changes. Moreover, the analysis of the clinical groups suggested that differential patterns of ventricular change were present dependent upon the disease. These results are discussed with a view to integrating the findings of previous studies and planning future studies.\r"

In an attempt to improve the reliability of morphometric measurements of the corpus callosum, a computerised image analysis system was used to measure the shape, area, thickness and length of the CC on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 12 pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for schizophrenia (SC). No differences in CC area (anterior, middle, posterior thirds and total), length or vertical thickness of the CC body (at three levels) were demonstrated by t test comparisons of the affected SC and unaffected twins. Statistical analysis of a Fourier expansion series suggested differences in shape between normal and SC cotwins in the second harmonic of the anterior and middle segments and effects of gender on posterior CC shape. These results fail to replicate previous findings of altered length, thickness and area in the schizophrenic CC, but implicate disease-related shape differences in the anterior and middle segment of the corpus callosum and gender-related differences in splenium shape. The disease-related shape distortion suggest ventriculomegaly rather than an intrinsic abnormality of the corpus callosum.\r"

  ".W": "To explain the prevalence of unilateral spatial neglect in patients with right brain damage, Heilman et al have suggested that the attentional neurons of the right parietal lobe might have bilateral receptive fields, whereas the homologous cells of the left hemisphere would have strictly contralateral receptive fields. One implication of this theory is that patients with right brain damage should show a prevalence of disorders of visual attention not only in the half space contralateral to the damaged hemisphere, but also in the ipsilateral one. To check this theory, 50 control subjects, 102 right and 125 left brain-damaged patients were given a drawing completion task in which patients were requested to complete the missing parts of a star, a cube and a house. Omissions of lines lying on the sides of the models contralateral and ipsilateral to the damaged hemisphere were taken separately into account. Results did not confirm the hypothesis, since right brain-damaged patients failed to complete the contralateral sides of the models much more frequently than patients with left brain injury, but no difference was found between the two hemispheric groups when ipsilateral disorders of visual attention were taken into account. Furthermore, no correlation was found between omissions of lines lying on the sides of the models contralateral and ipsilateral to the damaged hemisphere. This finding suggests that contralateral and ipsilateral disorders of visual attention are not due to the same mechanism in right brain-damaged patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The variables of the oxygen-consumption Fick equation were measured using the following system: oxygen uptake by an originally developed respiratory gas monitoring system, arteriovenous oxygen saturation difference by pulse and fiberoptic oximetry, and hemoglobin concentration by an in vitro oximeter. Fick cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance were calculated every 30 seconds. Fick cardiac output was compared with thermodilution cardiac output in 11 anesthetized patients. A total of 208 corresponding cardiac output measurements showed a range of 2 to 9 L.min-1. The correlation coefficient between the thermodilution and Fick cardiac outputs was 0.961, with a regression equation of Fick cardiac output = 1.058 thermodilution cardiac output - 0.359. The difference between the thermodilution and Fick cardiac outputs was 0.103 +/- 0.395. The Fick cardiac output was significantly lower than the thermodilution cardiac output, especially in the low flow range. We demonstrated that this new monitoring system was clinically feasible and sufficiently accurate, under the limited circumstances of our study. The integration of routinely used equipment has made possible a frequently repeatable method for estimating cardiac output in patients.\r"

The flow parameters RL and RT may represent the resistance of laminar and turbulent flow, respectively. In this study pressure and flow were measured, and RL and RT were calculated for several infusion tubings, catheter, and system components. We then developed a technique to identify the relative effect of various devices on achieving the higher flows needed for fluid resuscitation. A typical infusion system was chosen, and the experimentally determined flow parameters RL and RT of its components were used in the quadratic P-F relationship at P = 300 mm Hg. Devices in the infusion system were ranked, using a subtractive algorithm, according to their relative impediment to flow as measured by contribution to the pressure drop. The order of devices removed or replaced, from largest to least pressure drop, was as follows: fluid warmer, 16-gauge catheter, check valve, 14-gauge catheter, standard-bore Y tubing, 12-gauge catheter, and standard-bore stopcock, leaving 10-gauge catheter + wide tubing. Devices with large RT, such as fluid warmers and check valves that produce large pressure drops, should generally be avoided during fluid resuscitation when high flows are needed. A similar ordering of device removal or substitution (largest to least pressure drop) was determined using the traditional but incorrect linear P-F model, P = RF, and the order of devices chosen for elimination was different.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90278490\r", 
  ".W": "The presence of critical pressures in the pulmonary circulation complicates the traditional use of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). The recruitable nature of the pulmonary circulation violates a basic assumption of the PVR formula, that is, that the involved vessels are rigid-walled. Flow through collapsible blood vessels is subject to the influence of critical opening pressures in addition to inflow and outflow pressures. As a result, PVR has a variable relationship to the Poiseuille resistance, approximating it better when zone 3 conditions predominate. In addition to being flow-dependent, PVR cannot easily distinguish among vasodilation, recruitment, and rheologic changes. PVR may be viewed as an index of steady-state power dissipation by the circulation, describing the relationship between power dissipation and flow, but it will still underestimate power dissipation by as much as 50%, since it cannot express oscillatory and kinetic power components. Laboratory data regarding the pulmonary circulation are predicted and explained by positing the existence of critical pressures in the pulmonary circulation and allow estimation of Poiseuille resistance. Unfortunately, clinical application of this approach is difficult owing to the necessity of generating pressure-flow plots under very stringent conditions. The clinical use of both pressure-flow and PVR-flow plots is impaired by shifting to different curves during hemodynamic manipulation. PVR must be interpreted in light of its considerable limitations.\r"

Initial human clinical studies showed unexplained intermittent large drops in sensor oxygen tension (PiO2). Normal volunteers were studied to elucidate this problem. In the first part of this study, the probe and cannula were manipulated and the probe configuration and its position within the cannula were varied. The decreases in PiO2 were judged to be primarily due to the sensor touching the arterial wall. Retraction of the sensor tip within the cannula eliminated the problem. In the second part of this study, the accuracy of the retracted probe was evaluated in 4 subjects who breathed varying fractions of inspired oxygen and carbon dioxide. The arterial ranges achieved were 7.20 to 7.59 for pH, 22 to 70 mm Hg for PaCO2, and 46 to 633 mm Hg for PaO2. Linear regression of 48 paired sensor (i) versus arterial values showed pHi = 0.896 pHa + 0.773 (r = 0.98, SEE = 0.017); PiCO2 = 1.05 PaCO2 - 1.33 (r = 0.98, SEE = 2.4 mm Hg); and PiO2 = 1.09 PaO2 - 20.6 (r = 0.99, SEE = 21.2 mm Hg). Bias (defined as the mean differences between sensor and arterial values) and precision (SD of differences) were, respectively, -0.003 and 0.02 for pHi, 0.77 and 2.44 mm Hg for PiCO2, and -2.9 and 25.4 mm Hg for PiO2. The mean in vivo 90% response times for step changes in inspired gas were 2.64, 3.88, and 2.60 minutes, respectively, for pHi, PiCO2, and PiO2.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to find appropriate somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) and tumor data that would predict immediate postoperative outcome. Seventeen patients were evaluated, all with supratentorial mass lesions. Intraoperative SSEP monitoring was carried out, and central conduction time, N20 amplitude, and N20 to N13 amplitude ratio were recorded throughout the operation. The differences between the end and the start of the procedure and between the end of the operation and the most substantial changes during tumor removal were calculated for statistical evaluation. Tumor location and extent were carefully determined and calculated by computed tomographic reconstructions in the axial and sagittal planes. Several tumor parameters were measured: the distances from the midpoint of the tumor to the central sulcus, midline, and base of the skull and the longitudinal and cross-sectional diameters. The electrophysiologic and tumor data sets were correlated with the immediate postoperative neurologic deterioration. For this purpose, patients were divided into two groups: group 1 = no neurologic deterioration after operation (13 patients); group 2 = neurologic deterioration after operation (4 patients). The difference in central conduction times between the end and the start of the procedure was the only variable that exhibited a significant influence on the immediate postoperative condition (P = 0.007), as determined by analysis of variance. The other electrophysiologic data as well as the tumor data failed the significance threshold of P = 0.05. Discriminant analysis was applied to test the classification capacity of the measured variables. Involving all measured variables (electrophysiologic and tumor data), discriminant analysis allowed a correct classification of all 17 patients to their proper neurologic deterioration group. Discriminant analysis for SSEP data alone led to 15 correct classifications. Tumor data, used alone for discriminating procedures, revealed 14 correct classifications. When each variable was analyzed separately, only the difference in central conduction times between the end and the start of the procedure gave significant predictions, namely, 15 correct classifications. This was the same number as achieved by all electrophysiologic variables together. No other variable could on its own yield any valid prognosis for assessment of immediate postoperative neurologic deterioration. The data confirm the importance of central conduction time recovery before the end of the operation on the patient's immediate postoperative neurologic condition.\r"

Forty-three pulse oximeters of 12 manufacturers studied over a period of 10 months showed that, at a mean arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) level of 54.5%, as Hb concentration fell, average pulse oximeter (SpO2) bias increased approximately linearly from 0 at Hb greater than 14 g/dl to about -14% at 8 less than Hb less than 9 g/dl. At SaO2 = 53.6%, the mean bias (SaO2--SpO2) of 13 oximeters of 5 manufacturers averaged -15.0% (n = 43) in a subject with Hb = 8 g/dl, but -6.4% (n = 390) in nonanemic subjects. The additional bias in the anemic subject increased with desaturation. It was 0.13% at SaO2 = 98.5% (n = 13), -1.31% at 87.5% (n = 38), -2.71% at 75.1% (n = 38), -5.18% at 61.3% (n = 26), and -9.95% at 53.6% (n = 41); n is the product of the number of oximeters and number of tests in each saturation range. The instruments that showed the greatest errors at low saturations in nonanemic subjects also showed the greatest additional errors associated with anemia (the range between manufacturers of anemic incremental error at about 53% being from -3.2 to -14.5%) and conformed well to the relationship bias (anemic) = 1.35 x bias (normal) -8.18% (r = 0.94; Sy.x = 3.3%). The error due to anemia was zero at 97% SaO2 and became evident when SaO2 fell below 75%.\r"

This study investigated the ability of passive warming of airway gases to increase the accuracy of temperatures measured at this site (i.e., to decrease their difference from core temperature). In 15 adult patients undergoing general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation, esophageal temperatures were measured before and after use of a heat and moisture exchanger (an artificial nose) that passively warmed inspired gases. The resulting values were compared with nasopharyngeal temperatures, which represented core temperature. Before use of the heat and moisture exchanger, esophageal and nasopharyngeal temperatures differed significantly (mean difference +/- SD, 0.9 +/- 0.4 degrees C; P less than or equal to 0.001). After passive warming of inspired gases, esophageal temperatures increased significantly (mean increase +/- SD, 0.5 +/- 0.2 degrees C; P less than or equal to 0.001) but inconsistently (range, 0.1 to 1.2 degrees C). However, the mean difference between esophageal and nasopharyngeal temperatures was still significant (0.5 +/- 0.3 degrees C; P less than 0.001). Discrepancies between esophageal and core temperatures persist when a currently available esophageal stethoscope with adjacent auscultation chamber and temperature probe is used, despite passive warming of airway gases.\r"

The mitogenic properties of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) were examined in three human malignant glioma cell lines (T98G, U87, and U138). Each of the three had high-affinity EGF receptors and all responded in a dose-dependent fashion to physiological concentrations of EGF. These cell lines also showed a pronounced mitogenic response to PDGF which equaled or exceeded that achieved with EGF. Simultaneous stimulation with both factors produced an additive response, which approximated that obtained in medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The authors conclude that functional EGF and PDGF receptors were present in the human malignant glial tumors studied. The response of the human glioma lines to these growth factors in many respects parallels the response seen in fetal astrocytes tested under similar conditions. In contrast, the behavior of two chemically induced rat gliomas (9L and C6) differed significantly from that seen in the human lines, suggesting that the rat lines may not be entirely acceptable as models for studying the growth characteristics of human malignant glial tumors.\r"

These comprised 20 glioblastomas multiforme, 15 anaplastic astrocytomas, and 16 astrocytomas, in which the mean numbers of Ag-NOR's per cell (+/- standard error of the mean) were 2.51 +/- 0.12, 2.01 +/- 0.10, and 1.76 +/- 0.06, respectively. Significant differences among these were recognized, and the mean number of Ag-NOR's paralleled the degree of histopathological malignancy. In 16 cases, studies were performed of the number of Ag-NOR's and the S-phase fraction by in vitro labeling using antibromodeoxyuridine monoclonal antibody. A linear relationship was demonstrated between these two factors (r = 0.857, p less than 0.001), although some scatter was seen. In 32 adult patients, the correlation between the number of Ag-NOR's and the prognosis was estimated. The results demonstrated that the group containing patients with less than 1.80 Ag-NOR's per cell had a better prognosis than the group with 1.80 Ag-NOR's or more. Thus, the number of Ag-NOR's reflected the degree of histopathological malignancy, S-phase fraction, and prognosis. Silver colloid staining for Ag-NOR's is a simple, rapid, and reproducible method for estimating the proliferative potential of human gliomas without requiring a complicated technique.\r"

Iodoacetate or dichloroacetate was administered intraperitoneally to rats in a study to examine the role of glycolysis in hyperglycemic exacerbation of neurological deficit. Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with saline, iodoacetate, or dichloroacetate and then made paraplegic by temporary occlusion for 10, 12, 13, or 15 minutes of the right and left subclavian arteries and the aorta distal to the left subclavian artery. Glycolytic blockage by iodoacetate was lethal in doses of 15 mg/kg or more, whereas rats receiving 10 mg/kg survived but showed no significant neurological improvement compared to the saline-treated control group. Dichloroacetate, 500 mg/kg, protected neurological function, which suggests a possible detrimental role for lactate accumulation and the benefit of maintaining tricarboxylic acid cycle activity by stimulating pyruvate dehydrogenase. The protection seen with dichloroacetate depended on the severity of ischemic injury. Dichloroacetate administration had a minimal effect on neurological outcome with occlusion periods of 13 and 15 minutes, mild improvement with 12 minutes of occlusion, and a significant protective effect with a 10-minute occlusion period. The dose-response nature of ischemic injury and neurological outcome in this rat model of paraplegia therefore appears to play an important role in determining the effect observed with a specific intervention.\r"

It was associated with a good functional postoperative outcome (84.6%). There have been no cases of tumor recurrence in the squamous papillary group. However, in the group with the adamantinous type of craniopharyngioma, the recurrence rate was 13% in adult patients and 9% in children. When compared to the adult adamantinous cases, the incidence of visual deficits was lower in the squamous papillary group (75% vs. 84%) but the incidence of endocrine abnormalities was higher (75% vs. 52%). Thus, the preoperative, operative, and postoperative features of the two types of craniopharyngioma were found to be distinctly different in adults and children.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical features, perioperative course, and postoperative outcomes of 144 patients who underwent microsurgical resection of craniopharyngioma were reviewed. Overall, 90% of the tumors were completely resected and 7% recurred. Evaluation of those patients who underwent primary resection revealed much better results. The operative techniques and approaches are reviewed in detail. The results of this series suggest that primary total removal of craniopharyngiomas yields the best long-term outcome for the patient. Experience has shown that the larger the tumor the greater will be the damage, both preoperatively and intraoperatively, to vital intracranial structures. Consequently, early diagnosis, at a stage when the tumor is still small, improves the chances of accomplishing complete removal and of achieving good operative results. The early diagnosis of craniopharyngioma, before it can produce devastating neurological defects, continues to be the principal goal of our medical and pediatric colleagues.\r"

Cutaneous manifestations and associated malformations were common. Surgical repair was performed at ages 1 week to 17 years; there was no operative mortality. Thirty-five of 38 children with normal preoperative examination were without deficits on long-term follow-up review. Bowel and bladder paralysis was present in 42 children and did not recover after release of cord tethering. Eleven children had return of symptoms and were reexplored 3 to 8 years after initial surgery. Surgical repair with release of cord tethering at the time of diagnosis is advocated, regardless of patient age.\r"

The procedures were performed under one anesthetic. In all cases the collateral circulation had been judged insufficient on the basis of a strict preoperative testing protocol including: cerebral panangiography, electroencephalography, somatosensory potential recording, and cerebral blood flow monitoring during manual compression of the ICA in the neck. There were four intracavernous ICA aneurysms, four carotid-ophthalmic artery aneurysms, and one supraclinoid ICA aneurysm. All patients showed symptoms and signs of compression of the surrounding nervous structures. In the five cases of intradural lesions, the artery was occluded at the level of the aneurysm neck, so the ophthalmic artery had to be occluded. There was, nevertheless, no case of worsening of vision following surgery, and all nine patients showed significant improvement following the combined procedure. A combined EC-IC bypass procedure and endovascular ICA occlusion allows for immediate verification of the surgical results and appears to be a worthwhile method for treating giant intracranial aneurysms.\r"

When symptoms of posterior fossa compression were present, posterior fossa decompression was performed; however, when symptoms of posterior fossa compression were absent, the choice of posterior fossa decompression or syringosubarachnoid shunting depended, respectively, on whether the syrinx was narrow or wide on MR imaging. At least 1 year after surgery, subjective improvement or arrest of disease was recorded in 73% of the patients. The present study suggests that: 1) the symptoms attributed to spinal cord damage have no significant relationship to the size of the syrinx on MR images; 2) the surgical techniques employed in this series (posterior fossa decompression or syringosubarachnoid shunt) were equally useful in inducing syrinx collapse; and 3) when posterior fossa decompression is performed, plugging of the obex is not necessary for syrinx collapse.\r"

In the CHI patients, measurements were significantly reduced for the areas of the anterior four-fifths, the posterior one-fifth, and the total corpus callosum. Moreover, the minimum width of the callosal body was reduced in the CHI patients as compared to that of control individuals. Indices of corpus callosal atrophy were significantly correlated with the chronicity of injury and the degree of lateral ventricular enlargement. There was no difference in callosal measurements between men and women. Magnetic resonance imaging provides an in vivo determination of corpus callosal atrophy which may reflect the severity of diffuse axonal injury and predict the type and severity of hemispheric disconnection effects.\r"

This study demonstrates that phorbol ester pretreatment of a LAK cell-sensitive glioma cell line (SNB-19) induced a significant decrease in the susceptibility of cells to LAK cell-mediated lysis. This effect was produced by low concentrations of the tumor-promoting phorbol ester, phorbol-12,13-myristate acetate (PMA), and was reversible. Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors failed to block this phenomenon. No apparent alteration in the ability of LAK cells to bind to their targets was observed. Thus, PMA may have exerted its effects by a mechanism that does not require PKC, or these glioma cells may possess an isozyme of PKC which is insensitive to the inhibitors used in these studies.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the role of protein kinase C-mediated pathways in the proliferation of malignant gliomas, this study examined the effect of a protein kinase C (PKC)-activating phorbol ester (12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-phorbol acetate or TPA) and a protein kinase C inhibitor (polymyxin B) on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis of malignant glioma cells in vitro. A serum-free chemically defined medium, MCDB 105, was employed for all studies. Two established human malignant glioma cell lines (T98G and U138), two rat glioma lines (9L and C6), and two low-passage human glioma lines (obtained from surgical specimens) were studied. With the exception of the C6 line, all tumors responded in a dose-dependent fashion to nanomolar concentrations of TPA with a median effective dose that varied from 0.5 ng/ml for the U138 glioma to 1 ng/ml for the T98G glioma. At optimal concentrations (5 to 10 ng/ml), TPA produced a two- to five-fold increase in the rate of DNA synthesis (p less than 0.05) as assessed by incorporation of 3H-thymidine. However, TPA had no additive effect on the mitogenic response produced by epidermal growth factor (EGF) or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Inhibition of PKC using the antibiotic polymyxin B (20 micrograms/ml) abolished the TPA-induced mitogenic response in the five responsive lines tested. In two tumors (U138 and 9L), polymyxin B also eliminated EGF-, PDGF-, and serum-induced DNA synthesis as well as abolishing baseline DNA synthesis. These cells remained viable, however, as assessed by trypan blue exclusion; after removal of polymyxin B from the medium, they were able to resume DNA synthesis in response to TPA and serum. In the three other tumors (T98G and the two low-passage human glioma lines), growth factor-induced and serum-induced DNA synthesis were inhibited by approximately 25% to 85%. It is concluded that PKC-mediated pathways affect DNA synthesis in the human malignant glial tumors studied. The response of the glioma cells to TPA is similar to the responses seen in fetal astrocytes, but differs significantly from those reported for normal adult glial cultures. Because the response of the 9L glioma to TPA is similar to the responses seen in the human tumors, the 9L rat glioma model may prove useful for examining the role of PKC-mediated pathways in controlling glioma growth in vivo.\r"

Hepatic total and active HMG CoA reductase activity, plasma free cholesterol and liver triglyceride and phospholipid 18:2(n-6) levels were higher in fetuses of rats fed 20% than in those of rats fed 5% safflower oil. Fetuses of rats fed olive oil had higher active HMG CoA reductase levels than fetuses of rats fed 20% safflower or palm oil; their total reductase activity was similar to that of the safflower oil group and higher than that for the palm oil group. Fetal liver and plasma cholesterol and triglyceride, as well as liver phospholipid concentrations, were not altered by the type of oil fed. The diets containing safflower oil resulted in higher 18:2(n-6) and lower 18:1 levels in fetal liver phospholipid and triglycerides than did the diets containing palm or olive oil.

  ".W": "Three dietary studies using male Sprague-Dawley rats conditioned to meal-eat a high glucose, fat-free diet and one in vitro study with isolated rat hepatocytes were designed to examine the hypothesis that polyunsaturated fats (i.e., safflower oil or linoleate) are more potent acute inhibitors of liver fatty acid synthesis than are saturated fats (i.e., beef tallow or palmitate). Fat in the first in vivo study was administered via intubation (1500 mg/rat) whereas in the second and third in vivo studies fat was added to the meal in amounts of 50, 100, 250 or 500 mg/g fat-free diet. When the rats were in a postprandial condition, significant suppression of hepatic lipogenesis required the meal to contain 38% of its energy as fat (i.e., 250 mg/g fat-free diet). At this level of fat, safflower oil was more inhibitory than beef tallow (p less than 0.05). The inhibition constant (Ki) for palmitate inhibition of fatty acid synthesis by isolated hepatocytes was fourfold greater than linoleate's Ki (fatty acid/albumin ratio of 1.4/1). When fat constituted 50% of the ingested energy, beef tallow was equivalent to safflower oil as an inhibitor of lipogenesis. Although a single meal containing 50 mg safflower oil/g fat-free diet did not decrease fatty acid synthesis, it effectively delayed the induction of lipogenesis during the first 30 min of the adaptive decrease in lipogenic enzymes attributed to polyunsaturated fats extends to short-term regulatory mechanisms.\r"

Gas chromatography and mass spectrometry were used to identify HMB in these birds. A normal biochemical pathway of 5'-deoxy-5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA) is proposed as the source of naturally occurring HMB. Studies of conversion of [methyl-14C]MTA to L-methionine by chick liver enzymese showed that radiolabeled HMB and 2-oxo-4-(methylthio)butanoic acid (keto-methionine) were synthesized during the reaction. Specific radioactivities of labeled HMB and keto-methionine showed that HMB is not synthesized from keto-methionine. Fractionation studies indicated that radiolabeled HMB formed from [14C]MTA could be used in the synthesis of L-methionine in the presence of peroxisomes and/or mitochondrial enzymes. In this way, HMB synthesized from MTA by chick liver enzymes functions as a precursor of L-methionine and as an intermediate in a naturally occurring pathway for the synthesis of L-methionine in the chick.\r"

Ingestion of 0.2% cholic acid, sodium cholate or sodium taurocholate with 1% cholesterol (CH) significantly elevated serum and liver CH, liver triglycerides and liver weight compared to those values in control rats fed diets not containing CH and bile acids; 0.05 and 0.1% cholic acid with 1% CH were also effective. Ingestion of increasing amounts of HFOF, containing 0-10% dietary fiber, by rats made hypercholesterolemic with 1% CH and 0.1% cholic acid in the diet produced a significant inverse relationship between serum and liver cholesterol levels and HFOF intake; r = 0.48, p less than 0.0001 for serum CH and r = 0.55, p less than 0.0001 for liver CH. Because of the similarities in the responses of humans and of the cholesterol-fed rat to oat fiber ingestion, this dose-response relationship in the rat model suggests that larger intakes of soluble oat fiber sources may be accompanied by greater reduction in serum CH levels in humans.\r"

Six cats were fed a potassium-restricted diet (0.2% potassium) for 8 wk, and six cats were fed the same potassium-restricted diet plus a dietary acidifier (0.8% NH4Cl) for 8 wk. Both groups of cats were then fed the same diet supplemented with potassium gluconate (0.7% dietary potassium) for an additional 4 wk. Renal function was evaluated before treatment and again at 8 and 12 wk. Serum potassium concentration declined in all cats by wk 1 and was also lower in NH4Cl-treated cats at 2, 3, 6 and 8 wk than in control cats. Metabolic acidosis developed in both groups of cats. Dietary balance studies indicated negative potassium balance in NH4Cl-treated cats. Glomerular filtration rate declined significantly in NH4Cl-treated cats after 8 wk but was unchanged in control cats. From the results of this study, we conclude that adding a dietary acidifier to a potassium-restricted diet worsens hypokalemia, possibly by affecting gastrointestinal potassium handling, and induces severe metabolic acidosis and renal dysfunction in adult cats.\r"

Three experiments involving 218 7-wk-old pigs were conducted to investigate the effect of chloride-mediated alterations of dUA. The first two experiments evaluated the effect on pigs of decreasing dUA in either a corn-soybean meal type of diet (expt. 1) or one with a lower potassium content (expt. 2). As dietary chloride increased, and thus as dUA decreased, the rate of growth declined, mediated by changes in feed intake; the effect became more noticeable at extreme dUA levels. The increasing acidogenicity of the diets resulted in a lowering of blood pH, bicarbonate and base excess. The third experiment compared a corn-soybean meal control diet with diets containing two levels of added chloride (7.7 and 9.8 g/kg) at lowered dUA (388 vs. 172 vs. 98 mEq/kg) or at constant dUA (388 vs. 412 vs. 431 mEq/kg). Elevated chloride at constant dUA had no effect on pig performance or acid-base status (p greater than 0.05); however, chloride-mediated decreases in dUA depressed all growth parameters and induced an apparent acidemia. It was concluded that dUA is an important dietary component with the potential to alter pig performance and health. It was also clear that dUA is independent of specific mineral (chloride) effects.\r"

Uptake at low (0.1 mumol/L) but not high (20 mumol/L) riboflavin concentrations was inhibited by 50 mumol/L lumiflavin, anoxia, 5 mmol/L indoacetamide, Na(+)-free buffer and low temperature (Q10 = 1.64). Conclusions are as follows: 1) Saturable uptake of riboflavin occurs throughout the rat small intestine; 2) uptake by the jejunal mucosa is competitively inhibited and is consistent with a transport carrier located in the brush border membrane; 3) saturable uptake is energy-dependent and may be directly or indirectly driven by a Na+ gradient; and 4) riboflavin is also taken up by rat intestinal mucosa by a nonsaturable, energy-independent mechanism consistent with simple, passive diffusion.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of aging and dietary restriction on the expression of several enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase) that are involved in free radical detoxification were studied in liver tissue from male Fischer F344 rats. The expression (i.e., activities and mRNA levels) of superoxide dismutase (Cu-Zn) and catalase decreased with age in liver. Dietary restriction (40% restriction of energy intake) increased the activities of superoxide dismutase (24 to 38%) and catalase (64 to 75%) in liver at 21 and 28 mo of age. Glutathione peroxidase activity in liver of diet-restricted rats was significantly higher (37%) at 28 mo of age than that of rats fed ad libitum. The age-related changes in the relative levels of mRNA for superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase paralleled the changes in the activities of these enzymes in rats fed ad libitum or rats fed the restricted diet. Thus, the changes in the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase with age and dietary restriction appear to arise from changes in the levels of mRNAs coding for these enzymes. Free radical damage, as measured by thiobarbituric acid-reactive material and lipofuscin accumulation, was lower in diet-restricted rats than in rats fed ad libitum.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were conducted to assess whether changing dietary fat composition altered phospholipid composition of rat testicular plasma membranes in a manner that altered receptor-mediated action of luteinizing hormone (LH)/human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Weanling rats were fed diets that provided high or low cholesterol intakes and that were enriched with linseed oil, fish oil or beef tallow for 4 wk. Feeding diets high in (n-3) fatty acids decreased plasma and testicular plasma membrane 20:4(n-6) content. A marked reduction of the 22:5(n-6) content and an increase in the 22:6(n-3) content of testicular plasma membrane was found only in animals fed fish oil. A decrease in binding capacity of the gonadotropin (LH/hCG) receptor in the plasma membrane, with no change in receptor affinity, was observed for animals fed either linseed oil or fish oil diets. Dietary treatments that raised plasma membrane cholesterol content and the cholesterol to phospholipid ratio in the membrane were associated with increased binding capacity of the gonadotropin receptor. Feeding diets high in 18:3(n-3) vs. those high in fish oil altered receptor-mediated adenylate cyclase activity in a manner that depended on the level of dietary cholesterol. Feeding diets high in cholesterol or fish oil increased basal and LH-stimulated testosterone synthesis relative to that in animals fed the low cholesterol diet containing linseed oil. It is concluded that changing the fat composition of the diet alters the phospholipid composition of rat testicular plasma membranes and that this change in composition influences membrane-mediated unmasking of gonadotropin receptor-mediated action in testicular tissue.\r"

Kinetic parameters were determined by analyzing the lytic efficiency of splenocytes cultured for various times with several concentrations of radiolabeled P815 mastocytoma cells. The apparent avidity constant (K1/2) of the reaction was not changed by dietary SBO intake (1.0 +/- 0.2 x 10(5) cells for 20% SBO versus 1.3 +/- 0.3 x 10(5) cells for 5% SBO). However, the maximum velocity (Vmax) of the reaction for splenocytes from mice fed 20% SBO was significantly lower than that for splenocytes from mice fed 5% SBO (1.4 +/- 0.2 x 10(4) cells/h for 20% SBO versus 2.3 +/- 0.4 x 10(4) cells/h for 5% SBO, p less than 0.05). The evidence indicates that the rate of target cell lysis, but not the avidity of the lymphocytes for the target cell antigen, was altered by increasing dietary SBO concentration.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of these studies was to demonstrate that the reduction in lipogenic enzymes caused by ingestion of dietary polyunsaturated fat can in part be attributed to an inhibition of triiodothyronine's induction of hepatic lipogenic enzymes. A 3 x 4 factorial design was employed to examine the effect of diets containing no fat, beef tallow or safflower oil on the triiodothyronine-mediated (0, 2, 4 or 8 micrograms/100 g injected daily intraperitoneally) induction of rat liver lipogenic enzymes. Triiodothyronine (T3) administration induced (p less than 0.05) the activity of malic enzyme, fatty acid synthase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in a dose-dependent manner. Malic enzyme activity was increased five- to sevenfold by 8 micrograms T3/100 g daily. Fatty acid synthase activity at the 8 micrograms dose had increased two- to threefold whereas glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity was elevated only 15-35%. Beef tallow and safflower oil supplementation of the high glucose, fat-free diet significantly reduced the T3 induction of all the enzymes. Safflower oil was more effective than tallow as a repressor of T3 action. The effect of dietary fat, particularly safflower oil, was to increase the amount of T3 required to induce the activity of lipogenic enzymes. In a second study, with a 2 x 2 factorial design, daily injection of 15 micrograms T3/100 g was found to overcome the safflower oil inhibition of lipogenic enzymes. These data support the hypothesis that polyunsaturated fats uniquely suppress the gene expression of lipogenic enzymes by functioning as competitive inhibitors of T3 action, possibly at the nuclear receptor level.\r"

Antibodies to FIV were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 9 of 10 naturally infected cats, and the virus was cultured from the CSF of 5 of 9 of these cats. After experimental intrathecal or intra-bone-marrow inoculation, FIV antibodies were detected in CSF, as were CSF pleocytosis, increased IgG concentration, and elevated CSF IgG index. Brain lesions consisting of perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrates and both glial nodules and diffuse gliosis were observed in the midbrain and thalamus 7 months after inoculation. Virus was recovered by primary culture of brain tissue from several brain regions (cerebral cortex, caudate nucleus, midbrain, cerebellum, rostral and caudal brainstem) but was not recovered from choroid plexus. In vitro, FIV infected primary cultures of feline astrocytes and brain macrophages. Infection of astrocytes resulted in early syncytium formation, production of infectious virions, and eventual cell death. In brain macrophages, FIV infection was noncytopathic. Productive infection of feline neurons or oligodendrocytes was not observed. We conclude that FIV is a neurotropic lentivirus and that FIV infection of feline CNS may serve as a useful model for study of human immune deficiency virus infection of the human CNS.\r"

In the present study, NK cell function was examined in relation to different phases of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were tested for NK cell activity using K562 cell targets in a 51Cr-release assay. NK cell responses of 26 HIV-seronegative homosexual men were not significantly different from those of 30 heterosexual controls. NK activity was significantly lower in cells from 32 homosexual men with documented, early-phase HIV infection (average of 14 months; range of 3-27 months) as compared with that of seronegative men. The NK cell response decreased with time, since men within the first year of infection (n = 15; average of 7.8 months; range of 3-12 months) had greater NK cell activity than did those with longer duration of infection (n = 17; average of 18.3 months; range of 13-27 months). The decrease in NK cell activity did not correlate with altered numbers of cells bearing CD16 (NK) markers in these subjects. NK cell-mediated lysis and cell numbers were most severely depressed in a separate group of HIV-seropositive men who had acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). In vitro treatment with alpha-interferon (alpha-IFN) significantly enhanced NK activity of effector cells obtained from men within the first year of HIV infection but not in those with longer-term infection. Our results indicate that NK cell function decreases over time within the first 2 years of HIV infection in homosexual men, and is lowest in HIV-seropositive men with overt AIDS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This growth-promoting activity was apparently cell selective, being present in endothelial cell but not in fibroblast cultures.\r"

In all patients, serum levels of AZT and the glucuronidated metabolite (GAZT) were similar with and without acetaminophen administration. AZT serum levels were not increased (p less than 0.05). We believe that the rationale for withholding acetaminophen from patients receiving AZT should be re-evaluated.\r"

We attempted to maintain a high response rate and minimize the likelihood for developing PCP by designing a flexible low-dose weekly multidrug chemotherapy regimen that alternates two myelotoxic with one to two nonmyelotoxic drugs, concurrently with prophylactic aerosolized pentamidine. Eighteen homosexual men were treated, all of whom had had prior OIs or exhibited advanced mucocutaneous or visceral disease and/or systemic symptoms. In 17 evaluable patients, 16 partial responses but no complete responses were observed (objective response rate = 94%). Median time to response and response duration were 2 and 8 months, respectively. Toxicity was limited to a reversible sensory neuropathy in three patients, and five required blood transfusions. With a median follow-up time of 17 months, two cases of PCP and six other OIs occurred. Overall median survival was 12 months, with most of the deaths (8 of 14) secondary to recurrent KS. Weekly low-dose multidrug chemotherapy + PCP prophylaxis yields a high response rate but high relapse rate, a low incidence of PCP, and comparable or better survival to other regimens not employing PCP prophylaxis. Our results suggest that the optimal combined modality approach for patients with advanced HIV-KS should include a more intensive multidrug chemotherapy regimen in combination with a vigorous, broad-scoped prophylactic regimen for PCP and other potential OIs.\r"

The seroprevalence rates for antibodies to HIV-1 increased from 8.9% in 1986 to 9.9% in 1987 and 10.3% in 1988. Sera obtained in 1982 from 533 mothers of young infants in the same community revealed that 7.8% were HIV-1 seropositive. Of women pregnant for the first time in 1986-1988, 6.6% were HIV-1 seropositive and 6.0% had a positive VDRL. The highest seropositivity rates (greater than 15%) were noted in women 20 to 29 years of age with a history of two or more sexual partners in the year prior to pregnancy. Factors independently associated with HIV-1 seropositivity in pregnant women by logistic regression analysis included being unmarried, age 20-29 years, having had more than one sex partner in the year prior to pregnancy, a positive serologic test for syphilis, and smoking. A dose-response effect was noted in the association between HIV-1 seropositivity and smoking. The association between smoking and HIV-1 infections could be confounded by unrecognized behavioral factors or due to a biologic effect of smoking. The continuing high HIV-1 seropositivity rates in pregnant women indicate that current preventive measures are insufficient and increased control efforts are urgently needed.\r"

Among nonrespondents, recruitment attempts were repeated three times with intervals of 8-10 days. In total, 76.7% responded. Two hundred men (87.0% of the respondents) would accept an offer to be tested in an anti-HIV screening programme. Among respondents, 72.9% agreed to identify themselves to the researchers, 22.1% preferred to be tested under a code number known only by the participant himself, and 5% wanted the test information to be completely anonymous. Among the 30 men refusing HIV testing, 40% reported they were not concerned about AIDS, 16.7% expressed concern with confidentiality problems, and another 16.7% had been tested already and for this reason declined to participate. Previous reports have indicated high seroprevalences among nonrespondents and raised prevalences of behavior at high risk for HIV infection among persons who do themselves take the initiative to be tested or who decline to be tested because they worry about confidentiality. Low respondency and the associated disproportional loss of subjects at high risk of HIV infection may bias HIV seroprevalence estimates based on population probability sampling, especially in areas with low HIV infection prevalence. Because of these biases, voluntary population screening is likely to give only lower bound estimates of HIV seroprevalence. So, this technique should only be used in combination with other surveillance approaches.\r"

Nine of the participants (30%) had no detectable SIgA in their semen, while IgM and IgD were undetectable in all the semen samples. Analysis of proteins in the semen revealed an increase in the IgA:albumin ratio as compared to serum, while the IgG:albumin ratio was the same. The relative semen concentrations for IgA were generally slightly higher than and for IgG were lower than for albumin. Those levels did not correlate for IgA and albumin, while the IgG and albumin levels correlated with each other. A mathematical estimate of the amount of IgA produced locally showed no statistically significant difference between azoospermic and normospermic men. The data indicate that some men are capable of local IgG production.\r"

Repeat doses were utilized if no cervical change was evident and uterine activity was minimal. All the patients underwent continuous monitoring in the labor-and-delivery unit. Fifty patients with Bishop's scores of less than 4 underwent cervical ripening for a variety of obstetric indications. Forty-two patients (84%) achieved vaginal delivery. Three patients underwent cesarean delivery for fetal distress unrelated to hyperstimulation. Two additional patients experienced hyperstimulation; one of them required subcutaneous terbutaline. No other neonatal or maternal complications were encountered. Cervical ripening with prostaglandin chips may be a reasonable clinical alternative when one is faced with an obstetric indication for delivery in a patient with an unfavorable cervix.\r"

The reliability of the devices was compared with simultaneous measurements using a Dinamap 845A monitor on 22 pregnant hypertensive women. All measurements were performed without difficulty by a skilled observer and the patients. The accuracy varied, but each electronic device was considered as accurate as a mechanical aneroid unit available at the same retail stores.

In normal pregnancies the CA-125 levels increased significantly from the first week after the missed menses (39.9 +/- 8.2 U/mL [mean +/- SEM]) to the second week (48.3 +/- 6.9 U/mL) (P less than .05) and from the second to the third week (62.5 +/- 9.8) (P less than .05). After the third week after the missed menses the mean CA-125 serum concentrations plateaued, but levels observed during the fourth (59.6 +/- 8.8 U/mL) and fifth (48.8 +/- 7.2 U/mL) weeks were still significantly greater than at week 1. In addition, the mean CA-125 concentrations were significantly higher in normal pregnancies than in ectopic gestations during the second, third and fourth weeks after the missed menses. Although there was a tendency for the CA-125 levels to be lower in women who had a spontaneous abortion when compared to normals, these differences were not statistically significant. Serum levels of CA-125 may prove useful in monitoring early pregnancy.\r"

A review of the published data does not support calcium megadosing during postmenopause. Controlled studies showed no significant effect of calcium intake on mineral density of trabecular bone and a slight effect on cortical bone. Since PPMO is predominantly due to demineralization of trabecular bone, there is no justification for calcium megadosing in postmenopausal women. Soft tissue calcification is a serious risk factor during calcium megadosing under certain conditions. A total dietary program emphasizing magnesium instead of calcium for the management of PPMO takes into account the available data on the effects of magnesium, life-style and dietary habits on bone integrity and PPMO. When this dietary program was tested on 19 postmenopausal women on hormonal replacement therapy who were compared to 7 control postmenopausal women, a significant increase in mineral bone density of the calcaneous bone (BMD) was observed within one year. Fifteen of the 19 women had had BMD below the spine fracture threshold before treatment; within one year, only 7 of them still had BMD values below that threshold.\r"

An almost universally held tenet is that prenatal care is helpful in reducing those risks. In an attempt to support that belief, the records of all twins delivered at R. E. Thomason General Hospital between 1982 and 1985 were reviewed. Thirty-seven twin pregnancies received appropriate antepartum care, and 25 did not. There were statistically significant differences in the perinatal mortality rate of the clinic patients (68/1,000) versus the nonclinic patients (160/1,000). Also, significant differences were demonstrated between the mean birth weights: 2,007 g in the nonclinic group and 2,546 in the clinic group. The results suggest that intensive prenatal care in twin gestations promotes fetal growth and improves perinatal outcome.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective review was done on all patients at Tampa General Hospital with a surgically confirmed tuboovarian abscess between March 31, 1983, and April 30, 1988. Patients were grouped according to their menopausal status. Sixty-three were identified. Fifty-four were premenopausal and nine postmenopausal. The median ages of the two groups (26 and 52, respectively) were significantly different. The premenopausal patients had a significantly lower median parity and were significantly more likely to have a prior history of gonorrhea and/or pelvic inflammatory disease. The postmenopausal patients were significantly more likely to have contributing medical problems and to have concomitant genital tract pathology. Such pathology, found in 13% of the premenopausal patients, consisted mainly of large leiomyomata uteri. In 3 (33.3%) of the postmenopausal patients there was a strong preoperative suspicion of a coexisting pelvic abscess originating in the genital tract. Two of the patients developed septic shock shortly before surgery. Concomitant pelvic pathology was present in six patients (66.7%), with four of them having genital tract malignancies. An attempt at early recognition and surgical management of tuboovarian abscess is important in postmenopausal women. There is little to be gained by delaying surgical treatment, and the patient is at significant risk of deterioration. In addition, surgical exploration appears to be vital to the recognition and treatment of concomitant pelvic malignancy or other pathologic conditions that may be contributing to the abscess.\r"

Forty-three of the 52 (83%) had a total of 119 associated medical complications. Eighty-nine surgical procedures were performed. A total of 17 postoperative complications occurred in 15 patients. Thirty-eight patients (73%) had no postoperative complications. One patient died because of infarction of the bowel diagnosed within 30 days of her primary surgical procedure. The aged patients in this study did well postoperatively with routine preoperative medical evaluation and postoperative care. Same-day admission and surgery did not increase morbidity. Aged patients can safely undergo major pelvic and abdominal surgery at a community medical center if one manages their associated medical conditions in a routine manner similar to that utilized in younger patients with similar problems. The associated medical complications and not age per se should be the deciding factor.\r"

A wide-beam ultrasonic flow probe was chronically implanted to allow serial measurement of cephalic mesenteric arterial blood flow throughout the 48-hour experimental period. Sheep were sacrificed 48 hours following injury for quantitative organ culture of mesenteric lymph node, liver, spleen, kidney, and lung. Measurements of mesenteric blood flow demonstrated a decrease to 48 +/- 8%, 80 +/- 5%, and 64 +/- 9% of preinjury levels in sheep receiving thermal injury, smoke inhalation injury, and combination injury, respectively. The sham animals maintained mesenteric blood flow at 102 +/- 7% of control levels.

  ".U": "90278989\r", 
  ".W": "Hypertonic saline with dextran (HSD) has been recently introduced for prehospital resuscitation of hemorrhagic shock, and is currently undergoing clinical investigation. To determine the effect of clinically relevant amounts of hypertonic saline (7.5% NaCl) and/or 6% dextran 70 on non-ischemic and post-ischemic hearts, we infused rat hearts (Langendorff, 20 minutes global ischemia, 37 degrees, 40 minutes' reperfusion) with: 1) 0.9% NaCl (control); 2) 7.5% NaCl/dextran; 3) 7.5% NaCl; or 4) dextran. We found that 7.5% NaCl alone or with dextran depressed ventricular function (developed pressure, DP; contractility, +dP/dt; and relaxation rate, -dP/dt) in non-ischemic hearts. In contrast, equimolar (2,400 mOsm) sucrose increased myocardial contractility (+dP/dt) of non-ischemic hearts. Coronary flow was unchanged by the addition of 7.5% NaCl, dextran, or sucrose. Treatment of ischemic hearts with 7.5% NaCl/dextran, dextran alone, or sucrose improved recovery of ventricular function compared to 0.9% or 7.5% NaCl. Furthermore, dextran (but not sucrose) with or without 7.5% NaCl reduced myocardial hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels during ischemia and reperfusion. We conclude that when given in clinically relevant amounts in the isolated rat heart: 1) 7.5% NaCl directly depresses myocardial function; 2) 7.5% NaCl alone does not improve post-ischemic ventricular function; 3) 7.5% NaCl with dextran or dextran alone improves post-ischemic ventricular function in part by reducing myocardial H2O2; and 4) sucrose equimolar to 7.5% HSD increases ventricular function in non-ischemic and post-ischemic hearts. This investigation suggests that the post-shock benefit of HSD is unrelated to direct myocardial effects of saline but is due in part to toxic oxygen metabolite scavenging by dextran.\r"

Eight animals underwent 2 hours of hemorrhagic hypotension (50 mm Hg, bled volume = 43 +/- 7 ml/kg). This was followed by the intraosseous infusion of 200 ml (4-5 ml/kg) of 7.5% NaCl-6% dextran 70 into the bone marrow of the sternum. Results were compared to seven control animals (bled volume = 31 +/- 6 ml/kg) resuscitated through a central venous catheter. Despite the small volumes infused, mean arterial blood pressure and cardiac output were rapidly normalized in both groups by 10 minutes post resuscitation (p less than 0.01). Plasma sodium concentration increased an average of 12 mEq/L and plasma volume was rapidly expanded regardless of route. The metabolic acidosis of hemorrhagic shock was rapidly corrected, pulmonary pressures remained normal, and hypoxemia did not occur after intraosseous resuscitation. The device provided safe and rapid vascular access via the sternal bone marrow space. The use of intraosseous infusion of hypertonic saline dextran solutions via the sternal bone marrow may allow prehospital rescuers to consistently incorporate fluid replacement therapy into 'scoop and run' policies by avoiding the time delays associated with failures in IV access.\r"

However, circumstances during resuscitation, including multiple casualties, emergent operation, unconsciousness, etc., may interfere with this process. An initial review of our trauma registry data yielded a modest 2% incidence of missed injuries in a 90% blunt trauma population. In order to determine the true incidence of missed injuries, a tertiary survey was performed prospectively on all injured patients (N = 399) admitted during a recent 3-month period. After completion of the primary and secondary surveys (including appropriate roentgenographs), all injuries were listed in the trauma admission record. Patients were later reexamined immediately before ambulation or, in head-injured patients, upon regaining consciousness. All missed injuries were documented, including site and type of injury, reason missed, how identified, and attendant morbidity. Forty-one missed injuries were found in 36 patients (9%). These included: 21 extremity fractures, five spinal fractures, two facial fractures, five thoracic injuries, six abdominal injuries (including five splenic lacerations), and two vascular injuries. The most common reason for injuries to be missed was altered level of consciousness due to head injury or alcohol. Other reasons included severity of injury and instability requiring immediate operation, lack of symptoms at admission, technical problems, and low index of suspicion by the examiner. None of the missed injuries resulted in death. However, one missed injury caused serious disability and seven required operative correction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ten days following the implantation, splenic lymphocyte proliferation and lymphocyte surface expression of activation antigens (IL-2R and Ia) were analyzed following a 3-day culture period. In addition, peritoneal neutrophils were analyzed for oxidative burst activity using flow cytometry and a dye which reacts with intracellular hydrogen peroxide. Implantation of a 2 x 2 cm section of burned/unburned skin as well as implantation of a similar-sized piece of cotton gauze or collagen sheet resulted in subsequent suppression of both lymphocyte activation proliferation and neutrophil oxidative burst activity. An intense local inflammatory response to the burn wound may play a role leading to the profound systemic immune suppression which follows severe burn injury.\r"

Criteria are proposed for retrospectively classifying trauma patients as to whether they should have been treated at a trauma center. The criteria were developed by a panel of nationally recognized trauma experts and are based on the age of the patient and the type and AIS severity of injuries sustained. The criteria were then applied to uniformly collected data available for all trauma discharges in 1988 from acute care hospitals in a state with a well developed system of regionalized trauma care. According to the criteria, 19% of all trauma discharges in 1988 should have been treated at a trauma centers. Of those who should have been treated at a trauma center according to criteria, 66% actually received treatment at a center. Of those who were classified not to have required care at a trauma center, 62% actually were treated at non-trauma center hospitals. The congruence between where patients should have been treated and the actual level of hospital care received varied by the type and severity of the traumatic injuries sustained. The results of the analysis provide insights into the characteristics of trauma patients at higher risk of not getting the appropriate level of trauma care and should assist in improving guidelines for triage and transfer within a regionalized system of care.\r"

We hypothesized that the presence of three or more rib fractures on initial chest X-ray would identify a small subgroup of patients with a high probability of requiring trauma center care. All trauma discharges in Maryland between 1984 and 1986 (N = 105,683) were reviewed. Patients were divided by the presence of rib fractures (no rib fractures, 1-2 fractures, 3+ fractures) and age in years (0-13, 14-64, 65+). Results: The presence of three or more rib fractures in the pediatric age group was rare and precluded further evaluation. When comparing patients with 1-2 rib fractures versus 3 or more rib fractures, significant differences were found in mortality, mean Injury Severity Score, mean hospital stay and mean number of ICU days (p less than 0.001). The significant differences occurred in all age groups 14 years old and older. The presence of three or more rib fractures increased the relative risk of splenic injury (6.2) and liver injury (3.6) but did not predict the presence of aortic injury. Conclusion: The presence of 3 or more rib fractures identifies a small subgroup of patients (2.4%) likely to require tertiary care. This triage tool is useful in all patients over the age of 14 years.\r"

  ".W": "The early recognition of life-threatening injury is paramount to the prompt initiation of appropriate care. This study assesses the importance of multiple rib fractures as a marker of severe injury in children. We analyzed physiologic, etiologic, and injury data for 2,080 children with blunt or penetrating trauma aged 0-14 years consecutively admitted to a Level I pediatric trauma center. Analysis of variance, Student's t-test, and the Chi-square test of independence were used to test for differences between children with rib fractures and other children. Probability of survival was modeled using stepwise logistic regression. There were 14 deaths among 33 children with rib fractures, a mortality rate of 42%. Child abuse accounted for 63% of the injuries to children less than 3 years old, while pedestrian injuries predominated among older children. Children with rib fractures were significantly more severely injured than children with blunt or penetrating trauma but without rib fractures. When compared to children without rib fractures, children with rib fractures had a higher mortality rate, but no statistically significant difference in morbidity. The mortality rate for the 18 children with both rib fractures and head injury was 71%. A logistic model with variables measuring severity of head injury and number of ribs fractured correctly predicted survival in more than 85% of children with thoracic trauma. Although rib fractures are rare injuries in childhood, they are associated with a high risk of death. The risk of mortality increases with the number of ribs fractured. The combination of rib fractures and head injury was usually fatal.\r"

  ".W": "In the last 10 years, our center has managed 60 cases of aortic rupture from blunt chest trauma. Nineteen patients died (32%), 11 of whom were moribund on admission. Two patients out of ten who had undergone aortography at other institutions arrived at our hospital with massive bleeding in the left chest and died despite immediate operation. Six patients exsanguinated 1 to 2 1/2 hours after admission while aortography was being arranged or performed, and review of these cases to identify clinical signs of high risk revealed that left hemothorax, pseudocoarctation, and/or supraclavicular hematoma were present in five of the six. It appeared that the survival rate of patients suspected of blunt aortic trauma who had any of these clinical signs might be improved if they were taken directly to the operating room. To investigate this possibility we reviewed all cases from the past 10 years (excluding patients moribund on arrival or who had aortography elsewhere) in whom suspicion of aortic trauma led to aortography or surgery. Thirteen of the 17 patients (76%) with one or more signs of high risk had torn the aortic isthmus, compared to 26 of 154 patients (17%) without these signs. Five of the high-risk group (29%) exsanguinated, compared to one (less than 1%) of the others. No patient in this series died from unsuspected aortic trauma, which we attribute to the liberal use of aortography. Except for the patients with exsanguinating hemorrhage preoperatively, there were no operative or postoperative deaths.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The microcirculation of the terminal ileum was observed in vivo videomicroscopy, and changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) as well as arteriolar diameters were recorded after a 30-min period in which the MAP was reduced by 50% by bleeding. Volume was restored with shed blood alone (control); dextran 70 alone (dextran); or dextran + hypertonic (7.5%) saline (dextran + HS). A final group of rats was pretreated with allopurinol 5 mg/kg and then treated identically to the control group to assess the role of the xanthine oxidase system in microcirculation changes following hemorrhage. MAP was restored to normal by return of shed blood in control animals, but inflow arterioles (A1) remained significantly constricted. MAP was significantly higher and A1 arteriolar dilation was observed in the dextran + HS group. Responses in allopurinol-pretreated animals were not different from the responses seen in control animals. We conclude that persistent arteriolar constriction is produced by moderate hypovolemia and this effect is ameliorated by volume restoration with dextran + HS.\r"

Admission GCS was less than or equal to 4 in 84% of the donors. Complications included hypotension (81%), multiple transfusion requirements (63%), diabetes insipidus (53%), DIC (28%), arrhythmias (27%), cardiac arrest requiring CPR (25%), pulmonary edema (19%), hypoxia (11%), acidosis (11%), seizures (10%), and positive bacterial cultures (10%). Only 18% of organs were procured within 3 hours of brain death; 23% were procured more than 6 hours later. Six patients excluded from this study suffered cardiovascular collapse before their organs could be retrieved. From 114 organ donors, consent was obtained to procure 224 kidneys, 77 livers, 62 hearts, 35 pancreata, and ten heart-lung units. All 224 donated kidneys were procured and 202 were ultimately transplanted. Of 77 donated livers, 32 were procured; 31 transplanted. Of 62 donated hearts, 38 were procured; 29 transplanted and nine used for valves. Ten heart-lung units were donated; six were procured and transplanted. Of 35 donated pancreata, 11 were procured; only five were transplanted. Reasons for failure of donated organs to be procured or transplanted included abnormal organ characteristics, lack of compatible recipients, unavailability of surgical teams, organ injury during procurement, intraoperative arrest, and anatomic limitations precluding multiple organ procurement. This study identifies characteristics of organ donors and common organ-threatening complications. Rapid and continuing resuscitation of clinically brain dead trauma victims is mandatory.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Long bone fractures were not associated with an increased risk. The majority of pulmonary emboli were diagnosed during the first week of hospitalization with some as early as 24 hours and none later than 15 days postinjury. Although the etiology of these early emboli is uncertain, prolonged immobilization does not appear to play a role in placing these patients at increased risk for thromboembolic events. Pulmonary embolism should be suspected in any injured patient with respiratory compromise, and an aggressive approach to diagnosis is warranted.\r"

This study describes the fasting indirect calorimetry, and nutritional measurements made on a homogeneous group of Black patients with carcinoma of the esophagus. It compares them with a reference group. All cancer patients had localized disease and were markedly malnourished. They were on average 20 to 25% lighter than reference subjects. In the cancer patients, the triceps skinfold thickness (TSF) in mm and the hand grip strength in kg/m2, mean and SD, were, respectively, 7.3 +/- 2.8 and 28 +/- 6 for men and 12 +/- 5 and 22 +/- 3.5 for women, and were significantly lower than those of the reference subjects. Fat-free mass was calculated from the TSF measurements. In men with cancer RMR (6.06 MJ/day +/- 0.56) was significantly lower than the reference subjects values (7.07 MJ/day +/- 0.64) p = 0.002. In women with cancer RMR was on average 2 MJ/day less than in controls but this difference failed to reach significance. However, when expressed per kg fat free mass, or per kg body weight this difference is no longer apparent the RMR being 0.14 MJ/kg/fat free mass in both groups. Our interpretation is that there is no direct effect of the tumour on RMR and that energy expenditure changes are secondary to body composition changes.\r"

Total body water was overestimated by 0.5 liter, with SD of 0.47 liter, when compared to a mean tritium dilution space of 36.7 liter. Changes in total body water which occurred over a treatment period of at least 1 week were also measured by the two methods. The change as measured by isotopic dilution could be estimated from the change as measured by BIA with a standard error of 2.25 liter. Although the results suggest that BIA should not be used as a research tool, it is concluded that in clinical practice, when nutrient requirements are being estimated, fat-free mass measured by BIA may have a useful place.\r"

The amounts of essential amino acids except for BCAA were equal in all the solutions. Rats weighing about 240 g were infused with about 200 mg of nitrogen and 10 g of glucose daily for 7 days and evaluated for body weight change, nitrogen balance, plasma and urinary amino acid levels, and plasma constituent levels. The body weights of all the groups were approximately maintained during the infusion period. The nitrogen balance of the BCAA-31 group was more positive than that of the BCAA-22 group and was not different from those of the BCAA-40 and BCAA-49 groups. Plasma total-protein level of the BCAA-31 group was higher than that of the BCAA-22 group and was equal to those of the BCAA-40 and BCAA-49 groups. Even when the BCAA content in an amino acid infusion was increased, no abnormal elevation was observed in plasma BCAA levels. There were no differences in the other nutritional parameters among the four infusion groups. These results suggest that the BCAA contents in an amino acid infusion are enough at 31% of total amino acids for this injured rat model.\r"

The prothrombin time was measured on the plasma from these samples and compared to the prothrombin time of the plasma samples without lipid. The mean decrease in prothrombin times were: 0.29 sec at 50 micrograms/ml, 0.23 sec at 100 micrograms/ml, and 0.29 sec at 200 micrograms/ml. All concentrations showed a statistically significant decrease (p less than 0.05) when compared to the control by the Scheffe test. Lipid emulsions appear to decrease the prothrombin times in anti-coagulated patients. The differences however, were small and not of clinical significance at the concentrations tested.\r"

Following surgery and removal of the septic focus, serum iron, ferritin, and zinc levels increased, while serum transferrin levels decreased significantly.

  ".W": "Cigarette smoke contains many xenobiotics, including oxidants and free radicals, which can increase lipid peroxidation. Recently, breath pentane output (BPO) has been recognized as a good indicator of lipid peroxidation. Vitamin E is known to be a potent free radical scavenger which can protect biological membranes against oxidative damage. We investigated the effect of vitamin E (dl-alpha-tocopherol) on lipid peroxidation in 13 healthy smokers. The results showed (1) smokers had increased BPO as compared with 19 healthy non-smokers (16.3 +/- 1.9 vs 5.8 +/- 0.5, pmol/kg body weight/min, p less than 0.001) although both groups had comparable plasma vitamin E and selenium concentrations, (2) supplementation with vitamin E (800 mg/day for 2 weeks) decreased BPO in smokers, and (3) the concentration of plasma selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase was restored to normal in those smokers (five out of 13) in whom this was low initially. We conclude that a normal plasma concentration of vitamin E does not prevent this increase of lipid peroxidation in smokers but that substantial doses of vitamin E will significantly reduce this increased lipid peroxidation. If a major function of vitamin E is to protect lipids from peroxidation, then smokers have a conditioned insufficiency of vitamin E on a normal diet.\r"

  ".W": "The presence and amount of the anti-inflammatory protein lipocortin 1 was determined in plasma and peripheral blood leucocytes by a highly specific, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Within 120 min of a single intravenous dose of 100 mg hydrocortisone, the intracellular concentrations of lipocortin 1 in peripheral monocytes in 7 of 8 healthy men increased by a median of 225% (range 129-507%) compared with pretreatment levels, and mononuclear cell-surface lipocortin increased by a median of 224% (range 76-483%). Placebo injections had no effect. There was no increase at any time in free plasma or polymorph-associated lipocortin. In 3 of 4 subjects, induction of lipocortin was also observed when whole unseparated blood was incubated in vitro after steroid administration, but cells which had first been isolated and purified were refractory to such induction. Thus rapid changes in the concentration of an active anti-inflammatory protein can occur in man after normal therapeutic doses of hydrocortisone.\r"

Of these HIV-1 seropositive individuals, 23 were also infected with human T-lymphotropic virus type I or II (HTLV-I/II). To test the hypothesis that HTLV-I/II infection has an effect on the survival of HIV-1 seropositive IVDUs, various baseline clinical and laboratory HIV-1 related indices in HTLV-I/II positive and negative groups were compared. Life table analysis and Cox's proportional hazards model were used to estimate the potential effect of HTLV-I/II infection on the survival patterns of people infected with HIV-1. IVDUs infected with both viruses were three times more likely to die from AIDS during follow-up than were those infected with HIV-1 only. This finding suggests that HTLV-I/II seropositivity may adversely affect the clinical outcome of HIV-1 seropositive patients.\r"

At the time of decompressive surgery, excessive movement was found at the stenotic levels, so a simple stabilization procedure was performed using Knodt rods and a facet fusion. The expectation was that spine fixation would decrease the amount of postoperative back pain, which can be a result of continued abnormal mobility. All of the patients have been followed for 2 or more years. This elderly group of individuals tolerated surgery well, and long-term results were good.\r"

  ".W": "Endogenous opioids have been implicated as a cause of secondary damage after neural injury. The basis for this statement is primarily indirect evidence from studies that demonstrate neurological or physiological improvement when opiate antagonists are given. This study directly evaluates the level of the endogenous opioid beta-endorphin in 15 patients with severe head injury. Levels of immunoreactive beta-endorphin (ir-beta E) from ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (vCSF) and serum were determined less than 24 hours after trauma. No significant correlation was found with the degree of initial injury, age, sex, or either 6- or 12-month outcome. Levels of ir-beta E from vCSF were significantly lower in patients who had received intravenous administration of morphine sulfate (48.4 +/- 5.8 versus 85.9 +/- 10.1 pg/ml, P = 0.008). No correlation was found between vCSF levels of ir-beta E and elapsed time after injury. Although vCSF and serum ir-beta E were correlated (r = 0.532, P = 0.050), the latter exhibited a different profile; the mean level of serum ir-beta E was not significantly different in those patients who received morphine, and serum ir-beta E had a significant negative correlation with time after injury (r = -0.587, P = 0.03). These results do not support a relationship between acute levels of vCSF or serum ir-beta E and the degree of neurological injury or outcome after severe head trauma. This article, therefore, is a contribution to the body of literature in which the purported detrimental effect of beta-endorphin was not demonstrated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirty-eight patients were studied. Patients were assigned to groups sequentially upon admission. There were no significant differences between the two groups for age, sex, preoperative hematoma volume, and density on computed tomographic scan. One patient in Group A (5%) suffered a recurrence as opposed to 6 in Group B (33%). The difference in recurrence rate between the two groups was statistically significant (P less than 0.05). The authors conclude that closed-system drainage after burr-hole irrigation reduces the recurrence rate of chronic subdural hematoma.\r"

In this series the authors present their experience with 48 patients who have been followed for periods ranging from 6 months to 10 years. Long-term pain control was achieved in 30 patients (63%). Both the periventricular gray and specific sensory thalamic nuclei have been used as targets. Our results indicate that there is an initial 2-year fall-off of pain control caused by idiopathic tolerance, with stable results thereafter, regardless of site of the implant. This is suggestive of some biochemical modification of tissues around the electrode. Patients with failed-back syndrome secondary to multiple disc operations fared well; those with pain secondary to progressive neurological disorders or cancer had only short-term pain relief, and those with thalamic pain, cauda equina injury, or phantom limb pain usually had a poor result.

Pain relief was obtained in 95% of the treated patients. Permanent morbidity was as follows: masseter weakness in 105 patients; oculomotor palsies in 5 patients; weakening of the corneal reflex in 197 patients, 6 of whom requested an ocular operation for keratitis; and painful dysesthesia in 52 patients, 15 of whom developed a painful anesthesia syndrome. There was a recurrence rate of 18.1%, and a correlation between postoperative sensory deficit and the cure rate was found. These results are discussed and compared to the results obtained with different techniques.\r"

Twenty patients were entered into this study: 13 were treated with 1-(4-amino-2-methyl-5-pyrimidinyl)methyl-3-(2-chloroethyl)-3-nitrosourea hydrochloride (ACNU) and 7 with methyl 6-[3-(2-chloroethyl-3-nitrosoureido]-6-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranoside (MCNU). On the average, a single dose of 20 mg of ACNU was administered 15 times, for a total dose of 295 mg in each case, while a single dose of 11 mg of MCNU was given 2 times, for a total dose of 24 mg. These nitrosoureas provoked greater toxicity when the administration dose was larger or the indwelling multiperforated Silastic basket was in direct continuity with the ventricle or the basal cistern. Usually ACNU was well tolerated, whereas MCNU induced marked brain edema. Side effects consisted of headache, nuchal stiffness, vomiting, motor weakness, and cranial nerve palsy for ACNU, and headache, vomiting, abnormal respiration, and arrhythmia for MCNU. Pathological changes were represented by capsule formation, spongy degeneration and reactive gliosis of adjacent white matter, occlusion of neighboring arteries, and demyelination of cranial nerves in the patients treated with ACNU, while they were represented by focal brain necrosis in two patients treated with MCNU. The differences in neurotoxity of ACNU and MCNU conceivably derive from the different blood-brain delivery of these drugs.\r"

  ".U": "90279848\r", 
  ".W": "Forty-two patients with large pituitary tumors were studied with magnetic resonance imaging scans. Based on the operative findings, the tumors were divided into two groups. Tumors in Group 1 (n = 35) were soft or partially necrotic and were easily removed by suction and curettage. Tumors in Group 2 (n = 7) were firm and required sharp dissection or use of the laser for removal. Tumors were divided into two groups based on the long TR signal: a) isointense in comparison with white matter, or b) hyperintense in comparison with white matter. All 7 firm tumors (Group 2) had an isointense signal on long TR sequences. Thirty-two of 35 soft tumors showed a hyperintense signal on long TR sequences, and 3 an isointense signal. Based on these results, we recommend a transsphenoidal approach for the initial operation in patients with large pituitary tumors. If the tumor is largely isointense on the magnetic resonance imaging scan, we discuss with the patient preoperatively the possibility (70% in this series) that the tumor may be too firm to remove in a single transsphenoidal procedure. In these circumstances, a second, transcranial, procedure may be required to decompress the suprasellar structures adequately.\r"

The majority of patients showed increased ICP intraoperatively irrespective of the preoperative Hunt and Hess grade and the amount of subarachnoid blood accumulation or intraventricular blood clot. Intraoperative drainage of cerebrospinal fluid allowed easy access for aneurysm dissection by making the brain slack in more than 90% of patients. Postoperative ICP measurements revealed that significant brain swelling did not occur in the majority of patients. In 7 patients, persistently elevated ICP (greater than 20 mm Hg) was recorded. Nine patients (8%) developed shunt-dependent hydrocephalus; all of these patients had suffered an intraventricular hemorrhage. Measurements of the volumes of cerebrospinal fluid drained did not allow prediction of shunt-dependent hydrocephalus.\r"

The latter cistern was found to contain only the terminal segments of the posterior communicating artery. The hypothalamic branches were within the inner wall of the arachnoidal cistern surrounding the posterior communicating artery. The variations in diameter of this artery are explained by its embryological development and are not related to the number and the diameter of the perforators. The posterior communicating artery was absent at times. The surgical implications of such a variable anatomical arrangement are discussed in the light of the literature.\r"

Investigation of this patient revealed no immunological dysfunction, lymphoproliferative disorder, or candidicidal defect of peripheral blood leukocytes. Sequential measurement of Candida mannan antigen in CSF was useful for establishing the early diagnosis of cerebral candidiasis and for judging the effect of our antifungal chemotherapy. In determining the surgical indications and timing of placement of a ventriculoperitoneal or ventriculoatrial shunt for meningitis subsequent to hydrocephalus after candidal infection, it is better to confirm normal concentrations of the mannan antigen in the CSF repeatedly for more than a week and to determine that cultures of the CSF are negative for Candida albicans.\r"

The most commonly reported type of persistent carotid-basilar anastomosis is the primitive trigeminal artery, followed by the primitive hypoglossal artery (PHA). In this report, a 30-year-old, right-handed woman hospitalized because of subarachnoid hemorrhage and harboring an intracerebral-intraventricular hematoma resulting from the rupture of one of two independent AVMs of the left cerebral hemisphere, was found also to have a right persistent PHA. One AVM was intraventricular and had ruptured; the other was subcortical, intact in the parietal lobe. The PHA originated as a large anomalous branch of the right internal carotid artery in the neck and joined the basilar artery after entering the posterior fossa through the ipsilateral anterior condyloid foramen, which was enlarged. At craniotomy, the two AVMs were successfully excised with the aid of microsurgical technique. These two independently rare conditions, namely, multifocal cerebral AVMs and persistent PHA, warrant our desire to report this case.\r"

Electrical stimulation of the ARH for 20 sec at 8 Hz produced a more potent elevation of the TFL (98%) and PWT (68%) compared to when stimulation was applied to the same site at 2 Hz (41% and 25%, respectively), 32 Hz (64% and 42%) and 128 Hz (57% and 39%). An even more marked and longer attenuation of the nociceptive reflexes was observed when the ARH stimulation was extended to a period of 1 or 3 min. Microinjection of the excitant amino acid, L-glutamate (0.5 M, 0.1 mul), into the same areas of the ARH consistently elicited antinociception to an extent similar to that observed with electrical stimulation. The data indicate that 8 Hz seems to be an optimal frequency for stimulating ARH to produce an analgesic effect as tested by the two spinal nociceptive reflexes.\r"

Relative to a baseline cold pressor immersion, subjects in both the distraction conditions reduced their 1 min pain ratings more than control subjects. This effect was weaker at the 2 min pain rating and absent at the later ratings. The affective-reactive response to pain was measured by pain tolerance times. Tolerance time was defined as the time when subjects removed their arm from the cold pressor. Tolerance time was not altered by the distraction tasks. These findings suggest that affectively neutral distraction alters the sensory but not the reactive response to pain. Clinical implications are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Two invasive studies (invasive study I and invasive study II) showed positive effects of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) in pacing-induced angina pectoris in terms of increased tolerance to pacing, improved lactate metabolism and less anginal pain. Invasive study I demonstrated a decrease in left ventricular afterload by TENS treatment as reflected by a fall in systolic blood pressure, and this fact was thought to be explained by reduced sympathetic activity since arterial levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine dropped during TENS in TENS responders. In invasive study II, the influence of naloxone on the effects of TENS in pacing-induced angina pectoris was studied in 11 patients with severe coronary artery disease. The patients were catheterized and treated with TENS on 2 occasions; one with a single intravenous (i.v.) dose of saline as placebo and one with a single i.v. dose of 50 mg naloxone, double-blind, in random order. Treatment with TENS increased tolerance to pacing (P less than 0.01 with placebo and P less than 0.01 with naloxone, respectively) and improved lactate metabolism (P less than 0.05 with placebo and P less than 0.01 with naloxone, respectively). The positive effects of TENS were thus reproducible and not reversed by single i.v. doses of naloxone. The results of this study indicate that the effects of TENS on the heart are not mediated by beta-endorphin but do not exclude activation of more short-acting opioids like delta or kappa receptor agonists (met-enkephalin and/or dynorphin) since naloxone has a low affinity for these receptors. It is also possible that non-opioid mechanisms are of importance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The sample consisted of 30 female patients with a definite diagnosis of RA and a functional capacity of class II. The results indicated that the pain fluctuated during the day. The intensity level of present pain was lower than that of usual pain. Eight patients reported that their worse pain occurred several times/day. Ache was the word most frequently chosen by the subjects to denote their pain sensations. A high correlation r = 0.86 (P less than 0.01) was found between the scores of RAI and present pain on the VAS. This finding suggests that the pain in RA is associated with the hyperalgesic state induced by the inflammatory condition associated with RA. There was no significant correlation between blood tests like ERS, WBC and VAS or RAI.\r"

A chronic pelvic pain program was developed to offer an alternative treatment approach for women for whom standard gynecological procedures were inappropriate or unsuccessful. Sixteen subjects completed the full 6-8 week interdisciplinary program, which included both somatic and behavioral therapies. Compared to a waiting list control the results showed a dramatic decrease in reported levels of pain following treatment. Anxiety and depression also decreased and psychosocial functioning improved, including return to work, increased social activities, and improved sexual activity. The outcome suggests that the interdisciplinary pain management approach is effective for the treatment of chronic pelvic pain.\r"

Of the 239 patients who entered the follow-up study, 87% responded to either a mailed questionnaire or a follow-up telephone call by an independent reviewer at the time of 3 year follow-up; the improvement had been maintained by 46.6% of the successfully treated patients (or a third of the original participants). The present finding is strikingly similar to that in a previous study from this institution - an indication of the long-term efficacy of the multidisciplinary pain management program. Further search for modifications for the existing program is indicated to accommodate the needs of patients who fail initially or cannot maintain the improvement.\r"

  ".W": "A direct comparison of the analgesic activities of heroin and hydromorphone was carried out in cancer patients with postsurgical pain. Intramuscular doses of 5 and 10 mg of heroin were compared with 1 and 2 mg of hydromorphone in a randomized, double-blind, 4-point parallel group assay. Design innovations in the study provided that about half the patients would receive prior repeated doses of the same drug as the test medication, and half would receive the alternate medication. Both test drugs were found to be potent, relatively short acting analgesics with similar profiles of action. Hydromorphone was about 5 times as potent as heroin on a milligram basis. The comparison of those patients who had repeated doses of the same treatment prior to the test dose and those who had repeated doses of the alternate drug demonstrated no significant effect on the relative potency estimates. Side effect occurrence was similar for both drugs, with sleepiness the most prominent effect. The study supports the view that hydromorphone and heroin produce similar clinical effects, and that either drug may adequately substitute for the other. Covariate analysis indicated that time since last analgesic was positively related to analgesia, and amount of prior opioid had a negative relationship. To a lesser extent, increase in patient age was associated with an increase in analgesic scores. Taking these covariates into account served to increase the sensitivity of the analysis.\r"

For this purpose, experiments were carried out on rats under urethane anaesthesia in which activity was elicited by electrical stimulation of afferent C fibres in the sural nerve. Recordings were made ipsi- or contralaterally from single neurones in the dorsomedial part of the ventral nucleus (VDM) of the thalamus. The 3 drugs produced a dose-dependent depression of the evoked activity which amounted to about 60% of the controls at the highest doses employed and lasted longer than 60 min. Their potency ranking, according to the ED50 values (in brackets), is: indomethacin (5 mg/kg) greater than diclofenac (10.9 mg/kg) greater than ibuprofen (15.6 mg/kg). The results suggest that a central action might contribute to the analgesia produced by these non-steroid anti-inflammatory agents.\r"

  ".W": "This study investigated the involvement of endogenous opioid peptides in mediating cold water swim (CWS) stress-induced antinociception (SIA) in rats with unilateral hind paw inflammation induced by Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA). Following 0.5, 1 and 2 min of CWS, there was a duration-dependent elevation of paw pressure threshold (PPT) in both inflamed and non-inflamed paws which was maximal immediately after CWS and returned to control values within 15 min. The antinociception elicited in the inflamed paw was significantly greater than that elicited in the non-inflamed paw. The antinociception induced by a 1 min CWS was dose dependently antagonized by tertiary naloxone (0.125-1 mg/kg s.c.) and completely reversed by tertiary naltrexone (0.5 mg/kg). Quaternary naltrexone (5-40 mg/kg s.c.) was similarly effective in reversing the elevation of inflamed PPT induced by a 1 min CWS stress. In contrast, similar doses of quaternary naltrexone had no effect against centrally mediated morphine antinociception in non-inoculated rats. Adrenalectomy was without effect on the pattern of SIA seen in FCA-treated rats. Surgical hypophysectomy completely abolished the differential antinociception induced by 0.5 and 1 min durations of CWS but had little effect on that following 2 min of CWS stress. Inhibition of hypophysial corticotrophic cell secretion with dexamethasone (300 micrograms/kg) injected s.c. 120 min prior to CWS completely abolished the differential SIA at all durations of CWS tested. beta-Endorphin 12.5 micrograms/kg administered i.v. in non-stressed rats also caused a greater elevation of PPT in inflamed than in non-inflamed paws. This effect was not reversed by concomitant i.v. administration of (-) tertiary naloxone 5 mg/kg or quaternary naltrexone 20 mg/kg.\r"

  ".W": "Substance P (SP) found in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord has been proposed as a mediator of nociception. Formalin injected into the hind paw of a rat as a nociceptive stimulus has been shown to increase the amount of immunoreactive SP in the dorsal horn, perhaps by decreasing SP release from primary afferent neurons. These SP changes may be due to the actions of endogenous opiates which can block SP release from primary afferent neurons. In order to determine the time course of SP changes in the dorsal horn and their modulation by naloxone, anesthetized rats pretreated subcutaneously with naloxone or saline were injected in the right hind paw with 0.4 ml of either saline or 5% formalin. After various time intervals, the animals were perfused and the lumbar enlargement of the spinal cord removed. Immunohistochemical staining and manual photometry were used to quantitate SP-like immunoreactivity (SPLI) in the dorsal horn. The results show that saline injection produced an increase in SPLI lasting 20 min, while formalin produced a biphasic effect with early (0-20 min) and late (20-60 min) increases in SPLI. Naloxone pretreatment 30 min prior to hind paw injection partially blocked the initial SPLI increase due to saline or formalin. However, this was not the case if naloxone was injected 2 min following hind paw injection. The formalin-induced late SPLI increase was blocked by naloxone only if it was administered prior to the formalin. This blockade of SPLI increases in the dorsal horn by naloxone implies that endogenous opioid systems play a role in the control of SP levels in the dorsal horn during nociception.\r"

A total of 605 patients were studied, 392 Bedouins and 213 Jews, 441 of whom had diarrhea (449 episodes) and 164 did not. Rotavirus was the most common organism detected in children with diarrhea (63 of 444; 14%) but was rarely found in controls (3 of 163; 2%) (P less than 0.001). In 22% (12 of 54) of the rotavirus-positive patients, at least one other organism was also detected. The rate of rotavirus detection decreased as age increased, from 18% in the first year to 8% in the third year of life. Hospitalization with rotavirus diarrhea occurred more frequently in the summer. However, during winter, when diarrhea was less prevalent in the community, the proportion of cases associated with rotavirus was higher. Compared with controls, malnourished children were more likely to be hospitalized. However, rotavirus was detected in similar proportions among well-nourished and malnourished cases with diarrhea. The most prevalent rotavirus serotype was type 1 (in 69%), followed by types 4 and 2 (18 and 13%, respectively). We estimated that during the study period, approximately 2% of all Bedouin infants vs. only 0.2% of Jewish infants were hospitalized with rotavirus disease in their first year of life. Clinical signs and symptoms and stool appearance were not useful in predicting rotavirus detection. Malnutrition seems to be an important indicator of disease severity, which may explain why the toll of rotavirus-associated morbidity and mortality is particularly high among children in developing countries.\r"

The annual incidence rate among children younger than 5 years of age was 51/100,000 (48/100,000 for Jews and 58/100,000 for Bedouins).

Twenty-six percent of the cases were 6 months old or younger, 75% were 1 year old or younger and 87% were 18 months old or younger. Ninety-five percent of all meningitis cases occurred during the first 18 months of life. A projected number of 2938 hospitalization days and 9.8 deaths/year for a population in which 100,000 births occur yearly was calculated.

Because the evaluation of the spread of Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) isolates through a population, such as children in day care centers, requires stable identification markers for the bacteria, this study used multilocus enzyme electrophoresis to separate Hib carried by day care attendees from the disease-associated Hib clone. The three meningitis episodes were caused by the same clone of Hib (ET14). This and other Hib clones occurred in the healthy carriers. The frequency of H. influenzae carriage and composition of the H. influenzae flora differed between the two day care centers. Center I with the meningitis cases had a lower overall frequency of H. influenzae carriage, 11 of 40 (28%) compared with both the control day care center (57%) and previous studies. The main difference between the two day care centers was in the nontypable H. influenzae (HiNT) flora. The frequency of HiNT was higher in the center without Hib disease, and there was a higher degree of sharing of HiNT isolates among the children in Center II. This raised the question of an inverse relationship between carriage of HiNT and Hib infection. The results emphasized the importance of accurate identification of the disease isolate in order to estimate the risk of acquisition and dissemination to secondary cases.\r"

Complement-dependent bactericidal activity was absent in acute sera but increased to titers of 1:4 to 1:32 in sera obtained 4 to 6 weeks later. Absorption of anti-lipooligosaccharide antibodies from convalescent sera had no effect on bactericidal titers of five patients and resulted in small decreases in titer in three patients. Lipooligosaccharide-absorbed samples had persisting bactericidal titers of 1:4 to 1:16. Four of eight acute samples lacked antibodies to surface-exposed outer membrane proteins whereas four had low concentrations of antibody directed against one or more Mr 100,000 to 250,000 outer membrane proteins. Convalescent samples from all eight children showed substantial increases in antibodies directed primarily against Mr 100,000 to 250,000 proteins. Thus, both surface-exposed Mr 100,000 to 250,000 outer membrane proteins and lipooligosaccharide are immunogenic during Haemophilus otitis media and are potential targets of bactericidal antibody.\r"

Vincristine-resistant cells respond more rapidly to hybrid polar/apolar inducers than the parental cells. These vincristine-resistant MELCs contain elevated levels of the beta isozyme of PKC (PKC-beta). Exogenous homologous murine PKC-beta, incorporated into permeabilized MELCs, accelerates induced differentiation. Neither rat PKC-beta, nor mouse PKC-alpha, nor rat PKC-alpha, incorporated into permeabilized MELCs, is effective in altering the kinetics of induced differentiation. This provides direct evidence for a rate-limiting role for this PKC isozyme during N,N'-hexamethylenebisacetamide-mediated induced differentiation of a transformed cell.\r"

One family affected with the hemophilia B Leyden phenotype was found to have a specific single-base mutation (G----A) at nucleotide -6 of the factor IX gene. The mutation site was found in a small region of the 5'-untranslated sequence designated the Leyden-specific region (LS region). This region, approximately 40 base pairs in length, contains the unique mutation sites of all the known factor IX Leyden genes (five families) analyzed to date. This fact strongly suggests that the LS region is directly or indirectly involved in the developmental regulation of factor IX biosynthesis. Base changes at nucleotide -20 as well as at nucleotide -6 and deletions of the 3' half of the LS region reduced expression activity of the factor IX gene to approximately 15-31% that of the normal control, as assessed in a cultured cell (HepG2) expression system. The LS region binds at least two proteins. Androgen significantly increased the transcriptional activities of both mutant and normal factor IX genes in a concentration-dependent manner.\r"

These invertebrate cells respond to interleukin 1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), both in vitro and in vivo, in a manner similar to that of human granulocytes. As in the mammalian monokine network, the effect of IL-1 on the immunocytes is brought about, at least in part, by its stimulatory effect on the formation of TNF.

  ".W": "The objective of this study was to determine whether the vascular smooth muscle contractile effect of NG-methyl-L-arginine (NMA) is endothelium dependent and attributed to a decline in smooth muscle levels of cyclic GMP. Vascular smooth muscle levels of cyclic GMP are severalfold greater in endothelium-intact than in endothelium-denuded preparations because of the continuous formation and release of a lipophilic endothelium-derived chemical factor that diffuses into the underlying smooth muscle and activates cytosolic guanylate cyclase. This chemical substance, believed to be nitric oxide (NO) or a labile nitroso precursor, appears to account for the biological actions of endothelium-derived relaxing factor. NMA inhibits the formation of NO from endogenous L-arginine in endothelial cells. In the present study, NMA caused marked endothelium-dependent contraction of isolated rings of bovine pulmonary artery and vein, and this was similar to the contraction elicited by hemoglobin, an inhibitor of the relaxant action of NO. Both NMA and hemoglobin caused endothelium-dependent potentiation of contractile responses to phenylephrine in artery and vein. NMA caused endothelium-dependent decreases in the resting or basal levels of cyclic GMP in artery and vein to levels that were characteristic of those in endothelium-denuded vessels. Finally, NMA inhibited endothelium-dependent relaxant responses and cyclic GMP formation stimulated by acetylcholine and bradykinin. These observations reveal that interference with the continuous or basal generation of endothelium-derived NO in artery and vein can cause marked increases in vascular smooth muscle tone as a result of inhibition of cyclic GMP formation.\r"

We have carried out detailed studies of the selective effect of HIM1 on IL-3-mediated stimulation of hematopoietic progenitors. Preincubation of normal human bone marrow mononuclear cells, depleted of adherent cells and T cells, with HIM1 antibody resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of IL-3-mediated stimulation of both erythroid burst-forming units (maximum inhibition 55%) and granulocyte/macrophage colony-forming units (maximum inhibition 49%). HIM1 antibody had no effect on growth of erythroid colony-forming units in culture. In addition, preincubation of the cells with HIM1 antibody had no deleterious effect on granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor-induced growth of either erythroid bursts or granulocyte/macrophage colonies. To be certain that the HIM1 antibody did not react directly with IL-3 itself, we attempted to use immunodepletion to remove IL-3 that had been added to our culture medium. Although we were able to remove IL-3 bioactivity by immunodepletion with anti-IL-3 antibody bound to Sepharose beads, beads with attached HIM1 did not remove IL-3 activity from the medium. Polymorphonuclear neutrophils bind high levels of HIM1, although they have very few or no detectable IL-3 receptors. Therefore, this antibody appears to recognize a cell surface antigen that is critical for optimal IL-3 binding and bioactivity but is not the actual IL-3 receptor.\r"

In the present report we describe the distribution of phosphotyrosine-containing material detected by immunocytochemistry (ICC) in the rat forebrain. Specificity of the affinity-purified antibody against phosphotyrosine used in the ICC technique was demonstrated by the ability of phosphotyrosine and p-nitrophenyl phosphate but not phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, or L-tyrosine to inhibit the immunostaining reaction. With ICC, relatively high amounts of phosphotyrosine-positive material were observed in neurons in specific structures that included the supraoptic, paraventricular, and arcuate nuclei; the median eminence; medial habenula; subfornical organ; and piriform cortex. Moderate to high amounts were present in the cerebral cortical layers II-IV and in the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus. Small to moderate amounts were detected in a few other locations. Glial elements showed minimal staining. Other areas of the rat forebrain failed to react with this antibody. Importantly, the distribution of the areas positive for phosphotyrosine agreed to a remarkable extent with the distribution of the brain insulin receptor, which itself has tyrosine kinase activity. These findings suggest a relationship between the insulin receptor and the increased phosphotyrosine content of these neurons and support the concept that the brain insulin receptor is active in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "To study the interactions between the parasitic protozoan Giardia lamblia and its environment, we have cloned the gene that encodes the two major surface-labeled trophozoite protein species. Sequence analysis of this gene reveals a single open reading frame specifying a hydrophilic, cysteine-rich (11.8%) protein of 72.5-kDa molecular mass with an amino-terminal signal peptide and a postulated hydrophobic membrane-spanning anchor region near the carboxyl terminus. Most of the cysteine residues (58 of 84) are in the motif Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys, which is dispersed 29 times throughout the sequence. Antibodies against the recombinant protein react with the entire surface of live trophozoites, including flagella and adhesive disc. These antibodies inhibit trophozoite attachment, prevent growth, and immunoprecipitate the major approximately 66- and 85-kDa proteins from surface-labeled live trophozoites. The recombinant Escherichia coli also expresses polypeptides of approximately 66- and 85-kDa molecular mass, which are not fusion proteins. This suggests that the processing and/or conformational changes that lead to production of these two peptide species in E. coli reflect those that occur in Giardia. The abundance of cysteine residues suggests that the native proteins on the parasite surface may contain numerous disulfide bonds, which would promote resistance to intestinal fluid proteases and to the detergent activity of bile salts and would help to explain the survival of Giardia in the human small intestine.\r"

  ".W": "Neutron diffraction maps have been used to assign the rotor conformations of the hydroxyl hydrogens in trypsin. Knowledge of these conformations is used to assess the relative importance of steric and electrostatic effects in conferring the H-bonding geometries of these groups. A general finding was that most hydroxyl groups are rotationally ordered with their highest populated conformation near the low-energy staggered orientation. For the low-energy conformers (-60 degrees, 60 degrees, 180 degrees) of serine and threonine, the trans (-180 degrees) position is most highly populated followed by +60 degrees. In trypsin, only 1 of 24 serines was found in the -60 degrees conformer. Serine hydroxyls preferentially act as H-bond acceptors and rarely are observed as H-bond donors alone. Threonines were found to be more likely than serines to participate in two H bonds; tryosines were found to prefer to act as donors. In H-bonding situations in which there was incompatibility between the energies defining the barrier to rotation and the local electrostatics, the electrostatic criteria dominated. Overall, the findings support a model of H bonding where there exists strong inherent complementarity between the low-energy hydroxyl orientations and the local electrostatic environment.\r"

A candidate for mediating this binding is osteopontin, a major cell- and hydroxyapatite-binding protein synthesized by osteoblasts. In support of this hypothesis is the fact that the synthesis of osteopontin is stimulated by calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin(D3), a substance that induces bone resorption. The present study demonstrates that osteopontin is highly enriched at regions of the bone surface where osteoclasts are anchored. Furthermore, the vitronectin receptor, which has known specificity for osteopontin, is shown preferentially localized at the corresponding area of the osteoclast plasma membrane. The results thus support the hypothesis that osteoclasts when resorbing bone are anchored by osteopontin bound both to the mineral of bone matrix and to a vitronectin receptor on the osteoclast plasma membrane.\r"

  ".W": "Chicken embryo neural crest cells that migrate into a paraxial mesoderm constructed of multiple rostral half-somites from quail embryos form unsegmented \"polyganglia,\" instead of distinct dorsal root ganglia (DRG). We report here that the environment that is created by grafting rostral somitic (RS) moieties not only is permissive for neural crest cell migration and consequent DRG formation but also is mitogenic for the DRG precursor cells. On embryonic day 3.5 (E3.5), 1 day after surgery, there is a 42% average increase in volume of the polyganglia compared with the corresponding DRG on the unoperated side. The volume increase is accounted for by an increased number of DRG cells--an average of 46% more cells are found in the polyganglia. The increases in volume and cell number are still present a day later at E4.5 (38% and 52%, respectively) and are observed in both limb-forming and non-limb-forming regions of the embryonic axis. The mechanism for this increase in cell number and volume in the polyganglia is enhanced proliferative activity. On E3.5 the proportion of cells incorporating thymidine of the total DRG cell number is 45% higher in the polyganglia than the control side, when embryos are given a short pulse before sacrifice. This indicates that rostral sclerotomal environment stimulates the crest cells to proliferate. The difference in volume between the polyganglia and the normal DRG continues to grow until at least E8, when the polyganglia are twice as large as the control DRG. The continued increase in volume can also be accounted for by the mitogenic effect of the RS grafts, since on E4.5 the percentage of thymidine-labeled cells compared with the total cell number in DRG is 28% higher in the polyganglia than in control ganglia. This study demonstrates that the somitic microenvironment regulates the proliferation of neural crest cells in the nascent DRG.\r"

The biopsied embryos are kept in culture during analysis of biopsied material and later reintroduced to a foster mother. Prenatal diagnosis can be completed in less than 7 hr. The identity of either amplification product was proved conclusively by direct sequence analysis of amplified products. Ninety-six percent of recovered blastocysts survived biopsy, as judged by re-formation of a blastocyst cavity in culture. Fifty-nine percent of the biopsied embryos established pregnancy by day 6.5, compared to 88% of unmanipulated controls. This approach can be applied to preimplantation diagnosis of human genetic diseases by using extraembryonic cells from blastocysts obtained after in vitro fertilization or uterine lavage. It will make possible the elimination of a mutant allele from a family in a single generation.\r"

  ".W": "Normal bovine and mouse sera contain a component, termed beta inhibitor, that inhibits the infectivity and hemagglutinating activity of influenza A viruses of the H1 and H3 subtypes. To investigate the nature of the interaction of beta inhibitors with influenza A viruses we isolated a mutant of the virus Mem71H-BelN (H3N1) that could grow in the presence of bovine serum. The mutant virus was resistant to hemagglutination inhibition by mouse serum as well as by bovine serum and had undergone changes in the receptor-binding and the antigenic properties of its hemagglutinin (HA) molecule. Sequence analysis of the HA genes of parent and mutant viruses revealed a single nucleotide change in the mutant, resulting in the substitution Thr----Asn at residue 167 of the HA1 chain of HA. This change leads to loss of the potential glycosylation site Asn-165-Val-166-Thr-167 at the tip of the HA spike, which in viruses of the H3 subtype is known to bear a high-mannose (type II) carbohydrate side chain N-linked to Asn-165. The association of beta inhibitor resistance with loss of this carbohydrate side chain suggested that beta inhibitors may be lectins. In support of this hypothesis, treatment of the beta inhibitor-sensitive parent virus Mem71H-BelN with periodate converted it to the resistant state. Furthermore, the inhibitory activity of both bovine and mouse sera for the parental virus was abrogated by D-mannose. We conclude that the beta inhibitors in bovine and mouse sera are mannose-binding lectins that inhibit hemagglutination and neutralize virus infectivity by binding to carbohydrate at the tip of the HA spike, blocking access of cell-surface receptors to the receptor-binding site on HA.\r"

  ".W": "A one-trial in vivo conditioning procedure produces short- and long-term cellular changes that can be detected in identified sensory neurons of the pathway mediating the conditioned stimulus. The memory of the associative experience in the conditioned stimulus pathway is expressed by short- and long-term enhancement of light-evoked generator potentials recorded from identified lateral and medial type B photoreceptors within the eyes of Hermissenda. To identify mechanisms of the induction and expression of short- and long-term enhancement in identified photoreceptors, we have investigated the effects of inhibiting protein synthesis during the application of the one-trial in vivo conditioning procedure. Anisomycin (1 microM) present during and after the conditioning trial blocked long-term enhancement without affecting the induction or expression of short-term enhancement. Application of a control compound, deacetylanisomycin (1 microM), or delaying the application of anisomycin until 1 hr after the conditioning trial did not block either long- or short-term enhancement. These results indicate that synthesis of proteins during or shortly after training may be a critical step in the formation of long-term memory of the associative experience.\r"

  ".W": "Pyramidal neurons in the rat hippocampus contain mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) and glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) to which the adrenal steroid corticosterone binds with differential affinity. We have used intracellular recording techniques to examine MR-mediated effects on membrane properties of CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices from adrenalectomized rats. Low doses of corticosterone (1 nM) applied by perfusion for 20 min decreased the spike accommodation observed during a depolarizing current pulse (0.5 nA for 500 ms) and the amplitude of the subsequent afterhyperpolarization without affecting other membrane properties tested. The decrease became apparent ca. 15 min after steroid perfusion was started and reached its peak value 10-20 min after the steroid perfusion was terminated. The steroid effect was blocked by the MR antagonist spironolactone and mimicked by the natural MR ligand aldosterone (1 nM). Neurons recorded 30-90 min after termination of aldosterone application still displayed a decreased spike accommodation. However, 30-90 min after corticosterone application, the decrease in spike accommodation/afterhyperpolarization appeared to be reversed. Higher doses of corticosterone (greater than or equal to 30 nM) induced a significant increase in accommodation and amplitude of the afterhyperpolarization, as was previously observed for selective GR ligands. The data indicate that MR and GR activations induce opposite actions on the spike accommodation/afterhyperpolarization of CA1 pyramidal neurons, an important intrinsic mechanism of these neurons to regulate their response to excitatory input. We suggest that occupation of both MR and GR by the endogenous ligand corticosterone will result in an initial MR-mediated enhanced cellular excitability, which is gradually reversed and overridden by a GR-mediated suppression of cellular activity.\r"

In this report we have investigated the genetic relationships between these polypeptides. Using pulsed field gel electrophoresis analysis we demonstrate that the genes coding for the alpha (C4BP alpha) and beta (C4BP beta) chains are closely linked within the regulator of complement activation gene cluster. In addition, we have determined that the 3' end of the C4BP beta gene lies 3.5-5 kilobases from the 5' end of the C4BP alpha gene. These findings support the concept that the C4BP alpha and C4BP beta genes are the result of a gene duplication event.\r"

  ".W": "Oxidative damage to DNA is shown to be extensive and could be a major cause of the physiological changes associated with aging and the degenerative diseases related to aging such as cancer. The oxidized nucleoside, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (oh8dG), one of the approximately 20 known oxidative DNA damage products, has been measured in DNA isolated from various organs of Fischer 344 rats of different ages. oh8dG was present in the DNA isolated from all the organs studied: liver, brain, kidney, intestine, and testes. Steady-state levels of oh8dG ranged from 8 to 73 residues per 10(6) deoxyguanosine residues or 0.2-2.0 x 10(5) residues per cell. Levels of oh8dG in DNA increased with age in liver, kidney, and intestine but remained unchanged in brain and testes. The urinary excretion of oh8dG, which presumably reflects its repair from DNA by nuclease activity, decreased with age from 481 to 165 pmol per kg of body weight per day for urine obtained from 2-month- and 25-month-old rats, respectively. 8-Hydroxyguanine, the proposed repair product of a glycosylase activity, was also assayed in the urine. We estimate approximately 9 x 10(4) oxidative hits to DNA per cell per day in the rat. The results suggest that the age-dependent accumulation of oh8dG residues observed in DNA from liver, kidney, and intestine is principally due to the slow loss of DNA nuclease activity; however, an increase in the rate of oxidative DNA damage cannot be ruled out.\r"

  ".W": "Injection of rat brain mRNA into Xenopus oocytes has been shown to induce a calcium current (ICa) that is insensitive to dihydropyridine and omega-conotoxin. We examined the effect of funnel-web spider venom on two aspects of this expressed ICa: (i) the calcium-activated chloride current [ICl(Ca)] and (ii) the currents carried by barium ions through calcium channels (IBa). In the presence of 1.8 mM extracellular calcium, ICl(Ca) tail current became detectable between -30 and -40 mV from a holding potential of -80 mV and reached a maximal amplitude between 0 and +10 mV. Total spider venom partially (83%) and reversibly blocked the calcium-activated chloride current without changing its voltage sensitivity. A chromatographic toxin fraction from the venom also blocked this current (64%). The venom had a minimal effect on INa and IK. Direct investigation of inward current mediated by calcium channels was carried out in high-barium solution. IBa had a higher threshold of activation (-30 to -20 mV) and reached its maximal amplitude at about +20 mV. Total venom or a partly purified chromatographic toxic fraction blocked IBa partially and reversibly without changing its current-voltage characteristics. Furthermore, the extent of the total venom block depended on the concentration of extracellular barium. Only 35% of the IBa was blocked in 60 mM Ba2+, whereas the block increased to 65% and 71%, respectively, for 40 and 20 mM Ba2+. On the basis of these results, we propose that the calcium channels expressed from rat brain mRNA in Xenopus oocytes is similar to the recently discovered P-type channels.\r"

  ".W": "In different regions of the developing mammalian brain, neurons follow the processes of radial glial cells over very different trajectories to reach their destinations in specific neuronal layers. To investigate whether the movement of neurons along glial fibers is specified by glia in a given region or whether glia provide a permissive substrate for migration in different brain regions, we purified neurons and astroglial cells from developing cerebellum and hippocampus and analyzed neuronal migration on heterotypic glial fibers with time-lapse, video-enhanced differential interference microscopy in vitro. Granule neurons purified from early postnatal rat cerebellum migrated on astroglial processes of glia purified from late embryonic or early postnatal rat hippocampus with a cytology, neuron-glial relationship, and dynamics of movement that were indistinguishable from those of mouse granule cells migrating on cerebellar astroglial processes in vitro [Edmondson, J. C. & Hatten, M. E. (1987) J. Neurosci. 7, 1928-1934]. In the reciprocal combination, hippocampal neurons migrated on cerebellar glial processes in a manner that was also remarkably similar to migration along homotypic, hippocampal glial fibers [Gasser, U. E. & Hatten, M. E. (1990) J. Neurosci. 10, 1276-1285]. In all cases, migrating neurons had a characteristic appearance, apposing their cell soma against the glial fiber and extending in the direction of migration a motile, leading process that enfolded the glial fiber with short filopodia and lamellipodia. As seen by video microscopy, neurons moved along homotypic and heterotypic glial processes by translocation of the soma and were not \"pulled\" forward by the leading process. As the neuron moved, the nucleus remained in the posterior portion of the cell and cytoplasmic vesicles moved forward from the soma into the leading process. The dynamics of the movement of neurons along heterotypic glial substrates, including the speed and periodicity of motion, was identical to that of neurons migrating along homotypic glial substrates. These experiments suggest that the mechanism of movement of neurons along glial fibers is conserved in these two brain regions during development.\r"

Oocytes expressed a conductance that displayed whole-cell current properties with the following characteristics: marked selectivity for K over Na and Cl, voltage-independent kinetics, Ca insensitivity, tonic activation, and inward rectification in symmetrical K. Barium, quinine, and tetraethylammonium blocked the conductance, whereas apamin, charybdotoxin, and 4-aminopyridine did not. The K conductance was rapidly (t1/2 = 10 min) and completely inactivated by 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate but not by 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate. Sucrose density gradient fractionation revealed that mRNA required for expression is in the 1- to 2-kilobase size range, suggesting the possibility that a single subunit encodes the channel. The K conductance expressed from injection of size-fractionated mRNA was identical in all respects to that seen using unfractionated mRNA, including response to 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. The results suggest that protein kinase C regulates K secretion in epithelia by modulation of apical K channels.\r"

With this method, three genetic loci present in a single sperm can be amplified simultaneously. The amplification procedure is specific as well as efficient and permits detection of the PCR product by ethidium bromide staining after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. When allele-specific PCR primers that differ in length are used, the size of the PCR products of different alleles also vary in length, allowing the allelic state at each locus to be determined electrophoretically. Studies on individual sperm by using this procedure should facilitate the measurement of genetic recombination in humans over small physical distances. The ability to directly analyze the allelic state of PCR products from one cell rapidly and simply will also be useful for the prenatal diagnosis of genetic disease, especially in the analysis of single blastomeres taken from in vitro fertilized eggs prior to implantation.\r"

Specific cell types were identified by immunochemical reagents for smooth muscle, monocyte-macrophages, and other blood cells. Low rates of smooth muscle cell proliferation were observed. Macrophages were also observed with rates of proliferation comparable to that of the smooth muscle. Additional replicating cells could not be defined as belonging to specific cell types with the reagents used in this study.

  ".W": "Primary cultures of fetal rat calvarial osteoblasts undergo a developmental sequence with respect to the temporal expression of genes encoding osteoblast phenotypic markers. Based on previous suggestions that gene-nuclear matrix associations are involved in regulating cell- and tissue-specific gene expression, we investigated the protein composition of the nuclear matrix during this developmental sequence by using high-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The nuclear matrix was isolated at times during a 4-week culture period that represent the three principal osteoblast phenotypic stages: proliferation, extracellular matrix (ECM) maturation, and mineralization. The most dramatic changes in the nuclear matrix protein patterns occurred during transitions from the proliferation to the ECM maturation stage and from ECM maturation to the mineralization period, with only minor variations in the profiles within each period. These stage-specific changes, corresponding to the major transition points in gene expression, indicate that the nuclear matrix proteins reflect the progressive differentiation of the bone cell phenotype. Subcultivation of primary cells delays mineralization, and a corresponding delay was observed for the nuclear matrix protein patterns. Thus, the sequential changes in protein composition of the nuclear matrix that occur during osteoblast differentiation represent distinct stage-specific markers for maturation of the osteoblast to an osteocytic cell in a bone-like mineralized ECM. These changes are consistent with a functional involvement of the nuclear matrix in mediating modifications of developmental gene expression.\r"

  ".W": "gamma II-crystallin from calf eye lens consists of two homologous domains, each composed of two similar \"Greek key\" motifs. As a consequence of the bilobal structure, a biphasic transition is seen upon unfolding by urea at low pH (monitored by circular dichroism, fluorescence emission, and ultracentrifugal analysis). In 3.3 +/- 0.5 M urea, a stable intermediate is formed at equilibrium, whereas 5.5 M urea causes maximum denaturation. Unfolding/folding kinetics display a complex pattern characterized by two kinetic phases. Both reactions exhibit strong dependence on the urea concentration; in the range of the respective transition, their rates are extremely slow (k approximately 1 x 10(-4)s-1). The kinetic mechanism of unfolding and refolding may be described by a three-state model: native in equilibrium intermediate in equilibrium denatured. The rate-determining steps are domain folding rather than domain pairing or proline isomerization. Kinetic analysis of the unfolding/folding of the intermediate populated in 3.0 M urea, pH 2.0, reveals that the kinetic and the equilibrium intermediates have similar structures. Limited proteolysis of gamma II-crystallin by pepsin in 3 M urea, pH 2, allows the NH2-terminal domain of the protein to be isolated. Unfolding/refolding of the fragment parallels the second transition in the above scheme, thus proving that the intermediate contains the COOH-terminal domain in its random state, whereas the NH2-terminal domain is still in its native conformation. In conclusion, folding of gamma II-crystallin proceeds through the independent sequential structuring of the domains.\r"

In addition, model free energy calculations have been carried out in which the electrostatic charges of the H-bonding groups of the bases in the major and minor grooves of the DNA are reduced to zero as a way of assessing the relative solvation effects of these groups in the different structural forms of DNA. Finally, energy component analyses have been carried out to assess the relative roles of different intranucleotide interactions on the B----Z equilibrium as a function of base sequence. In vacuo, the free energy for changing a G.C to an A.T base pair is largest in the Z conformation; in the A and B conformations, the free energy cost is approximately 2 kcal/mol lower (1 cal = 4.184 J). The results are similar when the simulations are run in explicit solvent: the change costs 3 kcal/mol more in the Z conformation than in the B form. These results are consistent with experimental data, where it is clear that A.T sequences are significantly more \"Z-phobic\" than G.C sequences. The calculations indicate that both intranucleotide and solvation interactions contribute to this Z-phobicity.\r"

An excellent example is Saxifragaceae sensu lato, which represents one of the major phylogenetic problems in angiosperms at higher taxonomic levels. As originally defined, the family is a heterogeneous assemblage of herbaceous and woody taxa comprising 15 subfamilies. Although more recent classifications fundamentally modified this scheme, little agreement exists regarding the circumscription, taxonomic rank, or relationships of these subfamilies. The recurrent discrepancies in taxonomic treatments of the Saxifragaceae prompted an investigation of the power of chloroplast gene sequences to resolve phylogenetic relationships within this family and between the Saxifragaceae and other major plant lineages. Sequence data from the gene rbcL (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase, large subunit) reveal that (i) Saxifragaceae sensu lato is at least paraphyletic, and probably polyphyletic, (ii) the genera Parnassia and Brexia are only distantly related to other members of Saxifragaceae, and (iii) representatives of the Solanaceae (subclass Asteridae) appear more closely related to Saxifragaceae (subclass Rosidase) than traditionally maintained. These data illustrate the value of chloroplast gene sequence data in resolving genetic, and hence phylogenetic, relationships among members of the most taxonomically complex groups.\r"

  ".W": "Growth hormone (GH) has pronounced effects on protein synthesis and cell growth in cardiac muscle from adult animals, although the mechanism of its action is not understood. Because Ca2+ has been implicated as a regulator of mitogenic processes in a number of tissues, we investigated whether GH affects the transmembrane movement of Ca2+ through voltage-activated channels of cardiac myocytes. Atrial and ventricular myocytes were isolated from adult rats with GH-secreting tumors and studied electrophysiologically by using patch-clamp techniques. Tumor-bearing rats re-enter an active growth phase and double their body weight over age-matched controls 8 weeks after introduction of the tumor. Atrial myocytes from tumor-bearing animals showed a 3-fold increase in the density of T-type Ca2+ current compared with cells from control animals, although the voltage dependency of activation and inactivation of T-type current was not altered. The increase in T-current density of atrial myocytes preceded by at least a week any measurable change in heart weight, body weight, or myocyte size. L-type Ca2+ currents in atrial and ventricular cells were not affected. The results suggest that a tumor-derived growth factor, most likely GH, can cause a specific enhancement of T-type Ca2+ current in atrial myocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Labeling studies of Torpedo marmorata nicotinic acetylcholine receptor with the noncompetitive channel blocker [3H]chlorpromazine have led to the initial identification of amino acids plausibly participating to the walls of the ion channel on the alpha, beta, and delta subunits. We report here results obtained with the gamma subunit, which bring additional information on the structure of the channel. After photolabeling of the membrane-bound receptor under equilibrium conditions in the presence of agonist and with or without phencyclidine (a specific ligand for the high-affinity site for noncompetitive blockers), the purified labeled gamma subunit was digested with trypsin, and the resulting fragments were fractionated by HPLC. Sequence analysis of peptide mixtures containing various amounts of highly hydrophobic fragments showed that three amino acids are labeled by [3H]chlorpromazine in a phencyclidine-sensitive manner: Thr-253, Ser-257, and Leu-260. These residues all belong to the hydrophobic and putative transmembrane region MII of the gamma subunit. Their distribution along the sequence is consistent with an alpha-helical organization of this segment. The [3H]chlorpromazine-labeled amino acids are conserved at homologous positions in the known sequences of other ligand-gated ion channels and may, thus, play a critical role in ion-transport mechanisms.\r"

  ".U": "90280439\r", 
  ".W": "We have introduced two specific point mutations, located 20 base pairs apart, into the endogenous murine gene that encodes the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPII215). The first mutation conferred resistance to the mushroom toxin alpha-amanitin (amar), and the second mutation generated a restriction fragment length polymorphism without altering the protein sequence. Targeted amar clones were generated at a frequency of 1 in 30 totipotent embryonic stem cells that expressed stably integrated DNA vectors after electroporation. Thirty to 40% of these clones had acquired both mutations, whereas, surprisingly, the remaining clones had acquired the specific amar point mutation but lacked the restriction fragment length polymorphism. We suggest that the latter clones were generated by independent DNA mismatch repair rather than by double crossover or gene conversion. These results demonstrate that it is possible to introduce specific point mutations into an endogenous gene in embryonic stem cells. Thus it should be possible to introduce single base substitutions into other cellular genes, including nonselectable genes, by optimizing the efficiency of gene transfer and/or the sensitivity of screening for targeted clones.\r"

  ".W": "Recent hyracoids and elephants share a taxeopode arrangement of tarsal and carpal bones, a condition in which bones are aligned with minimal interlocking between adjacent elements. Taxeopody has often been interpreted as a synapomorphy reflecting a close phyletic link between Hyracoidea and Proboscidea, but recently it has been suggested [Fischer, M. S. (1986) Cour. Forschungsinst. Senckenberg 84, 1-132] that hyracoid taxeopody is an independent acquisition resulting from selection favoring increased midcarpal and midtarsal rotation and that Hyracoidea is actually allied with Perissodactyla. As a test of this hypothesis, isolated carpal and tarsal bones of primitive Oligocene hyracoids from the Fayum, Egypt, have been examined to determine whether these indicate a taxeopode or diplarthral carpus and tarsus. Four complete astragali from the Fayum, representing at least three taxa, show a single, slightly convex articular surface on the head for articulation with the navicular and lack a facet for the cuboid. Two complete magna representing two species have a single proximal facet for articulation with the lunar, and they lack a facet for the scaphoid. Thus, both the carpus and tarsus of Fayum hyracoids are taxeopode. Taxeopody in hyracoids cannot be attributed to selection for carpal and tarsal rotation in climbers because the Oligocene, Miocene, and Recent species show great diversity in body size and probably locomotor specializations, despite relative uniformity of structure in the carpus and tarsus. The shared taxeopody of hyracoids and proboscideans, along with other osteological characters and similarities in hemoglobin, eye lens proteins, and other molecules, all suggest that Hyracoidea belongs within Paenungulata.\r"

  ".W": "The CpG dinucleotide is present at approximately 20% of its expected frequency in vertebrate genomes, a deficiency thought due to a high mutation rate from the methylated form of CpG to TpG and CpA. We examine the hypothesis that the 20% frequency represents an equilibrium between rate of creation of new CpGs and accelerated rate of CpG loss from methylation. Using this model, we calculate the expected reduction in the equilibrium frequency of the CpG dinucleotide and find that the observed CpG deficiency can be explained by mutation from methylated CpG to TpG/CpA at approximately 12 times the normal transition rate, the exact rate depending on the ratio of transitions to transversions. The observed rate of CpG dinucleotide loss in a human alpha-globin nonprocessed pseudogene, psi alpha 1, and the apparent replenishment of the CpG pool in this sequence by new mutations, agree with the above parameters. These calculations indicate that it would take 25 million years or less, a small fraction of the time for vertebrate evolution, for CpG frequency to be reduced from undepleted levels to the current depleted levels.\r"

  ".U": "90280442\r", 
  ".W": "Transforming growth factor alpha (TGF alpha)-Pseudomonas exotoxin 40 (PE40) is a chimeric protein consisting of an N-terminal TGF alpha domain fused to a C-terminal 40-kDa segment of the Pseudomonas exotoxin A protein. TGF alpha-PE40 exhibits the receptor-binding activity of TGF alpha and the cell-killing activity of PE40. These properties make TGF alpha-PE40 an effective cytotoxic agent for cells that possess epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR). However, the utility of this protein as an anticancer agent has been unclear because many normal tissues express EGFR and may be damaged by exposure to TGF alpha-PE40. To address this issue, we injected nude mice with a lethal inoculum of either A431 or HT29 human tumor cells that possess EGFR or with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) tumor cells that lack EGFR. Animals were treated with a derivative of TGF alpha-PE40 in which the cysteine residues are replaced by alanine, termed \"TGF alpha-PE40 delta cys,\" or with saline once a day for 5 days. Mice bearing EGFR+ tumor cells lived significantly (P less than 0.001) longer when treated with TGF alpha-PE40 delta cys compared with saline-treated controls (median survival: A431 cells, 51.5 vs. 25.5 days; HT29 cells, 101 vs. 47.5 days). TGF alpha-PE40 delta cys did not prolong the survival of mice bearing tumor cells that lack EGFR (median survival: CHO cells, 15.5 vs. 19.5 days). The only toxicity to normal tissues was mild periportal hepatic necrosis. These studies indicate that a therapeutic window exists in vivo for the use of some growth factor-toxin fusion proteins as anticancer agents.\r"

We have measured the repair of pyrimidine dimers in defined DNA sequences in three normal and two CS cell strains. When compared to a nontranscribed locus, transcriptionally active genes were preferentially repaired in all three normal cell strains. There was no significant variation in levels of repair between various normal individuals or between two constitutively expressed genes, indicating that preferential repair may be a consistent feature of constitutively expressed genes in human cells. Neither CS strain, from independent complementation groups, was able to repair transcriptionally active DNA with a similar rate and to the same extent as normal cells, indicating that the genetic defect in CS lies in the pathway for repair of transcriptionally active DNA. These results have implications for understanding the pleiotropic clinical effects associated with disorders having defects in the repair of DNA damage. In particular, neurodegeneration appears to be associated with the loss of preferential repair of active genes and is not simply correlated with reduced levels of overall repair.\r"

Immunological analysis indicated that oocytes injected with the mdr1b RNA synthesized a protein with the size and immunological characteristics of the mouse mdr1b P glycoprotein. These oocytes exhibited a decreased accumulation of [3H]vinblastine and showed an increased capacity to extrude the drug compared to control oocytes not expressing the P glycoprotein.

It is presently not clear whether a decrease in extracellular fluid pH alone is sufficient to elicit this adaptation. The present studies examined the effect of acid preincubation on Na/H antiporter activity in cultured proximal tubule cells. Antiporter activity was examined after a 2-day preincubation in control or acid medium, 1 hr after removal from the preincubation fluid. Na/H antiporter activity was assayed as the initial rate of Na-dependent alkalinization after cell acidification in the absence of CO2/HCO3. Preincubation in low [HCO3] acid medium or in high PCO2 acid medium led to increases in amiloride-sensitive Na/H antiporter activity. This adaptation was inhibited by addition of cycloheximide to the preincubation medium. Preincubation of fibroblasts in low [HCO3] acid medium did not lead to increased Na/H antiporter activity but rather caused a small inhibition. These studies demonstrate an adaptation in Na/H antiporter activity elicited by a low pH of the extracellular fluid, which is dependent on protein synthesis, and may be unique to certain H/HCO3-transporting epithelia.\r"

  ".W": "We examined expression of the Dictyostelium cAMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) gene under conditions that alter intracellular cAMP levels during in vitro differentiation of wild-type strain V12M2 and a sporogenous derivative, HB200. In control cultures, cellular PDE activity peaked at 6 hr and declined by 8 hr, while secreted PDE activity continued to increase through 8 hr. Lowering intracellular cAMP levels with caffeine or progesterone increased cellular and secreted PDE activities 2-fold, increased stalk cell differentiation, and inhibited spore differentiation. In contrast, exposure to 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br-cAMP; a membrane-permeable cAMP analog) or ammonia (which promotes intracellular cAMP accumulation in V12M2 and HB200 cells) lowered PDE activities by as much as 45%, decreased stalk cell differentiation, and increased spore differentiation. Simultaneous exposure to 8-Br-cAMP and caffeine gave intermediate PDE activities as would be expected if 8-Br-cAMP entered the cell and bypassed the caffeine-mediated block to adenylate cyclase activation. In all cases, we observed commensurate changes in developmental PDE transcript levels. The developmental time course of expression was not significantly altered by these treatments. These results suggest that the magnitude of PDE gene expression is negatively regulated by intracellular cAMP levels and provide evidence for one of the earliest changes in gene expression that is consistent with cell-type specificity. These results are discussed in terms of a bistable switch employing intracellular cAMP as a regulator of cell fate.\r"

  ".W": "We have established a model that shows cooperative interaction among preimplantation embryos and the role of growth factors on their development and growth. Two-cell mouse embryos cultured singly in 25-microliters microdrops had inferior development to blastocysts and lower cell numbers per blastocyst compared with those cultured in groups of 5 or 10. The inferior development of singly cultured embryos was markedly improved by addition of epidermal growth factor (EGF) or transforming growth factor alpha or beta 1 (TGF-alpha or TGF-beta 1) to the culture medium. The stage of embryonic development, primarily affected by these treatments, was between eight-cell/morula and blastocyst. Furthermore, blastocysts developed from eight-cell embryos cultured in groups or singly in the presence of EGF showed a higher incidence of zona hatching compared with those cultured singly in the absence of EGF. Detection of EGF receptors on the embryonic cell surface at eight-cell/morula and blastocyst stages suggests beneficial effects of EGF or TGF-alpha on preimplantation embryo development and blastocyst functions. Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) had no influence on embryo development. To further document the cooperative interactions among embryos, the volume of the culture medium was doubled to 50 microliters. This increase in culture volume was even more detrimental to the development of singly cultured embryos. However, this detrimental effect was significantly reversed by EGF and reversed even more markedly by a combination of EGF and TGF-beta 1 but not by TGF-beta 1 alone. Although TGF-beta 1 plus IGF-I caused a modest improvement of embryo development, the response was not as great as shown by EGF alone. Furthermore, IGF-I had no additive effect on EGF-induced embryonic development. The study presents clear evidence that specific growth factors of embryonic and/or reproductive tract origin participate in preimplantation embryo development and blastocyst functions in an autocrine/paracrine manner.\r"

The all-D peptides were resistant to enzymatic degradation. The peptides produced single-channel conductances in planar lipid bilayers, and the D and L enantiomers caused equivalent amounts of electrical conductivity. All of the peptides were potent antibacterial agents against representative Gram-negative and Gram-positive species. The D and L enantiomers of each peptide pair were equally active, within experimental error. Sheep erythrocytes were lysed by both D- and L-melittin but not by either isomer of cecropin A, magainin 2 amide, or the hybrids cecropin A-(1-13)-melittin-(1-13)-NH2 or cecropin A-(1-8)-melittin-(1-18)-NH2. The infectivity of the bloodstream form of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum was also inhibited by the D and L hybrids. It is suggested that the mode of action of these peptides on the membranes of bacteria, erythrocytes, plasmodia, and artificial lipid bilayers may be similar and involves the formation of ion-channel pores spanning the membranes, but without specific interaction with chiral receptors or enzymes.\r"

This domain is directly involved in the regulation of molluscan muscle contraction, which is triggered by direct Ca2+ binding to myosin. We have isolated a soluble functional complex (regulatory complex) comprised of R-LC, E-LC, and a 10-kDa heavy chain fragment in a 1:1:1 stoichiometry by clostripain digestion of the myosin head (papain subfragment 1). N termini of the heavy chain fragments were either leucine-812 or valine-817. The isolated complex retained the specific Ca2(+)-binding site and bound Ca2+ with a similar affinity and selectivity as myosin. The individual components of the regulatory complex were isolated after complete denaturation with guanidine hydrochloride. The regulatory complex was reconstituted from isolated light chains and the heavy chain fragment. The renatured complex regained Ca2+ binding quantitatively. To elucidate the function of the E-LC in Ca2+ binding, we constructed hybrid regulatory complexes. The hybrid complexes reconstituted with molluscan E-LC and R-LC regained the specific Ca2(+)-binding site, whereas the hybrid complex formed with rabbit skeletal E-LC [alkali LC 2 (A2-LC)] and scallop R-LC did not. The results demonstrate that E-LCs from myosins regulated by direct Ca2+ binding are required for the specific Ca2+ binding in the molluscan muscle.\r"

To exclude potential alterations in the turnover of B-lineage cells due to the bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, we performed pulse-chase experiments comparing the appearance and disappearance of bromodeoxyuridine-labeled cells over long periods of time. The data consistently show that more than two-thirds of splenic B cells in adult (greater than 2 months old) mice have a lifetime of several weeks or months, whereas a more rapid turnover takes place in young (4 week old) mice. Thus, the peripheral B-cell pool is only slowly renewed after it has been initially built up early in life.\r"

Two voltage-dependent processes that could account for the whole-cell current rectification were examined, receptor channel gating and single receptor channel permeation. We found that both factors are involved in the rectification of the whole-cell currents. The voltage dependence of channel gating determines the shape of the I-V curve at negative potentials. The single-channel I-V relationship is inwardly rectifying and largely responsible for the characteristic shape of the whole-cell I-V curve at positive potentials. The rectification of the single-channel currents is produced by the voltage-dependent block of outward currents by intracellular Mg2+ ions.\r"

  ".W": "Expression of the retinoic acid receptors alpha and beta (RAR-alpha and RAR-beta) was examined in F9 cells, an embryonal carcinoma cell model established for the study of retinoid metabolism and function. Addition of retinoic acid to F9 cell medium caused a dose-dependent increase in RAR-beta mRNA within 3 hr that reached 5- to 30-fold greater than the constitutively expressed mRNA by 24 hr. The elevation in mRNA resulted from increased transcription, as demonstrated by nuclear run-on transcription, did not require protein synthesis, and required the constant presence of retinoic acid. N6,O2'-Dibutyryl-cAMP attenuated the retinoic acid-induced increase in RAR-beta mRNA by a post-transcriptional mechanism. In contrast, RAR-alpha mRNA in F9 stem cells was affected less (1.2- to 1.4-fold increase) by retinoic acid and decreased 3-fold transiently when fresh serum was added to the medium. Differentiation of F9 cells resulted in increased steady-state levels of RAR-beta mRNA in primitive (4-fold), parietal (3-fold), and visceral (8-fold) endoderm but decreased steady-state levels of RAR-alpha mRNA in primitive (2-fold), parietal (3-fold), and visceral (1.4-fold) endoderm. These data demonstrate that RAR-beta is a primary target gene for retinoic acid in a characterized model of retinoid function, indicate that constitutive expression of both RAR-beta and RAR-alpha is dependent upon the differentiation state, and suggest hormonal modulation of RAR-beta by cAMP and modulation of RAR-alpha by serum factors. These results distinguish the effects of serum, cAMP, and retinoic acid on the expression of RAR from the effects mediated by differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "The basis for the 200-fold difference in affinity between two hybridoma antibodies specific for the hapten p-azophenylarsonate (Ars) that have diversified by somatic hypermutation was examined. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to sequentially convert the nucleotide sequence of the lower-affinity antibody into that of the higher-affinity one, and the mutant antibodies generated by transfection of hybridoma cells were analyzed for affinity to Ars-tyrosine. The data showed that out of the 19 amino acid differences between the two hybridoma antibodies, the affinity increase could be reproduced by three heavy-chain substitutions that are present in the high-affinity antibody. The combined effect on affinity of amino acid substitutions was generally found to reflect their individual effects. Although the light chain of the high-affinity antibody did not seem to play a major role in the affinity increase, its contribution varied with the kind and number of heavy-chain substitutions. The results hold promise for antibody engineering and are consistent with a stepwise acquisition of somatic hypermutations in which the existing structural context of an antibody most likely influences the affinity-based selection of later substitutions. They further suggest that many substitutions may be tolerated in vivo during the antigen-driven selection process, even though they confer on the antibody no affinity increase.\r"

Analysis of allele distributions between TCR beta genes revealed significant linkage disequilibrium between only 6 of the 28 different pairs of RFLPs. This linkage disequillibrium strongly influences the most efficient order to proceed for typing of these RFLPs in order to achieve maximum genetic informativeness, which in this study revealed a 97.3% level of heterozygosity within the TCR beta gene complex. Our results should provide new insight into recent reports of disease associations with the TCR beta gene complex and should assist in designing future experiments to detect or confirm the existence of disease-susceptibility loci in this region of the human genome.\r"

The most remarkable and unpredictable structural change that significantly increased potency was deletion of a methylene group by changing Gln6 to Asn6. On the basis that D-Arg1 and Lys3 of spantide contribute to neurological side effects, many new designs led to D-Lys(Nic)1-Pro2-Pal(3)3-Pro4-D-Phe(Cl2)5-Asn6-D-Trp7-Phe8-D-Trp9- Leu10-Nle11- NH2 [spantide II, where D-Lys(Nic) is N epsilon-nicotinoyllysine, Pal(3) is 3-(3-pyridyl)alanine, D-Phe(Cl2) is 3,4-dichloro-D-phenylalanine, and Nle is norleucine], which is a potent antagonist without neurotoxicity. Spantide II, an undecapeptide, has a total of seven substitutions in the sequence of substance P, consisting of two natural L amino acids, and one unnatural L amino acid, and four unnatural D amino acids. The pi- and sigma-bond amino acid substituents of substance P and spantide II are compared toward a future understanding of the essential substituents for mechanism and inhibition binding. Spantide II has five pi-bond and six sigma-bond amino acid moieties, and substance P has two pi-bond and nine sigma-bond moieties.\r"

  ".U": "90280472\r", 
  ".W": "The Alz-50 immunoreactive proteins, designated A68, are detected by electrophoretic blot analysis of 100,000 x g pellet fractions of brain tissue from individuals with Alzheimer disease (AD). In exploring the biochemical nature of these proteins, we have found that a preincubation of such fractions with 5 mM ATP results in loss of Alz-50 immunoreactivity on immunoblots. The loss of antigenicity is complete after a 1-hr incubation at 37 degrees C and is stringently dependent on ATP. Hydrolysis of ATP is required, since the inhibition is not supported by the nonhydrolyzable analog adenosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (ATP[gamma S]) and is prevented when the ATPase inhibitors o-vanadate and oligomycin are present. Upon further characterization, it was found that certain protease inhibitors, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, antipain, tosylphenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, and aprotonin prevent the loss of the epitope. This suggests that hydrolysis of ATP is coupled with proteolysis of A68, leading to loss of Alz-50 immunoreactivity. Since a variety of proteins are believed to be degraded by an ATP/ubiquitin-dependent pathway, a possible role for ubiquitin (Ub) in this effect was investigated. Two polyclonal antibodies against Ub protected A68 from proteolysis and were also effective in immunoprecipitating A68 after incubation with ATP in the presence of Ub and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The proteolysis of A68 was also blocked by hemin, an inhibitor of the protease that cleaves Ub-protein conjugates. Taken together, these findings indicate that loss of Alz-50 immunoreactivity with A68 is due to ATP-dependent/Ub-mediated proteolysis. This mechanism may be relevant to the physiological role for A68 in AD or it may simply represent an attempt to abort an aberrant protein.\r"

The amino-terminal region of the prohormone gives rise to the bag cell peptides (alpha, beta, and gamma). These serve an autocrine function; they are autoexcitatory on the bag cells and also act locally to alter the firing patterns of neurons in the abdominal ganglion. The carboxyl-terminal portion of the prohormone gives rise to the egg-laying hormone. This peptide acts as a hormone on nearby neurons and by means of the circulation on peripheral tissues to bring about egg-laying. We have previously reported that the first cleavage of the prohormone, which occurs in the trans-Golgi network, results in two intermediates that are sorted into distinct vesicle classes prior to further processing. Here we show that these distinct vesicles are localized to separate processes, thus spatially segregating autocrine and hormonal release sites. The findings of segregation indicate that neurons need not always release the same set of chemical messengers from all of their endings.\r"

In this system the proteins oligomerize, as judged by their coprecipitation with either of the subunit-specific antisera. Oligomerization does not occur between subunits synthesized without microsomes or between subunits synthesized on separate microsomes mixed during detergent solubilization. Thus, oligomerization occurs within the microsomal membrane. We calculate that oligomerization proceeds with an efficiency of approximately 85%. The receptor complex appears to represent a specific oligomer because it excludes a third membrane glycoprotein synthesized in the same reaction. Oligomerization of the asialoglycoprotein receptor in vitro should provide a useful system to study the assembly of a membrane-protein complex.\r"

Cotransfection experiments of cDNAs encoding the alpha and beta chains in T cells and fibroblasts have suggested functional requirements for other T cell-specific factor(s). We now provide biochemical evidence for a distinct 100-kDa protein that interacts with the alpha or beta chains, or both, on the surface of the IL-2-dependent cell line CTLL-2 as well as activated murine splenocytes.

This enhancer is inducible by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in HeLa cells and is independent of its position and orientation with respect to the promoter. We have mapped the activity of the enhancer to two independent domains encompassing nucleotides 4079-4342 (end of the pol gene) and nucleotides 4781-6026 (vif gene and first coding exon of tat). This intragenic enhancer and its subdomains demonstrate cellular specificity because they are only active in specific cell lines. The presence of similar intragenic enhancer elements in other retroviruses suggests that they might be a conserved feature of this family of viruses.\r"

In this paper we show that ubiquinol-10, the reduced form of ubiquinone-10, also efficiently scavenges free radicals generated chemically within liposomal membranes. Ubiquinol-10 is about as effective in preventing peroxidative damage to lipids as alpha-tocopherol, which is considered the best lipid-soluble antioxidant in humans. The number of radicals scavenged by each molecule of ubiquinol-10 is 1.1 under our experimental conditions. In contrast to alpha-tocopherol, ubiquinol-10 is not recycled by ascorbate. However, it is known that ubiquinol-10 can be recycled by electron transport carriers present in various biomembranes and possibly by some enzymes. We also show that ubiquinol-10 spares alpha-tocopherol when both antioxidants are present in the same liposomal membranes and that ubiquinol-10, like alpha-tocopherol, does not interact with reduced glutathione. Our data together with previous work on the antioxidant function of ubiquinol reported in the literature strongly suggest that ubiquinol-10 is an important physiological lipid-soluble antioxidant.\r"

  ".W": "To determine which quantitative methods of image analysis are most suitable for the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant hepatic lesions, the authors analyzed magnetic resonance images obtained at 0.6 T in 42 patients with proved hepatic cavernous hemangioma and 63 patients with various hepatic malignancies. The lesion-liver signal-intensity ratio for images obtained with a repetition time of 2,350 msec and echo time of 180 msec was most helpful in distinguishing hemangiomas from cancer (area under the receiving operator characteristic curve [ROC] = 0.99 +/- 0.005). All 38 lesions with lesion-liver signal-intensity ratios greater than 3.5 were hemangiomas, whereas all 57 hepatic tumors with a ratio less than 2.5 were malignant neoplasms. A specificity of 93% and sensitivity of 89% can be achieved with use of quantitative signal-intensity data only. The authors conclude that in conjunction with heavily T2-weighted pulse sequences, signal-intensity ratios are an important adjunct to morphologic analysis in the differential diagnosis of hepatic neoplasms.\r"

Seventeen patients with histologically proved colorectal carcinoma and known metastatic disease underwent external scintigraphy after administration of 5.5 mCi (203.5 MBq) of In-111 CCR 086 at doses of 5 and 20 mg. Of 25 known lesions, 17 were detected (sensitivity, 68%). The smallest detected lesion in the lung was 1 cm and in the liver was 1.5 cm. The serum half-life of In-111-labeled CCR 086 MoAb was approximately 64 hours. The formation of human antimouse antibody (HAMA) was detected in the serum of four of five patients who received 20 mg of MoAb. No HAMAs were detected in four patients receiving 5 mg of MoAb. No side effects were encountered. Because of effective detection of liver and lung metastases with lower doses (5-20 mg) of CCR 086 conjugated with In-111, further investigations are warranted to assess clinical and therapeutic potentials of CCR 086 in the management of colorectal cancer.\r"

The ovarian dose was 15 mSv +/- 5 (1.5 rem +/- 0.5). The testes are not within the primary beam and therefore are exposed to scattered radiation only, hence the low received dose of 0.14 mSv or less (14 mrem or less).

Group 1 menisci resembled normal menisci except for mild shortening and frequent signal inhomogeneity (56%). Group 2 menisci varied in appearance, with marked contour irregularity simulating fragmentation in 40% of segments despite a normal postoperative appearance at follow-up arthroscopy. Group 3 menisci appeared similar to menisci of the same length without osteoarthritis. Arthroscopic correlation, available for 23 menisci (45%), confirmed the MR diagnosis of a tear in 11 and no tear in 49 and revealed an unsuspected tear in three meniscal segments. There is a spectrum of normal MR appearances after partial meniscectomy. Standard MR criteria can be used to diagnose tears in the absence of marked contour irregularity; however, the diagnosis of tears of segments with marked contour irregularity must be made cautiously, since this irregularity can mimic a tear and was not predictive of an arthroscopically visible tear.\r"

The nodular type showed a characteristic appearance on MR images. In each patient with the nodular type, both T1- and T2-weighted axial spin-echo images showed an oval nodule consisting of a star-shaped area of low signal intensity surrounded by an area of high signal intensity. Histopathologic correlation in patients with the nodular type revealed that the central portion of the nodule was fibrotic tissue surrounded by inflammatory granulomatous tissue. In each patient with the myopathic type of muscular sarcoidosis, MR images failed to show any abnormality; the authors hypothesize that this failure correlated with the sparse distribution of epithelioid cell granulomas. Identification of the star-shaped area of low signal intensity may help in the diagnosis of muscular sarcoidosis and the differentiation of lesions associated with sarcoidosis from other soft-tissue masses.\r"

Preoperative vascular imaging is required in all patients to detect the origin of the peroneal artery, to measure the length available for the vascular pedicle, and to evaluate for the normal continuation of the three major vessels of the lower leg. Magnetic resonance imaging of the lower leg with use of gradient-recalled acquisition in a steady, state was performed in 35 patients to evaluate vascular anatomy. Surgical correlation was available in 91% of cases, and in these 100% accuracy was demonstrated. Postoperative radiographs showed that grafts placed for osseous defects in the upper extremity were incorporated and hypertrophied extremely quickly, while those placed in the major weight-bearing bones of the lower extremity were much more prone to complications including delayed union, fracture, and infection. Vascularized grafts placed in the femoral head and neck for avascular necrosis incorporate only in the cephalic portion and should be watched carefully for signs of early and progressive femoral head collapse.\r"

Thirty cases of clinically suspected nonunion scaphoid waist fractures with inconclusive plain radiographs were prospectively studied by means of stationary tomography and lateral flexion-extension tomography. The angle between the two scaphoid fragments as seen in extension was measured and compared with the angle as seen in flexion. A difference of 10 degrees or greater between flexion and extension was considered significant. This was noted in 14 of 15 cases of nonunion. Fifteen cases without angle differences were accurately diagnosed as stable. One false-negative case was noted, which on review was attributed to a limited extension view. Flexion-extension tomography is a highly valuable diagnostic modality in evaluating the stability and healing of scaphoid fracture and is superior to conventional (stationary) tomography.\r"

An algorithm was designed to reconstruct artifact-free images for arbitrary table positions from the helical data by interpolating between adjacent scans. Section sensitivity profiles were enlarged; the section width for a 10-mm section and a speed of 10.0 mm/sec was increased by a factor of 1.3, compared with the nominal value. Clinical examples were presented for studies of lung nodules and studies enhanced with contrast medium. Major advantages are the possibility of continuous scanning of extended volumes within a breath-hold period and retrospective, arbitrary selection of anatomic levels.\r"

The other three patients underwent cholecystectomy because of a gallbladder collapse before admission, a tight stone-bearing phrygian cap, and a cannula slippage, respectively. A subhepatic approach was preferentially used after the fundus of the gallbladder was stabilized with a percutaneous anchor to prevent invagination and bile leakage. Retrograde slippage of the anchor into the tract in the first six patients was remedied by elongating the anchor from 2 to 3 cm. Calculi were removed in one session (11 patients) or two consecutive sessions (six patients). Morbidity included rehospitalization for stitch infection (n = 1) and dehydration (n = 1), cannula slippage (n = 1), broken guide wire (n = 1), vasovagal reaction (n = 1), and unextractable anchors (n = 3). Gallbladder endoscopy enabled identification of stones not visible at cholecystography. Hospitalization lasted 3-5 days; outpatient gallbladder drains were removed in 2-3 weeks in 10 patients and 4-6 weeks in seven (older) patients. No retained stones were seen at 6 months. The authors recommend PCL for patients at risk for surgery.\r"

The scans demonstrated extensive pleural thickening 4 weeks after catheter removal in all 10 patients. The pleural thickening had decreased 8 weeks after catheter removal. At 12 weeks, the pleura was essentially normal in four patients, demonstrated only a small area of plaque-like thickening in four patients, and was mildly thickened in two patients. This study demonstrates that the pleural surfaces have a remarkable capacity for healing after empyema drainage. The pleural peel resolves in most cases. These results suggest that decortication need not be performed routinely when such empyemas are encountered; rather, patients should be treated on an individualized basis and studied with serial CT to determine the necessity of decortication.\r"

The upper limit of accuracy of in vivo volume measurements is estimated to be within 0.1 cm3 of true volume for the HF and 0.9 cm3 for the ATL with a combined tracing-thresholding technique. Intra- and interobserver variations were estimated from the pooled standard deviations of HF and ATL measurements. With the combined tracing-thresholding technique, the coefficient of variation for HF measurement was 1.9%; for the ATL measurement, it was 0.7%.

After bolus administration of Gd-DTPA, rapid T2*-weighted gradient-echo images were acquired. Image acquisition time ranged from 2 to 3 seconds. The signal intensity (SI) of brain tissue and blood vessels markedly decreased during the first pass of contrast agent through the brain due to the local field inhomogeneity caused by the concentrated paramagnetic contrast agent. The method was used in 18 subjects with no cerebrovascular disease and 32 patients with stroke, vascular stenosis, arteriovenous malformation, and cerebral neoplasm. Comparison with intracranial angiography was performed in three patients and with single-photon emission computed tomography of blood flow in four. The change in T2* relaxation rate was approximately linearly related to the dose of contrast agent. The SI change increased as the echo time was lengthened. Regions in cerebral infarcts, metastases, and arteriovenous malformations showed different enhancement patterns than those of edema around a lesion and of normal brain tissue. Abnormal circulation times in patients with vascular stenoses were demonstrated. The method provides information about cerebral blood flow dynamics not available from conventional MR imaging and MR angiography.\r"

Investigations with the stimulated echo acquisition mode included studies in the right frontoparietal area, occipital lobe, cerebellum, and pons of healthy volunteers, as well as studies in two patients with astrocytomas. Prior to the acquisition of the H-1 MR spectra, all examinations included fast low angle shot MR imaging in three orientations to select the volumes of interest. The tumor spectra confirmed previous findings at higher field strengths by producing characteristic alterations from the spectra of normal brain tissue: markedly reduced resonances of N-acetyl-aspartate and creatine, increased signal intensities of cholines, and a strong resonance from lactate. The authors conclude that the results of this study clearly demonstrate the feasibility of H-1 MR spectroscopy at 1.0 T without significant losses in relative spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of major metabolites with singlet resonances, compared with previous studies at 1.5 and 2.0 T.\r"

Gd-DTPA-enhanced MR images revealed significant abnormalities not seen on the MR images obtained before administration of contrast material in four (27%) of 15 patients. The adult dose (0.1 mmol/kg) provided bright enhancement of normal intracranial structures. Because of significantly reduced glomerular filtration and renal clearance rates in newborns, vivid contrast enhancement of normal structures was seen to persist for several hours after injection. A prolonged window of time for imaging may therefore exist for neonates and young infants.\r"

  ".W": "High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is widely used to assess pulmonary parenchymal disease in adults. The authors used ultrafast CT with 3-mm collimation and a 100-msec scan time to obtain HRCT scans in 36 children (mean age, 49.4 months). Clinical diagnoses included normal lungs (n = 6), cystic fibrosis (n = 12), obliterative bronchiolitis (n = 6), idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis (n = 2), and other lung diseases (n = 10). The HRCT scans and chest radiographs were reviewed separately in blinded fashion. Pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities were categorized into interstitial, airspace, and airway processes. Nine patients with normal chest radiographs had abnormal HRCT scans. In five other patients, the extent of abnormal lung parenchyma was considerably greater on HRCT scans than on chest radiographs. HRCT scans allowed accurate characterization of the type of lung process in 24 of 30 patients when compared with clinical or biopsy findings. Early HRCT findings in cystic fibrosis included lobular air trapping, bronchial wall thickening, and centrilobular nodules. The use of cine CT with high-resolution techniques is feasible in children too young or too sick to hold their breath. HRCT may enable early detection and characterization of pulmonary disease and depiction of the extent of lung abnormality.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) were examined with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in order to analyze whether it is possible to distinguish in vivo between the two major prognostic groups, low-grade NHL and high-grade NHL. Most high-grade NHL nodes (15 of 24 [63%]) had an inhomogeneous appearance at MR imaging, in contrast to low-grade NHL nodes, which were homogeneous in almost all patients (18 of 20 [90%]) (P less than .001). A homogeneous image was also found in six patients who had previously received a diagnosis of low-grade NHL; at the time of examination their lesions had transformed into high-grade NHL. Necrosis, detectable in the histopathologic sections, was usually (five of six cases) associated with an inhomogeneous image. However, the images were also inhomogeneous [corrected] in 12 of 44 cases (27%) in which there were no signs of necrosis in the histopathologic sections. Patients with high-grade NHL and a homogeneous signal intensity pattern tended to have a better survival rate than those with an inhomogeneous pattern.\r"

  ".U": "90280750\r", 
  ".W": "To assess blood flow rapidly, a limited-flip-angle, gradient recalled pulse sequence was modified to acquire two views at the same phase-encoding step in successive repetitions. One view is obtained with first-moment flow compensation, while the second view is obtained with selectable flow encoding (non-zero first moment) along one direction. Blood flowing along the encoded direction acquires a phase difference between the two views, resulting in signal dependent on both direction and speed of flow. Stationary tissues undergo no phase change. Therefore, the phase shift between the two views produces an image that spatially renders flow direction and velocity. With a 24-msec repetition time, a 256 X 128 matrix, and two excitations, data acquisition is completed in 13 seconds per location (both a magnitude image and a flow image are produced at each location). Images generated with flow phantoms confirmed the accuracy of this method. Preliminary clinical evidence in 23 human subjects suggests that this method is useful in evaluating portal hypertension, distinguishing arterial from venous flow, distinguishing between slow flow and clot, and confirming the presence of clot. This method appears to be a fast, easy way to assess blood flow in large vessels.\r"

  ".W": "From 1962 to 1984, 13 patients with juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) were treated with megavoltage radiation therapy. Follow-up ranged from 40 to 255 months (median, 136 months). Two patients received radiation therapy as the initial treatment; the other 11 patients had undergone unsuccessful previous surgical treatment (median, three resections). Gross tumor was evident at the start of radiation therapy in seven patients, and orbital, sphenoid sinus, or intracranial extension was noted in eight of 13 (62%). Doses ranged from 3,600 to 5,200 cGy (median, 4,800 cGy in daily fractions of 180-200 cGy). Tumor was controlled in 11 patients (85%) after irradiation. Two patients were treated with embolization for residual mass; both remained asymptomatic and without evidence of tumor 134 and 83 months after embolization, respectively. With the exception of xerostomia and caries, no significant chronic morbidity was seen. This review and other studies demonstrate that megavoltage radiation therapy is an effective and appropriate treatment for advanced and recurrent JNA; its routine use for early tumors remains controversial.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-seven patients with 18 primary advanced or persistent, 16 local recurrent, and three local metastatic tumors of the head and neck were treated with a combination of interstitial low-dose iridium-192 radiation therapy and interstitial 915-MHz microwave hyperthermia supplemented by external radiation therapy. Twenty-eight lesions received an additional external radiation dose of 21-61 Gy. Interstitial hyperthermia was applied immediately before Ir-192 was placed and after its removal for 45-60 minutes at 41 degrees C-44 degrees C. Follow-up ranged from 4 to 45 months. At 3 months, complete remission occurred in 25 lesions (68%); partial remission, in nine (24%); and no change or progressive disease, in three (8%). At 12 months of follow-up in 32 lesions, local control was achieved in 23 (72%), with the patients alive, and in four (12%), with the patients dead. There were five local recurrences, one of which occurred after complete response. Lesion type, tumor volume, radiation dose, and thermal quality at high minimum temperature were identified as prognostic factors influencing complete remission. The combined treatment was well tolerated.\r"

  ".W": "The treatment results in 59 patients with extradural spinal cord compression (ESCC) who were treated with irradiation between April 1987 and December 1988 were analyzed prospectively. Eighty percent of the patients presented with back pain, which preceded ESCC by an average of 6 weeks. The most common primary tumor was lung cancer (27% of cases), followed by prostate cancer and breast cancer. The prognostic significance of pretreatment motor function, degree of spinal cord block, radiosensitivity of tumor, and radiation dose schedule was determined with multivariate analysis. Only pretreatment motor function was found to be a significant factor in determining functional prognosis (P = .0058). Even with the increasing clinical awareness of ESCC, 78% of the patients in the current series were nonambulatory at presentation. Therefore, computed tomographic myelography or magnetic resonance imaging is recommended for patients with back pain and bone destruction at the site of the complaint if local radiation treatment is not planned.\r"
