Due to variations in muscle injury, the clinical presentation may vary from the subclinical to the catastrophic. Muscle injuries may present in four broad categories: acute, chronic, acute exacerbation of a chronic problem, or subclinical alteration. Each muscle injury can be further broken down into five areas: tissue injury, clinical symptoms, functional biomechanical deficit, functional adaptations, and tissue overload. Case studies are presented to illustrate the presentation of each type and analysis of the component parts of the injury. It is only through such analysis that an accurate and complete diagnosis, followed by a functional rehabilitation plan, may be constructed.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether surface electromyography (EMG) from the erector spinae muscles could correctly identify individuals with low back pain without a population of elite athletes. A similar technique had previously been successful in identifying low back pain patients within a non-athletic population. A Back Analysis System was used to compute the median frequency of the EMG power density spectrum to monitor metabolic changes in back muscles associated with muscle fatigue. Twenty-three members of a men's collegiate varsity crew team consisting of port (N = 13) and starboard (N = 10) rowers were tested in a laboratory during a fatigue-inducing isometric contraction sustained at a relatively high, constant force. Six of the rowers tested were further classified as having low back pain. A brief test contraction was repeated at a fixed interval following the fatiguing contraction to monitor recovery. A two-group discriminant analysis procedure correctly classified 100% of the rowers with low back pain and 93% of the rowers without back pain on the basis of the median frequency data. The median frequency parameters related to recovery were the best discriminators of back pain. A similar analysis correctly classified 100% of the port rowers and 100% of the starboard rowers on the basis of their spectral parameters. The best discriminating variables in this instance were the median frequency parameters relating to both fatigability and recovery. Results from this study demonstrate that low back pain and asymmetrical muscle function in rowers can be assessed on the basis of EMG spectral analysis.\r"

During a 4-d period of weight loss, subjects were randomly assigned to a high carbohydrate (HC) or low carbohydrate (LC) diet. A crossover design was used; subjects were measured before (PRE) and after (POST) weight loss on both diets for a 6-min bout of high intensity arm cranking, weight, skinfold thickness, and profile of mood states (POMS). Hemoglobin, hematocrit, and glycerol concentrations were analyzed for resting blood samples, while lactate, pH, and base excess were analyzed for blood samples drawn at rest and 1, 3, and 5 min after arm cranking. A three-way ANOVA of sprint work revealed a weight loss effect, a diet by weight loss interaction, and an order by diet by weight loss interaction (P less than 0.05). Total sprint work (mean +/- SE) PRE and POST HC was 37.7 +/- 2.1 kJ and 37.4 +/- 2.2 kJ, respectively. Sprint work was higher for PRE LC vs POST LC, with mean values of 37.4 +/- 2.1 kJ and 34.4 +/- 2.2 kJ, respectively. Post-arm cranking lactate was significantly higher PRE compared to POST for both HC and LC. Post-exercise blood pH was lower (P less than 0.05) at PRE vs POST, with no diet effect. Regardless of the diet, POMS variables tension, depression, anger, fatigue, and confusion were significantly elevated from PRE to POST; vigor was significantly lower.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Hyperhydration prior to exercise may decrease, delay, or eliminate the detrimental effects of hypohydration. The rapid clearance of excess fluid makes hyperhydration of subjects with common beverages difficult. Glycerol, a natural metabolite which is rapidly absorbed, has osmotic action, and is evenly distributed within the body fluid compartments, was tested as a possible hyperhydrating agent. In six subjects, the following fluid regimens at time 0 were randomly administered on three separate days: in trial 1, glycerol (1 g.kg-1 body weight) plus water (21.4 ml.kg-1 body weight); in trial 2, water (21.4 ml.kg-1); and in trial 3, water (3.3 ml.kg-1) was ingested at time 0. The subjects performed moderate exercise (equivalent to 60% VO2max in a comfortable environment) in a hot dry environment. The exercise started at 2.5 h after the fluids were ingested. The urine volume prior to exercise was decreased when glycerol was ingested, thus resulting in glycerol-induced hyperhydration. During the exercise following the glycerol-induced hyperhydration, there was elevated sweat rate and lower rectal temperature during the moderate exercise in the heat. There were no changes in hemoglobin, hematocrit, or serum electrolyte concentrations following glycerol intake. These data support the hypothesis that glycerol-induced hyperhydration reduces the thermal burden of moderate exercise in the heat.\r"

Recently, the validity of this method has been challenged (Brouns et al., Int. J. Sports Med. 8:175-189, 1987) by suggestions that the duodenal contents remaining from previous drinks may influence the gastric emptying of subsequent drinks. To evaluate whether this methodological issue might influence the results of gastric emptying studies, we studied six volunteer subjects. The gastric emptying rate of water was measured following a previous trial with either water or a concentrated maltodextrin solution (23% CHO). All trials were conducted at rest and consisted of a volume of 400 ml. The emptying rate of water was not different following either water or maltodextrin solution (14.9 vs 16.3 ml.min-1). We conclude that the serial recovery method remains a valid technique for measuring the rate of gastric emptying during rest and exercise.\r"

Mean (range) VO2max was 3.42 l.min-1 (2.96-3.87). Training resulted in a 20% increase (P less than 0.05) in plasma volume (PV) and a 12% increase (P less than 0.05) in total blood volume (TBV). In contrast, training had no effect (P greater than 0.05) in altering exercise VO2, VCO2, VE BTPS, or RER. Cardiac output (Q) was higher (P less than 0.05) posttraining at all exercise sampling times (30, 60, 90, and 120 min). The elevations in Q were accompanied by an average decrease (P less than 0.05) in stroke volume (SV) of 22 ml. Arteriovenous O2 (a-v O2) difference was depressed (P less than 0.05) during exercise following the training. Although elevations (P less than 0.05) in core temperature (degrees C) occurred during the exercise, the training-induced PV increases did not affect thermoregulatory behavior. These results indicate that an early adaptive response to exercise training is an elevation in Q, an increase in SV, and a reduction in HR. These effects persist during prolonged exercise in spite of the progressive increase in body heat content. It is proposed that the increase in Q serves primarily to increase muscle blood flow and maintain arterial O2 delivery, while the altered cardiodynamic behavior serves to increase cardiac reserve, providing a greater tolerance to prolonged heavy exercise.\r"

  ".W": "The physiological mechanism of exercise-induced hyperfibrinolysis is not fully understood. It has been reported that exercise increases plasma arginine vasopressin (PAVP) and that PAVP infusion enhances blood fibrinolytic activity (FA). To characterize the fibrinolytic role of PAVP during exercise, PAVP and FA were examined before and after submaximal and maximal exercise in 16 normal, healthy volunteers. After completion of a 100% VO2max exercise test on a bicycle ergometer, which elicited exhaustion in 14.3 +/- 1.4 min (MSD), subjects were randomly assigned to exercise trials at 40% and 70% VO2max for 15 min, each of the three tests being separated by 7 d. Prior to and immediately after the completion of the respective exercise treatment, heart rate, VO2 uptake, and respiratory quotient were measured and venous blood was removed and analyzed for PAVP using radioimmunoassay. The fibrin plate method (FP) and euglobulin lysis time (ELT) technique were employed to assess FA. The intrinsic and extrinsic plasminogen activators' response to all exercise treatments was also examined in pooled plasma prepared from the same subjects. Differentiation between the intrinsic and extrinsic activators' activity was ascertained in the FP by blocking the former with the addition of C1-inactivator. Lactic acid was measured using a standard spectrophotometric method. Compared to rest, FA was significantly increased (P less than 0.05) in all exercise tests when assessed using ELT, with a response related to exercise intensity. However, the 40% VO2max exercise trial caused a nonsignificant increase (P greater than 0.05) in FA using the FP method, with a significant increase (P less than 0.05) being observed in 70% and 100% VO2max exercise tests.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Intense exercise of short duration is heavily dependent on energy from anaerobic sources, and subjects successful in anaerobic types of sports may therefore have a larger anaerobic capacity and be able to release energy at a higher rate. Performances in these kinds of sports are improved by training, suggesting that the anaerobic capacity is trainable. The purpose of this investigation was to study the effect of training on anaerobic capacity. We therefore determined the anaerobic capacity, expressed as the maximal accumulated O2 deficit during treadmill running, of untrained, endurance-trained, and sprint-trained young men. In addition, seven women and five men trained for 6 wk, and their anaerobic capacity was compared before and after the training period. There was no difference in anaerobic capacity between the untrained and endurance-trained subjects, whereas the sprinters' anaerobic capacity was 30% larger (P less than 0.001). The women's anaerobic capacity was 17% less than the men's (P = 0.03). Six weeks of training increased the anaerobic capacity by 10%. We conclude that the anaerobic capacity varies significantly between subjects and that it can be improved within 6 wk. Moreover, there was a close relationship between a high anaerobic capacity and a high peak rate of anaerobic energy release.\r"

All subjects were sedentary. Morphological characteristics and body composition were similar in both groups. They were tested for maximal force during voluntary isometric contraction of the knee extensors and for total work output during 10 s, 30 s, and 90 s of maximal and repetitive knee extensions. Results indicated no significant differences between Blacks and Whites in maximal force of the knee extensors (736 +/- 78 N vs 722 +/- 11 N, respectively) and in total work output during the 10-s (1134 +/- 246 J vs 1124 +/- 207 J) and 30-s (2735 +/- 519 J vs 2779 +/- 647 J) tests. There was a difference of about 400 J between Blacks and Whites in the total work output during the 90-s test, but this difference was not statistically significant. However, significant differences were found between Blacks and Whites in the peak power output decrement during the last 60 s of the 90-s anaerobic test. These differences in peak power output between the two groups ranged between 7 and 10 W during the last 30 s of the 90-s test. The results indicate that knee extensor muscles of sedentary Black and White males have similar anaerobic performance power and capacities. However, the results reveal that sedentary Black subjects experience a greater degree of fatigue than sedentary Whites during an anaerobic exercise lasting longer than 30 s.\r"

The force patterns were obtained at power outputs of 100 W and 200 W for pedalling rates of 40-120 rpm in intervals of 10 rpm. Data were not obtained at 40 rpm at the 200 W power output. The Fr averaged over a crank cycle (Far) was lowest at 90 rpm and 100 W, a value statically different (P less than 0.05) from those at 40, 50, and 120 rpm. At 200 W, the Fr was lowest at 100 rpm, a value statistically different (P less than 0.05) from those at 50, 60, and 70 rpm. The Far varied widely (range of 30% of mean for all subjects) for individuals at a given power output. The results suggest that pedalling at 90-100 rpm may minimize peripheral forces and therefore peripheral muscle fatigue even though this rate may result in higher oxygen uptake.\r"

Nine highly trained endurance runners participated in a double-blind, placebo (PL), crossover study. Each subject undertook an IN or PL trial, consisting of three exercise tests: a submaximal warm-up run (SUBRUN), a competitive 3-mile treadmill run (3MRUN), and a maximal treadmill run (MAXRUN) to determine VO2 peak and time to exhaustion (MAXTIME). Additional measurements during the 3MRUN and MAXRUN included oxygen uptake (VO2), ventilation (VE), respiratory exchange ratio (R), and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE); blood samples were also taken prior (PRERUN) to the SUBRUN test and following the SUBRUN, 3MRUN, and MAXRUN tests in order to assess glucose, pyruvate, lactate, phosphorus, 2,3-DPG, hemoglobin, and uric acid. Analyses of the data revealed no significant effect of oral IN supplementation either upon 3MTIME (IN = 18.31 +/- 1.21; PL = 18.33 +/- 1.15 min) or VO2 peak (IN = 58.6 +/- 5.1; PL = 60.7 +/- 4.5 ml O2.kg-1.min-1) or upon other dependent variables. MAXTIME was significantly longer during the PL trial (P less than 0.05), suggestive of a possible impairment effect of oral IN supplementation. Based upon our data, we conclude that IN is not an effective ergogenic aid to enhance athletic performance of an aerobic nature.\r"

The CAPE training consisted of 10 min bouts on six CAPE tables, twice per week. The cycle ergometer group trained twice per week for 30 min per session, at 70-85% of maximal heart rate. The cycle ergometer and CAPE groups trained for 12 wk, while the control group remained sedentary for the duration of the study. Groups were similar with respect to age, height, weight, girths, skinfolds, and aerobic power (VO2max) upon entering the study (P greater than 0.05). The groups were tested pre- and post-training on the sum of seven body girths (sigma 7G), sum of four skinfolds (sigma 4SF), weight, and VO2max. A 3 d dietary recall was recorded pre and post and analyzed for total caloric intake. Following training, changes in caloric intake, sigma 7G, and sigma 4SF were not significantly different among groups. The cycle group lost 1.1 kg (P less than 0.05) and increased VO2max (l.min-1) by 9.2% (P less than 0.05), while the CAPE group significantly decreased VO2max (P = 0.04). Our results indicate that CAPE does not alter sigma 7G or sigma 4SF in sedentary PMW and that two 30 min sessions of cycle training per week at 70-85% of maximal heart rate can result in moderate but significant increases in VO2max in sedentary PMW.\r"

Improvement was defined as a larger value for minimal weight and a smaller standard deviation compared to minimal weight estimated from body density. Forty adolescent males (mean age +/- SD, 15.5 +/- 1.4 yr) were measured for height, weight, body density (hydrostatic weighing), total body water (deuterium oxide dilution), and bone mineral content (single photon absorptiometry). Twenty-two adult males (mean age +/- SD, 23.6 +/- 2.2 yr) were measured as a reference group. Percent body fat and minimal weight were calculated from the body density (MWD), body density adjusted for total body water (MWDW), and body density adjusted for body water and bone mineral content (MWDWB). Repeated-measures ANOVA was used to test for differences between the methods and for trends in the data. The results showed a slight but nonsignificant increase in minimal weight for the adolescent group when body water and bone mineral data were added. The means +/- SD for MWD, MWDW, and MWDWB values of the adolescents were 54.6 +/- 9.0 kg, 54.8 +/- 8.6 kg, and 55.4 +/- 8.4 kg, respectively. It was concluded that the multicomponent methods, which accounted for hydration and bone mineral status, did not significantly improve the estimates of minimal weight of adolescent males compared to the single component method, i.e., minimal weight from body density.\r"

These age and health status criteria (apparently healthy, higher risk, and diseased) were developed using clinical judgement and opinion rather than empirical data. Thus, there is a need to validate the recommendations with actual data. We studied the results of 24,332 maximal treadmill tests in men (n = 18,076) and women (n = 5,626) as they associated with age and baseline health status. Commonly accepted criteria for abnormal exercise tests were used (i.e., 1 mm ST segment depression at 0.08 s, systolic blood pressure drop with exercise, complex ventricular ectopy, etc.). There were 895 and 183 abnormal exercise tests in men and women, respectively. Men and women who were apparently healthy had lower abnormality rates per 1,000 tests than those considered to be at higher risk for coronary heart disease and those who had preexisting disease. Further, when those who were at higher risk were considered, those men with only one risk factor had significantly lower abnormality rates than did men with more than one risk factor (95% confidence intervals (CI) per 1,000 tests: 1 risk factor = 36.1-46.4; greater than 1 risk factor = 47.5-62.5). Abnormality rates in women with 1 risk factor were also lower than those in their peers with greater than 1 risk factor, but not statistically so (95% CI per 1,000 tests: 1 risk factor = 24.9-43.0; greater than 1 risk factor = 25.3-54.4).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Energy balance can be written as 1) M = sigma Q +/- W +/- S, expressed as power (W), where M is the rate of metabolic energy transformation, sigma Q the rate of heat loss, W the work rate, and S the rate of body heat storage. When submaximal treadmill exercise continues long enough, body temperature stops changing, S becomes zero, and the heat storage term is dropped from equation 1. For uphill walking the equation becomes 2) M = sigma Q + Wvert, and for downhill walking it becomes 3) M = sigma Q - Wvert. This study tested the energy balance equations with direct measurements of heat exchange using a suit calorimeter and M from standard measurements of respiratory gas exchange. Ten healthy men walked on a motor driven treadmill at 1.5 m.s-1 at grades of 0, 5, 10, -5, and -10% for 70-90 min to ensure a thermal steady state. As expected, +Wvert was identified as a power output, whereas -Wvert was accounted for as a power input, totally transformed to heat in the downhill walking subject. There also appeared to be a quantity of non-thermal energy, Wwalk, needed to satisfy the energy balance equation. This was significant at 0, 5, and 10% grades (P less than 0.01) but not significant at -5 and -10% grades (P greater than 0.05). The data confirm previous results for level walking and extend them to include uphill walking. While it had been suggested that Wwalk represents an externalization of energy at the foot, the present data suggest an alternative explanation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Marfan syndrome, \"the founding member\" of the heritable disorders of connective tissue, is a common autosomal dominant disorder with highly variable clinical manifestations in the skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular systems. The fundamental defect leading to this disease has escaped definition despite decades of research efforts by several groups of investigators. METHODS AND RESULTS. Using linkage analyses with polymorphic markers of the human genome, we mapped the genetic defect to chromosome 15 in five families with Marfan syndrome. With three polymorphic markers we obtained definitive proof of linkage in these families (lod score = 3.92, theta = 0.0 +/- 0.11). The most probable location of the gene for the disease is currently D15S45 (lod score = 3.32, theta = 0.0 +/- 0.12). CONCLUSIONS. The chromosomal localization of the mutation in Marfan syndrome is a first step toward the isolation and characterization of the defective gene and serves as a diagnostic test in families in which cosegregation of these markers with the disease has been confirmed.\r"

We report here a novel class of chloride channels that can be activated by adrenaline in mammalian ventricular cells. Like the agonist-activated Cl- channel currents of airway and colonic epithelial cells, the cardiac Cl(-)-channel current shows outward rectification. But the unit conductance of cardiac Cl- channels is smaller than that of epithelial Cl- channels. The cardiac Cl- channel is functionally voltage-independent, in contrast to the Cl- channel in colonic epithelial cells. This channel could be responsible for the beta-catecholamine-induced increase in cardiac membrane conductance that has been attributed to activation of a Cl- current. Thus, sympathetic control of cardiac electrical activity involves not only the voltage-dependent, excitation-related cation channels, but also anion channels that generate a steady current.\r"

  ".W": "Effector T cells are restricted to recognizing antigens associated with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Specific recognition is mediated by the alpha beta heterodimer of the T-cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 complex, although other membrane components are involved in T-cell antigen recognition and functions. There has been much controversy in this regard over the part played by the CD4 glycoprotein. It is known that expression of CD4 correlates closely with the cell's ability to recognize antigens bound to class II MHC molecules and that CD4 can bind to class II molecules. Also monoclonal antibodies to CD4 can modify signals generated through the TCR/CD3 complex. It has therefore been proposed that CD4 binds to class II molecules, coaggregates with the TCR-CD3 complex and aids the activation of T cells. But given that TCR can itself impart restriction on the cell, it remains unclear whether the contribution of CD4-derived signals to those generated through the TCR alpha beta-CD3 complex is central to this activation. Here we report that when preceded by ligation of CD4, signalling through TCR alpha beta results in T cell unresponsiveness due to the induction of activation dependent cell death by apoptosis. These results imply that CD4 is critically involved in determining the outcome of signals generated through TCR, and could explain why the induction of effector T cells needs to be MHC-restricted.\r"

  ".W": "The human leukocyte antigens (HLA) are implicated in the genetic susceptibility to a large number of diseases. Some of the diseases associated with HLA class II are related to specific amino acids or epitopes of the domain of the HLA class II molecule that is distal to the membrane. In man, selective immunoglobulin A deficiency is the most common immunodeficiency, frequently resulting in recurrent sino-pulmonary infections and gastro-intestinal disorders. Associations have been described with HLA class I, and to a lesser extent with different class II alleles, which might indicate that they share some common feature. Here we study 95 IgA-D patients and find positive associations with three DR-DQ haplotypes and a strong negative association with a fourth haplotype. Comparison of the sequences of the polymorphic amino-terminal domain of the DQ beta chain showed that the three 'susceptibility' haplotypes all had a neutral alanine or valine at position 57. The 'protective' allele had the negatively charged aspartic acid at this position (Asp57). Codon 57 of the HLA-DQ beta chain has been implicated in the susceptibility to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Our data suggest that the same amino acid position could possibly also influence susceptibility and resistance to selective immunoglobulin A deficiency.\r"

As part of an analysis of the hormonal control of development, we have examined the Drosophila genome for retinoic acid receptor homologues. Here we describe one such gene, XR2C, which encodes a product with structural similarity to the human retinoic acid-responsive transcription factor, retinoid X receptor. This receptor-like protein is encoded by ultraspiracle (usp), a locus required both maternally and zygotically for pattern formation. The discovery that the usp product is a retinoid X receptor homologue suggests that similar chemical cues underlie morphogenic signalling in vertebrate and invertebrate systems.\r"

This was proven by biopsy in three patients after 1 to 3 years. In all of the patients, conjunctival transplants were not available. Pronounced relief of pain and modest visual improvements are achieved with this procedure, and free autologous nasal mucosal grafts appear to be superior to buccal mucosa in reestablishing the anterior ocular surface.

Cystoid macular edema was present in five (71%) of seven macular cysts, and an ERM was noted in only one (14%). The authors' results suggest that ERM tangential traction may play a role in the pathogenesis of lamellar macular holes. Macular holes often have associated ERMs and CME, which may be potentially reversible.\r"

These studies showed that the lesion was composed of tall, maximally pigmented RPE cells that had a density 1.7 times greater than the density of the adjacent normal peripheral RPE. These observations suggested that cellular hyperplasia and hypertrophy may contribute to CHRPE. Ultraviolet fluorescence microscopy showed no autofluorescent granules of lipofuscin in the CHRPE, suggesting that the lesion's constituent cells lack the capacity to phagocytose and digest photoreceptor outer segments. Photoreceptor degeneration in the overlying retina consequent to this functional defect could be responsible for the localized visual field defects that typically occur in patients with CHRPE.\r"

  ".W": "Retinal circulation times (RCT) and mean circulation time (MCT) in the retinal vasculature have been used to determine the effect of ocular disease on retinal circulation. Both RCT and MCT are usually determined by measuring dye dilution curves during a traditional fluorescein angiogram. The authors present a variation of the dye dilution technique. The primary difference is that a fluorescent dye (carboxyfluorescein or calcein) was encapsulated in liposomes at a very high concentration. The dye was then released at a specific site in a retinal artery by the application of a laser pulse delivered through the pupil of the eye. The heat pulse produced by the laser lysed the liposomes in the targeted vessel, causing a stream of dye to be released. The time it took the dye front to pass through the artery and return through the vein (RCT) was then measured. To clarify the situation, two times were actually measured, the shortest path the dye traveled from the exposure site to a corresponding site on the vein (short RCT) and the longest path through the periphery to venous filling (long RCT). The measurements were made in both cynomolgus monkeys and squirrel monkeys. The local dye release achieved with this method was found to produce a more distinct dye front than traditional angiography while also eliminating the problem of recirculation. Choroidal background fluorescence, a factor that often obscures the dye front in traditional angiography, was minimal. Furthermore, it was possible to make individual measurements on each of the four arteries and to repeat the measurements several times.\r"

It may be the result of either prescription by the patient's eye care practitioner, theft from the practitioner's office, or occult additives in therapeutic medications. The authors report observations of six individuals suffering from this disorder which suggest that persistent epithelial defects, corneal stromal ring infiltrates, disproportionate pain, and prescription or nonprescription substance abuse may be factors involved. Penetrating keratoplasty was required to treat corneal perforation in two patients, and permanent corneal structural damage was noted in two eyes. Two eyes had a relentless downhill course culminating in enucleation. Because five of the six patients were diagnosed and treated as having presumed Acanthamoeba keratitis during the course of their disease, topical ocular anesthetic use should be included in the differential diagnosis of chronic keratitis and may masquerade as Acanthamoeba keratitis. The authors believe that practitioners should not prescribe or dispense topical anesthetics and should avoid clinical settings which provide an opportunity for the theft of topical ocular anesthetics.\r"

  ".W": "A class of proteins that mimic the fundamental pore structure of authentic ionic channels has been designed, synthesized, and characterized. The design is based on our earlier result that a 23-mer peptide with the sequence of the M2 segment of the Torpedo californica acetylcholine receptor delta subunit--Glu-Lys-Met-Ser-Thr-Ala-Ile-Ser-Val-Leu-Leu-Ala-Gln-Ala-Val-Phe -Leu- Leu-Leu-Thr-Ser-Gln-Arg--forms cation-selective channels in lipid bilayers, presumably by self-assembly of conductive oligomers. Accordingly, a tethered parallel tetramer was synthesized with four M2 delta peptides attached to a carrier template--a 9-amino acid backbone with four attachment sites. As expected, the complete 101-residue protein does form channels in lipid bilayers reproducing several features that are characteristic of authentic acetylcholine receptor channels, such as single-channel conductance, cation selectivity, transitions between closed and open states in the millisecond time range, and sensitivity to local anesthetic channel blockers. An analogue protein, in which the serine residue in position 8 is replaced with alanine in each of the four M2 delta 23-mer peptides ([Ala8]M2 delta), also forms channels that, however, exhibit lower single-channel conductance. By contrast, a similar tethered tetramer with M1 delta peptides does not form channels, in accord with expectations. The general validity of this strategy to other channel sequences and oligomer numbers is anticipated. Thus, synporins--a term coined to identify this class of synthetic pore proteins--enrich our armamentarium directed toward the elucidation of structure-function relationships.\r"

Immunocytochemical analysis revealed PAI-1 associated with microgranular and fibrillar material of the extracellular matrix and demonstrated the presence of PAI-1 as a cell surface-associated antigen. Transforming growth factor beta significantly reduced matrix degradation mediated by HT-1080 human fibrosarcoma cells. This inhibition was correlated with an increase in PAI-1 antigen expression, whereas urinary-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) secretion was unaffected. In this experimental system, PAI-1 regulated extracellular matrix breakdown, as added PAI-1 inhibited matrix solubilization, whereas monoclonal antibodies to PAI-1 increased it. A cell line (LPAI) producing high levels of biologically active PAI-1 was established by transfection of a human PAI-1 cDNA clone into mouse L cells. Coculture experiments demonstrated that LPAI cells prevented matrix degradation by Lu-PA cells (L cells expressing high levels of u-PA) or Co-115 human colon carcinoma cells (expressing tissue-type plasminogen activator). These results indicate that PAI-1 may play a critical role in the regulation of extracellular matrix degradation during tumor cell invasion.\r"

After 3 weeks in culture these lymphoid cells, which neither expressed surface CD3/Ti molecules nor rearranged Ti beta- or gamma-chain genes and which lysed K562 human erythroleukemia cells, displayed specific cytotoxicity for the stimulating ECs. Furthermore, freshly isolated NK cells bound and then removed from each of several allogeneic EC lines displayed selective cytotoxicity for the adsorbing EC line. These results provide evidence for alloantigen-specific recognition of microvascular ECs by NK cells that appears to be determined, at least in part, at the level of adherence. We discuss the implications of these findings with respect to the rejection of vascularized organ allografts.\r"

This region lies several hundred kilobases (kb) 3' of the mouse c-myc gene (Myc) which is deregulated in both rcpt(6;15) and rcpt(12;15) plasmacytomas. rcpt(12;15) translocations apparently activate c-myc directly by interrupting the gene itself, but the mechanism causing c-myc deregulation in tumors bearing rcpt(6;15) translocations remains unknown. The indirect activation of c-myc by Pvt-1 interruption has remained an appealing possibility, but heretofore it has not been possible to establish such a connection. Furthermore, no genes from the Pvt-1 locus have been shown to be transcribed in normal tissues or in tumors with rcpt(6;15) translocations. We report the isolation of a cDNA clone, Pvt-1-1, from mouse spleen mRNA that is specific to the Pvt-1 region. This cDNA probe detects low levels of large (ca. 14 kb) RNA transcripts in normal mouse tissues. In plasmacytomas with rcpt(6;15) translocations, the Pvt-1 transcripts are elevated in abundance and truncated in size. Both changes are apparently induced by the chromosomal translocation. Expression of 14-kb Pvt-1 RNA is elevated in B-cell tumor lines that express immunoglobulin light chain genes; thus, we postulate that these translocations are facilitated by the increased DNA accessibility of immunoglobulin kappa light chain and Pvt-1 genes when they are simultaneously expressed at certain times during B-cell ontogeny.\r"

Whereas PTH is a classical peptide hormone, mounting evidence suggests that the PTHRP may have predominately local actions. We report here that the PTHRP gene is expressed in rat myometrium, with a major peak in PTHRP mRNA expression occurring in the 48 hr immediately preceding parturition. A similar peak in peptide content was found in tissue extracts by biological and immunological assays, but the PTHRP could not be detected in the peripheral circulation or in uterine vein plasma during late gestation. By in situ hybridization histochemistry, PTHRP mRNA was demonstrated in both the longitudinal and circular layers of smooth muscle but was absent in the endometrium. The rise in myometrial PTHRP mRNA in late gestation was dependent upon intrauterine occupancy; it was greatly reduced or absent in nongravid uterine horns. These findings indicate that the expression of the PTHRP gene in preterm myometrium is under the control of a local stimulus and suggest that the PTHRP may play a paracrine or autocrine role in the uterus during the antepartum period, possibly involving myometrial contractility.\r"

Several studies in animals, however, have failed to demonstrate modulation of eicosanoid biosynthesis by steroids in vivo. We administered prednisone (60 mg/day) to eight healthy volunteers and measured eicosanoid formation by a variety of cell types in vivo and ex vivo, using sensitive and specific physicochemical assays. We found that the in vivo course of prednisone failed to inhibit the synthesis of thromboxane A2, prostaglandin I2 (prostacyclin), prostaglandin E2, and leukotriene E4 in vivo and of leukotriene B4 ex vivo. Biosynthesis of leukotriene B4, thromboxane B2, and prostaglandins F2 and E2 by macrophage-rich bronchoalveolar lavage cells was strongly suppressed. These findings indicate that therapeutic regimens of glucocorticoids suppress eicosanoid biosynthesis in human macrophages but not in a number of other cell types with steroid receptors, the capacity for eicosanoid formation, and lipocortin-like material.\r"

A cDNA library constructed from a hamster kidney cell line rich in FGF receptor activity was transfected into a human lymphoblastoid cell line. Clones expressing functional basic FGF binding proteins at their surfaces were enriched by panning on plastic dishes coated with human basic FGF. The amino acid sequence deduced from the isolated cDNAs revealed several interesting features, including hydrophobic signal and transmembrane domains that flank an extracellular region containing six potential attachment sites for glycosaminoglycan side chains. The structure also contains a short hydrophilic cytoplasmic tail sequence homologous to previously reported actin binding domains. Binding of basic FGF to cells expressing the binding protein could be inhibited by heparin and heparan sulfate but not by chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, or keratan sulfate. In addition to binding basic FGF, this protein or related surface proteins may function as an initial cellular attachment site for other growth factors and for viruses, such as herpes simplex virus.\r"

We report that an antiserum against the polypeptide encoded by the L1Hs 5' open reading frame (ORF1) detects, in human cells, an endogenous ORF1 protein as well as the ORF1 product of an appropriate transfecting recombinant vector. The endogenous polypeptide is most abundant in teratocarcinoma and choriocarcinoma cells, among those cell lines tested; it appears to be a single species of approximately 38 kDa. In contrast, RNAs synthesized in vitro from cDNAs representing full-length, polyadenylylated cytoplasmic L1Hs RNA yield, upon in vitro translation, ORF1 products of slightly different sizes. This is consistent with the fact that the various cDNAs are different and represent transcription of different genomic L1Hs elements. In vitro studies additionally suggest that translation of ORF1 is initiated at the first AUG codon. Finally, in no case was an ORF1-ORF2 fusion protein detected.\r"

  ".U": "90384939\r", 
  ".W": "The high-affinity receptor for IgE (Fc epsilon RI) is a four-subunit structure consisting of three distinct polypeptides: the IgE-binding alpha chain, the four-fold membrane-spanning beta chain, and the disulfide-linked gamma-gamma homodimer. cDNAs encoding each subunit have previously been isolated. Here we show that microinjection of Xenopus oocytes with a mixture of in vitro transcribed RNAs encoding each subunit results in expression of IgE receptors at the oocyte surface as detected by binding of IgE or anti-Fc epsilon RI alpha subunit monoclonal antibody to intact oocytes. Surface expression of Fc epsilon RI requires injection of all three subunits (alpha, beta, and gamma) RNAs. In particular, omission of Fc epsilon RI gamma RNA from the mixtures abolishes surface binding of either IgE or anti-Fc epsilon RI alpha monoclonal antibody to microinjected oocytes. However, addition of CD3 zeta RNA to Fc epsilon RI alpha and Fc epsilon RI beta RNAs restores IgE receptor surface expression when this combination is microinjected into oocytes. Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation of oocyte microinjected with a mixture of CD3 zeta plus Fc epsilon RI alpha and Fc epsilon RI beta RNAs reveals a noncovalent association between the CD3 zeta-zeta disulfide-linked homodimer and Fc epsilon RI alpha-beta. These results provide direct evidence for the functional relatedness of CD3 zeta and Fc epsilon RI gamma.\r"

In this system transcription is stimulated by TGA1a, a tobacco DNA-binding protein, and the stimulation is dependent on the presence of its cognate binding site upstream of the TATA box. Titration experiments showed that transcription initiation is more sensitive than transcription elongation to low concentrations of sarkosyl (N-lauroylsarcosine). At 0.07% sarkosyl, the formation of initiated complex is inhibited but transcription elongation is not. Under these conditions, events associated with a single round of transcription can be studied. We demonstrate that the time required for completing transcription of a 380-base-pair template is about 10 min. Addition of TGA1a increases the number of preinitiation complexes by approximately 3-fold with no significant effect on the frequency of transcription initiation from a single complex or on the rate of RNA elongation. We anticipate that this in vitro system will be valuable for the elucidation of mechanisms that regulate transcription in plants.\r"

  ".W": "Evaluation of the immune response of individuals exposed to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an important component of any plan designed to lead toward the development of an AIDS vaccine. Since the levels of antibodies to HIV p17 and the synthetic p17 peptide HGP-30 correlate with stages of progression to AIDS, studies were initiated to determine whether cytotoxic lymphocytes directed toward target cells pulsed with HGP-30 and radioactive chromium were present in seropositive individuals. The significance of such cells in controlling HIV viral infection has recently been enhanced by reports that HIV p17 is on the surface of infected cells and that an inactivated virus vaccine depleted of viral envelope appears to be effective in controlling expression. The selection of HGP-30 as the p17 peptide to be evaluated in early studies is based on the presence of both T-cell and B-cell epitopes as predicted by computer modeling and mouse studies and the demonstration of in vitro neutralization activity by antibodies to the epitope. By using B-lymphoblastoid cells pulsed with HGP-30 and radioactive chromium as autologous targets and mixed leukocyte culture-expanded peripheral blood lymphocytes as effectors, CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes against HGP-30-coated targets were identified in seropositive individuals. In this report we demonstrate that a synthetic p17 epitope can be a target for major histocompatibility complex-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes in HIV-infected individuals.\r"

  ".W": "Within the basal ganglia, acetylcholine and dopamine play a central role in the extrapyramidal control of motor function. The physiologic effects of these neurotransmitters are mediated by a diversity of receptor subtypes, several of which have now been cloned. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are encoded by five genes (m1-m5), and of the two known dopamine receptor subtypes (D1 and D2) the D2 receptor gene has been characterized. To gain insight into the physiological roles of each of these receptor subtypes, we prepared oligodeoxynucleotide probes to localize receptor subtype mRNAs within the rat striatum and substantia nigra by in situ hybridization histochemistry. Within the striatum, three muscarinic (m1, m2, m4) receptor mRNAs and the D2 receptor mRNA were detected. The m1 mRNA was expressed in most neurons (greater than 80%); the m2 mRNA, in neurons which were both very large and rare; and the m4 and D2 mRNAs, in 40-50% of the neurons, one-third of which express both mRNAs. Within the substantia nigra, pars compacta, only the m5 and D2 mRNAs were detected, and most neurons expressed both mRNAs. These data provide anatomical evidence for the identity of the receptor subtypes which mediate the diverse effects of muscarinic and dopaminergic drugs on basal ganglia function.\r"

To elucidate mechanisms for these selective and discordant actions of aFGF and bFGF on cardiac muscle, chicken skeletal and cardiac alpha-actin promoter-driven reporter genes were introduced into neonatal rat cardiac myocytes by electroporation. Skeletal alpha-actin transcription was selectively stimulated by bFGF, whereas the cardiac alpha-actin promoter was unaffected. In contrast, aFGF suppressed both transfected alpha-actin genes. The differential regulation of skeletal alpha-actin transcription was equivalent with either purified or recombinant FGFs and was observed with 5' flanking sequences from either nucleotide -202 or -2000 to nucleotide -11. Positive and negative modulation of alpha-actin transcription by growth factors corresponded accurately to the endogenous genes in all permutations studied. These investigations provide a model for reciprocal control of gene transcription by aFGF vs. bFGF.\r"

In contrast, complex alternative splicing of TR beta mRNA occurs within the 5' UTR as well as possible alternative transcriptional start sites. As many as eight exons encoding mainly the 5' UTR are alternatively spliced, giving rise to at least two amino termini for each of the two TR beta proteins. The 5' UTR of transcripts from both TR alpha and TR beta genes contain multiple AUG sequences with short open reading frames suggesting translational control mechanisms might play a role in expression of TR genes.\r"

  ".W": "Latent infection of vascular cells with herpes-viruses may play a pathogenic role in the development of human atherosclerosis. In a previous study, we found that cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) infected with herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) became procoagulant, exemplified both by their enhanced assembly of the prothrombinase complex and by their inability to reduce adhesion of platelets. We now report two further procoagulant consequences of endothelial HSV infection: loss of surface thrombomodulin (TM) activity and induction of synthesis of tissue factor. Within 4 hr of infection of HUVECs, TM activity measured by thrombin-dependent protein C activation declined 21 +/- 3% (P less than 0.05) and by 18 hr, 48 +/- 5% (P less than 0.001). Similar significant TM decrements accompanied infection of bovine aortic endothelial cells. Identical TM loss was induced with HSV-2 infection but not with adenovirus infection. Decreased surface expression of TM antigen (measured by the specific binding of a polyclonal antibody to bovine TM) closely paralleled the loss of TM activity. As examined by Northern blotting, these losses apparently reflected rapid onset (within 4 hr of HSV infection) loss of mRNA for TM. In contrast, HSV infection induced a viral-dose-dependent increase in synthesis of tissue factor protein, adding to the procoagulant state. The results indicate that loss of endothelial protein-synthetic capacity is not a universal effect of HSV infection. We suggest that the procoagulant state induced by reduction in TM activity and amplified tissue factor activity accompanying HSV infection of endothelium could contribute to deposition of thrombi on atherosclerotic plaques and to the \"coagulant-necrosis\" state that characterizes HSV-infected mucocutaneous lesions.\r"

PD134308 caused a weak naloxone-reversible depression of the flexor reflex and a moderate antinociceptive effect in the hot plate test. However, PD134308 significantly potentiated the antinociceptive effect of morphine as well as its depressive effect on the flexor reflex. PD134308 and i.t. GAL synergistically depressed the flexor reflex, an effect that was reversed by naloxone. Finally, the magnitude and duration of the depression of the flexor reflex by morphine were synergistically increased by coadministering PD134308 and GAL i.t. The results demonstrated that a CCK antagonist directed to the central CCK type B receptor potentiates the analgesic effects of opioids and nonopioid drugs at the spinal level, thus supporting the notion that CCK in the central nervous system may be an endogenous, physiological opioid antagonist.\r"

  ".W": "We present a model of neural group interactions, which are projections from one neural network (network B) of McCulloch-Pitts neurons connected via a Hebbian rule, to another network (network A) of the same structure. We first consider the case in which the projecting network B is in a pattern different from the initial attracting state of network A. A critical projecting strength lambda c is found such that for lambda below this value there exists a noise threshold sigma lambda corresponding to each lambda. For the case where lambda less than lambda c and the noise level sigma less than sigma lambda, there are two possible retrievals, with different probabilities: the initial attracting state of network A and the projecting pattern. If lambda less than lambda c and sigma greater than sigma lambda, stable states of network A disappear. In the case lambda greater than lambda c, network A is pulled out of its initial basin of attraction and into that of the projecting pattern. This analysis provides a model for distraction. Second-order interactions reduce the distraction. When the projecting network B is in the same pattern as the initial attracting state of network A, the projection acts as an external reinforcement, which enables network A to retrieve in highly noisy conditions. Sharp noise thresholds for nonzero retrievals are shown to be eliminated by the projection. Higher-order connectivity improves the retrieval ability of the network. The second case serves as a model of concentration. We discuss the model of distraction and concentration (i) in connection with common experience of expectation of recognition and (ii) in connection with recent T-maze experiments on infant rats; finally, we suggest a refined version of the Bruner-Potter experiment to test our prediction of the disappearance of hysteresis.\r"

In this report we demonstrate that the shut-off of cellular protein synthesis by adenovirus is prevented in cells by treatment with the drug 2-aminopurine. Treatment with 2-aminopurine is shown to prevent suppression of cellular translation without disrupting the normal viral block in the transport of cellular mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. We show that viral suppression of cellular protein synthesis occurs concomitant with activation of the interferon-induced double-stranded RNA-activated inhibitor (DAI), a protein kinase, and phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2 alpha), but that prevention of host cell shut-off by 2-aminopurine occurs without a decrease in kinase activity or a dephosphorylation of eIF-2 alpha. Results are presented that indicate that activation of DAI kinase and phosphorylation of eIF-2 alpha may be required but are not sufficient to achieve inhibition of cellular protein synthesis during adenovirus infection. We suggest that other events, in particular the modification of additional initiation factors, are likely involved in viral inhibition of cellular translation.\r"

The silk fiber has been proposed to consist of pseudocrystalline regions of antiparallel beta-sheet interspersed with elastic amorphous segments. The repetitive sequence of a fibroin protein from major ampullate silk of the spider Nephila clavipes was determined from a partial cDNA clone. The repeating unit is a maximum of 34 amino acids long and is not rigidly conserved. The repeat unit is composed of three different segments: (i) a 6 amino acid segment that is conserved in sequence but has deletions of 3 or 6 amino acids in many of the repeats; (ii) a 13 amino acid segment dominated by a polyalanine sequence of 5-7 residues; (iii) a 15 amino acid, highly conserved segment. The latter is predominantly a Gly-Gly-Xaa repeat with Xaa being alanine, tyrosine, leucine, or glutamine. The codon usage for this DNA is highly selective, avoiding the use of cytosine or guanine in the third position. A model for the physical properties of fiber formation, strength, and elasticity, based on this repetitive protein sequence, is presented.\r"

We conclude that the long arm of the human X chromosome represents a highly conserved region that formed part of the X chromosome in a mammalian ancestor at least 150 million years ago. Since three of these genes are located on the long arm of the platypus X chromosome, which is G-band homologous to the Y chromosome and apparently exempt from X chromosome inactivation, the conservation of this region has evidently not depended on isolation by X-Y chromosome differentiation and X chromosome inactivation.\r"

Since expression of V beta 8.1 is known to correlate with reactivity of CD4+CD8- T cells to minor lymphocyte-stimulating locus 1a (Mls-1a), we expected to induce tolerance in most CD4+CD8- T cells in V beta 8.1 transgenic mice of the Mls-1a allele. In one line of Mls-1b V beta 8.1 transgenic mice, the V beta 8.1 TCR was expressed on greater than 98% of mature T cells and their response to Mls-1a was highly enriched. In Mls-1a V beta 8.1 transgenic mice, CD4+CD8- T cells in these mice were severely reduced among both peripheral T cells and thymocytes. However, the deletion of these cells was not complete, and most of the residual CD4+CD8- mature T cells still expressed normal densities of V beta 8.1 TCR. The residual CD4+CD8- T cells did not respond to Mls-1a but were still able to proliferate in response to other stimuli via the TCR. Interestingly, CD4+CD8- V beta 8.1+ T-cell clones isolated from Mls-1a V beta 8.1 transgenic mice could respond to Mls-1a. We suggest that these types of T cells escape clonal deletion in the thymus.\r"

In this study, we demonstrate the induction of HLA-DR expression on human hepatoma cell lines transfected with HBV DNA sequences. The HBV X gene alone was capable of inducing HLA-DR expression. This induction correlated with elevated HLA-DR RNA, and this resulted directly from transcriptional trans-activation of the HLA-DR gene by the HBV X protein. These studies suggest that the HBV X protein can regulate the expression of HLA-DR and thus raise the possibility of participation by the X gene in the immunopathogenesis of HBV infection.\r"

A defect in type I collagen production is associated with dominant-acting morphological and functional defects in mineralized and nonmineralized connective tissue and with progressive hearing loss. The model provides an opportunity to investigate the effect of a reduced amount of type I collagen on the structure and integrity of extracellular matrix.

  ".W": "Infection of mononuclear cells by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) begins with binding of the viral envelope glycoprotein, gp120, to its receptor, CD4. CD4 contains four extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, the first of which (V1) is sufficient for HIV binding. V1 contains three sequences homologous to the antigen-complementarity-determining regions (CDR1 to -3) of immunoglobulin variable domains. While all three immunoglobulin CDRs are involved in antigen binding, only amino acids within and flanking the CDR2-like region of CD4 have been shown previously to be involved in gp120 binding. To investigate whether other regions in V1 take part in gp120 binding, we substituted alanine for each of 64 amino acids, including all of the hydrophilic residues in this domain. Mutations at four locations outside the CDR2-like sequence (amino acids 29, 59-64, 77-81, and 85) markedly affected gp120 binding, but not the overall structure of V1 as probed with eight conformationally sensitive monoclonal antibodies. Thus, the gp120-binding site of CD4 is not limited to the CDR2-like sequence and consists of several discontinuous segments. Several amino acids were identified that are critical for the conformation of V1; the importance of these residues suggests some differences in the folding of this domain compared to immunoglobulin variable domains. Three amino acid substitutions were found that increase the affinity for gp120 significantly (1.7- to 2-fold individually and 4.2-fold when combined), suggesting that it may be possible to improve the HIV-blocking ability of CD4-based molecules by increasing their gp120 binding affinity.\r"

  ".U": "90384967\r", 
  ".W": "The resistance of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs is a major obstacle to successful cancer chemotherapy. In human cells, expression of the MDR1 gene, encoding a transmembrane efflux pump (P-glycoprotein), leads to decreased intracellular accumulation and resistance to a variety of lipophilic drugs (multidrug resistance; MDR). The levels of MDR in cell lines selected in vitro have been shown to correlate with the steady-state levels of MDR1 mRNA and P-glycoprotein. In cells with a severalfold increase in cellular drug resistance, MDR1 expression levels are close to the limits of detection by conventional assays. MDR1 expression has been frequently observed in human tumors after chemotherapy and in some but not all types of clinically refractory tumors untreated with chemotherapeutic drugs. We have devised a highly sensitive, specific, and quantitative protocol for measuring the levels of MDR1 mRNA in clinical samples, based on the polymerase chain reaction. We have used this assay to measure MDR1 gene expression in MDR cell lines and greater than 300 normal tissues, tumor-derived cell lines, and clinical specimens of untreated tumors of the types in which MDR1 expression was rarely observed by standard assays. Low levels of MDR1 expression were found by polymerase chain reaction in most solid tumors and leukemias tested. The frequency of samples without detectable MDR1 expression varied among different types of tumors; MDR1-negative samples were most common among tumor types known to be relatively responsive to chemotherapy.\r"

By using antigenic peptides labeled either with a hapten or with fluorescein, complexes formed in vitro between I-Ad and antigenic peptides were detected by Western blot analysis with an antibody recognizing the hapten 7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole and by scanning gels for fluorescence emitted by fluoresceinated peptide. Both techniques reveal that Ova-(323-339) binds not only to I-Ad alpha/beta heterodimers and separated alpha and beta chains but also to complexes of higher molecular mass. Additional analysis shows that one of these additional complexes contains I-Ad heterodimers, antigenic peptides, and also invariant chain. To explore the physiological role of these complexes, cells were incubated with haptenated peptide and the I-Ad-peptide complexes formed in vivo were purified by affinity chromatography using hapten-specific antibody. The complexes formed migrate with a significantly higher apparent molecular mass than the alpha/beta heterodimers. A band at 180 kDa contained the alpha/beta heterodimer, the antigenic peptide, and the invariant chain. These results show that in vivo high molecular mass complexes formed by the I-Ad heterodimer and the invariant chain bind antigenic peptides.\r"

  ".W": "A partially dominant mutation exhibiting increased tolerance to cyclohexanedione and aryloxyphenoxypropionate herbicides was isolated by exposing susceptible maize (Zea mays) tissue cultures to increasingly inhibitory concentrations of sethoxydim (a cyclohexanedione). The selected tissue culture (S2) was greater than 40-fold more tolerant to sethoxydim and 20-fold more tolerant to haloxyfop (an aryloxyphenoxypropionate) than the nonselected wild-type tissue culture. Regenerated S2 plants were heterozygous for the mutant allele and exhibited a high-level, but not complete, tolerance to both herbicides. Homozygous mutant families derived by self-pollinating the regenerated S2 plants exhibited no injury after treatment with 0.8 kg of sethoxydim per ha, which was greater than 16-fold the rate lethal to wild-type plants. Acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase; EC 6.4.1.2) is the target enzyme of cyclohexanedione and aryloxyphenoxypropionate herbicides. ACCase activities of the nonselected wild-type and homozygous mutant seedlings were similar in the absence of herbicide. ACCase activity from homozygous tolerant plants required greater than 100-fold more sethoxydim and 16-fold more haloxyfop for 50% inhibition than ACCase from wild-type plants. These results indicate that tolerance to sethoxydim and haloxyfop is controlled by a partially dominant nuclear mutation encoding a herbicide-insensitive alteration in maize ACCase.\r"

Here we describe the use of KMnO4 to analyze the contacts between steroid hormone receptors and thymines within a hormone responsive element. Although several pyrimidine residues are highly conserved among different receptor binding sites their participation in sequence recognition has not been directly studied. Using an interference procedure based on selective modification of the thymine ring by KMnO4, we detect intimate contacts between the glucocorticoid or progesterone receptors and three thymine residues within the promoter distal receptor binding site of the mouse mammary tumor virus (-190/-160). A comparison of binding data obtained with oligonucleotides containing desoxyuridine, bromodeoxyuridine, cytosine, or 5'-methylcytosine instead of thymines demonstrates that the methyl group of those three thymines contributes to the free energy of binding. This simple method could be of general utility for the study of sequence-specific protein-DNA interactions.\r"

  ".W": "Glutathione, an essential cellular antioxidant required for mitochondrial function, is not synthesized by mitochondria but is imported from the cytosol. Rat liver mitochondria have a multicomponent system that underlies the remarkable ability of mitochondria to take up and retain glutathione. At external glutathione levels of less than 1 mM, glutathione is transported into the mitochondrial matrix by a high-affinity component (Km, approximately 60 microM; V max, approximately 0.5 nmol/min per mg of protein), which is saturated at levels of 1-2 mM and stimulated by ATP. Another component has lower affinity (Km, approximately 5.4 mM; Vmax, approximately 5.9 nmol/min per mg of protein) and is stimulated by ATP and ADP. Both components are inhibited by carbonylcyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP), glutamate, and ophthalmic acid. Increase of extramitochondrial glutathione promotes uptake and exchange; the intermembranous space seems to function as a recovery zone that promotes efficient recycling of matrix glutathione. The findings are in accord with in vivo data showing that (i) rapid exchange occurs between mitochondrial and cytosolic glutathione, (ii) lowering of cytosolic glutathione levels (produced by administration of buthionine sulfoximine) decreases export of glutathione from mitochondria to cytosol, and (iii) administration of glutathione esters increases glutathione levels in mitochondria more than those in the cytosol.\r"

The number of beta III isoforms (charge variants) gradually increases from one in embryonic brain to seven in adult brain. All of the charge heterogeneity is due to posttranslationally modified sites located within the extreme C-terminal region of the beta III polypeptide. One beta III isoform is present in testis, the only other tissue in which this isotype is expressed. The testis beta III isoform cofocuses with the earliest-appearing embryonic brain beta III charge variant. Our results indicate that the posttranslational modifications of beta III are developmentally regulated, occur at more than one site, and are neuron-specific. The location of these modifications within the extreme C-terminal domain suggests that their function is to modulate the interaction of tubulin with microtubule-associated proteins.\r"

This pattern of connectivity mimics that of primary visual cortex. The model is studied in the context of processing visual stimuli that are coded for orientation. We compare our theoretical results with recent experimental evidence on coherent oscillatory activity in the cat visual cortex. The computational capabilities of the model for performing discrimination and segmentation tasks are demonstrated.\r"

We have constructed a transgene in which 6.5 kilobases of ZP3 gene 5'-flanking sequence is fused to the coding region of the firefly luciferase gene, and we have generated four independent lines of transgenic mice. In these animals, the transgene is expressed exclusively in ovaries. Furthermore, within ovaries, expression is confined to growing oocytes, and luciferase activity can be detected by assaying individual, isolated oocytes. The pattern of firefly luciferase expression during oocyte growth is similar to that observed in previous studies of ZP3 expression during oogenesis in mice. Observations reported here strongly suggest that cis-acting elements present in the ZP3 gene 5'-flanking region regulate oocyte-specific and, therefore, sex-specific expression of the sperm receptor gene during mouse development. They also suggest that such elements can be used to direct expression of cloned genes specifically to oocytes of transgenic mice and to evaluate the effects of such expression on various aspects of early mammalian development.\r"

  ".U": "90384980\r", 
  ".W": "Expression of P-glycoprotein, encoded by the human MDR1 gene, results in cross-resistance to many lipophilic cytotoxic drugs (multidrug resistance). P-glycoprotein is believed to function as an energy-dependent efflux pump that is responsible for decreased drug accumulation in multidrug-resistant cells. Previous work showed that preferential resistance to colchicine in a colchicine-selected multidrug-resistant cell line was caused by spontaneous mutations in the MDR1 gene that resulted in a Gly-185----Val-185 substitution in P-glycoprotein. We have now compared transfectant cell lines expressing either the wild-type Gly-185 or the mutant Val-185 P-glycoprotein with regard to their levels of resistance to and accumulation and binding of different drugs. In cells expressing the mutant protein, increased resistance to colchicine and decreased resistance to vinblastine correlated with a decreased accumulation of colchicine and increased accumulation of vinblastine. Expression of the mutant P-glycoprotein also resulted in significantly increased resistance to epipodophyllotoxin and decreased resistance to vincristine and actinomycin D; smaller changes in resistance were observed for several other drugs. Unexpectedly, the mutant P-glycoprotein showed increased binding of photoactive analogs of vinblastine and verapamil and the photoactive compound azidopine and decreased binding of a photoactive colchicine analog. These results suggest that the Gly-185----Val-185 substitution affects not the initial drug-binding site of P-glycoprotein but another site, associated with the release of P-glycoprotein-bound drugs to the outside of the cell.\r"

Normal and malignant epithelial cells are also F19-. The present immunohistochemical study describes induction of F19 in the reactive mesenchyme of epithelial tumors. F19+ fibroblasts were found in primary and metastatic carcinomas, including colorectal (18 of 18 cases studied), breast (14/14), ovarian (21/21), bladder (9/10), and lung carcinomas (13/13). In contrast, the stroma of benign colorectal adenomas, fibrocystic disease and fibroadenomas of breast, benign prostate hyperplasia, in situ bladder carcinomas, and benign ovarian tumors showed no or only moderate numbers of F19+ fibroblasts. Analysis of dermal incision wounds revealed that F19 is strongly induced during scar formation. Comparison of F19 with the extracellular matrix protein tenascin, a putative marker of tumor mesenchyme, showed a cellular staining pattern for F19 vs. the extracellular matrix pattern for tenascin and widespread expression of tenascin in F19- normal tissues and benign tumors. Our results suggest that the F19+ phenotype correlates with specialized fibroblast functions in wound healing and malignant tumor growth. Because of its abundance in tumor mesenchyme, F19 may serve as a target for antibodies labeled with radioisotopes or toxic agents, or inflammatogenic antibodies, in carcinoma patients.\r"

Sensitivity to DTX was screened by using a replica plate assay. The purified toxin-sensitive mouse cells were characterized with respect to their ability to bind, internalize, and translocate DTX into the cytosol. In contrast to the L-M(TK-) cells, these DTX-sensitive mouse cells were able to bind and internalize radioiodinated toxin into intracellular vesicles at 37 degrees C. Specific binding of radioiodinated toxin to their cell surface (at 4 degrees C) could not be demonstrated. However, the following evidence for functional receptors capable of binding DTX was obtained: (i) when the toxin-sensitive mouse cells were first allowed to bind DTX at 4 degrees C, followed by washing the cells and shifting the temperature to 37 degrees C (allowing cell surface-bound toxin to enter the cells), the cells were killed; (ii) when cells with surface-bound DTX were exposed briefly to an acidic medium (allowing the toxin to penetrate the plasma membrane directly), protein synthesis was inhibited; and (iii) when cells were incubated with DTX in the presence of the CRM 197, a nontoxic form of DTX with binding properties similar to native DTX, the cytotoxic effect of DTX was markedly decreased. The results demonstrate that the toxin-sensitive mouse cells are killed by a mechanism similar to that observed in naturally occurring toxin-sensitive cell lines. The data further suggest that the transfected mouse cells express functional receptors for DTX.\r"

In this study, we developed a new coculture system to determine the origin of osteoclasts. When relatively small numbers of mononuclear cells (10(3)-10(5) cells per well) obtained from mouse bone marrow, spleen, thymus, or peripheral blood were cultured for 12 days on the ST2 cell layers, they formed colonies with a linear relationship between the number of colonies formed and the number of hemopoietic cells inoculated. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAPase)-positive mononuclear and multinucleated cells appeared in the colonies (TRAPase-positive colonies) in response to 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and dexamethasone. When hemopoietic cells suspended in a collagen-gel solution were cultured on the ST2 cell layers to prevent their movement, TRAPase-positive colonies were similarly formed, indicating that each colony originated from a single cell. All of the colonies consisted of nonspecific esterase-positive cells. The monocyte-depleted population prepared from peripheral blood failed to form colonies, whereas the monocyte-enriched population produced a large number of TRAPase-positive colonies. In addition, alveolar macrophages formed TRAPase-positive colonies most efficiently on the ST2 cell layers in the presence of the two hormones. Salmon 125I-labeled calcitonin specifically bound to the TRAPase-positive cells. Resorption lacunae were formed on dentine slices on which cocultures were performed. When direct contact between the peripheral blood cells and the ST2 cells was inhibited by a collagen-gel sheet, no TRAPase-positive cells were formed. These results indicate that osteoclasts are also derived from the mature monocytes and macrophages when a suitable microenvironment is provided by bone marrow-derived stromal cells.\r"

  ".W": "A tetraphenylporphyrin bearing four dicarbollide ([B9C2H11]-) cages linked to the o-phenyl ring positions by anilide bonds, known as boronated tetraphenylporphyrin (BTPP), has been synthesized in excellent yield from tetra-(o-aminophenyl) porphyrin and carborane carbonyl chloride followed by base-assisted cage opening and ion exchange to give the highly water-soluble potassium salt. Preliminary studies showed that BTPP accumulates in liver and in a syngeneic ovarian carcinoma, but not in normal brain parenchyma, of mice infused with BTPP subcutaneously for 6 or 7 days via surgically implanted osmotic minipumps. In this study, the uptake of boron was measured in human gliomas xenografted subcutaneously to athymic nude mice in which BTPP was infused intraperitoneally or subcutaneously or both for 3 or 7 days by using similar minipumps. Immunocompetent mice bearing a syngeneic ovarian carcinoma were similarly infused to provide comparative data. Bulk concentrations of boron up to 18 micrograms/g of glioma and up to 45 micrograms/g of carcinoma were observed when up to 102 micrograms/g of tissue was present in the liver after 7 days of BTPP infusion. Glioma boron concentrations were increased by approximately 80% on the average (up to 33 micrograms/g) when correspondingly greater amounts of BTPP were infused in only 3 days. Cell counts and chemical tests on blood samples from individual mice indicate that BTPP causes moderate hepatotoxicity and thrombocytopenia. This hepatohematic toxicity syndrome should be taken into account if BTPP or a similar agent is used for boron neutron-capture therapy (BNCT) of human malignancies.\r"

  ".W": "A sequence homology has been noted between the carboxyl quarter of the catalytic gamma subunit of phosphorylase kinase and the region of troponin I coded by exon VII. Because this portion of troponin I contains the inhibitory region that interacts with actin and troponin C, we have examined whether the gamma subunit of phosphorylase kinase can functionally mimic troponin I by also interacting with actin and troponin C. We have found that troponin C not only activates the isolated gamma subunit of phosphorylase kinase but also binds with approximately the same affinity as calmodulin. Although actin had no effect on the activity of the gamma subunit alone, it did inhibit the activity of gamma-calmodulin and gamma-troponin C complexes. Conversely, the gamma subunit was able to inhibit actomyosin ATPase in a process that could be overcome by calmodulin. These results suggest that actin and calmodulin (or troponin C) compete for binding to the gamma subunit. Moreover, the structural and functional similarities between the gamma subunit and troponin I suggest that the gamma subunit of phosphorylase kinase may have evolved from the fusion of a protein kinase protogene with a progenitor of exon VII of troponin I.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies indicated that human and bovine factor VII exhibit 71% amino acid sequence identity. In the present study, competition binding experiments revealed that the interaction of human factor VII with cell-surface human tissue factor was not inhibited by 100-fold molar excess of bovine factor VII. This finding indicated that bovine and human factor VII are not structurally homologous in the region(s) where human factor VII interacts with human tissue factor. On this premise, we synthesized three peptides corresponding to regions of human factor VII that exhibited marked structural dissimilarity to bovine factor VII; these regions of dissimilarity included residues 195-206, 263-274, and 314-326. Peptide 195-206 inhibited the interaction of factor VII with cell-surface tissue factor and the activation of factor X by a complex of factor VIIa and tissue factor half-maximally at concentrations of 1-2 mM. A structurally rearranged form of peptide 195-206 containing an aspartimide residue inhibited these reactions half-maximally at concentrations of 250-300 microM. In contrast, neither peptide 263-274 nor peptide 314-326, at 2 mM concentration, significantly affected either factor VIIa interaction with tissue factor or factor VIIa-mediated activation of factor X. Our data provide presumptive evidence that residues 195-206 of human factor VII are involved in the interaction of human factor VII with the extracellular domain of human tissue factor apoprotein.\r"

Biochemical and genetic data indicate that the five LDH isozymes are tetramers that arise from random association of the products of two Ldh loci. To investigate this system, cDNA clones of LDH were isolated from a lambda gt11 cDNA library derived from hypoxically treated barley roots. The library was screened with antiserum raised against barley LDH purified approximately 3000-fold by an improved three-step procedure. Immunopositive clones were rescreened with a cDNA probe synthesized by the polymerase chain reaction using primers modeled from the amino acid sequences of two tryptic LDH peptides. Two types of LDH clones were found. Nucleotide sequence analysis of one representative insert of each type (respectively, 1305 and 1166 base pairs) revealed open reading frames encoding 10 peptide fragments of LDH. The 1305-base-pair insert included the entire coding region of a 356-residue LDH monomer. The nucleotide sequences of the two LDH cDNAs were 92% identical in the coding region, but highly divergent in the 3' noncoding region, and thus probably correspond to the two postulated Ldh loci. The deduced amino acid sequences of the two barley LDHs were 96% identical to each other and very similar to those from vertebrate and bacterial LDHs. RNA blot hybridization showed a single mRNA band of 1.5 kilobases whose level rose about 8-fold in roots during hypoxic induction, as did the level of translatable LDH message.\r"

Analysis of recombination events in this region has produced contradictory locations for HD. One possible location is in the region distal to the D4S90 marker, which is located within 300 kilobases of the telomere. Other crossover events predict a more centromeric position for HD. Here we analyze the telomeric region of 4p in detail. Cloned DNA segments were derived from this region by utilizing a radiation-induced somatic cell hybrid as a source of DNA combined with preparative pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to enrich for the telomeric fraction. Additional DNA was obtained by using the cloned segments as multiple start points for cosmid walks. This strategy proved to be an effective method for cloning 250 kilobases of DNA in the region telomeric to D4S90. Hybridization analysis with the cloned DNA did not provide any evidence for the presence of rearrangements of 100 base pairs or greater in the DNA of individuals affected with HD. We also found no change in the size or structure of the 4p telomere in these samples.\r"

The amino acid sequence derived from the hMac-2 cDNA indicates that the protein is evolutionarily highly conserved, with 85% of its amino acid residues being similar to those in the murine homolog. This conservation is especially marked in the carboxyl-terminal lectin domain. The amino-terminal half of the protein is less conserved but still contains the repetitive proline-glycine-rich motif seen in the mouse protein. hMac-2 synthesized in vitro is recognized by the M3/38 monoclonal antibody to Mac-2 and binds to the desialylated glycoprotein asialofetuin and to laminin, a major component of basement membranes. These findings are discussed in the context of the potential functions of hMac-2.\r"

  ".W": "Previously, using flow cytometric resonance energy transfer and lateral diffusion measurements, we demonstrated that a 95-kDa protein identified by two monoclonal antibodies (OKT27 and OKT27b) interacts physically with the 55-kDa alpha protein of the high-affinity interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor. In the present study, this 95-kDa protein (p95) was purified and amino acid sequence data were obtained that showed strong homology to the human intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1). The identity of the p95 protein with ICAM-1 was confirmed by sequential immunoprecipitations using OKT27 and an antibody, WEHI-CAM-1, that is directed toward ICAM-1. We confirmed the physical proximity of p95/ICAM-1 to the IL-2 receptor alpha subunit by demonstrating that radiolabeled IL-2 could be cross-linked to this protein expressed on activated T cells. In functional studies, the antibodies OKT27 and OKT27b inhibited T-cell proliferative responses to OKT3, to soluble antigen, and to heterologous cells (mixed lymphocyte reaction). However, these antibodies did not inhibit IL-2-induced proliferation of an IL-2-dependent T-cell line. Taken together with our previous observations, the present studies suggest that ICAM-1 is in proximity and interacts physically with the high-affinity IL-2 receptor. The association of ICAM-1 with the IL-2 receptor may facilitate the paracrine IL-2-mediated stimulation of T cells expressing IL-2 receptors by augmenting homotypic T-T-cell interaction, by receptor-directed focusing of IL-2 release by helper T cells, and by focusing IL-2 receptors of the physically linked cells to the site of lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1-ICAM-1-IL-2 receptor interaction.\r"

Five archival specimens of Dermacentor variabilis (dog tick) from the same collection and 118 Ixodes specimens from other endemic and nonendemic sites were negative.

The functional significance of these insertions were determined by site-directed mutagenesis. Deletion of the 50-amino acid tract (residues 317 to 366) had no effect on TSH binding or on TSH and thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) biological activities. In contrast, either deletion or substitution of the eight-amino acid region (residues 38 to 45) abolished these activities. This eight-amino acid tract near the amino terminus of the TSH receptor appears to be an important site of interaction for both TSH and TSI.\r"

To test this hypothesis, the effects of lesions of the subthalamic nucleus were evaluated in monkeys rendered parkinsonian by treatment with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). The lesions reduced all of the major motor disturbances in the contralateral limbs, including akinesia, rigidity, and tremor.

Such determinative interactions have been difficult to characterize fully without knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved. Mutations of Drosophila and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have been isolated that define a family of related gene products involved in similar types of cellular inductions. One of these genes, the Notch gene from Drosophila, is involved with cell fate choices in the neurogenic region of the blastoderm, in the developing nervous system, and in the eye-antennal imaginal disc. Complementary DNA clones were isolated from Xenopus embryos with Notch DNA in order to investigate whether cell-cell interactions in vertebrate embryos also depend on Notch-like molecules. This approach identified a Xenopus molecule, Xotch, which is remarkably similar to Drosophila Notch in both structure and developmental expression.\r"

The electric phenotypes of calmodulin mutants of Paramecium have suggested that the protein may regulate some calcium-dependent ion channels. Calcium-dependent sodium single channels in excised patches of the plasma membrane from Paramecium were identified, and their activity was shown to decrease after brief exposure to submicromolar concentrations of calcium. Channel activity was restored to these inactivated patches by adding calmodulin that was isolated from Paramecium to the cytoplasmic surface. This restoration of channel activity did not require adenosine triphosphate and therefore, probably resulted from direct binding of calmodulin, either to the sodium channel itself or to a channel regulator that was associated with the patch membrane.\r"

We report here the cases of six adults with sickle cell disease, pneumococcal sepsis, and meningitis. Five patients were male and one was female. Their ages ranged from 18 to 34 years (mean, 25.7 years). Five patients had the SS and one had the SC hemoglobin phenotype. Only one patient had received pneumococcal vaccine (14 valent). This vaccine did not protect against the pneumococcal serotype causing his infection. All patients had high fever (mean, 39.8 degrees C [103.7 degrees F]) on admission; five had generalized weakness and four had neck stiffness. Leukocyte counts were greater than 30,000/mm3 in all patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated from the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid in all patients. The cerebrospinal fluid showed pleocytosis in six patients, an elevated protein level in five, and hypoglycorrhachia in two. Complications included renal failure in four patients, disseminated intravascular coagulation in one, and seizures in another. Two patients died. Pneumococcal sepsis and meningitis are uncommon in adults with sickle cell disease, but they carry a high morbidity and mortality. Wider use of the new 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine in these patients is recommended.\r"

Proponents find that monthly breast self-examination leads to earlier diagnosis and treatment, and to improved prognosis. Only one third of women are performing monthly breast self-examination, and most do so with inadequate technique and poor comprehension. They are unable to distinguish normal from abnormal findings, and corrective measures are necessary. Health professionals, the best source of patient instruction, should periodically recheck the patient's performance. The technique taught should be uniform and uncomplicated. A simple way to demonstrate common benign and malignant lesions is presented to improve the patient's understanding, skill, and confidence.\r"

Intraoperative hemorrhage is also a major problem in this patient group, and it has been suggested that preoperative splenic arterial occlusion offers a means to diminish intraoperative blood loss. In order to assess the benefit of preoperative control of arterial inflow on intraoperative blood loss, we reviewed retrospectively 16 cases of chronic pancreatitis and associated splenic vein occlusion in patients who had splenectomy. There was a significant difference in estimated intraoperative blood loss in the two patient groups (P less than .05). Preoperative inflow control was obtained with a wedge balloon catheter or autologous clot embolization with an estimated mean blood loss of 1771 mL in seven patients. Nine patients had splenectomy without inflow control, with a mean estimated intraoperative blood loss of 3332 mL. The mean difference was 1560 mL. Preoperative control of splenic artery inflow can diminish intraoperative blood loss during splenectomy in the presence of splenic vein occlusion associated with chronic pancreatitis.\r"

Previous procedures included gastrostomy (18), Nissen fundoplication (12), ventriculoperitoneal shunt (9), omphalocele (4), paraesophageal hernia (3), necrotizing enterocolitis (2), abscess drainage (2), intestinal atresia (2), and abdominal burn (1). The three complications encountered were a bronchopleural fistula, esophageal leak, and small bowel obstruction. Of five deaths, one was related to operation. The remaining patients did not have recurrent reflux. Transthoracic fundoplication after previous abdominal surgery is effective and rapid, and it has a relatively low complication rate in high-risk patients. This approach avoids reentry into the abdominal cavity and allows precise repair.\r"

Urine collected just before, at the midpoint of, and immediately after the race was analyzed for creatinine by an automated chemistry analyzer, pack method, and for microalbumin by radioimmunoassay. By midrace, the urinary albumin-creatinine ratio increased from the prerace mean +/- SEM of 3.5 +/- 0.5 to 38.3 +/- 11.7 mg/g. The ratio then declined to 12.5 +/- 2.7 mg/g by the end of the race (P less than .04). Similarly, the urinary albumin level increased significantly from 5.9 +/- 0.7 to 80.5 +/- 26.8 micrograms/mL by midrace, followed by a decline to 39.2 +/- 12.9 micrograms/mL. The initial increase in albuminuria was expected and reflects the increase in exercise-induced cardiac output and glomerular permeability. The subsequent decline in albuminuria and albumin-creatinine ratio, despite continued exercise, was unexpected and indicates a decrease in glomerular permeability. Further study is warranted to determine the mechanism of this apparently protective renal response to prolonged exercise.\r"

This sustained increase leads to accelerated rates of cholesterol deposition in the coronary arteries and to the development of tendon xanthomas. To assess whether hypolipidemic therapy with lovastatin, alone and in combination therapy with colestipol hydrochloride or nicotinic acid, results in regression of lipid deposits in the tendons of these patients, we have measured Achilles tendon diameters by xeroradiography before and after treatment. In 20 patients treated for a mean of 43 months (during which time plasma cholesterol concentrations decreased from 430 to 247 mg/dL), the diameter of both the left and right Achilles tendons measured at three different locations decreased by 0.55 to 1.5 mm. Larger reductions were seen in the tendons of seven of these patients who were treated for a mean of 64 months and whose mean concentrations of cholesterol fell from 488 to 279 mg/dL. We conclude that effective long-term hypolipidemic therapy leads to diminution in the size of Achilles tendon xanthomas in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and that such therapy is associated with mobilization of tissue stores of cholesterol in these patients.\r"

The pseudocyst was treated successfully by repeated percutaneous aspiration, and removal of the aortic prosthesis was not required. Although less successful than operative drainage, percutaneous approaches to pancreatic pseudocysts are an important option for patients who are poor surgical candidates.\r"

A detailed interview and HIV serologic testing were conducted among PDAs hospitalized at Detroit Receiving Hospital for reasons unrelated to HIV infection. The study involved 22 seropositive (17 men, 5 women) and 52 seronegative (34 men, 18 women) drug abusers in Detroit, Michigan, an area of relatively low HIV prevalence. The interviews included inquiries regarding risk factors such as duration of drug abuse, visits to \"shooting galleries,\" use of \"hit men,\" needle sharing, sterile injection techniques, use of \"street\" antibiotics, promiscuity, visits to prostitutes, homosexuality, history of sexually transmitted diseases, and history of travel to areas of high HIV prevalence. A strong association was noted between the number of risk factors present and HIV seropositivity. The presence of any three or more risk factors was significantly associated (P less than .05) with seropositivity. Awareness of epidemiologic risk factors for HIV infection among PDAs in a low-prevalence area is useful in identification of seropositive drug abusers and is crucial in designing educational interventional strategies to interrupt viral transmission.\r"

Nonunion or malunion increases the risk of developing neurologic complications because of the resulting atlanto-axial instability. Posterior decompression has generally been the surgical solution to myelopathy at this level. Two patients with cervical myelopathy due to displaced ununited dens fractures were treated with posterior fossa decompression and high cervical laminectomy. Both patients deteriorated after the surgery. Most of their neurologic deficits finally resolved after microsurgical transoral decompression (by resection of the dens). In those patients in whom atlanto-axial instability causes primarily anterior compression of the neuraxis, especially by a bony lesion, decompression posteriorly may not achieve the desired effect, and, instead, may cause a deterioration in the patient's condition. Anterior atlanto-axial subluxation effectively lengthens the bony spinal canal, which results in stretching of the relatively inelastic spinal cord over the bony deformity. If indirect methods of reduction fail to relieve the condition, then anterior transoral decompression is recommended.\r"

This was helpful for localization in planning of surgical approaches. In the patient with previous Pott's disease, spinal cord compression was detected using MRI, which showed no evidence of active tuberculosis. Two case reports are offered to show the benefit of using MRI as a diagnostic technique in preoperative evaluation and as a method of monitoring treatment response of tuberculous spondylitis. The third case shows the benefit of using MRI to rule out active infection and to detect other forms of spinal pathology.\r"

The purpose of this report is to review mechanisms by which transient neurologic deficits occur in the absence of bony disruption. The authors describe four cases in which transient neurologic deficits occurred after blunt trauma to the thoracic or lumbar spine. Their experience indicates that, when neurologic deficits after trauma occur without fracture or dislocation, there is often an underlying structural susceptibility of the axial skeleton.\r"

A total of 12 fresh frozen cadaver spines were tested intact, after burst fracture was created and application of a fixation device (six each), and after six serial transections of posterior ligaments and bony structures. Spines were loaded to a maximum of 10 N-m in flexion, extension, left and right lateral bending, and clockwise and counter-clockwise rotation. Results indicate that both systems reduce spinal flexibility in flexion, extension, and lateral bend loading when used to reduce and fix a classic burst fracture without posterior disruption. No decrease in flexibility was found in axial rotation for either device. After transection of all posterior elements, the I-Plate construct became much more flexible than the intact spine in flexion, extension, and axial rotation loading. The internal fixator construct retained more stability than the I-Plate construct after transection of posterior elements in flexion and extension loading, but was considerably more flexible than the intact spine in axial rotation loading. The results imply that the posterior internal fixator provides much better stabilization than the anterior I-Plate for those cases in which there is a large amount of posterior disruption in addition to an anterior burst injury. Neither device provides extensive support in axial rotation loading.\r"

Eighty-five percent of the patients received a classification of good to excellent regarding back pain and 90% returned to their preinjury occupation. Of significance, of 75 lumbar facets traversed by rods but not fused, only two were classified as \"closed\" or autofused. It remains to be seen if some pedicular systems are superior to this technique in trained hands.

An additional 23 patients had chronic pain, or could not date the onset of their symptoms. Unlike previous studies, events that occurred after the onset of back pain and thus could have been a consequence of the back pain were excluded. Before onset of back pain there was a significant excess of adverse life events in those with definite onset back pain of uncertain cause, compared with those with a specific diagnosis: there was no such excess in the periods before referral and attendance at the clinic. Diagnosable psychiatric illness was virtually confined to those with chronic pain. These findings indicate that stress, but not psychiatric illness, is involved in the onset of back pain. Further research is now required to ascertain whether those patients who have many psychiatric symptoms at the time of onset are those who develop chronic pain.\r"

Each test involved the measurement of maximum voluntary isometric torque at 72 degrees, 60 degrees, 48 degrees, 36 degrees, 24 degrees, 12 degrees, and 0 degrees of lumbar flexion. After the pretraining tests, subjects were randomly stratified to groups that trained with variable resistance dynamic exercise every other week (1X/2 weeks, n = 19), once per week (1X/week, n = 22), twice per week (2X/week, n = 23) or three times per week (3X/week, n = 21); a group that trained isometrically once per week (n = 14); or a control group that did not train (n = 15). Analysis of covariance showed that all training groups improved their ability to generate isometric torque at each angle measured when compared with controls (P less than 0.05). There was no statistical difference in adjusted posttraining isometric torques among the groups that trained (P greater than 0.05), but dynamic training weight increased to a lesser extent (P less than 0.08) for the 1X/2 weeks group (26.6%) than for the groups that trained 1X/week, 2X/week, and 3X/week (37.2 to 41.4%). These data indicate that a training frequency as low as 1X/week provides an effective training stimulus for the development of lumbar extension strength. Improvements in strength noted after isometric training suggest that isometric exercise provides an effective alternative for developing lumbar strength.\r"

ANOVA was used to test the hypotheses that traction and time in traction were significantly related to stature increase. Traction had significant effects on stature. The mean stature increase was 8.94 mm after 25 minutes traction compared with 3.33 mm after 25 minutes crook lying. Time in traction also had significant effects on stature increase which was most rapid during the first 15 minutes of traction. These findings can be related to the use of stature measurement as an index of spinal loading and the possible implications for treatment. However, since only healthy, young subjects were used and only one magnitude of traction was applied, the findings should be interpreted with caution. Further investigations would overcome these limitations.\r"

The L4-L5 and L5-S1 discs were investigated by both techniques in all patients. In addition, the L3-L4 disc was investigated in 20 patients. The 220 investigated discs were sorted out into 6 CT categories according to morphologic and technical criteria. They were also classified into 3 discographic groups according to morphologic and clinical criteria. Based on morphologic considerations alone, the false-negative CT rates varied from 0 to 64% and the false-positive rates varied from 0 to 19%, depending on the category under consideration. Based on both morphologic and clinical consideration, the false-negative CT rates varied from 34 to 57% and the false-positive CT rates varied from 23 to 50%. Thus, high-resolution CT does not constitute an adequate means of investigation for this category of patients and discography appears justified before considering any form of radical therapy.\r"

Before nerve root infiltration all patients were investigated by radiculography and computed tomography. Nerve root infiltration identified two types of response. In 20 patients, infiltration reproduced the symptomatic pain, which then was abolished by local anesthetic--the positive result. These patients were considered suitable for surgery. One patient in this group had spontaneous resolution of pain and thus did not undergo operative treatment. In 30 patients, infiltration did not reproduce the symptomatic pain regardless of the level studied, or only partially reproduced the pain at two or more levels--the negative result. Radiculography and computed tomography in these patients also was inconsistent. This group were considered unsuitable for surgery. In those patients undergoing surgical decompression, nerve root infiltration correctly identified the symptomatic level in 18 of the 19. Computed tomography and radiculography identified the level in 14 and 12 patients, respectively.\r"

  ".W": "Sodium hyaluronate, 1.9% solution, was evaluated for its ability to retard peridural fibrosis after unilateral lumbar hemilaminotomy, anular fenestration, and nuclectomy in dogs. Three materials: fat grafts, gelfoam, and sodium hyaluronate, were compared with empty controls for their ability to inhibit peridural fibrosis. Each dog served as his own internal control and the formation of fibrosis was evaluated at 2, 4, 12, and 26 weeks. Sodium hyaluronate was found to inhibit fibrosis more than the other materials on both a macroscopic and microscopic level. The area of fibrosis and tenacity of the adhesions on dissection were notably less in the sodium hyaluronate group. Microscopically, the thickness of collagen and number of fibroblasts were decreased with the use of 1.9% sodium hyaluronate. The peridural fibrosis occurred equally both anteriorly and posteriorly to the nerve roots and correlated with the area of surgical dissection. Fat grafts were not effective in preventing fibrosis anteriorly, especially in the region of the exiting nerve roots. Gelfoam did not inhibit but actually appeared to increase fibrosis formation. Interposition materials currently used in humans to prevent scar formation such as gelfoam and fat grafts have only addressed the posterior scar formation, which do little to alter the fibrosis anteriorly. The adhesions between the nerve root and the anulus fibrosus bind the nerve root down anteriorly, making it more vulnerable to recurrent disc herniation. Sodium hyaluronate, 1.9% solution, with its viscous semifluid properties, coats the nerve roots and dura anteriorly and posteriorly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The spinal roots of origin of the tibial nerve in the cat were determined by retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Spinal roots L6, L7, and S1 were found to give rise to the cat tibial nerve. Physiologic monitoring showed that the dorsal roots at these levels primarily contribute to the induction of the SSEP, but the ventral roots also make a small contribution. Because bilateral tibial nerve stimulation was found to mask a root injury on one side, we recommend sequential unilateral peripheral nerve stimulation when using SSEP during operations on the spine.\r"

The freeze-dried specimens lost a significantly greater amount of stiffness in compression, flexion, extension, and torsion than did the frozen specimens.

  ".W": "The utility or futility of flexion-extension radiographs in the diagnosis of lumbar spine segmental instability is a controversial issue. Previous investigations have reported a large range of normal motion and a significant overlap of symptomatic and asymptomatic motion patterns. The authors' goal was to define normal lumbosacral motion in vivo using ordinary weight-bearing lateral flexion-extension radiographs from 40 volunteers without the use of computers or special X-ray equipment. Calculation of dynamic vertebral translation, defined as the change in relative position from flexion to extension, provided a more accurate assessment of vertebral motion than measurement of static displacement on a flexion or extension view alone. Normal lumbar vertebral levels should have less than 3.0 mm of dynamic anteroposterior (AP) translation (less than 8% of vertebral body width). Although 42% of the normal subjects had at least one level with a static olisthesis greater than 3.0 mm in either flexion or extension, only 5% had a dynamic AP translation greater than 3.0 mm. These data have suggested that the previously reported large range of motion and frequency of overlap between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients may be significantly decreased (eightfold) by calculating dynamic motion, rather than static vertebral positions. The authors believe these data will provide the basis for reassessment of flexion-extension radiography in the diagnosis of lumbar spine instability.\r"

In 16 of the 19 patients who had a diagnosis of solid fusion, the immobilized vertebral bodies demonstrated areas of high signal intensity on images with short repetition time (TR) and echo time (TE). The signal intensity of these areas was either less intense or normal on images with long TR and TE. In 10 of the 14 patients with segmental instability at the fusion site, subchondral vertebral bands of low signal intensity were shown on short TR/TE images, which demonstrated high signal intensity on long TR/TE images. All but two of the patients showed vertebral signal changes 12 or more months past fusion or onset of clinical symptoms. The vertebral MR signal intensity in solid lumbar fusions might be related to marrow composition changes resulting from decreased biomechanical stress, while the vertebral signal intensities in patients with unstable fusions might be related to reparative granulation tissue, inflammation, edema, and hyperemic changes. Magnetic resonance imaging appears to be unique in its assessment of functional fusion stability. Magnetic resonance may be most useful in patients symptomatic of fusion pseudarthrosis in whom conventional radiography and CT fail to demonstrate anatomic disruption.\r"

  ".W": "The relation of ventilatory impairment and chronic mucus hypersecretion to death from all causes and death from obstructive lung disease (chronic bronchitis, emphysema and asthma) was studied in 13,756 men and women randomly selected from the general population of the City of Copenhagen. During the 10 year follow up 2288 subjects died. In 164 subjects obstructive lung disease was considered to be an underlying or a contributory cause of death (obstructive lung disease related death); in 73 subjects it was considered to be the underlying cause of death (obstructive lung disease death). Forced expiratory volume in one second, expressed as a percentage of the predicted value (FEV1% pred), and the presence of chronic phlegm were used to characterise ventilatory function and chronic mucus hypersecretion respectively. For mortality analysis the proportional hazards regression model of Cox was used; it included age, sex, pack years, inhalation habit, body mass index, alcohol consumption, and the presence or absence of asthma, heart disease, and diabetes mellitus as confounding factors. By comparison with subjects with an FEV1 of 80% pred or more, subjects with an FEV1 below 40% pred had increased risk of dying from all causes (relative risk (RR) = 5.0 for women, 2.7 for men), a higher risk of obstructive lung disease related death (RR = 57 for women, 34 for men), and a higher risk of obstructive lung disease death (RR = 101 for women, 77 for men). Chronic mucus hypersecretion was associated with only a slightly higher risk of death from all causes (RR = 1.1 for women, 1.3 for men). The association between chronic mucus hypersecretion and obstructive lung disease death varied with the level of ventilatory function, being weak in subjects with normal ventilatory function (for an FEV1 of 80% pred the RR was 1.2), but more pronounced in subjects with reduced ventilatory function (for an FEV1 of 40% pred the RR was 4.2). A similar though statistically non-significant trend was observed with regard to obstructive lung disease related death. This study shows that impaired lung function is very strongly related to total mortality, obstructive lung disease related mortality, and obstructive lung disease mortality and suggests that chronic mucus hypersecretion, in those with impaired ventilatory function, is also a significant risk factor for death from obstructive lung disease.\r"

Plexiform lesions occurred rather more frequently in supernumerary arteries arising laterally from a large parent vessel, whereas cellular or fibrous intimal thickening tended to affect dichotomous branches at the periphery. Hypertensive changes were confined to arteries of 100-150 microns diameter running along the necks of acini. Various types of collateral channels were found. In particular, the reconstructions suggest that pulmonary arterial blood at high pressure could flow into bronchial arteries via proximal bronchopulmonary arterial anastomoses, and thence by way of dilatation lesions to the alveolar capillaries.\r"

The mean right ventricular free wall volume was 57.1 (22.6) cm3, compared with a mean value of 115.0 (44.3) cm3 for the left ventricle and interventricular septal volume. The right ventricular chamber volume at end systole was 44.8 (23.4) cm3, whereas the left ventricular end systolic chamber volume was 51.1 (35.1) cm3. The right ventricular free wall volume correlated with the right ventricular chamber volume (r = 0.71), systolic (r = 0.74) and mean (r = 0.72) pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance (r = 0.67), and PaCO2 (r = 0.56). There was no significant correlation between the right ventricular free wall volume and PaO2 or the right ventricular ejection fraction, measured by radionuclide ventriculography. Assessment of the right ventricle by magnetic resonance imaging may help to better define patients with cor pulmonable and assess the long term effects of treatment in such patients.\r"

Measurements were made at total lung capacity and at residual volume and compared with similar measurements from 12 normal subjects reported in a previous study. At residual volume the mean peripheral tissue density in the emphysematous lungs was 0.081 kg/l compared with 0.426 kg/l in the fibrotic lungs and 0.323 kg/l in the normal lungs. The observed densities in the three groups were compared with those in a theoretical model predicting the vertical changes of lung density caused by gravitational effects that would be found in lungs with differing compliance. The emphysematous lungs showed a much greater increase of density with descent down the lung than that predicted for normal lungs, and the results were explicable by an increase in compliance. The fibrotic lungs showed considerably less change in density than expected, implying loss of compliance. It is suggested that local changes of compliance are important determinants of vertical density gradients in diseased lungs.\r"

  ".W": "Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with systemic sclerosis was analysed for evidence of pulmonary vascular leakage, inflammatory cell influx, and enhanced type III collagen synthesis. Eighteen patients with systemic sclerosis and computed tomographic evidence of fibrosing alveolitis were compared with 16 patients with a normal scan. The albumin concentration in lavage fluid was higher in all patients than in normal volunteers. Patients with an abnormal computed tomogram as a group had increased proportions of all inflammatory cell types, whereas those with a normal scan had increased neutrophils only. Increased lavage type III procollagen peptides were found in all patients with an abnormal computed tomogram and eight of those with a normal scan. These results suggest that pulmonary vascular leakage and neutrophil influx may be early pathological features of lung disease in systemic sclerosis and frequently associated with enhanced collagen production. Thus lavage of patients with systemic sclerosis may identify lung inflammation and altered collagen metabolism early in the evolution of fibrosing alveolitis.\r"

Knife wounds accounted for 92% of the injuries. Fifty three patients had a small collection of air or fluid in their pleural cavity that was not drained. Fifty six hemithoraces had a large collection of fluid or air and were treated by tube thoracostomy. Physical examination at presentation detected large collections of air and fluid correctly and predicted appropriate management (sensitivity 96%, specificity 94%). Residual collections of air or fluid or both were also predicted correctly by clinical examination. Seven small collections increased in size and required intubation. Routine pre-extubation radiographs were found to be of little value in management and their routine use is not recommended. Four patients required late thoracotomy for decortication. By using a policy of selective intubation, frequent clinical reassessment, and chest radiography when relevant, experienced trauma surgeons can manage most penetrating pleural injuries with an acceptably low complication rate.\r"

The effect of simulated altitude on peak expiratory flow (PEF) was determined in six subjects with both the mini Wright meter and a volumetric spirometer (which is unaffected by air density). With increasing altitude PEF as measured by the spirometer increased linearly with decreasing pressure, so that at a barometric pressure of 380 mm Hg* (half an atmosphere, corresponding to an altitude of 5455 m) there was a 20% increase over sea level values. The mini Wright flow meter gave readings 6% below sea level values for this altitude--that is, under-reading by 26%. Measurements of PEF made at altitude with the mini Wright meter should be corrected by adding 6.6% per 100 mm Hg drop in barometric pressure.\r"

Mucus clearance was measured in a central and a peripheral lung region by a radioactive aerosol tracer technique. Spontaneous mucus clearance from the peripheral lung region was higher in the patients with emphysema than in those with chronic bronchitis. There was no difference in central mucus clearance between the two groups. Mucus clearance from the peripheral lung region increased significantly during forced expirations and coughing in the patients with chronic bronchitis but not in those with emphysema. It is concluded that in patients with chronic airflow obstruction and regular sputum production spontaneous peripheral mucus clearance is greater in those with decreased elastic recoil pressure. Physiotherapy that includes forced expirations and coughing can enhance mucus clearance in such patients when elastic recoil pressure is normal but is unlikely to be effective when elastic recoil pressure is decreased.\r"

It was used for selective bronchography in 20 patients with suspected bronchiectasis. Side effects and change in FEV1 and in arterial oxygen saturation were compared in these patients and in 14 patients undergoing bronchoscopy for suspected carcinoma. Thirteen of the 20 patients undergoing bronchography had side effects, mainly headache, nausea, and a feeling of heat or flushing. The fall in FEV1 at four hours (0.3 l) did not differ from the fall in the control group (0.1 l). The fall in arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) during bronchography (9.4%) did not differ significantly from the fall during bronchoscopy in the control group (6.1%). Iotrolan gave good quality bronchograms, which in all cases provided a diagnosis. Iotrolan appears to be suitable for bronchography by fibreoptic bronchoscope and to be well tolerated.\r"

Of the remaining 256 reported deaths, 51 percent resulted from acute hemolysis following the transfusion of ABO-incompatible products. These deaths were due primarily to managerial, not clerical, errors. Other causes of death (in order of frequency of report) included acute pulmonary injury (15%), bacterial contamination of product (10%), delayed hemolysis (10%), damaged product (3%), and graft-versus-host disease (0.4%). Management systems for transfusion facilities should be created or revised to include the specific identification of personnel eligible to administer transfusions to provide written guidance and appropriate training (including recognition and management of errors), and to implement measures that target safe transfusion practices. Continued research into acute pulmonary injury, the immunologic hazards of transfusion, and the prevention of bacterial contamination of blood components is necessary.\r"

Treatment of plasma for 4 hours with 2-percent tri(n-butyl)phosphate (TNBP) at 37 degrees C, with 1-percent TNBP and 1-percent polyoxyethylensorbitan monooleate (Tween 80) at 30 degrees C, or with 1-percent TNBP and 1-percent polyoxyethylene ethers, (Triton X-45) at 30 degrees C resulted in the rapid and complete inactivation of greater than or equal to 10(4) tissue culture-infectious doses (TCID50) of vesicular stomatitis and Sindbis viruses, which are used as surrogates. Treatment of plasma with TNBP and TNBP and Tween-80 was shown to inactivate greater than or equal to 10(4) TCID50 of human immunodeficiency virus. TNBP treatment of plasma contaminated with 10(6) chimpanzee-infectious doses (CID50) of hepatitis B virus and 10(5) CID50 of non-A,non-B hepatitis virus prevented the transmission of hepatitis to chimpanzees. Immediately after treatment of plasma with 2-percent TNBP, the recovery of factors VIII, IX, and V and antithrombin III was 80, 90, 40, and 100 percent, respectively. Recovery of all factors was greater than or equal to 90 percent after treatment with TNBP and detergent mixtures. Treated plasma was fractionated by standard techniques into antihemophilic factor and prothrombin complex concentrates, immune globulin, and albumin. Prior treatment with TNBP or TNBP and detergent did not affect the separations of desired proteins. Therefore, it appears possible to inactivate viruses in plasma before the execution of standard fractionation procedures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It may be possible to decrease a patient's exposure to homologous donors. Pediatric cardiac surgery patients frequently are unable to donate autologous blood preoperatively. Since 1984, attempts have been made to provide parental apheresis platelets and intraoperative blood salvage to such patients to decrease their donor exposure. Further decreases in donor exposure have been the object of a program of collecting from one committed donor all the blood a patient is anticipated to need. This article reviews the experience with 50 pediatric cardiac surgery patients on such a program, in whom the mean decrease in homologous-donor exposure was 57 percent (range, 12-93%). Thirteen of these patients received only homologous blood products from one committed donor, for a mean decrease in homologous-donor exposure of 80 percent (range, 50-93%). A comparison of 12 of these 13 recipients with a matched control group showed no significant difference in red cell transfusion practice but a significant difference in the number of homologous-donor exposures per m2 of body surface area (BSA) (mean donor exposures/m2 of BSA: patients = 1.5, controls = 10.5). The use of one committed donor and autologous blood can provide a minimal-exposure transfusion.\r"

IBSE involved carefully controlled comparisons between two identical sets of blood cells, one exposed to microgravity and the other held on the ground. Specially designed and fabricated, electrically powered environmental chambers provided appropriate environmental temperatures and air flow to support cell metabolism throughout the experiment. To circumvent the need for constant agitation of platelets during storage, a new thin-layer compression method for platelet preservation was developed. Blood cell samples were allocated to the two arms of the experiment, microgravity and earth gravity, by blind assignment. Moreover, to ensure unbiased assessment of the experiment's findings, postexperiment samples for measurement were identified by code. To optimize the chances of detecting possible gravitational effects, a wide array of measurements of cellular function, morphology, metabolism, and immunology were made. Analysis of variance was used in analyzing the data. The most striking finding was that platelets displayed markedly superior structural and functional integrity at microgravity. Granulocytes held on the ground were preserved slightly better than those that orbited in the shuttle, whereas red cells displayed few effects that were attributable to the gravitational variable. Polyvinylchloride-di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (PVC-DEHP) was the plastic of choice for storage of red cells, while PVC-trioctyltrimellitate (TOTM) was superior to PVC-DEHP and polyolefin (PO) for platelets.\r"

Normal blood donors with (n = 30) and without (n = 121) positive DATs were also tested. RBCs that had been strongly sensitized (4+ indirect antiglobulin test) in vitro with different quantities of IgG anti-D, but that had similar antiglobulin test (AGT) titration scores, could easily be differentiated by flow cytometry. The mean percent fluorescence of RBCs, incubated with fluorescein-labeled anti-IgG, from neonatal patients with IHA was higher than that of RBCs from those without IHA, but there was no statistical difference in the other groups. There was considerable overlap in the respective ranges of percent fluorescence of RBCs from patients with and without IHA in all groups. It was not possible to define a clear quantitative threshold differentiating patients with IHA from those without. Although flow cytometry was more precise and reproducible than standard serology (e.g., AGT titration scores), correlations of the amount of RBC-bound IgG and in vivo hemolysis were similar.\r"

  ".W": "The rate of alloimmunization to platelet-specific antigens associated with platelet glycoproteins (GPs) IIb-IIIa and Ib/IX was studied in 293 multiply transfused thrombocytopenic patients. Antibodies to platelet-specific antigens were measured with a solid-phase assay using platelet GP IIb-IIIa or Ib/IX as the antigenic targets. Nine patients were found to have antibodies to platelet GP IIb-IIIa, and no patients had antibodies to platelet GP Ib/IX. In six of these nine patients, the specificity of the antibody was shown by using GP IIb-IIIa from donors with different platelet-specific antigen phenotypes. In the remaining three patients with antibodies to platelet GP IIb-IIIa, no specificity could be identified. These patients had autoimmune thrombocytopenia in association with lymphoma. The alloimmunization rate to platelet-specific antigens associated with GP IIb-IIIa was 2 percent, whereas the rate of alloimmunization to HLA antigens was 23 percent. Of the patients alloimmunized to HLA antigens, 9 percent also had antibodies to platelet-specific antigens. A poor response to HLA-identical platelet transfusions was observed only in those patients with positive assays in the solid-phase test. These results suggest that the incidence of antibodies to platelet-specific antigens carried on GP IIb-IIIa is low. Platelet-specific antibodies may be found more frequently in patients alloimmunized to HLA antigens than in those not so alloimmunized.\r"

FEIBA-VH, a second-generation complex, is vapor-heated for 10 hours at a temperature of 60 degrees C and a pressure of 1190 millibar (mbar) and for 1 additional hour at 80 degrees C and 1375 mbar. The current study was performed because of concern that this vapor-heating process would reduce the efficacy of FEIBA-VH as compared with non-heat-treated FEIBA (FEIBA). Forty-one patients received FEIBA-VH for 106 evaluable bleeding episodes. Ninety-three (88%) episodes were controlled, and 13 (12%) were not. Eighty-three (79%) episodes were controlled within 36 hours of the first infusion. No significant toxicity was seen. These results were compared with those of an earlier study with FEIBA. FEIBA-VH was at least as effective as FEIBA in controlling bleeding episodes and can be compared favorably to any reported treatment of bleeding episodes in hemophiliacs with inhibitors to FVIII.\r"

Four of 15 anti-HLA-A1 sera reacted with cells homozygous for HLA-A11 bet not with A11 heterozygotes. Similar dosage effects were noted with anti-A3 sera and A11 cells, with anti-A28 sera and A2 cells, with anti-A23 sera and A24 cells, and with anti-A24 sera and A23 cells. No dosage effects were seen with anti-A1 sera and A3 cells, with anti-A3 sera and A1 cells, and with anti-A11 sera and either A1 or A3 cells. Dosage effects were also not seen with anti-B51 or -B35 sera and cells containing antigens of the B5 crossreacting group. Dosage is a property of the individual serum and does not occur with all samples sharing the same primary specificity. As noted by red cell serologists, sera demonstrating dosage effects are common with some specificities but absent with others. The reactions noted may be a quantitative effect of epitopes present on certain antigens. Caution should be observed when interpreting an HLA phenotype that appears to contain two crossreacting antigens at the same locus, unless the sera used have been shown not to manifest dosage effects.\r"

  ".W": "The activation of platelets during the preparation of platelet concentrates (PCs) by two methods was compared. To eliminate interdonor differences, 2 units of whole blood were pooled and subsequently divided into two batches. From one batch, the platelets were harvested as pelleted platelets from platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and from the other as nonpelleted platelets from the buffy coat (BC). The activation of platelets in these PCs was studied immediately after preparation and during storage for up to 9 days at 22 degrees C with gentle agitation. The binding of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against the GP IIb/IIIa complex and against activation-dependent antigens (GMP 140 from the alpha granules and a 53-kDa glycoprotein from the lysosomal granules) was measured. Beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TG) release was also determined. Disc-to-sphere transformation was quantitated by measuring on an aggregometer the difference in light transmission during stirring at different rates and also by light microscopy. Immediately after preparation, platelets derived from PRP had a more spheric morphology (p less than 0.01), had a higher beta-TG release (p less than 0.01), bound more MoAbs against GP IIb/IIIa (p less than 0.01), and expressed more GMP 140 and 53-kDa glycoprotein (p less than 0.01) than did BC-derived platelets. However, these differences had disappeared after 2 days of storage. It was concluded that, immediately after preparation, PRP-derived platelets are more activated than BC-derived platelets. This is most likely a result of the pelleting that follows the second high-speed centrifugation of the PRP.\r"

The data confirm previous reports of lymphopenia and a symmetrical reduction of both T- and B-cell subpopulations in patients on long-term dialysis. Eleven (36.7%) of 30 intensely transfused dialysis (ITD) patients had a low T8 population when expressed as a percentage value, while 0 of 25 lightly transfused dialysis (LTD) control patients exhibited a low percentage of T8 cells. There were no significant absolute differences between the lymphocyte subsets in the ITD and LTD patients. These data contrast with previous reports of other groups of ITD patients in whom there was an observed increase in T8 cytotoxic suppressor cells. Our findings suggest that the immunologic effects of renal failure and long-term dialysis largely override the increase in T8 lymphocyte subsets observed in other groups of transfused patients. There is little difference between ITD and LTD patients, but both groups are significantly different from nontransfused controls. Further longitudinal studies are needed in completely untransfused patients to resolve the contribution of minimal transfusion therapy to the immunologic deficits observed in long-term dialysis patients.\r"

Southern blots of this type, however, demonstrate only two attributes of an allele: its length and the presence of nucleotide sequences that are complementary to the probe. Not all restriction fragments of the same apparent length that react with the same probe are identical. Differences between comigrating fragments can be detected by the selection of a restriction enzyme that recognizes sites in a subset of the repeat sequences, and the information content of these loci is therefore increased. This report describes a paternity case in which two brothers appeared, after DNA phenotyping using Hinf I, to be the father. A second phenotyping using Hae III excluded one of the brothers.\r"

The accuracy of this equation was not different between men and women or between active and sedentary people.

Body composition measures included densitometry, hydrometry, bone mineral density of the one-third distal radius, and TOBEC. Fat-free mass (FFM) was calculated by using one-, two-, and three-compartment models: densitometry, FFMd; densitometry and hydrometry, FFMdw; and densitometry, hydrometry, and bone mineral density, FFMdwb. Correlations between TOBEC variables and the three calculations of FFM were highly significant (r = 0.88-0.95; P less than 0.01). No significant differences were observed (ANOVA) between the TOBEC estimate of FFM (FFMT) and FFMd, FFMdw, and FFMdwb. Similar results were observed when the data were analyzed by gender. The TOBEC estimate of FFM was equivalent to the estimates of FFM derived from one-, two-, and three-component models. Its ease of measurement and its prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.933; SEE = 2.45 kg) in teen-agers make it a preferred technique for body composition assessment.\r"

Changes in anthropometry and x ray were also evaluated in nine obese patients who reduced body mass by less than or equal to 20.5 kg over 32 wk. Weight reduction resulted in nonproportional changes at the three sites, including significant differences in M+B CSA. Thus, it would not be valid to consider the arm as a geometric cylinder. Although a one-time assessment of upper arm M+B CSA with surface anthropometry may be valid at any of the three sites, changes in M+B CSA measured at any site may result in an under- or overestimation of actual changes in M+B CSA.\r"

In other groups with renal failure (acute renal failure without sepsis, chronic renal failure with conservative treatment or hemodialysis, and severe untreated azotemia) these indices were not different from those of control subjects. Urea nitrogen appearance was decreased in patients with chronic renal failure undergoing conservative treatment, in those with severe untreated azotemia, and in hemodialysis patients (P less than 0.05). We conclude that renal failure has no influence on energy expenditure as long as septicemia is absent. Reduced urea nitrogen appearance rates in chronic renal failure are due to a reduced energy and protein intake. Wasting is a consequence of decreased food intake but not of hypermetabolism in chronic renal failure.\r"

Milk production was measured by the test-weighing procedure and by milk expression. Basal metabolic rates (BMRs) were similar among all groups of women. No relationships were detected between BMRs and postpartum time in lactating women. In contrast, postprandial metabolic rates (PMRs) increased (P less than 0.01) in lactating compared with nonlactating women. Milk nitrogen concentrations but not energy showed a linear relationship with PMR (r = 0.86, P less than 0.001). The energy cost of milk production was estimated to be 125% of the energy output in milk. Thus, increased energy needs during lactation are associated not only with milk production but also with elevated PMRs. This increase was met by an increase in dietary energy intakes of 50% above the intakes of nonlactating counterparts.\r"

In this study, responses to changing stress over consecutive pregnancies were studied and contrasted within individual Guatemalan women; biases caused by factors constant to women were eliminated. Stress was assessed by examining responses in maternal supplement intake, maternal fat stores, and birth weight. Overlap and short recuperative intervals were found to be stressful (in that order) for mothers as shown by increased supplement intake and reduced fat stores. Birth weight in term gestations was not affected, indicating that fetal growth is being protected at the cost of maternal nutritional status.\r"

The Ex group walked at 60% heart-rate reserve (134 +/- 2 bpm; mean +/- SEM) during 45-min sessions, five times per week. Although exercise improved estimated maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max; 20.9 +/- 3.2% vs 2.1 +/- 3.4% in Ex vs Nex, respectively), changes in total body, lean body, and fat weight did not differ significantly between groups. Total body weight decreased 5.5 +/- 0.6 and 5.6 +/- 0.2 kg in Ex and Nex, respectively. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences in the pattern of change between groups for serum high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C; F[2,38] = 5.93, P = 0.006) but not for total cholesterol (TC), low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, or glucose. Change in diet quality and body weight were found to account fully for the 12.7 +/- 1.9% decrease in TC. When change in dietary quality and body weight are equated in a group of mildly obese women, the effect of moderate exercise training on indices of serum lipid and lipoprotein is limited to HDL-C.\r"

The prevention of hypoglycemia by nocturnal intragastric formula infusion has been shown to enhance growth and improve the metabolic abnormalities associated with GSD-III. Cornstarch therapy was effective in preventing hypoglycemia in a few patients with GSD-III who were previously treated with nocturnal enteral formula infusion, but oral cornstarch had not been evaluated as an initial treatment. We studied three patients with GSD-III who exhibited growth failure, elevated serum aminotransferase concentrations, and asymptomatic hypoglycemia. Cornstarch therapy was associated with maintenance of normoglycemia, increased growth velocity, and decreased serum aminotransferase concentrations in all patients. Our experience suggests that cornstarch therapy can be effective as an initial treatment for patients with GSD-III.\r"

A food frequency questionnaire was used to determine lactose consumption, and a breath-hydrogen test was used to determine lactose absorption after a physiological load of 0.5 g lactose/kg body wt was administered in the form of standardized irradiated whole milk. An increase in breath-hydrogen of 20 ppm indicated lactose malabsorption; 14% of the children were malabsorbers of lactose. No relationship was found between lactose malabsorption and lactose consumption, as estimated from the questionnaire. Possible reasons for the lower-than-expected prevalence of lactose malabsorption in this population are the use of a physiological dose of lactose, and the fact that this population is well nourished and free from significant parasitism and other endemic diseases.\r"

Results showed the existence of a threshold plasma maltose concentration for the urinary excretions of maltose and glucose and the existence of a maximum rate of urinary glucose excretion after maltose infusion. Elevation of plasma glucose concentration by simultaneous glucose infusion increased urinary glucose excretion but did not increase urinary maltose excretion; the relationship between plasma total sugar concentration and urinary total sugar excretion was unchanged. Results suggest that maltose administered intravenously is hydrolyzed to glucose by maltase in renal tubules and reabsorbed as glucose competitively with glucose derived from plasma and that the maximum utilization of intravenously infused maltose is determined by the tubular glucose reabsorption capacity.\r"

We previously described reduced concentrations of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D] in 30% of elderly nursing home residents. The present study assesses the effect of vitamin D supplementation on 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and 1,25(OH)2D. We performed a double-blind study in which 30 elderly nursing home residents were randomly given either 50 micrograms vitamin D or a placebo daily for 6 wk. Vitamin D metabolites, immunometrically assayed parathyroid hormone (IRMA-PTH), ionized calcium, and bone Gla hormone (BGP) were measured in serum at baseline and biweekly for 6 wk. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations increased significantly (P less than 0.0001) over the 6 wk in the treatment group but were unchanged in the placebo group. Serum 1,25(OH)2D, ionized calcium, BGP, and PTH were not significantly altered by the supplement. We conclude that vitamin D supplementation results in an increase in circulating 25(OH)D but not 1,25(OH)2D; however, the long-term effect on bone mineral metabolism remains unclear.\r"

Subjects were normotensive and had no medical condition and took no medication known to affect mineral metabolism or blood pressure. At baseline, systolic blood pressure was positively related to fasting calcium excretion and negatively to ionized calcium concentrations. Phosphorus concentrations (negatively) and fasting calcium excretion (positively) were correlated with diastolic pressures. Nevertheless, calcium and cholecalciferol supplementation did not influence blood pressure at any time during the study. These results suggest that whereas calcium metabolism may be related to the control of blood pressure, dietary calcium and cholecalciferol intakes do not play a major role in its regulation in normotensive individuals. Calcium and cholecalciferol supplements should not be expected to have an effect on blood pressure in normotensive populations.\r"

We randomized the treatment sequence among subjects and studied them as inpatients under metabolic-balance conditions. We found no significant effects of caffeine on fractional calcium absorption, endogenous fecal calcium, or urine calcium, whether examined day by day or cumulatively. Although the mean balance shift was negative, the change was not significantly different from zero. There was evidence of altered bone remodeling, with slight decreases in bone accretion, bone resorption, and calcium pool turnover.\r"

Correlational analyses examined relationships with intakes of nutrients of concern to cancer epidemiologists--energy, total fat, dietary fiber, and vitamins A and C. Findings indicate that the usual measure for assessing dietary risks, quantile of nutrient intake, reflects several dietary patterns differing in their composition of cancer risk factors. Furthermore, patterns may relate to such variables as age, ethnicity, and income, which are themselves related to cancer. This approach may provide a comprehensive measure of dietary exposure for epidemiologic research.\r"

Blood collection into EDTA-wetted plastic syringes at room temperature proved most reliable. Plasma and whole-blood taurine concentrations were determined in the same 13 women and 11 men three times within a 10-d period. The normal plasma taurine concentration was 44 +/- 9 mumol/L (mean +/- SD; n = 40) in fasting subjects and 42 +/- 7 mumol/L (n = 30) in semi-fasted individuals, with an intraindividual variation of 9 +/- 5%. Whole-blood taurine concentrations ranged from 164 to 318 mumol/L and had an intraindividual variation of 11 +/- 5%. Inter-individual variation averaged 12 +/- 7% for plasma and 7 +/- 6% for whole blood taurine. Because plasma and whole-blood taurine concentrations were not correlated, assessment of both would provide the most accurate estimate of taurine status. Short of that, whole-blood taurine would appear to be the best single measure.\r"

Despite vigorous treatment, three infants died and all except one of the six survivors have severe residual neurologic abnormalities. Postmortem findings included cerebral edema, white matter petechial hemorrhages, gastrointestinal hemorrhages, and fatty liver. These clinicopathologic features are similar to those previously described in 10 infants as being due to hemorrhagic shock and encephalopathy, except for the presence of fatty liver in our patients. Based on the combined experience of 19 infants, we propose diagnostic criteria for hemorrhagic shock and encephalopathy that may facilitate recognition and differentiation from other shock syndromes in infancy.\r"

The arm and leg tests, given in duplicate, were feasible in 94% and 61% of subjects, respectively. Reliability coefficients exceeded .95 in patients with spastic cerebral palsy and myopathies and were somewhat lower in those with athetotic cerebral palsy. Means and SDs were similar in both trials.

  ".W": "Interobserver variability for six coma scales was assessed prospectively on a sample of 15 comatose children, by two physicians, in a double-blind fashion. The six scales were the Glasgow Coma Scale, the Simpson and Reilly Scale, the Children's Coma Score, the Children's Orthopedic Hospital and Medical Center Scale, the Jacobi Scale, and the 0 to IV Scale. Interobserver variability was measured by using disagreement rate and the kappa statistic. The results from both methods were generally concordant. The disagreement rate for the various items in the different scales ranged from a high of 0.20 to a low of 0.03. The disagreement rate was greater than 0.10 for verbal responses in the Children's Coma Score and Glasgow Coma Scale and for both items in the Children's Orthopedic Hospital and Medical Center Scale. The disagreement rate was 0.10 or less for the 0 to IV Scale and for all items in the Simpson and Reilly and Jacobi scales. The relatively high interobserver agreement for these scales makes them more suitable for the pediatric setting than the other three scales, since good agreement is essential for interpreting data reliably, both in clinical practice and for research.\r"

  ".W": "Response to growth hormone (GH) therapy was evaluated in 38 short children (28 males and 10 females; less than 1% in height for chronologic age [CA]) who were clinically categorized into three groups based on their endogenous mean 24-hour GH concentration (mean 24-hour GH) and peak GH response to two or more provocative agents (peak GH). All patients were treated with biosynthetic somatropin (human growth hormone) (0.15 to 0.30 mg/kg per week) injected subcutaneously three to seven times per week for a mean duration of 12.5 months. Group 1 consisted of 17 subjects (CA, 12.5 +/- 2.9 years [mean +/- SD]; bone age, 9.4 +/- 2.9 years; height velocity [HV], 3.4 +/- 1.8 cm/y; peak GH, 5.8 +/- 2.6 micrograms/L; mean 24-hour GH, 1.7 +/- 0.6 micrograms/L; and insulinlike growth factor-I, 0.40 +/- 0.24 U/mL. Group 2 consisted of 10 subjects (CA, 11.7 +/- 2.7 years; bone age, 9.2 +/- 3.0 years; HV, 3.4 +/- 1.6 cm/y; peak GH, 16.4 +/- 5.2 micrograms/L; mean 24-hour GH, 1.7 +/- 0.5 micrograms/L; and insulinlike growth factor-I, 0.49 +/- 0.27 U/mL. Group 3 consisted of 11 subjects (CA, 12.7 +/- 2.2 years; bone age, 10.2 +/- 2.4 years; HV, 3.5 +/- 1.5 cm/y; peak GH, 22.5 +/- 8.6 micrograms/L; mean 24-hour GH, 3.8 +/- 1.1 micrograms/L; and insulinlike growth factor-I, 1.07 +/- 0.69 U/mL. Following administration of somatropin, an increase (delta) in HV of 2.0 cm/y or greater occurred in 94% (16/17) of the group I subjects (delta HV of 5.1 +/- 2.6 cm/y), in 90% (9/10) of the group 2 subjects (delta HV of 4.3 +/- 2.2 cm/y), and in 73% (8/11) of group 3 subjects (delta HV of 3.7 +/- 2.3 cm/y). However, regardless of provoked and/or endogenous GH secretory dynamics, 88% of the children whose pretreatment HV was 2.0 cm/y or less, 94% whose pretreatment HV was between 2.0 and 4.0 cm/y, and 79% whose pretreatment HV was greater than 4.0 cm/y increased their HVs to 2.0 cm/y or greater while they were receiving somatropin. Significant negative correlations were observed between delta HV and pretreatment HV (r = -.67), delta HV and GH concentration expressed as a 24-hour area under the curve (r = -.33), and delta HV and peak GH (r = -.34).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The response rate was 73%. The highest levels of comfort and fewest recommendations for increasing emphasis were for neonatal problems and health maintenance. The lowest perceived comfort levels and the most recommendations for increasing emphasis were for economics of pediatric practice and sports medicine/orthopedics. Graduates from the primary care track of the pediatric residency program expressed more comfort than did regular track graduates for some, but not all, areas of pediatrics emphasized in the primary care track program. Graduates of the first 5 years of study were not as comfortable with their training overall as were graduates from the most recent 5 years. This survey method and its results can provide useful information to medical educators faced with evaluation and revision of pediatric residency training programs.\r"

In patients with Down syndrome, the complete form of atrioventricular canal was prevalent, with a high frequency of associated Fallot's tetralogy. Partial atrioventricular canal and left-sided anomalies were more common in patients without Down syndrome. Down syndrome is associated with a simpler type of atrioventricular canal when compared with patients with a normal chromosome configuration.\r"

Twenty physical activity variables measured via parent and teacher questionnaires were factor analyzed, and for each of the resultant eight factors, individual factor scores were generated. These were used in two multiple regression analyses in which 1.6-km run/walk time and sum of skinfold measurements were the dependent variables. Multiple R2 for these two analyses were .21 and .18. Significant factors in both analyses were global ratings of the child's activity level, age, vigorous community activities, and gender. The results indicate that physical activity and physical fitness are significantly, although moderately, associated in young children and suggest that interventions directed toward enhancement of physical activity in children are worthy of investigation.\r"

To determine the extent of continuing morbidity in an era of vaccination, a retrospective review was conducted of the records of neonates and infants hospitalized with pertussis infection at Parkland Memorial Hospital and Children's Medical Center, Dallas, Tex. During the 20 years from 1967 through 1986, 182 patients were younger than 24 months. Among 176 patients whose immunization history was recorded, 89% had received fewer than two doses of pertussis vaccine. The mean hospital stay was 7.4 days (range, 1 to 69 days). A convulsion occurred in 11 patients (6%). Apnea was reported in 45 patients (25%) and observed in the hospital in 26 (14%). Nine patients (5%) received mechanical ventilatory therapy. Intensive care monitoring was required in 18 patients (10%). Three (1.6%) died, all with secondary bacterial pneumonia. This hospital-based population indicates that pertussis continues to be a cause of serious morbidity and mortality in infants.\r"

  ".W": "During their maintenance therapy, children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia are treated with a daily dose of mercaptopurine for several years. A recent retrospective analysis has suggested that administration of the drug in the evening results in a better prognosis. We compared the disposition pharmacokinetics of mercaptopurine administered in the morning vs in the evening in 13 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Elimination half-life of mercaptopurine was significantly longer in the evening than during the day (423 +/- 142 minutes vs 176 +/- 22 minutes, mean +/- SEM). The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0-infinity) was significantly larger in the evening (24,713 +/- 3536 ng/mL per minute vs 17,120 +/- 1474 ng/mL per minute). These differences were even more pronounced when comparing the area under the curve of the postdistributive phase (AUC300 min-infinity, 7724 +/- 2955 ng/mL per minute in the evening vs 2597 +/- 712 ng/mL per minute during the day). In a second study, 12 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia receiving mercaptopurine in the morning had their medication administration switched to the evening. Within 2 weeks there was a sharp fall in peripheral white blood cell counts in all patients (from 4.1 x 10(9)/L to 2.2 x 10(9)/L) mainly due to a drop in polymorphonuclear lymphocytes (from 2.78 x 10(9)/L to 1.05 x 10(9)/L). We conclude that the diurnal variations of mercaptopurine disposition result in clinically important myelotoxicity of the drug.\r"

Nine patients (five male, four female) were treated with cyclosporine and low-dose prednisolone, and 11 children (six male, five female) were treated with azathioprine and high-dose prednisolone. The cumulative dose of steroids after transplantation was significantly lower in the cyclosporine-treated group. Bone age, according to the radius-ulna-short bones method of Tanner and Whitehouse, was almost the same in both groups at the time of transplantation (15.0 and 14.6 years for male subjects, 13.3 and 13.1 years for female subjects). Predicted adult height (Tanner-Whitehouse Mark II-method of Tanner et al) and target height were estimated at transplantation. Adult height was defined as achieved when bone age in male subjects had reached 18 years and, in female subjects, 16 years. Bone maturation of the cyclosporine-treated patients occurred at a normal rate (0.92 bone-age years per chronologic year), whereas the azathioprine-treated group exhibited a significantly slower rate (0.56 bone-age years per chronologic year). The growth rate per year for the cyclosporine-treated group was more than double that of the azathioprine-treated group (3.0 cm vs 1.4 cm). The adult height of the cyclosporine-treated group exceeded the predicted adult height by a mean of 1.3 cm, but the azathioprine-treated group missed it by 3.9 cm. Target heights could not be achieved in any group. Kidney function was significantly lower in the cyclosporine- vs the azathioprine-treated group, but no patients suffered from severe renal insufficiency. We conclude that cyclosporine and low-dose prednisolone are associated with normal bone maturation and a better prognosis for final height in children with renal transplants.\r"

In addition, significantly higher rates of pregnancy complications, including perinatal deaths and fetal growth retardation, occur among these women and their offspring. We studied the medical records of 40 infants born to 38 alcohol abusers and the frequency of characteristics associated with fetal alcohol syndrome. Physical examinations of 6 infants revealed primary features consistent with a diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome. Postnatal growth and development were very poor in 17 (50%) of 34 liveborn alcohol-exposed infants. The diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome did not appear in the medical records of any of these infants despite the fact that the mothers' obstetric records included a history of alcohol abuse during pregnancy. This finding emphasizes the importance of good communication between obstetric and pediatric medical staff at this hospital, particularly when providing care for pregnant women and newborn infants at high risk for complications due to maternal alcohol or other drug abuse.\r"

For mothers with CF, the following responses were given: 11% recommend breast-feeding, 8% do not recommend it, 42% make the recommendation according to the health status of the mother, and 32% make the recommendation according to the personal wishes of the mother. The duration of breast-feeding for mothers of infants with CF was reported to be from 3 to 6 months by 43% of centers, whereas for mothers with CF, 41% of centers reported the duration to be less than 3 months. Several centers reported that their experiences were not always positive, thus indicating a need to establish criteria to predict and ensure a successful outcome.\r"

  ".W": "Height and weight data obtained from a 2-year longitudinal survey were analyzed for 2272 children aged 6 through 18 years who were attending public schools or Seventh-Day Adventist (SDA) schools in southern California. The SDAs do not use alcohol or tobacco, and many adhere to a lacto-ovovegetarian diet. For both sexes, in each school group, the mean height and weight were at or above national reference values. Age-adjusted regression analysis showed that SDA school-boys were 1.6 cm taller than public schoolboys. There were no significant differences in height for girls. After controlling for height, boys and girls in the SDA schools were found to be leaner than their public school peers, ie, 1.27 and 1.16 kg, respectively. These results suggest that a health-oriented life-style in childhood and adolescence, such as the one followed by SDAs, is compatible with adequate growth and associated with a lower weight for height.\r"

  ".W": "Theophylline therapy increases left ventricular output in preterm infants by a combination of positive inotropic and chronotropic effects. The cardiovascular effects of caffeine were evaluated in 20 clinically stable preterm infants. Ten infants received intravenous caffeine citrate with a loading dose of 20 mg/kg and a maintenance dose of 5 mg/kg every 24 hours, and 10 infants were control subjects. Left ventricular output, stroke volume, and heart rate were measured by using a combination of two-dimensional and pulsed Doppler echocardiography and mean arterial blood pressure by oscillometry (Dinamap, Critikon, Division of McNeil Laboratories, Irvine, Calif) before the start and on days 1, 2, 3, and 7 of caffeine therapy and 7 days after discontinuation of therapy. Compared with controls, left ventricular output and stroke volume were significantly increased on days 1 to 7 of caffeine therapy. Caffeine led to an increase in the mean arterial blood pressure on the first 3 days of therapy, but the heart rate did not change. These data indicated that caffeine administration leads to a significant increase in left ventricular output in preterm infants and that this inotropic effect is accompanied by a pressor effect.\r"
