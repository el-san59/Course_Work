  ".W": "We discuss three cases of diaphragmatic flutter in patients with extreme polypnea and symptoms of respiratory alkalosis. Initially, the diagnosis for each case was HVS. However, analysis of the respiratory pattern during attacks revealed two frequencies. A fast respiratory rhythm (230 to 250 breaths per minute) was superimposed on a slow rhythm (15 to 30 breaths per minute). The fast rhythm maintained blood gases at normal limits or hypocapnic levels. The dual respiratory rhythms, which do not occur with HVS, indicated diaphragmatic flutter. In addition, the usual treatment for HVS-breathing CO2 mixed air-did not influence the attacks. For two of the three patients, an intravenous dose of DPH suppressed the abnormal respiratory patterns immediately and completely. The third patient responded to an intramuscular injection of haloperidol. For these cases, the dual respiratory rhythms were the key to diagnosis of diaphragmatic flutter which accompanied hyperventilation.\r"

  ".W": "We treated 27 patients with regionally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with two cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with etoposide, vindesine, and cisplatin. Twenty-three patients were evaluable for response; 13 had a partial response while ten patients had stable disease or disease progression. Subsequent local therapy consisted of surgery followed by radiotherapy in four patients and of radiotherapy alone in 14 patients. Five patients did not receive local therapy. At completion of local therapy, seven patients were considered free of disease including all four who had undergone surgery. Median time to disease progression for the 13 patients who had a partial response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was eight months (three to 51+ months). The median survival for all patients registered on study was eight months (three days to 53+ months). Chemotherapy induced toxicities included moderate myelosuppression, nausea and vomiting in all patients, and occasional ototoxicity, neurotoxicity, and wasting syndrome. One patient died of intracerebral hemorrhage due to thrombocytopenia. This trial shows that administration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy to patients with locoregionally advanced NSCLC is feasible and may yield an increased response rate compared to patients with stage IV disease. While no clearly beneficial effect of the use of chemotherapy on patient survival is apparent in this study, further studies utilizing neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC are warranted and should attempt to identify more active combinations of drugs.\r"

As scientific evidence accumulates supporting the important role of underlying nutritional status in determining the eventual outcome of many illnesses, aggressive nutritional intervention has become commonplace in our medical and surgical ICUs. However, nutritional support, particularly parenteral alimentation, is expensive and associated with important morbidity and even mortality. Furthermore, definite evidence of its clinical efficacy under certain specific conditions is often lacking and in need of properly done prospective studies. This review summarizes the basic principles of nutrition as applied to the critically ill patient in the clinical setting. Special emphasis is on practical considerations regarding cost, efficacy (or lack thereof), and potential advantages, disadvantages, and risk of complications of each proposed approach.\r"

Five of the specimens were also positive for Pneumocystis carinii, and other pulmonary diagnoses included histoplasmosis, lymphoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, and aspiration pneumonia. Five additional BAL specimens were cultured after freezing at -70 degrees C, but only two were culture-positive for HIV (p = 0.022; FET). This study indicates that HIV can be recovered from the BAL fluid in most patients with AIDS, unrelated to the type of pulmonary disease. In contrast to cultures, HIV antigen was detected in the BAL fluid of only one patient, and that patient had LIP with noncaseating granulomas. Therefore, HIV culture is not useful in the diagnosis of LIP, but HIV antigen detection should be studied further. All BAL fluids should be considered potentially infectious.\r"

  ".W": "Aprotinin (bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor), a serine protease inhibitor, caused a dose-dependent inhibition of [125I]human FSH ([ 125I]hFSH) binding to 1) an FSH receptor-enriched light membrane fraction prepared from bovine calf testes homogenates, 2) Triton X-100-solubilized FSH receptor, and 3) proteoliposomes containing incorporated FSH receptor-G-protein-adenylate cyclase (AC) complexes. Equilibrium binding studies with the solubilized receptor indicated that the effect of aprotinin on [125I]hFSH binding was due to a decrease in the Ka of the receptor, with no change in FSH-binding capacity. The rate of association of [125I]hFSH with its receptor was reduced by 50% in the presence of aprotinin, but no effect on dissociation of FSH-receptor complexes was evident. Aprotinin, at a concentration (250 microM) that inhibited binding of [125I]hFSH to the membrane receptor by 25%, completely inhibited basal, fluoride-stimulated and FSH-stimulated AC activity. However, aprotinin, at a concentration (50 microM) that had little effect on [125I]hFSH binding, markedly enhanced basal AC activity (3.4-fold) to the level of fluoride and FSH stimulation. Aprotinin did not inhibit [3H]5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate binding to FSH receptor-enriched membranes, suggesting that its effects on the affinity of the receptor for FSH and on AC activation were not mediated through an interaction with FSH receptor-associated G-protein. No serine protease activity could be detected in any of the receptor or hormone preparations used in this study. The ability of aprotinin to inhibit binding of [125I]hFSH to the Triton X-100-solubilized receptor and to the soluble receptor incorporated into proteoliposomes as well as to the FSH receptor-enriched membrane fraction, all of which are free of serine protease activity, is consistent with the notion that aprotinin may directly interact with the FSH receptor to sterically hinder binding of FSH. Furthermore, the apparent direct effect of aprotinin on basal as well as FSH-stimulated AC activity suggests its general usefulness in studies on the mechanism of signal transduction for ligands thought to operate via the cAMP second messenger system.\r"

  ".U": "89289549\r", 
  ".W": "Recent reports suggest that epidermal growth factor (EGF) or related peptides may act as local hormones to regulate granulosa cell differentiation. While FSH and GnRH are known to stimulate accumulation of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) mRNA in granulosa cells, studies using nonovarian cells have shown stimulation of tPA by EGF. In this study, the effect of EGF and its structural analog transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF alpha) on ovarian tPA mRNA and activity was investigated. Granulosa cells obtained from immature estrogen-treated rats were cultured with FSH or increasing doses of EGF or TGF alpha before analysis of tPA activity using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by a fibrin overlay technique. Like FSH and GnRH, EGF and TGF alpha stimulated the secretion of tPA activity in a dose- and time-dependent manner (onset, 12 h; maximum, 48 h). Northern blot hybridization of total RNA using a rat cRNA probe for tPA showed the accumulation of a 22S species mRNA in cells treated with EGF or TGF alpha, but not with nerve growth factor, suggesting increased expression of the tPA gene. Furthermore, slot blot hybridization of RNA from these cells confirmed a time-dependent increase in tPA mRNA preceding that in enzyme activity. Cotreatment of a saturating dose of EGF with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or GnRH resulted in additive increases in both tPA enzyme activity and mRNA levels. In addition, pretreatment with PMA desensitized the cells to subsequent treatment with PMA or GnRH, but did not diminish EGF-induced tPA mRNA, suggesting that EGF acts through a pathway independent of protein kinase-C. Also, extracellular cAMP levels did not increase with EGF treatment in the presence or absence of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, suggesting the lack of involvement of the protein kinase-A pathway. Suppression of protein synthesis by cycloheximide inhibited the induction of tPA mRNA by EGF, whereas similar treatment resulted in the superinduction of tPA mRNA in FSH-treated cells, suggesting that EGF and FSH do not share the same pathway. These results suggest that EGF and TGF alpha induce tPA mRNA and activity in granulosa cells through a pathway independent of protein kinases-A (FSH) and -C (GnRH and phorbol ester), providing an interesting model for future elucidation of the molecular mechanism involved in tPA gene expression.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated the role of intracellular calcium in the mechanism of action of prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) in cultured rat luteal cells. PGF2 alpha (1 microM) maximally inhibited LH-stimulated cAMP accumulation and also initiated a transient release of intracellular calcium. Low doses of the calcium ionophore ionomycin also increased intracellular calcium to a similar extent as PGF2 alpha (1 microM), but did not inhibit LH-stimulated cAMP accumulation. Chelation of intracellular calcium with dimethyl bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) (10 microM) attenuated the transient calcium rise stimulated by PGF2 alpha, but did not affect the inhibitory characteristics of PGF2 alpha on LH-stimulated cAMP accumulation. Treatment of luteal cells with EGTA (1 mM) and ionomycin (500 nM) resulted in depletion of intracellular calcium to such an extent that a subsequent exposure of the luteal cells to PGF2 alpha (1 microM) did not elicit any change in intracellular calcium. Depletion of intracellular calcium and ablation of the calcium response to PGF2 alpha, however, did not affect either the dose response or the time course of inhibition of LH-stimulated cAMP accumulation. We conclude that although intracellular calcium is mobilized by PGF2 alpha in cultured rat luteal cells, the antigonadotropic action of PGF2 alpha on LH-stimulated cAMP accumulation is not mediated by this mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "Studies were conducted to determine the effects of inhibin immunoneutralization on gonadotropins and sex steroids secretion, as well as ovulation rate and the outcome of pregnancy in the rat. These changes were compared to the normal pattern of hormone release during the estrous cycle, as well as to the ovulatory and gestational history of control animals. Measurement of plasma inhibin levels with antibodies raised against the N-terminus part of the alpha-chain of the molecule indicated an increase in immunoreactive inhibin-alpha release during the afternoon of proestrus, followed by a marked decline after the primary gonadotropin surge. Removal of endogenous inhibin by the iv injection of anti-inhibin serum on diestrus-1 caused the expected rise in plasma FSH, but not LH values. FSH secretion remained elevated for approximately 28 h, then returned to baseline. While not altering vaginal cytology, the injection of the antiserum during diestrus-1 or -2, and to a lesser degree, during estrus, caused a marked increase in the number of tubal ova shed during the subsequent estrus. However, plasma estrogen and progesterone remained comparable at all times between control and treated animals. In female rats mated after inhibin immunoneutralization at diestrus-1, the increase in ovulation rate resulted in a significant increase in developing fetuses, but only ca. 40% of the pups survived. In order to assess whether elevated FSH secretion represented the primary mechanism through which removal of endogenous inhibin increased the number of maturing follicles, ovine FSH was infused for 35 h starting in diestrus-1 or diestrus-2. Similar to the treatment with the anti-inhibin serum, FSH infusion caused an increase the number of eggs present in the oviducts on the next day of estrus. These results support the existence of a close functional relationship between the circulating levels of FSH and inhibin in the female rat. They also indicate that immunization against inhibin increases ovulation rate, a phenomenon probably mediated through elevated levels of circulating FSH.\r"

Binding of tracer, [DSer1,Nle5]human inhibin alpha(1-25)-Gly-125I-Tyr, to antibody was inhibited by standard, [DSer1,Nle5]human inhibin alpha(1-25)-Gly-Tyr. and by plasma from adult male monkeys in a parallel fashion. Castration in adults resulted in a 5-fold decline in the levels of immunoreactivity in plasma. Mean (+/- SE) plasma inhibin alpha concentrations in infants and adults (322.9 +/- 51.9 and 460.1 +/- 43.9 pg/ml, respectively) were significantly higher (P less than 0.05) than those in juveniles (191.3 +/- 28.3 pg/ml). Moreover, initiation of puberty in juvenile males, 13-18 months of age, with a chronic (10- to 12-week) intermittent iv infusion of GnRH (0.1 microgram/min for 3 min every 3 h) resulted in a progressive rise in circulating inhibin alpha that plateaued, after 5 weeks of pituitary stimulation, at concentrations (343.9 +/- 38.2 pg/ml) comparable to those of infants and adults and twice those observed before initiation of the pulsatile infusion of GnRH. Circulating FSH concentrations increased during the first week of GnRH stimulation from 2.7 +/- 0.1 ng/ml before treatment to 6.0 +/- 1.2 ng/ml, where they remained for the duration of the experiment. Testosterone secretion during the initiation of precocious puberty occurred in discrete episodes that were robustly correlated with GnRH-induced LH discharges. In contrast, changes in circulating inhibin alpha concentrations over the 3-h interval between GnRH pulses were unremarkable. Activation of Sertoli and Leydig cells during initiation of puberty in the juvenile males, as reflected by circulating inhibin alpha and testosterone concentrations, respectively, occurred with similar time courses. At the time of orchidectomy, 10-12 weeks after initiation of GnRH treatment, testicular tissue was prepared for histological examination. In spite of a 2-fold gain in testicular weight and in hypertrophy of Sertoli cells in association with GnRH stimulation, maturation of the germinal epithelium did not progress past prophase I spermatocytes, and the number of these latter cells was meager. These findings indicate that the testis of the infant primate, like that of the adult, secretes significant amounts of inhibin, and that the quiescent Sertoli cell of the juvenile males may be readily provoked by appropriate gonadotropin stimulation into producing inhibin. The results also fail to provide evidence for the view that changes in circulating inhibin concentrations are robustly related, in an inve\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether the testes of the juvenile male rhesus monkey, receiving an invariant intermittent iv infusion of GnRH, produce a specific FSH secretion-inhibiting hormone that exerts its action directly at the level of the pituitary gland. To this end, five male rhesus monkeys between 13-18 months of age were treated with a chronic intermittent iv infusion of GnRH (0.1 microgram/min for 3 min every 3 h) for 10 weeks to elicit an adult-like pattern in the episodic activity of the pituitary-Leydig cell axis. Animals were then bilaterally orchidectomized, and on the day of castration testosterone replacement with testosterone-containing Silastic capsules that maintained circulating levels of the steroid at approximately 6 ng/ml was initiated. Sequential blood samples were collected before castration and at 4-5, 11-13, and 18-19 days thereafter. Removal of the testes resulted in a marked and selective hypersecretion of FSH, a response very similar to that observed previously in hypothalamus-lesioned GnRH-treated adult males. This finding indicates that it will be possible to substitute the juvenile male for the much larger hypothalamus-lesioned adult in future studies requiring a hypophysiotropic clamp preparation. Such a modification of this experimental model will facilitate an examination of the effects on FSH secretion of passive immunization with inhibin antisera and of administering pure inhibin peptides.\r"

  ".W": "The acute and long term effects of dietary restrictions on gonadotropin secretion were studied in ovariectomized female lambs. Nutritionally growth-restricted lambs which were chronically maintained at a body weight comparable to that at weaning (approximately 20 kg) became hypogonadotropic, exhibiting a low frequency of episodic LH discharges. Repeated administration of physiological doses of GnRH to these females at hourly intervals produced corresponding LH pulses, leading to the hypothesis that the dietary-induced hypogonadotropism arises from a deficiency in endogenous GnRH release, rather than an inability of the pituitary gland to secrete gonadotropins in response to hypothalamic stimulation. In such growth-restricted females receiving a single meal daily, initiation of ad libitum feeding led to a spontaneous LH pulse within 1 h. After 14 days of increased food intake, hourly LH pulses were evident; a marked reduction in LH pulse frequency was associated with the return to limited nutrition. No effects on pulse amplitude were evident. Changes in circulating FSH followed a pattern similar to that for LH, namely an increase in concentration with improved nutrition and a decrease with reduced nutrition. The rate of response of FSH secretion to these alterations in nutrition was slower than that for LH. PRL levels were not altered by changes in nutrition, and a clear annual rhythm of secretion was observed. GH concentrations changed inversely with the level of nutrition; high secretion was associated with periods of restricted feeding, and low secretion with increased nutrition. These findings indicate that dietary restriction in the developing female lamb depresses gonadotropin secretion without reducing other anterior pituitary gland secretions, such as PRL and GH. That these changes occur in the absence of the ovaries implies that metabolic and growth-related modulation of neuroendocrine function can occur independently of changes in sensitivity to the feedback actions of ovarian steroids and polypeptides.\r"

  ".U": "89289584\r", 
  ".W": "We have recently reported that the posterior pituitary contains PRL-releasing factor (PRF), a small (less than 5000 mol wt) peptide which induces a rapid, hormone-specific, and concentration-dependent stimulation of PRL secretion. Although the identity of posterior pituitary PRF is yet unknown, it is distinct from known PRL secretagogues. Recently, the vasopressin-associated glycopeptide (VAG), which is concentrated in the posterior pituitary, was suggested as a PRF. To investigate whether VAG functions as a PRF, we used Brattleboro rats, which are deficient in arginine vasopressin (AVP), AVP-associated neurophysin, and VAG. Homozygous (DI) and heterozygous (HZ) lactating Brattleboro rats were used. The water consumption of pregnant DI rats (greater than 300 ml/day) was 6-fold higher than that of HZ rats. To correct their water imbalance, DI rats were implanted with osmotic minipumps containing the vasopressin analog 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin. On days 7-8 of lactation, pups were separated for 6 h, and blood was collected from the dams via a jugular cannula. Upon introduction of the pups, plasma PRL levels increased 100-fold in both DI and HZ rats and remained elevated for the duration of suckling. The suckling-induced rises in plasma oxytocin in DI and HZ rats were also superimposable. The weight gains of the pups of DI and HZ mothers were similar. PRF activity was determined using perifused anterior pituitary cells. Posterior pituitaries from DI and HZ rats contained equivalent amounts of PRF activity. Moreover, purified rat VAG (1.5 and 6.0 micrograms) failed to stimulate PRL release from pituitary cells. The posterior pituitary content of immunoreactive AVP was 2500-fold higher in HZ rats, but the contents of dopamine and oxytocin were similar. It is concluded that VAG neither mediates the suckling-induced rise of plasma PRL, nor stimulates PRL secretion from perifused anterior pituitary cells. Furthermore, posterior pituitaries from DI and HZ rats contain equivalent amounts of PRF activity. Collectively, these data indicate that VAG is not the posterior pituitary PRF.\r"

Pregnant Suffolk ewes were maintained in artificial photoperiod of either long days [16 h of light, 8 h of dark (16L:8D)] or short days (8L:16D) from approximately 100 days of gestation until term at approximately 147 days. On the day of birth, all lambs and their mothers were transferred to an intermediate photoperiod of 12L:12D; both groups were housed together. To provide an index of response to photoperiod, serum PRL concentrations were measured in blood samples collected daily 3-4 h after lights on. In lambs (n = 8 male; n = 7 female) born to mothers on long days, serum PRL concentrations were high (greater than 200 ng/ml) for the first few days after birth, but fell rapidly to low levels (less than 50 ng/ml) within 14 days postnatally in 12L:12D. Conversely, lambs (n = 8 male; n = 7 female) born to mothers on short days initially had low PRL concentrations, but these gradually increased in the postnatal 12L:12D photoperiod to 150 ng/ml by 32 days of age. Thus, serum PRL concentrations in lambs at birth reflect the photoperiodic treatment of their mother, and the subsequent PRL response to an intermediate photoperiod of 12L:12D depends on the photoperiodic history received in utero. We infer from these findings that the fetal lamb receives and responds to information about day length in utero and begins developing a seasonal photoperiod history before birth.\r"

  ".U": "89289593\r", 
  ".W": "The effect of 3 alpha-hydroxy-4-pregnen-20-one (3HP), a Sertoli cell steroid, on the secretion of gonadotropins from rat anterior pituitary cells in culture was examined and subsequently compared with the action of other gonadal steroids and steroids structurally related to 3HP. Pituitary cells from randomly cycling, sexually mature female rats were isolated and maintained in culture 72 h before use. On the day of treatment, medium was changed, steroids (10(-16)-10(-4) M) and/or LHRH (10(-8) M) were added, and cells were allowed to incubate for a further 24 h. Medium was then examined for gonadotropin content by RIA. 3HP treatment of anterior pituitary cells resulted in a significant reduction of both basal and LHRH-induced FSH secretion, while LH secretion was unaffected. The lowest effective dose of 3HP (10(-16) M) significantly decreased basal FSH secretion to 65.6% of control levels. The lowest effective dose of 3HP that significantly inhibited (by 31%) LHRH-induced FSH secretion was 10(-14) M 3HP. Maximum suppression by 3HP of basal FSH secretion occurred between 10(-10)-10(-8) M, and maximum suppression of LHRH-induced secretion occurred at 10(-12) M. None of the other gonadal steroids tested (progesterone, testosterone, 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone, 17 beta-estradiol, 20 alpha-hydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one, and 5 alpha-pregnane-3,20-dione) had a similar selective effect on FSH secretion; progesterone, testosterone, and 17 beta-estradiol actually resulted in increased FSH release, and 5 alpha-pregnane-3,20-dione resulted in significant increase in basal LH. A number of metabolites and structural variations of 3HP were examined in this in vitro system at concentrations of 10(-12)-10(-6) M, and none exhibited a similar selective FSH-suppressing activity as 3HP. The data suggest that the selective FSH-suppressing effect of 3HP seen previously in vivo and here in vitro is due to 3HP itself and not the result of a metabolite of this molecule.\r"

  ".U": "89289598\r", 
  ".W": "Pituitary stores of rat GH (rGH) and PRL (rPRL) are divisible into immediately releasable and more stable compartments representing either compartmentalized hormone within individual cells of a homogeneous population or responses of specialized cell subsets in a functionally heterogeneous population. In addition, newly synthesized rGH and rPRL can be processed either into intracellular storage or toward direct release. Fractional assignment of new hormone to these two paths can be influenced in the somatotroph by GHRH and may also represent either intracellular processes or functional heterogeneity of cells. We investigated the source, newly synthesized or stored, of hormone refilling the somatotroph and lactotroph immediately releasable pools (IRP) after their discharge by 21 mM potassium ion, 1 mM (Bu)2cAMP, 3 nM human GHRH-44, or 3 microM prostaglandin E1. Experiments were performed using perifused pituitary fragments exposed sequentially to [14C]- and [3H]leucine in association with stimulation by two 30-min pulses of the same secretagogue. Therefore, only [14C]hormone was available for release by the first stimulus, whereas both [14C]- and [3H]hormone were available for release by the second stimulus. Analysis was by specific immunoprecipitation. The first episode of stored [14C]rGH release exceeded the second episode of stored [14C]rGH release in response to each secretagogue. However, release of newly synthesized [3H]rGH in response to the second episode of stimulation exceeded the simultaneous release of stored [14C]rGH while matching or exceeding the [14C]rGH release that had occurred in the same experiment in response to the first episode of stimulation. Refilling both GH and PRL IRP stores drew primarily upon newly synthesized hormone, but with different secretagogue-specific patterns. These data confirm differential handling of new and stored rGH and rPRL within the pituitary. They are consistent with either (1) the enhanced shunting of newly synthesized hormone to IRPs within cells that are capable of compartmentalized intracellular hormone storage, or (2) the relatively complete discharge of a subset of somatotrophs and lactotrophs that are specialized to deliver pulsed hormone release, after which they are refilled by newly synthesized hormone.\r"

  ".W": "The GH receptor in adipocytes is a glycoprotein that has a half-life of less than 1 h. After 2 h of treatment with the alkaloid swainsonine, which interferes with carbohydrate processing, virtually all of the GH receptors on the surface of adipocytes are replaced with receptors whose carbohydrate side-chains are incomplete. We examined the effects of swainsonine on the responsiveness of adipose tissue to GH to determine whether these receptors, which bind GH normally, retain biological competence. In the concentration range of 100-300 ng/ml human (h) GH rapidly evokes insulin-like responses in adipose tissue or adipocytes that have been deprived of GH for at least 3 h. hGH, at concentrations ranging from 1-10 ng/ml, also increases lipolysis after a delay of at least 2 h. Pretreatment with 50 micrograms/ml swainsonine failed to influence insulin-like responsiveness to hGH, as judged by increased glucose oxidation, but nearly completely abolished the lipolytic response. Pretreatment with swainsonine, however, did not reduce lipolysis in response to isoproterenol, suggesting that signal transmission rather than the lipolytic apparatus per se had been affected. To determine whether the same receptors mediate lipolytic and insulin-like responses, the binding properties of hGH were compared to those of Da1, a chemically modified form of hGH, whose insulin-like potency is reduced relative to its lipolytic potency. Da1 and hGH were equipotent in promoting lipolysis and had an ED50 of about 3 ng/ml, but hGH was at least 6 times as potent as Da1 in promoting glucose oxidation (ED50 of 65 vs. 400 ng/ml). Scatchard plots of both Da1 and hGH binding data were linear, consistent with a single class of binding sites whose affinity for hGH was about 3.5 times higher for hGH than Da1. hGH and Da1 both produced half-maximal stimulation of glucose oxidation when about 90% of the GH receptors were occupied. In contrast, half-maximal lipolysis was produced by Da1 when 8% of GH receptors were occupied, but 21% occupancy was required for a similar effect of hGH. If a subclass of GH receptors mediates lipolysis, it is likely to comprise 10% or less of the total receptor population.\r"

  ".W": "The human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 produces a number of estrogen-regulated proteins, among which is tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Increased medium concentrations of PA activity were observed after the addition of 17 beta-estradiol to cultures of MCF-7 cells. However, in the current study these hormone-regulated increases are limited to cultures near or at confluence, but not in the preconfluent period. MCF-7 cell cultures produce either tPA activity alone or in combination with urokinase activators. At confluence, a single exposure to 17 beta-estradiol stimulates a marked transitory rise in tPA activity in the extracellular and cell-associated compartments; the peak increases were at 48 h for medium activity and 24-48 h for cell-associated activity. Sustained exposure to hormone leads to a persistent increase in activity in both compartments. Examination of the structure-function relationships of estrogen agonists, steroidal and nonsteroidal, as well as nonestrogenic steroids indicated that stimulation of PA activity was restricted to estrogen agonists. The increased activity was reflected in enhancement of tissue PA activity when viewed using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel zymography. Those cultures expressing both activators revealed no alteration of urokinase activity due to hormone addition. Antiestrogens added to MCF-7 cells not rigorously limited in exogenous estrogens selectively suppressed tissue PA activity, but not that of urokinase. These data indicate that at the point when MCF-7 cell cultures are no longer growing exponentially, addition of estrogen agonists at physiological concentrations elevates tPA activity while not altering expression of urokinase activity. The discussion suggests a possible role that this regulation may subserve in the function of breast epithelial cells.\r"

  ".W": "In the present study we have examined the in vivo effects of thyroid hormone and TRH on secretory tissue concentrations of TRH and TRH-Gly (pGlu-His-Pro-Gly), a TRH precursor. Within secretory granules, TRH-Gly is converted to TRH through alpha-amidation of the C-terminal proline residue, using Gly as the NH2 donor. Using specific RIA, we measured the TRH-Gly immunoreactivity (TRH-Gly-IR) and TRH-IR concentrations in tissues from the reproductive and gastrointestinal systems, adrenals, and other internal organs in euthyroid, hypothyroid, and T4-treated 250-g Sprague-Dawley male rats. TRH-Gly-IR concentrations were more than 2-fold higher than TRH-IR concentrations within the adrenal, pancreas, bowel, and stomach at the time of death. Untreated hypothyroidism and exogenous TRH significantly increased adrenal TRH-Gly-IR levels. Pancreatic TRH-Gly levels increased about 2-fold in hypothyroid rats. Incubation at 60 C significantly increased TRH-Gly-IR levels in the pancreas, adrenal, bowel, stomach, and epididymis by 14-, 3-, 6-, 6-, and 6-fold, respectively. Also after 60 C incubation increases in the TRH-Gly-IR/TRH-IR ratio of 2.7-, 4-, and 1.7-fold were observed in the pancreas, epididymis, and bowel, respectively. Pooled tissue extracts were fractionated by cation exchange and reverse phase HPLC for characterization of TRH-Gly-IR. Both chromatographic methods revealed a major peak of TRH-Gly-IR coeluting with synthetic TRH-Gly. Incubation at 60 C caused 13.5-, 4.1-, 1.5-, and 5-fold increments in the TRH-Gly-IR for adrenal, pancreas, prostate, and thyroid, respectively, compared to the immediately extracted control aliquots. Cation exchange and reverse phase HPLC also revealed production of higher mol wt TRH precursor peptides after incubation at 60 C for 4 or 20 h. Only the TRH-Gly-IR peak coeluting with pGlu-His-Pro-Gly was converted into TRH by rat brain alpha-amidating enzyme. The data suggest that biosynthesis of TRH occurs in rat extrahypothalamic tissues and may be modulated by thyroid status, iv TRH, and selective thermal inactivation of enzymes that convert prepro-TRH to TRH.\r"

  ".W": "Arginine vasopressin (AVP) stimulates the secretion of ACTH and TSH. Recently, affinity cytochemical techniques with a potent biotinylated analog of AVP were used to identify ACTH cells as one of the target cells. Counts showed that AVP-bound cells were 10% of the population. However, if AVP bound all corticotropes and thyrotropes, one would expect AVP to bind at least 16% of the pituitary cells. Therefore, dual cytochemical labeling protocols were used to learn if thyrotropes also bound AVP (bio-AVP). Forty-eight percent of AVP target cells contained ACTH, and 42% contained TSH beta. The percentages of AVP-bound cells were increased to 12-13% of the total pituitary cells after 1-h pretreatment in 10 nM TRH or CRH. TRH and CRH together stimulated increases to 16% of the total cells. Analysis of dual labels showed that the additional AVP-bound cells stimulated by CRH or TRH stemmed from the corticotrope or thyrotrope populations, respectively. TRH stimulated an increase in the percentage of TSH cells that bound AVP from 55% to 75%. Similarly, CRH stimulated an increase in the percentage of ACTH cells that bound AVP from 61% to 79%. In addition, the populations of cells labeled for TSH beta or ACTH antigens increased by 30% after 1 h in unlabeled AVP, supporting its direct effect on these target cells. TRH stimulated a similar increment in TSH cells. CRH pretreatment had no effect on the percentages of cells labeled for TSH or ACTH. This could be the result of loss of ACTH stores needed to identify stimulated corticotropes. Finally, analysis of the total percentages of AVP-bound TSH beta or ACTH cells suggested an overlap in the population. This stimulated the application of dual labels for ACTH and TSH beta. In populations exposed to vehicle only, 1-2% of mixed pituitary cells stored both ACTH and TSH. This unique cell type also comprised 10% of a corticotrope population enriched by counterflow centrifugation. The percentage of ACTH-TSH cells in the mixed cell population was augmented to 4.8% after 1 h in AVP. It was not affected by exposure to either TRH or CRH (or both peptides). These studies demonstrate that AVP target cells include thyrotropes, corticotropes, and unique cells that store both ACTH and TSH.\r"

To determine whether TNF is responsible for the changes in hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) function in nonthyroid illnesses, we administered synthetic human TNF to male Sprague-Dawley rats. The rats were given TNF or saline (control; both pair fed and nonpair fed) iv (six to eight per group). HPT function was tested 8 h after administration of 200 micrograms TNF/kg BW, 8 h after 5 days of 150 micrograms TNF/kg BW, and 8 h after a 3-day series of 50, 200, and 800 micrograms TNF/kg BW. The single injection of 200 micrograms TNF/kg significantly reduced (all P less than 0.05) serum TSH, T4, free T4, T3, and hypothalamic TRH compared to the corresponding hormone levels in saline-injected control rats. Serum TSH and hypothalamic TRH recovered to normal levels after 5 days of 150 micrograms/kg TNF treatment. With the increasing daily doses of TNF, serum TSH and hypothalamic TRH fell significantly. Hepatic 5'-deiodinase activity was reduced after 1 day of TNF treatment, but increased after the 3-day series of injections. TNF treatment reduced pituitary TSH beta mRNA, but did not affect alpha-subunit mRNA. TNF treatment also reduced thyroid 125I uptake and reduced thyroidal release of T4 and T3 in response to bovine TSH, but did not change the TSH response to TRH. TNF treatment reduced the binding of pituitary TSH to Concanavalin-A, indicating that it alters the glycosylation of TSH. The TSH with reduced affinity for this lectin had reduced biological activity when tested in cultured FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells. In vitro, TNF inhibited 125I uptake by cultured FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells and blocked the stimulation of [3H]thymidine uptake by these cells. The data indicate that TNF acts on the HPT axis at multiple levels and suggest that TNF is one of the mediators responsible for alterations in thyroid function tests in patients with nonthyroidal illnesses.\r"

Ovariectomized ewes received iv infusions of a mixture of FFA (166 mg/min; n = 5) or 0.9% saline (n = 4) for 10 h. Jugular blood was sampled every 15 min for 14 h, beginning 4 h before initiation of infusion. After 8 h of FFA or saline treatment, each ewe received a pituitary challenge of 10 micrograms GRF and 1 microgram GnRH, administered together as an iv bolus. Lipid infusion increased (P less than 0.01) serum FFA concentrations to levels characteristic of those in fasted sheep [23.0 +/- 0.8 mg/100 ml (mean +/- SE)]. Frequency of GH pulses (P less than 0.01) and the GH response to GRF (P less than 0.0001) were suppressed by FFA treatment. Mean serum GH concentrations increased gradually (P less than 0.01) during the 10-h infusion period in saline-treated but not lipid-treated, ewes. This finding may reflect diurnal changes in somatotrope secretory activity that are blocked by FFA. Mean serum LH concentrations, LH pulse frequency and amplitude, and the LH secretory response to GnRH were unaffected by FFA or saline infusion. In agreement with previous work in sheep and other species, these results provide evidence for an inhibitory effect of FFA on GH release. The exact mechanism responsible for this action, however, remains to be elucidated. Finally, acutely elevated FFA levels do not appear to influence LH secretion in the ovariectomized ewe.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of a newly developed oral agent, prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) analogue TFC 612, on diabetic neuropathy was studied by giving it for 6 wk to streptozocin-induced diabetic rats that had been diabetic for 3 mo and was compared with the effects of aldose reductase inhibitor ONO 2235. Although both compounds improved decreased motor nerve conduction velocity, the effect of TFC 612 continued during the 6 wk of treatment, whereas that of ONO 2235 became weaker from wk 4. The abnormality in sciatic nerve sorbitol and myo-inositol levels was reversed with ONO 2235, whereas it was unchanged with TFC 612. With the laser Doppler flowmetry technique, a decrease in the sciatic nerve blood flow in diabetic rats was shown to improve with both compounds, but TFC 612 had a greater effect than ONO 2235, and the increased lactate level of the diabetic nerve was corrected with both compounds, suggesting that both may be associated with the amelioration of ischemia in the diabetic endoneurium. Both TFC 612 and ONO 2235 partially but significantly normalized decreased fiber size in diabetic rats. On the other hand, TFC 612 completely normalized the dilated lumen area in diabetic rats, whereas ONO 2235 did not. These results suggest that the PGE1 analogue TFC 612 has a significant effect on diabetic neuropathy, possibly via vasotropic action, and may be a potent compound for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the role of the aldose reductase pathway in the pathogenesis of the nephropathy of rats with sever (non-insulin-treated) streptozocin-induced diabetes of 6 mo duration. The initial experiment included four groups of rats: diabetic and control animals on a 20% protein diet, which were untreated or treated with sorbinil (an aldose reductase inhibitor). Food intake was increased by diabetes but was uninfluenced by sorbinil, whereas urinary urea nitrogen excretion was increased and body weight was decreased by both variables. Glomerular basement membrane (GBM) width was increased by diabetes and decreased by sorbinil. No other structural changes were noted. We speculated that sorbinil could have slowed the abnormal rate of GBM thickening in diabetic rats and the normal increase in GBM width in control rats by inducing a mild catabolic state. The second experiment also involved four groups of rats: diabetic and control animals on a 50% protein diet, which were untreated or treated with sorbinil. In these studies, diabetes was again associated with reduced body weight, but sorbinil had no influence on urinary urea nitrogen. Urinary albumin excretion, which was increased by diabetes, was not affected by sorbinil. GBM width was increased by diabetes, but in contrast to animals on 20% protein diets, the animals on 50% protein diets and treated with sorbinil did not have reduced GBM widths. Mesangial volume fraction was greater in diabetic animals than in controls, and sorbinil largely prevented mesangial expansion in them. Surprisingly, the control animals on the 50% protein diet and given sorbinil had increased mesangial volume fraction compared with control rats on the same diet not given the drug.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this study we investigated the molecular biology of lymphokine-induced expression of the class I and II MHC genes in subclones of the rat insulinoma cell line RINm5F. Treatment of a particular subclone of RINm5F cells (which are normally class II negative, class I low expressors) with crude lymphokine preparation or various doses of recombinant interferon-gamma resulted in enhancement of MHC class I antigen expression but no detectable induction of class II antigen expression. This enhancement of class I antigen expression was a dose-dependent phenomenon and was preceded by a dose-dependent increase in class I-specific RNA. Both class I and II genes were induced at the transcriptional level, as determined by Northern blotting and in vitro nuclear transcription assays, but exhibited strikingly different induction kinetics. Supernatants from concanavalin A-stimulated splenocytes had a similar class I-restricted inductive effect on MHC gene expression. This subclone of RINm5F cells, which exhibits a class I lymphokine response-positive, class II response-negative phenotype, 1) mimics the behavior of beta-cells in the prediabetic and newly diabetic pancreas and 2) represents a valuable system for probing the similarities and differences in the lymphokine-mediated induction pathways for class I and II MHC genes.\r"

In each method, the pancreases were minced and followed by 1) no collagenase digestion, 2) 5 min of collagenase digestion, or 3) 14 min of collagenase digestion. The culture conditions prevented adherence of the fragments. Culture for 6-7 wk of minced fetal pancreas without collagenase digestion resulted in fragments that were a mixture of cells positive for insulin or glucagon, ducts, necrotic debris, and other unidentified cells with complete degeneration of the acinar cells. Culture of minced pancreas digested for 5 min with collagenase resulted in fragments that superficially appeared to be islets but did not have the size characteristics of human fetal islets and contained fibrous and duct elements not seen in islets. Culture of minced pancreas digested for 14 min with collagenase resulted in islets that were released into the medium and harvested by picking. These islets were morphologically similar to islets of the intact human fetal pancreas and isolated islets from rat neonatal pancreas. These islets and fragments were viable for at least 7-8 wk in culture.\r"

Upon specific schistosomicidal treatment, however, fibrosis undergoes a marked reversal. The features of this process as regards collagen metabolism were examined in mice using praziquantel as the schistosomicidal drug, which was given 68 days after infection. It was found that collagenase activity in the liver, for both latent and active forms, increases rapidly until 5 days after treatment as compared to nontreated infected mice and then diminishes gradually. The hydroxyproline content in liver and (24-hr) urine are also modified, their values decreasing progressively up to 72 days after treatment without, however, reaching values observed in normal mice. Worm death appears to be the triggering stimulus of these events.\r"

In the present study, low doses of nitroglycerin (7 to 15 micrograms per min, i.v.) were administered in 11 patients with cirrhosis in order to unload cardiopulmonary baroreceptor--one of the possible mechanisms by which nitroglycerin may improve splanchnic hemodynamics--and moreover to avoid deleterious systemic effects. Nitroglycerin significantly decreased right atrial pressure (-35%) and pulmonary wedged pressure (-27%) with significant increase in plasma norepinephrine concentration (+23%), which indicated that cardiopulmonary baroreceptor unloading was achieved. Changes in systemic hemodynamics were slight, although significant, with a decrease in arterial pressure (-8%) and an increase in heart rate (+8%); this indicates a minimal effect on high-pressure baroreflexes. In contrast, no significant change was observed in hepatic venous pressure gradient, hepatic blood flow and azygos blood flow. However, the fraction of cardiac output reaching the azygos system significantly increased by 18%. Plasma renin activity did not change significantly. Moreover, O2 transport and uptake were significantly decreased. These findings show that low doses of nitroglycerin failed to improve splanchnic hemodynamics in patients with cirrhosis. These results suggest an impaired cardiopulmonary baroreflex function which is probably located on the efferent arch.\r"

  ".W": "There are differences in the renal handling of sodium between spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and their normotensive controls. We investigated whether this difference may be associated with changes in plasma and tissue atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) levels and with alterations in glomerular ANF receptors at 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks of age. Age-matched Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and Wistar rats were used as normotensive controls. Systolic blood pressure was higher in SHR at 8, 12, and 16 weeks, and cardiac hypertrophy was also present in these animals at 4 weeks. Plasma ANF C- and N-terminal concentrations were greater than in both normotensive groups at 8 and 16 weeks. ANF in the right atrium was higher in SHR than in WKY rats and identical to that in the Wistar group at 4 and 8 weeks. ANF in the left atrium was lower in SHR than in both control groups at week 12. No differences were found in ventricular ANF content. The density of glomerular ANF binding sites increased with age in WKY and Wistar rats but not in SHR. At weeks 8, 12, and 16, both normotensive groups had a higher density of binding sites than SHR, but binding site affinity was greater in SHR at weeks 8 and 12. After incubation with increasing concentrations of ANF, the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) by isolated glomeruli from 16-week-old rats was lower in SHR than in both normotensive groups. We conclude that the development of hypertension in SHR is associated with higher plasma ANF levels and decreased glomerular ANF receptor density and glomerular cGMP production.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cultured VSMC were obtained from renal arteries of 14-week-old Wistar-Kyoto rats by explant method. Micromolar concentrations of dexamethasone (DEX) pretreatment for 48 hours potentiated DA-mediated response without any change of affinity constant. However, micromolar concentrations of aldosterone pretreatment for 48 hours had almost no effect on DA-mediated response. The DEX-induced facilitation began at 6 hours and reached maximum at 24 hours after DEX administration in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibitors of protein and RNA synthesis blocked this glucocorticoid effect. The basal activity of adenylate cyclase in DEX-treated cells was twofold higher than that in control cells. Treatment of VSMC with DEX increased cholera toxin-stimulated and forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. However, pertussis toxin treatment did not augment or reduce the effect of DEX treatment. These results suggest that glucocorticoids increase DA-mediated cAMP formation by VSMC through glucocorticoid type II receptors and the induction of protein synthesis and that the activation of the catalytic unit may play some role in this facilitation.\r"

The effects of 4 weeks of 8% NaCl diet were studied in conscious, male DR and DS rats in which vascular and urinary catheters had been previously implanted. Results were compared with those obtained from control groups of DR and DS rats on 4 weeks of 1% NaCl diet. DR rats on 8% salt diet did not develop hypertension, and cardiac output and blood volume were unchanged; glomerular filtration rate, urinary flow, sodium excretion, and plasma atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) increased. DS rats on 8% salt diet developed hypertension, and cardiac output and blood volume increased; glomerular filtration rate, urinary flow, and sodium excretion did not change, despite an increase in ANF. DS and DR rats on 1% NaCl diet were subjected to ANF infusion. After ANF infusion DR rats had a decreased blood volume and an increased glomerular filtration rate, urinary flow, and sodium excretion; DS rats showed no significant changes in blood volume, glomerular filtration rate, urinary flow, or sodium excretion. ANF caused vasodilation in all regions studied in DR rats; DS rats showed vasodilation in all regions except the kidney. After acute volume expansion, although both DR and DS rats responded by an increase in cardiac output, only DS rats developed prolonged hypertension. This finding suggests an inadequate vasodilatory mechanism in DS rats. In response to acute volume expansion, renal resistance decreased in DR rats but not in DS rats. It is concluded that the primary hemodynamic disturbance in DS rats with salt-induced hypertension is an increase in cardiac output caused by blood volume expansion in the absence of any vasodilation. Comparison of the responses of DS and DR rats to high salt diets, ANF infusion, and acute volume expansion indicates that the salt-induced hypertension in DS rats is initiated by a diminished renal response to ANF.\r"

  ".W": "Atrial natriuretic factor was infused in a low dose (0.2 microgram/min) during 5 days in six patients with essential hypertension. Atrial natriuretic factor infusion caused plasma levels of atrial natriuretic factor to increase from 49 +/- 10 to 106 +/- 19 pg/ml. Within 4 hours after the start of the atrial natriuretic factor infusion, urinary sodium excretion increased in all subjects. Sodium balance was regained after 24 hours with a net loss of 72.3 +/- 14.6 mmol. However, systolic as well as diastolic blood pressure started to decrease gradually in all subjects only after 12 hours of atrial natriuretic factor infusion, reaching a stable level after 36 hours with a decrease of 11.5 +/- 1.5% and 10.3 +/- 0.8%, respectively. Heart rate increased in parallel by 12.6 +/- 3.1%. Hematocrit rose 7.1 +/- 2.3%. After cessation of atrial natriuretic factor infusion, plasma atrial natriuretic factor levels, sodium balance, and hematocrit returned to baseline within 24 hours, whereas blood pressure slowly returned toward baseline values over 3 days. These data show that chronic atrial natriuretic factor infusion in patients with essential hypertension causes a negative sodium balance and a rise in hematocrit, followed by a smooth decrease in blood pressure with a rise in heart rate until a new equilibrium is reached after approximately 2 days. Thus, atrial natriuretic factor in low doses appears intimately involved in the regulation of sodium balance and blood pressure in humans. Moreover, these data suggest that atrial natriuretic factor-like substances will eventually become useful antihypertensive drugs.\r"

The average discrepancy between finger and intra-arterial blood pressure recorded over a 30-minute rest period was 6.5 +/- 2.6 mm Hg and 5.4 +/- 2.9 mm Hg for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively; a close between-method correspondence was also demonstrated by linear regression analysis. The beat-to-beat changes in finger systolic and diastolic blood pressure were on average similar to those measured intra-arterially during tests that induced a pressor or depressor response (hand-grip, cold pressor test, diving test, Valsalva maneuver, intravenous injections of phenylephrine and trinitroglycerine) as well as during tests that caused vasomotor changes without major variations in blood pressure (application of lower body negative pressure, passive leg raising). The average between-method discrepancy in the evaluation of blood pressure changes was never greater than 4.3 and 2.0 mm Hg for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively; the corresponding standard deviations ranged between 4.6 and 1.6 mm Hg. Beat-to-beat computer analysis of blood pressure variability over the 30-minute rest period provided standard deviations almost identical when calculated by separate consideration of intra-arterial and finger blood pressure tracings (3.7 and 3.8 mm Hg, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purification scheme involved large scale dialysis, extraction of lyophilized dialysate by methanol followed by preparative and semipreparative scale reverse-phase high-performance chromatography. A single peak of biologically active material was obtained enriched by a factor of greater than 10 billion. This material showed high chromatographic polarity, was inactivated by charring, strong acid, or alkali, and was resistant to short-term boiling. The purified material had a molecular weight between 300 and 900 g/mol and was insensitive to type I esterase and a variety of proteolytic enzymes. The purified factor inhibited the ouabain-sensitive uptake of 86Rb by human erythrocytes, binding of [3H]ouabain, and activity of dog kidney Na,K-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) with high affinity (less than 0.3 nM) in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Maximally effective concentrations of the digitalislike factor showed no effect on either human red blood cell Mg- or Ca-ATPase, rabbit muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase, or guinea pig stomach H,K-ATPase. The purified material is a highly potent selective inhibitor of the ion transport, receptor, and hydrolytic functions of the sodium pump. The characteristic properties of this substance suggest it may be a mammalian endogenous digitalis and may be similar to the sodium transport inhibitor detected in the plasma of volume-sensitive forms of experimental and human hypertension.\r"

These cells, as visualized by immunocryoultramicrotomy, contain immunoreactive ANF in their secretory granules and their Golgi complex and exhibit ANF mRNA, as visualized by in situ hybridization with an ANF complementary RNA probe. The content of immunoreactive ANF and ANF mRNA of the Purkinje fibers is midway between that of atrial and ventricular working cardiocytes. High-pressure liquid chromatography analysis of immunoreactive ANF using antibodies against the C-terminal and N-terminal moieties of the molecule indicates that part of immunoreactive ANF contained in Purkinje fibers is the propeptide [Asn1,Tyr126]ANF whereas part was nonspecifically cleaved into C-terminal and N-terminal ANF. The chordae tendineae spuriae exhibit binding sites for ANF (Kd:approximately 1.0 nM; Bmax:approximately 2.3 fmol/mg). ANF profoundly decreases basal and stimulated (epinephrine, dopamine, isoproterenol, and forskolin) adenylate cyclase activity and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) levels. ANF has little effect on norepinephrine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity or on norepinephrine-stimulated cyclic AMP levels. ANF produces only a slight increase in guanylate cyclase activity and cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels at high (10(7)-10(6) M) concentrations. These results suggest an autocrine function for ANF in the modulation of the impulse in the peripheral conduction cells (Purkinje fibers) of the rabbit through changes in second messenger levels.\r"

  ".W": "The natriuretic effects of atrial peptide hormones have been attributed, at least in part, to their stimulation of guanylate cyclase activity in renal cell membranes. The effects of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) on stimulation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation were investigated in cloned human kidney tumor (hKT) cells and parent cells from a human renal tumor epithelial cell line (SK-NEP-1). Human ANF-(99-126) (10(-6)M) stimulated (p less than 0.001) cellular cGMP accumulation in a dose-dependent manner from a basal level of 0.26 +/- 0.04 to 3.73 +/- 0.81 pmol/mg protein/5 mi (mean +/- SEM, n = 13). ANF stimulation of cGMP accumulation was specific, in that high concentrations (10(-6)M) of atriopeptin I [rat ANF-(103-123)], angiotensin II, arginine vasopressin, and amiloride (10(-4)M) did not increase basal cGMP. Amiloride (10(-4)M) enhanced (p less than 0.01, n = 6) the ANF stimulation of cGMP accumulation (1.24 +/- 0.39 pmol/mg protein/5 min), particularly at low doses of ANF (10(-10)M) where stimulation by ANF without amiloride (0.34 +/- 0.08 pmol/mg protein/5 min) was barely distinguishable from a basal level (0.19 +/- 0.02 pmol/mg protein/5 min) of cGMP accumulation. The stimulatory effect of ANF (1.59 +/- 0.07 pmol/mg protein/5 min) was attenuated (0.75 +/- 0.06 pmol/mg protein/5 min, p less than 0.01, n = 6) by preincubation of the cells with pertussis toxin but not by cholera toxin. ANF (4.56 +/- 0.93 pmol/mg protein/5 min, n = 8) did not affect cAMP accumulation (4.32 +/- 0.98 pmol/mg protein/5 min) in hKT cells. This is the first report of an ANF responsive human renal cell line, and its use should facilitate investigation of ANF-receptor interactions.\r"

Central and peripheral neural tissues from both strains were processed under rigorous antiproteolytic conditions, which were monitored by degradation of purified and iodo-labeled proANF or synthetic ANF[Ser99, Tyr126]. The extracted material was separated on a reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography system, and eluates were determined for immunoreactive ANF with radioimmunoassays, employing antibodies directed against two different fragments of the ANF prohormone. The chromatographic pattern of immunoreactive-ANF elution showed the clear presence of proANF in all neural tissues studied. This pattern also included an intermediate ANF and COOH-terminal of proANF whose relative varying content was tissue dependent. Superior cervical ganglia contained most of the immunoreactive ANF corresponding to proANF and intermediate ANF. Total immunoreactive ANF in the hypothalamus, brainstem, and upper and lower parts of the spinal cord was always higher in spontaneously hypertensive than in Wistar-Kyoto rats. However, there was no difference in the content of the main molecular forms of ANF in any of their neural tissues. We suggest that the increase in neural ANF in spontaneously hypertensive rats does not arise from posttranslational alterations and may indicate an enhanced ANF synthesis rate or accumulation, or both.\r"

  ".W": "The cellular mechanisms underlying the agonist-induced sustained contraction of the vascular smooth muscle are reviewed in the light of the use of Ca2+ and the change of Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile apparatus. It is generally accepted that the main trigger for contraction of vascular smooth muscle is the elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration. However, the measurement of intracellular Ca2+ concentration during the sustained phase of agonist-induced contraction is reported to be lower than that of high K+ stimulation or the value obtained by the experiments with chemically skinned smooth muscle preparations. These observations indicate that a second regulatory system may exist. One possible mechanism is the effectiveness of Ca2+ use. Agonist-induced Ca2+ influx may be more effective in raising the intracellular Ca2+ in the bulk of the cytoplasm than is Ca2+ entry induced by depolarization by the inhibition of a putative sarcoplasmic reticulum buffer barrier. Another possibility is the change of Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile apparatus. Although the survey of the recent literature concerning the phorbol ester-induced vasoconstriction tends to support a role for protein kinase C in the change of Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile proteins, it fails to establish a clear link between receptors, protein kinase C, and myofilaments. By using new methods for permeabilizing smooth muscle fibers, which retain the function of receptors and signal transduction systems, we now provide direct evidence that the activation of G protein by norepinephrine or guanosine 5'-0-(3-triphosphate) (GTP-gamma-S), nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue, enhances myofilament sensitivity to Ca2+.\r"

  ".U": "89290971\r", 
  ".W": "To determine if oxygen-derived free radicals are mediators of endothelium-dependent contractions to acetylcholine in the aorta of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), the mechanism of contraction to xanthine plus xanthine oxidase was studied. Rings, with and without endothelium, of thoracic aorta from normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and SHR were suspended in organ chambers for isometric tension recording. Oxygen-derived free radicals caused concentration-dependent contractions; these contractions were twice as large in the aortas of SHR than in WKY rats. Deferoxamine reversed the response to xanthine oxidase to a small relaxation. Either allopurinol, superoxide dismutase, or catalase, or the combination of superoxide dismutase plus catalase reduced the contractions. Diltiazem inhibited the response to xanthine oxidase; in contrast, phentolamine plus propranolol did not affect it. Indomethacin and meclofenamate, but not tranylcypromine or dazoxiben blocked the contractions. Endothelium-dependent contractions to acetylcholine in aortas from the SHR were not affected by deferoxamine or superoxide dismutase plus catalase. These data suggest that hydroxyl radicals cause contractions in the rat aorta, which are dependent on extracellular calcium and mediated by activation of the cyclooxygenase in the vascular smooth muscle. The augmented contractions in the hypertensive strain are due to an increased reactivity of the smooth muscle to oxygen-derived free radicals. However, the lack of effect of the scavengers on endothelium-dependent contractions to acetylcholine suggests that the endothelium-derived contracting factor is chemically different from oxygen-derived free radicals.\r"

The polar and less polar compounds were eluted off the C18 reverse-phase column with 18% and 31% acetonitrile, respectively. The polar compound cross-reacted very weakly with specific antidigoxin antibody and lacked a characteristic ultraviolet absorption peak between 190 and 300 nm. The less polar compound showed a prominent digoxinlike immunoreactivity and had an ultraviolet spectrum similar to that of digoxin. We examined the effects of these compounds on cytosolic free calcium concentration in cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells (A10 cells) using the fluorescent calcium chelator fura-2. Only the polar ouabain-displacing compound caused a significant increase, from 108 +/- 7 to 162 +/- 8 nM (n = 6, p less than 0.01), in cytosolic free calcium concentration in A10 cells. The rise in cytosolic free calcium concentration induced by the polar ouabain-displacing compound tended to be slower in onset and more sustained than that induced by arginine vasopressin. In contrast, ouabain and bufalin had no appreciable effects on cytosolic free calcium concentration in A10 cells. These results suggest that the polar ouabain-displacing compound we isolated from human urine may possess a vasoactive property and may play an important role in the modulation of vascular tone.\r"

Male Wistar rats, divided into three groups, received a 5-minute intra-arterial infusion of the bradykinin antagonist [( DArgo-Hyp3-Thi5,8-DPhe7]BK-TFA) at 250 micrograms/min. Groups were either intact rats (group I, n = 5), pretreated with indomethacin (group II, n = 10), or pretreated with both indomethacin and prazosin (group III, n = 8). The bradykinin antagonist infusion, which was shown to inhibit exogenous bradykinin by greater than 76% in intact animals, did not alter mean arterial pressure in group I rats despite a twofold increase in norepinephrine and a threefold increase in epinephrine. Group II rats presented a progressive increase in mean arterial pressure during the bradykinin antagonist infusion (14 +/- 3 mm Hg), with no statistically significant change in plasma catecholamines. Group III, with lower baseline mean arterial pressure due to alpha 1-adrenergic blockade, had an increase in mean arterial pressure comparable with group II during bradykinin antagonist infusion (22 +/- 5 mm Hg), confirming that this response was not sympathetically mediated. We conclude that in normotensive rats bradykinin plays a role in blood pressure regulation that is closely linked to that of prostaglandins and that points to a balance between these systems.\r"

Hemodynamics and renal function were continuously monitored during 30 minutes of human ANF infusion (10 ng/kg.min) and throughout a 30-minute recovery period. Ten minutes into the infusion period, plasma levels of ANF were elevated (p less than 0.01) by 34 +/- 9 from 36 +/- 5 pg/ml and sodium excretion increased (p less than 0.05) by 34 +/- 7 from 67 +/- 9 mueq/min. At that time, urine flow did not differ from baseline (0.25 +/- 0.03 ml/min). Renal blood flow velocity fell (p less than 0.01) by 5.0 +/- 0.5 from 42.3 +/- 3.7 cm/sec. Thirty minutes into the infusion period, plasma ANF levels were increased (p less than 0.01) by 61 +/- 9 pg/ml, similar to levels found after rapid volume expansion in conscious dogs. Urine flow and sodium excretion were elevated (p less than 0.01) by 0.35 +/- 0.06 ml/min and by 65 +/- 12 mueq/min, respectively. Renal blood flow velocity was reduced (p less than 0.05) by 4.4 +/- 1.5 cm/sec. Neither right atrial pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, mean arterial pressure, the first derivative of left ventricular pressure over time (dP/dt), nor heart rate were influenced by the elevated ANF plasma levels. Circulating levels of vasopressin and aldosterone were unaltered by these increases in plasma ANF. Thirty minutes into the recovery period, all variables were similar to the preinfusion baseline. Thus, in conscious dogs, physiologically relevant increases in plasma levels of ANF reached diuretic and natriuretic thresholds.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In attempting to discern possible mechanisms underlying this depressor response, we examined the ability of endothelin to release atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) from isolated, spontaneously contracting atria from SHR and WKY. Isolated right atria were suspended under 3.0 g of resting force in tissue baths with the amount of immunoreactive ANF (irANF) released after exposure to endothelin assessed by radioimmunoassay. Endothelin (10(-8) and 10(-7) M) caused a concentration-dependent increase (1.5-4.5-fold) in the release of irANF, which was significantly greater in atria of SHR compared with WKY. The greater release of irANF in atria of SHR versus WKY was not related to tissue weight or changes in contractile rate or force induced by endothelin. Therefore, endothelin appears to cause a direct release of irANF from rat right atria in vitro. As found for the depressor response in vivo, endothelin is more efficacious in the hypertensive compared with the normotensive atrial preparation. Release of ANF may be important in the hypotensive response to endothelin in vivo.\r"

Administration of digoxin antibody in a dose binding 0.25 mg digoxin to the spontaneously hypertensive rats before cross circulation prevented the transmission of hypertension to the normotensive rat, whereas chemical sympathectomy with 6-hydroxydopamine and intravenous injection of inactive Fab fragments had no inhibitory effect. It is concluded that, in this strain of spontaneously hypertensive rats, a circulating hypertensive factor exists. The factor binds to digoxin antibody and is not produced in sympathetic nervous tissue.\r"

SQ 29,072 (100 mumol/kg i.v.) prolonged the transient depressor effects of the peptide for as long as 2 hours. During the first hour after 3, 10, and 30 nmol/kg atrial natriuretic factor, urinary excretion of cyclic 3'5' guanosine monophosphate was significantly increased by 9.2 +/- 3.4, 13.0 +/- 2.2, and 12.7 +/- 4.2 nmol/kg/hr, respectively, in vehicle-treated rats and by 26.9 +/- 7.9, 52.1 +/- 11.1, and 46.4 +/- 12.2 nmol/kg/hr, respectively, in rats given 100 mumol/kg SQ 29,072. During the first hour after 3 and 10 nmol/kg atrial natriuretic factor-(99-126), the sodium loss was 161 +/- 56 and 139 +/- 42 mueq/kg/hr in vehicle-treated rats and was significantly greater (694 +/- 316 and 1,038 +/- 135 mueq/kg/hr) in rats given 100 mumol/kg SQ 29,072. After administration of 3, 10, and 30 mumol/kg SQ 29,072, the area over the curves of the depressor responses to 3 nmol/kg of the peptide increased from 297 +/- 70 to 306 +/- 108, 440 +/- 143, and 669 +/- 186 mm Hg.min, respectively, while the concurrent natriuretic responses rose from 161 +/- 56 to 250 +/- 88, 332 +/- 142, 464 +/- 164, and 694 +/- 316 mueq/kg/hr. In summary, the neutral endopeptidase inhibitor SQ 29,072 increased the magnitudes and especially the durations of the depressor, natriuretic, and cyclic guanosine monophosphate responses to exogenous atrial natriuretic factor-(99-126) in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats, presumably by inhibition of degradation of atrial natriuretic factor in vivo. In conclusion, neutral endopeptidase inhibition offers an important new technique for enhancement and prolongation of the biological lifetime of atrial natriuretic factor.\r"

Bed rest had no significant influence on these parameters. WI raised plasma volume (PV) to the same extent in both groups. This increase of PV was accompanied by significant suppression of PRA, ALD and VP and an increase of plasma ANP. In HTP basal plasma ANP was significantly elevated and the ANP response to central hypervolemia reduced. Significantly elevated VP plasma levels were also found in HTP. These endocrine abnormalities in HTP seem to be caused by latent failure of the transplanted heart. No direct correlation was found between plasma ANP and PRA, ALD and VP under basal conditions and after WI in either HTP or normals.\r"

We have established the structure of PSP-S mRNA and monitored its expression in chronic calcifying pancreatitis (CCP). A cDNA encoding pre-PSP-S has been cloned from a human pancreatic cDNA library. Its nucleotide sequence revealed that it comprised all but the 5' end of PSP-S mRNA, which was obtained by sequencing the first exon of the PSP-S gene. The complete mRNA sequence is 775 nucleotides long, including 5'- and 3'- noncoding regions of 80 and 197 nucleotides, respectively, attached to a poly(A) tail of approximately 125 nucleotides. It encodes a preprotein of 166 amino acids, including a prepeptide of 22 amino acids. No overall sequence homology was found between PSP-S and other pancreatic proteins. Some homology with several serine proteases was observed in the COOH-terminal region, however. The mRNA levels of PSP-S, trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, and colipase in CCP and control pancreas were compared. PSP-S mRNA was three times lower in CCP than in control, whereas the others were not altered. It was concluded that PSP-S gene expression is specifically reduced in CCP patients.\r"

  ".W": "To explain the pathophysiological significance of endogenous atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP) in the development of hypertension, we examined the effect of chronic, repetitive administrations of MAb raised against alpha-rat ANP in two rat models of hypertension, spontaneously hypertensive rats of the stroke prone substrain (SHR-SP), and deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt rats. Weekly intravenous administrations of MAb with high affinity for alpha-rat ANP, named KY-ANP-II (MAb[KY-ANP-II]), started at the age of 6 wk, significantly augmented the rise in blood pressure of SHR-SP, compared with control SHR-SP treated with another MAb with quite low affinity for alpha-rat ANP, named KY-ANP-I (MAb[KY-ANP-I]), throughout the observation period. The administrations of MAb[KY-ANP-II] had no significant effect on blood pressure of age-matched normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats, compared with those receiving MAb[KY-ANP-I]. Weekly administrations of MAb[KY-ANP-II] also significantly aggravated hypertension in DOCA-salt rats. Blood pressure of DOCA-salt rats treated with MAb[KY-ANP-II] was significantly higher than that of DOCA-salt rats treated with MAb[KY-ANP-I] throughout 8 wk of DOCA and 1% saline administration. The administration of MAb[KY-ANP-II] also significantly attenuated exaggerated diuresis and natriuresis in DOCA-salt rats compared with those treated with MAb[KY-ANP-I]. Elevated plasma cGMP levels of both SHR-SP and DOCA-salt rats were significantly reduced by the administration of MAb[KY-ANP-II]. These results suggest the compensatory role of augmented secretion of ANP in these hypertensive rats and support the concept that augmented secretion of ANP could represent an antihypertensive deterrent mechanism.\r"

Investigation of the pathophysiology of the exercise response in the patient revealed low maximal oxygen uptake (1/3 that of normal sedentary women) in cycle exercise and impaired muscle oxygen extraction as indicated by profoundly low maximal systemic arteriovenous oxygen difference (5.8 ml/dl; controls = 15.4 +/- 1.4, mean +/- SD). The increases in cardiac output and ventilation during exercise, normally closely coupled to muscle metabolic rate, were markedly exaggerated (more than two- to threefold normal) relative to oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide production accounting for prominent tachycardia and dyspnea at low workloads. Symptoms in our patient are similar to those reported in other human skeletal muscle respiratory chain defects involving complexes I and III, and the exaggerated circulatory response resembles that seen during experimental inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. These results suggest that impaired oxidative phosphorylation in working muscle disrupts the normal regulation of cardiac output and ventilation relative to muscle metabolic rate in exercise.\r"

To identify potentially protective antigens of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, 37 human pleural fluid B cell clones were established using EBV and their supernatants assayed by ELISA and Western blot for antibody reactivity with M. tuberculosis sonicate and culture filtrate. One antibody identified 29,000, 31,000, and 33,000 bands in culture filtrate, and 31,000, 33,000, and 47,000 bands in sonicate; its species reactivity by ELISA was limited to M. tuberculosis. Eight antibodies identified a 31,000 band in culture filtrate and a 68,000 band in M. tuberculosis sonicate, suggesting recognition of a secreted antigen. The species crossreactivity of these eight antibodies extended to M. avium. Six antibodies identified multiple bands and had crossreactivity that included M. avium and M. kansasii. There was no reactivity with recombinant M. tuberculosis 65,000 antigen. Tuberculous pleurisy may prove useful in the identification of potentially protective mycobacterial antigens, particularly those secreted during active infection, and thus accessible to the human immune response.\r"

In the present study the effects of intravascular administration of hemolysin were investigated in isolated blood-free perfused rabbit lungs. Low concentrations of the toxin in the perfusate (0.05-5 hemolytic units/ml, corresponding to approximately 5-500 ng/ml), caused a dose- and time-dependent release of potassium, thromboxane A2, and prostaglandin I2, but not of lactate dehydrogenase, into the recirculating medium, as well as a dose-dependent liberation of the prostanoids into the bronchoalveolar space. These events were paralleled by a dose-dependent pulmonary hypertension, and studies with different inhibitors collectively indicated that the vasoconstrictor response was mediated predominantly by pulmonary thromboxane generation. In addition, E. coli hemolysin elicited a protracted, dose-dependent increase in the lung capillary filtration coefficient, which was independent of the prostanoid-mediated pressor response and resulted in severe pulmonary edema formation. We conclude that E. coli hemolysin can elicit thromboxane-mediated pulmonary hypertension combined with severe vascular leakage in isolated lungs in the absence of circulating inflammatory cells and humoral mediator systems, mimicking the key events in the development of acute respiratory failure in states of septicemia.\r"

Pharmacologic stimulation of adenylate cyclase in cardiac membranes with isoproterenol, fluoride ion, guanine nucleotide, forskolin, and manganous ion indicated that there was defective coupling of the guanine nucleotide-binding protein that stimulates adenylate cyclase (Gs) to adenylate cyclase. Cyc complementation assays revealed congruent to 50% less Gs activity in cardiac and skeletal muscle from cardiomyopathic hamsters. Despite this decrease in functional Gs, there were no changes in immunologic levels of the alpha-subunit of Gs (alpha Gs) or in levels of mRNA encoding alpha Gs. The defect in Gs bioactivity was limited to cardiac and skeletal muscle, occurred only in animals homozygous for the dystrophic trait, and was demonstrable before any cardiac abnormalities were evident on light microscopy. By contrast, cardiac levels of beta-adrenergic receptors were not different in cardiac membranes from BIO 14.6 hamsters. We conclude that a functional defect in alpha Gs may contribute to a contractile abnormalities in the cardiomyopathic BIO 14.6 hamster. However, the etiology of the alpha Gs defect remains obscure.\r"

In this study, the extracellular matrix gene expression by these cells was examined under culture conditions that allowed them to be metabolically active and readily identifiable by morphologic and immunocytochemical criteria. Northern hybridizations demonstrated expression of genes for type I, III, IV, and VI collagens, as well as for fibronectin, laminin, and elastin. In situ hybridizations revealed that all three cell types expressed pro alpha 1 (I), pro alpha 2 (VI), and laminin B1 chain genes. However, fibroblasts did not contain [35S]cDNA-mRNA hybrids specific for type IV collagen, whereas both Schwann cells and perineurial cells expressed these genes. Perineurial cells and fibroblasts readily expressed the fibronectin gene whereas Schwann cells were essentially devoid of the corresponding mRNA. Perineurial cells also expressed the gene for laminin A chain. The results indicate that the extracellular matrix gene expression profiles of Schwann cells, perineurial cells, and fibroblasts are distinct: all three cell types are capable of expressing some of the genes for extracellular matrix components, such as type I and VI collagens, whereas Schwann cells and perineurial cells may have the primary role in synthesizing basement membrane zone components, type IV collagen and laminin. These observations potentially relate to the mechanisms of growth and development of human neurofibromas. The results attest to the applicability of the methodology utilized here to study other human tumors with mixed cell populations.\r"

We now report the turnover of isologous radioiodinated HDL apolipoproteins, apo A-I and apo A-II, in 15 female subjects on a metabolic diet with HDL-C levels ranging from 51 to 122 mg/dl. The metabolic parameters, fractional catabolic rate (FCR) and absolute synthetic rate (SR), were determined for apo A-I and apo A-II in all subjects. There was an inverse correlation between plasma HDL-C and the FCR of apo A-I and apo A-II (r = -0.75, P less than 0.001, and r = -0.54, P = 0.036, respectively), but no correlation with the SR of either apo A-I or apo A-II (r = 0.09, and r = -0.16, respectively, both P = NS). Apo A-I levels correlated inversely with apo A-I FCR (r = -0.64, P = 0.01) but not with apo A-I SR (r = 0.30, P = NS). In contrast, plasma levels of apo A-II did not correlate with apo A-II FCR (r = -0.38, P = 0.16), but did correlate with apo A-II SR (r = 0.65, P = 0.009). Further analysis showed that apo A-I and apo A-II FCR were inversely correlated with the HDL-C/apo A-I + A-II ratio (r = -0.69 and -0.61, P = 0.005 and 0.015, respectively). These data suggest that: (a) low HDL apolipoprotein FCR is the predominant metabolic mechanism of elevated HDL-C levels; (b) apo A-I FCR is the primary factor in controlling plasma apo A-I levels, but apo A-II SR is the primary factor controlling plasma apo A-II levels; (c) low HDL apolipoprotein FCR is associated with a lipid-rich HDL fraction. These findings elucidate aspects of HDL metabolism which contribute to high HDL-C levels and which may constitute mechanisms for protection against coronary heart disease.\r"

Available evidence indicates that lysine residues are prominently involved in adduct formation. Previous work has shown that lysines on tubulin can be divided into two general classes based upon their reactivity toward acetaldehyde; those of normal reactivity (\"bulk\" lysines) and a highly reactive lysine (HRL) located on the alpha-polypeptide subunit. We took advantage of the fact that the HRL is unreactive when tubulin is in the microtubule form to differentiate the effects of bulk from HRL adducts on tubulin polymerization. Under conditions where both bulk lysines and HRL formed adducts, 0.2 mol acetaldehyde/mol tubulin caused complete inhibition of polymerization. When we modified bulk lysines, but not HRL, tubulin polymerized essentially normally. Finally, when we first blocked bulk lysines on microtubules (HRL unreactive) using unlabeled acetaldehyde and then measured the amount of [14C]acetaldehyde adduct formed with tubulin after depolymerization (HRL reactive), 0.08 mol acetaldehyde/mol tubulin resulted in completely impaired polymerization. These data show that microtubule formation is very sensitive to even small mole fractions of acetaldehyde-modified tubulin (especially with HRL) and further suggest that small amounts of acetaldehyde adduct could be damaging to cytoskeleton function in the cell.\r"

  ".W": "Multiple isoenzymes of the Na+,K+-ATPase (alpha, alpha+, and alpha 3) have been identified by molecular cloning (Shull, G. E., J. Greeb, and J. B. Lingrel. 1986. Biochemistry. 25:8125-8132; and Schneider, J. W., R. W. Mercer, and E. J. Benz, Jr. 1987. Clin. Res. 35:585A. [Abstr.]). At least one of these, the alpha 3 chain, represents a novel form for which protein products and enzymatic activities are just beginning to be defined in rodents. We have recently demonstrated that expression of alpha 3 is largely confined to neuromuscular tissues of fetal and adult rats (Schneider, J. W., R. W. Mercer, M. Gilmore-Hebert, M. F. Utset, C. Lai, A. Greene, and E. J. Benz, Jr. 1988. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 85:284-288). We now report that certain human leukemia cell lines including HL60, HEL, and Molt 4 express mRNA for both alpha and alpha 3 isoforms of Na+,K+-ATPase; mRNA was not detected in several other cell lines, including K562 and U937; no cell lines expressed alpha+ mRNA. In uninduced HL60 cells, alpha 3 mRNA comprised 20-30% of total Na+,K+-ATPase mRNA. Furthermore, in HL60 and HEL cells, both alpha and alpha 3 mRNA declined after induction of maturation by DMSO, retinoic acid, or hemin. However, the reduction in alpha 3 mRNA was far more dramatic. alpha 3 mRNA virtually disappeared, but alpha mRNA declined by only approximately 50%. In contrast, when maturation of HL60 cells along the monocyte/macrophage lineage was induced by exposure to phorbol esters, alpha 3 mRNA remained abundant. Moreover, mRNA for the beta subunit of the Na+,K+-ATPase increased dramatically. Our results demonstrate that the alpha 3 isoform, formerly thought to be confined to neuromuscular tissues, is expressed in restricted lineages of hematopoietic origin. These leukemia cell lines should provide a useful model for analyzing regulation of the alpha 3 isoform gene and characterization of alpha 3 isoform activities.\r"

Patch clamp studies were conducted on inside-out patches of the apical membrane of IMCD cells grown in primary culture. Guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP) and the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue, GTP gamma S, which activate G proteins, increased the open probability of the cation channel. In contrast, the nonhydrolyzable GDP analogue, GDP beta S, which decreases G protein activity, inhibited the channel. Pertussis toxin also reduced the open probability of the channel. Addition of the alpha *i-3 subunit of Gi to the solution bathing the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane increased the open probability in a dose-dependent manner (2-200 pM). The threshold concentration for activation by alpha *i-3 was 2 pM. Activation of the cation channel by alpha *i-3 was not mediated via a protein kinase. The IMCD is the first polarized epithelium in which an ion channel has been shown to be directly regulated by a G protein. Thus, G proteins are important elements in regulating sodium absorption by the IMCD.\r"

Addition of vehicle to the perfusate changed neither the transepithelial voltage (VT, in millivolts) nor the JTCO2. In contrast, the addition of omeprazole (0.1 mM) to the perfusate abolished JTCO2 (from 14.5 +/- 5.6 to -0.1 +/- 3.1 pmol.mm-1.min-1) without significantly affecting VT. In additional experiments, in 16 tubules there was significant net K absorption (JK) of 5.0 +/- 1.0 pmol.mm-1.min-1 during the basal period, which exceeded the rate of K absorption that could be attributed to a paracellular voltage-mediated pathway (JKP = 1.0 +/- 0.4 pmol.mm-1.min-1, P less than 0.01). Administration of vehicle did not significantly affect either VT or JK. However, omeprazole abolished JK (from 5.1 +/- 1.0 to 0.1 +/- 2.5 pmol.mm-1.min-1) without affecting VT or JNa. The present results demonstrate that the OMCDi possesses an active, omeprazole-sensitive acidification and K-absorptive mechanism. These findings are consistent with the presence of H-K-ATPase activity in this nephron segment.\r"

  ".W": "vWF is a multimeric glycoprotein that serves as the major carrier in plasma of Factor VIII (FVIII). We have used an anti-human vWF MAb W5-6A to investigate the FVIII binding site on vWF. W5-6A inhibited FVIII binding to vWF-coated polystyrene tubes in a concentration-dependent manner with 90% inhibition of FVIII binding at a concentration of 10 micrograms/ml. The W5-6A epitope was identified by screening a vWF fragment library using the bacteriophage expression vector lambda gt11. DNA sequence analysis of 29 immunoreactive phage clones localized the W5-6A epitope to a nonadecapeptide spanning amino acid residues threonine 78 to threonine 96 at the amino-terminus of the mature vWF polypeptide. Purified beta-galactosidase/vWF fusion protein from one of these clones, vWF9, was incubated with radiolabeled W5-6A and caused near complete inhibition of W5-6A binding to vWF. Inhibitory activity was lost after vWF9 trypsinization or reduction and alkylation. These data indicate that (a) the antigenic determinant recognized by W5-6A localizes to a nonadecapeptide at the NH2 terminus of the mature vWF polypeptide, (b) disulfide bonds within vWF9 may be necessary to maintain the structure required for immunoreactivity with W5-6A, and (c) W5-6A recognizes an immunogenic region on vWF that may be at (or near) the major FVIII binding domain.\r"

Twelve haemophiliacs (58%) were lupus anticoagulant positive, with a mean patient:control ratio of 1.24 (range 1.15-1.52, normal range 0.84-1.06 which partially corrected with lysed, washed platelets). Nine of these patients were IgG or IgM, or both, anticardiolipin antibody positive and nine were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody positive, but associations between lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and HIV antibody positivity were not significant. Mixing studies of normal plasma and immune depleted factor VIII deficient plasma showed that the DRVT ratio increased when the factor VIII concentration fell below 0.15 IU/ml. There was no significant association between plasma factor VIII concentration and positive DRVT results in haemophiliacs. The addition of porcine factor VIII concentrate produced no correction in eight of the 12 with DRVTs indicative of lupus anticoagulant, suggesting that these were prolonged by antiphospholipid activity. It is concluded that the presence of lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies in haemophiliacs may represent an antiphospholipid response to viraemic challenge, not only to HIV but also to other viral antigens, and that a very low factor VIII concentration may produce a false positive DRVT result.\r"

Doses of flecainide ranged from 59 to 225 mg/m2 body surface area per day (mean 141) in divided doses every 8 to 12 h and serum trough levels ranged from 0.10 to 0.99 micrograms/ml (mean 0.36). Flecainide controlled or partially controlled arrhythmia in 53 (84%) of the 63 patients: 7 of 7 patients who had the permanent form of junctional reciprocating tachycardia, 12 of 13 who had an atrial ectopic tachycardia, 10 of 10 who had ventricular tachycardia and 18 of 25 patients who had reentrant supraventricular tachycardia. Five of seven patients who had the latter arrhythmia were unsuccessfully treated with flecainide. They had Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and developed asymptomatic, incessant, slower orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia while receiving the drug. Transient blurred vision was reported in three patients and two patients had transient hyperactivity. No significant hemodynamic side effects were seen in any patient. Twenty-five patients underwent oral pharmacokinetic investigation. Young infants (less than 1 year of age) had a mean plasma elimination half-life (t 1/2) approximating that (11 to 12 h) found in older children and healthy adults; children aged 1 to 12 years had a shorter mean t 1/2 of 8 h. Dosing schedules based on milligrams per square meter body surface area correlated better with plasma flecainide levels than did dosing based on milligrams per kilogram body weight.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89292384\r", 
  ".W": "Recent information has suggested that early diastolic filling may be influenced by the left ventricular filling pressure, especially in the failing left ventricle. Acute severe left ventricular dysfunction was induced in 14 dogs by severe left ventricular global ischemia produced by left main coronary artery microsphere embolization until the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was greater than or equal to 20 mm Hg. To assess the importance of left ventricular filling pressure on left ventricular diastolic filling, nitroglycerin was infused and titrated to reduce left ventricular end-diastolic pressure to less than 15 mm Hg in seven dogs, whereas the remaining seven dogs were observed for 1 h after acute severe left ventricular dysfunction. In both groups of dogs, severe left ventricular dysfunction resulted in left ventricular dilation and elevation of end-diastolic pressure, reduction in area ejection fraction (echocardiographically determined) and an early redistribution of diastolic filling (increased filling fractions at one-third and one-half diastole) despite prolongation of the time constant of left ventricular pressure decline. Pressure-area plots shifted upward and rightward with severe left ventricular dysfunction and were unchanged at 1 h as were all other variables. Nitroglycerin infusion reduced left ventricular size and filling pressure, redistributed diastolic filling to later in diastole as characterized by reduced filling fraction at one-third diastole (left ventricular dysfunction 48.8 +/- 9.7%, nitroglycerin 17.9 +/- 7.9%, p less than 0.001) and shifted downward left ventricular pressure-area plots. Nitroglycerin also improved the time constant of relaxation (left ventricular dysfunction 83 +/- 15 ms, nitroglycerin 52 +/- 15 ms, p less than 0.001) and lengthened the diastolic filling period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Within 12 h of symptom onset (mean 6.3 +/- 2.7 h), patients were randomly assigned to a double-blind intracoronary infusion of streptokinase, nitroglycerin, both streptokinase and nitroglycerin or conventional therapy without acute cardiac catheterization. Treatment effects were also assessed in prospectively defined angiographic subsets. There was a significant interaction between streptokinase and nitroglycerin (p less than 0.01), resulting in an increase in ejection fraction of 3.9 percentage units in the combined treatment arm (p less than 0.001). Patients with collateral flow to a totally obstructed infarct-related artery showed a significant improvement over those without collateral flow in the streptokinase (5.4 +/- 2.5%) and streptokinase-nitroglycerin (10.6 +/- 2.7%) arms, but not in the nitroglycerin arm. Time to treatment did not influence the change in ejection fraction. In patients with initial subtotal occlusion, thrombolytic therapy was of no short-term benefit because ejection fraction increased by 6% in all three intervention arms. These findings indicate that relatively late thrombolytic therapy results in significant myocardial salvage in those patients with collateralized total coronary occlusion. This benefit is potentiated by concomitant nitroglycerin therapy.\r"

To test the hypothesis that patients with antecedent angina (Canadian classes I to IV, greater than or equal to 24 h before myocardial infarction) are more likely to have a significant residual stenosis (greater than or equal to 60% diameter reduction) than are those without antecedent angina, the coronary angiograms of 82 consecutive patients undergoing routine angiography after thrombolytic therapy were reviewed. Compared with the patients without antecedent angina, the group with antecedent angina had an increased mean stenosis (74% versus 58%) and more multivessel disease (44% versus 5%). The sensitivity and specificity of a clinical history of antecedent angina predicting the presence of a significant residual stenosis were 75% and 96%, respectively; the positive predictive accuracy was 98%. These data suggest that antecedent angina can be used to identify a high risk subgroup whose condition may warrant routine coronary angiography.\r"

The problem will be further exacerbated when the rate of growth in the number of persons needing long-term care is further accelerated by the graying of those in the \"baby boom\" generation. The current financing mechanism, which relies almost entirely on concurrent funding through either a means tested welfare program (Medicaid) or self-pay, is inequitable and inadequate even for our present needs. Despite the magnitude of the problem, only recently has sufficient attention been focused on finding alternatives to the current means of financing long-term care. The search for a solution has been hampered by multiple, and sometimes conflicting, policy and political considerations. After reviewing the demographic and social roots of our current dilemma and listing the major alternatives for financing long-term care, a series of basic principles and definitions are reviewed. These elements are meant to serve as guidelines to compare and evaluate the growing number of proposals which seek to create a more effective and equitable system for financing long-term care. Future articles in this section will detail some of the more promising approaches to the dilemma of financing long-term care.\r"

The major pathologic diagnoses included acute hepatitis, chronic persistent hepatitis, chronic lobular hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis with or without cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Histopathologic changes seen in varied combinations in these specimens included acidophilic degeneration of hepatocytes (100%), fat (85%), formation of portal tract lymphoid aggregates or follicles (52%), bile duct damage (30%), and multinucleate giant hepatocytes (25%). Prominence of sinusoidal cells was variable, but often striking. Hepatocyte atypia (liver cell dysplasia) was noted in 17 specimens. These histologic parameters appear to be diagnostically useful when applied in appropriate clinical settings and will require reevaluation when serologic tests for NANB hepatitis become available.\r"

  ".W": "Mouse fetuses with trisomy 16, an animal model for human trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), have severe defects in several hematopoietic stem cell populations and a marked reduction in thymocyte number. To determine whether there are other defects in the development of the trisomic thymus, the ontogeny of the cell surface antigenic determinants, Thy-1, Ly-1, CD3, CD4, CD8, and TCR v beta, was investigated. The trisomy 16 thymocytes were able to express all of determinants either during fetal life (days 14 to 19 of gestation) or in cultures of intact thymus lobes. However, in all instances (except for Thy-1, which already had a high proportion of expressing thymocytes by day 14), there was a delay in the time at which the determinants were first expressed, as manifested by reduced numbers of positively staining cells. Furthermore, there was also a delay in the rate at which the positively staining cells attained maximal Ag densities. Overall, there was an approximate 2 day lag in development of the fetal trisomic thymocytes. This lag permitted the identification of a large population of CD4-8+ cells prior to the appearance of CD4+8+ thymocytes. These findings are consistent with the identification of CD4-8+ as an intermediate stage between CD4-8- and CD4+8+ in fetal thymocyte ontogeny.\r"

In this study we found that anti-Qa-2 antibodies could stimulate the proliferation of murine T cells in vitro. Anti-Qa-2-induced proliferation required secondary cross-linking with anti-Ig antibody and the presence of PMA. Only Qa-2+ strains could be induced to proliferate by anti-Qa-2 antibody, but under the conditions employed, anti-CD3 could induce proliferation in Qa-2+ and Qa-2-strains. Interestingly, only anti-Qa-2 reagents directed against the alpha 3 domain of the Qa-2 class I molecule were effective in inducing proliferation. Furthermore, unlike purified CD4+ cells, purified CD8+ cells were unable to be stimulated by the anti-Qa-2 antibodies. These results lead to the inclusion of Qa-2 in a group of physiologically relevant, glycolipid-anchored, cell-surface molecules, mobilization of which can generate signals that initiate the proliferation of T cells. Such molecules may play a secondary role in cellular activation after the primary engagement of the TCR.\r"

Macrophage 59 cells were cultured with supernatants from several activated T cell clones to determine if lymphokines could modulate the activity of this macrophage hybridoma to generate effector Ts. Culture supernatants from Th1 clones and from one atypical IL-4 and IFN-gamma-producing T cell clone successfully modulated clone 59 cells to induce effector Ts cells. In contrast, supernatants from activated Th2 cells failed to generate Ts-inducing activity in macrophage 59 cells. Culture with recombinant derived IFN-gamma was sufficient to cause modulation of Ts-inducing activity in macrophage 59 cells. The data imply that the differential functional activities ascribed to various macrophage hybridoma clones reflect macrophage heterogeneity instead of independent macrophage lineages. The suppression induced by clone 59 macrophages was genetically restricted to the putative I-J region. The ability of IFN-gamma containing supernatants to endow macrophage 59 with the capacity to induce effector suppressor cells was specifically abrogated by addition of an anti-IJk-idiotype antibody, which also reacts with IJ-interaction molecules, indicating that the mechanism of modulation most likely involves expression of IJ-interaction molecule determinants on antigen presenting cells.\r"

Lymphocytes were retrieved from eyes of BALB/c mice that received subconjunctival injections of minor H-incompatible P815 tumor cells. The lymphocytes were then assayed for direct cytotoxic activity as well as precursor frequency by limiting dilution. Similar assays were conducted on cells obtained from the draining lymph nodes and from the spleen. As expected, tumor rejection was accompanied by significant clonal expansion of minor H-specific pTc within the draining lymph node and the spleen. A correspondingly high frequency of pTc was also detected at the graft site. More importantly, fully functional cytotoxic T cells were recovered from the tumor graft site during rejection, but no similarly active cells were found in either the draining nodes or spleen. We conclude that, after Ag stimulation, pTc are generated in draining central lymphoid compartments. From this generative site, the precursor cells then disseminate systemically, gradually reaching and infiltrating the tumor graft site. A further activation step, dependent upon Ag and T cell help, permits these cells to mature into fully active cytotoxic cells which can then effect tumor rejection. We propose that the terminal stage(s) of pTc activation is promoted by lymphokines released locally from TDH cells that are also generated during the alloimmune response and simultaneously infiltrate the site.\r"

Inhibition of APC proliferation was used as an assay to determine the relative contributions of polymorphic sites on the class II alpha- and beta-chains to MHC-restricted activation of I-A beta k-restricted cloned T cells. Transfectants expressing A beta k in conjunction with the alpha chain of k, u, or d were equally effective APCs, whereas transfectants expressing A beta u were completely ineffective, implicating the beta-chain as more critical for the presentation of L-tyrosine-p-azobenzenearsonate. Site-directed mutagenesis of polymorphic positions in the beta chain revealed a remarkable stringency for the k haplotype, in contrast to the relaxed alpha-chain requirement. These results, in conjunction with others, indicate that the relative contribution of polymorphic sites on class II alpha- and beta-chains to T cell Ag recognition can differ markedly, and, furthermore, may vary as a function of the Ag.\r"

  ".W": "Cholera toxin (CT), either mixed with or conjugated to unrelated protein Ag, is known to enhance the intestinal IgA response of rodents toward the unrelated Ag. Although relatively low doses of CT exert this gut mucosal adjuvant effect, the inherent toxicity of CT is a hindrance to its use in humans. Our report demonstrates that CT treated with 20 mM glutaraldehyde retains adjuvant properties but exhibits more than 1000-fold lower toxicity than untreated toxin. Glutaraldehyde was also used in a one-stage conjugation procedure to couple CT covalently to Sendai virus. Again, toxicity was reduced more than 1000-fold. This drop in toxicity is consistent with an observed 100-fold loss in binding capacity of the CT B subunit and a 20- to 50-fold reduction in adenylate cyclase activation by the CT A subunit. Oral administration of this virus-toxoid conjugate resulted in increased gut antiviral IgA titers compared with oral administration of either virus alone or of virus mixed with glutaraldehyde-treated toxin. This marked decrease in toxicity may afford a practical approach for the use of CT as a mucosal adjuvant.\r"

  ".W": "Natural suppressor (NS) cells are potent, Ag nonspecific, MHC-unrestricted inhibitors of immune responses. Murine NS activity is found in several situations, including adult bone marrow (BM) and neonatal/newborn spleen, and spleen following total lymphoid irradiation, after BM transplantation and after cyclophosphamide (CY) treatment. Using three of these situations (adult BM, newborn spleen, and spleen after CY treatment), the strain distribution of NS cell activity was assessed. A wide variation in potency is seen in both naturally occurring (adult BM and newborn spleen) and induced (after CY treatment) NS cell activity. Up to 10-fold differences in NS activity are seen between high and low NS strains. This reflects an intrinsic genetic variation between mouse strains in both naturally occurring and CY-induced NS cell activity. Thus, a strain with high NS activity at birth, has high NS activity in its BM as an adult and in its spleen after CY treatment. Of the strains tested, B10.D2 has the highest NS cell activity while BALB/c has the lowest, and the F1 between these two strains is intermediate in NS activity. Finally, the NS cell activity from all strains tested required IFN-gamma for expression of its inhibitory activity.\r"

  ".W": "In DA rats grafted with PVG hearts, the injection of 1 ml of Wistar-Furth x DA)F1 anti-PVG serum on the day of grafting prevents rejection and induces a state of specific unresponsiveness. An adoptive transfer assay was used to test the capacity of T cell subsets, taken from rats given enhancing serum, to either restore rejection or to transfer unresponsiveness to syngeneic hosts irradiated with 9 Gy and grafted with donor (PVG) or third party (Wistar-Furth) hearts. W3/25+ (CD4+) cells from these animals retained some capacity to restore rejection until 50 days posttransplant, after which they invariably failed to restore PVG graft rejection but retained the capacity to effect Wistar-Furth rejection. At this time CD4+ cells were also capable of inhibiting naive but not specifically sensitized CD4+ cells capacity to restore PVG graft rejection in irradiated hosts. The development of CD4+ suppressor cells was concurrent with the appearance of clinically evident unresponsiveness in the host. MRC Ox8+ (CD8+) cells from enhanced rats when mixed with naive CD4+ cells delayed rejection in adoptive recipients but did not reestablish unresponsiveness. Paradoxically, the CD4+ cells that transfer unresponsiveness to the adoptive host proliferate such as normal cells in MLC to both donor and third party alloantigen. Unfractionated cells, CD4+ or CD8+ cells did not proliferate to relevant idiotype in vitro. The CD4+ cells after 3 days in culture, with either alloantigen or idiotype-bearing stimulator cells, lost their capacity to suppress in the adoptive transfer assay. The maintenance of specific unresponsiveness was thus shown to be due to a CD4+ suppressor T cell whose function was lost in culture, and therefore could not be detected in MLC or idiotype assays.\r"

  ".W": "We have identified four fine specificity groups reactive with the organophosphorus hapten Soman among 46 hybridomas generated in specific response to immunization with Soman-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). The different fine specificity groups do not appear to correlate with the use of particular V genes. Molecular analysis of VH genes demonstrates predominant use of VH J558 family members in hybridomas of all fine specificity groups although several different VH genes within this family as well as others are able to contribute. Diversity of VH gene usage was also apparent in primary IgM-producing hybridomas. In contrast, there appears to be restricted L chain usage; a large number (18/46) used the V kappa 1 family. Interestingly, the V kappa 1 family also plays an important role in the memory response to phosphocholine (PC)-KLH, a related organophosphate hapten which shares several structural features with Soman, particularly when coupled to protein carriers. The V kappa 1 C gene appears to predominate in the PC-KLH response. Restriction analysis of DNA from the V kappa 1-positive Soman-KLH-specific hybridomas suggests that a single V kappa 1 gene may be utilized by 17/18 but that this gene is different from V kappa 1 C and may be V kappa 1 A. We propose that members of the V kappa 1 family contribute favorably in generating combining sites that recognize all or part of the structural features shared by the two haptenic structures Soman and PC when they are coupled to protein. This most likely involves recognition of the phenyl linker moiety as the dominant feature. It appears that the L chain rather than the H chain may play a more significant role in forming the phenyl-Soman-specific combining site and perhaps the combining sites for phenyl or ring structures in general.\r"

  ".W": "Kinins are vasoactive peptides whose potent inflammatory and bone resorbing properties suggest a role for these autacoids in the pathogenesis of inflammatory arthritis. We used cultured human synovial cells as a model to evaluate the effects of bradykinin on articular tissue. In resting synovial cells, bradykinin was a relatively ineffective stimulus for PGE2 production. However, after a period of preincubation with the cytokine, IL-1, which is itself a stimulus for PGE2 production, synovial cells exhibited a further striking time- and dose-dependent response to bradykinin. Maximal release of PGE2 was observed in response to 10(-7) to 10(-6) M bradykinin after first pretreating the cells for 24 h with 5 to 10 U/ml of IL-1. rIL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta, as well as rTNF-alpha, induced a similar response to bradykinin in synovial cells, whereas recombinant IL-2 did not. The bradykinin analog, lysylbradykinin, was equipotent in inducing PGE2 release from IL-1 pretreated synovial cells, whereas des(Arg9) bradykinin, substance P, and neurokinins A and B were ineffective in this regard in both IL-1-pretreated and in resting cells. Synovial cells derived from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis responded similarly to bradykinin. The synergistic response in PGE2 production induced by IL-1 and bradykinin was significantly inhibited by pretreatment with 1 microM indomethacin or dexamethasone (96 and 94% inhibition, respectively). In addition, the response was abrogated by pretreatment with 10 micrograms/ml of cycloheximide or actinomycin D (81 and 97% inhibition, respectively). These data provide the first description of synergism of IL-1 with a noncytokine peptide in human synovial cells. The ability of IL-1 to increase the responsiveness of synovial tissues to bradykinin may play an important role in potentiating inflammatory responses within the joint.\r"

At high multiplicities of infection (5 pfu/cell) the IFN-gamma expressed by vaccinia was not able to overcome the profound decrease of MHC concentration, normally associated with VV infection, in any of the cells tested. However, at successively decreasing multiplicities of infection, a gradual increase in MHC class I concentration above control levels was observed in human 143B cells but not in murine L929 cells, thus indicating that the species specificity of IFN-gamma is preserved in VV-huIFN-gamma-infected cells. We infer from these data that the IFN-gamma secreted by infected 143B cells is able to exert an MHC upregulating effect on uninfected cells in the vicinity. Antiviral activity of the IFN-gamma expressed by the virus was also assessed. Pretreatment for 24 to 48 h of human 143B cells with IFN-gamma containing supernatants had a significant antiviral effect comparable to rhuIFN-gamma. However, when added 1 h after virus infection, antiviral activity was much less evident. Also, the IFN-gamma secreted by infected 143B cells in monolayers infected at low multiplicity did not efficiently inhibit spread of infection to other cells in the vicinity.\r"

The V kappa-1A and V kappa-1C germ line genes isolated from BALB/c (Ig kappa c) were identical to those previously described. These are the two major V kappa-1 germ line genes in BALB/c and together account for 40 of the 53 expressed V kappa-1 sequences that have been reported to date. Allelic differences in a single germ line variable region gene (V kappa-1A) in different strains of mice explain the differences in L chain IEF patterns previously associated with the Ig kappa-Ef2 locus. The rearranged kappa-gene expressed in the BALB/c myeloma MOPC-460 has been isolated and found to represent a V kappa-1A somatic variant differing by three nucleotides from the germ line V kappa-1A gene. Germ line genes isolated from NZB (Ig kappa b) and CE (Ig kappa f) show greater than 95% identity with the BALB/c genes over the 1700 nucleotides compared. Comparison by region indicated the greatest conservation of sequence occurs in and around the leader exon followed by the V-region exon. The NZB gene encodes the amino acid sequence found in the myeloma PC-2205, previously designated V kappa-1B. The V kappa-1 gene isolated from CE is likely an allele of the BALB/c V kappa-1C gene as the two share greater than 96% identity over 1700 nucleotides. The CE gene has been designated V kappa-1Cf. Ancient remnants of LINE-1 repetitive elements were detected approximately 400 bp downstream of all of the V kappa-1 genes. These possess greater homology with repetitive elements found near other kappa genes than they do with the native L1Md sequence.\r"

  ".W": "Granuloma formation in schistosomiasis is characterized by the formation of a large lesion in acutely infected animals which subsequently decreases in size as disease progresses into the chronic phase. These in vivo studies confirm and extend previous in vitro observations on the regulation of granulomatous hypersensitivity by a T cell-derived suppressor effector factor (TseF). TseF regulation of granuloma formation in vivo and DTH are shown to be both antigenically and genetically restricted. This suppression is accompanied by a suppression of the ability of cells derived from TseF recipients to function in an in vitro assay of granuloma formation. Antigenic recognition, defined by cellular proliferation in response to antigenic stimulation, is uneffected by TseF administration. Administration of IL-2 reduces TseF function in acutely infected mice and results in increased liver granuloma size. However, the ability of cells derived from these animals to form granulomas in vitro is uneffected. Cells obtained from chronically infected IL-2 recipients do not produce TseF in vitro and granuloma size is increased in these animals. Animals receiving both IL-2 and TseF continue to demonstrate decreased granuloma formation, indicating that IL-2 does not effect the ability of preformed TseF to function. These observations suggest that TseF modulates granuloma formation in vivo and may interact with IL-2 in a dynamic process which determines the intensity of the granulomatous response.\r"

Recently, V mutation has been established as a major mechanism of tumor escape from anti-Id immunotherapy. We cloned and sequenced the expressed Ig H and L chain V regions from a case of B acute lymphoblastic leukemia in order to evaluate B cell stages associated with V region mutation, and to determine which tumors would be better suited to Id directed immunotherapy. A consensus VH and V lambda sequence representing tumor at diagnosis was obtained by conventional cDNA cloning in lambda gt10 from a heterohybridoma. Primers which flanked both V regions were used in a modified polymerase chain reaction to generate multiple independent sequences from tumor cells harvested at relapse. In order to exclude mutations due to infidelity of the amplification procedure, single cDNA templates of known sequence were also amplified. The polymerase chain reaction proved to be an effective procedure to obtain multiple clones, but replication in M13 was associated with a low rate of base misincorporation. The results indicate that there is no evidence for biologically significant ongoing mutation in this t(8;14) B cell tumor when comparing sequences at diagnosis and relapse. Thus, V somatic mutation may be restricted to a discrete B cell stage whose malignant counterpart is follicular lymphoma.\r"

Two alleles were detected for each of two of the loci, whereas a polymorphic band was scored as present or absent for the other three loci. The polymorphic fragments segregated in the expected Mendelian fashion and parental haplotypes could be assigned in all cases. Comparison of the patterns obtained with the flanking and coding region probes suggests that the human VHIII gene family is highly polymorphic and may contain several hundred V genes. This method, as well as the polymorphism detected, can be used to investigate the organization and germ-line variation of H chain V genes and their inheritance in normal individuals and in individuals with immunologic disorders.\r"

The activity of FK506, when compared to Cyclosporin A, another immunosuppressant, was 10 to 100x more potent in its ability to inhibit IL-2 mRNA synthesis. FK506 inhibited IL-2 mRNA accumulation in Con A, Con A plus PMA, Ionomycin plus PMA, anti-CD3, and anti-CD3 plus PMA activated T cells. Transcripts from other T cell gene classes such as the immediate early (IE) phase gene, c-fos, the late phase (L) genes, transferrin receptor, IL-2R alpha-chain, and TNF-beta, and the constitutive class genes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and class I MHC HLA-B7 were not affected by FK506. The macrolide Rapamycin, which is structurally related to FK506, had no inhibitory effect on IE, E, L, or constitutive class mRNAs, but it appeared to increase the levels of the E-phase transcripts that were inhibited in FK506 treated T cells. The effect of FK506 on inducible genes in non-T and non-lymphoid human cells was studied in LPS-induced monocytes and PMA or IL-1 activated synovial fibroblasts. FK506 did not affect expression of the mRNAs for IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta in human monocytes, or of stromelysin, collagenase, or TIMP in synovial fibroblasts. Nuclear run-off transcription studies indicate that FK506 inhibits transcription of the IL-2 gene. These studies suggest that Cyclosporin A and FK506 may effect a common early event in the T cell activation pathway.\r"

As part of a double-blind placebo controlled trial of immunosuppression using cyclosporin A in patients with multiple sclerosis, light chain analysis was performed on pre- and post-treatment CSF samples in 19 patients, nine having received cyclosporin A and 10 placebo. The placebo treated patients showed continued immunological activity, as evidenced by an increase in both free kappa and lambda chains, but cyclosporin A treatment resulted in no change or an improvement in light chain response, indicative of suppression of continued activity. As cyclosporin A does not enter the CSF, this implies that systemic stimulation is at least partly responsible for continued disease activity in multiple sclerosis. Cyclosporin A may thus be effective in preventing the deterioration of patients with multiple sclerosis.\r"

  ".U": "89293222\r", 
  ".W": "Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) is a diuretic natriuretic peptide hormone produced by both the heart and brain which has been postulated to play a role in the hemodynamic and sodium instability that frequently follows subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Levels of ANF were measured in 12 patients with nontraumatic SAH and nine control patients with unruptured cerebral aneurysms. At surgery, the mean plasma ANF level (+/- standard deviation) of the SAH group was significantly higher than that of the control group (158.1 +/- 83.8 vs. 57.8 +/- 45.3 pg/ml, respectively; p = 0.01). There was no significant difference in serum sodium concentration, blood pressure, or central venous pressure between these groups. Nine patients with SAH due to aneurysm rupture had plasma ANF levels similar to those in three patients with SAH due to other causes. Four patients with moderate to severe SAH had significantly higher mean cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ANF values (17.7 +/- 12.8 pg/ml) than five patients with minimal SAH (0.6 +/- 0.9 pg/ml) or the control group of nine patients (3.7 +/- 1.3 pg/ml) (p less than 0.05). Five patients with moderate to severe SAH had significantly higher plasma ANF values (202.6 +/- 72.2 pg/ml) than five with minimal SAH (86.8 +/- 29.2 pg/ml) or the control group (57.8 +/- 45.3 pg/ml) (p less than 0.05). Plasma ANF values were substantially higher than CSF ANF content in the SAH group (p less than 0.01) and in the control group (p = 0.05). From these data it is concluded that: 1) plasma ANF is elevated significantly after SAH; 2) this rise appears unrelated to the cause of hemorrhage, serum sodium concentration, blood pressure, or central venous pressure, but is related to the extent of the hemorrhage; 3) ANF concentrations in the CSF are significantly lower than in plasma, and are elevated after moderate to severe SAH; and 4) the source of CSF ANF is probably the plasma, and the source of plasma ANF is likely the heart.\r"

Formulation of 153Sm as [153Sm]EDTA, with a 1:10 molar ratio of SM:EDTA, provided a stable radiotracer in vitro and in vivo. High specific activity [153Sm]EDTA showed superior uptake in cell culture (20.8 +/- 0.9% vs. 5.5 +/- 0.1% for 6 and 600 pmol Sm per 10(6) cells, respectively) and better tumor index values (51 vs. 37 at 10.9 nmol and 1.09 mumol Sm kg-1, respectively) in the BDF1 mouse/Lewis lung tumor model. High specific activity [153Sm]EDTA scintigrams of Copenhagen x Fisher rats bearing transplanted Dunning R3327 tumors clearly delineated the tumors within 6 hr, with moderate liver and bone uptake and low soft-tissue background. The injected radiotracer underwent rapid central compartment clearance and whole-body elimination. The absence of observed adverse histopathological toxicity combines with high image quality within 6 hr, to support the clinical tumor-imaging potential of this agent. Comparative studies with [67Ga]citrate at molar-equivalent doses indicated that high specific activity [153Sm]EDTA was a superior radiotracer in these in vitro and in vivo models.\r"

In rat brain the high uptake of [11C]YM-09151-2 in striatum was displaced with sulpiride, spiroperidol, and YM-09151-2. SCH-23390 and ritanserin, D1-dopamine and S2-serotonin antagonists, showed no effect on the distribution of [11C]YM-09151-2. In the striatum at 60 min, 95% of the radioactivity was detected as [11C]YM-09151-2 by high performance liquid chromatography. On the other hand, 41% of 11C in the plasma at 60 min was observed as metabolites. In vivo autoradiography showed a high uptake of [11C]YM-09151-2 in the striatum and in the nucleus accumbens of rat brain. A high uptake of radioactivity was also found in the canine basal ganglia with positron emission tomography. The uptake was reduced by pretreatment with spiroperidol. The present results demonstrate that [11C]YM-09151-2 is a D2 receptor specific compound and is a potential in vivo tracer for measuring D2 receptors.\r"

The maximal labeling dose of 10 microCi (0.37 MBq) [111In]oxine/10(8) PMNC was found not to adversely influence either cell viability or lymphocyte proliferation in vitro. For in vivo studies, 1.5 X 10(9) PMNC were gained by lymphapheresis and reinjected intravenously after radioactive labeling, 150 microCi (5.55 MBq). The labeling of enlarged palpable lymph nodes was achieved in three out of three patients with Hodgkin's disease and in five out of five with high-malignant lymphoma, whereas three out of seven patients with low malignant lymphoma and no patient with chronic lymphatic leukemia had positive lymph node imaging. We thus conclude that PMNC retain their ability to migrate after [111In]oxine labeling and that these cells traffic to involved lymph nodes of some, but not all hematologic malignancies.\r"

A high performance liquid chromatographic procedure using a 5-mu C-18 reverse phase column and ion-pairing mobile phase was used for the quantification of 6-[18F]-DOPA. The radiochemical purity of 6-[18F]-DOPA was measured by 18F radioactivity in HPLC fractions while the chemical purity was determined by an amperometric electrochemical detector with a sensitivity of 25 pg. Quality control of eight consecutive batches of highly purified 6-[18F]-DOPA sample used in a pre-clinical trial revealed that the chemical and/or radiochemical purity of the PET imaging ligand, 6-[18F]-DOPA was greater than 97 +/- 0.5% with a specific activity of 365 +/- 31 mCi/mmol. The knowledge and assurance of radiochemical purity of PET ligands are essential for the interpretation of clinical PET imaging results. The assurance of such quality control would enable comparisons of 6-[18F]-DOPA/PET data obtained from various medical centers using different radiopharmaceutical procedures.\r"

The 235 infants who were born in 1984 with birth weights of 751 to 1000 gm and admitted to any of 10 participating neonatal intensive care units comprised the study population. We analyzed demographic characteristics, status at birth, severity of acute atelectasis, and early respiratory treatment in relation to CLD, which we defined as having received oxygen at age 30 days. By univariate analysis, CLD was associated with lower gestational age (p less than 0.001), male sex (p = 0.004), more severe acute atelectasis as indicated by a higher roentgenographic score (p less than 0.001), a higher ventilation rate at 96 hours (p = 0.012), and lower PaCO2 at 48 hours (p = 0.04). Infants receiving mechanical ventilation whose highest PaCO2 levels at 48 or 96 hour were less than 40 mm Hg were 1.45 times as likely to develop CLD as those whose highest PaCO2 levels were greater than 50 mm Hg (95% confidence interval 1.04 to 2.01). CLD rates by center were inversely related to mean PaCO2 levels in infants receiving mechanical ventilation at 48 and 96 hours (Spearman rank correlations 0.60 and 0.55; p less than 0.001). A logistic risk model that included sex, PaCO2 at 48 hours, roentgenographic score, gestational age, and race showed only male sex (p = 0.009) and lower PaCO2 at 48 hours (p = 0.04) to be independent predictors of CLD. We conclude that mechanical ventilation that results in PaCO2 levels above the physiologic range may decrease the risk of CLD in extremely low birth weight infants.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effects of intravenous glucose loading on basal oxygen consumption, resting energy expenditure, and basal carbon dioxide production in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia who were still oxygen dependent, we administered intravenous glucose loads of 4 and 12 mg/kg-1/min-1 on 2 consecutive days, under identical experimental conditions, to six infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and six healthy control subjects. Infants were not fed for 9 hours before and during the 4- to 6-hour study periods; the intravenous glucose infusion, along with an amino acid mixture (2 gm.kg-1.24 hr-1), was started at the beginning of the fasting period. Oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production and resting energy expenditure were measured by a flow-through indirect calorimetry technique under basal conditions. Infants with oxygen-dependent bronchopulmonary dysplasia had significantly higher basal oxygen consumption and resting energy expenditure than did control infants and significantly higher basal carbon dioxide production during the high glucose infusion. With glucose loading, infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia had a significant rise in basal oxygen consumption (7.91 +/- 0.91 ml.kg-1.min-1 to 9.65 +/- 1.35 ml.kg-1.min-1, p less than 0.05), basal carbon dioxide production (5.93 +/- 0.72 ml.kg-1.min-1 to 7.10 +/- 1.04 ml.kg-1.min-1), and resting energy expenditure (53.8 +/- 5.75 kcal.kg-1.24 hr-1 to 65.3 +/- 7.0 kcal.kg-1.24 hr-1, all p values less than 0.05). Control infants had no significant changes with intravenous glucose loading. We conclude that intravenous glucose loading in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia resulted in a net increase in resting energy expenditure, which should be taken into account in assessing their energy intake during nutritional management. The risk of pulmonary stress caused by an increase in basal oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production resulting from glucose load should also be considered.\r"

Subacute and acute maxillary sinusitis are similar in regard to causative organism, clinical presentation, and radiographic findings.\r"

Percy Nylander clarified many of the factors that contribute to this high incidence of twinning. His analyses of Nigerian placentation and zygosity have shown the increased rate of multiple pregnancy to be a result of higher proportions of dizygotic twins and trizygotic triplets as compared to Caucasian populations. Whereas a well-established genetic influence upon dizygotic twinning exists throughout the rest of the world, there may be an environmental factor in Nigeria responsible for the increased incidence of multiple births. Nylander's study of the Yoruba also has provided important contributions to the studies of perinatal mortality in multiple gestation. In totality, much of Nylander's work can be applied to further the understanding of ethnic and racial differences in human twin placentation and zygosity.\r"

Those rates were compared with the fecundity rates in 255 of the couples followed in 2,668 untreated cycles. IUI was most beneficial for cervical factor infertility, with a monthly yield of 0.11 in conjunction with hMG and for poor postcoital tests in general but was less impressive when seminal parameters were abnormal. The addition of hMG when ovulation was normal (as an independent variable) did not yield results statistically superior to those of IUI alone (fecundity = 0.06 versus 0.03), but the addition of hMG to the regimen gave an improvement over IUI alone when endometriosis had been diagnosed and in the presence of cervical factor infertility. One serious side effect of therapy was a pelvic abscess, which required hospitalization but not surgery.\r"

None had rearrangement of the delta gene locus within the 9.0-kb BamHI restriction fragment. Cell lines that expressed the delta gene contained both mu alleles, with at least one productively rearranged. Thirteen of 18 cell lines had detectable transcripts hybridizing with the delta probe. In 10 of the 13 cell lines with delta transcripts, cytoplasmic delta chains were detected, but only two of these expressed delta chains strongly on the surface. All 13 lines made cytoplasmic mu chains, and all except one made cytoplasmic light chains. Surface IgM was detected in all except two of the 13 cell lines. Although BL has generally been considered not to express IgD, except in occasional cases, previous studies have been confined to examination of the cell surface. Many of the cell lines that we examined express delta mRNA transcripts as well as produce cytoplasmic delta chains but no detectable surface IgD. This suggests that delta chains are detectable in the cytoplasm prior to being apparent on the surface. Our findings argue against an origin of BL from germinal center cells since IgD is almost totally lacking in normal B cells present in germinal centers.\r"

There were 18 deaths (11.2%) with a mean ISS of 40.3. Of the 143 survivors, 18 (12.5%) with a mean age of 68.4 years required placement in long-term care facilities. Elderly survivors also had longer hospital stays, consuming 51% of all hospital days. Driver information from the governmental universal automobile insurance agency was available for 134 accidents. Drivers failed to yield the right of way in 31 instances (23%). Fifteen (11%) were driving without due care and five (4%) at an unsafe speed. Nine (7%) had documented alcohol involvement. Forty drivers (30%) incurred a total of 50 traffic charges. Previous driving records were available for 109. Forty-six (42%) had been involved in two or more previous accidents and 40 (37%) had five or more previous citations for moving violations. Pedestrian action at road intersections was recorded in 75 accidents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Immediate reactions to different types of trauma have been the object of several studies recently. It has been shown that pulmonary platelet trapping (PPT) occurs within minutes after both septic shock and soft-tissue trauma. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether hypovolemia induced by hypoperfusion might trigger platelet trapping in the lungs in the same way as soft-tissue trauma. Platelets labelled with indium-oxine were reinfused in anesthetized and mechanically ventilated pigs 4 hours before either induction of standardized hypovolemia caused by bleeding to the amount of 20% of the estimated blood volume (n = 6) or a standardized soft-tissue trauma to the hind limbs (n = 7). Platelet sequestration in the lungs was recorded dynamically by means of scintigraphy for 15 minutes before and 90 min after the start of the trauma and bleeding episodes. Central hemodynamics were recorded using a Swan-Ganz catheter. Soft-tissue trauma induced a marked PPT; in the animals subjected to bleeding alone there was no such effect despite a hemodynamic deterioration of greater magnitude than in the trauma group. The PPT was accompanied by a reduction in the number of platelets and leukocytes in peripheral blood. Our results indicate that immediate trapping of platelets in the lungs after trauma occurs as a response to factors other than those related to simple hypovolemic hypoperfusion.\r"

  ".W": "In a randomized, prospective, double-blind trial, the effect of conventional low-dose heparin (5,000 units every 8 hours) was compared with that of a low molecular weight fragment (2165 LMWH, Kabi Vitrum AB, starting 2,500 units 2 hr before surgery, and then 5,000 units subcutaneously every morning for 9 days). A total of 90 patients admitted because of hip fracture fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were analyzed for development of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis: 46 patients were included in the low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) group, and 44 in the conventional heparin group. Two and three, respectively, died before diagnostic tests were performed. In the remaining patients a ventilation-perfusion lung scan was performed 8 days after intervention. In the first 57 patients studied a bilateral ascending venography was performed on the ninth day only if clinical symptoms suggested a deep venous thrombosis. Because of the rate of venous thrombosis detected in those patients was unexpectedly low, venography was requested in the remaining 33 patients, even if the screening tests were negative. Pulmonary embolism occurred in six patients, all in the LMWH group. Deep vein thrombosis occurred in 14 patients in the LMWH group and in six patients in the conventional heparin group. Both differences are statistically significant. Mortality did not differ between the groups, nor did haemorrhagic complications. Our findings suggest that, in patients with hip fracture, LMWH is not useful at the dosage used.\r"

The potentially preventable preterm birth rate decreased from 3.2% in the 3-year control period to 1.3% during the 2-year study period, a 60% reduction. The preterm neonates who were born during the study period were older, had a greater average birth weight, and had fewer admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit. The percentage of women in preterm labor who presented early enough to receive tocolysis increased from 51% to 98%, and those in preterm labor who delivered at term increased from 56% to 96%. Requiring primarily education and increased awareness, this preterm birth prevention program was successful and inexpensive and may be applicable to similar rural primary care practices.\r"

Adequate consent is crucial to the ethical conduct of clinical trials, including those performed in emergency settings. We examine the problem of emergency informed consent. As an illustrative case, we discuss a pilot trial of prehospital thrombolytic therapy for myocardial infarction. Federal regulations for clinical research do not provide clear guidelines on emergency research in the conscious patient. Clinical investigators currently approach emergency consent in four ways: (1) avoid such research, (2) omit the consent process, (3) obtain deferred consent, or (4) obtain customary consent. We suggest a fifth alternative, two-step consent, which permits the conduct of emergency research while protecting the rights of the emergency research subjects. Such a process may serve as an alternative solution for future studies faced with the problem of informed consent in emergencies.\r"

We used core cooling, nonrecirculating retrograde heart perfusion, and lung immersion with liposomal recombinant human superoxide dismutase in an attempt to provide effective 12-hour cardiopulmonary preservation. Donor dogs supported by cardiopulmonary bypass were rapidly cooled to 15 degrees C with cardioplegic arrest, and heterotopic heart and unilateral left lung transplantations were performed. In control dogs (n = 7), hearts and lungs, harvested after core cooling and cardioplegic arrest, were transplanted with a total mean ischemic time of 88 +/- 5 minutes. In group II (n = 7), heart-lung blocks were similarly excised but preserved at 4 degrees C for 12 hours (756 +/- 30 minutes) and then transplanted. During preservation, the lungs were immersed in hyperosmolar extracellular solution. For the heart, retrograde coronary sinus perfusion was performed with intracellular solution containing perfluorochemicals at a temperature of 4 degrees C and a rate of 30 ml/hr for 12 hours. In group III (n = 7), donor organs were similarly excised and preserved for 12 hours (726 +/- 39 minutes), except that liposomal recombinant human superoxide dismutase was administered during harvest, preservation, and reperfusion. Myocardial function, assessed by the ratio of end-systolic pressure to end-systolic dimension, after the 12-hour preservation period in both experimental groups was similar to that of the control group 4 and 6 hours after transplantation. The mean arterial oxygen capacity of the transplanted left lung during ventilation with an inspired oxygen concentration of 40% was also similar in each group. In contrast, the 12-hour preservation of pulmonary function assessed by pulmonary vascular resistance, the accumulation of extravascular lung water, and histologic evidence of alveolar wall injury, interstitial edema, and perivascular hemorrhage were significantly impaired in the absence of liposal recombinant human superoxide dismutase. These findings suggest that successful extended cardiopulmonary preservation for heart-lung transplantation is possible with core cooling, nonrecirculating retrograde heart perfusion, and hypothermic lung immersion incorporating liposomal recombinant human superoxide dismutase.\r"

  ".W": "The psychomotor function of 27 long-term haemodialysis patients with apparently normal cerebral function, who had only mildly raised serum aluminium (mean 59 [SEM 9] micrograms/l), was measured by means of a computerised version of the symbol digit coding test. Compared with those of control subjects matched for age and the patients' estimated premorbid IQ, the patients' response times were significantly longer (2.51 [0.10] vs 1.88 [0.05] s). Abnormalities were also detected in five other computerised tests of psychomotor function. The mean activity of erythrocyte dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR), which is inhibited by aluminium, rose during 3 months' desferrioxamine treatment in most of the 15 patients so treated. Although there was no relation between baseline psychomotor function and either indices of cumulative aluminium exposure or erythrocyte DHPR activity, changes in DHPR induced by desferrioxamine correlated with changes in psychomotor performance (r = 0.62). The flash-stimulated visual evoked potential (measured in 10 patients) was delayed (133.4 [2.4] ms), although the pattern-stimulated visual evoked potential remained normal (101.8 [3.2] ms). The difference between the visual evoked potentials stimulated by flash and pattern was significantly greater in the patients than in the controls (31.6 [4.3] vs 19.4 [2.4] ms) and was significantly related to the symbol digit coding response times and to the oral aluminium intake. The results suggest that much more rigorous exclusion of aluminium from the dialysate and diet of dialysis patients is necessary.\r"

This gene, together with a fourth rearranging gene delta, encodes a second type of T-cell receptor, TCR gamma delta. Although TCR gamma delta-bearing T cells constitute a relatively minor subpopulation in the thymus and in peripheral lymphoid organs, they are the major lymphocytes of epidermis (dendritic epidermal cells or DEC) and of intestinal epithelium (intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes or IEL) in mice, suggesting that at least some gamma delta T cells are important in the surveillance of a variety of epithelia. It was recently reported, however, that the TCR gamma delta on DEC has essentially no structural diversity, implying that the putative ligand is monomorphic. As this finding, if generally applicable, poses severe restrictions on the origin of the ligand, we investigated the diversity of the TCR on the second major epithelium-associated gamma delta T cells, namely IEL from mice. We report here that by contrast with the DEC gamma delta, the IEL gamma delta TCR are structurally diverse.\r"

  ".W": "Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) converts the inactive zymogen, plasminogen, into the powerful protease, plasmin, which then degrades the fibrin meshwork of thrombi. To prevent systemic activation of plasminogen, plasma contains several inhibitors of t-PA, the most important of which is plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), a member of the serpin superfamily. As the ability to produce serpin-resistant variants of t-PA could increase the potential of this enzyme as a thrombolytic agent, we have used the known three-dimensional structure of the complex between trypsin and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) to model the interactions between the active site of human t-PA and PAI-1. On the basis of this model we then altered by site-directed mutagenesis those amino acids of t-PA predicted to make contact with PAI-1 but not with the substrate plasminogen. We report here that although the resulting mutants have enzymatic properties similar to those of wild-type t-PA, they display significant resistance to inhibition by PAI-1. For example, following incubation with an amount of the serpin that completely inhibits the wild-type enzyme, one variant retains 95% of its initial activity. This mutant is also resistant to inhibition by the complex mixture of serpins present in human plasma.\r"

Our patient, as well as members of this family, had numerous amyloid plaques and rare neurofibrillary tangles. These plaques were quite atypical for Alzheimer's disease (AD); many were quite large (up to 500 microns in diameter) and contained several amyloid cores, some with neuritic components. The plaques were present throughout the cerebral cortex and striatum, but not in the cerebellum. By electron microscopy, they had radiating star-shaped amyloid cores containing 8- to 10-nm fibrils, and a few dystrophic neurites. They were strongly immunoreactive with antiserum to prion protein but did not react with the antiserum to the amyloid A4 protein of AD.

We investigated 3 patients with paramyotonia congenita before and after the induction of forearm muscle weakness by exercise in cold water. Two of these patients had paralysis periodica paramyotonica and the 3rd had paramyotonia congenita. At the time of paramyotonic weakness there was a marked increase in the arterialized-venous concentration difference of potassium across forearm muscle. This indicated a significant uptake of potassium by forearm muscle in all 3 patients. Normal controls showed a slight release of potassium both at rest and after exercise in cold water. These results suggest that (1) the sodium-potassium pump of the muscle fiber is operating efficiently during paramyotonic weakness; and (2) there is a different mechanism responsible for the generalized weakness that occurs in hyperkalemic periodic paralysis.\r"

We compared a group of patients with clinically definite MS with a group of patients with a variety of other neurologic diseases. Tourtellotte's formula, IgG albumin ratio, IgG index, and free kappa chains distinguished the MS group from the comparative group of patients. ROC curve analysis demonstrated that CSF free kappa light chains were more closely linked to MS than the other measures. Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated no advantage of adding any single IgG measure or combination of measures to free kappa light chain analysis. Our results strongly suggest that free kappa light chains in CSF are the single best quantitative assay to support a clinical diagnosis of MS.\r"

Sterile denatured dentin ash was used as a control material in an attempt to quantify tertiary dentin formation in response to cavity preparation. In all periods the amounts of tertiary dentin formed beneath the control material were significantly smaller than those formed beneath any of the four lining materials. In the first 98 days the rate of formation of tertiary dentin beneath calcium hydroxide (Calxyl) was significantly greater than that beneath the material containing corticosteroid (Ledermix cement). In the last 21 days there was no difference in daily rates of tertiary dentin production beneath all of the lining materials. With all the lining materials there was a highly significant difference between the daily amounts of tertiary dentin formed in the first 6 weeks and those in the last 11 weeks.\r"

Seventy human maxillary anterior teeth were chosen. The root canal systems were cleansed and shaped, and the teeth were assigned to six groups of 10 each. The root canals were obturated with gutta-percha and Grossman sealer, and the apical 2 mm of each root was resected. In all groups a retrofilling preparation was made to a depth of a number 331 bur. The apical preparations were filled in the following manner: silver amalgam (group I), silver amalgam plus two layers of varnish (group II), Ketac-Silver plus two layers of varnish (group III), Ketac-Silver without varnish (group IV), Ketac-Fil plus two layers of varnish (group V), Ketac-Fil without varnish (group VI), and Ketac-Bond (group VII). All the root surfaces with the exception of 2 mm from the resected line were coated with two layers of clear varnish. All the teeth were immersed in methylene blue for 24 hours. After vertical sectioning, dye penetration was measured under a dissecting microscope. The mean apical leakage (in millimeters) was as follows: I = 0.57, II = 0.39, III = 0.22, IV = 0.54, V = 0.11, VI = 0.46, and VII = 0.17. One-way analysis of variance performed on the group means indicated that Ketac-Fil with varnish (group V) and Ketac-Bond (group VII) had significantly less leakage than other groups (p less than 0.05). This study indicates that Ketac-Fil and Ketac-Bond may have potential as retrofilling materials.\r"

Approximately one half of the cases were in Hispanic children, but one third were in black children. Only 11% were foreign-born. Diagnosis resulted from case contact investigation in 50% of cases, routine tuberculin screening in 6%, and evaluation of an ill child in 44%. Intrathoracic disease alone was present in 77% of cases, and extrathoracic disease in 23%, including involvement of the cervical and supraclavicular lymph nodes, meninges, brain, liver, and skin. Gastric aspirates yielded Mycobacterium tuberculosis from 39% of the children with pulmonary disease. Of six children infected with drug-resistant tuberculosis, two became critically ill before referral because the probability of resistance was not recognized by the referring physician. Presently, 94% of patients have successfully completed therapy, which has been shortened from 12 to 18 months to 6 to 9 months. However, 39% were noncompliant with treatment and required twice-weekly supervised therapy to complete treatment. Tuberculosis remains a serious cause of morbidity in children; specific expertise in obtaining cultures, selecting drugs, and assuring compliance is crucial for adequate results.\r"

Therefore, a set of revised DRGs, pediatric modified DRGs (PM-DRGs), have been developed. Use of PM-DRGs substantially improves the classification of neonates in the following ways: a single pediatric modified major diagnostic category has been defined to include only and all neonates (patients younger than 29 days of age when admitted to the hospital); deaths and transfers of newborns are no longer combined into a single group; birth weight (rather than diagnosis) is used as the primary variable to differentiate categories of neonates; and duration of mechanical ventilation, presence of major problems, and surgery are used to define specific PM-DRGs. A total of 46 PM-DRGs have been developed to replace the 7 DRGs for neonates. Based on a sample of discharged patients from 13 children's hospitals, the overall variance reduction in duration of stay for neonates using PM-DRGs was 38.7% compared with 20.4% for DRGs. Variance reduction for PM-DRGs was 45.9% compared with 16.3% for DRGs when operating cost per case was used instead of duration of stay. After removing outliers at 150 days, the duration of stay variance reduction was 53.3% vs 23.6%, respectively, and the operating cost variance reduction was 58.8% vs 17.8%, respectively.\r"

These interactions are mediated by two functionally independent domains of the molecule: the catalytic domain (at the carboxyl terminus) and the growth factor domain (at the amino terminus). We have now investigated whether PAI-1 can bind and inhibit receptor-bound uPA. Binding of 125I-labeled ATF (amino-terminal fragment of uPA) to human U937 monocyte-like cells can be competed for by uPA-PAI-1 complexes, but not by PAI-1 alone. Performed 125I-labeled uPA-PAI-1 complexes can bind to uPA receptor with the same binding specificity as uPA. PAI-1 also binds to, and inhibits the activity of, receptor-bound uPA in U937 cells, as shown in U937 cells by a caseinolytic plaque assay. Plasminogen activator activity of these cells is dependent on exogenous uPA, is competed for by receptor-binding diisopropyl fluorophosphate-treated uPA, and is inhibited by the addition of PAI-1. In conclusion, in U937 cells the binding to the receptor does not shield uPA from the action of PAI-1. The possibility that in adherent cells a different localization of PAI-1 and uPA leads to protection of uPA from PAI-1 is to be considered.\r"

Radioactive phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate binding analysis indicated that a cysteine-rich zinc-finger-like sequence was essential for protein kinase C to bind phorbol ester and that one of two sequences was sufficient for the phorbol ester binding. Conserved region C2, another region in the regulatory domain, was apparently needed for the enzyme to require Ca2+ for phorbol ester binding activity.\r"

The derived amino acid sequences show that they are 45% identical to each other and to G alpha protein subunits from mammals and yeast.

To determine whether these tubules are evanescent, and to investigate their temporal relationships with other endocytic intermediates, we studied these tubules during oocyte vitellogenesis in the temperature-sensitive mutant Drosophila melanogaster, shibiretsl. Raising the temperature of shibire oocytes for 1 min from 19 degrees C to 29 degrees C caused a loss of these membranous tubules. The percentage of membrane in tubules decreased from 36% at 19 degrees C to 1.5% after 5 min at 29 degrees C. Concomitantly, the amount of surface membrane increased from 64% at 19 degrees C to 98% after 5 min at 29 degrees C, causing surface membrane invaginations to extend deeper into the cortex. At 29 degrees C the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane was studded with coated pits, and the extracellular face was coated with electron-dense material. Return from 29 degrees C to either 19 degrees C or 26 degrees C for 1-2 min produced a rapid reappearance of tubules containing extracellular horseradish peroxidase in the cortex. These data suggest that tubular intermediates are evanescent structures, and that temperature shock (i) rapidly blocks their formation from the plasma membrane, (ii) causes existing tubules to rapidly recycle to the plasma membrane, and (iii) is rapidly reversed, as newly formed tubules derive their membrane and content from the cell surface.\r"

Pretreatment of cells with ACTH, caused in a time-(maximum effect at 48 hr) and dose-(ED50 approximately 10(-11) M, Vmax = 10(-10) to 10(-9) M) dependent manner an increase in ACTH binding. This was due to a 4-fold increase in the number of binding sites without modification of the binding affinity. The same pretreatment also enhanced the cAMP response to further ACTH stimulation in a dose-dependent manner (ED50 approximately 10(-11) M) and to a lesser extent the response to forskolin. However, pretreatment with higher concentrations of ACTH (10(-8) M) reduced the binding and the cAMP response when compared to the effect of 10(-9) M. These ACTH effects, which were mimicked by 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, required de novo protein synthesis. Pretreatment with 10(-13) to 10(-11) M ACTH also enhanced the steroidogenic responsiveness to further hormonal stimulation. However, at higher concentrations the hormone induced an apparent steroidogenic desensitization that was probably related to a depletion of endogenous cholesterol, since cortisol production in the presence of 22-(R)-hydroxycholesterol was increased. Neither angiotensin-II nor atrial natriuretic factor alone modified ACTH receptors, but angiotensin-II partially blocked the stimulatory effect of ACTH. Thus, ACTH is one of the few polypeptide hormones having a positive trophic effect on its own receptors and target-cell responsiveness.\r"

Both tandem duplications and triplications in this region were found in both populations. Detailed analysis of 86 chromosome 2 lines revealed restriction site and allozyme polymorphisms in the transcriptional unit: two restriction sites and the allozymes [fast (F) or slow (S)] were polymorphic among both duplication-bearing chromosomes and those carrying the standard sequence. This finding suggests recurrent recombination and/or gene conversion in this 5-kilobase-pair region. The differences observed for restriction site and allozyme haplotypes among the triplicated sequence both within and between populations, together with the distribution in natural populations, suggest a relatively recent ancestry of the triplication events and an independent origin in respective populations. Such events may represent the process of the formation of multigene families [compare Ohta, T. (1987) Genetics 115, 207-213]. Finally, the evolution of this type of polymorphism is discussed.\r"

Primer-extension and RNase protection assays show that the gene consists of eight exons and has a single transcription-start point. RNase protection mapping and comparison of the genomic sequence from three different cDNA clones reveal that three protein isoforms of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase are produced by alternative processing of 3' exons. Two of the isoforms differ from the third by the addition of either three or ten amino acids to their C-terminal ends. Transcripts corresponding to two of the isoforms are expressed during both larval and adult stages, while the third isoform is produced only in adults.\r"

By contrast, only a small proportion of KJ23a+ thymocytes from SJL mice that had differentiated in the thymus of SWR or DBA/1 mice was CD4-8+, whereas a high proportion of CD4+8- cells expressed V beta 17a. Further, an intermediate proportion of KJ23a+ thymocytes that had derived from SJL donor mice was present on CD4-8+ thymocytes that had developed in B10.A(4R) thymus. These findings demonstrate that the appearance of a particular subpopulation of thymocytes (CD4-8+ with a beta chain of T-cell antigen receptor identified as V beta 17a) is determined by the histocompatibility complex products that are expressed in the thymic microenvironment in which the T cells develop.\r"

  ".W": "Approximately 80% of hematopoietic malignancies of the B-cell lineage carry only one or two immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangements indicating their clonal origin. These rearrangements due to the recombination of various variable, diversity, and joining regions of the heavy-chain gene segments during B-cell commitment result in a region called complementarity-determining region III (CDR-III). This region, which encompasses the diversity region of the heavy-chain segment, because of extensive somatic mutations, provides a DNA-encoded signature specific for each B-cell clone. CDR-III sequences were obtained from DNA of pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia by using suitable primers and the polymerase chain reaction. The sequences were used to generate diagnostic probes that hybridized only to the amplified CDR-III of leukemic cells from which the sequences were derived. With these probes, leukemic cells could be detected when diluted 1:10,000 with other cells. By cloning the amplified CDR-III into recombinant libraries residual leukemic cells were accurately quantitated in bone-marrow samples from repeated relapses and remissions in one case of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. During a clinical remission lasting greater than 7 mo, malignant cells were present in marrow at greater than 1 per 1000 cells. These findings indicate that custom-made diagnostic probes will be useful in accurate quantitation of malignant cells in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients in clinical remission and will allow investigation of the biological significance of low or high numbers of residual leukemic cells in evolution of that disease.\r"

However, to date, a direct effect of Pb on intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) has not been demonstrated. 19F NMR in combination with 1,2-bis(2-amino-5-fluorophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (5F-BAPTA) was used to simultaneously measure [Ca2+]i and intracellular free Pb2+ concentration ([Pb2+]i) in the rat osteoblastic bone cell line ROS 17/2.8. The basal concentration of [Ca2+]i in ROS 17/2.8 cells was measured to be 128 +/- 24 nM. Treatment with Pb2+ at 5 and 25 microM produced sustained 50% and 120% increases in [Ca2+]i, respectively, over a time course of 5 hr. At a medium Pb2+ concentration of 25 microM, the entry of Pb2+ into ROS 17/2.8 cells yielded measurable [Pb2+]i in cultured cells. Collectively, these findings advance the hypothesis that Pb toxicity is mediated, in part, through perturbations in [Ca2+]i.\r"

  ".W": "This condensed review of a complex method can provide only a general view of what clinical decision analysis is and why it might be useful. It also should help clarify, however, what decision analysis is not: This is not a practical method for making most decisions in everyday clinical practice. The process of carrying out all the steps in a full, formal analysis is much too time consuming to be applied to the dozens of important decisions clinicians make each day. The method should be used selectively to ensure that the time invested in analysis will pay off in a practical way in practice. Formal analyses should be attempted only for decisions that are made frequently, have important consequences, and provoke some sort of significant controversy, uncertainty, or discontent with the results less formal-decision making achieves. Decision analysis is not a substitute for all other methods of decision making. To suggest that this is the only tool clinicians need would be a little like suggesting that a balanced diet could consist exclusively of broccoli. Intuitive judgments, use of theoretical models, knowledge-problem coupling, and hypothesis-oriented algorithms for clinicians all provide important tools for improving patient care. Often these tools can be combined effectively with decision analysis, but at other times they will be superior on their own. Decision analysis is not an entirely unfamiliar method, and it does not always need to include all component steps to be useful.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Electrocardiographic-gated T1-weighted images were obtained before and for 1 hour after injection of 400 mumol/kg of Mn-DPDP. On T1-weighted images obtained before injection of Mn-DPDP. no significant differences in signal intensity were observed between normal and infarcted regions. Use of Mn-DPDP permitted delineation of the area of infarction. The pattern of enhancement in the injured zone was different for occlusive and reperfused myocardial infarcts. In rats with occlusive infarcts, In rats with occlusive infarcts, three well-defined zones were seen. Epicardium and endocardium were enhanced, while the midmyocardial zone was hypointense. The midmyocardial signal intensity gradually increased during the 60 minutes after injection. In rats with reperfused infarcts, the injured area was uniformly and intensely enhanced. Histologic examination confirmed the presence and location of myocardial infarct. Mn-DPDP may improve the detection and delineation of acute myocardial infarcts, demonstrate perfusion of the infarct, and permit discrimination between reperfused and occlusive infarcts.\r"

Phylogenetic variation according to recently proposed secondary structure models was used to identify structural elements of the RNase P RNA that are dispensable for catalysis. A simplified RNase P RNA that consists only of evolutionarily conserved features was designed, synthesized, and characterized. Although the simplified RNA (Min 1 RNA) is only 263 nucleotides in length, in contrast to the 354 to 417 nucleotides of naturally occurring RNase P RNAs, its specificity of pre-tRNA cleavage is identical to that of the native enzymes. Moreover, the catalytic efficiencies of the Min 1 RNA and the native RNA enzymes are similar. These results focus the search for the catalytic elements of RNase P RNAs to their conserved structure.\r"

  ".W": "High-resolution differential interference contrast microscopy and digital imaging of the fluorescent calcium indicator dye fura-2 were performed simultaneously in single rat salivary gland acinar cells to examine the effects of muscarinic stimulation on cell volume and cytoplasmic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). Agonist stimulation of fluid secretion is initially associated with a rapid tenfold increase in [Ca2+]i as well as a substantial cell shrinkage. Subsequent changes of cell volume in the continued presence of agonist are tightly coupled to dynamic levels of [Ca2+]i, even during [Ca2+]i oscillations. Experiments with Ca2+ chelators and ionophores showed that physiological elevations of [Ca2+]i are necessary and sufficient to cause changes in cell volume. The relation between [Ca2+]i and cell volume suggests that the latter reflects the secretory state of the acinar cell. Agonist-induced changes in [Ca2+]i, by modulating specific ion permeabilities, result in solute movement into or out of the cell. The resultant cell volume changes may be important in modulating salivary secretion.\r"

The organisms used were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The significant differences in in vitro adherence of the different bacterial species to the various catheters were then evaluated in vivo by intravenous injection of a single bolus of 1 X 10(5) organisms via tail vein of rats with previously placed catheters in their superior venae cavae. There was no association between the in vitro bacterial adherence and the tendency of the in vivo catheters to become colonized. Results of scanning electron microscopy of clean catheters and those removed from the rats showed obvious differences in surface characteristics and in clot adhesion between the catheters. These characteristics did not correlate with bacterial adherence in vitro or colonization in vivo. It is concluded that laboratory studies of bacterial adherence to, physical characteristics of, and thrombogenicity of intravenous catheters do not necessarily translate into resistance to clinical catheter sepsis.\r"

Our purpose was to determine the optimal route of delivery of UG for intestinal regeneration. In 22 New Zealand white rabbits (2.1 to 3.4 kg) 2 X 5 cm ileal defects were patched with adjacent cecal serosal surface. Group I (n = 6) served as controls. Group II (n = 5), group III (n = 6), and group IV (n = 5) received UG, 1.5 micrograms/kg/hr, intravenously, subcutaneously, and intraluminally via miniosmotic pumps. Neomucosal growth was assessed 7 days after patching. Serum UG levels were detectable in only the intravenous group. Coverage of the patched defect and neomucosal area was significantly greater and contraction of the defect less in the groups receiving UG (p less than 0.05). Neomucosal area was highest in the intravenous group (286 +/- 16 mm2), intermediate in groups III and IV (236 +/- 19 and 215 +/- 20 mm2), and lowest in the control group (152 +/- 17 mm2; p less than 0.05). Sucrase and maltase activities were significantly higher in the intravenous group. Crypt cell production rate and ornithine decarboxylase activity were greater in the UG-treated animals. UG stimulated intestinal regeneration by all routes of delivery. The intravenous route had the greatest effect and was associated with the highest serum levels of UG. These findings have implications for the mechanism of the trophic effect of UG on the intestinal epithelium.\r"

A 15% of total-body-surface third-degree burn was produced in 24 adult sheep with lung and burn lymph fistulas. Eight sheep were killed at 12 hours and eight at 48 hours. At 12 hours we noted increased lung tissue lipid peroxidation, lung congestion, and neutrophil sequestration, in addition to a 30% decrease in lung compliance. Lung permeability and water content were not increased. Increased release of lipid peroxides and prostanoids were noted from burn tissue, as evidenced by increased plasma levels of malondialdehyde and conjugated dienes that remained elevated for about 8 hours and were decreased with wound removal. The lung inflammatory response was still present at 48 hours, the cells being primarily neutrophils. Nevertheless, the lipid peroxidation process, as measured by lung tissue malondialdehyde, had resolved. There was no evidence of burn tissue infection, measured by quantitative culture, to explain the persistent increase in lung inflammatory cells. Excision and closure of the burn wound at 3 hours postburn in eight sheep attenuated the lipid peroxidation and compliance changes but did not decrease the neutrophil sequestration. We conclude that burn injury results in a local wound oxidant release that leads to lipid peroxidation, both in wounds and in lung, as well as lung inflammation. The lipid peroxidation process may be attenuated by removal of the wound. The neutrophil sequestration is not altered, however, indicating this response occurs very early after injury, probably as a result of oxidant-initiated complement activation.\r"

  ".U": "89299726\r", 
  ".W": "This prospective, randomized, controlled trial, based in a Veterans Administration Hospital general medicine clinic, compared the cost effectiveness of two behaviorally oriented interventions designed to reduce physicians' drug prescribing costs. Clinical pharmacists visited one group of 11 physicians during weekly clinic sessions to counterdetail the prescribing of certain targeted drugs. A second group of 10 physicians were given data each week comparing their individual prescribing costs to those of their colleagues (peer-comparison feedback). A control group of 10 physicians received neither intervention. Written patient-specific suggestions for cost-effective prescribing were employed in both intervention groups. Baseline prescribing costs were monitored through the hospital's computer during a three-month, preintervention period and a seven-month intervention period. The 2026 written suggestions made by the doctors of pharmacy resulted in 613 (30.3 percent) prescribing changes, including deletion, substitution, or change in dosage of targeted drugs. There were no intergroup differences in the response to written suggestions. However, the group receiving face-to-face visits from the clinical pharmacists achieved lower average prescription costs than the control group during seven of eight months. Intergroup differences were statistically significant (p less than 0.05) during three of the last five months of the study. The face-to-face meeting intervention was cost-effective, saving +478 per physician over seven months after accounting for Pharm.D. salary costs. There was no significant decrease in the number of prescriptions written by the face-to-face group compared with the control group, suggesting that drug substitution rather than deletion was the method used by physicians to lower drug costs. No savings resulted from the use of peer-comparison feedback. We conclude that personal visits by a Pharm.D. are a cost-effective technique for reducing physicians' prescribing costs, and are superior to peer-comparison feedback.\r"

A pair of 10 MHz piezoelectric crystals and an electromagnetic flow probe were placed on the left circumflex coronary artery, under sterile conditions, to measure the epicardial coronary diameter and coronary blood flow, respectively. A polyethylene tube for drug infusion was inserted into the circumflex coronary artery proximal to the sonomicrometers. In the conscious dogs (n = 8), iopamidol, 2 ml and 5 ml increased the coronary diameter by 64 +/- 19 microns and 66 +/- 19 microns and coronary blood flow by 35 +/- 10% and 61 +/- 18%, respectively (p less than 0.01 vs control level). Meglumine diatrizoate, 2 ml and 5 ml, increased coronary diameter by 102 +/- 20 microns and 114 +/- 18 microns and coronary blood flow by 87 +/- 32% and 107 +/- 26%, respectively (p less than 0.01 vs control level). In the anesthetized dogs (n = 6), a bolus intracoronary injection of 5 ml iopamidol and meglumine diatrizoate within few seconds increased the coronary diameter by 103 +/- 23 microns and 164 +/- 39 microns (p less than 0.05) and increased the coronary blood flow by 126 +/- 33% and 180 +/- 40% (p less than 0.05), respectively. Balloon denudation of the endothelium was performed in six anesthetized dogs. The increases in coronary diameter and coronary blood flow after a bolus injection of contrast medium remained the same after the denudation. Thus application of iopamidol seems to be more suitable than meglumine diatrizoate for quantitative coronary angiography because of the milder and more transient effects on coronary circulation.\r"

The Seattle Myocardial Infarction, Triage and Intervention (MITI) trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of thrombolytic therapy initiated by paramedics in the prehospital setting. Phase I of the trial indicates that one-half of the patients would receive prehospital therapy in the field within the first hour of symptoms, substantially sooner than what can be achieved in the hospital. Phase II of MITI, in a nonrandomized trial, will compare the use of intravenous t-PA in the field with t-PA administered in the emergency department.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the reversibility of the effects of flecainide on accessory pathways, electrophysiologic studies were performed in the drug-free control state, after flecainide loading and with isoproterenol infusion during flecainide treatment in 12 patients with symptomatic preexcitation syndrome. After the baseline drug-free evaluation, oral flecainide was given in dosages of 50 to 200 mg twice daily (mean daily dose 282 +/- 75) for at least 4 days before the repeat electrophysiologic study. Isoproterenol infusion was given in dosages of 1 to 4 micrograms/min to increase the heart rate at rest by 50%. Anterograde block in the accessory pathway was observed in 3 patients with flecainide therapy, whereas in the other patients the anterograde refractory period increased from 243 +/- 20 to 315 +/- 23 ms (p less than 0.05). The shortest preexcited RR interval during atrial fibrillation lengthened from 234 +/- 27 ms before flecainide to 313 +/- 38 ms (p less than 0.05). Retrograde block occurred in 2 patients after flecainide, whereas the retrograde refractory period of the accessory pathway increased from 247 +/- 26 to 337 +/- 45 ms in the other patients. Orthodromic atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia, inducible in 10 patients before therapy, became noninducible in 3 patients. Its rate was significantly slowed in the other 7 patients (from 346 +/- 50 to 471 +/- 81 ms). In 2 patients the tachycardia was nonsustained during flecainide treatment. Atrial fibrillation, inducible in all patients at baseline, was rendered nonsustained and more difficult to induce in 7 patients with flecainide. When isoproterenol was infused during flecainide treatment, complete anterograde (3 patients) or retrograde block (2 patients) persisted in the accessory pathway.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Clear cells (\"Hurler\" cells) were identified within the myocardium and endocardium of both infants. We propose that the ventricular mural accumulation of mucopolysaccharides induced extensive proliferation of elastic or collagen fibers within the endocardium. Cardiac failure may precede recognition of clinical and roentgenographic features of Hurler syndrome. Our findings and a literature review suggest that certain heritable storage disorders, including mucopolysaccharidosis I, should be considered when infants have clinical electrocardiographic and echocardiographic findings consistent with endocardial fibroelastosis or have autopsy-documented endocardial fibroelastosis.\r"

The 13 subjects with NF1 had no excess of mental retardation, attention-deficit disorder, or specific learning disorders (using Wilcoxon's Signed Rank Test and McNemar's Test for Symmetry). These subjects, however, had significantly higher scores for subtle neurologic abnormalities (21 vs 6) and significantly lower full-scale IQ scores (94 vs 105) than their unaffected siblings. The IQ scores of the affected subjects were not clustered at the lower end of the scale but showed a slight downward shift in distribution compared with those of their siblings. In addition, a visual-spatial orientation deficit was present in eight of nine affected subjects so evaluated. The findings suggest that subjects with NF1 have a widespread alteration of the brain during development that manifests as one or more specific types of neuropsychologic deficits.\r"

The medical literature has reported a considerable amount of experience which attests to its ease of placement and low incidence of complications associated with placement. The \"push\" and \"pull\" techniques both have been used effectively to establish access to the stomach. Innovations by numerous practitioners have helped reduce some of the minor complications associated with percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. Serious complications from pulmonary aspiration and stomal infection remain important management issues after gastrostomy placement and initiation of feeding. The adequacy of nutritional support should be the final measure of successful PEG placement.\r"

The aim of the present study was to determine whether the beneficial metabolic effects of low glycemic index diets observed in noncirrhotic diabetics also occurred in patients with cirrhosis. Therefore, for one day, five patients with cirrhosis were fed diets in which low glycemic index foods were substituted, replacing those which produced higher blood glucose rises. Reduction in the estimated glycemic impact of the diet by approximately 30% reduced the mean incremental blood glucose level over the day by 40 +/- 5% (p less than 0.001). Measurement at breakfast of amino acid, insulin, and gastric inhibitory polypeptide profiles confirmed a reduction of similar magnitude. No change was seen in pancreatic glucagon, whereas enteroglucagon levels tended to be higher. In view of these findings and the possible long-term benefits of chronic reduction of hyperinsulinism and alteration in amino acid metabolism, this approach to dietary management of cirrhosis warrants further consideration.\r"

Protein-energy status was also assessed by means of simultaneous measurement of triceps skinfold thickness, mid-arm muscle circumference, and serum albumin. Fifteen patients (group A) had extensive acute colitis (ulcerative or Crohn's colitis), and eight cases (group B) had small bowel or ileocecal Crohn's disease. Eighty-nine healthy subjects (36 men, 53 women, mean age 34 +/- 2 yr) acted as controls. In both groups of patients, the levels of biotin, folate, beta-carotene, and vitamins A, C, and B1 were significantly lower than in controls (p less than 0.01). Plasma levels of vitamin B12 were decreased only in group B (p less than 0.01), whereas riboflavin was lower in group A (p less than 0.01). The percentage of patients at risk of developing hypovitaminosis was 40% or higher for vitamin A, beta-carotene, folate, biotin, vitamin C, and thiamin in both groups of patients. Although some subjects had extremely low vitamin values, in no case were clinical symptoms of vitamin deficiency observed. Only a weak correlation was found between protein-energy nutritional parameters and vitamin values, probably due to the small size of the sample studied. The pathophysiological and clinical implications of the suboptimal vitamin status observed in acute inflammatory bowel disease are unknown. Further studies on long-term vitamin status and clinical outcome in these patients are necessary.\r"

The study lasted 4 months, with the first month a non-intervention, control period and the latter 3 months alternating in the sequence, treatment/placebo/treatment, or placebo/treatment/placebo. When symptoms during trial months were analyzed by the cumulative sum procedure, gastrointestinal symptoms were found to be independent of lactase treatment. We found a positive temporal association of the severity of both gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal symptomatology. In populations with a high prevalence of lactose deficiency, IBS symptoms appear to be independent of lactose maldigestion.\r"

Healing rates with nizatidine 300 mg h.s. were numerically, but not statistically significantly, superior to those with cimetidine 800 mg h.s. at each treatment period. Ulcer healing rates at Wk 2, 4, and 8 were 41% (78/191), 73% (130/179), and 81% (145/179) for nizatidine and 33% (60/184), 67% (116/174), and 75% (126/168) for cimetidine, respectively. Symptoms of peptic ulcer disease were similarly reduced at each treatment period by nizatidine and cimetidine. Patients with healed ulcers at either Wk 2 or Wk 4 were continued on therapy and an endoscopy was performed at Wk 8. Ulcer recurrence occurred in 10% of nizatidine-treated and 19% of cimetidine-treated patients at Wk 8 (p = 0.085). The observation of recurrence of duodenal ulcer while patients were receiving full-dose H2-receptor antagonist therapy has not been reported previously.\r"

However, S. japonicum eggs injected into the tail vein were gradually destroyed in the lungs. Hepatic fibrosis increased in the 1st few weeks after treatment and did not change significantly thereafter. Praziquantel, but not amoscanate, had an immediate toxic effect on the most mature eggs in the tissues which was accompanied by a marked but transient decrease in eggs passed in the feces. Less mature eggs appeared unaffected by the drug and the passage of eggs in the feces resumed as these matured. Egg passage then ceased as the supply of viable eggs was exhausted.\r"

The progressive decline of virus infection rates in each generation suggests that these agents cannot be maintained indefinitely by TOT. No infection was observed in F1 progeny after female parents were fed through membranes with either virus. Transovarially infected females were able to transmit TOS virus by bite to a susceptible vertebrate. Venereal infection of P. perniciosus females mated to males transovarially infected with TOS virus was seen.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to compare the efficacy of four different types of perioperative intravenous nutritional support. Fifty-five patients undergoing routine major surgery were studied. They were prospectively assigned to one of four study groups. Group 1 received formal total parenteral nutrition (90 g amino acids, 3,000 calories as glucose, per day); Group 2, 100 g glucose per day; Group 3, 90 g amino acids per day; and Group 4, peripheral parenteral nutrition (90 g amino acids plus 1,600 calories, 60 percent as fat per day). Group 1 was maintained on therapy for 3 weeks and the other groups for 8 days. Nitrogen balance, maintenance of body cell mass, serum albumin levels, and maintenance of exercise capacity were measured. Patients receiving peripheral parenteral nutrition maintained their nutritional parameters, as did those receiving total parenteral nutrition. These infusions were both markedly superior to those receiving glucose alone or those receiving amino acids alone. Nitrogen balance was not correlated with maintenance of function, but maintenance of body cell mass was correlated with maintenance of exercise capacity (r = 0.66, p less than or equal to 0.01). We conclude that perioperative peripheral parenteral nutrition, in contradistinction to hypocaloric infusions of glucose or amino acids, is capable of maintaining postoperative muscle mass and function close to preoperative levels after major surgery, and in situations of relatively mild surgical stress, approaches the efficacy of total parenteral nutrition in this regard. A significant correlation exists between changes in body cell mass determined from isotope dilution and changes in the exercise capacity of large muscle masses.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether anti-allergic drugs can inhibit autonomic neurotransmission of airway smooth muscle, we studied the effect of sodium cromoglycate (SCG, Intal) and related anti-allergic drugs on electrically induced neurogenic contractions of isolated guinea pig bronchial muscle. Electrical field stimulation (8 Hz, 0.5 msec, 30 V) evoked a biphasic contraction of bronchial muscle, consisting of an initial phasic component followed by a sustained one which was mediated by cholinergic and non-cholinergic nerve stimulations, respectively. Sodium cromoglycate, tranilast, ketotifen, and azelastine at concentrations higher than 10(-6) M caused a concentration-dependent inhibition in the height of the non-cholinergically mediated contractions. The cholinergically mediated contractions were also inhibited by tranilast, ketotifen, and azelastine but not by SCG. Submaximal contractions of bronchial muscle evoked by exogenous substance P (2 X 10(-7) M) were less potently inhibited by these drugs than those by exogenous acetylcholine (2 X 10(-6) M). These results indicate that in isolated guinea pig bronchial muscle, anti-allergic drugs may inhibit non-cholinergic neurotransmission mainly by prejunctional reduction of the transmitter release and partly by postjunctional depression of the response.\r"

Three patients developed severe ventricular arrhythmias while taking flecainide for atrial fibrillation. Patient 1 had normal ventricular function and idiopathic atrial fibrillation. Treadmill exercise tests during digoxin therapy showed no ventricular arrhythmia; however, during flecainide therapy the patient developed ventricular flutter at his peak exercise level that required cardioversion. Patient 2 had normal ventricular function and a prosthetic mitral valve. During therapy with flecainide, 150 mg twice daily, he had an episode of sustained ventricular tachycardia, also at his peak exercise level. Patient 3 had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy but no previous ventricular arrhythmia. She died suddenly within 10 days of starting flecainide therapy. Judged from previous findings none of these patients was considered at high risk for proarrhythmia. These cases suggest a possible relation between vigorous exercise, atrial fibrillation, and the proarrhythmic properties of flecainide and indicate the limitations of classifying patients as \"high-risk\" or \"low-risk\" for proarrhythmic complications of anti-arrhythmic therapy.\r"

Subsequently, atonic drop attacks became the predominant epileptic pattern. Epileptogenic electrographic abnormalities were secondary generalized or multifocal. The lesions were detected by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in all patients. Bilateral symmetrical areas of thick cortex surrounding a large sulcus were seen. This syndrome consists of specific clinical, imaging, electroencephalographic, and epileptic features. It can be suspected clinically and confirmed by imaging studies. Callosotomy in two patients helped the intractable seizures.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism by which ethosuximide reduces thalamic low-threshold calcium current (LTCC) was analyzed using voltage-clamp techniques in acutely isolated ventrobasal complex neurons from rats and guinea pigs. The ethosuximide-induced reduction of LTCC was voltage dependent: it was most pronounced at more-hyperpolarized potentials and did not affect the time course of activation or inactivation of the current. Ethosuximide reduced LTCC without altering the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation or the time course of recovery from inactivation. Dimethadione reduced LTCC by a similar mechanism, while valproic acid had no effect on LTCC. We conclude that ethosuximide reduction of LTCC in thalamic neurons is consistent with a reduction in the number of available LTCC channels or in the single LTCC channel conductance, perhaps indicating a direct channel-blocking action of this drug. Given the importance of LTCC in thalamic oscillatory behavior, a reduction in this current by ethosuximide would be a mechanism of action compatible with the known anticonvulsant effects of this drug in typical absence seizures.\r"

Abnormalities consisted of an increased number of enlarged mitochondria with complicated cristae in the pericytes of capillaries, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells of the small arteries, including terminal arterioles and precapillary sphincters, predominantly in smooth muscle cells. On statistical analysis, the number of mitochondria and the ratio of mitochondrial area to the total area of the smooth muscle cells were increased approximately tenfold (p less than 0.001). Although stroke-like episodes were not present, similar mitochondrial abnormalities in blood vessels were found in 1 patient who had the encephalomyopathic form of complex IV deficiency and in 2 patients in whom the primary chemical defects could not be clearly defined. Such abnormalities in small arteries might be responsible for the occasional occurrence of transient cerebral ischemia causing stroke-like episodes and progressive mental deterioration.\r"

To isolate cell lines with or without oxidase activity from a single muscle sample, primary cultured cells were transformed by replication origin-defective simian virus 40, and then cloned. The clones were examined by cytochemical staining for cytochrome c oxidase activity. Eight myogenic clones were completely devoid of activity, while the other myogenic and nonmyogenic clones were not. Deficiency of cytochrome c oxidase was stable in culture for at least a year after serial passaging. The amount of mitochondrial DNA in cytochrome c oxidase-deficient cells was the same as in control cells, and no deletion in the mitochondrial DNA was detected. Protein synthesis in mitochondria of the subunits of cytochrome c oxidase and subunit 6 of the ATP synthase complex was markedly decreased, whereas synthesis of the other subunits encoded by mitochondrial DNA was normal. These cloned cell lines provide an excellent system for clarifying the cause of mitochondrial myopathy and for investigating nuclear-mitochondrial genetic interaction.\r"

Male Sprague-Dawley rats (195 +/- 5g) received 50 ml/day of an enteral regimen containing 50 kcal, 2 g amino acids, and 40% nonprotein calories as lipid for three days. Protein kinetics were estimated by using a continuous L-[1-14C] leucine infusion technique on day 2. Thermally injured rats enterally fed MCT/fish oil yielded significantly higher daily and cumulative nitrogen balances (p less than or equal to 0.025) and rectus muscle (39%) FSR (p less than or equal to 0.05) when compared with safflower oil. MCT/fish oil showed a 22% decrease (p less than or equal to 0.005) in per cent flux oxidized and a 7% (p less than or equal to 0.05) decrease in total energy expenditure (TEE) versus safflower oil. A 15% increase in liver FSR was accompanied by a significant elevation (p less than or equal to 0.025) in total liver protein with MCT/fish oil. This novel SL shares the properties of other structured lipids in that it reduces the net protein catabolic effects of burn injury, in part, by influencing tissue protein synthetic rates. The reduction in TEE is unique to MCT/fish oil and may relate to the ability of fish oil to diminish the injury response.\r"

This study analyzed the experience of one surgeon (P.S.) performing PEG in 50 patients with advanced oropharyngeal cancer. The records of 54 such patients consecutively referred for PEG at the Massachusetts General Hospital were reviewed. A pull-through PEG technique was used. The procedure was successful in 50 patients (success rate, 93%). Failures were caused by esophageal stricture, respiratory distress, and hiatus hernia. The two patients with insurmountable esophageal stricture had piriform sinus tumors. Cancer in this location and pharyngoesophageal strictures were predictive of PEG failure. A single death, 21 days after endoscopy, was caused by pneumonia. The only major complications were two transient respiratory arrests. Neither patient had a tracheostomy in place, and both had unresected cancer present. Minor complications were transient gastroparesis, pneumonia, unexplained fever, and a broken traction suture. There were no wound or intraabdominal infections and no episodes of bleeding. While PEG was successful in 93% of these difficult patients, with few complications, results could be improved by tracheostomy or resection performed before PEG in patients with tumors near the airway and dilatation of troublesome esophageal strictures under endoscopic view before PEG.\r"

More than 80% of urethral catheter users were women. Among men, we found equal prevalences of urethral and condom catheter use. Previous studies have demonstrated long-term use of urethral catheters to be associated with almost universal bacteriuria of a polymicrobial and dynamic nature. Combining these data suggests that long-term catheter-associated bacteriuria is the most common infection in American health care facilities.\r"

No significant differences in prolactin or free thyroxine levels were found, but the cortisol level was higher and the total thyroxine level lower in the hypogonadotropic group. The patients in the hypogonadotropic group also seemed more seriously ill, with a longer duration of hospitalization, an increased total number of days in the intensive care unit, an increased number of days in the intensive care unit before gonadotropin sampling, a higher incidence of parenteral hyperalimentation, lower serum albumin levels, and higher mortality. Stimulation of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone performed on 10 patients showed a blunted response in patients with baseline LH and FSH levels of 10 IU/L or less. Of 10 patients followed up sequentially, 6 showed a rise in gonadotropin levels that paralleled recovery, 1 died with low gonadotropin levels, and 3 continued to have low gonadotropin levels 17, 34, and 82 days, respectively, after initial screening. Critically ill postmenopausal women may exhibit a marked fall in gonadotropin, LH, and FSH levels. This disease in gonadotropin levels in response to illness is reversible and results from pituitary unresponsiveness to gonadorelin hydrochloride.\r"

In all cases, vimentin stained endothelial as well as \"myxoma\" (stromal) cells. In contrast, factor VIII only stained endothelial cells. In 16 cases, desmin stained cells in the vascular structures; in 5 cases, desmin stained myxoma cells. In 6 cases, S100 protein stained the myxoma cells strongly. Myoglobin was absent in all cases. In 1 case, CAM 5.2 and AE1/AE3 stained glandular structures. The results indicate the following: that most cardiac myxomas are true neoplasms derived from \"embryonal rests\"; that the various mesenchymal cells found in cardiac myxomas (myxoma cells, endothelial cells, smooth-muscle cells, fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, and chondroid cells), express differentiation, not histogenesis; that, apparently, only the myxoma cells are neoplastic; and that the glandular structures infrequently found in cardiac myxomas originate from entrapped foregut rests.\r"

  ".W": "Would economic benefit result from performing endoscopic cholangiography and removal of common bile duct stones prior to cholecystectomy in patients who are suspected preoperatively of having choledocholithiasis? In this study, 173 patients had cholecystectomy and 30 (17%) had common bile duct exploration. Records of these patients were reviewed as were those of 31 patients who had only endoscopic cholangiography and endoscopic stone removal. Cost estimates were based on local charges. Cholecystectomy with common bile duct exploration was $6730 more per patient than cholecystectomy alone. Endoscopic cholangiography and endoscopic stone removal was 87% successful in removing duct stones. Had endoscopic cholangiography and endoscopic stone removal been performed preoperatively in patients undergoing cholecystectomy who had suspected choledocholithiasis, 21 of 30 common bile duct explorations could theoretically have been eliminated. This would have saved $85,526 or $2851 per patient undergoing common bile duct exploration. Our analysis suggests that patients who require cholecystectomy and have suspected choledocholithiasis may be treated more cost-effectively by performing endoscopic cholangiography and endoscopic stone removal immediately prior to cholecystectomy than by cholecystectomy and operative common bile duct exploration.\r"

The findings recorded by this method were compared with those obtained by computed tomography (CT) scan and neurological examination. The EEG-CSA findings were divided into four categories according to their severity. EEG-CSA was shown to be very sensitive in detecting the first signs of a forthcoming neurological disease. Following 11 months of observation, 22 out of 40 (55%) neurologically asymptomatic individuals who, at the beginning of the study showed some EEG-CSA abnormalities, had clinical evidence of a subacute encephalitis whereas only two out of 37 (5.4%) subjects who were previously free of EEG-CSA abnormalities had some signs of neurological disease (P less than 0.001) after the same period. Of those remaining who were already symptomatic when the study started, the neurological progression of HIV infection was also monitored by EEG-CSA.\r"

Relevant clinical features not included in the WHO case definition were also evaluated. Thirty-four out of the 221 children (15.4%) were HIV seropositive. Although the specificity of the WHO case definition was high (92%), the sensitivity and the positive predictive value (PPV) were low (41 and 48%, respectively). The following individual signs had a PPV at least equal to the complete WHO case definition: chronic diarrhoea (47%), respiratory distress secondary to lower respiratory tract infection (50%), oral candidiasis (53%), parotitis (67%), generalized lymphadenopathy (88%), and herpes zoster infection (100%). When logistic regression analysis was done on the nine variables included in the WHO case definition, confirmed maternal infection was the best predictive variable for HIV seropositivity in children (P less than 10(-5). We further excluded the serological status of the mother from the analysis and performed a stepwise logistic regression analysis on the 18 clinical signs and symptoms for which information had been collected. Those signs and symptoms contributing the most to the regression were: respiratory distress, chronic diarrhoea and generalized lymphadenopathy. Based on these findings, we propose a simplified clinical case definition for paediatric AIDS in Africa with better sensitivity, specificity and PPV than the WHO case definition. Further work is needed using this approach to develop case definitions useful for epidemiological surveillance and for case management.\r"

In the majority of men, nef-specific antibodies, once detected, persisted (67.6%). In some men, nef-specific antibodies were only transiently (6.8%), or intermittently (5.3%), detectable. No nef-specific antibodies were found in the remaining men (20.3%). Nef-specific antibodies were elicited early in infection, but rarely (2/72 men) prior to seroconversion for antibodies to HIV-1 structural proteins. An absent, transient, or intermittent nef-specific antibody response was significantly associated with the absence or disappearance of antibodies to HIV-1 core proteins, with (re)appearance and persistence of HIV-1 core antigen and with the presence of low CD4+ cell numbers, i.e. profiles previously shown to be predictive of rapid disease progression. Although more cases of AIDS and AIDS-related disease (21/86 versus 28/180) occurred in the nef-specific antibody-negative group than in the nef-specific antibody-positive group, this difference did not reach significance.\r"

If no disease progression was observed, operable patients underwent surgery 4 to 6 weeks after completion of radiation therapy. A thoracotomy with a gastric pull-through operation was performed in the first six patients. Subsequently, a transhiatal (\"blunt\") esophagectomy was used. Twenty-five patients had squamous cell histology and four had adenocarcinoma. Of 25 patients with squamous cell carcinoma, 13 underwent esophagectomy. The clinical complete response rate was 61% (eight of 13 patients), with a pathologic complete remission documented in five of 13 patients (38%). The overall local tumor sterilization rate was 53% (seven of 13 patients). In the 12 patients who did not undergo surgery after chemoradiotherapy, four had a complete clinical response (33%) and five had a partial response (41%). Symptoms or signs of local disease recurrence or stricture were noticed in ten of 12 patients who did not undergo surgery (83%), compared with 28% of patients who underwent surgery. The median survival time of the group receiving surgery was 10 months, compared with 5 months for those who did not undergo operation (P = 0.027). Patients undergoing transhiatal esophagectomy had shorter postoperative hospital stays and fewer serious complications, compared with patients undergoing transthoracic esophagectomy. The use of chemoradiotherapy and transhiatal esophagectomy for esophageal carcinoma should be evaluated using alternative sequences of treatment (e.g., postoperative therapy) to reduce toxicity while maintaining local control of disease.\r"

Carcinoma of the cervix appears to be behaving like a systemic disease. Therefore, systemic measures should be considered in its therapy. The authors report the initial experience with the use of mitomycin C as a single agent adjuvant in 16 patients with Stage IB carcinoma of the cervix who had undergone Wertheim radical hysterectomy and were thought to be in this high-risk group. Fourteen of the patients are alive and free of disease after durations of follow-up ranging from 16 to 38 months, the disease-free survival at a median follow-up of 29 months being 87.5%. One patient required discontinuation of adjuvant chemotherapy because of severe marrow toxicity; however, in view of the presence of a multiple risk factors, pelvic irradiation was given instead. She died 13 months later from disseminated disease. A second patient died 6 months later from congestive cardiac failure.\r"

Loose components, whether cemented or not, demonstrated statistically higher prostaglandin E2 levels in the surrounding membrane compared to the nonloose group. Collagenase and M-collagenase levels were absent or insignificantly low in all specimens; no detectable interleukin 1 beta was found. This suggests that prostaglandin E2 may be associated with the bone lysis associated with prosthesis loosening.\r"

The effect of rioprostil (0.3 mg, twice a day) was investigated on acenocoumarol (10 mg per subject, n = 7) and phenoprocoumon (0.2 mg/kg, n = 6) single-dose pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Plasma levels of thrombotest, prothrombin (factor II), and factor VII activities were assayed. Rioprostil, 7 days pretreatment, did not affect control parameters of blood coagulation activity. During the rioprostil period the effect of phenprocoumon on thrombotest and factor VII activities was significantly weaker (p less than 0.02, ANOVA) compared with the control experiment. The effect of acenocoumarol on thrombotest activity was significantly weaker at 24 and 31 hours. None of the pharmacokinetic parameters tested were affected by rioprostil medication. The findings suggest that prostaglandins, at least those of the E series, attenuate the anticoagulant action of the oral anticoagulant agents by a mechanism not related to any pharmacokinetic interaction.\r"

We have examined their pharmacodynamic interaction by M-mode echocardiography and electrocardiography in eight normal male volunteers (24 +/- 1.8 years of age). Flecainide decreased the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (-4.4 +/- 1.2%, p less than 0.008), but verapamil did not. Neither drug affected cardiac output or vascular resistance. Both drugs increased the PR interval (12 +/- 4 msec, p less than 0.01 for flecainide; 12 +/- 5, p less than 0.04 for verapamil). Flecainide, but not verapamil, increased the QTc interval (23 +/- 8 msec, p less than 0.02). Both drugs also increased the systolic time interval ratio (PEPc/LVETc) (0.074 +/- 0.012, p less than 0.0004 for flecainide; 0.029 +/- 0.008, p less than 0.007 for verapamil). The combination of flecainide and verapamil had additive effects on myocardial contractility and on atrioventricular conduction. Verapamil slightly decreased the plasma clearance of flecainide (7.78 +/- 0.60 ml/kg/min for flecainide alone, 7.34 +/- 0.48 ml/kg/min for flecainide and verapamil together, p less than 0.05). On the other hand, flecainide had no effect on the plasma clearance of verapamil, which suggests that there was little interaction between the two drugs on their pharmacokinetic parameters.\r"

The drug caused dose-dependent decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. A small initial hypertensive response was observed after injection of the two highest doses. Heart rate was decreased. The concentration of norepinephrine in plasma was decreased significantly (by up to 92%), and the decrease was dose-dependent. No significant drug-induced alterations were observed in plasma renin activity or in the concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide and arginine vasopressin in plasma. Other drug effects included dose-dependent impairment of vigilance and stimulation of growth hormone secretion. Plasma cortisol levels were unaffected. Dexmedetomidine is a potentially useful tool for studies of the physiology and pharmacology of alpha 2-adrenoceptors in human beings and may have therapeutic applications in clinical conditions in which sedative and sympatholytic effects are considered beneficial, such as premedication for anesthesia and surgery.\r"

It is not clear whether the increased urine enzyme excretion caused by long-term drug therapy represents injury to the kidney or whether it is merely an effect of the drug. Urinary N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase and renal tubular cell excretion rates were measured in 19 patients who were receiving chronic treatment with gold and with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for rheumatoid arthritis, in 10 patients who were receiving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and in 8 healthy control subjects. No subjects showed evidence of kidney disease. Both renal tubular cell and enzyme excretion rates were elevated in the gold-treated group. This showed that there was increased renal tubular cell turnover in this group, which suggests low level renal tubular injury and not merely an effect of the usual dose of gold.\r"

In this study, therapeutic concentrations of valproic acid (less than 1 mmol/L) and valpromide (less than 10 mumol/L) inhibited hydrolysis of carbamazepine epoxide and styrene oxide in human liver microsomes and in preparations of purified human liver microsomal epoxide hydrolase. Valpromide (KI = 5 mumol/L) was 100 times more potent than valproic acid (KI = 550 mumol/L) as an inhibitor of carbamazepine epoxide hydrolysis in microsomes. After administration of carbamazepine epoxide to volunteers, the transdihydrodiol formation clearance was decreased 20% by valproic acid (blood concentration approximately 113 mumol/L) and 67% by valpromide (blood concentration less than 10 mumol/L). For both valproic acid and valpromide, a striking similarity exists between in vitro and in vivo inhibitory potencies. Valproic acid and valpromide are the first drugs known to inhibit microsomal epoxide hydrolase, an important detoxification enzyme, at therapeutic concentrations.\r"

Distribution volume did not change significantly. Subjects differed sharply in their sensitivity to erythromycin. Because of the interaction between erythromycin and alfentanil, we recommend that patients who are receiving erythromycin should be given alfentanil in reduced amounts or should avoid the drug completely.\r"

We have explored the possible mode of action of enprostil, a synthetic dehydroprostaglandin E2, on amphibian gastroduodenal mucosal bicarbonate secretion in vitro and on human gastric bicarbonate secretion in vivo. Addition of enprostil (10(-6) M) to the luminal solution of isolated amphibian gastric mucosa produced a 28% increase in bicarbonate secretion without a change in transmucosal potential difference. The same concentration of enprostil added to the luminal solution of isolated amphibian duodenal mucosa produced a 37% increase in bicarbonate secretion and was associated with a rise in transmucosal potential difference. The gastric output of bicarbonate from the human stomach has been calculated using a perfusion technique before, during, and after perfusion with enprostil (35 micrograms) in six healthy volunteers. A significant 78% increase in bicarbonate secretion occurred during the period of enprostil perfusion, falling to normal during the postenprostil period. These changes were caused mainly by an increase in gastric secretory volume with insignificant increases in bicarbonate concentration. These results suggest that stimulation of gastroduodenal bicarbonate secretion by enprostil may play a role in its protective actions.\r"

Mean pretreatment potassium phosphate mineral contents of T-12 to L-4 were 174 to 201 mg/ml in stage I to IV endometriosis and were within the 100 to 115th percentile of normal women. Similarly, cortical bone mineral contents were normal and were not significantly affected by either medication. Trabecular bone decreased significantly to 92.6 +/- 1.7% (n = 11, P less than 0.001) and 92.3 +/- 2.5% (n = 7, P less than 0.01) of baseline year after 6 months and 9 months of GnRH-a treatment and remained significantly depressed at 95.8 +/- 1.9% (P less than 0.0025) and 94.8 +/- 2.5% (P less than 0.005) 6 months after stopping treatment.

Serum estradiol was suppressed in the menopausal range in both groups, but the inhibition of the pituitary ovarian axis appeared more profound and consistent in the SC group than in the IN group. Laparoscopic findings proved that the SC Buserelin emerged superior to the IN Buserelin. Indeed, the score of endometriotic lesions and the ovarian cyst diameter were more reduced in the SC group than in the IN group. Moreover, the histologic study showed a lower incidence of active endometriosis and a lower mitotic index of ovarian endometrial epithelium in the SC group than in the IN group. In conclusion, the release of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist by a biodegradable implant achieved better efficacy in reducing endometriotic lesions than the IN mode of administration.\r"

This project modified a previously established and well-defined role for a family nurse in order to provide such a patient care-based learning experience for a family practice residency. Evaluation of the 18 month project showed that an average of 72 patient visits per month with charges of $482 were provided by this nurse at the same time that she was undertaking many improvements in the residency clinic's patient education system. Before and after surveys of the clinic staff and residents showed a rise in their perception of the quality of patient education (11% and 25% respectively thought it good or outstanding before, while 90% and 100% did so at the end of the project). There was also an increase in the residents' perceptions of having good personal patient education knowledge (from 50% to 88%) and skills (from 70% to 82%). The residents agreed that the family nurse role had been very valuable (76%) and that they would be interested (35%) or very interested (53%) in having such a person in their future practice, since it appeared to them to be cost-effective (69%). This model appears to be a feasible and acceptable way to deliver and teach patient education.\r"

Almost 30 years ago the difficulty of classifying primary care problems using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-8) was demonstrated. This led to the development of the International Classification of Health Problems in Primary Care-2-Defined which is based on ICD-9. Despite the work that has gone into the development of ICHPPC-2-Defined, relatively little work has been undertaken to assess the validity and reliability of its use. This paper describes the results of such a study conducted as a preliminary to the use of ICHPPC-2-Defined in a study of consulting patterns in general practice. The participating general practitioners were trained in the use of ICHPPC-2-Defined and then coded problems which they identified in a set of clinical vignettes. Following the coding exercise, a review session was held in which difficulties and errors in the use of ICHPPC-2-Defined were discussed. Subsequently, the general practitioners were required to code two more sets of vignettes, which included some problems repeated from the preceding sets. Comparisons were then made of changes in the validity and reliability of coding from one round to the next. The results of the study suggest that the reliability and validity of morbidity data collected using ICHPPC-2-Defined can be increased by training sessions for the coders which focus on the main sources of error in the use of ICHPPC-2-Defined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Indomethacin decreased pepsin-induced H+ flux by 55% without affecting the other indices. BW755C, by all measurements, dramatically increased pepsin-induced injury.

  ".W": "The role of lipoxygenase metabolites in ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury and submucosal microvascular change in the rat was studied by in vivo microscopy. Intragastric ethanol-instillation caused marked submucosal venular constriction, dilatation of small arterioles, and corpus mucosal gross lesion formation. The venoconstriction was greater in the lesion than in the nonlesion area. Intragastric pretreatment with either BW755C, a lipoxygenase inhibitor, or Rioprostil, a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analogue, significantly inhibited both the ethanol-induced venoconstriction and the gross lesion formation. In contrast, pretreatment by the submucosal application of either BW755C (50 micrograms/ml) or Rioprostil (50-500 ng/ml) had no effect on either the submucosal venoconstriction or the mucosal lesion formation. In conclusion, leukotrienes released from the gastric mucosa appear to be involved in the ethanol-induced submucosal venoconstriction associated with gastric mucosal injury. Prostaglandin pretreatment protects against this venoconstriction and gross lesion by a mucosal effect but not by a direct effect on submucosal venules.\r"

The proximal and distal colon were analyzed independently at all ages. All three enzymes were detected in the fetal colon when the cells were highly undifferentiated. Postnatally, significant regional differences in cellular ultrastructure appeared, only some of which were directly paralleled by enzymatic changes. Each enzyme had a distinct region-specific developmental pattern. Lactase and sodium-potassium-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase were significantly enhanced at birth, decreasing to adult levels by 15 days postnatal. Regional differences were present, but the patterns were similar. These patterns did not parallel the increase in microvillar height and number and basolateral interdigitations of the surface columnar cells, the structural correlates of lactase, and sodium-potassium-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase, respectively. In contrast, developmental changes in alkaline phosphatase activity paralleled structural maturation, at least in part. The activity levels in the distal colon did not change significantly with age and few major structural changes were noted. In the proximal colon, activity increased markedly after birth, and after 10 days decreased rapidly to adult levels, a pattern that coincided with the transient appearance of villi and specialized cells with apical tubules and vesicles known to have alkaline phosphatase activity. The results show age- and region-related changes in cellular ultrastructure and enzymatic activities, only some of which appear to be directly correlated.\r"

Corpus mucosal blood flow was measured by the hydrogen gas clearance technique and acid output by a continuous gastric perfusion method in fasted, urethane-anesthetized rats. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (1 or 5 micrograms) injected into the cerebral lateral ventricle induced concomitant increases in gastric acid secretion and mucosal blood flow. Intravenous infusion of step doses of TRH (60 and 180 micrograms/kg.h) had no effect on these parameters. Bilateral vagotomy and atropine (0.15 mg/kg) completely blocked the effects of intracerebroventricular injection of TRH (5 micrograms) on gastric acid secretion and mucosal blood flow. In contrast, intravenous omeprazole (20 mumol/kg) completely inhibited the increase in gastric acid secretion but not the increase in mucosal blood flow elicited by intracerebroventricular administration of TRH (5 micrograms). These results demonstrate that TRH acts in the brain to stimulate gastric acid secretion and mucosal blood flow through vagal dependent pathways and peripheral muscarinic receptors. Part of the effect of central TRH on gastric mucosal blood flow is not secondary to the stimulation of acid secretion and appears to represent a direct cholinergic vasodilatory response.\r"

Intracerebroventricular infusion of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (0.01-1 microgram/h), bombesin, gastrin-releasing peptide, or corticotropin-releasing factor increased the bicarbonate secretion and the transmucosal electrical potential difference. The increase in secretion in response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone and bombesin was prevented by cervical vagotomy. Intravenous administration of the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine increased the magnitude and duration of the response, suggesting that these two peptides in addition to eliciting vagal stimulation of the duodenal secretion, by sympathetic activation, inhibit the secretion. Intravenous thyrotropin-releasing hormone (3.6 mg/kg) did not affect the secretion, further indicating that effects were elicited within the central nervous system. Intracerebroventricular infusion of cholecystokinin-octapeptide or beta-endorphin had no effect on duodenal bicarbonate secretion or on the potential difference. The latter peptide was a potent stimulant of the secretion when injected intravenously and probably acts at a peripheral site. The central nervous control of duodenal mucosal bicarbonate secretion is thus influenced by some specific peptides that are known to occur in brain tissue, and duodenal protection against acid might be modulated by agents affecting this control.\r"

  ".W": "We compared the natriuretic response to a standard dose of atrial natriuretic factor in nine patients with early cirrhosis (no ascites or edema) with the response in normal subjects displaying a range of baseline sodium excretions due to different sodium intakes (20 mmoles per day, n = 9; 100 mmoles per day, n = 9, and 200 mmoles per day, n = 9). In these normal subjects, sodium output rose, in the same order, from 49 +/- 12 to 177 +/- 26, from 116 +/- 21 to 365 +/- 106 and from 228 +/- 29 to 901 +/- 85 mumoles per min in the first 20 min after 100 micrograms atrial natriuretic factor (human atrial natriuretic factor 99-126). Thus, irrespective of basal excretion, natriuresis rose by at least 2-fold. In the cirrhotic patients, natriuresis rose from 173 +/- 42 to 305 +/- 77 mumoles per min, that is by hardly 1-fold, significantly less than in the normal subjects (p less than 0.01). Renal function studies indicated that atrial natriuretic factor caused less rise in glomerular filtration rate and in fractional sodium excretion. Atrial natriuretic factor induced a fall in blood pressure only in the cirrhotic group, from 130 +/- 4/81 +/- 2 to 108 +/- 4/68 +/- 3 mmHg (p less than 0.001). Plasma atrial natriuretic factor was not low in the cirrhotic patients. Although these data are compatible with a primary disturbance of sodium excretion in early cirrhosis without ascites, such an explanation is complicated by the concomitant drop in blood pressure after atrial natriuretic factor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In order to study changes of the tissue-specific availability of enzymes of eicosanoid synthesis, we used portacaval-shunted rats, as this model exhibits many clinical and biochemical similarities to patients suffering from cirrhosis of the liver. Microsomal mass and maximal velocity of prostaglandin H synthase, the initial enzyme of prostaglandin synthesis, were markedly and permanently increased after shunting in both hepatic and extrahepatic tissues as compared to those of sham-operated rats. Maximal velocity of thromboxane synthase and prostacyclin synthase, two more peripheral enzymes of the arachidonic acid cascade, were tissue-specifically enhanced, whereas the apparent affinities (Km) remained unchanged. Determination of 5-lipoxygenase activity in tissue preparations disclosed a preferential increase in the liver, lung and renal cortex after portacaval shunting. Furthermore, exposure to endotoxin closely mimicked the shunting-induced changes. These results suggest that after portacaval shunting and possibly in patients with advanced liver disease, profound abnormalities at the level of local enzyme expression might play a pathophysiologically important role in the control of eicosanoid synthesis.\r"

A genetic deficiency in bilirubin UDP-glucuronyl transferase may predispose humans and animals to the toxicity of drugs that are extensively glucuronidated, if other glucuronyl transferase isoenzymes are concurrently deficient. Homozygous and heterozygous Gunn rats are, respectively, severely and moderately deficient in glucuronyl transferase. Acetaminophen (500 mg per kg) was administered intraperitoneally to homozygous and heterozygous Gunn rats and to Wistar controls. Hepatic and renal cellular damage was assessed by peak plasma concentrations of ALT and blood urea nitrogen, respectively. Homozygous and heterozygous Gunn rats showed, respectively, 115-fold and 9-fold higher ALT concentrations compared to Wistar controls. Blood urea nitrogen was elevated only in the homozygous Gunn rats (3-fold). Biotransformation of acetaminophen was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Acetaminophen glucuronidation was decreased by 72 and 35% (p less than 0.05), respectively, in the homozygous and heterozygous Gunn rats compared with Wistar controls. Production of acetaminophen glucuronide correlated negatively with ALT concentration (r = -0.89, p less than 0.001). Production of glutathione-derived metabolites, reflecting acetaminophen bioactivation, was 2 to 3-fold higher in the Gunn rats (p less than 0.05) and correlated with ALT concentrations (r = 0.90, p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Hormone concentrations were also determined in the same patients on a separate occasion after 1 h of ultrafiltration (UF). Plasma concentrations of ANP were significantly higher in the patients with ESRD than in a normal reference population and declined after both 1 h and 3 h of hemodialysis. Plasma concentrations of ANP failed to exhibit a significant decline after 1 h of UF. Plasma AVP concentrations were not significantly different after either hemodialysis or UF, while plasma aldosterone concentrations fell with hemodialysis. The decline in plasma aldosterone concentrations paralleled the decrease in dialysis-induced fall in serum potassium concentrations. There was no correlation between the blood pressures, heart rate, interdialytic weight gain and estimated fluid overload and any of the hormones measured except for the plasma renin activity (PRA) which correlated significantly with the systolic blood pressure. The data suggest that ANP may not be a major factor in blood pressure regulation in normotensive patients with ESRD and its elevation in patients with ESRD is most likely due to fluid overload and atrial distention as well as a possible reduction in its metabolic clearance in renal insufficiency. The fall in plasma ANP following hemodialysis is not due to its removal by dialysis but is most likely due to a reduction in ANP production caused by dialysis-induced correction of hypervolemia.\r"

Breathing was measured with a pneumotachograph and end-tidal PCO2 by mass spectrometer. Inspired air was humidified and enriched to 35% O2. Peak flow, volume, and times for the inspiratory and expiratory half cycles, time for expiratory flow, minute ventilation, and mean inspiratory flow were computer averaged over at least 40 breaths at rest and during the last 2 min of 5-min periods at each work rate. During the transition from rest to exercise and with increasing work rate in both groups, there was an increase in respiratory rate and depth with selective and progressive shortening of expiratory time; these responses were not significantly different between the two groups, but there was a suggestion that respiratory \"drive\" as quantitated by mean inspiratory flow may limit in the laryngectomized subjects at high work rates. Time for expiratory flow increased on transition from rest to exercise and then decreased in both groups as the work rate increased; it was shorter in the laryngectomy than control group at all levels. In the laryngectomized subjects there was significantly more breath-by-breath scatter in some variables at rest, but there was no difference during exercise. It is concluded that chronic removal of the larynx and upper airways in mildly hyperoxic conscious humans has only subtle and, therefore, functionally insignificant effects on breathing during moderate exercise. Evidence is provided that the upper airways can modulate expiratory flow but not expiratory time during exercise.\r"

  ".W": "The factors associated with the exercise-induced increase in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) have not been clearly established. Thus the purpose of the study was to further document the stimulus for the exercise-induced release of ANP and to examine the role of ANP in the control of hydromineral balance during exercise. Eight healthy male volunteers (25.1 +/- 4.5 yr) were submitted to a graded cycling exercise in both the upright and supine positions. Venous blood was sampled at rest and at the end of each 5-min work load at 40, 60, and 80% maximal oxygen uptake (Vo2max), at maximal exercise, and during recovery through an indwelling catheter for the determination of plasma vasopressin, aldosterone, catecholamines, plasma renin activity, and ANP concentrations. Results indicate a significant increase in ANP (pg/ml) from rest to maximal exercise in the upright position [rest, 21.9 +/- 10.2; 40%, 24.7 +/- 12.6; 60%, 32.4 +/- 17*; 80%, 47.8 +/- 27.7*; 100% Vo2max, 65.9 +/- 34.5* (*P less than or equal to 0.05)]. Supine concentrations were significantly higher than upright at 40 (37.9 +/- 15.2), 60 (54.0 +/- 18.8), and 80% Vo2max (68.9 +/- 16.6). Plasma ANP during maximal exercise was similar in both positions. Plasma vasopressin, aldosterone, renin activity, and catecholamines increased with increasing exercise intensity in both positions, although lower values were systematically observed in the supine position. The association of higher plasma ANP and blunted plasma vasopressin, plasma renin activity, and norepinephrine concentrations during supine exercise suggests that ANP may exert modulatory effects on the control of the hydromineral hormonal system during exercise.\r"

A two-channel roller pump and a four-way valve allow switching the gas exchanger into and out of the extracorporeal circuit, which controlled the perfusion to the brain stem. Seven alpha-chloralose-urethan-anesthetized cats were studied, and 25 steps of increasing and 23 steps of decreasing PCO2 were analyzed. A model consisting of a single-exponential function with time delay best described the ventilatory response. The time delays 11.7 +/- 8.1 and 6.4 +/- 6.8 (SD) s (obtained from mean values per cat) for the step into and out of hypercapnia, respectively, were not significantly different (P = 0.10) and were of the order of the transit time of the tubing from valve to brain stem. The steady-state CO2 sensitivities obtained from the on- and off-responses were also not significantly different (P = 0.10). The time constants 87 +/- 25 and 150 +/- 51 s, respectively, were significantly different (P = 0.0002). We conclude that the central chemoreflex is adequately modeled by a single component with a different time constant for on- and off-responses.\r"

To determine whether an increase in BBF, isolated from changes in arterial PO2 and PCO2, can affect respiration, we obstructed the thoracic aorta with a balloon in 31 intact and 24 peripherally chemobarodenervated, anesthetized, spontaneously breathing newborn piglets. Continuous measurements of cardiorespiratory variables were made before and during 2 min of aortic obstruction. Radiolabeled microspheres were used to measure BBF before and approximately 30 s after balloon inflation in eight intact and five denervated animals. After balloon inflation, there was a rapid increase in mean blood pressure in both the intact and denervated animals, followed within 10 s by a decrease in tidal volume and VE. In the intact animals, the decrease in VE after acute hypertension can be ascribed to a baroreceptor-mediated reflex. After peripheral chemobarodenervation, however, acute hypertension continued to produce a decrease in VE, which cannot be explained by baroreceptor stimulation. In these denervated animals, aortic balloon inflation was associated with an increase in BBF (13.1 +/- 2.7%; P less than 0.05). We speculate that the increase in BBF during hypoxia may contribute to the decrease in ventilation observed after carotid body denervation.\r"

Body temperature was maintained at 37 +/- 0.5 degrees C. Fully relaxed spectra were obtained for controls and 30-50 min after CO2 loading and CO2 withdrawal. Spectra were taken serially every 2.5 min after gas mixtures were changed. Brain pHi decreased 0.10 +/- 0.02 units [7.06 +/- 0.01 (SE)] to 6.96 +/- 0.01 (P less than 0.001) after 30-50 min of 10% CO2 breathing, and arterial pH decreased 0.24 +/- 0.01 units.

Brain pHi returned to control values after 30-50 min of CO2 washout in both groups. In three of six animals breathing 10% CO2, there was an undershoot in brain pHi by 0.07-0.09 units between 2.5 and 20 min of hypercapnia. Three animals exhibited an overshoot in pHi by 0.06-0.11 units between 7.5 and 17.5 min during CO2 washout.

The findings of a smaller brain pHi change than arterial pH change and undershoots and overshoots in pHi support the view that pHi regulation involves active processes such as transmembrane ion transport.\r"

Dis. 136: 886-891, 1987) improved cardiac output in dogs with pulmonary edema ventilated with external continuous negative chest pressure ventilation (CNPV) using negative end-expiratory pressure (NEEP), compared with continuous positive-pressure ventilation (CPPV) using equivalent positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). The present study examined the effect on lung water of CNPV compared with CPPV to determine whether the increased venous return created by NEEP worsened pulmonary edema in dogs with acute lung injury. Oleic acid (0.06 ml/kg) was administered to 27 anesthetized dogs. Supine animals were then divided into three groups and ventilated for 6 h. The first group (n = 10) was treated with intermittent positive-pressure ventilation (IPPV) alone; the second (n = 9) received CNPV with 10 cmH2O NEEP; the third (n = 8) received CPPV with 10 cmH2O PEEP. CNPV and CPPV produced similar improvements in oxygenation over IPPV. However, cardiac output was significantly depressed by CPPV, but not by CNPV, when compared with IPPV. Although there were no differences in extravascular lung water (Qwl/dQl) between CNPV and CPPV, both significantly increased Qwl/dQl compared with IPPV (7.81 +/- 0.21 and 7.87 +/- 0.31 vs. 6.71 +/- 0.25, respectively, P less than 0.01 in both instances). CNPV and CPPV, but not IPPV, enhanced lung water accumulation in the perihilar areas where interstitial pressures may be most negative at higher lung volumes.\r"

Decreases in arterial PCO2 (PaCO2) and increases in arterial pH and adrenocortical system activity occurred consistently throughout the exposure period in rats exposed to 9 or 12% O2. In contrast, changes in PaCO2 or pH were only transient or delayed, plasma ACTH did not change, and plasma corticosterone only increased after 20 min in rats exposed to 15 or 18% O2 relative to those breathing 21% O2. Omitting the large blood sample at 20 min for ACTH eliminated the increase in corticosterone in the 15% O2 group. Overall, ACTH increased, and PaCO2 decreased, below PaO2 of approximately 60 Torr. We conclude that ACTH secretion increases at a similar PaO2 as hyperventilation-induced decreases in PaCO2 and thus represents a primary physiological response to acute hypoxia; hemodynamic stimuli may also interact with hypoxia to augment adrenocortical system activity.\r"

Anesthetized dogs had the left upper lobe removed and a double-lumen tube placed so that right lung and left lower lobe (LLL) could be ventilated independently. Air was infused into the femoral vein for 1 h during bilateral ventilation at an inspiratory O2 fraction (FIO2) of 1.0. After cessation of air infusion the LLL was then ventilated with a hypoxic gas mixture (FIO2 = 0.05) in six animals and an FIO2 of 1.0 in six other animals. Lung hydroxyproline content was measured as an index of lung dry weight. LLL bloodless lobar wet weight-to-hydroxyproline ratio was 0.33 +/- 0.06 mg/micrograms in the animals exposed to LLL hypoxia and 0.37 +/- 0.03 mg/micrograms (NS) in the animals that had a LLL FIO2 of 1. Both values were significantly higher than our laboratory normal values of 0.19 +/- 0.01 mg/micrograms. We subsequently found in four more dogs exposed to global alveolar hypoxia before and after air embolism that the air injury itself significantly depressed the hypoxic vasoconstrictor response. We conclude that regional alveolar hypoxia has no effect on pulmonary edema formation due to air embolism. The most likely reason for these findings is that the air embolism injury itself interfered with hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.\r"

The tracers were 99mTc-diethylenetriaminepentaacetate (99mTc-DTPA, mol wt 492), 99mTc-human serum albumin (99mTc-ALB, mol wt 69,000), and 99mTc-aggregated albumin (99mTc-AGG ALB, mol wt 383,000). 99mTc-DTPA clearance measurements were not able to discriminate lung injury from lung inflation. The 99mTc-AGG ALB clearance rate was unchanged by lung inflation and increased slightly with lung injury. The 99mTc-ALB clearance rate (0.06 +/- 0.02%/min) was unchanged by lung inflation (0.09 +/- 0.02%/min, P greater than 0.05) or 4 h of hypertension without injury (0.09 +/- 0.04%/min, P greater than 0.05). Deposition of 99mTc-ALB within 15 min of the administration of the oleic acid increased the clearance rate to 0.19 +/- 0.06%/min, which correlated well with the postmortem lung water volume (r = 0.92, P less than 0.01). This did not occur when there was a 60-min delay in the deposition of 99mTc-ALB. We conclude that 99mTc-ALB is the best indicator for studying the effects of lung epithelial injury on protein and fluid transport into and out of the air spaces of the lungs in a minimally invasive manner.\r"

  ".W": "Eight healthy young men underwent two separate steady-state incremental exercise runs within the aerobic range on a treadmill with alternating periods of breathing with no load (NL) and with an inspiratory resistive load (IRL) of approximately 12 cmH2O.1-1.s. End-tidal PCO2 was maintained constant throughout each run at the eucapnic or a constant hypercapnic level by adding 0-5% CO2 to the inspired O2. Hypercapnia caused a steepening, as well as upward shift, relative to the corresponding eucapnic ventilation-CO2 output (VE - VCO2) relationship in NL and IRL. Compared with NL, the VE - VCO2 slope was depressed by IRL, more so in hypercapnic [-19.0 +/- 3.4 (SE) %] than in eucapnic exercise (-6.0 +/- 2.0%), despite a similar increase in the slope of the occlusion pressure at 100 ms - VCO2 (P100 - VCO2) relationship under both conditions. The steady-state hypercapnic ventilatory response at rest was markedly depressed by IRL (-22.6 +/- 7.5%), with little increase in P100 response. For a given inspiratory load, breathing pattern responses to separate or combined hypercapnia and exercise were similar. During IRL, VE was achieved by a greater tidal volume (VT) and inspiratory duty cycle (TI/TT) along with a lower mean inspiratory flow (VT/TI). The increase in TI/TT was solely because of a prolongation of inspiratory time (TI) with little change in expiratory duration for any given VT. The ventilatory and breathing pattern responses to IRL during CO2 inhalation and exercise are in favor of conservation of respiratory work.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The steady-state hypercapnic ventilatory response at rest was also markedly depressed (-32.1 +/- 11.2%). Occlusion pressure response was augmented in response to IEL during eucapnic exercise (88.7 +/- 13.3%) but not during CO2 inhalation at rest or during exercise. Breathing pattern characteristics were similar regardless of the type of stimulus input and the level of inspiratory load. Results are consistent with the notion that the control of VE and breathing pattern may both be influenced by a balance between the prevailing chemical drive and a propensity of the controller to reduce respiratory effort.\r"

Within 40 min after endotoxin injection (20 mg/kg), lung tissue thromboxane B2 doubled, although 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha) increased by 8- to 10-fold. Lung 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and leukotriene C4 were variably increased by endotoxin. The levels of all eicosanoids returned to base line 6 h after endotoxin challenge. Lung vascular injury, as assessed by the extravascular accumulation of 125I-albumin and water in isolated perfused lungs, was observed 90 min after endotoxin injection (0.02-20 mg/kg) in vivo. Inhibition of the cyclooxygenase pathway with indomethacin and the lipoxygenase pathway with diethylcarbamazine and 2-(12-hydroxydodeca-5,10-dinyl)-3,5,6-trimethyl-1,4-benzoqui none failed to attenuate endotoxin-induced lung injury. In addition, essential fatty acid deficiency, which markedly reduced lung tissue levels of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, thromboxane B2, and leukotriene C4, did not protect against endotoxin injury. We conclude that although lung eicosanoids are activated during endotoxemia, they do not play a crucial role in the development of acute lung vascular injury in rats.\r"

In seven anesthetized dogs, the left lower lobe was isolated, leaving the bronchus and bronchial vasculature intact. Blood was taken from the femoral arteries and reinfused at a controlled rate into the pulmonary artery of the left lower lobe. The flow rate was varied between 100 and 400 ml/min. The multiple inert gas elimination technique was used to quantitate the matching of ventilation to perfusion. Reduction in lobe blood flow resulted in a significant increase in perfusion-related indexes of alveolar ventilation-perfusion heterogeneity, such as the log standard deviation of the perfusion distribution, the retention component of the arterial-alveolar difference area, and the retention dispersion index. The increased heterogeneity suggests a worsening of the intraregional matching between the ventilation and the perfusion when perfusion is less than normal.\r"

Similar testing was performed at identical time periods on the day before the marathon as control data. On each occasion, HCVR was measured twice 15 min apart, and the mean value was used for analysis. Six active (training distance 50-104 km/wk) and experienced (no. of marathons completed, 1-25) runners participated in the study. There were no significant changes in beta-endorphin activity or HCVR on the control day. All runners experienced a rise in beta-endorphin activity from premarathon (21.3 +/- 16.0 pg/ml) to immediate postmarathon (89.6 +/- 84.9 pg/ml) values (P less than 0.05). However, HCVR showed no significant change at any of the three testing periods on the marathon day. To investigate whether a time delay may have affected the lack of response to naloxone, additional testing was performed in five subjects, except that 10 mg iv naloxone was given within 10 min after completion of the marathon, and then HCVR was measured. Although there was a greater than fourfold increase in beta-endorphin immunoreactivity after the marathon, there was no significant change in HCVR after naloxone administration. We conclude that natural increases in endogenous beta-endorphin activity associated with marathon running do not modulate central chemosensitivity.\r"

This study on anesthetized dogs varied the oscillator frequency (f) and determined the stroke volume (SV) at which apnea occurred. Relaxation functional residual capacity (FRC) and the eupneic breathing end-tidal CO2 level were held constant. Airway pressure and CO2 were measured from a side port of the tracheostomy cannula. An arterial cannula was inserted for blood gas analysis. Diaphragm electromyogram (EMG) was recorded with bipolar electrodes. Apnea was defined as the absence of phasic diaphragm EMG activity for a minimum of 60 s. During HFOV, SV was increased at each f (5-40 Hz) until apnea occurred. The apnea inducing SV decreased as f increased. SV was minimal at 25-30 Hz. Frequencies greater than 30 Hz required increased SV to produce apnea. The f-SV curve was defined as the apneic threshold. Increased FRC resulted in a downward shift (less SV at the same f) in the apneic threshold. Elevated CO2 caused an upward shift (more SV at the same f) in the apneic threshold. These results demonstrate that the apnea elicited by HFOV is dependent on the interaction of oscillator f and SV, the FRC, and CO2.\r"

  ".W": "In an attempt to investigate their relationships with plasma volume (PV), heart rate (HR), and other hormonal systems, plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels were determined in response to exercise in the heat, associated with dehydration and rehydration with various fluids. Five normal subjects underwent four 3-h experiments, in a 36 degree C environment, in which 25-min exercise periods on a cycle ergometer at 90 W alternate with 5-min rest periods. Blood samples were collected hourly and ANP, arginine vasopressin (AVP), adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), and cortisol were analyzed in four experimental sessions: without fluid supplement (DH) and with progressive rehydration either with water (W), acid isotonic solution (AISO), or neutral isotonic solution (NISO). Exercise in the heat, accompanied by a decrease in PV and an increase in osmolality, elicited an increase of 28 +/- 1.6 pg/ml in plasma ANP, with concomitant increases in AVP (5.1 +/- 1.4 pg/ml), ACTH (49.6 +/- 12.3 pg/ml), and cortisol (8.4 +/- 2.0 micrograms/100 ml). Progressive rehydration maintained PV and blunted ANP, AVP, ACTH, and cortisol responses. These results demonstrate the importance of rehydration, during exercise in a warm environment, in preventing hormonal increases. They suggest that under our conditions, the PV changes and the inferred atrial pressure changes may not be the primary factors controlling ANP release, as under other physiological conditions. The exercise-related activation of pituitary and adrenals and the stimulation of HR counteract the influence of PV changes due to vascular fluid shifts.\r"

We used a wedged bronchoscope technique to study the ability of MgSO4 at clinically relevant concentrations to attenuate hypocapnia-, acetylcholine- (ACh), and dry air-induced bronchoconstriction in the canine lung periphery. Control experiments demonstrated that consecutive challenges of either hypocapnia or ACh resulted in greater collateral system resistance (Rcs) after the second challenge compared with the first. Intravenous infusion of MgSO4 diminished the maximum response to a second hypocapnic challenge (Rcs = 1.59 +/- 0.29 cmH2O.ml-1.s prechallenge vs. 1.12 +/- 0.20 postchallenge) but had no effect on either ACh- or dry air-induced bronchoconstriction. Serum magnesium levels before MgSO4 administration were 1.59 +/- 0.04 meq/l and rose to 6.20 +/- 0.13 during the infusion. Previous studies demonstrated that nifedipine, like MgSO4 in this study, attenuates hypocapnia-induced bronchoconstriction in the canine lung periphery but has no effect on ACh- or dry air-induced bronchoconstriction. We conclude that these results are consistent with the idea that, like nifedipine, magnesium acts in the airway as a voltage-sensitive calcium channel blocker.\r"

  ".W": "Ventilation is influenced by the acid-base status of the brain extracellular fluids (ECF). CO2 may affect ventilation independent of changes in H+. Whether the acidic condition directly alters neuronal firing or indirectly alters neuronal firing through changes in endogenous neurotransmitters remains unclear. In this work, ventriculocisternal perfusion (VCP) was used in anesthetized (pentobarbital sodium, 30 mg/kg) spontaneously breathing dogs to study the ventilatory effects of acetylcholine (ACh), eucapnic acidic (pH approximately 7.0) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and hypercapnic acidic (pH approximately 7.1) CSF in the absence and presence of atropine (ATR). Each animal served as its own control. Base line was defined during VCP with control mock CSF (pH approximately 7.4). With ATR (4.8 mM) there was an insignificant downward trend in minute ventilation (VE). ACh (6.6 mM) increased VE 53% (n = 12, P less than 0.01), eucapnic acidic CSF increased VE 41% (n = 12, P less than 0.01), and hypercapnic acidic CSF increased VE 47% (n = 6, P less than 0.01). These positive effects on ventilation were not seen in the presence of ATR. This suggests that acidic brain ECF activates ventilatory neurons through muscarinic cholinergic mechanisms. Higher concentrations of ACh increased ventilation in a concentration-dependent manner. Higher concentrations of ATR decreased ventilation progressively, resulting in apnea. The results suggest that ACh plays a significant role in the central augmentation of ventilation when the brain ECF is made acidic by either increasing CSF PCO2 or decreasing CSF bicarbonate.\r"

VV[30] was 3.24 +/- 0.98 ml/100 ml arm in the supine position and 2.46 +/- 1.32 ml/100 ml arm in the sitting position. TNG increased VV[30] by 0.56 +/- 0.19 ml/100 ml arm in supine subjects, but by only 0.38 +/- 0.17 ml/100 ml arm in sitting subjects (P = 0.013). When limb volume was measured in the forearm and calf without using a cuff to produce venous congestion, the increase in limb volume with TNG was significantly greater in the sitting than in the supine position. Because the fall in both systolic and diastolic pressure and the rise in heart rate were significantly greater after TNG was administered in the sitting position, it is suggested that a greater reflex venoconstriction occurred in this posture, which antagonized the TNG-induced increase in venous distensibility. In the seated position, the effect of gravity more than compensated for the impaired venodilatory response to TNG. These results suggest that TNG causes a greater reduction in venous return to the heart when administered in the sitting position than in the supine position.\r"

The airway irritation at the resting level of spontaneous breathing caused a variety of respiratory responses such as coughing, expiration reflex, apnea, and spasmodic panting, with considerable increases in blood pressure and heart rate. Although the latency of respiratory responses after water injection was much shorter than those of blood pressure and heart rate responses, blood pressure and heart rate responses, once elicited, were prolonged much longer than was the respiratory response. An increase in CO2 ventilatory drive decreased the degree and duration of respiratory, blood pressure, and heart rate responses to the airway irritation, whereas a decrease in CO2 ventilatory drive had the opposite effect on these responses. Our results indicate that changes in CO2 ventilatory drive can modify reflex responses of respiration, blood pressure, and heart rate to airway irritation.\r"

  ".W": "Static contraction of hind-limb muscles is well known to increase reflexly cardiovascular function. Recently, blockade of cyclooxygenase activity has been reported to attenuate the reflex pressor response to contraction, a finding which suggests that working skeletal muscle releases arachidonic acid metabolites. Therefore, we measured the effects of static contraction and ischemia on arachidonic acid levels in the gastrocnemius muscles of barbiturate-anesthetized cats treated with indomethacin. Unesterified arachidonic acid levels were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography. We found that static contraction of freely perfused gastrocnemius muscles increased arachidonic acid levels from 4.4 +/- 1.0 to 10.3 +/- 2.2 nmol/g wet wt (n = 12; P less than 0.005). Likewise, static contraction of gastrocnemius muscles made ischemic for 2 min before the onset of the contraction period increased arachidonic acid levels from 12.6 +/- 2.3 to 21.0 +/- 2.0 nmol/g wet wt (n = 12; P less than 0.01). Lastly, 2 min of ischemia with the gastrocnemius muscles at rest increased arachidonic acid levels from 5.9 +/- 1.1 to 10.5 +/- 3.0 nmol/g wet wt (n = 18; P less than 0.02). We conclude that both static contraction and ischemia increase arachidonic acid levels in working hindlimb muscle.\r"

  ".W": "This study has attempted to identify the cells and phosphoglyceride molecular species associated with the rapid turnover of arachidonic acid (AA) in the isolated rat lung. In initial studies, AA complexed to trace amounts of albumin was added to the perfusate of rat lungs for 15 min and the incorporation of [3H]AA into various cells and phosphoglyceride molecular species was determined. Autoradiographic analysis revealed that the AA had labeled endothelial cells but also had already escaped from the intravascular space and labeled epithelial cells including alveolar type II cells. In addition, [3H]AA was found to be incorporated into various phosphoglycerides: phosphatidylcholine (PC) greater than phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) greater than phosphatidylinositol (PI). The majority of this [3H]AA was incorporated into 1-acyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-PC, -PE, and -PI during the 15-min labeling period. In subsequent experiments, AA remodeling in the lung was examined by pulse labeling with [3H]AA for 15 min, washing unbound AA with albumin, and perfusing for an additional 120 min. In these lungs, some of the [3H]AA was remodeled into 1-alk-1-enyl-acyl-sn-glycero-3-PE. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the largest pools of endogenous AA in the lung are found in PE associated with 1-alk-1-enyl-linked molecular species. On ionophore stimulation of lungs labeled for 15 min, labeled leukotriene (LT) B4, leukotriene C4, and 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha) were produced. LTC4 had a profoundly different radiospecific activity compared with LTB4 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, suggesting a different source of AA as contributing to the production of this eicosanoid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The time course of glycogen changes in soleus muscle recovering from 3 days of nonweight bearing by hindlimb suspension was investigated. Within 15 min and up to 2 h, muscle glycogen decreased. Coincidentally, muscle glucose 6-phosphate and the fractional activity of glycogen phosphorylase, measured at the fresh muscle concentrations of AMP, increased. Increased fractional activity of glycogen synthase during this time was likely the result of greater glucose 6-phosphate and decreased glycogen. From 2 to 4 h, when the synthase activity remained elevated and the phosphorylase activity declined, glycogen levels increased (glycogen supercompensation). A further increase of glycogen up to 24 h did not correlate with the enzyme activities. Between 24 and 72 h, glycogen decreased to control values, possibly initiated by high phosphorylase activity at 24 h. At 12 and 24 h, the inverse relationship between glycogen concentration and the synthase activity ratio was lost, indicating that reloading transiently uncoupled glycogen control of this enzyme. These data suggest that the activities of glycogen synthase and phosphorylase, when measured at physiological effector levels, likely provide the closest approximation to the actual enzyme activities in vivo. Measurements made in this way effectively explained the majority of the changes in the soleus glycogen content during recovery from nonweight bearing.\r"

As in the dogs, we noted macrophages and giant cells and we demonstrated that the interface tissue synthesized several basement-membrane components (type-IV collagen, laminin, and fibronectin). In addition, we demonstrated the synthesis of an additional extracellular-matrix protein--type-VI collagen. We also showed that extracts of organ cultures of tissue from the rat model degraded type-I collagen into three-quarter and one-quarter-length fragments. Such enzymatic activity is characterized of mammalian collagenase, an enzyme that is known to play a critical role in the resorption of bone.\r"

  ".W": "The cases of nine children who survived the acute stage of meningococcal septicemia and secondary disseminated intravascular coagulation were reviewed. All of the children had major orthopaedic problems as a result of the acute disease. Detailed histological studies were performed on specimens of bone and cartilage, obtained when these patients had either acute amputation for gangrene or subsequent revision for a chondro-osseous deformity. In the specimens that were obtained from the children who had acute gangrene, the histological changes included small-vessel thrombi, osteonecrosis, subperiosteal new-bone formation, cortical disruption, cellular disorganization in the physis, and medullary inflammation. These findings were compatible with a combination of inflammation (acute osteomyelitis) and ischemia. In the specimens that were obtained during revision of the amputation, three years or more after the initial infectious or ischemic process, the clinically relevant findings involved the epiphyses and physes. The growth plates showed variable permanent ischemic damage. Bone bridges connecting the epiphysis and metaphysis were observed in various stages of formation, including several early bridges with involvement of only the physis and metaphysis. Endosteal and cortical bone, in contrast, showed complete recovery with no evidence of permanent ischemic damage. We concluded that children who survive meningococcal septicemia are at high risk for complex orthopaedic problems, both acute and chronic. The disseminated intravascular coagulation and focal infections of the acute phase are primarily responsible for the vascular injuries to the growing chondro-osseous tissues. Ischemic changes also selectively involve the physeal circulation, but may take several years to adversely affect longitudinal and transverse growth of bone.\r"

The mixture is agitated and plated. Afterwards 25 strains are inoculated by a Multinoculator (Cetin, Bs. As., Argentina). After incubation (18 hours at 37 degrees C), the results are obtained by observing the presence or absence of bacterial development. The minimal inhibitory concentration is calculated as the lowest concentration that inhibited growth. It is a simple, economical, and reproducible method.\r"

Digital pulse volume recording (PVR) was monitored for twelve hour periods. The shape of the PVR curve was used to calculate the diastolic amplitude response intensity, an indication of the vasoactive effect of the drug. There was no measurable response to the administration of placebo. The effect of nitroglycerin was maximal one hour after administration and disappeared after three hours. The long term effect of the two long-acting nitrite preparations was clearly demonstrated as compared to nitroglycerin. Noninvasive measurements of peripheral blood flow can serve as a convenient and accurate tool for pharmacokinetic studies of vasoactive drugs.\r"

We therefore have studied a group of human and bovine warts to define further the potential risk of wart therapy and to test whether a surgical mask could reduce exposure. Half of each wart was treated with carbon dioxide laser and the other half with electrocoagulation. The vapor produced by each form of therapy was collected with a dry filter vacuum apparatus and analyzed for the presence of papillomavirus. Vapor from human plantar warts was analyzed for the presence of human papillomavirus DNA, because there is no infectivity assay for human papillomavirus. Of plantar warts treated, five of eight laser-derived vapors and four of seven electrocoagulation-derived vapors were positive for human papillomavirus DNA. Greater amounts of papillomavirus DNA were usually recovered in the laser vapor than in the electrocoagulation vapor from the same wart. Bioassay readily detected infectious bovine papillomavirus in the vapor from bovine warts treated with either modality; more virus was present in laser-derived material. A surgical mask was found capable of removing virtually all laser- or electrocoagulation-derived virus, strongly suggesting that such masks can protect operators from potential inhalation exposure to papillomavirus.\r"

  ".W": "Recent work by epidemiologists and microbiologists has uncovered several hitherto unrecognized food-borne bacterial pathogens of public health significance. One of these, Listeria monocytogenes, has attracted considerable attention because of two major cheese-related outbreaks of listeriosis that were characterized by cases of meningitis, abortion, and perinatal septicemia. Thus far, L. monocytogenes has been responsible for well over 300 reported cases of food-borne listeriosis, including about 100 deaths, and has cost the dairy industry alone more than 66 million dollars as a result of product recalls. The ability of L. monocytogenes to grow at refrigeration temperatures, coupled with appearance of the pathogen in raw and processed meats, as well as poultry, vegetables, and seafood, makes this bacterium a serious threat to susceptible consumers and to the entire food industry. Yersinia enterocolitica, another psychrotrophic food-borne pathogen of recent concern, was linked to several outbreaks of yersiniosis associated with consumption of both raw and pasteurized milk, as well as contaminated water. Food-borne infections involving Y. enterocolitica typically result in enterocolitis, which may be mistaken for acute appendicitis. Unfortunately, inadvertent removal of healthy appendixes from victims of food-borne yersiniosis is all too common. Although known for many years, Campylobacter jejuni has only recently been recognized as a food-borne pathogen and a leading cause of gastroenteritis in the United States. Notable outbreaks of campylobacteriosis linked to consumption of raw milk, cake icing, eggs, poultry, and beef have underscored the need for thorough cooking and proper handling of raw products.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One mAb produced against the epimastigote membranes (C-5) was found to be specific against this stage by radioimmune binding assay, immunofluorescence, and radioimmunoprecipitation. mAb C-5 recognized a novel epimastigote protein at Mr (greater than 200,000) on immunoprecipitation with radiolabeled epimastigotes. Three amastigote stage-specific monoclonal antibodies were produced against membrane-enriched preparations of T. cruzi (Brazil strain) amastigotes grown in axenic culture (C-1 through C-3). By indirect immunofluorescence assay, monoclonal antibody C-2 bound only to T. cruzi amastigotes; no reaction with either tissue culture-derived trypomastigotes or epimastigotes was observed. mAb C-1 and C-2 each specifically immunoprecipitated a single protein molecule with Mr 83,000 from [35S]-methionine-labeled amastigotes. mAb C-2 was also used to affinity purify an 83-kDa Ag that was recognized by human Chagasic sera from patients of endemic countries of Latin America in an enzyme immunoassay. Amino acid composition and preliminary sequence data of the 83-kDa protein are presented.

In accordance with previous studies we have analyzed the organization of the TCR delta gene, which rearranges early in thymic ontogeny, in normal NK cells, and in granular lymphocytes proliferative disorders (GLPD), in an effort to further define their relationship to the T cell differentiation pathway and to identify a possible marker of clonality for CD3- GLPD. The alpha/delta locus was rearranged in five cases of CD3+ GLPD with a biallelic deletion of the C delta region, suggesting V-J alpha rearrangement, whereas CD3- GLPD and normal CD3- NK cells had the delta gene in germ-line configuration, but surprisingly expressed high levels of TCR delta-related mRNA. On the basis of this finding and of the presence of truncated TCR-beta and CD3-epsilon mRNA, we are led to speculate on a possible ontogenic relationship of NK cells to the T cell differentiation pathway at stages preceding TCR gene rearrangement.\r"

The preexisting, nonproductive VHDJH complex was replaced by the productive VHJH complex which was generated by the novel joining between the rearranged VH and a germ line JH gene. This VHDJH to JH joining is thought to be a site-specific recombinational event mediated by a putative recombination signal sequence, CACAGCC-12-base-GCAAGAAAG, embedded in the rearranged VH gene including the N region. This sequence might be a novel recombination signal sequence, which had not yet been reported, for so-called recombinase.\r"

Very minimal amounts of microseconds mRNA are produced until the cells are stimulated. We have found a strong correlation between the initiation of mu S mRNA production and an alteration in the site of termination of polymerases transcribing the mu-gene. Furthermore, since the abundance of mu S mRNA is dependent on the differentiation stage of the B lymphocyte, we examined subpopulations of cells at various stages of activation and found that along with increased initiation of polymerases at the mu-locus, termination is moved further upstream in more highly differentiated cells. Therefore regulation of mu S mRNA may require factor(s) that induce transcriptional termination and these may be related to the factor(s) that augment transcriptional initiation.\r"

  ".W": "Although considerable indirect evidence supports the hypothesis that CD4+8+ thymocytes are developmental intermediates in the generation of mature (CD4+8- or CD4-8+) T cells, the ability of these cells to proliferate in vitro has been highly controversial. We demonstrate here that a fraction of purified murine CD4+8+ thymocytes can be induced to proliferate in response to immobilized anti-TCR mAb. To exclude possible proliferation by trace mature T cell contaminants, we have exploited our recent finding that in Mlsa mice mature V beta 6-bearing thymic T cells are virtually absent (less than or equal to 0.5%) due to clonal deletion, whereas V beta 6 +CD4+8+ thymocytes are present in much higher numbers (approximately 3%). Proliferation of sorted CD4+8+ thymocytes from Mlsa mice was therefore induced at limiting dilution with immobilized anti-V beta 6 mAb to select against any contaminating mature T cells. Under optimal culture conditions, the frequency of CD4+8+ thymocytes proliferating specifically to anti-V beta 6 mAb (1/1000) was higher than those obtained for purified CD4-8+ (1/2000) or CD4+8- (1/5000) subsets, thus demonstrating directly that a proportion (in this case 3%) of CD4+8+ thymocytes are potentially clonable. During culture, V beta 6 +CD4+8+ thymocytes gave rise to a mixture of phenotypically \"immature\" (CD4-8-) and \"mature\" (CD4-8+) T cells. This system should be valuable for further analysis of the elusive CD4+8+ thymocyte subset.\r"

PDGF and IL-1 operated synergistically in vitro to stimulate synoviocyte proliferation in the presence of indomethacin. However, when these same cells were treated with PDGF and IL-1 in the absence of indomethacin, IL-1 inhibited PDGF-stimulated synoviocyte proliferation. Moreover, exogenous PGE2, a PG known to be produced in response to IL-1, dramatically inhibited synoviocyte proliferation induced by PDGF. PDGF also acted synergistically to markedly increase production of PGE2 stimulated by IL-1. This is in contrast to the antagonistic effect PDGF had on IL-1-stimulated collagenase transcription. IL-1 stimulated collagenase transcription, but PDGF did not. It in fact inhibited IL-1 stimulation of collagenase gene expression. These data differ somewhat from those reported for dermal fibroblasts. Our data further indicate that the effects of cytokines vary from one cell type to another, even amongst \"fibroblasts,\" and illustrate the complexity of cytokine regulation of rheumatoid synoviocyte function.\r"

Dose response curve of the inhibitory effect was studied in murine and human primary allogeneic responses, as well as the proliferative responses to both PHA and Con A mitogens. The presence of aphidicolin during the allosensitization phase in secondary MLR of mice splenocytes resulted in complete abolishment of the subsequent response directed against the priming alloantigens, whereas alloreactivity to unrelated alloantigen-bearing cells was inhibited to a much lesser degree. The allosensitized aphidicolin-treated cells lost the ability to respond to subsequent PHA stimulation, but were capable of exerting a high responsiveness to Con A. The presence of aphidicolin during the allosensitization phase in secondary MLR of human mononuclear cells resulted in markedly decreased alloreactivity directed against the priming cells, but spared the subsequent response to unrelated alloantigens and to both PHA and Con A mitogenic stimuli. It is suggested that aphidicolin may be used for selective inactivation of proliferating cells without interfering with immunologic functions of other quiescent subsets. Aphidicolin may thus be a useful agent for induction of specific unresponsiveness in experimental models of allogeneic transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "Plasminogen activators and their inhibitors are thought to play an important role in the regulation of a variety of pathologic processes including inflammation and wound healing. IL-1 is one inflammatory mediator which has been shown to increase release of plasminogen activator (PA) Ag and activity by mesenchymal cells such as chondrocytes and synoviocytes. We have found that rIL-1 beta induces a rapid and significant accumulation of both tissue-and urinary-type plasminogen activator (t-PA and u-PA) mRNA and type 1 and 2 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1 and PAI-2) mRNA in MRC-5 fetal lung fibroblasts. An SV40 transformed fibroblast cell line, XP12RO, showed an identical response of PAI-1 and t-PA message levels but revealed no change in PAI-2 or u-PA mRNA levels with rIL-1 beta stimulation. Treatment with the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D blocked accumulation of t-PA, u-PA, PAI-1, and PAI-2 mRNA, suggesting that RNA synthesis is required for accumulation of all four transcripts. Cycloheximide (CHX) treatment altered the rate of PAI-1 and t-PA mRNA accumulation, but both were able to increase in the absence of protein synthesis. CHX blocked the rIL-1 beta-induced increase in PAI-2 mRNA levels normally observed at 8 h, indicating that protein synthesis is required for this response to IL-1. The increase in u-PA message level was augmented in a synergistic fashion by CHX. These data for PAI-2 and u-PA provide evidence for short-lived proteins which act either to modulate transcription of these genes or regulate mRNA stability. Thus plasminogen activators and their inhibitors are regulated in a positive and complex fashion in the fibroblast by IL-1, suggesting an important role for these molecules and this cell type in the response to inflammation.\r"

When AM were cultured with PAF alone, no change in TNF production was observed. However, the concomitant addition of PAF and muramyl dipeptide to AM cultures markedly enhanced (2- to 3-fold) TNF production in a concentration-dependent fashion with peak effect at 10(-10)M PAF. This enhancement occurred when muramyl dipeptide and PAF were present together at the initiation of the 24-h culture. Stimulation of TNF production by PAF was blocked by specific, but structurally different PAF receptor antagonists, BN 52021, CV3988 and WEB 2086. Additionally, the stereoisomer of PAF, [S]PAF, and the biologically inactive precursor/metabolite of PAF, lyso-PAF failed to induce significant enhancement in TNF production. In parallel, addition of PAF to AM triggered LTB4 release in a concentration-dependent manner. Inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase by nordihydro-guaiaretic acid or AA-861 blocked the PAF-induced augmentation of both TNF and LTB4 production. This was partially reversed by addition of exogenous LTB4. Collectively, these data suggest that PAF enhances TNF production by interaction with a specific putative receptor and by subsequent induction of endogenous 5-lipoxygenase activity in AM.\r"

Persistence of drug-treated parasites in the skin and draining lymph nodes, which prolonged the opportunity for efficient Ag presentation, was necessary for the development of protective immunity. Death and clearance of parasites solely in the skin, was not sufficient to induce protection. The expansion in the number of lymphocytes in the skin-draining nodes after vaccination, was reflected in the contrasting levels of resistance induced by the different drug-treatment regimes. Challenge parasites were eliminated predominantly after they reached the lungs. An investigation of antibody reactivity revealed an immunodominant response against a doublet of Ag of Mr 97 to 99 kDa. Recognition of this complex by antisera from different groups of mice was not related to their immune status. Western blots and inhibition analysis showed that this doublet has epitopes in common with the Sm97/paramyosin protective Ag, originally identified by antisera reactivity from mice immunized with a nonliving vaccine.\r"

CD69 is not present on the surface of peripheral blood resting T cells, but is constitutively expressed by CD3bright thymocytes. Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by stimulation of the TCR/CD3 or by phorbol esters directly induces CD69 expression on T cells. In the attempt to elucidate the function of CD69 we investigated the ability of the CD69 glycoprotein to transmit an activation signal. Cross-linking of CD69 by mAb induced a prolonged elevation of intracellular [Ca2+], mostly due to an influx of extracellular Ca2+. This signal alone was unable to effectively activate PKC. When PKC was simultaneously activated by PMA, stimulation of CD69 induced IL-2 and IFN-gamma gene expression, enhancement of CD25 expression, and ultimately IL-2-dependent T cell proliferation. Both CD4+ and CD8+ peripheral T cells responded to CD69-mediated activation. Stimulation of CD69 induced proliferation of thymocytes as well as peripheral T cells, but both required independent PKC activation by PMA. Cyclosporin A, which does not prevent PKC-induced CD69 expression, completely suppressed CD69-induced IL-2 and IFN-gamma gene expression. Although the signal delivered by the CD69 initiates T cell proliferation, it is unable to trigger cytotoxicity programs in CD69+-activated T cells or T cell clones.\r"

  ".W": "We have been studying the factors which permit autoimmune injury to the kidney leading to interstitial nephritis. Nonsusceptible mice develop L3T4+ effector T cells which do not recognize their 3M-1 target Ag, nor produce interstitial lesions in the kidney unless proximal tubular class II MHC Ag expression is increased, for example, by rIFN-gamma. Anti-tubular basement membrane/alpha 3M-1-Ab, normally present in such mice after immunization with 3M-1, produce an opposite result by diminishing class II transcription and expression. This unique antibody-ligand interaction on the surface of proximal tubular epithelium secreting 3M-1 serves as a novel protective regulatory response in interstitial parenchyma. The in vitro studies conveyed in this current report suggest that alpha 3M-1-Ab mediate this protective effect by reducing the transcription of mRNA encoding class II gene products. These findings, within the overall complexity of a nephritogenic immune response, demonstrate the important role certain elements may play in maintaining functional nonsusceptibility to autoimmune injury.\r"

One factor, hepatocyte-stimulating factor III (HSF-III), constitutively produced by human squamous carcinoma (COLO-16) cells, stimulates the synthesis of the same set of acute phase plasma proteins as the structurally distinct IL-6. The physicochemical properties of HSF-III coincide with those of the T cell-derived leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF). Human rLIF, tested on hepatoma cells, indicated a liver-regulating activity identical to HSF-III. The LIF activity is specifically neutralized by HSF-III antibodies. COLO-16 cells contain an LIF mRNA which is characteristic for lectin-stimulated T cells, suggesting that HSF-III is an epidermal cell-derived form of LIF. This result provides additional evidence for the close relationship between acute phase regulation of the liver and control of proliferation and differentiation of hemopoietic cells by identical cytokines.\r"
