The mechanisms leading to and maintaining neurohumoral activation in long-standing congestive heart failure are as yet undefined. The present study addresses the possibility that baroreceptor-mediated suppression of plasma norepinephrine may be abnormal in patients with long-standing congestive heart failure. Eight normal subjects and 12 patients with long-standing congestive heart failure were studied during 15 minutes of 30 degrees head-down tilt. There were no significant changes in heart rate or arterial blood pressure in either group during these maneuvers. In normal subjects, plasma norepinephrine declined from 257 +/- 38 pg/ml at control to 208 +/- 39 pg/ml during head-down tilt (p less than 0.005). Plasma norepinephrine was elevated in the patients with congestive heart failure, 475 +/- 189 pg/ml, and did not change during head-down tilt. These observations suggest that baroreflex loading maneuvers, which in this study included increased central blood volume and hydrostatic effects on the sinoaortic baroreceptor, do not suppress increased plasma norepinephrine in patients with long-standing congestive heart failure. Impaired baroreflex responsiveness could therefore contribute to either the generation or maintenance of high plasma norepinephrine in this syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "A substantial proportion of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy have circulating autoantibodies directed against the cardiac beta-adrenoceptor. These antireceptor antibodies inhibit both ligand binding to membrane beta-receptors and isoproterenol-sensitive adenylate cyclase. The functional consequences of antibody-receptor interactions were further studied by examining their influence on beta-adrenoceptor cycling. Sera from eight patients with cardiomyopathy induced a loss of beta-receptors from the surface of cardiac myocytes consistent with internalization. This loss was inhibited by concanavalin A, suggesting that receptor sequestration preceded internalization but was unaffected by the cytoskeleton inhibitors colchicine and cytochalasin. In cell-free preparations, serum-induced desensitization of beta-receptors was prevented by heparin but not the inhibitor of protein kinase A; this is consistent with a requirement for receptor phosphorylation by the beta-receptor kinase. In contrast to isoproterenol-mediated endocytosis, beta-receptors internalized under the influence of cardiomyopathic sera do not recycle to the plasma membrane. These results indicate that antireceptor antibodies in human dilated cardiomyopathy induced downregulation by interfering at several steps in the cycling of beta-receptors. These effects would contribute to the reported decline in beta-receptor responsiveness in cardiomyopathic myocardium.\r"

  ".W": "It has been suggested that cardiac injury by catecholamines may be the result of coronary constriction leading to ischemic damage. Allopurinol (ALLO) has been shown to reduce the extent of myocardial necrosis in various systems. Hence the possibility that ALLO might limit norepinephrine (NE) injury was tested. Rabbit hearts were infused with NE (3 micrograms/min/kg) for 90 minutes, with or without ALLO (50 micrograms/min/kg). Control specimens infused with saline solution plus ALLO were also prepared. Hearts were excised 48 hours later and studied as isovolumic isolated heart preparations. Peak systolic pressure, coronary flow, and myocardial oxygen consumption were significantly reduced in the hearts infused with NE but not in the NE + ALLO hearts. Myocardial adenosine triphosphate and glycogen concentrations were 29% and 26% lower in the NE hearts compared with control hearts. These reductions were absent in the NE + ALLO group. Moreover, rates of creatine phosphokinase and lactic dehydrogenase release were sharply elevated in the NE hearts but not in those also given ALLO. These findings are consistent with the changes observed histologically. The amount of myocardial damage was less in the ALLO + NE group compared with the NE group (p less than 0.02). This appears to be the first report to demonstrate that ALLO reduces myocyte damage by NE. Possible mechanisms include decreased free radical production, scavenging of free radicals, and preservation of the adenine nucleotide pool. Because xanthine oxidase activity is absent in the rabbit, the latter two mechanisms are more likely explanations for the findings.\r"

One group of hamsters (28 weeks) was given verapamil 3 days before they were killed. Two groups were withdrawn from alcohol acutely (3 days before they were killed) at 14 and 28 weeks. High-energy phosphate compounds were studied in isolated hearts with 31P-MRS standardized by freeze clamping the tissue. Hemodynamics of the heart were monitored throughout the study. After 7 and 14 weeks of alcohol ingestion, developed pressure and the phosphorylation potential were depressed in the hearts of chronically treated hamsters. At 28 and 42 weeks developed pressure increased but was significantly below baseline values; however, the phosphorylation potential and [pH]i returned to baseline values at 28 and 42 weeks. Throughout the 7 to 42 weeks of alcohol ingestion the alcohol-treated hamsters had a significantly higher end-diastolic pressure as compared with control animals. Withdrawal of alcohol (3 days before the hamsters were killed) reversed the depression of developed pressure and the phosphorylation potential. Acute administration of verapamil (therapeutic dose 3 days before they were killed) to hamsters given alcohol for 28 weeks reversed the depressed hemodynamic values. Overall the data suggest an adaptation of the heart to continuing alcohol consumption, which was related to normalization of the phosphorylation potential and [pH]i and partial alleviation of functional depression.\r"

Left ventricular mass, dimension, wall stress, and contractility (relationship between velocity of circumferential fiber shortening and end-systolic wall stress) were assessed by echocardiography. These data were compared to measurements at the onset of disease. At follow-up, mass decreased significantly from the onset in the asymptomatic patients but remained elevated in the symptomatic patients (101 +/- 35 gm/m2 to 54 +/- 12 gm/m2, p = 0.001; 122 +/- 55 gm/m2 to 198 +/- 115 gm/m2, p = 0.23, respectively). Shortening fraction and contractility were both significantly lower in the symptomatic group compared with the asymptomatic group at follow-up (shortening fraction = 21 +/- 7% vs 29 +/- 5%, p = 0.02; contractility = -0.24 +/- 0.14 circ/sec vs -0.05 +/- 0.11 circ/sec, p = 0.01). Follow-up wall stress was slightly higher in symptomatic patients compared with asymptomatic patients. Three symptomatic patients had progressive hypertrophy and either died or required transplantation. Higher left ventricular mass is associated with the presence of symptoms, depressed contractility, and slightly higher wall stress. Persistence or progression of hypertrophy may be a poor prognostic sign in survivors of childhood dilated cardiomyopathy. Measurement of mass may be useful to indicate the necessity for closer follow-up to select patients for cardiac transplantation before hemodynamic decompensation.\r"

Studied were 97 patients: 58 with normal echocardiograms, 20 with mitral regurgitation, and 19 with miscellaneous cardiac diseases. Transmitral filling was recorded at the mitral anulus and at the left atrial and left ventricular (LV) sides of the mitral tips. As the sample volume was moved from the mitral anulus to the LV side, the peak velocity and time-velocity integral of early diastole increased (40.6 +/- 13.8 versus 59.0 +/- 19.0 cm/sec, 5.26 +/- 1.65 versus 8.35 +/- 2.37 cm; p less than 0.001) as did those of late diastole (48.7 +/- 11.5 versus 57.5 +/- 17.0 cm/sec, 3.48 +/- 0.97 versus 4.59 +/- 1.39 cm; p less than 0.001). The late-to-early diastolic peak velocity and time-velocity integral ratios and the late-to-total diastolic time-velocity integral ratio decreased (1.33 +/- 0.51 versus 1.06 +/- 0.41, 0.71 +/- 0.24 versus 0.58 +/- 0.19, 0.40 +/- 0.09 versus 0.36 +/- 0.08; p less than 0.001). The dependency of these indices on the sampling site was in the same degree in all three groups. However, the peak filling rate normalized to mitral stroke volume (4.71 +/- 1.43 versus 4.63 +/- 1.32 l/sec; p = NS) was not influenced by the sample volume location; thus this parameter may be more reliable for assessing LV filling.\r"

  ".W": "Surgical valve repair for mitral regurgitation has significant advantages over valve replacement, but little is known about the mechanisms of its failure. This echocardiographic study examined abnormalities leading to failed mitral valve repair in two populations: \"immediate failure\" of the valve repair in the operating room requiring a second run of cardiopulmonary bypass and \"late failure\" of valve repair necessitating reoperation on another occasion. Intraoperative echocardiography (IOE) after cardiopulmonary bypass was performed in 309 patients undergoing valve repair for mitral regurgitation over a 3-year period. Twenty-six (8%) of these patients had immediate failure of the repair demonstrated by IOE, requiring further repair or replacement during the same thoracotomy. The causes of immediate failure were left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (10 patients), incomplete correction (10 patients), and suture dehiscence (six patients). Echocardiography was performed on 17 patients requiring reoperation for recurrent mitral regurgitation who had undergone previous primary valve repair. These late failures resulted from progressive degenerative leaflet or chordal disease (n = 9) or suture dehiscence of the annular ring or the leaflet resection site (n = 6). In only two patients early in the series did the problem originate from inadequate initial surgery. IOE is an effective marker for unsuccessful mitral valve repair, and affords an understanding of the mechanism of the persistent dysfunction. Immediate failure of mitral repair may be reduced by greater attention to the mechanism of valve dysfunction and by changes in valvuloplasty technique to avoid outflow tract obstruction. Late failure after mitral repair occurs predominantly due to progression of disease, particularly in patients with severe myxomatous or annular abnormalities that are prone to progress.\r"

Flow metabolism mismatches in which glucose metabolism is increased with respect to flow have been used to define ischemic, but viable myocardium. The feasibility of detecting exercise-induced ischemia using this technique was explored. Eleven normal volunteers and 16 patients who had undergone coronary arteriography were studied with N-13 ammonia at rest and with bicycle exercise, and with F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose in the postexercise period. Each image was divided into 16 sectors. Comparison of absolute net extractions of N-13 ammonia at rest and with exercise was not sensitive in detecting functionally significant coronary artery lesions. Myocardial uptakes of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose and exercise N-13 ammonia were normalized to the sector with the highest N-13 ammonia uptake (corresponding to the highest flow rate). The differences and ratios of these normalized uptakes were successfully used to objectively define flow metabolism mismatches and to identify functionally significant coronary artery disease. Our data suggest that exercise flow and metabolic imaging are superior to rest and exercise flow imaging, particularly in patients with prior myocardial infarctions.\r"

  ".W": "An intravascular ultrasound catheter system was used in patients to assess the effect of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. In 14 out of 16 patients, the intravascular ultrasound catheter could be successfully advanced to the site of a previous dilatation. Qualitative assessment of the cross-sectional images revealed intimal thickening and an increase of ultrasound reflectance and calcification at atherosclerotic coronary arteries. A disruption of the obstructing plaque and evidence for local dissections (11 of 14 cases) were observed after angioplasty. The quantitative comparison between angiography and the ultrasound measurement showed a close correlation for vessel sites distant to the dilatation (r = 0.91 for vessel diameter; r = 0.86 for luminal area; p less than 0.001). After angioplasty, the quantitative evaluation of the dilated area was possible in 11 cases. The correlation of angiographic and sonographic measurements of these segments was good for the assessment of the vessel diameter (r = 0.82, p less than 0.001), but poor for the determination of the luminal area (r = 0.48, p = 0.10). This difference reflected the complex morphology of the vessel lumen after angioplasty, which would be better assessed by the cross-sectional sonographic technique than by contrast angiography. The intravascular imaging of coronary arteries provides a new and unique method to obtain information on the plaque morphology and composition, and to assess the local effects of interventional procedures and their complications.\r"

There was a positive correlation between mixed venous oxygen saturation and the cardiac index in 97 survivors and 22 nonsurvivors, but a significantly lower mixed venous oxygen saturation level at the same level of cardiac index was observed in nonsurvivors compared with survivors. Results of multivariate analysis with mixed venous oxygen saturation and the cardiac index indicated that only mixed venous oxygen saturation was significantly related to survival and to hyperlactacidemia. Oxygen delivery to tissues declined significantly in nonsurvivors because of a lower cardiac index and a lower hemoglobin concentration in these patients than in survivors. However, at the same level of oxygen delivery to tissues, nonsurvivors had a significantly higher rate of oxygen consumption leading to a correspondingly greater decrease in mixed venous oxygen saturation, suggesting that a greater increase in oxygen demand was also observed in nonsurvivors than in survivors. Thus mixed venous oxygen saturation after acute myocardial infarction is a better predictor of hyperlactacidemia and survival than the cardiac index, and this may be associated with an increased oxygen demand and an impaired oxygen transport system in seriously ill patients.\r"

Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is superior to planar imaging; because of improved image quality and lack of overlap between normal and abnormal segments, SPECT has greater ability to detect diseased arteries. The inherent three-dimensional nature of the data presentation suggests the feasibility of quantifying the extent of myocardium at risk. Pharmacologic stressors such as adenosine and dipyridamole allow imaging with thallium (and probably other perfusion agents) even in patients who are not candidates for exercise testing or who cannot achieve adequate levels of exercise. Studies suggest that adenosine has unique advantages for use with SPECT perfusion imaging with a high degree of accuracy. In our experience the sensitivity of detecting one-vessel disease is higher with adenosine-thallium imaging than in exercise SPECT thallium imaging. The degree of coronary hyperemia is greater and the duration of action is shorter with adenosine than with dipyridamole.\r"

Frequently, however, patients cannot achieve maximal exercise because of various factors. Pharmacologic stress testing with intravenous adenosine was evaluated as a means of detecting CAD in a noninvasive manner. Patients with suspected CAD underwent echocardiographic imaging and simultaneous thallium 201 single-photon emission computed tomography during the intravenous administration of 140 micrograms/kg/min of adenosine. An increase in heart rate, decrease in blood pressure, and increase in double product were observed during adenosine administration. Initial observations revealed that wall motion abnormalities were induced by adenosine in areas of perfusion defects. The adenosine infusion was well tolerated, and symptoms disappeared within 1 to 2 minutes after termination of the infusion. Therefore preliminary observations suggest that adenosine echocardiography appears to be useful in the assessment of CAD.\r"

Adenosine has several advantages over dipyridamole as a pharmacologic stress agent for use with PET. It produces maximal vasodilation in a significantly greater percentage of patients, is a more potent coronary vasodilator, and its very short half-life may be ideal for use with the very short half-life radioactive tracers used in PET.

Three serial 60-second circumflex coronary artery occlusions were performed with CPS initiated only during the second occlusion. CPS significantly reduced preocclusion systolic blood pressure, blood pressure x heart rate double-product, circumflex blood flow, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), peak negative dP/dt, and left ventricular systolic thickening. Circumflex occlusion caused changes in LVEDP and left ventricular wall thickening that were similar regardless of the presence or absence of CPS. These data suggest that CPS unloads the left ventricle during myocardial ischemia but does not prevent regional or global myocardial dysfunction.\r"

To assess the influence of these angiographic features on immediate and long-term results of PTCA, we prospectively compared the success rate, incidence of procedural complications, and restenosis rate in two groups of patients selected on the basis of the presence (study group = 30 patients) or absence (control group = 200 patients) of complex morphology at the time of angioplasty. The two groups were similar with regard to extent of coronary artery disease and site of coronary stenosis. Patients in the study group had a higher incidence of periprocedural acute coronary occlusion (47% vs 6%; p less than 0.01), which in 78% of the cases was successfully treated with repeat angioplasty and intracoronary thrombolysis. Univariate correlates of this complication were Canadian Cardiovascular Society class IV (57% vs 19%; p less than 0.05) and recent (less than 30 days) onset of worsening of symptoms (71% vs 31%; p less than 0.05). The incidence of acute myocardial infarction was slightly higher in the study group (6.7% vs 2%; p = NS), and the success rate with redilatation was the same (90%). Clinical and angiographic follow-up data were obtained from all patients in whom the procedure was successful; the restenosis rate was 55% in the study group compared with 36% in the control group (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Actuarial analysis showed that the restenosis rate was time dependent and was 80% at 15 months. However, functional improvement was observed in most of the patients with or without restenosis. The restenosis rate was not correlated with the degree of enlargement of the aortic orifice produced by the valvuloplasty procedure. Because of the high incidence of restenosis, balloon aortic valvuloplasty should be limited to patients who have a contraindication to surgery or are at high risk for surgery, or as a bridge to surgery.\r"

This study evaluates echocardiography (two-dimensional, pulsed Doppler, and color flow mapping) as a method to establish the diagnosis of ALC. To diagnose ALC, a modified parasternal short-axis view was used to demonstrate continuity of the ALC with the pulmonary trunk and to detect the retrograde flow through the ALC into the pulmonary trunk. Absence of these imaging characteristics ruled out ALC. From June 1985 to January 1990, 16 patients who presented with or had previously had a dilated poorly contracting left ventricle were prospectively assessed by echocardiography to rule out ALC. Four patients had ALC (age 2 to 120 months, mean +/- 1SD = 32 +/- 59) and 12 patients (age 1 to 192 months, mean +/- 1SD = 57 +/- 80) had myocardiopathy. Two other patients with known ALC were evaluated by an observer unaware of the diagnosis. All coronary anatomy was confirmed by angiography, surgery, or autopsy. The correct diagnosis of coronary anatomy was obtained by echocardiography in all instances without false positive or false negative diagnosis of ALC. Three infants underwent surgical repair of ALC based only on the echocardiographic diagnosis. Echocardiography can be used to establish the diagnosis of ALC. Therefore surgical repair can be undertaken in some critically sick infants based on the echocardiographic diagnosis alone.\r"

Diagnosis may elude routine screening procedures, and even when an anomalous vessel is identified angiographically, it may be difficult to delineate its true course on the basis of angiography alone. The purpose of this study was to determine whether transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is of value in making the diagnosis and outlining the course of anomalous coronary arteries. Five adult patients with anomalous origin of a coronary artery were studied by monoplane TEE and selective coronary angiography. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was also performed in four of these five patients. Anomalous coronary ostia were visualized in four of five patients utilizing TEE, but in none of four patients by TTE. A proximal segment of the anomalous coronary vessel was identified in all five patients by TEE, and in only two of four patients by TTE. TEE images were consistently of superior diagnostic quality. TEE is a valuable tool for the echocardiographic identification of anomalous coronary arteries, and is superior to TTE in adult patients.\r"

This new perfusion agent was injected in 25 patients during elective percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of a single-vessel left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery stenosis. Distinct perfusion defects were present on \"occlusion\" images but not on \"open vessel\" images obtained 20 to 24 hours later in 21 patients (84%). The extent and severity of perfusion defects were significantly smaller in patients with distal versus proximal LAD occlusions (3.4 +/- 1.2 versus 5.2 +/- 1.5 segments; p less than 0.001). The only factor that was significantly related to the presence or absence of such \"ischemic\" perfusion defects was the absence or presence of visible collateral vessels to the LAD (p less than 0.03). The site of occlusion, presence of wall motion abnormalities, or occlusion time did not influence the results significantly. Thus the myocardial area at risk could be visualized and quantitated by Tc-MIBI imaging even after occlusion times as short as 15 seconds, but functioning collateral vessels are capable of protecting jeopardized myocardium in this setting.\r"

Electrical discharge was delivered at the site of the earliest endocardial activation in 17 VTs, and at the slow conduction area in two VTs. Among 19 VTs in 12 patients, 12 VTs (63%) in seven patients (58%) were successfully ablated and became noninducible during electrophysiologic study. There were no major complications, but transient atrioventricular block occurred in one patient and transient friction rub occurred in another. Delivered electrical energy and the time interval between the local electrogram and the surface QRS did not correlate with the clinical outcome of the procedure. However, \"excellent\" pace-mapped QRS morphology was obtained from the site of earliest activation or from the slow conduction area in 9 of 12 VTs in the successful cases but in only one of seven VTs in the unsuccessful cases. Low-energy catheter electrical ablation seems to be a satisfactory therapeutic procedure compared with the conventional method that uses an energy level of 200 joules or higher.\r"

These patients had lower left ventricular ejection fractions (27 +/- 12 vs 34 +/- 13; p less than 0.03) and a higher incidence of previous heart surgery (47% vs 19%; p less than 0.01) than patients with normal DFTs but did not differ in age, type of heart disease, incidence of concomitant heart surgery, or use of antiarrhythmic medication.

After 22 +/- 11 months of follow-up, four patients with ICDs died (two suddenly, and two of nonsudden cardiac causes). Two patients without ICDs died of nonsudden cardiac causes. Appropriate shocks were received by five patients (29%) including both who died suddenly later. A high DFT may be more common than previously stated. It is associated with poor ventricular function and previous heart surgery. Repeated DFT testing may be useful in some patients. A high DFT does not preclude successful ICD shocks, but other therapies may provide better results.\r"

Amiodarone reduced systemic vascular resistence and LV and aortic pressures in both groups (13%, 18%, and 13%, respectively [group N], and 15%, 17%, and 15%, respectively [group L]) over the short term. Heart rate initially increased (18%, group L, and 10% group N), but was followed by a late 6% decrease in group N only, and by a progressive reduction in contractility (Vmax), together with a rise in LV end-diastolic pressure (19% and 38%, respectively [group N] and 17% and 58%, respectively [group L]; all values p less than 0.05 versus control). Coronary flow increased significantly by 20% (group N) and 31% (group L), but only during amiodarone administration, accompanied by a 26% and 25% reduction in myocardial oxygen extraction in groups N and L, respectively. Stroke work decreased in both groups (20% [group N] and 19% [group L], p less than 0.05 versus control). In contrast, cardiac output only improved (10%) in patients with impaired ventricular function. Significant side effects did not occur. Thus relatively high dosages of intravenous amiodarone are well tolerated and improve cardiac pump function in patients with an impaired, but not with a normal cardiac function. However, the tendency to increase LV end-diastolic pressures necessitates careful monitoring in patients in whom preexisting LV filling pressure may be elevated.\r"

The rate of acute myocardial infarction was 3%. No deaths and only 1 serious complication occurred in the coronary observation unit. At 6 month follow-up, the cardiac survival rate was 99% for patients sent home directly from this unit. It is concluded that the coronary observation unit is safe and adequate for ruling out acute myocardial infarction in a defined subset of patients. Short-stay units, however, encourage early discharges which, when premature, may miss patients who are at risk of having complications shortly thereafter. Strategies such as mandatory but expeditious predischarge stress testing to encourage early but not premature discharge may augment the efficiency of coronary observation units.\r"

Patients were nonrandomly allocated to a group (n = 14) without autonomic drugs and to a group (n = 10) already receiving beta blockers at the time of AMI. With use of autoregressive modeling, the power spectrum of HR variability was computed from continuous 1-hour electrocardiographic segments recorded at equally spaced intervals; 7 to 8 A.M., 3 to 4 P.M., and 11 to 12 P.M. All patients were supine, awake and pain free during recordings. There were no differences in HR, HR variance or the low-frequency peak power (0.06 to 0.1 Hz) from one temporal sequence to another. For the patients not taking beta blockers, the high-frequency peak power (0.2 to 0.36 Hz) or vagal component increased significantly from 3 P.M. to 11 P.M. (28 +/- 11 to 45 +/- 20 beats/min2.Hz-1, p less than 0.01). There was a significant decrease in the low- to high-frequency peak power and area ratios from 3 P.M. to 11 P.M. All power spectral parameters in the patients taking beta blockers remained unchanged over 24 hours. There was significantly heightened vagal modulation of sinus node activity in those receiving beta blockers, especially at 7 A.M. and 3 P.M. The data suggest that under steady-state wakeful conditions in the early recovery phase after an AMI, vagal tone is more pronounced during the late evening hours with a possible shift to relative sympathetic dominance during early morning and midafternoon hours.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Accordingly, we assessed risk factors in 107 treated patients of whom 4 had intracerebral hemorrhage.

Significant differences were found between patients with and without intracerebral hemorrhage for age (77 +/- 7 vs 62 +/- 11 years, p less than or equal to 0.01), and initial (161 +/- 23 vs 135 +/- 23 mm Hg, p less than or equal to 0.03) and maximal (171 +/- 30 vs 146 +/- 20, p less than or equal to 0.02) systolic blood pressures.

Differences did not achieve significance for comparisons of gender, height, weight, site of infarction, time to therapy, specific thrombolytic agent used, concomitant therapy, interventions and partial thromboplastin time. It is concluded that age (greater than or equal to 70 years) and elevated blood pressure (greater than or equal to 150/95 mm Hg) are important risk factors for intracerebral hemorrhage. The overall balance of benefit and risk of thrombolysis should continue to be assessed by large mortality trials.\r"

Thus, only a low percentage of the patients with a normal initial electrocardiogram or a vague initial suspicion of AMI developed a confirmed AMI.\r"

All patients performed a Bruce protocol exercise test and underwent 24-hour Holter recording within 2 weeks without antianginal medications. Mean exercise duration was 7.4 +/- 2.8 minutes, mean heart rate at 1-mm ST depression was 118 +/- 20 beats/min and mean maximal ST depression during exercise was 2.2 +/- 1 mm. During Holter recording the average number of ischemic episodes was 4.7 +/- 2.6 per patient, mean duration of daily ischemia was 62 +/- 54 minutes, mean maximal ST depression was 3.2 +/- 1.3 mm and average heart rate at 1-mm ST depression was 93 +/- 17 beats/min. Overall, the correlations between ischemic indexes on both testing procedures were very weak (mean r2 = 0.054). The only exercise variable that had a significant correlation (p less than 0.05) with all Holter variables was heart rate at 1-mm ST depression, yet it correlated very weakly (0.064 less than or equal to r2 less than or equal to 0.125) with most Holter covariates and had a better correlation (r2 = 0.256) only with average heart rate at 1-mm ST depression during Holter. Thus, ischemic indexes on exercise testing cannot accurately predict ischemic indexes on ambulatory Holter recording in patients with stable coronary artery disease who exhibit ischemic changes on both tests.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Arterial and coronary venous lactate and arterial values of catecholamines and angiotensin II were determined at control, at maximal pacing rates, and at 1, 2, 5 and 30 minutes after pacing. Based on pacing-induced ST-segment depression (greater than or equal to 0.1 mV) or myocardial lactate production, or both, patients were selected as ischemic (n = 25) or nonischemic (n = 7). Baseline clinical and hemodynamic data were comparable. During pacing, chest pain was similar (20 ischemic vs 7 nonischemic patients). Also, hemodynamic measurements were comparable, except for contractility, which did not improve, and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, which significantly increased in ischemic patients. Moreover, during ischemia arterial pressures increased significantly (13%) and systemic resistance increased from 1,470 +/- 60 (control) to 1,632 +/- 76 dynes.s.cm-5 5 minutes after pacing (p less than 0.05) in ischemic but not in nonischemic patients. Pacing did not affect neurohormones in nonischemic patients. In contrast, norepinephrine in ischemic patients increased significantly from 1.7 +/- 0.2 (control) to 2.6 +/- 0.3 (maximal pacing) and to 3.0 +/- 0.4 nmol/liter (1 minute after pacing), whereas angiotensin II levels increased from 6.2 +/- 1.4 (control) to 9.3 +/- 2.1 pmol/liter (1 minute after pacing, p less than 0.05). Epinephrine only increased during maximal rates (0.9 +/- 0.1 vs 0.6 +/- 0.1 nmol/liter at control, p less than 0.05). Thus, myocardial ischemia activates circulating catecholamines and angiotensin II, accompanied by systemic vasoconstriction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

No patient had sustained a myocardial infarction within 2 weeks of surgery or was undergoing other concurrent cardiac surgery. The average age of the study patients was 57 +/- 9 years and the average ejection fraction was 35 +/- 13%. Ninety percent of the patients underwent concurrent bypass grafting, with an average of 2.2 +/- 1.3 grafts placed. Fourteen (5%) patients died in the hospital, with most deaths attributable to LV dysfunction. Advanced age and less extensive revascularization were correlates of in-hospital mortality. The 10-year survival was 57%, myocardial infarction-free survival 43%, and freedom from death, myocardial infarction and reoperative coronary surgery 41%. Advanced age, systemic hypertension, significant left main coronary artery narrowing and emergent operative status were multivariate correlates of long-term mortality. A low-risk population was defined by the absence of these risk factors, and high-risk by the presence of greater than or equal to 1 risk factors. The 10-year survival was 71% in the low-risk and 41% in the high-risk groups (p = .0006). The 10-year myocardial infarction free survival was 55% in the low-risk and 31% in the high-risk groups (p = 0.0017).

At electrophysiologic study, all patients had absent or minimal preexcitation in sinus rhythm. During atrial pacing and extrastimulus testing, maximal preexcitation with left bundle branch block morphology developed and the AH and AV intervals progressively prolonged. Preexcited tachycardia was initiated in all patients (AV reentrant tachycardia in 10 patients and AV node reentrant tachycardia in 1 patient). At operation all patients had a right parietal accessory pathway demonstrated. Intraoperative mapping demonstrated the earliest site of ventricular activation during anterograde preexcitation to be at the midanterior right ventricle, consistent with insertion of these pathways into the right bundle branch system, in 7 patients. The ventricular insertion was at the AV groove in 4 patients, in keeping with the typical Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Retrograde conduction over the pathway was not demonstrated in any patient. Two patients had evidence of a second accessory AV pathway in the left paraseptal region. Operative AV node ablation was electively performed in 2 patients without affecting preexcitation in either case. In 1 of these patients, accessory pathway conduction was temporarily abolished by ice mapping in the right anterolateral AV groove.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Late or holosystolic posterior displacement of mitral leaflets, greater than or equal to 2 mm, occurred in the reconstructions from 24 of 24 (100%) patients with MVP with leaflet billowing and in 20 of 24 (83%) patients with MVP without leaflet billowing compared with 4 of 35 (11%) age-sex matched normal adults (both p less than 0.0000002). Posterior motion of the posterior mitral leaflet in time-motion reconstruction was significantly less with respect to the posterior end of the mitral anulus than with respect to the chest wall in patients with nonbillowing MVP (1.6 +/- 1.9 vs 2.7 +/- 1.6, p less than 0.02), but not in those with leaflet billowing (3.6 +/- 1.8 vs 3.9 +/- 1.8, p = not significant), because anular expansion contributed importantly to MVP in the former but not in the latter group. Thus, M-mode echocardiographic patterns of MVP reflect the separate but interacting effects of distinct abnormalities of mitral anular and leaflet dynamics.\r"

Radiation doses were measured during chest roentgenography, fluoroscopy and cineangiography. Average skin dose to the chest was 121 microGy during chest x-ray, 5,182 microGy during catheterization and 641 mGy during valvuloplasty. For the eyes, thyroid and gonads of the patients, the exposure during routine catheterization was equal to 0.4, 6 and 0.2 chest x-rays, respectively. Radiation dose of the operator was 3 microGy for the eyes and 6 miCroGy in the thyroid. About 56% of the operator's dose could be reduced by thyroid shields, and 80% by lead aprons. The assistant received only 1 microGy outside the thyroid shield. Therefore, we have concluded that the patients' dose during routine catheterization is largely based on our experimental results, but the dose is acceptable based on the risk factor analysis. The skin dose to the right lateral chest of the patient during valvuloplasty is extremely high, perhaps as high as the equivalent of 1,000 chest x-rays. Besides the clinical benefits of valvuloplasty, the long-term radiation-related hazards to the patient should be carefully monitored.\r"

Intraluminal inspection, with angioscopes of 0.85 to 1.5 mm in outer diameter housed within a guide catheter, could be performed in 55 of 57 lesions (96%) before atherectomy and in 39 of these 55 (71%) after atherectomy. Failure to obtain an adequate image was usually due to insufficient irrigation, especially in recanalized vessels. In 13 of 23 successfully recanalized arteries (54%) the occlusion could be crossed by the angioscope itself, whereas in 10 cases (42%) a guidewire or a sheath introducer was necessary. Angioscopic passage revealed that often long total occlusions, determined by angiography, consisted of greater than or equal to 1 discrete occlusion with interposed patent thrombus-free vascular segments. After atherectomy, in 15 instances with an acceptable angiographic result, angioscopy was helpful in identifying residual plaques and flaps which then selectively underwent atherectomy. In conclusion, angioscopy proved to be a useful adjunct to angiography in optimizing vascular recanalization with percutaneous atherectomy.\r"

To assess development of this phenomenon, we studied HR changes in response to orthostasis and treadmill exercise in 52 orthotopic cardiac transplant recipients grouped according to time after transplantation. In group 1 (2.0 +/- 0.9 months), no significant increase in HR was seen up to 100 cardiac cycles after standing. A maximal acceleration of 4.0 +/- 3.8 beats was seen within 100 cardiac cycles after standing in group 2 (15.8 +/- 5.6 months). Patients in group 3 (42.4 +/- 12.4 months) showed significant cardioacceleration by 5 cardiac cycles after standing to a maximum of 10.7 +/- 5.8 beats/min within the first 100 cardiac cycles. During exercise, HR increased more rapidly during the first minute in group 3 compared with group 1 (p less than 0.01). After exercise, HR continued to increase in group 1 but decreased rapidly in the other groups, most notably group 3 (-26.5 +/- 16.5 by 2 minutes, p less than 0.0001 vs groups 1 and 2). These data indicate development of functional reinnervation after orthotopic heart transplantation. The phenomenon of early acceleration of the HR after orthostasis and rapid deceleration after exercise in transplant recipients implies a local cardiac mechanism rather than response to circulating catecholamines.\r"

These intensities were associated with a total excursion of the ultrasound irradiation apparatus tip from 90 to 268 microns, respectively. Time to perforate normal aortic sites and fibrous and calcified plaques was recorded at each intensity. There was no difference in perforation time between normal aortic sites and fibrous and calcified plaques when high-power levels (P2 to P5) were used. However, at the lowest power (P1), perforation time for the normal aortic wall was significantly longer than for fibrous and calcified plaques: 30 +/- 18 seconds (166 observations), 14 +/- 7 seconds (p less than 0.001) (78 observations) and 12 +/- 8 seconds (p less than 0.001) (115 observations), respectively. When perforation times for normal vessel wall versus fibrous plaque and normal vessel wall versus calcified plaque from the same necropsy specimen were compared in a pairwise manner, the results were: 29 +/- 13 vs 16 +/- 7 (p less than 0.001) (48 paired observations) and 26 +/- 9 vs 10 +/- 5 seconds (p less than 0.001) (55 paired observations), respectively. Regardless of whether paired or unpaired comparison was applied, no significant difference was found in perforation time between fibrous and calcified plaques. The debris did not differ in size as measured separately for normal sites and fibrous and calcified plaques by a computer-interfaced Channelizer and Coulter Counter system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, neonaticides have decreased, a phenomenon mirroring a marked fall in fatal maternal criminal abortions. As previously noted, modalities of lethal violence in pedicide are significantly determined by victim age. An increasing proportion of pedicide victims, like their adult counterparts, have been killed by firearms. Pedicide victims are much apt to be killed by close relatives than are adult homicide victims. Similarly, perpetrators of pedicide are much more likely to commit suicide than are their adult-slaying counterparts. Fatally \"battered\" children, the victims of multiple, metasynchronous traumata, represent a significant fraction (22%) of the overall pedicide population and constitute a segment of the victims with a potential for being saved by intervention. Overall, pedicide remains a challenge to our profession and a threat to society as a whole.\r"

Three deaths were due to overlying. Three other infants had been placed on sheepskin rugs for the first time and were found dead shortly thereafter. These infants ranged in age from 2 to 9 months, except for a severely mentally retarded nine-year-old with spastic paraplegia. We believe that a general warning should be issued concerning water beds and that soft bedding should not be used for infants. Infants should not be placed unattended or left to sleep on water beds; only beds recommended for infants should be used. Overlying of a young infant is most likely to occur on a water bed, or if the parent is obese or has consumed alcohol.\r"

Unorthodox sexual behavior, such as \"fisting,\" has increased in frequency, as has sexual violence related to cults, such as satanism.

To investigate the gender, racial and socio-economic components of these problems, as well as the contribution of chronic disabilities, all deaths in a single state over a 7-year period in the birth through 24-year-old population were studied. Females and males overall had no appreciable differences in house-fire mortality. Females from birth through age 4 were more at risk, however, than older females of dying in house fires, but did not appear at more risk than males of the same age. Nonwhite males under age 4 were much more at risk than white males. Nonwhite females compared similarly to white females, both in the birth through 4-year age range, as well as in the overall population studied. Males had more drowning deaths overall than females, with most of the difference attributable to a large male predominance in the 15- through 24-year age group. Furthermore, males in this age group were much more likely to drown than were younger males. Both males and females in this age group were at particular risk if they had a past history of seizures. No other gender or racial differences could be determined, either in the overall population or in the separate age groups, except in victims greater than 4 years of age many more deaths were found in the lower three socio-economic quintiles than in the higher two.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Adrenocortical atrophy has not been described previously in this clinical context. The increasing administration of steroids to asthmatic children may lead to the production of overt--or more frequently, subclinical--atrophy of the adrenal cortices with important consequences to mortality and morbidity.\r"

Two of the patients discussed here had CVMs that involved the circle of Willis directly, and produced rapidly fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage at the base of the brain; both of these subjects were in their late 30s. One had a history of epilepsy; the other had been completely asymptomatic prior to the catastrophic event. The third was an asymptomatic 6 year old with a cerebellar CVM, who survived long enough for inconclusive neurosurgical intervention. In all three cases, the diagnosis was not made prior to autopsy; in one case, the circumstances of death were initially misleading. The relevant literature is reviewed and discussed, with emphasis on differential diagnosis, anatomic examination, and background investigation.\r"

In this technique, a reaction precolumn packed with chloramine-T was used for the conversion of hydrogen cyanide into cyanogen chloride. Since the reaction precolumn eliminated the necessity of trapping hydrogen cyanide from biological samples, blood cyanide could be analyzed quickly by acidification only. Using this method, blood cyanide levels of fire victims were determined at autopsy. The serum values of cyanide ranged from 0.11 micrograms/ml to 18.12 micrograms/ml. However, a significantly higher cyanide content was detected in the left ventricular blood than in the right. This indicates that death was caused by the fire and suggests that the collecting point of the blood sample is an important factor in the determination of inhaled cyanide. There was a positive correlation between blood cyanide and carboxyhemoglobin contents.\r"

It is polymerized in water; this process is then followed by the formation of silicone resin and the release of N,N-diethylhydroxylamine. In this decedent, analysis by infrared spectroscopy showed that polymerized silicone resin was present in the stomach contents. The amount of silica in his tissues was within levels seen in control subjects. N,N-diethylhydroxylamine was detected in the urine (0.7 microliters/ml) but not in the stomach contents. The data suggest that SH792 was polymerized in the stomach and the released N,N-diethylhydroxylamine (DEHA) was absorbed into the body. The mechanism of SH792 poisoning is also discussed.\r"

Therefore, preventive measures can be proposed at present only on the basis of retrospective studies and hypothetical considerations. Two main solutions may be recommended, namely an effective dialytic removal of beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-M), which is the protein precursor of dialysis amyloid, and the avoidance of bioincompatibility-associated phenomena such as those induced by dialysis membranes and endotoxins. Promising new imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) scan, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and scintigraphy with specific tracers for amyloid may be helpful to evaluate the long-term results of different treatment schedules, including various strategies of renal replacement therapy.\r"

Resurvey in 1988 of this cohort of units found that clinical indications for ESWL treatment--stone size and location--expanded greatly. Professional fees for ESWL services remained essentially constant, while technical component charges increased 21.0%. Volume of procedures declined by 19.8% among the most productive units, and by 34.4% among the least productive study units; the previously noted approximate fourfold difference remained unchanged between most and least productive units. ESWL patterns of diffusion were comparable to other equipment-embodied diagnostic technology (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] and computed tomography [CT]) during the first few years of clinical availability. ESWL growth slowed sooner than that of CT and MRI following their introduction into clinical practice, declining in the fourth to fifth year of use following rapid expansion in the first 2 years of availability. While clinical indications for both ESWL and imaging technologies expanded over time, CT and MRI experienced continued growth beyond that of ESWL at the same points of their respective life cycles. In the market areas of the 84 study units, the use of ESWL declined even with expanded indications for treatment, perhaps due to faster expansion of number of units than growth of clinical indications for treatment.\r"

  ".W": "The differentiation between cyclosporine nephrotoxicity (CyN) and acute rejection (AR) still remains a matter of intensive research. In a retrospective study over the last 2 years, we assessed the clinical and histopathological data of 43 episodes of renal dysfunction in 39 renal transplant recipients immunosuppressed with cyclosporine (CyA). Ten episodes (23.2%) were identified as AR and 10 (23.2%) as acute CyN; in six cases (13.9%), signs of both AR and CyN were found. Fever (80%), oliguria (50%), and edema (50%) were prominent features in AR, but not in CyN. Renal blood flow was higher in the nephrotoxicity group and for corresponding degree of renal dysfunction. Significant hyperuricemia (greater than 8 mg/dL) was a prominent finding in CyN (80%) and to a lesser extent in AR (20%). The helper to suppressor cell ratio in the peripheral blood remained stable or slightly decreased in all cases with CyN, but increased in 70% of the cases with AR. CyN was associated with significantly higher whole blood CyA levels (P less than 0.005) and there was a positive correlation between plasma creatinine and CyA levels during the nephrotoxicity episodes (P less than 0.02). Diffuse mononuclear cell infiltrate was observed in 90% of the biopsies with AR and only in 20% with CyN (P less than 0.005). Concerning the extent of the tubular lesions, no significant differences were observed between the two groups. In contrast, vascular lesions such as arterial endothelial proliferation (P less than 0.05), hyalinosis (P less than 0.05), and glomerular capillary thrombi (P less than 0.05) were more commonly seen in nephrotoxicity biopsies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91290022\r", 
  ".W": "Cyclosporine A (CyA) is a potent immunosuppressive agent that is used in organ transplantation and in a variety of immunological diseases. It has a variety of adverse side effects, some of which can be serious and even life-threatening. CyA-associated neurotoxicity is generally mild, consisting of fine tremor. However, more complex neurologic abnormalities, including motor spinal cord and cerebellar syndromes, have rarely been described in bone marrow and liver transplant patients. Renal transplant patients have been spared from such CyA-induced toxicity. In this report, three renal transplant patients are described who developed complex and severe neurologic toxicity in the setting of therapeutic blood levels of CyA, which was completely reversible on discontinuation of the drug. No patient had a prior history of neurological or psychiatric dysfunction and there was no evidence of known psychoactive substance abuse. The toxicity was manifested as flaccid hemiparesis in one and dementia in a second patient. The third patient developed a previously unreported Guillain-Barre-like syndrome consisting of an ascending motor neuropathy. One patient developed reversible lesions involving the cerebral white matter. Whereas similar complex neurologic syndromes have been confined to patients who are intensely immunosuppressed, often debilitated, and have toxic levels of the drug, these three patients serve to emphasize that complex neurotoxicity can occur in stable patients who have therapeutic levels of CyA. Given the use of CyA in an ever-expanding list of disease processes, an appreciation of these potential neurologic syndromes is of paramount importance. At present, CyA-induced neurologic disease remains a diagnosis of exclusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

During a follow-up ranging from 1 to 36 years, with a mean of 8 years, 18% of the patients (50/282) had gone into chronic renal failure (CRF), with 18 of them in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (6%). The univariate comparison of patients with CRF versus patients without CRF showed multiple risk factors: mainly arterial hypertension, an amount of proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome, a high level of serum IgA, presence of HLA-B35 antigen, and the intensity of most pathological lesions on light microscopy. The actuarial survival rate for a normal renal function (serum creatinine less than 135 mumol/L [1.5 mg/dL]) was 84% at 10 years and 64% at 20 years. The multivariate study allowed the isolation of only four risk factors with a significant effect on survival rate. These were the amount of proteinuria, the global optical score on first renal biopsy, the presence of an initial hypertension, and the presence of the HLA-B35 antigen. From these results, the probability of renal survival for individual patients may be calculated and a high-risk subgroup defined. Our data confirm the greater usefulness of multivariate over univariate statistical analyses in finding risk factors for CRF in IgA-GN.\r"

Successful treatment depends on early catheter removal, drainage of fluid collections, and appropriate use of antimicrobial agents. We report a case of Mycobacterium fortuitum peritonitis in a patient undergoing CAPD, and review all previously reported cases. Diagnostic and therapeutic strategies are summarized based on available literature.\r"

The peak activity in liver was reached at 21.1 minutes (range, 18 to 26 minutes) in patients and 19 minutes (range, 14 to 22 minutes) in controls. The rate of increase of liver radioactivity was found to be significantly slower in patients (with a mean slope of 5.0; range, 3.4 to 7.1 v 7.6, 5.6 to 11.4; P less than 0.02). The mean liver to precordium ratio at the peak time was significantly lower in patients (mean value, 2.3; range, 1.9 to 3.1) compared with controls (mean value, 3.3; range, 2.4 to 4.0) (P less than 0.02).

After a control period of 18.2 +/- 20.4 months, LPVLP therapy was initiated and serum urea nitrogen, uric acid, and phosphate, as well as urinary excretion of protein, creatinine, urea nitrogen, uric acid, and phosphate, decreased significantly. There was no change in mean blood pressure, hemoglobin, blood pH, and HCO3-, as well as in serum creatinine, protein, albumin, calcium, magnesium, cholesterol, triglyceride, beta-lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol. Nitrogen balances were measured over 5 weeks in nine patients. Nitrogen balance increased significantly from a negative balance of -0.795 +/- 1.367 g/d in the first week, to almost neutral in the fourth week, and later, was neutral or positive. Neither uremic symptoms nor signs of malnutrition appeared during the LPVLP period. These results suggest that negative nitrogen balance during the initial few weeks does not predict future nutritional status of patients with diabetic renal failure.\r"

To determine whether the incidence of hypertension as a causative diagnosis of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is also decreasing, we examined the records of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) from 1980 to 1986 regarding the causative diagnoses of patients entering ESRD programs. We found that the incidence of patients entering ESRD programs increased during the study period. Hypertension as a causative diagnosis was a constant proportion of the increase. The greatest increase occurred in patients age 55 or more years. This was strikingly true of black patients. We conclude that there has not been a decrease in the incidence of hypertension as a causative diagnosis for patients entering ESRD programs and that this may be a reflection that treatment of hypertension does not prevent the development of ESRD in some patients. We propose that prospective studies be undertaken to determine whether this is the case.\r"

Patients were studied three times: (I) after a 4-week run-in period, (II) on the final day of treatment, and (III) after a 4-week wash-out. Median 24-hour urinary protein excretion decreased on treatment from 10.45 g/d to 5.25 g/d and increased to pretreatment levels after the drug was stopped (P less than 0.05 for both changes). Fractional clearance of dextrans greater than 4.1 nm decreased on treatment, indicating both a reduction of macromolecules passing through the shunt pathway of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and a possible decrease in ultrafiltration coefficient. There were no significant changes in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), effective renal plasma flow (ERPF), or mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) throughout the study. The effect of enalapril in treating proteinuria appears therefore to be due to a specific intraglomerular action.\r"

The initial dose of erythropoietin was 50 U/kg intravenously (IV) three times a week. Every 4 weeks, the dose was increased by 25 U/kg until a normalization of bleeding time was achieved. Erythropoietin at a dose ranging from 150 to 300 U/kg/wk induced an increase in PCV to a range of 27% to 32% in all patients but one, and normalized bleeding time in all patients. A significant negative correlation (r = 0.898, P less than 0.001) was found between PCV and bleeding time measurements. Erythropoietin also significantly (P less than 0.01) increased values for red blood cell (RBC) distribution width (basal, 11.3 +/- 0.6; 12 weeks, 13.1 +/- 1.3). Platelet count and platelet function parameters did not significantly change. In untreated patients, no changes were recorded in all the parameters considered. These results establish in a controlled fashion that erythropoietin shortens bleeding time of uremic patients and indicate that a partial correction of renal anemia is enough to normalize bleeding time.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that low-dose recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEpo) would be effective and safe therapy for the anemia of end-stage renal failure, we studied 37 chronic hemodialysis patients for 3 months before and 6 months after beginning treatment with r-HuEpo, 3,000 U, administered initially intravenously (IV) three times weekly. Hematocrit increased from a mean of 25.2 vol% into the target range (mean, 32.2 vol%, a 28% increase) by 4 months. Transfusion requirements were dramatically reduced. Eight patients (22%) had exacerbated or new development of hypertension, while in trials using higher doses this occurred in 35%. Vascular access thrombosis, dialyzer clotting, and seizures were not seen more frequently during r-HuEpo therapy. Dialyzer reuse was not affected. Low-dose r-HuEpo therapy is effective in most hemodialysis patients and may be associated with less adverse effects because of the slower increase in blood viscosity. As targets are reached, downward dosage adjustments need to be smaller when using an initial low-dose regimen.\r"

Renal physiology and pathophysiology were at best embryonic in the United States and elsewhere. The frequency and severity of medical renal diseases maintained the interest of some of the most astute physicians of the late 19th century; however, they had to remain frustrated by their inadequate diagnostic and, especially, therapeutic ability.\r"

Erythrocyte taurine levels tended to be higher in MHD patients predialysis (1.2 +/- 0.2 v 0.7 +/- 0.1 nmol/10(9) cells, P less than 0.05 where P less than 0.025 is significant) as compared with controls; erythrocyte taurine was increased after dialysis (to 1.8 +/- 0.3 nmol/10(9) cells, P less than 0.006). In contrast, platelet taurine concentrations in MHD patients were lower than normal predialysis (18 +/- 2 v 27 +/- 2 nmol/10(9) cells) and declined further during the dialysis procedure (to 14 +/- 1). Granulocyte and lymphocyte taurine levels were not different in MHD patients, as compared with normal adults, either before or after dialysis. The observed differences in blood cell taurine content (expressed per 10(9) cells) could not be explained by variation in cell volumes among the groups examined. Thus, both chronic renal failure and a routine hemodialysis treatment produce changes in cell and plasma taurine levels that tend to be specific for the individual cell type.\r"

To establish the need for ascorbic acid supplements, we evaluated seven chronic peritoneal dialysis patients during a supplement-free (phase I) period, and while receiving oral ascorbic acid (0.57 mmol/d [100 mg/d]) (phase II). Because of a proposed interaction with vitamin B6, patients were additionally supplemented with pyridoxine HCl (59.6 mumol/d [10 mg/d]) (phase III). Plasma levels and dialysate removal rates of total ascorbic acid and plasma pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP) were measured at the end of each phase. During phase I, plasma ascorbic acid levels (normal, 45 to 57 mumol/L [0.8 to 1.0 mg/dL]) declined slightly from 74 +/- 11 mumol/L (1.3 +/- 0.2 mg/dL) to 62 +/- 11 mumol/L (1.1 +/- 0.2 mg/dL) (P less than 0.02) at the end of the third week, and then remained stable to the end of the fourth week. Plasma ascorbic acid levels were no different in patients with or without residual renal function. With the addition of vitamin C supplements, plasma ascorbic acid levels increased by 45% of the baseline value at the end of phases II (P less than 0.001). The dialysate removal rate of ascorbic acid was 0.28 +/- 0.03 mmol/d (50 +/- 6 mg/d) at the end of phase I, and increased by 57% of the baseline value at the end of phases II (P less than 0.001). However, the peritoneal clearance of ascorbic acid remained unchanged during all phases the study.

Patient survival was 92% at 1 year, 80% at 2 years, and 55% at 4 years, while technique survival was 85% at 1 year, 74% at 2 years, and 47% at 4 years.

Both patient age (P = 0.001) and CVD (P = 0.03) had a significant impact on patient survival. On the average, for every 10 years' increase in age, the risk of death increased by a factor of 1.71. Patients with CVD had a risk of death 2.57 times higher than the risk of death among patients without CVD. With respect to technique or method survival, black patients had a risk of changing treatment 2.24 times higher than that for white patients. Our patient and technique survivals are similar to that reported in the national CAPD registry over a comparable period (1981 to 1988).\r"

Segments of the 3' untranslated regions are amplified, and polymorphisms are detected by digestion with frequently cutting enzymes and with the detection of single-stranded conformation polymorphisms. This allows these genes, or DNA segments, to be placed on the linkage maps of human chromosomes. Polymorphisms in two genes have been identified using this approach. A HaeIII polymorphism was detected in the KIT proto-oncogene, physically assigned to chromosome 4q11-12. This polymorphism is linked to other chromosome 4p markers and is in linkage disequilibrium with a HindIII polymorphism previously described at this locus. We have also identified in the insulin-like growth factor1 receptor gene (IGF1R) a 2-bp deletion that is present at a frequency of .25 in the Caucasian population. Pedigree analysis with this insertion/deletion polymorphism placed the IGF1R gene at the end of the current linkage map of chromosome 15q, consistent with the physical assignment of 15q2526. Thus, polymorphisms in specific genes can be used to related the physical, genetic, and comparative maps of mammalian genomes and to simplify the testing of candidate genes for human diseases.\r"

These probes were constructed as chromosome-specific libraries in Bluescribe plasmids and are designated pBS-13, pBS-18, and pBS-21. Elements of these probes bind at numerous sites along the target chromosome and, when detected fluorescently, stain essentially the entire long arm of the target chromosome. The target chromosome number (i.e., the number of chromosomes of the type for which the probe was specific) was correctly determined in 20 of 20 samples in which metaphase spreads were analyzed and in 43 of 43 samples in which interphase nuclei were analyzed; all of these studies were conducted in blind fashion. These results suggest the utility of FISH with composite probes for rapid detection of numerical aberrations in metaphase and interphase amniotic cells.\r"

  ".W": "Mitotic crossing-over does occur in man and is much more frequent and important than generally assumed. Its postzygotic occurrence before an embryo differentiates into MZ twins is theoretically predicted to have disrupting effects on genomic imprinting and cis-acting sequences, with consequences ranging from early lethality to MZ twin discordance. Some predictions are at odds with classical views on twinning and include a high discordance rate of MZ twins for some genetic diseases. A review of MZ twin discordance and an attempt at explaining some of the data lead one to hypothesize both the existence of a sex differences in the rate of mitotic crossing-over and the impossibility for crossed X chromosomes to undergo inactivation. The close interrelationship of twinning and midline malformations further suggests a major role of mitotic crossing-over in the induction of the twinning process itself. The model can be tested with molecular methods and provides a new approach for the gene mapping of so-called multifactorial diseases and of rarer disorders with apparently irregular inheritance.\r"

The second set included 22 polymorphic genetic systems (26 loci) with various numbers of populations (ranging from 21 to 51) for each system. Therefore, each system was studied separately. Nei's standard genetic distance (D) matrices obtained for these two sets of data were tested against design matrices specifying hypotheses concerning the affiliations of the tested populations. The tests against single designs were carried out by means of Mantel tests. Our results consistently show lower distances among J populations than with their NJ neighbors, most simply explained by the common origin of the former. Yet, there is evidence also of genetic similarity between J and corresponding NJ populations, suggesting reciprocal gene flow between these populations or convergent selection in a common environment. The results of our study also indicate that stochastic factors are likely to have played a role in masking the descent relationships of the J populations.\r"

  ".W": "Isovaleric acidemia (IVA) is an inborn error of leucine metabolism and is caused by a genetically determined deficiency of isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IVD), a mitochondrial matrix enzyme. IVD is produced as a 45-kDa precursor and then is transported into the mitochondria, where it is processed to its mature 43-kDa size. Previous [35S]methionine-labeling studies of fibroblasts from IVA patients have revealed at least five classes of mutations within the IVD gene. In size, IVD precursor and mature proteins produced by class I mutants are indistinguishable from their normal counterparts. Class II, III, and IV mutants make IVD precursor proteins which are 23 kDa smaller than normal. Subsequent processing in class III and IV mutants is normal but proceeds inefficiently in class II mutants. Class V mutants make no detectable IVD protein. In order to further study these mutations at the molecular level, the IVD coding region from mutant fibroblast cDNA was amplified by the PCR and was analyzed by DNA sequencing. cDNA from class I mutant alleles from two of seven class I mutant cell lines each contained a different missense mutation. In cDNA from a class III mutant, a single base deletion at position 1179 of the coding region was identified which leads to a shift in reading frame, predicting the incorporation of eight abnormal amino acids followed by a premature termination codon. Sequencing of amplified IVD cDNA from a type V mutant has failed to identify any abnormalities. It most probably is deficient in translation of the IVD mRNA. A new class of IVD mutant allele which appears to be transcriptionally defective (type VI) was also identified. Additional study of this set of IVD mutations should add both to our knowledge of the biosynthetic pathway of mitochondrial proteins and to our understanding of the clinical heterogeneity seen in IVA.\r"

Cloned Hp2 DNA from an individual with the Hp2-1mod phenotype is here shown to have a C in place of the normal A at nucleotide position -61 in one of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) responsive elements of the haptoglobin promoter region. Direct sequencing of the haptoglobin promoter region, amplified by PCR, from DNA from unrelated American blacks showed a C at -61 in all of 10 individuals with the Hp2-1mod phenotype, in two of four with a \"possible Hp2-1mod\" phenotype, but in none of 15 with the Hp2-1 phenotype. Thus the -61C mutation in the Hp2-61C allele is strongly associated with the Hp2-1mod phenotype. Sequencing results also show that there are three other promoter sequences in the population studied; each can be associated with either Hp2 or Hp1. The variability seen in the Hp2-1mod phenotype, a variability which ranges from close to Hp2-1 to close to Hp1-1, can be explained, in part, by the existence of several Hp2 alleles differing in their promoters--and possibly, in part, by differences in the promoters of the accompanying Hp1 allele. A further part of the variability may be the consequence of differences in the way that the Hp2-61C and the Hp2 alleles respond to the IL-6-dependent factor during an acute-phase response.\r"

The four homozygotes described to date with this disorder have remarkably distinct phenotypes, ranging from a severely affected infant with failure to thrive to an essentially asymptomatic 68-year-old male. To investigate the molecular nature of the lesions causing the severe infantile-onset form, total RNA was isolated from cultured lymphoblasts of the affected homozygote, RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA, and the 990-bp ALA-D-coding region was amplified by the PCR. Heterozygosity for an RsaI RFLP within the ALA-dehydratase-coding region permitted identification of the paternal and maternal mutant alleles prior to sequencing. The maternal mutation (designated G133R), a G-to-A transition of nucleotide 397, predicted a glycine-to-arginine substitution at residue 133 at the carboxyl end of the highly conserved zinc-binding site in the enzyme subunit. The G133R mutation created a PstI site and permitted the confirmation and rapid detection of this lesion in amplified genomic DNA from maternal relatives. The paternal mutation, a G-to-A transition of nucleotide 823, predicted a valine-to-methionine substitution of residue 275 (designated V275M). This mutation was confirmed in genomic DNA from family members by the competitive PCR technique. Both missense mutations, which occurred at CpG dinucleotides, resulted in the synthesis of enzyme subunits such that the activity of the homooctameric enzyme was markedly reduced, thereby causing the severe infantile-onset phenotype in the affected homozygote.\r"

  ".W": "mRNA from a postmortem liver sample of a patient with classical phenylketonuria was examined using the chemical cleavage of mismatch (CCM) method to search for mutations in phenylalanine hydroxylase. Initial screening identified a heterozygous alteration in exon 2 which changed the encoded amino acid from phenylalanine (TTC) to leucine (TTG) at codon 39 and a polymorphism at codon 430 where the change from CTG to CTC did not alter the encoded leucine. Use of the CCM technique also revealed that the control reference clone differed from the published sequence by having a substitution of isoleucine (ATT) for methionine (ATG) at codon 276 and CAA rather than CAG as the codon for glutamine 232. By using the mRNA from the patient instead of the control as the source for the radiolabeled probe for the CCM technique, a second previously undetected alteration was identified in exon 10 where the change from TCA to CCA at codon 349 altered the amino acid from serine to arginine. Judicious choice of probes gives the CCM method the potential to detect close to 100% of single base mutations.\r"

  ".W": "We studied three large kindreds with the HLA-linked form of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA1) in order to localize the SCA1 locus on the short arm of chromosome 6 (6p). Two loci containing highly informative dinucleotide repeat sequences were used for linkage analysis. These two loci are D6S89, which is telomeric to the HLA region, and T complex-associated testes-expressed 1 (TCTE1), centromeric to HLA. Pairwise linkage analysis of SCA1 and D6S89 revealed a maximum lod score of 5.86 in the Houston SCA1 (HSCA1) kindred and of 8.08 in the Calabrian SCA1 (SCA1) kindreds, at recombination fractions of .050 and .022, respectively. A maximum pairwise lod score of 4.54 at a recombination frequency of .100 was obtained for SCA1 and TCTE1 in the HSCA1 kindred. No evidence for linkage was detected between TCTE1 and SCA1 in the CSCA1 kindreds. Multilocus linkage analysis of SCA1, HLA, and D6S89 in all three kindreds provided strong evidence for localization of the SCA1 locus telomeric to the HLA regions. However, multilocus linkage analysis of SCA1, HLA, and TCTE1 with HSCA1 family genotypes indicated the possibility of a location of the SCA1 locus centromeric to HLA. An analysis of HSCA1 recombinants in this region of chromosome 6 revealed relatively high recombination frequencies between HLA and each of the other two markers and relatively low frequencies between the latter and SCA1, predicting that the SCA1 locus would tend to segregate away from HLA together with D6S89 or TCTE1, as found with the three-point linkage analyses for this family.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In addition, our data strongly support the conclusion that SCA1 lies centromeric and genetically very close to the highly informative D6S89 marker within the 8-cM chromosomal segment flanked by the D6S88 and D6S89 markers.

The HLA molecule corresponding to the complementation of Arg52(+) and Asp57(-) has been recently proposed as explaining susceptibility to IDDM. However, this hypothesis does not account for the overall observations made on the HLA marker in IDDM patients and their relatives. The MASC method may also be applied to evaluate the risk for relatives of an affected individual (the \"index\"). For example, the risk for a sib depends not only on the parental status and on the number of HLA haplotypes he shares with the index, but also on which haplotype the index himself inherited from his mother and father.\r"

To address potential structure-function relationships for the various domains of dystrophin, we examined both the dystrophin gene and protein in 68 patients with abnormal dystrophin. Eighty-six percent of BMD patients with dystrophin of altered size have deletions or duplications, and the observed sizes of dystrophin fit well with predictions based on DNA data. Deletions within the amino-terminal domain I tended to result in low levels of dystrophin and a more severe phenotype. The phenotypes of patients with deletions or duplications in the central rod domain were more variable. This region can be divided into three portions based on differences in clinical presentations of patients. Deletions around exons 4553 were most common and generally caused typical BMD; however, phenotypic variability among patients with similar mutations suggests that epigenetic and/or environmental factors play an important role in determining the clinical progression. In contrast, deletions or duplications in the proximal portion of this domain tended to cause severe cramps and myalgia. Finally, loss of the middle of this region probably causes a very mild phenotype, as only one such patient was found and his only symptom was elevated serum creatine phosphokinase levels.\r"

The detection of linkage disequilibrium between DM and one of these markers (D19S63) is the first demonstration of this phenomenon in a heterogeneous DM population. The results suggest that at least 58% of DM patients in the British population, as well as those in a French-Canadian subpopulation, are descended from the same ancestral DM mutation. We discuss the implications of this finding in terms of strategies for cloning the DM gene, for a possible role in modification of risk for prenatal and presymptomatic testing, and we speculate on the origin and number of existing mutations which may result in a DM phenotype.\r"

Recombination events have been used to position the HD mutation with respect to genetic markers within this region, and one such event places the gene proximal to D4S168, excluding the distal gap as a possible location for the defect. One previously published recombination event appeared to have excluded the proximal gap.

The methodology is not restricted to genetic illnesses and can be applied to more complex illnesses with unknown etiology. We present an example for Huntington disease, which is generally assumed to be a Mendelian autosomal dominant disease, yielding estimates of lifetime risk of .503 +/- .70 and mean onset age of 47.7 +/- 3.1 years for offspring with a single affected parent.

Complex segregation analysis of 490 extended families was undertaken with liability classes defined by age, sex, and HBV infection status. The maximum-likelihood model suggests that a recessive allele with population frequency approximately .25 yields lifetime risk of PHC, in the presence of both HBV infection and genetic susceptibility, of .84 for males and .46 for females. The model further predicts that, in the absence of genetic susceptibility, lifetime risk of PHC is .09 for HBV-infected males and .01 for HBV-infected females and that, regardless of genotype, it is virtually zero for uninfected persons. Complex segregation analysis therefore provides evidence for the interaction of genotype, environmental exposure, sex and age in determining the occurrence of PHC in this population.\r"

SBP was measured in 1,266 Caucasian individuals in 278 pedigrees ascertained through children enrolled in the Rochester, MN, school system. The sample included 646 males and 620 females 550 years of age and not taking antihypertensive medication or oral contraceptives. Complex segregation analysis was first applied to these data by using a regression model for age, in which the intercept was gender and ousiotype specific but in which the slope was only gender specific. When the slope was independent of ousiotype, neither variation at a single gene combined with polygenic effects (mixed genetic model) nor variation in a single environmental factor combined with polygenetic effects (mixed environmental model) explained the distribution of SBP in this sample. However, when the regression model for age allowed both the intercept and slope to be gender and ousiotype specific, the mixed environmental model was rejected whereas the mixed genetic model was not. These results suggest that variability in SBP may be influenced by major effects of allelic variation at a single gene that are both gender and age dependent. This study (1) suggests that particular genotypes determined by a single gene are associated with a steeper increase of SBP with age among males and females 550 years of age in the general population and (2) illustrates the need to consider models that more realistically represent the relationship between genotypic variability and phenotypic variability, to understand the genetics of human quantitative traits.\r"

  ".U": "91290072\r", 
  ".W": "We have developed an instrument that measures force development during clot retraction. Clots are formed between an aluminum plate and cup. The plate is coupled to a strain gauge transducer. Force generated by platelets is transmitted to the upper plate and the resulting voltage change is recorded. Calibration using standard weights allows conversion of the voltage signal to dynes/cm2. Study parameters include lag phase prior to force development, maximum rate of force development (MRFD), and maximum force generated (MFG). When controlled for platelet count, ionic strength (0.15), pH (7.4), calcium concentration (10mM), thrombin concentration (1.5 u/ml), temperature, and gap distance (1 mm), measurements are reproducible. Control of each variable is critical since clot retraction depends on platelet function and fibrin structure. At 37 degrees C and 26 x 10(3) platelets/microL, the lag phase was 300 seconds, the MRFD was 0.69 dynes/(cm2 sec), and the force at 1000 seconds (MFG) was 2450 dynes. At 7.5 x 10(4) platelets/microL, the lag phase was 160 seconds, the MRFD was 1.06 dyne/(cm2 sec), and the MFG was 4400 dynes. Decreasing the sample temperature from 37 degrees C to 27 degrees C (75 x 10(3) platelets/microL) increases the lag phase from 170 to 300 seconds, decreases MRFD from 1.06 to 0.66 dynes/(cm2 sec), and decreases the MFG at 1000 seconds from 4,400 to 2,800 dynes. At 15 degrees C, retraction is totally inhibited. This instrument provides a simple way to quantify the impact of altered fibrin structure and platelet function on clot retraction. Measurement of force development during clot retraction may offer a new approach to the study of qualitative platelet dysfunction.\r"

Growth of the contralateral lung as well as its proliferative activity were measured 6 or 14 days later. Whereas the left lung underwent severe fibrosis and shrinkage with more than 85% reduction in lung volume, the right lung more than doubled in size. In addition, there was a significant increase in total protein content, DNA content, and DNA synthesis. We conclude that unilateral lung injury resulting in ipsilateral fibrosis and loss of parenchyma is associated with compensatory growth of the contralateral lung.\r"

In the red cell membrane, phosphatidylcholine (PC) and free cholesterol (FC) were increased, and the free cholesterol to phospholipid (FC/PL) ratio was elevated. Erythrocyte sodium transport was also increased, while intracellular sodium and potassium concentrations were normal. After therapy, the derangement of lipid levels and sodium transport activity were normalized with improvement of the hemolytic anemia. The shape of peripheral red cells also returned to normal after treatment. These findings suggest that the derangement of the red cell membrane lipids and plasma lipids derived from hypothyroidism can be a major cause of hemolysis in this patient.\r"

Advantages of aztreonam over the aminoglycosides include lack of ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity and better penetration into the CSF. Additional advantages include its use in penicillin and cephalosporin allergic patients. Disadvantages of aztreonam compared to the aminoglycosides include the cost of the drug (50 times more expensive than gentamicin), the lack of post antibiotic effect, resistance to P. aeruginosa, and lack of significant activity against Enterobacter cloacae and E. aerogenes. There are insufficient clinical trials to document the superiority of aztreonam over the \"gold standard\" therapy for gram-negative infections--the aminoglycosides. The restricted anti-microbial spectrum of aztreonam has been proposed as an advantage. Theoretically, this would permit targeting of a gram-negative pathogen with minimal disruption of the (largely anaerobic) intestinal flora. In fact, use of this drug has been associated with colonization of gram-positive organism, especially enterococci. Although aztreonam appears to be an excellent antibiotic, its use has been limited by its relatively high cost, narrow spectrum of activity, and the availability of numerous alternative agents.\r"

The major endogenous mediator of SS is tumor necrosis factor, and interleukins-1 and -2 may also contribute. Important secondary phenomena include release of platelet activating factor, vasodilator prostaglandins, and upregulation of adhesion molecules on polymorphonuclear leukocytes and endothelial cells.

Postoperative thyroid status was determined by serum free thyroxine (T4), free triiodothyronine (T3), and thyrotropin (TSH) levels in the first period (1 year after surgery), second period (3.9 +/- 1.0 years), and third period (8.8 +/- 1.5 years). Serum thyroid stimulating antibody (TSAb) and TSH binding inhibitor immunoglobulin (TBII) activities were also measured. A total of 53 patients (79%) changed thyroid status during the observation period. One year after surgery, 50 percent of euthyroid subjects developed abnormal thyroid function in the next period. Reversible latent hypothyroidism was the most common type of thyroid dysfunction seen in up to 46% of patients. Interestingly, hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism that developed in the postoperative period were temporary disorders in most cases. Serum TSAb and TBII activities did not help predict the postoperative changes of thyroid status. Our study indicates that the instability of the thyroid function is common after subtotal thyroidectomy.\r"

Resistance to hepatic disease developed gradually with age, with full expression at approximately 10 weeks in the WF.LEW and LEW rat strains. The ZH501 strain caused fatal hepatitis in WF rats regardless of age. However, resistance to the SA75 RVFV strain (relatively non-pathogenic for adult rats), was age- and dose-dependent in both WF and LEW rats. The resistance gene transferred to the newly derived WF.LEW congenic rat strain appears to amplify age-dependent resistance of adult rats, resulting in protection against fatal hepatic disease caused by the virulent ZH501 strain. The congenic rat strain will be a valuable asset in elucidating the mechanism of resistance to Rift Valley fever virus governed by the dominant Mendelian gene.\r"

Appearance of antibodies to E, NS3, and NS5 could be detected within five days after the onset of fever. These three dengue viral proteins and their corresponding antibodies may be involved in the immunopathologic mechanism underlying this disease. For diagnostic purposes, identifying the non-structural proteins such as NS3 and NS5 may be the best means for early confirmation of the disease.\r"

Type 1 dengue virus in the HL-CZ cell culture was identified by immunofluorescence tests using monoclonal antibodies, and also by hemagglutination tests with goose red blood cells. The density of the virus particles, as measured by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, ranged from 1.186 to 1.224 g/ml. The virus yield from this cell culture is comparable with that from the C6/36 mosquito cell line. There was a significant correlation between the antibody responses tested with Western dot blots and hemagglutination inhibition techniques.\r"

Microscopic examinations of the tissues revealed the presence of living and dead gravid female worms and male worms belonging to the genus Onchocerca. Unsheathed microfilariae presumed to be Onchocerca species were found in the skin as well. Because Onchocerca species are not natural parasites of dogs, it is presumed that this infection was acquired accidentally from bovine, equine, or other animal host sharing the environment.

Microfilarial (mf) density and serum levels of W. bancrofti phosphorylcholine-containing antigen (PC-Ag) in individuals were used as indirect measures of adult worm burden. These parasitological data were collected from 126 subjects greater than 4 years of age at two time points, 12 months apart, prior to the administration of the antifilarial drug diethylcambamazine (DEC). No significant changes in levels of mf density were observed for the study population between these two time points. However, significant changes in the levels of circulating PC-Ag were noted in subjects less than or equal to 20 years of age, but not in subjects greater than 20 years of age, between these two time points. The apparent shorter half life of circulating PC-Ag compared to that of mf makes antigenemia a more sensitive measure of the dynamics of adult worm populations. These data are discussed in terms of a basic mathematical model describing the dynamics of adult worm populations in relation to their life expectancy and attrition of larvae during establishment. Consideration of these data in the context of this simple immigration/death model suggests that the differences observed in patterns of change in intensity of infection between subjects less than or equal to 20 years old and those greater than 20 years old may be consistent with the acquisition of resistance to superinfection with increasing age.\r"

  ".W": "An Mr 200,000 phosphorylcholine-containing antigen (PC-Ag) of predominantly adult worm origin was found in the sera of humans infected with Wuchereria bancrofti. This paper describes results of a longitudinal study of changes in levels of PC-Ag in response to diethylcarbamazine (DEC) therapy as measured by two-site immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) and Western blotting. One hundred thirty-two residents of a bancroftian filariasis-endemic area of Papua New Guinea (PNG) were treated with a 72 mg/kg dose of DEC. A macrofilaricidal effect was seen with this dose of DEC as 34% of the treated subjects had localized side effects and long-term decreases in microfilariae (mf) counts were observed 12 months after treatment. The PC-Ag levels were reduced to 72%, 52%, and 51% of pretreatment values at 21 days and at six and 12 months after treatment. These decreases, observed by IRMA, were specifically associated with loss of the Mr 200,000 PC-Ag detected by immunoadsorption and Western blotting. From drug treatment data, the maximum half-life of PC-Ag in circulation was calculated to be 50 days, assuming a first-order decay process. This maximum half-life indicates that persistent antigenemia observed in the majority of treated subjects could only result from the survival of adult worms. In the absence of methods to directly demonstrate W. bancrofti adult worms, detection of serum PC-Ag levels provides a sensitive indirect measure of the dynamics of adult worm populations. This serological measurement may be useful in optimizing the macrofilaricidal and therapeutic effects of DEC and in assessing the macrofilaricidal action of new antifilarial drugs and immunological interventions.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred fourteen Leishmania isolates from patients with different clinical forms of leishmaniasis in the State of Bahia, Brazil, were characterized by indirect radioimmune binding assay using specific monoclonal antibodies (serodeme analysis). Seventy-five of these isolates were also analyzed by enzyme electrophoresis, based on 11 enzyme loci; parasite species were compared, according to their characteristic zymodemes, to those of WHO Leishmania reference strains. All isolates could be classified into one of three species: Leishmania amazonensis (n = 40), L. braziliensis (n = 39) or L. chagasi (n = 35). The most interesting information obtained from this study is the realization that L. amazonensis is capable of producing a wide spectrum of disease in humans. Infection with this parasite was associated with many different clinical presentations, including cutaneous leishmaniasis [CL] (20/49 cases), mucocutaneous leishmaniasis [MCL] (5/13 cases) and, of special note, visceral leishmaniasis [VL] (11/46 cases), as well as four cases of post kalaazar dermal leishmaniasis [PKDL]. In situ tissue parasite characterization, by immunoperoxidase assay and employing anti-L. amazonensis amastigote monoclonal antibodies, confirmed the infection with this species in two cases of CL, one case of DCL, one case of MCL and one case of PKDL. Our results also demonstrate the difficulty of parasite differentiation based on clinical grounds, since at least L. amazonensis infection can be associated with all types of leishmanial diseases, and different Leishmania species may be associated with indistinguishable clinical presentations. Since leishmanial parasites may vary in their biological behavior or in their response to treatment, it is important that their identification be made by reliable methods.\r"

An American working in the same village developed symptomatic P. vivax parasitemia despite chloroquine prophylaxis. Five days after therapy with 600 mg chloroquine base, the asexual parasitemia in the American increased 40-fold, but cleared after treatment with 1,500 mg chloroquine base. Serum samples were not available from many of the cases, but six local residents and the American had serum levels of chloroquine in excess of the ordinarily suppressive 15 ng/ml at the time of their asexual parasitemias (16-70 ng/ml). The weekly 300 mg base tablet of chloroquine, which has been the standard for prophylaxis against malaria for more than 40 years, was not effective against P. vivax in Arso PIR, Irian Jaya.\r"

Patterns of drug sensitivity to standard and new antimalarials were characterized by using an in vitro assay based on the inhibition of schizont maturation. In vitro levels of mefloquine sensitivity of isolates were correlated with clinical treatment failures. In vitro parasite resistance to mefloquine is defined as an inhibitory dose-50 value greater than 20 nM. For isolates collected prior to treatment, there was no significant difference in mefloquine sensitivity patterns between subsequent successes and failures, suggesting that mefloquine treatment failures could not be predicted based on in vitro sensitivity of pretreatment isolates. A series of paired isolates were collected both prior to treatment with mefloquine and after recrudescence. Recrudescent isolates showed significant decreases in sensitivity to mefloquine, WR 194965, enpiroline, and halofantrine; no significant changes in sensitivity to amodiaquine, qinghaosu, and pyrimethamine; and an increase in sensitivity to chloroquine.\r"

A total of 44.1% of 68 infected An. gambiae and 49.2% of 63 infected An. stephensi transmitted sporozoites in vitro. The GM number of sporozoites transmitted was 4.5 for An. gambiae and 5.4 for An. stephensi. Overall, 86.9% of the mosquitoes transmitted from one to 25 sporozoites, and only 6.6% transmitted over 100 sporozoites (maximum = 369). Sporozoite loads were not a useful predictor of potential sporozoite transmission. Despite higher sporozoite loads, the numbers of sporozoites transmitted in vitro by the experimentally infected mosquitoes were similar to estimates obtained, using the same techniques, for naturally infected An. gambiae in western Kenya. The low but highly variable numbers of sporozoites transmitted in vitro by mosquitoes used in malaria vaccine challenge studies appears to be a reasonable simulation of natural sporozoite transmission.\r"

Individuals chronically exposed to the risk of infection or non-immune subjects who contracted malaria during first visits to endemic areas were studied. Numbers of immunoglobulin-secreting cells (IgSC) were increased dependent upon ongoing parasitemia. Levels of IgG and the anti-DNA activity were also augmented in malarious individuals from the endemic area.

The overall cumulative patency rate was 51% with a 76% limb salvage rate at 12 months. All seven grafts performed onto a popliteal artery segment of less than 8 cm occluded in the early period. The status of crural and foot arteries and the number of collaterals did not correlate well with early patency. Limbs with no patent crural artery that were analyzed in the poor angiographic runoff group, according to our previously reported classification, demonstrated relatively higher patency rates than the other subgroups with poor runoff. In cases where angiography demonstrates a poor runoff for distal revascularization, popliteal bypass with occluded crural arteries might achieve acceptable patency rates.\r"

A significantly longer median function time of 22 weeks was found in patients who had had more than five previous access procedures (p less than 0.02). No other independent variable affecting shunt function time was identified. There were 84 complications (56 due to infection) and 2 deaths in the series. The infection rate was not improved by the use of perioperative antibiotics, with most infections occurring more than 6 weeks after insertion. Since the complication rate for Allen Brown shunts was no greater than that reported for subclavian catheters, and their function no less reliable than that reported for Quinton-Scribner shunts, the Allen Brown shunt is a useful option for short- and medium-term vascular access. It may also be useful for longer-term access in the patient in whom failure of multiple previous access procedures has occurred.\r"

Sphincterotomy is known to prevent gallstone formation in cholesterol-fed prairie dogs. Experiments were designed to determine whether the effect of sphincterotomy is a consequence of hepatic bile diversion, and whether bile diversion prevents the altered contractility. Following sham operation, surgical biliary enteric bypass, or sphincterotomy, prairie dogs were fed a high-cholesterol or a regular diet. Gallbladder muscle contractility and the presence of crystals and stones were determined. In sham-operated animals, the cholesterol diet induced a decrease in gallbladder muscle contractility and caused the formation of cholesterol gallstones. In animals with bile diversion and sphincterotomy, the effects of cholesterol feeding were reduced or prevented. Thus, these procedures may prevent stone formation by preventing a reduction in gallbladder contractility. Contractility was depressed in animals with bile diversion fed a regular diet, compared with animals with a sham operation fed a regular diet. The mechanism for this depression may differ from that induced by the cholesterol diet. Diversion, and perhaps sphincterotomy, impairs gallbladder filling. Thus, gallbladder muscle is not stretched and does not contract against a load. This could result in a \"disuse atrophy.\" If the results from our study apply to humans, sphincterotomy may reduce stone formation by preventing the effects of lithogenic bile on gallbladder muscle contractility and by enhancing the ability of the muscle to empty the lithogenic bile.\r"

In the current study, insulinopenic patients were defined as those who showed abnormally low insulinogenic indexes (less than 0.6) on the oral glucose tolerance test, compared with those in 22 normal volunteers (1.16 +/- 0.57, mean +/- SD). The insulinogenic index represents the ratio of the cumulative enhancement of immunoreactive insulin (IRI) to the glucose level (delta IRI/delta glucose). Surgical outcomes were studied retrospectively in 17 insulinopenic patients who underwent hepatic resections from January 1987 to July 1988. Six of 10 patients in the major hepatic resection group showed postoperative complications, 5 of whom experienced hepatic failure resulting in hospital death. By contrast, all seven patients in the minor resection group tolerated the operations. From August 1988, intraportal insulin was prospectively administered as a posthepatectomy management technique to nine patients, eight of whom were diagnosed as insulinopenic. These patients all tolerated major hepatic resections including four hepatic vascular exclusion procedures with veno-venous bypass. In conclusion, the current study indicates that insulinopenic patients are high-risk candidates for major hepatic resection and that intraportal insulin administration has a beneficial effect on the postoperative management of these patients.\r"

Patency of the endarterectomy was evaluated by completion arteriography in all instances. Follow-up was conducted after an intermediate postoperative period of 21 +/- 12.5 months in 69 sides by arteriography. A late follow-up was conducted at 55.4 +/- 11.2 months either by arteriography (in 45 sides) or by carotid duplex scanning (in 11 sides). Twenty-one patients with 23 endarterectomies died, only 1 of a cerebral event. Seven patients moved or refused study and five were lost to follow-up. Three recurrent stenoses and five carotid occlusions developed by the time of the intermediate follow-up. By the time of late follow-up, three additional patients developed recurrent stenoses. Our results suggest that recurrent stenosis continues to develop with a longer period of follow-up in patients undergoing venous patch angioplasty with carotid endarterectomy.\r"

Nineteen patients (10 men and 9 women aged 41 +/- 19 years) were monitored with arterial and Swan-Ganz catheters during positioning. Measurements were obtained in the supine and prone positions (1 minute, 3 minutes), and the jackknife position (1, 3, 5, and 10 minutes), as well as before and after adoption of the Lloyd-Davies position (1, 3, 5, and 10 minutes). Turning the patient from the supine position to the prone position resulted in a significant decrease in the cardiac index (CI). However, following head-down rotation, the CI increased and returned to the value seen in the supine position (p less than 0.05). Heart rate (HR) slowed and mean arterial pressure (MAP) increased in the prone jackknife position. We concluded that the extent of the changes in cardiac function presented no serious problems.\r"

  ".W": "Myocardial reperfusion injury may be due to biophysical changes (e.g., endothelial cell junctional separations), as well as biochemical mechanisms (e.g., oxygen free radical activity). Superoxide dismutase (SOD), a free radical scavenger, may be effective in reducing chemical injury. Fractions of hydroxyethyl starch (HES-Pz), a large macromolecule, have been shown to decrease microvascular permeability associated with reperfusion-induced biophysical alterations. A comparison of SOD to HES-Pz was performed using a canine model of 1-hour left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) clamping followed by 24 hours of reperfusion. Amounts of the test solution equal to 10% of the dog's blood volume were administered intraatrially to the animals just before release of the LAD clamp. Six dogs received Ringer's lactate, 7 were given 600,000 IU of SOD, 13 received 6% HES-Pz, and 9 were given SOD and HES-Pz. The ratio of infarct to area at risk was 20 +/- 3% in the control dogs receiving Ringer's lactate, 16 +/- 4% in animals receiving SOD alone (p = NS), 6 +/- 3% in dogs receiving HES-Pz alone (p less than 0.05), and 8 +/- 3% in dogs given a combination of SOD and HES-Pz (p less than 0.05). HES-Pz alone and with SOD significantly reduced reperfusion injury, although addition of SOD to HES-Pz did not have an additive effect. Appropriate-sized macromolecules may act by reducing ischemia-induced microvascular permeability.\r"

A vast majority (89%) of respondents preferred to review medical student transcripts that use grades rather than pass/fail evaluations. In addition, 83% would prefer to evaluate their own students with a grading system rather than a pass/fail mark. Eighty-one percent of program directors believed that the medical student's ability to compete for a residency position was adversely influenced by the pass/fail method of evaluation. Since program directors appear to be biased in favor of an evaluation system that provides them with more objective data, we conclude that the use of the pass/fail grading system puts the medical student at a disadvantage in competing for general surgery residency positions.\r"

An SOE consisting of four predetermined clinically oriented scenarios was administered to 23 second postgraduate year surgical residents. Each scenario had five to six questions, each with a specific marking scheme. Candidates were assessed by two examiners and scores were derived independently. Overall reliability (Cronbach's alpha) was 0.75. Inter-rater reliability was significant for each pair of examiners and each question (r = 0.78 to 0.91: p less than 0.0001). Criterion validity was measured by correlating SOE scores with multiple-choice examination (MCQ) and objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) scores. Correlations between the SOE and MCQ and OSCE were significant and fell into the moderate range (0.48 to 0.51). The results of this study show that the SOE is useful in the assessment of clinical knowledge and problem-solving abilities of the surgical resident. Overall and inter-rater reliabilities achieved exceed those of traditional oral examination formats.\r"

This may be a function of inadequate instruction, inadequate caution, or inexperience, or may represent an inherent flaw in laparoscopic exposure. The aim of this study was to identify several steps in laparoscopic exposure of the gallbladder, cystic duct, and Calot's triangle to minimize the risk of surgical disorientation and CBD injury. A review of the first 180 laparoscopic cholecystectomies from the author's series was performed. Maneuvers that provided optimal exposure of the critical anatomy were culled from the video record. These maneuvers were (1) routine use of a 30 degree forward oblique viewing telescope, (2) firm cephalic traction on the fundus of the gallbladder to reduce redundancy in the infundibulum of the gallbladder and best expose the cystic duct, (3) lateral traction on the infundibulum of the gallbladder to place the cystic duct perpendicular to the CBD, (4) dissection of the cystic duct at the infundibulum of the gallbladder, and (5) routine fluoroscopic cholangiography. If these steps do not provide the surgeon with comfortable anatomic orientation, the procedure should be converted to open cholecystectomy.\r"

It is based on the use of annular prostheses of Teflon placed around the outside of the anastomotic line using appropriate surgical instruments. This procedure leaves the blood supply to the bile duct intact, achieves hermetic apposition of epithelia, and prevents leakage of bile. It eliminates the use of intraductal splints, avoids retraction of scar tissue around the anastomotic zone, and increases or maintains the internal diameter of the biliary duct on the anastomotic line. The technique has been used in 33 patients with follow-up from 1 to 10 years. Excellent results were achieved in 32 patients, with 1 patient having a poor result. The average postoperative hospital stay was only 6 days.\r"

Early hydronephrosis, developing in the first postoperative year, occurs in 10% to 20% of patients; it usually runs a benign, self-limiting course. The incidence of delayed ureteral obstruction, which develops or persists after the first postoperative year, is unknown because it is asymptomatic in most cases. Although spontaneous resolution is possible, it seems that this late form is more likely to persist. The diagnosis of postoperative hydronephrosis is not an indication for urologic intervention. This should seldom be necessary; it should be reserved only for patients with evidence of worsening obstruction or deteriorating renal function. Early and particularly, delayed hydronephrosis seems to be a marker for present or impending graft complications, such as infection or false aneurysms. A prolonged follow-up is therefore mandatory whenever the diagnosis is established as it may improve long-term survival and limb salvage. The need for routine screening for this condition remains to be established. With the availability of noninvasive methods, such a task could be easily accomplished.\r"

Six of the nine patients did not have an elevation in the white blood cell count preoperatively. Two patients underwent diagnostic laparoscopy prior to exploration. In four cases, a perforated appendix was removed. Seven patients had persistent postoperative fever, while all nine had a significant lack of leukocytosis after surgery. Other than the absence of a preoperative increase in white blood cell count, the presenting characteristics of this group were similar to those expected in immunocompetent patients. However, concern for a possible opportunistic infection etiology and a desire to avoid operating on these patients resulted in an undue delay prior to exploration. The use of diagnostic laparoscopy aided in earlier and more accurate diagnosis. Despite persistent postoperative fever, appendectomy was performed in patients with AIDS/HIV infection without significant increase in morbidity and mortality.\r"

Potentially adverse electrophysiologic interactions between amiodarone and halothane were studied with the use of standard microelectrode techniques to record intracellular action potentials (APs) from excised canine Purkinje fibers. A second dog (support dog) was anesthetized and a femoral arteriovenous bypass circuit created in which arterial blood from the support dog superfused the Purkinje fiber in a tissue bath. The applicability of this model was established by first comparing the AP effects of halothane during blood perfusion with those in Tyrode's solution. Halothane reduced AP duration (APD; P less than 0.05) during Tyrode's solution superfusion and blood cross-perfusion. After the blood perfusion-Purkinje fiber model was validated, the interaction between halothane and amiodarone was studied using Purkinje fibers from dogs chronically treated with oral amiodarone, superfused with blood from chronically amiodarone-treated support dogs. Amiodarone reduced resting membrane potential and prolonged APD. Depression of AP amplitude and reduction of the maximum rate of increase of phase 0 of the AP (Vmax) by halothane (both P less than 0.05) suggested risk of conduction defects if halothane is administered to patients receiving chronic amiodarone therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Since alpha 2-adrenergic agonists have important effects on the adrenergic system that have recently been applied to the anesthetic setting, we investigated the effect of stimulation of alpha 2 adrenoceptors on epinephrine-induced arrhythmias in halothane-anesthetized dogs. The arrhythmogenic threshold for epinephrine was determined during halothane anesthesia in the presence of dexmedetomidine, a selective alpha 2 agonist, and L-medetomidine, a stereoisomer of medetomidine that lacks alpha 2-agonist activity. Dexmedetomidine increased the arrhythmogenic threshold for epinephrine in a dose-dependent manner during halothane anesthesia. At the highest dose of dexmedetomidine, 0.5 microgram.kg-1.min-1, there was a three-fold increase in both the arrhythmogenic dose of epinephrine and the plasma epinephrine concentration that was reached at this dose. On the other hand, L-medetomidine over the same dose range did not effect the arrhythmogenic dose of epinephrine. Atipamezole, a central alpha 2 antagonist that crossed the blood-brain barrier, blocked the antiarrhythmic action of dexmedetomidine. L-659,066 a peripheral alpha 2 antagonist that does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier, did not affect the antiarrhythmic action of dexmedetomidine. Thus, dexmedetomidine's antiarrhythmic effect on epinephrine-induced arrhythmias during halothane anesthesia appears to be mediated at least in part by stimulation of central alpha 2 adrenoceptors.\r"

Splenectomized mongrel dogs under general anesthesia were monitored with a three-wavelength pulmonary artery oximeter catheter (10 dogs) and a pulse oximeter (11 dogs). Data were collected while fractional inspired oxygen concentration (FIO2) was varied from 1.00 to 0.05 in seven steps. The dogs then underwent isovolemic hemodilution, and the FIO2 was again varied. This sequence continued until data no longer could be obtained. The accuracy of each device was assessed by determining the bias (the average difference between the continuous monitor oximeter and the bench oximeter) and the precision (the standard deviation of the difference). For the three-wavelength Oximetrix catheter (for hemoglobin oxygen saturation denoted here SoxO2), the overall bias (SoxO2 - SvO2) and precision were -0.7 +/- 8.6% for the 193 data points. The accuracy as assessed by bias and precision for SoxO2 was similar for hematocrits of 40-15%. (Bias +/- precision was 2.1 +/- 5.7% for hematocrits greater than 40%, and -1.1 +/- 7.5% for hematocrits of 15% to 19%). At hematocrits between 10 and 14%, the precision worsened to 12%, and for hematocrits less than 10% the bias +/- precision was -11.5 +/- 11.8%. The overall SpO2 accuracy was 0.2 +/- 7.6% for 178 points. The pulse oximeter's accuracy was similar, down to hematocrits of 10%. Below 10%, the bias and precision worsened to -5.4 +/- 18.8%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Since the two muscles (costal and crural) that constitute the diaphragm are separate and histologically different, their individual recovery pattern from neuromuscular blockade also may be different. Therefore, we studied the recovery of force and shortening in the in vivo diaphragm from atracurium-induced neuromuscular blockade in seven pentobarbital anesthetized dogs to assess segmental differences. Transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi), shortening of costal and crural segments, integrated electromyogram (EMG), and tidal volume (VT) were measured during spontaneous breathing. After atracurium had reduced VT to 30% of control, breathing parameters were followed until recovered to 90% of control values. In addition, force-frequency curves generated by supramaximal tetanic stimuli of the phrenic nerve were measured. Recovery times for tidal Pdi, tidal EMG, tidal shortening, low-frequency shortening, and twitch Pdi were twice as fast as for VT (40 +/- 4 min), reflecting a slower rate of recovery of accessory inspiratory muscles. High-frequency recovery was typically slower than that of VT. During tidal breathing and tetanic stimulation, costal and crural shortening recovered simultaneously. On the other hand, comparison between costal and crural by analysis of pressure-shortening relationships showed a segmental difference (crural shortened 30% more than costal at the same Pdi), which implied reduced afterload on the crural segment. However, since shortening and pressure were linearly related during paralysis and recovery, measurements of Pdi alone can accurately reflect changes in contractile mass when heterogeneity and afterload are controlled.\r"

However, at temperatures below 28 degrees C, the relationship of temperature to cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2) has not been well characterized. Accordingly, the relationship between brain temperature and CMRO2 was determined in eight dogs during cooling from 37 to 14 degrees C while the EEG was continuously monitored. Cardiopulmonary bypass was initiated and control measurements were made at 37 degrees C during anesthesia with nitrous oxide 50-60% inspired and morphine sulfate 2 mg.kg-1 intravenously (iv). Upon cooling to 27 degrees C, the nitrous oxide was discontinued and the morphine was antagonized with naloxone 2 mg iv. Measurements were repeated at 27, 22, 18, and 14 degrees C and in four dogs again at 37 degrees C after nitrous oxide 50-60% had been reestablished at 27 degrees C along with administration of morphine sulfate 2 mg.kg-1. For each temperature interval, the temperature coefficient (Q10) for CMRO2 was calculated (Q10 = CMRO2 at x degrees C divided by CMRO2 at [x - 10] degrees C). Between 37 and 27 degrees C the Q10 was 2.23, but between 27 and 14 degrees C the mean Q10 was doubled to 4.53. With rewarming to 37 degrees C, CBF and CMRO2 returned to control levels, and brain biopsies revealed a normal brain energy state. During cooling, the EEG developed burst suppression at or below 22 degrees C. With further cooling, the periods of suppression increased; however, burst activity continued in seven of eight dogs even at 14 degrees C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Its potency and duration of action are similar to those of bupivacaine but its therapeutic index may be greater. Since pregnancy enhances the cardiotoxicity of bupivacaine, the current study was devised to compare the toxicity of ropivacaine in chronically instrumented nonpregnant and pregnant ewes during continuous intravenous infusion of the drug at the rate of 0.5 mg.kg-1.min-1. In all animals, symptoms of local anesthetic toxicity occurred in the usual order--convulsions, hypotension, apnea, and circulatory collapse. There were no significant differences between the two groups of animals in the doses and plasma concentrations of ropivacaine associated with each toxic manifestations. For example, circulatory collapse occurred at a mean dose of 11.3 +/- 1.1 mg.kg-1 in nonpregnant and 12.4 +/- 0.9 mg.kg-1 in pregnant animals, with corresponding plasma concentrations of 7.3 +/- 0.3 and 9.6 +/- 2.1 micrograms.ml-1 (P = not significant). Protein binding of ropivacaine in the concentration range associated with toxic manifestations was similar in sera obtained from nonpregnant and pregnant ewes. In conclusion, ovine pregnancy does not enhance the systemic toxicity of ropivacaine, possibly because of an absence of gestation-related increase in the availability of free drug.\r"

  ".W": "There is no consensus as to the most appropriate monitor for detecting ischemia during carotid endarterectomy. Accordingly, simultaneous 16-channel continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) and somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) monitoring were performed in 64 normocapnic patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy and anesthetized with isoflurane or halothane-nitrous oxide (supplemented with fentanyl). Recordings were obtained before, during, and for 15 min after cross-clamping of the internal carotid artery. Internal shunt was not used in any patient, regardless of EEG and SSEP changes. Significant amplitude reduction in the cortical component of the primary negative peak (greater than 50%) in SSEP occurred in 6 patients, and an increase in central conduction time (CCT) (greater than 1 ms) occurred in 5 patients. Major EEG changes occurred in 6 patients, 4 of whom also had SSEP changes. Two patients had transient neurologic deficits postoperatively, with both having SSEP changes (amplitude reduction greater than 50%), whereas one had EEG changes. Based on these observations, the relative sensitivity and specificity for EEG and SSEP (amplitude reduction greater than 50%) in detecting postoperative neurologic deficits were 50% and 92% for EEG and 100% and 94% for SSEP, respectively, differences that were not statistically significant. Regarding SSEP, the use of latency change (CCT) as a criterion was associated with a sensitivity of 0% (P = 0.046 from sensitivity of amplitude) and a specificity of 87% (P = 0.17 from specificity of amplitude).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To determine the role of airway obstruction in postoperative apnea, we studied 74 former premature infants by integrated recordings of nasal airflow, pneumocardiography, and pulse oximetry during the initial 2 h of recovery from inhalational anesthesia. Apnea (greater than 6 s) was classified as central, obstructive, or mixed, wherein mixed apnea consisted of central and obstructive apnea within the same apneic episode. Postoperative apnea was observed in 23 infants, ranging in age from 31-48 weeks postconception: 12 had inguinal herniorrhaphy (hernia group) and 11 had other procedures (other group). Of the 268 apneic episodes in the hernia group, 73% were central, 6% obstructive, and 21% mixed. Infants in the other group had 505 apneic episodes, with a distribution nearly identical to that in the hernia group. Central and mixed apnea occurred in all infants experiencing apnea, except in 1 infant, who had only central apnea, whereas obstructive apnea occurred in only one third of the apneic infants. Arterial hemoglobin desaturation was significantly more frequent at the end of mixed and obstructive apnea than after central apnea (P less than 0.01). In both groups, arterial hemoglobin O2 saturation (SpO2) decreased to less than 80% in approximately 35% of mixed and obstructive apneic episodes, compared to approximately 5% of central apneic episodes. SpO2 remained greater than or equal to 90% in over 80% of central apneic episodes, compared to 40% of mixed and obstructive apneic episodes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The subsequent management of children with anemia was noted. During the preoperative examination the anesthesiologist completed a questionnaire and predicted the preoperative hemoglobin concentration based on the history and physical examination. The preoperative hemoglobin concentration was measured for all of the patients, but the results were withheld until after completion of the questionnaire. Documentation was complete in 2,649 patients, and these comprised the final study group. Fourteen patients (0.5%) were anemic (hemoglobin concentration less than 100 g/l), but of these, only 5 had been predicted to be anemic based on clinical examination. Seven of these 14 anemic patients were less than 1 yr of age. Only 2 of the anemic patients had surgery postponed, and 1 of these also had a respiratory infection. Forty-four patients were incorrectly predicted to be anemic (i.e., their actual hemoglobin concentration was greater than 100 g/l). We conclude that in our patients, anemia is rare but is more likely to occur in those less than 1 yr of age. The presence of mild degrees of anemia does not alter the decision to proceed with day surgery. The anesthesiologists participating in this study could not reliably detect anemia clinically.\r"

  ".W": "The peripheral vascular effects of thiopental 5 mg/kg and propofol 2.5 mg/kg were compared in five patients whose lungs were being ventilated and in whom a Jarvik-7 artificial heart had been implanted. The patients were monitored, using catheters that had been surgically inserted into the radial artery, the right and left atria, and the pulmonary artery. The Jarvik-7 settings were modified to render the artificial heart \"preload independent\" and to maintain cardiac output constant. Each patient received both drugs, with the interval between each drug ranging from 16 to 28 h. Hemodynamic parameters and catecholamine and atrial natriuretic peptide plasma concentrations were measured before drug administration and 5, 10, 15, 30, and 45 min later. Both drugs significantly decreased arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance index, pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), and right and left atrial pressures (RAP and LAP, respectively). However, propofol 2.5 mg/kg induced a significantly greater and more prolonged decrease in arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance index, and RAP than that after administration of thiopental 5 mg/kg (P less than 0.05). Five minutes after drug injection, mean arterial pressure decreased by 21% after thiopental and by 39% after propofol (P less than 0.01); systemic vascular resistance index decreased by 21% after thiopental and by 44% after propofol (P less than 0.05); RAP decreased by 20% after thiopental and by 50% after propofol (P less than 0.05); mean PAP decreased by 18% after thiopental and by 32% after propofol (P less than 0.09); and LAP decreased by 40% after thiopental and by 46% after propofol (P less than 0.2). With both drugs, atrial natriuretic peptide, norepinephrine, and epinephrine plasma concentrations remained stable throughout the study period. Because cardiac output was maintained constant throughout the study, these results suggest that propofol 2.5 mg/kg is a more potent vasodilator of venous and arterial beds than is thiopental 5 mg/kg.\r"

In this family, genetic linkage between RYR and MH genes was not demonstrable using the currently recommended limits of normal for the CHC test in the identification of MH-susceptible individuals. With CHC test threshold limits below those currently recommended, however, complete linkage between the RYR and MH genes was seen. Comparisons of CHC test results with genetic linkage studies will increase the diagnostic accuracy of both tests as well as generate new insights into the biology of MH.\r"

With the onset of CPB, CaI decreased from 1.14 +/- 0.02 to 0.91 +/- 0.03 mM, P less than 0.05) (n = 17), and then gradually returned to a normal value by the time of separation from CPB (0.98 +/- 0.01 mM). CaT, MgI, MgT, and total protein concentrations declined significantly upon initiation of CPB and remained depressed thereafter. PTH initially decreased upon initiation of CPB (from 50 +/- 8 to 24 +/- 9 pg/ml, n = 9, P less than 0.05), remained inappropriately decreased during the early phases of CPB, and then gradually increased to maximal concentrations in response to hypocalcemia (103 +/- 15 pg/ml) before emergence. Calcitriol concentrations (n = 8) were unchanged during surgery. Based on these initial results, which suggested an association between hypomagnesemia and the slow PTH response to hypocalcemia, measurements were repeated in 10 additional patients, to whom magnesium (Mg) (1 g MgSO4 in two separate intravenous doses) was administered. Mg administration neither altered the PTH response to ionized hypocalcemia nor hastened the return of CaI to normal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Therefore, this investigation evaluated commonly used myocardial oxygen demand formulas for clinical application. The study was performed on patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery (n = 62). Measurements of standard hemodynamics were obtained before and after induction of anesthesia, as well as during sternotomy and after surgery. Coronary blood flow was determined by the argon wash-in technique. In 15 patients, a left ventricular tip manometer was used to accurately assess the first derivative of left ventricular pressure time course. The following indices of left ventricular oxygen demand were calculated: 1) rate pressure product (RPP); 2) tension time index (TTI); 3) pressure work index (PWI) according to the methods of Rooke; and 4) additive parameter (Eg), according to the methods of Bretschneider. All hemodynamic indices of myocardial oxygen demand showed moderate correlation with myocardial oxygen uptake (MVO2) (RPP: r = 0.77; TTI: r = 0.79; PWI: r = 0.79; Eg: r = 0.71). On the average, PWI and Eg led to an underestimation of MVO2 in patients. The constants of the PWI and Eg formulas, which have been developed based on animal experiments, therefore are not directly applicable to clinical conditions. New constants have been derived for PWI by multiple linear regression analysis of the data in the current investigation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To determine the best concentration of bupivacaine for combined general-caudal anesthesia in children, 122 children aged 1-8 yr scheduled for outpatient inguinal herniorrhaphy were randomized to receive, in a double-blind fashion, caudal anesthesia with bupivacaine in one of six concentrations (0.125, 0.15, 0.175, 0.2, 0.225, or 0.25%). After incision, a programmed reduction in inspired halothane resulted, if tolerated by the subject, in an inspired halothane concentration of 0.5% 10 min after incision. End-tidal halothane concentration at hernia sac ligation for subjects receiving 0.175% bupivacaine (0.55 +/- 0.03%) was less than that for subjects receiving 0.15% bupivacaine (0.75 +/- 0.05%; P less than 0.05).

Children receiving greater than or equal to 0.2% bupivacaine tended to complain more of leg weakness after surgery; however, the difference did not reach statistical significance (39 of 67 vs. 16 of 47; P = 0.057). The incidence of complaints of leg weakness and paresthesia was positively correlated with bupivacaine concentration (r = 0.706; P = 0.05). Subjects receiving 0.125% bupivacaine had higher pain scores on arrival to the PACU than did those receiving 0.2% bupivacaine (P = 0.05); there were no other differences in pain scores.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although surgical concentrations of some anesthetic agents and severe hypothermia qualitatively alter the light reflex, confounding factors frequently present during postanesthetic recovery have not been specifically quantified. We therefore studied 12 volunteers to determine the effects of residual isoflurane concentrations and typical (mild) hypothermia on the human pupillary light reflex. Young, healthy volunteers were assigned to one of three treatments: 1) normothermic isoflurane-oxygen anesthesia; 2) isoflurane-oxygen anesthesia with 2.2 +/- 0.5 degree C central hypothermia; and 3) central hypothermia (1.6 +/- 0.3 degree C) without anesthesia, induced by internal jugular infusion of iced lactated Ringer's solution. In normothermic anesthetized volunteers, the amplitude of the light reflex was depressed 80-90% at end-tidal concentrations greater than 0.5% isoflurane: reflex (percent of control) = 14 - 67.log (percent isoflurane); r = -0.92. In the mildly hypothermic anesthetized volunteers, pupillary responses were not statistically different from those in anesthetized normothermic volunteers: reflex (percent of control) = 16 - 62.log (percent isoflurane); r = -0.97. Hypothermia alone did not alter the magnitude of the light reflex. Our data suggest that mild hypothermia does not depress the light reflex but that isoflurane reversibly depresses the light reflex in a dose-related manner.\r"

One or 2 MAC halothane was then added to the perfusate. In the absence of halothane, epithelium removal increased the sensitivity of the bronchial rings to ACh and 5HT but not to EFS. Addition of 1 or 2 MAC halothane to the bathing fluid of the rings with or without epithelium decreased the sensitivity of the rings to ACh and 5HT. One MAC halothane decreased the sensitivity of the rings with and without epithelium to EFS. The decrease in sensitivity caused by halothane was not significantly different in rings with or without epithelium for any method of stimulation. In the bronchial segments, relaxations evoked by 1 or 2 MAC were not different in segments with or without epithelium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To learn more about the site and mode of action of propofol, the authors anesthetized rats with urethane, and implanted a stimulating electrode in the perforant pathway and a recording electrode in the hippocampal dentate gyrus to measure evoked field responses. Catheters were placed in the jugular vein and carotid artery to measure blood pressure, take blood samples for measurement of blood gases, and inject drugs. Rat lungs were ventilated, and increasing doses of propofol or its 10% fat emulsion vehicle were administered. Over a dose range of 2.5-40 mg/kg, propofol had little effect on the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) or the field population spike (PS), suggesting no important actions on perforant pathway fibers or intrinsic granule cell excitability. With the use of various paired-pulse stimulation paradigms, it was demonstrated that propofol administration led to a dramatic decrease in granule cell excitability over interpulse intervals of 10-100 ms. The magnitude of this effect clearly was related to dose, and the effect was reversible with discontinuance of drug. The vehicle had marginal effects on granule cell excitability. These were significantly less than those produced by propofol. Transient reductions in blood pressure followed by transient increases to above baseline were observed after administration of propofol at most doses. Increased heart rates accompanied the slight increase in blood pressure. Except at the largest dose of propofol tested, cardiovascular measures had returned to near control levels by 8 min, when the evoked potentials were evaluated. Arterial blood gases showed little change throughout the study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Pre-and postoperative monitoring included continuous pulse oximetry, respiratory inductance plethysmography, and repeated arterial blood gas analysis. Postoperatively, visual analogue pain scores, somnolence scores, respiratory rate, and arterial blood gases were determined for 16 h. Preoperatively, episodes of apnea were common during sleep but were not associated with low hemoglobin oxygen saturation or increased arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2). During sleep, some otherwise normal patients had increased PaCO2, and 2 of 15 patients had episodes of hemoglobin oxygen saturation of less than 90%. Postoperatively, 1 and 2 h after arrival in the recovery room, patients who received morphine had lower pain scores than did those who received nalbuphine 10 or 20 mg (P less than 0.05). All 6 patients who received morphine had satisfactory analgesia. Two of 4 patients who received nalbuphine 10 mg and all 5 who received nalbuphine 20 mg were withdrawn from the study because of inadequate analgesia (morphine vs. nalbuphine 10 mg, not significant; morphine vs. nalbuphine 20 mg, P less than 0.01). Two patients who received morphine had persistently increased PaCO2 postoperatively. Two patients who received morphine had episodes of apnea and slow respiratory rate, which were most frequent 6 h after arrival in the recovery room. We conclude that lumbar epidural nalbuphine does not provide adequate analgesia after thoracotomy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, neurotoxicity studies are required before these agents can be considered safe for clinical use. The aim of this study was to evaluate by histologic and blood-brain barrier (BBB) studies whether ketamine or midazolam could be used as an alternative to local anesthetics or opioids to produce spinal analgesia. Forty white New Zealand rabbits were randomly assigned to four groups of 10. In the conscious animal, 0.3 ml 0.9% saline solution, 1% lidocaine, 1% ketamine, or 0.1% midazolam was intrathecally injected intracisternally using a modification of the technique of Yaksh et al. Light and fluorescence microscopy were performed on transverse spinal cord sections by a neuropathologist unaware of the administered agents. All spinal cord section slides were scored within four zones: upper cervical, lower cervical, median thoracic, and lumbar segments. Spinal cord homogeneous lesions with higher scores than those of lidocaine-treated animals were considered abnormal. The BBB study showed evidence of neurotoxicity for ketamine, whereas light microscopy indicated no significant differences in comparison with saline and lidocaine. Midazolam-treated rabbits showed significant changes in both BBB and light microscopy studies. In view of these results, the intrathecal use of midazolam should be avoided in humans. Lesions observed following ketamine suggest the need for further experimental studies of the solvent and different ketamine enantiomers to establish definitively the safety of intrathecal free ketamine in humans.\r"

The authors determined the effects of halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane on automaticity and recovery of automaticity from overdrive suppression in canine Purkinje fibers derived from normal hearts. Purkinje fibers were superfused with a modified Krebs' solution (37 degrees C) containing epinephrine (2 or 15 microM) and equilibrated with a 97% O2-3% CO2 gas mixture (control). Transmembrane action potentials (AP) were recorded using standard microelectrode techniques. Purkinje fibers were then exposed to anesthetics at vaporizer settings of 0.75 or 1.5% (halothane), 1.75 or 3.5% (enflurane), and 1 or 2% (isoflurane), which were equivalent to measured superfusate concentrations of 0.22 or 0.47 mM (halothane), 0.44 or 0.94 mM (enflurane), and 0.28 or 0.53 mM (isoflurane). Compared to control, there was no significant effect of either concentration of the anesthetics on upstroke (phase 0) depolarization, AP amplitude or duration (50% repolarization), or maximum diastolic potential. All three anesthetics increased spontaneous rate. The increase in rate with all three anesthetics was due to enhanced diastolic depolarization (rate dV/dt, phase-4 depolarization). Recovery times from overdrive suppression were determined after 30 or 60 s of pacing at drive cycle lengths of 800, 500, and 400 ms and only at higher anesthetic concentrations. Recovery of automaticity was shortened by halothane only in slowly paced fibers exposed to the lower concentration of epinephrine. Under all other conditions recovery times were not affected by halothane.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "STUDY PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of adenosine in the treatment of emergency department patients with spontaneous paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). DESIGN: An eight-month prospective outcome study. POPULATION: Patients 16 or more years old with PSVT by surface ECG criteria. Patients were excluded if there was clinical or hemodynamic evidence of hypoperfusion. MEASUREMENTS: Patient age, sex, PSVT rate, pretreatment blood pressure, history of cardiac disease, chronic drug therapy, and response to IV adenosine. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients with 27 episodes of suspected PSVT met inclusion criteria. After IV adenosine, two patients were found to have atrial flutter, and one was found to have ventricular tachycardia. Twenty-four episodes of PSVT were diagnosed in the remaining 21 patients. There were eight male and 13 female patients with a mean age of 51 +/- 19 years (range, 16 to 80 years). Sixteen patients related a history of cardiovascular disease. The mean QRS rate during PSVT was 181 +/- 23. Twenty-three of 24 episodes (96%) were converted to sinus rhythm within 20 to 45 seconds of adenosine therapy. However, 13 of 23 of initial conversions (57%) were followed by recurrence of PSVT within five minutes. All 13 recurrences required therapy with other antiarrhythmic drugs for conversion to and maintenance of sinus rhythm. Complications of adenosine were noted in only four patients and were transient and clinically unimportant. CONCLUSION: IV adenosine effectively terminates PSVT in ED patients with spontaneous PSVT; recurrence of PSVT after adenosine is common in the ED population and should be treated with other antiarrhythmic agents, not repeated doses of adenosine; adenosine is useful in the differential diagnosis of tachyarrhythmias; and doubling the initial dose of adenosine to 12 mg would increase the likelihood of conversion with the first dose.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective case series. SETTING: A university hospital emergency department during 1987 through 1989. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-nine adult victims of nontraumatic cardiac arrest. INTERVENTIONS: At the discretion of the treating physician, patients received epinephrine in bolus doses ranging from 1 to 15 mg. HDE was defined as a dose of at least 0.2 mg/kg; smaller doses were defined as SDE. Patients were grouped as +RSC if they developed a sustained spontaneous palpable pulse or blood pressure and as -RSC if they did not develop a pulse or blood pressure. MEASUREMENTS: Patients were grouped as +RSC if they developed a sustained spontaneous palpable pulse or blood pressure and as -RSC if they did not develop a pulse or blood pressure. Patients were also grouped by their presenting rhythm. Potentially perfusing rhythm was electromechanical dissociation or ventricular tachycardia. Nonperfusing rhythm was asystole or ventricular fibrillation. Rates were analyzed using the Fisher exact test and the two-tailed unpaired t test. HDE improved the rate of initial resuscitation (P = .008). The effect was greatest in patients with nonperfusing rhythms (P = .014) and disappeared when evaluating patients with potentially perfusing rhythms. No patient survived to hospital discharge. CONCLUSION: High-dose epinephrine improves initial resuscitation rates in human victims of cardiac arrest. Its greatest effect is in patients with a nonperfusing rhythm.\r"

DESIGN: Survey of stable ED walk-in patients in the triage area. SETTING: University of California Irvine Medical Center, an urban, 493-bed, noncounty, Level I teaching hospital treating 38,000 emergency patients annually. PARTICIPANTS: A quota of 1,000 consecutive patients derived from a representative selection of service days was included; 94% of eligible patients agreed to participate. Patients with obstetrical problems (more than 20 weeks' gestation) were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: Pretested health access survey, available in both Spanish and English, administered by investigator. RESULTS: Public aid/self-pay insurance status was significantly associated with routine use of the ED for care (P less than .003), income of less than $10,000 (P less than .0002), refusal of care by health provider (P less than .001), refusal of care at an ED (P less than .03), and delay in seeking health care (P less than .0002). Income of less than $10,000 was significantly associated with routine use of the ED for care (P less than .02), and delay in seeking health care (P less than .04). Statistical analysis done using chi 2 with continuity correction and with the binomial test for comparison of two proportions. CONCLUSION: Among stable ED walk-in patients surveyed at our facility, low-income individuals and those with public aid/self-pay insurance status were significantly more likely to use the ED as a routine source of health care, and more likely to delay in seeking needed health care, than higher income and fully insured individuals. These data should be useful to health policymakers in formulating rational, cost-effective strategies that improve access to early treatment and prevention.\r"

SETTING: Patients who visited the ED at a Swedish university hospital during the daytime on Monday through Friday during a four-week period and were expected to be discharged from the ED after their visit were included in the study. Other criteria for participation were the patients' mental and physical abilities to fill out a questionnaire. STUDY DESIGN: One hundred eighty-seven patients (110 women and 77 men) classified as orthopedic, gynecologic, internal medical, surgical, or neurologic patients evaluated their perception of the health care delivered in the ED by filling out a questionnaire after arrival and before discharge. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The perceptions of the care received were on average quite positive. This was supported indirectly by the fact that scored pain, strength, calmness, and despair changed in a positive direction during the ED stay. However, a pattern of varying satisfaction appeared when the patients were dichotomized into three groups according to how they had perceived their first information on arrival. Fourteen percent of the patients had received exact information, 20% were partly informed, and 66% had received no information about what was going to happen to them next. Those who received the most information at the time of arrival at the ED were more satisfied with the general treatment (P less than .05), respect (P less than .01), and attitude (P less than .05) later shown by the staff as well as with the information given later (P less than .05) than were the patients who had received no information at all on arrival. The general evaluation of the ED was more positively (P less than .001) scored by the patients who received the most information (they were more satisfied) compared with the other two groups. CONCLUSION: The information given to patients on arrival at the ED may be important to a positive perception of the care given during their stay.\r"

DESIGN: This was a retrospective study analyzing previously collected census and welfare check distribution data. SETTING: The data used in this study were obtained from the Hennepin County Medical Center, the Hennepin County jail and alcoholic receiving center, and Department of Economic Assistance. INTERVENTIONS: The daily census for the years 1986 through 1988 in the Hennepin County Medical Center emergency department, ED resuscitation room, pediatric ED, crisis intervention center, urgent care center, and alcoholic receiving center was obtained. The numbers of daily ambulance runs, nonelective hospital admissions, Hennepin County 911 calls, and Hennepin County jail admissions for the same years also were obtained. Means for each day of the month were computed across the 36 months of observation. These data were correlated with the number of days elapsed since the monthly issuance of the General Assistance, Aid to Families With Dependent Children, and Minnesota Supplemental Aid welfare checks. MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS: There were significant correlations between the number of days after distribution of the checks and the average values of the census of the alcoholic receiving center (r = -.96, P less than .00001), the ED (r = -.80, P less than .0001), ambulance runs (r = -.68, P less than .0001), 911 calls (r = -.45, P = .01), jail admissions (r = -.45, P = .01), nonelective hospital admissions (r = -.44, P = .01), and the crisis intervention center visits (r = -.39, P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that scheduling and staffing practices of various emergency service areas in Hennepin County reflect patient load variation associated with time of welfare check distribution. Systematic variation of time or amount of welfare could lead to improved distribution and reduction of emergency services demand.\r"

DESIGN: Observational, case-control study. SETTING: Urban ED. TYPE of PARTICIPANTS: A sample group of 325 adult, nongeriatric patients with minor illnesses was selected by screening all patients registering in the ED between 9:00 AM and 6:00 PM on 15 randomly selected weekdays. A patient was included in this study group if the chief complaint, method of arrival, and subsequent evaluation met predetermined criteria for minor illness. A comparison group (control) was composed of all ED patients (224) who presented during two randomly selected 24-hour periods that did not overlap with the times of study group enrollment. INTERVENTIONS: Sample group patients were interviewed concerning their socioeconomic backgrounds, reasons for using the ED, and perceptions of the urgency of their conditions. Comparison group patients' interviews were confined to the collection of demographic and socioeconomic information. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There were more men (P = .12), more self-pay patients (P = .017), and fewer Medicare patients (P less than .001) in the study group. There also was a strong trend toward higher income (P = .059) in the study group. The racial, marital, employment, and educational backgrounds of the two groups were similar. Eighty-two percent of the study group had no chronic illness, and only 36% reported a problem of more than three days' duration. Patients chose to use the ED because of its convenience (23.7%), the absence of previous provider relationships (22.1%), and the inability to make a prompt appointment with their regular provider (19.0%). Major differences existed between the reasons for which different demographic and socioeconomic groups chose ED care. Study group patients believed that less than 24 hours should elapse between the onset of their problem and the time at which they receive medical care. CONCLUSION: There are no major differences in ED use for minor illness patients from different racial, educational, and economic backgrounds. These patients tend to have a low frequency of chronic illness and often have no established health care provider. They choose the ED for its ease of access and the wide scope of care that can be delivered.\r"

DESIGN: Monte Carlo estimation of a mathematical model of cumulative risk. Eight scenarios were estimated for high versus low prevalence of HIV, no precautions versus universal precautions, and prevalence increasing to a steady state versus peaking and then declining. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: For high-prevalence areas, not using universal precautions, and assuming HIV seroprevalence increases to a steady-state level, the median estimate of cumulative risk of HIV infection over a 30-year career was 1.4% (90% of tolerance range, 0.2% to 14.0%); for low-prevalence emergency departments, the median was 0.1% (0.001% to 3.6%). Universal precautions with a presumed effectiveness of approximately 40% resulted in an approximate 30% decrease in risk. CONCLUSIONS: Although the per-exposure risk is small, the cumulative risk of HIV infection may be disproportionately large. The efficacy of universal precautions does not appear to be substantially diminished over time.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVES: After cardiac arrest, open-chest CPR (OCCPR) and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) have demonstrated higher resuscitation rates when compared individually with standard external CPR (SECPR). We compared all three techniques in a canine myocardial infarct ventricular fibrillation model. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-six mongrel dogs were block-randomized to receive SECPR and advanced life support (nine), CPB (nine), or OCCPR (eight). DESIGN AND INTERVENTIONS: All dogs received left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion followed by four minutes of ventricular fibrillation without CPR and eight minutes of Thumper CPR. At 12 minutes, dogs received one of three resuscitation techniques. After resuscitation, all animals received four hours of intensive care. Animals that were resuscitated had histochemical determination of ischemic and necrotic myocardial areas. MEASUREMENTS: Intravascular pressures were measured and coronary perfusion pressure was calculated during baseline, cardiac arrest, resuscitation, and postresuscitation periods. Percent necrotic myocardium, percent ischemic myocardium, and necrotic-to-ischemic ratios were determined for resuscitated animals. Epinephrine dosage and number of countershocks were determined for each group. MAIN RESULTS: Nine of nine CPB and six of nine OCCPR, compared with two of eight SECPR animals, were resuscitated (P less than .01). Three of nine CPB and OCCPR and two of eight SECPR dogs survived to four hours (P = NS). Coronary perfusion pressure two minutes after institution of technique was significantly higher with CPB (75 +/- 37 mm Hg) and OCCPR (56 +/- 31 mm Hg) than in SECPR animals (16 +/- 16 mm Hg, P less than .04). Epinephrine required for resuscitation was significantly less with CPB (0.10 +/- 0.02 mg/kg) than for SECPR (0.28 +/- 0.11 mg/kg, P less than .002). The ratio of necrotic to ischemic myocardium at four hours was significantly lower with CPB (0.15 +/- 0.31) and OCCPR (0.39 +/- 0.25) than for SECPR (1.16 +/- 0.31, P less than .02). CONCLUSION: OCCPR and CPB produce higher coronary perfusion pressures and improved resuscitation rates from ventricular fibrillation when compared with SECPR in this canine myocardial infarct cardiac arrest model. CPB and OCCPR yielded similar resuscitation results, although less epinephrine was required with CPB.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVES: Open-chest cardiac massage is an effective method of resuscitation if instituted within 15 minutes of normothermic cardiac arrest that has failed to respond to ongoing closed-chest CPR efforts. The usefulness of invasive forms of CPR after various periods of untreated cardiac arrest is less certain. This study was performed to determine the effectiveness of open-chest resuscitation after prolonged periods of untreated cardiac arrest. SETTING AND DESIGN: Prospective, controlled laboratory investigation using an animal model of cardiac arrest. Open-chest cardiac massage initially was compared to standard closed-chest compression CPR. The efficacy of open-chest CPR then was evaluated after ten and 40 minutes of untreated ventricular fibrillation. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Twenty mongrel dogs (24 +/- 1 kg). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: After 20 minutes of untreated ventricular fibrillation, open-chest resuscitation was significantly better than closed-chest efforts for the production of coronary perfusion pressure (58 +/- 14 vs 2 +/- 1 mm Hg; P less than .05) and initial resuscitation success (five of five vs one of five; P less than .03). Open-chest cardiac massage was equally effective for initial resuscitation if begun after ten or 20 minutes of untreated ventricular fibrillation (five of five vs five of five), but if untreated ventricular fibrillation continued for 40 minutes prior to instituting open-chest massage, no resuscitation benefit was found (none of five; P less than .005). There were marked differences in 24-hour survival depending on the length of time untreated cardiac arrest continued prior to instituting open-chest resuscitation efforts. After 20 minutes of ventricular fibrillation, initial resuscitation was successful with open-chest massage, but long-term survival was poor. CONCLUSION: Open-chest cardiac massage did not produce long-term survival if untreated cardiac arrest persisted for 20 or more minutes prior to invasive resuscitation efforts.\r"

MODEL: Chronically instrumented, conscious, unrestrained rats subjected to an LD50 dose (1.4 mg/100 g body wt) of IV cocaine. METHODS: Rapid injection of IV cocaine by IV vascular access port followed by injection of therapeutic study drugs. Outcome (survival vs death) with drug treatment was compared with a placebo group. PHARMACOLOGIC INTERVENTIONS: Normal saline placebo (0.2 mL/100 g), diazepam (0.5 mg/100 g), chlorpromazine (0.2 mg/100 g), propranolol (1.0 mg/100 g), labetalol (3.0 mg/100 g), or verapamil (0.1 mg/100 g) was given. There were ten rats in each treatment group. Allocation to treatment groups was nonrandomized. STATISTICAL METHODS: Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: IV injection of cocaine was followed by tonic-clonic seizure activity in all treatment groups. No study drug significantly improved survival compared with the placebo group. However, no animal treated with propranolol survived (P less than .05 vs saline control), and only one of ten animals treated with labetalol survived (P = .14 vs placebo group). CONCLUSION: In this conscious animal model subjected to an LD50 IV cocaine insult, chlorpromazine and diazepam, previously shown to be of value in other animal models, had no effect on survival. Verapamil also did not affect outcome. Outcome was adversely affected by treatment with beta-blocking agents.\r"

DESIGN: Serum levels achieved within 90 minutes of equivalent intraosseous (IO) and IV bolus dosing of ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and a combination of ampicillin and gentamicin were compared in the weanling pig. SUBJECTS: Twelve female weanling pigs were studied in the Animal Facilities Laboratory at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. INTERVENTIONS: Through a proximal tibial IO catheter, each anesthetized animal received one of the following: 50 mg/kg ceftriaxone, 50 mg/kg cefotaxime, or 300 mg/kg ampicillin followed immediately by 2.5 mg/kg gentamicin. Venous blood was obtained for antibiotic assay at 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 minutes after IO injection. The animals were allowed to recover, and, after a one-week washout period, each received the same antibiotic and dose as before through a peripheral IV. Levels were assayed at the same intervals and IO versus IV were compared. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Comparable serum levels of all four antibiotics were achieved by the two routes. Gentamicin levels were statistically indistinguishable IO versus IV at all assay intervals. Ampicillin and cefotaxime levels achieved by the two routes were equivalent within one hour of dosing. Serum levels of ceftriaxone after IO administration paralleled those after IV dosing but remained significantly lower at all time intervals. CONCLUSIONS: In the weanling pig model, the IO route was used to deliver serum levels of broad-spectrum antibiotics comparable to those attained after IV administration. The data support the use of standard parenteral doses for IO administration. To overcome potential avid protein binding of ceftriaxone in the bone marrow, we recommend using ceftriaxone at its highest recommended IO loading dose. Consistent with many other medications that have been similarly tested, these data indicate that initial or empiric antibiotic coverage in hypodynamic and shock states in infants and young children need not await the establishment of traditional IV access.\r"

DESIGN: Randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design, with each animal serving as its own control. SETTING: Laboratory investigation. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Seven female New Zealand White rabbits with a mean weight of 3.7 kg. INTERVENTIONS: Each animal was subjected to three experiments separated by a four-day period. After baseline measurements, the following interventions were undertaken: Control day, no treatment; placebo day, 10 mL/kg 0.9% normal saline solution IP; and treatment day, 10 mL/kg 5% dextrose solution IP. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Serial serum glucose levels were obtained. Compared with control and placebo, the mean absolute serum glucose value of the treatment group was significantly higher beginning at ten minutes after intervention and continuing until conclusion of the study at 30 minutes. For these time points, the mean increase in serum glucose levels (percent change) of the treatment group compared with the control group was as follows: ten minutes, 15.5 mg/dL (0.86 mmol/L) (11%), P less than .01; 15 minutes, 20.6 mg/dL (1.14 mmol/L) (14%), P less than .01; 20 minutes, 36.5 mg/dL (2.03 mmol/L) (26%), P less than .001; and 30 minutes, 34.7 mg/dL (1.93 mmol/L) (24%), P less than .001.

POPULATION: ED patients between 18 and 59 years old with injuries that met trauma center triage criteria or with nontrauma-related illness who had blood drawn for physician-requested laboratory tests and for whom an extra aliquot of blood was available for HIV antibody testing. METHODS: All serum samples were first tested for antibody to HIV by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. If positive, the specimen was retested. All repeatedly reactive specimens were analyzed by Western blot test. The treating physician completed a questionnaire regarding the patient's illness and risk factors for HIV infection after the patient's care was completed. RESULTS: Two of 100 major trauma patients (confidence interval, 0% to 5%) and seven of 100 nontrauma patients (confidence interval, 2% to 12%) had antibody to HIV. The seropositive rate by age and clinical group varied from 0% to 12.5%, with the highest rates in the 30- to 39-year-old group of nontrauma patients. The difference in proportions of seropositivity between the sexes was not statistically significant. Physicians obtained information regarding homosexual or bisexual behavior, IV drug use, and hemophilia from 52% of the nontrauma patients and only 17% of trauma patients. None of 30 trauma patients for whom data were available and only two of the 100 nontrauma patients gave a history of any high-risk behavior. CONCLUSION: Although the sampling technique we used has limitations, the prevalence of HIV infection in our noninner-city ED is similar to that recently reported from inner-city EDs. This is in contrast to previous reports of low rates of HIV infection among ED patients in nonurban settings. Physician assessment of risk factors was incomplete in the majority of our patients. Patients rarely acknowledged any high-risk behavior. It is essential that emergency health care workers take maximum diligence to prevent exposure to blood and other body fluids from all ED patients.\r"

When this is unsuccessful, there are no guidelines to help determine the optimum time at which to defibrillate after the administration of an alpha-adrenergic agonist. Previous studies have shown that the median frequency of the ventricular fibrillation ECG signal correlates with myocardial perfusion during CPR. We hypothesized that median frequency could predict the success of defibrillation and thus accurately determine the most appropriate time at which to defibrillate during ventricular fibrillation. STUDY POPULATION: Twenty-two mixed-breed swine weighing more than 15 kg were studied. METHODS: Ventricular fibrillation was induced electrically, and the ventricular fibrillation ECG signal was analyzed using fast Fourier analysis. After ten minutes of ventricular fibrillation, mechanical CPR was begun. After three minutes of CPR, the animals received one of three alpha-adrenergic agonists and CPR was continued. Defibrillation was attempted three and one-half minutes after drug administration. The average median frequency 20 seconds before defibrillation was calculated. Sensitivity and specificity of median frequency with respect to defibrillation success were determined. RESULTS: A median frequency of 9.14 Hz had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 92.31% in predicting the results of defibrillation in this model. CONCLUSION: The median frequency may serve as a valuable parameter to guide defibrillation therapy during ventricular fibrillation.\r"

The incidence appeared to decrease after 2 yr of exposure, and the estimated probability of development of symptoms was nearly 20% after 4 yr. A total of 105 subjects developed dyspnea and wheezing. Of 78 symptomatic subjects who were interviewed, 76% experienced improvement or absence of symptoms when off work. In 523 subjects who were assigned to specific levels of exposure at the end of follow-up, a dose-response gradient was found between the development of symptoms and fluoride exposure. Increased risk with increasing amounts of tobacco was also observed, but childhood allergy and a family history of asthma were not significantly related to the outcome variable. We conclude that both total fluoride exposure and smoking are related to asthmatic symptoms in potroom workers, and the suggestion of a dose-response gradient was found for both variables. However, a causal relationship between fluorides and symptoms should be investigated further by specific bronchial provocation testing and by research for specific antibodies and other immunologic markers.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the effects of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) upon respiratory resistance during mechanical ventilation in 21 subjects anesthetized for surgery (normal subjects) and in 11 patients with the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We measured tracheal pressure (Ptr) near the end of the endotracheal tube through a 1.5-mm ID catheter and airflow (V) at 0, 5, and 10 cm H2O PEEP (normal subjects) and at 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 cm H2O PEEP (patients with ARDS). We computed respiratory system static elastance (Estrs), maximal (Rrsmax) and minimal (Rrsmin) inspiratory resistance by the end-inspiratory occlusion method during constant-flow inflation. Rrsmin represents the ohmic respiratory resistance, whereas Rrsmax is Rrsmin plus the additional respiratory impedance caused by the stress adaptation phenomena of the respiratory system tissues and to time constant inhomogeneities between lung units (pendelluft). The difference (Rrsmax - Rrsmin) has been termed DRrs. We also computed expiratory resistance (Rrsexp) at preselected volume (50% of expiration; Rrsexp50) and flow (0.3 L/s; Rrsexp0.3) using the equation: Rrsexp = (Pelrs(t) - Ptr(t]/Flow(t), where elastic recoil pressure (Pelrs) at time t was computed as:Estrs . V(t) + PEEP, in which V(t) is the volume above end-expiratory volume at time t. We found that (1) at PEEP 0, expiratory resistances (Rrsexp50: 7.38 +/- 1.92 versus 5.35 +/- 1.97 cm H2O.L-1.s) and DRrs (3.08 +/- 1.9 versus 1.66 +/- 0.77 cm H2O.L-1.s) were significantly higher in the ARDS group than in the normal group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Both exercise and inspiratory flow-resistive loading may cause recruitment of expiratory muscles. To evaluate the extent of recruitment in combined exercise and flow-resistive loading, and to estimate the effect on inspiratory muscle work, we studied five men, 26 to 39 yr of age, during mild exercise with different degrees of inspiratory flow-resistive loading. Each subject performed four 1-h exercise runs at 30% of their maximal oxygen consumption on different days while inspiring through an external resistor of either 1.4, 14.5, 19.9, or 30.6 cm H2O/s/L. Mouth and esophageal pressure, inspiratory flow rate, and abdominal and rib cage motion were recorded continuously. Abdominal expansion tended to lead and rib cage expansion tended to lag the start of inspiration as judged from the beginning of negative pressure development at the mouth. These time differences increased as resistive load increased. Plots of abdominal versus rib cage motion also showed increase in phase shift, with the abdomen leading the rib cage on inspiration. For all subjects, the esophageal pressure at the end of expiration became less negative as the resistive load increased, indicating that the end-expiratory volume decreased with increasing resistive load. We conclude that there was increasing use of expiratory muscles as the resistive load increased, and that the initial expansion of the abdomen at high resistive loads represented elastic recoil of structures that had been compressed below the volume at FRC by the expiratory muscles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Serum AM level was determined 30 min after the bolus (17.8 +/- 0.8 mg/L, SD). In chronic experiments (n = 20), either AM (n = 10) or saline (n = 10) was infused subcutaneously via an osmotic minipump at a constant pumping rate of 2.5 microliters/h. Serum AM level was measured after 2 wk of pump infusion (12.3 +/- 2.0 mg/L, SD). For each animal in both acute and chronic experiments, a muscle strip from the right midcostal diaphragm was placed in an in vitro chamber containing Krebs solution and 12 microM/L curare. For the AM-treated group, AM was added to the tissue bath in a concentration similar to that in the serum. No AM was added to the bath for the control group. Forces were measured isometrically during direct muscle stimulation at different frequencies and standardized to muscle weight. Muscle fatigue was induced by repetitive stimulation at 40 pps, delivered in 330-ms trains, with one train presented each second. With either acute or chronic AM administration, a significant increase in diaphragm contractility was observed (p less than 0.01). In contrast, AM did not affect the rate of force decline during fatigue run.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The more rapid and shallow ventilation pattern seen during exercise in patients with obstructive and/or restrictive lung disease has been attributed by some investigators to the effects of vagal afferents from intrapulmonary receptors. Recipients of heart-lung transplants (HLTR) offer a unique opportunity to test this hypothesis since they have denervated lungs and may develop obliterative bronchiolitis after organ rejection. We thus compared the ventilation responses to incremental bicycle ergometry of five HLTR with relatively normal pulmonary function (HLTR-N) and four with bronchiolitis obliterans (HLTR-O). We compared the slopes of the linear portion of the tidal volume versus inspired minute ventilation relationship of both groups. The rate of rise of tidal volume (VT) (slope of VT versus VI) was greater in HLTR-N (0.31 +/- 0.004) than in HLTR-O (0.023 +/- 0.007) (p less than 0.05). This corresponded to a slower increase in respiratory rate (RR) (slope of RR versus Vl/cm) in HLTR-N (0.055 +/- 0.005) than in HLTR-O (0.083 +/- 0.019) (p less than 0.01). Furthermore, values for VT, inspiratory time (TI), and duty cycle (TI/Ttot) measured during exercise at the VT break point were all significantly lower in the HLTR-O than in HLTR-N. We also evaluated the ability of HLTR with lung disease to regulate their ultimate level of ventilation during maximal exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

As there is a genetically determined component of chemoreceptor sensitivity, parents and siblings of children with CCHS may also have blunted ventilatory responses to hypercapnea and hypoxia. To test this, we studied hypercapnic ventilatory responses and hypoxic ventilatory responses in six mothers, four fathers, and five siblings (6 to 49 yr of age) of seven children with CCHS and compared them with 15 age- and sex-matched control subjects (5 to 47 yr of age). Pulmonary function tests were not different between relatives of children with CCHS and control subjects. To measure hypercapnic ventilatory responses, subjects rebreathed 5% CO2/95% O2 until PACO2 reached 60 to 70 mm Hg. To measure hypoxic ventilatory responses (L/min/% SaO2), subjects rebreathed 14% O2/7% CO2/balance N2 at mixed venous PCO2 until SaO2 fell to 75%. All tests were completed in less than 4 min. Instantaneous minute ventilation, mean inspiratory flow (tidal volume/inspiratory time), and respiratory timing (inspiratory timing/total respiratory cycle timing) were calculated on a breath-by-breath basis. Hypercapnic ventilatory responses were 1.97 +/- 0.32 L/min/mm Hg PACO2 in children with CCHS relatives and 2.23 +/- 0.23 L/min/mm Hg PACO2 in control subjects.

At 1 month the response to a single breath of oxygen during normoxia was a decrease in minute ventilation of 264 +/- 34.2 (SEM) ml.min-1 during the 10-s period following the stimulus (p less than 0.001). During mild hypoxia the decrease in ventilation averaged 471 +/- 49.1 (SEM) ml.min-1 (p less than 0.001). The difference in response between measurements in air and mild hypoxia was significant (p less than 0.001). By the age of 3 months, the absolute ventilatory response to a single breath of oxygen increased significantly in normoxia by 118 +/- 35.2 ml.min-1 (p less than 0.01); the test response to breathing 16% oxygen paralleled the response to normoxia and was on average 254 +/- 26.6 ml.min-1 larger than the response when breathing air (p less than 0.001). When the three age groups were compared, calculating the response per killigram body weight showed that the response was similar at all three ages tested.

To better understand the progression of lung destruction in smokers, we studied the contribution of its principal components: breaks in the alveolar septa (DIb) and the presence of emphysematous spaces (DIe), and compared them to the mean linear intercept (Lm) and DI as originally described. To do this we employed lungs obtained at autopsy from non-smokers and smokers. Lungs were selected by emphysema score (ES) so that all cases were emphysema free (nonsmokers and seven smokers) or had minimal emphysema (nine smokers; ES = 5). Of these indices, only DIb was significantly increased in the lungs of smokers: 17.8 +/- 1.2 versus 12.4 +/- 1.6, p less than 0.05. We also investigated the regional distribution of destruction by comparing results in upper and lower lobes. DIe, but not DIb, was significantly increased in upper lobes of smokers. These data support the notion that increases in DI in the lungs of smokers that occur before increases in Lm or ES reflect the presence of alveolar septal breaks and highlight the importance of alveolar septal destruction as a precursor to the development of airspace enlargement in the lungs of cigarette smokers.\r"

The phospholipid composition of the surface-active material recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is abnormal in this disease. In the present study we have extended the analysis of surfactant components in IPF to include the major surfactant-associated protein, surfactant protein A (SP-A). SP-A has been reported to be essential for the formation of tubular myelin, to facilitate the adsorption of phospholipid to the air/liquid interface, and to stimulate uptake and inhibit secretion of surfactant in vitro. The BAL of 25 normal volunteers and 42 patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) was analyzed for surfactant protein A content by ELISA and for phospholipids. The changes in BAL components were correlated to histopathologic markers at open-lung biopsy, clinical status, and survival. The total phospholipid (PL) recovered at lavage was reduced in patients with IPF relative to normal volunteers (p less than 0.0005). In addition, the percentage of phosphatidyl-glycerol (% PG) was decreased in patients with IPF (p less than 0.0001), whereas the percentage of phosphatidylcholine that was saturated was not altered. The content of surfactant protein A in lavage was reduced, even when normalized for the total amount of surface-active material recovered (SP-A/PL) (p less than 0.007). The reduction in SP-A was not specific to IPF but also occurred in other interstitial lung diseases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Hamsters were exposed to either saline aerosol or dilute aerosols of LPS (4 micrograms/m3) for standard lengths of time. Within each aerosol exposure group, animals were further subdivided into groups receiving either the PAF receptor binding antagonist, RP 48740, or saline injections. LPS inhalation resulted in decreased fixed lung volume, increased sequestration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and platelets in pulmonary capillaries, increased type I epithelial and endothelial cellular volumes, increased cellular interstitium, and increased endothelial pinocytotic vesicles. Treatment with RP 48740 either attenuated or abolished the ability of inhaled LPS to induce these structural alterations. The PAF antagonist also inhibited LPS-induced increases in pulmonary capillary permeability. It is concluded that PAF is one of the major injury-promoting mediators released upon inhalation exposure to environmentally realistic concentrations of bacterial endotoxin. A major but not exclusive target of this mediator is the pulmonary vascular endothelium.\r"

In most of these studies the investigators used statistical models that required a priori assumptions concerning the underlying form or structure of the lung function data, thus introducing possible biases. In this study we used recently developed nonparametric regression (spline) techniques to describe the evolution of lung function measures with age. This procedure yields an optimally fitted smooth curve through the data and estimates of the process velocity and does not require assumptions concerning the underlying shape of the data curves. The lung function growth-velocity curves are used to estimate the age of growth cessation. This technique was applied to the FVC, FEV1, and the FEV1/FVC ratios of 1,295 females and 1,230 males who were tested in at least one of the first nine surveys of the Tucson epidemiologic study of airway obstructive diseases. Data were analyzed stratified according to gender, smoking status, and respiratory symptoms or diseases. The results indicate large differences between the fitted FEV1 and FEV1/FVC smoothed curves of the various subgroups compared with asymptomatic nonsmokers. These differences were most pronounced in the adult symptomatic smokers, who had higher rates of lung function loss that also began at earlier ages, for both sexes. No significant differences were observed between asymptomatic and symptomatic nonsmokers, most likely because of the reduced number of symptomatic nonsmokers, particularly among the males.\r"

We found a comparable increase in the number of PMN in lung tissue of C5-sufficient and C5-deficient mice given Escherichia coli LPS (0127:B8, 3 mg/kg), revealing that LPS acts independently of C5 and its biologically active fragments. Intravenous injection of LPS (3 mg/kg) into rats caused significant intravascular complement activation as assessed by serum CH50 and resulted in an almost 10-fold increase in numbers of PMN in lung tissue. Pretreatment of rats with CVF (50 U) did not reduce LPS-induced PMN sequestration, suggesting that the process is independent of C3. As reported previously, we found large numbers of PMN in bronchoalveolar lavage samples of 24 h after injection of LPS (3 mg/kg). Complement depletion did not prevent LPS-induced migration of PMN. No PMN migration occurred 2, 6, 12, 24, or 48 h after injection of CVF alone, indicating that complement activation is not sufficient to cause PMN migration. In contrast to our findings in rats, no PMN migrated into airspaces of C5-sufficient and C5-deficient mice 24 or 48 h after injection of LPS (3 to 20 mg/kg).\r"

We have recently demonstrated that infusion of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor alpha (rTNF alpha) into sheep elicits a physiologic response in the lung that closely resembles endotoxemia. The present study examines the morphologic changes that accompany these alterations in pulmonary physiology. Five anesthetized, open-chest sheep received 0.01 mg/kg of protein (2.24 x 10(7) U rTNF alpha/mg) intravenously over 30 min. Lung biopsy tissue for light and electron microscopy was obtained from random lobes 7.5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 min after beginning the infusion. Pulmonary (Ppa) and systemic arterial pressures, cardiac output, and peripheral blood leukocyte number and differential counts were monitored throughout the study. Three control animals were treated in a similar manner but received either saline (n = 1) or rTNF alpha denatured by boiling for 30 min (n = 2). rTNF alpha caused an early increase in Ppa and peripheral blood leukopenia. Light microscopy revealed a threefold increase in the number of granulocytes per 100 alveolar profiles by 30 min and a fivefold increase by 2 h. From 60 min, increased alveolar wall thickness, red cell congestion, and peribronchovascular edema were apparent; from 2 h, there was increased cellularity of the alveolar walls and mononuclear cell infiltration of perivascular connective tissue. Electron microscopy revealed damage to alveolar Type I and II pneumonocytes and progressive endothelial injury from 30 min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The potential importance of pleural fibrin deposition in the pathogenesis of pleural injury is supported by both clinical and experimental observations. We hypothesized that the local equilibrium between procoagulant and fibrinolytic activities is disrupted to favor fibrin deposition in exudative pleuritis. To test this hypothesis, we characterized procoagulant and fibrinolytic activities in pleural exudates from patients with pneumonia, lung cancer, or empyema and transudates from patients with congestive heart failure. Procoagulant activity was generally increased in exudative processes and was due mainly to tissue factor. All effusions contained antithrombin III and inhibited factor Xa and thrombin, but endogenous prothrombinase or thrombin activities were variably detected. Pleural fluid fibrinolytic activity was increased in congestive heart failure and was due to both tissue plasminogen activator and urokinase. Depressed fibrinolytic activity was found in pleural exudates despite increased concentrations of plasminogen, mainly glu-1-plasminogen, and was due to inhibition of plasminogen activation by plasminogen activator inhibitors 1 and 2 and of plasmin, in part by alpha 2-antiplasmin. Concentrations of PAI-1 in exudative pleural fluids were increased up to 913-fold, compared with normal pooled plasma. Exudative pleural effusions are characterized by increased procoagulant and depressed fibrinolytic activity, favoring fibrin deposition in the pleural space. The balance of these activities is reversed and favors fibrin clearance in congestive heart failure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To verify the hypothesis that alveolar macrophages (AMs) from patients infected with HIV-1 could synthesize and release TNF alpha, AMs recovered from the BAL fluid of 11 patients with seropositive HIV-1 (six with AIDS and five with ARC) were tested in vitro for their ability to destroy TNF alpha-susceptible targets. Furthermore, the presence of TNF alpha was assessed in AM-conditioned supernatants on the basis of their cytotoxic activity and by using an immunoenzymatic test and immunoblotting. Transcription of the TNF alpha gene in AMs was also studied by means of the Northern blot analysis. AMs freshly recovered from patients infected with HIV-1 exhibited high levels of cell-mediated cytotoxicity against U937 targets, and the addition of a polyclonal anti-TNF alpha antibody resulted in a significant inhibition of the target lysis. Cell-free supernatants conditioned by unstimulated AMs exerted high levels of cytotoxic activity against TNF alpha-sensitive targets, whereas duplicate, neutralization experiments performed in the presence of an anti-TNF alpha antibody proved that the observed cytotoxic activity was mostly mediated by TNF alpha. The presence of high amounts of TNF alpha in the conditioned media was confirmed by the immunoenzymatic test. In addition, the immunoblot analysis showed that the TNF alpha released by AMs has a Mr 17,000 band, identical to a standard preparation of recombinant TNF alpha. The Northern blot demonstrated that unstimulated AMs express detectable levels of mRNA transcripts for TNF alpha. Taken together, our data support the concept that AMs from patients with HIV-1 infection constitutively release TNF alpha.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Adherence of gram-negative bacteria (GNB) to epithelial surfaces is important for GNB colonization to occur. Pili, rodlike structures projecting from the outer membrane of GNB, and GNB surface hydrophobicity have been shown to enhance GNB adherence. We investigated the types of pili and the hydrophobicity of aerobic GNB colonizing the stomach, oropharynx, and trachea of critically ill patients. Piliation and hydrophobicity of oral, tracheal, and gastric GNB were compared with that of commensal GNB isolated from patients' rectums. Significantly more oropharyngeal than rectal GNB were piliated, and the most common type of pili present was type 1, or mannose-sensitive pili. Mannose-resistant and P pili were present less often, and no colonizing GNB had S pili. Colonizing GNB were hydrophilic rather than hydrophobic, and no differences in hydrophobicity were noted between colonizing GNB and rectal isolates. Our results suggest that pili may be important for oropharyngeal GNB colonization.\r"

  ".W": "Changes in airway resistance are reported to account for only a portion of changes in total lung resistance. The fraction of total lung resistance caused by airway resistance is difficult to quantify in vivo. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) has potential application for directly measuring changes in airway size in vivo. In the present investigation, we studied five anesthetized mongrel dogs using HRCT to locate and measure changes in airway area after aerosol histamine challenge in the absence and presence of deep inspiration. We also related changes in total lung resistance to changes in airway area. We found that in all dogs after histamine aerosol challenge, airway area decreased (range, 23 +/- 7 to 67 +/- 5%, mean +/- SEM), and total lung resistance increased (range, 191 to 378%). After deep inspiration (equal to three times tidal volume), four of the five dogs showed further significant decreases in airway area (range, 13 +/- 6 to 71 +/- 8%), whereas all five dogs showed decreases in RL (range, 3 to 35%). The fact that preconstricted airways constricted further after deep inspiration while the measured RL decreased suggests that RL may not always be a reliable indicator of changes in the size of conducting airways larger than 1 mm.\r"

  ".W": "Alveolar epithelial lining fluid (ELF) contains several antioxidant substances that may provide in vivo protection. We studied the ability of ELF and ELF components to inhibit the neutrophil oxidant hypochlorous acid (HOCI). Normal bronchoalveolar lavage fluid containing ELF was incubated with physiologically relevant concentrations of HOCI (0.04 mM). After incubation, residual HOCI activity was titered by the iodide method. The inhibitory activity of lavage fluid was unexpectedly strong. For example, lavage fluid diluted 20-fold in the assay system quenched 49% of starting HOCI. We initially postulated that ELF total protein and glutathione would account for most of the inhibition of HOCI. However, several experimental approaches demonstrated that the total protein and glutathione concentrations in diluted lavage fluid were too low to explain the observed inhibition. Instead, the majority of HOCI inhibition was due to the lidocaine used for upper airway anesthesia. Reagent lidocaine exhibited strong reactivity in the HOCI assay system. Furthermore, the lavage fluid lidocaine concentration (32.4 +/- 6.9 micrograms/ml) was sufficient to explain most of the observed quenching activity. Additional experiments explored the hypothetical quenching activity of ELF components devoid of lidocaine. These findings demonstrate the technical problems posed by lidocaine in antioxidant studies involving lavage fluid or ELF.\r"

These alterations in lung function do not, however, elucidate the potential for acute small airway responses. In this study we employed a test of aerosol dispersion to examine the potential effects of ozone on small airways in humans. Twenty-two healthy nonsmoking male volunteers were exposed to 0.4 ppm ozone for 1 h while exercising at 20 L/min/m2 body surface area. Before and immediately after exposure, tests of spirometry (FVC, FEV1, and FEF25-75) and plethysmography (Raw and SRaw) were performed. Subjects also performed an aerosol dispersion test before and after exposure. Each test involved a subject inhaling five to seven breaths of a 300-ml bolus of a 0.5 micron triphenyl phosphate aerosol injected into a 2-L tidal volume. The bolus was injected into the tidal breath at three different depths: at Depth A the bolus was injected after 1.6 L of clean air were inhaled from FRC, at Depth B after 1.2 L, and at Depth C after 1.2 L but with inhalation beginning from RV. The primary measure of bolus dispersion was the expired half-width (HW). Secondary measures were the ratio (expressed as percent) of peak exhaled aerosol concentration to peak inhaled concentration (PR), shift in the median bolus volume between inspiration and expiration (VS), and percent of total aerosol recovered (RC). Changes in pulmonary function after ozone exposure were consistent with previous findings.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
