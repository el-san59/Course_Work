Patients were restaged after the first three courses of MOPP and the status of response to therapy at that time was called early response to chemotherapy (ERC). The rate of nitrogen mustard and procarbazine delivery (MRD) during the first three cycles of chemotherapy also was assessed. At the completion of the therapy patients were restaged and the final response was assessed. Fifty-two (86.7%) patients entered complete remission (CR). Forty-eight percent of the complete responders achieved CR in the first three courses of MOPP. Eight-year survival and disease-free survival (DFS) rates of the patients achieving CR were 71% and 73%, respectively. Survival and DFS were significantly better for the patients who achieved CR in the first three cycles of chemotherapy than for patients who entered CR at a later stage of therapy: 8-year survival 90% versus 55% (P = 0.00); 8-year DFS 87% versus 59% (P = 0.01). The attainment of a complete ERC was adversely affected by lymphocyte depletion (LD) histologic type (P = 0.01) and MRD less than 65% (P = 0.04). However, when a multivariate regression analysis was used, ERC was the only significant prognostic variable for survival and DFS and its predictive value was confirmed even after correction by MRD. These data suggest that the rapidity of response to chemotherapy could be an important prognostic factor in high-risk Stage II and III Hodgkin's disease.\r"

In one of the four patients suspected pulmonary nodules developed shortly after the start of chemotherapy, but regressed completely with continued treatment. In another patient with a primary left wrist melanoma and palpable epitrochlear and axillary nodes, there was dramatic shrinkage of nodal disease during chemotherapy and subsequent biopsies were cytologically negative. The expected survival of children with this rare condition when diagnosed at a comparably advanced stage and treated primarily by surgery is 32% compared with the 100% survival in these four cases. Although dacarbazine has not been notably successful as adjuvant therapy in high-risk adult melanoma, data from this small series is suggestive of an adjuvant effect in high-risk childhood melanoma and merits further study although the rarity of this condition may make a controlled trial difficult.\r"

Mitoxantrone was given by random assignment, either as a 10 mg/m2 single intravenous dose or in five consecutive daily fractions of 2 mg2. Vinblastine was given as a continuous intravenous infusion of 1.2 mg/m2 daily for 5 days. In 115 evaluable patients previously treated with doxorubicin, 21 objective responses (18%) and 11 minor responses (10%) were observed with similar distribution in the two treatment groups. Median time to progression was 27 weeks and 23 weeks, respectively. Eight (32%) of 25 patients who had not received doxorubicin achieved objective remissions and two (8%) had minor responses. Toxic effects were similar for the two treatment schedules. Major toxicities were myelosuppression and neutropenic fever. Other toxicities were mild. Cardiotoxicity, presumably caused by mitoxantrone, occurred in four patients. The combination of mitoxantrone and vinblastine appeared to offer no advantage over single-agent therapy, probably because of the dosage reduction required by the overlapping myelosuppressive toxicity.\r"

Physical examination with measurement of the tumor diameter was more predictive for regional extension of the disease as compared to lymphography and CT. CT may detect subclinical parametrial invasion but overestimation of the extent of the disease is common. Bipedal lymphography and CT add only limited information to the routine presurgical staging of cancer of the uterine cervix.\r"

Cervical lymphadenopathy first appeared 6 years after the diagnosis of HCL, and histologic features of the node were characteristic of HD. As it was possible that the neoplastic cells of both lesions might have originated from a single clone, their phenotypic features were defined. The hairy cells were found to bear surface immunoglobulin, receptors for complement components, leukocyte common antigen, and antigen defined by LN-1 monoclonal antibody, whereas lymph node lesion was characterized as HD because the Reed-Sternberg-like cells were positive for Leu M1 antigen, lysozyme, alpha-1-antitrypsin, and nonspecific cross-reacting antigen. Since there was no evidence indicating a common clonal origin, it is more likely to consider that both lesions are derived from different clones.\r"

Stromal cell lines from mouse bone marrow as well as primary stromal cells from human bone marrow stimulated the growth of HCT and oat human carcinoma cells 32-fold and 25-fold, respectively. In contrast, these stromal cells inhibited the in vitro cloning of human and mouse sarcoma cell lines. Both activities of the stromal cells diffused through agar layers and operated across species barriers. Despite the diffusable nature of the factors involved, no biologic activity was observed in concentrated conditioned media prepared in the presence or absence of serum. Human foreskin fibroblasts tested under identical conditions, could neither stimulate nor inhibit the clonal growth of tumors. This preferential growth of tumor cells in the presence of tissue specific stroma may be used as an in vitro model for the study of the role of stromal cells in tumor cell spread.\r"

S-antigen-like and opsin-like immunoreactions occur in nine of 28 medulloblastomas investigated. All tumors displaying S-antigen-like immunoreactive neoplastic cells also contain opsin-like immunoreactive cells; however, the opsin-like immunoreactive cells were less frequent than the S-antigen-like immunoreactive cells throughout all positive cases. The immunoreactive cells displayed several long processes. Generally, both S-antigen and opsin-like immunoreactive cells considerably vary in number among individual tumors. The results indicate that certain neoplastic cells of medulloblastoma are capable of expression of photoreceptor-specific proteins and, thus, may be closely related to tumor cells of retinoblastoma and pineocytomas previously shown to bind antisera against retinal S-antigen and opsin. No S-antigen and opsin-like immunoreaction was found in malignant teratomas and germinomas of the pineal gland, oat cell tumors, astrocytomas, ependymomas, oligodendrogliomas, glioblastomas, gangliogliomas, gangliocytoma, ganglioneuroblastomas, neuroblastomas, and esthesioneuroblastoma.\r"

The authors divided small thyroid tumors into two subgroups according to diameter: 0 less than or equal to 5 mm (classified as minute carcinoma) and 5 less than 0 less than or equal to 10 mm (classified as tiny carcinomas). Characteristics including sex, age, histologic type, extrathyroid invasion, and lymph node metastasis were examined in each subgroup. In patients with minute carcinoma, very few incidences of extrathyroid invasion and lymph node metastasis were found. However, these involvements, especially lymph node metastasis, were found more frequently in patients with tiny carcinoma. The incidence of cervical lymph node metastasis was 13% in minute carcinoma and 59% in tiny carcinoma. (P less than 0.01). These findings suggest the need for more careful observation and treatment of tiny carcinomas, especially with respect to lymph node metastasis. In accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) classification, the histologic types of thyroid carcinoma were classified into papillary and follicular carcinomas. The papillary carcinoma and follicular carcinoma ratios were compared between the two subgroups. The discovery rate of follicular carcinoma was significantly higher in minute carcinoma than in tiny carcinoma (P less than 0.005). This suggests that the papillary carcinoma/follicular carcinoma ratio (p/f) increases as the size of the carcinoma increases, and that follicular carcinoma is the \"seed,\" or initial form, of thyroid cancer. The female-male ratio in small thyroid cancer suggests that there is no sex difference in carcinogenesis but that there is more probability for cancer development in the thyroid in women.\r"

Inflammation and/or necrosis were studied in biopsy specimens of 140 untreated patients with Hodgkin's disease (57 febrile and 83 afebrile). In 37 of the 140 tumors I/N were readily observed; 18 were from febrile patients, and 19 from afebrile. Thus, it is evident that I/N cannot account for fever in the majority of febrile patients, necessitating an alternative explanation. Among the patients with I/N of their tumor, fever occurred most often in male patients and in virtually all patients who had histologic types other than nodular sclerosis. However, it was peculiarly absent in the great majority of patients whose tumors were of the nodular sclerosis type. This paradoxic inverse correlation of fever with I/N of tumors in patients with the nodular sclerosing histologic type has not been described previously.\r"

Patient age ranged from 27 to 87 years (mean, 61 years) with a 2.2:1 male-female ratio. Eighty-eight percent of tumors occurred distally, i.e., in the jejunoileum. Considerable histologic heterogeneity was noted including epithelioid, myxoid, and sclerotic variants. Stratification by histologic grade suggests important clinical subsets. Only in grade I tumors is surgical extirpation alone potentially curative. Grade II tumors are associated with meaningful survival usually measured in years, however, nearly all patients can be expected to die from their tumors. Grade III sarcomas are fully malignant and rapidly progressive: except for one case with limited follow-up, all patients with Grade III sarcomas died of disease with a mean survival of only nine months (median, 2 months). Immunostaining with antibodies directed against vimentin, muscle-specific actin, desmin, and S-100 protein were performed. Only antivimentin was uniformly reactive. Sixty-three percent of cases tested showed actin immunoreactivity, and no tumors revealed immunohistochemically detectable desmin or S-100 protein. Although many small bowel stromal sarcomas appear \"poorly differentiated\" by immunohistochemical methods presently available, that they are indeed leiomyosarcomas seems most likely from their intramural location and light histologic study. The limited utility of immunophenotyping and the importance of histologic grading are stressed.\r"

  ".W": "Analysis of cellular DNA and RNA contents of 249 bladder irrigation specimens from 129 patients with a history of transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder was performed using acridine-orange flow cytometry (FCM). Washings from patients with prior intravesical chemotherapy or radiation therapy were compared to those from patients with no history of treatment other than tumor resection to evaluate the reliability of FCM for the detection of tumor and the influence of prior local therapy on that reliability. Five FCM patterns were defined on the basis of DNA and RNA indexes in relationship to peripheral blood lymphocytes. FCM results were compared to cytologic findings in 237 cases, cystoscopic findings in 230 cases, and histologic data in 99 cases. Presence of a single diploid stem line was associated with absence of bladder tumor in 71% of cases from patients treated with surgery alone or with radiation therapy, but there was residual tumor in 53% of patients exposed to prior local chemotherapy. An elevated RNA content in a diploid cell population did not provide additional diagnostic information. Presence of an aneuploid stem line was associated with tumor in 85% of cases, regardless of prior therapy. Aneuploidy predicted the appearance of tumor in four of six patients with a negative cystoscopy. Tetraploidy (greater than 10% of total cell population) was associated with tumor in 79% of patients treated with surgery alone, whereas no tumor was found in more than 50% of patients who had undergone prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy. This study stresses the importance of prior treatment history in evaluating the results of DNA-FCM for bladder cancer. It demonstrates the unreliability of FCM diploid and tetraploid cell populations in patients previously treated by local chemotherapy or radiation. However, it also supports prior observations that DNA-aneuploidy and DNA-tetraploidy are useful for detecting and predicting bladder cancer in patients submitted to surgery alone.\r"

  ".W": "Cell lines derived from human melanoma xenografts were characterized for surface markers, karyotype abnormalities, and in vitro drug sensitivity. Xenografts were established using metastatic explants from untreated patients and passaged in nude mice. Cell lines were readily established from melanoma xenografts, and formed colonies when plated in semisolid media. The lines expressed human melanoma-associated and other surface antigens, human lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isoenzymes, and contained only human chromosomes. They failed to express murine histocompatibility determinants and were negative for murine viruses by mouse antibody production assay. Karyotypes showed abnormalities of chromosomes 3, 6, and 7 similar to other melanomas. In vitro chemosensitivity profiles were compared using cell line and xenograft colony-forming assays. Values were similar for the original xenografts and their cell lines. Xenograft-derived human melanoma lines resemble other melanoma cell lines and primary melanomas with respect to surface antigens and karyotype abnormalities, and are appropriate models for studying in vitro drug sensitivity. When used as a model for transition from solid tumor to cell line, these studies suggest cell lines closely mirror in vitro chemosensitivities of parent tumor cells. However, occasional, unpredictable changes in sensitivity to some drugs occurs during this transition.\r"

Copper was higher in patients than in controls (1.50 +/- 0.06 versus 1.10 +/- 0.02 micrograms/ml, P less than 0.001), increased steadily from Stage 0 to Stage 4 (P = 0.002), and correlated with the lymphocyte count and serum lactate dehydrogenase (P less than 0.01) but not with acute phase reactants. Zinc was lower in patients than in controls (0.94 +/- 0.03 versus 1.10 +/- 0.02 micrograms/ml, P less than 0.001). Zinc (NS), selenium (P = 0.039), and calcium (P = 0.033), were decreased in Stages 3-4 as compared to Stages 0-2. The copper-to-zinc ratio (CZR) increased continuously from Stage 0 to Stage 4 (P less than 0.001). Discriminant analysis between two groups, Stage 0-2 and Stage 3-4, based on serum copper, zinc, calcium, and protein levels, allowed for a correct classification of 94% of the patients. Moreover, the clinical staging of the remaining 6% was modified retrospectively according to the results of discriminant analysis. It was concluded that (1) serum copper and CZR are useful indices of the extent of disease, (2) they are independent of a nonspecific acute phase reaction, (3) STE determination could be helpful in the staging of a limited number of CLL patients, and (4) zinc deficiency could contribute to immune dysfunction in CLL.\r"

Two patients died in the postoperative period and were excluded from the follow-up analysis. Twenty-nine cases (76%) involved the optic chiasm, nine (24%) cases were confined to one optic nerve. Most tumors were slow growing and progressive although there were three cases of adult chiasmal gliomas which exhibited unusually aggressive behavior. The three cases are presented in detail. After a mean follow-up period of 9.4 years, the 10-year overall actuarial survival was 87%. Relapse-free survival was 55% at 10 years. Chiasmal tumors had a poorer prognosis compared to optic nerve tumors with 56% of chiasmal tumors recurring versus 22% of optic nerve tumors. Radiotherapy was beneficial in chiasmal gliomas, initially improving vision in 35% (6/17) and decreasing recurrence from 86% (6/7) without radiation therapy to 45% (9/20) with radiation therapy. Optic gliomas are not benign, self-limiting lesions, and therefore require treatment. Radiotherapy is effective in chiasmal gliomas and should be used early in the management of these tumors. No advantage to radiotherapy could be demonstrated for optic nerve gliomas, although the number of these cases analyzed was small.\r"

Tumor spread was along planes of least resistance, most commonly in the submucosa. Microscopically directed excisions were able to trace and remove these tumor extensions. Local control in 93 patients with 2-year follow-up was 91% and, with salvage of recurrences, was 95%. The authors' observations suggest three important concepts. First, epidermoid cancer of the head and neck grows as a continuous neoplasm. Second, this work casts serious doubt on the concept of \"field cancerization\" or multiple primaries as a cause of local recurrence. Third, conventional frozen section analysis of surgical margins is highly unlikely to discover microscopic extensions because many tumor extensions are thin, finger-like projections which require examination of the entire surgical margin to detect.\r"

The diagnostic accuracy of the triple test at benign changes is comparable to that of histologic examination, but participation of experienced radiologists and cytologists as well as persons skilled in fine-needle puncture is required. Twenty-eight percent of the planned excisional biopsies were made superfluous by the fine-needle puncture, which immediately revealed the tumor as a cyst, abscess, or hematoma. For this reason, too, fine-needle puncture is recommended as a routine procedure.\r"

The incidence of bile duct carcinoma associated with CDBD is very high. However, coexistent gall bladder carcinoma in CDBD is a new topic, and coexistent intrahepatic bile duct carcinoma in CDBD is extremely rare.

One hundred sixty catheters were placed in patients with malignant disease, many of whom were immunosuppressed at the time of catheter insertion. Seventy of 160 (44%) patients received prophylactic antibiotics and 90 (56%) did not. The mean age of each group was 23 years (range, 2 to 70 years), and the patients in each group were statistically similar in sex, underlying disease, and routine preoperative hematologic and biochemical evaluation. Exit-site wound infections occurred in 50 of 90 (55.5%) patients who did not receive prophylaxis and in 12 of 70 (17%) patients who received prophylaxis (P less than 0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of tunnel and incision site infections. The mean duration of antibiotic prophylaxis was 2.9 days (SD, 1.2 days). Organisms cultured from catheter associated infections, included Staphylococcus epidermidis 36, S. aureus 30, Klebsiella pneumoniae 1, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 3, Escherichia coli 1, and diphtheroids non-CDC-JK 3. Vancomycin was used as antibiotic prophylaxis in 64 patients, Kefzol (Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN) in one, oxacillin in three, nafcillin in one, and Septra (Burroughs Wellcome, Research Triangle Park, NC) in one. The data indicate that the use of intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduces exit site infection and may reduce both tunnel and incision site infection. Prophylactic antibiotic coverage should be provided to patients during insertion of long-term indwelling right atrial catheters.\r"

  ".W": "The ingestion of hot food and beverages has repeatedly been postulated as a risk factor for cancer of the esophagus. Although several studies have been performed on the correlation of the consumption of hot tea and esophageal cancer, no research has heretofore documented, by actually measuring, the temperature at which the tea is consumed. Therefore, a tea temperature measurement study was carried out in the Caspian Littoral of Iran, where the frequency of esophageal cancer is the highest in the world. The study was conducted during a population-food-habits survey in 1968 to 1969, which was performed before statistics were available regarding the incidence rate or geographic distribution of this disease in the region. Ten years later, when the results of the Caspian Cancer Registry were analyzed, the data from this nutritional study was compared with the regional distribution of esophageal cancer. A geographic correlation exists between the frequency of consumption of hot tea and the incidence of esophageal cancer. Seventy-two percent of the people in the low-risk region of esophageal cancer drank their tea at the relatively moderate temperature of below 55 degrees C, compared with only 3% in the high risk region. More importantly, 62% of the adult population in the high-risk region, as opposed to 19% in the low-risk region, drank their tea at a temperature of over 65 degrees C. In addition to the thermal irritation of hot tea, the following considerations cannot be ignored: the carcinogenicity role of tannins; the cancer-promoting effect of phenols; and the absorption facilitating role of hot tea. Alcohol and tobacco, the most important risk factors for cancer of the esophagus in many countries, play a negligible role in the cause of this disease in northern Iran. In this region, nutritional deficiencies--a special diet for pregnant women composed of sour pomegranite seeds, black pepper, and garlic; consumption of bread contaminated with silica fibre; and ingestion of opium and opium dross--combined with long-lasting and daily thermal irritation of the esophagus with very hot tea play an important role in the development of this disease. The inhabitants of the high-risk area consumed roughly 2.5 times more tea than their counterparts in the low-risk area. In addition, the mean daily consumption of tea leaves per person (average) was 5.7 g and 3.8 g, respectively.\r"

A long-term study of 3285 patients diagnosed between 1970 and 1975 was compared with a short-term study of 1887 patients diagnosed in 1983. An increase of the symptom of a lump in the testis from 23.1% to 31.2% and a mass as a sign of cancer from 44.5% to 53.8% suggests earlier detection of testis cancer by the patient and physician. Changes in the methods of diagnosis reflect the changing technology of tumor diagnosis. The 10-year survival rates for pathologic Stage I seminoma (82.6% of all seminomas) exceeded 96%. For pathologic Stage I nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (51.7% of all NSGCT), 10-year survival was 87.1%; whereas for Stage III (18.7% of all NSGCT) it was 22.1%. The impact of the important advances in chemotherapy is reflected in the increase of 1-year survival of Stage III NSGCT from 50.5% to 78.4%. Testis cancer can be cured in most patients.\r"

For the major gynecologic cancers and breast cancer, improvements are evident for some sites but, areas of decline also are observed. Black women in the US have a poorer survival rate than white women and the trend in recent years suggest that this gap may be widening. Comparisons of survival rates from comprehensive cancer centers and population-based rates indicate differences in outcomes associated with the treatment setting. Data from the American College of Surgeons (ACS) patterns of care surveys suggest substantial interhospital variability in cancer survival which is largely explained by characteristics of the patient populations served. Recent studies of patterns of care document major shifts in treatment practices in the US and provide insight concerning the rate at which treatment changes are adopted at the community level.\r"

It is believed that most cancers can either be prevented or treated successfully if they are diagnosed early. Primary-care physicians and other health professionals delivering information on prevention and performing early diagnostic studies in various ambulatory settings represent the key to the reduced complications and mortality of cancer by virtue of their position in the health care delivery system within communities. Barriers and incentives for delivering these all important health measures are examined and suggestions are made for their accomplishment. It is recommended that the primary thrust should be toward the development of methodology which will allow the primary care physician to institute these measures in his regular medical practice and to coordinate them with other health maintenance and early diagnostic activities in the ambulatory setting.\r"

Evaluation of the patient's existing coping skills, perceived seriousness of the illness, anticipated loss of control over physical functioning, and available family support is an essential part of the treatment plan. Preparing the patient and family for diagnosis and treatment is enhanced by supportive intervention techniques such as provision of accurate information, exploration of the patient's fears and fantasies, restoration of degrees of control in the patient's life, and exposure to peer support groups.\r"

This includes hypofractionation, split course fractionation, hyperfractionation, accelerated hyperfractionation, and others. Various fractionation schemes are reviewed in terms of dose and time modification for the management of various gynecologic malignancies. Of these, accelerated hyperfractionation with 10% to 15% dose reduction from conventional or traditional once daily radiation therapy appears to hold the most promise. One and one half Grays per fraction, two fractions per day were used for whole pelvis irradiation and 1.0 Gy per fraction, two fractions per day were used for whole abdomen irradiation with 4 hours between fractions, 5 days a week.

In single rat ventricular myocytes, such spontaneous Ca2+ release appears localized rather than homogeneous. When the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ is present in a single locus within a cell, it causes a small depolarization, which, at the normal resting potential, is subthreshold for generating an action potential. However, when spontaneous Ca2+ release occurs simultaneously at more than a single discrete locus, the resultant sarcolemmal depolarization is augmented to levels that can induce an action potential, even when this depolarization begins at the normal resting membrane potential. Thus, the synchronous occurrence of multifocal localized increases in cytosolic Ca2+ due to spontaneous Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum within ventricular myocytes is a mechanism for \"abnormal automaticity.\"\r"

Eleven torso models with varying geometry and organ configurations have been studied. For the forward calculations, a standard dipole-like source is placed along the axis of the heart. Inverse calculations are performed using a measured body surface potential distribution and are based on a division of the surface of the heart into 25 source regions, producing epicardial potentials on these regions. A regularization method is used to stabilize the inverse solutions. Both forward and inverse solutions show substantial differences between models. These findings imply that matching models with patient geometry may be necessary in order to use such solutions in a clinical setting.\r"

Strips of portal vein were Na+ loaded for 3 hours at 37 degrees C in a K+-free 1 mM ouabain solution, after which rapid Na+ efflux was induced by washing with a Na+-free K+-Li+ solution (1 mM ouabain). Li+ washing Na+-loaded portal vein produced a large transient contraction accompanied by an increase (over 100-fold) in mitochondrial Ca2+ and also significant (p less than 0.05) increases in phosphorus and Mg2+. The Ca2+ loading of the mitochondria was reversed during prolonged Li+ wash, and by 2 hours, mitochondrial Ca2+, Mg2+, and phosphorus had returned to control levels. The maximal contractile response to stimulation remained normal, demonstrating that pathologic Ca2+ loading of mitochondria is reversible in situ and compatible with normal maximal force developed by the smooth muscle. Mitochondrial Ca2+ and phosphorus uptake were reduced but still significant when the Li+ wash contained 0.2 mM Ca2+ or when ouabain was omitted. The fact that mitochondrial Ca2+ loading accompanied submaximal contractions during 0.2 mM Ca2+-Li wash suggests \"supranormal\" affinity of mitochondria for Ca2+ and may be due, in part, to reverse operation of the mitochondrial Na+-Ca2+ exchanger. Mitochondrial Ca2+, Mg2+, and phosphorus uptake were eliminated when the Li+ wash was performed at 2 degrees C or when the wash contained no Ca2+.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Compared with normal control rats, anti-Fx1A-treated animals were characterized by marked proteinuria (65 +/- 8 micrograms/min versus 6 +/- 1, p less than 0.001), markedly and significantly higher glomerular transcapillary hydraulic pressure difference (40 +/- 1 mm Hg versus 33 +/- 1, p less than 0.001), depressed ultrafiltration coefficient and impaired glomerular size-selective function as determined by fractional clearance of dextrans. Calculation of membrane parameters based on a recently defined heteroporous membrane model revealed abnormally high availability of non-size selective, large pore pathways in the glomerular capillary wall of the rats with passive Heymann nephritis. To ascertain the role of the altered hemodynamic pattern in the observed defect in the size-selective function of the glomerular capillary wall, glomerular transcapillary hydraulic pressure difference was manipulated experimentally in these proteinuric rats by intra-aortic infusion of acetylcholine or angiotensin II. These agents respectively suppressed and augmented glomerular transcapillary hydraulic pressure difference and brought about a decline of and a further rise in fractional clearance of larger dextrans along with parallel changes in both urine protein excretion rate and availability of nonselective channels. These results indicate that the permselectivity defect in passive Heymann nephritis is attributable, at least in part, to impaired size selectivity of the glomerular capillary wall caused by a prevailing abnormally high transcapillary hydraulic pressure difference.\r"

However, species differences in the inotropic response to these agents have raised questions about the relationship between PDE III inhibition and cardiotonic activity. The present study demonstrates that these differences can be accounted for by the presence of two subclasses of PDE III in ventricular muscle and variations in the intracellular localization of these two enzymes. For these experiments, PDE III was initially isolated from canine, guinea pig, and rat left ventricular muscle. The results demonstrate that canine left ventricular muscle contains two functional subclasses of PDE III: an imazodan-sensitive form, which is membrane bound, and an imazodan-insensitive form, which is soluble. Although only weakly inhibited by imazodan, this latter enzyme is potently inhibited by the selective PDE III inhibitors, Ro 20-1724 and rolipram. Guinea pig ventricular muscle also contains the imazodan-sensitive subclass of PDE III. Unlike canine left ventricle, however, thi enzyme is soluble in the guinea pig. No membrane-bound subclass of PDE III was observed in the guinea pig. Rat left ventricle possesses only the soluble form of PDE III, which apparently represents a mixture of the imazodan-sensitive and imazodan-insensitive subclasses of PDE III. Measurement of in vivo contractility in these three species showed that imazodan exerts a potent positive inotropic effect only in the dog, in which the imazodan-sensitive subclass of PDE III is membrane bound.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The role of contracture in the manifestation of calcium paradox-induced damage was examined using 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM) to inhibit myofibrillar activity. Calcium and sodium gain, loss of intracellular components, and changes in structure were monitored. If 30 mM BDM was added at the time of calcium repletion after 10 minutes of calcium-free perfusion, some protection was afforded, particularly at the early stages of calcium repletion. However, much greater protection was obtained if BDM was present during the final 2 minutes of calcium-free perfusion and throughout repletion. Sodium gain and loss of intracellular components were markedly attenuated, as was the incidence of severely contracted cells. Calcium gain, although significantly reduced during the period of repletion, was not abolished. After 10 minutes of repletion, a calcium content of 11.44 +/- 1.57 mumol/g dry wt was observed. This suggests that other noncontracture related routes of calcium entry are involved. If BDM is removed after 5 minutes of calcium repletion and perfusion is continued with BDM-free perfusate, there is a rapid gain of sodium, further gain of calcium, loss of intracellular components and the cells contract severely, tearing away from neighboring cells. It is evident, therefore, that returning calcium to hearts after a period of calcium-free perfusion under conditions that significantly reduce the typical calcium paradox-associated damage does not necessarily repair the underlying defect. These results support the hypothesis that contracture-induced sarcolemmal disruption may be responsible for the terminal manifestation of the calcium paradox.\r"

In response to phenylephrine and clonidine, men showed significant dose-related vasoconstriction while women did not. In response to isoproterenol, men showed significant dose-related vasodilation while women did not. There were no sex differences in response to intra-arterial nitroglycerin or digoxin or to reactive hyperemia, procedures that do not act through adrenergic receptors. These data show that the sensitivity and/or density of peripheral vascular adrenergic receptors is lower in women than in men. There were no sex differences in response to reflex vasoconstriction or to intra-arterial tyramine, suggesting that neurally released norepinephrine acts at alpha-adrenergic receptors that are spatially removed from those that respond to circulating catecholamines.\r"

ACh (greater than 10(-7) M) transiently hyperpolarized the membrane (1-4 minutes) with an associated decrease in the membrane resistance, either in the presence or absence of NE, and these changes ceased during the continuous application of ACh. The ACh-induced transient hyperpolarization was not generated after mechanically removing the endothelium or by treatment with atropine. Oxotremorine (up to 10(-5) M) did not alter the membrane potential in the presence or absence of the endothelium. NE (10(-6) M) depolarized the smooth muscle membrane, which remained unchanged by additional application of ACh or oxotremorine for more than 5 minutes, or after removal of the endothelium. The excitatory junction potential generated by perivascular nerve stimulation was inhibited by ACh (greater than 10(-9) M) or oxotremorine (greater than 10(-9) M) in a concentration-dependent manner. These inhibitory actions of ACh or oxotremorine were blocked by atropine but were not affected by removal of the endothelial cells. These results suggest that the inhibitory actions of muscarinic agonists on electrical responses of smooth muscle cells of the rabbit saphenous artery were mainly indirect, i.e., a release of inhibitory substances from the endothelial cells and the inhibition of adrenergic transmission. The former required higher concentrations of ACh or oxotremorine, thereby suggesting that the latter may be more important for vasodilation related to cholinergic mechanisms.\r"

The adenine nucleotide pool of endothelial cells was selectively labelled by infusing 3H-adenosine (5 X 10(-8) M) into the heart for 30 minutes. Selective labelling of the endothelial adenine nucleotides was confirmed by measuring the relative specific activities of the nucleotides of coronary endothelial cells (removed from the heart by enzyme treatment). Endothelial ATP, ADP, and AMP had relative specific activities that were 49, 25, and 7 times higher, respectively, than their nucleotide counterparts in total myocardial tissue. Isoproterenol increased the release of both total adenosine and radioactive adenosine, but the relative specific activity of venous adenosine decreased dramatically. Acetylcholine, at a concentration that caused no change in left ventricular pressure but caused a decrease in coronary vascular resistance, increased the release of total adenosine. However, both radioactive adenosine release and the relative specific activity of venous effluent adenosine were decreased with acetylcholine. Infusion of hydrochloric acid caused a sustained reduction in left ventricular pressure and coronary vascular resistance. Total adenosine release fell within one minute and remained reduced during HCl. Radioactive adenosine release was elevated at 15 seconds but fell below control values at 2 minutes and remained reduced during steady-state acidosis. We conclude that the majority of the adenosine released in response to isoproterenol and acetylcholine originates from an unlabelled compartment, most likely the myocytes. Acidosis results in decreased release of adenosine from both the labelled endothelium and the unlabelled cells in the heart.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The data presented here confirm the hypothesis that hydroxyl free radical mediates this response and may be the endothelium-dependent relaxing factor for bradykinin in this microvascular bed. The response to a locally applied bolus of bradykinin (80 micrograms/ml) was monitored by intravital TV microscopy. The response was significantly inhibited or totally blocked by the presence of superoxide dismutase 60 U/ml, catalase 46 U/ml, or deferoxamine 0.1 or 0.2 mM. The superoxide dismutase scavenges superoxide radical, which is known to enter the subarachnoid space as a consequence of cyclooxygenase activation. Cyclooxygenase is activated by bradykinin. The superoxide can form H2O2, scavenged by catalase, and the two together generate hydroxyl. The formation of hydroxyl radical is catalyzed by iron. Deferoxamine 0.1 mM scavenges the iron, blocking the generation of hydroxyl. Deferoxamine 0.2 mM also directly scavenges the hydroxyl. None of the pharmacologic probes had an effect on arteriolar diameter when locally applied without bradykinin. Since the dilation produced by bradykinin was inhibited or totally blocked by probes that prevented hydroxyl formation or directly scavenged hydroxyl radical, that radical is either an essential mediator of the arteriolar relaxation, or is the endothelium-dependent relaxing factor for bradykinin in pial arterioles.\r"

Whole-cell calcium currents recorded at physiologic extracellular calcium concentrations were small (approximately 10 pA). Recordings with 110 mM external barium gave much larger currents and revealed two current components with properties similar to those in other vascular smooth muscle preparations and to the calcium currents designated as T and L in heart cells and neurons. T current was activated with weak depolarizations and inactivated rapidly, while L current was activated with relatively strong depolarizations and inactivated more slowly. L current was increased by dihydropyridine agonists and decreased by dihydropyridine antagonists, while T current was unaffected. Recordings from cell-attached and outside-out membrane patches with 100 mM external barium showed unitary calcium channel currents with conductances of 8 and 25 pS. The small conductance channels had kinetic properties that accounted for T current in the whole-cell recordings, while the 25-pS channels showed the voltage dependence, the time dependence, and the dihydropyridine sensitivity expected for L-type channels. We conclude that vascular smooth muscle cells contain two types of calcium channels with properties very similar to those described for T- and L-type calcium channels in other cell types; the L current appears to be the predominant current component in whole-cell recordings.\r"

However, the disulfide bond in the beta-receptor structure is accessible to solvent, while the disulfide bond within the alpha-receptor structure is \"masked\" and inaccessible to solvent. Reduction of this disulfide bond requires initial denaturation of the alpha 1-receptor.

By combining molecular and functional approaches, the purified dihydropyridine-receptor complex from rabbit skeletal muscle transverse-tubules can be reconstituted in phospholipid bilayer membranes to form a functional 20-pS calcium channel that retains the principal regulatory, biochemical, and pharmacologic properties of membrane-bound L-type calcium channels.\r"

The drug receptors show reciprocal allosteric communication and are linked to calcium binding sites. The 1,4-dihydropyridine-selective receptor (probed with [3H]nimodipine) has a size (measured by radiation inactivation) identical in heart, skeletal muscle, and brain (180 kDa). To compare the sizes of 1,4-dihydropyridine receptors in different tissues, pure tritiated enantiomers of the arylazido photoaffinity probe [3H]azidopine were used to irreversibly label the purified 1,4-dihydropyridine receptor (155, 65, and 32 kDa) from guinea pig skeletal muscle transverse tubules and the membrane-bound cardiac receptor. The 155 kDa polypeptide region, but not the 65 or 32 kDa bands, was specifically labelled by (-)-[3H]azidopine. (+)-[3H]Azidopine did not label any of the polypeptides in the purified receptor preparation. In contrast with the results from other investigators, a 155 kDa polypeptide was also specifically labelled in cardiac membranes by (-)-[3H]azidopine. A 34 kDa photolabelled band carries a low-affinity 1,4-dihydropyridine binding site that has no obvious relation to the channel but is abundant in heart membranes and has apparently led to erroneous results in previous affinity or photoaffinity labelling experiments. Antibodies raised against the purified skeletal muscle channel precipitate the 125I-labelled 155 kDa channel polypeptide from skeletal muscle and precipitate the three drug receptor sites from both crude and purified channel preparations. We conclude that all three drug receptor sites are localized on this polypeptide.\r"

Channel kinetics in PE and PS are characterized by the simultaneous presence of openings of long duration (greater than 200 msec) and openings of brief duration (less than 20 msec) grouped into bursts. Accordingly, exponential distributions of open-channel lifetimes could be fitted with at least two time constants. An increase in bilayer mole fraction of PS, from XPS = 0 (pure PE) to XPS = 1.0 (pure PS), decreased open-channel lifetimes by approximately twofold to threefold. Calculations using the Gouy-Chapman theory indicate that channel lifetimes do not correlate with bilayer surface potentials generated by PS.\r"

We studied the relations between locomotion (exercise) and phrenic nerve activity and arterial pressure in cats that walked or ran on a treadmill and in animals during fictive locomotion, i.e., locomotor activity in motor nerves to legs. Anesthetized cats with intact brains and unanesthetized decorticated cats were used. All preparations exhibited spontaneous actual and fictive locomotion. Electrical stimulation or microinjection of picrotoxin, a GABA antagonist, of the subthalamic locomotor areas always caused locomotion to develop. Phrenic nerve activity and arterial pressure increased in proportion to the level of locomotor activity despite control or ablation of feedback signals from chemoreceptors and vagal receptors. Similar relations were measured during fictive locomotion despite the absence of muscular contraction and limb movement and the lack of change in metabolic rate. These findings provide experimental support for the central command hypothesis for the genesis of the respiratory hyperpnea and increased cardiovascular function that occur during exercise. We believe that the command signals emanate from the subthalamic locomotor area of the diencephalon.\r"

Moreover, Group III and IV afferents are known to compose the afferent arm of this reflex arc. The present experiments investigated the discharge properties of Group III and IV afferents whose activation is responsible for the pressor reflex response to static contraction. In general, we found that Group III afferents were more responsive to mechanical stimuli, such as distortion of their receptive fields and tendon stretch, than were Group IV afferents. In contrast, Group IV afferents were more responsive to ischemic contraction than were Group III afferents. In addition, equal percents of Group III and IV afferents were found to be stimulated by increasing interstitial potassium to levels that were similar to those found during muscular contraction. The afferents' response to potassium adapted within seconds, while the interstitial concentration of this ion remained elevated for several minutes. This rapidly adapting response casts doubt on the effectiveness of potassium as the metabolite that signals blood supply and demand in a working muscle are improperly matched.\r"

  ".W": "Baroreceptors respond to distortion of their receptor regions by producing action potentials and, thus, provide information to the central nervous system for cardiovascular control. The mechanisms converting mechanical events to electrical signals are unknown. Since it has not been possible to record a receptor potential in the mechanosensitive terminals, studies rely on interpretation of axonal discharge of baroreceptor endings. In the present study, the ionic sensitivity of in vitro preparations of both low- and high-pressure receptors are compared in studies in which the ionic composition of the extracellular fluid is controlled. The results taken together with previous work suggest uniformity of response to calcium, sodium, and potassium across a variety of cardiovascular receptor types supporting common mechanoelectrical transduction mechanisms. Decreased extracellular sodium produced increased threshold and decreased slopes of pressure-discharge curves for both aortic arch baroreceptors and for low-pressure baroreceptors in the atrium. Results are consistent with data for other mechanoreceptors where it is believed that distortion activates a relatively poorly selective cation-conducting channel through the membrane. As with arterial baroreceptors, increases in external calcium levels caused a decrease in the excitability of atrial baroreceptors. Substitution of half the external calcium with the inorganic calcium channel blocker cobalt failed to alter baroreceptor function. Bay K 8644, a calcium channel agonist of the dihydropyridine class of calcium channel blockers, tended to inhibit baroreceptor discharge with effects consistent with smooth muscle activation within the vessel wall. Several hypotheses of potential underlying mechanisms are discussed. These new experiments are consistent with the results achieved with alterations of ionic calcium and suggest that calcium entry does not play a detectable role in baroreceptor transduction.\r"

These responses are impaired in rabbits with renal hypertension caused by impaired cardiopulmonary baroreflexes. Previous studies have suggested that there may be differences in the extent to which renal hypertension alters reflex control of lumbar as compared with renal sympathetic nerve activity. The goals of this study were to determine if the responses to volume expansion of lumbar sympathetic nerve traffic also are impaired in renal hypertension and if this abnormality, if present, is caused by abnormalities in the vagal cardiopulmonary baroreflex. Experiments were done in alpha-chloralose-anesthetized normotensive (n = 9) and renal hypertensive (n = 7; 1 kidney, 1 wrap) rabbits. Infusion of dextran in saline raised arterial and left atrial pressures in both groups and decreased lumbar nerve traffic by -4.4 +/- 0.4% mm Hg rise in arterial pressure in the normotensive group and by -1.5 +/- 0.1% mm Hg in the hypertensive group (p less than 0.01). These responses were nearly abolished by sinoaortic denervation in both groups. These data indicate that the responses of lumbar nerve traffic to volume expansion are impaired in renal hypertension; this is mainly because of impaired arterial baroreflexes since vagal cardiopulmonary baroreceptors have minimal influence on lumbar nerve traffic, even in normotensive rabbits. These findings for the lumbar nerves are strikingly different from those reported previously for reflex control of the renal nerves in both normotensive and hypertensive rabbits.\r"

The lowest dose of vasopressin (0.4 mU/kg X min), which had no significant effect on resting mean arterial pressure, heart rate, or renal sympathetic nerve activity, increased the inhibitory influence of arterial baroreflexes on renal sympathetic nerve activity in response to an increase in pressure. During infusions of higher doses of vasopressin (1.5 and 3.0 mU/kg X min), which significantly decreased resting heart rate and renal sympathetic nerve activity but had no significant effect on mean arterial pressure, the mean arterial pressure-renal sympathetic nerve activity relation showed a significant decrease in maximum renal sympathetic nerve activity when compared with control. The highest dose of vasopressin resulted in a significant shift of the relation to the left toward lower pressures and in a decrease in maximum gain. The relation exhibited a parallel shift toward lower pressure, with no change in gain, at the higher dose of vasopressin. Based on these results, we conclude that vasopressin exerted a dose-related effect on arterial baroreflex such that lower doses of vasopressin may sensitize the central baroreflex neurons to afferent input, while the higher doses of vasopressin caused direct excitations of these neurons, resulting in a reduction in resting sympathetic outflow.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine whether myocardial beta-adrenergic inotropic responsiveness is reduced in patients with severe congestive heart failure and markedly elevated plasma norepinephrine levels. To assess myocardial beta-adrenergic inotropic responsiveness, the beta-adrenergic agonist dobutamine was infused directly into the left main coronary artery, and the change in +dP/dt was measured as an index of change in inotropic state. Eight patients with severe New York Heart Association functional Class III and IV congestive heart failure were compared with 4 patients without significant congestive heart failure. The increase in +dP/dt at an intracoronary dobutamine infusion rate of 25 micrograms/min in patients with severe congestive heart failure was significantly less than in the patients without heart failure (heart failure, 33 +/- 8%; no heart failure, 69 +/- 12%; p less than 0.05). Although the maximum intracoronary dobutamine infusion rate was substantially higher in patients with heart failure (94 +/- 25 micrograms/min) compared with patients without heart failure (38 +/- 7 micrograms/min), the increase in +dP/dt at maximum infusion rates was also significantly less in patients with heart failure (heart failure, 52 +/- 8%; no heart failure, 93 +/- 24%; p less than 0.05). Plasma norepinephrine concentration was normal in the 4 patients without heart failure and was markedly elevated (range, 307-3,967 ng/l) in the patients with severe heart failure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In 6 normal subjects, plasma NE increased from 242 to 570 pg/ml, and NE clearance decreased from 1.43 to 1.00 l/min X M2. In 6 patients with congestive heart failure, there was no significant change in plasma NE during orthostatic stress. This has been interpreted previously to indicate that there was little activation of the baroreflex arc. In fact, NE clearance decreased from 1.08 to 0.79 l/min X M2; however, there was a decrease in NE spillover from 4.04 to 2.88 nmol/min X M2. A reduction of organ blood flow with tilt could be responsible for the reduced NE clearance by both groups, but the mechanism for the reduction in NE spillover with tilt in congestive heart failure is unclear.\r"

Patients were divided into 3 subgroups according to their basal ejection fraction (less than or equal to 35%, between 36 and 54%, and greater than or equal to 55%). After injection of a bolus of isoproterenol (2 micrograms), the isovolumic indexes of inotropic state increased significantly less in patients with an ejection fraction less than or equal to 35% than in other patients, but the heart rate changes and the acceleration in the rate of isovolumic pressure fall were comparable in all subgroups. The dose-response curves to cumulative doses of xamoterol, a beta 1-adrenoceptor partial agonist, confirmed that the magnitude of the inotropic response was reduced during beta 1-stimulation in patients with an ejection fraction less than or equal to 35% when compared with patients with a greater ejection fraction. However, the dose of xamoterol necessary to produce 50% of the maximal inotropic response was not increased in patients with an ejection fraction less than or equal to 35% (range, 1.5-5.2 micrograms/kg; median 2.5 vs. median values of 2.3 and 3.3 micrograms/kg in the other subgroups; NS), and there was no shift to the right of the dose-response curve. It is concluded that in moderate ischemic heart failure, the magnitude of the inotropic response to isoproterenol or xamoterol is reduced. The absence of shift to the right of the dose-response curve to a beta 1-partial agonist suggests that this alteration in myocardial performance is not primarily caused by a decrease in beta-adrenoceptor responsiveness.\r"

By varying the terminal portion of the 2:1 atrial train and using the extrastimulus technique, we characterized atrioventricular nodal (AVN) conduction and refractoriness after five different methods of AVN activation: a conducted beat (method I), a conducted beat with omission of the prior blocked beat (method II), a blocked beat (method III), a blocked beat \"converted\" to one that conducts by omission of the prior conducted beat (method IV), and finally, 1:1 conduction at twice the cycle length of the 2:1 train (control method V). Observed AVN conduction times obeyed the following relationship: method I greater than method II greater than method V, indicating a cumulative effect of concealed penetration by the blocked beats. During 2:1 block, the AVN effective refractory period (ERP) alternated with a mean beat-to-beat difference of at least 100 msec, due mostly to marked ERP abbreviation during AVN activation by method III (vs both 2:1 train cycle length and activation by method V). Concealed penetration by the blocked beat prolonged AVN ERP for the propagated beat (vs that with methods II and V), but to a lesser extent than conduction time was increased. Moreover, the AVN recovery curve with method I was displaced upward and to the right compared with that with methods II to V.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Wall motion abnormalities were detected in all patients by the integrative analysis. In contrast, the sensitivity for detecting wall motion abnormalities was 80% during chronic infarction, 77% during impending infarction, and 56% during transient ischemia if only end-diastolic and end-systolic frames were compared for assessment of overall regional systolic function. There were distinct differences in the time course of abnormal wall excursion between the three groups. Chronic infarction was characterized by a monophasic contraction pattern, with abnormal synergy in regional contractile events occurring predominantly during early systole. In contrast, transient ischemia caused predominantly mid-to-late systolic abnormal synergy followed by late systolic shortening corresponding to a polyphasic contraction pattern. During impending infarction, an intermediate temporal contraction pattern was present with both early and mesosystolic abnormal synergy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Severity and site of mitral regurgitation was evaluated by the real-time two-dimensional Doppler flow imaging technique in 81 patients with old myocardial infarction. The incidence of mitral regurgitation did not depend on the region of infarction. There was, however, a close relationship between the site of regurgitation and the region of infarction. In patients with mitral regurgitation spurting from the posteromedial area of the valve, the inferior wall was involved in infarction without exception and in some of these patients, the posteromedial papillary muscle was also found to be affected by myocardial infarction; in those with regurgitation spurting from the anterolateral area, the anterior wall showed asynergy. On the other hand in patients with mitral regurgitation spurting from the central area, the region of infarction varied. In these patients, however, the larger the diameter of the mitral anulus, the more severe the grade of regurgitation. The extent of asynergy was another factor related to the severity of mitral regurgitation. Both longitudinally and transversely, broad infarction leads to the enlargement of the mitral anulus. However, even if the mitral anulus is not so dilated, severe involvement of either commissural area results in severe mitral regurgitation from the same commissural side. Thus, there are two major causative factors of mitral regurgitation: (1) asynergy of the papillary muscle or the ventricle that results in mitral regurgitation located in the commissural area of the same side as asynergy, and (2) enlargement of mitral anulus, which results in regurgitation from the central area of the orifice.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

An apparent relationship between the dynamic behavior of the pressure gradient and subsequent acute vessel closure was observed in our catheterization laboratory. We therefore examined the usefulness of the pressure gradient trend in predicting acute complications after 463 attempted PTCA procedures. Two pressure gradient trend patterns were identified: (1) a rising trend pattern identified by an increasing pressure gradient in the interval after deflation of the angioplasty, and (2) a stable trend pattern identified by a constant or decreasing pressure gradient. The incidence of acute vessel closure (17% vs 4%, p = .0001), emergency CABG (5.6% versus 1%, p less than .05), and myocardial infarction (13% versus 2%, p less than .0001) after the PTCA procedure was significantly higher among patients with rising trend patterns when compared with patients with stable trend patterns. Multivariate analysis identified independent predictors for an acute closure event as rising trend pattern (p less than .001), post-PTCA gradient (p less than .05), and post-PTCA percent diameter stenosis (p less than .02). Independent predictors for emergency coronary artery bypass grafting and myocardial infarction were post-PTCA gradient (p less than .001) and a rising trend pattern (odds ratio = 2.91, p less than .001), respectively. The dynamic behavior of the gradient trend provides additional useful information about the results of dilatation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The value of serial electropharmacologic testing during long-term oral amiodarone therapy for prediction of long-term drug efficacy as well as characteristics of arrhythmia recurrence is controversial. One-hundred four consecutive patients with coronary artery disease and sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT) underwent initial electrophysiologic (EP) evaluation in the drug-free state and again after an amiodarone loading period of 25 +/- 14 days (mean +/- SD). Twenty-six patients (25%) had no inducible ventricular tachyarrhythmia during therapy with amiodarone (VT control group), whereas arrhythmia inducibility persisted in the remaining 78 patients (VT noncontrol group). During 17.4 +/- 13.7 months of follow-up, two patients in the VT control group either had VT recurrence or died suddenly compared with 21 VT recurrences and eight sudden cardiac deaths in the VT noncontrol group (actuarial event rates at 36 months of 0.11 and 0.56, respectively, p = .0065). The cycle lengths of recurrent VT in these 21 patients in the VT noncontrol group were compared with those observed at final EP testing. A significant linear correlation was demonstrated (r = .76, p = .0001). Subgroup analysis of patients in the VT noncontrol group showed no EP predictors of outcome, including cycle length of induced VT. However, patients dying suddenly during the follow-up period had a higher prevalence of new or worsening congestive heart failure (75%) compared with patients with VT recurrence (19%) or those with no arrhythmic event (29%) (p less than .02).2off\r"

Class III effects (increases in anterograde and retrograde accessory connection effective refractory periods, ventricular effective refractory period, and the QT interval during fixed-rate atrial pacing) were evident at the beta-adrenoceptor-blocking dosage of sotalol and became more marked at the maximum well-tolerated dosage. For example, the mean anterograde accessory connection effective refractory period was significantly increased over control (272 +/- 41 msec) by the beta-adrenoceptor blocker (324 +/- 52 msec) and was further significantly increased by the maximum well-tolerated dose (364 +/- 37 msec). Similarly, the minimum preexcited RR interval during atrial fibrillation was increased in all patients at each dosage tested. Antiarrhythmic efficacy, defined by the absence of inducible, sustained, orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia and a minimum preexcited RR interval during atrial fibrillation of 300 msec or greater, was achieved in four patients at the beta-adrenoceptor-blocking dosage and in another four patients at the maximum well-tolerated dosage.

Left ventricular/body weight ratios were 6.15 +/- 0.59 g/kg in the hypertensive animals and 6.87 +/- 0.47 g/kg in dogs with aortic banding, as compared with 4.23 +/- 0.23 g/kg in seven normal dogs (p less than .01).

Diastolic aortic pressure was increased in animals with hypertension but not in dogs with aortic banding. Systolic ejection period was prolonged in dogs with aortic banding but not in hypertensive dogs. Mean blood flow per gram of myocardium measured with microspheres was similar at rest and during light exercise in all three groups of animals, whereas during heavy exercise blood flow was significantly greater than normal in both groups with hypertrophy. In normal dogs subendocardial/subepicardial (endo/epi) flow ratios did not change significantly during exercise. In both groups with hypertrophy, endo/epi ratios were normal at rest but decreased significantly during exercise.

The results were compared with those from four time-controlled and sham-operated dogs. ETV, as measured by a double-indicator technique, increased from 8.1 +/- 0.8 ml/kg at a pericardial pressure of 0 mm Hg to 12.9 +/- 2.1 ml/kg at 11.0 mm Hg (p less than .01). In the control group, ETV increased from 6.5 +/- 0.7 to 8.2 +/- 0.5 ml/kg over an equal time span. This increase in ETV in the experimental dogs was inversely related to pulmonary compliance, which decreased by 29% as ETV increased (p less than .05), whereas in the time-controlled group of animals it decreased by 8.8%. Arterial PO2 did not deteriorate during the protocol in either group. Histologic examination showed increased interstitial fluid, but neither alveolar fluid nor septal edema, and gravimetric measurements of lung liquid were also consistent with interstitial fluid accumulation in experimental but not control animals. These findings are concordant with the clinical observation that alveolar edema is rarely seen in the presence of pericardial tamponade. Conceivably, progression from interstitial to alveolar edema did not occur both because of the low pulmonary blood flow that occurs as part of pericardial tamponade physiology and/or because the hydrostatic pressures were not elevated enough to produce higher rates of fluid transudation.\r"

Echocardiographic radiofrequency images of anterior myocardium were obtained serially during complete coronary occlusion for 2 hr (n = 15) or 5 hr (n = 10), or after temporary coronary clamping for 15 min with release for 1 hr (n = 5). We investigated two variables: the cyclic backscatter power and the phase difference among endocardial wall motion (EWM), cyclic backscatter power (BSP), and left ventricular pressure (LVP). The cyclic BSP decreased from a control (nonischemic) level of 5.1 +/- 0.8 to 2.3 +/- 0.7 dB during ischemia (up to 30 min after coronary ligation). The phase difference between the EWM and BSP progressed from a control (nonischemic) value of 38 +/- 20 to 115 +/- 23 degrees during ischemia. For the infarction period (2 to 5 hr after coronary ligation), the cyclic BSP progressively returned toward baseline control levels to 4.0 +/- 1.2 dB, but the phase had increased further to 170 +/- 28 degrees. The reperfusion study showed a similar decrease in cyclic BSP and an increase in phase after arterial clamping and both returned to near-normal nonischemic values upon arterial release. Simultaneous LVP recordings were performed to assess the phase contribution of endocardial dyskinesis to the total phase difference measurement. At 5 hr the dyskinesis had contributed 46% to the total phase difference, while the backscatter power contributed 54%. However, the EWM contribution occurred immediately while BSP contribution changed progressively during the 5 hr study period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We compared the functional alterations in Purkinje (P) and ventricular muscle (VM) activation early (24 hr) and late (4 weeks or greater) after permanent coronary occlusion in an in vitro preparation of canine papillary muscle. High-density extracellular (1 to 2 mm resolution) and selected intracellular recordings were made in five animals early and seven animals late during stimulation of a free-running P strand. Activation patterns of P and VM layers from ischemic and unaffected papillary muscles were compared in the same animal. Average P layer conduction velocity was determined in normal and ischemic regions with the use of a linear array of recording and stimulating electrodes. Purkinje activation was altered little in the early phase of infarction, while healing was associated with a generalized 25% reduction in P layer conduction velocity and localized block and fragmentation of P waveforms. Intracellular recordings at sites of nonsynchronous P activation revealed electrotonic interaction between cell groups. At 24 hr, small groups of VM were present but with abnormal activation patterns in regions of necrosis with fragmented and delayed extracellular waveforms produced by partially uncoupled groups of cells. Local delay and block could be modulated by rate and site of stimulation. After healing, VM activation abruptly stopped at the visual infarct border, marked by a characteristic \"end potential.\" These studies demonstrate important differences in the functional attributes of the P and VM layers studied early and late after coronary occlusion. Alterations in cell-to-cell relationships are likely very important in determining abnormalities of activation in both settings.\r"

The experiments were done in 10 open-chest, anesthetized, previously splenectomized dogs in which changes in pericardial surface pressure in response to intravenous sodium nitroprusside and angiotensin were related to changes in blood volume in the abdominal region. Blood volume was determined by blood pool scintigraphy (99mTc) and regions of interest were drawn in the liver and in the mesenteric area. Angiotensin was infused at rates that were adjusted to increase mean aortic pressure by 20 and 30 mm Hg, and nitroprusside was infused at rates to decrease mean aortic pressure by 30 and 50 mm Hg. Angiotensin increased pericardial pressure by 3 and 5 mm Hg at the respective doses and there were increments in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and left ventricular diameter (sonomicrometry). Angiotensin decreased blood volume in the mesenteric region by 14% and 17%, but did not significantly change blood volume in the liver region. Angiotensin increased portal venous pressure and decreased mesenteric blood volume, suggesting decreased mesenteric venous compliance. Nitroprusside had opposite effects: pericardial pressure was decreased by 5.5 and 6.5 mm Hg by the respective doses. The doses of nitroprusside increased blood volume in the mesenteric region by 14% and 20%, but did not significantly change blood volume in the liver region.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Intracoronary stent devices offer the possibility of treatment for this sequela. We developed a balloon catheter-mounted, flexible coil stent for use in such cases. To determine the utility of this device and its immediate and long-term influence on arterial patency, 39 mongrel dogs had the stent placed after PTCA of the left circumflex or left anterior descending coronary arteries. Thirteen animals were treated before and after the procedure with warfarin. In this group there were three early deaths associated with stent thrombosis. Twenty-six animals were subsequently treated before and after with aspirin and dipyridamole. There were no early thrombotic events associated with stent placement in these animals. Late arteriographic examination revealed patent vessels in all dogs. Diameter stenosis for warfarin-treated dogs was 8 +/- 5% (mean +/- SD) at 2 months (n = 9), 6 +/- 4% at 6 months (n = 5), and 11 +/- 7% at 12 months (n = 3). Diameter stenosis for aspirin/dipyridamole-treated dogs was 9 +/- 3% at 2 months (n = 8), 8 +/- 5% at 6 months (n = 12), and 5% at 12 months (n = 1). Light and scanning electron microscopic analyses of stented arteries demonstrated incorporation of the stent wires into the arterial wall. Early findings included mild thrombosis localized to areas of wire entrenchment followed by rapid regrowth of endothelial and/or pseudoendothelial cells over trenches, exposed wires, and elastica.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88002761\r", 
  ".W": "Reperfusion of ischemic myocardium has been postulated to result in a specific oxygen radical-mediated component of tissue injury. In a previous study we demonstrated improved recovery of ventricular function and metabolism when the superoxide radical scavenger superoxide dismutase was administered at the time of postischemic reflow. Studies in vitro, have suggested that superoxide toxicity might be mediated via the generation of more reactive hydroxyl radicals in an iron-catalyzed reaction. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that myocardial reperfusion injury might be reduced by administration of the iron chelator deferoxamine at the time of reflow, most likely by preventing hydroxyl radical formation. Sixteen isolated Langendorff rabbit hearts, perfused within the bore of a superconducting magnet, were subjected to 30 min of normothermic (37 degrees C) total global ischemia followed by 45 min of reperfusion. At reflow eight treated hearts received a 10 ml bolus containing 50 mumol of deferoxamine followed by an infusion of 11 mumol/min for the first 15 min of reflow. The hearts were then perfused with standard perfusate for an additional 30 min. Eight untreated control hearts received a similar bolus of perfusate followed by 45 min of standard reperfusion. Serial 5 min 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were recorded. Myocardial phosphocreatine (PCr) content fell to 5% to 7% of control during ischemia in both groups of hearts. Deferoxamine-treated hearts recovered 99 +/- 10% of control PCr content, while untreated hearts recovered 60 +/- 16% (p less than .05). Intracellular pH fell to 5.9 during ischemia in both groups, before showing more rapid and complete recovery in treated hearts (p less than .01). Recovery of developed pressure reached 70 +/- 6% of control in treated hearts compared with 35 +/- 10% in untreated hearts (p less than .05). Iron content of the perfusate was 7 microM, and by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy was in the form of Fe3+-EDTA complexes. In the effluent of treated hearts iron was in the form of Fe3+-deferoxamine chelates. In summary, administration of the iron chelator deferoxamine at the time of postischemic reflow results in greater recovery of myocardial function and energy metabolism, which supports the hypothesis that iron plays an important role in the pathogenesis of reperfusion injury.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of two antianginal drugs, nicorandil and isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), on metabolism and function of the ischemic myocardium were studied in a preparation of multiple coronary occlusions in barbital-anesthetized dogs. The preparation consisted of three 5 min occlusions of the left anterior descending coronary artery interspersed by 30 min of reperfusion. An equihypotensive dose of nicorandil (7.5 micrograms/kg/min) or ISDN (12.5 micrograms/kg/min) was infused 15 min before and during the second occlusion period. Hemodynamics, myocardial segment shortening (%SS), tissue blood flow, and myocardial oxygen consumption were determined throughout. Uptake of free fatty acids (FFA), glucose, and lactate were determined during control and ischemic periods. At the end of the final 30 min reperfusion period, biopsy samples of transmural tissue were taken for analysis of phosphocreatine, adenine nucleotides, and total tissue water content. No major hemodynamic changes were produced by either drug except for a 5 to 10 mm Hg decrease in mean aortic pressure. Compared with untreated and ISDN-treated hearts, hearts of dogs treated with nicorandil exhibited reversal of a significant increase in FFA uptake during recurrent ischemia. This was accompanied by an attenuation of the increase in oxygen extraction and CO2 production in the ischemic zone by nicorandil, but not by ISDN. Nicorandil, but not ISDN, improved %SS during reperfusion. Endocardial ATP and total adenine nucleotides were preserved in both nicorandil- and ISDN-treated hearts. Tissue edema was also attenuated by both compounds. Thus, nicorandil improved both function and metabolism during recurrent myocardial ischemia independent of a hemodynamic effect, whereas ISDN only attenuated the loss of adenine nucleotides and increase in tissue water.\r"

Therefore, we instrumented 14 dogs at sterile surgery with sonomicrometers arrayed to measure systolic wall thickening across the perfusion boundary produced by circumflex coronary occlusion. We fitted sigmoid curves to the data to model the distribution of wall thickening impairment as a function of distance from the perfusion boundary, which was delineated with myocardial blood flow (15 micron diameter microspheres) maps. Using this approach, we defined the functional border zone as the distance from the perfusion boundary to 97.5% of the sigmoid curve's nonischemic asymptote. The lateral extent of the functional border zone, measured 10 min and 3 hr after occlusion, was 32 and 28 degrees of circumference, respectively. To evaluate the severity of nonischemic dysfunction, we measured average systolic wall thickening within the functional border zone. It was reduced from 3.69 +/- 1.10 (mean +/- SD) mm to 2.98 +/- 1.07 mm (p less than .01) and 2.74 +/- 1.12 mm (p less than .01) early and late after coronary occlusion. Thus, a narrow functional border zone was evident during circumflex coronary occlusion in conscious dogs. Its lateral extent was limited to approximately 30 degrees (similar to findings in open-chest, anesthetized dogs), severe dysfunction was restricted to the immediate vicinity of the perfusion boundary, and the average severity of nonischemic dysfunction within the functional border zone was mild.\r"

With the use of an open-chest dog model, a critical stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery was produced with total ablation of hyperemic response to a 15 sec period of complete occlusion. Regional left ventricular wall thickening was assessed by quantitative two-dimensional echocardiography. Regional myocardial blood flow was determined by microspheres in both the flow-restricted left circumflex area and the control area supplied by the left anterior descending artery. Eight dogs received 15 micrograms/kg/min dobutamine intravenously for 10 min, and nine dogs received 0.14 mg/kg/min dipyridamole intravenously for 4 min. Dobutamine induced wall thickening abnormalities in all dogs while dipyridamole induced dysfunction in only 55% of the animals studied (p less than .01). Subendocardial blood flow to the left circumflex area was unchanged after both dobutamine and dipyridamole when compared with baseline blood flow. However, subendocardial blood flow increased markedly after dipyridamole in the control area.

  ".U": "88002765\r", 
  ".W": "We have reported previously that thromboxane A2/prostaglandin (PG)H2 and serotonin independently mediate the occurrence of cyclic flow variations (CFVs) in a canine preparation of severe coronary artery narrowing. This may be due to an effect of these substances on platelets and/or the vascular wall. We tested the hypothesis that there is a cooperative effect between thromboxane A2/PGH2 and serotonin receptor stimulation in the development of CFVs in this animal preparation. After placement of a hard plastic cylindrical constrictor around the left anterior descending coronary artery, CFVs develop and are characterized by repetitive cycles of declines in coronary blood flow and abrupt increases in flow. In a control group of dogs, CFV frequency (cycles/hour) and severity (lowest coronary blood flow just before its restoration) did not change significantly over a 3 hr interval. In a second group of dogs, CFVs were established after constrictor placement, abolished with the serotonin (5HT2) receptor antagonist ketanserin, and reestablished by the continuous infusion of serotonin into the left atrium. Serotonin-induced CFVs were then abolished with a thromboxane A2/PGH2 receptor antagonist, SQ29,548, or a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, dazoxiben (UK37,248). The relative specificity of the respective antagonists, SQ29,548 and ketanserin, was determined in canine platelets and rat aortic vascular strips. No significant cross-reactivity between ketanserin and SQ29,548 was found. Thus, the data obtained in these studies demonstrate a cooperative interaction between thromboxane A2/PGH2 and serotonin S2 receptors that contributes to the development of CFVs in this experimental preparation.\r"

Although vitamin B6 repletion led to no demonstrable effect on the clinical course of the syndrome, in view of the possible role which vitamin B6 deficiency may play in defective immune response and thromboembolic phenomena, both being known complications of the nephrotic syndrome, the administration of vitamin B6 supplements is recommended in the active disease state.\r"

Dopamine increased ERPF but the associated rise in GFR was not significant. There was a significant decrease in both ERPF and GFR on LPD. The change in GFR during dopamine infusion, but not during LPD, correlated inversely with baseline GFR. Dopamine and LPD had no effect on heart rate or blood pressure and LPD did not alter urinary sodium excretion. These results suggest that the single kidney lacks functional reserve capacity and that protein restriction may be useful in preserving long term function.\r"

Yet in the three patients all non-sclerosed glomeruli were normal on light microscopy and glomerular immunofluorescence was negative. All three showed a good clinical response to steroids. It is clear from our findings that, in the elderly, clinical criteria are not a reliable guide to renal histology and may lead to a potentially treatable condition, minimal change nephropathy, being overlooked. Because of the high incidence of side effects, a trial of steroids in the elderly is hazardous. From the evidence given we conclude that renal biopsy, in adults with nephrotic syndrome, becomes increasingly useful with advancing age.\r"

Eight patients who had a surgical release of the suprascapular ligament had good and excellent results. Except in rare cases, a positive electromyogram (EMG) including a delayed nerve conduction (using a coaxial needle) is necessary confirming evidence of the need for surgical treatment. The recommended surgical technique involves detaching the trapezius muscle from the spine of the scapula and opening the space overlying the suprascapular ligament. The trapezius is retracted cephalad while the supraspinatus is retracted caudad. This exposure avoids injury to the spinal accessory nerve and promotes a rapid rehabilitation. Suprascapular nerve entrapment should be suspected and included in the differential diagnosis of ill-defined shoulder pain.\r"

Three different techniques were employed to perform the acromioplasties. The first technique required partial deltoid origin detachment with an osteotome. The second technique spared the deltoid origin, while again using an osteotome to perform the acromioplasty. The third technique also spared the deltoid origin but used a high-speed burr to perform the acromioplasty. Evaluated in terms of patient satisfaction, residual pain, length of convalescence, suboptimal results, and complications, the first technique proved to be the least effective. The second technique produced early, excellent results. The third technique, in which a burr was employed through an intact deltoid origin, was most effective; technically, the method was also relatively simple and reliable.\r"

Only a small portion of the spinal nerve before its decent and positioning anterior to the transverse process is subject to insult by an instrument introduced into the intervertebral disc through a posterolateral approach. The chance of injury to the spinal nerve is further minimized when the instruments are introduced a distance of approximately 9-10 cm from the midline, parallel to the vertebral plates, and penetrating the annulus at 10 o'clock or 2 o'clock. The rapid decline of intradiscal pressure after dorsolateral fenestration of the annulus appears to be an important factor in the relief of sciatic pain following percutaneous posterolateral discectomy. The evacuation and decompression of an extruded intervertebral disc with a straight instrument may not be possible. Patients with sequestered disc require laminectomy.\r"

The authors surveyed 10% of American orthopedists and the chiefs of training programs and/or major teaching hospitals to assess current practices. The average practicing orthopedist responding was 44-years-old and had performed 17.6 total hip arthroplasties and treated operatively 30.6 hip fractures per year during the last five years. The average responding chief surgeon, was 49 years old and had performed 49 total hip arthroplasties and treated operatively 20.5 hip fractures per year during the last five years. Most surgeons use pharmacologic prophylaxis or external pneumatic compression for total hip arthroplasty patients (84.4%) and hip fracture patients (74%). Warfarin has been tried and abandoned by 50% of all respondents, largely because of bleeding complications. Aspirin was the most popular agent.

These cases were unusual in that a long asymptomatic period intervened between the primary bacteremic illness and the subsequent prosthetic infection. Patients with prosthetic joints who develop bacteremic infection at extraarticular sites should be treated promptly and aggressively with appropriate antibiotics. Prophylactic antibiotics should be strongly considered in the patient with a prosthetic joint who undergoes procedures likely to be associated with a bacteremia. Transient arthralgias at the time of bacteremia may represent the onset of the joint infection and should not be overlooked or attributed a priori to the patient's underlying arthritic or medical condition.\r"

  ".W": "An instrumented clinical testing device developed at UCLA records a continuous anteroposterior force versus displacement curve of the tibia with respect to the femur at 20 degrees of flexion. Laxity and stiffness are calculated from the response curve. With this device, 95% of normal knees have an anterior laxity less than 7.5 mm and a side-to-side difference less than 2 mm. In contrast, an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) absent knee has a mean anterior laxity of 10 mm and a mean side-to-side difference of 5 mm. In a small group of patients with an intraarticular ACL substitution using the medial or lateral one-third of the patellar tendon, laxity and stiffness of the injured knees were returned to within the normal range and remained constant three years after surgery. In a group of 76 patients treated with ACL substitution using the torn meniscus, 51% of the patients still had an anterior laxity outside the normal range 3.5 years after surgery. In a preliminary study of 19 patients receiving a Gore-Tex synthetic ACL substitution, 55% of the patients still had a side-to-side difference greater than 2 mm two years after the procedure. These studies illustrate the advantages of impartial, objective measurements of knee stability. Laxity and stiffness values can supplement, but never replace, a thorough patient examination and patient history. As sports medicine matures as a scientific discipline, improved instrumented test devices may ultimately provide a standardized means for reporting knee stability parameters.\r"

  ".W": "A relationship exists between anterior shoulder subluxation and thoracic outlet syndrome that is responsible for the more florid symptoms of dead arm syndrome (DAS) in some patients. This relationship was demonstrated in eight of 27 patients (30%) in a consecutive series of Bankart operations for treatment of subluxation. The mechanism is associated with a disturbance in the kinesiology of the shoulder-joint complex that alters the position of the scapula relative to the rib cage and neurovascular supply to the upper limb. Therapy is directed toward restoration of the stability of the glenohumeral joint so that normal biomechanics can be reestablished. In advanced stages of thoracic outlet syndrome, however, DAS may initially require surgical decompression of the nerves and vessels. Careful attention to postural mechanics is essential for rational diagnosis and treatment of DAS.\r"

The angular deformity of the tibia is equal to the sum of the angular malalignments formed by the knee and ankle joints in relation to the horizontal plane. These malalignments are not equal. A larger percentage of the deformity is reflected inferiorly as the deformity approaches the ankle joint. A table was formulated to provide the corresponding degrees of joint malalignment (knee and ankle) for tibial angular deformities at different positions along the tibia. The analysis provides a useful tool to quantify the knee and ankle joint malalignments secondary to tibial angular malunion. Although designation of prognosis at different degrees of angular deformity is beyond the scope of this study, it does provide improved correlation between tibial angular deformities and the clinical outcome, e.g., degenerative arthroses of the adjacent joints, in future studies on tibial fractures.\r"

Patients without patellae who lack these favorable prognostic factors for a successful TKA should be strongly considered for bracing or primary arthrodesis, rather than knee arthroplasty.\r"

  ".W": "Knee motion of four healthy teenagers was unilaterally impaired by means of cast braces. Computerized analysis from video recording of walking was used to study the compensatory effects and to compare them with six patients. Restricted knee flexion caused little change in stance-phase knee motion on the restricted side. The unimpaired knee displayed exaggerated stance phase flexion and phase shifts, which in turn produced pelvic vaulting. The forces on the braces were high. Impairments to extension produced bilateral crouch without loss of flexion extension patterns within the limits of the impairment. Fatigue was more prominent than with blocks to flexion. Circumduction was found to be overrated as a compensation for stiff-leggedness. Lateral shift to the well side, combined with freezing of the well-side stance adduction, was a frequently used effective clearance mechanism. Phasic changes in motion of many body parts may combine to produce low-level pelvic displacement, especially when clinical weakness is present. Shortened stride length is the most sensitive indicator of this phenomenon. Graphs of individual joint motion do not easily convey the important phasic relationships that are fundamental to that motion and to the interpretation of its effects. Stick figures were better for analysis of this aspect of motion analysis, even though they are more subjective.\r"

A nidus in this location is not easily accessible, and its proximity to the joint surface raised concerns about damage to the tibial plateau. To facilitate excision of the tumor, cadaveric dissections were performed to develop a limited posterior approach to the proximal, lateral portion of the tibia. The CAT scan was used to calculate the precise dimensions of the tumor and its relation to the posterior tibial cortex and the proximal tibiofibular joint. With the use of the exposure developed in the laboratory and the calculations derived from the CAT scan, the tumor could be excised by removing a single block of bone 15 mm3. Intraoperative radiographs confirmed the presence of the nidus within the excised block of bone. This case report reaffirms the frequent difficulties and tardiness in diagnosing osteoid osteomas and the need to include these tumors in the differential diagnosis of knee pain and epiphyseal lesions. Before CAT scans were used, the working diagnoses were torn meniscus, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and bone hemangiomatosis.\r"

The pathologic process usually occurs in large joints and is reversible with the discontinuation of the anticoagulant medication. The condition presented for consideration here is unusual for two reasons. First, it is relatively uncommon for the ankle joint to be involved. Second, the destructive arthritis progressed after the medication was discontinued. Resting the involved joint until symptoms subside is often adequate treatment for anticoagulant-induced hemarthrosis. In an 84-year-old man, an arthrodesis was necessary to achieve a symptom-free ankle joint. Hemarthrosis secondary to anticoagulant medication may not be a benign disease process.\r"

The pin configuration in this model is constructed to allow an angular separation of the fixator pins. The mechanical effect of this angular separation and of the distribution of the pins along the fixator bar is examined. The model shows that an angular separation of the pins provides a more symmetric deformation of the fracture site when a bending load is applied in different directions to the bone and thereby protects a fracture from excessive movement in any direction. The torsional stability of an external fixation frame is considerably increased by incorporating an angular separation of the pins. The model also shows that the most stable configuration for the fixator uses a wide separation of the pins along the fixator bar.\r"

The segments were then cultured. Only the povidone-iodine/autoclave and chlorhexidine gluconate/orthopedic antibiotic solution treatments were 100% effective in eliminating bacterial growth. Contaminated extruded segments of long bones can be adequately sterilized for reimplantation by surgical cleansing with chlorhexidine gluconate followed by brief soaking in antibiotic solution.\r"

There was a statistically significant difference between the mean pore sizes obtained from the four particle size ranges. There were no differences between the mean porosities. The porous-coated specimens were embedded in bone cement and mechanical push-out testing was performed. Non-coated specimens having a satin surface finish were also embedded in bone cement and tested. The noncoated metal specimens displayed an interface shear strength of 4.2 +/- 0.4 MPa, whereas the shear strengths for the porous-coated specimens were significantly higher and increased as pore size increased. The mean interface shear strengths determined were 17.0 +/- 2.1 MPa (165 microns pore size), 18.1 +/- 2.3 MPa (285 micron pore size), 23.6 +/- 1.7 MPa (345 microns pore size), and 25.4 +/- 3.4 MPa (550 microns pore size). Significant differences in shear strength for the porous-coated specimens were found between the two smaller particle sizes and the two larger particle sizes. As pore size increased from 285 microns to 345 microns, a statistically significant increase in shear strength from 18.1 MPa to 23.6 MPa was observed.\r"

Joints fused for paralysis were excluded. No patient was able to work overhead or with arms abducted as required for activities such as hammering, house painting, or climbing a ladder. Many patients had difficulty functioning at head level for hygienic purposes. Many were unable to perform functions behind the back, although waist-level function approached normal. The position of rotation was the most critical factor in approaching optimum function. Fusions in positions of internal rotation reduced the ability to comb hair, wash the face, or to otherwise use the hand at head level. Fusion in a position of excessive external rotation made it impossible for the patient to reach the opposite axilla or belt buckle. There was a range of acceptability of abduction of forward flexion that did not appear to compromise the eventual functional result. The recommended position is 25 degrees to 40 degrees abduction, 20 degrees to 30 degrees flexion, and 25 degrees to 30 degrees of internal rotation. Even at the ideal position, shoulder fusion produces significant limitations in function. For patients with painful, nonfunctional shoulders who need arthrodesis, these limitations should be clearly discussed, along with the pros and cons of surgical treatment in general.\r"

Nineteen children (ten males, nine females) with onset of night terrors before age 7.5 years were studied by means of a questionnaire. Mean observation time (time from onset age to age at survey) was 8.5 years, but longer than 10 years in nine subjects. Seventy percent of the children had their initial frequency of night terrors as their peak frequency, with a tendency for shorter duration of the parasomnia in this group. Children with onset age less than 3.5 years may be expected to attain a peak frequency of at least one episode per week. Children with onset after 3.5 years, but before 7.5 years, may expect to attain a peak frequency of 1-2 episodes per month. There was a mean duration of 3.9 years, with a tendency for longer duration in children with positive family histories of sleep walking. Fifty percent stopped by age 8 years; 36 percent continued into adolescence. No common abnormal behavioral profile or psychopathology was found. Common precipitants of attacks were not identified.\r"

Observations of family interactions for 90 minutes, including one feeding, yielded clinically useful information not readily available from other sources. Behaviors that supported inadequate feedings were reliably identified in 79 percent of the families. Failure of mothers to appropriately respond to their infants' cues, coupled with few signs of emotional attachment, were present in only 26 percent of cases, and inadequate child-care knowledge and skills in only 6 percent. Thus, widely held conceptual models explained perpetuation of inadequate feedings in only 32 percent of cases. Instead, sibling rivalry, displaced maternal anger, and undermined mother were among the problems found. Assessments of family members' interactions surrounding feedings have the potential to enhance the current management of NFT.\r"

Blood pressure was normalized within 1 week of admission in 33 patients (group I), but did not decrease in 39 patients (group II). To determine the factors that differentiate group I from group II, cardio-renal haemodynamic and endocrinological indices were evaluated using multivariate analysis. 2. Systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressures on admission were higher in group II (P less than 0.001), whose optic fundi showed more severe changes (P less than 0.001). Although group II had greater left ventricular posterior wall thickness (P less than 0.02), left ventricular mass index (P less than 0.05) and systemic vascular resistance (P less than 0.01) on echocardiography, their cardiac index and ejection fraction were comparable with those of group I. 3. Renal blood flow (P less than 0.05) and glomerular filtration rate (P less than 0.01) were lower in group II than in group I. Renal vascular resistance was more elevated (P less than 0.01) in group II than in group I. 4. After severe sodium depletion and ambulation, group I showed a greater increase in plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline (P less than 0.05). On multivariate analysis, those with lower systolic blood pressure, better renal function and more reactive sympathetic nervous system were discriminated as group I. 5. These data suggest that group I patients have lower systolic blood pressure on admission, greater sympathetic reactivity and better renal function, all of which contribute to their spontaneous blood pressure fall after admission.\r"

Frusemide produced a significant increase in urine dopamine output within 15 min. 3. Indomethacin attenuated the natriuretic and renin responses to frusemide, but did not alter urine dopamine output. 4. Carbidopa lowered urine dopamine to undetectable levels, but did not significantly affect the natriuretic and renin responses to frusemide. 5. We conclude that urine dopamine excretion after frusemide is not directly related to increased sodium excretion or renin response and it is not mediated by the prostaglandins. In addition, dopamine does not contribute to the renal actions of frusemide under normal conditions.\r"

Hepatic fatty acid synthesis rates measured in vivo with 3H2O were also significantly reduced in alcohol-fed rats. 2. Time-course experiments showed that after 1 week on the ethanol diet hepatic fatty acid synthesis rates in vitro were similar to control rats, although the liver triacylglycerol content was significantly increased. From the second week of feeding, fatty acid synthesis rates were significantly lower in alcohol-fed rats and the liver triacylglycerol content progressively increased compared with controls. 3. Fatty acid synthase activity in liver cytosolic fractions were similar to controls in the alcohol-fed group after 1 week of feeding but were significantly lower in alcohol-fed rats from the second week onwards. 4. These results indicate that hepatic triacylglycerol accumulation after alcohol feeding is not due to increased fatty acid synthesis. The reduced fatty acid synthesis observed is a consequence of triacylglycerol accumulation.\r"

Absorption was determined by measuring recovery of molecules in the urine, corrected for incomplete recovery after intravenous injection, and was examined for correlation with several parameters of molecular dimension. 2. Absorption depended on molecular volume rather than relative molecular mass, molecular radius or molecular area. 3. Molecules with a molecular volume below 225 X 10(-3) nm3 were absorbed to a greater extent than larger molecules, and absorption was affected critically by molecular volume, small changes in volume producing considerable variation in absorption. 4. Absorption of larger molecules was not affected by changes in volume within the range 362 X 10(-3)-1128 X 10(-3) nm3. 5. These findings support the concept that there are at least two aqueous diffusion pathways across the intestinal mucosa. small molecules diffusing through a small channel of finite dimension, compatible with a transcellular aqueous pore, whilst large molecules diffuse through a less frequent pathway of considerably larger dimensions.\r"

Whole blood ionized calcium was measured simultaneously. 2. In the prehypertensive stage (4 weeks of age), plasma bicarbonate was significantly lower in SHR than in WKY, while blood pH did not differ significantly. 3. After 6 weeks of age, blood pH and plasma bicarbonate were significantly lower in both anaesthetized and conscious SHR than in corresponding WKY. After 7 days administration of NH4Cl in the drinking fluid, both parameters decreased significantly in both strains and the difference in pH remained constant (0.05 pH unit, P less than 0.01). 4. In none of the groups investigated did non-pH-adjusted ionized calcium differ significantly between the SHR and WKY. 5. Prevention of the development of hypertension in SHR by hydralazine treatment from weaning did not increase pH or bicarbonate compared with untreated SHR, indicating that the metabolic acidosis in the SHR was not a consequence of raised blood pressure. 6. Disturbance in acid-base balance may be involved in the pathogenesis of raised blood pressure in this animal model of genetic hypertension.\r"

The amount of admixture in nasal lavage fluids was determined by addition of 99mTc labelled albumin, providing a correction factor for measurements of cellular material and humoral substances in nasal lavage return as well as a quantitative measure of nasal secretions. 2. Albumin was chosen as marker molecule, since only negligible amounts were absorbed or adsorbed to the mucosa during the nasal lavage. 3. Labelling of the albumin with 99mTc ensured an accuracy of measurements only limited by the precision of the weighing. The isotope allowed for the determination of the amount of admixed secretion to be carried out on the whole sample of lavage fluid, thereby avoiding the necessity of complete admixture between marker and lavage fluid which would be pertinent to marker molecules measured chemically. The radiation from a nasal lavage is minimal and the procedure is fully acceptable for repeated use in humans. 4. The nasal lavage technique adopted allowed the return of 99.2% (median value) of the instilled volume. The area irrigated was visualized on a gamma-camera, and was demonstrated to cover an area larger than the area reached by challenge from a pumpspray, i.e. a large part of the nose, yet not the oropharynx. 5. A dose related increase in nasal secretion harvested by the nasal lavage in 10 persons challenged with histamine chloride could be demonstrated by this technique. 6. It is concluded that the use of 99mTc-albumin in a nasal washing provides a safe, simple and quick method for determination of the admixed nasal secretion with a remarkable degree of accuracy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The osteoblastic osteoid surfaces as well as the bone formation rates also increased significantly. 4. A rise in resorption parameters and in serum parathyroid hormone levels was observed in patients with osteomalacia. The percentage reductions in stainable aluminium and in osteoid volume were correlated with the degree of hyperparathyroidism. 5. These data show that deferoxamine therapy reduces stainable bone aluminium and improves bone mineralization in low turnover osteomalacia and that the presence of hyperparathyroidism is associated with an increased response to deferoxamine therapy.\r"

Dietary K+ intakes in the normal subjects, CAPD patients and haemodialysis patients were 80-100 mmol/24 h, 70-80 mmol/24 h and 60-70 mmol/24 h, respectively. 2. At an initial intraluminal K+ concentration of 45 mmol/l, rectal K+ secretion in the CAPD patients (2.4 +/- 0.4 mumol h-1 cm-2) was greater than in normal subjects (1.2 +/- 0.2 mumol h-1 cm-2, P less than 0.02). Under similar conditions, rectal K+ secretion was also greater in the haemodialysis patients than in normal subjects, both predialysis (3.7 +/- 0.4 mumol h-1 cm-2, P less than 0.001) and postdialysis (2.4 +/- 0.5 mumol h-1 cm-2, P less than 0.05), even though haemodialysis decreased plasma K+ concentration from 5.3 +/- 0.1 mmol/l to 3.5 +/- 0.2 mmol/l (P less than 0.001). 3.

The hypotensive response to Nf was much greater in DOCA rats than in the controls. 3. Solitary blockade of the sympathetic nervous system or AVP, did not alter the Nf effect in either DOCA or control rats. However, a combination clearly diminished the effect of Nf in the DOCA group, but enhanced it in the controls. The inhibition of angiotensin II (ANG II) augmented the hypotensive effect of Nf in control animals, but not in the DOCA rats. The percentage fall in blood pressure with Nf was much the same in both groups after the combined inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system and AVP. 4. The enhanced hypotensive action of Nf in DOCA rats may be dependent on the hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system and AVP, which facilitates calcium influx, and in the normotensive animals the depressor response to Nf may relate to blockade of the calcium influx, independent of the sympathetic nervous system, AVP and ANG II.\r"

An ultrafiltrate of the serum (mol. wt. less than 30,000) also inhibited ouabain-sensitive leucocyte sodium transport when compared with filtrate obtained from control serum. 4. DHA-S Dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHA-S) and cortisone, both present in high concentration in cord serum, demonstrated EDLI but did not affect leucocyte sodium transport in the cells of normal subjects. 5. DHA-S had no effect on sodium transport or vasoconstrictor activity in human omental resistance vessels. 6. It is concluded that EDLI of cord serum is associated with sodium transport inhibitory activity. This is unlikely to be attributable to DHA-S or cortisone.\r"

The diuretic action and binding to urinary Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein of the radiolabelled diuretics in vivo, after intravenous administration, were examined in rabbits. 3. In vitro, all three radiolabelled diuretics bound strongly to human serum albumin, but not to Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein. 4. Radiolabelled frusemide and bumetanide, but not ethacrynic acid, caused a diuresis in rabbits, but no binding between the drugs and Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein was seen in vivo. 5.

One group (n = 12) received superoxide dismutase (SOD) (15 mg/kg body weight), a second group (n = 12) received polyethylene glycol coupled catalase (PEG-catalase) (5000 i.u./kg body weight) and the third (n = 9) saline (150 mmol/l NaCl) via the intraperitoneal route, in addition to the PA. 3. SOD and PEG-catalase reduced the 24 h urine protein on days 8 and 15 compared with unmodified puromycin treated animals and this difference was significant on day 15 for SOD (P less than 0.05) and for PEG-catalase (P less than 0.01). Glomerular filtration rate, as measured by the creatinine clearance, was lower in the PEG-catalase group but did not differ significantly from the saline treated group. 4. These data suggest that superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide, or their reaction products, are involved in the glomerular injury of puromycin nephropathy.\r"

The probable cause was the repeated striking and sliding of the knuckles against metal shackles in which live birds were being placed. Additional medical and ergonomic evaluation would be worthwhile to confirm the probable cause, to determine whether associated tissue disorders are present in the digits of chicken hangers who develop knuckle pads, and to suggest preventive measures.\r"

The most common final diagnoses were seborrhoeic dermatitis (1351), contact dermatitis (1317), atopic dermatitis (1009) and nummular eczema (822). Battery patch testing was the initial diagnostic procedure performed, and 897 of the 3164 patients who were patch tested had one or more positive patch tests. In 545 cases, the reactions were considered of relevance to the current dermatitis. Tests for immediate-type allergy were carried out in 618 patients, and 284 of these had one or more positive tests. In 86 patients, these test results were of diagnostic significance. 257 patients with positive patch tests were challenged orally with the relevant substance, and 53 of 156 reacted to metal salts, most commonly nickel, while 25 of 101 reacted to orally ingested balsam of Peru. Among patch-test-negative patients, 66 of 408 had positive reactions to one or more metal salts; 41 of 180 reacted to balsam of Peru, while 15 of 41 reacted to various food additives.\r"

The async mode was HFJV at 100 cycle/min, while the sync mode was HFJV triggered by the R-wave of the ECG tracing. The heart rate ranged between 64 and 127 beat/min. Synchronization was studied at one of two periods, sync 0 and sync 60. Sync 0 consisted of inspiration triggered by the R-wave, with jet ventilation occurring early in systole; sync 60 represented a 60% delay of the time between the succeeding R-waves, with jet ventilation occurring in mid-diastole. There was no significant difference in the cardiorespiratory data when async was compared to either sync 0 or sync 60. Therefore, in these patients without heart failure, the selection of async vs. either sync mode appeared to have neither adverse nor beneficial hemodynamic effects.\r"

Eight patients (700 to 1400 g), all requiring mechanical ventilation with fraction of inspired oxygen greater than 0.6, were included in the trial; four were randomized to receive surfactant, and the others served as controls. Porcine surfactant (2 ml/kg; phospholipid concentration, 100 mg/ml) was instilled via a naso-endotracheal tube at end-expiration and dispersed into the lungs during a period of standardized \"sighing\" mediated by the ventilator: two prolonged ventilatory cycles (10 sec each) with an inspiration/expiration ratio of 4:1, followed by a 6-min ventilation with a frequency of 60 breath/min and an inspiration/expiration ratio of 4:1. Control babies received no surfactant but were otherwise subjected to the same ventilatory maneuvers. Surfactant-treated infants showed a rapid increase in transcutaneous oxygen associated with improved lung aeration in chest x-rays; the response was transient in three babies and persistent in one. No improvement was observed in control babies. We conclude that the beneficial effect of surfactant replacement cannot be attributed to the ventilatory maneuvers associated with the instillation procedure.\r"

At the initial evaluation, both survivors and nonsurvivors demonstrated an elevated cardiac index (CI), low systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), and normal stroke volume index. However, only an initial heart rate (HR) less than 106 beat/min significantly predicted survival. Twenty-four hours after the onset of shock, both an HR less than 95 beat/min and an SVRI greater than 1529 dyne.sec/cm5.m2 predicted survival. Comparing the hemodynamic profiles from the initial to the 24 h time point, a decrease in HR greater than 18 beat/min or a decrease in CI greater than 0.5 L/min.m2 predicted survival. Twenty-two deaths occurred in the first week of study, of which 18 (82%) were due primarily to low SVRI and four (18%) to low CI. Seven deaths occurred after 1 wk, all of which were due to multiple organ failure.\r"

The total mortality rate was 40%; 47% of the patients with nosocomial and 17% of the patients with community-acquired pneumonias died.

In 10 dogs, 15 micrograms/kg of rT3 were administered iv 30 min before hemorrhage. In 13 other dogs, an equal volume of saline was injected. The dogs were bled rapidly to a mean arterial pressure of 40 mm Hg, and after 60 min the reservoir line was clamped for 30 min. The shed blood was then reinfused over 30 min. After one hour of hemodynamic monitoring, the dogs were returned to the kennel and observed for at least 3 days. During shock there were few significant intergroup hemodynamic-metabolic differences. In the control group, six of 13 dogs died, whereas nine of ten dogs given rT3 died (p less than .03). This study strongly suggests that rT3 exerts detrimental biological activity in canine hemorrhagic shock. Hence, rT3 may play a causative role in the euthyroid sick (\"low T3\") syndrome.\r"

Using puppies, we compared mean arterial pressure, cardiac index (CI), and cerebral blood flow (CBF) at a slow (40/min, group 1) and a rapid (120/min, group 2) rate. CBF was measured in all experiments by N2O uptake before and during CPR from cardiac arrest induced with KCl. Both CI and CBF were measured in half of the subjects with radiolabeled microspheres. Groups 1 and 2 were similar in terms of baseline mean weight, mean arterial pressure, CI, CBF, and arterial and venous blood gases. During resuscitation for group 1, the mean CI was 221 ml/min . m2, and the mean CBF was 4 ml/100 g . min determined by N2O uptake (2 ml/100 g.min by microspheres); in group 2, the respective means were 248 ml/min . m2 and 4 ml/100 g . min with both techniques. The values for mean CI and CBF (N2O or microspheres) did not differ significantly at either rate of compression. The N2O uptake and microsphere techniques for measuring CBF correlated closely during spontaneous cardiac contractions and mechanical chest compressions. We conclude that a) closed-chest cardiac compressions at either rate studied provided inadequate CBF, and b) the N2O uptake and microsphere techniques give similar measures of CBF under conditions of normal and low flow.\r"

Studies included measurement of forced expiratory volumes and flow rates and single-breath nitrogen washout, as well as use of a standardized questionnaire. The data represent 47 percent of 2,340 and 58 percent of 1,935 residents, respectively, of the original community samples. Mean baseline spirometry and nitrogen washout for those who were and those who were not retested were similar, reflecting the fact that loss to follow-up was primarily due to changes of residence. In the more polluted area there were significantly worse lung function test results for both men and women at baseline and significantly more rapid deterioration at follow-up. Mean changes in nitrogen washout were significantly greater in the more polluted community for both sexes and for all age groups including children. Most of the spirometric test results showed significantly more rapid decline among adults in the more polluted community. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that chronic exposures to a mix of photochemical oxidants, sulfates and particulates are associated with increased loss of lung function, which is especially marked among tests that reflect function of the small airways.\r"

Nine subjects were disqualified by the unexpected discovery of sleep apnea, as were another eight because they could not sleep in the laboratory setting. Of the remaining 135 subjects, 37 (27 percent) desaturated below a baseline sleep saturation of 90 percent for five minutes or more, reaching a nadir saturation of at least 85 percent. Anthropomorphic, pulmonary function, and historic factors comparing desaturators and nondesaturators failed to separate the groups. Awake PaO2 at rest in the desaturators was significantly lower than in the nondesaturators. The PaCO2 was higher in the desaturators. Reversibility of the desaturation phenomenon was demonstrated in three patients during subsequent polysomnographic studies following periods of clinical improvement. Continuous oxyhemoglobin monitoring during sleep remains the only reliable tool for detecting nocturnal desaturation.\r"

Of 6,063 respondents, 468 (7.7 percent) identified asthma as a personal medical condition; 72 (1.2 percent [15.4 percent of all those with asthma]) attributed it to workplace exposures. These subjects were older and included more men and cigarette smokers than groups of both asthmatic and nonasthmatic subjects. The relative risk for occupationally attributed asthma was elevated among industrial and agricultural workers as compared with white collar and service occupations. Analysis of disability benefit status did not indicate that this introduced major reporting bias in this survey. This study suggests that occupational factors may have a greater role in adult asthma than previously thought.\r"

We therefore prospectively studied eight patients before and after dietary-induced weight loss. Mean weight loss was 20.6 kg +/- 12.8 SD. After weight loss there were significant improvements in PO2 and PCO2 measured during wakefulness, and in the number of desaturation episodes per hour of sleep, average desaturation per episode, and number of movement arousals. The number of apneas and hypopneas significantly decreased in six of eight patients. There was a significant correlation between body mass index and number of disordered breathing events. Nasopharyngeal collapsibility and pulse flow resistance decreased in awake patients after weight loss. We conclude that moderate weight loss in obese patients with OSA improves oxygenation during both sleep and wakefulness, decreases the number of disordered breathing events in many patients, decreases the collapsibility of the nasopharyngeal airway.\r"

Recent studies of small numbers of cocaine users suggest that freebasing frequently causes cough, dyspnea, and abnormalities in diffusing capacity (DCO), although these findings could have been due to concomitant use of other drugs. We therefore evaluated the relationship between cocaine use by freebasing and chronic respiratory symptoms and lung dysfunction in a large sample of habitual smokers of marijuana with or without tobacco who denied intravenous drug abuse. The findings suggested that, among habitual marijuana smokers, \"moderate\" cocaine smoking damaged both large and small airways, as reflected by functional changes that were independent of concomitant marijuana use and appeared to be synergistic with the effects of tobacco. On the other hand, no adverse influence of cocaine smoking on the pulmonary microcirculation was demonstrated in our sample of freebase users.\r"

The analysis of the variation of the mean signal intensity vs time from the ascending aorta (AA), descending aorta (DA), and pulmonary artery (PA) of the ten normal volunteers on the TE = 30 ms images, showed a common pattern characterized by an end-diastolic intraluminal signal not present in other moments of the cardiac cycle. On the contrary, in patients with CHF, we did not observe the systolic disappearance of the intraluminal MR signal. The main difference between CHF patients and control subjects was found in the DA where an abnormally high signal intensity was present for the whole cardiac cycle. The MR imaging can offer blood flow information underlying the behavior of intraluminal signal intensity and could provide functional information in patients with heart failure.\r"

To support this observation, serial changes of left ventricular (LV) function and LV sphericity were evaluated before and after operation in ten cases in the AR-Ao-group and compared with those in the AR-group. Before operation, there were no significant differences in LV function between the two groups. Postoperative improvement of LV sphericity and LV function were statistically better in the AR-Ao-group. The LV function reserve was considered sufficiently retained in the AR-Ao-group. Results with this study supported that clinical observation. Therefore, the total correction, at the same time of aortic incompetence and aortic lesions is recommended.\r"

Outpatients did not differ from inpatients in mean age, sex, incidence of clinically apparent COPD, size and location of lesion, or number of needle passes. The operating characteristics of the biopsy were the same for the two groups. Pneumothorax occurred in 29 (27 percent) of 106 outpatient and 26 (40 percent) of 65 inpatient TNBs. Few pneumothoraces not present upon completion of biopsy developed during four hours of observation or later. The requirement for chest tube drainage was similar for both groups, 5.7 and 4.6 percent, respectively. With appropriate caution, TNB can be performed safely on an outpatient basis and the cost of an uncomplicated procedure reduced by 27 percent.\r"

Prostaglandin E1, nifedipine and hydralazine were administered to the patients while measuring pulmonary and systemic hemodynamics and arterial blood gases. Prostaglandin E1 was easily titrated but was inconsistent as a predictor of the effects of the other vasodilators with respect to pulmonary artery pressure, cardiac output and adverse effects on arterial oxygenation. This study suggests that patients with PPH must still receive carefully monitored trials of several vasodilators to determine whether there is a beneficial response and to select the appropriate treatment.\r"

The overall data output between the three systems was comparable. However, minute ventilation was consistently higher on the Medical Graphics system, oxygen consumption was consistently lower on the Horizon system, and a technical error was discovered in the Medical Graphics system which resulted in a systematic overestimation of carbon dioxide production. Different methods of analyzing the data from the same test (60-s average, 15-s average, breath-by-breath, and 8-breath average) resulted in differences of up to 20 percent in the maximal values. This was greater than the differences between the three systems. Despite the comparability of the data output, important differences did exist which can be potentially significant when data output from one system are compared to predicted normal values obtained under different conditions.\r"

The 16 patients in the control group, whose management followed conventional practice in our hospital, received a total of 57 arterial blood gas measurements during the 6.6 (mean) days it took for them to taper to their discharge supplemental oxygen level (usually room air). The 13 patients randomized to the oximeter study group had their arterial oxygen saturation monitored by pulse oximetry. The physicians of patients in the oximeter group were at liberty to obtain arterial blood gas determinations during the study if they desired. The oximeter study group had fewer (p less than 0.005) arterial punctures for blood gas measurements (total of 16 for the group) and fewer (p less than 0.001) days on supplemental oxygen (mean of 2.7 days per patient). We conclude that substituting noninvasive pulse oximetry for arterial blood gas measurements during reductions of supplemental oxygen shortened the days of oxygen use and decreased the number of arterial blood gas determinations in our patients. In addition to reducing the discomfort to patients, the use of oximetry was of financial benefit in that it reduced medical personnel time, blood gas analyzer use, and duration of oxygen administration.\r"

Ninety-six percent of patients undergoing PA catheter investigation had either congestive heart failure (CHF), hypotension or cardiogenic shock. For the combined time periods, the in-hospital case fatality rate (CFR) for patients in CHF with a PA catheter was 44.8 percent compared to 25.3 percent for patients without a PA catheter (p less than .001). For patients with hypotension and a PA catheter, in-hospital CFR was 48.3 percent compared to 32.2 percent for hypotensive patients not receiving a PA catheter (p less than .001). In contrast, for patients in cardiogenic shock the in-hospital CFR was 74.4 percent for those receiving a PA catheter as compared to 79.1 percent for patients in shock not receiving a catheter. The use of a PA catheter was associated with an increased length of hospital stay irrespective of the development of acute clinical complications. Long-term prognosis for discharged hospital survivors who had a complicated MI, for up to a five-year follow-up period was similar whether the patient did or did not receive a PA catheter during the acute period of hospitalization. In conclusion, we could not demonstrate a beneficial effect associated with the use of the PA catheter on selected patient outcomes, including in-hospital and long-term prognosis and average hospital stay, in this community-wide study of patients hospitalized with acute MI.\r"

Right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy specimens showed interstitial hemorrhage and foci of interstitial polymorphonuclear leukocytes, strongly suggestive of catecholamine myocarditis. These patients had used beta-adrenergic agonist inhalants and methylxanthines. One of them clearly abused the inhalant and had elevated levels of urinary catecholamines. Progressive deterioration of pulmonary and cardiac function occurred in two patients, with death within three months of the initial myocardial biopsy. Concomitant use of beta-adrenergic agonists and methylxanthines may cause myocarditis with left ventricular failure in susceptible patients.\r"

We hypothesize that in this patient, hypothalamus and pituitary gland were morphologically intact, and that diabetes insipidus was induced by the inhibitory action of ectopic opiates on the release of antidiuretic hormone. Nevertheless, since post-mortem studies were refused, metastatic diabetes insipidus could not be definitely excluded, in which case, the source of plasmatic antidiuretic hormone would be the tumor itself.\r"

The 56 papers scored from 33 to 89, (mean, 61.6, standard deviation, 11.9). Only 13 (23 percent) reached a score of more than 70. The most frequent errors in design were the use of placebos in the control group (27 percent) and faulty methods of randomization (36 percent). Errors in analysis resulted in penalization of more papers than any other aspect; these included the almost universal omission of confidence limits, confusion of exclusions and withdrawals (46 percent), not recording the fate of withdrawals (80 percent) and incorrect use of statistical tests (55 percent). Ten papers reported results showing important clinical differences that did not achieve statistical significance, but only two mentioned the Type II error. Defects in presentation were less frequently encountered; the most common were inaccessibility of raw data (66 percent), lack of sufficient information to allow replication of methods (43 percent), and the drawing of firm conclusions from shaky data (50 percent). It was particularly disappointing that no evidence of improvement in the standard of these reports over the seven years studied was found.\r"

Twenty-one percent of patients with negative preoperative intravenous pyelograms and 42 percent of patients with positive preoperative intravenous pyelograms had abnormal findings in the postoperative intravenous pyelograms. Preoperative cystoscopy was performed in 52 patients. Thirty-one percent of patients with negative preoperative intravenous pyelograms and 76 percent of patients with positive preoperative intravenous pyelograms had abnormal cystoscopic findings. The overwhelming majority of cystoscopic findings in patients with negative preoperative intravenous pyelograms were not related to the primary tumor. The findings of this prospective study suggest that routine preoperative intravenous pyelography is indicated in patients with rectosigmoid or rectal tumors without symptoms related to the urinary tract. Postoperative intravenous pyelography is indicated only in patients with positive preoperative intravenous pyelograms. Preoperative cystoscopy is indicated when the preoperative intravenous pyelogram is positive and especially if intravenous pyelography findings are suggestive of bladder-wall defect or extrinsic pressure.\r"

The GDP localized the MAb B72.3 in 83 percent of sites. The technique, known as a radioimmunoguided surgery (RIGS) system did not alter the surgical procedure in patients with primary colorectal cancer but did alter the approach in 26 percent (8/31) of patients with recurrent colorectal cancer. Two patients avoided unnecessary liver resections and two underwent extraabdominal approaches to document their disease. The RIGS system may influence the short-term morbidity and mortality of surgery for colorectal cancer. Larger series and longer follow-up are needed to determine whether the RIGS system confers a survival advantage to the patient with colorectal cancer.\r"

Subsequent to the publication of this report, extensive and invasive workup of patients with Bowen's disease became the standard of practice. The authors' personal experience with perianal Bowen's disease suggested a substantially lower correlation between that disease and associated malignancies. Therefore a survey was initiated by contacting active members of the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons to investigate further. Analysis of 106 cases demonstrated a lower incidence of associated malignancies (4.7 percent) subsequent to diagnosis of perianal Bowen's disease. The data further indicated, however, that these patients are at risk to develop recurrent Bowen's disease (9.4 percent) and invasive carcinoma (5.7 percent). It is concluded that an extensive and invasive workup of patients with perianal Bowen's disease is not indicated and that the patient's greatest risk is development of recurrent or invasive disease.\r"

  ".W": "While it is well known that large doses of somatostatin inhibit human pancreatic enzyme secretion, it is still unknown whether low doses are also effective and whether the peptide is able to inhibit bicarbonate production. Eight subjects with external transduodenal drainage of the main pancreatic duct performed after biliary tract surgery were studied. Somatostatin was infused at progressively increasing rates of 0.05, 0.15, 0.45, and 1.35 micrograms/kg/hr, for 30 min/dose, during pancreatic stimulation with secretin, 25 ng/kg/hr, and cerulein, 10 ng/kg/hr. Somatostatin, at the dose of 0.05 microgram/kg/hr (shown to produce blood levels similar to those measured after a meal) did not affect pancreatic secretion in any of the subjects. The successive three higher doses caused a significant and dose-dependent inhibition of protein concentration and output and of bicarbonate output. Bicarbonate concentration was slightly but significantly reduced only by the two highest doses of somatostatin. At each dose level, the inhibition of protein output was much more marked than the inhibition of bicarbonate output. The maximal inhibition of protein output (at 1.35 micrograms/kg/hr somatostatin) was 73.9 +/- 5.4%, and that of bicarbonate output was 55.9 +/- 6.4%. The results demonstrate that: (1) the administration of somatostatin at a low dose level does not affect human exocrine pancreatic secretion, at least under the experimental conditions of this study; and (2) the administration of larger doses of somatostatin inhibits pancreatic secretion of both protein and bicarbonate dose-dependently. The inhibitory effect on protein output is significantly greater than that on water and bicarbonate production.\r"

Stools were analyzed for fat and protein by conventional methods and for carbohydrate using a recently validated anthrone method. Despite persistent fat and protein malabsorption, less than 1% of ingested carbohydrate was lost intact in the stools. Comparison of baseline and placebo balance studies showed fecal excretion of carbohydrate to be independent of intake, in contrast to the fat and protein results. Using a thin-layer chromatography method capable of detecting microgram quantities of urinary organic acids, no short-chain fatty acids were detected in the stool. Further exploration of carbohydrate as a dietary energy source for this patient group with increased energy demands should be pursued.\r"

By means of breath hydrogen measurements following a potato meal and comparison with the hydrogen response to lactulose, the amount of starch escaping small bowel absorption was measured in 10 patients who had a colonic adenoma removed endoscopically and in 10 controls. The subjects' consumption of starch and fiber was assessed. Percentage unabsorbed starch was approximately half as much in the patients (5.3%) compared with the controls (10.9%, P less than 0.05). Consumption of starch and dietary fiber, and mouth-to-cecum transit times were not significantly different. Unabsorbed starch was calculated to contribute to 6.0 g/day colonic carbohydrate in the patients and 10.9 g/day in the controls (P less than 0.05). This study confirms that unabsorbed starch provides an important quantity of colonic carbohydrate and suggests that super-efficient starch absorption, by reducing this provision, may promote colonic neoplasia.\r"

In all subjects and in 13/17 experiments, more than 2500 units of salivary amylase were passed over 200 postcibal minutes. Salivary amylase comprised 13.8 +/- 3.9% (mean +/- SEM) of the total amylase and appeared predominantly as single, distinct peak. The inhibitor method was validated by isoelectric focusing (r = 0.988; P less than 0.001; N = 7). The frequency of detection of salivary amylase in gastric or jejunal samples fell as gastric pH fell below 3.0. In vitro, amylase was inactivated in gastric juice as pH fell between 3.8 and 3.3. Salivary amylase accounted for 11% of total amylase output in a normal and 27% in an achlorhydric subject after a hamburger meal. We conclude that amylase should not be measured in postprandial studies of pancreatic secretion in humans without correction for salivary amylase.\r"

Seven patients had the primary form while four patients had an underlying disease which could have been responsible for the chronic colonic pseudoobstruction. Lower bowel motility was decreased in patients with the primary form. Rectal wall elasticity was increased in both the primary and secondary form. Some of the abnormalities measured may suggest myogenic abnormalities of the sigmoid or rectal wall. No specific neural or muscular morphologic defect was identified in colonic transmural sections in eight patients except in the patient with Hirschsprung's disease.

  ".W": "We assessed the characteristics of muscarinic neural transmission in the vagal inhibitory pathway to the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) of anesthetized opossums. LES relaxation was induced by electrical stimulation of the cervical vagus. Measurements were made of LES relaxation before and after intravenous administration of nicotinic (hexamethonium), serotonergic (5-Meo-DMT), nonselective muscarinic (atropine), and selective muscarinic (pirenzepine-M1 and 4-DAMP-M2) antagonists. The latency of LES relaxation was increased substantially by pirenzepine and atropine, increased slightly by hexamethonium, but was not affected by 4-DAMP or 5-Meo-DMT. Given as concurrent intravenous infusions, hexamethonium, 5-Meo-DMT and 4-DAMP added to pirenzepine or atropine did not significantly increase LES relaxation latency above that caused by pirenzepine or atropine alone. None of the antagonists alone had a significant effect on percent LES relaxation. The combination of pirenzepine or 4-DAMP with hexamethonium and 5-Meo-DMT did not affect percent LES relaxation. The combination of atropine with hexamethonium and 5-Meo-DMT reduced LES relaxation to 18%. The combination of pirenzepine and 4-DAMP with hexamethonium and 5-Meo-DMT, however, had no effect on percent LES relaxation. We conclude that muscarinic participation in vagally induced LES relaxation exhibits two functional receptor subtypes: (1) M1 receptors that determine LES relaxation latency and are antagonized by pirenzepine or atropine, and (2) non-M1, non-M2 receptors (Mx receptors) that contribute to the magnitude of LES relaxation and are antagonized by atropine, but not by pirenzepine or 4-DAMP.\r"

Using 0.6 N HCl as a damaging agent in pylorus-ligated rats, the protective property of milk appeared to be related to its phospholipid content and not its protein constituents. With intact (non-pylorus-ligated) rats, milk had demonstrable protective activity against 0.6 N HCl, as well as 100% ethanol and 160 mM taurocholic acid. The increasing phospholipid concentrations in skim, whole, and buttermilk paralleled their antiulcer efficacy. A lipid extract of whole milk showed significant protection against 0.6 N HCl when given alone or following indomethacin treatment. Measurements of the contact angle (hydrophobicity) of the gastric surface showed that it was maintained near control levels in the presence of 0.6 N HCl, if rats were first pretreated with milk. These results are consistent with the possibility that surface-active lipids in dairy milk, such as phospholipids, may account for a significant portion of milk's antiulcer activity by maintaining the hydrophobicity of the luminal surface of the gastric mucosa in the presence of a damaging agent.\r"

The control group subjects received two tablets of chloroquine sulfate (300-mg base) only. The test group subjects received ranitidine 250 mg hs for four days prior to the administration of chloroquine sulfate and throughout the sample collection period. Blood samples (5 ml) were collected from the time of the chloroquine administration to the seventh day after drug administration. The samples were analyzed for chloroquine content by a combination of thin-layer chromatography and ultraviolet spectrophotometry. The Wilcoxon test at 0.05 significance level was used to compare the disposition parameters between control and test groups. Ranitidine therapy was associated with no significant alterations in chloroquine oral clearance rate, elimination rate constant, and apparent volume of distribution. Unlike cimetidine, ranitidine does not interact pharmacokinetically with chloroquine. Ranitidine, therefore, may be the H2-receptor antagonist of choice for ulcer patients receiving chloroquine.\r"

Pharmacists recommended changes in patient-specific drug therapy that were implemented 52 percent and 69 percent of the time in the first and second study periods, respectively. The most common type of drug information request concerned the presence or the likelihood of an adverse drug reaction. Continuous interaction between pharmacists and physicians in the patient-care setting results in a better appreciation of the pharmacist's role as drug information consultant, and the consequence of this is a high degree of compliance with pharmacists' recommendations.\r"

In the neonatal rat brain, however, 19-hydroxylation has been shown to exceed significantly subsequent aromatization, suggesting that formation of 19-hydroxylated androgen metabolites might be important in brain differentiation in this species. Using [19-3H3]androstenedione, we found that the surplus activity of 19-hydroxylase relative to aromatase was independent of age, sex, and androgen substrate concentration, despite 100-fold differences in tissue aromatase activity during the course of development. In addition, the surplus 19-hydroxylation was not affected by several agents which otherwise decreased or increased the activity of the aromatase enzyme, including metyrapone, KCN, and cytochrome P-450 reductase, the latter indicating that the failure of the 19-hydroxylated products to proceed to aromatization was not due to a deficit of reducing equivalents. 19-Hydroxylation of androgens in the rat brain is a quantitatively significant metabolic pathway in this tissue, although present data do not confirm the existence of a steroid C-19 hydroxylase in the brain separate from that involved in aromatization.\r"

  ".U": "88004280\r", 
  ".W": "It is well known that the MCR of proteins can be influenced by their carbohydrate structure; i.e. the presence of terminal galactose on proteins results in uptake by hepatic receptors for galactose-terminated glycoproteins. Thus, a protein with its galactose residues covered or removed exhibits a far longer half life in plasma than one with its galactose residues exposed. The free alpha-subunit of human CG (hCG) has been shown to have a different carbohydrate composition than does the alpha-subunit dissociated from the intact hormone. In our laboratory, analysis of alpha-subunits isolated from pregnancy urine indicated that the alpha-subunit dissociated from hCG (hCG alpha) contains primarily monosialylated oligosaccharides, whereas the free alpha-subunit contains more than one sialic acid per oligosaccharide. This difference in the degree of sialylation prompted us to examine the clearance rates of these two subunits. Accordingly, free alpha and hCG alpha were purified by affinity chromatography and labeled with 125I. The labeled subunits were injected iv into rats and serum samples were removed at various time intervals over a 2-h period. The amount of [125I]alpha-subunit remaining in the serum was determined by immunoprecipitation using an antiserum to hCG alpha. The disappearance curves for the two subunits were indistinguishable and could be analyzed by a biexponential model. The t 1/2 of the faster component was 5 min, while the t 1/2 of the slower component was 74 min. In order to determine whether or not terminal galactose was present on either the hCG alpha or the free alpha-subunit, the labeled molecules were subjected to lectin column chromatography using Ricin or peanut lectin linked to agarose. Both of these lectins bind galactose but have different specificities with respect to the penultimate sugar. Both subunit preparations contained only minor amounts of material which could bind or either lectin. However, after desialylation, both hCG alpha and free alpha bound extensively to Ricin, indicating the presence of penultimate galactose residues in both. We conclude that terminal galactose residues are not present on the oligosaccharides of either hCG alpha or free alpha-subunits, and that the difference observed in the sialic acid contents of the two subunits does not affect their rates of clearance.\r"

Plasma B concentration, body weight gain, and thymus weight were used as independent measures of treatment efficacy. Compared to controls, Adx animals had a 75 +/- 0.5% (n = 30) reduction in pancreatic amylase content; a 50% decrease occurred within 1 day and the maximal 75% decrease was observed after 5 days. In Adx animals, amylase content was normalized by normal B replacement and was increased to 235 +/- 39% (n = 30) of control by high B replacement. Furthermore, in all Adx rats, pancreatic content of amylase and plasma B concentration was significantly correlated (r = 0.81, n = 30). The effect of adrenalectomy was selective for amylase; contents of ribonuclease, chymotrypsin, and elastase were not altered. However, the effects of high B replacement were not selective, and increased the content of all digestive enzymes. To determine whether the changes in enzyme content were associated with changes in messenger RNA (mRNA), pancreatic RNA was probed with 32P-labeled complementary DNAs for amylase, ribonuclease, and chymotrypsin. After adrenalectomy and B replacement there was a significant correlation only between amylase mRNA (r = 0.87, n = 13) and plasma B concentration. These data indicate that physiological levels of B have a selective effect on pancreatic amylase gene expression. In contrast, high levels of B have the separate, nonselective effect of increasing the content of all digestive enzymes without increasing corresponding mRNA levels.\r"
