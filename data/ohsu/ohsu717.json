Methods to improve the performance of paramedics in ET intubation should be explored. The small, anesthetized cat may be utilized to evaluate infant ET intubation performance. By determining success rates and complications of ET intubation in the cat model, analysis of the current skills and the impact of a short didactic session is described. Unprepared paramedics (n = 36) were randomized to an educational (experimental) or control group. Supervisory personnel evaluated ET tube placement and complications. There was no significant difference in the percent of successfully intubated cats, 67% and 57%, respectively, between experimental and control groups. Fifteen percent of successful ET intubations exceeded 30 seconds of intubation time. The experimental group chose appropriate equipment more frequently. Serious complications occurred in 50% of attempted intubations. There was a poor correlation between performance and measures of paramedic experience. Development of educational methods is required to improve infant ET intubation success and reduce complications.\r"

Pediatric coroners' death rates per 100,000 population varied from an average of 2.17 in the rural region to 30.4 in the urban region. Vehicular accidents caused the majority (66%) of the accidental deaths, and firearms caused 61% of the violent deaths. Violent deaths (homicide and suicide) were significantly more common in the urban region (P less than 0.001), and vehicular deaths (excluding auto versus pedestrian) were more common in the rural region (P less than 0.001). EMS provider usage was greater in the urban areas (84 vs 66%, P less than 0.001), as was the number of cases receiving advanced life support (97 vs 66%, P less than 0.001). Urban and rural differences in place of death were significant for two places of death; street and highway, and inhospital deaths. A significantly greater number of children died on the street/highway in rural areas (P less than 0.05). Hospital deaths were more likely to occur on the ward in the rural region, versus the intensive care unit in the urban region (P less than 0.001). Proposed factors which may explain these findings include differences in medical resources and in local transfer policies. The study demonstrates that EMS providers are involved in the care of children who have had a fatal emergency. Further evaluation of rural and urban differences in prehospital care of the pediatric patient is indicated.\r"

A total of 68 episodes occurred in 68 patients; blood culture was performed on each. Of 17 patients who appeared compromised (ill, irritable, toxic) on presentation, five (30%) had either bacteremia or bacterial meningitis. All five patients had clinical evidence of a fulminant disease process on examination. By contrast, all 51 patients who appeared to be well on presentation were culture-negative. Fever and new-onset neutropenia in children is a heterogeneous disorder with several outcomes. Any child with fever and newly discovered neutropenia who appears ill should be presumed to be at high risk for systemic bacterial infection and receive hospitalization for parenteral antibiotic therapy. By contrast, the previously healthy child older than two months of age with fever and new-onset neutropenia who appears to be well, and whose clinical evaluation does not indicate a serious underlying disease process, is at low risk for accompanying systemic bacterial infection; hospitalization with empiric antibiotic therapy pending culture results is not warranted for the majority of such children. Close outpatient monitoring with serial evaluation of the peripheral blood absolute neutrophil count to document bone marrow recovery is recommended for such cases.\r"

The CAMPS system (DACIS Software) was selected because it allows students freedom to follow any pathway in selecting over 500 items of history, physical examination, laboratory, and treatments. In interacting with this simulation, students demonstrated how they integrate their knowledge into a clinical setting. The three-hour seminar covered the topics of physical and sexual abuse, patient neglect, and utilization of community resources for treatment. The control (n = 43) and experimental (n = 38) groups, enrolled in an introductory course in pediatrics, were given references to read about child abuse as part of the core curriculum, but they may or may not have had exposure to patients in their clinical work. Only the experimental group attended the seminar. As part of the course evaluation program, both groups interacted with eight computer simulations, two of which involved cases of child abuse. In the classic case of child abuse, the control and experimental groups had similar results. In the more difficult diagnostic problem (shaken baby), the groups differed significantly in total score, cost of the evaluation, and percentage of correct diagnosis.\r"

Human tissue alone cannot be used to counteract these causes; a satisfactory prosthesis is needed if results of herniorrhaphy are to improve. We have had a large personal experience with monofilament polypropylene mesh (Marlex), using it to repair more than 5,000 hernias of all types over a period of 25 years. We have found it to be nonallergenic, nononcogenic, and highly resistant to infection. It serves as an effective and permanent barrier to protrusion through the floor of the inguinal canal and is readily incorporated into tissue with virtually no foreign-body reaction. Postoperative discomfort is minimized because there is no tension on the sutures and the operation is easily performed using a local anesthetic. The patient may leave the ambulatory care center within hours and return quickly to unrestricted activity with confidence.\r"

  ".W": "A parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHRP) has been identified in human tumors associated with the syndrome of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. While parathyroid hormone (PTH) gene expression appears to be limited to the parathyroid glands, PTHRP mRNA has been identified in a variety of normal tissues. To investigate the apparent expression of the PTHRP in the central nervous system, we examined extracts of whole rat brain for PTHRP bioactivity by measuring adenylate cyclase-stimulating activity (ACSA) in a PTH-sensitive assay. Extracts consistently contained ACSA and this activity was completely inhibited by a PTHRP antiserum but was unaffected by a PTH antiserum. ACSA was found in a number of anatomic subregions of rat brain, being greatest in the cortex and telencephalon. RNase protection analysis revealed PTHRP transcripts in total RNA prepared from whole rat brain and from the same anatomic subregions. By in situ hybridization histochemistry, we found that the highest levels of PTHRP gene expression occurred in neurons of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellar cortex. These studies demonstrate that both PTHRP mRNA and biological activity are present in a number of regions of rat brain. The widespread expression of this peptide by multiple types of neurons suggests that the PTHRP may play a general role in neuronal physiology.\r"

To biochemically characterize p75, we have directly isolated IL-2R using affinity precipitations with immobilized IL-2. We now report that at least some mouse p75 appears to exist as a disulfide-linked heterodimer with a subunit of Mr 22,000 (p22). These findings suggest that functional high-affinity mouse IL-2R may be comprised of at least three distinct subunits. The possibility of an even more complex structure is suggested by the coprecipitation of a protein of Mr 40,000-45,000 (p40) that may represent an additional IL-2R-associated protein.\r"

  ".W": "In the retinal degeneration B (rdgB) mutant of Drosophila, the major class of photoreceptors degenerate when the fly is raised in the light for several days; raising the fly in the dark largely prevents the degeneration. Thus, the rdgB is a conditional mutant that requires the operation of some stages of the phototransduction cascade to express its characteristic phenotype. We report here experiments that examine the ability of chemical agents to mimic light by causing photoreceptor-specific degeneration in the dark. Application of a specific activator of protein kinase C, phorbol ester, to eyes of rdgB flies led to a degeneration of the photoreceptors that was indistinguishable from that caused by light: both light and phorbol ester-induced degeneration were characterized by (i) selective degeneration of one class of photoreceptors; (ii) a unique pattern of degeneration; and (iii) the appearance of light-induced regenerative spikes at early stages of degeneration. Application of phorbol ester to the eyes of wild-type flies had no effect. We suggest that light or phorbol ester activates a protein kinase C and results in a sustained or excessive phosphorylation of proteins in the rdgB mutant, leading to photoreceptor degeneration. Furthermore, the results are consistent with identification of the rdgB gene product as a phosphoprotein phosphatase that is nonfunctional or absent in the mutant.\r"

The method involves clustering the pairwise similarity scores among a set of related sequences to generate a binary dendrogram (tree). The tree is then reduced in a stepwise manner by progressively replacing the node connecting the two most similar termini by one common pattern until only a single common \"root\" pattern remains. A pattern is generated at a node by (i) performing a local optimal alignment on the sequence/pattern pair connected by the node with the use of an extended dynamic programming algorithm and then (ii) constructing a single common pattern from this alignment with a nested hierarchy of amino acid classes to identify the minimal inclusive amino acid class covering each paired set of elements in the alignment. Gaps within an alignment are created and/or extended using a \"pay once\" gap penalty rule, and gapped positions are converted into gap characters that function as 0 or 1 amino acid of any type during subsequent alignment. This method has been used to generate a library of covering patterns for homologous families in the National Biomedical Research Foundation/Protein Identification Resource protein sequence data base. We show that a covering pattern can be more diagnostic for sequence family membership than any of the individual sequences used to construct the pattern.\r"

Half-maximal stimulation of DNA synthesis was obtained at concentrations of 1 and 2 pM for recombinant PMT (rPMT) and PMT, respectively. The degree of rPMT-induced DNA synthesis was comparable to that elicited by 10% fetal bovine serum and, moreover, was observed in the complete absence of other factors. Cell proliferation was also enhanced by rPMT. The toxin was also a potent mitogen for BALB/c and NIH 3T3 cells, 3T6 cells, and tertiary mouse embryo or human fibroblasts. The mitogenic activity of rPMT was heat-labile. A polyclonal antiserum to PMT inhibited DNA synthesis when added early, but not late, during treatment of the Swiss 3T3 cells with rPMT. A similar time-dependent action of methylamine was also observed. Furthermore, transient exposure of the cells to rPMT at 37 degrees C, but not at 4 degrees C, resulted in a stimulation of DNA synthesis. Thus, toxin action may require cell entry and processing via an acidic compartment. The toxin, at mitogenic concentrations, caused a large increase in the production of inositol phosphates. In contrast, rPMT did not increase the intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP in Swiss 3T3 cells. The basis of rPMT action may afford a unique insight into molecular signaling events involved in the control of cell proliferation.\r"

We have transfected such cells with cDNA for the PDGF B-type receptor, both the wild-type receptor and a mutant form of the receptor (K634A), in which the putative nucleotide-binding lysine of the protein-tyrosine domain has been changed to alanine. Immunoprecipitation studies of metabolically labeled cells showed that both types of receptors were synthesized and processed to the mature form of Mr 190,000. In cells expressing the wild-type receptor, PDGF-BB, the natural ligand for the B-type receptor, induced membrane ruffling and reorganization of actin. Such a response has previously been seen in cells expressing the natural PDGF B-type receptor in response to PDGF-BB. No such effect was induced in nontransfected cells or in cells expressing the K634A mutant receptor. PDGF was also shown to be chemotactic for cells expressing the wild-type receptor, whereas no chemotactic response was elicited in control cells or in cells expressing the K634A mutant receptor. Our study thus provides formal evidence that the PDGF B-type receptor mediates a motility response including actin reorganization and chemotaxis. Furthermore, the results establish a role for the receptor-associated protein-tyrosine kinase in the transduction of the chemotactic signal.\r"

SRIF receptors were detected by measuring the ability of SRIF to inhibit cAMP formation stimulated by beta 2-adrenergic agonists in individual oocytes. beta 2-Adrenergic receptors (beta 2ARs) were expressed in oocytes by coinjecting RNA prepared by in vitro transcription of a beta 2AR cDNA clone with the pituitary cell RNA. Uninjected oocytes do not express detectable levels of either beta 2ARs or SRIF receptors. In oocytes coinjected with AtT20 and beta 2AR RNA, on the other hand, isoproterenol treatment led to a 2- to 3-fold increase in cAMP levels, whereas cotreatment with SRIF reduced this accumulation by 50-60%. The SRIF precursor somatostatin-28 and the cyclohexapeptide agonist MK678 also inhibited cAMP formation, whereas the biologically inactive N-terminal 14-amino acid fragment of somatostatin-28 was ineffective. The ability to detect changes in cAMP levels in individual oocytes may provide a simple procedure for the expression cloning of SRIF receptor cDNAs and other receptors functionally coupled to stimulation or inhibition of adenylate cyclase.\r"

P-glycoprotein is encoded by a small gene family in mammalian cells. Class I and II isoforms cause multidrug resistance, whereas class III does not. In this report, we have characterized three P-glycoprotein-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) by high-resolution epitope mapping with a series of hexapeptides. mAb C494 is gene specific, binding to a sequence present only in the class I isoform of hamster and human. The mAb C32 recognizes a sequence conserved in hamster class I and II isoforms but not in class III isoforms. In contrast, the mAb C219 recognizes a highly conserved amino acid sequence found in all P-glycoprotein isoforms characterized to date. These mAbs were used to reveal differential expression and specific localization of the three P-glycoprotein isoforms in hamster tissues by immunohistochemical staining and competition with epitope-specific peptides. Colonic epithelial cells expressed predominantly the class I isoform in a polarized manner, adrenal cortical cells expressed predominantly the class II isoform, whereas a small percentage of skeletal muscle fibers expressed the class III isoform of P-glycoprotein. These findings suggest that the P-glycoprotein isoforms have distinct physiological roles associated with specialized cell functions.\r"

  ".W": "Many proteins are now known to be anchored to the plasma membrane by a phosphatidylinositol-glycan (PI-G) moiety that is attached to their COOH termini. Placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) has been used as a model for investigating mechanisms involved in the COOH-terminal processing of PI-G-tailed proteins. The COOH-terminal domain of pre-pro-PLAP provides a signal for processing during which a largely hydrophobic 29-residue COOH-terminal peptide is removed, and the PI-G moiety is added to the newly exposed Asp-484 terminus. This cleavage/attachment site was subjected to an almost saturation mutagenesis, and the enzymatic activities, COOH-terminal processing, and cellular localizations of the various mutant PLAP forms were determined. Substitution of Asp-484 by glycine, alanine, cysteine, asparagine, or serine (category I) resulted in PI-G-tailed and enzymatically active proteins. However, not all category I mutant proteins were PI-G tailed to the same extent. Pre-pro-PLAP with other substituents at position 484 (threonine, proline, methionine, valine, leucine, tyrosine, tryptophan, lysine, glutamic acid, and glutamine; category II) were expressed, as well as the category I amino acids, but there was little or no processing to the PI-G-tailed form, and this latter group exhibited very low enzyme activity. The bulk of the PLAP protein produced by category II mutants and some produced by category I mutants were sequestered within the cell, apparently in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Most likely, certain amino acids at residue 484 are preferred because they yield better substrates for the putative \"transamidating\" enzyme. In transfected COS cells, at least, posttranslational PI-G-tail processing does not go to completion even for preferred substrates. Apparently PI-G tailing is a requisite for transport from the ER and for PLAP enzyme activity. Proteins that are not transamidated are apparently retained in the ER in an inactive conformation.\r"

Retraction was accompanied by thiophosphorylation of 19,000-Da myosin light chains when adenosine 5'-[gamma-[35S]thio]triphosphate was included in the medium. Both retraction and thiophosphorylation of myosin light chains exhibited a graded quantitative dependence on Ca2+. When permeabilized monolayers were extracted in buffer D containing 100 mM KCl and 30 mM MgCl2 for 30 min, the cells failed to retract upon exposure to ATP and Ca2+, and no thiophosphorylation of myosin light chains occurred. The ability both to retract and to thiophosphorylate myosin light chains was restored by the addition to the permeabilized, extracted cells of myosin light-chain kinase and calmodulin together but not by either alone. These studies indicate that endothelial cell retraction, as does smooth muscle contraction, depends on myosin light-chain kinase phosphorylation of myosin light chains.\r"

Our data support the correlation between \"upper hinge\" length and Fab segmental flexibility; moreover, we confirm that a hinge region is essential for C1q binding and complement activation. However, the hinge length by itself is not sufficient for complement activity in IgG molecules. We have demonstrated that the IgG4 hinge, which imparts restricted segmental flexibility, reduces the ability of IgG3 molecules to activate complement. We also find that the IgG3 hinge region, which imparts greater segmental motion, is not sufficient to create complement activation activity in IgG4 anti-DNS antibodies. Finally, we conclude that (i) segmental motion is correlated with \"upper hinge\" length, (ii) hinge length and segmental flexibility is not enough to alter complement binding and activation, and (iii) segmental flexibility does not correlate with proficiency to activate the complement cascade.\r"

Therefore, these salting-in agents must be directly contributing to the solvation of a solute such as benzene in water, probably by a direct solvation interaction. The increased surface-tension effects do not overbalance these solvation effects since they are smaller than the large surface-tension increases with lithium chloride, a typical salting-out agent. The salting-in agent tetra-n-butylammonium chloride differs in that it lowers the surface tension of water. Thus, it probably contributes both to easier cavity formation and to direct solvation of the substrate. The previous findings that most salting-in agents switch to become salting-out agents in other polar solvents such as ethylene glycol and formamide but that tetra-n-butylammonium chloride does not switch in these solvents can be understood in terms of relative polarities.\r"

Y2 receptors can bind long C-terminal fragments of NPY-e.g., NPY-(13-36)-peptide. In contrast, Y1 receptors have until now only been characterized as NPY receptors that do not bind such fragments. In the present study an NPY analog is presented, [Leu31, Pro34]NPY, which in a series of human neuroblastoma cell lines and on rat PC-12 cells can displace radiolabeled NPY only from cells that express Y1 receptors and not from those expressing Y2 receptors. The radiolabeled analog, [125I-Tyr36] monoiodo-[Leu31, Pro34]NPY, also binds specifically only to cells with Y1 receptors. The binding of this analog to Y1 receptors on human neuroblastoma cells is associated with a transient increase in cytoplasmic free calcium concentrations similar to the response observed with NPY. [Leu31, Pro34]NPY is also active in vivo as it is even more potent than NPY in increasing blood pressure in anesthetized rats. It is concluded that [Leu31, Pro34]NPY is a specific Y1 receptor agonist and that the analog or variants of it can be useful in delineating the physiological importance of Y1 receptors.\r"

However, the identity of the cortical cells expressing NGFR immunoreactivity has not been established. We have used immunolabeling coupled with [3H]thymidine autoradiography to identify such cells in ferret and cat brain. Polyclonal antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to a conserved amino acid sequence of the NGFR were used for this purpose. Western (immunologic) blot analyses show that these antibodies specifically recognize NGFR and precursor proteins. In both species, NGFR immunoreactivity is primarily associated with the early generated and transient subplate neuron population of the developing neocortex, as indicated by the following evidence: the immunoreactive cells (i) are located directly beneath the developing cortical plate, (ii) frequently have the inverted pyramid shape characteristic of subplate neurons, and (iii) can be labeled by an injection of [3H]thymidine on embryonic day (E) 28, a time when only subplate neurons are being generated. Intense NGFR immunostaining is seen on the cell bodies of these neurons as early as E30, several days after their last round of cell division, and this immunostaining remains strong for approximately 3 weeks. The NGFR immunoreactivity begins to decline around E52 and has disappeared from the region altogether by E60, at which time subplate neurons begin to die. The cellular localization and timing of expression suggest that the NGFR may play a role in the maintenance of subplate neurons and in the maturation of the cerebral cortex.\r"

  ".W": "DNA fragments were constructed in which acetylaminofluorene adducts were introduced specifically at each one of the three different guanines of the 6-base-pair sequence -GGCGCC-. Incubation of the DNA with the UvrABC excision nuclease in vitro revealed major differences in the efficiency of adduct excision depending on the site of modification. Oligonucleotide excision of adducts bound to the second guanine was only 15% as efficient as excision of adducts at the first guanine, whereas the excision efficiency for adducts bound to the third guanine was intermediary. However, recognition of DNA damage appeared to occur with nearly 100% efficiency at all three adduct positions, as judged from DNase I footprint analysis of the DNA/protein binding complexes. Hence, it appears that the structural elements for DNA damage recognition by the UvrABC enzyme are different from the signals for excision. Furthermore, the repair pattern observed is not inversely correlated with the potential of these adducts to induce mutations since mutation analysis of single-adduct DNA has shown that only adducts at the third guanine are strongly premutagenic. We conclude that the effectiveness of excision repair depends on the context of the DNA sequence and that ineffectively repaired adduct sites are not necessarily mutational hot spots.\r"

  ".W": "There are two alternatives concerning the origin of life: the origin may be heterotrophic or autotrophic. The central problem within the theory of an autotrophic origin is the first process of carbon fixation. I here propose the hypothesis that this process is an autocatalytic cycle that can be retrodictively constructed from the extant reductive citric acid cycle by replacing thioesters by thioacids and by assuming that the required reducing power is obtained from the oxidative formation of pyrite (FeS2). This archaic cycle is strictly chemoautotrophic: photoautotrophy is not required. The cycle is catalytic for pyrite formation and autocatalytic for its own multiplication. It is a consequence of this hypothesis that the postulated cycle cannot exist as a single isolated cycle but must be a member of a network of concatenated homologous cycles, from which all anabolic pathways appear to have sprung.\r"

The spectra of deoxy myoglobin at low pH within 6 ms of the pH drop demonstrate that the iron-histidine bond has been ruptured but that the heme is still five-coordinate. Comparison with data from model complexes indicates that a weak-field ligand, such as a water molecule, is coordinated at the fifth position. The Raman spectrum of MbCO at low pH has an Fe-CO stretching mode that is characteristic of a six-coordinate heme with an unhindered Fe-CO moiety. Immediately following the pH drop in this case, there is no indication that the iron-proximal histidine bond is broken. Three different structural changes are detected at low pH: (i) the iron-proximal histidine (F8) bond in ligand-free myoglobin is broken and replaced by a weak-field ligand, (ii) the distal pocket in MbCO is opened, and (iii) protein constraints on the heme group in MbCO are relaxed. Previous conclusions that the kinetics of CO-binding in hemoproteins at low pH is modified by rupturing the iron-proximal histidine bond are supported by these new results which, however, demand a more complete reevaluation of the phenomenon.\r"

Pathophysiologic studies in vitro have pointed to the plasma membrane as a possible target for the cytotoxic action of defensins. We report here that defensins form voltage-dependent, weakly anion-selective channels in planar lipid bilayer membranes, and we suggest that this channel-forming ability contributes to their antimicrobial properties observed in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "Genetic relationships among 315 isolates of the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus expressing toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) recovered primarily from humans with toxic shock syndrome (TSS) in five countries on two continents were determined by analyzing electrophoretically demonstrable allelic variation at 20 chromosomal enzyme loci. Forty-nine distinctive electrophoretic types (ETs), representing multilocus enzyme genotypes, were identified. Cluster analysis of the ETs revealed two major phylogenetic divisions separated at a genetic distance of 0.35 and seven branches diverging from one another at distances greater than or equal to 0.20. A single clone (ET 41) accounted for 88% of cases of TSS with a female urogenital focus and 53% of TSS cases involving nonurogenital (predominantly wound) infections. With few exceptions, strains representing different phylogenetic lines had characteristic TSST-1 gene (tst) restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns obtained by digestion of genomic DNA with Cla I. Strains recovered from ovine and bovine hosts with mastitis were genotypically distinct from the major human TSS clone. The expression of TSST-1 in cell lineages representing the total breadth of multilocus genotypic diversity in the species S. aureus as a whole is interpreted as evidence that the TSST-1 gene is evolutionarily old. The recovery of a single clone from the majority of individuals afflicted with TSS having a urogenital focus and from the genital tract of a large proportion of asymptomatic female carriers strongly suggests that this clone is especially well adapted for colonization of these anatomic sites.\r"

  ".W": "In situ hybridization experiments were performed with brain sections from normal, control and haloperidol-treated rats to identify and map the cells expressing the D2 dopamine receptor gene. D2 receptor mRNA was detected with radioactive or biotinylated oligonucleotide probes. D2 receptor mRNA was present in glandular cells of the pituitary intermediate lobe and in neurons of the substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, and forebrain, especially in caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, and piriform cortex. Hybridization with D2 and preproenkephalin A probes in adjacent sections, as well as combined hybridization with the two probes in the same sections, demonstrated that all detectable enkephalin neurons in the striatum contained the D2 receptor mRNA. Large neurons in caudate putamen, which were unlabeled with the preproenkephalin A probe and which may have been cholinergic, also expressed the D2 receptor gene. Haloperidol treatment (14 or 21 days) provoked an increase in mRNA content for D2 receptor and preproenkephalin A in the striatum. This suggests that the increase in D2 receptor number observed after haloperidol treatment is due to increased activity of the D2 gene. These results indicate that in the striatum, the enkephalin neurons are direct targets for dopamine liberated from mesostriatal neurons.\r"

  ".W": "Regional cerebral blood flow, an index of local neuronal activity, was measured using positron emission tomography (PET) during the performance of the classic Stroop color/word task in eight healthy right-handed subjects. In the first condition of this paradigm, subjects name the color of the words presented on a video monitor. All the words are the color names congruent to the color presented (e.g., the noun \"red\" displayed in red color). In the second condition, subjects also name the color of the words presented on the monitor. However, during these trials all words are color names incongruent to the color presented (e.g., the noun \"red\" displayed in green color). The difference in brain activity between these two conditions (i.e., incongruent minus congruent) could reveal brain systems involved in the attentionally mediated resolution of the conflict between the habitual response of reading words vs. the task demands of naming the color of the words--i.e., the Stroop interference effect. The most robust responses occurred in the anterior cingulate cortex. Other responses noted were in the left premotor cortex, left postcentral cortex, left putamen, supplementary motor area, right superior temporal gyrus, and bilateral peristriate cortices. These data provide support for the role of the anterior cingulate cortex in attentional processing through the selection and recruitment of processing centers appropriate for task execution. Furthermore, the extensive distributed network of activated regions suggests that the Stroop interference effect cannot be explained simply in terms of stimulus encoding or response interference.\r"

InsP3-mediated Ca2+ release was inhibited by elevating the intracellular free Ca2+ level, either by microinjecting Ca2+ into the cell or by applying conditioning light flashes to liberate Ca2+. This inhibition followed a slow time course, being maximal after about 2 s and subsequently declining over several seconds. Negative feedback of Ca2+ ions on InsP3-mediated Ca2+ liberation may explain the oscillatory release of Ca2+ seen during activation of inositol phospholipid signaling in the oocyte, and the time course of the inhibition is consistent with the period of the oscillations.\r"

Exon VIII from the normal and abnormal allelles was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. Amplified DNA product was cloned into plasmid pUC18; clones representing normal and mutant allelles were distinguished by the presence and absence, respectively, of the Pst I restriction site. DNA sequence analysis revealed a G----A mutation in the codon for alanine-436, which would result in replacement with a threonine residue. This position is nine amino acid residues amino-terminal to the reactive-center arginylthreonine peptide bond. In contrast, previously defined mutations in type II hereditary angioneurotic edema result in replacement of the reactive-center arginine.\r"

The labeled RNA was combined and separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The overall size distribution of labeled mRNA was shifted to longer chain lengths in the paired group. In addition, the 3H/14C ratios were markedly increased for 21 distinct size bands, indicating increased mRNA of specific chain lengths in the paired group. Increases in the same size bands were also observed with mRNA labeled in vivo with 32Pi. This indicates that associative learning in Hermissenda results in a specific induction of a distinct set of at least 21 mRNAs, rather than in a generalized increase in synthesis of all mRNA, thus resembling in some respects a differentiation-like response.\r"

Moreover, the sequence CAACGG was found 85 and 146 bases upstream from this site, indicating presumptive binding sites for the Myb protein. Gel-mobility shift assays revealed that a 120-base-pair fragment, which included the G + C-rich, TATA, and CAACGG sequences bound nuclear proteins specifically. DNA-protein complexes with similar gel mobilities were obtained with nuclear extracts from rat forebrain or cerebellum and from neonatal or adult brains.

These sequences identify the alpha' subunit as the product of a gene that is distinct from those encoding the alpha or beta subunits of the membrane-associated rod photoreceptor PDE. Comparisons between the recently determined cGMP-stimulated-PDE sequence and those of the alpha and alpha' photoreceptor PDE subunits reveal an unexpected sequence similarity. In addition to the catalytic domain conserved in eukaryotic PDEs, all three PDEs possess a second conserved segment of approximately 340 residues that contains two internally homologous repeats. Limited proteolysis and direct photolabeling studies indicate that the noncatalytic, cGMP-binding site(s) in the cGMP-stimulated PDE is located within this conserved domain, suggesting that it also may serve this function in the photoreceptor PDEs. Moreover, other PDEs that do not bind cGMP at noncatalytic sites do not contain this conserved domain. The function of the conserved segment in the photoreceptor PDEs is not known, but the homology to allosteric sites of the cGMP-stimulated PDE suggests a role in cGMP binding and modulation of enzyme activity.\r"

A library of sensitive, sequence-specific immunoassays for progastrin and its products was used to monitor extractions and chromatography before and after cleavage with processing-like enzymes. The results showed that progastrin and its products are expressed in the pancreas of all species in total concentrations varying from 0.3 to 58.9 pmol/g of tissue (medians). The degree of processing was age- and species-dependent. In comparison with adult pancreatic tissue the fetal or neonatal pancreas processed a higher fraction to bioactive, C-terminally amidated gastrin. Nevertheless, the pancreatic processing was always less complete than that of the adult antral mucosa. The moderate level of expression and the attenuated processing in the adult pancreas contribute to explain previous failures to detect gastrin in normal pancreatic tissue. Our results indicate that gastrin-producing tumors in the pancreas are not ectopic, but arise from cells that normally express the gastrin gene.\r"

The cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli harboring the expression plasmid construct pGTDml-KK. The active enzyme, designated as Drosophila glutathione S-transferase 1-1, had a specific activity toward 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene comparable to that for the mammalian glutathione S-transferases but did not have as broad a substrate specificity pattern. There is a region of 44 amino acids in this enzyme that shares 66% identity with an analogous region of maize glutathione S-transferase III. Drosophila glutathione S-transferase 1-1 had no obvious homology to any mammalian or parasitic glutathione S-transferases. The gene was found to be a member of a multigene family.\r"

When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, rat IIA channels display a current-voltage relationship that is shifted 20-25 mV in the depolarizing direction relative to channels expressed from rat II cDNA or rat brain poly(A)+ mRNA. By modifying each variant residue in rat IIA to the corresponding residue in rat II, we demonstrate that a single Phe----Leu substitution at position 860 in the S4 segment of domain II is sufficient to shift the current-voltage relationship to that observed for channels expressed from rat brain poly(A)+ RNA or rat II cDNA. Rat genomic DNA encodes leucine but not phenylalanine at position 860, indicating that the phenylalanine at this position in rat IIA cDNA likely results from reverse transcriptase error.\r"

To determine if uninfected cells can utilize bicistronic genes, a bovine papilloma virus-based vector system was used to select mouse C127 cell lines containing multiple integrated copies of the reovirus S1 gene. These cell lines produced both reovirus polypeptides from a single mRNA. In addition, studies of COS cells transfected with the S1 gene containing small changes around the first AUG suggest that bicistronic mRNA translation is regulated at the level of elongation. A model is proposed in which ribosomes engaged in translation of one reading frame interfere with movement of ribosomes in the other frame because of differences in codon usage. Expression of bicistronic genes may be similarly regulated in virus-infected cells.\r"

An initial electron density map was obtained with phase information from a total of six isomorphous heavy-atom derivatives (from two different compounds) and a molecular replacement solution using the HED10 Fab crystal structure as a model. The structure of the McPC603 Fab was used to provide an initial set of atomic coordinates. The electron density maps are clear and easily interpretable for the entire sequence except for sections from two of the heavy-chain complementarity-determining regions totaling 21 residues. These residues have been left out of the refinement and are not represented in our current model. The antigen-combining site was located by means of a difference Fourier synthesis with one of the heavy-atom derivatives, which contained arsanilic acid. It lies in a small pocket formed by residues from the hypervariable regions of both the heavy and the light chains. Interactions with the hapten from framework residues are also possible.\r"

Class II molecules are heterodimers consisting of one alpha and one beta chain. Here we report that each isolated alpha and beta chain binds antigenic peptides and that this binding is specific. The specificity of peptide binding was investigated by employing the murine major histocompatibility complex haplotypes I-Ad and I-Ek and fluorescence-labeled peptides of chicken ovalbumin and pigeon cytochrome c, respectively, which are known to be specific for these haplotypes. The major histocompatibility complex molecules were incubated with these peptides and subjected to SDS/PAGE under nondenaturing conditions. The gels were then scanned for the fluorescent peptides and, after silver staining, for proteins. We found that the fluorescence-labeled peptide fragment of ovalbumin bound preferentially to the isolated alpha and beta chains of I-Ad, whereas the fluorescence-labeled peptide fragment of pigeon cytochrome c bound preferentially to the isolated alpha and beta chains of I-Ek. The alpha and beta chains of each haplotype bound their specific peptides about equally well, suggesting comparable affinities. Our results indicate that in vivo the kinetic pathway for the formation of antigenic peptide complexes with the alpha/beta heterodimers may involve the initial formation of complexes of the alpha and/or beta chains with the specific antigenic peptides.\r"

This construct was used to assure that the integrated CAT gene was driven by the promoter of the LTR. Expression of the CAT gene was stimulated 4-fold by UV irradiation, and the peak of activity was observed at 18 hr. In contrast, stimulation of the CAT expression after x-irradiation was 2-fold and occurred at 6 hr. Phorbol myristate acetate also stimulated CAT activity 4-fold with a peak at 6 hr. Down-regulation of protein kinase C blocked totally the response to x-irradiation but only partially the response to UV.

Deletion analysis has demonstrated that there are at least two domains in this 5' flanking region that contribute to 1,25(OH)2D3 responsiveness; however, only the downstream region is able to confer 1,25(OH)2D3 responsiveness to either the native osteocalcin promoter or to a heterologous viral promoter (herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase). The proximal region responsible for 1,25(OH)2D3 induction of the rat osteocalcin gene lies 458 base pairs upstream from the transcription start site of this gene. A 25-base-pair oligonucleotide corresponding to the sequences in this region is able to confer 1,25(OH)2D3 responsiveness to the thymidine kinase promoter in an orientation-independent fashion. This sequence contains three copies of a short sequence that are homologous to \"half-sites\" of steroid response elements. Gel-retardation assays using porcine intestinal nuclear extract as a rich source of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor demonstrated retardation in the migration of probes containing the sequence noted above. A monoclonal antibody directed against the 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor caused further retardation in the migration of these protein-DNA complexes. Therefore, the sequences represented in this oligonucleotide encompass the sequences necessary for binding of the 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor to DNA as well as those sequences necessary for 1,25(OH)2D3 to induce osteocalcin gene transcription.\r"

In addition, other hsp70 homologues have been found in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria and, at least for the endoplasmic reticulum hsp70 homologue, may be involved in the proper folding and assembly of newly transported proteins. Since chloroplasts are an important site of protein transport in plant cells, we were interested in determining whether hsp70 proteins might be located in this organelle. By using immunoblotting techniques and two antibody preparations against hsp70 proteins, we have identified three chloroplastic proteins of approximately 70 kDa that are related to hsp70 proteins. One of these proteins was tightly associated with the outer envelope membrane and was not exposed at the outer surface of the chloroplasts. The other two were soluble proteins located in the stroma. Steady-state levels of the chloroplastic hsp70 homologues did not change after heat stress nor were any additional hsp70 homologues detected in chloroplasts isolated from heat-stressed plants. We discuss the possible functions of these hsp70 homologues in the transport of proteins into and within chloroplasts.\r"

  ".W": "The rat alpha-myosin heavy-chain (alpha-MHC) gene is regulated by 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) in ventricular myocardium and is constitutively expressed in atrial tissue. Less is known about regulation of the human gene, but conservation of sequences in the 5'-flanking region between the rat and human alpha-MHC genes suggests that the human gene may be regulated similarly. Accordingly, T3-responsiveness and tissue-specific expression of human and rat alpha-MHC/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fusion constructs have been compared in rat fetal heart cells, L6E9 myoblasts and myotubes, 3T3 fibroblasts, and HeLa cells. Transient transfection assays revealed a complex series of cis-regulatory elements in the 5'-flanking sequences in the human genes, including a basal promoter element with canonical TATAA and CAAT sequences, two positive regulatory element(s), and two negative regulatory elements, which markedly diminished both constitutive and T3-inducible activity. Interestingly, the human gene seemed to contain a proximal thyroid-hormone response element(s) not found in the rat gene. In L6E9 myoblasts and myotubes, the human constructs were constitutively expressed but not T3-regulated; none of the constructs were active in 3T3 or HeLa cells. We propose that interactions among the thyroid hormone responsive elements and other cis-acting elements in the human alpha-MHC 5'-flanking sequences may be sufficient to explain the characteristic features of expression of this gene in cardiac tissues.\r"

This catalase-like activity is directly proportional to the concentrations of Mn(II) and H2O2, and it increases exponentially with increases in pH. The effect of increasing pH is almost completely attributable to the concomitant increase in HCO3- concentration. The rate is proportional to the third power of the HCO3- concentration, suggesting that 3 equivalents of HCO3- combine with 1 equivalent of Mn(II) to form the catalytic complex. It is presumed that the redox potential of the Mn(II) in equilibrium with Mn(III) couple in such a complex permits H2O2 to carry out facile reactions with Mn(II) comparable to those that occur with Fe(III) and Cu(II) chelate complexes, in which OH. and O2-. are established intermediates. The Mn-catalyzed disproportionation of H2O2 does not occur at physiological pH in the absence of HCO3-. Hepes, inorganic phosphate, and inorganic pyrophosphate inhibit the reaction catalyzed by the Mn/HCO3- system. These results are similar to those of Sychev et al. [Sychev, A.Y., Pfannmeller, U. & Isak, V.G. (1983) Russ. J. Phys. Chem. 57, 1690-1693]. The catalase-like activity of Mn(II)-bicarbonate complexes reported here, together with the superoxide dismutase activity of Mn complexes demonstrated by Archibald and Fridovich [Archibald, F.S. & Fridovich, I. (1982) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 214, 452-463], strengthen the proposition that Mn may play an important role in the protection of cells against oxygen radical-mediated damage.\r"

  ".W": "In bicarbonate/CO2 buffer, Mn(II) and Fe(II) catalyze the oxidation of amino acids by H2O2 and the dismutation of H2O2. As the Mn(II)/Fe(II) ratio is increased, the yield of carbonyl compounds per mole of leucine oxidized is essentially constant, but the ratio of alpha-ketoisocaproate to isovaleraldehyde formed increases, and the fraction of H2O2 converted to O2 increases. In the absence of Fe(II), the rate of Mn(II)-catalyzed leucine oxidation is directly proportional to the H2O2, Mn(II), and amino acid concentrations and is proportional to the square of the HCO3- concentration. The rate of Mn(II)-catalyzed O2 production in the presence of 50 mM alanine or leucine is about 4-fold the rate observed in the absence of amino acids and accounts for about half of the H2O2 consumed; the other half of the H2O2 is consumed in the oxidation of the amino acids. In contrast, O2 production is increased nearly 18-fold by the presence of alpha-methylalanine and accounts for about 90% of the H2O2 consumed. The data are consistent with the view that H2O2 decomposition is an inner sphere (cage-like) process catalyzed by a Mn coordination complex of the composition Mn(II), amino acid, (HCO3-)2. Oxidation of the amino acid in this complex most likely proceeds by a free radical mechanism involving hydrogen abstraction from the alpha-carbon as a critical step. The results demonstrate that at physiological concentrations of HCO3- and CO2, Mn(II) is able to facilitate Fenton-type reactions.\r"

Superoxide and hydroxyl radicals (O2-. and OH.) were trapped by a spin trap, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-1-oxide (DMPO), in a reaction mixture containing Mn(II) and H2O2 in bicarbonate/CO2 buffer. When Hepes was used in place of bicarbonate buffer, superoxide radical was not observed, indicating the importance of bicarbonate buffer. With addition of L-leucine to a similar reaction mixture, a leucine-derived radical that replaced the DMPO-superoxide adduct was detected in the absence and presence of DMPO. Using various isotope-enriched L-leucines, we successfully identified this radical as a hydronitroxide, -OOC(R)CHNHO.. The data are consistent with the formation of a transient \"caged\" OH. in the inner coordination sphere of Mn(II). This caged OH. is likely to undergo an intramolecular hydrogen-atom abstraction from the Mn-bound H2O2 or amino acid. Two reaction schemes are proposed to account for the experimental results shown here and in the preceding papers.\r"

The study focused on fibronectin because the increased amounts of this glycoprotein found in diabetic tissues and thickened basement membranes are as yet unexplained. In streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, fibronectin mRNA levels were increased to 304 +/- 295% of control (mean +/- SD) in the kidney cortex (P less than 0.02), and to 271 +/- 273% of control in the heart (P less than 0.02), while actin mRNA levels remained unchanged. Elevation of fibronectin mRNA persisted for weeks after restoration of near-normoglycemia. In cultured human endothelial cells, high glucose-induced overexpression of fibronectin and collagen IV remained detectable after replating and multiple cell divisions in the absence of high glucose. Cells shifted to normal-glucose medium after prolonged exposure to high glucose also exhibited a proliferative advantage over cells chronically maintained in normal glucose. Thus, diabetes increases fibronectin expression in tissues that are known targets of the complications, and the effect is not readily reversible. The in vitro studies suggest that hyperglycemia may be responsible for these events through induction of self-perpetuating changes in gene expression.\r"

  ".W": "Myosin light chain phosphorylation in permeable skeletal muscle fibers increases isometric force and the rate of force production at submaximal levels of calcium activation; myosin light chain phosphorylation may underlie the increased rate and extent of force production associated with isometric twitch potentiation in intact fibers. To understand the mechanism by which myosin light chain phosphorylation manifests these effects, we have measured isometric force, isometric stiffness, rate of isometric force redevelopment after isotonic shortening, and isometric ATPase activity in permeabilized rabbit psoas muscle fibers. These measurements were made in the presence and absence of myosin light chain phosphorylation over a range of calcium concentrations that caused various levels of activation. The results were analyzed with a two-state cross-bridge cycle model as suggested by Brenner [Brenner, B. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 3265-3269]. The results indicate that myosin light chain phosphorylation exerts its effect on force generation and the isometric rate of force redevelopment in striated muscle through a single mechanism, namely, by increasing the rate constant describing the transition from non-force-generating cross-bridges to force-generating states (fapp). gapp, the reverse rate constant, is unaffected by phosphorylation as are the number of cycling cross-bridges. Since both calcium and myosin light chain phosphorylation increase fapp, the possibility is considered that modulation of fapp may represent a general mechanism for regulating force in actin-myosin systems.\r"

  ".U": "90115889\r", 
  ".W": "The disulfide crosslinking pattern of human placental insulin receptor was investigated using selective reduction with tributylphosphine followed by alkylation with N-[3H]ethylmaleimide. Insulin receptor contains a single sulfhydryl group in each beta subunit whose alkylation with N-[3H]ethylmaleimide inhibits receptor autophosphorylation. Alkylation is partially inhibited by ATP or the nonhydrolyzable substrate analog adenosine 5'-[beta,gamma-imido]triphosphate when the nucleotides are added as Mn2+ complexes. Neither insulin nor 6 M guanidinium chloride renders additional sulfhydryl groups accessible to alkylation. When the receptor is reduced under drastic conditions with tributylphosphine in guanidinium chloride, 32 of the 37 sulfhydryl groups in the receptor's alpha subunit can be alkylated with N-[3H]ethylmaleimide. Surprisingly only three of the 10 cysteines in the beta subunit become titratable under identical conditions. By using highly selective reducing conditions, we were able to determine quantitatively the maximum number of disulfide bridges that link the two alpha beta halves to form the tetrameric structure and those that couple the alpha to the beta subunits. Liberation of two sulfhydryl groups in the alpha and one in the beta subunit resulted in formation of alpha beta dimers. Free beta subunit was formed when an additional disulfide bond was reduced. It is remarkable that the tetrameric structure of this highly complex receptor molecule, which contains a large number of cysteine residues, is maintained by such a small number of disulfide bonds. Three models of the arrangement of the labile disulfide bonds, consistent with these findings, are proposed.\r"

  ".W": "Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C isozyme gamma (PLC-gamma, Mr 145,000) is an excellent substrate for the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor both in vivo and in vitro. PLC-beta-1, another PLC isozyme, is a poor substrate for the EGF receptor. We examined the relative phosphorylation of PLC-gamma and PLC-beta-1 by the 170-kDa native EGF receptor molecule, the 66-kDa cytoplasmic kinase domain of the EGF receptor (Arg647-Ala1186), the alpha 2 beta 2 native insulin receptor, and the 48-kDa cytoplasmic kinase domain of the insulin receptor beta subunit (Gly947-Ser1343). Similar to the intact EGF receptor, the cytoplasmic kinase domain of the EGF receptor preferentially phosphorylated PLC-gamma. High-performance liquid chromatographic comparison of tryptic phosphopeptides from PLC-gamma phosphorylated by both forms of the EGF receptor kinase indicated similar patterns of multiple tyrosine phosphorylations. These results imply that substrate selectivity, at least in terms of PLC isozymes, is independent of the extracellular ligand-binding and membrane anchor domains of the EGF receptor. In comparison, neither the intact insulin receptor nor the beta-chain kinase domain was able to phosphorylate PLC-gamma to a significant extent. Also, insulin failed to stimulate the phosphorylation of PLC-gamma in NIH 3T3/HIR cells, which overexpress the human insulin receptor. Thus PLC-gamma is not a phosphorylation substrate for the insulin receptor in vitro or in the intact cell.\r"

FHV was found in whole plants of barley (Hordeum vulgare), cowpea (Vigna sinensis), chenopodium (Chenopodium hybridum), tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), and Nicotiana benthamiana and in protoplasts derived from barley leaves. Virions produced in plants contained newly synthesized RNA as well as newly synthesized capsid protein. These results show that the intracellular environment in these plants is suitable for synthesis of a virus normally indigenous only to insects. Such synthesis involves, minimally, translation of viral RNA, RNA replication, and virion assembly. Inoculation of barley protoplasts with FHV virions resulted in synthesis of small amounts of progeny virions, suggesting that FHV virions are capable of releasing their RNA in plant cells. In N. benthamiana, virions resulting from inoculation with RNA were detected not only in inoculated leaves but also in other leaves of inoculated plants, suggesting that virions could move in this plant species. Such movement probably occurs by a passive transport through the vascular system rather than by an active transport involving mechanisms that have evolved for plant viruses.\r"

These studies demonstrate the feasibility of introducing a functional human ADA gene into hematopoietic stem cells and obtaining expression in multiple hematopoietic lineages long after transplantation. This approach should be helpful in designing effective gene therapies for severe combined immunodeficiency syndromes in humans.\r"

The studies utilized the WF (u) and DA (a) strains and monoclonal antibodies to all of the class I antigens involved. All four mating combinations of the two strains showed that only paternal antigens were expressed in the placenta and that they were limited to the basal trophoblast. This conclusion was confirmed using embryo transfer experiments. In allogeneic natural matings, the allele-specific class I transplantation antigens were not expressed on the membrane of the basal trophoblast but they were expressed in embryo transfers involving embryos of the same genotype. In both types of pregnancies, the pregnancy-associated (Pa) antigen was present on the membrane of the basal trophoblast. The antibody response to DA X DA and to WF X DA embryos transferred into pseudopregnant WF females was against the allele-specific RT1.Aa antigen and the Pa antigen, whereas the antibody response to the heterozygous embryo in the natural WF (female) X DA (male) mating was against the Pa antigen only. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the suppression of the expression of the allele-specific major histocompatibility complex class I antigens occurs shortly after fertilization and that it requires the uterine environment of a natural mating.\r"

Afferents with ON-center responses end in the upper part of layer IV (IVa) whereas afferents with OFF-center responses end in the lower part of layer IV (IVb). Within each tier, axons driven by the ipsilateral and contralateral eye overlap.

Atrial strips were exposed to various concentrations of halothane, rapidly frozen, cryo-sectioned, and cryo-transferred into an electron microscope. Irradiation of the hydrated cryosections with the electron beam caused halothane radiolysis, which allowed retention of the halogen-containing fragments after dehydration of the sections. The bromine from halothane was detected and quantified with x-ray microanalysis in various microregions of atrial myocytes. Halothane (bromine) partitioned largely to mitochondria, with progressively lower concentrations in sarcolemma, nuclear membrane, cytoplasm, sarcomere, and nucleus. Partitioning could not be explained solely by distribution of cellular lipid, suggesting significant and differential physicochemical solubility in protein. However, we found no saturable compartment in atrial myocytes within the clinical concentration range, which implies little specific protein binding.\r"

The presumptive amino acid sequence of the protein (O2) specified by the O2 cDNA contains a \"leucine-zipper\" domain characteristic of some mammalian and fungal transcription activation factors. lacZ-O2 fusion constructs, using nearly the entire coding region of O2 or only a fragment specifying the leucine-zipper domain, were expressed in Escherichia coli. In an in vitro binding assay, the beta-galactosidase-O2 fusion proteins bound to two specific regions on the 5' side of the coding sequence in a zein genomic clone.

  ".W": "Human papilloma virus (HPV) types 16 and 18 are most commonly associated with cervical carcinoma in patients and induce immortalization of human keratinocytes in culture. HPV has not been associated with breast cancer. This report describes the immortalization of normal human mammary epithelial cells (76N) by plasmid pHPV18 or pHPV16, each containing the linearized viral genome. Transfectants were grown continuously for more than 60 passages, whereas 76N cells senesce after 18-20 passages. The transfectants also differ from 76N cells in cloning in a completely defined medium called D2 and growing in a minimally supplemented defined medium (D3) containing epidermal growth factor. All transfectants tested contain integrated HPV DNA, express HPV RNA, and produce HPV E7 protein. HPV transfectants do not form tumors in a nude mouse assay. It is concluded that products of the HPV genome induce immortalization of human breast epithelial cells and reduce their growth factor requirements. This result raises the possibility that HPV might be involved in breast cancer. Furthermore, other tissue-specific primary epithelial cells that are presently difficult to grow and investigate may also be immortalized by HPV.\r"

  ".U": "90115902\r", 
  ".W": "Cell transformation in culture is marked by the appearance of morphologically altered cells that continue to multiply to form discrete foci in confluent sheets when the surrounding cells are inhibited. These foci occur spontaneously in early-passage NIH 3T3 cells grown to confluency in 10% calf serum (CS) but are not seen in cultures grown to confluency in 2% CS. However, repeated passage of the cells at low density in 2% CS gives rise to an adapted population that grows to increasingly higher saturation densities and produces large numbers of foci in 2% CS. The increased saturation density of the adapted population in 2% CS is retained upon repeated passage in 10% CS, but the number and size of the foci produced in 2% CS gradually decrease under this regime. Clonal analysis confirms that the focus-forming potential of most if not all of the cells in a population increases in response to a continuously applied growth constraint, although only a small fraction of the population may actually form foci in a given assay. The acquired capacity for focus formation varies widely in clones derived from the adapted population and changes in diverse ways upon further passage of the clones. We propose that the adaptive changes result from progressive selection of successive phenotypic variations in growth capacity that occur spontaneously. The process designated progressive state selection resolves the apparent dichotomy between spontaneous mutation with selection on the one hand and induction on the other, by introducing selection among fluctuating states or metabolic patterns rather than among genetically altered cells.\r"

The factors that govern helical preference include the inherent relative stability of the alpha-helix compared with the 3(10)-helix, the extra hydrogen bond seen with 3(10)-helices, and the enhanced electrostatic dipolar interaction of the 3(10)-helix when packed in a crystalline lattice. The balance of these forces, when combined with the steric requirements of the amino acid side chains, determines the relative stability of the two helical conformations under a given set of experimental conditions.\r"

The human studies were conducted in a 1.5-T Magnetom magnetic resonance imager (Siemens), and the rabbit studies were conducted in a 4.7-T GE/Nicolet 33-cm bore magnet. Free 5FU was detected in the tumors of four of the six patients and in all VX2 tumors but not in normal rabbit tissues. No other metabolites were seen in these tumors, contrary to the extensive catabolism we had previously documented using 19F NMR spectroscopy in both human and animal livers. The tumor pool of free 5FU in those human tumors that trapped 5FU was determined to have a half-life of 0.4-2.1 hr, much longer than expected and significantly longer than the half-life of 5FU in blood (5-15 min), whereas the half-life of trapped 5FU in the VX2 tumors ranged from 1.05 to 1.22 hr. In this initial experience, patient response to chemotherapy may correlate with extent of trapping free 5FU in the human tumors. These studies document that NMR spectroscopy is clinically feasible in vivo, allows noninvasive pharmacokinetic analyses at a drug-target tissue in real time, and may produce therapeutically important information at the time of drug administration. Demonstration of the trapping of 5FU in tumors provides both a model for studying metabolic modulation in experimental tumors (in animals) and a method for testing modulation strategies clinically (in patients).\r"

TK-/- mutant colonies show a bimodal size distribution, reflecting a difference in the growth rates of the two size classes that is hypothesized to result from different degrees of genetic damage. The two homologous chromosomes 11 containing the alleles of the Tk gene in L5178Y 3.7.2C TK+/- cells are distinguishable at the cytogenetic level. We find, in addition, that the two alleles are distinguishable at the molecular level because of an Nco I restriction fragment length polymorphism at the 3' end of the gene. In a set of 51 large-colony and 48 small-colony TK-/- mutants induced by ionizing radiation or by chemical mutagens, we find that 78, including all except one of the small-colony mutants, have lost the Tk+ allele and that some of these have two to four copies of the remaining Tk- allele. Nineteen of the large-colony TK-/- mutants that do not show Tk+ allele loss show no other structural changes detectable at the level of Southern blot analysis. One shows a partial deletion. The variety of mutagenic lesions recorded at the heterozygous Tk locus may be representative of events observed in human malignancy and may include a wider range of mutagenic events than can be observed at hemizygous test loci.\r"

  ".W": "Transformed fibroblasts coinoculated with epithelial cells accelerated the growth and shortened the latency period of human epithelial tumors in athymic mice. Addition of NbF-1 fibroblasts caused epithelial tumors to grow from five marginally tumorigenic or \"nontumorigenic\" (nontumor-forming) human tumor cell lines or strains: PC-3 (prostate), WH (bladder), MDA-436 (breast), and cells derived from the ascites fluids of patients with metastatic renal pelvic or prostate cancers. Evidence for the human and epithelial nature of these experimental tumors was provided by histologic, immunohistochemical, Southern and dot-blot hybridization, and cytogenetic analyses. Transformed fibroblasts induced predominantly carcinosarcomas, whereas nontumorigenic fibroblasts (NIH 3T3) and lethally irradiated transformed fibroblasts induced exclusively carcinomas. The fibroblast-epithelial interaction appears to occur bidirectionally and does not result from cell fusion. Because coculture experiments in vitro did not demonstrate an increased cell proliferation, it appears that undefined host factors can influence tumor growth. This tumor model may be useful in drug-screening programs and in mechanistic studies of factors regulating human tumor growth and progression.\r"

Cytolytic lymphocytes incubated in the presence of toxic concentrations of Leu-Leu-OMe were found to contain membranolytic metabolites of the structure (Leu-Leu)n-OMe, where n greater than or equal to 3. The sensitivity of cytotoxic lymphocytes to Leu-Leu-OMe was found to be dependent upon production of these metabolites by a lysosomal thiol protease, dipeptidyl peptidase I, which is present at far higher levels in cytotoxic lymphocytes than in cells without cytolytic potential or not of bone marrow origin. Thus, this granule enzyme is required for the unique effects of Leu-Leu-OMe and may provide a target for the development of other immunotherapeutic agents designed to delete cytotoxic lymphocyte responses.\r"

Comparison of amino acid sequences deduced from the cDNA clones and the sequence of peptides derived from purified proteins show that these clones encode the pathogenesis-related proteins PR-P and PR-Q. The cDNA inserts were not homologous to either the bacterial form of chitinase or the form from cucumber but shared significant homology to the basic form of chitinase from tobacco and bean. The acidic isoforms of tobacco chitinase did not contain the amino-terminal, cysteine-rich \"hevein\" domain found in the basic isoforms, indicating that this domain, which binds chitin, is not essential for chitinolytic activity. The accumulation of mRNA for the pathogenesis-related proteins PR-1, PR-R, PR-P, and PR-Q in Xanthi.nc tobacco leaves following infection with tobacco mosaic virus was measured by primer extension. The results indicate that the induction of these proteins during the local necrotic lesion response to the virus is coordinated at the mRNA level.\r"

The objectives included determining 1) the Scoliometer's screening capability and validity and 2) the intrarater and interrater reliability of Scoliometer measurements. Scoliometer measurements made by two raters on 65 persons with idiopathic scoliosis were correlated with radiographic assessment of vertebral (pedicle) rotation and lateral curvature (Cobb method). Correlation ranged from .32 to .46 with pedicle rotation and from .46 to .54 with the Cobb angle. Frequency analysis revealed relatively good specificity, sensitivity, and predictive capability of the Scoliometer. Intrarater and interrater reliability coefficients were high (r = .86-.97). These results indicate good measurement reproducibility. The less-than-optimal between-method correlation coefficients suggest that the validity of Scoliometer measurements is not sufficient to use this method alone for determining patient diagnosis and management. Based on the positive-frequency analysis, however, the use of this tool as a screening device would be appropriate.\r"

The analysis of the data provided by the respondents (N = 127; 97.6%) revealed the following: 1) the respondents' primary scholarly activity was authorship of referred journal articles; 2) a majority of the respondents presented a paper at a professional meeting during the past three years; 3) only a small percentage of the respondents had directed extramurally funded projects; 4) the majority of the respondents indicated that their own academic preparation was the primary factor that encouraged their scholarly pursuits and that heavy teaching and administrative responsibilities were the primary discouraging factors; and 5) the respondents indicated that faculty scholarly activities are, and will continue to be, important considerations in academic promotion decisions. Comparison of the data provided by these respondents with data from the 1983 American Physical Therapy Association physical therapy faculty survey suggests modest gains in scholarly productivity. The implications of these findings are that faculty development programs are warranted and physical therapy administrators and faculty should join forces in finding more effective ways to involve faculty in research activities.\r"

This report describes the assessment of TMJ mobility and the occurrence of symptoms of TMJ dysfunction in four halo-braced subjects with SCI. The results of these assessments indicate that patients with SCI may have some limitations in mandibular mobility early on and may complain of some symptoms associated with TMJ dysfunction. Reasons for the possibility of TMJ dysfunction occurring in this population and the importance of this occurrence to physical therapists are discussed. The author proposes that physical therapists treating halo-braced spinal cord injured patients should be aware of symptoms indicating TMJ dysfunction and that assessment may be indicated. Additionally, ideas for further clinical research are suggested.\r"

The number of accelerations and decelerations (movement units) were measured in addition to movement time, distance of path (directedness), and associated reactions. Each subject performed several reaches before and following one treatment session. Following treatment, reaches were significantly faster, smoother (fewer movement units), and more mature. This study supports the hypotheses that neurodevelopmental treatment can produce immediate changes in the kinematic properties of reaching and that kinematic data can be used to quantitatively describe components of movement (eg, smoothness) that have traditionally been described qualitatively.\r"

Twenty-four normally developing children aged 4 through 9 years participated in the study. Time and quality of balance on one leg and degrees of tilt on a tiltboard prior to postural adjustment were measured. Both tests were completed with eyes open and with eyes closed. Interrater reliability was examined using two raters. Test-retest reliability, with a one-week interval between test and retest, was examined for a subgroup consisting of 12 children. Spearman rank-order correlation coefficients were used as indexes of both interrater and test-retest reliability for time and degrees of tilt. To supplement the correlation coefficients, the magnitudes of difference between raters' scores and between test and retest scores were calculated. Spearman coefficients were moderate to high for one-leg balance when scores for both feet were combined for both eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. The magnitude of difference between scores was low, indicating good agreement between raters and across time. Interrater and test-retest reliabilities of quality of one-leg standing balance were examined by calculating percentages of agreement and Cohen's Kappa statistics. Results of these analyses revealed the need for further study. The Spearman coefficients for the interrater tiltboard test were high; however, the test-retest coefficients were low. The magnitudes of difference between scores were small for the two raters, but large for test and retest. These results are important to consider when using these tests for initial evaluation or for monitoring patient progress.\r"

A secondary purpose was to examine the relationship between balance strategy scores and the patterns of muscle responses as determined by electromyographic analysis on the PST. Postural responses to backward sway of 17 healthy subjects, aged 60 to 79 years (means = 69.0, s = 5.3), were characterized bilaterally by EMG recording of the tibialis anterior, quadriceps femoris, gastrocnemius, and hamstring muscles. We examined three measures of bilateral postural responses: 1) latency to first muscle response (FR) among the four lower extremity muscle groups, 2) tibialis anterior muscle latency (TA), and 3) patterns of muscle responses. Our results demonstrated significantly shorter (p less than .001) TAs and FRs (in milliseconds) on the PST than on the PP (PST TA: = means = 80.3, s = 12.4; PP TA: = means = 142.6, s = 13.4; PST FR: means = 75.9, s = 10.4; PP FR: = means = 140.4, s = 13.6). The ankle strategy was the most frequently used pattern of muscle response during both the PP and the PST, but it occurred less frequently on the PST than on the PP (PP = 72.5%, PST = 50.9%) (p less than .05). No consistent relationship was observed between the balance strategy scores as determined by videotape analysis of the PST and the patterns of muscle responses as determined by EMG analysis.\r"

A group of 110 physical therapy students had been randomly divided into two groups for teaching purposes. All students had previously learned mobilization of peripheral joints and were currently learning spinal mobilization. From one of the groups, 22 students volunteered to comprise a control group, which was taught a spinal mobilization technique in the traditional way. Additional concurrent quantitative feedback of the level of force applied to the patient was given to 31 volunteers from the other group. These students formed the experimental group. A force plate was used for force measurement, and the feedback was given via an oscilloscope. The average force applied by the students' instructors was taken as an \"ideal\" force. The oscilloscope showed both the applied force and the \"ideal\" force. Consistency was measured by the variance of the group's performance. Accuracy was assessed by calculating the difference between the applied force and the \"ideal\" force. Results indicated that this feedback was associated with a significant improvement in accuracy and consistency in the application of the mobilizing force. This improvement was still present at a follow-up test conducted one week later. This result supports a greater use of such feedback in the teaching and practice of joint mobilization techniques, although the need for further research is emphasized.\r"

All patients had renal biopsies and characteristic changes, but no dense deposit variant was seen. HBsAg was positive in 20 per cent of the patients tested whereas in the general population it was about 10 per cent. Nephrotic syndrome was the commonest presentation. There was a mean delay of 8.5 months between the onset of symptoms and renal biopsy. Nineteen patients were given steroid/immunosuppressive therapy while 27 received no specific treatment. At the time of review, renal function was stable in 13 patients but progressively deteriorating in 33. In the latter, the slope of the graph of reciprocal of creatinine versus time could be accurately determined. Steroid/immunosuppressive therapy did not influence the rate of progression of renal failure but appeared to hasten and induce more partial remissions of the nephrotic state. There was no difference in cumulative renal survival between treated and untreated patients, and between HBsAg-positive and negative patients. Overall, 23 patients required dialysis/renal transplantation and an additional four had died of end-stage renal failure at the time of this review.\r"

The mean age at menopause was similar in smokers and non-smokers and in those diagnosed before and after the menopause. The mean age at menopause was between 46 and 47. A logistic analysis using the 'status quo' method showed that 50 per cent of women with Crohn's disease had the menopause at 47.6 years compared with 49.6 years in a group of healthy women from the same area. The two groups had similar smoking habits and it would seem that a premature menopause is associated with Crohn's disease.\r"

We report the clinical features of the 80 patients. Seventy-eight snored and 70 were somnolent, each falling asleep at least once each day when not in bed. Ten reported falling asleep whilst driving or flying. Twenty-nine slept restlessly, 28 were not refreshed by sleep and 21 had nocturnal choking attacks. Ankle swelling was reported by 26 and 25 were hypertensive (diastolic BP greater than 95 mmHg). Two had hyperthyroidism and one acromegaly. Nineteen have been successfully treated by continuous positive airway pressure therapy at home. The data suggest that regional centres should be established in Britain to diagnose and treat this condition.\r"

Fetal M-mode mapping has also enabled us to detect and diagnose fetal arrhythmias as well as follow their treatment. More recently, pulsed Doppler and color-flow mapping have facilitated the dynamic study of blood flow in the cardiovascular system. Fetal echocardiography has now become a sophisticated modality, but is a crucial one to master because most fetuses that have congenital heart defects are not necessarily at any high risk. Evaluation of the fetal heart, therefore, is a recommended part of the routine fetal structural survey.\r"

Pancreatic necrosis was defined as lack of enhancement of all or a portion of the gland. Length of hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality in patients with early or late necrosis (22 patients) were evaluated and compared with the same criteria in the rest of the group. Patients with necrosis had a 23% mortality and an 82% complication rate; patients without necrosis had 0% mortality and 6% morbidity. When only the initial assessment was considered, patients with peripancreatic phlegmons and necrosis had 80% morbidity, compared with 36% morbidity in those with phlegmons and no necrosis. Serious complications occurred in patients who initially had or developed more than 30% necrosis. A CT severity index, based on a combination of peripancreatic inflammation, phlegmon, and degree of pancreatic necrosis as seen at initial CT study, was developed. Patients with a high CT severity index had 92% morbidity and 17% mortality; patients with a low CT severity index had 2% morbidity, and none died.\r"

The largest stone surgically removed from each patient was subjected to in vitro CT and chemical analysis. The authors found an inverse relationship between CT attenuation numbers and cholesterol content and a good positive correlation between CT attenuation numbers and calcium content. In vivo CT analysis improved sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive and negative predictive values compared to plain abdominal radiography and OCG in detection of cholesterol stones. Using their prediction rule (a CT number smaller than 140 HU indicates a pure cholesterol gallstone), the authors correctly classified gallstones in 17 (84%) of another 20 patients. In vivo CT analysis can enable reliable prediction of gallstone composition and should play an important role in the selection of patients for nonsurgical treatment.\r"

First, 10 pigs (three with implanted gallstones) underwent BESWL at different, increasing shock wave pressures. Histologic studies were done in seven animals and showed no macroscopic abnormalities. Microscopically, two pigs had 1-3-mm blood collections in the shock wave path. Next, 11 patients in whom subcostal BESWL was not feasible underwent intercostal BESWL. One patient complained of contact-site tenderness after BESWL, which resolved spontaneously. Transient elevations of aspartate aminotransferase occurred in two asymptomatic patients. Finally, both pathways were evaluated in 22 consecutive patients. Intercostal BESWL was the method of choice in only two patients. In each stage of the study all intercostally targeted gallstones fragmented. It is concluded that the intercostal pathway is a valid alternative whenever subcostal BESWL proves unsatisfactory.\r"

Fifty-five percent of the patients had a single left hepatic duct that was formed by the intrahepatic union of ducts draining segments II and III (segmental nomenclature follows Couinaud) lateral to the falciform ligament. Central to this ligament, the left duct became extrahepatic and was joined by ducts from segments I and IV. The real and theoretical implications of the unpredictable variability of biliary anatomy, the frequency of right lateral duct drainage into the left hepatic duct, and the extrahepatic contiguous relationship between the left hepatic duct and the left portal vein are discussed.\r"

Because of the intense and preferential T2 relaxativity of DM, use of DM with an iron concentration of 10 mumol/kg yielded effective MR signal reduction in each normal liver at 1 hour after the injection. Because no significant signal change in the tumors was observed on DM-enhanced MR images, the contrast between hepatocellular carcinoma and adjacent uninvolved liver increased remarkably on even relatively T1-weighted images. The detection rate for the 89 tumors, including small tumors less than 2 mm in diameter, increased from 10% (nine of 89) before DM administration to 65% (58 of 89) with DM-enhanced T1-weighted imaging. Iron staining of rat liver performed about 1 hour after DM administration showed sparse deposits of DM selectively in reticuloendothelial cells but not in liver tumors.\r"

In the present study, imaging was performed in the distribution phase, during the first 12 minutes after injection while contrast agent remain in circulation, and these images were compared with those obtained in the retention phase. Nineteen patients with cancer were studied, including 15 imaged during the distribution phase. T2-weighted distribution phase images demonstrated 90% of the lesions detected by means of T2-weighted retention phase images, showed a 3.5-fold increase in contrast-to-noise ratio over images obtained before administration of AMI-25, and increased diagnostic confidence by reducing signal from small intrahepatic blood vessels. Distribution phase images showed little contrast agent uptake by cancer tissue. Both distribution and retention phase images demonstrated greater contrast agent uptake by hemangiomas than by malignant neoplasms (P less than .01). The use of both distribution phase and retention phase AMI-25-enhanced images offers improved diagnostic accuracy in the detection and characterization of focal liver lesions.\r"

During a 27-month period at the author's institution, seven reactions to contrast material occurred during 6,918 colon examinations, and four reactions to contrast material occurred during 11,534 upper GI procedures. This frequency is greater than what has been reported previously. Most reactions were fairly mild, with urticaria and pruritis, although two patients, both with a history of asthma, had severe reactions that required emergency treatment. One patient had similar adverse reactions during both upper and lower GI examinations. Since only two patients received glucagon, this is not believed to be a factor. It is likely that patients react to some additive in the barium suspension. The radiologist must be aware of these complications and be ready to begin appropriate treatment.\r"

A well-defined subset of 20 patients were evaluated to better define the treatment effect of fallopian tube recanalization. All 20 had bilateral proximal tubal obstruction without other tubal disease, and all had been recommended for tubal microsurgery or in vitro fertilization. Recanalization of one or both tubes was successful in 19 of these women (95%). Nine patients conceived (47%) without receiving any other therapy, and the average time from procedure to conception was 4 months. All pregnancies were intrauterine. Eight of the 10 patients who did not conceive underwent follow-up hysterosalpingography an average of 6 months following the procedure; four (50%) demonstrated reocclusion of both tubes.

A gradual change in urine signal intensity with progressive addition of Gd-DTPA does not occur; instead, three sharply defined \"layers\" are seen both on T1- and T2-weighted images within the urine-Gd-DTPA mixture. The physical basis for this triple-layering phenomenon was investigated. A bladder phantom was constructed to reproduce the phenomenon. T1 and T2 relaxivities of urine doped with varying concentrations of Gd-DTPA were measured in vitro; measured signal intensities corresponded closely to predicted intensities. Early urine concentrations of excreted Gd-DTPA may be relatively high (10-40 mmol/L), resulting in extremely short T1 and T2 values (less than 30 msec). These extremely short relaxation times cause an artifactual pseudolayering of signal within the urine-Gd-DTPA mixture.\r"

Twenty-seven patients (25%) had acquired vascular lesions. Temporal bone tumors were found in 33 patients (31%). No abnormality was identified in 21 cases (20%). To ensure optimal radiologic examination, it is imperative to know the nature of the tinnitus (objective vs subjective) and the appearance of the tympanic membrane. All patients with subjective pulsatile tinnitus or a vascular retrotympanic mass should undergo high-resolution computed tomography of the temporal bone as the initial imaging study. Angiography is recommended for patients with objective tinnitus and a normal tympanic membrane. The role of MR imaging, even with the addition of gradient-echo techniques, remains limited and secondary.\r"

The most important finding was that the metabolite concentrations detectable with MR spectroscopy in brain tumors were reduced from 20% to 70%. Phosphomonoesters, phosphodiesters, and phosphocreatine (PCr) showed the greatest decreases, while inorganic phosphate (Pi) showed the least change. The PCr-Pi ratio was significantly reduced in tumors. The pH of brain tumors (7.12 +/- 0.03) was more alkaline than that of normal brain (6.99 +/- 0.01). The authors conclude that the metabolite concentrations and pH in human brain tumors differ significantly from those in normal brain. These differences may be ultimately useful in characterizing tumors in man.\r"

The MR characteristics evaluated were crossing of the midline, edema, tumor signal heterogeneity, hemorrhage, border definition, cyst formation or necrosis, and mass effect. The statistically significant MR characteristics (positive predictors) were mass effect (P = .0000) and cyst formation or necrosis (P = .0512). The MR accuracy rate approached that of neuropathologic diagnosis, which is subject to sampling errors.

Patients were also studied during either normal respiration or a Valsalva maneuver. The deep venous valvular system was incompetent more often than the superficial (saphenous) venous system. Positive venograms revealed that reflux occurred into the deep venous system alone in 82%, the superficial venous system alone in only 2%, and a combination of deep and superficial systems in 16%. The authors conclude that descending venography is best performed at the more physiologic 60 degrees semierect position and with the Valsalva maneuver, which enables evaluation of the competence of valves in the closed position.\r"

A hybrid probe was developed that allows a small percentage of laser light to emerge, converting the rest to heat. The probe was used to recanalize 37 peripheral arterial occlusions (10 in the iliac segment, 2-7 cm long, and 27 in the femoropopliteal segment, 1-35 cm long) in 37 patients. Primary success was defined as successful recanalization and continued patency during the first 24 hours, as assessed at physical examination. Primary success in the iliac segments was 70% and in the femoropopliteal segments was 85% (overall, 81%). The only complication was an arterial wall perforation, which had no sequelae. The probe is safe for use in peripheral arterial occlusions. There was no increase in the rate of perforation compared with the rate with the \"hot-tip\" laser probe, and the technique may have advantages over use of the original \"hot-tip\" laser probe.\r"

The contrast media used were iohexol, iopamidol, ioxaglate, and diatrizoate. Without the use of heparin, after a 30-minute incubation, blood clots were harvested from all catheter-syringe systems except those with diatrizoate and from all catheter-steerable wire systems. Significantly more blood clot was harvested from the catheter-steerable wire system. With use of heparinized blood, no clot was found in any system. Twelve dogs that underwent coronary angiography were divided into two groups; one received heparin (5,000 IU) and the other did not. Thromboembolism occurred in all nonheparinized dogs that underwent angiography with iohexol or iopamidol but not in any other group. The authors found that in a dog model nonionic contrast media are more thrombogenic than ionic contrast media, especially in the catheter-steerable wire system. The blood clot in the catheters is associated with thromboembolism during angiography. The authors maintain that in this setting, blood clotting and thromboembolism with nonionic agents can be eliminated with heparin.\r"

Review of the literature revealed no reported cases of NEC in which air in Morison pouch was mentioned. The authors' observation of six patients suggests that air in Morison pouch may be more common than previously recognized. Air in Morison pouch has the same significance as more obvious signs of pneumoperitoneum, and its detection is an indication for surgery.\r"

Twelve (24%) of the women developed increased parenchymal density during a median follow-up of 18 months (range, 6-39 months). Mammographic changes included diffuse increase in density in seven (14%) of the women; increased multifocal, asymmetric densities in two (4%); and cyst formation in three (6%). A greater percentage of women who received estrogen-progesterone replacement (26%, 10 of 38) demonstrated changes than those who received estrogen alone (17%, two of 12), but the difference was not statistically significant. The authors conclude that benign increases in mammographic density associated with postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy are not uncommon, and they suggest that the serial changes observed in some women may diminish the sensitivity of mammography for the earlier detection of breast cancer.\r"

Twenty-six patients had 34 benign posttraumatic compression fractures. Twenty-seven patients had metastatic disease to the vertebral column and seven pathologic fractures. T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo (SE) sequences (1.5 T) were performed in all patients. A presaturation technique was used to obtain \"fat\" and \"water\" images to better assess the degree of normal fatty marrow replacement in fractured vertebrae. Short inversion-time inversion-recovery (STIR) images were also obtained. Discrimination between benign and pathologic compression fractures was generally possible with the SE sequences. Chronic benign fractures demonstrated isointense marrow signal intensity (SI), compared with that of normal vertebrae with all sequences. Pathologic fractures showed low SI on T1-weighted images and high SI on T2-weighted images. Fat images revealed complete replacement of normal fatty marrow, shown as absent SI in the involved vertebral body. Water and STIR images showed diffuse high SI in pathologic fractures, with STIR images having the highest contrast between abnormal and normal marrow. Acute benign compression fractures also demonstrated high SI on T2-weighted, water, and STIR images, but the SI was less pronounced and the pattern was generally more inhomogeneous than that of pathologic compressions. In general, fat images showed only partial replacement of normal fatty marrow by low SI, in contrast to the complete absence of marrow SI typical of pathologic fractures.\r"

Twelve percent of new bone scan lesions correlated with radiographic abnormalities considered either suggestive of or consistent with metastasis, of which 24% and 71%, respectively, proved to be metastases. In cancer patients with one or two new bone scan abnormalities, correlative radiographs showing a benign abnormality are reliable. However, if the radiographs are either normal or show findings considered suggestive of or consistent with metastasis, further evaluation or follow-up is warranted.\r"

The morbidities seen in our study include leg deformities resulting from misalignment of bone segments and excessive stretching of soft tissues, and fractures, nonunions, and delayed unions at the lengthened sites, leading to prolonged application of traction devices. The overall frequency of morbidity was 148.8%.

To determine the cause of signal loss in this band, the authors measured the signal that arises from imaging such a region with use of an RF spin-echo technique with a 180 degrees pulse incrementally displaced from TE/2. The incremental loss of signal was small. Using an agar phantom containing iron particles, the authors also showed that signal loss results primarily from diffusion in magnetic gradients. They conclude that most signal loss in the dark band surrounding areas of late-stage hemorrhage arises from diffusion in areas of magnetic inhomogeneity.\r"

The choice of academic radiology was associated with receiving medical school education or radiology training at an institution ranking among the 20 with the most federal grant funding, publishing research articles, and participating in a variety of interpersonal research experiences during radiology training. Academic radiologists were more likely to choose their careers because of their interests, aptitudes, and greater concern for the value of doing research. Private practitioners rated family obligations, leisure time, and level of personal income as more significant influences on their career choices. Programs interested in training more academic radiologists should reconsider how they select trainees and provide an appropriate research environment during training.\r"

Conceptual priming, however, seems to be based on the operations of semantic memory.\r"

These proteins spontaneously vary in size, contain highly repetitive structures, and are oriented with their carboxyl-terminal region external to the membrane. Thus, mycoplasma membrane lipoproteins generate microbial surface diversity and may be part of a complex system that controls interactions of these organisms with their hosts.\r"

The most common initial symptom was rectal bleeding, typically misdiagnosed as hemorrhoids. Seventeen patients had stage I cancer when first seen, four had stage II, and three had distant disease. Progressive disease most commonly started as a large pelvic mass, diffuse bilateral pulmonary nodules, or diffuse liver metastases. Twenty patients (83%) died of the disease; none survived more than 6 years. Among the patients who died of the disease, median survival was 1.9 years. Median survival for patients with stage I disease (29 months) was longer than that for patients with stage II disease (11 months; p less than 0.05) or stage III disease (9 months). Twelve patients were treated initially with abdominoperineal resection (APR), and three additional patients underwent APR to manage recurrent local or regional disease that developed later in the clinical course. Among evaluable patients with stage I disease initially managed with APR, 50% developed recurrent local-regional disease (mean disease-free interval, 23 months), compared with 100% of those who underwent more limited surgery (mean disease-free interval, 16 months). Even after APR, however, distant metastases were common, and there was no prolongation of survival for patients treated with APR. Primary melanoma of the anorectum has a high metastatic potential and carries a grave prognosis. APR appears to have some effect in controlling local and regional disease, but prolongation of survival will depend on both earlier diagnosis and development of more successful therapeutic approaches.\r"

A rare but potential serious complication is rupture of the vein patch during the early postoperative period. In our experience of 2359 carotid operations performed from 1962 through 1986, saphenous vein was used for closure in 2275 (96.5%) operations. In three patients out of 75 in whom the vein patch had been harvested from the ankle, rupture of the patch occurred 2 to 5 days after uneventful carotid surgery. At emergency reoperation, the central portion of the vein was necrotic, with no evidence of infection. In each case the carotid artery was closed again with fresh thigh saphenous vein, and recovery was uneventful. The use of ankle vein was discontinued in December 1983 in favor of groin saphenous vein, and similar complications have not occurred in more than 600 carotid endarterectomies performed since. Early noninfectious ruptures of the saphenous vein patches have been mentioned in other reported series of carotid operations and have often been related to the use of ankle vein, but they remain unexplained.\r"

The resultant potential for collateral LRV outflow through these tributaries in instances of LRV division is obvious. One of us has previously reported 10 such cases of LRV division (close to its confluence with the inferior vena cava and without reanastomosis) for the purpose of facilitating proximal abdominal aortic exposure for reconstructive procedures. One of the 10 patients had moderate renal insufficiency at follow-up. We present herein an additional 19 patients who underwent LRV division predominantly for aneurysmal disease of the abdominal aorta. Sixteen patients were available for follow-up. Three patients died in the intraoperative and early postoperative periods. Multivariate analysis of variance of preoperative, postoperative, and follow-up laboratory data--serum creatinine and BUN--showed no significant change in renal function as assessed.\r"

  ".W": "In 570 patients with sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism, the age, sex, symptoms, and preoperative serum calcium values were related to the histopathologic diagnoses, operative findings, and the extent and outcome of parathyroid surgery. Renal stone formation was especially prevalent in younger patients with slight hypercalcemia and parathyroid chief cell hyperplasia, whereas neuromuscular and psychiatric disturbances were overrepresented among older women with higher serum calcium values. Serum calcium concentration was inversely correlated to the proportional incidence of chief cell hyperplasia and positively correlated to the glandular weight of both adenomas and hyperplasias. Glandular size was markedly irregular in chief cell hyperplasia, with increased gland weights of no more than two glands in 78% of patients. During follow-up, for as long as 27 years, normocalcemia was obtained in 91% of patients with adenomas, with failures mainly depending on difficulties in identifying the parathyroid glands. The rate of normocalcemia was lower (80%) among patients with hyperplasia, but an inability to visualize the glands was not a major cause of failure. In patients with hyperplasia with asymmetric and more markedly enlarged glands, it appeared sufficient to remove only the enlarged glands, whereas the findings advocated a subtotal 3- to 3.5-gland resection in patients with more symmetrically or less enlarged hyperplastic glands.\r"

Staple line perforations occurred in 48% of patients, and 36% underwent reoperation. The instability of the operation becomes apparent only with careful follow-up. More than 50% of patients who maintained a small orifice of less than or equal to 11 mm in diameter and an intact staple line over 3 to 5 years achieved an excellent result (0% to 25% excess weight), which equals the best results in the literature for any gastric-limiting operation, whether bypass or gastroplasty. The results of this operation for super obesity (a body mass index greater than or equal to 50 kg/m2) are disappointing. Only 8% of these patients achieve an excellent result. Failure of vertical banded gastroplasty in the morbidly obese (body mass index of 40 to 50 kg/m2) is frequently technical, and a method that eliminates dependence on integrity of staples should be evaluated. Results should be reported so that unsatisfactory results are apparent. Mean weight loss and mean percent excess weight loss are both highly satisfactory in this study, whereas unsatisfactory results ranged from 10% to 21% for each of the 5 years of follow-up.\r"

One million cells of a clone 10-O were injected subcutaneously into normal C3H/HeJ mice (clone 10-N) or tumor-immune mice (clone 10-I). After 10 passages in immune mice, 1 X 10(6) cells from 10-I tumor were transferred back into normal mice (clone 10-R). After 5 to 10 additional in vivo passages, clone 10-O, 10-N, 10-I, and 10-R tumors were transplanted into normal mice and observed for tumor growth rate, tumorigenicity, antigen specificity, metastatic potential, and plating efficiency. Clone 10-I after 10 passages in immunized mice grew significantly more slowly than did 10-O or 10-N clones, required more tumor cells to cause 50% tumor incidence in normal mice (tumorigenicity), and completely lost its capacity to metastasize spontaneously or experimentally. The plating efficiency in vitro of 10-I was also less than that of 10-O or 10-N. All these changes reversed after 5 to 10 passages of 10-I clone back into normal mice (10-R). Although immune pressure induced qualitative antigenic changes, as demonstrated by a tumor-rejection assay, and resulted in no cross-reactivity with control tumor clones (antigen specificity), the degree of immune response to its autologous clone in immune mice (immunogenicity) remained constant. These results suggest that several unrelated characteristics of this clone 10 can be phenotypically changed during the same period by immune pressure.\r"

Mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) was significantly decreased, from 137.4 +/- 3.7 to 64.7 +/- 2.8 mm Hg, 1 hour after completion of brain death (p less than 0.01). In the control group AKBR was maintained at the near control value of 1.07 thereafter, concomitant with a significant decrease in serum lactate levels, despite marked hypotension (p less than 0.05). Dopamine infusion at rates of 5 and 10 micrograms/kg/min sustained both AKBR and MABP at near control values. In contrast, dopamine given at doses greater than 15 micrograms/kg/min caused a significant reduction of AKBR, to less than 0.66 +/- 0.12 (p less than 0.01), although MABP was restored to near-normal levels. In addition, serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase were significantly elevated, reflecting liver cell injury. It is suggested that the liver is primarily tolerant to hypotension in the state of brain death and that dopamine administered at a rate of 15 micrograms/kg/min or more impairs liver metabolism by reducing the redox state (free nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide/reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide) of liver mitochondria.\r"

The treated craniotomy sites were studied 3 and 6 months after surgery; radiodensity and volume of newly deposited trabecular bone were assessed by radiomorphometric and histomorphometric methods, respectively. There was no evidence of adverse immunologic response to the experimental implants. The autografts resulted in the greatest volume of new bone formation (p less than 0.01), but the AA implants elicited a significantly greater response than either the bovine bone morphogenetic protein derivatives or the controls (p less than 0.05). By 6 months, the AA derivatives had healed with actively coalescing islands of new bone, displaying normal-appearing outer and inner tables along with well-developed marrow cavities. It appears that xenogeneic AA implants have the ability to elicit an excellent osseous response in critical-size calvarial wounds. In addition, the carrier polymer for the implants acted as an effective soft-tissue spacer before being absorbed.\r"

The patients had a mean age of 48.2 years and underwent splenectomy and devascularization with (17 cases) or without cardiectomy (six cases). The initial portal venous blood flow in all 23 patients was 0.99 +/- 0.31 L/min/m2, and this decreased significantly after splenectomy to 0.67 +/- 0.29 L/min/m2 in proportion to the resected spleen weight. The initial portal venous pressure was 36.5 +/- 6.8 cm H2O, and this decreased after splenectomy to 29.1 +/- 5.7 cm H2O but returned to the initial level after the devascularization procedure. Thus the portal hypertensive status was preserved in spite of the reduction in portal venous blood flow. There was no difference in the pattern of portal hemodynamic change between the patients who underwent cardiectomy and those who did not. In conclusion, it is indicated that the portal hemodynamic change after the devascularization procedure was not caused by cardiectomy but by the lack of splenic blood flow to the portal vein after splenectomy.\r"

Three pairs of temporary bipolar serosal electrodes were placed on the duodenums of ten patients undergoing cholecystectomy. Electrical recordings were obtained daily until the patients' discharge, at 3 to 7 days, after operation. On each postoperative day, a regular rhythmic pattern of pacesetter potentials (PPs) was detected in all patients. The PP frequency (mean +/- SEM) was greater at the proximal electrode than at the distal electrode on the first postoperative day (12.3 +/- 0.1 cpm vs 11.9 +/- 0.1 cpm, p less than 0.01) and on the day of feeding (12.0 +/- 0.2 cpm vs 11.6 +/- 0.2, p less than 0.01). Spontaneous periods when spike potentials accompanied each PP (phase III of the migrating myoelectric complex), were found in only one patient on the day after operation, while they were recorded in five patients after 3 to 7 days, when postoperative ileus had resolved (p less than 0.05). Pacing with electric pulses (50 msec, 5 to 15 mA, 11 to 13 cpm) did not alter the pattern of duodenal PPs or entrain them in the duodenum of any patient at any time after operation. In conclusion, the pattern of duodenal pacesetter potentials changed little during the period of postoperative ileus, while the incidence of phase IIIs of the migrating myoelectric complex was greatly decreased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Animals were resuscitated to baseline filling pressures with lactated Ringer's solution and killed 10 hours after burn. Six sheep were pretreated with ibuprofen (12.5 mg/kg) and five with allopurinol (50 mg/kg). We used conjugated dienes and malondialdehyde as measures of lipid peroxidation. Circulating conjugated dienes increased from a baseline of 0.48 +/- 0.06 to 0.64 +/- 0.05 after burn, while protein-rich burn tissue lymph flow increased up to eightfold. We also noted a significant increase in lung tissue malondialdehyde from 45 +/- 4 to 60 +/- 6 nmol/gm and liver malondialdehyde from 110 +/- 20 to 271 +/- 34 nmol/gm along with increased tissue neutrophil sequestration. Ibuprofen attenuated lung-tissue malondialdehyde but had no effect on lung inflammation, circulating lipid peroxides or burn edema, indicating that ibuprofen most likely decreased O2 radical release in lung tissue by the already-sequestered neutrophils. Allopurinol, possibly via xanthine oxidase inhibition, markedly attenuated burn QL and circulating lipid peroxides and prevented all pulmonary lipid peroxidation and inflammation, indicating that release of oxidant from burn tissue was in part responsible for local burn edema, as well as distant inflammation and oxidant release, the latter most likely from complement activation. Neither antioxidant decreased lipid peroxidation in the liver; this indicates that its mechanism of production was different from that seen in burn tissue, in plasma, or in the lung. An ischemic event resulting from a selective decrease in splanchnic blood flow may be the cause of the liver changes.\r"

  ".W": "The risks of transfusion-associated infectious disease have led to a reassessment of transfusion practice, which in turn has resulted in a trend toward the reduction of homologous transfusion. This reduction is primarily due to the initiation of hemotherapy at more severe levels of anemia. The optimum threshold for the initiation of transfusion therapy, or the transfusion trigger (TT), is unknown. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of withholding transfusion or lowering the TT to a hematocrit (Hct) of 15 percent in unanesthetized animals. Nineteen adult baboons underwent a laparotomy to simulate surgical stress. Upon their recovery from anesthesia, hemodynamic measurements were obtained, and the animals underwent an exchange transfusion (ET) with 6-percent hetastarch to a final Hct of 15 percent. After ET, hemodynamic measurements were repeated, and the animals were followed for 2 months. There was no morbidity after ET or during the 2-month observation period. After ET, there was a significant increase in both the cardiac output (3.3 vs. 2.5 L/min, p less than 0.001) and the oxygen extraction ratio (59.9 vs. 38.2%, p less than 0.0001). Oxygen delivery fell after ET (18.9 vs. 11.1 cc/kg/min, p less than 0.001), but there was no significant change in oxygen consumption after ET. The unanesthetized animals adapted well to severe anemia and experienced no adverse effects on their long-term survival in this setting, which suggests that the reduction of the TT to a Hct of 15 percent in normal animals is safe. Adoption of this TT could result in a significant reduction in the requirements for homologous transfusion with its attendant risks.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate whether changes in platelet condition during platelet storage correlate with an altered expression of platelet membrane proteins, the binding of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) to fresh platelets was compared with MoAbs' binding to thrombin-activated platelets and to platelets stored as platelet concentrates. The MoAbs included antibodies against the platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa complex and against two activation-dependent antigens, one of which was a component of the internal platelet alpha-granule membrane (GMP 140) and the other of which was a 53-kD protein derived from platelet lysosomes. The binding of MoAbs to platelets fixed with 1 percent paraformaldehyde was measured by flow cytometry. In thrombin-activated platelets, a threefold increase was found in the expression of GP IIb/IIIa over that in fresh platelets. The binding of the activation-dependent MoAbs increased from 2 to 3 percent to 70 to 80 percent of the platelets. Storage of platelet concentrates for 5 days resulted in a 60 percent increase in GP IIb/IIIa expression compared to Day 0 and increased binding of the MoAbs directed against GMP-140 from 3 to 16 percent and against the 53-kD protein from 2 to 8 percent of the platelets, respectively. These changes correlated with modifications in platelet morphology (decrease in swirling), leakage of lactate dehydrogenase, and release of beta-thromboglobulin. These data indicate that platelets become activated and are damaged during the storage of platelet concentrates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All of these methods have disadvantages that restrict their practical use: they are time-consuming, they require the facilities of a blood bank, and the white cell-poor units cannot be stored. Therefore tests have been performed on two filter systems that make possible the depletion of white cells directly at the bedside. Both filters have a high white cell-removal rate. The number of residual white cells in 1 unit of packed red cells was calculated as 1.08 +/- 0.53 x 10(7) in one system and 1.54 +/- 0.71 x 10(7) in the other. The filters do not affect the filtered red cells. Pressure filtration is performed without significant loss of efficiency. One of the systems can filter 2 units via one filter; however, handling the filters is tedious, and both filters are characterized by a low red cell recovery. Despite these disadvantages, the tested filter systems provide an effective device for preparing white cell-poor blood at the bedside. They are a suitable alternative to the conventional methods.\r"

Median RBC recovery was at least 92 percent when 2 units were administered through one filter; median values for residual white cells and platelets were less than or equal to 20 x 10(6) and less than or equal to 2.5 x 10(9) per 2 units, respectively. The in vivo study was carried out in 80 multiply transfused patients with thalassemia, 35 of whom had experienced frequent nonhemolytic transfusion reactions when given standard or buffy coat-free RBCs. During the 6-month study, each patient was given two transfusions of each type of RBC product One febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reaction occurred in each of two patients receiving SAGM-BC units, but in no other case. If the flow rate is not reduced, the median transfusion time is 35 minutes per CPDA unit and 15 minutes per SAGM and SAGM-BC unit. It is concluded that the transfusion of RBCs through the RC100 is a simple and effective procedure to administer white cell-depleted RBCs prepared at the bedside.\r"

  ".W": "HLA alloimmunization is a major problem for thrombocytopenic patients receiving long-term platelet support. It is caused by white cells (WBCs) that are present as contaminants in platelet concentrates (PCs). Recent data have shown that filtration is an effective means to reduce WBC contamination, but it has little effect on the recovery of platelets. The present report evaluates two filters, a cellulose acetate (CA) filter requiring the inactivation of platelets with prostacyclin and a cotton wool (CW) filter requiring no platelet inactivation. The results show that, using fresh pooled PCs from six random donors, both filters reduce WBC contamination below 10(7) per PC, the likely threshold below which alloimmunization does not develop. With platelets stored for 2 to 3 days the efficacy of the CW filter decreases. Neither filter inflicts important damage to the platelets, as there is no considerable platelet activation or cell disruption. Moreover, PCs prepared by both filters show normal survival and effectively reduce the bleeding times. Thus, filtration of PCs results in platelets with optimal responsiveness both in vitro and in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "The American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) requires that blood samples used for pretransfusion testing of recently transfused (or pregnant) patients must be obtained within 3 days of scheduled transfusions. This requirement, which became effective in July 1988, amended Standard G2.000 of the AABB, which previously required that pretransfusion testing must be done on blood samples obtained within 2 days of scheduled transfusions. The present study was designed to estimate the risk associated with adopting the amended version of Standard G2.000. Sixty patients who developed significant unexpected alloantibodies after transfusion were studied retrospectively. Thirteen of the 60 patients were found to have newly detectable antibodies within 83 hours of a sample reported to be negative for the new antibody. Had the amended version of Standard G2.000 been in effect, the detection of some of these antibodies might have been delayed up to 24 hours. It was estimated that the implementation of the new AABB requirement at the authors' institution could potentially place about 1 in 3000 transfused patients at risk for an acute or delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction.\r"

Reported here is a case that suggests that the patient's preexisting condition may play an important role in determining whether TRALI develops upon transfusion of blood products containing anti-white cell (WBC) antibodies. A 29-year-old woman with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) underwent an uneventful 1.5-volume plasma exchange, which was followed by the transfusion of 2 red cell (RBC) units. At the end of the second RBC transfusion, the patient developed clinical signs and symptoms of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Serologic studies demonstrated that the serum from the second RBC donor had no HLA antibodies but did have a granulocyte-specific antibody (anti-NB2) that caused the agglutination of the recipient's granulocytes, which were NB2 positive. Serum from the donor of the first RBC unit and serum from the donors of units used in the exchange had no HLA or granulocyte-specific antibodies that reacted with the recipient's WBCs. Because the donor implicated in this reaction had a history of 21 blood donations, none of which had been associated with a transfusion reaction, we suggest that the patient's preexisting condition played a significant role in this episode of TRALI, owing to the granulocyte-specific antibody.\r"

Although this antibody was weak, it was capable of in vivo destruction of Jk(a+b-) and Jk(a-b+) red cells. A lack of details about the patient's clinical condition precludes speculation as to the cause of suppression of Jka expression. The phenomenon appeared to affect only the Kidd blood group system. This case should alert others that antigen loss can occur in the Kidd system as it has been shown to occur in, at least, the Rh, Kell, and Ge systems.\r"

A new blood warmer, using a closed-flow 40 degrees C counter-current water bath and large-bore tubing, is able to warm cold (10 degrees C) packed red cells to temperatures greater than 35 degrees C even at flow rates of 500 mL per minute. To evaluate the effects on red cells of prolonged exposure to the 40 degrees C heat exchanger, blood from five volunteers stored for 42 days in AS-1 was run through the blood warmer using flow rates equivalent to the transfusion of a unit of blood over 4 hours. Compared with unwarmed blood, these blood units showed no significant changes in plasma hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, potassium, ATP, pH, and osmotic fragility. In vivo survivals of chromium-51-labeled warmed autologous red cells were greater than 75 percent in four volunteers and 49.5 percent in the fifth volunteer, whose abnormally low unwarmed red cell ATP level suggested a storage problem. Thus, this blood warmer, which warms blood efficiently at high flow rates, causes no red cell damage, even with prolonged exposure of old red cells to the 40 degrees C heat exchanger.\r"

The dialysis patients at HUH are much younger when compared to the national and regional data, especially when the three major causes of ESRD--hypertension, diabetes, and glomerulonephritis--are considered. This study demonstrates that black patients develop ESRD at a much younger age. Since both diabetes and hypertension are treatable, there is a need for more aggressive therapy of these conditions to prevent this premature onset of ESRD in blacks. Fifteen percent of patients with ESRD secondary to glomerular disease have an associated history of i.v. drug abuse, which could be responsible for the disease. The glomerular disease may not be treatable but may be preventable. However, this requires combined educational, social, and economic effort. Programs designed to control these three major causes of ESRD may be much less costly than supporting the current treatment modalities of ESRD.\r"

  ".W": "Diabetic renal disease is a major source of morbidity and mortality in Pima Indians. Excess mortality in NIDDM occurs principally in those with proteinuria regardless of whether death is due to cardiovascular or renal disease. Diabetes duration is a strong predictor of diabetic renal disease. Additional predictors include blood pressure, severity of diabetes, and, most likely, genetic or shared environmental determinants. The incidence rate of diabetic renal disease in Pima Indians with NIDDM is similar to that reported for subjects with IDDM with equivalent durations of diabetes. These observations suggest that clinical proteinuria and renal failure may occur in patients with NIDDM just as frequently as in those with IDDM. This finding has important implications and suggests that the variations in the frequency and age of onset of NIDDM among different populations and ethnic groups may be primarily responsible for the apparent variations in the frequency of ESRD associated with diabetes in different populations. Furthermore, diabetic renal disease appears to account for virtually all of the excess mortality associated with diabetes among Pima Indians and may perhaps do so in other populations. Improved survival of persons with NIDDM, an increasing incidence of this disease, and a relatively early age of onset in many populations could lead to a dramatic increase in the incidence of ESRD in the future. On the other hand, if diabetic renal disease and its consequences could be prevented, a profound improvement in the longevity and quality of life of those afflicted with diabetes might be possible.\r"

The apparent underrepresentation of Hispanics in regard to their expected incidence of ESRD is unexplained but may be reflected by socioeconomic and language considerations. The outcomes in all groups appear very good following cadaveric transplantation, although there is a trend toward a slight impairment in graft survival among black recipients. In a small series of HLA-identical black recipients of HLA-identical donor grafts, there is no evidence of impaired graft survival. This article did not address the rather small participation of minority groups in organ donation, but the large minority population of blacks, Hispanics, and Asians contributes only 12% of the organs donated in our region.\r"

The male to female ratio was 5:1; 87 percent of the patients were aged thirty to sixty years and 11 patients were under age fourteen. There was no clear relation of stone formation to occupation. Sixty-nine percent of calculi were renal, 29 percent ureteric, and only 3 percent were bladder calculi. Two hundred seventy-eight operative procedures were done (36.5% of all patients), including pyelolithotomy, nephrolithotomy, ureterolithotomy, ESWL, cystolithotomy, and extractions by basket. Infection was a rarity (6%) and urinary schistosomiasis was found in 33 patients (4.3%), 24 of whom were from a schistosoma-infested region. Raised serum calcium was found in only 5.7 percent and raised serum urate in 13 percent. Increased urinary excretion of urate was found in 60 percent and hypercalciuria in 9 percent.

Arterial aspects of impotence have received considerable attention, but just recently the venous component became widely recognized. Twenty patients with abnormal cavernosometry (flow rate over 280 mL/min) and no rigid erections (intracavernosal pressure lower than 80 mm Hg) were analyzed. Surgical ligation of the dorsal veins was performed in 12 cases, 9 of which also required ligation of the crus of each corpus cavernosum. After these ligations, erection improved sufficiently to allow satisfactory intercourse in 9 of 12 patients. Two patients became impotent after eight months of normal sexual performance. The 3 failures showed persistently high flow rates and one leakage by the crural edge which had not been ligated at surgery. In selected patients with organic impotence the venous abnormalities should be assessed routinely and dorsal veins and the crural edge of the corpus cavernosum should be ligated in an attempt to restore erectile function.\r"

Seventy-six percent of patients had kidney stones completely eliminated or residual no greater than 3 mL. Fourteen percent of patients had residual fragments which may require second treatment. Five stones showed no improvement, and 2 stones could not be imaged. Only 2 patients required anesthesia. One patient required hospitalization prior to treatment. The rest were treated as outpatients. This preliminary FDA-investigative study limited our protocol to stones of 0.5 cm to 2.5 cm within the kidney or proximal ureter. Since particles passed were so small, \"steinstrasse phenomenon\" (distal ureteral obstruction by stone fragments) was not encountered and routine stent placement was obviated. There were no major complications.\r"

Infected tumors were found in 18 percent of males and 75 percent of females. A wide range of bacteria, including anaerobes, was isolated; when streptococci or coliforms were cultured from the tumor, they were always found in significant numbers in the preoperative urine specimen. Perioperative bacteremia and postoperative complications requiring parenteral antibiotics were more common in females and in patients with significant preoperative bacteriuria. No correlation was found between tumor infection and histologic grade or stage of tumor. Patients with sterile preoperative urine and positive bacterial cultures from tumors were no more likely to have postoperative urinary tract infections than those with negative tumor cultures.\r"

Consequently we performed a nephroureterectomy with excision of a cuff of bladder and the nephrostomy tract. Residual tumor was found in deep layer of the renal pelvis. The implication from this case in defining the indications for endourologic management of tumors is considered.\r"

A total of 4,024 x-rays was obtained from 71,192 patient visits--an x-ray utilization rate of 5.65 percent. Most office x-rays were of the chest (39.6 percent), upper extremities (21.3 percent) or lower extremities (21.0 percent). These three categories predominated for all age groups of both sexes, for all months of the year, and for all clinics studied. Males utilized x-rays much more frequently than did females (8.86 percent overall rate for males; 3.95 percent overall rate for females) at all ages except for the age group 0-10 (2.19 percent for males, 3.04 percent for females). The gender combined age group with the highest utilization rate was between 51-60 (8.39 percent) whereas the gender combined age group 0-10 had the lowest utilization rate (2.61 percent). Uniformity was demonstrated from clinic to clinic on type of x-rays obtained, frequency of x-rays by gender, and frequency of x-rays per month. A major difference, however, was noted in utilization rates between clinics. There was a two-fold difference in x-ray utilization between the clinic with the highest utilization rate and the one with the lowest. This data is useful for focusing the content of residency training and continuing medical education in radiology, for providing a content base to evaluate family physicians in radiology, and for providing a foundation upon which further investigations into office radiology can be constructed.\r"

The study group consisted of all women having mammography for eight consecutive months at a new mammography screening clinic. The clinic had specifically been established for self-referral. Women from both groups when compared to the general population in the surrounding area tended to be in a higher educational/socioeconomic level. Women in the regular fee group reported physician influence as being most important in their decision to have mammography while women in the reduced fee group reported the reduced fee of mammography itself as the most important factor. Books and magazines were the second most important factor for both the regular and reduced fee group with regard to their decision to have mammography.\r"

A faculty member at each program noted on the test report whether or not each of 109 residents had children at the time of the exam. Overall, residents with children had slightly higher scores than those without children on the pediatric portion of the in-training examination. The exception was the PGY1 group where residents with children scored markedly lower than those residents without children. However, none of these differences were statistically significant. Although these results do not refute the possibility of special insight possessed by physicians who are also parents, these physicians do not appear to have any particular advantage on written tests over residents without children.\r"

Negative responses were associated with casual items such as sandals, clogs, athletic shoes, scrub suits, and blue jeans. Cronbach's alpha analysis identified four cohesive appearance scales: traditional male appearance, casual male appearance, traditional female appearance, and casual female appearance. Older physician participants favored a more traditional appearance than did younger physicians, and of the physicians who were 35 years and younger, staff physicians tended to show more conservative views toward professional appearance than did residents.\r"

Multiple regression analysis was used in exploring the effects of self-esteem, and the control variables age, gender, employment and marital status on health status, as assessed from the patient's chart, and on number of symptoms, as assessed through patient self-report. The regression on health status was significant overall (F = 4.12, p less than .001) with each of the predictors yielding significant coefficients. Those with high self-esteem, younger people, men, and employed people had significantly higher health status scores as assessed from the patient's chart. The regression on number of symptoms was marginally significant overall (F = 2.28, p less than .06) with self-esteem emerging as a significant predictor (p less than .05). Those with high self-esteem had significantly fewer symptoms as reported on the Hopkins Symptom Check List. These results support the existence of a positive relationship between self-esteem and physical health in a family practice patient population.\r"

The single balloon technique was used in 73 patients and the double balloon technique was used in 21. The two groups were similar in age, weight, severity of the lesion, and cardiac functional status. The mean mitral valve diastolic gradient decreased from 17.9 +/- 6.5 to 2.9 +/- 3.1 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), 18.5 +/- 6.7 to 5.8 +/- 3.1 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), and 18.1 +/- 5.9 to 3.2 +/- 3.7 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) in the single balloon group, double balloon group, and the entire series, respectively. The final mitral diastolic gradient in the single balloon group was lower than in the double balloon group (p less than 0.05). Complications in the single balloon group were lower than in the double balloon group. Additional advantages of single over double balloon technique were easier maneuverability and higher success rate. The initial and long-term follow-up results confirmed the earlier impressions that percutaneous transseptal balloon mitral valvuloplasty is an effective and safe nonsurgical method of treatment for rheumatic mitral stenosis, and the single rubber-nylon balloon technique is at least as effective as, if not superior to, the double polyethylene balloon technique.\r"

  ".W": "During thoracotomy 12 anesthetized swine were instrumented and valvuloplasty catheters were positioned at the aortic anulus. Thirty-second occlusions of the left ventricular outflow tract were performed with a single catheter (n = 34) and with simultaneous inflation of dual catheters (n = 47). Left anterior descending coronary artery blood flow fell to minimums of 15% of baseline flow (SD 13.9%) during single balloon occlusion and to 63.8% of baseline flow (SD 22.8%) during dual balloon occlusion. Main pulmonary artery flow fell to minimums of 13.6% of baseline flow (SD 17.3%) during single balloon occlusion and to 66.9% of baseline flow (SD 18.3%) during dual balloon occlusion. Femoral artery systolic pressure dropped to 20.1% of baseline pressure (SD 5.6%) during single balloon occlusion and to 82.6% of baseline pressure (SD 8.1%) during dual balloon occlusion. During single balloon occlusion, 8.5 (SD 3.5) premature ventricular contractions were observed and 2.8 (SD 1.6) premature ventricular contractions occurred during dual balloon occlusion. After deflation of the valvuloplasty catheters, the time to return of baseline flow in the left anterior descending coronary artery was 28.4 second (SD 23.2 seconds) with the single balloon method and 4.8 seconds (SD 3.7 seconds) with the dual balloon method. All of these differences were statistically significant (p less than .001). During occlusion of the left ventricular outflow tract by dual valvuloplasty catheters, there were better hemodynamics, higher coronary blood flows, and fewer premature ventricular contractions than during occlusion by a single catheter. After occlusion by dual catheters, returns to baseline coronary flows were more rapid than after single catheter occlusions. These data may have application to clinical aortic valvuloplasty.\r"

  ".W": "The BT as a test of hemostatic function was first described 80 years ago. It has generally been considered a primitive and tedious test. Improvements in technique and standardization have increased the BT's reliability and led to its consideration as a preoperative screening measure. Current use has not been widespread, however, except for patients undergoing neurosurgery and organ biopsy. Recently, though, there has been a renewed interest in the BT for patients receiving thrombolytic therapy because levels of fibrinogen and fibrin(ogen) degradation products have been only weak predictors of hemorrhagic complications. The rationale for using the BT in this setting is that thrombolysis appears to impair platelet function, either through depletion of platelet granules or through direct proteolytic actions on platelets. Further research will determine whether these platelet effects are manifest as BT prolongation; whether increased BT will correlate with hemorrhagic complications; and, finally, whether patients who fail to achieve clot lysis or those at risk for bleeding can be identified prospectively.\r"
