  ".W": "Procollagen III aminopeptide (P-III-P), a peptide released during the conversion of type III procollagen to type III collagen, is considered a potential marker of fibroblast activity in a variety of pulmonary and extrapulmonary diseases. The aim of the present article was to investigate the levels of P-III-P in serum samples (sP-III-P) from a large number of sarcoid patients, in particular looking at its relationship with other markers of disease activity and its presumed role as a marker of pulmonary fibrosis. sP-III-P has been radioimmunoassayed in an overall series of 57 patients and the levels were higher (19.18 +/- 9.17 ng/ml) than in 25 age- and sex-matched controls (11.32 +/- 2.15 ng/ml; p less than 0.001). The elevation was neither sex-related nor related to obvious liver sarcoid localization. Although sP-III-P levels were slightly higher in patients with stage II, there was no significant difference in patients with stage I or III. We found a positive relationship with serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (S-ACE) levels (p less than 0.04), but not with other markers of disease activity (67Ga uptake, bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL] lymphocyte percent, vital capacity, and lung diffusing capacity). The relationship with S-ACE was confirmed in a longitudinal follow-up study, where sP-III-P strictly paralleled the S-ACE behavior. Finally, the initial sP-III-P levels did not predict cases either with disease relapse or resistance to corticosteroid treatment. We conclude that, in our study, sP-III-P levels failed to characterize sarcoid patients with radiologic fibrotic pattern (stage III), and, in addition, were unable to predict which patients would have a poor prognosis. Rather, they reflect a metabolic activity of sarcoid granuloma cells. Thus, the usefulness of sP-III-P in the treatment of patients with sarcoid may be considered similar to that of S-ACE.\r"

  ".W": "Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the primary therapy for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Recent reports have indicated, however, that there is a small but significant number of failures related to patient compliance. Primary surgical treatment, which has been uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP), has declined because of poor results. A reviewed of UPPP failures has shown that while UPPP eliminated palatal obstruction, it failed to eliminate base of tongue obstruction. Maxillofacial surgery has been reported as treatment of OSAS by correcting base of tongue obstruction. Thirty patients with severe OSAS were evaluated to compare nasal CPAP and maxillofacial surgery. The goal was to determine if our surgical protocol was as effective as nasal CPAP. All patients initially underwent baseline diagnostic polysomnography to document OSAS. A nasal CPAP study was performed to determine the appropriate positive end-expiratory pressure. The patients in this study were using nasal CPAP, but they found it unacceptable as long-term treatment and elected surgery. Maxillofacial surgery consisted of maxillary, mandibular, and hyoid advancement. Polysomnography was performed six months following surgery and compared with the night 2 CPAP results. The parameters included in the investigation were the respiratory disturbance index (RDI), lowest SaO2, number of SaO2 falls below 90 percent, total sleep time (TST), REM sleep percent, stage 3-4 sleep percent, and wake after sleep onset. The mean RDI before treatment was 72.0 (SD 25.7). After completing therapy, the RDI from surgery and CPAP was 8.8 (SD 6.0) and 8.6 (SD 4.1), respectively. The mean low SaO2 prior to treatment was 61.0 (SD 13.5), and the CPAP results and postsurgical results were 86.2 (SD 5.5) and 86.1 (SD 4.2), respectively. An analysis of variance was used to examine the results, and there was no statistical difference between nasal CPAP and surgery for all respiratory variables.\r"

In 24 patients, the methacholine challenge suggested that they had asthma (forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV1] decrease greater than or equal to 20 percent). Six of these 24 patients also had a decrease in maximal forced inspiratory flow (FIFmax) greater than or equal to 20 percent and nine had a decrease in forced inspiratory flow at 50 percent of vital capacity (FIF50) greater than or equal to 20 percent, suggesting that bronchoconstriction can cause decreased inspiratory as well as expiratory flows. In 76 patients, the methacholine challenges were \"negative\" (FEV1 decrease less than or equal to 20 percent), suggesting that they did not have asthma. Nevertheless, in 11 of these 76 patients the FIFmax decrease was greater than or equal to 20 percent, and in 14 patients the FIF50 decrease was greater than or equal to 20 percent, suggesting that intermittent central airway obstruction is responsible for these patients' symptoms.\r"

Our hypotheses were that these new postoperative defects occurred with great frequency and did not represent postoperative vessel occlusion. We retrospectively reviewed the preoperative and postoperative perfusion scans of 33 consecutive patients undergoing pulmonary thromboendarterectomy. New postoperative perfusion defects were noted in 23 of 33 patients. The incidence of new defects was increased tenfold in segments that had (1) normal preoperative angiographic findings, (2) normal preoperative radionuclide perfusion, and (3) not been entered at the time of surgery. Postoperative angiograms, available in 15 of 33 patients, documented the nonembolic, nonocclusive nature of the new perfusion scan defects. The most plausible alternate explanation for this previously undescribed finding is a redistribution of pulmonary arterial resistance induced by the thromboendarterectomy, namely, a pulmonary vascular \"steal.\"\r"

The raw data from this study were compared with data from our previous studies in North American Indians and Salt Lake City whites with Middle European ethnic backgrounds. No differences were found for any of the age and height coefficients. The only differences found were in the comparisons of the equation intercepts (bias) for male FVC and FEV1 between data for the Salt Lake City white subjects and both Hispanic American and North American Indian men. These small biases could be explained by technical or sampling biases or they may represent small ethnic differences. Although the differences from our Salt Lake City study are small, we recommend that ethnic-specific equations be used where they are available.\r"

Plasma samples were collected until 24.5 h, and urine samples were collected until 72 h after theophylline administration. The concentrations of theophylline and the major metabolites, resulting from N-demethylation and 8-oxidation, were measured utilizing a high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique. No significant changes in theophylline half-life, volume of distribution, protein binding, total body clearance, or renal clearance were noted. In addition, renal excretion of unchanged theophylline, the products of the N-demethylation, 3-methylxanthine, and 1-methyluric acid, and the product of the 8-oxidation, 1,3-dimethyluric acid, were not altered by simultaneous administration of lomefloxacin. Orally administered lomefloxacin is absorbed quickly and to a high extent. During administration of 400 mg twice daily, plasma concentrations reached are well above minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of pathogens that are frequently isolated in lower respiratory tract infections. This study shows that lomefloxacin in a twice daily dose of 400 mg does not effect theophylline metabolism. Lomefloxacin and theophylline can be coadministered without concern about effects of lomefloxacin on theophylline pharmacokinetics.\r"

For the entire group, RVef was unchanged (27 +/- 9 vs 27 +/- 9 percent). In the eight patients with an initial RVEDVI greater than 140 ml/m2, the fluid challenge increased Pra and Ppao and reduced LVSWI without any other significant effect. There was no significant correlation between RVEDVI and Pra and only a weak correlation between RVESVI and Ppa. However, there was a highly linear correlation between both RVEDVI and RVESVI and changes in RVEDVI and in RVESVI, suggesting that in the absence of severe pulmonary hypertension RV output is primarily dependent on RV preload.\r"

We asked whether oxygen consumption is dependent on oxygen delivery in severe acute respiratory failure secondary to AIDS-related PCP. In five patients who had AIDS-related PCP, diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, no evidence of bacterial infection, and acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation with arterial oxygen tensions less than 75 mm Hg while breathing at least 50 percent oxygen, and PEEP greater than 10 cm H2O, we determined oxygen delivery and consumption by calculation from thermodilution cardiac output and arterial and mixed venous oxygen contents. Oxygen delivery was increased using transfusion of two units of packed red blood cells over one hour. Oxygen delivery increased 22 percent (638 +/- 204 to 778 +/- 201 ml/min.m2, p less than or equal to 0.006). Oxygen consumption increased 11 percent (134 +/- 34 to 149 +/- 29 ml/min.m2, p less than or equal to 0.02). The oxygen extraction ratio did not change. We conclude that similar to ARDS and sepsis, oxygen consumption may be pathologically dependent on oxygen delivery in patients who have severe acute respiratory failure secondary to AIDS-related PCP.\r"

It has been shown that increasing QO2 by infusing a vasodilator may reveal this O2 debt in septic patients. To investigate whether the site of action of vasodilators may be of importance in unmasking such an O2 debt, we administered prostacyclin, a prostaglandin with a preferential effect on the microcirculation, and phentolamine, an arteriolar vasodilator, in 11 patients studied during the first 48 hours after the onset of sepsis, and compared their effect on whole body oxygen consumption (VO2) and skin microvascular blood flow. The results demonstrated that increasing QO2 by prostacyclin but not by phentolamine significantly increases VO2 in critically ill patients with sepsis. The site of action of vasodilators may therefore play an important role in their ability to unmask an O2 debt.\r"

Serial hemodynamics were measured in conscious dogs using radionuclide heart scans and thermodilution cardiac output catheters. Plasma endotoxin concentrations were determined with a chromogenic Limulus amebocyte lysate assay. Viable Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Escherichia coli implanted intraperitoneally produced concordant hemodynamic patterns of septic shock (p less than 0.01). Endotoxin concentrations were more than tenfold lower in dogs infected with P aeruginosa compared with E coli (p less than 0.0001). Despite lower endotoxin levels, P aeruginosa-infected dogs had a higher mortality (p less than 0.01), more severe hypotension (p less than 0.05), and greater depression of the left ventricular ejection fraction (p less than 0.05) than dogs with E coli sepsis. A nonlethal E coli challenge combined with leukopenia (induced by a nonlethal dose of radiation) resulted in a mortality of 60 percent (p less than 0.01) without greater cardiovascular dysfunction or higher endotoxin concentrations. These findings suggest that bacterial products other than endotoxin and host-related factors may be important contributors to the toxicity, cardiovascular instability, and mortality of Gram-negative septic shock. Quantitative determinations of plasma endotoxin are unlikely to correlate with the clinical severity of septicemia in heterogeneous patient populations infected with different Gram-negative organisms.\r"

  ".W": "A 64-year-old man with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease presented with pneumococcal pneumonia that progressed to respiratory failure within one week, requiring mechanical ventilation. Despite a low minute ventilation and clear chest roentgenogram, multiple weaning attempts failed. Bronchoscopy revealed significant narrowing of the distal trachea with erythema, edema, and ulceration of the mucosa. Cytology of tracheal washings was consistent with herpes simplex virus, and the patient was successfully extubated following treatment with intravenous acyclovir. Bronchoscopy following acyclovir therapy demonstrated resolution of the inflammation and narrowing. Herpetic tracheitis is a rarely recognized reversible cause of tracheal stenosis, especially in a nonimmunocompromised patient. It should be suspected in patients without an obvious cause of failure to wean from mechanical ventilation, and can be successfully treated with acyclovir.\r"

These long-term changes have been characterized by an impaired performance on a range of behavioral tasks, which in turn have been associated with a physiologic depression of hippocampal evoked responses but not with any discernible histopathology. In the present study, we examined the hippocampi of rats in the postseizure phase of the tetanus toxin model and observed no significant changes in the concentration of neurochemical markers for six neurotransmitters. Therefore, the long-term reduction in hippocampal excitability cannot be attributed to any major loss of afferents or hippocampal neurons using aspartate, acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, norepinephrine (NE), or serotonin as their transmitters.\r"

Because we addressed this phenomenon when we explained the pathogenesis of infantile spasms in children, we wished to study the interference exerted by some gamma-endorphin fragments on EEG epileptiform and behavioral symptoms induced by CRF in the rabbit. Animals were implanted intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) with semichronic cortical and hippocampal electrodes, together with a cannula into the left lateral ventricle. When some gamma-endorphin derivatives (DT gamma E, DE gamma E) were injected intravenously (i.v.) for 4 days (or hydrocortisone once), they prevented the EEG ictal seizures induced in the hippocampus of rabbits by CRF injected i.c.v. Hydrocortisone and DE gamma E also prevented the appearance of scattered spiking and partially prevented tardive enhancement of theta voltage in the hippocampal EEG. Finally, DE gamma E also prevented stereotyped behavior and excitability induced by CRF. These results confirm the regulatory role exerted by CRF in limbic structure excitability and suggest that the above peptides may be involved in a regulatory feedback mechanism of CRF metabolism or activity. The possibility that these peptides may also have interesting antiepileptogenic properties should be considered.\r"

T3 had no effect on penicillin-induced epileptiform activity. There was, however, an active accumulation of radioactively labeled T3 in the slices. A rat cervaux-isole preparation was used to determine focal seizure thresholds in the visual cortex, and no acute (2-4 h) effects were demonstrated. No significant acute effects of T3 on brain excitability in the hippocampus and visual cortex was observed, despite an active accumulation of T3. Thus, the effect of T3 on brain excitability most likely is due to delayed effects.\r"

We randomly selected households and attempted to enroll all residents aged less than or equal to 1 year; 337 eligible subjects agreed to participate (93% response rate). We administered a standard neurologic disease screening examination to all subjects and, if any abnormality was found, we administered a standard neurologic evaluation. We detected 19 cases of active epilepsy; the mean age at onset was 12 years, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures were the most common diagnosis (10 of 19, 53%). The prevalence of active epilepsy among Caribbean coastal Guaymi (57/1000) is considerably greater than that in lower class Panama City populations (22/1000) or in other parts of the world. To identify risk factors for epilepsy, we collected epidemiologic data and serum (for Cysticercus antibody) from subjects with active epilepsy and from 44 age/sex-matched controls. Significantly more cases (47%) than controls (6%) had other family members with epilepsy (relative risk, RR = 14); 44% of cases and 13% of controls reported a history of febrile seizures during childhood (RR = 6).\r"

None of the children had pure temporal lobe epilepsy. Computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were normal in four of the eight children. The scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) showed lateralized interictal epileptiform abnormalities in all eight and lateralized ictal onset in five of eight. In seven children, interictal PET showed focal hypometabolism; the eighth child had focal, ictal hypermetabolism. ECoG at the time of surgery showed epileptiform spiking, slowing, and/or suppression of normal background activity that in every case corresponded to the focus on PET scan. The ECoG findings support the notion that in children with epilepsy focal metabolic abnormalities on PET correspond to electrophysiologically abnormal areas of cortex, which are presumably also the epileptogenic regions. Such areas can appear normal on anatomic imaging studies (CT and MRI). When ictal scalp EEG data are ambiguous or contradictory, PET provides a less invasive means than chronic grid or depth electrode recording for evaluating whether a localized epileptogenic area exists.\r"

Seventeen had a diagnosis of epilepsy (partial or secondarily generalized). Testing was by reading, arithmetic, and intelligence subtests during continuous telemetric EEG and video monitoring. Children with left-sided discharges had significantly lower reading performance than children with right-sided discharges. During reading, epileptiform discharges occurred relatively less frequently and with a shorter total duration over the left hemisphere than the right. This supports the view that cognitive tasks suppress epileptiform discharges when they activate a region of the brain within the epileptogenic zone. Discharges from other epileptogenic zones not directly activated by the tasks are increased, however.\r"

Size and topography of the cortical tubers were analyzed on axial and coronal views, in T2 sequences, and the large tubers greater than 10 mm were studied. In addition, EEG follow-up data were reviewed retrospectively. Twenty-six patients (76%) had both MRI large cortical tubers and EEG foci, 3 had normal EEG, 2 had normal MRI, and the remaining 3 had only small tubers. The number of large tubers was significantly related to EEG foci. A topographic MRI/EEG correspondence was observed for at least one tuber in 25 of the 26 patients, and correspondence was complete in 10 patients. Large cortical tubers without corresponding EEG foci were observed in 11 patients; these tubers mainly involved the frontal regions and were found before the patients were 2 years old. EEG foci without corresponding tubers were observed in 4 patients. In addition, secondary bilateral synchrony was preferentially observed in patients with frontal lesions and after the age of 2 years. These data confirm that the cortical tubers are epileptogenic and that their expression may be influenced by regional cortical maturation.\r"

Aphasia and hyperkinesia were isolated in three patients and associated with global regression of higher cortical functions in one patient. Massive intellectual deterioration and psychotic behavior were associated with transient aphasia in one patient. The epilepsy (focal motor and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, subclinical EEG focal seizures during sleep, and atypical absences) always regressed spontaneously or with antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment. The EEG in waking patients showed focal and generalized spike-wave discharges on a normal background rhythm. Discharge topography and pattern changed frequently. During sleep, discharges always increased. At some time during syndrome development, all patients had bilateral spike-waves for greater than 85% of the sleep period, while at other times the discharges were discontinuous or continuous but focal or unilaterally hemispheric. Discharge topography and abundance changed from night to night. The abnormal EEG and the impaired higher functions developed and regressed together, but not with strict temporal correlation. Our own experience suggests that the Landau-Kleffner syndrome and epilepsy with continuous spike-wave activity in slow-wave sleep cannot be clearly differentiated. They may be different points on the spectrum of a single syndrome.\r"

The pharmacologic profiles differed from those observed in focal epilepsies, resembling instead those of certain generalized epilepsies, such as West or Lennox-Gastaut syndromes. Phenobarbital (PB), carbamazepine (CBZ), and phenytoin (PHT) were ineffective or worsened the EEG and neuropsychological symptoms, whereas valproate (VPA), ethosuximide (ESM), and benzodiazepines were partially or transiently efficacious. Dextroamphetamine produced a dramatic but transient improvement in waking and sleep EEG in one of two children; aphasia did not change. Corticosteroid treatment resulted in improved speech, suppression of seizures, and normalization of the EEG in three of three children. Our own experience and data from the literature suggest that corticosteroids should be given in high doses as soon as the diagnosis is firmly established and should be continued in maintenance dose for several months or years to avoid escape. Early diagnosis, before mutism or global deterioration develops, appears to be essential for effective therapy with minimal neuropsychological sequelae.\r"

Our data demonstrate that in Landau-Kleffner syndrome, cerebral glucose utilization is not normal during sleep. The metabolic pattern varied between the children but the metabolic disturbances always predominated over the temporal lobes. They were right-sided, left-sided, or bilateral. In the two first patients, EEG recordings showed continuous spike-and-wave discharges during sleep and a right-greater-than-left asymmetry was observed in temporal areas. In patient 1, the asymmetry was associated with a relative increase of glucose utilization of the right posterior temporal region. In patient 2, the glucose utilization was relatively decreased in the left anterotemporal and left perisylvian regions. In patient 3, the sleep EEG showed no discharge and no significant asymmetry was observed; however, glucose utilization of both temporal lobes was decreased. Lower metabolic rates in subcortical structures than in cortex were also noted in the three children. This metabolic pattern may be related to the maturation of the central nervous system (CNS).\r"

Blood samples were collected for estradiol, P, and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin analyses on these two occasions. The compliance was poor and the results of only 137 cycles were obtained. The menstrual cyclicity was not significantly modified during this long-term study. Of the 137 cycles, 22 pregnancies occurred (16%), and 4 (18.2%) were not interrupted by the second dose of RU486. Thus, because of the high failure rate, use of RU486 at the time of the natural P withdrawal cannot be advocated as a \"once-a-month\" contragestive agent.\r"

In FF the concentrations of PA and PA inhibitor were significantly lower than in GC lysates and showed no significant difference between the oocyte-corona-cumulus complex groups. The concentration of fibronectin was significantly elevated in GC lysates of mature follicles. The marked increase of TPA in human GC during oocyte maturation showed a positive correlation with the increase of FF follicle-stimulating hormone and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin in the group of mature oocyte-corona-cumulus complex.

In ectocervical epithelium, homogeneous staining was found for P29 throughout the menstrual cycle and after menopause. Weak or moderate staining was found for ER in the basal and, occasionally, the parabasal layers of ectocervix during the proliferative phase. In contrast, staining decreased in secretory phase and postmenopausal epithelia. Staining was negative for PR in all the exocervical epithelia. Heterogeneous staining, more pronounced for P29, was found for the three antigens of the study in endocervical epithelium. Staining did not change with the hormonal status of patients, except for ER, where staining decreased during the secretory phase. Stromal cells were negative or weakly positive, whereas muscular fibers were positive. This study suggests that the capacity of response of the steroid apparatus of cervical cells to fluctuations of circulating estrogens and progestins is limited compared with some of the cell functions, such as mucus secretion, or with other target tissues, such as endometrium. Additionally, the differences found in the pattern of expression of the three antigens studied suggest that the steroid-dependent growth and differentiation in ectocervix is regulated differently to endocervix.\r"

From 4 to 18 years of subfertility we observed a treatment independent cumulative conception rate of 22%, which was independent of the length of subfertility. Twenty-seven women conceived after 1 to 4 years' subfertility, and 30 conceived after greater than 4 years' subfertility. The fecundity of the latter group was significantly greater than that of women with 1 to 4 years' subfertility, being similar to \"normal\" subjects who had stopped contraception. This study demonstrates that a subgroup of apparently normal women with greater than 4 years' subfertility responded positively to clinic attendance independent of any investigation(s) or therapy.\r"

Home monitoring with the Ovarian Monitor (St. Michael Research Foundation, Macleod, Victoria, Australia) minimizes hospital visits and overcomes many of the logistic difficulties associated with gonadotropin use. It utilizes a system of homogenous enzyme immunoassay using lysozyme conjugates to measure quantitatively either urinary estrone-3 or pregnanediol-3-glucuronide. Results obtained by 24 patients in 57 cycles using the Ovarian Monitor at home correlate closely with results obtained in the laboratory (estrone-3-glucuronide r = 0.955; pregnanediol-3-glucuronide r = 0.958). Cycle outcomes (ovulation, 74%/cycle; clinical pregnancy, 30%/cycle; multiple pregnancy, 13%/pregnancy; hyperstimulation, 11%/cycle) are no different from those achieved in laboratory-monitored patients. Home monitoring can be as safe and effective as laboratory monitoring, offers significant social benefits, and improves access to this form of therapy.\r"

Sixty-seven couples entered a randomized, prospective trial comparing CC/IUI with observation. During the study, there were 14 pregnancies in 148 treated cycles (fecundity = 0.095) compared with 5 pregnancies in 150 untreated cycles (fecundity = 0.033). Using life-table analysis and the log-rank test, the difference in fecundities was statistically significant. Pregnancy outcome was not significantly different between the two groups. When comparing conception with nonconception cycles during treatment, no differences between the size of the lead follicle or the number of dominant follicles was detected. We conclude that treatment with CC/IUI improves fecundity in couples with unexplained infertility or surgically corrected endometriosis.\r"

This model is tested first on another material (group II = 321, 1977 to 1985). A Goodness-of-fit test indicates excellent agreement between the expectations from the model and the observed number of pregnancies in group II. Second, the two groups are pooled (= 1,086). Then only three variables give significant prognostic information about the time until pregnancy: (1) the man's age at semen analysis (years); (2) the percentage of morphologically normal spermatozoa (ln %); and (3) the degree of motility (good/poor). These three important variables enter into a new and better prognostic model.\r"

Patients with high SI50 titers (greater than 10 units) did not conceive by ordinary or repeated artificial inseminations with husband's semen (AIH) except when treated with in vitro fertilization (IVF) and embryo replacement. Patients with relatively low SI50 titers (less than 10 units) could conceive either by repeated or ordinary AIH, though the success rates were lower than by IVF-embryo replacement. It is important to assess the SI50 titers by the quantitative method to select treatments for infertile women with SI antibodies. In follow-up studies of the patients who conceived successfully, it was found that SI50 titers tended to decline as pregnancy proceeded.\r"

Conversely, sperm antibody levels were increased against the capacitated husbands' sperm in the husbands' serum and wives' cervical mucus, originally testing negative for cytotoxic antibodies against uncapacitated sperm. Antibody levels were unaltered against donors' sperm undergoing capacitation, except for a reduction in titers in the serum of isoimmune wives. The differences in sperm antibody assay results, depending on whether or not spermatozoa are incubated under conditions favoring capacitation, are specific to the husbands' and not to the donors' spermatozoal antigens.\r"

In 15 normospermic specimens after overnight incubation, the motility parameters in the control versus the Sperm Select group were as follows (mean +/- SEM): motility, 18.8% +/- 2.8% versus 27.4% +/- 2.9%; velocity, 21.5 +/- 2.4 versus 27.2 +/- 2.2 microns/s; linearity, 3.8 +/- 0.3 versus 4.4 +/- 0.2; lateral head displacement, 1.5 +/- 0.2 versus 1.9 +/- 0.1 microns; and tail beat/cross frequency, 8.8 +/- 1.3 versus 10.8 +/- 1.4 Hz. The density of motile sperm was 10.8 +/- 2.3 versus 18.5 +/- 2.5 X 10(6) sperm/mL. Finally, the velocity coefficient, the multiple of the sperm motility and linear velocity, was 4.6 +/- 1.1 versus 8.1 +/- 1.4. However, we found no Sperm Select related differences when testing sperm membrane integrity with hypoosmotic swelling and supravital staining. Thus, Sperm Select improves the retention of sperm motility (most prominently velocity) apparently due to a direct action of hyaluronic acid on sperm metabolism or contractility rather than to preservation of sperm membrane integrity. In 20 oligospermic specimens, Sperm Select caused similar improvements in sperm motility, and the duration of motility could be predicted from the degree of enhancement in sperm velocity after short-term Sperm Select exposure. A modified Sperm Select protocol is described that further increases motile sperm yield without a centrifugation step.\r"

When the exposure was prolonged to 6 hours, spermatozoa incubated in the presence of FF displayed significant differences in some movement characteristics as compared with samples incubated without FF supplement. When only rapidly moving sperm subpopulations were considered, these effects of FF were similar to those produced by a short incubation with the solubilized cumulus oophorus matrix as described previously. After 24 hours of incubation, there was a remarkable beneficial effect of FF on motility preservation. Possible physiological and clinical implications are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Using a primate model, we have tested a novel regimen of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist plus pulsatile GnRH for the achievement of controlled restoration of gonadotropin secretion and ovulation induction. As a prelude, ovariectomized cynomolgus monkeys (n = 3) were treated with Antide ([N-Ac-D-Nal(2)1, D-pCl-Phe2, D-Pal(3)3, Lys(Nic)5, D-Lys(Nic)6, Lys(iPr)8, D-Ala10]-GnRH) (3 mg/kg per day) for 6 consecutive days. On the 7th day, pulsatile GnRH therapy was initiated in a 7 day-on: 7 day-off regimen for a total of four exposures. Next, four intact monkeys were given Antide to suppress ovarian function (estradiol less than 10 pg/mL) followed by pulsatile GnRH. In the ovariectomized monkeys, Antide-induced suppression of gonadotropin concentrations was reversed by the pulsatile GnRH so that follicle-stimulating hormone concentrations were completely normalized and luteinizing hormone concentrations were returned to within the lower range (+/- 2 SD) of the pretreatment mean. The abruptness of the onset or loss of gonadotropin secretion was precisely synchronized with the weekly on and off phases of the GnRH pulse regimen. In intact monkeys, ovarian steroid secretions were abruptly subdued and then successfully re-established by pulsatile GnRH in the face of sustained circulating levels of Antide. Thus, we conclude that our primate model of combination therapy, GnRH antagonist plus pulsatile GnRH, establishes the possibility of a new clinical treatment regimen for patients desiring relief from the sequelae of hyperandrogenemia (polycystic ovarian disease) and ovulatory dysfunction.\r"

A biologically weaker progestin, 20 alpha-dihydroxyprogesterone, is reportedly increased at midcycle, but the importance of 20 alpha-dihydroxyprogesterone in regulating LH release has not been systematically studied. We therefore evaluated the effect of 2 doses of 20 alpha-dihydroxyprogesterone on the bioactive LH surge onset in ovariectomized monkeys. Chronically cannulated monkeys (n = 10) received estradiol (E2) benzoate (50 micrograms/kg) with and without subsequent 20 alpha-dihydroxyprogesterone injections (50 micrograms/kg, n = 3 and 100 micrograms/kg, n = 3). Blood was collected every 15 minutes over preselected intervals and the plasma assayed for bioactive LH and gonadal steroids. Low-dose 20 alpha-dihydroxyprogesterone administration resulted in periovulatory peripheral 20 alpha-dihydroxyprogesterone levels and did not advance the bioactive LH surge onset. In contrast, high-dose 20 alpha-dihydroxyprogesterone resulted in supraphysiological 20 alpha-dihydroxyprogesterone levels, slight increases in progesterone levels, and significant advancement of the surge over E2 benzoate treatment alone. We conclude that periovulatory levels of 20 alpha-dihydroxyprogesterone do not play a role in modulating the estrogen-induced bioactive LH surge.\r"

Using the mouse to study the causes of the contragestational actions of elevated E2:P ratios, it was confirmed that administration of E2 (40 to 80 ng) before implantation inhibited implantation and 0.4 mg of P totally reversed the effect of 40 ng E2. Fluids collected from the uterine lumen of E2-treated (40 ng) mice significantly inhibited the incorporation of 3H-uridine by mouse blastocysts in vitro, whereas fluids from mice treated with E2 (40 ng) and P (0.4 mg) together had no inhibitory effect. In contrast to these contraceptive effects of high E2, lower levels of E2 (5 and 20 ng) caused an increase and no change to the implantation rate, respectively, and fluids from mice treated with E2 (20 ng) significantly enhanced blastocyst metabolism. Concomitant administration of P to these low dose E2 mice enhanced these effects. Thus, a large elevation of the E2:P ratio inhibited implantation and created a uterine lumenal milieu that suppressed embryonic metabolism. These effects could be reversed and implantation re-established by the correction of the E2:P ratio by exogenous P.\r"

In vitro fertilized oocytes from old CBA/J-strain mice (greater than 20 weeks) that suffer age onset infertility lacked suppression and manifest cleavage arrest that could be partially reversed by adding spermine to the cultures.

While estrogen deprivation during preimplantation period in 5 animals exposed to 14 ovulatory cycles resulted in only one pregnancy, only 3 of 13 monkeys treated during postimplantation period continued pregnancy to term. In comparison with controls (4 of 5 monkeys becoming pregnant), the percent protection against pregnancy in animals treated during preimplantation period was 93.

  ".U": "91059936\r", 
  ".W": "In view of reports that the human epididymis may play no role in human fertility, literature on the fertilizing capacity of epididymal spermatozoa was reviewed. The survey indicates that under the circumstances of their retrieval, human epididymal and testicular spermatozoa may have the ability to fertilize human eggs both in vivo and in vitro. Although the \"fertility profile\" of the normal epididymis cannot be explored in man, a fair assumption would be that fertilizing capacity develops fully in the distal part of the tract, judging from the higher motility and egg fusing ability of sperm taken from these regions of unobstructed tissue. Motility and fertilizing capacity observed with IVF or artificial insemination, in which sperm are obtained from obstructed ducts, may occur at a level in the tract more proximal than normal, as in animals. The pregnancies resulting from aspiration of spermatozoa from, or anastomosis of the vas deferens to, the efferent ducts are of great clinical interest, but the pathological state of the tissue precludes definitive statements about the functioning of a normal epididymis. In the former case, the immediate origin of the fertilizing spermatozoon and the nature of the secretions previously bathing it are unknown and in the latter case the time needed before pregnancies occur is much greater than anticipated had fertile sperm been present in the proximal epididymis. The evidence supports neither the view that testicular sperm are inherently fertile nor that a simple aging of sperm cells is sufficient for the fertilizing potential of spermatozoa to be realized. It emphasizes, rather, the importance of the environment to which the sperm cells are subjected. Under abnormal conditions other accessory glands may secrete compounds that are necessary for the maturation of spermatozoa. Before more information is known of the exact situation existing, or having existed, in pathological human tissues from which fertilizing human spermatozoa can be obtained, great caution should be exercised in interpreting the results of pregnancies arising from the in vivo and in vitro insemination of testicular or epididymal spermatozoa.\r"

We identified 95 women whose preoperative evaluation revealed no other contributory factors for infertility and analyzed their pregnancy outcome after this procedure. Pregnancy success was inversely related to the extent of tubal distortion (dilation, rugal integrity, and status of the fimbria) and degree of adnexal adhesions. Using our classification system for distal tubal obstruction, patients with mild disease had an 80% pregnancy rate, whereas patients with moderate and severe disease had a 31% and 16% success rate, respectively. We found no statistically significant difference in pregnancy outcome when we compared this series with our previous group, reported in 1978, where contemporary microsurgical technique was not used. Although we feel that optimal surgical technique is important to maximize success, we conclude that the most important prognostic factor in pregnancy outcome after neosalpingostomy for distal tubal disease is the anatomical and functional integrity of the tube.\r"

At 1 month, the sectioned surfaces were still depressed and uniformly covered by thin endometrium (5 cases). After 2 months the uterine cavity was almost normal with minimal tendency to central fundal adhesions (6 women). Thus, spontaneous healing processes after hysteroscopic metroplasty progressed regularly and completely and there is probably no reason to delay attempts at pregnancy for longer than two cycles after surgery.\r"

  ".U": "91059958\r", 
  ".W": "The beta-cell is unique because its major agonists, i.e., insulin secretagogues, undergo metabolism instead of interacting with a receptor. This perspectives presents the hypothesis that the first part of a metabolic signal of a secretagogue is specific to the secretagogue and the beta-cell and can be envisioned as proximal. The second part, which occurs after transduction to more universal signaling mechanisms, is viewed as distal. Distal signaling and exocytosis in the beta-cell operate the same as in other cells. Aerobic glycolysis is required for glucose-induced insulin release. Because glyceraldehyde, which enters metabolism at the triose phosphates in the glycolytic pathway, is a potent insulin secretagogue but pyruvate, which is metabolized in the mitochondrion, is not an insulin secretagogue, the proximal signal for glucose-induced insulin release originates with an interaction between the central part of the glycolytic pathway and mitochondrial metabolism. The proximal message in leucine-induced insulin release originates with leucine allosterically activating glutamate dehydrogenase, which activates endogenous glutamate metabolism, and by the metabolism of leucine itself. The methyl ester of succinate is a potent experimental insulin secretagogue. It is puzzling why the glucose signal requires the interplay of glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism, whereas the signals from leucine and succinate originate entirely from within the mitochondrion. Leucine-induced insulin release is suppressed and glucose-induced insulin release is activated in islets cultured at a high concentration of glucose. Conversely, leucine-induced insulin release is activated and glucose-induced insulin release is suppressed in islets cultured at low glucose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

IDDM results from central destruction of the insulin-producing beta-cells of the pancreatic islets. Herein, we report that the outbreak of IDDM in BB/E rats is preceded by the spontaneous development of an anti-idiotypic antibody to a particular antibody to insulin made by the rats. This anti-idiotype, designated anti-DM-id, behaves as an antibody to the insulin-hormone receptor. Thus, a spontaneous anti-idiotypic antibody network whose products can affect the peripheral utilization of insulin seems to accompany the central destruction of beta-cells in developing IDDM.\r"

There was no significant difference in RFLP frequencies between the NIDDM subjects and a group of 87 matched White control subjects. Paired haplotype analysis of the IRG RFLPs suggested a difference between NIDDM and control groups for the endonuclease combinations Bgl II-Rsa I and Bgl II-Xba I. Analysis of implied haplotypes defined by the endonucleases Bgl II, Rsa I, and Xba I revealed one haplotype to be more prevalent in the NIDDM group; whereas, another haplotype was associated with the control group (P less than 0.02). Subset analysis within the NIDDM cohort compared the metabolic response of NIDDM subjects with the differing IRG haplotypes to a standard meal tolerance test. Both groups showed equivalent basal and postprandial glucose excursions, but one group revealed a significantly exaggerated plasma insulin response compared with the other (P less than 0.05). This may reflect the influence of genetic variation at the IRG locus on insulin sensitivity in patients with NIDDM.\r"

  ".W": "The action potential duration (APD) of ventricular muscles obtained from diabetic animals is reported to be prolonged. We studied the effect of varied periods of diabetes on APD prolongation using isolated ventricular papillary muscles from streptozocin-injected rats. We found that a diabetic period greater than 30 wk was necessary for the evolution of significant prolongation of APD. We then studied the effect of repeated hypoxia (PO2 40 mmHg) and normoxia (PO2 300 mmHg) on prolonged APD of diabetic muscles and compared the findings with those from control rats. Transmembrane potentials were recorded with conventional glass microelectrodes. Under normoxic conditions, the APDs of diabetic muscles were significantly prolonged, the maximum upstroke velocity of action potentials tended to be decreased, and the resting membrane potential was not changed significantly compared with controls. The first hypoxia (20 min) shortened the APD in both diabetic and control rats but more so in diabetic rats, thereby making the APD of diabetic rats virtually identical to the control rat APD during the hypoxia. On subsequent reoxygenation (30 min), these hypoxia-induced changes were almost recovered. The second hypoxia (20 min) produced more severe shortening of the APD in both muscle types, and the effect was again far greater in diabetic rats than controls, ending with a reversed sequence of APDs and the APD of diabetic muscles much shorter than the controls. Excessive shortening of APD in diabetic muscles during hypoxic conditions was speculated to be due to greater increases in the outward K+ current through ATP-regulated K+ channels that may be secondary to the more severe reduction of intracellular ATP concentrations in diabetic versus control hearts.\r"

  ".W": "Insulinlike growth factor I (IGF-I) is a mitogenic hormone with important regulatory roles in growth and development. One of the target organs for IGF-I action is the kidney, which synthesizes abundant IGF-I receptors and IGF-I itself. To study the involvement of IGF-I and the IGF-I receptor in the development of nephropathy, one of the major complications of diabetes mellitus, we measured the expression of these genes in the kidney and in other tissues of the streptozocin-induced diabetic rat. The binding of 125I-labeled IGF-I to crude membranes was measured in the same tissues. We observed a 2.5-fold increase in the steady-state level of IGF-I-receptor mRNA in the diabetic kidney, which was accompanied by a 2.3-fold increase in IGF-I binding. In addition to this increase in IGF-I binding to the IGF-I receptor, there was also binding to a lower-molecular-weight material that may represent an IGF-binding protein. No change was detected in the level of IGF-I-peptide mRNA. Similarly, IGF-II-receptor mRNA levels and IGF-II binding were significantly increased in the diabetic kidney. IGF-I- and IGF-II-receptor mRNA levels and IGF-I and IGF-II binding returned to control values after insulin treatment. Because the IGF-I receptor is able to transduce mitogenic signals on activation of its tyrosine kinase domain, we hypothesize that, among other factors, high levels of receptor in the diabetic kidney may also be involved in the development of diabetic nephropathy. Increased IGF-II-receptor expression in the diabetic kidney may be important for the intracellular transport and packaging of lysosomal enzymes, although a role for this receptor in signal transduction cannot be excluded. Finally, the possible role of IGF-binding proteins requires further study.\r"

The pathogenesis of experimental diabetic neuropathy is unknown but might include changes in the distribution of these elements in morphological compartments. In this study, this possibility was examined via electron-probe X-ray microanalysis to measure both concentrations of elements (millimoles of element per kilogram dry or wet weight) and cell water content (percent water) in frozen, unfixed, unstained sections of peripheral nerve from control and streptozocin-induced diabetic rats. Our results indicate that after 20 wk of experimental diabetes, mitochondria and axoplasm from myelinated axons of proximal sciatic nerve displayed diminished K and Cl content, whereas in tibial nerve, the intraaxonal levels of these elements increased. In distal sciatic nerve, mitochondrial and axoplasmic levels of Ca were increased, whereas other elemental alterations were not observed. These regional changes resulted in a reversal of the decreasing proximodistal concentration gradients for K and Cl, which exist in nondiabetic rat sciatic nerve. Our results cannot be explained on the basis of altered water. Highly distinctive changes in elemental distribution observed might be a critical component of the neurotoxic mechanism underlying diabetic neuropathy.\r"

The markers for these loci are tyrosine hydroxylase, insulin, and c-Ha-ras-1 proto-oncogene (HRAS1). We report, in a study of 27 families, that a specific haplotype (H), containing a 3-kilobase (kb) HRAS1-Taq I DNA polymorphism, segregated differentially in diabetic and nondiabetic siblings (P = 0.005). A parallel population study showed that the 3-kb HRAS1-Taq I polymorphism is increased in frequency in type I patients having two strong HLA-susceptibility haplotypes compared with other type I patients or healthy control blood donors (P less than 0.010 and P less than 0.025, respectively). The polymorphic variable, enhancer, and promoter regions flanking the human insulin gene on the H haplotype were not associated with type I diabetes. These results indicate that the HRAS1 locus or genes in linkage disequilibrium with this locus are involved in the pathogenesis of HLA-DR3/4 type I diabetes mellitus.\r"

Chemical cross-linking studies with AGE-bovine serum albumin have demonstrated that the molecular weight of this receptor is approximately 90,000. We previously established that the binding constant (Ka) of this receptor site for the chemically synthesized model AGE, 2-(2-furoyl)-4(5)-(2-furanyl)-1H- imidazole-butyric acid (FFI-BA), on cells of the mouse macrophagelike cell line RAW 264.7 is identical to that for AGE proteins. Therefore, FFI was used as an affinity matrix in the first purification step of the AGE-R. The membranes of RAW 264.7 cells were solubilized in octyl-beta-glucoside and subjected to affinity chromatography on FFI-sepharose and gel permeation on Superose 6 fast protein liquid chromatography. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of this material revealed a high enrichment of a 90,000-Mr protein that had AGE binding activity. Approximately 25% of the protein at this step was the 90,000-Mr protein. The 90,000-Mr membrane protein was purified to homogeneity by rechromatographing the material on Superose 12 in the presence of SDS before and after reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol. After these harsh conditions, the 90,000-Mr protein lost AGE binding activity. Additional cross-linking studies on human peripheral monocytes revealed an AGE-R protein of identical size to that on RAW 264.7 cells, suggesting the relatively highly conserved nature of this molecule.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The sensor and a similar O2 reference sensor were implanted in the superior vena cava near the entrance of the right atrium. The sensor response was conveyed externally either by a telemetry system implanted nearby, surgically accessed leads, or chronically maintained percutaneous leads. Summing over the six implants, there was a total implantation period of 333 days during which glucose sensors were functional on demand. The sensor response showed agreement with conventionally assayed blood samples after accounting for a response lag. Sensor response to glucose showed little change over the implant period. Biocompatibility, enzyme lifetime, O2 availability, O2 sensor stability, and biochemical interference were not limitations. Results demonstrated that this sensor can function effectively as an implant in dogs for a period of months and has the potential for long-term operation.\r"

Compared with age-matched lean women, plasma lipid and apolipoprotein concentrations of the obese women before surgery favored atherogenesis. The risk for CHD may further be exacerbated in the IGT and NIDDM groups by the prevalence of smaller and denser low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) particles. LDL size correlated negatively with plasma insulin levels independent of triglyceride levels, age, or body mass index (BMI). After surgery, BMI, plasma insulin, and triglyceride levels decreased, but LDL size increased, and LDL density decreased. Neither cholesterol nor LDL cholesterol levels were affected after surgery, but high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol was increased in all patients after surgery. Although the mechanisms underlying the changes in the properties of LDL could not be determined from this study, these changes appear to be of benefit in reducing CHD risk in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "The liver/islet (GLUT2) and muscle/adipose tissue (GLUT4) glucose-transporter gene products, membrane proteins that facilitate glucose uptake into cells, are important molecules for normal carbohydrate metabolism. Recent isolation of the genes encoding these proteins provides a means to assess the role of possible defects that might contribute to impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion or impaired insulin-mediated glucose uptake, both prominent phenotypic features of non-insulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM). A GLUT2 cDNA clone was isolated from a human liver cDNA library to search for polymorphisms at this locus in American Blacks. Three highly polymorphic sites were identified, one of which (EcoRI-Hae III) appears to be due to an insertion and/or deletion of 200 base pairs of DNA. Significant linkage disequilibrium between these sites over approximately 30 kilobases of genomic DNA suggested that these polymorphisms could be in linkage disequilibrium with mutations at this locus if they exist. A GLUT4 cDNA clone was also utilized to search for polymorphisms at this locus, but only one previously described polymorphism was observed. GLUT2 and GLUT4 cDNA probes were used to evaluate DNA polymorphisms in genomic DNA from American Blacks with NIDDM. The allelic, genotypic, and haplotypic frequencies of the DNA polymorphisms at these loci did not differ from the frequencies in nondiabetic subjects. Because no associations with NIDDM were found, it appears unlikely that mutations at these loci contribute in a major way to the genetic susceptibility to NIDDM observed in American Blacks.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of insulin-resistant glucose-transport activity in enlarged aged adipocytes was examined. Glucose-transport activity was assessed by measuring 3-O-methylglucose transport and the concentration of HepG2 erythrocyte/glucose transporter (GLUT1), and the muscle/adipose tissue transporter (GLUT4) was estimated by immunoblotting. Basal glucose-transport activity increased 6.3-fold/cell but remained constant per unit cellular surface area due to cell enlargement. Maximal insulin-stimulated transport activity remained constant per cell but decreased per unit cellular surface area. On a per protein basis, GLUT1 and GLUT4 from aged rats decreased to approximately 60 and 10% of those from young rats, respectively. However, when the protein content of each fraction and the recoveries of marker enzymes were used for estimating the amount of transporters in intact adipocytes, the amount of GLUT1 per cell remained relatively constant, whereas that of GLUT4 decreased. In basal cells from young rats, 31% of the total GLUT1 per cell was located in the plasma membrane, whereas in those from aged rats, 63% was located in the plasma membrane. Thus, in comparing basal adipocytes from aged rats with those from young rats, GLUT1 per cell in the plasma membrane increased 2.8-fold, but this increase was less than that of transport activity (6.3-fold). In basal cells from young rats, 8% of the total GLUT4 was located in the plasma membrane, and a 4.5-fold increase was observed with insulin treatment, but the amount of GLUT4 in each fraction from aged rats markedly decreased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the impact of mild hypoglycemia on CNS function in healthy adults, we measured brain stem auditory evoked potentials and P300 potentials (elicited by cognitive processing of auditory stimuli) during hypoglycemic or euglycemic insulin clamps (80 mU.m-2.min-1). In the hypoglycemic clamp study (n = 8), plasma glucose was allowed to fall from 4.6 to 3 mM in hourly approximately 0.5-mM steps and subsequently returned to euglycemic baseline levels. In the euglycemic clamp study (n = 8), plasma glucose was maintained at baseline levels throughout. Neither brain stem nor P300 responses changed during the euglycemic control study; symptoms and counterregulatory hormones were also unaffected. During the hypoglycemia study, epinephrine and growth hormone rose once plasma glucose reached 3.4 +/- 0.1 mM. Brain stem and P300 potentials remained unchanged until the 3-mM glucose step, when neurophysiological changes suddenly developed in conjunction with reported symptoms. At this glucose level, the wave V component of the brain stem potential was selectively altered in 7 of 8 subjects. Furthermore, P300 latency significantly increased, and amplitude diminished. Changes in both brain stem and cortical (P300) responses reversed when euglycemia was restored. We conclude that modest reductions in plasma glucose (to 3 mM) produce marked alterations in both brain stem and cortical responses to auditory stimuli. These changes in neural function appear at the same time as symptoms and follow rather than precede the rise in counterregulatory hormones during hypoglycemia. Our data suggest that the adverse effects of mild hypoglycemia on brain function are not limited to higher centers but also involve the brain stem.\r"

The diabetic patients had normal kidney function (glomerular filtration rate 112.1 +/- 7.2 ml.min-1.1.73 m-2, renal plasma flow 459.0 +/- 23.4 ml.min-1.1.73 m-2) and were normotensive according to standard sphygmomanometer examinations. Mean +/- SE AMBP (systolic/diastolic in mmHg) measurements in diabetic patients (24 h, 131.7/77.2 +/- 2.9/1.8; 0600-2200, 132.3/78.4 +/- 2.9/3.4; 2200-0600, 125.1/75.7 +/- 3.9/3.4) significantly exceeded control values during all times (24 h, 121.8/70.3 +/- 2.9/1.9; 0600-2200, 120.7/71.8 +/- 2.6/2.0; 2200-0600, 108.2/61.5 +/- 6.6/2.7). Mean 24-h AMBP exceeded 135/85 mmHg in 49% of diabetic patients. The same threshold of 135/85 mmHg was used to determine the prevalence of abnormal measurements per time period (pressure burden). Pressure burden was increased twofold in diabetic patients compared with control subjects. Mean AMBP was significantly reduced at night in control subjects but not in diabetic patients. Changes in blood pressure were not related to kidney function in diabetic patients. AMBP recordings uncovered an increased prevalence of abnormal mean blood pressure, increased pressure burden, and a lack of diurnal variation of blood pressure in subjects with type I diabetes mellitus. These findings have important implications for early intervention strategies in diabetes mellitus because AMBP recordings correlate well with end-organ damage.\r"

This study evaluated abnormalities in platelet signal transduction in diabetic patients, including turnover of phosphoinositides, mobilization of intracellular Ca2+, and phosphorylation of 20,000- and 47,000-Mr proteins (P20 and P47). Washed platelets were obtained from 6 patients with NIDDM whose platelet aggregation rates were abnormally elevated (DM-A group), 11 NIDDM patients with normal platelet aggregation rates (DM-B group), and 8 age-matched healthy control subjects. The mass and specific radioactivity of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PIP), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and phosphatidic acid (PA) in 32P-labeled platelets were not different among the three groups. Hydrolysis of PIP2, PIP, and PI; accumulation of PA; and phosphorylation of P20 in platelets stimulated by 0.05 U/ml thrombin were significantly increased in the DM-A group compared with the control or DM-B group. There was no difference in P47 phosphorylation among the three groups. On the contrary, P20 and P47 phosphorylation induced by 50 nM of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, an activator of protein kinase C, was significantly decreased in the DM-A group. Additionally, the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration [( Ca2+]i) was measured with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fura 2. Although the basal [Ca2+]i value was similar in the three groups, the rise in [Ca2+]i induced by 0.05 U/ml thrombin in the presence and the absence of extracellular Ca2+ was significantly higher in the DM-A group than the other groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies demonstrated that administration of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) to diabetic rats rapidly increases serum triglyceride levels and stimulates hepatic lipogenesis without affecting the activity of adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase or serum insulin levels. The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanism by which TNF increases serum triglyceride levels and stimulates hepatic fatty acid synthesis in diabetic animals. The maximal increase (approximately 2-fold) in serum triglyceride levels in diabetic rats is seen with a dose of 10 micrograms TNF/200 g body wt, and the half-maximal effect is observed with 5 micrograms TNF/200 g body wt. The clearance of labeled triglyceride-rich lipoproteins from the circulation is not affected by TNF administration (triglyceride t 1/2; diabetic vs. TNF-administered diabetic, 3.5 +/- 0.7 vs. 4.0 +/- 0.6 min, respectively; NS). The production of triglyceride, measured by the Triton WR-1339 technique, is increased twofold in diabetic animals after TNF administration. These results indicate that the rapid increase in serum triglyceride levels after TNF treatment is accounted for by increased hepatic lipoprotein secretion. TNF administration did not alter either the amount or activation state of hepatic acetyl-CoA carboxylase, a key regulatory enzyme in fatty acid synthesis. There was also no change in the hepatic levels of fatty acyl-CoA, an allosteric inhibitor of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. However, there was a 71% increase in hepatic citrate concentrations. Citrate is an allosteric activator of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and changes in hepatic citrate concentrations have been shown to mediate changes in the rates of fatty acid synthesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Diabetes was induced with streptozocin at 8 wk of age in spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats. Antihypertensive drugs were administered in drinking water from the time of induction of diabetes in all groups. Blood pressure reduction was equal in the diabetic and nondiabetic SHR rats receiving either enalapril or hydralazine plus metoprolol. In diabetic SHR rats, there was a rise in serum creatinine after 32 wk, which did not occur in diabetic rats treated with either antihypertensive regimen or in nondiabetic rats. Both drug regimens reduced albuminuria in diabetic and nondiabetic SHR rats to a similar degree. Enalapril and the combination of hydralazine and metoprolol were associated with decreased glomerular basement membrane thickness and glomerular volume in diabetic and nondiabetic SHR rats without significant effect on fractional mesangial volume. Thus, antihypertensive therapy retards the development of albuminuria, glomerular basement membrane thickening, and glomerular hypertrophy in the rat in the presence or absence of diabetes. No specific benefit of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition was observed in these hypertensive models of nephropathy. Human studies comparing the effects of different classes of antihypertensive drugs on kidney function, proteinuria, and glomerular morphology are warranted.\r"

The two levels of hyperglycemia increased plasma insulin levels severalfold but decreased the insulin response to 27 mM glucose by 19 and 95%, respectively, versus saline infusion. Diazoxide (5 mg.kg-1.h-1), when continuously infused during the hyperglycemia protocols, completely inhibited the glucose-induced rise in plasma insulin levels. Diazoxide transformed beta-cell insensitivity to stimulation: glucose-induced insulin release was thus increased 318% after moderate hyperglycemia and 707% after marked hyperglycemia. These stimulatory effects of diazoxide were reversed by exogenous insulin infusion (8 or 2 U/24 h) in a dose-dependent manner. It is concluded that excessive beta-cell stimulation rather than glucotoxicity underlies hyperglycemia-induced beta-cell insensitivity. Effects of hyperinsulinemia can form part of the mechanisms whereby excessive stimulation affects beta-cell secretion.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between the clinical competence of general practitioners and the degree of peer consultation about diagnostic and therapeutic problems was studied. Three aspects of clinical competence are discerned: attention paid to somatic aspects, patient-orientation and risk of unnecessary harm of the management. Clinical competence has been measured by a written simulation of patient-doctor encounters using five patients and assessment procedures in a study with a correlational design. For this study 49 subjects were selected from a population of 184 GPs who completed their vocational training in general practice at the University of Utrecht between 1975 and 1980. They were selected from those who consult their colleagues frequently and systematically about a variety of patients' problems and from those who do so little or not at all. The 49 subjects did not differ from the remainder in several relevant aspects such as practice setting, subscription to medical journals, etc. The 49 GPs are relatively consistent in the quality of attention they pay to somatic aspects. The consistency with regard to the two other aspects is rather low, especially regarding the risk of unnecessary harm. Attention paid to somatic aspects is connected with patient orientation. The latter is also connected with risk of unnecessary harm, but the former is not. The three aspects are more or less separate aspects of clinical competence. Peer consultation has a direct relationship with quality of attention paid to somatic aspects; GPs who do not consult among peers anyway display a lower quality of attention to somatic aspects in comparison to those who do so.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In the debate about 'what is a competent general practitioner?' little attention has been paid ot the actual practice situation of general practitioners. This paper, based on the 18 most important studies in the literature about medical competence, tries to re-initiate this debate by proposing a clear distinction between 'competence', (what a physician is capable of doing) and 'performance' (what a physician does in his day-to-day practice). With this distinction we looked at whether studies defined both competence and performance, how they dealt with these concepts, what measurement instruments were used and what the conclusions of the studies were. Although it is the common reasoning that competence is a good predictor of performance this concept could not be affirmed. This survey shows that the majority of studies use wrong concepts and come to invalid conclusions. With the empirical distinction between competence and performance however, this paper proposes new directions for the quality assessment of general practitioners.\r"

The answers of the 467 respondents (response rate 60%) showed no clear relationship between signs and symptoms of the patients and the diagnosis made. In the authors' opinion the diagnosis of pneumonia was made too often. The decision whether or not to prescribe an antibiotic for a coughing patient was based in part on the diagnosis made, but in part it was also made on the basis of the signs and symptoms, irrespective of the diagnosis. The authors have the impression that general practitioners tend to prescribe antibiotics too quickly to coughing patients. There is a need for guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of patients with acute bronchitis and related conditions.\r"

A survey of 186 patients in one general practice showed that 44% consumed supplements; almost half of these took them daily, and over half had taken them for longer than a year. Younger patients were more likely to take vitamins than older ones. Multivitamins were the most frequently used supplement, followed by iron and vitamin C. Major reasons patients cited for supplement use were to ensure good nutrition, to prevent illness, and for tiredness/fatigue. Patients were most influenced in their decision to take vitamins by family and friends rather than by doctors. General practitioners may find it valuable to include questions about vitamin/mineral supplement use in the medical history.\r"

Altogether 497 telephone calls were registered during the study period, and 494 (99%) of those who called could be contacted. Of those who had been given advice about self-care (in all 173 pieces of advice to 98 subjects), 98% stated that they had followed the advice given. In the total series, 91% of the subjects stated that they were content with the contact with the telephone advisers. The majority of those who were not content with the contact had been recommended self-care or given an appointment time with a delay of more than one week. In 10% of the cases the telephone advisers (all of them nurses) considered that they could not give adequate advice because of lack of appointment times with the doctor. In 4% of the cases decisions were made which agreed with the subject's wishes but were not in agreement with what the nurse considered most adequate. When a suitable appointment time was available (422 calls), all but three calls were considered as handled medically correctly, and all but two cases were considered to have been referred to correct level of care. It was concluded that the nurses handled the telephone advisory service in an adequate way.\r"

Poor agreement was found between depression as measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale and the general practitioner's assessment. Possible reasons for this include the difficulty of finding a satisfactory operational definition of depression for use by general practitioners, the problems of identifying depression in the elderly, the arbitrary definition provided by the scale and the confounding of depression, as measured by the scale, with cognitive status.\r"

This study examines the prevalence of emotional problems among 776 patients in primary care clinics in Israel using the GHQ-28 and as detected by their physicians. Hypotheses were tested relating to physician and practice characteristics and the extent to which they affect the matching of the two methods of problem identification. Using the GHQ, 69% of the patients were classified as 'cases'; physicians identified 31% of the patients as 'cases'. Specialist status in family medicine, interest and belief in the importance of emotional health, good communication, a low patient load and familiarity with the patient all predicted a better match of physician classification to GHQ-defined 'caseness'. The implications of these findings for ongoing medical education are briefly discussed.\r"

For the 1456 women who had menstruated within the last month or so, detailed questions were asked about the last menstrual cycle. Each woman was assigned to one of seven premenstrual symptom sets. Three groups had 'pure' symptoms, ie a predominant single symptom (breast tenderness, bloating or irritability). Three groups had 'mixed' symptom-sets. The largest of the 'mixed' groups was formed by the women who reported breast tenderness, bloating and irritability together with tension and depression. Women in this group were most likely to rate their symptomatology as severe. The last group contains a large number of women with miscellaneous symptoms. Characteristics of these groups are outlined. The study highlights the importance of distinguishing among premenstrual syndromes as this can foster more effective clinical management.\r"

Lower scores on all six dimensions of the MOSI were associated with the number of diagnoses and identified mental illness on the patient summaries, unemployment and with positive scores on the Nottingham Health Profile.

The paper suggests that the MOSI may be a candidate for Health Status measurement in research and audit in primary care, but further research is required.\r"

Most of the 360 (60%) GPs who replied expressed on interest in alternative practice; and 47% revealed that they used one or more alternative methods themselves, most often homoeopathy. However, the number of patients given alternative treatment by each doctor was small. Almost all (90%) of the GPs referred patients to alternative practitioners. There is no reason to assume that GPs make use of alternative methods just to meet their patients' wishes. A majority of the respondents thought that these therapies included ideas and methods from which the regular methods might benefit. Actual contacts with alternative practitioners are mostly limited to those practicing acupuncture, homeopathy and manipulative medicine with a regular medical or paramedical education. The integration of alternative medicine within the medical system goes hand in hand with its acceptance by general practitioners. Contact with medically or paramedically qualified practitioners has hardly any legal implications for individual general practitioners.\r"

Quantitative data were obtained by means of a questionnaire. One-third of the respondents were of the opinion that the patient would have been better off if he/she had not entered the programme. Over half found the loss more difficult to accept because the patient had been involved in the programme. Nevertheless, many had the feeling of satisfaction that everything possible had been done. However fruitful transplantation technology may be for a specific group of patients, it also involves undesirable side-effects which should be included in the careful judgement of this technology.\r"

This study of the BICAP (Circon-ACMI, Stamford, CT) and Gold (Microvasive, Watertown, MA) probes evaluates the maximal force that can be applied through an endoscope and quantifies the depths of coagulation and sticking at varying parameters in a beef liver model. Maximal forces of application were determined with 3.2- and 2.3-mm probes extended 3 and 6 cm outside the endoscope at 90 degrees and 45 degrees. Depths of coagulation and sticking were measured at 90 combinations of varying forces of application (0, 50, and 100 g), watt settings (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9), and durations (2, 6, 10, and 14 seconds; 3 x 2 seconds, 7 x 2 seconds) for the 3.2-mm BICAP and Gold probes. Mean maximal force of application decreased with greater extension or angulation of the probe outside the scope (3.2-mm BICAP--90 degrees: 3 cm, 110 g; 6 cm, 56 g; 45 degrees: 3 cm, 50 g; 6 cm, 30 g; P less than 0.001; 3.2-mm Gold--90 degrees: 3 cm, 130 g; 6 cm, 105 g; 45 degrees: 3 cm, 62 g; 6 cm, 48 g; P less than 0.001). The maximal force was significantly greater with the Gold probe than with the BICAP in seven of eight comparisons. Significant variations among the mean depths of coagulation (in millimeters) for pooled data of each parameter were observed with force of application (BICAP: 0 g, 0.8; 50 g, 1.4; 100 g, 1.7), watt settings (BICAP: 1, 0.6; 3, 1.7; 5, 1.4; 7, 1.4; 9, 1.3), and duration of treatment (BICAP: 2 seconds, 0.8; 6 seconds, 1.1; 10 seconds, 1.4; 14 seconds, 1.5; values for the Gold probe were comparable). The greatest depths of coagulation were observed at 100 g force, watt setting 3, and 14 seconds or 7 x 2 seconds duration. Sticking paralleled depth of coagulation, increasing with force and duration of application. In conclusion, optimal treatment of bleeding gastroduodenal lesions with bipolar electrocoagulation includes (a) placing the tip of the endoscope en face as close as possible to the bleeding lesion, (b) applying the maximal force possible, (c) using a low-watt setting (approximately 3), and (d) treating with prolonged periods of coagulation.\r"

In the present study, the effects of putrescine depletion and its supplementation on duodenal villus length and calcium absorption were examined in newborn and 5-week-old chicks. Administering either alpha-difluoromethylornithine, a specific inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, or N1,N4-bis(2,3-butadienyl)-1,4-butanediamine, a specific inhibitor of polyamine oxidase, to newborn chicks significantly decreased the duodenal content of putrescine and calcium transport activity. The putrescine depletion also induced shortening of the duodenal villus length. The inhibition of calcium absorption and villus length in the putrescine-depleted chicks was almost completely restored by administering putrescine to the birds. The effect of the putrescine depletion and its supplementation on the duodenal villus length and the calcium absorption was reproduced in 5-week-old vitamin D-deficient chicks given vitamin D3 or 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. These results clearly indicate that putrescine is somehow involved in the vitamin D action in maintaining the morphological and functional development of the intestinal villus mucosa.\r"

Although transferrin and ferritin are water soluble, most radioiron in gut homogenates after an intraluminal dose of radioiron is recovered in water-insoluble precipitates. Most radioiron in the precipitates was insoluble in detergents and organic solvents and was characterized as mucins. These isolates bound iron in vitro with a Kd of 9.09 x 10(-5). Similar iron binding was observed with commercial mucins. Iron binding to mucin occurred at acid pH and maintained the iron available for absorption with alkalinization. Similar pH-dependent binding to mucin was observed with zinc, cobalt, and lead. Iron competitively inhibited binding of these metals to mucin. However, iron chelates of ascorbate, fructose, and histidine donated iron to mucin at neutral pH. These data provided a role for gastric HCl and intestinal mucin in absorption of iron and metal cations and partial explanation of the competition for absorption between certain metals from the gut lumen. It is postulated that intestinal mucin delivers inorganic iron to intestinal absorptive cells in an acceptable form for absorption.\r"

Thirty-four patients with small-cell carcinoma, of whom 5 had chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction and 29 had no digestive symptoms, were studied serologically. Four of the 5 patients with gut dysmotility had immunoglobulin G antibodies reactive with neurons of the myenteric and submucosal plexuses of jejunum and stomach in an indirect immunofluorescence assay. Antibodies of this type were not found in any of the 29 patients who had no gut dysmotility, nor were they found in patients with chronic idiopathic intestinal pseudoobstruction (n = 8), ovarian cancer (n = 20), or epilepsy (n = 4) or in normal subjects (n = 9). In 4 of the patients with paraneoplastic pseudoobstruction, antibodies in highly diluted serum (1:4000-1:8000) bound selectively to nuclei and cytoplasm of neuronal elements in the gut. This novel autoantibody activity suggests that intestinal pseudoobstruction occurring in patients with small-cell carcinoma may have an autoimmune basis. From a clinical standpoint, serological testing offers a simple means for determining which patients with gut dysmotility syndromes may have associated small-cell carcinoma, thereby enabling earlier diagnosis and treatment of the tumor.\r"

To validate the geographic pattern shown by the Medicare data, hospitalization was compared with mortality from inflammatory bowel disease among different states. Mortality and hospitalization statistics both suggested that the occurrence of inflammatory bowel disease was determined by environmental factors that had a marked geographic variation within the United States. Both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis appeared to be more frequent in northern parts of the United States than in southern and in urban more than rural parts. These trends were observed for men and women and for blacks and whites alike. Similar geographic patterns of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis suggested the influence of one or more identical risk factors for both diseases.\r"

  ".W": "Leukocyte adhesion molecules are important in cell-cell interactions of the immune system. Lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (cluster designation 11a) mediates interactions between T cells and mononuclear phagocytes through its ligand, the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (CD54), whereas complement receptors 3 (CD 11b) and 4 (CD11c) are involved in complement-mediated phagocytosis. Expression of CD11 molecules and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 was studied in colonic biopsy specimens from 20 patients with inflammatory bowel disease and 10 normal controls. In normal colon, few mononuclear phagocytes expressed lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 at high densities. The major adhesion molecule was CD11c. Thus, the largest population of normal colonic mononuclear phagocytes was represented by quiescent, resident macrophages with likely phagocytic function. In inflammatory bowel disease, mononuclear phagocytes showed only a slight increase in CD11a expression and no significant change in expression of CD11b and CD11c. By contrast, the percentage of mononuclear phagocytes expressing intercellular adhesion molecule 1 was increased from 6.9% +/- 3.9% in controls to 69.2% +/- 12.8% in ulcerative colitis (P less than 0.001) and to 45.7% +/- 22.8% in Crohn's disease (P less than 0.01), showing a close relationship with histological activity. The increased expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 in inflammatory bowel disease indicates a state of immunological activation induced by local release of inflammatory cytokines. Such induction of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 on mononuclear phagocytes may be important in the maintenance of chronic inflammation by facilitating interactions with T cells and T-cell antigen recognition.\r"

  ".W": "The prevalence of spontaneous reversal of flow in the portal venous system was non invasively evaluated by Doppler ultrasound in 228 patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Reversed flow was detected in the portal vein in 7 patients (3.1%), in the splenic vein in 7 patients (3.1%), and in the superior mesenteric vein in 5 patients (2.1%), with an overall prevalence of 8.3% (19/228). This prevalence did not differ in relation to the etiology of liver cirrhosis, whereas hepatofugal flow was found in more patients classified as Child's C (15.4%) and B (12.5%) than those classified as Child's A (2.7%) (P less than 0.02) and was associated with a higher frequency of hepatic encephalopathy (21% vs. 7.2%; P less than 0.05). Endoscopic evaluation of esophageal varices did not reveal any correlation between the presence and size of varices and hepatofugal flow, whereas red signs were detected more frequently in patients with this hemodynamic pattern (42.1% vs. 24.4%; NS). The rate of previous variceal bleeding was not significantly different in patients with and without hepatofugal flow (30.8% vs. 24.4%; NS). Conversely, the prospective evaluation of 15 patients with hepatofugal flow and 29 matched patients with hepatopetal flow, derived from the group of 228 patients, followed up for a period of 12-18 months, showed that variceal bleeding occurred in 9 of 29 patients with hepatopetal flow and in none of the 15 patients with hepatofugal flow (P less than 0.02). However, no statistical difference was found in the survival rates. This study indicates that the actual prevalence of reversed flow in the portal, splenic, and superior mesenteric veins in a nonselected cirrhotic population is 8.3%. From a clinical point of view, the data suggest that this finding might be considered an important prognostic factor because, while occurring in cirrhotic patients with more severe functional impairment, it might play a protective role against the risk of bleeding.\r"

Recently identified alterations of hepatic sex hormone receptor levels have provided a hypothetical mechanism for the pathogenesis of the feminization seen in cirrhotic men. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of experimental portal-systemic shunting in adult male rats on hepatic sex hormone receptor levels, plasma sex hormones, and two markers for sex hormone action in the liver. The following alterations were found in male rats with surgically created portacaval shunts compared with sham-operated controls: the hepatic content of cytosolic estrogen receptors was reduced by 35% and the cytosolic androgen receptors content by 59%; plasma levels of estradiol increased 6.7-fold while those of testosterone were reduced by 71%; the estrogen-responsive ceruloplasmin levels were decreased by 31% and the androgen-responsive male-specific estrogen binder by 72%. Based on these data, it can be concluded that portal-systemic shunting reduces the hepatic cytoplasmic content of several sex hormone related proteins. These changes are paralleled by a decreased estrogen responsiveness of the liver, as evidenced by the plasma ceruloplasmin level.\r"

  ".W": "To better understand the mechanism by which ethanol causes gastric mucosal injury, the effects of ethanol on isolated guinea pig gastric chief cells were investigated in vitro. Ethanol at 300-900 mmol/L dose-dependently stimulated an increase in pepsinogen release without affecting chief cells' viability. Ethanol stimulated an increase in initial Ca2+ influx rate and intracellular Ca2+ concentration at the same concentrations as it stimulated pepsinogen release, whereas it did not stimulate cyclic adenosine monophosphate accumulation. Pepsinogen release stimulated by 900 mmol/L ethanol was almost equal to that stimulated by 10(-8) mol/L COOH terminal octapeptide of cholecystokinin. Ethanol did not stimulate an increase in the accumulation of inositol trisphosphates and tetrakisphosphates in [3H]inositol-labeled chief cells, whereas cholecystokinin octapeptide caused a significant increase in inositol trisphosphates and tetrakisphosphates. Ethanol-stimulated pepsinogen release and increases in the initial Ca2+ influx rate and intracellular Ca2+ concentration were inhibited by 0.5 mmol/L La3+ or 1 mmol/L ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid but were not inhibited by nifedipine or verapamil. These results suggest that the effect of ethanol on pepsinogen release from the gastric chief cells may be due to its opening of a Ca2+ channel that is sensitive to La3+ and that the pepsinogen releasing action of ethanol may be one of factors for ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury.\r"

By applying this method, presence of HBV DNA was studied in 23 hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive and 11 HBsAg-negative sera from patients with chronic liver disease. Hepatitis B virus DNA was positive in 8 of 8 hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive, in 2 of 2 HBeAg- and anti-HBe-negative, and in 12 of 13 anti-HBe-positive sera. Hepatitis B virus DNA was undetectable in all HBsAg-negative sera even with amplification. To confirm specificity, the amplified product was directly sequenced. Sequences around 122nd and 160th codon of HBs gene, which determines subtypes d/y and w/r, respectively, were analyzed. The results were compatible with recent reports regarding the relation between HBV subtypes and HBV DNA sequence at those codons. Hepatitis B virus DNA could be detected at the level of one virion by gene amplification method, and its sequence could be determined by direct sequencing in a few days.\r"

In 18 (67%) hepatitis B surface antigen-positive and 10 (14%) hepatitis B surface antigen-negative patients, hepatitis developed during cytotoxic therapy (P less than 0.0001). Hepatitis could be attributed to exacerbation or reactivation of chronic hepatitis B in 13 (72%) hepatitis B surface antigen-positive patients but in only 2 (20%) hepatitis B surface antigen-negative patients (P less than 0.0001). Sudden increase or reactivation of hepatitis B virus replication gave rise to icteric hepatitis, nonfatal hepatic failure, and death in 22.3%, 3.7%, and 3.7% of patients who were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen; in 2%, 2%, and 0% of those positive for hepatitis B antibodies; and in none of those who were seronegative. Among the hepatitis B surface antigen-positive patients, male sex was the only factor that was associated with an increased risk of reactivation of hepatitis B virus replication.

  ".W": "We determined whether activity of pancreatic enzymes could be maintained in frozen duodenal juice by diluting the specimens or by adding nutrients or a chymotrypsin inhibitor. Human duodenal juice was obtained during cholecystokinin octapeptide IV administration. Trypsin, chymotrypsin, lipolytic, lipase, and colipase activities were measured in fresh undiluted or diluted (1:4 and 1:16 with saline and T-tube bile) duodenal juice as well as after adding CaCl2, casein, triolein, or a chymotrypsin inhibitor. Subsequently, the samples were frozen at -20 degrees C, and enzyme activities were measured at 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 28, and 56 days. Activities of chymotrypsin and colipase did not change during freezer storage. Trypsin survival was variable in juice from different subjects. By contrast, in duodenal juice to which no nutrient or only CaCl2 had been added, 90%, 65%, and 40% (P = 0.05 vs. undiluted) of lipolytic activity was lost by 56 days in undiluted and 1:4 or 1:16 diluted duodenal juice samples, respectively. The loss of lipolytic activity was prevented (P less than 0.05) by adding casein or casein and triolein to undiluted and 1:4 diluted samples and turkey egg white to undiluted samples. The loss of lipolytic activity was strongly associated with loss of lipase activity (r = 0.97) but only weakly associated with loss of colipase activity (r = 0.49). In summary, chymotrypsin and colipase are well preserved in frozen duodenal juice and can be used to accurately assess concentrations of pancreatic enzymes after thawing frozen duodenal samples. If it is necessary to measure lipolytic activity after freezing samples, lipase can be maintained by adding casein or a chymotrypsin inhibitor to juice before freezing.\r"

  ".W": "The short-term effects of rat pancreatic duct obstruction were evaluated and compared with those recently reported to follow obstruction of the rabbit pancreatic duct. In both species pancreatic edema and hyperamylasemia are noted, and the lysosomal hydrolase cathepsin B is redistributed from the lysosome-enriched to the zymogen granule-enriched subcellular fraction. Theoretically, this redistribution phenomenon might lead to digestive enzyme activation because cathepsin B is known to be capable of activating trypsinogen. The hyperamylasemia and pancreatic edema (but not the cathepsin B redistribution) that follow rat pancreatic duct obstruction were increased by infusion of a submaximally stimulating dose of the cholecystokinin analogue cerulein. Administration of the cholecystokinin-receptor antagonist L-364,718 reduced the hyperamylasemia but did not alter the pancreatic edema or cathepsin B redistribution. These observations indicate that cholecystokinin may modulate some but not all of the effects of duct obstruction. Secretin administration increased the degree of pancreatic edema and had no demonstrable protective effect. The rat duct-obstruction model described in this report may prove particularly useful in future studies designed to clarify the early events underlying the development of acute pancreatitis.\r"

Taurochenodeoxycholate or taurodeoxycholate, infused intraduodenally at 24 or 16 mumols/100 g rat per hour, respectively, caused cholestasis and severe hepatocellular necrosis within 8 hours. In contrast, tauroursodeoxycholate or taurocholate at 48 mumols/100 g rat per hour were choleretic. Tauroursodeoxycholate was not hepatotoxic, whereas taurocholate produced moderate hepatocellular necrosis. Simultaneous infusion of tauroursodeoxycholate to rats receiving taurochenoxycholate or taurodeoxycholate preserved bile flow and ameliorated hepatic injury in a dose-dependent manner. Tauroursodeoxycholate protected equally by intravenous and intraduodenal routes. Intravenous glycoursodeoxycholate also was protective. The hydrophobicity index of infused bile salts correlated well with their toxicity. Concurrent administration of ursodeoxycholate conjugates did not reduce biliary recovery of intraduodenally infused [24-14C]-taurocholate. Biliary alkaline phosphatase secretion was stimulated by infusion of taurocholate, taurodeoxycholate, or taurochenodeoxycholate; simultaneous infusion of ursodeoxycholate conjugates failed to prevent this increase. We conclude that ursodeoxycholate counteracts hepatoxicity of more hydrophobic bile salts via a direct effect at the level of the liver.\r"

  ".U": "91060023\r", 
  ".W": "Active transport of conjugated bile acids by the distal ileum is required for efficient enterohepatic cycling of bile acids. Experiments were performed in the rat to obtain accurate values for Tmax and Michaelis constant (Km) of the absorptive area of the rat ileum and to define the structural specificity of the transport system. The distal fifth (20 cm) of the small intestine from an anesthetized animal with a biliary fistula was perfused using solutions of 10 taurine-conjugated bile acids; a flow rate was used that was sufficiently high such that unstirred water layer effects were negligible and the intraluminal concentration remained unchanged throughout the perfused segment. The absorption rate was equated with the rate of hepatic bile acid secretion. Values of Tmax (mumol/min.kg) were markedly influenced by bile acid structure: cholyltaurine, 12.9; ursocholyltaurine, 9.6; ursodeoxycholyl taurine, 5.0; and lagodeoxycholyl-(3 alpha,12 beta-dihydroxy-cholanoic acid)-taurine, 1.2. Decreasing the length of the side chain of ursodeoxycholate conjugates from 8 to 6 carbon atoms was associated with a modest increase in Tmax values from 5.0 to 9.1 mumols/min.kg. Values of Km correlated with Tmax values and ranged from 0.5 to 5 mmol/L, being highest for those bile acids that were best transported. The Tmax for cholyltaurine transport was not reached when the intraluminal concentration was as high as its critical micellization concentration, precluding the definition of its Tmax; however, for ursocholyltaurine, with a critical micellization concentration of 40 mmol/L, saturation of transport was clearly shown. Kinetic parameters could not be obtained for two common dihydroxy conjugates (chenodeoxycholyltaurine and deoxycholyltaurine) because at a transport rate of 2 mumols/min.kg systemic toxicity and death occurred. These studies define the maximal transport capacity of the rat ileum for taurine-conjugated bile acids; they indicate that the ileal transport system in the rat is of low affinity and high capacity for taurine conjugates of hydrophilic bile acids, and they show that both nuclear substituents and side chain length influence the transport rate of taurine-conjugated bile acids.\r"

Three easily obtained measures were derived from each stone's optimal computerized tomographic image including the mean stone density, a measure corresponding to the standard deviation of the mean stone density value which we termed the stone density distribution index and which may reflect the physicochemical heterogeneity of a given gallstone, as well as the density range. After the administration of 2500 shock waves using an electrohydraulic generator, fragmentation was noted in 68 calculi (80%) and was satisfactory in 27 (32%) (where the largest resulting fragment diameters were all less than or equal to 5 mm). Strong determinants of satisfactory fragmentation on multivariate analysis included a stone diameter of less than or equal to 15 mm, the presence of an angular stone shape, and a stone density distribution index of greater than or equal to 60 Hounsfield units. The other parameters did not independently determine satisfactory fragmentation. Prospective clinical trials are needed to assess whether these findings result in a better prediction of the success of extracorporeal biliary lithotripsy and a broadening of its indications.\r"

Polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing method enabled us to analyze DNA sequence around codon 12 of K-ras gene in small quantities of specimens obtained from needle biopsies and aspirate samples for pathological diagnosis. All the materials obtained from 12 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma showed the mutations, whereas those obtained from 6 patients with chronic pancreatitis showed no mutations. In several cases using the mutations of K-ras gene as a marker, this analysis supplemented conventional pathology and cytology in making the diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The analysis of ras-gene mutations was useful for the clinical diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "To explore further the pathogenesis of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance observed in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension, we studied a 35-year-old woman with presinusoidal portal hypertension without cirrhosis due to nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver. After oral glucose ingestion, glucose tolerance remained normal; however, this occurred at the expense of a markedly hyperinsulinemic plasma response, suggesting the presence of insulin resistance. To examine this question more directly, we performed a stepwise euglycemic insulin clamp study in combination with an infusion of [6-3H]glucose and [1-14C]palmitate and indirect calorimetry. The ability of insulin to promote total body (primarily muscle) glucose uptake was markedly impaired, whereas its effect to suppress hepatic glucose production was normal compared with results obtained in nine healthy subjects. Moreover, insulin failed to normally suppress plasma free fatty acid turnover and oxidation in this patient. This informative case demonstrates that portal hypertension alone, without hepatic dysfunction from cirrhosis, is associated with impaired insulin-mediated glucose and plasma free fatty acid metabolism and may also play a predominant role in the development of insulin resistance in many cirrhotic patients.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the potential role of angiotensin-converting enzyme as a physiological regulator of neuropeptide activity in the alimentary tract, we purified and partially characterized this enzyme from the crude membrane fraction of rabbit gastric muscles. A single-step purification from detergent-solubilized gastric membranes by affinity chromatography, using lisinopril-Sepharose, yielded an electrophoretically homogeneous peptidase composed of 180-kilodalton polypeptide. The purified enzyme represented approximately 2% of [Leu5]enkephalin-degrading activity of the original membrane preparation, and 275-fold purification was achieved. The gastric angiotensin-converting enzyme hydrolyzed synthetic substrates specific to the lung enzyme. It hydrolyzed angiotensin I and several other bioactive peptides, by removing their carboxyl-terminal dipeptides. The activity was completely inhibited with 10(-6) mol/L captopril. The hydrolysis of enkephalin was enhanced twofold by addition of 0.3 mol/L NACl to the assay buffer. These properties were comparable with those reported for the rabbit lung enzyme. Therefore, it was concluded that rabbit gastric muscle tissue contains membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme. The results suggest a role for this enzyme as a local inactivator of bioactive peptides in the stomach wall.\r"

Apart from the gut, other organs affected included the pupils, sweat glands, lacrimal and salivary glands, and urinary bladder. Autonomic function tests showed the preservation of sympathetic adrenergic functions in contrast to the generalized involvement of postganglionic parasympathetic and sympathetic cholinergic nerves, including denervation hypersensitivity of the pupil and urinary bladder to exogenous cholinergic agonists. Cardiac and abdominal vagal responses were abnormal. Colon myenteric plexus ganglion cells were normal by morphological and immunohistochemical studies, suggesting that the selective cholinergic dysautonomia was the most likely pathophysiologic process responsible for the observed motility disorder. This study documents the occurrence of selective cholinergic dysautonomia following a viral illness, the importance of the extrinsic neural control on the motor function of the gastrointestinal tract, and the usefulness of combined motility and autonomic function testing in the evaluation of patients with symptoms suggestive of gut dysmotility.\r"

Results showed that (a) BrdU labeled the same number of proliferating cells in all organs as 3H-TdR; (b) BrdU colabeled with 3H-thymidine; (c) immunostaining was complete in 3-4 days but standard 3H-TdR took 2 weeks; and (d) qualitative analysis took 50% less time with BrdU than with standard 3H-TdR.\r"

Dot blots for hepatitis B virus DNA demonstrated marked reduction in viremia after 41 days of interferon alfa treatment. Southern analysis for hepatitis B virus in liver showed a pronounced decrement in actively replicating forms in the explant, although hepatic infection was still detectable. After liver transplantation, tests for serum hepatitis B virus DNA and hepatitis B surface antigen remained negative. The patient died 32 days after transplantation of causes unrelated to hepatitis B virus. DNA isolated from liver and other visceral organs at autopsy showed infection of the engrafted liver and the persistence of monomeric relaxed circular forms of hepatitis B virus DNA in pancreas, kidney, and spleen. Thus, graft reinfection occurred despite aggressive antiviral therapy and immunoprophylaxis combined with liver transplantation. Existing viral serological markers appear insufficiently sensitive to assess residual infectivity.\r"

In inflammatory bowel disease the expression of both HLA-DR and HLA-DP was increased, but that for HLA-DQ remained absent, suggesting an inherent defect in the ability of intestinal epithelial cells to express HLA-DQ. In related experiments, an interferon gamma-treated malignant epithelial cell line T84 also failed to stain for HLA-DQ and HLA-DP despite the presence of HLA-DR. Isolated RNAs for all three subclasses of HLA-D were detectable by slot-blot analysis, suggesting that the lack of HLA-DQ expression relates to posttranscriptional defects in intestinal epithelium. These and other differences with conventional class II antigen-positive accessory cells (macrophages/B cells) may help to explain the unique properties of intestinal epithelial cells as antigen-presenting cells.\r"

They were randomized to receive either endoscopic epinephrine injection or heat probe treatment. After endoscopy, the patients were transferred to the surgical gastroenterology ward and were managed by surgeons unaware of the treatment option. Bleeding was initially controlled in 96% by epinephrine injection and in 83% by heat probe (P less than 0.05). There was no significant difference in outcome as measured by transfusion requirement (4.5 units vs. 3.8 units), emergency surgery (20% vs. 22%), hospital stay (8 days vs. 7 days), and mortality (2 vs. 4) between the injection group and the heat probe group. Two patients in the heat probe group experienced perforation. We conclude that both endoscopic epinephrine injection and heat probe treatment are effective in stopping bleeding from actively bleeding ulcers. Epinephrine injection is technically easier to perform and has a higher initial success rate.\r"

Exposure of the antral mucosa to luminal pH 2 acidified intracellular pH in surface epithelial cells by 0.6-0.3 pH units. A 20-minute pretreatment with exogenous (pulmonary) surfactanlike phospholipid completely abolished this effect. Obviously, phospholipid protected the mucosa against intracellular acidosis by decreasing the apical cell membrane conductance to H+ (and other ions), because it increased apical cell membrane resistance by +108% and total transcellular resistance by +86% but had no significant effects on paracellular or total transepithelial resistances. In mucosas exposed to three barrier-breaking agents, 10 mmol/L acetylsalicylic acid, 20% (vol/vol) ethanol, and 10 mmol/L taurocholate, at acid luminal perfusate (pH 2.0-2.5), a profound intracellular acidification of 0.9-1.3 pH units/15 min occurred. Pretreatment of the tissue with phospholipid significantly opposed intracellular acidification, but the modulatory influences on the changes in intraepithelial potentials or resistances were less conspicuous and mostly insignificant.\r"

Fifty-one percent of subjects with adenomas and one with cancer had no neoplasms distal to the sigmoid-descending colon junction. One subject had a major postpolypectomy hemorrhage that stopped spontaneously. Screening colonoscopy, therefore, has a high yield for detection of neoplasms in asymptomatic average-risk persons aged greater than or equal to 60 years with negative fecal occult blood test results.

Responses obtained in 11 IBS patients were compared with those obtained in 11 normal subjects and in 11 subjects with organic disease of the gut or its related organs. All subjects were selected so that other factors that might contribute to increased airway responsiveness were excluded. The methacholine concentration that caused a 20% fall in the FEV1 (PC20), as well as the reduction in FEV1 induced by each methacholine concentration, were used to assess airway responsiveness. The geometric mean PC20 was 197.6 mg/mL (%SEM, 1.15) for normal subjects, 83.9 mg/mL (%SEM, 1.51) for subjects with organic bowel disease (P = 0.012), and only 12.8 mg/mL (%SEM, 1.74) for IBS patients (P less than 0.0001). The 22.5% +/- 2.5% decrease in FEV1 induced by 64 mg/mL of methacholine in IBS patients was significantly greater than that of 12.3% +/- 1.5% observed in healthy subjects (P = 0.003). In contrast, the 15.7% +/- 2.0% decrease in FEV1 observed in patients with organic disease was not different from that seen in normal subjects (P = 0.189). We conclude that IBS is associated with increased airway responsiveness following challenge with methacholine.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to determine if differences in the force of contraction in different regions of the rabbit colon are associated with variations in the histology of the corresponding muscle tissues. Circular and longitudinal muscles were isolated from strips of proximal and distal colonic muscle. Muscle strips stretched to L0 were either stimulated to contract or were processed for electron microscopy. Cross-sections of the smooth muscle cells of the taenia coli had a larger perimeter (P less than 0.001) and were surrounded by increased extracellular matrix (28% of the standardized box) compared with the muscle cells from the other sites in the colon (7%-13%) (P less than 0.001). Cross-sections of the proximal circular muscle cells had a smaller perimeter and were present in a greater number than the cells from other areas of the colon. The distal circular muscle generated a larger force than the other muscles after stimulation with bethanechol or K+ (P less than 0.05). The taenia developed less force than the other muscles (P less than 0.05). Bethanechol was a less potent stimulant for the longitudinal muscles than for the circular muscles (P less than 0.05). This study suggests that (1) the decreased efficacy of bethanechol and K+ stimulation of the taenia coli is caused in part by the smaller number of cells that are available to contract and (2) the increased efficacy for the stimulation of the distal circular muscle compared with the proximal circular muscle is unrelated to the mass of muscle and seems to be related to an inherent property of the muscle.\r"

  ".U": "91060058\r", 
  ".W": "The transport of riboflavin across the brush border membrane of human intestine was examined using the established brush border membrane vesicle technique. Both osmolarity and temperature studies have concluded that the uptake of riboflavin by these vesicles is mostly the result of transport of riboflavin into an active intravesicular space with less binding to membrane surfaces. When an inwardly directed Na+ gradient was imposed, transport of riboflavin was linear with time for approximately 20 seconds of incubation and was significantly higher than in the presence of an identical K+ gradient. Initial rate of transport of riboflavin as a function of concentration was found to include a saturable component in the presence of an inwardly directed Na+ gradient but was linear in the presence of an identical K+ gradient. The apparent Km and Vmax of the Na+ stimulated transport process were found to be 7.26 mumols/L and 0.97 pmol/mg protein per 10 seconds, respectively. The addition of high concentrations of unlabeled riboflavin and its structural analogue lumiflavin to the incubation medium caused significant inhibition in the transport of 3H-riboflavin in the brush border membrane vesicle incubated in the presence of an inwardly directed Na+ gradient but not in vesicles incubated in the presence of an identical K+ gradient. Inducing a relatively positive intravesicular space with the use of valinomycin and an inwardly directed K+ gradient caused significant inhibition in the transport of riboflavin. On the other hand, inducing a relatively negative intravesicular space with the use of anions of different lipid permeabilities caused significant stimulation in the transport of riboflavin. These results demonstrate that riboflavin transport in human intestinal brush border membrane vesicle is through a carrier-mediated system. This system functions in the presence of a Na(+)-gradient and seems to transport the substrate by an electrogenic process.\r"

This 6-year blinded study from 1981 to 1986 examines the causes of elevated VIP levels in patients. In healthy volunteers ( n = 144), VIP concentrations ranged from 14 to 76 pg/mL (mean +/- SE, 28 +/- 12), whereas in chronic renal failure, 4 of 34 patients or 12% [serum creatinine 4.5 - 9.0 mg/dL (397-795 mumols/L)] had an elevation to greater than 100 pg/mL. No patient with idiopathic hepatic cirrhosis (n = 12) had elevation of serum concentration of this peptide. Among 588 consecutive unselected patients undergoing evaluation for chronic diarrhea (n = 362; 62%) or possible neuroendocrine tumor (n = 214; 36%), 23 patients (3.9%) had concentrations greater than 76 pg/mL. In this group, 5 patients had functioning (VIP, 160-5975 pg/mL) and 5 had nonfunctioning (VIP, 80-120 pg/mL) pancreatic islet cell carcinomas: all 10 patients had hepatic metastases. Other known cases of elevated levels of VIP, ranging from 80 to 340 pg/mL, included other neurogenic tumors (n = 3), small- bowel resection (n = 2), inflammatory bowel disease (n = 2), chronic renal failure (n = 1), and prolonged fasting (n = 1). Patients with diarrhea in which VIP-secreting tumors were identified had plasma vasoactive intestinal peptide concentrations greater than 140 pg/mL. In patients with chronic diarrhea, determination of plasma vasoactive intestinal peptide levels did identify tumors secreting this peptide, but the results from this referral institution did not show identification of these tumors early in their clinical course.\r"

The system is uniquely active in this part of the body, but it represents a throwback to primitive mechanisms by which cells in virtually all organisms, including bacteria, yeasts, plants, and lower animals counteract water stress. In this brief review, we summarize how these \"compatible organic osmolytes\" help the renal medullary cells to survive, the mechanisms by which the organic osmolytes are accumulated, and how the accumulation is controlled to adjust for changing extracellular NaCl and urea concentrations. The compatible organic osmolytes are all intermediates in important biochemical pathways, and although the medical consequences are not yet fully worked out, it is already apparent that inappropriate accumulation of these solutes has major pathophysiological consequences.\r"

  ".U": "91060232\r", 
  ".W": "Our study examines the long-term cardiovascular effects after a brief period of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment in young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). SHR were treated with perindopril (3 mg/kg/day) by gavage from 2 to 6, from 6 to 10, or from 2 to 10 weeks of age. Systolic blood pressure was measured in the tail weekly until 25 weeks of age. Corresponding control groups received distilled water for the same periods. In each treatment group blood pressure was reduced significantly during treatment, rose when treatment stopped, but plateaued significantly below control SHR thereafter. This difference in blood pressure at 25 weeks of age was due to reduced total peripheral resistance as determined by microsphere methods, but plasma renin activity and angiotensin II concentrations were not different. Cardiac hypertrophy was also reduced in treated SHR. In a separate experiment, perindopril treatment from 6 to 10 weeks of age resulted in a significant reduction in the media/lumen ratios of mesenteric resistance vessels at 32 weeks of age. Concomitant administration of angiotensin II with perindopril from 6 to 10 weeks of age not only prevented the long-term effects on blood pressure seen with perindopril treatment alone but was associated with cardiovascular hypertrophy in excess of untreated control SHR. Finally, perindopril given for a shorter period (6 to 7 weeks) or later in life (20 to 24 weeks) had no significant long-term effects on blood pressure. These results demonstrate that a 4-week period of ACE inhibitor treatment in young SHR is sufficient to prevent the full expression of genetic hypertension and cardiovascular hypertrophy and that angiotensin II might be important in the development of hypertension in this model, its role in later life being less important.\r"

Hypertension in the clinic was diagnosed if the clinic blood pressure exceeded 140 mm Hg systolic or 90 mm Hg diastolic. In the absence of firm criteria for what constitutes hypertension at home, subjects whose average home blood pressure was in the upper decile of the whole population were considered to have hypertension at home. By these criteria, 7.1% of the whole population had \"white coat\" hypertension (i.e., high clinic but not elevated home readings). The prevalence of \"sustained\" hypertension (i.e., high readings in the clinic and at home) was 5.1%. Subjects with white coat and sustained borderline hypertension in Tecumseh were very similar. Both groups showed, at previous examinations (at ages 5, 8, 21, and 23 years), significantly higher blood pressure readings than the normotensive subjects. As young adults (average age 33.3 years), the parents of both hypertensive groups had significantly higher blood pressure readings than the parents of normotensive subjects. Both hypertensive groups had faster heart rates, higher systemic vascular resistance, and higher minimal forearm vascular resistance. Both hypertensive groups were more overweight, had higher plasma triglycerides, insulin, and insulin/glucose ratios than normotensive subjects. The white coat hypertensive group also had lower values of high density lipoprotein than the normotensive group. White coat hypertension is a frequent condition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

They were compared by projective and questionnaire-based psychological tests and their circulatory and neurohormonal reactivity to mental (Stroop color-word conflict test and arithmetic test) and physical stressors (orthostasis and bicycle ergometry test) were measured. Borderline hypertensive subjects externalized aggression less (p less than 0.05) but internalized it more (p less than 0.05) and were more submissive (p less than 0.05) when compared with controls. Offspring of hypertensive parents showed a similar but weaker pattern. Both risk groups reported more positive interactions with their parents (genetic risk subjects versus controls, p less than 0.05; borderline hypertensive patients versus controls, p = 0.08) and had higher state-anxiety levels (p less than 0.05). There were more subjective symptoms of beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated functions (e.g., tachycardia, tremor) in borderline hypertensive subjects and offspring of hypertensive parents, elevated heart rates (analysis of repeated measures, p less than 0.001), and enhanced plasma norepinephrine concentrations (p less than 0.05) when compared with controls. These findings in subjects at risk for the development of hypertension suggest that psychosomatic factors and sympathetic overactivity are involved in the early phase of hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "The rat zona glomerulosa has a renin-angiotensin system that appears to function as an autocrine or paracrine system in the regulation of aldosterone production. To further investigate dynamic changes of production of renin and aldosterone in vitro we developed a primary monolayer culture of rat adrenal glomerulosa cells in serum-free medium. Collagenase-dispersed glomerulosa cells were incubated in PFMR-4 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for 48 hours; the medium was then replaced with serum-free PFMR-4 medium. The cell viability and the aldosterone secretion were stable over the additional 48 hours in the serum-free control medium. After incubation for 24 hours in the serum-free medium, the cells were exposed to high K+ or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) for another 24 hours. ACTH stimulated aldosterone secretion, and this increased secretion was associated with an increase in renin activity (cell active renin, from 15.56 +/- 0.71 to 45.75 +/- 5.69; cell inactive renin, from 0.67 +/- 0.54 to 8.75 +/- 3.40; medium inactive renin, from 5.58 +/- 1.16 to 106.20 +/- 14.01 pg angiotensin I (Ang I)/micrograms protein/3 hr). Aldosterone was also stimulated by high K+. This increase was also associated with an increase in active renin in the cells (from 15.08 +/- 1.80 to 23.26 +/- 2.15 pg Ang I/micrograms protein/3 hr) and an increase in inactive renin in the medium (from 10.87 +/- 1.62 to 21.37 +/- 3.20 pg Ang I/micrograms protein/3 hr). Addition of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril attenuated both ACTH- and high K(+)-stimulated aldosterone secretion significantly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the spontaneously hypertensive rats, the internal diameters of arcuate and interlobular arteries and the proximal and distal afferent arterioles averaged 307 +/- 26, 52 +/- 2, 24 +/- 0.9, and 22 +/- 1.2 microns, respectively, at 80 mm Hg. They were 18-35% smaller (p less than 0.05) than the corresponding vessels measured in Wistar-Kyoto rats. In low calcium media, the arcuate and interlobular arteries and the proximal and distal afferent arterioles of spontaneously hypertensive rats exhibited a greater dilation than the vessels of Wistar-Kyoto rats. These observations suggest that the diameters of the preglomerular vasculature of the spontaneously hypertensive rats are reduced because of an elevated vascular tone rather than structural changes narrowing the lumen of these vessels. These results suggest that enhanced vascular tone in the preglomerular vasculature of juxtamedullary nephrons may contribute to the elevated renal medullary vascular resistance and resetting of the pressure-natriuretic relation previously observed in spontaneously hypertensive rats.\r"

Treatment from 5 to 9 weeks of age with Dazmegrel failed to reduce systolic blood pressure. When given from 3 to 9 weeks of age, Dazmegrel and OKY 046 induced a similar progressive and specific reduction (60%) in the urinary excretion of thromboxane B2 that was associated with a transient decrease in blood pressure level with Dazmegrel and a longer lasting blood pressure-lowering effect with OKY 046. AH 23848, given according to the same schedule, normalized the blood pressure level. This effect persisted 1 week after the cessation of the treatment. Interestingly, active doses of thromboxane synthetase inhibitors or of thromboxane A2 receptor blocker required a 3-week delay to exhibit their antihypertensive properties. It is concluded that 1) the elevated production of thromboxane A2 observed in young Lyon hypertensive rats is likely to participate actively in their blood pressure regulation and 2) this effect may be independent of its direct vasoconstrictor properties.\r"

To determine whether a similar adult-to-fetal shift in the expression of the thin-filament proteins occurs during cardiac hypertrophy, we have examined the expression of the isoforms of myosin, tropomyosin, and troponin T in the left ventricle of young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with and without treatment using enalapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. Phosphorylation of tropomyosin, which is predominant in the fetal state, was also analyzed. Twelve-week-old SHR were treated with enalapril for 2, 5, 8, and 9 weeks followed by withdrawal of treatment for 9 weeks. Control SHR, without drug treatment, were weight- and age-matched. After 9 weeks of enalapril treatment, mean arterial blood pressure was reduced (from 166 +/- 11 to 89 +/- 5 mm Hg), and left ventricular weight/body weight ratio was regressed (from 2.53 +/- 0.14 to 1.96 +/- 0.05 g/kg) to normotensive levels. During the 9-week treatment period, the percent V3 decreased in SHR substantially from 35 +/- 3% to 13 +/- 1%. There was a significant correlation between the left ventricular hypertrophy and the percent V3 myosin expression in the SHR during regression (r = 0.697, p less than 0.001). However, only the adult isoforms of tropomyosin and troponin T were detected in the SHR with or without enalapril treatment, and the level of tropomyosin phosphorylation remained constant irrespective of the degree of left ventricular hypertrophy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The present study assessed the preferential renal secretion and hepatic degradation of renin forms in humans. The renin form profile of secreted renal renin was determined before transplant in an ex vivo kidney donor perfusion system and compared with the peripheral plasma multiple renin form profile of normal subjects. The effect of hepatic degradation on renin forms was assessed in hepatic vein plasma in comparison with infrarenal vena cava plasma in hypertensive patients during renal vein renin studies. The results revealed a significantly greater proportion of the more basic forms in the perfusate of donor kidneys compared with normal plasma. In hypertensive patients the proportion of the more basic renin forms in the hepatic vein was significantly decreased in comparison with the infrarenal vena cava. Thus, the human kidney may preferentially secrete the more basic renin forms. In contrast, the liver preferentially degrades the more basic forms, giving these forms a shorter plasma half-life. The preferential secretion and clearance of the more basic forms of renin may contribute to short-term control of human renin-angiotensin system activity.\r"

  ".W": "The relation between endothelin and acetylcholine (ACh) was examined and compared in aortas from Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and from stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). The relaxation produced by ACh in an endothelin-induced contraction was less in aortas from WKY rats than in those from SHRSP. In aortas from WKY rats but not in those from SHRSP, the contraction produced by endothelin was augmented when the intact aortic rings were treated with methylene blue (10(-5) M). This augmentation was also found in preparations of the WKY rat aortic rings in which the endothelium had been removed. The augmentation was not present in SHRSP aortic rings that had been similarly denuded. Treatment with indomethacin (5 x 10(-6) M) had no effect on endothelin-induced contraction in either WKY rat or SHRSP aortic rings. Our findings indicate that endothelin and ACh have in common the ability to release endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) in WKY rat aortic rings. The reduced endothelium-dependent relaxation in response to ACh in the WKY rat probably reflects the fact that endothelin had already released the EDRF in rings from this strain of rats. The release of EDRF by endothelin is less in SHRSP than it is in WKY rats. Because of this failure of endothelin to release EDRF in SHRSP, endothelin may contribute to the increase in total peripheral resistance in this form of hypertension.\r"

After a run-in period of 4 weeks, the first subgroup (n = 16) received propranolol (80 mg/day) for 36 weeks followed by a placebo period of 4 weeks. The second subgroup (n = 15), after a run-in period of 4 weeks, was given a supplement of encapsulated fish oil (9 g/day) for 36 weeks with a subsequent period of 4 weeks in which fish oil placebo was given. The third subgroup (n = 16), after a run-in period of 4 weeks, was given propranolol (80 mg/day) for 12 weeks, propranolol (80 mg/day) plus fish oil capsules (9 g/day equivalent to 1.8 g/day of eicosapentaenoic acid and 1.1 g/day of docosahexaenoic acid) for 12 weeks, propranolol plus fish oil placebo (same doses for 12 weeks) with a subsequent period of 4 weeks when propranolol placebo was administered. The results indicate a blood pressure-lowering effect of fish oil, which was comparable with that of propranolol. The simultaneous intake of fish oil plus propranolol was more effective than propranolol or fish oil alone. Propranolol treatment resulted in a decrease of plasma norepinephrine, plasma renin activity, and thromboxane B2 formation. After fish oil supplementation, plasma norepinephrine and thromboxane B2 formation were likewise reduced, whereas plasma renin activity appeared increased. The decrease of serum triglycerides, total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol as well as the rise of high density lipoprotein cholesterol are concomitant beneficial effects, which justify the consideration of fish oil alone or in combination with antihypertensive drugs for the treatment of mild hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Does the average daily blood pressure correlate with hypertensive cerebrovascular disease better than the casual pressure, as has been reported in other target organ involvement? We investigated the associations of two abnormal findings on brain magnetic resonance imaging suggestive of a vascular etiology, low intense foci (lacunae), and periventricular hyperintense lesions on T1- and T2-weighted images, with both office and average daily blood pressure values in a population of 73 healthy normotensive and hypertensive elderly individuals (70 +/- 6 years old). Lacunae were detected in 34 subjects (47%); the number per subject ranged from 0 to 19 and was significantly correlated with advancing age. Furthermore, these changes were supposedly related to the average of noninvasive ambulatory (24-hour and during awake and asleep periods) pressure recordings but not to office pressures. The grade of periventricular hyperintensity was also significantly associated with advancing age and the average of ambulatory systolic pressure recordings, particularly during sleep, but not with office blood pressure. In comparisons of normotensive, \"office hypertensive,\" and hypertensive subgroups, abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging were appropriate to the level of the 24-hour blood pressure measurements but not to that of clinic pressure. In hypertensive patients, the presence of electrocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy was also associated with greater abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging. We conclude that ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is superior to casual pressure measurements in predicting latent cerebrovascular disease, which is unexpectedly common in apparently healthy elderly subjects.\r"

Our estimates are based on US census counts, blood pressure prevalence distributions from the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the annual risk of cardiovascular complications during 18 years of follow-up in the Framingham cohort. We then determined the impact of age on the relative efficacy of mass treatment and case-finding strategies in preventing systolic blood pressure-related events. At 45-54 years of age, only 30-40% of systolic blood pressure-related excess events occur in hypertensive individuals (systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg). With increasing age, however, the percentage of systolic blood pressure-related events that occur in hypertensive individuals rose substantially; in the older age group (greater than or equal to 75 years), 65-70% of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular disease events occur in hypertensive persons. The pattern is similar for men and women. The potential impact of a mass treatment strategy designed to shift the distribution of blood pressure downward by a small amount is greater in younger than in older groups, whereas an opposite trend is seen for a high-risk, hypertensive case-finding and treatment approach.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To determine if insulin resistance could be an antecedent to hypertension in a high-risk population, we studied normotensive (112 +/- 12/70 +/- 10 mm Hg) and borderline hypertensive (135 +/- 8/85 +/- 5 mm Hg) lean young black men (22-26 years old) with the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique. All subjects had clinically normal oral glucose tolerance. Body mass index and percent adipose mass were the same in both groups. Fasting plasma insulin concentration was significantly higher in the borderline hypertensive group (p less than 0.01). Insulin-directed exogenous glucose metabolism at the same degree of steady-state hyperinsulinemia was significantly lower in the borderline hypertensive group (5.98 +/- 2.22 versus 8.22 +/- 1.96 mg/kg/min; p less than 0.01). For the total population, a significant inverse correlation existed between the glucose infusion rate and systolic blood pressure (p less than 0.01). These data indicate that there is a relation between insulin-mediated glucose uptake and blood pressure. Furthermore, in this high-risk population insulin resistance may precede the onset of established essential hypertension.\r"

The familial susceptibility to hypertension was defined as at least one parent and one sibling who were hypertensive before age 65; subjects in the normotensive group had no familial history of hypertension. Renin gene polymorphisms located throughout the renin gene were identified by using three restriction enzymes (Taq I, HinfI, HindIII). For each polymorphic restriction site, allele frequencies were similar in the hypertensive and the normotensive groups. In the absence of parental genotypes, the haplotype frequencies combining the three restriction fragment length polymorphisms were estimated by using maximum likelihood techniques and were similar in both groups (hypertensive group, 0.429, 0.277, and 0.177; normotensive group, 0.453, 0.245, and 0.195 for the three most common haplotypes). A rare haplotype detected by Taq I/Hind III was apparently more frequent in the hypertensive than in the normotensive group (hypertensive group, tH 0.086, th 0.022; normotensive group, tH 0.038, th 0.050), but the difference was not statistically significant. In conclusion, no association between renin gene polymorphisms and essential hypertension was demonstrated in the present study.\r"

It has been proposed that in the spontaneously hypertensive rat, blood pressure follows a simple additive mode of inheritance and that the hypertension is primarily determined by a single major locus. To investigate the genetics of transmission of increased blood pressure in the spontaneously hypertensive rat, we performed a biometric genetic analysis of multiple, direct measurements of arterial pressure in unanesthetized, unrestrained rats derived by crossing spontaneously hypertensive rats with two different inbred normotensive strains, the Charles River Wistar-Kyoto rat and the Lewis rat. In both crosses, approximately 60% of the variation in blood pressure could be assigned to genotypic variation. The data fit an additive-dominance model of inheritance in which alleles decreasing blood pressure were partially dominant. Thus, in offspring derived from crosses between spontaneously hypertensive rats and Wistar-Kyoto rats or spontaneously hypertensive rats and Lewis rats that are raised under ordinary laboratory conditions, increased blood pressure is not determined by simple additive effects of alleles at a single major locus. The current findings are consistent with the possibility that in the spontaneously hypertensive rat, hypertension may arise from mutations in alleles that ordinarily act in a dominant fashion to suppress blood pressure.\r"

Because of this, all the other pressure control mechanisms, none of which has ever been shown to have a similar infinite gain property, must themselves alter the kidney-fluid mechanism if they are to succeed in causing long-term changes in the arterial pressure. We have not been able to refute this principle despite many experiments over the last 2 decades. For this reason, our first understanding of the infinite gain property of the kidney-fluid mechanism was like a light at the end of the tunnel. I hope that I can explain to the reader the excitement of those few seconds when we first recognized the principle in 1966.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies suggested that although rats that were passively sensitized [monoclonal murine immunoglobulin E (IgE)] would respond to pulmonary antigen challenge with an immediate increase in resistance, they exhibited no late increases in resistance, unlike late changes in rats actively sensitized to preferentially produce IgE antibody. We hypothesized that passively sensitized rats also would not develop antigen-induced pulmonary inflammation. In a blinded protocol we compared immediate responses and pulmonary resistance and inflammation at 8, 19 and 24 h after challenge with placebo antigen, with dinitrophenol-bovine serum albumin (DNP-BSA) to elicit a passively sensitized response, or with ovalbumin (OA) to elicit an actively sensitized response. Despite similar immediate responses to OA and DNP-BSA, only the rats challenged with OA had marked inflammatory changes and a significant incidence of late elevations in resistance. Inflammation scores and lung resistance were significantly correlated only in the OA group. We also observed that anesthesia with fentanyl/droperidol significantly attenuated the immediate but not the late responses to antigen challenge, compared with rats anesthetized with ketamine. We conclude that IgE-mediated immediate responses to pulmonary antigen challenge are insufficient, and may be unnecessary, to initiate antigen-induced late inflammatory changes.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic unilateral pulmonary arterial ligation has been touted as a model of arteriopathy resulting in a tremendous increase in anastomotic bronchial flow (Qbr) via collaterals. To investigate its effects on the pulmonary vasculature, we ligated the left main pulmonary artery of seven dogs and 120 days later pump perfused their left lower lobes (LLL) via a cannula in the pulmonary artery at pulmonary arterial flow (Qpa) of 250 ml/min. We measured Qbr (330 ml/min) and compared LLL with control contralateral right lower lobes (RLL) and three LLL from normal dogs. Pressure-flow (P-Q) curves were obtained by varying Qpa. With arterial and venous occlusion we measured total, arterial, venous, and middle segment resistances under baseline conditions, after serotonin and histamine, either with or without Qpa and with antegrade and retrograde Qbr. Light microscopy was done postmortem. The slope of the P-Q curve was 33.4 mmHg.l-1.min in the ligated lobes compared with 15.9 in the controls, attributable by the occlusion technique mainly to a rise in arterial resistance (22.4 mmHg.l-1.min compared with 7.4 in the controls) with a small rise in venous resistance. This was explained by significant arterial medial muscle thickening and some loss of LLL volume. The arterial segment was markedly hypersensitive to serotonin, and the venous segment was mildly hypersensitive to histamine compared with controls. The occlusion data also enabled us to model the point of entry of the bronchial circulation into the pulmonary circuit at the precapillary level and to calculate bronchial vascular resistance. We conclude that postobstructive vasculopathy substantially raises pulmonary vascular resistance, mainly upstream from the site of entry of the bronchial circulation. The role of the latter may be to keep it from rising excessively in the segments it perfuses, i.e., the middle and venous ones.\r"

We examined the effects of linear elastic loads (0.2-80 g/cm) on the active changes in porcine trachealis muscle length and tension in response to electrical field stimulation in vitro. Increasing elastic loads produced an exponential decrease in the shortening and velocity of shortening while causing an increase in tension generation of muscle strips stimulated by electrical field stimulation. Shortening was decreased by 50% at a load of 8 g/cm. At small elastic loads (less than or equal to 1 g/cm) contractile responses approximated isotonic responses (shortening approximately 60% of starting length), whereas at large loads (20 g/cm) responses approximated isometric responses with minimal shortening (20%). We conclude that elastic loading significantly alters the mechanical properties of airway smooth muscle in vitro, effects that are likely relevant to the loads against which the smooth muscle must contract in vivo.\r"

The rate of O2 consumption, 2.6 l/min (1.8-3.3) (average from cool and hot conditions), corresponded to 55-77% of their individual maximums. In the cool environment a steady state was reached at 30 min. When the subjects were shifted to the hot room, the core temperature and heart rate started to rise and reached values greater than 39 degrees C and near-maximal values, respectively, at the termination of the exercise. The leg blood flow (thermodilution method), femoral arteriovenous O2 difference, and consequently leg O2 consumption were unchanged in the hot compared with the cool condition. There was no increase in release of lactate and no reduction in glucose and free net fatty acid uptake in the exercising leg in the heat. Furthermore, the rate of glycogen utilization in the gastrocnemius muscle was not elevated in the hot environment. There was a tendency for cardiac output to increase in the heat (mean 15.2 to 18.4 l/min), which may have contributed to the increase in skin circulation, together with a possible further reduction in flow to other vascular beds, because muscle blood flow was not reduced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The experiments were performed in eight anesthetized dogs with balloon catheters in the esophagus and in the left and right pericardial and overlying pleural cavities and with an open-ended liquid-filled catheter in the pleural cavity. Bilateral PEEP (10, 20, and 30 cmH2O) caused progressive and similar increments in left and right pleural pressure. Selective PEEP, however, increased ipsilateral pleural balloon pressure more than contralateral pressure. The increase in ipsilateral pleural balloon pressure markedly exceeded the increase in esophageal pressure. There was a small increase in pleural open-ended catheter pressure that approximated the increase in esophageal pressure. During selective PEEP, pericardial balloon pressure remained uniform because of a decrease in ipsilateral pericardial transmural pressure. In conclusion, selective PEEP caused nonuniform increments in regional pleural balloon pressure. Left and right pericardial balloon pressure, however, increased uniformly with selective PEEP because of reduced ipsilateral pericardial transmural pressure. The esophageal balloon did not reflect the marked regional increments in pleural balloon pressure with selective PEEP and consistently underestimated the changes in pleural balloon pressure with general PEEP.\r"

This investigation was undertaken to further evaluate this response in type IIa and IIb fibers, determined by histochemical staining for myofibrillar adenosinetriphosphatase with alkaline and acid preincubation. Steroid [cortisol acetate (CA), 100 mg/kg body wt] and exercise (running 90 min/day, 29 m/min) treatments were initiated simultaneously for 11 consecutive days in female rats. Fiber distribution and area measurements were performed in a deep and superficial region of plantaris muscle. The exercise regimen spared approximately 40% of the CA-induced plantaris muscle atrophy. In the deep region, the fiber population, which contained approximately 13% type I (slow-twitch), 24% type IIa, and 63% IIb fibers, was not affected by either treatment. In the superficial section, which consisted solely of type II fibers, the proportion of type IIa fibers was higher (27 vs. 9%, P less than 0.01) in the steroid- than in the vehicle-treated groups. Within each region, type IIa fibers were less susceptible to atrophy than type IIb fibers, and within each fiber type, the deep region had less atrophy than the superficial region. Type I fibers were unchanged by steroid treatment. For type IIa fibers, exercise prevented 100% of the atrophy in the deep region and 50% in the superficial region. For type IIb fibers, the activity spared 67 and 40% of the atrophy in these same regions, respectively. These results show that glucocorticoids are capable of changing the myosin phenotype.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We used the micropuncture technique to measure venular pressures in some lungs and perivenular interstitial pressures in other lungs. For all lungs, we first measured venular or interstitial pressures at a constant airway pressure of 5 or 15 cmH2O with left atrial pressure greater than airway pressure (zone 3). For most lungs, we continued to measure venular or interstitial pressures as we lowered left atrial pressure below airway pressure (zone 2). Next, we inflated some lungs to whichever airway pressure had not been previously used, either 5 or 15 cmH2O, and repeated venular or interstitial pressures under one or both zonal conditions. We found that at constant blood flow a reduction of left atrial pressure below airway pressure always resulted in a reduction in venular pressure at both 5 and 15 cmH2O airway pressures. This suggests that the site of flow limitation in zone 2 was located upstream of venules. When left atrial pressure was constant relative to airway pressure, the transvascular gradient (venular-interstitial pressures) was greater at 15 cmH2O airway pressure than at 5 cmH2O airway pressure. These findings suggest that in newborn lungs edema formation would increase at high airway pressures only if left atrial pressure is elevated above airway pressure to maintain zone 3 conditions.\r"

Vascular flow capacity was estimated by measuring total hindquarters and regional muscle blood flows (under conditions of maximal vasodilation with papaverine or papaverine plus isoproterenol) over a wide range of perfusion pressures in WKY and SHR. Capillary exchange capacity was estimated by determining the capillary filtration coefficient. Isogravimetric capillary pressures and segmental vascular resistances were determined in each hindquarter. Isogravimetric flows and capillary pressures were not different between WKY and SHR. However, total and precapillary vascular resistances were significantly elevated in SHR, and postcapillary resistances were not different compared with WKY. Maximal capillary filtration coefficient values for the SHR group averaged 20% lower than WKY values, suggesting that hypertension was associated with a reduction in the microvascular surface area available for fluid exchange and, therefore, the capillary exchange capacity. Over the perfusion pressures studied, total hindquarters flows averaged 60% lower in SHR than in WKY. Flows to individual skeletal muscles averaged 76% lower in SHR than in WKY regardless of the muscle fiber type. Thus, modifications exist in the hindlimb skeletal muscle vasculature of SHR that reduces the capillary exchange capacity and limit the capacity of deliver flow at a given perfusion pressure gradient.\r"

Hildebrandt, J. Appl. Physiol. 28: 365-372, 1970). This behavior is inconsistent with linear viscoelasticity and has been interpreted in terms of plastoelasticity. We have reinvestigated this phenomenon in isolated lungs from 12 Wistar rats by measuring 1) the changes in Ptp after 0.5-ml step volume changes (initial Ptp of 5 cmH2O) and 2) their response to sinusoidal pressure forcing from 0.01 to 0.67 Hz (2 cmH2O peak to peak, mean Ptp of 6 cmH2O). Stress adaptation curves were found to fit approximately Hildebrandt's logarithmic model [delta Ptp/delta V = A - B.log(t)] from 0.2 to 100 s, where delta V is the step volume change, A and B are coefficients, and t is time. A and B averaged 1.06 +/- 0.11 and 0.173 +/- 0.019 cmH2O/ml, respectively, with minor differences between stress relaxation and stress recovery curves. The response to sinusoidal forcing was characterized by the effective resistance (Re) and elastance (EL). Re decreased from 2.48 +/- 0.41 cmH2O.ml-1.s at 0.01 Hz to 0.18 +/- 0.03 cmH2O.ml-1.s at 0.5 Hz, and EL increased from 0.99 +/- 0.10 to 1.26 +/- 0.20 cmH2O/ml on the same frequency range. These data were analyzed with the frequency-domain version of the same model, complemented by a Newtonian resistance (R) to account for airway resistance: Re = R + B/ (9.2f) and EL = A + 0.25B + B . log 2 pi f, where f is the frequency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Body surface heating was performed with an infrared lamp to raise arterial blood temperature (Tb) at the rate of approximately 0.1 degree C/min. Before heating, central venous pressure (CVP) was significantly higher in HBV (0.41 +/- 0.25 mmHg) and lower in LBV (-1.44 +/- 0.22 mmHg) than in NBV (-0.41 +/- 0.10 mmHg). The Tb at which CVP started to decrease was approximately 40 degrees C in HBV, approximately 41 degrees C in NBV, and approximately 42 degrees C in LBV, and it decreased by 1.53 +/- 0.14, 1.92 +/- 0.24, and 0.62 +/- 0.14 mmHg from 37 to 43 degrees C of Tb in HBV, NBV, and LBV, respectively. Stroke volume was closely correlated with CVP, and this relationship was not affected by Tb. Heart rate responses to the raised Tb were similar among the three groups. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was not affected by blood volume modification or CVP and was maintained at preheating (Tb 37 degrees C) level until Tb rose to 40 degrees C. Above this Tb, MAP increased until Tb reached 43 degrees C (+30-40 mmHg) for all three groups. Total peripheral resistance (TPR) was inversely correlated with CVP, and the slope of the linear relationship between TPR and CVP in LBV was three- to fourfold steeper than in NBV or HBV.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Whole muscles and muscle fiber bundles (less than or equal to 25 fibers) dissected from frog sartorius and semitendinosus muscles were mounted at optimal length in a normal Ringer solution (NR). To determine PTP, isometric twitches were evoked every 10 s (0.1 Hz) before and after a 2.5-s tetanic contraction (80 Hz). To antagonize calcium influx, low-calcium Ringer [LCR, calcium replaced by 3 mM magnesium and 1 mM ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid], NR plus diltiazem (Dilt, 30 microM), NR plus nifedipine (Nif, 10 microM), and NR plus D 600 (30 microM) were also used (n = 8 for each condition). These conditions altered pretetanic twitch tension by only -1.2 +/- 2.4, 4.2 +/- 2.3, 4.7 +/- 3.7, and 1.6 +/- 3.7% (SE), (LCR, Dilt, Nif, and D 600, P greater than 0.05) but caused a noticeable decrease in tension at the end of the tetanus. Under NR conditions, twitches evoked immediately after the tetanus were potentiated by 49.5 +/- 0.4% with the peak rate of tension development (dP/dt) increased by 44.9 +/- 0.5% (P less than 0.05). Antagonizing calcium influx depressed the PTP response by 59.8 +/- 6.2, 55.9 +/- 10.1, 73.2 +/- 6.8, and 29.8 +/- 3.6% (P less than 0.05) and increased dP/dt by 65.8 +/- 11.1, 45.7 +/- 8.6, 55.6 +/- 4.4% and 49.0 +/- 10.5% (P less than 0.05).

End-expiratory gastric pressure did increase with NLX, implying that increased abdominal muscle activity may have accounted for the NLX effect. In the current study we directly tested the hypothesis that endogenous opioid elaboration depresses the abdominal muscle response to a continuous inspiratory flow-resistive load. In seven unanesthetized goats, VT, arterial blood gases, EMGdi, and EMG activity of external oblique (EMGeo), transversus abdominis (EMGta), and external intercostal (EMGei) muscles were monitored. IRL (50 cmH2O.l-1.s) was continued for 3 h, after which NLX (0.1 mg/kg) or saline was given. Our results showed that VT decreased from 323 +/- 32 (SE) ml at baseline to 260 +/- 16 ml 5 min after the load was imposed (P less than 0.05) and further decreased to 229 +/- 18 and 217 +/- 15 ml by 120 and 180 min, respectively (180 vs. 5 min, P less than 0.05).

In one group of experiments, we examined the effect of H2O2 on the uptake and transport of cationized ferritin (CF) by endothelial cells in intra-acinar arteries, alveolar capillaries, and interlobular veins. The influence of the oxidant on endothelial adsorptive endocytic processes was assessed by measuring the density of ferritin particles in luminal vesicles, multivesicular bodies, and basal lamina. In a second group of experiments, we examined the effects of H2O2 on the fine structure and permeability to electron-dense macromolecules of arterial, microvascular, and venous endothelium. For this purpose, at the end of the 60-min perfusion with H2O2, CF was perfused to identify leaky vessels. We found that H2O2 caused a dose-dependent inhibition of transcytosis of CF in all vascular segments. At the lower dose of H2O2, inhibition of transcytotic activity was not associated with structural injury to the vascular endothelium or with elevation of wet-to-dry ratios. At the higher oxidant dose, inhibition of transcytosis was associated with leaky arterial endothelium and elevation of wet-to-dry ratios (6.44 +/- 0.12 vs. 5.64 +/- 0.16, P less than 0.02). The effects of H2)2 were prevented by adding catalase to the perfusate. The selective loss of structural integrity and leakiness of the arterial endothelium were diminished but not completely abolished by perfusing the oxidant retrograde from the venous side.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In additional sheep, three tracheal mucosal temperatures were measured during humid and dry gas mechanical ventilation to measure airway tissue cooling. Tracheal blood flow was determined by use of a left atrial injection of 15-microns-diam radiolabeled microspheres. Previously implanted flow probes on the pulmonary artery and the common bronchial artery allowed continuous recording of cardiac output and bronchial blood flow. Tracheal blood flow in awake spontaneously breathing sheep was 10.8 +/- 5.6 (SD) ml.min-1.100 g wet wt-1 while humid gas was breathed, and it was unchanged with dry gas. In contrast, isocapnic ventilation of intubated animals with dry gas resulted in a 10-fold increase in blood flow to the most proximal two-ring tracheal segment compared with that seen while humid gases were spontaneously ventilated [101 +/- 75 vs. 11 +/- 6 (SD) ml.min-1.100 g-1, P less than 0.05].

Performance was examined under three conditions that were designed progressively to remove the reliability of cues that a subject might use to duplicate a specific lung volume. As judged by the mean errors (disregarding the sign of the error) and constant errors (including the sign of the error), there were no significant differences in the accuracy with which subjects reproduced a standard volume, even when they were required to perform the reproductions at various inspiratory rates and starting volumes. The best performance was in the final experimental session in which the mean error for the group, all conditions combined, was 133 ml. There was a difference between conditions on the just-noticeable differences (a measure of variability including the sign of the error); subject performance was significantly more variable when the inspiratory flow rate was altered. The group mean error for the final session for just-noticeable differences was 93.3 ml. Our results indicate that a specific lung volume can be achieved using cues other than those associated with the movement made to attain that lung volume. The specific afferents that provided these cues are not known, but we propose that they uniquely signal static position.\r"

It is not known whether regional vasomotor responses follow the same pattern. To answer this question, in five men we examined cutaneous vascular responses to dynamic and isometric exercise of two legs, one leg, one arm, and one hand, each at high and low work loads. Skin blood flow was monitored by laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF) at the forearm. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was measured each minute. Cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC) was indexed as LDF/MAP. Reductions in CVC during the 1st min of dynamic exercise were statistically significant for two-leg exercise at either level and for one-leg exercise at the higher level. Dynamic exercise of smaller muscle groups at either intensity was not associated with significant changes in CVC. The reduction in CVC correlated with external work load (r = 0.75). Work load relative to the capacity of a given muscle group had no identifiable role in the response of CVC to dynamic exercise but did have a role in the increase in MAP at the beginning of exercise. Isometric exercise did not have a measurable effect on CVC regardless of the muscle group or the intensity of the exercise. We conclude that the level of external work determines the redistribution of blood flow from skin to active muscle. Furthermore, absolute rather than relative work and dynamic rather than isometric modes of exercise are the dominant factors.\r"

Dogs were anesthetized, intubated, and mechanically ventilated. After a stable baseline Rcs was obtained, responses to intravenous ACh (25-200 micrograms), intravenous MCh (3-30 micrograms), and aerosolized ACh (30-100 micrograms/ml for 15 s) were measured. We compared the Rcs responses with 1) ACh alone, 2) ACh 2 min after SCh (0.5 mg/kg), 3) ACh 2 min after SCh and during hexamethonium infusion (5 mg/kg + 10 mg.kg-1.h-1), 4) MCh 2 min after SCh, and 5) ACh aerosol 2 min after SCh. SCh did not significantly alter baseline airway tone. SCh increased the Rcs response to ACh by 48 +/- 17% (SE) (P less than 0.01). SCh in the presence of hexamethonium increased the Rcs response by 10 +/- 3% (P less than 0.05), while hexamethonium itself increased the response to ACh by 69 +/- 27%. Because SCh did not increase the Rcs response to intravenous MCh or to aerosolized ACh, SCh probably enhances airway reactivity to intravenous ACh by competing for pseudocholinesterase in plasma. We conclude that the level of muscle relaxant must be taken into account in interpreting studies of airway reactivity when intravenous ACh is employed.\r"

Measurements of pulmonary mechanics indicated a decrease in dynamic compliance within 5 min of injury and a decrease in lung volume that was disproportionately large at low pressures, consistent with diminished surfactant activity in vivo. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained 1 h after injury had significantly increased erythrocytes and total leukocytes, largely polymorphonuclear cells. The phospholipid content and composition of the cell-free fraction had only minor changes from those of controls, but the protein content was increased 35-fold. Measurements of lavage surface activity in vitro showed an increase in average minimum surface tension from 1.3 +/- 0.4 (SE) dyn/cm in controls to 20.2 +/- 3.9 dyn/cm in injured animals. The alterations in static pressure-volume curves and decrease in lavage surface activity suggest a severe alteration of surfactant function in this form of lung injury that occurs despite the presence of normal amounts of surfactant phospholipids.\r"

To address this issue, the activity of an oxidative [succinic dehydrogenase (SDH)] and a glycolytic [alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (GPD)] marker enzyme, the characteristics of myosin adenosinetriphosphatase (myosin ATPase, alkaline preincubation), and the cross-sectional area of single fibers were studied. The soleus and medial gastrocnemius of normal adult cats were compared with cats that 6 mo earlier had been spinally transected at T12-T13 at 2 wk of age. In control cats, SDH activity was higher in dark than light ATPase fibers in the soleus and higher in light than dark ATPase fibers in the medial gastrocnemius. After transection, SDH activity was similar to control in both muscles. GPD activity appeared to be elevated in some fibers in each fiber type in both muscles after transection. The cross-sectional areas most affected by spinal transection were light ATPase fibers of the soleus and dark ATPase fibers of the medial gastrocnemius, the predominant fiber type in each muscle. These data demonstrate that although the muscle fibers of cats spinalized at 2 wk of age presumably were never exposed to normal levels of activation, the activity of an oxidative marker enzyme was maintained or elevated 6 mo after spinal transection. Furthermore, although the absolute enzyme activities in some fibers were elevated by transection, three functional protein systems commonly associated with fiber types, i.e., hydrolysis of ATP by myosin ATPase and glycolytic (GPD) and oxidative (SHD) metabolism, developed in a coordinated manner typical of normal adult muscles.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of measuring with 31P nuclear magnetic resonance the effects of an endurance training program on the high-energy phosphate metabolism of exercising human skeletal muscle. The system used included a 1.9-T 30-cm-bore Oxford Systems superconducting magnet, a PhosphoEnergetics spectrometer, and a modified Cybex isokinetic ergometer. Seven healthy human volunteers exercised their wrist flexor muscles 20 min/day 5 days/wk for 8 wk. Testing before and after the training period consisted of a performance test to measure muscle functional capacity and a ramp test to measure the work-energy cost relationship of the exercising muscles. The results indicate that the subjects had a significant increase in their work output on the 10-min performance test after training. They also exhibited an increase in the work-energy cost relationship on the ramp test as indicated by a decrease in peak Pi-to-phosphocreatine ratio and an increase in pH at the same relative power output after training. These results indicate that 1) the training program was sufficient to elicit a training effect and 2) this effect was observed with 31P nuclear magnetic resonance as an increased potential for oxidative metabolism, particularly at the high exercise levels.\r"

In the model, a systematically quantified impulse of training produces dual responses: fitness and fatigue. In the absence of training, both decay exponentially with time. With repetitive training, these responses satisfy individual recurrence equations. Fitness and fatigue are combined in a simple linear difference equation to predict performance levels appropriate to the intensity of training being undertaken. Significant observed correlation of model-predicted performance with a measure of actual performance during both training and tapering provides validation of the model for athletes and nonathletes alike. This enables specific model parameters to be estimated and can be used to optimize future training regimens for any individual.\r"

In this study, we determined the contribution of lung edema and increased blood volume to the weight gain in rats. Three weeks after pneumonectomy (n = 18) or sham pneumonectomy (n = 17), the pulmonary blood volume and the extravascular water and albumin were evaluated by use of 51Cr-labeled erythrocytes and 125I-labeled albumin. The air space volume, blood-free lung weights, and DNA and protein content were also compared. The data show that the total pulmonary blood volumes and the blood volume per gram of blood-free dry lung were similar in pneumonectomized and age-matched sham controls. The total extravascular albumin and the extravascular albumin per gram of blood-free dry lung were also similar as well as the extravascular lung water, wet-to-dry weight ratios, DNA and protein content, and air space volumes. These data indicate that the increased weight of the postpneumonectomy lung was due to cellular and stromal proliferation. The blood volume and interstitial fluid increased in proportion to the increase in lung parenchyma. Neither vascular congestion nor increased extravascular protein and water contributed to the observed weight gain.\r"

There are a number of such examples in vertebrate and invertebrate systems. In this review, we present some of the newer methods that have been used in the identification of membrane properties and detail some cellular studies performed in both vertebrate (locomotion and sleep/waking rhythms) and invertebrate network systems (escape swimming in Tritonia diomedia and pyloric rhythm in Panulirus interruptus). Studies examining the cellular or membrane properties of respiratory neurons have been scarce until recently. The importance of these properties in dictating respiratory rhythm generation and output in the mature and immature animal is not yet known; however, we put this issue in perspective by building a parallel between mammalian respiration and other vertebrate networks that have been better investigated and characterized.\r"

Criteria for enrollment included an arterial PO2-to-inspired O2 concentration ratio less than or equal to 200 in a clinical setting consistent with ARDS. Patients were excluded if they were less than 18 yr old, had clinical manifestations of congestive heart failure, were seropositive for the human immunodeficiency virus, or had stage II metastatic lung cancer. Patients were divided into two groups: those less than 60 yr old (mean 42 +/- 3 yr, n = 17) and those greater than or equal to 60 yr old (73 +/- 2 yr, n = 16). A group of six patients was analyzed as a separate subset based on a body temperature less than or equal to 97.5 degrees F at enrollment (hypothermic patients, 73 +/- 4 yr old). Sepsis was present in 67% of the nonhypothermic patients and in all the hypothermic patients. Mortality rates were 12% in the patients less than 60 yr and 69% in the nonhypothermic patients greater than or equal to 60 yr. All the hypothermic patients died. Sequential data obtained over 6 days were compared within and between groups. The following results were obtained. 1) The ratio of arterial PO2 to inspired O2 fraction was greater and the positive end-expiratory pressure used was significantly less in the patients greater than or equal to 60 yr old compared with the younger group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

O2 uptake (VO2) was measured in isolated in situ canine gastrocnemius (n = 12) working maximally (isometric twitch contractions at 5 Hz for 3 min). The muscles were pump perfused at identical blood flow, arterial PO2 (PaO2) and total hemoglobin concentration [( Hb]) with blood containing either 1% (control) or 30% HbCO. In both conditions PaO2 was set at 30 Torr, which produced the same arterial O2 contents, and muscle blood flow was set at 120 ml.100 g-1.min-1, so that O2 delivery in both conditions was the same. To minimize CO diffusion into the tissues, perfusion with HbCO-containing blood was limited to the time of the contraction period. VO2max was 8.8 +/- 0.6 (SE) ml.min-1.100 g-1 (n = 12) with hypoxemia alone and was reduced by 26% to 6.5 +/- 0.4 ml.min-1.100 g-1 when HbCO was present (n = 12; P less than 0.01). In both cases, mean muscle effluent venous PO2 (PVO2) was the same (16 +/- 1 Torr). Because PaO2 and PVO2 were the same for both conditions, the mean capillary PO2 (estimate of mean O2 driving pressure) was probably not much different for the two conditions, even though the O2 dissociation curve was shifted to the left by HbCO. Consequently the blood-to-mitochondria O2 diffusive conductance was likely reduced by HbCO.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In seven pentobarbital-anesthetized ventilated sheep, we cannulated and perfused the bronchial branch of the bronchoesophageal artery. Steady-state bronchial artery pressure- (Pba) flow (Qba) relationships were obtained as Pla was increased by inflating a balloon catheter in the left atrium. Bronchial vascular resistance (BVR), determined by the inverse slope of the Pba-Qba relationship, increased significantly from 3.2 +/- 0.3 (SE) mmHg.ml-1.min-1 at a Pla of 2.9 +/- 0.7 mmHg to 5.1 +/- 0.5 mmHg.ml-1.min-1 at a Pla of 20.1 +/- 2.0 mmHg (P = 0.0007). Under control Qba (23.3 +/- 1.2 ml/min), these changes in BVR represent a 3.6 +/- 0.7-mmHg increase in Pba per mmHg increase in Pla. The zero-flow pressure increased 1.3 +/- 0.2 mmHg/mmHg increase in Pla. After infusion of papaverine, a smooth muscle paralytic agent, directly into the bronchial artery, BVR decreased significantly to 1.3 +/- 0.7 mmHg.ml-1.min-1 (P = 0.0004). Under these dilated conditions, BVR was unaltered by increases in Pla. After papaverine administration, Pba increased 0.9 +/- 0.1 and 1.2 +/- 0.1 mmHg/mmHg increase in Pla during control and zero-flow conditions, respectively. Thus the effect of Pla elevation on BVR appears to be dependent on active smooth muscle responses. Paw elevation had similar effects on Pba. Under control Qba, Pba increased 2.2 +/- 0.4 mmHg/mmHg increase in Paw.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The hypothesis of the present study was that chronic beta-GPA feeding would increase cytochrome c mRNA in muscle and would decrease alpha-skeletal actin mRNA in type IIb muscle. Data collected supported, in part, the hypothesis. After 22 days of a 1% beta-GPA diet, cytochrome c mRNA was increased 60-67% in muscles with inherently low cytochrome c mRNA but was not altered in muscles with higher cytochrome c mRNA levels. alpha-Skeletal actin mRNA was unchanged in muscles with low and high cytochrome c mRNA after 22 days of 1% beta-GPA. After 66 days of beta-GPA feeding, both cytochrome c mRNA and alpha-skeletal actin mRNA were decreased 18 and 26%, respectively, per unit of total RNA, in white quadriceps muscle. At the same time muscles composed of predominantly type II fibers atrophied 22%, whereas type I muscle size was unaltered. These data suggest that high-energy phosphate levels could play some role in adaptive changes in muscle composition.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the interaction between airway smooth muscle shortening and airway wall thickening on changes in pulmonary resistance, we have developed a model of the tracheobronchial tree that allows simulation of the mechanisms involved in airway narrowing. The model is based on the symmetrical dichotomous branching tracheobronchial tree as described by Weibel and uses fluid dynamic equations proposed by Pedley et al. to calculate inspiratory resistance during quiet tidal breathing. To allow for changes in lung volume, we used the airway pressure-area curves developed by Lambert et al. The model is easily implemented with a spreadsheet and personal computer that allows calculation of total and regional pulmonary resistance. At each airway generation in the model, provision is made for airway wall thickness, the maximal airway smooth muscle shortening achievable, and an S-shaped dose-response relationship to describe smooth muscle shortening. To test the validity of the model, we compared pressure-flow curves generated with the model with measurements of pulmonary resistance while normal subjects breathed air and 20% O2-80% He at a variety of lung volumes. By simulating progressive airway smooth muscle shortening, realistic pulmonary resistance vs. dose-response curves were produced. We conclude that this model provides realistic estimates of pulmonary resistance and shows potential for examining the various mechanisms that could produce excessive airway narrowing in disease.\r"

Ablation operations of the gastrocnemius and plantaris muscles or the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles were done to induce hypertrophy of synergistic muscle left intact in female Wistar rats (n = 47) at 5 wk of age. The hypertrophied soleus and plantaris muscles and control muscles from other age-matched rats (n = 22) were studied from days 30 to 240 thereafter. Po was measured in vitro at 25 degrees C in oxygenated Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate. Compared with control values, soleus muscle cross-sectional area increased 41-15% from days 30 to 240 after ablation, whereas Po increased 11 and 15% only at days 60 and 90. Compared with control values, plantaris muscle cross-sectional area increased 52% at day 30, 40% from days 60 through 120, and 15% at day 240. Plantaris muscle Po increased 25% from days 30 to 120 but at day 240 was not different from control value. Changes in muscle architecture were negligible after ablation in both muscles. Specific Po was depressed from 11 to 28% for both muscles at all times. At no time after the ablation of synergistic muscle did the increased muscle cross-sectional area contribute fully to isometric force production.\r"

The purpose of this study was to examine the time course and mechanisms of methacholine tachyphylaxis in normal subjects and to determine whether this occurs in mildly asthmatic subjects. Fifteen normal and nine asthmatic subjects were studied on 2 study days, at least 48 h apart. Each day, two inhalation tests were carried out. On one day, subjects performed two methacholine inhalation tests 3 h later by a methacholine test. Results were expressed as the provocation concentration causing a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), (PC20). All normal subjects developed methacholine tachyphylaxis. The mean PC20 increased from 47.3 mg/ml (%SE 1.34) to 115.6 (%SE 1.51) (P less than 0.0001) in a 3-h interval. This increase lasted for greater than or equal to 6 h (P = 0.012). Asthmatic subjects did not develop methacholine tachyphylaxis. Their mean methacholine PC20s were 1.6 mg/ml (%SE 1.4) and 1.5 (%SE 1.4) (P = 0.75) 3 h later. In two other series of experiments, normal subjects were pretreated with the cyclooxygenase inhibitors indomethacin (100 mg/day) or flurbiprofen (150 mg/day) or a placebo for 3 days before two methacholine tests 3 h apart. Both indomethacin and flurbiprofen significantly inhibited the development of methacholine tachyphylaxis. These results confirm that methacholine tachyphylaxis occurs in normal subjects, lasts greater than or equal to 6 h, and may occur through the release of inhibitory prostaglandins. By contrast, methacholine tachyphylaxis does not occur in asthmatic subjects.\r"

In this study, two thromboxane receptor antagonists, L-655,240 and L-670,596, were used in doses that inhibit the response to an inhaled thromboxane mimetic, U-46619, to determine further the role of thromboxane in ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness. Dogs were studied on 2 days separated by 1 wk. On each day, the dogs inhaled ozone (3 ppm) for 30 min. On one randomly assigned day, 10 dogs received an infusion of L-655,240 (5 mg.kg-1.h-1) and 5 dogs received an infusion of L-670,596 (1 mg.kg-1.h-1); on the other day dogs received a control infusion. Airway responses to doubling doses of acetylcholine were measured before and after inhalation of ozone and were expressed as the concentration of acetylcholine giving a rise in resistance of 5 cmH2O.l-1.s from baseline (acetylcholine provocation concentration). The development of airway hyperresponsiveness after ozone was not inhibited by the thromboxane antagonists. The mean log difference in the acetylcholine provocative concentration before and after ozone on the L-655,240 treatment day was 0.62 +/- 0.12 (SE) and on the control day was 0.71 +/- 0.12 (P = 0.48); on the L-670,596 treatment day the mean log difference was 0.68 +/- 0.15 (SE) and on the control day it was 0.75 +/- 0.19 (P = 0.45).

TBW was overestimated by both 2HHO and 3HHO dilution; mean overestimates were 2.8 +/- 0.9% (SE) with 2H and 4.0 +/- 0.6% with 3H. The relationships for prediction of total body fat (TBF), protein (TBP), gross energy (TBGE), and ash (TBA) were as follows: %TBF = 105.1 - 1.47 (%TBW); %TBP = 0.42 (%TBW) - 4.75; TBGE (MJ) = 40.8 (mass in kg) - 48.5 (TBW in kg) - 0.4; and TBA (kg) = 0.1 - 0.008 (mass in kg) + 0.05 (TBW in kg). These relationships are applicable to gray seals of both sexes over a wide range of age and body conditions, and they predict the body composition of gray seals more accurately than the predictive equations derived from ringed seals (Pusa hispida) (Stirling et al., Can. J. Zool. 53: 1021-1027, 1975) and from the equation of Pace and Rathbun (J. Biol. Chem. 158: 685-691, 1945), which has been reported to be generally applicable to mammals.\r"

We examined the functional and structural effects of continuous low-frequency diaphragm pacing on the left hemidiaphragm of five immature dogs aged 65 +/- 2 (SD) days at onset of pacing. Stimulus parameters approximated those required to pace infants: frequency 11.1 Hz, inspiratory time 810 ms, and respiratory rate 20 breaths/min. Animals were paced 24 h/day for 24-28 days. Paced tidal volumes and airway occlusion pressures were unchanged at low (less than 15 Hz) stimulus frequencies but were reduced at high (greater than 20 Hz) stimulus frequencies. Although histologically the paced hemidiaphragms appeared normal, histochemical studies showed a conversion from a mixture of type I (54%) and type II (46%) fibers to a uniform population of type I fibers with high oxidative enzyme activity. Transformation of muscle type was also demonstrated by pyrophosphate gel electrophoresis; fast and slow isomyosin bands were noted in control specimens, whereas only slow isomyosin was identified in paced specimens. Thus, in immature dogs, continuous low-frequency pacing affects both function and structure of the diaphragm.\r"

  ".W": "Myoglobin (Mb) content and citrate synthase (CS) activity were determined in myocardial samples from nine human brain-dead organ donors with normal hearts. Six regions of each heart were analyzed: right and left atria, right ventricle, left ventricular subepicardium, subendocardium, and anterior papillary muscle. The Mb content was similar, whereas the CS activity was higher in the left than in the right heart at both atrial and ventricular levels. Mb content and CS activity were higher in ventricles than in atria. The subendocardial layer and papillary muscle of the left ventricle had a higher Mb content than the subepicardial layer, whereas CS activity was similar in these three locations. The results suggested a closer relationship between CS activity (oxidative potential) and work load than between Mb content and work load. Mb content may, instead, be related to intramuscular oxygen tension (PO2) on the basis of a comparison between our Mb data and those of others on regional variations in myocardial PO2.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the protective role of the synovial sheath of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), we have developed a synovectomy model that exposes the ACL substance to the intra-articular environment with and without hemarthrosis. Histology and the level of collagenase activity were studied to assess intrinsic ligament alterations. The treatment groups studied were as follows: ACLs of sham-operated knees receiving arthrotomy only, ACLs of knees receiving arthrotomy and acute hemarthrosis, ACLs of knees that underwent synovectomy, and ACLs of knees that underwent both synovectomy and acute hemarthrosis. All animals were killed 10 days postoperatively for gross, histological, and biochemical assessment. Histologically at 10 days ACLs experiencing synovectomy and ACLs having synovectomy plus hemarthrosis revealed marked hypocellular areas. Biochemical results indicate that synovectomy is the treatment mainly responsible for the observed increase in ACL collagenase activity. Hemarthrosis alone clearly had no effect, although hemarthrosis coupled with synovectomy appeared to further increase the amount of active collagenase present in the ACLs. This study indicates that, with exposure of the ACL substance to the synovial fluid or with hemarthrosis after synovectomy, there is an increase in the degradative activity of the ACL. The protective role of the synovial sheath suggests that the synovial sheath injury associated with acute ACL rupture may allow for exposure of the ligament substance to the degradative effects of the synovial environment and associated hemarthrosis.\r"

  ".W": "The dose-response relationship for decompression magnitude and venous gas emboli (VGE) formation in humans was examined. Pressure exposures of 138, 150, and 164 kPa (12, 16, and 20.5 ft of seawater gauge pressure) were conducted in an underwater habitat for 48 h. The 111 human male volunteer subjects then ascended directly to the surface in less than 5 min and were monitored for VGE with a continuous-wave Doppler ultrasound device over the precordium or the subclavian veins at regular intervals for a 24-h period. No signs or symptoms consistent with decompression sickness occurred. However, a large incidence of VGE detection was noted. These data were combined with those from our previously reported experiments at higher pressures, and the data were fit to a Hill dose-response equation with nonlinear least-squares or maximum likelihood routines. Highly significant fits of precordial VGE incidences were obtained with the Hill equation (saturation depth pressure at which there is a 50% probability of detectable VGE [D(VGE)50] = 150 +/- 1.2 kPa). Subclavian monitoring increased the sensitivity of VGE detection and resulted in a leftward shift [D(VGE)50 = 135 +/- 2 kPa] of the best-fit curve. We conclude that the reduction in pressure necessary to produce bubbles in humans is much less than was previously thought; 50% of humans can be expected to generate endogenous bubbles after decompression from a steady-state pressure exposure of only 135 kPa (11 ft of seawater). This may have significant implications for decompression schedule formulation and for altitude exposures that are currently considered benign. These results also imply that endogenous bubbles arise from preexisting gas collections.\r"

The quadriceps femoris muscles of six subjects were intermittently stimulated at 15 and 50 Hz. The stimulation lasted 9.6 s and was performed twice at 15 Hz and once at 50 Hz. Epinephrine was infused continuously during the experiment. The force generation and ATP turnover rate were nearly twofold higher at 50 Hz than at 15 Hz. Calculated mean Pi was 5.7 and 10.0 mM during the two 15-Hz stimulations and 8.1 mM during the 50-Hz stimulation. Phosphorylase a varied between 85.5 and 91.5% without significant differences between periods. However, the rate of glycogenolysis was twofold higher during the stimulation at 50 Hz than it was at 15 Hz (P less than 0.05) and was related to the ATP turnover rate (r = 0.992). These results demonstrate that rapid glycogen breakdown during muscle contraction cannot be solely explained by transformation of phosphorylase b to a and increased Pi concentration. The contraction intensity may determine the glycogenolytic rate through a transient increase in free AMP level related to the ATP turnover rate.\r"

Simultaneous pericardial and intracavitary pressures were synchronized with superior vena caval and transvalvular pulsed-Doppler flow tracings. The earliest indication of tamponade was the development of a negative transmural right atrial pressure that occurred during early ventricular diastole and was associated with echocardiographic evidence of right atrial collapse. This was also associated with reversal of diastolic flow in the superior vena cava and with diminished early diastolic flow velocity across the tricuspid as well as the mitral valve. During more advanced cardiac tamponade, the transmural right atrial pressure became negative during both early and late ventricular diastole as well as during isovolumic ventricular systole. This was associated with a disappearance of early diastolic ventricular filling and right ventricular diastolic collapse as observed on two-dimensional echocardiography. In hypotensive cardiac tamponade (cardiac output diminished by 70%), the decreased transmural right atrial pressure that developed during ventricular systole was accompanied by diminished antegrade flow in the superior vena cava. In advanced and hypotensive tamponade, ventricular filling occurred mainly during atrial contraction.\r"

Single-breath constant-flow expirograms were simultaneously recorded in two conditions: 1) after equilibration of lung gas with the inert gases at tracer concentrations [airway loading (AL)] and 2) during steady-state elimination of the inert gases continuously introduced into venous blood by a membrane oxygenator and partial arteriovenous bypass [venous loading (VL)]. VD was consistently larger for SF6 than for He, but there was no difference between AL and VL. The relative alveolar slope, defined as increment of partial pressure per increment of expired volume and normalized to mixed expired-inspired partial pressure difference, was larger by a factor of two in VL than in AL for both He and SF6. The He-to-SF6 ratio of relative alveolar slope was generally smaller than unity in both VL and AL. Whereas unequal ventilation-volume distribution combined with sequential emptying of parallel lung regions appears to be responsible for the sloping alveolar plateau during AL, the steeper slope during VL is attributed to the combined effects of continuing gas exchange and ventilation-perfusion inequality coupled with sequential emptying. The differences between He and SF6 point at the contributing role of diffusion-dependent mechanisms in intrapulmonary gas mixing.\r"

To determine whether the two methods produce the same values of baroreceptor sensitivity, we administered intravenous PE by both bolus injection and graded infusion methods to 17 normal subjects. Baroreflex sensitivity was determined from the slope of the linear relationship between the cardiac cycle length (R-R interval) and systolic arterial pressure. Both methods produced similar peak increases in arterial pressure and reproducible results of baroreflex sensitivity in the same subjects, but baroreflex slopes measured by the infusion method (9.9 +/- 0.7 ms/mmHg) were significantly lower than those measured by the bolus method (22.5 +/- 1.8 ms/mmHg, P less than 0.0001). Pretreatment with atropine abolished the heart rate response to PE given by both methods, whereas plasma catecholamines were affected by neither method of PE administration. Naloxone pretreatment exaggerated the pressor response to PE and increased plasma beta-endorphin response to PE infusion but had no effect on baroreflex sensitivity. Thus our results indicate that 1) activation of the baroreflex by the PE bolus and infusion methods, although reproducible, is not equivalent, 2) baroreflex-induced heart rate response to a gradual increase in pressure is less than that seen with a rapid rise, 3) in both methods, heart rate response is mediated by the vagus nerves, and 4) neither the sympathetic nervous system nor the endogenous opiate system has a significant role in mediating the baroreflex control of heart rate to a hypertensive stimulus in normal subjects.\r"

Net phosphocreatine (PCr) hydrolysis was associated with an intracellular alkalinization of 0.08 +/- 0.01 and 0.05 +/- 0.003 pH units in isolated perfused cat biceps and soleus, respectively, and 0.12 +/- 0.02 in the superficial predominantly fast-twitch white portion of gastrocnemius of anesthetized rats. The net change in [H+] expected from PCr hydrolysis was calculated, and apparent buffer capacity (beta) in intact muscles was calculated from beta = delta [H+]/delta pH. The beta of the same muscle types was also estimated from titration of muscle homogenates between pH 6.0 and 8.0. The contribution of Pi to total beta of the homogenates was subtracted to ascertain the non-Pi beta for each muscle. The non-Pi beta values were added to the actual amount of Pi present in the stimulated muscles to calculate a predicted beta at pH 7. The apparent beta calculated from PCr and pH changes in intact muscles and the predicted beta from homogenate titrations were in good agreement (38 +/- 9 vs. 38 slykes in cat biceps, 21 +/- 7 vs. 30 in cat soleus, and 30 +/- 6 vs. 27 in rat gastrocnemius). The results indicate that changes in pH during the first few seconds of contraction can be entirely accounted for by proton consumption via net PCr hydrolysis.\r"

In this study we test the hypothesis that rate-independent plastic processes along with rate-dependent viscoelastic processes are responsible. We considered oscillatory responses of several respiratory tissues measured over prescribed ranges of frequency (up to 6 Hz) and amplitude of forcing. These included the excised cat lung, the human chest wall in vivo, and two components of the chest wall: the excised dog rib cage and the excised rabbit abdominal viscera; some data were previously reported and some are new. We analyzed these data using the viscoplastic model of Hildebrandt (J. Appl. Physiol. 28: 365-372, 1970). It consists of three compartments: a plastoelastic compartment mechanically in parallel with a viscoelastic compartment, both in series with a lumped inertia. We fitted oscillatory data of the above respiratory tissues to the model by a least-squares technique. The fit was qualitatively consistent with the observations and exhibited moderately good to very good quantitative correspondence. As an independent verification of this approach, we obtained the stress relaxation after a step-volume change. Based on the oscillatory response of cat lungs, the calculated stress relaxation function was found to be generally consistent with corresponding observations. This study indicates that both plasticity and viscoelasticity appear to be important determinants of mechanical behavior of respiratory tissues at low frequencies and that inertial effects are negligible.\r"

Glucose- (GF) and water-fed rats (WF) were pair matched and killed at rest, at 25 or 50% of their previously determined run time to exhaustion, or at exhaustion.

In GF rats, glucose was maintained at 7.4 +/- 0.5 mM for 3 h before dropping to 3.9 +/- 0.6 mM at exhaustion. In both groups, liver and muscle glycogen decreased dramatically during the 1st h and changed only slightly thereafter. During the 3rd h, glycogen levels were maintained in GF rats but continued to decrease in WF rats (P less than 0.05). Insulin decreased during exercise and was not significantly different between groups.

  ".W": "If airway smooth muscle shortened in vivo to the extent that it does in vitro, then maximal bronchoconstriction would result in complete closure of virtually all airways. The fact that this does not happen indicates the existence of inhibitory mechanisms preventing maximal muscle shortening. There are many factors potentially limiting shortening in vivo. In this study we investigated one of these factors, the orientation of the smooth muscle around the airway wall. The airway was modeled as a cylinder of given wall thickness around which the muscle was wound as a spiral. The longitudinal and circumferential elasticities of the airway were embodied in a 2 x 2 matrix of elastic coefficients. We investigated smooth muscle shortening under three conditions: 1) a longitudinally stiff airway, 2) a circumferentially stiff airway, and 3) a longitudinally and circumferentially compressible airway. In case 1, for a given degree of smooth muscle shortening, airway resistance increased markedly with increasing pitch of the smooth muscle spiral. On the other hand, the muscle tension required to elicit a given change in resistance also increased markedly with pitch. In case 2, the effect with increasing pitch was reversed. In case 3, resistance first increased and then decreased as spiral pitch increased. Similarly, the muscle tension required to elicit a given change in resistance first increased and then decreased with pitch. These results suggest that the orientation of the smooth muscle about the airway may be very important in determining airway responsiveness.\r"

Our clinical and radiological results indicate that a useful and stable articulation can be achieved in most cases, provided that continued deep infection can be avoided. The appearance of radiological sclerosis at the bearing site in successful cases seems to indicate that significant late migration will not occur. Based on our experience with the mark I prosthesis we have designed and developed a mark II model which has freedom of axial rotation of the saddle. Our early results in 40 cases show a significant improvement over the results which could have been predicted for the mark I device.\r"

  ".W": "The intra-osseous pressure, PO2, and PCO2 were measured in 32 hips (21 patients) which were painful but showed no severe degenerative changes. Pre-operative scintigraphy and radiography was performed in all patients. Thirteen hips showed early osteoarthritis, eight had early osteonecrosis, and 11 had no changes. Core biopsies were performed and the bone was examined histologically and graded for necrosis. Histologically, necrosis was present in 27 specimens. Scintigraphic findings did not correlate with the histological results but were more closely related to the radiographic findings. The intra-osseous pressure in hips with histological necrosis (mean 47 mmHg) was significantly higher than in hips without necrosis (mean 26 mmHg). The PO2 was lower in bone with histological necrosis (mean 44 mmHg) than in bone without (mean 71 mmHg). PO2 increased and intra-osseous pressure decreased after decompression. The results confirm that ischaemia plays a central role in the development of necrotic changes in bone. Histological necrosis was found in hips with radiographic signs of osteonecrosis and in those with osteoarthritis. Radiography, and scintigraphy are shown to be insensitive methods for differentiating between those disorders.\r"

Micro-angiograms showed that the allogeneic tendon was revascularised with infiltration of the mesenchymal cells from the surrounding tissues and both ends of the graft. Histologically, the alignment of the fibroblasts and collagen bundles became more regular over time, without any immunological rejection. A biomechanical study performed at 52 weeks found no significant difference in stiffness or ultimate load between normal and reconstructed ligaments. Fresh-frozen allogeneic tendons are therefore considered useful for extra-articular ligament reconstruction.\r"

Premature osteoarthritis was a frequent outcome and was almost inevitable before the age of 30 years in those with incongruent hips. There were two types of immature hips: type I, the more severe form, had a fragmented and flattened ossific nucleus and acetabular dysplasia, was misshapen at skeletal maturity and osteoarthritic by 30 years of age; the milder type II hip had a small, rounded, uniformly ossified nucleus and a more normal acetabulum. Type II hips were well formed at maturity and were less prone to premature osteoarthritis. Considerable variations were noted in the manifestations of MED between families but not within families. The prognosis of a child's hip could be predicted; in sporadic cases from the type of immature hip, and in familial cases by also taking into account the outcome of affected relatives.\r"

We have developed a modified rotationplasty for this lesion and have performed it in four children. The surgical technique, postoperative management and results of the procedure are described. Two patients had delayed wound healing. No other complications have developed and our patients were disease-free at follow-up, while the appearance of the leg was well accepted by the patients and their parents. This procedure is a useful addition to the armamentarium of the tumour surgeon for the treatment of malignant lesions of the proximal tibia.\r"

In three hips retrieved at post-mortem from two patients, we have been able to make a detailed biomechanical and histological analysis. The interval between arthroplasty and the appearance of focal osteolysis on clinical radiographs ranged from 40 to 168 months, and in over 70% of the cases this did not appear until after five or more years. Few had significant pain and there was no relation to age, sex or original diagnosis. The most common site for osteolysis were Gruen zones 2 and 3 on the anteroposterior radiograph and zones 5 and 6 on the lateral radiograph. In 15 cases (60%), the area of osteolysis corresponded to either a defect in the cement mantle or an area of very thin cement. The rate of progression of these lesions was variable, but to date only one has progressed to gross loosening of the femoral component. The back-scatter scanning electron microscopic examination of serial sections and biomechanical testing of the post-mortem specimens demonstrated focal cement fracture around implants that were otherwise rigidly fixed. In eight cases from which tissue was available, histology showed a histiocytic reaction with evidence of particulate polymethylmethacrylate. We consider that this local fragmentation was the stimulus for local osteolysis in an otherwise stable cemented femoral component.\r"

Macrophages that phagocytosed either particle became activated, and stimulated 15 times as much bone resorption as did control macrophages. For activation to occur, 100 times more latex than zymosan had to be phagocytosed. We also found that bone cement and polyethylene particles activated macrophages in a similar manner, and that the necessary amounts of these were intermediate between those of latex and zymosan. None of the particles were toxic. It was concluded that implant loosening may result from bone resorption stimulated by mediators released by macrophages that have phagocytosed particles of bone cement or polyethylene.\r"

Completely contained cups had significantly lower incidences of complete cement-bone radiolucency (p = 0.02) and of wear (p = 0.09). Vertically oriented cups had a lower incidence of continuous radiolucency than neutrally oriented cups, but this was not statistically significant (p = 0.25). Our results confirm the importance of complete bony containment, and also indicate that it is better to accept vertical orientation and obtain full bony coverage than to have a more horizontal orientation with partial containment.\r"

The clearance was 12 +/- 2 ml/min/kg, the half-life was 123 +/- 24 minutes, and the volume of distribution was 2.2 +/- 0.4 L/kg for the subjects with burns compared with 25 +/- 3 ml/min/kg, 89 +/- 18 minutes, and 3.2 +/- 0.8 L/kg for the control subjects (p less than 0.001, less than 0.02, and less than 0.02, respectively). These data contrast with the theory that patients with burns have a tolerance to narcotics and suggest the need for further study of the pharmacologic effects of burn injury and surgery.\r"

The principal role of B lymphocytes is immunoglobulin production. This study was designed to determine the effect of acute ethanol ingestion on circulating immunoglobulin levels before injury. Serum concentrations of IgG, IgM, and IgA in rats were measured with the use of radial immunodiffusion plates at 4 days after a 30% burn injury in animals that had received a single ingestion of 3.0 ml ethanol per kilogram of body weight. The immunoglobulin levels were compared with appropriate controls. A 30% burn injury produced significant decreases in serum IgG and IgA levels but not in IgM levels, whereas acute ethanol ingestion only decreased IgA levels. Acute ethanol ingestion before injury did not induce any further significant decrease than did burn injury alone.\r"

To scrutinize these methods, indirect calorimetry measurements were performed on 74 survivors of burns (greater than or equal to 40% total body surface area) and compared to their actual caloric intake, percent weight change, and optimal caloric requirements formulated from the Curreri and Shriners' equations. These parameters showed that in spite of an initial deficit in actual caloric intake as compared to formulated goals, weight was maintained, whereas resting energy expenditures ranged from 30% to 40% below the actual caloric intake. Furthermore, a subgroup of patients (n = 42) who met +/- 20% of their formulated needs were stratified by extent of burn; this illustrated a significant weight gain in the more severely burned children. In conclusion, nutritional formulas in popular use overestimate caloric requirements in severe burns, whereas resting energy expenditure measurements require an additional factor of 30% to maintain body weight.\r"

Cyclosporine A kinetic studies in patients with burns revealed markedly accelerated blood clearance and high variability in drug absorption when compared with studies in renal transplantation patients. Doses required to maintain therapeutic levels varied widely. While patients were receiving adequate maintenance therapy with CsA immunosuppression the allograft was tightly adherent without gross or microscopic rejection and was indistinguishable from autograft. Ultimately, patients' wounds were permanently covered with sequential autografts by recropping limited donor sites. There were not unusual septic complications, although prophylaxis for opportunistic infections was used. The disadvantage of allograft use is its early rejection and obligatory replacement until permanent coverage with autograft can be accomplished. Cyclosporine A can prolong allograft survival and allow autograft coverage from limited donor sites in a sequential fashion. This may lead to increased survival in patients with massive burns.\r"

  ".U": "91060667\r", 
  ".W": "A blood culture is an essential laboratory procedure necessary to confirm a septic episode. However, it is important to collect the blood sample at the appropriate time with an acceptable technique. The standard method is to collect at least 5 to 10 ml blood per culture bottle from patients with fevers. However, this volume of blood is an unrealistic amount to take from the frequently febrile pediatric patient. Alternatively, the pediatric blood culture bottle allows the collection of 1 ml blood per bottle to perform the same evaluation. We evaluated the two techniques of blood-culture collection over a 9-month period and compared the results between adult and pediatric blood culture bottles. Seventy-six patients, from November 1988 through February 1989, had blood cultures performed with the adult culture bottles, which produced a total of 1314 samples. A total of 113 patients, from March through July 1989, had blood cultures performed with the pediatric culture bottles, which produced a total of 758 samples. Percent recovery for the adult bottles versus the pediatric bottles was 13.95% versus 22.8% (p less than 0.0001). Since the amount of blood necessary to isolate an infectious agent is critical not only for laboratory identification but also for the volume of blood of pediatric patients, these data clearly establish the efficacy of pediatric blood culture bottles and the utilization of smaller amounts of blood. Not only did this approach significantly enhance organism recovery rate, but it may well be more cost-effective because fewer cultures need to be performed to isolate the infectious organism.\r"

The survey contained questions concerning frequency and techniques of wound monitoring, personnel involved in monitoring, as well as questions about how decisions were made to initiate topical antimicrobial therapy, which agents were selected, and how they were administered. Sixty of 90 facilities (66%) responded to the survey. Although there were few areas of unanimous agreement, several trends did emerge. Most facilities monitored burn wounds for microbes (92%). Wound monitoring was typically done at least twice weekly by either surface swab or quantitative biopsy. Nursing staff played a significant role in specimen collection in 69% of facilities and were solely responsible for obtaining biopsy specimens in 29% of facilities that used biopsies exclusively. All responding facilities used topical antimicrobial agents; silver sulfadiazine was the most popular (95%). Only 33% of facilities surveyed had their own laboratory for microbial monitoring. Rapid techniques for early diagnosis of wound sepsis were used in 20% of units, and topical antimicrobial testing was used in 17% of facilities surveyed.\r"

BALB/c mice injected with 5 X 10(5) plaque-forming units MCMV following a 15% to 16% total body surface area scald injury had increased incidence of positive mesenteric lymph node cultures compared with other groups. No intestinal mucosal histologies, mucosal dry weights, or wet-to-dry weight ratios in any animals were abnormal. Differences in cecal bacterial concentrations were not observed. Murine cytomegalovirus infection appears to enhance bacterial translocation in this model.\r"

A prospective randomized clinical trial that involved 30 patients with 20% or greater total body surface area burns was undertaken to evaluate the use of a standard antibiotic bowel preparation in the delay or prevention of bacterial colonization of the burn wound and sepsis. Certain enteric bacteria were seen less frequently in the treated group (Enterobacter organisms), but other bacteria appeared more often in the treated group (Proteus organisms and enterococci). The average time of colonization of the burn wounds was 6.1 days in the treated group and 6.7 days in the control group. Blood cultures were positive for enteric organisms earlier in the treatment group. Pseudomonads appeared earlier in the wound and blood cultures of the treated group than in the control group. The effect of antibiotic bowel suppression in patients with burns is varied and unpredictable. The bowel preparation may select certain organisms and lead to earlier colonization of the wounds. Overall outcome and survival was not improved by the use of an antibiotic bowel preparation in these patients.\r"

Contracture can recur even after wide and complete release and full-thickness skin grafting. Recurrence is partly due to the inherent difficulties in both early postoperative immobilization and the required long-term splinting. When adjacent tissues are also burned, adequate local tissue for reconstruction may not be available; therefore, free-tissue transfer may be necessary. The large surface area that is required after adequate release may be provided by tissue expansion before free-tissue transfer. In the case presented the use of tissue-expanded radial forearm free flap for the reconstruction of a recurrent neck contracture is described.\r"

The majority (59%) of gasoline-related burns were the result of inappropriate or unsupervised use of gasoline. The general public is largely unaware of the dangers of gasoline, and further education in this area is needed.\r"

The anatomic distribution of these burns, most often on the dominant hand and on the face, contributes to the morbidity of these burns. This injury has been associated with increasingly frequent litigation. We believe that an active education campaign and the addition of warning labels to car engine compartments would make an impact in decreasing the incidence of carburetor burns.\r"

Four of the Marjolin's ulcers were well-differentiated squamous cell carcinomas. One was a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, and one was a malignant melanoma. The average age at presentation was 59 years, and the mean interval from time of burn injury to appearance of neoplasm was 36.8 years. The lesions varied in anatomic location and involved the upper extremities, lower extremities, and scalp. In addition to the case studies, this paper reviews the literature and provides a logical treatment plan for a patient with a Marjolin's ulcer. Because these lesions can be very aggressive, a well thought-out treatment plan is necessary to optimize care and assure patient survival.\r"

Forty-four adolescents with a mean of 60% total body surface area (TBSA) full-thickness burns were studied. Half of the subjects scored within the normal range on a measure of psychological adjustment. Familial value patterns were critical in the prediction of psychological adjustment. Positive psychological adjustment was predicted by greater family cohesion, independence, and more open expressiveness within the family. Level of intelligence did not contribute to adjustment. Length of time after injury, if it is important to psychological healing, appears to be a factor only during the initial 2 years after burn injury.\r"

A review of the surgical literature reveals considerable confusion regarding the exact nature, location, and tumor interactions of these fusion planes. We review the gross and microscopic development of sites of embryologic fusion. We examine histologic sections through fusion sites in normally developed adult and fetal fresh cadaver specimens. Our studies, supported by our review of developmental anatomy, indicate that fusion planes do not persist as identifiable anatomic structures that would influence tumor spread.\r"

It has been found to be very effective for local anesthesia prior to venepuncture, minor surgical procedures, and pulsed dye laser (PDL) therapy for port-wine stains (PWS) in children. However, since EMLA may cause vasoconstriction of cutaneous vessels, we tried to determine whether pretreatment with EMLA decreases the efficacy of subsequent PDL treatment. We report eight patients between the ages of 4 and 32 years with PWS who received two test site treatments prior to PDL treatment. One site was pretreated with EMLA cream under occlusion for 60 minutes and then left unoccluded for 15 minutes prior to PDL test treatment. The other site, in the same area of the PWS and patient's body, was not pretreated with EMLA. The test sites were compared 6-8 weeks later to determine whether EMLA decreased the degree of lightening of the PWS compared to the non-EMLA-treated site. We conclude that EMLA is an effective topical anesthetic for PDL treatment of PWS and does not adversely affect the efficacy of the treatment.\r"

These areas had never been treated and previously were sites of basal cell carcinomas that underwent complete spontaneous regression 4-5 years from the date of onset. Pathology of these spontaneously regressed sites was consistent with the criteria established by Curson and Weedon (1979). Type III transepithelial elimination was demonstrated for a basal cell carcinoma. Type III transepithelial elimination may play a role in the spontaneous regression of basal cell carcinomas.\r"

Criteria for distinguishing a new primary BCC arising in a skin flap or full-thickness skin graft at a previous treatment site for BCC from a truly recurrent BCC are presented. The distinction between a new primary BCC and true tumor recurrence is important for accurate clinical assessment and may have a dramatic impact on the type of subsequent treatment. In addition, there may be less medicolegal liability in the case of a new primary BCC arising at the site of a previously treated BCC than for a BCC that is determined to be recurrent.\r"

As the field evolved, distant flaps and other techniques, including dermabrasion, cryosurgery, Mohs' surgery, and laser surgery, were added to the armamentarium. The close, interdepartmental relationships between Dermatology and Otolaryngology, Ophthalmology, Pediatrics, and Gynecology allowed Spanish dermatologic surgery to expand and encompass lymph node dissections, complex reconstructions of the neck, eyelid, vulvar area, breasts, and abdomen.\r"
