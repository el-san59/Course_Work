  ".W": "Dendritic cells (DC) in 121 colorectal adenocarcinomas were investigated immunohistochemically, using anti-S-100 protein antibody. S-100(+)DC were recognized among the malignant cells and/or around the tumor and differed in distribution either from lysozyme-positive macrophages or from neuron-specific enolase-positive neural tissue. Patients with many S-100(+)DC (more than 30 cells per 10 high-power fields) in the tumor survived longer than did those with few such cells (less than 30 cells), most often with no metastases (P less than 0.001). The grade of S-100(+)DC infiltration was related to both density of lymphocytic infiltration in the primary tumor and the degree of paracortical hyperplasia in the regional lymph nodes (P less than 0.05). Dendritic cells, therefore, as antigen-presenting cells, conceivably mediate cell immunity in a tumor with lymphoid infiltration and in the regional lymph nodes. The number of S-100(+) DC in the primary colorectal carcinomas represents one aspect of such a series of antitumor immunoreaction, in vivo.\r"

It is considered by Rubinstein to be a variant of glioblastoma multiforme and by Zulch to be of mesenchymal origin. We studied retrospectively ten cases of giant-celled glioblastoma to correlate clinical and pathological features including immunohistochemistry and ultrastructure, radiology and survival time. Seven men and three women ranging in age from 23-75 years had variable clinical presentations and well defined lesions on computed tomography (eight patients). Well-defined at surgery, the tumor was located in temporal (six patients), frontal (three patients), and parieto occipital (one patient) lobes. Besides characteristic histology, glial-fibrillary acidic protein was positive in all, along with intracytoplasmic fibrils on electron microscopy. Three patients died within 3 days of surgery. Of the surviving seven treated with radiation and/or chemotherapy, three had a survival time of more than 36 months and four less than 15 months. Our study identifies this tumor to be of astrocytic lineage, with temporal lobe predilection, and overall a longer survival rate than glioblastoma multiforme.\r"

We investigated the relationship between this budding and lymphatic invasion (ly), venous invasion (v), and lymph node metastasis (n), respectively. Moreover, we examined the relationship between ly, budding, and n in the preoperative biopsy specimens of 112 patients, including those of the 40 cases mentioned above. The degree of budding, which was abundant in the actively invasive region, showed a strong correlation with the degree of ly and the existence of n in the resected specimens. Also, budding was recognized in a relatively large portion of the biopsy specimens (52 of 112 [46.4%]) and lymph node metastasis was found in 41 of 52 specimens (78.8%). In 57 specimens, neither ly nor budding was found, and 16 of these specimens (28.1%) had positive lymph nodes. These results implied that the degree of budding in the actively invasive region can be a great help in predicting the presence of n. The presence or absence of budding in preoperative biopsy specimens also can be an important factor (along with the degree of differentiation and ly) in estimating the probability of n.\r"

Melanonychia striata had appeared as the initial sign in these five cases. Melanonychia striata is frequently observed in persons who are not white and is attributed to various local and systemic causes. Detailed clinical analysis of the five cases of early subungual melanoma showed that melanonychia striata with the following characteristics may increase the risk of early subungual melanoma developing: it is noticed during adulthood, it is broader than 6 mm, it is brownish with variegated shades or homogenously black, and it is accompanied by periungual pigmentation (Hutchinson's sign). Detection of early lesions of subungual melanoma is beneficial not only for the improvement of prognosis, but also for the preservation of the affected phalanx.\r"

Histologically, six were oat cell type, four the intermediate cell type, and multiple histologic sections revealed squamous and glandular differentiations in small or minute areas of seven and two tumors, respectively. In four of the six polypoid tumors, the epithelium covering the tumor showed a malignant conversion accompanied by a proliferation of small anaplastic cells. Another one showed a cribriform pattern in a small area of the tumor. Argyrophilic tumor cells were seen in six cases and tumor cells immunohistochemically positive for ACTH and calcitonin were seen in six, and three cases, respectively. Neurosecretory granules were evident in three of the seven cases examined by electron microscopy. These findings suggest that a small cell carcinoma of the esophagus differentiates toward a squamous, glandular, or neurosecretory lesion, thereby supporting the idea of a totipotential stem cell origin of this tumor. The prognosis of patients with this tumor was poor, in accord with the evidence of aggressive lymphatic and blood vessel permeation.\r"

  ".W": "We prospectively evaluated 50 cancer patients with new complaints of muscle cramps. Neurologic examination and laboratory evaluation identified disorders related to neural, muscular, or biochemical abnormalities in 41 (82%) patients. Abnormalities were confined mainly to the peripheral nervous system and included peripheral neuropathy in 22 patients, root and plexus pathology in 17 patients (six with leptomeningeal metastases), and polymyositis in two patients. Hypomagnesemia accounted for muscle cramps in only one patient. Identifiable causes of muscle cramps were related mostly either to metastatic or nonmetastatic complications of the underlying malignancy (14 patients) or to complications of its treatment (21 patients). Cramps, or rather complaints of cramps, were the presenting symptom of recognizable and previously unsuspected neurologic dysfunction in 64% (27 of 42) of the identified causes. Therefore, we conclude that muscle cramps in cancer patients may not be a benign complaint and that they usually mark the presence of an identifiable neurologic disorder. The use of simple clinical and laboratory measures is rewarding in the evaluation of these patients and leads to diagnosis in the majority of them.\r"

Metoclopramide was administered to all patients at 2 mg/kg, intravenously, 30 minutes before chemotherapy and 1.5, 3.5, and 5.5 hours posttreatment. Patients randomized to receive combined antiemetic therapy were administered lorazepam at 2 mg/m2 (maximum, 4 mg dose) intravenously, 30 minutes before chemotherapy. Those patients not receiving lorazepam were given normal saline placebo. Degree of nausea and number of vomiting episodes were recorded on a data flow sheet with a visual analogue scale. Drug toxicities were evaluated before each administered dose. Patients receiving both metoclopramide and lorazepam experienced significantly less vomiting episodes (P less than 0.05) and nausea (P less than 0.01) when compared to patients given metoclopramide alone. Forty-four percent of those receiving the combined therapy reported no nausea or vomiting episodes compared to only 22% receiving metoclopramide alone. Sedation was significantly more common in patients receiving lorazepam (88%) as opposed to patients receiving only metoclopramide (43%), P less than 0.01. Amnesia was seen in 25% receiving lorazepam. No significant difference in diarrhea, dystonia, or disinhibition was observed between the two arms. The authors conclude that the combination of lorazepam and metoclopramide was superior to metoclopramide alone in the prevention of cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting, with sedation and amnesia more commonly observed in the combined regimen.\r"

Sleep disorder and mood disturbance also were related to the experience of pain. Applied pain management strategies were rated by two physicians as inadequate in 54% of cases. The most frequent recommendation for improved pain management was an increase in the dosage or a change in the class of analgesics. The importance of periodic assessment of pain and its consequences, both physical and psychological, is discussed in light of increasing the level of information available to physicians and patients regarding appropriate approaches to pain management.\r"

The acceptance and tolerance of the examination were good in both populations. The mean age and length of the colons explored were not statistically different for the two groups. The incidence of adenomas was high in the breast cancer group (14.2%) in comparison to the control group (4.7%) (P less than 0.01). This strong incidence especially concerned very small polyps with a diameter smaller than 3 mm. There were also two polyps with superficial carcinomas in the breast cancer group. Breast cancer does indeed seem to represent a condition with a high risk of colorectal adenomas. Our results prompt us to propose the adoption of systematic screening measures and a surveillance schedule as soon as the breast cancer is found.\r"

Nausea, hair loss, and tiredness were each experienced by more than 80% of patients. By cycle 6, 46% of patients had thoughts about quitting therapy, but only a few had told medical staff. Patients' ratings of the objective difficulty of treatment increased over time, varied by treatment regimen, and were predicted by the experience of side effects, with the number of different side effects serving as the best predictor. In contrast, emotional distress was less sensitive to the directly assessable characteristics of treatment. Communication between patient and practitioner was found to be inadequate in a number of respects (i.e., patients did not fully anticipate the toxicities of treatment and did not report their concerns to medical staff). Communication may be impeded by inaccuracies in a patient's recall of treatment difficulties and by a patient's inability or unwillingness to attend to all presented information. More frequent opportunities for patient-practitioner discussion are necessary.\r"

Heart rate, left ventricular systolic pressure, and end-diastolic pressure were measured 15 minutes after the first angiography returned to the baseline values (71.0 +/- 14.1 vs. 72.2 +/- 15.5 beats/minute, 153.6 +/- 18.0 vs. 152.8 +/- 19.9 mm Hg, 21.7 +/- 8.6 vs. 20.9 +/- 7.3 mm Hg, respectively). Global and regional LV performance was analyzed by two observers with a computer-assisted technique. Intraobserver mean variation of end-diastolic volume and ejection fraction was less than 3% of the control value. Interobserver mean variations for the same parameters were less than 4% of control values. For both observers, there was no significant variation of LV end-diastolic volume and ejection fraction from one study to the other. Under stable hemodynamic conditions, the mean observed variations were, depending on the observer, 5-6% of the control value for LV end-diastolic volume and 5% for ejection fraction. Analysis of segmental wall motion was also highly reproducible. The mean intraobserver variation (% of control value) of wall motion ranged from 4.4% to 9.2%, depending on the sectors studied. The mean interobserver variation, whatever the sector, ranged from 6.9% to 13.5%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We also showed that autoantibodies to the ADP/ATP carrier inhibit the nucleotide transport in vitro. Specific binding of the autoantibodies to the carrier was demonstrated by radioimmunoassay and the immunoblot technique; the inhibition of the nucleotide transport was determined by the inhibitor stop method. To establish if these autoantibodies might also affect cardiac energy metabolism in vivo, we measured whether they are capable of penetrating into myocytes and whether subcellular ATP/ADP ratios and phosphorylation potentials of ATP change in hearts of guinea pigs that have been immunized with the isolated ADP/ATP carrier. An intracellular deposition of autoantibodies was observed by direct immunofluorescence and by immunoperoxidase staining on cryosections of the myocardial tissue of animals immunized with the ADP/ATP carrier. Furthermore, binding of autoantibodies to mitochondrial membrane structures was shown by immunoelectron-microscopic methods. The cytosolic and intramitochondrial distribution of adenine nucleotides in stimulated, isolated perfused hearts of guinea pigs immunized with the ADP/ATP carrier was measured by nonaqueous fractionation. Compared with controls performing equal external heart work, the cytosolic ATP decreased in the immunized animals, whereas the mitochondrial ATP increased strongly; ADP concentrations showed an opposite change. Thus, a resultant cytosolic decrease and a marked mitochondrial increase of the ATP/ADP ratio was established. As a consequence, the cytosolic-mitochondrial phosphorylation potential of ATP was diminished. These findings demonstrate that antibodies against intracellular antigens are able to penetrate into living cells, and that autoimmunity to the ADP/ATP carrier may contribute to the pathophysiology of myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy by causing an autoantibody-mediated imbalance between intracellular energy delivery and demand.\r"

In vivo right and left ventricular fractional rates of protein synthesis were determined by the [3H]leucine constant infusion method in 9-week-old rabbits. At this age, right and left ventricular fractional accumulation rates for total protein, myosin subunits, and actin were found to be identical, thus allowing for the comparison of the effect of regional hemodynamic load on protein degradation independent of its effect on growth. Total protein and individual myofibrillar protein fractional degradative rates were then derived as the difference between fractional rates of synthesis and accumulation. The results indicate increased fractional synthesis and degradation of myosin heavy chain and light chains, but not actin, in the left compared to the right ventricular free wall. Accelerated left ventricular replacement of myosin subunits may be related to regional differences in hemodynamic load. These results help explain the apparent increase in the in vivo rate of myocardial protein degradation observed in several experimental models of ventricular hypertrophy.\r"

  ".W": "Right ventricular cardiac tissue (10-20 mg wet weight) was obtained from anesthetized adult dogs by endomyocardial biopsy. The biopsy could be repeated in one dog every 2 weeks for up to 3 months. Fifty to 200 cardiomyocytes, dispersed with collagenase and trypsin, were collected by centrifugation of the cells with 50% polysucrose-sodium diatrizoate solution (Ficoll-Paque). Single cardiomyocytes were suspended in a minimum essential medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum and 8-bromoadenosine 3': 5'-cyclic monophosphate (0.1 mM) for up to 3 weeks. Approximately 70-80% of the cultured cardiomyocytes were rod shaped after 24 hours (10-20% after 7 days). Cytoplasmic organelles of the cultured cells, examined with a transmission electron microscope, were within the normal range of canine heart morphology in vivo. Resting membrane potential of the cells was about -80 mV when superfused with a Krebs' solution containing 4.7 mM potassium ions. The action potential lasted for 300 msec and had a peak amplitude of about 120 mV. Voltage-clamp experiments demonstrated the presence of an inward calcium current (congruent to 0.9 nA at +9 mV), which was facilitated by isoproterenol (0.1-1 microMs). The background potassium current showed typical inward rectification at potentials more negative than -80 mV. The results indicate that morphological, electrophysiological, and pharmacological properties of the cultured cardiomyocytes were intact. We propose that the culture techniques we have developed can be useful for repeated investigation on functional aspects of cardiac muscles in myocardial disease.\r"

Analysis of the pharmacokinetics and organ distribution of HBGF I is necessary before use of HBGF I as a pharmacological agent. Consequently, pharmacological studies were carried out with [125I]HBGF I in the rat. Intravenous injections of HBGF I were given with or without heparin (2.5 units/ng HBGF I). Blood concentrations of HBGF I decreased by one half 17 seconds after HBGF I bolus. This time was prolonged to 60 seconds when HBGF I was injected with heparin. The elimination half-life of HBGF I was 14 minutes in the presence of heparin. The highest concentrations of HBGF I following intravenous bolus were found in kidney, liver, and spleen, and the lowest in fat and brain. Heparin increased HBGF I concentrations in blood and all organs measured except kidney, which was significantly decreased (p less than 0.01). Intact HBGF I was recoverable from blood 5 minutes following intravenous administration. HBGF I underwent near-complete proteolytic digestion after more prolonged ex vivo incubation with rat plasma, but HBGF I was protected from proteolysis when incubations were conducted in the presence of heparin. Thus, it is feasible that HBGF I can be administered as a pharmacological agent in the presence of heparin. Further studies assessing acceleration of in vivo endothelial growth using HBGF I with heparin appear warranted.\r"

To further assess the potential anti-inflammatory effects of enprofylline, we infused it intra-arterially into the canine forelimb before and during a local intra-arterial infusion of histamine (4 micrograms/min) while monitoring forelimb skin lymph parameters. Infusion of enprofylline at 2 mg/min significantly decreased forelimb arterial pressures and increased heart rate and pulse pressure. Subsequent infusion of histamine caused a further reduction in forelimb arterial pressures and an increase in lymph flow, protein concentration, and protein transport similar to that seen with the infusion of histamine alone. Infusion of enprofylline at 5 mg/min decreased forelimb arterial pressures and systemic pressure. Subsequent histamine infusion further reduced forelimb arterial pressures, but the increase in lymph parameters was markedly attenuated. Enprofylline infused at 10 mg/min also decreased forelimb arterial and systemic pressures, but subsequent histamine infusion was essentially without effect on lymph parameters. To assess the role of catecholamines in enprofylline-mediated attenuation of histamine edema formation, we infused enprofylline at 5 mg/min in the presence of a beta 2-receptor blockade produced by the intra-arterial infusion of ICI 118551. The effects of enprofylline and histamine on vascular pressures were similar to those seen in the absence of beta 2-receptor blockade, but lymph flow, protein concentration, and protein transport increased similar to that seen with histamine alone. These data indicate that enprofylline is capable of attenuating histamine-induced increases in microvascular permeability, but this action of enprofylline is of an indirect nature, mediated through the release of catecholamines.\r"

In vitro experiments showed that glycolysis is the major pathway of energy production in this capillary tissue, and that iodoacetate, KCN, and low PO2 in combination markedly reduce its ATP generation. When in situ energy generation was inhibited by this combination during countercurrent perfusion of the arterial and venous capillaries of the rete, an approximate doubling of the intercapillary barrier permeability for human [125I]albumin, [14C]sucrose, and 22Na was found. Structural damage was evident, but the intercellular junctions remained intact. The effect of cessation of flow for 30 minutes, followed by reperfusion, was then explored. Stasis alone altered the structure, chiefly of the venous capillary endothelium, but not the permeability of the intercapillary barrier. Stasis with a hypoxic medium containing the inhibitors of energy generation, followed by reperfusion with oxygenated control medium, resulted in a progressive breakdown of the intercapillary barrier, with a threefold to fourfold increase in solute (labeled albumin, sucrose, and sodium) permeability, evolving during early reperfusion, but no change for labeled water permeability. Morphologically, the endothelial cells, especially those in venous capillaries, showed substantial damage; they appeared vacuolated, their cytoplasm was extracted, and cytoplasmic and membrane debris were found in the lumen; intercellular junctions remained intact. Local pericyte detachment with interstitial edema also appeared. Thus, stasis and reperfusion amplified the effects of reduction in energy generation and hypoxia on both permeability and morphological change.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effect of ejection on end-systolic pressure in isolated heart preparations. Ejecting beats were compared with isovolumic beats having the same volume as at end systole. While holding end-systolic volume constant, various stroke volumes, including negative stroke volumes (volume injected during systole), were imposed using a predetermined volume command. After switching contraction mode between ejecting and isovolumic, we measured the immediate and steady changes in end-systolic pressure. In the first isovolumic beat after switching from steady-state ejecting beats, the change in end-systolic pressure was variable, depending on the stroke volume. The end-systolic pressure of the ejecting beat exceeded that of the isovolumic beat on average by up to 18 mm Hg with small stroke volume, but the ejecting end-systolic pressure became lower than isovolumic with either large stroke volume (stroke volume/end-systolic volume less than 0.96) or with negative stroke volume. During the transient phase following a switch from ejecting to isovolumic, the end-systolic pressure gradually decreased to a steady state. Consequently, even in steady state, ejecting end-systolic pressure exceeded isovolumic pressure over a significant range of stroke volume (stroke volume/end-systolic volume less than 1.18). After returning contraction mode from isovolumic back to ejecting, we observed responses that were a mirror image. These results indicated that in addition to negative uncoupling effect, ejection exerts positive effects on ventricular end-systolic pressure that are manifest both quickly and gradually. We hypothesized that the mechanism responsible for the positive effect is length-dependent activation via the larger volume (both at the initiation of contraction and averaged over a cardiac cycle) of a beat that ejects compared to one held isovolumic at end-systolic volume. The results with volume injection were consonant with this concept.\r"

  ".W": "Ejection has previously been thought to exert only negative effects on end-systolic left ventricular pressure, via mechanisms like shortening deactivation and the force-velocity relation. Whether ejection also exerted a positive influence on pressure generation was tested by comparing two successive beats: 1) the last beat of steady-state ejection versus 2) a totally isovolumic contraction at the end-systolic volume. In 12 isolated, blood-perfused canine hearts loaded with a simulated arterial system, ejecting end-systolic pressure exceeded isovolumic pressure by approximately 10 mm Hg when ejection fraction was 0.3. With both higher and lower ejection fractions, the excess of ejecting end-systolic pressure was smaller; beyond an ejection fraction of roughly 0.5, the trend reversed so that ejecting end-systolic pressure fell below isovolumic pressure. The maximum excess in ejecting end-systolic pressure was quite variable (1-17 mm Hg), but the pattern of its variation with ejection fraction was consistent. A correlate of the positive effect of ejection on ventricular pressure was found in the timing of end systole. For an ejection fraction of 0.4, the systolic duration of ejecting beats was approximately 45% longer than in isovolumic beats (range, 23-67%). Potentially, a positive effect of ejection might be due to a residual influence of the stronger activation of cardiac myofilaments early in ejecting systole during which the sarcomeres were at longer lengths than in the isovolumic beat at end-systolic volume (length-dependent activation). A hypothetical model based on this mechanism reproduced both of the positive effects of ejection that were observed: excess end-systolic pressure and prolonged duration of systole. Thus, the approximate load independence of end-systolic pressure could result from the counter balance between opposing influences of ejection.\r"

Pentobarbital-anesthetized, vagotomized dogs were surgically prepared for reversible vascular isolation of the CS regions. Open-loop performance of the CS baroreflex was determined under control conditions and after intravenous infusion of each agent for 20 minutes at four rates (nitroprusside: 0.3-10 micrograms/kg/min; verapamil and diltiazem: 1-30 micrograms/kg/min; nifedipine: 0.1-3 micrograms/kg/min). With the CS baroreflex loop closed, each vasodilator decreased MAP from control (nitroprusside: 127 +/- 3 to 69 +/- 5 mm Hg; verapamil: 137 +/- 7 to 86 +/- 5 mm Hg; diltiazem: 137 +/- 9 to 100 +/- 5 mm Hg; nifedipine: 140 +/- 6 to 109 +/- 7 mm Hg). Each compound also caused a dose-dependent downward shift in the open-loop CSP-MAP relations. The higher doses of each vasodilator also depressed the total range of control of MAP (i.e., maximum MAP minus minimum MAP) by the baroreflex and significantly attenuated the peak open-loop MAP/CSP gains (nitroprusside: 1.21 +/- 0.19 to 0.56 +/- 0.12; verapamil: 1.36 +/- 0.16 to 0.64 +/- 0.10; diltiazem: 1.52 +/- 0.34 to 0.89 +/- 0.11; nifedipine: 1.35 +/- 0.20 to 0.83 +/- 0.14) but did not alter the CSP at which the peak gain was manifest. Only verapamil and diltiazem significantly shifted downward the CSP-HR relations, whereas none of the drugs affected the total range of baroreflex control of HR (i.e., maximum HR minus minimum HR) or the peak open-loop HR/CSP gains. Our results suggest that 1) it is unlikely that calcium channel antagonists act directly on the baroreceptors or the neural components of the baroreflex loop (i.e., afferent, central and efferent nerves) because they impair CS baroreflex control of MAP but not HR and 2) the impairment of MAP control is predominantly due to a nonspecific blunting of adrenergic vasoconstriction.\r"

A 2-minute coronary occlusion at 32-minute intervals (group 1, n = 11) or a 15-second occlusion at 4-minute intervals (group 2, n = 7) were repeated day and night without interruption. In both groups, the total duration of coronary occlusions each day was the same (90 minutes). Before and after repetitive occlusions of either group, effects of transient 2-minute coronary occlusion on regional segment shortening in the ischemic area were examined to assess the functional state of the collateral vessels. In group 1, systolic segment shortening in the area rendered ischemic was reduced to -97.8 +/- 17.7% of the preocclusive control value during 2 minutes of coronary occlusion. After 125-478 repetitive occlusions (3-11 days), the degree of hypokinesia during the 2-minute occlusion was significantly improved to -0.6 +/- 4.6% of the preocclusive value (p less than 0.001 vs. before the repetition). In group 2, it remained unchanged even after 3,500-5,450 repetitive occlusions (11-16 days): -111.8 +/- 8.2% before and -111.4 +/- 13.8% after the repetition of 15-second occlusions (NS). The ratio of peripheral coronary arterial pressure to aortic pressure during transient-coronary occlusion, measured by selective catheterization, was significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2 (64.4 +/- 5.3% vs. 20.7 +/- 1.3%, p less than 0.001). These findings suggest that myocardial ischemia of 2 minutes but not 15 seconds is vital to provide effective stimuli for angiogenesis.\r"

The pipette solution contained guanosine-5'-triphosphate (GTP) or guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP-gamma S, a nonhydrolysable GTP analogue). In GTP-loaded cells, not only ACh but also adenosine induced a specific K+ channel current via GTP-binding proteins (G) by activating muscarinic ACh or adenosine receptors. Quinidine and disopyramide depressed the ACh-induced K+ current quite effectively. Procainamide had a weak inhibitory effect. Quinidine also depressed adenosine-induced K+ current, while the effect of disopyramide on adenosine-induced current was much smaller than that on ACh-induced current. In GTP-gamma S-loaded cells, the K+ channel was uncoupled from the receptors and was activated irreversibly, probably due to direct activation of G proteins by GTP-gamma S. Quinidine depressed the GTP-gamma S-induced K+ current just as in the cases of ACh- and adenosine-induced currents of GTP-loaded cells. Disopyramide had only a weak inhibitory effect and procainamide showed no effect. From these results, it is strongly suggested that the major mechanisms underlying the anti-cholinergic effects of quinidine, disopyramide, and procainamide are different; quinidine may inhibit the muscarinic K+ channel itself and/or G proteins, while disopyramide and high doses of procainamide may mainly block functions of muscarinic ACh receptors in atrial myocytes.\r"

  ".W": "The modulation of L-type voltage sensitive calcium channels in isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes by the dihydropyridine (+)-202-791 was examined with the whole-cell voltage-clamp technique with 1.8 mM Ba or Ca as the charge carrier. Striking voltage- and use-dependent effects of the dihydropyridine calcium channel \"agonist\" (+)-202-791 were revealed. From a holding potential of -60 mV, depolarizing test pulses in the presence of (+)-202-791 demonstrated a concentration-dependent (EC50, 177 nM) increase in the measured peak inward barium current compared to control. In contrast, more depolarized holding potentials (greater than or equal to -30 mV) (+)-202-791 caused a biphasic effect on the peak inward current resulting in a transient enhancement followed by a steady-state block. A saturable, concentration-dependent hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of current inactivation was observed in the presence of (+)-202-791 with an EC50 of 10.2 nM. The voltage dependence of current activation was also shifted in the hyperpolarizing direction in the presence of (+)-202-791. A use-dependent relative block by (+)-202-791 was observed after repetitive depolarizing test pulses at a frequency of 2 Hz. Thus, the single enantiomer (+)-202-791 can result in either an increase in the whole cell calcium channel current (favored by hyperpolarized holding potentials and low rates of stimulation) or block of calcium channel current (favored by depolarized holding potentials and high rates of stimulation). Various combinations of (-)-202-791, a reported calcium channel antagonist, and (+)-202-791 resulted in intermediate effects on voltage sensitive calcium or barium currents compared with the presence of either enantiomer alone, and no clear cooperative interactions between the enantiomers were observed in contrast to a previous single channel study (Kokuban S, Prod'ham B, Becker C, Porzig H, Reuter H: Studies on Ca channels in intact cardiac cells: Voltage-dependent effects and cooperative interaction of dihydropyridine enantiomers. Mol Pharmacol 1986;30:571-584). The results are discussed in relation to the possible presence of multiple dihydropyridine receptors associated with the voltage sensitive calcium channel.\r"

Calmodulin inhibited Ca2+-release channel opening by reducing the mean duration of single-channel open events without having an effect on single-channel conductance. Inhibition by calmodulin was dependent on Ca2+ concentration and occurred in the absence of ATP. The effects of calmodulin were reversed by mastoparan, a calmodulin-binding peptide. Two other calmodulin antagonists [calmidazolium and N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalene sulfonamide] modified the gating behavior of the channel in the absence of exogenous calmodulin in a concentration- and Ca2+-dependent manner. Our results suggest that calmodulin can modulate excitation-contraction coupling by directly interacting with the SR Ca2+-release channel of cardiac and skeletal muscle.\r"

To accomplish this, the epicardial coronary microcirculation was viewed through an intravital microscope using stroboscopic epi-illumination. Microvascular diameters were measured under control conditions during beta-adrenergic blockade (propranolol 1 mg/kg) and beta-adrenergic blockade with pacing; during coronary alpha-adrenergic activation in the presence of beta-adrenergic blockade with three doses of norepinephrine infusion (0.1, 0.5, and 1.0-2.0 micrograms/kg/min) or three frequencies of bilateral stellate nerve stimulation (2, 10, and 20 Hz); and during combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade (phentolamine 2 mg/kg and propranolol 1 mg/kg). Diameters of both arterial and venous vessels were reduced during beta-adrenergic blockade but returned back to baseline with pacing. At the lowest level of norepinephrine infusion or frequency of bilateral stellate stimulation, microvessel constriction was not observed. At the higher doses of norepinephrine a -5.1 +/- 0.9% (1.0-2.0 micrograms/kg/min) and a -4.0 +/- 1.1% (0.5 micrograms/kg/min) decrease in diameter of arterial vessels greater than 100 microns in diameter were observed (p less than 0.05). At 10 Hz and 20 Hz of stellate stimulation, diameter decreased by -4.8 +/- 1.9% and -4.4 +/- 2.1%, respectively, in these relatively large vessels. Small coronary arterioles (less than 100 microns diameter) dilated significantly during the highest levels of nerve stimulation (9.2 +/- 2.5% increase in diameter) or infusion rate of norepinephrine (13.6 +/- 2.7% increase in diameter) (p less than 0.05). These constrictor and dilator responses were abolished following combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade. Norepinephrine infusion resulted in a decrease in diameter of coronary veins and venules (7.2 +/- 1.3%) (p less than 0.05), whereas stellate stimulation did not significantly reduce venous and venular diameters. In summary, the coronary venous and venular vasculature responds to alpha-adrenergic activation from circulating norepinephrine but is not affected by stellate stimulation. In contrast, stellate stimulation and norepinephrine infusion elicit similar responses in the coronary arterial and arteriolar microvasculature. Constriction occurs in vessels greater than 100 microns in diameter, whereas dilation predominates in vessels less than 100 microns in diameter. Such heterogeneous arterial responses would undoubtedly result in a redistribution of coronary vascular resistance toward larger coronary arteries and arterioles.\r"

  ".W": "We used the patch clamp technique to study the nature of the late sodium current in guinea pig ventricular myocytes. In a cell attached mode of single channel recording at room temperature (22-24 degrees C) two kinds of late (100 msec or more after beginning of the depolarizing pulse) sodium channel activities were recognized. One is isolated brief openings appearing once for about 120 depolarizations per channel (background type), while the other type is sustained openings with rapid interruptions (burst type) that occurred only once for 2,700 depolarizations per channel. The time constant obtained from the open time histogram of the burst type (1.05 msec) was about five times longer than that of background type (0.18 msec, measured at the potential 10 mV above the threshold). Magnitude of the late sodium current flowing through the entire surface of a myocyte was estimated with tetrodotoxin (60 microM), a specific inhibitor of sodium channels, in whole-cell clamp experiments. The steady tetrodotoxin-sensitive current of 12 to 50 pA was registered at -40 mV (26 +/- 14 pA, mean +/- SD, n = 5), in good agreement with the late sodium current calculated from the single channel recording. Tetrodotoxin produced small (congruent to 10%) but significant decreases in the action potential duration. These results suggest the presence of a small but significant late sodium current with slow inactivation kinetics and that this current probably plays a significant role in maintaining the action potential plateau and the duration in guinea pig ventricular myocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Changes in oxygen radical mechanisms during 6-48 weeks of heart hypertrophy in rats subjected to a narrowing of the subdiaphragmatic aorta were examined. During this period, hypertrophied hearts demonstrated a stable hyperfunction, as indicated by an elevated but stable left ventricular systolic pressure, dP/dt, and aortic pressure and no change in left ventricular end diastolic pressure. Experimental animals showed increased heart-to-body weight ratios; however, the conventional signs of heart failure such as increased wet-to-dry weight ratios of liver and lung, ascites, or pleural effusion were absent. Hearts were examined for superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and lipid peroxide activities. The superoxide dismutase activity was significantly higher in hypertrophied hearts at 6 and 12 weeks as compared with sham-operated rats (sham controls), while no difference was seen at 24 and 48 weeks due to a marked increase in the superoxide dismutase activity of sham control hearts in these age groups. During the period studied, glutathione peroxidase activity remained unchanged in controls but was significantly elevated in hypertrophied hearts. Lipid peroxide activity as indicated by the malondialdehyde content was significantly lower in hypertrophied hearts. Perfusion of isolated control and hypertrophy hearts with xanthine-xanthine oxidase, an exogenous source of oxygen radicals, resulted in contractile failure and rise in resting tension. In hypertrophied hearts, however, the contractile force was better maintained and there was a lesser rise in resting tension after exposure to xanthine-xanthine oxidase. The study suggests the development of a higher antioxidative capacity during the stable phase of hypertrophy due to a chronic pressure overload.\r"

  ".W": "The introduction of new techniques to the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) armamentarium is beginning to provide an MRI examination that overcomes many of the disadvantages noted in earlier reports. An analysis of the various advantages and disadvantages of MRI, plain film myelography, and computed tomographic myelography points to a potential revision of the sequence of diagnostic studies and the workup of cervical degenerative disease. MRI might now be the appropriate first test for the evaluation of the cervical spine in a patient with symptoms referable to degenerative disease when therapeutic intervention is considered. An initial T1-weighted sagittal image with a 3-mm slice thickness will provide excellent contrast evaluation of the vertebral body marrow, disc space height, neural canal, and spinal cord. Disc herniation, canal stenosis, subluxation, and malalignment can be appreciated. Next, a fast, variable flip angle, gradient-echo sequence can be performed to increase the signal density of the cerebrospinal fluid relative to the extradural elements and cord. This provides an increased conspicuousness of extradural disease. Axial gradient-echo fast sequences, with low flip angles, will provide a second orthogonal plane with increased conspicuousness of extradural changes relative to the neural foramen and thecal sac. If necessary, additional oblique views through the neural foramen can be obtained. Finally, if intramedullary disease is considered in the differential, a gated, refocused, T2-weighted examination in the sagittal plane will provide the necessary soft-tissue contrast to detect pathology without unwanted artifact. Thus, unlike plain film or computed tomographic myelography, an examination of the entire cervical region including the osseous structures, extradural cerebrospinal fluid interface, and the spinal cord can be obtained with a single modality in an outpatient setting and in a noninvasive fashion. MRI can certainly replace plain film myelography for the overwhelming majority of situations. If surface-coil MRI fails to demonstrate an abnormality responsible for the patient's clinical symptoms, then a high-resolution computed tomographic scan with or without intrathecal contrast can be obtained. While the cost at first may seem prohibitive, the additional information that MRI is capable of providing in a noninvasive outpatient setting more than compensates for the expense.\r"

Despite its demonstrated effectiveness, certain problem areas, including pin loosening and infection, have been identified. These problems have subsequently inspired detailed studies of skull osteology, biomechanics of pin fixation, and comparisons of techniques of application. Based on these studies, specific recommendations concerning the application and maintenance of the halo have developed. Anterior pin sites should be located in the safe zone approximately 1 cm superior to the orbital rim, cephalad to the lateral two-thirds of the orbit, and below the greatest circumference of the skull. The optimal posterior pin sites are located posterolaterally, diagonal to the corresponding contralateral anterior pins. Pins should be inserted perpendicular to the skull, tightened to eight inch/pounds (0.90 Newton-meter), and retightened once at 48 hours. A subsequent loose pin may be retightened once to eight inch/pounds if resistance is met; otherwise, it should be removed and a new one placed in a different location. Infected pins require antibiotic therapy, wound care, and possibly pin-site change and wound debridement.\r"

Statistical analysis of the values obtained from roentgenograms revealed close correlations among the three methods. The first two methods were superior to the McGregor method because the measuring points could be identified on plain roentgenograms of the cervical spine in virtually all cases. The McGregor value could not be determined in 38 (18%) patients. Since medullary compression could be detected by magnetic resonance imaging in all patients who showed abnormal Redlund-Johnell values, the Redlund-Johnell method may be useful for diagnosing advanced VS. It also detects not only atlantoaxial lesions but also atlantooccipital lesions. Thus, the Redlund-Johnell method appears to be the best method for diagnosing VS in RA patients.\r"

This technique, however, has disadvantages such as the frequent occurrence of pseudarthrosis, a high probability of relapse, and the necessity of long-standing strict external fixation until bone fusion. To overcome these problems, posterior occipitoatlantoaxial fusion was performed using a rectangular rod that assures strong internal fixation in 16 patients with atlantoaxial subluxation. The condition was complicated by superior migration of the dens in five patients. Clinical and roentgenographic examinations before and after the operation showed improvements in neurological symptoms and in pain in the neck and occipital region in all patients. Bone fusion was observed in all patients and reduction, performed to the extent possible during the operation, was retained adequately. The present method, which provides strong internal fixation, allows bone fusion and early initiation of rehabilitation with a simple external support of the neck. It also facilitates laminectomy of C1 in patients with associated myelopathy. This procedure, therefore, is particularly effective in patients with marked instability or with rheumatoid arthritis and makes postoperative application of a halo vest or skull traction unnecessary.\r"

Micromotion was registered with dial indicators. Micromotion was minimized distally and proximally by achieving tight distal fixation. Collar seating prevented distal migration and failure of fixation, but it did not have a detectable effect on mediolateral or anteroposterior proximal micromotion. Toggle appears to be controlled primarily by the distal portion of the stem. Axial load transfer appears to be primarily controlled by collar seating. The least micromotion was achieved with a tight fit distally.\r"

Multiple methods of initial treatment were encountered including synovectomy alone, synovectomy and total hip arthroplasty, radiation therapy, and arthrodesis. Synovectomy is only effective when articular cartilage is preserved. Total hip arthroplasty, although of concern in such a young population, appears to be the procedure of choice for either advanced cases of PVS or those that have failed joint-sparing procedures.\r"

Independently, these methods demonstrated that the prosthesis was held in situ by collagenous tissue between and below the metal pellets of the prosthesis. Calcified bone did not appear to interact with the prosthesis and is probably not a major factor for prosthesis fixation. The various analytic methods described are suitable and sufficient for further exploration on a larger scale of the zone of bone-metal contact in cementless implants.\r"

For all patients, the mean maximal velocity preoperatively was 65% of that of normal people, with only a slight, nonsignificant increase at the follow-up examination. An additional indication of insufficient rehabilitation was the decrease in stride length at constant maximal velocity at the follow-up evaluation. Positive correlations were found between stride length and muscle torque in the thigh. Positive correlations were also found between a subjective score and maximal velocity. Simple tests of velocity, stride length, and stride frequency are recommended as an easy and decisive method of follow-up evaluation.\r"

Through this approach, mortality in the multiply injured patient with a cervical spine injury has been reduced to 22%. Of 58 patients with cervical spine injuries evaluated by this aggressive approach, 14 patients had associated spine fractures, and 9 patients had positive peritoneal lavage requiring surgical exploration. Injuries involving other organ systems were also diagnosed and treated. Formal, rigid evaluation plans and aggressive multidisciplinary treatment are useful in saving the lives and salvaging neurologic function of these patients.\r"

An analysis of all these patients established the incidence of this complication to be 3%. The etiology of these fractures appears to be an overloading of the lateral metatarsals secondary to some shortening of the hallux metatarsal or in reestablishing motion to the hallux metatarsophalangeal joint. All fractures healed without complication and did not result in further forefoot symptoms or deformities. However, this complication should be suspected when lateral metatarsalgia develops following silicone implant arthroplasty because roentgenograms initially may be normal.\r"

The volar surgical approach through the palm is common, but to expose the hook some hypothenar muscles and cardinal ligaments must be divided. Care must be taken to avoid injury of the motor and sensory branches of the ulnar nerve that occur close to the hook. The lateral approach between the abductor digiti minimi muscle and the fifth metacarpal bone is easier and less traumatic. This approach is also safer for the ulnar neurovascular bundle, which is protected by volar retraction and the hypothenar muscles. The lateral approach is advantageous unless the injury is complicated by ulnar nerve palsy or flexor tendon injury.\r"

  ".W": "A surgical technique designed for safe and easy access to the popliteal vessels, resection of a large segment of the tibia and knee joint, and a method of patellar/extensor mechanism reconstruction and soft-tissue coverage that utilizes a transferred medial gastrocnemius muscle is reported. Eleven patients have been treated with this technique, including seven patients with a minimum follow-up evaluation of two years (average, 49.5 months; range, 24.6-84.4 months). There were five males and two females, with an average age of 28.7 years. The histologic diagnoses were osteosarcoma, four patients; malignant fibrous histiocytoma, one patient; chondrosarcoma, one patient; and poorly differentiated sarcoma, one patient. The surgical stages were Stage IIA, one patient, and IIB, six patients. Six intraarticular resections and one extraarticular resection were performed; all were classified as wide excisions. Four prosthetic replacements and three arthrodeses were performed. Pathological specimens showed meniscal and patellar tendon involvement in two patients and pericapsular tibiofibular joint involvement in six patients. Local complications were transient peroneal nerve palsy in four patients and superficial skin slough in one patient. All resections obtained negative margins, and there was no local recurrence or metastatic disease. Functional results (Musculoskeletal Tumor Society System classification) were excellent in one patient, good in four, fair in one, and poor in one. Limb-sparing surgery for high-grade tumors of the proximal tibia is recommended for carefully selected patients.\r"

Patients were evaluated before and after conversion for subjective acceptance, gait deviations, relative femoral shaft inclination, coronal-plane hip abduction torque, and ambulatory metabolic demands. The CAT-CAM socket was subjectively rated superior by four patients. Most gait deviations improved or disappeared. Femoral shaft inclination angles improved an average of 6.5 degrees toward adduction by roentgenographic measurements in four patients. Film records suggest that the compensatory lateral trunk lean, seen in patients with quadrilateral sockets, diminished after conversion. These four patients increased their customary gait velocities, and all showed a reduction in the quantity of oxygen consumed per meter traveled by up to 50%.\r"

  ".U": "89106521\r", 
  ".W": "To assess the influence of both the rate and the frequency of distraction on osteogenesis during limb elongation, a canine tibia was used with various combinations of distraction rates (0.5 mm, 1.0 mm, or 2.0 mm per day) and distraction frequencies (one step per day, four steps per day, 60 steps per day). The distractions were performed after both open osteotomy and closed osteoclasis. Histomorphic and biochemical studies were conducted on the elongated osseous tissue, fascia, skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, blood vessels, nerves, and skin. It was determined that distraction at a rate of 0.5 mm per day often led to premature consolidation of the lengthening bone, while a distraction rate of 2.0 mm per day often resulted in undesirable changes within elongating tissues. A distraction rate of 1.0 mm per day led to the best results. It was also observed that the greater the distraction frequency, the better the outcome. With optimum preservation of periosseous tissues, bone marrow, and blood supply at the time of osteotomy, stability of external fixation, and 1.0 mm per day of distraction in four steps, osteogenesis within the distraction gap of an elongating bone takes place by the formation of a physislike structure, in which new bone forms in parallel columns extending in both directions from a central growth zone. The growth plate that forms under the influence of tension-stress has features of both physeal and intramembranous ossification, yet is neither; instead, the distraction regenerated bone is unique, providing numerous applications in clinical traumatology, orthopedics, and other medical disciplines.\r"

Concepts of the origin of the osteoclast have been changing. The classic concept was that the osteoclast originated from connective tissue cells. Others hypothesized that it originated from mature hematopoietic cells, particularly from monocyte or macrophage cells. A recent concept proposed an origin from hematopoietic stem cells. The hematopoietic stem cell was believed to differentiate into two cell lineages: one of monocytes and the other of preosteoclasts. The authors' concept, based on experimental observations as well as alternate interpretations stemming from experimental reports of other researchers, proposes an origin from local, nonhematopoietic, possibly perivascular mesenchymal cells. However, the relationship of the hematopoietic stem cells to perivascular mesenchymal cells in the periosteum at an early stage of enchondral ossification is still not well known. Therefore, the origin of the osteoclast also remains uncertain.\r"

On implantation of BMP with gelatin, the gelatin was rapidly absorbed and no ectopic bone formation was observed, but periosteal cellular proliferation with subsequent formation of periosteal cartilage and bone was seen in ribs adjacent to the implant. Implantation of the same amount of BMP fraction or gelatin alone as controls did not result in either any ectopic bone formation in situ or any periosteal bone formation in adjacent ribs. Implantation of BMP with collagen resulted consistently in both ectopic bone formation in situ and periosteal bone formation in adjacent ribs. These results suggest that BMP is diffusible in vivo and is capable of eliciting a response from periosteum to stimulate periosteal bone formation.\r"

Careful neurologic examination and lateral roentgenograms are indicated in all patients with suspected injury. If there is any neurologic deficit, fracture, or dislocation seen on roentgenogram, skull-traction tongs should be applied to provide stability and prevent further damage. If the neurologic examination and roentgenograms are normal, a stretch-test roentgenogram may be indicated to detect an occult ligamentous injury. Muscular strains and first-degree sprains may be treated with a collar and early active exercise. Subluxation and facet dislocations are most reliably treated with a posterior one-level fusion. Comminuted body fractures are best treated with an anterior strut graft. Complex fracture-dislocations of both anterior and posterior columns may be best treated with skull traction followed by combined anterior and posterior stabilization. Halo-jacket immobilization has few indications in subaxial injuries. It does not provide enough stability to maintain reduction of unstable mid- and low-cervical injuries. It may be used for postoperative immobilization in very unstable situations, but its greatest use is in immobilization of C1 and C2 fractures.\r"

Physically, it resembles the triangular fragment fracture or teardrop fracture, but it responds very poorly to posterior fusion, the conventional treatment for these fractures. It is characterized by a quadrangular-shaped fragment from the anterior one-third of the vertebral body, a significant degree of posterior subluxation, an angular kyphosis, and an increased interspinous space with facet subluxation due to disruption of the soft tissues. Recognition of the quadrangular fragment may help determine the treatment protocol. A group of 23 patients with quadrangular fragment fracture was treated with the standard protocol and had poor results, including difficulty in maintaining reduction, neck pain, and significant residual kyphosis. A second group of 15 patients received kyphosis. A second group of 15 patients received the second treatment protocol, which consisted of one to two weeks of skull traction over an extension bolster, followed by an anterior interbody strut graft to stabilize the fracture and further traction over an extension bolster until four weeks postinjury. Treatment minimized the angular kyphosis apparent at bony healing, and all patients achieved satisfactory union with good alignment and no significant neck pain.\r"

  ".W": "Hanging, a common method of execution, began in antiquity and continues to this date. Unfortunately, the exact cause of a victim's demise was not always obvious, and many victims died as the result of asphyxiation from the hangman's noose. In the latter part of the 19th century, scientific curiosity led to autopsy studies of the cervical spine; Paterson in 1890 first described the lethal lesion. Experimental work in 1913 demonstrated that when the hangman's knot was placed beneath the chin, death rapidly occurred because of a traumatic spondylolisthesis of the second cervical vertebra. This knot placement then became standard as the most efficient method of execution. It was not until the mid-20th century that the similarity between judicial and civilian injury was recognized. The reports were infrequent, and most of the pars interarticularis fractures resulted from automobile accidents in which the victim was thrown forward and struck his or her face against the windshield which caused sudden violent hyperextension. The similarity between civilian and vehicular injuries was recognized in 1965 by Schneider who, together with his associates, reported eight cases; it was this group who introduced the term \"hangman's fracture\". Garber presented his thoughts on this subject, noting that there was a difference between the forces generated by judicial hanging and those caused by motor vehicle accidents and other similar civilian injuries. The former results in axial loading and hyperextension, and, rarely, in flexion or axial loading. Since the lesion occurs at the pars interarticularis of C2, Garber suggested that a more appropriate term might be traumatic spondylolisthesis of the axis.\r"

In this situation, laminaplasty is preferred for patients with developmental cervical canal stenosis, failed anterior fusion, or various prior anterior neck operations. Cervical laminectomy is indicated for patients with anterior bony ankylosis secondary to degenerative or inflammatory disorders and for patients in whom anterior fusion may be technically difficult, i.e., at C1-C3 or C7-T1. Anterior fusion is advisable for patients who have a structural reversal of the normal lordotic curve.\r"

The effects of HS on thyroid hormone-responsive GC cells were studied in an attempt to devise an in vitro model for the adaptive changes in thyroid hormone action caused by nonthyroidal disease. HS enhanced GC cell synthesis of 70 K and 90 K proteins in a manner previously described as characteristic of the HS response in many tissues. A step-wise decrease in GC cell viability occurred when cells were exposed to 45 C for 10 to 35 min. HS (45 C, 20 min) resulted in a rapid decrease in binding of T3 to nuclear receptors. Two hours after HS, analysis of T3 binding to isolated nuclei showed a 50% fall in binding capacity (240 fmol/100 micrograms DNA) compared to non-HS control cells (540 fmol/100 micrograms DNA); no difference in dissociation constant (Kd) was observed. The effect of thyroid hormone on cell viability after HS was then determined. Thyroid hormone depletion (less than or equal to 0.02 nM T3) resulted in significantly (P less than 0.05) enhanced cell viability compared to cells cultured with physiological T3 (0.2 nM) after incubation at 45 C for intervals of 10-35 min. This inverse relationship between medium T3 content and cell tolerance of HS occurred over a wide range of T3 concentrations. Mean cell viability after exposure to 45 C for 20 min was 44 +/- 3% in T3-depleted cultures (less than or equal to 0.02 nM), 27 +/- 1% to 32 +/- 5% in cultures containing 0.07-0.5 nM T3, and 13 +/- 3% in cultures containing 5 nM T3. Our results thus characterize the response to HS in GC cells and the relationship of this response to medium T3. Similar to the effect of various nonthyroidal diseases on rat hepatocytes in vivo, HS resulted in a decrease in T3 nuclear receptors. Similar to the adverse effect of thyroid hormone on morbidity in animals with experimental diseases or injury, GC cell viability after HS was inversely related to medium T3 content. Thus the HS response in GC cells may be a valuable in vitro model relevant to the effect on thyroid hormone action caused by nonthyroidal disease.\r"

Purified activated GRC were found to have much higher affinity for histones H3 and H4 (arginine-rich histones) than for histones H2A and H2B (slightly lysine-rich histones) and to have negligible affinity for histone H1 (lysine-rich histone). The GRC bound to immobilized histones could be eluted with PALP, but not with its related compounds, such as pyridoxamine, pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate, pyridoxal, and pyridoxine, suggesting a specific effect of PALP. Not only activated GRC but also unactivated GRC were found to bind to immobilized histones. However, from their profiles of elution from a histone-agarose column by 20 mM PALP, the activated GRC seemed to have higher affinity than unactivated GRC for histone. Our results suggest that the binding of GRC to histones could be associated with a mechanism for alteration of the chromosome structure by the hormonal signals, before the binding of the GRC to a specific sequence of DNA in regulatory elements of glucocorticoid-responsible genes.\r"

The seasonal changes were related to the different phases of the bats' reproductive cycles. Mammosomatotrophs (MS cells) containing both PRL and GH were constantly present throughout the reproductive cycles of the female bats and they were remarkably hypertrophied during pregnancy. The distribution pattern of PRL and GH within the MS cells was extremely variable owing to the different phases of reproductive cycles of the bats. We divided MS cells into the following four types: the cell containing 1) only mixed granules containing both PRL and GH, 2) both mixed and PRL granules, 3) mixed, PRL and GH granules, 4) both mixed and GH granules. While pure PRL-containing cells were observed in pregnant and lactating bats, they were not observed in bats obtained during prehibernation, midhibernation, and arousal periods. These results suggest that MS cells in the female bats hypertrophy during pregnancy and that some of them may be transformed into PRL-producing cells.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) stimulate responses in skeletal muscle that include effects on carbohydrate and fat metabolism, protein turnover, growth, and differentiation. To gain insight into the relative importance of insulin and IGFs at different stages of development, the expression of their specific receptors was evaluated in skeletal muscle of rats from the late fetal period through 40 weeks of age. Distinct receptors for insulin. IGF-I and IGF-II are present in crude membrane preparations and wheat germ agglutinin-purified extracts of hindlimb muscle from rats at all ages, but each of the three receptors follows a different pattern of expression during development. There is a marked predominance of IGF-II receptors in fetal muscle (80- and 55-fold more abundant than insulin and IGF-I receptors, respectively) and a rapid decline in IGF-II receptors in early postnatal life. IGF-I receptors are more abundant than insulin receptors in the term fetus, remain constant in number until approximately 4 weeks of age, and then gradually decline to adult levels. Insulin receptor number rises 2- to 3-fold postnatally, peaks at approximately 4 weeks, and decreases to levels in the adult that are slightly lower than those in the term fetus. Although binding affinities and receptor specificity did not change during development, the relatively large number of IGF-II receptors in the fetus resulted in significant binding of IGF-I to receptors for both IGF-II and IGF-I. There was a modest increase in apparent mol wt of all three receptor types during development, suggesting a change in a common pathway, such as posttranslational glycosylation. The marked changes in number and distinct patterns of expression of the insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II receptors in muscle during development are consistent with evolving functions of the three hormones determined by alterations in both receptor number and hormone concentrations.\r"

To determine whether induced hypothyroidism, known to reduce pituitary PRL concentration, also reduces pituitary concentration of VIP, rats were treated with antithyroid drugs for 3 weeks. Pituitary PRL concentration in male rats (micrograms/mg protein) was markedly reduced by this treatment (9.4 +/- 1.0 vs. 2.3 +/- 0.4 when extracted at pH 1.1, 17.9 +/- 3.0 vs. 3.4 + 0.4 when extracted at pH 7.4, 21.8 +/- 3.3 vs. 6.7 + 1.3 when extracted at pH 10.0). Contrary to expectation, pituitary VIP concentration was markedly increased in hypothyroidism; in males from 169.5 +/- 20.3 to 834.0 +/- 82.2 pg/mg protein, and in females (whose pituitary PRL had been similarly reduced) from 103.1/I +/- 34.1 to 771.6 +/- 100.9 pg/mg protein. Serum PRL was significantly reduced in hypothyroid males (7.4 +/- 1.6 vs. 28.9 +/- 12.2 ng/ml) whereas in females, serum PRL was not significantly altered (41.4 +/- 11.6 vs. 38.8 +/- 14.3 ng/ml). The effect of hypothyroidism was reversed by administration of T4 in physiological doses. The authenticity of pituitary immunoreactive VIP was further established by demonstrating chromatographic patterns by Sephadex G-50 gel exclusion and reverse phase HPLC separations identical to synthetic VIP. Immunohistochemically reactive VIP cells could not be demonstrated in normal pituitaries, but the marked increase in VIP in hypothyroid animals made it possible to visualize a population of VIP immunoreactive stellate cells which appear to be distinct from hypothyroid lactotropes and thyrotropes.\r"

Under conditions optimized for monooxygenase activity (pH 8.0, 5 mM NADPH), 4-hydroxylation predominated (apparent Vmax = 65 pmol and 13 pmol/mg protein/30 min for 4- and 2-hydroxy-E2, respectively). Under conditions optimized for peroxidatic activity (pH 6.0, 50 mM cumene hydroperoxide) 2- and 4-hydroxylated-E2 were produced in similar amounts. Thus in the AP, unlike in other target tissues studied, NADPH-dependent CE synthetase is a 4-hydroxylase and significant 2-hydroxylation occurs only via the peroxidatic mechanism. We propose that 4-hydroxylated CEs, which are both potent, long acting estrogens and catechols, serve as local mediators of actions of phenolic estrogens on the AP.\r"

In 12 of these cells, 10(-5) M Ang II caused a 3.7 +/- 0.5-fold increase in [Ca2+]i. After 74 +/- 4 sec, [Ca2+]i returned to the resting levels (96.0 +/- 3.7 nM). Angiotensin I was without effect (n = 9). The effect of Ang II on [Ca2+]i changes could be completely blocked by a potent long-acting Ang II antagonist, [Sar1, Thr8]-angiotensin II, suggesting a receptor-mediated mechanism. The present results strongly indicate that rapid alterations in [Ca2+]i is an early step in the signal transduction of Ang II in a subpopulation of cells in the rat ovary.\r"

In order to gain insight into the significance of these carboxylterminal binding sites, we studied the effect of intact bovine PTH (1-84), its aminoterminal fragment bovine PTH (1-34), and the human PTH carboxylterminal fragment (53-84) on alkaline phosphatase activity in dexamethasone-treated rat osteosarcoma (ROS) 17/2.8 cells. While bovine PTH (1-84) and its aminoterminal 1-34 fragment inhibited alkaline phosphatase activity, we saw a dose-related stimulation of activity by human PTH (53-84), with maximal stimulation occurring after 120 hours, at a concentration of 10(-8) M. The effect was not seen in dexamethasone-untreated cells. To our knowledge, this is the first published demonstration of biological activity of this carboxylterminal PTH peptide, previously thought to be inactive. It is likely that dexamethasone caused differentiation of cells to a type more sensitive to human PTH (53-84). Further studies are necessary to elucidate the physiological significance of these findings.\r"

Diabetic rats had markedly increased food and Ca intake, so that their net Ca balance remained positive despite a 13-fold increase in urinary Ca excretion and a disappearance of active duodenal Ca absorption. Decreased duodenal Ca uptake correlated with decreased 1,25-(OH)2D3 levels (89 +/- 15 vs. 160 +/- 13 pg/ml in nondiabetic rats), decreased duodenal 9K Ca-binding protein concentrations (10 +/- 1 vs. 21 +/- 2 micrograms/mg protein), and decreased number of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3]-binding sites in duodenum, although the binding affinity was above normal. Nondiabetic Ca-supplemented rats exhibited a similar response: decreased 1,25-(OH)2D3 (95 +/- 8 pg/ml) and 9K Ca-binding protein (7 +/- 0.5 micrograms/mg protein) concentrations, decreased active duodenal Ca uptake, increased urinary Ca excretion, and a normal net Ca balance. Plasma vitamin D-binding protein levels were decreased by 62% in diabetic rats, due to a marked decrease in production rate, while the plasma half-time remained normal. The free 1,25-(OH)2D3 index was highest in diabetic rats, suggesting partial vitamin D resistance at the duodenal level. In semistarved rats, 1,25-(OH)2D3 levels and active Ca uptake remained normal, and the free 1,25-(OH)2D3 index was increased, together with suppressed vitamin D-binding protein levels. These studies indicate that nutritional abnormalities may contribute to but cannot totally explain the disturbances in vitamin D metabolism, transport, or action at the intestinal level.\r"

The induction of the cAMP response was at least partly reproduced when both serum and 5H were omitted from the medium. However the I- efflux response was completely abolished under such conditions and regenerated when serum or 5H was present. The serum or 5H effect on I- efflux response was mimicked by 2H (insulin + hydrocortisone). Insulin was replaced by 1/1000 less insulin-like growth factor-I than insulin. TSH-dependent Ca2+ mobilization of the cells was similarly affected by the presence of serum or 2H. However, the I- efflux and Ca2+ responses to an agonist other than TSH (extracellular ATP) were not substantially influenced by serum and/or 2H as well as TSH in the medium. The results indicate that serum or insulin-like growth factor-I plus hydrocortisone are required rather specifically for the regeneration of the TSH-receptor mechanism coupled with I- efflux and/or Ca2+ mobilization mechanism.\r"

Radioactively labeled microspheres were used to measure luteal blood flow in pseudopregnant rabbits in which estrogen had been withdrawn to initiate premature luteal regression and in pseudopregnant rabbits injected with hCG. Removal of estradiol-filled Silastic capsules on day 10 of pseudopregnancy caused an 80% decrease in the serum progesterone concentration within 24 h. Despite the decline in progesterone secretion, luteal blood flow remained at very high levels and was not different from that in control rabbits treated continuously with estradiol. Replacement of estradiol-filled capsules for 3 h did not change the high rate of blood flow to the corpus luteum, but blood flow in the uterus, vagina, and ovarian stroma was increased. The injection of hCG (10 IU, iv) on day 10 of pseudopregnancy caused a 3-fold increase in blood flow to the nonluteal portion of the ovary and a 3-fold increase in the serum progesterone concentration, but luteal blood flow did not change. We conclude that the acute actions of estradiol or hCG in the rabbit corpus luteum are not mediated by changes in luteal blood flow. Further, the results suggest that the luteal vasculature is regulated differently from the vasculature of other estrogen-responsive tissues and that blood flow in the nonluteal tissues of the ovary can be regulated independently of blood flow in the corpus luteum.\r"

  ".U": "89107036\r", 
  ".W": "The purpose of this study was 2-fold: 1) to use gonadal steroid hormone exposures in the physiological range to assess the relative roles of testosterone (T), estradiol (E2), and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the expression of male sexual behavior, and 2) to determine whether androgen receptor (AR) or estrogen receptor (E2R) occupation is increased after exposure to these various gonadal steroid hormones. Sexually experienced, castrated male rats implanted sc with Silastic capsules containing T, 10% E2, DHT, 10% E2 plus DHT, or blanks provided hormone levels in the physiological range. Copulatory behavior was measured on days 2-4, 5-7, 10-12, and 14-16 of steroid treatment. Although T, E2, and E2 plus DHT treatments all activated mounting, only T was effective in restoring ejaculation in 100% of the males. DHT alone had no effect on any aspect of male sexual behavior. Brains of males given these various hormone treatments were assayed for both cell nuclear AR and cell nuclear E2R binding in the hypothalamus, preoptic area, amygdala, and septum. Results indicate that when hormone levels in the physiological range were employed, T and DHT bind primarily to AR, whereas E2 binds to E2R. In a second experiment, 0.5% E2 plus DHT was found to yield AR and E2R levels comparable to those in rats receiving T capsules. Male rats bearing these capsules showed virtually no sexual behavior, demonstrating that elevation of AR and E2R levels comparable to those generated by T is not sufficient to induce male sexual behavior. We then measured intact AR and E2R levels and determined that in intact males E2R levels were higher than in T-treated males. These E2R levels could be replicated using 1.0% E2. Males exposed to 1.0% E2 plus DHT failed to display male sexual behavior. These data suggest that 1) relatively high and prolonged levels of E2R occupation are required for estrogen activation of male sexual behavior, 2) high levels of AR occupation induced by DHT are not sufficient to activate male sexual behavior, and 3) in intact male rats T, acting via androgen receptors, plays a primary role in mediating the expression of masculine sexual behavior.\r"

Analyses were performed on tissues taken on days 100 and 160 postconception. Five male and four or five female fetuses were examined at each stage. Brain tissues analyzed included medial basal hypothalamus (MBH), amygdala (AMG), cerebellum (CB), corpus callosum (CAL; splenial region), cerebral cortex (CTX), and cingulate cortex (CNG). In the following, enzyme activities are reported as picomoles per mg protein/h, while receptor levels are femtomoles per mg protein. 5 alpha R activity was measurable in all tissues. Analysis of variance revealed significant tissue differences [P less than 0.001, combined stages and sexes; CAL (2.05) greater than MBH (1.08) greater than AMG (0.63) greater than CB (0.4)-CNG-CTX-LNG-HRT-MUS (0.02); -indicates not significantly different]. A significant age x tissue interaction (P less than 0.001) was noted which could be explained by higher MBH and CAL levels in older vs. younger fetuses and higher AMG levels in younger vs. older fetuses. There was also a significant sex x tissue interaction which was attributed to higher female values in the MBH and CAL. AROM activity was detected in all tissues. Levels varied significantly among tissues [P less than 0.001, combined stages and sexes; MBH (0.80)-AMG (0.76) greater than CAL (0.4)-CNG-CB-CTX-LNG-HRT-MUS (0.07)]. Significant age (P less than 0.001) and age x tissue (P less than 0.001) effects were noted, which were due to higher MBH and AMG levels in younger vs. older fetuses. No sex difference in AROM levels was evident in any tissue. AR was measurable in all cases. Although stage and sex differences were not significant, tissue levels varied significantly [P less than 0.001; LNG (2.8)-MUS (2.6)-MBH (2.2) greater than HRT-AMG-CB-CTX-CAL-CNG (0.9)]. These findings indicate that neural and nonneural fetal primate tissues have the potential for transforming androgens to products that could have greater or lesser biological activity. AR were also noted through which dihydrotestosterone or testosterone could effect a genomic response. Since stage, tissue, and sex differences were evident in neural tissues, metabolic and receptor activities may be important for the normal differentiation of sexually dimorphic behavioral systems in monkeys as well as for potential teratogenic changes under abnormal metabolic or physiological conditions.\r"

We recently demonstrated that rat brain T3 content is increased by glucose feeding compared to chow feeding. One possible mechanism for this effect is an increase in brain T4 5'-deiodinase (5'-D) activity. Our recent preliminary studies of neuroblastoma (NB) cells demonstrate that renewal of RPMI-1640 medium stimulates T4 5'-D type II (NB T4 5'-D II) activity in these cells. The present studies were performed to determine the mechanism of this response. Studies were performed on NB cells supported in thyroid hormone-depleted (deficient) medium. This approach increased NB T4 5'-DII activity 4-fold compared to that in thyroid hormone-replete medium. Medium renewal further stimulated enzyme activity (7- to 9-fold; maximum at 6 h) in each group. The difference between the hypothyroid group and control was sustained over a 24-h period. Subsequent studies demonstrated that glucose (11 mM) was the specific medium ingredient mediating the medium renewal response. A progressive increase in NB T4 5'-DII activity was noted over 8 h during RPMI-1640 salt plus glucose (11 mM) incubation. This was equivalent to the effect of complete medium containing glucose (11 mM). Coincubation with insulin (10(-7)-10(-9) M) did not modify the enzyme response to glucose. In addition, fructose (10 mM) had a similar effect on enzyme activity. Glycerol and essential and nonessential amino acids also modestly increased NB T4 5'-DII activity compared to that in the control group (P less than 0.01). Actinomycin-D (1 microM), cycloheximide (100 microM), and puromycin (100 microM) significantly (P less than 0.001) decreased the glucose effect on T4 5'-DII by 5-, 9-, and 17-fold, respectively, after 6 h of incubation. In addition, puromycin (10-200 microM) inhibited both NB T4 5'-DII activity and [3H]amino acid incorporation during incubation in glucose. There was a significant correlation between these parameters (r = 0.8; P less than 0.001). The enzyme activity decay curves in the glucose-activated and control groups subsequent to puromycin (100 microM) addition at 8 h were parallel. The fractional turnover rate was 13%/h in the controls and 11%/h in the glucose groups. The calculated enzyme production rate was significantly higher (P less than 0.005) in the glucose group compared to that in the control group (17.4 vs. 6.8 fmol/mg protein.h).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Physiological comparison of PTHLP-(1-74) to [Tyr36]-PTHLP-(1-36) amide and bovine (b) PTH-(1-34) indicates that all three peptides are of equivalent potency in the fetal rat long bone and rat osteosarcoma 17/2.8 adenylate cyclase assays. However, as in earlier studies with native and N-terminal PTHLPs, PTHLP-(1-74) is considerably less potent (2%) in stimulating the canine renal cortical adenylate cyclase assay than is bPTH-(1-34). Further, PTHLP-(1-74) displayed only 12% of the activity of bPTH-(1-34) in inducing hypercalcemia when infused into rats in vivo. These studies support the possibility that subclasses of PTH receptors or varying PTH- and PTHLP-signalling transduction mechanisms may exist. In addition, they emphasize the need to precisely define the naturally occurring secretory and circulating species of this novel class of peptide hormones.\r"

  ".W": "Greater than 99% of the total circulating 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)2D] is bound to proteins such as the vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) and albumin; in the normal human only 0.4% of the circulating 1,25-(OH)2D is free. Although it is often assumed that only the free concentration of 1,25-(OH)2D is available to cells, this has not been demonstrated. In particular, it is not clear whether the DBPs facilitate 1,25-(OH)2D entry into target cells or serve only to transport these metabolites within the circulation. To address this question, we evaluated one of the best characterized target tissue responses to 1,25-(OH)2D, namely its ability to inhibit its own production and induce that of 24,25-(OH)2D, using one of the most sensitive cells, the human foreskin keratinocyte. We incubated keratinocytes in the presence of 1,25-(OH)2D (from 10(-11)-10(-8) M) in medium containing albumin (from 0.1-10%) or serum (from 0.1-10%) for 4 h [to inhibit the 25-hydroxyvitamin D (250HD) 1 alpha-hydroxylase] or 16 h (to induce the 250HD 24-hydroxylase) before evaluating [3H]250HD metabolism by these cells during a 1-h incubation in serum- and albumin-free medium. The free fraction of 1,25-(OH)2D was determined in each medium by centrifugal ultrafiltration and varied from 36% to 0.57% in direct proportion to the albumin or serum in the medium. Increasing the serum or albumin concentration in the medium increased the concentration of total 1,25-(OH)2D needed to inhibit its own production or stimulate that of 24,25-(OH)2D. In contrast, the concentration of free 1,25-(OH)2D needed to half-maximally inhibit its own production or induce 24,25-(OH)2D production remained constant at approximately 10(-11) M. We conclude that the free, not the total, 1,25-(OH)2D concentration regulates 250HD metabolism by keratinocytes, that DBPs do not facilitate 1,25-(OH)2D entry into the cell, and that these cells sense only free 1,25-(OH)2D.\r"

  ".W": "Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a potent secretagogue of GH in mature mammals. Although PGs are produced by the fetus and newborn of many species, the ontogeny of PGE2's GH stimulatory effect and the interaction of PGE2 with GHRF in the developing animal are not known. We examined the effects of 0.01-10 microM PGE2 and 0.01-10 nM rat GHRF, alone and in combination, on GH release from cultured pituitary cells of 2-day(d)-old, 7-d-old, 15-d-old, and adult (3- to 4-month-old) male rats (n = 4-7 experiments/age group). The effect of PGE2 on GH release was markedly age dependent. The GH response to all doses of PGE2 over 0.01 microM was greatest in pituitary cells of adult and 15-d-old rats and least in those of 2-d-old pups. PGE2 (0.1 microM) did not cause significant GH release from pituitary cells of 2-d-old pups (110 +/- 3% of control values), but increased that from 7-d-old, 15-d-old, and adult pituitary cells to 126 +/- 8%, 155 +/- 8%, and 156 +/- 9% of respective control values (by analysis of variance: F = 7.28; P less than 0.001). PGE2 (1 microM) increased GH release to 123 +/- 8%, 145 +/- 12%, 259 +/- 24%, and 260 +/- 17% of control values from pituitary cells of these same respective age groups (F = 12.3; P less than 0.001). The highest dose of PGE2 studied (10 microM) yielded similar results. The influence of PGE1 on GH release was also age dependent and similar to that of PGE2. In contrast to PGE2, GHRF stimulated GH release most in pituitary cells of 2-d-old pups and least in those of adults, similar to our previous observations with human GHRF-40. Coincubation with PGE2 and low dose GHRF resulted in partial additivity of GH response in adult rats, but no additivity in newborn pups. These results indicate that in rats, the sensitivity of the somatotroph to PGE2 increases with advancing age after birth. The contrasting developmental patterns of somatotroph sensitivity to PGE2 and GHRF support the concept that these GH secretagogues act, at least in part, by different intracellular mechanisms, which are subject to differential rates of maturation.\r"

It has a mol wt of 93,000, S value of 6.5, and pI of 4.5. Here we report studies on the binding of ASTP to histones from calf thymus. Higher salt concentrations were required to disrupt the binding of ASTP to histone-agarose than to disrupt its binding to the anion exchanger diethylaminoethyl-cellulose (half-maximal concentration for inhibition: 200 mM vs. 60 mM KCl). ATP decreased the binding of ASTP to histone-agarose in a dose-dependent fashion, but ADP and AMP had no appreciable effect on the binding. Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (10 mM) inhibited the binding of ASTP to histone-agarose, whereas 10 mM pyridoxal, pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate, pyridoxamine, and pyridoxine were not inhibitory. ASTP did not bind to histone-agarose that had been pretreated with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and then reduced with sodium borohydride. In contrast, ASTP pretreated in the same way could bind to histone-agarose. Therefore, modification of lysine residues of histones by pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (Schiff base) presumably inhibited the binding of ASTP to the immobilized histone. Competition experiments with various histones (H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) indicated that ASTP bound to the arginine-rich histones H3 and H4, with preference for H4. These observations together suggest that lysine residues in H4 and H3 are essential for the binding of ASTP to histone. The implications of this interaction are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "It is known that the neural mechanisms which control PRL and gonadotropin secretion are different in male and female rats. The present experiments have been designed in order to analyze: 1) whether sexual differences exist in the responses of PRL and LH to the opioid antagonist naloxone; and 2) the mechanisms underlying these possible differences. To this purpose the responses of PRL and LH to the sc injection of either saline (0.5 ml) or naloxone (2.5 mg/kg) have been tested in the following four groups of animals: 1) normal male rats; 2) normal female rats; 3) female rats treated on the second day of life with 1.25 mg testosterone (androgenized female rats); and 4) male rats orchidectomized 2 days postnatally (demasculinized male rats). The naloxone challenge has been provided when the animals were 16, 26, and 60 days old; the animals were killed in the afternoon 20 min after treatment. The results obtained have shown that the acute injection of naloxone significantly decreases serum levels of PRL in normal males and in androgenized females at all ages considered. On the contrary, the opioid antagonist was always ineffective in normal females and in neonatally castrated males. The treatment of male rats with naloxone was without any effect on LH release before puberty (at 16 and 26 days of age), but induced a significant increase of serum LH titers after sexual maturation (60 days). In normal females, naloxone brought about a significant increase of serum LH only at 16 and 60 days (animals in estrus), but not at 26 days. Treatment with naloxone did not exert any significant effect on LH release in androgenized females and in deandrogenized males of any age. The present data suggest that, in the rat a sexual difference exists in the opiatergic control of PRL secretion; apparently, the central opioid systems which regulate PRL secretion develop towards a male pattern because of the presence of androgens in the neonatal period. On the contrary neonatal androgens do not seem to exert any important effect in directing the organization of the opiatergic mechanisms controlling LH release.\r"

Glucocorticoid hyperpolarized the membrane potential of guinea pig ganglion neurons in vitro with a latency of less than 2 min. The effect persisted under low Ca2+/high Mg2+ superfusion conditions and could be abolished by RU38486, a competitive antagonist of glucocorticoid cytosolic receptor. Bovine albumin glucocorticoid conjugant exhibited the same effect. In neurons with spontaneous discharges the glucocorticoid-caused hyperpolarization of membrane potential decreased or eliminated the discharges. The results strongly suggest that glucocorticoid can act nongenomically through its neuronal membrane receptor. The steroid-induced hyperpolarization was accompanied by a change in the input resistance of the cell, indicating an involvement of some kind(s) of ion channel(s) in the action of glucocorticoid.\r"

  ".W": "Previous binding studies indicated that peptide-YY (PYY) and neuropeptide-Y (NPY) shared a common PYY-preferring receptor site in rat small intestinal epithelium. We showed here that PYY and NPY inhibited vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-stimulated cAMP production in epithelial cells isolated from rat small intestine and examined their structure-activity relationship. Inhibition of VIP-stimulated cAMP by PYY or NPY is time and dose dependent; half-maximal effects were observed for 10 and 107 nM, respectively. In contrast, the structurally related peptide, pancreatic polypeptide, was only active at 1 microM. PYY or NPY reduced the efficacy of VIP by about 50% without altering its potency. Both peptides also suppressed prostaglandin E1-, prostaglandin E2-, and forskolin-stimulated cAMP production and reduced basal cAMP levels. Their inhibitory effects were observed throughout the small intestine, including duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, but not in large intestine. PYY or NPY and epinephrine (through alpha 2-adrenergic receptors) did not exert additive inhibitory effects on intestinal cAMP production. Several fragments of PYY and NPY were used to characterize their structural requirement for inhibiting VIP-stimulated cAMP production and competing with [125I]PYY for binding to intestinal membranes. A highly significant correlation was observed between IC50 values measured in the two assays. No partial sequence of PYY retained the full activity of intact PYY, but the C-terminal portion of PYY was shown to be much more important than the N-terminal portion. Deletion of 21 amino acids from the N-terminus [PYY-(22-36)] only resulted in a 4- to 5-fold decrease in potency compared to that of PYY-(1-36). In contrast, PYY-(27-36) exhibited a drastic loss of potency. The N-terminal fragments PYY-(1-22) and PYY-(1-28) also had very low potencies. Similar results were obtained with NPY fragments. These results provide the first insight on the negative coupling of PYY-preferring receptors with the cAMP production system in small intestine and evidence of the crucial role of the C-terminal portion of PYY in interaction with these receptors.\r"

Purified pLH preparation (G-100 fraction 3) was dissociated into alpha- and beta-subunits, followed by isolation with reverse phase HPLC. Six components were isolated and analyzed for their amino acid compositions and amino-terminal amino acid sequences. alpha-Subunits were found to have heterogeneous N-terminal sequences, which started at Phe-1, Gly-4, Phe-6, or Thr-7. This N-terminal heterogeneity and the presence of the initial 6 amino acids has not been reported previously to the best of our knowledge. Moreover, the first 10 residues, Phe-Pro-Asp-Gly-Glu-Phe-Thr-Met-Gln-Gly, were identical with those of the ovine LH alpha subunit. At least 3 different beta-subunits were identified as heterogeneous in their carboxyl-terminal amino acids. The pLH preparation (G-100-fraction 3) was then chromatographed by an isoelectrofocusing (IEF) column. Four IEF fractions were obtained. Their amino acid structures appeared to be identical, as judged by the identical elution profiles on reverse phase HPLC, but their carbohydrate compositions were slightly different, especially in N-acetylgalactosamine in alpha-subunits. Thus, fractionation on IEF depended on the heterogeneity in carbohydrate structures. Each IEF fraction had different potencies in terms of its gonadotropic activity (in vitro) and renotropic activity (in vivo and in vitro). The discrepancy was observed not only between gonadotropic activity and renotropic activity, but also between in vivo and in vitro renotropic activity. This study identified the structural heterogeneity of pLH isoforms and demonstrated their biological heterogeneity. We concluded that the carbohydrate structure of the pLH isoform is important for expressing its biological heterogeneity (gonadotropic and renotropic activity.\r"

Aromatase activity was low (less than 0.2 pmol/h.mg protein) in gubernaculum at all ages studied, whereas the activity in postnatal ovary ranged from 3.9-20 pmol/h.mg protein. 5 alpha-Reductase activity was relatively high in day 18 fetal gubernaculum (approximately 115 pmol/h.mg protein), but 2 days later in development (fetal day 20), 5 alpha-reductase activity had declined to approximately 21 pmol/h.mg protein. 5 alpha-Reductase activity was very low (less than 10 pmol/h.mg protein) in the postnatal gubernaculum. Histological examination of day 18 fetal gubernaculum indicated that it is composed of dense, poorly organized, mesenchymal tissue. By day 20 of gestational development, primitive muscle cells are recognizable in the periphery of the gubernaculum, and by day 3 of postnatal development the gubernaculum is composed almost entirely of muscle. These findings suggest that 5 alpha-reductase activity may be located in the mesenchymal cells and may be important in early differentiation of the gubernaculum in the male. The administration of a 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor to pregnant rats from days 14-22 of gestation inhibited the normal growth rate of the gubernaculum, as assessed by measuring the protein content of the gubernaculum in control and treated rats, but did not have any profound effect on the histological development of the gubernaculum.\r"

We here report the RIA of plasma T3S in rats treated with the antithyroid drugs propylthiouracil (PTU) or methimazole (MMI), of which only PTU inhibits type I deiodinase. Male Wistar rats were treated acutely by ip injection with 1 mg PTU or MMI/100 g BW and subsequently for 4 days by twice daily injections with these drugs together with 0.5 microgram T4 or 0.25 microgram T3/100 g BW. Blood was obtained 4 h after the last injection, and plasma T4, rT3, T3, and T3S were determined by RIA and compared with pretreatment values. Serum concentrations (mean +/- SEM; nanomoles per liter) in untreated rats were: T4, 51 +/- 1; T3, 1.37 +/- 0.03; T3S, 0.09 +/- 0.01; and rT3, 0.03 +/- 0.002. Serum T3 was decreased, and T3S and rT3 were increased by acute PTU treatment [T3, 1.16 +/- 0.05 (P less than 0.01); T3S, 0.33 +/- 0.04 (P less than 0.001); rT3, 0.27 +/- 0.02 (P less than 0.001)], but unaffected by acute MMI treatment (T3, 1.37 +/- 0.05; T3S, 0.09 +/- 0.01; rT3, 0.02 +/- 0.003). In T4-treated rats, serum T3 was decreased and T4, T3S, and rT3 were increased by PTU vs. MMI [T4, 86 +/- 5 vs. 58 +/- 4 (P less than 0.001); T3, 0.51 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.88 +/- 0.06 (P less than 0.001); T3S, 0.38 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.12 +/- 0.01 (P less than 0.001); rT3, 0.86 +/- 0.19 vs. 0.08 +/- 0.01 (P less than 0.005)]. In T3-substituted rats T3S was increased by PTU vs. MMI (1.09 +/- 0.13 vs. 0.25 +/- 0.03; P less than 0.001). The T3S/T3 ratio in the PTU-treated T3 -replaced rats (0.60 +/- 0.09) was in agreement with that determined by HPLC of serum radioactivity in animals that in addition to this treatment also received about 10 microCi [125I]T3 with the last two injections (0.92 +/- 0.13). In conclusion, this investigation demonstrates the feasibility of the measurement of serum T3S by RIA. Our findings confirm previous observations with radioactive isotopes, suggesting that sulfation is an important pathway for the metabolism of T3 in rats. Analogous to rT3, the accumulation of T3S in PTU-treated rats indicates that this conjugate is metabolized predominantly by type I deiodination.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this study was to determine whether postnatal increases in rat Leydig cell number result from differentiation of precursor cells, division of existing Leydig cells, or both. Our approach was 1) to examine changes in the absolute number of Leydig cells and potential precursor cells (macrophages, pericytes, and mesenchymal, endothelial, and myoid cells) per testis on day 19 of gestation (day -2) and days 7, 14, 21, 28, and 56 postpartum; 2) to examine the frequency with which mesenchymal and Leydig cells divide during prenatal and postnatal development; and 3) to identify and examine the fate of the progeny of Leydig and mesenchymal cell divisions during prenatal and postnatal development. Stereological methods were used to show that mesenchymal cells comprised 44% of the total interstitial cell population and Leydig cells 16% on day -2, whereas by day 56 postpartum the relationship had reversed; mesenchymal cells comprised 3% and Leydig cells 49%. These results suggested a precursor-product relationship between mesenchymal and Leydig cells because no such reciprocal relationship was observed between Leydig cells and macrophages, pericytes, endothelial, or myoid cells. Autoradiographic analysis of [3H]thymidine incorporation into mesenchymal and Leydig cells was consistent with this interpretation. In a series of pulse-chase experiments, the percentage of labeled mesenchymal and Leydig cells was measured after a single injection of [3H]thymidine on days 2, 14, 28, and 56 postpartum, each followed by sampling at timed intervals (between 1 h and 14 days) thereafter. Starting on day 14, the percentage of labeled Leydig cells was approximately 1% immediately after injection of [3H]thymidine and increased significantly to approximately 6% by 6 days after injection. No such increase was observed when rats were similarly injected starting on days 2, 28, and 56 postpartum. The rise in Leydig cell labeling between days 14 and 28 postpartum did not result in a decline in the number of silver grains over labeled Leydig cell nuclei, indicating that the increase in the percentage of labeled cells was not caused by Leydig cell division. These observations led us to conclude that the increase in Leydig cell labeling from days 14 to 28 was the result of recruitment from a compartment of labeled mesenchymal cells. In contrast, our analysis indicated that from day 28 postpartum and thereafter until the mature number of Leydig cells is attained, Leydig cells are generated by division of morphologically recognizable Leydig cells.\r"

Analysis by gel filtration and sucrose density gradients revealed that the mol wt of the mutant receptor was 66K (38A; 3.8S) which was significantly smaller than the 110K (53A; 4.6S) size of the wild-type androgen receptor (P less than 0.05). Mixing experiments failed to demonstrate any role for differential proteolysis in the size differences between these receptors. Interaction of the mutant androgen receptor with specific polyclonal antiandrogen receptor antibodies produced significantly smaller immune complexes than that formed with wild-type receptor (12S vs. 17S; P less than 0.01). This confirmed the smaller size of the Tfm mutant androgen receptor and suggested that it contained fewer epitopes. The Tfm kidney cytosols also demonstrated a decreased concentration of androgen receptor-binding activity relative to that of the wild type. Together, these results suggest that the androgen insensitivity associated with the Tfm phenotype is due to a deficiency of androgen receptor in target tissues and a qualitative defect in the androgen receptor protein itself.\r"

We investigated the importance of NT release to the neural events that trigger the preovulatory LH surge and coincident PRL surge, using as our animal model ovariectomized (OVX) rats treated with estrogen and progesterone to induce reliable and robust surges. To interfere with the action of endogenous NT in the basal forebrain, we administered a NT antiserum (NTAS) in a series of bilateral microinjections aimed at the anterior border of the medial preoptic area. One week after OVX, rats bearing cerebral guide cannulae received Silastic capsules (3 x 15 mm; sc) containing 17 beta-estradiol. Two days later, beginning at 0830 h, conscious rats were administered either NTAS or control serum bilaterally in a series of four 100-nl injections spaced at 30-min intervals. After an initial blood sample, rats received progesterone (4 mg, sc) at 1200 h; blood samples were then taken at 1-h intervals from 1400-2100 h. Blood samples were obtained from conscious, freely moving rats via a chronic atrial catheter implanted previously. Plasma levels of LH and PRL were measured by RIA, and the location of microinjection sites was verified histologically. Administration of NTAS caused a 66% reduction in the magnitude of the LH surge without altering its timing, whereas the PRL surge was unaffected. These results provide strong evidence that NT in the basal forebrain participates in the steroid-induced LH surge and suggest that NT plays a role in the preovulatory LH surge.\r"

  ".U": "89107061\r", 
  ".W": "High extracellular Ca2+ stimulates the accumulation of inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol in parathyroid cells and suppresses PTH release. Since diacylglycerol is an endogenous activator of protein kinase-C, these observations would suggest that activation of protein kinase-C is associated with inhibition of PTH release. However, phorbol esters, which stimulate protein kinase-C activity, have been reported to enhance PTH release. To clarify the role of protein kinase-C in the regulation of PTH secretion, we studied the responses of parathyroid cells to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), bryostatin-1, and 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol (diC8). PMA and bryostatin-1 translocated protein kinase-C activity from the soluble to particulate fractions of cell homogenates. Phosphotransferase activity in the particulate fractions increased from 21 +/- 4% to 93 +/- 6% of the total activity after 10 min of exposure to PMA (10(-6) M) and from 21 +/- 2% to 69 +/- 2% after 5 min of exposure to bryostatin-1 (10(-7) M). These three structurally different agonists of protein kinase-C also altered the typical secretory response to Ca2+ in parathyroid cells. At 2.0 mM extracellular Ca2+, PMA (10(-6) M) bryostatin-1 (10(-7) M), and 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol (3 x 10(-4) M) blunted the suppressive effects of high Ca2+ on secretion, thus stimulating PTH release 252 +/- 45%, 122 +/- 20%, and 485 +/- 95% over control levels, respectively. However, at low extracellular Ca2+, these agents inhibited maximal PTH release. Since changes in the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) may be important in the control of PTH release, we investigated whether protein kinase-C agonists changed the relationship between extracellular Ca2+ and PTH release by affecting [Ca2+]i. In PMA-treated cells, the intracellular Ca2+ response to raising extracellular Ca2+ from 0.5 to 1.5 and 2.0 mM was reduced to 50 +/- 1% and 63 +/- 3% of that in control cells, respectively (P less than 0.005; n = 7-11). Specifically, PMA preincubation reduced the initial intracellular Ca2+ transient with raising extracellular Ca2+ from 0.5 to 2.0 mM and with adding 4.0 mM Sr2+. The sustained phase response to high Ca2+, but not to Sr2+, was also attenuated after incubation with PMA. We conclude that protein kinase-C agonists suppress PTH release at low extracellular Ca2+ and enhance PTH release at high extracellular Ca2+. The effects on secretion at high extracellular Ca2+ may be related to the ability of protein kinase-C agonists to change the sensitivity of [Ca2+]i to high extracellular Ca2+ in these cells.\r"

Nembutal (PB; 35 mg/kg, ip) was administered at 1130 h to intact proestrous animals to prevent the LH-stimulated release of ovarian P. Two hours later some of these intact rats were QVX to remove the endogenous ovarian steroids. Both intact and OVX rats were given exogenous P. All rats were killed on the following morning, and adenohypophysial binding of [3H]spiperone was evaluated at a saturating concentration. The binding in intact PB-blocked rats that received P was only 52% of that in PB-blocked rats that were OVX and received P. The binding of [3H]spiperone in PB-treated rats that were OVX and given P did not differ statistically from that in normal estrous rats. A parallel experiment was conducted on other rats that had been OVX 7 days before the sc implantation (on day 0) of Silastic capsules containing estradiol (E2). Two days later (day 2), some of these rats were injected with Nembutal at 1130 h. Two hours later, the E2 capsules of some rats were removed to simulate ovariectomy; Silastic capsules containing P were implanted into both E2-bearing and non-E2-bearing rats. All rats were killed the following morning (day 3), and the density of adenohypophysial DA receptors was assessed. Binding densities were greatest in rats bearing both E2 and P capsules and in rats from which E2 capsules were removed and replaced with P capsules. We conclude that treatment of OVX rats with the sequential combination of E2 and P increases the density of DA receptors in the anterior pituitary gland. However, in intact rats an additional ovarian product prevents the P-induced increase in the density of adenohypophysial DA receptors.\r"

When 3 micrograms VIP were injected into the third ventricle of conscious ovariectomized rats, a significant (P less than 0.005) and transient elevation of plasma oxytocin (OT) levels was observed. When OVX rats were injected iv with 1 ml anti-OT serum 30 min before the central administration of 3 micrograms VIP, the PRL surge seen after VIP injection in normal rabbit serum-treated controls was completely absent. The PRL surge seen after central VIP administration was not significantly altered by iv saline infusion (1 ml over 30 min) or by infusion of a VIP antagonist [D-4-Cl-Phe6,Leu17]VIP at a dose of 0.5 microgram/kg.min in 1 ml saline for 30 min before the VIP injection. This was not due to the inability of the VIP antagonist to block the PRL-releasing factor activity of VIP, since it significantly antagonized that action both in vitro and in vivo in the suckling stimulation paradigm. However, the PRL surge was completely absent in ovariectomized rats pretreated by iv infusion of an OT antagonist, [deamino Cys1,D-Trp2,Val4,Orn8]OT, at a similar dose. This recruitment of OT by VIP indicates that it may act at more than one locus within the hypothalamo-pituitary axis to insure the coordinated control of PRL secretion.\r"

Irreversible damage to muscle cells was induced in the extensor digitorum longus muscle of adult rats by ischemia, preceded by glycogen depletion. IGF-I mRNA levels during the regeneration process were studied for periods up to 10 days after injury using a solution hybridization assay. Increased IGF-I mRNA levels could be demonstrated within 24 h after injury; maximum levels were achieved in 3 days and decreased to approximately normal levels by 10 days. Changes in IGF-I mRNA levels could not be seen in undamaged contralateral extensor digitorum longus muscles during the experimental period. An increase in IGF-I mRNA was also evident in injured muscles of hypophysectomized animals. In situ hybridization at the time of maximum induction showed the presence of IGF-I mRNA in proliferating myoblasts and in satellite cells. IGF-I, thus, may act as a locally produced non-GH dependent trophic factor during regeneration of skeletal muscle after injury.\r"

Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography revealed two SRIF-binding proteins with apparent mol wt (Mr) of 69,000 and 66,000 that were selectively labeled by the four cross-linking agents. When cross-linking was performed with N-5-azido-2-nitrobenzoyloxysuccinimide, both proteins migrated as a broad band centered at 68,000; however, with N-hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-azidobenzoate, the band was resolved into 69,000 and 66,000 Mr components. N-Succinimidyl-6-(4'-azido-2'-nitrophenylamino) hexanoate covalently labeled the 69,000 Mr protein and a minor species with a Mr of 45,000-47,000. Cross-linking with disuccinimidyl suberate labeled only the 66,000 Mr band. Labeling of both bands was specific, since affinity labeling with each of the four agents was abolished when 1 microM cyclic SRIF was included in the binding reaction. Binding of [125I-Tyr11]SRIF to membranes and labeling of the 69,000 and 66,000 Mr SRIF-binding species were similarly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by unlabeled SRIF. Radiolabeling of both proteins was specifically displaced by 1 microM SRIF-28 and [D-Trp8,D-Cys14]SRIF, but not by oxytocin. Moreover, the extent of radiolabel incorporation into both components was dependent on the concentration of [125I-Tyr11]SRIF in the binding reaction. These results demonstrate the presence of two SRIF-binding proteins in rat anterior pituitary membranes that show characteristics of the SRIF receptor.\r"

Both Ca2+ and Mg2+ produced dose-dependent increases in IP4 in the presence of Li+, with maximal 19- and 4-fold increases with 5.0 mM Ca2+ and 20 mM Mg2+, respectively. A 50% rise in IP4 was evident within 1 min in response to 5.0 mM Ca2+. In the absence of Li+, a 2-fold increase in IP4 was seen with 5.0 mM Ca2+ only after 15 min. Fluoride ion generated a dose-dependent increase in IP4, with a 48% rise at 10 mM F-, presumably by activating phospholipase-C through a guanine nucleotide regulatory (G) protein-dependent process. We conclude that inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate generated in response to high extracellular Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations can be converted to IP4 in parathyroid cells. The slow kinetics for the increase in IP4 with high Ca2+ in the absence of Li+, however, do not support a role for IP4 in the early phase of the sustained increase in cytosolic Ca2+ produced by high extracellular Ca2+ concentrations.\r"

  ".W": "The wide central nervous system (CNS) distribution of somatostatin (SRIF) as well as the well documented reduction in SRIF concentration in the cerebral cortex in patients with Alzheimer's disease have served as an impetus for studies of this peptide's neurobiological role in the brain. These studies were designed to evaluate the efficacy of centrally administered cysteamine (CYS) as a tool to deplete SRIF in the hypothalamus (HYP) and extrahypothalamic brain areas. Somatostatin was measured by RIA in the frontal cortex (COR), hippocampus (HIP), and HYP in rats after seven daily infusions of CYS into unilateral cannulae stereotaxically positioned into either the lateral ventricle (LV; 300 micrograms/2 microliters) or the dorsal HIP (100 micrograms/2 microliters), and after single (300 mg/kg) or daily (100 mg/kg) sc injections; rats were killed 4 or 24 h after the last injection. After LV infusions, the SRIF concentration was significantly reduced only in the HYP (35% at 4 h and 27% at 24 h). After HIP infusions, the SRIF concentration was significantly reduced only in the HYP at 4 h (23%); no reductions were observed at 24 h. Both a single and repeated sc administrations of CYS reduced SRIF in the HYP only 24 h after treatment (54% and 50%, respectively). Acute sc CYS reduced SRIF in the COR (23%) and the HYP (29%) 4 h after treatment; repeated sc CYS reduced SRIF in the COR (25%) and the HYP (63%). Although the reduction of SRIF in the HYP was increased by repeated sc dosing, the reduction of extrahypothalamic SRIF by sc CYS was relatively small in magnitude and was not enhanced by repeated dosing. These results suggest that CYS is not an ideal tool for depletion of extrahypothalamic SRIF after sc or CNS administration and, moreover, raise serious questions about studies in which behavioral or endocrine alterations after CYS treatment were attributed to specific actions on SRIF-containing neurons.\r"

  ".W": "Human trophoblastic cells synthesize and secrete hCG as well as uncombined forms of the alpha- and beta-subunits of hCG. We have previously reported that the rate-limiting step in alpha beta-dimer assembly in cultured JAR choriocarcinoma cells is a conformational change in beta-subunit accompanied by the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds. We now report on the intermediate steps in the acquisition of this combinable conformation by the beta-subunit. The earliest biosynthetically labeled form of beta detected in JAR cells is a precursor termed p beta 1 that lacks at least one of the intramolecular disulfide bonds found in mature beta-subunit, that does not combine with alpha-subunit, and that does not react with a monoclonal antibody specific for free beta. The p beta 1 precursor rapidly assumes (within 5 min) a new conformation termed p beta 2 that, in contrast to p beta 1, migrates more slowly on nonreduced sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, combines with alpha to form the hCG dimer, and reacts with the monoclonal anti-free beta antibody. Pulse-chase kinetic experiments support the following sequence of events: p beta 1----uncombined p beta 2----combined p beta 2. The transition of p beta 1 to uncombined p beta 2 involves the formation of at least one intramolecular disulfide bond coincident with the conformational shift of the p beta molecule. Furthermore, treatment of the nonreduced subunits with trypsin releases a [35S]cysteine-labeled peptide from p beta 1, but not from either form of p beta 2. This peptide presumably contains one of the two crucial cysteine residues that participate in forming the disulfide bond that distinguishes p beta 1 from the p beta 2 forms. Dimer p beta 2 differs from both p beta 1 and uncombined p beta 2 in that it contains an O-linked N-acetylgalactosamine, which represents the first step in the formation of the O-linked glycans of beta-subunit. Dimer p beta 2 is, therefore, the most fully processed and kinetically the latest of the three p beta forms that appear in JAR cell lysates. We conclude that formation of an appropriate array of intramolecular S-S bonds accompanies the acquisition of a combinable conformation of beta-subunit, and we have identified intermediate steps in the pathway leading to this conformational change. The data suggest that it is the achievement of this conformation by beta-subunit that limits the alpha beta combination reaction rather than the amount or conformation of alpha-subunit.\r"

A monoclonal antibody (MAb) was produced against partially purified SMP. The antibody was immunoglobulin G1 relatively specific for multiplication-stimulating activity III-2 (rat IGF-II), with a Kd value of 5.6 X 10(-9) M. The antibody showed 100% cross-reactivity with human IGF-II and 10% cross-reactivity with human IGF-I, but did not cross-react with insulin. For purification of SMP, therefore, immunoaffinity chromatography on Sepharose coupled with the MAb was used besides a procedure including ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and reverse phase HPLC. The purified SMP (at least five polypeptides) each gave a single peak on reverse phase HPLC and appeared as a single band with an apparent mol wt of 5000-8000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The major components of SMP (designated HP1-SMP and HP3-SMP), which were purified about 100-fold from conditioned medium, stimulated DNA synthesis in human fibroblasts in culture and sulfation in chick embryonic cartilage in culture. These polypeptides showed almost the same cross-reactivity as multiplication-stimulating activity III-2 on RIA with the MAb. The partial amino acid sequences of HP1- and HP3-SMP were determined, and these polypeptides were identified with rat IGF-II.\r"

The PRL secretory responses of ovariectomized rats to the dopamine antagonist domperidone (DOM) were higher at 0300 and 1700 h than at 1200 h. These are the times during which surges of PRL appear in mated rats. This experimental paradigm was used to investigate the roles of the putative PRL-releasing factors (PRFs) oxytocin (OT), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and serotonin (5-HT) in this rhythm. The role of OT was studied by infusion of the OT antagonist 1-deamino-2-D-Trp-4-Val-8-Orn-Oxytocin (OT-A, 0.5 microgram/kg min) for 6 h. Two hours after beginning the OT-A infusion DOM was administered, as a single injection of 200 micrograms/kg iv at either 0300, 1200, or 1700 h. Serial blood samples were collected immediately before and 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 min after DOM administration. Infusion of OT-A attenuated the heightened PRL secretory responses to DOM given at both 0300 and 1700 h but did not affect the response at 1200 h. The role of VIP was studied by infusing the VIP antagonist [D, 4-Cl-Phe6,Leu17] VIP (VIP-A, 0.1 microgram/kg.min) as described above. VIP-A infusion had no effect on the PRL secretory responses to DOM given at 1200 or 1700 h but attenuated the heightened response at 0300 h. In order to study the role of 5-HT in the rhythm, rats were pretreated with p-chlorophenylalanine (250 mg/kg sc) 48 and again 24 h before the experiment. Pretreatment with p-chlorophenylalanine had no effect on the PRL secretory responses to DOM given at 0300 or 1200 h, but it attenuated the augmented PRL secretory response at 1700 h. These data suggest that both VIP and OT act as endogenous PRFs at 0300 h and 5-HT and OT act as PRFs at 1700 h. We propose that VIP and 5-HT are continuously active oscillatory neurotransmitters regulating OT release into pituitary portal blood and that these daily events only eventuate in PRL release when the mating stimulus has release the lactotroph from the inhibitory effects of dopamine.\r"

  ".W": "Steroid sulfurylation represents a potential mechanism for controlling the level of active steroids within a tissue. We have elucidated an inbred strain background-dependent interaction between the diabetes (db) mutation and steroid sulfotransferase (ST) enzymes, potentially modulating the level of active steroid hormones or their precursors in the liver. Gonadectomized mutants were analyzed to correlate how strain- and gender-dependent variation in ST activities interacted with db to achieve diabetogenesis. Both sexes on the C57BL/KsChp (BKs) background developed severe early-onset hyperglycemia, and gonadectomy failed to prevent diabetes. In contrast, C3HeB/FeChp (C3HeB)-db/db males, but not females, were diabetes susceptible, and the male susceptibility was completely dependent upon endogenous testes-derived testosterone. The female resistance, in turn, was dependent upon ovarian sex steroids. The differential requirements of BKs- and C3HeB-db/db males and females for gonadal sex steroids could be explained on the basis of the differential strength of the interaction between the db mutation and hepatic ST activities. Hepatic ST from normal adult females sulfurylated dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), whereas this activity disappeared in cytosols of normal adult males by 8 weeks of age. This sexually dimorphic inability to sulfurylate (pre)androgens was controlled by testosterone. Diabetogenic susceptibility in BKs mutant mice of both sexes was associated with marked depression of preandrogen/androgen sulfurylation [female mutants exhibiting at least a 5-fold reduced DHEA sulfurylation at a near-physiological concentration (0.2 microM)]. This reduced preandrogen/androgen sulfurylation occurred concomitant with a 10-fold acceleration of estrone (E1) sulfurylation at a limiting (0.2 microM) concentration, essentially producing a hyperandrogenized hepatic tissue state. These extreme shifts in ST substrate preferences were not observed in the diabetes-resistant C3HeB-db/db females. Kinetic analysis of semipurified hepatic ST from BKs-db/db females showed a 10-fold decrease in Km for E1 (apparent Km = 0.9 microM in mutants vs. 9.0 microM in normals). Whereas the Km for DHEA did not differ from the control value, hepatic ST from BKs-db/db females showed a 10-fold decreased maximal velocity for DHEA sulfurylation (1230 vs. 12750 pmol/mg.h in control preparations). The antihyperglycemic effects of dietary E1 therapy were associated with enhanced androgen sulfurylation in BKs-db/db females and restoration of androgen sulfurylation in BKs-db/db males.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

We have also delineated regions of hCG alpha comprising the epitope recognized by HT13 which was raised against hCG and binds to hCG and hCG alpha. To define the residues involved in the antigenic sites recognized by ECG01 and HT13, we have studied the reactivities of these two MAbs with native or chemically modified LH and CG with subunits from equine, human, or ovine (o) species or with synthetic peptides analogous to various portions of hCG alpha. We have also compared these reactivities with those displayed by MAbs AHT20 and FA 36, whose epitopes have been previously described; anti-hCG alpha MAb AHT20 is specific for the free alpha-subunits of various species and recognizes residues localized to the 36-41 region of hCG alpha, whereas antipeptide MAb FA36 binds to the 87-92 carboxyl-terminal part of hCG alpha. Our results show that the epitopes of HT13 and ECG01 are 1) probably discontinuous, as these MAbs did not bind to the reduced and S-carboxymethylated hCG alpha; and 2) constituted by residues borne on the 1-35 and 52-86 sequences, as they do recognize the hCG alpha core missing the 36-51 portion, yet do not recognize hCG alpha-(87-92) region recognized by FA36. The comparative studies performed with specific two-site immunoradiometric assays to determine the interspecies cross-reactivities of the MAbs allow us hypothetical assignment of residues on the primary structure of hCG alpha. The antigenic site recognized by ECG01 might include two to six amino acids, four of these residues being located at inverted places compared to those of oLH alpha (Asp6/Gly22 and Arg67/Lys75). These residues present important charged functional groups highly conserved among evolutionarily related variants, and it is likely that they are located on the surface of both the intact hormone and its alpha-subunit. Three peptidic portions of hCG alpha, 16-17, 64-66, and 73-76, respectively, might be involved in the epitope recognized by HT13, although we could not rule out the possibility that other residues were also involved in the antigenic site. These observations allow us to identify several residues as potentially constituting the epitopes recognized by two MAbs on both hCG and hCG alpha.\r"

  ".W": "Interactions between thyroid hormone and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] were examined in a rat pituitary tumor cell line, GH4C1. Cells were incubated in thyroid hormone-depleted medium for 2 days, and specific nuclear binding of [125I]T3 was measured. 1,25-(OH)2D3 decreased nuclear [125I]T3 binding without changing total cellular uptake of [125I]T3. This 1,25-(OH)2D3 effect required 2-3 h to become evident and 24 h to reach a maximum (40-50% of control) and was reversible. Treatment with 1,25-(OH)2D3 for 8 h changed the maximal binding capacity for [125I]T3 from 80.2 +/- 2.9 to 50.3 +/- 6.3 fmol/10(6) cells, whereas Kd was not significantly altered. The decrease in [125I]T3 binding was dose dependent, with an IC50 for 1,25-(OH)2D3 of 1 nM in thyroid hormone-depleted medium. 1,25-(OH)2D3 caused little change in [125I]T3 binding to isolated nuclei, i.e. 1,25-(OH)2D3 does not compete directly with [125I]T3 for binding. It is unlikely that 1,25-(OH)2D3 decreased [125I]T3 binding by increasing the concentration of intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i), since 1,25-(OH)2D3 did not change [Ca2+]i in Indo-I-loaded GH4C1 cells. Two major species (6 and 2.6 kilobases) of mRNA for c-erb-A, which have been reported to encode nuclear thyroid hormone receptors, were found by Northern blot analysis, and both were decreased by treatment with 1,25-(OH)2D3 for 8 h. T3 (2 nM) caused a 3-fold increase in GH production over 72 h and 1,25-(OH)2D3 inhibited GH induction by T3, with an IC50 at approximately 1 nM. 1,25-(OH)2D3 stimulated PRL synthesis 5-fold when 10 nM T3 was present, but not when T3 was absent. In summary, 1,25-(OH)2D3 caused a dose-dependent down-regulation of nuclear thyroid hormone receptors at a pretranslational level and diminished GH induction by T3. These results suggest that 1,25-(OH)2D3 inhibits GH synthesis indirectly, at least partly, by attenuating endogenous thyroid hormone action.\r"

  ".U": "89107081\r", 
  ".W": "Hypothyroidism was induced in young female Sprague-Dawley rats by the addition of methimazole (0.67 mg/ml) to drinking water for a period of 7 weeks (7-14 weeks of age). The responses of the articular cartilage, epiphyseal growth plate cartilage, epiphyseal trabecular bone, and metaphyseal trabecular bone in the proximal tibia were assessed by structural parameters. In addition, replacement therapies were introduced for the last 2 weeks of the experimental period. These included 0.7 U/kg BW human GH (hGH), 15 micrograms/kg BW L-T4 (T4), and a combination of hGH and T4 at the same doses. In the hypothyroid rats, the width of epiphyseal growth plate cartilage decreased by 27%, that of articular cartilage by 35%, epiphyseal trabecular bone volume by 30%, and metaphyseal trabecular bone volume by 66% relative to those in age-matched control tissues. T4 treatment led to a full restoration of the epiphyseal trabecular bone and surpassed by 40% the control value. The magnitude of the articular cartilage and the epiphyseal trabecular bone volume returned to control values, while that of metaphyseal trabecular bone was 68% of control values. Treatment with hGH did not improve the epiphyseal growth plate cartilage or articular cartilage. It did restore epiphyseal trabecular bone to almost normal values, but metaphyseal trabecular bone improved to only a small though significant level (45% of control value). The combination of T4 and hGH resulted in an additional enlargement in the width of the epiphyseal growth plate cartilage and an increase in metaphyseal trabecular bone volume compared to those in the T4 group. Qualitative examinations indicated that it was only in the T4 and T4 plus hGH groups that the lowest chondrocytes in the epiphyseal growth plate cartilage resumed their normal hypertrophied size. These results suggest that the change in the hypothyroid state do not rely solely on the lack of pituitary GH synthesis and secretion, as replacement by exogenous GH did not restore normal epiphyseal growth plate cartilage morphology or its remodeling into metaphyseal trabecular bone. Treatment with T4 (which restored endogenous pituitary GH to 30% of control levels) results in full recovery of the epiphyseal growth plate cartilage morphology along with its associated metaphyseal trabecular bone. In addition, it can also be concluded that the decrease in epiphyseal trabecular bone volume observed in the hypothyroid animals was due solely to the GH-deficient state that accompanied hypothyroidism.\r"

We investigated LH/hCG-dependent desensitization of adenylyl cyclase in rabbit or pig ovarian follicular membranes and included adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate to prevent nucleotide triphosphate degradation. It was found that GTP supported LH/hCG-induced desensitization with an apparent Km of approximately 0.1 microM in rabbit or pig ovarian membranes. Other nucleotide triphosphates were 100-1000 times less potent than GTP in supporting desensitization. Several nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs and the GDP analog guanosine-5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) would not support hCG-induced desensitization of ovarian adenylyl cyclase. Instead, these guanine nucleotide analogs were all inhibitors of GTP-supported hormone-dependent desensitization. Cholera toxin had no effect on LH-dependent desensitization. These results establish that GTP is the preferred nucleotide for homologous desensitization of the LH/hCG-sensitive adenylyl cyclase and that the GTP-dependent mechanism differs from that typically associated with guanine nucleotide-binding proteins. The GTP-dependent mechanism of desensitization of the LH receptor distinguishes it from the ATP-dependent desensitization of the beta-adrenergic receptor.\r"

  ".W": "Cellular uptake of T3 was examined using rat H4 hepatoma cells. Uptake of [125I]T3 (10(-11) M) from serum-free medium was measured as the cell-associated counts retained by washed cells (2 X 10(6) per well). Displaceable uptake was 84% of total uptake at 2 min (2.9% of total counts). T4, tetraiodothyroacetic acid, triiodothyroacetic acid, rT3, and D-T3 were 2-5% as effective as T3 in displacing uptake. Nonequilibrium kinetics indicated a half-maximal uptake at 680 nM T3 with approximately 7 million sites per cell. Displaceable uptake was time and temperature dependent and was 73% inhibited by 2 mM KCN and 52% by 10 mM bacitracin but not by 2 mM ouabain or 10 microM cytochalasin B. Phloretin, 100 microM, inhibited uptake by 66%. T3 uptake was directly related to the free T3 concentration over the range of albumin concentrations, 0-10 g/liter. The nonbile acid cholephil compounds, bromosulfophthalein, iopanoic acid, and indocyanine green (all 100 microM) inhibited T3 uptake to 62%, 17%, and 5% of control, respectively. Taurocholate, methylaminoisobutyric acid, and oleic acid were noninhibitory. The half-inhibitory concentrations of reactive nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs were: meclofenamic acid (25 microM), mefenamic acid (45 microM), fenclofenac (69 microM), flufenamic acid (100 microM), and diclofenac (230 microM). Aspirin, ibuprofen, oxyphenbutazone, and phenylbutazone (all 100 microM) were noninhibitory. Diphenylhydantoin inhibited uptake to 50% at 75 microM. These findings suggest that T3 uptake by cultured rat hepatocytes is by an energy-dependent, saturable, stereo-selective mechanism that is dependent on cell membrane proteins. This mechanism appears to be shared by a number of other ligands, including nonbile acid cholephils and several nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs of the anthranilic and phenylacetic acid classes, as well as diphenylhydantoin. The bile acid taurocholate, oleic acid, and a probe for type A amino acid uptake were inactive. The extent to which these effects may modify expression of thyroid hormone action remains to be established.\r"

The alpha and beta-B subunit mRNAs varied significantly in different stages, the highest levels of both alpha and beta-B subunit expression were seen in stages XIII-I and the lowest in stages VII-VIII. The hybridization signals obtained with beta-actin probe were not significantly different between different stages indicating that the differences in the quantities of subunit mRNAs in different stages were not due to different amounts of RNA blotted. beta-A subunit mRNA levels were below the detection limit of the filter hybridization method. These data demonstrate that expression of inhibin alpha and beta-B subunits in the rat testis is stage dependent and suggest a paracrine role for inhibin-related peptides in regulation of spermatogenesis.\r"

Lactotransferrin, however, was induced by estrogen in a time- and dose-dependent fashion in the uterus of the immature mouse, but was not affected by estrogen in the mammary gland. Differences were also found in the expression of lactotransferrin in mammary glands and uteri of adult females during lactation. A high level of the protein was detected by immunocytochemistry in uterine epithelial cells 1 day after parturition, but immunoreactivity disappeared quickly thereafter. Lactotransferrin message was, however, relatively abundant in the mammary gland at the end of the lactation period. The presence of lactotransferrin in various tissues also was investigated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. Two forms of immunoreactive material was detected by this method; a 70K band was found in uterine luminal fluid from the estrogen-stimulated immature mouse and in homogenates of lung, vagina, mammary gland, oviduct, spleen, lymph node, and uterus of the adult female mouse, and a 65K band was detected in submaxillary gland, kidney, ovary, and all of the above tissues. Brain and duodenum had no detectable immunoreactive material. A transient appearance of lactotransferrin was observed in the uterine luminal fluid of pseudopregnant mice. These changes in the level of lactotransferrin in the uterus and mammary gland under various physiological conditions suggest that the regulation of this protein's expression is tissue specific.\r"

The latency to onset of clonic seizures did not change with age, however, in either GEPRs or normal rats. A different pattern of response was observed in the progression to tonic seizures. As normal animals matured, the latency to tonic seizures became longer and, by day 30, the duration of flurothyl exposure necessary to induce tonus was almost 70% greater in normal rats than in the GEPRs. In contrast, in GEPRs, tonic extension occurred immediately following the onset of clonus throughout development. A subset of GEPRs failed to have audiogenic seizures in a 40-day posttest. These animals had a flurothyl response identical to their audiogenic-susceptible litter mates. These data suggest that (a) a protective mechanism which develops against tonic seizures in normal rats fails to mature in the GEPR, and (b) seizure inducing gene-linked neural abnormalities occur in the GEPR independent of pathologies underlying audiogenic seizures.\r"

Antiabsence AEDs are generally effective against seizures induced in experimental animals by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) and methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM), drugs which reduce GABAergic inhibition. Thus, antiabsence AEDs have been suggested to enhance GABAergic inhibition. We studied the effects of several AEDs on GABA responses recorded from mouse spinal cord neurons grown in primary dissociated cell culture. Four antiabsence AEDs were included: ethosuximide (ESM), dimethadione (DMO), sodium valproate (VPA), and diazepam (DZP). Two experimental AEDs, CGS 9896 and ZK 91296, with anticonvulsant action against PTZ- or DMCM-induced seizures were also included. Possible effects of the antiabsence and experimental AEDS on PTZ- and DMCM-induced inhibition of GABA responses were also evaluated. PTZ and DMCM reversibly reduced GABA responses in a concentration-dependent manner. PTZ completely inhibited GABA responses at 10 mM (IC50 of 1.1 mM), whereas DMCM-induced inhibition of GABA responses reached a plateau level of 39% of control values at 1 microM (IC50 of 33 nM). ESM (1,200 microM), DMO (6 mM), VPA (200 microM), CGS 9896 (2 microM), and ZK 9896 (2 microM) did not alter GABA responses. DZP enhanced GABA responses in a concentration-dependent manner. The inhibition of GABA responses produced by PTZ 1 mM was unaltered by ESM (600 microM), DMO (6 mM), CGS 9896 (1 microM), or ZK 9896 (1 microM). Coapplication of VPA (200 microM) and PTZ (1 mM) slightly enhanced the PTZ effect. DZP (greater than 10 nM), however, reversed the PTZ-induced reduction of GABA responses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although regional distribution of [3H]CHA and [3H]forskolin binding sites differed in some areas, chronic CBZ as well as chronic caffeine upregulated both of them. The changes in receptor densities occurred in the same brain microregions, suggesting that caffeine and CBZ act as antagonists at similar subpopulations of adenosine A1 receptors and [3H]forskolin binding sites. Therefore, a selective interaction of these two drugs with distinct adenosine A1 receptors (and adenylate cyclase) probably does not explain the differential effects of caffeine and CBZ on neuronal activity.\r"

We studied the effects of administration of high-dose naloxone, an opiate antagonist, on postictal prolactin levels, seizure duration, and postictal behavior, using patients undergoing electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) as a seizure model. Seven patients had 8 mg naloxone injected prior to one ECT treatment and saline injected prior to another treatment, with the order of injection randomized. Before ECT and 15 min after ECT, prolactin levels were drawn, and no blunting of the expected postictal prolactin elevation by naloxone injection was observed. We found no evidence that endogenous opiates trigger prolactin secretion during seizures. Seizure duration was also similar in saline and naloxone groups, and naloxone did not reverse postictal depression, as has been reported in an animal model.\r"

All treatments produced a significant impairment (p less than 0.001) of SEM function as compared with a group of controls. SEM abnormalities appeared to change in relation to daily fluctuation of CBZ plasma levels. When the SEM parameters were considered separately, PB showed a significantly (p less than 0.001) more relevant sedative effect, whereas both drugs appear to produce the same effect on cerebellar and pontine functions. Although impairment of SEM function was most likely far from reaching clinical significance, it represents important information for the clinician.\r"

These findings extend previous work showing differential antiepileptic drug (AED) effects on temporal lobe and absence seizures. The results are also consistent with recent work suggesting that thalamocortical pathways provide a final common pathway for the manifestation of sleep and awakening epilepsy and also reflect a chronic, latent pathophysiology.\r"

Gastric lavage revealed no pill fragments, and activated charcoal was administered. CBZ level initially fell, reaching 28 mg/L 36 h after admission. Blood level then rose sharply, reaching 54 mg/L 64 h after admission. The pattern of rise suggested renewed absorption of drug. Vigorous cathartics were given, and further doses of charcoal were administered. Three hours after onset of diarrhea, roving eye movements occurred. Two hours later she grimaced to pain. Eight hours after the onset of diarrhea, she was awake. In CBZ overdose, activated charcoal therapy coupled with aggressive intestinal purging helps prevent continued absorption of drug, late exacerbation of symptoms, and potentially fatal outcome.\r"

The prevalence was highest in children aged 1-4 years. Overall, males had a slightly higher prevalence rate than females (M:F = 1.1). However, the male/female ratio varied by age, with the group aged less than 1 year having the highest ratio (M:F = 1.5), and by type of epilepsy, with males having higher rates of simple partial epilepsy (M:F = 1.8) and infantile spasms (M:F = 1.5). The prevalence of epilepsy was higher in blacks than in whites. Differences in prevalence by race were confined primarily to generalized epilepsies (B:W = 1.8). The most common types of epilepsy were tonic, clonic, and tonic-clonic (1.14 per 1,000), complex partial (0.39 per 1,000), and partial seizures secondarily generalized (0.33 per 1,000). Approximately 70% of cases were considered idiopathic. Among the presumed causes were perinatal factors (7%), trauma (4%), central nervous system (CNS) infection (3%), and congenital/developmental factors (3). Sixty-five percent of cases had at least one additional medical problem. The most common types of comorbidity were motor handicap (13%) and developmental delay (24%).\r"

Of the 243 infertility patients, 168 (69.1%) achieved pregnancy. The pregnancy rates were 71.8% in 39 patients with stage I disease, 69.8% in 86 patients with stage II disease, 67.2% of 67 patients with stage III disease, and 68.6% in 51 patients with stage IV disease. The life table and two-parameter exponential model were used to calculate monthly fecundity, \"cure,\" and \"probability of pregnancy\" rates. The results indicate that videolaseroscopic treatment of endometriosis associated with infertility, in surgically experienced hands, is at least as efficacious as other forms of therapy for mild and moderate cases of disease, but appears to be more successful than laparotomy for the more severe and extensive stages of disease.\r"

Neither the cornual pathology nor the presence of adnexal adhesions adversely affected the pregnancy rate. Associated infertility factors reduced the chances of conceiving. These factors should give a reliable prognosis to aid in the direction of postoperative management, particularly with regard to in vitro fertilization.\r"

The authors recently demonstrated that, in normal women, the vaginal route of administration was an effective and safe alternative to oral bromocriptine. To evaluate the effectiveness of vaginal bromocriptine in treating women with hyperprolactinemia, the authors treated 15 hyperprolactinemic women with daily vaginal administration of 2.5 mg tablets of bromocriptine. Serum prolactin (PRL) levels and vital signs were measured daily for 6 days, then weekly for 4 weeks. Gastrointestinal side effects were limited to a single episode of mild nausea, and two cases of transient constipation. In all patients there was a dramatic initial reduction in PRL in response to a single 2.5 mg dose of bromocriptine. In 13 patients PRL levels were maintained within the normal range with daily administration of 2.5 mg, whereas in two patients, PRL levels remained higher than normal despite an increase in bromocriptine dose to 5 mg. These results suggest that short term use of vaginal bromocriptine is a safe and effective method of therapy for hyperprolactinemia.\r"

  ".W": "Two hundred twenty consecutive in vitro fertilization (IVF) conception cycles were studied prospectively in order to examine the predictive value of serum human chorionic gonadotropin beta-subunit (beta-hCG), estradiol (E2), and progesterone (P) in predicting pregnancy outcome between 2 and 4 weeks after oocyte collection. To examine the predictive value of each hormone in predicting clinical pregnancy outcome, each patient's result at each week was assigned a scoring system based on the 25th percentile value of the concentration of beta-hCG, E2, and P in ongoing singleton IVF pregnancies for each week of the study. All but one ectopic pregnancies had scores of 0 or 1 points between 2 and 4 weeks after oocyte collection. The scores in successful pregnancies were significantly higher than in unsuccessful pregnancies 2 weeks after oocyte collection. Ninety percent of women scoring 3 points 2 weeks after oocyte collection had ongoing IVF pregnancies. The authors conclude that determination of serum beta-hCG, E2, and P concentrations between 2 and 4 weeks after oocyte collection provides clinically useful information not only in the prediction of ectopic IVF pregnancy, but also, conversely, in the identification of IVF pregnancies that are destined to be ongoing.\r"

The quality of the human CM was standardized by oral administration of estrogens. The overall pregnancy rate after 6 months was 17.2% (17/99), and was significantly different in couples with poor and good SCMPT with WCM (1/44, 2.3% versus 16/55, 29%; P less than 0.001) in a prospective study. Human CM was superior to BCM as a penetration medium in providing more information about sperm function. The results suggest that in vitro sperm penetration testing with hormonally standardized CM of female partners adds an important dimension to sperm analysis with regard to fertility prognosis.\r"

Laboratory error in the assessment of semen variables was minimized by using one consistent observer. Seven hundred thirty-nine subjects were recruited to the study over a 34-month period, and a 96.5% follow-up rate was achieved. Where the female partner had regular spontaneous ovulation, no pelvic pathology, and more than 48 months' preceding infertility, the Grade 2 motile sperm density (the concentration of spermatozoa exhibiting slow or sluggish linear or nonlinear motility) was the variable that best predicted fertility outcome (X1(2) = 20.24, P less than 0.0001). Where the Grade 2 motile sperm density was below 5 X 10(6)/ml in the latter group (19%), no conceptions were reported at 32 months' follow-up. Semen variables were not of predictive value where there were fewer than 48 months' infertility before investigation, or where the female partner had ovulatory dysfunction or pelvic pathology.\r"

Hyaluronidase activity increased as the concentration of sperm increased, and the least hyaluronidase activity was determined at less than 10 X 10(6)/ml. The group with more than 40% motility had a higher hyaluronidase activity than other groups with poor motility. Although there was no significant correlation between hyaluronidase and cumulus dispersion and fertilization rates in immature oocytes, there was an excellent correlation in mature oocytes in human in vitro fertilization. These findings suggest that a newly developed assay will be useful for evaluating sperm fertilizing capacity.\r"

The study shows that the patterns of hepatitis B virus transcripts for tumorous tissue and the counterpart in nontumorous liver differ. In most of the tissues examined, the surface antigen gene is transcribed. Most of these transcripts, besides having surface antigen sequences, also have an X region; some also include a pre-S region. The transcripts that hybridized to a core-specific probe were a pair of poly(A+) RNA, 3.5 and 2.2 kilobases in size, present in two of the nontumorous hepatocytes where the virus was actively replicating. The 3.5-kilobase transcript not only hybridized to the core probe, but was able to be hybridized to other hepatitis B virus subgenomic probes and might represent the RNA pregenome involving hepatitis B virus DNA replication. Whereas most of the transcripts hybridizable to hepatitis B virus probe are in the size range of 2.1 to 2.7 kilobases, some transcripts other than the pregenomic RNA appear to be greater than 3.2 kilobases in size and may represent the hybrid RNAs of viral and host sequences.\r"

He then received hepatic artery infusions of floxuridine. The tumor did not recur, but sclerosing cholangitis and liver failure developed which necessitated orthotopic liver transplantation. In the hilus of the native liver, obstructive arteriopathy and portal venopathy were found. These lesions probably had been caused by drug-induced intravascular thrombosis. Thus, the sclerosing cholangitis that develops in many patients after floxuridine infusion may be ischemic rather than toxic. The patient described here is well, 14 months after orthotopic liver transplantation. Therefore, in some cases of floxuridine-induced cholangitis, liver transplantation appears to be indicated despite a history of metastasizing carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "Examination of anoxic isolated hepatocytes by light and electron microscopy indicated that initial morphologic changes were largely localized to the periphery of the cells. This early phase consisted of surface bleb formation but was not accompanied by alterations in parameters of plasma membrane integrity (leakage of cellular enzymes, exclusion of trypan blue). The time course of changes in structure was temporally related to alterations in the elemental distribution and content of various subcellular compartments. These studies, which employed electron probe X-ray microanalysis, demonstrated that rapid increases in the sodium and chlorine content and decreases in the potassium content of the cytoplasm, mitochondria and nucleus occurred, whereas no change in the calcium content of any subcellular compartment was detected. Concurrently, two cellular functions known to be dependent upon ion homeostasis, sodium-dependent taurocholate uptake and mitochondrial respiratory control, became markedly impaired. Reoxygenation within 30 min resulted in the restoration of both elemental distribution and the latter two functions to baseline. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that some early functional changes may be mediated by altered ion homeostasis. In contrast, additional studies indicated that sodium and water fluxes could be dissociated from the appearance of plasma membrane blebs. Thus, this study provides direct evidence that the structural and functional changes of early anoxic hepatocyte injury cannot be explained by a single mechanistic cascade, but apparently involve multiple mechanisms which may not be directly linked.\r"

  ".W": "In the rat, asialoorosomucoid and rat dimeric immunoglobulin A are both taken up by hepatocytes via receptor-mediated endocytosis. The fate of these two proteins, however, differs significantly. Rat dimeric IgA is taken up into smooth vesicles, transported to the bile canaliculus and secreted intact into the bile, whereas asialoglycoproteins are internalized via coated vesicles and transported to lysosomes for degradation. Recently, several studies both in the rat and in cultured human hepatoma cells have suggested that the receptor for asialoglycoproteins may play a role in the hepatic uptake and processing of human polymeric IgA. Using receptor-binding techniques, we have provided quantitative data for the competition of human monomeric, polymeric and secretory IgA with asialoorosomucoid for its receptor on liver plasma membrane preparations from rat, monkey and man. Some IgA molecules required desialylation with neuraminidase to enhance markedly their efficacy for asialoorosomucoid inhibition. Quantitatively, human IgA molecules showed an affinity for the ASOR receptor similar to that for asialoceruloplasmin. Rat dimeric IgA does not compete for this binding site. We conclude that human IgA can compete with ligands for the asialoglycoprotein receptor of rat, monkey and human liver. This receptor may provide an alternative pathway for the hepatic processing of IgA and IgA immune complexes when secretory component-mediated uptake is not available as in the monkey and man, particularly under pathological conditions where serum IgA concentrations accumulate to abnormally high levels.\r"

In the first 24 hr of culture, gene transcripts for the Ya family decreased sharply, Yb3 disappeared completely, but changes in levels of mRNA for Yb1 and Yb2 were smaller. These results suggest that the isoenzymes are regulated independently. Yp mRNA, which is present at greatly elevated levels in hyperplastic nodules and hepatocellular carcinomas but not in normal adult livers, was hardly detectable in freshly isolated hepatocytes, but Yp transcripts rapidly accumulated in the first 24 hr in culture and continued to increase for 72 hr. Decreased levels in Ya and Yc and increases in Yp were detected by immunoblotting methods, indicating that translation products changed together with mRNA levels in the cultured cells. The appearance of Yp transcripts in hepatocytes was effectively blocked by addition of dexamethasone to the culture medium. Elevations of Yp levels are characteristic of the cell culture system and factors regulating Yp transcription in nodules and carcinomas may also be operative in cultured hepatocytes.\r"

Survival at 6 months was significantly lower in patients with infiltrating (16.7%) than in those with expanding tumors (75%), (p less than 0.05). The present results indicate that pathological features of hepatocellular carcinomas in cirrhotic patients in Western countries are similar to those encountered in the East: (a) tumors are frequently encapsulated; (b) the propensity for the tumor to spread is closely related to the presence of a tumor capsule. This study suggests that a thorough preoperative search for the capsule should be made whenever resection of a hepatocellular carcinoma in a cirrhotic patient is contemplated.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of increasing doses of propranolol were studied in awake portal hypertensive rats in order to elucidate the relative effects of the beta-blocker on systemic and splanchnic circulation. Hemodynamic responses to 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 mg per min infusions of propranolol were compared with placebo in awake rats with portal hypertension due to portal vein stenosis. Heart rate significantly and progressively decreased from 356 +/- 13 to 293 +/- 10 beats per min (mean +/- S.E.). Cardiac output significantly decreased from 54 +/- 3 to 42 +/- 3 ml per min per 100 gm body weight at the highest dose. Significant decrease in portal tributary blood flow from 27 +/- 1 to 18 +/- 1 ml per min, at 0.4 mg per min dose, was due not only to the decrease in cardiac output but also to a significant increase in portal tributary vascular resistance from 269 +/- 17 to 368 +/- 31 dyne per sec per cm5 x 10(3). However, portal pressure showed only an insignificant decrease from 14.9 +/- 1.1 to 14.1 +/- 1.4 mmHg. The reduction in portal pressure being minimal, in spite of a significant decrease in portal tributary blood flow, is explained by an increase in combined hepatic and collateral resistance from 44 +/- 2 to 66 +/- 4 dyne per sec per cm5 x 10(3), p less than 0.05, at 0.4 mg per min dose. We conclude that the systemic and splanchnic effects of propranolol show discrepancy at two levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Centrilobular hypoxia mediated by enhanced hepatic consumption of oxygen has been hypothesized to be a factor of pathogenetic importance in ethanol-induced liver injury. In the present study, this hypothesis was tested in a rat model which developed alcoholic centrilobular liver necrosis. Male Wistar rats were infused with high fat diet plus ethanol or isocaloric glucose for 7 weeks, a duration which resulted in induction of balloon cell degeneration, focal necrosis, and inflammation in the centrilobular region of the liver of the ethanol-fed animals. Hepatic blood flow, oxygen consumption and oxygen delivery were determined by the radiolabeled microsphere method and measurement of oxygen content in arterial, portal venous, and hepatic venous blood. Hepatic oxygen consumption was markedly increased by 159% in the ethanol-fed animals compared to that in the controls when results were expressed as relative to body weight. Even after these results were standardized per gram of liver weight, hepatic oxygen consumption was still significantly elevated in the ethanol-fed group, but the magnitude of the elevation was reduced to 70%, due to marked hepatomegaly observed in these animals. There was a concomitant 59% increase in hepatic oxygen delivery in the ethanol-fed rats when expressed per kilogram of body weight, and this effect was attributable entirely to increased portal blood flow. However, the increment of this increase in oxygen delivery was much too small to compensate for the 159% increase in oxygen consumption. In addition, this increase in hepatic oxygen delivery was no longer observable when the results were reexpressed based on the liver weight.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure were all significantly greater while the patients were speaking than while they were resting silently. In addition, ventricular and atrial arrhythmias were more frequent while they were talking than while they were quiet. Higher resting systolic blood pressure levels also were associated with larger blood pressure increases while the patients were speaking. Older patients exhibited significantly greater systolic pressure increases while talking than younger patients. Therapeutic doses of antihypertensive medications, including beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics did not block the heart rate and blood pressure increases while the patients were talking. These findings suggest that more attention needs to be paid to the hemodynamic consequences of communication in patients with coronary heart disease. Coupled with previous research findings, these data also suggest that clinicians need to attend to verbal communications during routine diagnostic procedures for evaluating cardiovascular function.\r"

The device was most frequently used in the emergency department and coronary care unit and was applied by a nurse in 51% of cases. Pacing thresholds ranged from 20 to 110 mA (mean 43 mA) with 91% obtaining capture. Pacing was continuous in 11 patients for 5 to 180 minutes (mean 32 minutes) and intermittent in 16 patients for up to 72 hours. Pacing did not take place in 10 patients because of failure to capture or because a satisfactory intrinsic rate was maintained. After external pacing, six patients received permanent pacemakers, 14 required temporary transvenous pacemakers, 10 required no further pacing, and seven (19%) died. Few problems were encountered, although eight of the 20 responsive patients had severe discomfort related to pacing, with two of these requiring discontinuation of pacing. The number of temporary transvenous pacemaker insertions in the coronary care unit decreased 32% over a 6-month period after introduction of the noninvasive temporary pacemaker. We conclude that the noninvasive temporary pacemaker is safe and effective although discomfort may limit its use in some patients.\r"

  ".W": "A structured educational program for patients undergoing coronary angioplasty was designed and administered to 97 patients undergoing their first procedure. Knowledge, coping style, social support, health locus of control, IQ, and demographic and medical factors were assessed before the procedure. Risk factor knowledge, anxiety, and medical status were assessed before discharge, and at 6 months and 2 years after angioplasty. Total knowledge mean score for all patients was higher at discharge (p less than 0.05). There was no significant difference between knowledge scores at baseline and at either 6 months or 2 years. Analyses revealed that patients with a repressive coping style learned less during hospitalization (p less than 0.05). No factors predicted retention of knowledge at 6 months or 2 years. These results indicate that a structured educational approach may have beneficial effects on immediate knowledge gain, although these results are not sustained. Coping assessment may provide information valuable for understanding differences in knowledge retention.\r"

  ".W": "In this time series design study we investigated the effects of conversation on intracranial pressure (ICP). Two conversation types were used, and continuous measurements of ICP were recorded. Type 1 conversation was an emotionally referenced conversation that reflected an actual nursing report on the patient's current condition. Type 2 conversation was a predetermined dialogue unrelated to the patient. Two hypotheses were tested to determine the existence of differences between the ICP measurements at baseline and the ICP measurements during any conversation, and differences between the ICP measurements recorded during type 1 conversation and during type 2 conversation. Eight subjects served as their own control. T tests were performed between the mean scores of the minimum, maximum, and average ICP measurements before, during, and after both conversations. The hypotheses were not supported by the findings. There was, however, a statistically significant decrease in ICP when minimum ICP measurements before type 2 conversations were compared with measurements recorded during type 2 conversation. The data also demonstrated a wide variation of individual patient responses. The results of the current study suggest that the direction of influence from conversation on the ICP is individual and may be influenced greatly by the patient's level of consciousness.\r"

Four hyperinflations were delivered at 1.5 times the calculated tidal volume (10 ml/kg) with 100% O2 or 20% above maintenance O2 level via resuscitator bag, followed by 10 seconds of continuous endotracheal suctioning. This sequence was repeated three times. No statistically significant differences (p less than 0.05) were found between the two protocols for arterial oxygen saturation, blood pressure, or heart rate (analysis of variance for repeated measures). There was no change in heart rhythm for any of the subjects.

Measurement of cardiac rhythm responses provides a unique opportunity to look at the complex interplay of physiologic, emotional, and environmental factors at a particular time. A model depicting the relationships between cardiac rhythm responses and the central nursing domain concepts of individual, environment, health, transitions, and nursing therapeutics is presented. Measurement of cardiac rhythm responses provides an objective, quantifiable, noninvasive, inexpensive, readily accessible, reliable, and valid tool for measuring human responses. Study of the phenomenon holds promise for nursing practice, science, and research fostering links among the three. Study of cardiac rhythm responses will have direct applicability to practice with the potential for narrowing the research-practice gap. Moreover, study of the phenomenon will contribute to nursing knowledge and foster advancement of nursing science by the development of theory.\r"

New conceptions of the syndrome, with its proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema, are providing explanations for the discrepancies between the original theory and clinical data from individual patients, particularly related to edema formation. Many of the edema-preventing mechanisms are normal in patients with NS, but may fail when plasma osmotic pressure falls significantly. Plasma volumes, blood volumes, and blood pressures of patients with NS have been found to be generally normal or slightly increased, in contrast to the classic \"hypovolemia\" theory. Activation of the renin-angiotension-aldosterone system is variable and cannot fully explain the sodium and water retention. The decreased renal filtration rates and abnormal sodium retention/excretion rates are now best explained by an intrarenal defect, on the basis of multiple research approaches. These research conceptions of the pathophysiology of NS are significant for nurses because they can be used in patient assessment, interpretation of patient data, monitoring during treatment, collaboration about the plan of care, development of nursing care plans, and patient teaching. Several nursing diagnoses may be appropriate for patients with NS: alteration in fluid volume: excess; potential for infection; alteration in nutrition: less than body requirements, potential alteration in comfort; knowledge deficit; and potential disturbance in self-concept: body image.\r"

In all ten patients, extension was the proper position for reduction of the injury of the cervical spine. Young children have a large head in comparison with the rest of the body. When a young child is positioned on a standard backboard, the neck may be forced into relative kyphosis. Supine and upright lateral radiographs that were made of seventy-two children who did not have a fracture also demonstrated more relative cervical kyphosis in younger children when they were in the supine position. Calculations from anthropometric data documented disproportionate rates of growth of the head and the chest. The circumference of the head grows logarithmically, but the circumference of the chest grows linearly. This disproportionate growth causes young children to have a relatively large head. When they lie supine, the neck is flexed. To prevent undesirable cervical flexion in young children during emergency transport and radiography, a standard backboard can be modified to provide safer alignment of the cervical spine. This can be accomplished by the use of a recess for the occiput to lower the head or of a double mattress pad to raise the chest.\r"

Fifteen patients (sixteen symptomatic hips), for whom the findings of magnetic resonance imaging were consistent with a diagnosis of osteonecrosis of the femoral head, had a core decompression and a biopsy of the contents of the core. Preoperative magnetic-resonance imaging was useful for planning which segment of the femoral head should be biopsied. Plain radiographs and tomograms of the hips were also made. On the basis of the plain radiographs, ten hips were determined to have Stage-I findings and six hips, Stage-II ischemic necrosis, according to the system of Ficat and of Arlet and Ficat. Histological study revealed evidence of necrosis in all of the biopsy specimens of bone. We concluded that findings of magnetic resonance imaging that are characteristic of osteonecrosis correlate well with the results of biopsies of bone in patients who have an early stage of ischemic necrosis. Magnetic resonance imaging is a highly sensitive and specific method for both the diagnosis and the location of Stage-I and Stage-II osteonecrosis.\r"

A separate group of forty-one consecutive patients who had open reduction of a fracture of the acetabulum or the spine before the introduction of the autotransfuser was reviewed and compared with the group that had autotransfusion. An autologous blood predeposit program was used for twenty-five of fifty-two patients who had a procedure on the hip and for fifty-one of fifty-five patients who had an elective procedure on the spine. The mean rate of red blood-cell salvage using the autotransfuser was 60 per cent over-all. The mean transfusion requirements were significantly less (p less than 0.001) in all groups of patients in whom the autotransfuser was used. Use of the autotransfuser reduced the mean requirement for banked blood in patients who had a fracture of the acetabulum from 3.8 to 2.3 units per patient, and significantly reduced the mean need for banked blood in individuals who had trauma to the spine from 2.7 to 1.8 units per patient (p less than 0.01). The use of prebanked autologous blood further reduced the mean requirement for homologous blood from 2.4 to 0.8 unit per patient in those who had revision total hip arthroplasty (p less than 0.005), and from 3.6 to 0.4 unit per patient in those who had an elective procedure on the spine (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

There were no major perioperative neurological complications. Failure of instrumentation occurred more frequently with 3/16-inch (4.8-millimeter) diameter than with 1/4-inch (6.4-millimeter) diameter stainless-steel rods.

The contributions of abnormalities of the skin, tendons, joint capsule, and collateral ligaments to deformity of the metatarsophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints were determined by sequential sectioning of all of those soft-tissue components. Any alteration in the range of motion of the joints was recorded after each stage of the dissection.

This difference was statistically significant (p less than 0.029). Eleven patients in the study group and four patients in the control group did not receive homologous blood. Over-all, the use of intraoperative autologous transfusion was directly responsible for a 42 per cent reduction in the total amount of homologous blood that was transfused.\r"

The animals were killed after the joint had been closed and activity in a cage had been allowed for twenty-four hours. When the animal was killed, cartilage was removed and was incubated with radioactive proline for four hours before light microscopy autoradiographs were made. Other samples were prepared for study by electron microscopy. The results in the animals that were killed immediately after the cartilage was exposed to room air and in those that were killed twenty-four hours after closure of the joint were identical. Both the ultrastructural and the autoradiographic findings indicated that the entire thickness of the articular cartilage was necrotic after sixty minutes of drying. Forty-five minutes of drying produced complete necrosis of the cartilage in half of the animals. In the other half, some cells survived, although many areas of the cartilage had complete necrosis, top to bottom. Thirty minutes of drying produced patchy necrosis that extended only to the middle zone of the cartilage. In joints that were exposed to room air for one hour, necrosis of the chondrocytes was completely prevented by irrigating the joint every five minutes with Ringer lactate solution.\r"

  ".W": "The records on fifty-two supracondylar-intercondylar fractures of the femur were reviewed twenty to 120 months after injury. More than one-third of the fractures had been open. All of the fractures were treated in a single trauma center, using: (1) a single lateral incision, (2) internal fixation with ASIF interfragmentary screws and plates, (3) bone-grafting of comminuted metaphyseal segments, (4) impaction of comminuted metaphyseal segments in osteoporotic elderly patients, and (5) repair of any associated torn ligaments and patellar fractures. Postoperatively, early active motion of the knee was encouraged, and for selected patients a brace was used only to protect the repair of associated disruptions of ligaments or of the extensor mechanism. The fractures were classified by the ASIF system, with C1 being a simple Y pattern, C2 having additional supracondylar comminution, and C3 having intra-articular comminution. The final results were rated using the system that was described by Neer et al. for fractures of the distal end of the femur. The average time between the operation and full weight-bearing (healing) was 13.6 weeks and ranged from 12.3 weeks for C1 fractures (as graded using the ASIF classification) to 15.4 weeks for C3 fractures. The average final arc of motion of the knee was 107 degrees, ranging from 113 degrees for C1 fractures to 99 degrees for C3 fractures. C1 fractures had a better outcome (92 per cent excellent and good results) than did C2 and C3 fractures (77 per cent excellent and good results). Two amputations and one arthrodesis were done to treat infection, and infection accounted for three of the four poor results. Age did not influence the final results, although elderly patients had a longer period of hospitalization. Supracondylar-intercondylar fractures of the femur should be analyzed separately from other fractures of the distal end of the femur because of their intra-articular involvement and associated ligamentous injuries and patellar fractures. Rigid internal fixation permits early functional rehabilitation of the patient and decreases the incidence of malunion, non-union, and loss of fixation.\r"

Recently a decapeptide derived from the NH2 terminus of the prohormone has been identified in extracts of rat gastric antrum and named antrin. Data now show that in both rats and humans this new molecular form is concentrated in the D cell of the gastrointestinal mucosa together with somatostatin-28(1-12). The highest concentration of antrin immunofluorescent cells is located in the mucosa of the gastric antrum. Ultrastructural studies performed on pyloric D cells using the protein A-gold technique reveals that antrin is present in the same secretory granules as somatostatin-28(1-12) and detectable in one-third of all secretory granules. Acid extracts of rat hepatic portal plasma contain a peptide similar or identical to antrin, indicating that the antral decapeptide circulates in blood.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies performed in this laboratory have demonstrated somatostatin-containing cells in close proximity to gastrin cells in antral mucosa and have shown that somatostatin exerts a local regulatory effect on gastrin release. The present studies were directed to determine whether the effects of somatostatin on the antral gastrin cell involve pretranslational events. The effects of somatostatin on gastrin mRNA were determined by dot blot hybridization using a gastrin antisense RNA probe derived from human gastrin cDNA. Inclusion of somatostatin in the incubation medium caused a dose-dependent inhibition of steady-state gastrin mRNA. Conversely, when antral somatostatin was neutralized by the addition of specific somatostatin antibodies to the incubation medium, gastrin mRNA levels increased by 116 +/- 31% over control values (P less than 0.01). Northern blot hybridization of total antral RNA demonstrated a single major band with a molecular size of approximately 620 nucleotides, closely matching the predicted size of gastrin mRNA. The effect of somatostatin on the rate of gastrin gene transcription was examined using nuclear run-off transcription assays. Inclusion of antibodies to somatostatin in the incubation medium resulted in a 33.8 +/- 3.3% increase in gastrin gene transcriptional activity (P less than 0.01). These studies indicate that, in addition to its established effect on peptide release, somatostatin exerts inhibitory effects on antral gastrin cells at the pretranslational level. Although this inhibition appears to occur in part at the gene transcriptional level, the results also indicate that somatostatin may affect posttranscriptional processing of gastrin mRNA.\r"

The existence of PTH-sensitive adenylate cyclase and the reproduction of increased epithelial Ca transport by dibutyryl-cAMP suggest that cAMP is the mediator. Accordingly, we studied the effects of PTH and 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP) on cytosolic free calcium concentration [( Ca2+]i) in individual rabbit CNTs. [Ca2+]i was estimated by continuous epifluorescence microscopy of single fura-2-loaded tubules during dual wave-length excitation. In nonperfused controls at 37 degrees C, [Ca2+]i decreased with time. In contrast to vehicle controls, synthetic bovine (1-34) PTH (0.1 nM) increased [Ca2+]i within 4 min, produced a maximal effect in 7.2 min, and sustained its effect for at least 2 min after washout. 8-Br-cAMP (1 mM) mimicked the effect of PTH, but with an earlier onset of action. To test the hypothesis that lumen Ca is the predominant source of the rise in [Ca2+]i, we studied singly perfused CNTs. In the absence of bath and lumen Ca, PTH elicited no rise in [Ca2+]i, implying that intracellular Ca stores are not the major source. In contrast, there was a rise when Ca was replenished in both media. In the continuous presence of bath Ca, lumen Ca was estimated to contribute 65% of the total rise in [Ca2+]i in response to PTH when it was first deleted and then replenished. However, when the sequence of lumen Ca manipulation was reversed, the contributions by lumen and bath Ca were found to be essentially equal. We conclude (a) at a physiologic concentration, PTH increases [Ca2+]i in rabbit CNTs, (b) 8-Br-cAMP mimics this action, implicating cAMP as a second messenger, and (c) the PTH-stimulated rise in [Ca2+]i depends importantly on both bath and tubular luminal fluid Ca.\r"

  ".W": "The relationships between extracellular pH (pHo), intracellular pH (pHi), and loss of cell viability were evaluated in cultured rat hepatocytes after ATP depletion by metabolic inhibition with KCN and iodoacetate (chemical hypoxia). pHi was measured in single cells by ratio imaging of 2',7'-biscarboxy-ethyl-5,6-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) fluorescence using multiparameter digitized video microscopy. During chemical hypoxia at pHo of 7.4, pHi decreased from 7.36 to 6.33 within 10 min. pHi remained at 6.1-6.5 for 30-40 min (plateau phase). Thereafter, pHi began to rise and cell death ensued within minutes, as evidenced by nuclear staining with propidium iodide and coincident leakage of BCECF from the cytoplasm. An acidic pHo produced a slightly greater drop in pHi, prolonged the plateau phase of intracellular acidosis, and delayed the onset of cell death. Inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange also prolonged the plateau phase and delayed cell death. In contrast, monensin or substitution of gluconate for Cl- in buffer containing HCO3- abolished the pH gradient across the plasma membrane and shortened cell survival. The results indicate that intracellular acidosis after ATP depletion delays the onset of cell death, whereas reduction of the degree of acidosis accelerates cell killing. We conclude that intracellular acidosis protects against hepatocellular death from ATP depletion, a phenomenon that may represent a protective adaptation against hypoxic and ischemic stress.\r"

To test this possibility, we systematically studied the interconnections of skeletal proteins in patients with a form of alpha thalassemia (HbH disease), in patients with beta thalassemia intermedia, and in normal individuals. Alpha- and beta-thalassemic spectrin functions normally in spectrin self-association, binding to normal inside-out vesicles (IOVs), and binding to actin in the presence and absence of normal protein 4.1. Binding of normal spectrin to beta: thalassemic IOVs is normal but alpha-thalassemic IOVs are defective and bind only half the normal amount of spectrin (66 +/- 5 vs. 120 +/- 16 micrograms spectrin dimer/mg IOV protein, respectively). A different defect is detected in beta thalassemia, in which protein 4.1 shows markedly reduced ability (48 +/- 7% of normal) to enhance the binding of normal spectrin to actin and a decreased ability to bind normal spectrin in a binary interaction, compared with normal protein 4.1 (24 +/- 1 and 43 +/- 1 micrograms protein 4.1/mg spectrin, respectively). As no quantitative deficiency of beta-thalassemic protein 4.1 is detected, we assume an acquired lesion is present, which affects about half of the protein 4.1 molecules. These findings indicate that specific, localized, yet different defects exist in the skeletal proteins of alpha- and beta-thalassemic red cells. The different molecular lesions imply that the mechanism of hemolysis and probably the interaction of unpaired globin chains with the membrane differs in the two diseases.\r"

To assess the electrochemical forces driving fatty acid uptake, we used microelectrodes to monitor continuously the electrical potential difference across the plasma membrane in the perfused rat liver while simultaneously monitoring the rate of tracer [3H]oleate uptake from 1% albumin solutions. Isosmotic cation or anion substitution was used to vary the potential difference over the physiologic range. Depolarization of cells from -29 to -19 mV by substituting gluconate for chloride reduced steady-state oleate uptake by 34%. Conversely, hyperpolarization of cells to -52 mV by substituting nitrate for chloride increased uptake by 41%. Replacement of perfusate sodium with choline depolarized the cells to -18 mV and reduced uptake by 58%, an amount greater than expected from the degree of depolarization alone. Oleate in higher concentrations (1.5 mM in 2% albumin) depolarized cells by 3 mV in the presence of sodium, but had no effect in sodium-free buffer. These results suggest that a portion of oleate uptake in the intact liver occurs by electrogenic sodium cotransport. Uptake appears to be driven by both the electrical and sodium chemical gradients across the plasma membrane.\r"

We found that cachectin/tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was synthesized and secreted into the culture medium by human decidual cells and explants in response to treatment with LPS. LPS treatment also caused an increase in PGF2 alpha production by decidual cells and explants. In amnion cells in monolayer culture, TNF-alpha stimulated PGE2 formation, and TNF-alpha was cytostatic (inhibited [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA) but not cytolytic in amnion cells. TNF-alpha was not detectable (less than 0.34 ng/ml) in the amniotic fluid of normal pregnancies at midtrimester or at term before or after the onset of labor (n = 44); but TNF-alpha was present at concentrations between 2.8 and 22.3 ng/ml in amniotic fluids of 4 of 20 pregnancies with intact membranes complicated by preterm labor (less than 34 wk gestational age). LPS was present in 10 of the 20 amniotic fluids of preterm labor pregnancies, including all four in which TNF-alpha was present. Bacteria were identified in only one of the four LPS-positive, TNF-alpha-positive fluids. Cytokine formation in macrophage-like decidua may serve a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of preterm labor, including increased prostaglandin formation and premature rupture of the membranes.\r"

We used an open chest lamb/sheep preparation in which myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) was monitored via an extracorporeal shunt from the coronary sinus. Phosphate metabolites were monitored simultaneously using 31P nuclear magnetic resonance with a surface coil overlying the left ventricle. Graded infusions of epinephrine were used to increase MVO2 in both neonatal lambs (age 5-12 d, n = 8), and mature sheep (26-86 d, n = 6). The maximal increase in MVO2 achieved was 220 +/- 38% in the newborns and 350 +/- 66% in the mature animals. Associated with these increases in MVO2 in the newborn lambs are significant (P less than 0.001) decreases in PCr/ATP, and increases in calculated ADP and intracellular Pi. This was in contrast to the mature sheep, in which there were no significant changes in PCr/ATP, ADP, or Pi. In conclusion, we find that (a) there are changes in PCr/ATP, Pi, and ADP in newborn animals with moderate increases in work that are not apparent in mature animals of the same species and (b) that these changes suggest that cytosolic ATP hydrolysis products may be more important in regulation of myocardial energy metabolism in the newborn than in the adult.\r"

Half of the cholesterol-fed rabbits were given lovastatin, a potent inhibitor of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, and the other half were given its vehicle (i.e., DMSO). At the end of 2 wk, the rabbits underwent experimental myocardial ischemia or a sham ischemia procedure. Ischemic animals fed the cholesterol-enriched diet for 2 wk experienced much greater cardiac damage than ischemic rabbits fed the control diet, despite the absence of any atherosclerosis. Lovastatin was shown to protect the ischemic rabbit myocardium by three different indices of ischemic damage: (a) maintenance of creatine kinase (CK) activity in the ischemic myocardium; (b) reduced loss of free amino-nitrogen containing compounds from the ischemic myocardium; and (c) blunting the rise of plasma CK activity. These effects were not due to differences in myocardial oxygen demand between the groups. Arteries isolated from animals fed the cholesterol-enriched diet developed defects in endothelium-dependent relaxation in both large vessels as well as coronary resistance vessels. Acute hypercholesterolemia increases the severity of myocardial ischemia while at the same time impairing endothelium-dependent relaxation. These deleterious changes can be significantly attenuated by treatment with lovastatin.\r"

The underlying abnormality causing the deficiencies is unknown. We examined mRNA transcription and protein synthesis of two neutrophil granule proteins, lactoferrin and myeloperoxidase in SGD. Metabolically labeled SGD nucleated marrow cells produced normal amounts of myeloperoxidase, but there was no detectable synthesis of lactoferrin. Transcripts of the expected size for lactoferrin were detectable in the nucleated marrow cells of two SGD patients, but were markedly diminished in abundance when compared with normal nucleated marrow cell RNA. Because lactoferrin is secreted by the glandular epithelia of several tissues, we also assessed lactoferrin in the nasal secretions of one SGD patient by ELISA and immunoblotting. Nasal secretory lactoferrin was the same molecular weight as neutrophil lactoferrin and was secreted in normal amounts. From these data, we conclude that lactoferrin deficiency in SGD neutrophils is tissue specific and is secondary to an abnormality of RNA production. We speculate that the deficiency of several granule proteins is due to a common defect in regulation of transcription that is responsible for the abnormal myeloid differentiation seen in SGD patients.\r"

  ".W": "Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is caused by disorders of the P450c21B gene, which, with the P450c21A pseudogene, lies in the HLA locus on chromosome 6. The near identity of nucleotide sequences and endonuclease cleavage sites in these A and B loci makes genetic analysis of this disease difficult. We used a genomic DNA probe that detects the P450c21 genes (A pseudogene, 3.2 kb; B gene, 3.7 kb in Taq I digests) and the 3' flanking DNA not detected with cDNA probes (A pseudogene, 2.4 kb; B gene, 2.5 kb) to examine Southern blots of genomic DNA from 68 patients and 165 unaffected family members in 57 families with CAH. Of 116 CAH-bearing chromosomes, 114 could be sorted into five easily distinguished haplotypes based on blots of DNA digested with Taq I and Bgl II. Haplotype I (76 of 116, 65.6%) was indistinguishable from normal and therefore bore very small lesions, presumably point mutations. Haplotype II (4 of 116, 3.4%) and haplotype III (8 of 116, 6.9%) had deletions and duplications of the P450c21A pseudogene but had structurally intact P450c21B genes presumably bearing point mutations; point mutation thus was the genetic defect in 88 of 116 chromosomes (75.9%). Haplotypes IV and V lack the 3.7-kb Taq I band normally associated with the P450c21B gene. Haplotype IV (13 of 116, 11.2%) retains all other bands, indicating that the P450c21B gene has undergone a gene conversion event, so that it is now also associated with a 3.2-kb band. Haplotype V (13 of 116, 11.2%) lacks the 2.4-kb Taq I fragment and the 12-kb Bgl II fragments normally associated with the P450c21A pseudogene, as well as lacking the 3.7-kb Taq I fragment, indicating deletion of approximately 30 kb of DNA, resulting in a single hybrid P450c21A/B gene. Most (114 of 116, 98%) CAH alleles thus can easily be classified with this new probing strategy, eliminating many ambiguities resulting from probing with cDNA.\r"

  ".W": "Isolated rat hepatocyte couplets (IRHC) are primary units of bile secretion that accumulate fluid in an enclosed canalicular space with time in culture. We have quantitated the rate of canalicular secretion in IRHC cultured for 4-8 h by measuring the change in canalicular space volume by video-microscopic optical planimetry using high resolution Nomarski optics. Electron microscopic morphometric studies revealed significant increases in canalicular membrane area after 4-6 h in culture. Canalicular secretion in basal L-15 medium (3.8 +/- 1.3 fl/min) increased significantly with the choleretic bile salts (10 microM), taurocholate, and ursodeoxycholate (14 +/- 7 fl/min each). Secretion rates after exposure to bile acids correlated directly with the canalicular surface area before stimulation. In contrast, expansion times after stimulation varied inversely with initial canalicular volumes. Ursodeoxycholic acid failed to produce a hypercholeresis at 10-, 100-, or 200-microM concentrations compared with taurocholate, either in normal or taurine-depleted IRHC. The present findings establish that rates of canalicular bile secretion can be quantitated in IRHC by serial optical planimetry, both in the basal state and after stimulation with bile acids. Furthermore, ursodeoxycholate does not acutely induce hypercholeresis at the canalicular level in this model. Rather, both taurocholic and ursodeoxycholic acids induced secretion in proportion to the surface area of the canalicular membrane. The IRHC are a useful model to identify canalicular choleretics and for studies of canalicular bile formation.\r"

  ".W": "A fraction of the pro alpha 1(I) and pro alpha 2(I) chains in type I procollagen synthesized by the fibroblasts from a proband with a lethal variant of osteogenesis imperfecta were overmodified by posttranslational reactions. After digestion with pepsin, some of the alpha 1(I) chains were recovered as disulfide-linked dimers. Mapping of cyanogen bromide peptides indicated that the disulfide link was contained in alpha 1-CB6, the cyanogen bromide fragment containing amino acid residues 823-1014 of the alpha 1(I) chain. Nucleotide sequencing of cDNA clones demonstrated a substitution of T for G that converted glycine 904 of the alpha 1(I) chain to cysteine. A large fraction of the type I procollagen synthesized by the proband's fibroblasts had a thermostability that was 3-4 degrees C lower than the normal type I procollagen as assayed by brief proteinase digestion. In addition, the type I procollagen synthesized by the proband's fibroblasts was secreted with an abnormal kinetic pattern in that there was a lag period of about 30 min in pulse-chase experiments. The mutation of glycine to cysteine was not found in type I procollagen synthesized by fibroblasts from the proband's parents. Therefore, the mutation was a sporadic one. However, the mother's fibroblasts synthesized a type I procollagen in which part of the pro alpha chains were overmodified and had a lower thermostability. Therefore, the proband may have inherited a mutated allele for type I procollagen from her mother that contributed to the lethal phenotype. The mother was asymptomatic. She was somewhat short and had slightly blue sclerae but no definitive signs of a connective tissue abnormality. The observations on the mother indicated, therefore, that a mutation that causes synthesis of a type I procollagen with a lowered thermal stability does not necessarily produce a heritable disorder of connective tissue.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies in our laboratory and others have demonstrated in humans and other mammals two isozymes of arginase (AI and AII) that differ both electrophoretically and antigenically. AI, a cytosolic protein found predominantly in liver and red blood cells, is believed to be chiefly responsible for ureagenesis and is the one missing in hyperargininemic patients. Much less is known about AII because it is present in far smaller amounts and localized in less accessible deep tissues, primarily kidney. We now report the application of enzymatic and immunologic methods to assess the independent expression and regulation of these two gene products in normal tissue extracts, two cultured cell lines, and multiple organ samples from a hyperargininemic patient who came to autopsy after an unusually severe clinical course characterized by rapidly progressive hepatic cirrhosis. AI was totally absent (less than 0.1%) in the patient's tissues, whereas marked enhancement of AII activity (four times normal) was seen in the kidney by immunoprecipitation and biochemical inhibition studies. Immunoprecipitation-competition and Western blot analysis failed to reveal presence of even an enzymatically inactive cross-reacting AI protein, whereas Southern blot analysis showed no evidence of a substantial deletion in the AI gene. Induction studies in cell lines that similarly express only the AII isozyme indicated that its activity could be enhanced severalfold by exposure to elevated arginine levels. Our findings suggest that the same induction mechanism may well be operative in hyperargininemic patients, and that the heightened AII activity may be responsible for the persistent ureagenesis seen in this disorder. These data lend further support to the existence of two separate arginase gene loci in humans, and raise possibilities for novel therapeutic approaches based on their independent manipulation.\r"

Intracellular pH (pHi) was measured with 2'7'-biscarboxyethyl-5,6-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) and a microfluorometer coupled to the tubule perfusion apparatus. Reduction of basolateral HCO3- from 25 to 5 mM caused pHi to decrease at a rate of 0.81 pH/min. Approximately 50% of this rate was Na+-dependent, 30% Cl(-)-dependent and 20% Na+ and Cl(-)-independent. Two basolateral Na+-dependent acid base transport pathways were detected: (a) an amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ antiporter and (b) a stilbene-sensitive Na+/base cotransporter. No evidence was found for a Na+-dependent Cl-/base exchanger. The Cl(-)-dependent component of basolateral base efflux was mediated by a stilbene-sensitive Na+-independent Cl-/base exchange pathway. The results suggest that the acid base transport pathways of the basolateral membrane of the S3 proximal tubule differ from more proximal nephron segments.\r"

Because hypospadias is the most common congenital defect of the male urethra and because in most cases the cause of this malformation is unknown, we examined the hypothesis that the etiology of the severe forms of this disorder, which is frequently associated with other genital anomalies, might be explained by receptor abnormalities. Intracellular and nuclear binding of androgens were determined in cultured genital skin fibroblasts from 10 males who underwent circumcision for phimosis (controls A), 2 patients with 5 alpha-reductase deficiency (controls B), and 11 patients with severe forms of hypospadias of unknown etiology. Genital skin fibroblast monolayers were incubated for 60 min at 37 degrees C with varying concentrations of [3H]-dihydrotestosterone ([3H]DHT), and specific binding in whole cells and nuclei was measured. Maximum binding (Bmax) in the whole cell assay averaged 0.88 +/- 0.15 fmol . microgram DNA-1 (mean +/- SD) in the control group (controls A, 0.89 +/- 0.16 fmol . microgram DNA-1; controls B, 0.85 fmol . microgram DNA-1) and 0.7 +/- 0.25 fmol . microgram DNA-1 in the patients with hypospadias. In the latter group, Bmax in six patients was below the minimum values determined in the controls. Maximum specific nuclear binding in the control groups averaged 43% (range, 30-55%) of the corresponding intracellular binding. In contrast, nuclear binding in strains from patients with hypospadias was lower (range, 0-12% of whole cell Bmax). In particular, no high affinity saturable nuclear [3H]DHT binding could be measured in 6 of the 11 patients. We interpret these data to suggest that defective intracellular and/or nuclear binding might be the cause of defective genital development in some patients with severe hypospadias.\r"

In vitro, very low (pM and nM) concentrations of PAF \"primed\" rat neutrophils for enhanced O2-. responses to IgG immune complexes while higher concentrations were directly stimulatory. The PAF receptor antagonist, L-652,731, blocked responses (O2-. production and enzyme release) of rat neutrophils stimulated with PAF but did not block responses triggered by immune complexes, formyl chemotactic peptide or opsonized zymosan particles. When L-652,731 was added to the antibody employed in the reversed passive Arthus reaction, the injury resulting from immune complex-induced vasculitis was significantly attenuated. In order to determine if in vivo protection provided by L-652,731 was related to neutrophils, we developed a new model in which rats are systemically depleted of neutrophils by cyclophosphamide and then locally reconstituted with intact neutrophils in a manner that allows restoration of immune complex-induced vascular injury. With this model, we demonstrated that the effects of neutrophil reconstitution are substantially diminished if the cells are pretreated with L-652,731 and then washed. By priming neutrophils with substimulatory concentrations of PAF, we have also provided in vivo evidence that neutrophil priming can increase the magnitude of vascular injury. These data provide evidence that vascular injury associated with immune complex dermal vasculitis is related to availability of PAF receptors on neutrophils, suggesting a mechanism through which PAF may function as a mediator in the pathogenesis of immune complex vasculitis.\r"

  ".W": "The major P-450IIIA gene family member present in human liver is HLp which, like its rat liver orthologue P-450p, is inducible by glucocorticoids and catalyzes erythromycin N-demethylation. To develop a practical method to estimate the amounts of HLp in patients [14C]N-methyl erythromycin was injected into rats that had been pretreated with dexamethasone or with inducers of other forms of cytochrome P-450. The rate of demethylation of this substrate, measured simply as 14CO2 in the breath, correlated well with the concentrations of immunoreactive P-450p protein (r = 0.70), holocytochrome P-450p (r = 0.70), or with erythromycin N-demethylase activity (r = 0.90) determined in the liver microsomes prepared from each rat. Next, [14C]N-methyl erythromycin was administered to 30 patients and there was a sixfold interindividual variation in breath 14CO2 production seemingly unrelated to medications, smoking status or age. However, the average breath test values were twofold greater in female as compared to male patients (P less than 0.01). Breath 14CO2 production rose in patients retested after treatment with the P-450IIIA inducers dexamethasone (P less than 0.05) or rifampicin (P less than 0.05) and was decreased after treatment with the HLp inhibitor triacetyloleandomycin (P less than 0.05). We conclude that the erythromycin breath test provides a convenient assay of P-450IIIA cytochromes in rats and in some patients.\r"

In this study, we show that by flow cytometry, a monoclonal antibody (135A3) produced against rabbit NEP reacted selectively with leukemia and melanoma cell lines expressing CALLA on their surface. A glycoprotein of apparent Mr 100,000 was immunoprecipitated from surface labeled NALM-1 leukemia or Mel-1477 melanoma cells with monoclonal antibodies to NEP (135A3) or CALLA (44C10). mRNAs hybridizing to a NEP-specific probe were present in CALLA+ leukemia and melanoma cell lines, but absent from CALLA- lines. NEP enzymatic activity was detected on intact cells from CALLA+ lines, but not CALLA- lines. The activity was blocked by two selective inhibitors of NEP, thiorphan and phosphoramidon. CALLA antigen purified from the NALM-6 leukemic cell line by affinity to 44C10-IgG Sepharose retained a peptidase activity that was completely blocked by thiorphan and phosphoramidon. Thus the CALLA antigen present at the surface of leukemia and melanoma cell lines is an enzymatically active neutral endopeptidase.\r"

The two types studied here were induced either by brief heating on surfaces (cytokineplasts) or by discontinuous gradient centrifugation (Ficoll) without heat or drugs (U-cytoplasts). Freshly made, these cytoplasts respond chemotactically to formyl peptide (fMet-Leu-Phe), and they take up and kill roughly half as many Staphylococcus aureus as their (larger, granular) parent PMN. Unlike their parent cells, after cryopreservation both cytoplasts remain chemotactic, and in matched experiments they take up and kill staphylococci with undiminished avidity. These findings are the first indications that PMN cytoplasts suitable for clinical use may be feasible.\r"

We then demonstrated that PBMC translate the message into protein. Thus, using a radioimmunoassay with an antibody for ACTH, a median of 29 pg of ACTH-like immunoreactivity (ACTH-LIR) was found in 10(7) PBMC. ACTH-LIR was also detected in seven different cell lines derived from patients with lymphoid and myeloid malignancies, two of them JM and U937 showing the highest values 135 and 108 pg/10(7) cells, respectively. The chromatographic characterization of this ACTH-LIR showed, at least, three molecular forms of immunoreactive ACTH with molecular weights of the order of 31,000 POMC, 22,000 ACTH, and 4,500 ACTH, in addition to high-molecular-weight material (greater than 43,000).

We report two brothers with hemophilia and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) exposure who developed porphyria cutanea tarda. These brothers are heterosexual, have familial porphyria cutanea tarda, and developed overt familial porphyria cutanea tarda in their early twenties. One brother's symptoms were provoked by attending an ultraviolet A suntanning parlor. Our two patients, unlike the previously reported three patients, have not developed AIDS, though one patient has evidence of defective cell-mediated immunity. Three of the five cases of porphyria cutanea tarda associated with HIV infection involved familial porphyria cutanea tarda. It now may be advisable to order HIV serology tests in patients who have porphyria cutanea tarda. We recommend that HIV-positive individuals avoid ultraviolet A radiation because of its immunosuppressive effects in persons already at risk of immunosuppression. Such exposure is further contraindicated in those individuals with porphyria cutanea tarda.\r"

No evidence was found for cardiac or other visceral organ involvement. Extensive diagnostic evaluations revealed no evidence for parasitic infestation, connective tissue disease, or neoplastic disorders. Results of immunologic studies revealed increased serum IgM and IgE levels and showed elevated levels of circulating activated T-helper cells. Biopsy specimens of lesional skin showed dermal infiltration of lymphocytes and eosinophils with deposition of eosinophil granule major basic protein in the extracellular matrix within the dermis. Immunophenotyping of the dermal infiltrate with monoclonal antibodies revealed the predominance of T-helper cells, many of them expressing the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR, suggesting that angioedema with eosinophilia may be a T-helper cell-mediated disease.\r"

The ratio of female-to-male patients was 2.9:1 in the annular group and 1.4:1 in the nonannular group. The mean age at onset was 51.7 years. The eruption was symptomatic in 34 patients, and specific precipitating factors could be implicated in 16 patients. No consistently associated systemic disorders were identified. Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed in 21% of our referral group of generalized granuloma annulare cases, compared with 9.7% in 1350 cases of localized granuloma annulare and 10.3% in 1383 cases of all forms of granuloma annulare seen at the Mayo Clinic in the same period. Serum lipid abnormalities were more common in the generalized annular group. Follow-up data indicated a chronic, relapsing course in most patients.\r"

Information on demographic and illness variables that might predict feelings of being stigmatized were obtained. Through factor analysis of a specially designed questionnaire, six dimensions of the stigma experience were identified: anticipation of rejection, feeling of being flawed, sensitivity to others' attitudes, guilt and shame, secretiveness, and positive attitudes. There was marked variability in the presence and magnitude of these feelings. Different predictors emerged for different dimensions of the stigma experience, the most frequent being age at onset, extent of bleeding, employment status, duration, and rejection experience. Of all the aspects of the illness, bleeding proved the strongest predictor of stigma feelings and of despair, which correlates highly with stigma. Despair and feeling stigmatized may lead to noncompliance with treatment, possibly worsening the status of the psoriasis.\r"

Standard radiographs of the axial and peripheral skeleton were evaluated. The films of 44 patients showed skeletal abnormalities such as periosteal thickening, hyperostosis of the vertebral column, disk degeneration, osteoporosis, calcification of the spinal ligaments, and slender long bones. The present data indicate that the risk of skeletal disorders in adults treated with etretinate is significant (44 of 90), but that the severity of changes is minor.\r"

Also 106 internists in the same region were surveyed. Whereas the dentists believed smoking is dangerous to health and considered counseling as an important part of their practice, only 17%, compared with 58% of the internists, frequently discussed quitting with their patients who smoke. The two groups also differed in the types of counseling they used. Dentists attributed their lack of counseling to poor insurance coverage, insufficient time, lack of training, and fear that patients might leave their practices if urged to quit. These issues must be addressed if dentists are to participate fully in helping their patients quit smoking.\r"

Acute occlusion occurred in 22 patients (3.1%) and 29 lesions (1.9%). The patients were classified into a group undergoing multivessel angioplasty (348 patients, 785 lesions) and a group undergoing multilesion single vessel angioplasty (366 patients, 765 lesions). The rate of acute occlusion was similar in both patient groups. The multivessel angioplasty group had a 2.9% rate per patient (n = 10) and a 1.7% rate per vessel; the multilesion single vessel group had a 3.3% rate per patient (n = 12) and a 2.1% rate per lesion. Five of the 10 patients from the multivessel group with acute occlusion, but only 1 of the 12 patients with occlusion in the single vessel multilesion group, required emergency open heart surgery. No patient in either group died as a consequence of coronary angioplasty. Occlusion occurred during angioplasty in 15 of the 22 patients, and 1 to 24 h after angioplasty in 7 of 22 patients. In the group with multivessel angioplasty, acute occlusion during the procedure was mainly linked with hypotension during the second vessel dilation, whereas in this group with delayed vessel closure and in the multilesion single vessel group, existence of intimal tearing constituted the most important factor for acute occlusion (12 of 16 patients). Closure of vessel per major coronary system was evenly distributed in the multivessel group, whereas significantly more left circumflex vessels closed in the single vessel multilesion group (6.1% versus 1.3% in the left anterior descending coronary artery and 1.1% in the right coronary artery; p less than 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At late follow-up (mean 18 months, range 7 to 49), 30 patients (43%) had a third restenosis treated with either a fourth angioplasty (16 patients), coronary bypass surgery (11 patients) or medical management (1 patient). Thirty-nine patients (57%) had no restenosis on the basis of follow-up angiography or absence of symptoms previously attributed to restenosis. Factors associated with a third restenosis included a shorter time interval (less than 3 months) between previous angioplasty procedures and dilation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Among the 16 patients undergoing a fourth angioplasty for a third restenosis, the procedural success rate was 94%. One patient required emergency bypass surgery. At late follow-up (mean 16 months, range 7 to 38), eight patients (53%) had a fourth restenosis treated with either a fifth angioplasty (one patient), bypass surgery (five patients) or medical management (two patients). Considering all 74 patients undergoing a third angioplasty for a second restenosis, 27% had bypass surgery, 5% died, 4% were managed medically and 64% were free of angina at late follow-up after either a third, fourth or fifth angioplasty. Restenosis rates after a third or fourth angioplasty procedure for recurrent restenosis are higher than those for the initial procedures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, the grade of collateral filling during sudden coronary occlusion varies from patient to patient. To assess which characteristics may predict a high grade of collateral filling, baseline clinical and angiographic variables were correlated with the grade of filling during coronary occlusion in 67 patients (whose angina ranged from 1 week to 36 months in duration) undergoing left anterior descending or right coronary artery angioplasty. A second contralateral arterial catheter was used to assess the collateral filling that reached the vessel dilated before and during transient total occlusion by the angioplasty balloon. Thirty-six patients had a proximal stenotic lesion ranging in severity from 65 to 99%. On a 0 to 3 scale, mean collateral filling grade before inflation was 0.4 versus 1.8 during inflation (p = 0.001). All 19 patients with 95 to 99% stenosis had at least grade 2 collateral filling during inflation. In contrast, 18 of 21 patients with less than or equal to 80% stenosis had only grade 0 or 1 collateral filling during inflation. There were significant positive correlations between collateral grade during inflation and 1) baseline lesion severity (r = 0.76), 2) baseline collateral filling grade (r = 0.50), and 3) vessel dilated. There was no relation between collateral filling during inflation and age, gender, risk factors, duration of angina or proximal versus distal location of the lesion. Lesion severity was the only independent variable associated with collateral filling grade.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirty-six patients with cardiomyopathy were prospectively studied by two-dimensional echocardiography. Data included echocardiographic short- and long-axis cavity dimensions, their ratio and, with cuff systolic blood pressure, meridional and circumferential end-systolic stress and their ratios. Survivors (n = 16) were followed up for 52 months (range 40 to 76); nonsurvivors (n = 20) died an average of 11 months after study. Survivors had a smaller left ventricular end-diastolic short-axis dimension (6.4 versus 7.1 cm, p less than 0.03) but a similar long-axis length (8.6 versus 8.3 cm). However, overall cavity shape or the ratio of short- to long-axis end-diastolic dimensions was more spherical in those with poorer survival (ratio 0.76 versus 0.68, p less than 0.02). Meridional and circumferential end-systolic stresses were similar in the two groups, but stress was more evenly distributed in the long- and short-axis planes in nonsurvivors (meridional/circumferential stress ratio 0.57 versus 0.52 in survivors, p less than 0.05). Improved survival was associated with an end-diastolic short-axis dimension less than 7.63 cm, a short- to long-axis ratio less than 0.76 and a meridional to circumferential stress ratio less than 0.54. Life table analysis revealed a 28% mortality rate in patients with all three of these characteristics compared with 100% in patients with none.

  ".W": "To evaluate the influence of left ventricular chamber stiffness and relaxation on Doppler echocardiographic indexes of diastolic function, 35 patients (mean age 60 +/- 12 years) were examined; 24 had coronary artery disease and 11 (Group I) had no cardiovascular disease. Micromanometer left ventricular pressure was recorded simultaneously with Doppler echocardiograms of mitral valve inflow and M-mode echocardiograms of left ventricular diameter. The chamber stiffness constant (k) was derived from the pressure-diameter relation. Relaxation was assessed by the isovolumic relaxation time constant (tau) derived from the exponential left ventricular pressure decay. The patients with coronary artery disease were classified into two groups on the basis of complete (Group II; n = 10) and incomplete (Group III; n = 14) relaxation. In Group I (no coronary disease), significant correlations were demonstrated between the chamber stiffness constant and the peak early filling velocity (r = 0.73; p less than 0.02), peak early to atrial filling velocity ratio (r = 0.82; p less than 0.005), atrial time-velocity integral (r = -0.73; p less than 0.02), early to atrial time-velocity integral ratio (r = 0.70; p less than 0.05), percent atrial contribution to filling (r = -0.64; p less than 0.05) and one-half filling fraction (r = 0.73; p less than 0.02). In Group II (coronary disease with complete relaxation), the chamber stiffness constant correlated with peak early filling velocity (r = 0.68; p less than 0.05), early filling time-velocity integral (r = 0.65; p less than 0.05) and early to atrial time-velocity integral ratio (r = 0.74; p less than 0.02). No correlations between k and Doppler indexes were found in Group III (coronary disease with incomplete relaxation). However, Group III demonstrated significant correlations between tau and the peak early filling velocity (r = -0.71; p less than 0.005), percent atrial contribution to filling (r = 0.56; p less than 0.05) and mean acceleration rate of early filling (r = -0.79; p less than 0.002). Thus, in subjects with normal relaxation, increasing chamber stiffness was associated with an enhanced peak early filling velocity and volume and decreased filling during atrial systole. This finding differs strikingly from the proposed influence of chamber stiffness on diastolic filling postulated by several researchers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of this instrument in measuring cardiac output in critically ill patients by comparing results with those of the thermodilution-derived cardiac output. A technically adequate Doppler cardiac output measurement was attained in 71 (91%) of 78 patients. The range of thermodilution-derived cardiac output measurements was from 1.58 to 11.70 liters/min. To maximize thermodilution cardiac output reliability, several measurements were made for each patient. Those patients in whom the difference between the highest and lowest measurement varied by less than 10% from the averaged results were accepted into the 50 patient study. There was significant correlation between dual beam Doppler- and thermodilution-derived cardiac output (r = 0.96, SEE = 0.55 liters/min, p less than 0.0001). This study demonstrates that dual beam Doppler ultrasound is a promising noninvasive method of measuring cardiac output in the critically ill patient.\r"

Further, assessment of regional wall motion has only infrequently been approached in a systematic way. A system of right ventricular ejection fraction and volume measurements is described that utilizes the previously validated single plane geometric method applied to first pass radionuclide angiocardiograms. Five right ventricular chords were defined and used to assess regional wall motion; normal values were obtained from 14 patients who were without demonstrable cardiac disease. Among 23 patients with anterior myocardial infarction, the right ventricular ejection fraction was within 2 SD of normal in 16; however, 3 of these patients showed regional wall motion abnormalities in the right ventricle. Of 21 patients with inferior myocardial infarction, right ventricular ejection fraction was reduced in 15; of the 6 with normal values, 3 had regional wall motion abnormalities as demonstrated by the chord shortening method. Of 21 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, right ventricular function was abnormal in 20; the presence of a wall motion abnormality in the conus segment separated these patients from patients with right ventricular dysfunction after recent myocardial infarction. Thus: 1) right ventricular ejection fraction, volumes and wall motion can be assessed by a simple, geometric technique; 2) analysis of chord shortening by this method provides information unavailable from global ejection fraction data alone; and 3) the clinical correlates of these data will require further investigation.\r"

A specially made balloon, fixed at the catheter tip, and an angulation mechanism made a precise coaxial alignment possible in the coronary lumen. This angioscopic catheter, 1.22 mm in outer diameter, has four channels, one for irrigation in which a 0.36 mm (0.014 in.) angioplasty guide wire can be used. With the use of this angioscope, coronary lumens in 8 dogs, thrombi that were produced with copper coils in the left anterior descending coronary artery in 11 dogs, atherosclerotic coronary arteries in 20 patients during cardiac catheterization and the sequence of transluminal coronary angioplasty in 1 patient were observed. The angioscopic catheter was introduced into the coronary artery by an 8F guide catheter. The steerable guide wire enabled the angioscopic catheter to be accurately and safely inserted into the target lesion in all cases. The inflated balloon and angulation mechanism allowed a curved coronary lumen and atheroma to be seen with a limited volume of irrigation fluid. Visualization was good (complete visualization of the inner lumen) in 46% (10 of 22 lesions), moderate (visualization of greater than 50% of the inner lumen) in 36% (8 of 22 lesions) and poor (visualization of less than 50% of the inner lumen) in 18% (4 of 22 lesions) in humans. There were no major complications. These preliminary experiences in closed chest cardiac catheterization in dogs and in humans indicate the feasibility of this angioscope. The information yielded by angioscopy may be clinically useful in the study of the pathophysiologic changes in coronary disease that are not detected by coronary arteriography.\r"

To determine whether fractionated sinus rhythm electrograms are associated with slow conduction in humans, the results of endocardial catheter mapping and pacing at 133 endocardial sites in 13 patients were analyzed. Eleven patients had sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia and two patients had old myocardial infarction without ventricular tachycardia. Functional evidence of slow conduction at the recording site was assessed by pacing at that site and measuring the interval between the stimulus artifact (S) and the onset of the QRS complex in the 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG). During pacing at 89 of 90 sites without fractionated sinus rhythm electrograms, the S-QRS interval was less than 40 ms, a value consistent with rapid propagation of the stimulated wave front away from the pacing site. During pacing at 21 (49%) of 43 sites with fractionated sinus rhythm electrograms, the S-QRS interval was greater than 40 ms (range 40 to 140), consistent with slow conduction at the pacing site (p less than 0.001 versus nonfractionated sites). In 9 of the 11 patients with ventricular tachycardia analysis of the paced QRS configuration, electrograms during induced ventricular tachycardia or programmed stimulation during tachycardia suggested that a site with a long S-QRS interval during pacing was located at or near a ventricular tachycardia circuit. Therefore, fractionated sinus rhythm electrograms are often associated with slow conduction, which may be the substrate for reentrant ventricular tachycardia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

An abnormal signal-averaged ECG at 40 Hz high pass filtering had a higher sensitivity (81% versus 75%) and specificity (65% versus 61%) than at 25 Hz high pass filtering. The predictive value of the signal-averaged ECG was superior to that of the ejection fraction (40% versus 20%) in anterior wall myocardial infarction, whereas in patients with inferior wall infarction, the predictive values of the two tests were equivalent.

In Group B (22 patients) induction of this arrhythmia was followed by the induction of sustained ventricular tachycardia.

Similarly, the induced self-terminating ventricular tachycardia differed in Group A and Group B patients. The arrhythmias in Group B patients were more often monomorphic, were more often induced with one or two extrastimuli and had a longer cycle length than those in Group A patients.

Sixteen patients with an overt (n = 9) or concealed (n = 7) accessory pathway had inducible orthodromic tachycardia by S2 during an atrial drive (S1) cycle length of 500 to 650 ms. A ventricular extrastimulus (S3) was introduced coincident with the His depolarization resulting from S2 during the longest S1S2 interval that reproducibly induced orthodromic tachycardia. The S1S3 interval was decreased in 10 ms steps until S3 reached ventricular refractoriness. Retrograde accessory pathway conduction of S3 in the presence and absence of S2 was compared at the same S1S3 intervals. In the absence of S2 there was retrograde accessory pathway conduction after S3 in each patient. In the presence of S2, in patients with overt pre-excitation, retrograde accessory pathway conduction after S3 was absent in one patient, prolonged in four patients and present only after long S1S3 intervals in three patients. Only one patient had unchanged retrograde conduction regardless of the presence or absence of S2. In patients with a concealed accessory pathway, retrograde accessory pathway conduction after S3 was absent in five patients and was prolonged in two. Thus, concealed anterograde accessory pathway conduction was present in 15 of 16 patients at the time of orthodromic tachycardia induction. In conclusion, concealed anterograde accessory pathway conduction occurs in a majority of patients with an overt or a concealed accessory pathway during induction of orthodromic tachycardia by an atrial extrastimulus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In all subjects, measurements were obtained of brachial mean arterial pressure and pulse pressure, cardiac mass (judged on echocardiography) and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity together with ultrasound determinations of aortic arch diastolic and systolic diameter (suprasternal window). For each subject, pulsatile change in aortic diameter, strain and aortic arch elastic modulus were calculated. Compared with normal subjects, the hypertensive subjects showed an increase in aortic arch diameter (diastolic diameter 29.6 +/- 1.0 versus 25.4 +/- 1.0 mm, p less than 0.01), in elastic modulus (1.071 +/- 0.131 versus 0.526 +/- 0.045 10(5) N.m-2, p less than 0.001) and pulse wave velocity (11.8 +/- 0.5 versus 8.9 +/- 0.3 m/s, p less than 0.001). In the study group, a positive correlation was observed between diastolic aortic arch diameter and mean arterial pressure (r = 0.54, p less than 0.01) and between elastic modulus and cardiac mass (r = 0.60, p less than 0.01). Elastic modulus and age were positively correlated (r = 0.73, p less than 0.01) in hypertensive but not in normal subjects (r = 0.08, NS). This study is the first to demonstrate noninvasively that both the aortic arch diameter and the elastic modulus are increased in patients with sustained uncomplicated essential hypertension. These findings suggest that the increase in elastic modulus could influence the development of cardiac hypertrophy, and that both age and blood pressure act independently as factors that alter the arterial wall of subjects with sustained essential hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "The modified Fontan operation for complex cardiac anomalies associated with subaortic obstruction entails a high surgical risk. It is likely that ventricular hypertrophy secondary to chronic pressure overload plays a significant role. This problem was approached with a new type of palliative operation comprising both a proximal pulmonary artery to ascending aorta anastomosis and a bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis. This operation was performed in six children ranging in age from 26 to 63 months. There was one intraoperative death due to hemorrhage. In one patient, a pulmonary to aorta conduit caused compression of the right coronary artery; the problem was solved by lengthening the conduit with a second period of cardiopulmonary bypass. The five survivors experienced an uneventful postoperative course. Repeat cardiac catheterization in these five patients showed low pressure in the cavopulmonary system (mean 10 mm Hg), absence of a gradient at rest between the systemic ventricle and aorta and fair arterial oxygenation (mean 82%). A technetium-99m perfusion lung scan visualized a slight prevalence of pulmonary blood flow ipsilateral to the shunt in three cases, whereas in one case preferential flow to the right lung was associated with a narrowing at the site of the cavopulmonary anastomosis. Mild hypoperfusion of the anterior pulmonary segments was observed in two cases. Both pressure and volume overload are abolished with this procedure and a satisfactory oxygenation is provided. Low venous pressure in the coronary, hepatic and renal areas as well as the short bypass time may explain the smoothness of the postoperative course in our patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89109862\r", 
  ".W": "Nonsyndromic familial supravalvular aortic stenosis is an autosomal dominant disorder. However, for many reported families, systematic study of all family members with echocardiographic or hemodynamic techniques has not been performed and degree of penetrance has not been assessed. The supravalvular stenosis in these family members usually is not associated with mental retardation or other characteristics of Williams syndrome. Although some believe that autosomal dominant supravalvular aortic stenosis is part of the spectrum of Williams syndrome, others believe that these are separate entities. Doppler echocardiograms were analyzed on 23 members of a 34 member family with several known to have supravalvular aortic stenosis; 20 studies were performed by the authors and 3 were done elsewhere and made available for review. No family member had mental retardation, characteristic facies or other findings of Williams syndrome. Three of the 34 had supravalvular aortic stenosis requiring surgery. Of 22 members examined echocardiographically who had not had prior surgical repair, 13 had supravalvular aortic stenosis. Echocardiographic findings ranged widely, from calcification of the ascending aorta in a 71 year old man with minimally increased flow velocity (1.7 m/s) to mild narrowing with mildly increased flow velocity in six members to significant narrowing with impressively increased flow velocity (2 to 4 m/s) in seven. In addition, four patients had mild narrowing of pulmonary artery branches and eight had peak pulmonary artery flow velocity above normal. This study demonstrates complete penetrance with extremely variable expression in this family with autosomal dominant supravalvular aortic stenosis and emphasizes the importance of using echocardiographic techniques in studying the family members who are suspected of having an inherited cardiovascular disease.\r"

Thirty-five patients (7.6%) failed to respond or died during the initial oral or intravenous loading phase. The remaining 427 patients were discharged on treatment with oral amiodarone and followed up for up to 98 months. Recurrence of ventricular tachycardia or sudden cardiac death at 1, 3 and 5 years by life-table analysis was 19%, 33% and 43%, respectively, for patients discharged on amiodarone therapy. The sudden cardiac death rate was 9%, 15% and 21%, respectively, at 1, 3 and 5 years. Side effects were reported by 45% of patients after 1 year, by 61% after 2 years and by 86% after 5 years. Amiodarone was discontinued because of side effects in 14%, 26% and 37% of patients after 1, 3 and 5 years, respectively. Incidence rates of recurrence of arrhythmia, sudden cardiac death and side effects were highest in the early months and then decreased. By multivariate analysis, advanced age, low ejection fraction and a history of cardiac arrest were independent risk factors for sudden cardiac death during amiodarone therapy.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the time course of the functional consequences of progressive left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic left ventricular inflow and wall thinning variables were analyzed in 13 dogs before and 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after creation of perinephritic hypertension. Left ventricular echocardiograms were digitized for dimensions, mass and peak rates of wall thinning (-dh/dt/h) and cavity enlargement (dD/dt/D). Doppler recordings of left ventricular inflow were analyzed for peak early (E) and late (A) diastolic inflow velocities, their ratio and atrial filling fraction. At 2 weeks, systolic blood pressure increased from 151 to 233 mm Hg, wall stress from 52 to 80 kdynes/cm2 and posterior wall thickness from 0.68 to 0.84 cm (all p less than 0.05). Left ventricular mass increased from 90 to 115 g over 12 weeks (p less than 0.05). Heart rate, cavity size and systolic shortening were unchanged at all data points. Diastolic abnormalities accompanied the developing hypertrophy and included impairment of early function, as demonstrated by a peak rate of wall thinning, from -13.4 to -8.9 l/s at 2 weeks (p less than 0.05), increased dependence on atrial systolic filling, a decrease in E/A from 1.68 to 1.29 at 4 weeks (p less than 0.05) and an increase in atrial filling fraction from 30% to 43% at 8 weeks (p = NS). Thus, diastolic dysfunction is an early consequence of experimental left ventricular hypertrophy. Different aspects of diastolic impairment are sensitively reflected by echocardiographic Doppler recordings, suggesting that these methods should be useful for the detection of diastolic dysfunction in human patients.\r"

  ".U": "89109870\r", 
  ".W": "It was hypothesized that regional myocardial blood flow could be measured using myocardial contrast echocardiography. Accordingly, arterial blood was perfused into the coronary circulation in 16 dogs. In Group 1 dogs (n = 8), blood flow to the cannulated left circumflex artery was controlled with use of a roller pump, whereas in Group 2 dogs (n = 8) blood flow to the left anterior descending coronary artery was controlled by a hydraulic occluder placed around it. Sonicated microbubbles (mean size 4 microns) were used as the contrast agent. In Group 1 dogs the microbubbles were injected subselectively into the left circumflex artery, whereas in Group 2 dogs they were injected selectively into the left main coronary artery and two-dimensional echocardiographic images were recorded. Computer-generated time-intensity curves were derived from these images and variables of these curves correlated with transmural blood flow measured with radiolabeled microspheres. A gamma-variate function (y = Ate-alpha t) best described the curves, and alpha (a variable of curve width) correlated well with transmural blood flow at different flow rates in all Group 1 and Group 2 dogs (mean r = 0.81 and 0.97, respectively). Other variables of the curve width also correlated well with myocardial blood flow, but peak intensity had a poor correlation with myocardial blood flow in both groups of dogs (r = 0.39 and r = 0.63, respectively). When data from all dogs were pooled, Group 1 dogs still showed good correlation between variables of curve width and myocardial blood flow (r = 0.81); Group 2 dogs did not (r = 0.45). The difference between the two sets of dogs was related to the site of contrast agent injection. It is concluded that measurement of the transit time of microbubbles through the myocardium with two-dimensional echocardiography accurately reflects regional myocardial blood flow. Although injection of contrast agent selectively into the left main coronary artery only allows measurement of relative flow, it may be feasible to measure absolute flow by injecting contrast agent subselectively into a coronary artery. Myocardial contrast echocardiography may, therefore, offer the unique opportunity of simultaneously assessing regional myocardial perfusion and function in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "To analyze the influence of loading patterns on cardiac pump performance and cardiac relaxation [corrected], the effects of preload on peak length-tension relation [corrected] and of systolic load clamps on peak length-tension relation and on relaxation were analyzed in isolated cat papillary muscles. Preload reduction and early loading clamps induced a shift to the left of the peak length-tension relation, that is, a smaller muscle length for the same tension at peak shortening. Unloading clamps induced a shift to the right of the peak length-tension relation, that is, a larger muscle length for the same tension at peak shortening. The effects of load clamps on relaxation depended on when they were applied during isotonic shortening. Changes induced by load clamps could not be summarized in terms of enhanced or delayed relaxation, illustrating that shortening duration, isometric tension decline and isotonic lengthening have different determinants. In conclusion, not only peak or mean systolic pressure but also the entire loading pattern has to be taken into account whenever pressure-volume data or relaxation variables are interpreted.\r"

The safety and effectiveness of closed chest catheter desiccation in the coronary sinus with use of radiofrequency energy was studied. Radiofrequency energy (174 +/- 74 J) was applied between the distal electrode of a standard electrode catheter placed 3 to 6 cm inside the coronary sinus and a large posterior chest wall patch in 16 dogs. No arrhythmias or hemodynamic changes were observed. Three dogs were killed approximately 1 h after ablation and 13 after 2 to 4 weeks. Lesions in the atrioventricular (AV) sulcus were observed in 14 of 16 dogs. Lesions were 11.6 +/- 6 mm in length, 4.3 +/- 2.3 mm in width and 2.8 +/- 1.4 mm in depth. Microscopic examination showed well circumscribed areas of necrosis and fibrosis in the fat of the AV sulcus. The media and intima of the circumflex coronary artery were not involved nor was the endocardium or mitral apparatus damaged in any dog. Coronary sinus thrombus was present in 3 of 16 dogs. Large amounts of radiofrequency energy can be safely applied to the coronary sinus. The size and location of the lesions produced suggest that this technique may be useful for the interruption of left-sided accessory AV connections in humans.\r"
