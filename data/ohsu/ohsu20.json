  ".W": "Eight patients (seven male and one female) with symptomatic postoperative perineal hernias treated at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation from 1975 to 1986 are reviewed. The patients ranged in age from 43 to 68 years (mean, 61 years). Seven had previous abdominoperineal resections of the rectum and one had a pelvic exenteration. The first two patients underwent repair via a perineal approach and both had recurrences of their hernias. These recurrences, as well as the presenting hernias in the six later patients, were repaired with mesh placed through an abdominal approach. Of these, there was one recurrence, which was repaired via an abdominal approach. There was no operative mortality. Based on experience, the authors believe that the best method of repair for this uncommon problem, involves placement of Marlex mesh across the pelvic inlet through an abdominal approach. This allows attachment of the mesh to the lateral musculature and posterior sacral periosteum under direct vision. The anterior borders of the mesh can be secured to the apex of the vaginal or prostatic tissue. The placement of metallic clips to the edges of the mesh allows for confirmation of the mesh position by radiographic examination during follow-up.\r"

  ".W": "To assess whether the presence of backwash ileitis predisposed to the subsequent development of ileal pouchitis after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, 131 patients who had the operation were studied. Fifteen patients had nonspecific inflammation in the terminal ileum noted at the time of the operation, while 20 patients subsequently developed pouchitis. No correlation between the two conditions was found. Pouchitis developed in two of 15 patients (13 percent) with backwash ileitis and in 18 of 116 patients (16 percent) without the ileitis (P greater than 0.05). Among the 20 patients with pouchitis only two (10 percent) had had previous backwash ileitis. It is concluded that the presence of backwash ileitis does not predispose to later development of pouchitis, and so does not contraindicate use of the inflamed terminal ileum for construction of the ileal pouch and anastomosis.\r"

The remaining 11 patients were treated by a conventional staged operation. The operative mortality and complications were similar in both groups. The duration of hospital stay in the former was half of that in the latter. Of nine patients treated by subtotal or total colectomy with primary anastomosis, the average number of bowel movements three months after surgery was 1.8 per day. Intraoperative colonic irrigation was performed in five patients of the one-stage group and permitted a safe primary anastomosis. The immediate results of the one-stage operation were surprisingly good. The authors propose it as the treatment of choice for the majority of patients with obstructing carcinomas of the left colon and rectum.\r"

The patients were divided into three groups according to the primary site of infection: group 1, anorectal (14 patients); group 2, urologic (ten patients), and group 3, idiopathic (four patients). The overall mortality was 25 percent, 28.5 percent for the anorectal group and 10 percent for the urologic group, although this difference is not statistically significant. Necrotizing infections of anorectal origin were more severe and had a less typical way of presentation, with subsequent delay in diagnosis and a higher rate of myonecrosis. As a consequence, more debridements and more fecal derivations had to be performed. The etiologic agents were the same among the three groups and comprised a number of anaerobes (Bacteroides spp, gram-positive cocci) as well as aerobes (microorganisms belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae and S. faecalis). Necrotizing fasciitis was the pathologic picture of nine of ten patients with Fournier's gangrene of urogenital origin and seven of 14 with an anorectal source. Synergistic necrotizing cellulitis was identified in half of those secondary to anorectal origin and only one of those with a urologic source.\r"

Indomethacin treatment completely prevented the carcinogenic effect of methylazoxymethanol. Thus, no tumors were found in the 14 rat test group, compared with 13 of 14 tumor-bearing rats in the untreated control group. Although nordihydroguaiaretic acid treatment does not abolish prostaglandin synthesis, it does reduce the effect of the carcinogen and tumors were found in only five of 14 treated rats. From this study it can be postulated that not only is reduction in prostaglandin formation responsible for the inhibition of tumor growth, but also leukotrienes may play some role.\r"

The absorption of water, sodium, and chloride in the jejunum was significantly higher than in the neorectum. The net secretion rate of potassium increased significantly in the ileum and neorectum.

Forty-nine of these patients (8 percent) had adenomatous polyps. There were 27 males and 22 females. The mean distance examined by the 65 cm flexible sigmoidoscope was 55 cm. Five patients were excluded from analysis, leaving 44 patients who underwent colonoscopy to the cecum. At the time of colonoscopy, 15 of the 44 patients (34 percent) had one or more adenomatous polyps beyond reach of the 65 cm flexible sigmoidoscope. The remaining 29 patients who underwent colonoscopy had no polyps beyond reach of the 65 cm flexible sigmoidoscope. Thirty adenomatous polyps, one invasive carcinoma of the ascending colon, and one hyperplastic polyp were found in these 15 patients. In summary, 34 percent of patients found to have adenomatous polyps within reach of the 65 cm flexible sigmoidoscope harbored one or more adenomatous polyps in the proximal colon at the time of colonoscopy. A positive 65 cm flexible sigmoidoscope examination requires colonoscopy to identify and remove proximal premalignant lesions, thereby aborting the polyp-cancer sequence.\r"

We recently encountered a patient who presented with papules in the anal area. Human papillomavirus has been identified as the causative agent. Differentiation from Bowen's disease is usually possible due to the presence of multiple small lesions and the young age of the patients. The long-term consequences of bowenoid papulosis are still unknown. The presence of human papillomavirus in a female or her sexual partner places her at higher risk for cervical neoplasia. The treatment of bowenoid papulosis is ablation or 5-FU cream.\r"

A positive response was obtained in 78 of 92 colorectal cancer patients, but in none of the 20 normal controls. A positive response occurred in four of 34 patients with extracolonic malignancies and in approximately half of patients with colonic adenomas and in one third of patients with ulcerative colitis. The significance of positive results in these patients (with diseases considered premalignant) is unclear, and is being studied further. In patients with previous resection of colorectal cancers, positive responses were frequent during the first year following resection, and rare thereafter. The results suggest that this method may be useful as a clinical marker for colorectal cancer, and warrants further technical refinement and study of specific patient populations.\r"

Treatment consists of a training program with EMG feedback, followed by simulation of the defecation process, using oatmeal porridge. Patients are then given instructions to generalize the relaxation response in their daily lives. Treatment was completely successful in seven of ten patients. The three remaining patients learned to strain in the correct manner, but could not achieve generalization. Two of them underwent subtotal colectomy because of delayed colonic transit times, which subsequently resulted in normal evacuation. In the third patient, the generalization was most likely hampered by psychologic problems, for which she now receives psychotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Fecal stasis in an ileal reservoir may lead to overgrowth of bacteria and changes in mucosal morphology that are of future concern. Moreover, improper evacuation may lead to increased stool frequency and reduced continence. The aims of this study were: to compare the functional results of two types of ileal reservoirs constructed with an ileoanal anastomosis, to compare their emptying to a normal rectum as assessed by a radionuclide enema, and to correlate functional results with emptying. The reservoirs were made of two (J) or three (S) limbs of terminal ileum. Thirty-three patients (16 with J-pouch and 17 with S-pouch) and ten healthy controls were included in the study. There was no difference in the mean age of patients or interval following diverting ileostomy closure. Functional results were obtained by written questionnaire assessing stool frequency, and soiling, use of medication, need for intubation, and episodes of pouchitis. Emptying was measured with instillation per anus of a semisolid medium labeled with 1.0 mCi of Tc-99. Ileal pouch counts were measured using a scintillation camera and computer before and after spontaneous evacuation. The emptying was defined as the difference in counts divided by preevacuation counts. The functional results were similar in the two groups. Nocturnal soiling occurred more frequently in the S-pouch group. Pouchitis occurred in seven patients. Emptying of the two types of reservoir was similar (J: 72 +/- 4%, S: 67 +/- 5%), but it was less efficient than a normal rectum (90 +/- 3%, P less than 0.004). No correlation was established between age, sex, number of stools, pouchitis, and the efficacy of emptying. The clinical outcome of two patients who emptied less than 30%, however, was greatly improved by intermittent intubation. In conclusion, a semisolid radionuclide enema can be useful to identify patients who would benefit from intubation. No persistent defect in emptying was detected in patients with pouchitis.\r"

  ".W": "The records of 93 patients with colocutaneous fistulas associated with diverticulitis treated at the Cleveland Clinic between 1965 and 1983 were reviewed. There were 56 males and 37 females with an age range of 19 to 80 years (median, 57 years). Eighty-eight fistulas followed surgery for diverticulitis while five developed spontaneously. The presence of a diverting stoma in 34 patients did not prevent fistula formation but did decrease morbidity (x2 = 12.75, P less than 0.001). Initial investigations showed a high incidence of recent weight loss (in 40 percent) and hypoalbuminemia (47 percent), although these factors did not influence outcome. Patients with high output (greater than 200 cc/day) fistulas (n = 9) fared significantly worse than those with low outputs. There were 28 patients with fistulas to other organs, 20 involving small bowel. Factors leading to persistence of the fistulas included sepsis (42 cases) and sigmoid colon distal to an intended colorectal anastomosis (38 cases). Ninety-two patients underwent surgery, 80 percent having a one- or two-stage resection and anastomosis. There was one postoperative death and complications occurred in 44 patients (48 percent). Surgery was successful in producing patients without stoma or fistula in 71 cases (77 percent). There were five recurrent fistulas, 14 new fistulas, and 13 patients retained their stomas. A diagnosis of Crohn's disease was made in ten patients who had a high rate of complicated fistulas, recurrent fistulas, and retained stomas. Patients with carcinomas (n = 5) also did poorly, but those on systemic steroids (n = 7) fared no worse than patients not receiving them. This study emphasizes the role of diversion of the fecal stream in reducing the morbidity of colonic fistulas. It is clearly important to carry out a true colorectal anastomosis after resection for diverticulitis, and in patients with unusually complicated clinical courses, the diagnosis of Crohn's disease should be entertained.\r"

Fifteen multiple sclerosis patients had constipation and 14 had increased colonic transit time; ten multiple sclerosis patients had fecal incontinence and five had spontaneous rectal contractions.

  ".W": "The evaluation of suspected esophageal chest pain is frustrating because of difficulty in clearly implicating the esophagus. Balloon distention was considered as a new provocative test in the esophagus because it has been shown to safely produce pain in other hollow gastrointestinal organs. Studies were performed in 50 chest pain patients (mean age 50 years) with negative coronary arteriograms and 30 healthy volunteers (mean age 41 years). A polyvinyl balloon (length 30 mm; maximum diameter after 10 cc distention 25 mm) was positioned 10 cm above the lower esophageal sphincter and inflated with 1-cc increments of air to a total volume of 10 cc. Using a placebo-controlled design, pain response was recorded along with associated balloon volumes. Pain occurred in 28/50 (56%) patients and 6/30 (20%) volunteers (P less than 0.005). Symptoms were unassociated with ECG changes, and resolved immediately with decompression of the balloon. Most patients (24/28) experienced their typical chest pain at less than or equal to 8 cc distention, while all volunteers with pain noted it at greater than or equal to 9 cc distention. For this reason, 8 cc was considered a diagnostic cutoff. Chest pain patients were also studied with two other commonly used provocative tests: intraesophageal acid perfusion and intravenous edrophonium (80 micrograms/kg). These tests reproduced pain in only 12 (24%) patients. Positive balloon studies occurred in 11 of these patients and identified an additional 13 patients, thus increasing the diagnostic yield from 24% to 48%. Only one of 22 (4%) balloon-negative patients had a positive acid-perfusion or edrophonium test.\r"

The isoenzyme was found in 22 patients (17.7%), more often in the patients with abnormal pancreatic function (40.5%) than in those with normal function (8.0%). Before the subtraction of the salivary isoamylase component, total amylase output was falsely normal in three of 37 patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. It is concluded that measurement of amylase isoenzymes rather than of total amylase during the secretin-pancreozymin test may be recommended for scientific purposes. It may also improve discrimination between normal and abnormal exocrine pancreatic function if amylase is chosen as the only parameter for evaluation of pancreatic enzyme secretion.\r"

In six subjects, the tube was also equipped with three catheters whose tip opened 1 cm aborad from each electrode, for pressure recordings. In six other subjects, the tube was equipped with both electrodes and a catheter opening at the tip of the probe for infusing fluids at a rate of 12 ml/min into the colonic lumen. The fluid was collected with another tube inserted in the rectum and the volume was measured at 1-min intervals. Colonic spiking activity was made of rhythmic stationary bursts (RSB) and of sporadic bursts that were either propagating (SPB) or not propagating (SNPB). All sporadic bursts were associated with intraluminal pressure waves whose amplitude was significantly higher than that associated with rhythmic bursts. In the infusion experiments, the volume of fluid collected did not change significantly whether rhythmic bursts were present or not (3.9 +/- 1.7 ml/min and 3.3 +/- 1.9 ml/min respectively) (mean +/- SD). However, the volume was significantly higher when sporadic nonpropagating bursts were present (9.4 +/- 4.1 ml/min), and even higher when the sporadic bursts were propagating (21.6 +/- 8.8 ml/min). These results indicate that the occurrence of sporadic bursts, particularly when propagating, is associated with intraluminal pressure waves that lead to significant propulsive movements; and rhythmic bursts do not seem to be involved in colonic propulsive activity.\r"

In four separate studies, pairs of infant goats served as subjects. One of each pair received an oral inoculum of freshly harvested Mycobacterium species strain Linda suspended in cream. A littermate or stablemate which received only cream served as control. Necropsies were done at three, five, six, and 10 months postinoculation. Each of the four inoculated animals developed segmental granulomatous disease of the ileum or ileum and more proximal segments of small intestine, and regional lymph nodes. The earliest lesion occurred in Peyer's patches of the ileum and consisted of granulomatous clusters of epithelioid cells and giant cells, without caseation, which often occurred in a mantle of lymphocytes between the germinal centers and the muscularis mucosae. Nine of 10 such granulomas were free of acid-fast bacilli. In more advanced lesions, there was confluence of granulomas and ulceration of the mucosal surface. Two of the four inoculated animals also had lymphocytic lymphangitis in affected segments. Although the Mycobacterium Linda was recovered from intestinal segments of all four animals, acid-fast bacteria were not demonstrable in the intestines in two of them. Control animals remained free of lesions and acid-fast bacilli and were negative by bacteriologic culture. The Mycobacterium species strain Linda represents an enteric pathogen capable of inducing granulomas of the distal small intestine of susceptible species. The lesions produced have distinct similarities to those occurring in Crohn's disease.\r"

Denervation of the gastric antrum (antral vagotomy) abolished the early part of the gastrin response to food. Truncal vagotomy, celiac ganglionectomy, and atropine reduced the early release of CCK, which occurred before the start of gastric emptying, suggesting that a neural, cholinergic mechanism may release CCK immediately after a meal. PP release was abolished by truncal vagotomy, and also by antral vagotomy. As no direct pathways are known between the antrum and the pancreas, this suggests either that antral afferents are essential for this response or that vagally mediated hormone release from the antrum mediates PP release.\r"

  ".W": "Of 542 gastric cancer patients operated in the period between 1976 and 1982, we found early gastric cancer (EGC) in 80 cases (15.3%). Patients with EGC did not show specific symptoms if compared with patients affected by gastric or duodenal peptic ulcer, gallstones, functional disorders of the upper gastrointestinal tract, or advanced gastric cancer (AGC). Single-contrast radiology showed a low sensitivity, especially in the depressed lesions. In contrast, endoscopy alone diagnosed 64 EGCs (80.0%) as malignant lesions. The five-year overall survival rate of the EGC patients was 85.9% and that of AGC patients was 43.8%. From a pathological point of view, our results confirm the usefulness of the studies on EGC for the comprehension of gastric carcinogenesis. The clinical relevance of EGC is linked to the good prognosis; however, the absence of clear symptoms and lack of alternative diagnostic methods to the endoscopy cast some doubts on the feasibility of mass detection programs.\r"

  ".W": "We tested a manometric assembly employing a sleeve sensor that is able to monitor anterior or posterior pressure in the human upper esophageal sphincter (UES) for prolonged intervals. When compared to rapid pull-through measurement of UES pressure obtained with conventional manometric assemblies, the sleeve sensor measured significantly lower UES pressures with less variability between subjects, thereby suggesting that the rapid pull-through maneuver stimulates the UES to contract. Concurrent recordings of UES pressure with a sleeve sensor and a side-hole sensor during a slow station pull-through yielded almost equal pressure values at the peak of the high-pressure zone (station zero), but the side-hole site recorded significantly lower pressures than the sleeve at stations 0.5 cm or more from the peak of the high-pressure zone. During 10 min of recording at station zero, the sleeve sensor recorded greater pressures than the side-hole sensor. This finding demonstrated the suceptibility of the side-hole sensor to axial movement relative to peak UES pressure. When stationary, both the sleeve sensor and the side-hole sensor recorded significantly lower UES pressure after 1-2 min of recording, again suggesting that movement of the recording assembly stimulates the UES to contract. Sleeve recordings of swallow-induced UES relaxations showed that UES relaxations induced by water swallows were slightly longer than those induced by dry swallows. Augmentations of UES pressure induced by balloon distension of the esophageal body were also recorded. We conclude that the sleeve sensor is a suitable method for investigating the normal physiology and pathophysiology of the UES in human subjects.\r"

Amino acids were found to stimulate pancreatic output of trypsin and release CCK, while a saline infusion at the same rate and osmolality (320 mosm/liter) failed to do so. In the presence of atropine, the amino acid infusion did not stimulate the pancreatic output of trypsin, despite an augmented CCK release. The total CCK released above baseline was greatest with the infusion of amino acids with atropine, while the total trypsin output above baseline was greatest with the infusion of amino acids. These results indicate that CCK release is not under cholinergic control and that cholinergic blockade inhibits pancreatic secretion by interrupting stimulating cholinergic fibers to the pancreas.\r"

Simultaneously, antropyloric and intestinal motility was studied in order to establish a relationship between motility and duodenogastric reflux. A different pattern of duodenogastric reflux was observed, depending on the method utilized. While a significantly higher reflux was observed during phase II in bile acid studies, an irregular pattern not related to the different phases of the interdigestive motor complex was observed in experiments with phenol red. Antral motility estimated by an antral motility index showed a statistically significant correlation with DGR estimated by both methods. Pyloric pressure and intestinal motility did not show a correlation with DGR. We concluded that the results obtained in studying duodenogastric reflux depend on the method used. The main factor related to increased duodenogastric reflux was the decreased antral motility.\r"

In the present study on cats, a meat meal significantly augmented the maximal acid response from a Heidenhain pouch (HP) to pentagastrin or to human synthetic gastrin I by 31 and 30%, respectively. The maximal HP acid response to pentagastrin was augmented also by peptone instilled into the stomach through a gastric fistula. Intravenous infusion of amino acids stimulated acid secretion but did not augment the maximal acid response to pentagastrin. The plasma concentrations of gastrin and somatostatin increased during infusion of pentagastrin and gastrin I and were not further altered by simultaneous feeding. The present results indicate that the mechanism for potentiation of gastrin-induced acid secretion is of physiological significance, since feeding augmented also the acid response to heptadecapeptide gastrin, the only gastrin secreted from the antrum and duodenum in cats. The potentiation of acid secretion is not dependent on the vagal excitation induced by oral feeding, since potentiation was demonstrated also by intragastric peptone instillation. The mechanism for the potentiation is not due to absorbed amino acids or a decrease of plasma somatostatin.\r"

At eight months on a cereal-containing diet, jejunal biopsies from affected animals exhibited partial villus atrophy, increased intraepithelial lymphocytes, and distinct biochemical abnormalities in the brush border. Activities of alkaline phosphatase and leucyl-2-naphthylamidase were almost undetectable while disaccharidases were unaltered. Activity of 5'-nucleotidase (basolateral membrane) was low, and reduced malate dehydrogenase reflected a loss of mitochondrial activity, but other organelles were unaffected. Recovery was achieved on a wheat-free diet. Relapse on subsequent wheat challenge was characterized by partial villus atrophy and a selective effect on the brush border: modal density was decreased and there was a severe loss of brush-border alkaline phosphatase activity. These findings document a wheat-sensitive enteropathy in Irish setter dogs and suggest that brush-border alkaline phosphatase is specifically susceptible to damage by wheat.\r"

Liver biopsy disclosed dense fibrosis of hepatic arterial and portal venule walls, resulting in complete obstruction of some portal radicles.

Two deaths occurred in 1780 person-months of pump use. The cumulative proportion on the pump (CPOP) or actuarial CSII continuance proportion was 11%. There was no significant difference between sexes or between ages for men, but despite eliminating pregnant women, those greater than or equal to 30 yr old had a CPOP of 0.22, compared with 0.11 for those less than 30 yr (P = .03). Continuance curves were no different for those beginning CSII with or without complications or for those with or without good glucose control. Those who began at patient request did have better CPOP than those who began at physician request (P = .05). Physician perception of clinical, mechanical, or psychosocial problems while on the pump was not predictor of continuance curves as measured by CPOP. Of the 17 physicians queried at the latest update, 9 physicians have 16 current CSII users; these 9 have only 14% of their patients in the original cohort currently on CSII. This is compared with the 3 physicians who have 34 current users and 60% of their original cohort on CSII. Four physicians no longer use CSII.

Consequently, the risk for acquiring coronary heart disease (CHD) in the next 8 yr calculated by the Framingham logistic regression equation shows a marked increase in risk for both men and women with diabetes (relative risk = 1.3 and 1.9, respectively). This calculated risk for CHD incidence predicts actual deaths from CHD, cardiovascular disease, and all causes in diabetic individuals in the succeeding 15 yr. Baseline levels of cholesterol, blood pressure, and smoking in the NIDDM population were hypothetically reduced according to results achieved in recent coronary-risk intervention trials. Average population risk for CHD incidence was recalculated and compared with new risk estimates calculated by hypothetically eliminating diabetes in various proportions of the population. Crude estimates suggest that realistic attempts to lower one, two, or three coronary risk factors in the population would reduce calculated CHD risk equivalent to eliminating diabetes in 20, 40, and 60% of the population, respectively.\r"

Multiple measures were collected within each of several categories of psychosocial variables including knowledge, stress, depression, anxiety, diabetes-specific health beliefs, and social support. Findings indicate that approximately 25% of the variance in self-care behaviors can be explained by psychosocial and demographic variables. In contrast, psychosocial variables were not significant predictors of level of glycemic control. The diabetes-specific psychosocial measures of health beliefs and social support were the most consistent and strongest predictors of self-care behavior across the different regimen areas studied. Possible reasons for these findings, limitations of the study, and directions for future research are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The adipose conversion of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts depends on serum factors, one of which has been identified as GH. Human serum extracts obtained by heat treatment do not contain intact GH, as shown by RIA, but still support adipose conversion. After organic solvent extraction followed by reversed phase HPLC, two adipogenic fractions can be purified. Their identification as cortisol and cortisone follows from the observations that both glucocorticoid hormones are strongly adipogenic in physiological concentrations and elute upon reversed phase HPLC with retention times identical to those of the adipogenic fractions. After derivatization by acetylation, the adipogenic fractions purified from human serum again do not differ from C-21 monoacetyl cortisol and -cortisone with regard to adipogenic activity and behavior on reversed phase HPLC and TLC. Treatment of heat extracts from human serum with cortisol antibodies strongly reduced their adipogenic activity which could be restored only after addition of cortisol to the original concentration. We conclude from these results, that the adipogenic activity of human serum depends mainly on its glucocorticoid (as well as GH) concentration.\r"

  ".W": "We found previously that a human renal carcinoma cell line derived from a hypercalcemic patient induces humoral hypercalcemia when grown as allografts in the nude mouse and secretes a protein that activates adenylate cyclase via the PTH receptor. The purpose of this study was to examine the conditioned medium of this cell line for bone-resorbing activity in vitro. Processed conditioned medium produced dose-dependent stimulation of bone resorption in cultured fetal rat limb bone explants. Two PTH antagonists were used to assess the PTH receptor dependence of this bone-resorbing activity. Neither [8Nle,18Nle,34Tyr]bovine (b) PTH-(3-34) amide nor [34Tyr]bPTH-(7-34)amide inhibited bone resorption or limb bone cAMP accumulation induced by either processed conditioned medium or equivalent concentrations of bPTH-(1-34). As an alternate means to assess whether this tumor-derived PTH-like protein had intrinsic bone-resorbing activity, the latter was measured during partial purification of PTH-like adenylate cyclase-stimulating activity (ACSA) from conditioned medium by consecutive gel filtration and reverse phase HPLC. The bone-resorbing activity in conditioned medium could not be resolved from PTH-like ACSA by these two separation techniques, indicating that the activities may be intrinsic to the same protein. These results are consistent with the view that a tumor-derived protein with PTH-like ACSA and bone-resorbing activity may be responsible for hypercalcemia in vivo.\r"

RIAs showed that the antibody also bound the beta-subunits of bLH, oLH, hLH, and hCG, but not the beta-subunits of porcine LH and TSH. Preincubation of [125I]iodo-bTSH with the antibody completely inhibited binding of the hormone to the TSH receptor of bovine thyroid membrane preparations at pH 7.4 in 50 mM NaCl (ED50 = 10 nM). The antibody also inhibited TSH-induced mitogenesis of FRTL-5 cells (ED50 = 50 nM). We conclude that the antibody binds to a site on the bTSH molecule that participates in high affinity binding of hormone to physiological TSH receptor. The target epitope includes a conserved structural determinant in beta-subunits of the glycoprotein hormones as well as a feature that allows discrimination of porcine hormones from those of bovine, ovine, and human origin.\r"

A specific estrogen binding component having properties of a receptor was found in vitro in both soluble and insoluble fractions of these tissues in a hypotonic buffer solution. The administration of E2 in vivo caused a marked decrease in the estrogen receptor binding in the soluble fraction with a concomitant increase in binding in the insoluble fraction; as a result, total binding (sum of the bindings in soluble and insoluble fraction) did not change.\r"

  ".W": "Choline metabolism and phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis were studied in renocortical slices of rats rendered diabetic with streptozotocin. The rates of [14C]choline incorporation into both acid-soluble and acid-insoluble fractions were increased in diabetic relative to control kidneys. While choline uptake into the control kidneys reached a plateau after 30 min of incubation, the tissue uptake of choline by the diabetic kidneys showed a time-dependent increase over 120 min, rising to a level exceeding that of control kidneys. In the control kidney, the oxidation of choline to betaine was similar to the level of phosphocholine accumulation during the first 30 min, while the formation of phosphocholine in the diabetic kidney was 1.9-fold higher than that in the control kidney (P less than 0.02) and 1.4-fold higher than the formation of betaine in diabetics (P less than 0.05). These data suggest that most of the choline transported into cells enters the Kennedy pathway by phosphorylation to phosphocholine in diabetic kidneys. The diabetic kidney also demonstrated a marked increase in the formation of three choline-containing phospholipids; phosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin. The treatment of diabetes with insulin restored these abnormalities toward normal. The absolute content of phosphatidylcholine significantly increased in diabetic kidneys (P less than 0.05) while contents of other major phospholipids and total lipid phosphorus in diabetic kidneys were not different from those in control kidneys. Our results indicate that renal hypertrophy in experimental diabetes is associated with a stimulation of the biosynthesis of renal phosphatidylcholine, presumably caused by an enhanced tissue uptake of choline and a stimulation of choline kinase. Since an enhancement of the membrane phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis is one of the early responses to growth signals, an alteration in phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis may contribute to the development of renal hypertrophy in experimental diabetes.\r"

Renal mitochondrial metabolism of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25OHD3) was initially examined in vitamin D- and calcium-deprived normal and mutant mice (with no detectable 24-hydroxylase) treated with either calcium, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3], or both calcium + 1,25-(OH)2D3. In normal mice, 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment was more effective than calcium in turning off 1-hydroxylase and turning on 24-hydroxylase activity; serum calcium, however, was similarly increased by both treatments. Although calcium + 1,25-(OH)2D3 did not result in a further change in 25OHD3 metabolism in normal mice, a further elevation in serum calcium was apparent. In Hyp mice, treatment with calcium + 1,25-(OH)2D3 resulted in a greater decrease in 1-hydroxylase and a greater increase in 24-hydroxylase and in serum calcium than treatment with either agent alone. In spite of similar serum calcium levels in both genotypes, 24-hydroxylase was 20-fold, 3-fold, and 8-fold greater in Hyp mice relative to normals treated with calcium, 1,25-(OH)2D3, and calcium + 1,25-(OH)2D3, respectively. Kinetic studies revealed that the maximum velocity (Vmax) for induced 24-hydroxylase was 6-fold greater than normal in Hyp mice whereas the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) was not different in the two groups of calcium + 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated mice. The effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment on the above serum and renal parameters was also examined in vitamin D replete normal and Hyp mice. A sharp rise in serum phosphate was observed in 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated Hyp mice whereas normal littermates experienced marked hypercalcemia in response to treatment. Renal 24-hydroxylase was significantly stimulated by 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment in both normal and Hyp mice and genotype differences were not apparent. The present study demonstrates that vitamin D- and calcium-deprived Hyp mice are more responsive to signals which induce 24-hydroxylase than normal littermates; Vmax for induced 24-hydroxylase is 6-fold greater in Hyp mice than in normal littermates whereas apparent Km is unchanged; the inhibitory control of 1-hydroxylase appears to be intact in the mutant strain; induced 24-hydroxylase is similar in vitamin D replete normal and Hyp mice; and vitamin D status can thus modify the response of both genotypes to treatment with 1,25-(OH)2D3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Rats were implanted with E2-filled or empty Silastic capsules for 21 days alone or in conjunction with pellets of the potent DA agonist bromocriptine (CB-154). Changes in vascularization of the AP, median eminence DA content, and responsiveness to DA of cultured AP cells were measured. Development of a direct arterial blood supply was assessed by the injection of 15-microns microspheres that can only reach the AP by newly formed arteries (arteriogenesis). APs were enzymatically dispersed and cultured for 3 days before challenges with increasing concentrations of DA for 3 h. DA content was measured by radioenzymatic assay, and serum PRL was determined by RIA. E2 treatment increased the weight of the pituitary gland, serum PRL levels, and the number of microspheres in the AP 4.5-, 173-, and 142-fold, respectively, over control values. Median eminence DA content was decreased 71% by E2 treatment, while the ability of DA to suppress PRL secretion in vitro decreased from a maximum of 70% to 40% with no change in the ED50. Simultaneous treatment with CB-154 dramatically decreased the effect of E2 on arteriogenesis, pituitary weight, serum PRL levels, and median eminence DA content. Blockade of E2-induced AP enlargement by increased dopaminergic stimulation was closely correlated with inhibition of arteriogenesis, which further suggests an important role for vascular changes in lactotroph proliferation.\r"

The purpose of this study was to identify the GABA receptor(s) involved by determination of the effect of specific receptor agonists and antagonists on the release of immunoreactive MSH from superfused neurointermediate lobes of Xenopus. Exogenous GABA induces a rapid inhibition of MSH secretion. There was no evidence for a transitory stimulatory effect of GABA as reported for the rat melanotropes. Both the GABA agonists (GABAa) homotaurine and isoguvacine and the GABA agonist (GABAb) baclofen inhibited MSH release in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo, homotaurine and baclofen caused aggregation of pigment in dermal melanophores. The MSH release-inhibiting effect of homotaurine and isoguvacine could be antagonized by the specific GABAa receptor antagonist bicuculline. However, bicuculline and picrotoxin failed to block the effect of exogenous GABA. We conclude that in the neurointermediate lobe of Xenopus laevis both GABAa and GABAb receptors are present, suggesting a dual inhibitory regulation.\r"

  ".W": "Most studies of lipoprotein requirements for steroid secretion by the adrenal have examined the mixed cell population of the whole gland; none have examined lipoprotein requirements of guinea pig adrenocortical cells. In this study the effect of exogenous lipoprotein on the ability of cells from each of the different regions of the guinea pig adrenal cortex to synthesize and secrete steroids has been analyzed in vitro, under baseline and ACTH-stimulated conditions. Most studies have assessed the effects of lipoprotein on one or a few selected steroids. In this study the effects of lipoprotein and ACTH were examined both by an assay for fluorogenic steroids and by HPLC analysis of the spectrum of UV-absorbing steroids. Guinea pig outer adrenocortices, containing zona glomerulosa and zona fasciculata, maintained in vitro as fragments or as isolated cells, secreted at least 5 times more steroid than the inner cortex, predominantly zona reticularis, and were dependent upon lipoproteins for their secretion. Corticosterone (B) and cortisol (F) were the predominant products of both zones. Aldosterone (Aldo), 18-hydroxycorticosterone (18-OH B), deoxycorticosterone (DOC), 11 beta-hydroxyandrostenedione (11 beta-OH And), androstenedione (And), and deoxycortisol were less abundant products of the outer cortex, while the inner cortex secreted only very small amounts of these steroids. Each of the outer cortical cell types secreted a distinct spectrum of steroids. Aldo, 18-OH B, and DOC were characteristic of glomerulosa cells, but B was most prominent. Fasciculata cells secreted primarily F, with 11 beta-OH And as their next most prominent product. Low density lipoprotein (LDL) enhanced steroid secretion by glomerulosa cells to a greater extent than that by fasciculata cells, but the stimulation of LDL utilization by ACTH was greatest for fasciculata cells. LDL and ACTH also influenced the pattern of steroids secreted by each cell type. Addition of LDL to glomerulosa cells enhanced secretion of DOC and B, but not that of Aldo or 18-OH B. In fasciculata cell cultures, LDL enhanced secretion of both F and 11 beta-OH And. ACTH, particularly in the presence of LDL, stimulated secretion by glomerulosa cells of Aldo and 18-OH B, as well as that of F, And, and 11 beta-OH And. The combined presence of ACTH and LDL in fasciculata cell cultures preferentially stimulated secretion of F and B.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Comparison of protein sequence, amino acid composition, mol wt, purity, and immunocross-reactivity showed that except for the N-terminal methionyl group arising from the bacterial expression system, the recombinant and pituitary-derived cGHs were identical. When tested in a hypophysectomized rat growth assay, the recombinant and pituitary materials had the same specific bioactivity. Within 60 min after sc injection of rcGH (480-960 micrograms/kg) in chickens, plasma GH levels increased 4- to 6-fold and remained significantly elevated for at least 5 h. Thrice-daily injections from age 2-24 days had little effect on growth or feed consumption in either male or female broiler chicks. Plasma levels of insulin and triglycerides were significantly elevated by rcGH in 24-day-old females, but not in males. Injection of rcGH counteracted a reduction of tibia length observed in saline-injected controls. The rcGH had no effect on carcass protein, ash content, or nitrogen retention. It is important to note that exogenous GH can be a productivity-enhancing factor in other commercially important species. Administration of bovine GH to cows has been shown to induce a significant increase in milk production (28). This study shows that administration of rcGH to chickens can lead to some significant metabolic effects. However, it is the conclusion of this report that the level of circulating GH is not the limiting factor in the growth of this highly selected species.\r"

The immediate output to 900 +/- 120 ng/ml GH in control animals was reduced to 200 +/- 69.4 ng/ml in selenium-treated animals. The somatomedin C level was reduced from 720 +/- 16 ng/ml in control to 119 +/- 17 ng/ml in selenium-treated animals. Both differences were highly significant.

Specific nuclear T3-binding sites were observed in liver of both species. Binding affinities for T3 and several analogs in lamprey and trout were similar to those in rat liver. The findings of identical sedimentation coefficients, Stokes radii, and mol wt suggest a high degree of homology of the receptor molecule among these species. In lamprey ammocoete, both total (approximately 26 nM) and free (approximately 0.12 nM) T3 concentrations were 7- to 36-fold higher than in the trout or rat. The concentration of free T4 was 4 times greater than that in rat plasma despite somewhat lower total T4 levels. This resulted from a 6 times lesser binding of T4 by ammocoete plasma. Total and free T3 and T4 levels fell sharply during transformation to the adult form. In trout, a 27 times greater concentration of free T3 in hepatic nuclei than in cytosol, previously documented for rat liver, gave evidence of the early evolution of an active transport process between these compartments. Analysis of [125I]T3 interchange in trout indicated the existence of two kinetically distinct compartments within the liver, an outer compartment in rapid equilibrium with plasma, and a slowly equilibrating compartment decaying with a t1/2 of 3.7 h. T3 associated with the nuclear receptor appeared to be in equilibrium with the slower hepatic compartment. Despite the apparent resemblance of T3 receptors in these species to those in the rat, administration of T3 (200 micrograms/100 g BW for 4 days) to trout caused no increase in hepatic oxygen consumption or the activities of malic enzyme or alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase. Further, such treatment produced no consistent changes in hepatic mRNA activity profiles analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis of in vitro translational products. As suggested by the high free T3 concentration in the larval lamprey ammocoete, T3 in early vertebrates may have a primarily developmental function, manifested over a restricted time frame.\r"

To determine whether such skeletal unloading also retards the maturation of bone, as seen in vitamin D-deprived animals, we fractionated by density the tibiae from rats whose hind limbs had been elevated for up to 15 days. These fractions were analyzed for dry weight, calcium content, and calcium and proline uptake. The most dense fraction (fraction 4) had the highest degree of mineralization (ratio of calcium to dry weight) and comprised 82% of the total dry weight of the control tibiae. The total incorporation of [3H]proline administered in vivo 24 h before removing the tibiae was evenly distributed among all of the fractions, although it was highest in the least dense fraction (fraction 1) when normalized to dry weight. Total incorporation of 45Ca was highest in fraction 4, although when normalized to dry weight it was highest in fraction 3. With skeletal unloading, the proportions of bone and 45Ca incorporation in fraction 4 decreased, while the proportions in less dense fractions increased. [3H]Proline incorporation fell in all fractions. These effects were maximal after 10 days of unloading and returned toward the control values after that time. We conclude that skeletal unloading transiently reduced bone formation and retarded mineralization in the growing rat, which resulted in a decrease in mature bone.\r"

  ".W": "This study was performed to clarify the physiological role of the ovary in regulating the glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) activity in rat Fallopian tubes. To this purpose, GAD activity of the oviduct was evaluated in the following experimental conditions: immature or adult castrated (CX) rats; immature or adult CX rats treated with graded doses of estradiol benzoate (EB) or a fixed dose of EB and progesterone; adult CX rats bearing Silastic implants able to produce steady state estradiol plasma levels in the range of diestrous values; and prepubertal rats treated with ovulatory or anovulatory doses of exogenous gonadotropins (PMS and hCG). Moreover, the possible fluctuations of both gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentrations and GAD activity in the Fallopian tubes were studied during the estrous cycle. The results show that the prepubertal rat oviduct possesses a GABA content and a GAD activity analogous to those of normal diestrous rats. The GAD activity measured with the CO2 formation method was well correlated with the formation of labeled GABA, indicating that tubes of prepubertal rats are able to form the neurotransmitter by means of specific decarboxylation of glutamate. GAD activity, but not GABA levels, was increased over control values by the administration of exogenous gonadotropins. The role of the ovary in both adult and prepubertal rats to regulate this enzymatic activity is further stressed by the results of the experiments performed in CX animals which showed that ovariectomy produced a 4- to 5-fold decrease in GAD activity independent of the age of the animals. However, implantation of Silastic estradiol-containing capsules in adult CX animals or the administration of EB for 5 days in a dose range from 0.001-6.4 micrograms/day to adult ovariectomized animals and from 0.001-0.2 microgram/day to prepubertal animals did not modify GAD activity in spite of marked peripheral estrogenization of the animals evidenced by increases in uterine weight. Moreover, no variation of the enzymatic activity was observed at puberty (assessed by the age at vaginal opening). The administration of progesterone (0.2 mg) plus EB (0.01 microgram) did not produce any significant variation in GAD activity. GABA content and GAD activity of the tubes did not change during the estrous cycle. We, therefore, believe that other ovarian, still unidentified, secretions might be involved in the regulation of GAD activity in rat Fallopian tubes.\r"

We report here the presence of mRNA coding for the opioid peptide precursor prodynorphin in rat ovary, uterus, and testis. Expression of this opioid peptide precursor gene is compared to expression of two other opioid peptide precursor genes, proenkephalin and proopiomelanocortin, in mammalian reproductive tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis reveals that in the rat testis, prodynorphin-derived peptides are present in Leydig cells. The distribution of dynorphin immunoreactivity in various reproductive tissues was determined. Male reproductive tissues of the rat, rabbit, and guinea pig as well as rat ovary and uterus all contain detectable levels of dynorphin immunoreactivity. These observations suggest that prodynorphin-derived peptides may exert paracrine and/or autocrine effects in mammalian reproductive tissues.\r"

The mean weight of the fasted rats at the beginning of the study was 263 +/- 10 g (+/- SEM) and was 177 +/- 7 g before killing, for a net loss of 33% of initial body weight; the 16 fed rats increased their mean weight from 225 +/- 11 to 284 +/- 12 g, for a net gain of 12%. During the 5-day fast there was no change in the weight of the cortex, hypothalamus, or brain stem. However, the weight of tissues from the gut decreased to about half the weight of the corresponding tissues in the fed animals. There was no significant change in brain VIP or CCK. VIP content in the gut was unchanged. However, because of the decrease in organ weight, its concentration almost doubled. Secretin concentrations in the gut of fasted rats did not change significantly, but organ contents fell to about half. The gut content of GLI also fell by half or more. The concentrations of CCK in methanol extracts of the duodenum and jejunum remained relatively constant, but those in acid extracts fell by 40% in the fasted animals. This represents an approximately 70% decrease in organ content of CCK. These findings are interpretable as demonstrating that during a prolonged fast neuronal CCK and VIP are well conserved, but endocrine CCK, secretin, and GLI are markedly decreased because of loss of intestinal mucosa.\r"

  ".W": "Immunoreactive insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) has recently been demonstrated in multiple tissues, including liver, kidney, lung, testes, and brain. Tissue IGF-I levels in hypophysectomized rats are elevated by GH. To examine whether tissue IGF-I production is regulated by local as well as systemic influences, we studied rat kidney IGF-I gene expression in renal compensatory hypertrophy occurring after unilateral nephrectomy. Northern analysis of kidney poly(A) RNA probed with [32P]IGF-I mouse cDNA revealed the presence of a mRNA species 1.3 kilobases in size. Dot hybridization of kidney poly(A) RNA showed that IGF-I mRNA was induced 5- to 6-fold in the kidneys of nephrectomized animals relative to levels in control sham-operated rats. This induction was present 24 h after surgery and continued for at least 7 days after the operation. Kidney radioimmunoassayable IGF-I content was also increased 73% in nephrectomized animals, although this was only apparent on the fourth day after surgery. In contrast, liver IGF-I mRNA levels were comparable in both experimental and control animals, suggesting that the IGF-I induction was specific to the tissue undergoing compensatory growth. Serum IGF-I and GH levels were not altered in nephrectomized and control animals for the duration of the experiments. These studies, therefore, confirm that IGF-I is synthesized in the kidney, and that kidneys undergoing compensatory growth have increased levels of IGF-I mRNA. This phenomenon occurs independently of changes in GH secretion, indicating that paracrine or autocrine factors are involved in the control of renal IGF-I production.\r"

  ".W": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the rat hepatic PRL receptor were produced and used for characterization of the receptor. A microsomal fraction from female rat liver was solubilized, purified 300- to 500-fold by affinity chromatography, and injected into mice. Two hybridoma clones (E21 and E29) were established, and immunoglobulin G fraction was obtained. Both E21 and E29 at 200 micrograms/ml could inhibit [125I]ovine PRL (oPRL) binding to microsomes from rat liver by 40% and 95%, respectively. E29 also inhibited PRL binding to solubilized receptors, whereas E21 stimulated PRL binding by about 50%. The action of E21 was markedly attenuated when [125I]human GH (hGH) was used as tracer in both microsomal (inhibition) and solubilized (stimulation) receptors. Specificity studies using microsomes from other tissues showed that both mAbs were specific to rat tissues (mammary gland, ovary, prostate, testis, and adrenal) and did not cross-react with tissues from other species (rabbit, mouse, human, pig, and cat) examined. Immunoprecipitation of PRL receptors with mAbs were assessed using 125I-labeled or [125I]oPRL-labeled PRL receptors. Both E21 and E29 were capable of immunoprecipitating a 44,000 mol wt band, the migration of which on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-electrophoresis gel was not affected by the absence or presence of a reducing agent. Only E21 was able to precipitate [125I]oPRL-receptor complexes. Binding studies of 125I-labeled mAb to microsomal receptors showed that oPRL could inhibit 90% of specific E29 binding, whereas inhibition of E21 binding was only 30%. Immunoblotting of PRL receptors confirmed the finding of immunoprecipitation; a band with a similar mol wt was identified with E21, although two closely located bands could be distinguished. There was no reaction in the presence of a reducing agent. These studies demonstrate that E21 recognizes a region distinct from the lactogen-binding site, while E29 binds to a closely related but not completely coincident domain; those regions recognized by both antibodies are specific to PRL receptors in the rat but not to those in other species; from immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting studies, the mol wt of the PRL receptor (or its subunit) is estimated to be 42-46K, similar to that reported for the rabbit mammary gland; this receptor molecule does not appear to bind to other receptor molecules through disulfide linkages; and hGH appears to recognize the PRL receptor-binding site in a somewhat different manner from that of oPRL.\r"

  ".W": "Estradiol binding kinetics and receptor activation were investigated using cytosol estrogen receptor from adult rabbit uterine endometrium and from the undifferentiated uteri of 2-week-old rabbits. The cytosol estrogen receptor from juvenile compared to that from adult rabbit uteri was lower (P less than 0.01) in concentration, was associated with reduced (P less than 0.01) titers of serum estradiol, and had a lower affinity for estradiol (Ka = 10(7) M-1). The equilibrium association constant (Ka) for the estrogen receptor from juvenile uteri was reduced by an increase in the dissociation rate constant (kd), as measured by [3H]E2 dissociation from the receptor. Enhanced steroid-receptor dissociation in juvenile uteri was correlated with a reduced rate (P less than 0.01) of receptor activation, as measured by the binding of steroid-receptor complex to DNA-cellulose. Because receptor activation was limited at elevated temperature (30 C), activation studies were performed at low temperature (0 C), and under these optimum conditions, the change in binding kinetics observed in the juvenile was correlated with a reduced rate of receptor activation. Equilibrium binding of [3H]E2 to the estrogen receptor exhibited positive cooperativity, as indicated by Hill coefficients of 3.39 +/- 0.12 and 3.44 +/- 0.11 for juveniles and adults, respectively. The ratio of bound to free steroid was decreased in cytosol from juvenile compared to adult uteri. Collectively, these results support the hypothesis that the increased off rate and decreased activation rate of estrogen receptor in immature rabbit uteri may represent a mechanism for the attenuation of estrogen action before sexual maturation.\r"

  ".U": "87105321\r", 
  ".W": "In previous studies we have shown that insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) has a mitogenic effect in a line of rat thyroid follicular cells, the FRTL-5. In view of this effect, we undertook studies to identify and characterize some physicochemical and binding properties of the receptor for IGF-I in these cells and to determine what role it plays in the mitogenic activity of insulin and insulin-like growth factors in the FRTL-5 cell. Binding of 125I-labeled IGF-I (biosynthetic Thr59-IGF-I) to FRTL-5 was a function of time, temperature, and pH and was completely inhibited by high concentrations of unlabeled IGF-I. Scatchard plots of four saturation studies revealed a single apparent binding site with an average Ka of 4.2 +/- 0.6 X 10(9) M-1 (mean +/- SD) and an average maximum binding capacity of 20 +/- 2 pm/100 micrograms cellular protein. Rat IGF-II (rIGF-II) and insulin were far less potent that IGF-I in inhibiting the binding of [125I] IGF-I, and bovine TSH was without effect. 125I-Labeled IGF-II also bound to FRTL-5 cells. Binding was completely inhibited by unlabeled rIGF-II and, with lesser potency, by IGF-I. Even at high concentrations, insulin failed to inhibit the binding of [125I]IGF-II. Disuccinimidyl suberate cross-linked [125I]IGF-I to a moiety in FRTL-5 that had an apparent mol wt of approximately 135,000, as judged from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. Cross-linking of [125I]IGF-I was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by unlabeled IGF-I and, with far lower potency, by rIGF-II and insulin. All three peptides stimulated the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into the DNA of FRTL-5 cells, IGF-I being the most potent, followed in decreasing order of potency of rIGF-II and insulin. The mitogenic activities of these polypeptides correlated well with their abilities to inhibit the binding of [125I]IGF-I. These data indicate that the FRTL-5 cell possesses a receptor for IGF-I that resembles in its binding and physicochemical properties the receptor for IGF-I in other tissues (type I IGF receptor) and that mediates the mitogenic response to IGF-I and insulin in these cells. FRTL-5 cells also contain a receptor for IGF-II (type II IGF receptor), but its role vis-a-vis that of the type I IGF receptor in relation to the mitogenic effect of IGF-II in these cells is uncertain.\r"

Increasing concentrations of membrane cholesterol (C/P) were associated with an increase in the number of ACTH receptors and, hence, production of cAMP and steroids without affecting the nature of binding (Kd) of ACTH to its receptor. Binding studies revealed spare ACTH receptors at all concentrations of membrane cholesterol. However, production of cAMP and steroids by Y-1 cells were tightly coupled. Studies with cholera toxin showed that extreme changes in C/P were without influence on the activity of Ns or that of the cyclase itself. It was also shown that production of steroids in the absence of ACTH and that in response to cholera toxin involve some effect of membrane cholesterol not dependent on cAMP.\r"

Thyroids from mutant mice are hypertrophied, deficient in colloid, show a reduced accumulation of iodine that is partially susceptible to perchlorate ion discharge, have modestly elevated serum immunoreactive thyroglobulin (Tg) levels, but are markedly deficient in glandular immunoreactive Tg content. Thyroid hormone therapy corrects the growth deficiency and prevents the thyroid hypertrophy resulting from excessive stimulation by TSH.

  ".W": "Sex steroid hormones have been shown to influence a number of biological properties of lymphoid neoplastic tissue. Since receptor occupancy is a function of the pool size of cellular exchangeable hormone, it is important to understand the mechanisms regulating hormone transport from the microcirculation and hormone metabolism, since these two pathways are the dominant factors controlling cellular exchangeable hormone. In the present studies, steroid hormone transport and metabolism were investigated in control and neoplastic lymph nodes after transplanting control rats with the WR-6 leukemic line. Steroid hormone transport and metabolism were studied after pulse labeling the nodal tissue in vivo with arterial bolus injections of [3H]testosterone. Residual vascular radioactivity was monitored by simultaneously injecting 113mindium chelated to bovine transferrin. Both testosterone and estradiol were partially available for transport through the capillary barriers of control and neoplastic lymph nodes from the circulating albumin-bound pool. Estradiol was readily available for transport from the circulating sex hormone-binding globulin-bound pool in both control and neoplastic lymph nodes. Testosterone was not available for transport from the sex hormone-binding globulin-bound pool in control lymph nodes, but was readily available for transport in metastatic lymph nodes. Thaw-mount autoradiography and physiological measurements showed that plasma proteins such as albumin or transferrin were confined to the microcirculation compartment. Therefore, the transport of protein-bound hormones into lymph node represents a mechanism of enhanced steroid hormone dissociation from the binding protein without the plasma protein per se significantly exiting the microcirculation compartment. Metabolic studies showed no measurable metabolism of [3H]testosterone in the control lymph nodes by 60 sec after arterial injection. However, testosterone was extensively metabolized in metastatic lymph nodes; the major metabolites formed from testosterone comigrated on a two-dimensional TLC system with epiandrosterone/androsterone and dihydrotestosterone. In conclusion, these studies indicate that both steroid hormone transport and metabolism are augmented in the lymphoid neoplastic state, and both processes may alter the concentration of cellular exchangeable hormone and, thus, steroid hormone receptor occupancy in lymphoid neoplasms.\r"

  ".W": "Estradiol regulates progesterone synthesis by the corpus luteum of several species. The molecular mechanism(s) of the action of estradiol is unknown, but appears to be independent of exogenous gonadotropins and tissue cAMP. A role for Ca2+ in steroidogenesis has been implicated, and we demonstrate here that estradiol alters Ca-specific protein phosphorylation in rat luteal cells. Corpora lutea obtained from rats hypophysectomized and hysterectomized on day 12 of pregnancy and subsequently treated for 3 days with vehicle or estradiol were assayed in vitro for Ca-specific phosphorylation. Estradiol elevated the content of a number of cytosolic proteins (mol wt X 10(-3), 58, 82, 100, 166, and 183); however, phosphorylation of the 100K protein alone appeared to be specifically enhanced by estradiol. In the presence of Ca2+, phosphorylation of the luteal 100K protein increased 2.33 +/- 0.2-fold in estradiol-treated vs. 1.42 +/- 0.2-fold in vehicle-treated rats (n = 6; P less than 0.05). Phosphorylation of 100K was inhibited by trifluoperazine and stimulated by calmodulin (CaM). Phosphopeptide maps revealed that the 100K luteal protein is identical to the cytosolic CaM-protein kinase III substrate, termed 100K, present in a number of tissues. Estradiol increased both 100K content and CaM-kinase III activity in luteal cells. Immunochemical analysis using antibodies prepared against pancreatic 100K revealed that estradiol treatment increased by at least 5 to 7-fold the luteal content of 100K. In addition, luteal cytosol of estradiol-treated rats enhanced phosphorylation of purified pancreatic 100K 3-fold, whereas that of vehicle-treated rats caused a 1.8-fold stimulation. The effects of estradiol on cytosolic proteins appear to be specific for 100K, since it does not after the activities of CaM-kinases I and II or cAMP-PK. In summary, results of this investigation demonstrate for the first time that estradiol increases the content of several proteins in the corpus luteum; estradiol enhances specifically the Ca-CaM-dependent phosphorylation of a 100K cytosolic protein; and the CaM-kinase III-100K substrate system is hormonally regulated.\r"

After immobilization, serum concentrations of T3 decreased significantly (6 hr, -33 +/- 1%; 8 h, -42 +/- 3%), while serum rT3 increased (6 h, +55 +/- 3%; 8 h, +75 +/- 5%). In the same or similarly treated animals, there was a time-dependent reduction in T4 5'-deiodinase activity in both liver (4 h, -23 +/- 2%; 8 h, -43 +/- 3%) and kidney (4 h, -18 +/- 1%; 8 h, -42 +/- 3%) homogenates. The reduction in hepatic and renal T3 production was due to reduced enzyme activity and not to reduced substrate availability. In spite of reductions in serum TSH (4 h, -9 +/- 1%; 8 h, -51 +/- 5%), the serum T4 concentration did not fall. The serum concentration of corticosterone reached 30 times the basal level after 8 h of restraint. Either adrenalectomy or metyrapone treatment, followed by replacement with nonstress doses of B, completely prevented the alterations of iodothyronine metabolism induced by restraint. These results indicate that the stress-induced elevation of plasma glucocorticoids plays a key role in the pathogenesis of the low T3 syndrome in this model. The reduction in serum T3 may be accounted for by a reduction in T3 production by liver and kidney, adding support to the concept that these organs are an important source of plasma T3 in the rat.\r"

  ".U": "87105340\r", 
  ".W": "The hepatic nuclear receptor for T3 is known to be approximately 50% saturated in vivo. Since the receptor dissociation constant (Kd) is 1 nM, and since 50% receptor occupancy occurs when the concentration of free ligand in the nucleus is 1 nM, the concentration of free T3 in the hepatic nucleus is also approximately 1 nM or about 200-fold greater than the concentration of free T3 in human serum, as measured in vitro by equilibrium dialysis. However, previous tracer kinetic studies have shown that T3 is available for transport from both the circulating albumin- and thyroid hormone-binding globulin-bound pools in plasma. Since the plasma proteins per se do not significantly exit the hepatic microcirculation on a single pass, the protein-bound hormone is operationally available for transport into liver via a proposed mechanism of enhanced dissociation caused by interactions between the plasma proteins and the hepatic microcirculation. These considerations raise the question as to whether the dissociation of T3 from serum proteins is sufficiently enhanced to allow for enrichment in the hepatic pools of exchangeable hormone that can generate 50% receptor occupancy. The present studies present a physiologically based steady state model of T3 transport and distribution in liver. All parameters of the model pertain to physiologically discrete pathways of hormone, plasma protein, or plasma flux through the liver. The rate constants were estimated from previously reported tracer kinetic transport data in rat liver in vivo using rat and human serum proteins. A computer program in BASIC for steady state analysis is presented. The results of the stimulation studies are as follows. The concentration of cellular exchangeable T3 in liver is predicted to be approximately 2 log orders greater than the concentration of free T3 measured in vitro, but approximately equal to the concentration of free T3 predicted to exist in the hepatic nucleus; thus, the high degree of hepatic nuclear T3 receptor occupancy is compatible with the model that T3 is available for transport into liver from the circulating serum protein-bound pools. The concentration of cellular exchangeable T3 is governed primarily by the concentration of plasma exchangeable T3 (and membrane transport and cellular metabolism of T3) and is predicted to be independent of changes in the concentration of cytosolic T3-binding proteins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

As found in vivo studies, the norepinephrine stimulation is blocked by coincubation with the alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist prazosin. The beta-adrenergic antagonist alprenolol either has no effect or increases stimulation by norepinephrine. These results suggest that beta-adrenergic agonists inhibit the activation or synthesis of the deiodinase in these cells.\r"

  ".W": "In conscious, chronically cannulated, unrestrained rats, systemic administration of catecholamines increases the plasma levels of beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity (beta Ei). In euthyroid rats, this effect is mediated by both alpha 1 and beta-adrenergic receptors; the rise in plasma beta Ei caused by isoproterenol is blocked by 1 mg/kg propranolol, and the similar effects of norepinephrine and phenylephrine are blocked by 0.1 mg/kg prazosin. Both types of responses are completely suppressed by a 4-h pretreatment of rats with 0.1 mg/kg dexamethasone, indicating the anterior pituitary origin of the beta Ei released. Prior sectioning of the pituitary stalk does not significantly reduce the response to either phenylephrine or isoproterenol, suggesting that both agents act directly on the pituitary. Hypothyroidism induced by surgical thyroidectomy does not influence the beta Ei response to isoproterenol, which remains sensitive to block by propranolol or suppression by dexamethasone. However, neither norepinephrine nor phenylephrine is able to increase plasma beta Ei in the hypothyroid animals. Both isoproterenol and phenylephrine remain fully effective in rats made hyperthyroid by daily injections of 40 micrograms/kg T3 for 4 days. We propose that in unstressed rats catecholamines increase plasma beta Ei by a direct action on the anterior pituitary via either alpha 1- or beta-adrenergic receptors, and that expression of the alpha 1-, but not the beta-adrenergic response is regulated by thyroid hormones.\r"

  ".W": "We have studied the effect of iopanoic acid (IOP), a radiographic contrast agent which inhibits T4 to T3 conversion, on thyroid hormone nuclear receptors, GH response to T4 and T3, and T4 5'-monodeiodination in GH1 cells, a rat pituitary cell line. IOP at concentrations higher than 10 microM inhibits iodothyronine binding to the nuclear receptor without changing the dissociation constant (Kd) (0.1 nM for T3 and 1 nM for T4), and reduces the GH response to 50 nM T4, 5 nM T3, or the combined effect of T4 and glucocorticoids. These results could be explained by an inhibition of protein synthesis which was reduced by more than 50% by 50 microM IOP. By contrast, nontoxic concentrations of IOP did not change the GH response to different doses of T4 ranging from 1 nM to 50 nM. We also examined T3 generation from T4 and found that the intracellular T3 levels of cells incubated with 50 nM T4 were almost as high as those of cells incubated with 5 nM T3 which induces a full GH response. Intracellular T3 levels were markedly reduced in the cells incubated with T4 and IOP, but GH production was not reduced despite these differences in T3 levels. Additionally, more than 40% of the nuclear receptor was occupied by T3 in cells incubated with T4, whereas more than 90% was occupied by T4 in cells receiving the same amount of T4 with 5 microM IOP. Our results suggest that the effect of T4 on GH production by GH1 cells could be attributed to an important extent to the T3 generated from it, whereas when T4 monodeiodination is strongly inhibited, most of the biological activity is a result of intrinsic T4 activity.\r"

  ".W": "Sertoli cells in vivo are believed to secrete androgen-binding protein (ABP) as well as other proteins in a polarized manner, primarily into the adluminal (apical) compartment of the seminiferous tubules. It is now possible to examine polarized secretion by Sertoli cells in vitro by growing them in dual environment (bicameral) culture chambers such that there is a separation of the apical and basal compartments of the cells. Sertoli cells obtained from 17-day-old rats were grown in these chambers on Millipore filters coated with a reconstituted basement membrane matrix. Within 3 days a confluent epithelial sheet of Sertoli cells (30-40 microns in height) is established, and these cells are joined along their baso-lateral plasma membranes by typical Sertoli-Sertoli tight junctions. We have previously shown that this epithelial sheet of Sertoli cells establishes an electrical resistance, as well as a permeability barrier to small molecules, between the basal and apical compartments of the culture chamber. In the absence of Sertoli cells, proteins equilibrate within 8 h across the matrix-coated filter support. Between 12 and 48 h of culture the Sertoli cell monolayers secrete approximately 4- and 2-fold more ABP and transferrin (Tf), respectively, into the apical compartment than into the basal compartment when grown in serum-free defined medium. ABP secretion is diminished 10-fold by the removal of testosterone from the serum-free defined medium. In addition, the apical/basal ratio of ABP secretion decreases from 4.1 to 1.7 in the absence of testosterone. In contrast, neither the amount nor the direction of Tf secretion is altered by the removal of testosterone. These results demonstrate the bidirectional secretion of ABP and Tf by Sertoli cells grown in bicameral chambers. In addition, the polarity of secretion of these two proteins by Sertoli cells appears to be under differential regulation by testosterone.\r"

  ".W": "Antiestrogens (AE), such as tamoxifen, selectively increase the production of a secreted protein of 37,000 mol wt (Mr) in estrogen receptor-containing human breast cancer cells (MCF-7, but not in estrogen receptor-negative MDA-MB-231 cells), and the production of this protein by AE is inhibited by concomitant estradiol (E) treatment. Likewise, E increases the production of a 32,000 Mr secreted protein whose synthesis is inhibited by AE. Proteins were detected by [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine labeling of cells and analysis of proteins by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and fluorography. Enhanced production of the 37,000 Mr protein is observed within 6 h of AE treatment, with maximal synthesis seen at 1-2 days when this protein represents about 6% of the total radiolabeled secreted proteins. This protein is stimulated maximally (approximately 4-fold) by 10(-8) M trans-hydroxytamoxifen or LY117018 or 10(-6) M tamoxifen, and its AE specificity is seen by the fact that trans-tamoxifen increases this protein, whereas cis-tamoxifen, an estrogen, does not. In addition to stimulating the synthesis of previously identified 160,000 and 52,000 Mr secreted proteins, E increases the production of a 32,000 Mr secreted protein. When cells are grown in estrogen-free conditions, i.e. in charcoal-dextran-treated serum in medium lacking the estrogen phenol red, the basal level of the 32,000 Mr protein is extremely low, and E stimulation results in a 10-fold increase in the production of this protein, with increases observable by 6 h and maximal stimulation at 2 days. Interestingly, the basal level of synthesis of the 37,000 Mr protein is high in the absence of E and is then stimulated only minimally by the addition of AE, suggesting that this protein is clearly produced as an estrogen-antagonistic protein. Amino acid incorporation conducted in the presence of tunicamycin and endoglycosidase H indicates that both of these proteins are glycoproteins. These proteins should serve as useful markers for AE and E action and may be involved in AE and E modulation of cell proliferation and/or cell function.\r"

  ".W": "The iodination of thyroglobulin and the formation of thyroid hormones are regulated by alpha 1-adrenergic agents as well as TSH in rat FRTL-5 cells. The regulatory effects of the alpha-1-adrenergic agents and TSH on both of these processes are associated with an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ and an increase in that component of iodide efflux that is representative of the movement of iodide from the thyroid cell into the follicular lumen. When FRTL-5 cells are preincubated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) for at least 3 min, the norepinephrine-stimulated changes in cytosolic Ca2+ levels and iodide efflux are inhibited. In contrast, PMA pretreatment has no effect on iodide efflux and actually enhances the changes in cytosolic Ca2+ induced by TSH. Phorbol myristate acetate pretreatment has no effect on TSH-stimulated cAMP-mediated iodide uptake in FRTL-5 cells, nor does it affect the binding parameters of the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist prazosin. These data suggest that protein kinase C is involved in a feedback mechanism regulating alpha 1-adrenergic but not TSH-induced changes associated with the iodination of thyroglobulin and the formation of thyroid hormones; and that this feedback effect occurs after the step of ligand binding but before the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ induced by the alpha 1-adrenergic agents.\r"

  ".W": "Using a clonal strain of cultured Leydig tumor cells (designated MA-10), we have compared the fate of the receptor-bound ovine LH (oLH) and human CG (hCG) in cells incubated in the presence or absence of extracellular Na+. We have previously shown that Na+ does not affect the number of LH/CG receptors or the binding affinity of hCG, but it decreases the binding affinity of oLH. Thus, it was possible to compare the fate of these two hormones under conditions where their binding affinities differ by a factor of 8 (i.e. in the presence of Na+) or by a factor of less than 2 (i.e. in the absence of Na+). Moreover, since only the affinity of oLH is affected by Na+, we were able to distinguish between those effects mediated by a change in binding affinity from those effects that are more general in nature by comparing the behavior of hCG in cells incubated in the presence or absence of Na+. The results presented herein show that the rates of internalization of oLH and hCG are very similar regardless of the presence or absence of Na+; and the absence of Na+ leads to a 2- to 3-fold decrease in the rate of degradation of the internalized oLH and hCG. We have found, however, that the binding affinities of oLH and hCG have significant effects on the pathway of receptor-mediated endocytosis under conditions where there is no free hormone present in the medium. The results presented show that in the absence of free hormone in the medium, the rate of hormone internalization can be approximated from the rate of disappearance of the surface-bound hormone only if the binding affinity of the hormone is high enough so that there is little or no dissociation of the hormone from the receptor during the course of the experiment (i.e. hCG in the presence or absence of Na+, but oLH only in the absence of Na+). If the binding affinity of the hormone is low (i.e. oLH in the presence of Na+), then the rate of disappearance of the surface-bound hormone represents the sum of the rates of internalization and dissociation of the hormone and thus cannot be used to approximate the rate of hormone internalization.\r"

RU38486 alone was without effect. Northern blot analysis revealed that dexamethasone-mediated enhancement of glutamine synthetase activity involves increased levels of glutamine synthetase mRNA. Increased enzyme activity was specific for glucocorticoids; other steroid hormones were essentially without effect. The induction of glutamine synthetase was selective, in that glutaminase activity was not induced by dexamethasone treatment of L6 cells. Thus, glucocorticoids regulate the expression of glutamine synthetase mRNA in cultured muscle cells via interaction with intracellular receptors. Such regulation may be relevant to control of glutamine production by muscle.\r"

Estradiol increased both myometrial oxytocin and alpha 2-adrenergic receptor concentrations in ovariectomized rabbits after 8 days of treatment. Simultaneous progesterone administration during the last 4 days of estradiol treatment reversed the induction of oxytocin, but not alpha 2-adrenergic, receptors. Similarly, administration of the antiprogestin RU 38486 to pregnant rabbits on day 27 of gestation resulted in premature delivery and evoked an increase in myometrial oxytocin receptor concentration mimicking that observed at term (day 31). However, RU 38486 did not significantly affect alpha 2-adrenergic receptor concentration. Our data provide further support for involvement of oxytocin receptors in parturition, but do not indicate a comparable function for myometrial alpha 2-adrenergic receptors.\r"

  ".W": "The melanotroph, a polyhedral secretory cell with an ovoid smooth nucleus, is the primary cell type of the intermediate lobe (IL) of the rat pituitary. The melanotrophs are not uniform, but differ in the tinctorial properties of their cytoplasm; some cells appear distinctly darker, others lighter, and cells staining in intermediate shades are also found. In addition, in situ hybridization using proopiomelanocortin (POMC) probes shows an uneven distribution of POMC mRNA among melanotrophs, indicating that different cells maintain different levels of biosynthetic activity. Dopaminergic drugs known to alter the secretion of POMC-related peptides from the IL produced parallel changes in histological staining properties and the amount of POMC mRNA per cell, as determined by in situ hybridization. Acute bromocriptine treatment (6 h) produced a dramatic reduction in grain counts over melanotroph cytoplasm (to 10% of the control levels). A similar reduction persisted after chronic treatment. Six hours after a single haloperidol injection, the grain counts were 180% of control levels. After chronic haloperidol treatment, they were further elevated to 300% of control levels. Chronic bromocriptine and haloperidol treatment also changed the thickness of the IL. Bromocriptine reduced and haloperidol treatment increased the number of cell layers in the IL by changing the rate of cell proliferation. Thus, haloperidol treatment significantly increased and bromocriptine treatment significantly decreased the number of melanotrophs labeled by [3H]thymidine. The mitotic index followed the same trend. These results suggest that dopamine regulation of the IL acts by two different mechanisms: POMC gene expression and cellular proliferation. The change in POMC gene expression is the cell's first rapid response. The influence on the cell cycle appears after subchronic and chronic treatment.\r"

LH caused a biphasic calcium efflux. There was a small but significant (P less than 0.05) calcium release within 1-2 min (rapid phase) with an ED50 of 35 ng/ml, followed by a larger one after 5 min (slow phase) with an ED50 of 10 ng/ml. The intracellular calcium antagonist TMB-8 inhibited the action of LH in both phases. Forskolin had no effect on calcium efflux during the rapid phase. However, it stimulated intracellular calcium efflux in a dose-dependent manner in the slow phase with an ED50 of 30 microM. Low doses of 8-Br-cAMP caused a small but significant increase in calcium uptake corresponding to the rapid phase, although high concentrations of 8-Br-cAMP caused efflux in the slow phase (ED50, 0.7 mM). Both LH and 8-Br-cAMP mobilized calcium from a nonmitochondrial pool, whereas forskolin induced calcium efflux from a nonendoplasmic reticular site. Apparently receptor-mediated (LH) and nonreceptor-mediated (forskolin and 8-Br-cAMP) intracellular calcium mobilization are qualitatively different, suggesting that rapid intracellular calcium mobilization may represent one of the initial steps in the mechanism of action of LH.\r"

  ".W": "To explore the relationships between thyroid hormone economy and defective thermogenesis in two genetically obese mouse strains, ob/ob and db/db, we measured iodothyronine deiodination in tissue homogenates and the T4 and T3 content of selected tissues. In lean mice acclimated at room temperature, type II 5'-deiodination in brown adipose tissue (BAT) homogenates rose 14.5-fold between 30 and 180 min of cold exposure at 4 C. In ob/ob mice kept at room temperature, type II 5'-deiodination rates in BAT homogenates were 2.29 times those in lean controls, but acute exposure to 4 C for 3 h caused a much smaller rise in 5'-deiodination in the ob/ob mice than in lean controls. Administration of 1 microgram/g norepinephrine caused similar elevations in BAT 5'-deiodination in ob/ob and lean mice. db/db mice had a defect in cold-stimulated BAT 5'-deiodination similar to that in the ob/ob mice in two of three experiments. In the obese animals of both strains, but not the lean mice, the magnitude of the rise in BAT type II deiodination after cold exposure was much greater in December than in warm months. Cerebrocortical homogenates from ob/ob mice had about 33% higher type II 5'-deiodination rates than those from lean controls, but showed normal type III T3 5'-deiodination. ob/ob liver homogenates had about 33% lower type I 5'-deiodination rates than controls. db/db, but not ob/ob, mice had lower serum T4 concentrations than controls. Both ob/ob and db/db mice had lower hepatic T4 concentrations than lean controls. The ob/ob animals had no alteration in brain T4 concentrations. Neither ob/ob or db/db mice had altered serum T3 concentrations, ob/ob mice had subnormal hepatic, but not brain, mean T3 concentrations. db/db mice also had reduced mean heptic T3 concentration. These results suggest that the subnormal cold-induced rise in ob/ob and db/db BAT type II 5'-deiodination is unrelated to thyroid status, perhaps being partly caused by defective sympathetic stimulation. This impaired deiodination response might result in subnormal intracellular T3 in BAT, thereby contributing to impaired thermogenesis. In contrast, the elevated cerebrocortical and unstimulated BAT type II deiodination and the decreased hepatic type I deiodination in the ob/ob mice are probably due to intracellular thyroid hormone deficiency.\r"

  ".W": "A 28,000 mol wt vitamin D-dependent calcium-binding protein (CaBP), first isolated from avian intestine, has recently been shown to exist in kidney and other tissues. To study the mechanism regulating the production of renal CaBP, we used primary cultures of chick kidney cells as an in vitro model. Renal cortical tubules isolated from vitamin D-deficient chicks were grown in serum-free, hormone-supplemented medium. Confluent cells were epithelioid and expressed CaBP, as demonstrated by immunocytochemistry and a specific RIA. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] increased cellular CaBP content in a dose-dependent manner (10(-10)-10(-7) M) from basal concentrations of 50-240 ng/mg protein to maximal concentrations of 600-1200 ng/mg protein 48 h after dosing. Cycloheximide (2 microM) inhibited 1,25-(OH)2D3 induction of CaBP, indicating that the mechanism requires new protein synthesis. Western blotting of cell extracts confirmed the identity of the inducible protein as the 28,000 mol wt CaBP. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 were effective but somewhat less potent inducers of CaBP, whereas vitamin D3 was without significant effect. The activities of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 are attributed to their rapid conversion by kidney cells to 1 alpha-hydroxylated metabolites. The dose-response profiles for two additional bioresponses in these cells, namely induction of 24-hydroxylase and inhibition of 1 alpha-hydroxylase activity, were comparable to those for CaBP induction. To our knowledge, this is the first description of a cell culture system that exhibits 1,25-(OH)2D3-inducible CaBP in vitro. This model should permit the study of certain aspects of the physiology of 1,25-(OH)2D3 and CaBP in kidney that are not possible in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Passive and active electrical properties of isolated rat adrenal glomerulosa and fasciculata cells were studied by intracellular voltage-recording and constant current stimulation. The average resting membrane potential was -78.9 +/- 4.2 mV for glomerulosa cells and -77.8 +/- 5.0 mV for fasciculata cells. The response of the membrane potential to changes in external K+ concentration was stable and reversible for changes up to 28 mM and was independent of external Cl-. The relationship between membrane potential and the log of external K+ concentration was linear between 4 and 28 mM, and the membrane potential could be predicted by a simplified form of the constant field equation with a [K]i of 138.5 mM and a PNa/PK of 0.015 for glomerulosa cells and a [K]i of 112.4 mM and a PNa/PK of 0.011 for fasciculata cells. Under current clamp conditions, both cells demonstrated a nonlinear relationship between membrane voltage and applied current for depolarizing current steps. Depolarizing current pulses elicited a regenerative response and were followed by a rectifying steady state potential. The maximum rate of rise and the peak amplitude of the regenerative response were increased by prior hyperpolarization below the resting membrane potential and decreased by depolarization. The regenerative response was unaffected by the removal of Na+. Elevated Ca2+ concentrations increased the rate of rise, peak amplitude, and rate of fall, but decreased the duration of the regenerative response. The regenerative response was maintained upon replacement of Ca2+ with Sr2+ or Ba2+, but was inhibited by Mn2+ or Co2+. Regenerative responses elicited in both glomerulosa and fasciculata cells exhibited similar characteristics. The results suggest the ionic mechanism underlying the regenerative response to be a voltage-dependent Ca2+ conductance. Both adrenal glomerulosa and fasciculata cells demonstrate electrical properties in common with other excitable cells. They are good K+ sensors with regard to their membrane potential, approaching the maximum sensitivity expected for a membrane exclusively permeable to K+. In addition, the Ca2+ regenerative response, which has been identified in both adrenal glomerulosa and fasciculata cells, may be involved in secretagogue stimulation of steroidogenesis.\r"

In this study, immature rats were treated with estradiol (E2) progestins, and actinomycin D. Medium proteins were analyzed after incubation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. E2 (1 microgram) increased the synthesis of proteins with mol wt of 115,000 and 65,000. Progesterone inhibited this increase when given in doses of 500 and 250 micrograms and when given within 8 h of estradiol. Lower doses of progesterone were not completely inhibitory. When actinomycin D was given within 6 h of E2, it also inhibited the E2 stimulated increase. This system may provide a useful marker for monitoring hormonal action in the luminal epithelium and may help in understanding hormonal regulation of gene expression.\r"

This period is associated with major changes in differentiated thyroid cell function. After 1, 2, and 3 days of culture, polyadenylated mRNA was prepared from 30-50 replicate dishes of cells. mRNA was also prepared from a portion of the intact tissue used to prepare the dispersed follicles. Expression of c-myc and c-ras mRNA was determined by Northern blot analysis using v-myc and v-ras probes labeled by nick translation. As a nononcogene control, actin mRNA was determined using a beta-actin probe. In intact thyroid tissue before follicle dispersion, c-myc (2.6 kilobases) and c-ras (1.1 kilobases) mRNA were detectable, though at relatively low levels. c-myc mRNA expression increased in cultured cells, to 430%, 670%, and 330% of tissue levels on the first, second, and third days of culture, respectively. In contrast to c-myc, c-ras oncogene mRNA expression was not significantly altered during the 3-day culture period. beta-Action mRNA expression, like c-myc, increased to 560%, 810%, and 460% of tissue levels on the first, second, and third days of culture, respectively. Southern blot analysis of thyroid tissue and cultured cell DNA indicated that gene amplification did not account for the increase in c-myc mRNA levels in cultured cells. In conclusion, c-myc, but not c-ras, oncogene expression is enhanced during the transition of thyroid follicular cells into monolayer culture. beta-Actin mRNA expression is also enhanced during the initiation of primary thyroid cell culture. These data are consistent with a role for c-myc expression in the regulation of normal thyroid cell differentiated function.\r"

This 900-fold purification was accomplished by gel filtration, ammonium acetate precipitation, cation exchange fast protein liquid chromatography, and C8 reverse phase fast protein liquid chromatography. The AGF had an apparent mol wt of 25,000-30,000, as determined by gel filtration chromatography at acid pH. It was tested on mouse fibroblasts (3T3 cells), rat fibroblasts (NRK cells), mouse adrenocortical cells (Y1 cells), and normal bovine adrenocortical cells (BAC cells) and found to be a relatively potent mitogen for BAC cells only, contrasting with fibroblast growth factor, which could stimulate all of these cell types. It is sensitive to reducing agent, alkaline pH, and boiling. Purification steps were carried out at acid pH, suggesting some degree of stability to acidic pH. The mitogenic activity in the conditioned medium could be blocked by ACTH, and the purified AGF contained no ACTH immunoactivity. The AGF appears distinct from epidermal growth factor, since it could not bind to epidermal growth factor receptors, and platelet-derived growth factor, which could not stimulate BAC cells. Purification to homogeneity was not accomplished, because very broad bands of mitogenic activity were observed with all of the chromatographic methods tried. The AGF appears to be distinct from any of the known growth factors.\r"

The bioassay was based on the production of corticosteroids by cultured adrenal cells from adult sheep. The standard used in both the RIA and the bioassay was synthetic ACTH-(1-24). Under every condition, curves for dilution of the incubation media were parallel to the standard curves in both the RIA and the bioassay. When expressed per 5 X 10(5) pituitary cells, B-ALA output increased with gestational age and remained high after birth. During fetal life, B-ALA released was always lower than I-ALA. However, the B/I ratios increased with gestational age from 0.29 +/- (SE) 0.04 at 63 days to 0.70 +/- 0.04 at 144 days. Conversely, for postpartum animals, the B/I ratios were not different from 1, except in the case of stimulation by AVP alone, when they were significantly higher than 1.A 4-day treatment of pituitary cells from 120- to 126-day-old fetuses by AVP or cortisol resulted in an 1.5-fold enhancement of the B/I ratio of the ALA secreted under AVP stimulation. These results indicate that during development of the sheep I-ACTH levels are probably not representative of the corticotropic activity released by the pituitary. Furthermore, they suggest that the prepartum increase in fetal cortisol does result, in part, from an enhanced tropic drive to the fetal adrenal.\r"

  ".W": "alpha MSH is present in high concentrations in the intermediate lobe of the fetal pituitary and has been implicated as a regulator of fetal adrenal steroidogenesis and fetal growth. However, there are few data regarding alpha MSH levels in fetal plasma or the control of fetal alpha MSH secretion. We measured alpha MSH immunoactivity in the plasma of chronically catheterized fetal lambs (gestational age, 116-138 days), newborn lambs, and adult sheep both in the baseline state and after dopamine receptor blockade with metoclopramide. The effect of metoclopramide on the release of another proopiomelanocortin-derived peptide, N-acetyl-beta-endorphin (N-acetyl-beta EP), which is synthesized together with alpha MSH in the intermediate lobe, was also studied. Baseline fetal plasma alpha MSH was significantly greater than maternal alpha MSH [35.6 +/- 2.2 (+/- SEM) vs. 10.0 +/- 1.0 pg/ml]. In eight studies in five fetal lambs, alpha MSH rose to a peak level of 121 +/- 23 pg/ml 15 min after metoclopramide administration to the fetus. Simultaneous maternal alpha MSH levels did not change, suggesting that the alpha MSH in fetal plasma was of fetal pituitary origin. Gel filtration of pooled fetal plasma extracts revealed that the alpha MSH immunoactivity eluted in the same position as the alpha MSH standard. Metoclopramide caused the secretion of nearly equimolar amounts of alpha MSH and N-acetyl-beta EP into fetal plasma. In four fetal lambs, basal N-acetyl-beta EP levels of 156 +/- 34 pg/ml rose to 305 +/- 65 pg/ml 15 min after metoclopramide treatment. Metoclopramide also stimulated plasma alpha MSH in newborn and adult sheep. In six newborn lambs, alpha MSH rose from 45.2 +/- 13 to 211 +/- 38 pg/ml 15 min after metoclopramide treatment, whereas in four adult sheep, a basal alpha MSH level of 11.1 +/- 2.2 pg/ml rose to 20.1 +/- 2.7 pg/ml 15 min after metoclopramide. In addition, metoclopramide stimulated fetal and neonatal PRL secretion, but had no effect on plasma vasopressin concentrations or acid-base and blood gas values. These studies indicate that immunoreactive alpha MSH and N-acetyl-beta EP are secreted into ovine fetal plasma and that the secretion of these peptides in the fetus appears to be under tonic dopamine inhibition, as is the case in the adult sheep and newborn lamb.\r"

The derivatives were obtained by VIP modification with azido phenyl glyoxal at arginyl residues 12 and 14 ([Az Bz Arg12-14]VIP) or only at position 14 ([Az Bz Arg14]VIP). The first derivative exhibited pronounced hydrophobic properties. The level of cAMP produced in HT 29 cells by this derivative represented 15% of that obtained by VIP at equimolar concentration (10(-10) M). The second derivative ([Az Bz Arg14]VIP) was synthesized by a new procedure, in which amino acids of VIP buried in the active site of the receptor were protected from azido phenyl glyoxal. This analog retained a high binding affinity for receptor (Kd, 0.5 nM for [125I-Tyr,Az Bz Arg14]VIP vs. 0.1 nM for [125I] VIP) and was found to be biologically active, as judged by stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity (production of cAMP was 120 pmol/10(6) cells vs. 140 pmol for VIP at 10(-10) M). Photolysis of this analog in the presence of HT 29 cell membranes resulted in a stimulation of adenylate cyclase which persisted in spite of repeated washings. Our findings indicate that [125I-Tyr,Az Bz Arg14] VIP binds covalently to active sites to form an active peptide-receptor complex. When low affinity binding sites were specifically photolabeled using a selective protection of high affinity sites by incubating membranes with 10(-10) M VIP for 5 min, the derivative did not stimulate adenylate cyclase activity. This suggests that VIP acts through a high affinity site to produce the biological activity and that the functional relevance of low affinity sites is unclear.\r"

  ".W": "The neurohypophysial hormones oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (VP) are involved in the regulation of the contractility of the male genital tract in several animal species. We investigated the presence of specific binding sites for [3H]OT and [3H]arginine VP (AVP) in membranes prepared from tunica albuginea, epididymis, and vas deferens from prepubertal pigs 2-16 weeks of age. Membranes were incubated with [3H]OT and [3H]AVP in the presence or absence of the corresponding unlabeled peptides. Binding equilibrium was reached in 60 min at 22 C. Millimolar concentrations of Mg2+ increased the specific binding of both ligands. Analysis of families of self- and cross-displacement curves using the computer program LIGAND clearly demonstrated that two classes of binding sites were present in all tissues investigated. The first class of sites, designated the OT site, shows high affinity for OT, AVP, lysine vasopressin, arginine vasotocin, the selective OT agonists [Thr4,Gly7]OT and [Asu1,6]OT, and the OT antagonists derived from ornithine vasotocin (OVT), namely d(CH2)5Tyr(Et)OVT and dEt2OVT. The second class of sites, designated the VP site, shows high affinity for AVP, lysine vasopressin, arginine vasotocin, and the selective V1 antagonist d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP. The V2 agonist [1-deamino,4-valine]8-D-AVP shows low affinity for both sites. Isotocin, desglycinamide [Arg-8]AVP and tocinoic acid were ineffective in displacing [3H]AVP or [3H]OT. The highest density of OT receptors was found in tunica albuginea and epididymis, whereas the highest density of AVP receptors was found in vas deferens. Adenylate cyclase was not activated in any of the tissues studied by concentrations of AVP or OT up to 100-fold greater than their Kd values. This is the first demonstration and pharmacological characterization of specific OT and V1 VP receptors in the tunica albuginea, epididymis, and vas deferens. The recent demonstration of high local concentration of neurohypophysial hormones in the gonads of several mammals support a physiological role of these OT and VP receptors in regulation of the motility of the male genital tract.\r"

  ".U": "87105384\r", 
  ".W": "The adrenal gland of the human fetus (HFA) is relatively large compared to that of the adult and exhibits an extremely high rate of steroidogenesis both in vivo and in vitro. The fetal zone cells make up 80-85% of the volume of the HFA and are the major site of steroid production during fetal development. We have recently demonstrated that calcium is involved in the regulation of steroidogenesis in fetal zone cells of the HFA. There is considerable evidence that many actions of calcium within cells are mediated by the calcium-binding protein calmodulin. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine if calmodulin also plays a role in HFA steroidogenesis. To investigate this possibility, the fetal zone was dissected from fetal adrenals of first and second trimester human abortuses. After collagenase digestion of the tissue, dispersed fetal zone cells were maintained in a Krebs-Ringers medium at 37 C for a 3-h incubation. Cells were incubated with and without ACTH (10(-8) M) in the presence of the calmodulin inhibitors trifluoperazine (TFP), chlorpromazine (CPZ), and calmidazolium (CAL) at concentrations of 5-100 microM. The media were assayed for contents of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DS), cortisol (F), pregnenolone, and cAMP by RIA. The addition of ACTH stimulated F secretion 5- to 10-fold compared to that in control fetal zone cells. DS secretion increased up to 5-fold and pregnenolone about 2-fold in the presence of ACTH compared to values in control cells. ACTH also stimulated cAMP secretion by 10-fold compared to that in control cells. The addition of TFP, CPZ, and CAL significantly inhibited ACTH-stimulated DS, F, and pregnenolone secretion in a dose-related fashion to near-control levels. We observed that TFP, CPZ, and CAL inhibited cAMP accumulation as well as Bu2cAMP-stimulated steroid secretion. The metabolism of 22R-hydroxycholesterol to pregnenolone was inhibited by TFP and CPZ, but not by CAL. These studies suggest that calmodulin plays a role in regulating steroidogenesis in fetal zone cells of the HFA.\r"

  ".W": "Alterations in endogenous free radical-scavenging defense mechanisms of rat tissues after body weight loss (induced by starvation for 72 h) associated with hypoinsulinemia were investigated. The activities of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), and glutathione (GSSG) reductase as well as levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) were examined in several tissues and in erythrocytes. A complex pattern of changes was observed. CAT activities were increased in the heart and pancreas and decreased in the liver. SOD levels were decreased in the heart and increased in the kidney and pancreas. GSH-PX activities were increased only in the kidney, and levels of GSH were decreased only in the liver of starved animals. Erythrocytes from starved animals showed no alterations in the levels of major free radical-scavenging enzymes. However, GSSG reductase levels were lower in erythrocytes from starved animals, and this was associated with an increased susceptibility to H2O2-induced GSH depletion. Paradoxically, H2O2-induced malondialdehyde (MDA) production in erythrocytes from starved animals was lower than that in control erythrocytes. Our results suggest that, in studies of experimental diabetes, attention must be given to the influence of body weight loss per se on the biochemical alterations associated with this disease.\r"

  ".W": "The decreasing relative mortality among type I (insulin-dependent) diabetic patients during the last 50 years might be related to the incidence of clinical diabetic nephropathy. We therefore followed 2890 type I diabetic patients (1607 males and 1283 females) diagnosed between 1933 and 1972 and before the age of 31, from admission to death, emigration, or January 1, 1984. All patients had been admitted to the Steno Memorial Hospital. Information on development of proteinuria was obtained in 2658 patients (92%). Five hundred twenty-five patients developed proteinuria due to diabetes and 49 developed nondiabetic proteinuria. When comparing patients diagnosed between 1933 and 1942 with those diagnosed between 1953 and 1962, the incidence of proteinuria decreased by 30% (P less than .03). This might explain the decrease of relative mortality in type I diabetic patients. The incidence decreased with increasing age at onset but was always highest in males. Insulin dose (U/kg) and diabetes duration at admission did not influence the incidence of proteinuria. The incidence peaked after 15-17 yr of diabetes duration independent of sex, age at diagnosis, or calendar year of diagnosis. However, the majority of patients did not develop proteinuria during 40 yr of diabetes. This suggests individual renal susceptibility to the deleterious effect of hyperglycemia.\r"

As previously reported, midaglizole reduces plasma glucose, mainly by stimulation of insulin secretion, and inhibits epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation in normal human subjects. In this study, the clinical safety and efficacy of short-term administration of midaglizole were evaluated in 47 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). After an observation period on diet or sulfonylurea treatment (1 patient was on insulin), patients received 150-250 mg 3 times a day of midaglizole for 2-4 wk, (some patients continued treatment for greater than 4 wk). In 20 of the patients first treated with diet and then switched to midaglizole treatment, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) decreased significantly from 187 +/- 10 mg/dl (mean +/- SE) to 147 +/- 13 mg/dl (P less than .05) and 120 +/- 6 mg/dl (P less than .01) 2 and 4 wk, respectively, after administration of midaglizole. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1) also decreased from 12.0 +/- 0.7 to 11.3 +/- 1.1 and 10.7 +/- 0.6% after 2 and 4 wk, respectively. In 23 of the patients whose treatment was changed from sulfonylureas to midaglizole, FPG, and HbA1 levels were maintained at the same values obtained before administration of midaglizole. In patients treated with midaglizole for greater than 12 wk, FPG and HbA1 were kept at the lowered levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The width of glomerular capillary basement membrane and the quantity of plasma protein immunohistochemically demonstrable in the basement membrane were supranormal in the galactosemics, as they were in the diabetics. In contrast, kidney weight, mesangial volume, and the prevalence of obliterated glomeruli, glomerular exudates, and mesangial nodules in the galactosemic animals were comparable to those of normal animals and clearly were less than observed in the insulin-deficient diabetic animals. These galactosemic dogs are known to have developed a retinopathy morphologically indistinguishable from that of diabetic patients and dogs. Thus, galactosemia sufficient to produce diabetic-like lesions in the glomerular basement membrane and retina was found to be nevertheless insufficient to elicit several renal abnormalities that are typical of diabetes. The polyol concentration in erythrocytes was greater than normal in the galactosemics and the diabetics and was greatest in the galactosemics. The absence of mesangial expansion, glomerular obliteration, and nephromegaly in galactose-fed dogs raises the possibility that these abnormalities in diabetes are not a result of excessive polyol pathway activity.\r"

In addition, the effects of pentobarbital sodium anesthesia on RRSD and R values in normal control rats were compared with those of nonanesthetized animals. BB rats demonstrated a decrease in R values after 8 wk of diabetes. This decrease became more marked with increased duration of diabetes. No differences in mean R-R intervals or RRSD were obtained between diabetic and nondiabetic rats until 24 wk of diabetes. Normal control rats showed a decrease in sinus arrythmia with age.

  ".W": "Seasonality in the diagnosis of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), i.e., increased incidence in winter, was the impetus for this study of seasonality in glycosylated hemoglobin levels in nondiabetics. Glycosylated hemoglobin levels of 35 nondiabetic children and adults were highest at the ends of autumn and winter and lowest at the ends of spring and summer (P less than 10(-4)). This result is consistent with reports of seasonal variation in blood glucose, with the highest levels occurring in winter, as well as reports that suggest an internal milieu of increased counterinsulin action in winter due to seasonality in counterinsulin hormones, dietary factors, body weight, amount of exercise, growth rates in children, and ambient temperature. IDDM is caused by the gradual destruction of the pancreatic insulin-producing cells via lymphocytic infiltration--a process that may occur over years. We conclude that a decreased carbohydrate tolerance associated with winter can explain the seasonal variation in the incidence of IDDM and that this seasonality is caused by the precipitation of overt carbohydrate intolerance in individuals with already seriously compromised insulin secretory capacity. This implies that seasonality is not very formative about the cause of the destruction of pancreatic insulin-producing cells.\r"

The strength of wounds from diabetic animals was found to be reduced compared with normal controls but could be improved by insulin treatment, especially when excellent metabolic control was achieved. There appeared to be both quantitative and qualitative defects in the formation of wound tissues in diabetic animals, because wound strength was not normalized when the thinner skin of diabetic animals was taken into consideration. This was different from the findings in rats with renal failure or malnutrition: in these two conditions, wound strength appeared reduced but was normalized when adjusted for skin thickness. Increased activity of aldose reductase did not appear to be an important factor in the impairment of wound healing in diabetes, because wound strength was not corrected by treatment with sorbinil, an aldose reductase inhibitor. The precise mechanism of abnormal wound strength in diabetes remains to be studied further, but careful control of diabetes, maintenance of nutrition, and treatment of systemic illness are important factors in the promotion of wound healing.\r"

PMA also inactivates glycogen synthase in hepatocytes. In contrast, none of these effects are observed in hearts and hepatocytes of obese animals, indicating an impaired protein kinase C activation in these tissues, which are insulin resistant. Direct measurements of protein kinase C activity in lean rat hearts revealed that PMA provokes a translocation of the enzyme from a soluble to a particulate fraction. In obese rat hearts, the basal distribution of protein kinase C is altered (more activity is found in the soluble and less in the particulate fraction), and the translocation induced by PMA is impaired. Pretreatment of lean rats with PMA in vivo, aimed at downregulating protein kinase C, induces the same defects (i.e., insulin resistance and unresponsiveness to PMA) as those observed in hearts of untreated obese animals. The results indicate that part of the insulin resistance might be the consequence of altered modulation of insulin action by protein kinase C.\r"

When the glycemia returned to basal values ATIII activity concomitantly showed values in the basal range. Heparin infusion was able to significantly preserve ATIII activity from glycemia-induced alterations. These data demonstrate that hyperglycemia by itself may alter ATIII biologic activity. Moreover, the effect of heparin administration suggests that both glucose and heparin compete in vivo for the same functional site. Our study, showing the possible role of hyperglycemia in altering the biologic function of some proteins, stresses the role of increased blood glucose in the development of some complications in diabetes.\r"

A longitudinal study of 27 children with IDDM did not show progressive deterioration in percentage predicted FVC with age. These findings suggest that a tendency toward reduced lung volumes exists in IDDM and may not be a direct result of the metabolic disturbances in the disease.\r"

These antibodies stimulated lipogenesis in fat cells in vitro and competed with insulin for binding to insulin receptors. After treatment with glucocorticoids, the anti-receptor antibodies and the hypoglycemia both disappeared, and antibodies to insulin appeared in the patient's serum. The anti-insulin antibodies were isolated by affinity chromatography and were found to inhibit the anti-insulin-receptor antibodies that were present earlier. The interaction between the patient's anti-insulin antibodies and his anti-receptor antibodies suggests that these two species of antibodies are related as idiotypes and anti-idiotypes. We also studied the interaction of the hypoglycemic patient's anti-receptor antibodies with anti-insulin antibodies of a diabetic patient and with anti-insulin antibodies of mice immunized to insulin. The hypoglycemic patient's anti-receptor antibodies were neutralized by the diabetic patient's anti-insulin antibodies, indicating that anti-insulin antibodies with a common idiotype may arise in both diabetes and hypoglycemia. Moreover, mouse anti-insulin antibodies that interacted with mouse anti-receptor antibodies neutralized the hypoglycemic patient's anti-receptor antibodies. In contrast, mouse anti-insulin antibodies that did not interact with the mouse anti-receptor antibodies did not neutralize the hypoglycemic patient's anti-receptor antibodies. Thus, the human anti-insulin antibodies share an idiotype with a specific class of mouse anti-insulin antibodies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The guanidine HCl-solubilized constituents were identified by immunochemical procedures after resolution by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, CL-6B filtration, and DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Two immunologically related heparan sulfate proteoglycans (Mr approximately 350,000 and 210,000) were observed by electrophoresis, with the higher-molecular-weight form being predominant. An examination of the two proteoglycans after heparitinase digestion or chemical deglycosylation indicated that heparan sulfate chains and other carbohydrate units are attached to core proteins with Mr approximately 140,000 and 110,000, respectively. Radioimmunoassays indicated that human diabetic GBM contained significantly lower (P less than .005) amounts of heparan sulfate proteoglycan and laminin with average values that were 30 and 60%, respectively, of nondiabetic controls; the fibronectin content of the diabetic GBM, however, was not significantly different from the normal. These findings, together with previous studies showing increases in GBM collagen, indicate that an alteration in the macromolecular architecture of this basement membrane occurs in diabetes that may be responsible for the filtration defect and the ultimate glomerular occlusion.\r"

In acute (3-day) diabetics, neuropeptide transport in the vagus was unaltered. After 1 mo, SP transport was significantly increased; content in unligated contralateral nerve was unaltered.

The disease model is not just a research model but also the basis of the political structures of modern medicine in academic medicine and society at large.

The present investigation examined the following two questions: what kinds of requests do adult patients coming to a family practice center have prior to seeing the doctor; and will factor analysis of a 25-item patient request questionnaire provide evidence of the basic or most common dimensions of patient requests in this population? Two newly-developed instruments were administered to a sample of 144 adult patients before their visit to the doctor. Factor analysis yielded five major request factors--'medical information', 'psychosocial assistance', 'therapeutic listening', 'general health advice', and 'biomedical treatment'--partially replicating the findings of an earlier pilot study. The clinical implications of eliciting patient requests in the light of current behavioural and social science research into the doctor-patient relationship are discussed. Future research directions are also outlined.\r"

Despite the prescription of drugs, however, only 64% (25 out of 39) of those patients interviewed were receiving regular follow-up and three of the patients receiving no surveillance had suffered recent fits. Many of the patients had experienced no fits for several years and it was considered that anticonvulsant therapy could have been stopped in some cases. It is recommended that a system be devised to ensure that all epileptic patients on anticonvulsants see their general practitioner at least yearly.\r"

  ".W": "Cancer of the colon is the second most common malignancy in North America and screening methods are needed for diagnosing the lesions at an early stage. Faecal occult blood screening is a method of secondary prevention which is particularly adaptable to the family practice setting. In order to test the feasibility of using this test in family practice, 16 family physicians participated in a trial screening programme using the Hemoccult II test. During the two-month trial 776 patients over 40 years of age were screened; 19 of the tests were positive but in two cases patients were thought to have failed to follow dietary and medical restrictions. Of the 17 patients with verified positive tests, further investigation showed five patients had neoplastic disease and three of these had malignant disease. The detection rate for cancer of the colon using the Hemoccult II test was therefore 3/776, equivalent to 3.9 per 1000 cases screened. By narrowing the age range for screening patients to between 45 and 75 years, the time involved to screen the population at risk could be decreased.\r"

Most polyps were juvenile and the majority were located in the sigmoid colon (55%) or rectum (37%). No complications related to medication, colonoscopy, or snare polypectomy were observed. The two presenting symptoms, rectal bleeding and anemia, disappeared soon after polypectomy in all but one patient with adenomatous polyposis coli, subsequently operated upon. Follow-up examinations, including total colonoscopy, performed 4 months to 7 years (mean, 25 months) later did not reveal abnormalities in any of the 37 children whose previously removed polyps were juvenile.

Twenty-four patients were then prospectively studied after PEG to determine the incidence and significance of this finding. Nine patients (38%) developed radiologic pneumoperitoneum. Five patients (21%) had gross evidence of pneumoperitoneum, three patients had more subtle findings of small amounts of free air, and one patient had free air found by CT scan. No patient developed signs or symptoms of peritoneal inflammation. The authors conclude that pneumoperitoneum following PEG occurs frequently and that, in the absence of signs or symptoms of peritoneal inflammation, it is a benign finding which requires no further diagnostic or therapeutic intervention.\r"

Therapy should be tailored to the individual patient, particularly when the elevated blood pressure and renal insufficiency are associated with other significant medical problems. Most of the drugs used in younger hypertensives may be used in the elderly patient with renal insufficiency, but in general, starting and maintenance doses should be lower because of the greater sensitivity due to age and/or the renal failure. The goal in the elderly hypertensive patient with renal failure is similar to that in other hypertensive patients: blood pressure should be brought to 140/90 mm Hg or lower. In the elderly patient with resistant hypertension or who manifests a decrease in kidney function as blood pressure is lowered, an effort must be made to look for associated renovascular disease.\r"

In experimental tumor models, similar observations have been recorded. The reason for this phenomenon could be that tumors (ie, malignant cells) are different in different-aged hosts. Alternatively, host features such as the fibrotic, angiogenic, or immune response may be altered by the aging process and may render the host \"soil\" less fertile for \"malignant\" tumor growth. Indeed, experimental evidence has supported the importance of each of these host features. The significance of the exploration and eventual understanding of the age-related change in tumor behavior extends beyond clinical geriatric medicine; it may, in fact, involve the very unraveling of some of the basic biology of both tumor control and the aging process itself.\r"

Forty one patients had total colitis and 30 substantial colitis. Mean duration of the disease was 19.7 years (range 9-46 years). An average of 2.6 colonoscopies per patient in the total colitis group were carried out, and at least two biopsies were taken at 10 locations in the colon. In the total colitis group, seven had either low (four), or high grade dysplasia (two), or Dukes' A cancer (one). In the group with substantial colitis two patients with low grade dysplasia were found. Dysplasia or cancer leading to operation was found above the rectum in four of five operated patients, all having had total colitis for 25 to 44 years. The dysplasia and cancer findings at the colonoscopy preceding surgery corresponded well with the surgical specimens. In three operated patients a sequence of dysplasia development was recorded. With the exception of long duration and dysplasia, nothing in the clinical course distinguished the operated cases. Using this surveillance programme prophylactic colectomy can be limited to patients in a high risk group developing dysplasia. The risk of missing a cancer before it becomes incurable seems to be low.\r"

In 12 patients colitis was complicated by the development of colorectal carcinoma: one had three synchronous carcinomas. Only four of 14 carcinomas were DNA aneuploid. Deoxyribonucleic acid aneuploidy occurred focally in the colorectal mucosa in the presence and absence of carcinoma: rates of aneuploidy (67% in cancer patients and 42% in non-cancer patients), were not significantly different (chi 2 = 1.0962, p = 0.295). A higher rate of DNA aneuploidy was found in dysplastic tissues (21%) compared with non-dysplastic tissues (15%), but again these differences did not reach statistical significance (chi 2 = 1.0747, p = 0.299). Deoxyribonucleic acid aneuploidy and dysplastic change occurred more often with increasing duration of ulcerative colitis (p less than 0.001, p less than 0.005 respectively). We conclude that flow cytometric analysis of cellular DNA content should not replace present morphological methods of assessment of premalignancy in ulcerative colitis, but may be a useful adjunct in the identification of abnormal mucosa.\r"

Of the four short chain fatty acids tested only butyrate at 1 mmol/l and 10 mmol/l and acetate at 10 mmol/l had significant effects on this cell line. The addition of butyrate to growth medium affected the growth rate and the production of alkaline phosphatase, dipeptidyl peptidase IV and carcinoembryonic antigen. Butyrate at a final concentration of 1 mmol/l increased the doubling time of the cells from 26 hours to 72 hours and decreased the cloning efficiency of the cells from 1.1% to 0.054%. Alkaline phosphatase concentrations increased rapidly in cells cultured in 1 mmol/l butyrate reaching peak levels after four days with alkaline phosphatase concentrations increasing more than six-fold. Levels of dipeptidyl peptidase IV and carcinoembryonic antigen were also increased after culture in butyrate containing medium. The number of alkaline phosphatase containing and dipeptidyl peptidase IV containing cells increased markedly in butyrate containing cultures. In contrast the number of mucus containing cells decreased in cultures grown in medium containing butyrate. This differentiating effect of butyrate on colon carcinoma cells may be relevant to the presence of butyrate in the colonic contents and the relationship between short chain fatty acids and fibre intake.\r"

In all of the 15 patients whose jejunal biopsy was studied after the eventual gluten challenge the jejunal lesion had returned in 2.4 to 28 months. The numbers of IgA- and IgM-containing cells were similarly raised in primary and postchallenge biopsies. In the 13 patients whose skin improved during a gluten free diet and who were challenged with gluten the rash worsened and the dapsone/sulphapyridine requirement increased. The jejunal deterioration was equally marked in the six patients whose gluten challenge was stopped because of an intractable rash as it was in those who completed the preplanned challenge. The specimens of the former, however, had significantly more IgA-containing cells than specimens of the latter. The number of intraepithelial lymphocytes clearly reflected the degree of intestinal damage. IgA-containing cells proved to be the most sensitive indicator of an immune reaction taking place in the gut of these patients. Even in the two children with initially normal or nearly normal jejunal mucosa, the IgA cell counts in the jejunal lamina propria were markedly raised.\r"

Their inhibitory substrate specificity has been investigated in man using test meals of the dietary carbohydrates, sucrose, maltose, and starch. Both inhibitors abolished the postprandial glycaemic rise after sucrose and m1099 50 mg did after maltose and starch, whereas o1248 20 mg had no effect after maltose and only a small effect after starch. Breath hydrogen evolution, as an indirect measure of malabsorption, showed that the reduced glycaemic responses, particularly after sucrose, were associated with considerable substrate malabsorption. Dose response studies showed that lower doses of both inhibitors could reduce postprandial glycaemia significantly without causing malabsorption. Both inhibitors were tolerated well. These two new enzyme inhibitors have different substrate specificity in man and can, in appropriate dose, regulate postprandial glycaemia by selective inhibition of brush border enzymes without causing malabsorption. In addition to their therapeutic importance, they provide a valuable experimental model of specific intestinal enzyme deficiency states.\r"

A recent study using this drug (0.5 mg/patch) suggested that enough scopolamine was absorbed through the skin to reduce basal gastric acid secretion in patients with duodenal ulcer. We have compared the effect of transdermal scopolamine and oral cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) in seven men with chronic duodenal ulcer, both alone and in combination, on acid secretion throughout an entire 24 hour period in a placebo-controlled, randomised, double blinded cross over study. The effect of these drugs on basal, interprandial, and nocturnal gastric juice volume and hydrogen ion concentration also was measured. Transdermal scopolamine had no significant effect on mean 24 hour acid secretion (placebo, 409.4 mmol/day; scopolamine, 364.0 mmol/day) nor did it have a significant effect on gastric juice volume or hydrogen ion concentration. The combination of transdermal scopolamine plus cimetidine was not more effective than cimetidine alone in reducing total 24 hour acid secretion (mean, 231.8 versus 235.3 mmol/day) nor in reducing gastric juice volume or hydrogen ion concentration.\r"

In HBeAg positive patients the density of HLA class I (HLA-I) protein was not significantly increased above that found in uninfected liver, but levels of 2-5A synthetase were twice normal. In anti-HBe positive patients, HLA-I density was markedly increased in the presence of normal 2-5A synthetase activity. These data are consistent with type I (alpha or beta) interferon activation of the hepatocytes in HBeAg positive patients and type II (gamma) interferon activity in anti-HBe positive subjects.\r"

In 52 patients injection was followed by decreased pressure in the sphincter of Oddi; 43 of these had normal prestimulatory values (group I), while the values were raised in the other nine patients (group II). A paradoxical response to intravenous injection was observed in 10 women (group III): increased baseline sphincteric pressure occurred in eight and increase in the amplitude of phasic contractions in four patients. The prestimulatory sphincteric pressure was raised in five and normal in the remaining patients. Eight patients were treated with papillotomy (seven) or balloon dilatation of the sphincter (one). They experienced relief of pain during a follow up period of 11-16 months. Intravenous injection of cholecystokinin or ceruletide may disclose a special type of biliary dyskinesia even in patients with normal prestimulatory manometric findings. Hormone injection increases the diagnostic yield of endoscopic manometry in patients suspected of biliary dyskinesia.\r"

Purification steps included heating at 95 degrees C for 15 min, 40% cold ethanol precipitation, passage over Procion Red HE3B, DEAE cellulose and Sephadex G75 columns and gel filtration and reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography techniques. As little as 27 ng per ml of the purest material produced a 2-fold stimulation in the standard HTC cell activity assay. Further studies indicate that hepatic stimulator substance is a highly negatively charged protein and that disulfide bonds or a complex tertiary structure are not essential to its activity. Hepatic stimulator substance is stable over a wide range of pH's and temperatures. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with silver stain revealed 1 major band at 12,400 daltons and 1 minor band at 17,500 daltons.\r"

In order to find a possible relationship between the course of disease and the phenotype frequency of HLA determinants, we studied 396 Dutch subjects of northern European local race. Six groups of individuals with various courses after hepatitis B virus infection were compared to healthy controls. The hepatitis B patients were grouped according to standard criteria: 47 had recovered from acute symptomatic hepatitis B virus infection; 60 had recovered from asymptomatic hepatitis B virus infection; 26 were asymptomatic hepatitis B surface antigen carriers; 16 had chronic persistent hepatitis B; 37 had chronic active hepatitis B, and 10 had chronic active hepatitis after elimination of hepatitis B antigens. Twenty-nine Class I and 13 Class II HLA antigens were assayed by standard microlymphocytotoxicity tests. The phenotype frequency of the Class II antigen DQw1 appeared to be significantly lower in patients with chronic active hepatitis B virus infection. Some other HLA specificities showed deviations from control values, but they were not statistically significant after correction for the number of antigens tested. In conclusion, we have found no evidence that the elimination of hepatitis B virus is related to HLA phenotype. DQw1, however, may affect the morphologic type of chronic hepatitis B infection, since its presence may protect against chronic active hepatitis.\r"

  ".W": "Bile acids, in a random sample of urine, discriminated normal controls from liver disease, with a probability similar to fasting plasma bile acids (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.001, depending on the analytical technique). A high degree of correlation between urinary and plasma bile acids (up to r = 0.93) was achieved only when the urine flow was corrected by using a urinary bile acids/creatinine ratio but not with urinary bile acids as simple volume concentration. These findings originated from 10 patients with severe liver disease and 10 with mild liver disease, all biopsy-confirmed, compared with controls. In 24 normal controls and 24 histologically confirmed compensated liver disease, the predictive value of urinary bile acids/creatinine equaled or exceeded fasting plasma bile acids and routine liver tests. In a patient recovering from subacute hepatic necrosis, the urinary bile acids/creatinine closely resembled changes in plasma bile acids and in the routine liver tests. When sulfated urinary bile acids were included, the discrimination between liver disease and controls did not improve. Gallbladder contraction induced by parenteral analogs of cholecystokinin did not change urinary bile acids/creatinine, despite a significant increase in the plasma bile acids. Collection of fasting urine is thus not necessary. Urinary bile acids/creatinine in 12 subjects with renal insufficiency and moderate impairment of creatinine clearance was not different from controls. The weight/height index did not affect this urinary test: there was no significant correlation between the two. Available radioimmunoassays for plasma bile acids can be easily adapted for urine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the natural history of compensated cirrhosis, 293 consecutive patients without previous major complications (ascites, jaundice, encephalopathy or gastrointestinal hemorrhage) were studied in terms of morbidity (probability of developing decompensated cirrhosis during follow-up) and survival. Patients were diagnosed by liver histology between 1968 and 1980. Median follow-up was 63 months. Decompensation of cirrhosis was considered when a patient first developed one of the major complications of the disease. Ten years after diagnosis, the probability of developing decompensated cirrhosis and the survival probability rate were 58 and 47%, respectively. A multivariate survival analysis (Cox's regression model) using clinical, biochemical and histological data obtained at diagnosis disclosed seven factors that predicted prognosis: serum bilirubin; serum gamma-globulin concentration; hepatic stigmata; prothrombin time; sex; age, and alkaline phosphatase. According to the contribution of each one of these factors to the final model, a prognostic index was constructed that allows calculation of the estimated survival probability. The predicting value of this index was validated by a split sample testing technique.\r"

The antigens to which the antimitochondrial antibodies in primary biliary cirrhosis sera react have been located in the mitochondrial inner membrane. We have reported on four mitochondrial inner membrane proteins, extracted from beef heart, which reacted with antimitochondrial antibodies of primary biliary cirrhosis. These four proteins had molecular weights of 70, 54, 51 and 45 kd. Forty-six of the 50 PBC sera tested were positive with rat kidney and stomach specimens by the indirect immunofluorescent method. All sera of 50 primary biliary cirrhosis patients were positive with at least one and as many as four of the mitochondrial proteins extracted from beef heart using immunoblotting. Forty-seven primary biliary cirrhosis sera (94%) had IgG antibodies (antimitochondrial antibodies) to the antigen proteins, 43 patients (86%) IgM antimitochondrial antibodies and 38 patients (76%) IgA antimitochondrial antibodies. Seventy per cent of patients had antimitochondrial antibodies in all three immunoglobulin classes. In a few primary biliary cirrhosis sera, antimitochondrial antibodies were represented by only one class of immunoglobulin. The major antigenic proteins of mitochondrial inner membrane to which the antimitochondrial antibodies react were the 70 and 51 kd proteins. All primary biliary cirrhosis sera containing antibodies to the 54 and/or 45 kd proteins reacted with 70 kd as well. Patients with an elevation of serum bilirubin over 2 mg per dl were often found to produce antimitochondrial antibodies reactive with the 54 kd in addition to the 70 kd protein. No significant association was found between histological classifications and reactive patterns of antimitochondrial antibodies.\r"

The mean trabecular bone volume was decreased as a result of trabecular plate thinning in both the premenopausal (p less than 0.02) and postmenopausal (p less than 0.05) patients, compared to age- and sex-matched controls. Indications that osteoblastic function was impaired included a significantly lower mean wall thickness (p less than 0.01) and mean osteoid seam width (p less than 0.05), and this in association with a decreased mineral appositional rate and prolonged mineralization lag time was suggestive of a defect in matrix synthesis. Further evidence of impaired osteoblastic activity was the significantly lower bone formation rate at both tissue (p less than 0.001) and basic multicellular unit levels (p less than 0.05) in the postmenopausal patients. Total resorption surfaces and fasting urinary calcium/creatinine ratios were significantly increased (p less than 0.005 and 0.05, respectively) in the premenopausal patients and mean interstitial bone thickness reduced in both pre- and postmenopausal patients, suggesting that increased resorption may also contribute to bone loss in primary biliary cirrhosis.\r"

Furthermore, these elevated catecholamine levels have been proposed to be involved in the pathogenesis of salt and water retention. Therefore, the effect of peritoneovenous shunting on the circulating levels and renal excretion of catecholamines were studied in six patients with massive refractive ascites preoperative within the first 8 hr postoperative and by 2 weeks postoperative under metabolic conditions. The recirculation of ascites into the intravascular compartment resulted perioperatively in significant rises in cardiac output (p = 0.001), para-amino-hippurate clearance (p = 0.08), creatinine clearance, diuresis (p = 0.05) and natriuresis (p = 0.06). Systemic blood pressure remained unchanged while systemic vascular resistance decreased (p less than 0.05). Preoperative circulating levels of free catecholamine were highly elevated, and renal vein concentrations were about 25% higher than renal arterial levels. Perioperatively, there was little change in circulating catecholamine levels or distribution of renal blood flow although renal artery and vein concentrations tended to equalize. In contrast by 2 weeks postoperatively, free catecholamine levels had fallen to within the normal ranges: mean norepinephrine from 1,477.6 +/- 194.6 to 395 +/- 62.9 pg per ml (p less than 0.05); epinephrine from 276 +/- 74.2 to 65.7 +/- 15.0 pg per ml (p less than 0.02), and dopamine from 325.6 +/- 175.2 to 47.9 +/- 5.3 pg per ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Adenine arabinoside is an antiviral agent which has been used in a number of clinical studies for the treatment of chronic infections with hepatitis B virus. In order to better understand its effects and mode of action, we treated ducks chronically infected with duck hepatitis B virus with a 2-week course and monitored the effects of the drug on viral replication by studying duck hepatitis B virus DNA in liver and serum using molecular biological techniques. We found the drug to be effective in ducks only at much higher doses than those used in humans. At high doses, adenine arabinoside had a dose-related inhibitory effect on viral replication during treatment, but there was a rapid return toward baseline values soon after the cessation of treatment. The supercoiled form of viral DNA was found to be most resistant to adenine arabinoside therapy, and the drug had a disproportionate inhibitory effect on viral plus (noncoding) strand synthesis. We conclude that adenine arabinoside likely exerts its effect in hepadna virus infections predominantly through inhibition of viral DNA polymerase. On the basis of our current study and previous trials in hepatitis B virus-infected patients, we predict that adenine arabinoside will not efficiently eliminate viral replication in chronic hepadna virus infection, when used as the sole therapeutic modality. Adenine arabinoside may have a role to play as an adjunct to immunomodulation or interferon therapy in chronic hepatitis B virus infection in man.\r"

Seventeen ducklings were injected intravenously with duck hepatitis B virus-positive serum within 24 hr after hatching and were subsequently sacrificed on the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 27th and 44th day after injection. Nine ducklings were not injected and were used as a negative control. Duck hepatitis B virus DNA by spot hybridization using a [3P]-labeled probe occurred in trace amounts on the 2nd day and in large amounts on the 4th day after inoculation. Immunoreactivity for DHBV was seen in the hepatocytes, sporadically on the 2nd day and diffusely on the 4th day, and also in the biliary epithelial cells on the 27th day. Both kinds of cells revealed staining in the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus. Virus particles were recognized by electron microscopy in the hepatocytes beginning on the 4th day. The hepatocytes had many incomplete virus particles, 40 to 61 nm in diameter, and a few complete virus particles, 40 nm in diameter, in the cisternae of the rough and smooth endoplasmic reticula. Such particles and the endoplasmic reticulum showed reaction products for duck hepatitis B virus by immunoelectron microscopy. There were clusters of core particles, 27 nm in diameter, in the hyaloplasm around peroxisomes where an assembly of cores appeared to occur. No conspicuous virus particles were recognized in the biliary epithelial cells. The similarities and differences in virus localization between duck hepatitis B virus and hepatitis B virus are discussed.\r"

Eleven of 14 patients, who cleared hepatitis B virus DNA, did so following or at the same time as onset of delta-infection. Duration of hepatitis B virus DNA positivity in these 11 patients was shorter than in 11 anti-delta-negative controls matched according to duration of preceding hepatitis B virus DNA positivity, but the difference was not statistically significant. Considering only patients positive for IgM anti-delta in the last serum sample (eight patients), a statistically significant shorter duration of hepatitis B virus DNA positivity was found in delta-infected patients than in the controls (p less than 0.02). The study indicates that the delta-agent may have the capacity to inhibit hepatitis B virus replication and that a chronic delta-infection may lead to a termination of the period of active viral replication.\r"

Membrane fluidity was analyzed by measurement of fluorescence polarization using the fluorophore 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene. The lipid apparent microviscosity (eta) of human fetal liver microsomes was 2.17 +/- 0.13 poise, as compared with 1.08 +/- 0.08 poise in adult liver (p less than 0.001). Similar differences in fluidity were found between fetal and adult rat liver microsomes. The more \"fluid\" adult microsomes had higher phospholipid/cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine/sphingomyelin molar ratios than those of the more \"rigid\" fetal microsomes. The degree of unsaturation of the adult microsomal lipids was much higher than that of the fetal lipids. The ratios of unsaturated/saturated fatty acids in microsomal lipids highly correlated with the eta values obtained for the combined group of fetal and adult human livers, suggesting that the developmental increase in degree of unsaturation of the microsomal lipids is a major determinant of the increased fluidity of adult as compared with fetal liver microsomes. These differences in fluidity and lipid composition between fetal and adult human liver microsomes may be a critical factor in the regulation of hepatic microsomal drug and carcinogen metabolizing enzyme activity, and could so determine the extent of toxicity and teratogenicity of drugs and/or their metabolites in the developing human fetus.\r"

The relation between membrane fluidity and taurocholate transport, a liver plasma membrane function mediated by carrier proteins, was also examined. Membrane fluidity was measured by fluorescence polarization using 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene as a probe. Uptake of [3H]taurocholate into basolateral rat liver plasma membrane and canalicular rat liver plasma membrane vesicles was measured by a rapid Millipore filtration technique. Anisotropy values were found to be significantly lower for the basolateral rat liver plasma membrane (0.2287 +/- 0.0014) than for the canalicular rat liver plasma membrane (0.2612 +/- 0.0012), indicating that basolateral rat liver plasma membranes are more fluid than canalicular rat liver plasma membranes. Ethanol produced a concentration-dependent effect on lipid fluidity and inhibition of taurocholate uptake, in both membrane preparations. Pretreatment of the membrane with calcium increased the rigidity of both membrane preparations. However, the change in the anisotropy with calcium was only slight in the more rigid canalicular rat liver plasma membrane, while the change in anisotropy was greater and associated with a decrease in taurocholate uptake in the basolateral rat liver plasma membrane. Both the effects of ethanol and calcium were more pronounced in basolateral rat liver plasma membrane than in canalicular rat liver plasma membrane. These results indicate that the fluid state of the hydrophobic bilayer of liver plasma membrane lipids play an important role in regulating bile acid transport in both sinusoidal and canalicular domains.\r"

In whole animals, dibromosulfophthalein and ouabain clearance is reduced to 7 and 37% of normal, respectively, due to severely impaired excretion from liver to bile. Initial uptake rates of these agents are relatively little affected. In the isolated perfused liver preparation, dibromosulfophthalein is retained within liver and perfusion medium, and the 60-min recovery on bile is reduced to 1.5 vs 75% in normal controls. Biliary excretion of cholate, taurocholate and the quaternary ammonium cation, [14C]tributylmethyl ammonium, is not impaired. These results provide evidence for a selective defect of organic anion and neutral steroid transport in TM rats and confirm that multiple pathways exist for the hepatobiliary excretion of organic anions, neutral steroids, bile acids and cations. Bile flow in whole animals and in the isolated perfused liver is reduced to 50 and 30% of normal, respectively. This suggests that a normal function of the excretory systems for organic anions and neutral steroids is important for the maintenance of normal bile flow.\r"

  ".U": "87107370\r", 
  ".W": "In vivo 31phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to measure the hepatic metabolic state in various groups of rats given ethanol, a control liquid diet or a solid chow diet. The use of selective presaturation pulses applied to the broad phosphorus resonances of immobile phospholipids permitted reliable determination of ATP/ADP ratios by quantitation of the ATP-beta and ATP-gamma peak areas. ATP/ADP ratios were depressed by both techniques in rats chronically ingesting ethanol compared to pair-fed animals consuming the control liquid diet. These differences were observed regardless of whether ethanol feeding was continued up to the time of investigation or whether it was discontinued for 24 hr prior to study. Acute alcohol administration in chow-fed rats, not previously ingesting ethanol, did not lower hepatic ATP/ADP ratios by either methodology. In all cases, liver ATP/ADP ratios assessed by 31phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy were higher than those measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. However, parallel decreases in hepatic ATP/ADP ratios were observed with chronic ethanol consumption by both 31phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and the biochemical method, confirming the utility of in vivo 31phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy for assessment of the hepatic bioenergetic status. The difference in absolute ATP/ADP ratios by the two methods may to some degree be explained by binding effects of ADP with proteins or mitochondrial membranes, rendering it partially invisible to nuclear magnetic resonance or alternatively, by breakdown of high energy phosphate bonds with freeze clamp extraction.\r"

  ".W": "While a number of studies show that acute oral administration of ethanol results in increases in liver blood flow, a large body of evidence has also been presented in which such an effect is not observed. To shed light on this discrepancy, we have studied in rats, a number of variables that might modulate or inhibit the effect of ethanol. These included the use of three anesthetic agents studied at two different times after anesthetic administration and the effect of animal age, gender, batches and seasonal variation. Portal blood flows were determined by the radiolabeled microsphere method in 12 separate experiments in awake rats. Ethanol given at doses ranging from 0.5 to 4.0 gm per kg consistently increased portal vein blood flow by approximately 50% (42.2 +/- 3.5 to 63.4 +/- 6.5 ml per min per kg). The interexperiment variation was 2.4 to 3.0%, showing remarkable consistency, typical of an all-or-none effect at the doses employed. On the other hand, the ethanol-induced increase in portal blood flow was completely suppressed by ketamine (75 mg per kg), thiopental (50 mg per kg) and fentanyl (15 micrograms per kg) when given 15 min prior to blood flow determinations. This suppression was dependent on the dose and duration of anesthesia. These anesthetic agents had no effect on basal hepatic arterial or portal blood flows. Ethanol or the anesthetics were without effects on hepatic artery blood flow. Neither gender, weight (150 to 350 gm) nor animal batch had effect on the response to ethanol. Similarly, there was no effect of seasonal variation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Normal rat hepatocytes maintained on tissue culture plastic and in serum-supplemented medium lose their gap junctions within 12 hr and expression of their tissue-specific functions within 24 to 72 hr. The gap junctions are lost via internalization and degradation, and the differentiated functions due to loss of synthesis and to rapid degradation of tissue-specific mRNAs. Near normal levels of tissue-specific mRNAs can be achieved by stabilization of the mRNAs but not by transcription (for most genes), if the cells are cultured in a serum-free, hormonally defined medium and on substrata of tissue culture plastic, fibronectin or laminin, or on various purified collagens. The hormonally defined medium also extends the life-span of the gap junctions to about 24 hr. Certain glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans and anionic polysaccharides have proven to be potent inducers of gap junction expression and function, to increase abundance of tissue-specific mRNAs, and to lower abundance of common gene mRNAs, a level of gap junctions and a pattern of gene expression similar to that in vivo. Addition to the hormonally defined medium of 10 micrograms per ml of hyaluronates, dermatan sulfates, bovine lung heparan sulfate, chondroitin 4-sulfate or chondroitin 6-sulfate resulted in a weak response in induction of gap junctions (5 to 15% of the cells became dye and electrically coupled) and in gene expression. An intermediate response in gap junction expression (30 to 50% coupled cells) and in gene expression was observed with 50 to 100 micrograms per ml of heparins or hyaluronates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We have developed the methodology for evaluating the effects of pathophysiological conditions on the molecular mechanisms of hepatic protein synthesis and fibrogenesis in baboons and man. Total RNA was extracted from percutaneous liver biopsies of five baboons who were chronically fed an ethanol-rich liquid diet, their pair-fed controls and from humans with a variety of liver abnormalities. Chronic alcohol administration in baboons with liver fibrosis and normal serum albumin levels increased in vitro protein synthesis as measured by [35S]methionine incorporation, albumin mRNA content and Type I procollagen mRNA content. There was no difference in the beta-actin (a constitutive protein) mRNA content. In humans, serum albumin levels correlated with albumin mRNA content as indicated by the intensity of dot blot hybridization and Type I procollagen mRNA levels correlated with the activity of liver fibrosis. The use of RNA-DNA hybridization to investigate procollagen mRNA from human biopsies appears to be a valuable tool for evaluating the potential for collagen synthesis and the future course of liver disease. Besides the use of RNA-DNA hybridization, we describe other methodologies which are useful in delineating the levels of gene expression responsible for hepatic mRNA regulation in normal liver and disease states in man. The use of molecular techniques to evaluate human liver disease provides an opportunity to develop clinically relevant information while at the same time offering the additional advantage of providing fundamental knowledge about fibrogenesis.\r"

Molecular biology has added the techniques of cell-free translation and cDNA cloning to provide additional information. In addition, the regulation of protein synthesis was largely deduced by the use of inhibitors of protein or nucleic acid synthesis. The ability to assess mRNA content by cell-free translation or by hybridization with isolated cDNA has expanded these studies. Moreover, polysomal isolation and organ explants can now be used to determine synthetic and secretion rates directly. Future research in these areas will depend upon the isolation of cDNA clones encoding specific enterocyte proteins to simplify structural analysis, as well as the use of intestinal cell lines to simplify measurement of synthetic rates and protein processing.\r"

These viruses share unique ultrastructural, molecular and biological features. HBV has great medical importance in many parts of the world. More important numerically than acute hepatitis B in high prevalence geographic regions is the liver disease associated with chronic infection. There appear to be more than 200 million chronically infected humans in the world, and these HBV infections appear to be the single most common cause of chronic liver disease and liver cancer in man. All hepadnaviruses share the propensity for silent infection in early life leading to persistence of the virus, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is clearly associated with long-standing persistent infection in man, woodchucks and ground squirrels. Although the viral DNA has been found to be integrated in cellular DNA of many HCC in man, woodchucks and ground squirrels, the precise role of the virus in tumor formation has not been defined. Hepadna viruses have an interesting molecular structure and mechanisms of replication, and they appear to share certain important features with retroviruses as reviewed here. It is of interest to define similarities and differences between hepadnaviruses and retroviruses in order to understand their evolutionary relationship and to determine whether they share a common oncogenic mechanism, since infection with members of both virus families is associated with neoplastic disease.\r"

  ".W": "It seems evident that the development of fully malignant HCC is a multistage process with many variables. One possible mechanism by which many of these variables may interact is as follows. During chronic active hepatitis, viral DNA integration occurs randomly and at a low frequency in hepatocytes. Integration may be stimulated by the increased rate of hepatocyte cell division resulting from liver necrosis and regeneration during chronic disease. The presence of viral integrations in the cellular genome provides focal points for the generation of chromosomal aberrations. One pathway by which these aberrations may be generated involves rearrangement of integrated viral and cellular sequences following viral DNA integration. The rearrangements which occur may include deletion, translocation, transposition or amplification of specific viral and cellular DNA sequences. We and others have directly demonstrated that all of these events are associated with different HBV integrations. The presence of viral integrations in chromosomes may also, by some unknown mechanism, destabilize those chromosomes such that whole chromosomes fail to segregate and are lost from particular cells. Preliminary studies we have conducted using restriction fragment length polymorphisms have revealed the loss of Chromosome 11 alleles in several HCC, indicating that chromosome loss may be a common occurrence in HCC. Our studies with restriction fragment length polymorphisms support such a mechanism involving Chromosome 11 in HCC. Specific chromosomal aberrations associated with all HCCs have not yet been identified.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Several well-validated algorithms are available, of which the short-axis area-length technique is the simplest. In hypertensive heart disease, in which left ventricular shape is usually close to normal, two-dimensional echocardiography may offer a smaller standard error than M-mode, but this issue requires further evaluation. Further, it is uncertain whether the incremental accuracy of two-dimensional echocardiography in hypertensive heart disease would offset its increased cost and complexity relative to M-mode echocardiography.\r"

Echocardiographic left ventricular mass (in grams) was estimated from the following formula: left ventricular mass = 1.05 ([ left ventricular internal diastolic dimension + ventricular septal thickness (diastole) + posterior wall thickness (diastole)] - [left ventricular internal diastolic dimension]). In both groups, female subjects had a slightly smaller left ventricular mass than male subjects (mean difference 7.2% in Group I, p less than 0.05, and 3.6% in Group II, p = 0.05) for any given age and body surface area. Left ventricular mass varied linearly with body surface area and increased as a function of age. In group I subjects, echocardiographic left ventricular mass (in grams) could be estimated by the general formula: left ventricular mass = 124 (body surface area) + A +/- C, where A is the age-dependent intercept; +/- C encompasses a 95% prediction interval for normal values, which is assumed to be nearly constant (+/- 58 g); and body surface area is expressed in square meters. In the Group II (younger) subjects, with age not considered, left ventricular mass (in grams) could be estimated from the following formula: left ventricular mass = 115 (body surface area) -11 +/- C, where +/- C = +/- 32% and this 95% prediction interval varies as a percentage of the mean.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Echocardiograms adequate to assess left ventricular chamber dimensions and wall thickness, aortic root, and left atrial dimensions as well as mitral and aortic valves were obtained in 4947 (80%) of the 6148 subjects. The prevalence of acceptable echocardiograms ranged from less than 50% for those more than 80 years of age to more than 96% for subjects under 30 years of age. A significant learning curve was apparent, particularly in the older subjects (more than 60 years of age) for whom prevalence of acceptable echocardiograms rose from a minimum of 28% during the first 5 months of studies to a maximum of 74 to 81% during studies 2 years later. The likelihood of unacceptable echocardiograms was slightly greater in men. Obesity (in subjects younger than 60 years of age), lower vital capacity, and overt cardiovascular disease were associated with unacceptable echocardiograms, independent of age. Consideration of these biases should aid in the interpretation and planning of epidemiologic and other studies using echocardiography.\r"

We documented the precision of M-mode left ventricular chambers and dimensions, interobserver and intraobserver variability, and the day-to-day variability of these measures. Left ventricular wall mass was significantly larger than expected for age and body size in children with persistently elevated blood pressure.

In this study we analyzed this relationship using noninvasive devices to monitor blood pressure for 24 hours in ambulatory patients and M-mode echocardiography to determine LV mass. Among the 33 patients with hypertension, 21 had echocardiographic LV hypertrophy (LV mass greater than 250 g). Patients with LV hypertrophy did not differ significantly from patients without hypertrophy with respect to age or casual systolic or diastolic blood pressure. The averages of whole-day systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 146 +/- 17 (SD) over 90 +/- 12 and 136 +/- 16 over 89 +/- 12 mm Hg, respectively. The relationship between whole-day average systolic blood pressure and LV mass was significantly positive (r = 0.66, p less than 0.05) in patients without hypertrophy but was not significant in patients with LV hypertrophy (r = -0.24). Similarly, the relationship between whole-day average diastolic blood pressure and LV mass was significantly positive in the former group (r = 0.64, p less than 0.05) but significantly negative in hypertensive patients with LV hypertrophy (r = -0.67, p less than 0.01). Thus, blood pressure correlates positively with LV mass only in patients without cardiac hypertrophy. In hypertensive patients with LV hypertrophy, factors additional to the high blood pressure itself must participate in the regulation of LV mass.\r"

As a result, the past decade has witnessed a remarkable evolution in our understanding of structural changes in the heart. Moreover, cardiac hypertrophy was found to be reversible by some forms of therapy. In general, reduction of left ventricular mass became evident after 8 to 12 weeks of antihypertensive therapy. Sympatholytics (including methyldopa and reserpine), converting enzyme inhibitors (captopril and enalapril), and calcium entry blockers led to significant regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. On the other hand, arteriolar vasodilators (hydralazine, trimazosin, and minoxidil) were not associated with regression of hypertrophy despite adequate blood pressure control. Finally, data regarding diuretics and beta-blockers are controversial. These differences in results among various antihypertensive drugs reflect the multiplicity of factors modulating left ventricular hypertrophy.\r"

Echocardiography probably contributes little to understanding of active mechanisms, although it may provide important information relative to structural and functional adaptive changes associated with development of left ventricular hypertrophy. Moreover, because other clinical conditions frequently coexist with hypertensive heart disease, echocardiography may provide another dimension in the assessment of obesity, coronary heart disease, mitral valve prolapse, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis, and asymmetric septal hypertrophy in the overall problem. Critical in this understanding are the subtle changes that occur in the individual patient, reflecting the natural history of the disease or response to its treatment. Since technical problems preclude echocardiographic evaluation in all patients with hypertension, particular care must be exercised in making epidemiologic generalizations.\r"

Hence, early detection of cardiac changes in hypertensive patients remains an important diagnostic goal. When the hypertrophy is mild or moderate, parameters of left ventricular diastolic function and measurements of left atrial size may facilitate the distinction between normal variation and pathologic increases in left ventricular mass. We measured left ventricular isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT, the time from aortic valve closure to mitral valve opening) and left atrial dimensions and correlated them to left ventricular mass index measured by M-mode echocardiography and rapid left ventricular filling by radionuclide ventriculography. In 20 subjects with untreated mild essential hypertension, IVRT was prolonged compared to a normotensive age-matched control group (91 +/- 23 vs 65 +/- 13 msec, p less than 0.0001). Left atrial dimension index was increased in patients compared to controls (1.9 +/- 0.4 vs 1.4 +/- 0.5 cm/m2, p less than 0.001), and this increase was related to prolonged IVRT (r = 0.46, p less than 0.001). Abnormal IVRT correlated with both increased left ventricular mass and decreased rapid ventricular filling in the hypertensive subjects. Thus, prolonged IVRT and borderline left atrial dimension may help identify subtle pathologic left ventricular mass increases in hypertensive subjects.\r"

Two-dimensional echocardiographic model systems, which require geometric assumptions, may have limited accuracy in mass determination if ventricular shape is deformed or the architecture is irregular, as it may be in various disease states. Recently developed techniques allow free angulation of the echocardiographic transducer with continuous recordings of the three-dimensional coordinates of each image without imposing restraints on transducer orientation. These developments have led to methods for accurate three-dimensional reconstruction of left ventricular mass, even in the presence of severe dilatation or deformity. With the interaction of two-dimensional echocardiography, a coordinate system for locating the transducer in three-dimensional space, and computer-aided echocardiographic contouring, it is possible to obtain left ventricular mass estimates with a high degree of accuracy from randomly oriented views without practical restriction on transducer motion or major geometric assumptions.\r"

Measurement of left ventricular muscle mass should use M-mode, two-dimensional, or three-dimensional echocardiographic methods that have been anatomically validated to maximize accuracy and comparability of results among studies. Body size and sex influence ventricular muscle mass sufficiently to be taken into account for clinical and research purposes, while age and physical activity are of less certain importance. Echocardiographic studies have clarified the prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive patients and the effect of blood pressure during normal activity on left ventricular muscle mass, and they have provided data suggesting that left ventricular hypertrophy is a major cardiac risk factor in hypertensive and general populations. Further research is needed to obtain definitive results in these areas, to track the hitherto elusive transition from functionally compensated cardiac hypertrophy to congestive heart failure, and to determine the degree and selectivity of beneficial cardiac effects of antihypertensive treatment. Three-dimensional echocardiographic reconstruction and Doppler measurement of intracardiac blood flow and systemic hemodynamics are likely to extend the usefulness of echocardiography for hypertension and general population research.\r"

The effect develops with a half time (t1/2) of 12 h and is reversible (t1/2 = 7 h). The maximum enhancement of Pc is attained at a conditioning pressure of 80 ATA. Pressure conditioning also results in suppression of the compression rate effect on Pc. Furthermore, reserpine blocks the increase in Pc during prolonged pressure exposure. The entire effect thus appears to be an extension in time of the monoaminergic compression rate effect on Pc. Pressure conditioning does not modify anesthesia tolerance, unlike N2 habituation which affects anesthesia threshold pressure as well as Pc. The results are compared with the effects of habituation to inert-gas narcotics and the implications of the data for an understanding of inert-gas high-pressure antagonism in intact animals are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether the increase in cardiac output during mild to moderate exercise is related to an increase in the tissue redox potential, we compared the responses of cardiac output, total body oxygen consumption, and arterial blood lactate-to-pyruvate ratio (a measure of NADH/NAD) to treadmill exercise between dogs treated with normal saline and those treated with a hydrogen acceptor, new methylene blue. Normal saline was infused into the left atrium in the first group of dogs at a rate of 0.38 ml/min throughout the treadmill exercise (2.5 mph and 5.0 mph on a 6% incline, each for 20 min). In the second group, methylene blue was administered as a loading dose (4 mg/kg) before exercise, followed by a continuous infusion (0.15 mg X kg-1 X min-1) throughout exercise. A similar infusion of methylene blue was given to a third group of dogs without exercise; it reduced the arterial lactate-to-pyruvate ratio from 6.70 +/- 0.35 to 4.12 +/- 0.27 but had no or little effects on cardiac output, heart rate, arterial pressure, and left ventricular dP/dt and (dP/dt)/P. Treadmill exercise doubled cardiac output and increased total body O2 consumption three- to fourfold in the first two groups but increased arterial blood lactate-to-pyruvate ratio only in group 1 (6.0 +/- 0.54 to 9.97 +/- 0.91). The relationship between cardiac output and total body O2 consumption was unaffected by the simultaneous administration of methylene blue during exercise. Groups 1 and 2 also did not differ in their heart rate, left ventricular dP/dt and (dP/dt)/P, and plasma catecholamine responses to exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To separate heat production of the fetus from that of the placenta, endometrium, and uterine muscle, we measured total uterine heat production first with the fetus intact and then after the umbilical cord was snared and the fetus killed. Heat production was measured with the Fick principle using thermistors chronically implanted in a maternal artery and major uterine vein and a flowmeter placed on the common internal iliac artery. In nine ewes, carrying lambs weighing 4.46 +/- 0.42 (SE) kg, total uterine heat production fell from 10.6 to 2.9 W after fetal death. Uterine blood flow fell progressively to 90% of control levels during the first hour after death. The caloric equivalent for O2 averaged 4.1 cal/ml O2 for the uterus, 2.2 for the uteroplacenta, and 4.6 for the fetus per se. It was not possible to explain these results using a simple model of maternal-fetal heat transfer. Rather, it was necessary to assume an additional pathway for heat transfer between small uterine veins on the surface of the uterus and cooler structures in the maternal abdomen, presumably the ventral abdominal wall.\r"

Zhuang et al. (J. Appl. Physiol. 55: 1341-1348, 1983) have presented a detailed model of steady-state cat lung hemodynamics based on direct measurements of anatomical and elasticity data. This model provides an opportunity to better understand the information content of the hemodynamic data. Therefore, in the present study we carried out a series of steady-state and dynamic experiments on isolated cat lungs. We then compared the results with those predicted by the model. We found that the model provided a good fit to the steady-state data. However, to fit the dynamic data, some modifications were necessary to account for the viscous behavior of the vessel walls and to move the first moment of the distribution of vascular resistance toward the arterial end of the vascular bed relative to that of the distribution of vascular compliance. Due to the sensitivity of the vascular resistance to small changes in vessel diameters and branching ratio, the modifications in morphometry represent small changes in morphometric data and are probably within the range of uncertainty in such data. The modifications had little effect on the steady-state model simulations but substantially improved the dynamic model simulations, suggesting that the dynamic data are quite sensitive to small changes in the relative distributions of vessel diameters and elasticity.\r"

Studies were made using cultured bovine and sheep pulmonary-artery endothelial cells. The transendothelial 125I-albumin flux from the luminal-to-abluminal side was compared with the flux from the abluminal-to-luminal side. The endothelial cells were grown to confluence on gelatinized-polycarbonated filters separating the abluminal from the luminal compartments. The albumin concentration in each compartment was 1 g/100 ml to equalize the oncotic pressure gradients. The effect of hydrostatic pressure was eliminated by maintaining equal fluid levels in both compartments. The transendothelial albumin flux across the monolayer was measured by adding the 125I-albumin tracer either on the luminal or the abluminal side. A double-isotope method was also used to study bidirectional transendothelial flux of albumin at the same time for the same cultured endothelium. The results indicated that albumin flux from the luminal-to-abluminal side was equal to the flux from the abluminal-to-luminal side. Both bovine and sheep pulmonary artery endothelial cells in culture behave symmetrically for albumin, suggesting that albumin is not actively transported from the interstitium to the lumen.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of choline deficiency on the de novo pathway for phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis in the lung was investigated in rats fed a washed soy protein (lipotrophic) diet deficient in choline and methionine for 2-3 wk. Lungs from lipotrophic rats showed a decreased content of choline and choline-phosphate (P less than 0.05) compared with control but no change in content of cytidine 5'-diphosphocholine or PC. Isolated perfused lungs from lipotrophic rats were evaluated for choline and fatty acid utilization for PC synthesis. Lipotrophic lungs perfused with 5 microM [14C-methyl]-choline chloride showed increased incorporation into PC while there was no significant effect at saturating levels of choline (100 microM). There was increased incorporation of [1-14C]-palmitic acid into PC and diglyceride and increased incorporation of D-[U-14C]glucose into fatty acids of PC. Increased choline and glucose incorporation was not due to alteration of intracellular specific activity of these substrates. This study indicates the utilization of choline and fatty acid for PC synthesis is stimulated as a result of choline deficiency while lung CDP-choline concentration is maintained, possibly through regulation of choline phosphate cytidyl transferase activity. These mechanisms compensate for decreased choline availability to maintain the PC content of lungs.\r"

This clinical pattern has been termed high-pressure nervous syndrome (HPNS). These symptoms may represent an alteration in synaptic transmission in the central nervous system with the inhibitory neural pathways being affected in particular. Since gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transmission has been implicated in other seizure disorders, it was of interest to study GABAergic function at high pressure. Isolated synaptosomes were used to follow GABA release at 67.7 ATA of pressure. The major observation was a 33% depression in total [3H]GABA efflux from depolarized cerebrocortical synaptosomes at 67.7 ATA. The Ca2+-dependent component of release was found to be completely blocked during the 1st min of [3H]GABA efflux with a slow rise over the subsequent 3 min. These findings lead us to conclude that high pressure interferes with the intraterminal cascade for Ca2+-dependent release of GABA.\r"

Awake lambs were intubated and studied in a plethysmograph that measured dynamic compliance (Cdyn), resistance of the lung (RL), and functional residual capacity (FRC). Pleural pressure was measured using a Silastic balloon in the pleural space, and airway opening pressure (Pao) was measured using a catheter placed 1-2 cm distal to the nasotracheal tube. At the ages of 1, 3, 5, and 7 mo and adulthood, measurements of Cdyn, RL, and FRC were obtained in 46 sheep (22 males, 24 females). AR to carbachol, histamine, and citric acid was measured in each sheep in randomized order on three separate days by giving increasing concentrations of the drug in a noncumulative fashion. The dose that would have caused a 35% reduction in Cdyn (ED65Cdyn), a doubling of RL (ED200RL), or a 50% increase in FRC (ED150FRC) was calculated. In both males and females, base-line Cdyn increased (r = 0.81, P less than 0.01) with age, as did FRC (r = 0.87, P less than 0.01). There was no significant change in RL in either sex with age or in the group as a whole. There was a significant increase in AR to both histamine and carbachol with increasing age as measured by a decrease in ED65Cdyn (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.05, respectively) with age. There was no significant change in AR with age as measured by RL or FRC for any of the three bronchoconstrictors tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Animals with strong positive skin reactivity towards A. suum were trained to sit quietly in chairs and to breathe through face masks. Dynamic compliance (Cdyn) and pulmonary resistance (RL) were measured in these conscious animals before and for a period of 11 h after administration of an aerosol of Ascaris or ragweed antigen. The aerosol of Ascaris antigen induced reproducible increases (42%) in RL (P less than 0.001) and decreases (17%) in Cdyn (P less than 0.01) that peaked respectively 5 and 35 min after antigen challenge and lasted 60-90 min. After recovery, a second bronchoconstriction began between 2 and 8 h and peaked between 4 and 10 h after antigen challenge. Decreases in Cdyn (41%) were significantly greater (P less than 0.003) whereas mean increases in RL (44%) were similar during the late phase as compared with the first phase. The mean Cdyn decreases lasted a minimum of 2 h, whereas RL increases lasted less than 60 min. The time course of the responses varied from animal to animal but changes in individual animals were reproducible over a period of 6 mo. No significant correlation was observed between the cutaneous and the pulmonary responses to Ascaris and the late response was not reversed by aerosol administration of salbutamol (1.0 mg/ml). As a negative control animals were exposed to an aerosol of ragweed extract after which no immediate or late pulmonary response were observed. The results suggest that this primate model may be useful to study the pathophysiology of asthma in humans.\r"

Bypass perfusion withdrew systemic flow from the right atrium and returned it to the aorta after gas exchange. Ventricles were fibrillated. The left heart was isolated by tying all pulmonary veins, and it was perfused separately at low flow admitted through one pulmonary vein and withdrawn from the ventricle. Left-heart pressure was intermittently raised abruptly from a nominal base line of 0 by partial occlusion of outflow. Pressures from approximately 10 to 50 cmH2O caused proportional increases in breathing frequency and decreases in expiratory and inspiratory times. Changes occurred immediately, reached a plateau within approximately 20 s, and were sustained for periods of observation as long as 3 min. Recovery to base line followed stimulus removal. Vagal cooling to 8 degrees C prevented responses, but autonomic ganglion blockade with hexamethonium had no effect. I conclude that breathing may be stimulated by left-heart distension and that this is mediated by large myelinated vagal afferents.\r"

Each subject breathed with a constant tidal volume of 1 liter, at 10-12 breaths/min and at constant flow rates. For each breath we computed the slope of the alveolar plateau normalized by the mean expired N2 concentration (Sn), the Bohr dead space (VDB), and an index analogous to the Fowler dead space (V50). In all five subjects, Sn, VDB, and V50 decreased with breath holding, indicating diffusion dependence of these indexes. Over the first five breaths the rate of increase of Sn as a function of cumulative expired volume (delta Sn/delta sigma VE) decreased by 29 and 54% during BH1 and BH4, respectively, compared with BH0. In contrast, from breath 5 to the end of the washout there was no significant change in delta Sn/delta sigma VE during BH1 and BH4 compared with BH0. Our results provide further experimental support for the hypothesis that the increase of Sn as a function of cumulative expired volume after the fifth breath constitutes a diffusion-independent index of ventilation inhomogeneity. It therefore reflects alveolar gas inequalities among larger units.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Intramuscular estradiol (10 mg) 44-60 h before study significantly decreased perfusate concentrations of 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha), the stable metabolite of the pulmonary vasodilator, prostacyclin, but did not significantly affect the stimulus-response relationship between PIO2 and Ppa50. Estradiol (20 mg) 3-5 days before study increased 6-keto-PGF1 alpha concentrations and decreased Ppa50 at PIO2 of 10, 30, and 50 Torr. Indomethacin added to the perfusate of these lungs reduced 6-keto-PGF1 alpha to undetectable levels and altered the estradiol-induced attenuation, increasing Ppa50 at PIO2 of 10 and 30 Torr, but decreasing Ppa50 at PIO2 of 200 Torr. Despite these effects, Ppa50 remained lower than the values measured in lungs not treated with estradiol. These results suggest that the estradiol-induced attenuation of the hypoxic stimulus-response relationship was mediated only in part by cyclooxygenase products, the net effects of which were vasodilation at PIO2 of 10 and 30 Torr, but vasoconstriction at PIO2 of 200 Torr.\r"

We have now investigated the effect of this peripheral chemoreceptor stimulant on diaphragmatic and genioglossal (GG, an upper airway-maintaining muscle) electromyograms in five unanesthetized, chronically instrumented, spontaneously breathing adult cats during slow-wave sleep. In 12 studies almitrine doses of 1.0-6.0 mg/kg increased inspired minute ventilation (VI), frequency (f), and tidal volume (VT) and decreased expiratory time (TE). However, almitrine doses as high as 6.0 mg/kg failed to augment phasic inspiratory GG activity. To determine why almitrine induced phasic inspiratory upper airway activity in anesthetized, vagotomized cats but not in sleeping cats, additional studies were performed. In four dose-response studies in three pentobarbital-anesthetized cats, almitrine, 1.0-6.0 mg/kg, did not produce phasic inspiratory GG activity. Almitrine did induce phasic inspiratory GG activity in two of three studies in three vagotomized, tracheostomized, alpha-chloralose-urethan-anesthetized cats. These results suggest that almitrine would not be useful in obstructive sleep apnea, yet because almitrine markedly increased VI, f, and VT and decreased TE in unanesthetized sleeping cats the drug may be effective in patients who lack normal central neural respiratory drive, such as the preterm infant.\r"

Since N2 habituation is much slower than pressure conditioning (t1/2 6 days vs. 12 h), this precludes mere addition of pressure and N2 effects in this situation. In contrast to Pc, anesthesia tolerance of mice exposed to 80 ATA in the presence of 18 atm N2 increases even more (25%) than at the same PN2 but at a total pressure of only 18 ATA, indicating that pressure reversal of anesthesia does not extend to the habituation events. The implications of the striking asymmetry between the effects of protracted high pressure and inert gas narcotic exposures for an understanding of the nature of the supposed IG/HP antagonism are discussed.\r"

Measurements were taken from a segment of the upper airway between the nares and midtrachea while the dog breathed through a tracheostoma. These pressure changes represented the sum of respiratory-related forces generated by all muscles of the upper airway. The mean base-line level of upper airway pressure (Pua) was -0.5 +/- 0.03 cmH2O during W, increased by a mean of 2.1 +/- 0.2 cmH2O during SWS, and was variable during REM sleep. The mean inspiratory-related phasic change in Pua was -1.2 +/- 0.1 cmH2O during wakefulness. During SWS, this phasic change in Pua decreased significantly to a mean of -0.9 +/- 0.1 cmH2O (P less than 0.05). During REM sleep, the phasic activity was extremely variable with periods in which there were no fluctuations in Pua and others with high swings in Pua. These data indicate that in dogs the sum of forces which dilate the upper airway during W decreases during SWS and REM sleep. The consistent coupling between inspiratory drive and upper airway dilatation during wakefulness persists in SWS, but is frequently uncoupled during REM sleep.\r"

After reinfusion of shed blood, sheep recovered from anesthesia and we measured lung lymph flow (QL), lymph-to-plasma concentration ratio for proteins, and time taken to reach half-equilibrium concentration of intravenous tracer albumin in lymph (t1/2). Twenty-four hours after bolus injection of radio-albumin we lavaged subsegments of the right upper lobe and determined fractional equilibration of the tracer in the alveolar luminal-lining layer.

Animals were killed, and the lungs were used for gravimetric determination of extravascular lung water (gravimetric extravascular lung water-to-dry weight ratio) 24 h after resuscitation from shock. Pulmonary endothelial injury after resuscitation was evidenced by marked increase in QL, without fall in lymph-to-plasma ratio. Time taken to reach half-equilibrium concentration fell from 169 +/- 47 (SD) min in base-line studies to 53 +/- 33 min after shock. There was no evidence of lung epithelial injury. Gravimetric extravascular lung water-to-dry weight ratio was significantly increased in these animals killed 24 h after resuscitation (4.94 +/- 0.29) compared with values in our laboratory controls (4.13 +/- 0.09, mean +/- SD). These data demonstrate a loss of lung endothelial integrity in sheep after resuscitation from profound hemorrhagic shock.\r"

  ".W": "We measured energy expenditure with the doubly labeled water technique during heavy sustained exercise in the Tour de France, a bicycle race lasting more than 3 wk. Four subjects were observed for consecutive intervals of 7, 8, and 7 days. Each interval started with an oral isotope dose to reach an excess isotope level of 200 ppm 18O and 130 ppm 2H. The biological half-lives of the isotopes were between 2.25 and 3.80 days. Energy expenditure was compared with simultaneous measurements of energy intake, and body mass and body composition did not change significantly. The doubly labeled water technique gave higher values for energy expenditure than the food record technique. The discrepancy showed a systematic increment from the first to the third interval, being 12.9 +/- 7.9, 21.4 +/- 9.8, and 35.3 +/- 4.4% of the energy expenditure calculated from dietary intake, respectively. Possible explanations for the discrepancy are discussed. The subjects reached an average daily metabolic rate of 3.4-3.9 or 4.3-5.3 times basal metabolic rate based on the food record technique and the doubly labeled water technique, respectively. Thus, when measured with the same technique, the energetic ceiling for performance in humans is comparable with that of animals like birds.\r"

In individual subjects, Q increased linearly against VO2 in the submaximum exercise range. The SD of Q on VO2 was so small (0.47 +/- 0.25 l/min) that Q could be given by a linear function of VO2 as Q = K(VO2 - VO2 r) + Qr, where K, VO2 r, and Qr are the slope of the regression line, the resting VO2, and resting Q, respectively. K varied widely among the subjects studied, ranging from 5.5 to 10.3 and was independent of both physical characteristics and Qr, which ranged from 3.7 to 8.3 l/min. However, K correlated significantly with changes in heart rate, stroke volume, mean arterial pressure, and systemic vascular conductance. From these results, we concluded that the intersubject variability in the Q-VO2 relation was caused independently by individual variations in resting hemodynamics and in cardiovascular response to exercise.\r"

  ".W": "This study investigates the dynamic and resting intramuscular pressures associated with eccentric and concentric exercise of muscles in a low-compliance compartment. The left and righ leg anterior compartments of eight healthy males (ages 22-32 yr) were exercised by either concentric or eccentric contractions of the same load (400 submaximal contractions at constant rate, 20/min for 20 min at a load corresponding to 15% of individual maximal dorsiflexion torque). Tissue fluid pressures were measured with the slit-catheter technique before, during, and after the exercise. Average peak intramuscular pressure generated during eccentric exercise (236 mmHg) was significantly greater than during concentric exercise (157 mmHg, P less than 0.001). Peak isometric contraction pressure in the eccentrically exercised compartment was significantly higher both within 20 min postexercise and on the second postexercise day (P less than 0.001). Resting pressure 2 days postexercise was significantly higher on the eccentrically exercised side (10.5 mmHg) compared with the concentrically exercised (4.4 mmHg, P less than 0.05). The ability to sustain tension during postexercise isometric contractions was impaired on the \"eccentric\" side. Soreness was exclusively experienced in the eccentrically exercised muscles. We conclude that eccentric exercise causes significant intramuscular pressure elevation in the anterior compartment, not seen following concentric exercise, and that this may be one of the factors associated with development of delayed muscle soreness in a tight compartment.\r"

A probe was used to detect changes in height with time of the tracheal epithelium relative to an underlying cartilage. Tracheal vascular resistance was determined by perfusing a cranial tracheal artery at constant flow and measuring inflow pressure. Various drugs injected close-arterially were tested in 20 greyhounds anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium. Bradykinin, histamine, and methacholine significantly (P less than 0.01) decreased vascular resistance (-39.3 +/- 3.7, -47.3 +/- 4.2, and -22.5 +/- 5.2%, respectively) and increased the thickness of the mucosa (119.0 +/- 25.0, 61.9 +/- 25.0, and 46.3 +/- 6.4 micron). Substance P, vasoactive intestinal peptide, prostaglandin F2 alpha, and prostaglandin E, had large vasodilator actions (-31.4 +/- 5.0, -34.3 +/- 2.2, -21.9 +/- 2.8, and -31.5 +/- 2.4%) but only small effects on mucosal thickness (12.3 +/- 3.9, 13.0 +/- 3.4, 16.7 +/- 6.5, and 8.7 +/- 2.9 micron, respectively). Phenylephrine hydrochloride increased vascular resistance (19.8 +/- 1.7%) and decreased mucosal thickness (-23.9 +/- 3.1 micron). Thus airway vascular resistance and mucosal thickness always change in opposite directions, but drugs have different relative actions on the two variables. Even with large vasodilatations, the absolute changes in mucosal thickness were small and were unlikely to have an appreciable effect on tracheal airway resistance.\r"

We measured pulmonary arterial and left atrial pressures and by micropuncture the pressures in 20- to 80-micron-diam subpleural arterioles and venules, both before and after paralyzing the vasculature with papaverine hydrochloride. In five lungs we also determined the microvascular pressure profile during reverse perfusion. In lungs with baseline vasomotor tone, approximately 32% of the total pressure drop was in arteries, approximately 32% in microvessels, and approximately 36% in veins. With elimination of vasomotor tone, arterial and venous resistances decreased to one-fifth and one-half of base-line values, respectively, indicating that vasomotor tone contributed mainly toward arterial resistance. During reverse perfusion, the pressure drop in veins was similar to that in arteries during forward perfusion, suggesting that the compliance of arteries and veins is comparable. We conclude that vascular tone and compliance are important factors that determine the distribution of segmental vascular resistance in lungs of the newborn.\r"

Complement was activated by cobra venom factor (CVF) infusion (400 U/kg for 1 h iv). Studies were made in two groups of sheep: 1) infusion of CVF containing the endogenous phospholipase A2 (PLA2) (n = 6); and 2) infusion of CVF pretreated with bromophenacyl bromide to inhibit PLA2 activity (n = 5). Intravascular complement activation transiently increased mean pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in both groups. Pulmonary lymph flow (Qlym) and lymph protein clearance (Qlym X lymph-to-plasma protein concentration ratio) were also transiently increased in both groups. Pulmonary vascular permeability to proteins was assessed by raising left atrial pressure and determining the lymph-to-plasma protein concentration ratio (L/P) at maximal Qlym. In both groups the L/P at maximal Qlym was not different from normal. In a separate group (n = 4), CVF-induced complement activation was associated with 111In-oxine granulocyte sequestration in the lungs. In vitro plasma from CVF-treated animals aggregated neutrophils but did not stimulate neutrophils to produce superoxide anion generation. Therefore, CVF-induced complement activation results in pulmonary neutrophil sequestration and in increases in PVR and lymph protein clearance. The increase in lymph protein clearance is due to increased pulmonary microvascular pressure and not increased vascular permeability to proteins.\r"

Since cyclooxygenase metabolites have been implicated in mediating these responses, we also examined the role of the cyclooxygenase pathway. PAF infusion (4 micrograms X kg-1 X h-1 for 3 h) produced a rapid, transient rise in pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), plasma thromboxane B2 concentration (TxB2), and pulmonary lymph flow (Qlym). The lymph-to-plasma protein concentration ratio (L/P) did not change from base line. Pretreatment with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, sodium meclofenamate, prevented the generation of TxB2 and the hemodynamic changes but did not prevent the increase in Qlym. The estimated protein reflection coefficient decreased from a control value of 0.66 +/- 0.04 to 0.43 +/- 0.06 after PAF infusion. We also studied the effects of PAF on endothelial permeability in vitro by measuring the flux of 125I-albumin across cultured bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (EC) grown to confluency on a gelatinized micropore filter and mounted within a modified Boyden chemotaxis chamber. PAF (10(-8) to 10(-4) M) had no direct effect on EC albumin permeability, suggesting that the increase in permeability in sheep was not the direct lytic effect of PAF. In conclusion, PAF produces pulmonary vasoconstriction mediated by cyclooxygenase metabolites. PAF also increases pulmonary vascular permeability to protein that is independent of cyclooxygenase products and is not the result of a direct effect of PAF on the endothelium.\r"

Leukocyte counts, plasma norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (E), and cardiac output were measured at rest and in the steady state of several submaximal work loads when subjects exercised on a cycle ergometer. The results in control experiments were compared with those obtained on a different day with propranolol. Propranolol decreased heart rate at all work loads (P less than 0.001) but had no effect on the increase in cardiac output at increasing work loads. Plasma NE and E levels were similar at rest and in exercise in control and propranolol studies. There was no effect of propranolol on the increase in leukocyte counts with increasing work loads. Although propranolol did not affect the increase in total leukocyte count, the increase in lymphocyte count at higher work loads was less with propranolol. We conclude that the demargination of leukocytes from the pulmonary circulation in exercise is probably a mechanical effect of the increase in cardiac output. However, we have not excluded a contribution from a humoral event that would decrease the adherence of leukocytes to endothelium during exercise. The smaller increase in lymphocytes at higher work loads in the presence of propranolol suggests that catecholamines affect the lymphocyte count over and above their effect on cardiac output.\r"

In a volume-displacement plethysmograph, MEFV curves were performed before and after inhalation of aerosolized isoproterenol (I) or histamine (H). Five filtered MEFV curves were averaged, and slope ratio vs. volume (SR-V) plots were obtained from averaged curves. Following I, maximal flows at 75% of the vital capacity (VC) were decreased in asthmatics but not in normal subjects. Flows at 50 and 25% of the VC increased in normal subjects and asthmatics, whereas VC's were unchanged. In asthmatics, sudden large decreases in flow (bumps) occurred at lower lung volumes following I. H reduced flows over the entire VC, with greater reductions occurring in asthmatics than in normals, particularly at low lung volumes. In asthmatics, VC was slightly reduced, and bumps in MEFV curve configuration occurred at higher lung volumes or were abolished entirely following H. A reduction in the amount of configurational detail appreciable in MEFV curves following histamine in asthmatics was best seen in SR-V plots. Following H, SR's decreased regularly with decreasing lung volume in all the asthmatics but in none of the normals. This was the single most striking finding of this study. Mild I- and H-induced perturbations of airway bronchomotor tone produced small but consistent changes in MEFV curve configuration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Simulation results were compared with directly measured intraluminal airway temperature profiles previously obtained in normal human subjects, and a good correlation was demonstrated. The model was used to study aspects of regional pulmonary heat transfer and to predict the outcomes of experiments not yet performed. The results of these simulations show that a decrease in inspired air temperature and water content at fixed minute ventilation produces a proportionately larger increase in heat loss from extrathoracic airways relative to intrathoracic, whereas an increase in minute ventilation at fixed inspired air conditions produces the opposite pattern, with cold dry air penetrating further into the lung, and that changes in breathing pattern (tidal volume and frequency) at fixed minute ventilation and fixed inspiratory-to-expiratory (I/E) ratio do not affect local air temperature profiles and heat loss, whereas changes in I/E ratio at fixed minute ventilation do cause a significant change.\r"

Least-squares regression analysis showed that in 10 chronically instrumented fetal lambs, V1 increased from 51.0 ml at 119 days to 104.6 ml at 135 days (V1 = -347.65 + 3.35 X days; 95% confidence limits on slope: 1.89-4.81) before declining to 70.2 ml at 142 days gestation (V1 = 768.8 - 4.92 X days; 95% confidence limits on slope: -2.55 to -7.30). Similarly Vs increased from 7.4 ml/h at 119 days to 16.8 ml/h at 133 days (Vs = -72.35 + 0.67 X days; 95% confidence limits on slope: 0.21-1.14), before declining to 7.1 ml/h at 142 days (Vs = 159.07 - 1.07 X days; 95% confidence limits on slope: -0.56 to -1.57). Vtr did not change significantly with gestation. We conclude that V1 increases until 135 days gestation, after which it falls substantially. This fall in volume, which occurs well before the onset of labor, results predominantly from the decline in Vs.\r"
