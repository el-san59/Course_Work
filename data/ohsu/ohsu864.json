Methods have now been established to determine risk factors in the pediatric age and, with a family history, to begin to identify children at potential risk for premature heart disease. Advances have also been made in developing models for intervention and beginning prevention through both high-risk and population strategies directed at schoolchildren. Obviously, both approaches are needed and complement each other. An impressive future is ahead for effective preventive cardiology beginning with children by incorporation of cardiovascular health education and health promotion in elementary schools. Applying behavioral concepts to intervention programs can strengthen their chances of success. The overall good of having children adopt healthy life-styles with an understanding of their necessity is now attainable. It will be the responsibility of physicians to guide the direction of programs being promoted for children.\r"

Such services probably already have contributed to the decline of cardiovascular mortality, and the current levels of risk factors in the United States population indicate that substantial further reduction should be possibly by creating a smoke-free environment by the year 2000 and by implementing the recommendations of the National Cholesterol and High Blood Pressure Education Programs.\r"

  ".W": "Hypertension has been demonstrated to be a clear risk factor for CHD. The finding that hypertension is a risk factor has been demonstrated in observation studies, actuarial data and clinical trials. The relationship between blood pressure and CHD is strong. As blood pressure rises, risk for cardiovascular events increases. This is true for both sexes, for blacks and whites, and for all age categories. Clinical trials, both large and small, have demonstrated that lowering blood pressure can reverse the risk and reduce morbidity and mortality. This cause-and-effect relationship has been replicated consistently, and there is not one well-controlled trial of adequate size that has failed to show this finding. It is important to know which concept of risk to use in developing hypertensive programs. The concept of relative risk is useful to determine whether a public health program is needed within a population, but it has less value in identifying which subset of the population in which to intervene. In essence, relative risk is used to mandate a program but cannot determine where the program should be directed. Hypertension attributable risk describes which individuals are at greatest risk and serves to guide planners as to which groups have the greatest mortality once blood pressure becomes elevated. Population attributable risk becomes the most useful tool in identifying or locating those communities of highest-risk individuals.\r"

  ".W": "ISH is a distinct pathogenetic entity defined by SBP readings of greater than or equal to 160 and DBP less than 90 mmHg. The etiology, although not well understood, is in some manner related to a reduction in connective tissue elasticity of large blood vessels and an increase in aortic impedance or a decrease in aortic wall compliance. The pathophysiologic consequences include an increased resistance to systolic ejection of blood and a disproportionate increase in SBP. Although not directly related, there is an important increase in peripheral vascular resistance. The prevalence of ISH in several studies is about 7 percent in those over age 60 and increases with age to nearly 20 percent in those over age 80. There is higher prevalence in females and nonwhites. The guidelines for detection of ISH are similar to those for blood pressure evaluation in general. Precautions for detection and evaluation in the elderly include multiple blood pressure measurements in the fasting state and sitting and supine blood pressure measurements before and during therapy. Pseudohypertension, although rare, should be kept in mind. There is a clear risk associated with ISH for stroke, CVD, and premature death, which increases with age and rising levels of SBP. ISH can be controlled effectively with pharmacologic therapies. A reasonable goal is a 20 mmHg reduction in systolic pressure. Proof of reduced risk for stroke, CHD, and death in those with controlled ISH remains to be demonstrated. The SHEP pilot study has demonstrated feasibility of addressing this issue. The full-scale SHEP study addresses this issue and has completed recruitment of the desired sample size and is in follow-up phase. Scheduled completion is in 1991. While we wait for the SHEP full-scale trial results, the prudent approach is for nonpharmacologic therapy and use of pharmacologic agents in that group of patients who demonstrate a large cardiovascular risk burden or increasing symptoms specifically associated with hypertension. The decision to treat must be on an individual patient basis. Pharmacologic therapy is possible in most patients with few or no adverse effects. The \"low and slow\" approach to therapy is helpful in minimizing these adverse effects. Low-dose diuretics have been documented to be effective in blood pressure control. Chlorthalidone, 12.5 or 25 mg per day, is suggested. Other agents, such as beta-blockers, reserpine, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers, are best used as Step 2 agents.\r"

Weanling rabbits infected with 10(10) organisms of a human pathogenic Y. enterocolitica strain were compared with control and pair-fed, sham-treated animals. On day 6, infection resulted in a diffuse decrease in brush border enzyme activities in the small intestine and villus atrophy and crypt hyperplasia in the ileum. By day 14, ileal architecture and jejunal disaccharidases had returned to normal, but enzyme abnormalities persisted in the ileum. Ultrastructural studies showed decreased brush border surface area in the jejunum and ileum on day 6 and in the ileum on day 14 of infection. Abnormalities of brush border function caused by infection correlated with the changes in microvillus surface area. In pair-fed animals on day 6, brush border surface area was slightly decreased in the ileum but increased in the jejunum, suggesting that the brush border injury resulted from infection rather than from malnutrition alone. The findings indicate that Y. enterocolitica inflicts a diffuse brush border injury that is in keeping with the generalized defect in brush border enzyme activity and transport function.\r"

Immunofluorescence staining on cryostat sections demonstrated the presence of sucrase-isomaltase in the apical region of normal colonic crypt cells but not on surface epithelium. Colonic sucrase-isomaltase was purified by immunoprecipitation with selected monoclonal antibodies and identified predominantly as high-mannose and complex glycosylated single-chain precursors endowed with relatively low levels of enzyme activities. Most polyps examined (10/16) were also found to express significant amounts of sucrase-isomaltase. In contrast, only 3 of 45 adenocarcinomas were positive by immunofluorescence staining; no correlation was found between enzyme expression and tumor classification either by \"Dukes\" stage or degree of histological differentiation. These results demonstrate that colonic crypt cells and some benign tumor cells synthesize and express at their cell surface a form of sucrase-isomaltase immunologically distinct from that present in the brush borders of small intestinal villose cells.\r"

In this study, in situ hybridization histochemistry and immunohistochemistry were used to determine how these protooncogenes and the corresponding oncoproteins are expressed at the cellular level during gastric regeneration after mucosal injuries caused by indomethacin. In addition, cells in the S-phase were immunohistochemically detected by means of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation. Expression of the c-myc gene was localized to nuclei and reached a maximum at 3 h, and that of the c-Ha-ras gene was localized to cytoplasm with a peak at 6-12 h after treatment on the mucous neck, parietal, chief, and enterochromaffinlike cells around the lesions. The distribution of cells in the S-phase roughly coincided with that of cells in which expression of the protooncogenes was detected. In conclusion, various types of gastric mucosal cells participated in the sequential regulated expression of cellular protooncogenes during regeneration of the rat stomach.\r"

All patients continued taking the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and were reendoscoped after 4 wk of therapy. Success at that time was defined as complete resolution of all gastric mucosal damage. Six hundred fifty-eight patients were enrolled in the three trials. Significantly more patients experienced healing in the arbaprostil treatment groups in all trials compared with those who received placebo. The healing rates in the various trials were 68% and 32% (10 micrograms vs. placebo; p = 0.007); 77% and 23% (25 micrograms vs. placebo; p less than 0.001); and 52%, 46%, 35%, and 16% (50, 25, and 10 micrograms vs. placebo; p less than 0.001, less than 0.001, and 0.002, respectively). Diarrhea, mostly of a mild nature, was the only arbaprostil-associated side effect and was found with the 25- and 50-microgram dosages (33% and 59%, respectively). No exacerbation of arthritis signs or symptoms was found. Arbaprostil at doses with varying effects on gastric acid secretion (25 and 50 micrograms) was documented in these trials to be an effective and safe agent for healing gastric mucosal damage associated with aspirin or other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in patients with either rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis without adversely affecting joint symptomatology.\r"

Three groups of Hooded-Lister rats were studied: animals sensitized to egg albumin; sham-sensitized animals; and unmanipulated controls. In sensitized rats, serum immunoglobulin E titers to egg albumin were greater than or equal to 1:64, whereas control and pair-fed rats showed no response. Sensitized rats received egg albumin 1 mg/ml in drinking water and rat chow ad libitum. Pair-fed animals also received egg albumin but were pair-fed with sensitized animals. Controls received water and rat chow ad libitum. Chronic antigen challenge resulted in reduced food intake and weight gain in sensitized animals. When the rats were killed after 9 days of antigen exposure, proximal intestine from experimental animals showed decreased disaccharidase activity, brush-border microvillus surface, area, and villus height. Crypt depth and enterocyte migration rate were increased. Mucosal mast cell involvement was suggested by mast cell proliferation, evidence of mast cell degranulation, and increased serum rat mast cell protease II levels. At the time of death, only sensitized jejunum demonstrated an increase in short-circuit current in Ussing chambers in response to antigen challenge. The findings indicate that chronic antigen exposure leads to intestinal injury, reduced food intake, and diminished weight gain.\r"

A total of 22 cirrhotic patients and 14 normal volunteers were examined by two skilled operators using duplex Doppler within a period of 1-3 mo (6 cirrhotics and 7 normal volunteers by both observers). Area, mean velocity, and flow were measured (4 measurements: A, B on day 1; C, D on day 2). The intraclass correlation coefficient was used to assess both the statistical and clinical significance of intraobserver and interobserver agreement for the measurements of these three parameters. The level of intraobserver agreement for each parameter on normal subjects and cirrhotics was obtained from the two measurements on the same day and from the two measurements at the same time on consecutive days. Overall agreement between the four measurements was also calculated. Levels of interobserver agreement were obtained by calculating separately the intraclass correlation coefficient from each of the four pairs by measurements made on the same subject by the two observers over the same period of 2 days. The coefficient of variation was also used to compare the variability in these measurements. Overall, intraobserver agreement on normal subjects varied from good to excellent for observer 1, and from fair to good for observer 2. On cirrhotic patients, observer 1 was excellent at all times for all parameters. Observer 2 had lower intraclass correlation coefficient values, especially for velocity on consecutive days. For the best of the two observers on the portal flow, the coefficient of variation in cirrhotic patients ranged from 2%-30% with a mean +/- SEM of 12% +/- 4%. No acceptable interobserver agreement was found between the two observers in either of the two samples of subjects. These results support the use of this technique mainly for the determination of rapid and large changes in portal hemodynamics within a short period of time. The technique seems to have low precision in monitoring chronic changes in portal hemodynamics.\r"

During the observation period, four episodes of biliary complaints were recorded in three patients in whom fragments with maximum diameters of 3.5-5.0 mm were found. The only chemical abnormality was a temporary elevation of lipase activity to twice the normal range in 1 case. All fragments were identified as gallbladder stones by infrared spectroscopy on the basis of their (varyingly high) cholesterol content. By macroscopic criteria, most of the fragments were from mixed stones; therefore, provided there is a functioning gallbladder and sufficiently fine fragmentation, successful extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy does not seem to be limited to pure cholesterol stones.\r"

In this study, peptides were isolated from the mucin protein core by protease digestion and molecular-sieve high-performance liquid chromatography. Tryptic peptides were purified by anion exchange or reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, and amino acid compositions were determined. Tryptic peptides were (a) nonglycosylated, (b) selectively enriched in serine, glutamic acid plus glutamine, and glycine, and (c) depleted in threonine and proline compared with native gallbladder mucin. Bilirubin derivatized with Woodward's reagent K covalently bound to purified mucin. Tryptic digestion of the mucin-bilirubin complex yielded low-molecular-weight nonglycosylated peptides with covalently bound bilirubin. These data indicate that the mucin protein core contains at least two distinct domains. One domain is rich in threonine and proline and contains the majority of covalently bound carbohydrate. A second domain, possibly internally located, is nonglycosylated, enriched in serine, glutamic acid plus glutamine, and glycine, and binds hydrophobic ligands such as bilirubin and 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonate. Hydrophobic domains on the mucin protein core may contribute to the pathogenesis of cholesterol cholelithiasis.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of pancreatic proteases or juice on the sodium oleate-stimulated pancreatic secretion and plasma concentrations of secretin and cholecystokinin in anesthetized rats was investigated. Each rat received sodium oleate in a dose of 0.12 mmol.h-1 via a duodenal tube. Sodium oleate infusion significantly increased pancreatic secretion (volume and protein output) compared with the saline given the control group. The increase in pancreatic secretion paralleled significant elevations of plasma concentrations of secretin and cholecystokinin. To determine a possible role of pancreatic proteases on the responses induced by sodium oleate, saline, chymotrypsin, and trypsin, a combination of chymotrypsin and trypsin or pancreatic juice was infused into the duodenum. The pancreatic secretion was significantly reduced by pancreatic proteases or pancreatic juice, and the reduction paralleled the decreases in plasma concentrations of the two hormones. These agents suppressed both pancreatic secretion and plasma hormone levels in the following order of magnitude: (pancreatic juice or chymotrypsin + trypsin) greater than (trypsin) greater than (chymotrypsin). The reduction of pancreatic secretion by pancreatic proteases was reversed by intravenous administration of secretin and cholecystokinin in physiological doses. It is concluded that negative-feedback regulation of pancreatic secretion is operative in the intestinal phase in rats and that both secretin and cholecystokinin are involved in the regulation.\r"

  ".U": "90249662\r", 
  ".W": "It has been found by immunohistochemical staining that antigens normally found in gastric and/or intestinal epithelial cells are expressed in most differentiated duct cell carcinomas of the pancreas. Among 88 such tumors, 93% and 92%, respectively, expressed M1 and cathepsin E, markers of gastric surface-foveolar epithelial cells, 51% expressed pepsinogen II, a marker of gastroduodenal mucopeptic cells, 48% expressed CAR-5, a marker of colorectal epithelial cells, and 35% expressed M3SI, a marker of small intestinal goblet cells. Most of the tumors also expressed normal pancreatic duct antigens; 97% expressed DU-PAN-2, and 59% expressed N-terminus gastrin-releasing peptide. In agreement with these findings, electron microscopy revealed malignant cells with fine structural features of gastric foveolar cells, gastric mucopeptic cells, intestinal goblet cells, intestinal columnar cells, pancreatic duct epithelial cells, and cells with features of more than one cell type. Normal pancreatic duct epithelium did not express any marker of gastrointestinal epithelial cells, whereas such benign lesions as mucinous cell hypertrophy and papillary hyperplasia commonly expressed gut-type antigens but rarely expressed pancreatic duct cell markers. By contrast, lesions characterized by atypical papillary hyperplasia commonly expressed both gastric and pancreatic duct cell markers. Metaplastic pyloric-type glands expressed pepsinogen II and, except for their expression of cathepsin E, were indistinguishable from normal pyloric glands. In marked contrast, the immunohistochemical and ultrastructural features of 14 ductuloacinar cell tumors were those of cells lining terminal ductules, centroacinar cells, and/or acinar cells; none expressed any gut-type antigen. The results indicate that gastrointestinal differentiation is common in both benign and malignant lesions of pancreatic duct epithelium and suggest that duct cell carcinomas are histogenetically related to gastric- and intestinal-type metaplastic changes of epithelial cells lining the main and interlobular ducts of the pancreas.\r"

  ".W": "Several studies have reported effects of gastrointestinal regulatory peptides on growth of experimentally induced pancreatic neoplasms and human cancer cell lines. The growth of human pancreatic cancer lines PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 was characterized in vitro, and the effects of cholecystokinin, bombesin, insulin, epidermal growth factor, secretin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and somatostatin were determined. Fetal bovine serum was required for initiation of growth in both cell lines. Growth effects of peptides were determined by incubating cells with peptides in serum-free medium after a 72-h preincubation in 10% serum-supplemented medium alone. Epidermal growth factor (3.4 x 10(-9) M) and insulin (10(-6) M) significantly (p less than 0.001) increased growth of both cell lines as determined by increases in deoxyribonucleic acid and protein. Bombesin, secretin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and somatostatin (all 10(-8) M) did not affect growth of either cell line. Neither cholecystokinin-8 nor [Thr4, Nle7] cholecystokinin-9 altered growth in concentrations from 10(-12)-10(-6) M. Anchorage-dependent clonogenic growth of both cell lines was also not altered by cholecystokinin-8. Cholecystokinin added to cultures was degraded by separate effects of serum and cells. Addition of cholecystokinin-8 to cultures every 8 h maintained cholecystokinin levels but did not alter cell growth. These data support roles for epidermal growth factor and insulin as growth factors for human pancreatic cancer cell lines.\r"

Histamine containing cells that did not stain with chromogranin A-antibodies were numerous throughout the stomach. Of the histamine immunoreactive cells in the oxyntic gland area 22% reacted with antibodies against chromogranin A. Histamine containing endocrine cells constituted 44% of the total number of endocrine cells in the oxyntic mucosa.

One hundred and thirty patients with active duodenal ulcer were randomly assigned to a double-blind therapy with ranitidine 300 mg at 8 am or the same dose at 10 pm for up to eight weeks. The antisecretory effects of these regimens were also assessed by 24 h intragastric pH monitoring in 18 of these patients. At four weeks ulcers had healed in 41/61 (67%) of patients taking the morning dose and in 47/63 (75%) of those receiving the nocturnal dose (95% CI for the difference -0.09 +0.25; p ns). At eight weeks, the corresponding healing rates were 82% and 85.5%, respectively (95% CI for the difference -0.11 +0.17; p ns). Both treatments were significantly superior to placebo in raising 24 h intragastric pH, although the effects of the morning dose were of shorter duration than those of the nocturnal dose. These findings suggest that suppression of nocturnal acidity is important but not essential to promote healing of duodenal ulcers; a prolonged period of acid inhibition during the day (as obtained with a single large morning dose of H2-blockers) may be equally effective.\r"

We have used continuous tritiated thymidine labelling and peptide immunocytochemistry on resin embedded semithin sections, a combination of techniques which have not been used before in the small intestine. Our data show that the turnover time for endocrine cells in the small intestine is 10 days, considerably longer than the four days suggested by previous studies, although for columnar and mucous cell lineages, turnover rates are similar to the published literature. In the stomach, the turnover time was very slow indeed (of the order of 45-60 days). These results show that endocrine cells do not share turnover characteristics with the other cell types and suggest that they constitute a kinetically distinct cell population independent of the other cell lineages. These data are not consistent with a common stem cell origin for gut endocrine cells.\r"

Seventy three patients were entered and 51 completed the trial: 28 patients in the colloidal bismuth subcitrate group and 23 in the placebo group. Overall there was no difference between the two groups in terms of symptom relief. Among patients with histological gastritis (n = 23), however, those who took colloidal bismuth subcitrate used fewer antacid tablets (for three of four fortnightly periods) and were more likely to become asymptomatic (eight of 11 v three of 12, p less than 0.05); their gastritis was more likely to resolve (five of 10 v 0 of 12, p less than 0.025) and their gastric biopsies more likely to become negative for Helicobacter like organisms (eight of nine v 0 of 12, p less than 0.001) when compared with patients taking placebo. In contrast, patients who did not have gastritis in their index biopsies (n = 28) fared similarly whether they received colloidal bismuth subcitrate or placebo. Our results indicate that the administration of colloidal bismuth subcitrate benefited non-ulcer dyspepsia patients with gastritis but had no effect on those without.\r"

  ".W": "The natural history of cranial dural arteriovenous malformations (AVM's) is highly variable. The authors present their clinical experience with 17 dural AVM's in adults, including 10 cases with an aggressive neurological course (strictly defined as hemorrhage or progressive focal neurological deficit other than ophthalmoplegia). Two of these 10 patients died prior to surgical intervention and a third was severely disabled by intracerebral hemorrhage. Six patients underwent surgical resection of their dural AVM, with preparatory embolization in two cases. One patient received embolization and radiation therapy without surgery. Six of the seven cases without an aggressive neurological course were treated conservatively, and the seventh patient underwent embolization of a cavernous sinus dural AVM because of worsening ophthalmoplegia. In order to clarify features associated with aggressive behavior, a comprehensive meta-analysis was performed on 360 additional dural AVM's reported in the literature with sufficiently detailed clinical and angiographic information. The location and angiographic features of 100 aggressive cases were compared to those of 277 benign cases. No location of dural AVM's was immune from aggressive neurological behavior; however, an aggressive neurological course was least often associated with cases involving the transverse-sigmoid sinuses and cavernous sinus and most often associated with cases at the tentorial incisura. Contralateral contribution to arterial supply and rate of shunting (high vs. low flow) did not correlate with aggressive neurological behavior as defined. Leptomeningeal venous drainage, variceal or aneurysmal venous dilations, and galenic drainage correlated significantly (p less than 0.05) with aggressive neurological presentation. The latter three angiographic features often coexisted in the same dural AVM. It is concluded that these features significantly increase the natural risk of dural AVM's, and warrant a more vigilant therapeutic strategy.\r"

  ".W": "In an effort to define more precisely and objectively computerized tomography (CT) brain scan evidence of glioma patient response to treatment, planimetric measurements of serial CT images of enhancing tumor areas were made using a digitizing tablet interfaced to a microcomputer for computing three-dimensional tumor volumes. The ability of a single investigator to measure a \"significant change\" in tumor volume was determined from that investigator's coefficient of variation (COV) for triplicate volume measurements (a total of 1701) on 155 scans of 27 patients with malignant gliomas. Planimetric volume data were compared with geometric computation of volumes based upon the product of the maximum diameter of enhancing tumor and the perpendicular diameter for each image made simultaneously with each planimetric measurement. The planimetric method COV was less than that for geometric computation, and the former method was employed for analysis of response to therapy in these same patients. Overall, for a tumor volume change to be significant (COV plus 2 standard errors of the means), the percentage change was determined to be 20%. However, the smaller the tumor volume being measured, the greater was the percentage change required in order to be significant. Thus, minimal measurable changes (%) were separately defined for large (greater than 14 cc), medium (8 to 14 cc), and small (less than 8 cc) tumor volumes. Tumor volumes computed from baseline (prior to investigational therapy) and from subsequent serial CT scans were compared, with response defined as a significant change. Responses to therapy based on significant volume changes were compared in each instance to the conventional visual viewbox comparison (\"Gestalt\") of serial scans. In 28% of scan comparisons, planimetric technique sensitivity permitted determination of significant enlargement or reduction in tumor size, while Gestalt comparison suggested no change. The use of quantitative tumor volume analysis of planimetric determinations of changes in tumor size during investigational therapy appears to permit recognition of either progression or regression of tumor size earlier than by Gestalt comparison in one-fourth of instances.\r"

  ".W": "Although blood velocity in the major intracranial vessels is readily measured with transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD), the interpretation of velocity changes is by no means straightforward. For example, a velocity increase can arise from either a local stenosis or a decrease in downstream resistance, and these mechanisms have contradictory implications for blood flow. To determine whether TCD pulsatility might distinguish these two mechanisms, Doppler ultrasonic readings were taken from an artificial vascular model under conditions of either stenosis or distal dilation. In addition, TCD studies of nine patients with unihemispheric arteriovenous malformations (AVM's) and 16 TCD studies of seven patients with unihemispheric aneurysmal vasospasm were reviewed, and pulsatilities of the AVM's (representing decreased resistance) were compared with those of the vasospastic vessels (representing stenosis). The average percentage drop in pulsatility in the vasodilated configuration of the model/percentage increase in velocity was 0.38 +/- 0.08 (+/- standard error of the mean), while that for stenosis was 0.20 +/- 0.01. Similar comparisons of the patient population yielded 0.67 +/- 0.16 for the AVM group and 0.26 +/- 0.04 for the vasospasm group. These differences were significant (p less than 0.05). The fall in pulsatility associated with a given increase in velocity is significantly greater when the velocity increase arises from diminished downstream resistance than from stenosis.\r"

  ".W": "Seventy-four HIV-infected homosexual males belonging to CDC groups IIB, III, and IVC2 were treated with increasing doses of zidovudine within the Multicentre Canadian AZT Trial. Following a 3 week observation period, consenting volunteers received 600 mg/day for 18 weeks, 900 mg/day for 9 weeks, and 1,200 mg/day for 9 weeks. This was followed by a 6 week washout period after which zidovudine was restarted at 1,200 mg/day for 18 weeks. Patients were followed for a total of 63 weeks. Every 3 weeks they underwent a full clinical and laboratory assessment. For the purpose of this analysis, subjects were divided according to the mean initial platelet value (greater than or equal to 150,000 or less than 150,000/L) into normals (n = 57) and thrombocytopenics (n = 12), respectively. Analysis of variance was used to compare the mean platelet values at each zidovudine dose. All comparisons were made against baseline values. Zidovudine increased platelet counts in normal and thrombocytopenic subjects. The magnitude of this effect varied depending on the baseline platelet count. Among normals, the platelet count increased from 241,000 +/- 45,000/L at baseline to 261,000 +/- 51,000/L (p less than 0.01). while receiving 600 mg/day of zidovudine. This effect was self-limited, reaching a peak by week 3. The platelet count decreased to baseline values despite increasing the dose of zidovudine to 900 or 1,200 mg/day. The platelet count further decreased to 218,000 +/- 43,000/L during the washout phase (washout vs. 1,200 mg, p less than 0.01).2+ not found to be dose related. The platelet count decreased to 101,000 +/- 34,000/L during the washout phase (washout vs. 1,200 mg/day, p less than 0.07).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients were randomized to receive either the active drug, 250 mg three times a day for 14 days, or placebo. In all eight patients receiving desciclovir, lesions of HL were either completely resolved or significantly reduced during the treatment period, whereas lesions in patients receiving placebo showed no change. The histological features of HL were significantly diminished in patients on desciclovir, and cytochemical, in situ hybridization, and ultrastructural studies showed that EBV infection was eliminated or dramatically reduced in the desciclovir group only. Four patients on desciclovir reported side effects, but none required withdrawal from the study. The reappearance of HL in all eight subjects on desciclovir within 1-4 months after therapy was discontinued suggests the need for additional study.\r"

The results are compared to those obtained by the Chou-Fasman analysis. Two alpha-helical sequences corresponding to the putative fusigenic domain and to the transmembrane domain of gp41 could be predicted, as well as a possible binding site between p17 and gp41. On the basis of the secondary structure predictions, a three-dimensional model of p17 was constructed. This model was found to represent a stable conformation by an analysis using an energy-minimization program. The model predicts that p17 is attached to the membrane only by the acylated N-terminus, in analogy with the N-terminus of the gag protein of other retroviruses and also with the src oncogene protein p60src. The intracellular C-terminal part of gp41 may act as a receptor by electrostatic interaction with p17.\r"

  ".W": "Ifenprodil and SL 82.0715 are noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists whose inhibitory actions are not explained by antagonistic effects at any of the three commonly recognized sites within the NMDA receptor complex (recognition, channel and modulatory glycine sites). We presently show that ifenprodil and SL 82.0715 antagonize the effects of NMDA via a selective action at the recently described polyamine modulatory site. Spermine and spermidine (0.5-100 microM) increase the binding of [3H]1-[1-(2-thienyl)cyclohexyl] piperidine to washed rat forebrain membranes in the presence of glutamate (10 microM). This effect is antagonized by ifenprodil and SL 82.0715 (0.1-10 microM) at concentrations which do not displace [3H]1-(2-thienyl)cyclohexyl] piperidine in the absence of added polyamine. Spermine and spermidine (up to 100 microM) do not significantly alter the binding of [3H]glycine but increase the binding of the NMDA recognition site ligand [3H](+/-)-3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid. Ifenprodil and SL 82.0715 (0.1-10 microM) antagonize this effect; ((+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5-10-imine maleate) or 7-chlorokynurenate (100 microM) are ineffective. In immature rat cerebellar slices, spermine and spermidine (10-1000 microM) potentiate the maximal effects of NMDA (80-160 microM) on cyclic GMP production. Spermine (100-1000 microM) reverses the antagonistic effects of ifenprodil (0.15-50 microM) but not of ((+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5-10-imine acid or kynurenate on the NMDA receptor-mediated increase in cyclic GMP levels. Ifenprodil (0.01-1 microM) potently but only partially antagonizes the depolarizing effects of NMDA (10 microM) on the immature rat spinal cord.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Each compound was administered both by microelectrophoresis and by i.v. injection. The racemic mixture and separated optical isomers of cyclazocine reduced selectively neuronal excitations evoked by N-methylaspartate (NMA), with only small and variable effects on responses to quisqualate and kainate. (+/-), (+)- and (-)-pentazocine also antagonized NMA actions, although they were less potent and somewhat less selective than the corresponding cyclazocine compounds in this respect. Overall, in both microelectrophoretic and i.v. tests, (+/-)-cyclazocine was about 7 times more potent an NMA antagonist than (+/-)-pentazocine. The (-)-isomers of both drugs were about 2 times more potent than the (+)-isomers, although the weak NMA antagonist effects of (+)-pentazocine were rather variable. Neither naloxone nor haloperidol affected the NMA antagonist activity of the drugs tested. Examination of the relative NMA antagonist potencies of the compounds suggests that the effect is mediated via an interaction with the phencyclidine receptor. The results are discussed with particular reference to those behavioral effects of cyclazocine and pentazocine which might reflect functional NMA antagonism in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of the study was to examine regional changes in sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) and baroreceptor function and arterial plasma catecholamines, arginine vasopressin (AVP) and plasma renin activity during morphine withdrawal in chloralose-anesthetized rats. Dependence was induced by s.c. morphine base pellets. Adrenal, renal and splanchnic SNA and SNA from the lumbar sympathetic chain were recorded before and after i.v. injections of naloxone. Baroreceptor function was examined with phenylephrine-induced increases in mean arterial pressure. In separate experiments, arterial plasma norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine, plasma renin activity and AVP were measured before and after naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. Naloxone administration elicited an increase in mean arterial pressure and heart rate. Although renal SNA was inhibited by approximately 50%, adrenal SNA and lumbar SNA increased by approximately 400 and 80%, respectively. Splanchnic SNA did not change significantly. The baroreceptor-mediated inhibition of adrenal SNA was facilitated while that for renal SNA was attenuated. The arterial plasma level of norepinephrine was doubled and epinephrine increased almost 20-fold. AVP increased about 15-fold, whereas plasma renin activity showed only a minor increase after naloxone. This study shows that a marked differentiation of the SNA response occurs during morphine withdrawal in rats, which suggests an interaction between opioid receptors and the control of regional sympathetic output. Furthermore, large amounts of AVP and epinephrine are released, which probably contribute to the cardiovascular changes seen in the withdrawal phase.\r"

Intracerebroventricular administration of morphine, [D-Ala2, N-MePhe4, Gly-ol]enkephalin (DAMGO), D-Pen2, D-Pen5] enkephalin (DPDPE) or U50,488H produced dose-related increases in net basal intestinal absorption. Intracerebroventricular DAMGO was approximately 2.6, 1278 and 2674 times more potent than morphine, DPDPE and U50,488H, respectively. The increase in net basal fluid absorption mediated by i.c.v. administration of all these compounds, except DPDPE, was antagonized in a dose-related manner by coadministration of i.c.v. naloxone, an opioid antagonist which did not produce any effects when given alone. Neither the increase in net basal fluid absorption produced by DPDPE nor the fluid transport effects produced by the other agonists tested was antagonized by the delta antagonist, N,N-diallyl-Tyr-alpha-aminoisobutyric acid [( Aib]-Aib-Phe-Leu-OH) and no effects were observed with this delta antagonist alone. Intracerebroventricular administration of beta-funaltrexamine (18.8 nmol, 4 hr before testing) blocked the i.c.v. effects of DAMGO, but not those of U50,488H. In contrast to the effects seen following i.c.v. administration of these agonists, no changes in net basal fluid transport were obtained by the i.p. route for DAMGO, DPDPE, [D-Ala2,D-Leu5]enkephalin, [D-Ala2, Met5]enkephalinamide or U50,488H; of the compounds tested, only morphine produced an increase in net basal fluid absorption after i.p. administration.

  ".W": "Renal responses to dopexamine were determined in anesthetized dogs in the absence and presence of dopamine receptor (DA1) and beta-2-adrenoceptor (beta-2) blockade. Dopexamine increased the rate of urine flow (V) and sodium excretion (UNaV) without affecting the fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) or the urinary (UKV) and fractional (FEK) excretions of potassium. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was increased and renal vascular resistance (RVR) reduced by the drug. With infusion of the DA1 antagonist, SCH 23390, dopexamine decreased V, UNaV, FENa, UKV and FEK. The agonist-induced increase in GFR and decrease in RVR were blocked. In the presence of the beta-2 antagonist, ICI 118551, dopexamine increased V, UNaV, FENa UKV and FEK; RVR was reduced, whereas GFR remained unchanged. SCH 23390, combined with ICI 118551, blocked the renal responses to dopexamine. During sample collection, dopexamine did not significantly affect mean arterial pressure in any group. In conclusion, the actions of dopexamine at DA1 and beta-2 receptors produce opposing changes in electrolyte excretion. Its combined actions at these receptors produces an increase in UNaV, attributed to an increase in glomerular filtration.\r"

Tissue slice viability was estimated as the ability of the brain slice to take up or release gamma-[3H]aminobutyric acid after high K+ stimulation. Results demonstrated stability of uptake/release up to 5 hr of incubation, suggesting tissue viability over this period. The estimated half-life of peptides based on the results obtained in our incubation protocol suggest that the peptides studied are metabolized at different rates in the individual brain regions tested. A good correlation exists between the high enzyme activity of neutral endopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.11) and the rapid degradation of des-enkephalin-gamma-endorphin and [cycloN alpha 6, C delata 11]beta-endorphin-[6-17] in caudate putamen. Proline substitution combined with lysine acetylation appears to improve resistance to enzymatic metabolism in caudate putamen and hypothalamus. However, cyclization of des-enkephalin-gamma-endorphin forming an amide bond between the alpha-NH2 of the N-terminal threonine and the gamma-COOH of glutamic acid did not improve peptide stability in any brain region tested. The present study has shown that the brain slice technique is a valid and unique approach to study neuropeptide metabolism in small, discrete regions of rat brain where peptides, peptidases and receptors are colocalized and that specific structural modifications can improve peptide stability.\r"

Alzheimer's disease-associated protein has three major ALZ-50-reactive subunits, including A-68. This assay utilizes ALZ-50 and a rabbit antibody raised against a highly ADAP-enriched brain protein fraction. The frequently observed cross-reactivity of ALZ-50 with normal brain components in direct immunoassays is minimized by this configuration. There were 27 normal controls, 28 neurologic disease controls, and 56 Alzheimer's disease cases. The normal control and neurologic disease control cases had essentially no detectable level of ADAP, while ADAP was clearly detected in 85.7% of the Alzheimer's disease cases. Clinical dementia, neuritic plaques, and old age per se are not correlated with increased ADAP levels. This biochemical assay of ADAP may prove to be helpful as an adjunct in the clinicopathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.\r"

In other cystic fibrosis newborn-screening studies, a sweat chloride test is generally performed only if an infant has a persistent IRT level above a selected cutoff value on both the initial and subsequent specimens. Neither the timing of the second specimen nor the value of the cutoff point for the second specimen has been comprehensively evaluated. In this randomized, controlled study, 145,024 infants were screened in the neonatal period for cystic fibrosis using the 99.8 percentile (180 ng/mL) as the neonatal cutoff point. A total of 129 infants had elevated neonatal IRT levels and had negative results on sweat tests (false-positive by IRT screening). A total of 54 children with cystic fibrosis were identified in the screened and comparison groups. Excluding patients with meconium ileus, 4 infants with cystic fibrosis had neonatal IRT values less than 180 ng/mL, and an additional 9 infants with cystic fibrosis had values decline to less than 180 ng/mL within the first 2 1/2 months of age. The IRT values of infants with and without cystic fibrosis overlapped considerably beyond 30 days of age. These findings suggest that further refinement of cystic fibrosis screening methodology will be necessary to achieve an acceptable sensitivity and specificity.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 228 low birth weight (less than 1750 g), mechanically ventilated infants with and without periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage were examined at 18 months corrected age to assess the relationship between cranial ultrasonographic findings and specific motor abnormalities. All infants were previously enrolled in a double-blind, randomized, prospective clinical trial of phenobarbital prophylaxis against periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage. Ultrasonographic abnormalities on the scans performed between 7 and 13 days of life were categorized as germinal matrix hemorrhage, lateral ventricular hemorrhage, parenchymal hemorrhage, ventriculomegaly, and any hemorrhage. Regardless of anatomical location, periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage was associated with an increased risk for developing motor abnormalities. Hypertonia and hyperreflexia/ankle clonus were most common. No abnormal motor findings distinguished unilateral from bilateral germinal matrix hemorrhage and lateral ventricular hemorrhage or between phenobarbital and placebo treatment. None of the 5 infants with parenchymal hemorrhage had spastic cerebral palsy. Ventriculomegaly was associated with a fivefold increase in risk for spastic cerebral palsy and delayed walking and a threefold increase for hypertonia and hyperreflexia/clonus. The results suggest that ventriculomegaly, observed even as early as the first week of life, might be a significant antecedent of later motor abnormalities among the survivors of periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage.\r"

Total respiratory resistance, the primary variable used to assess response, was measured by the forced oscillation method for a period of 6 hours from the start of inhalation. When comparisons were made between metaproterenol sulfate and saline, only 0.01 and 0.02 mL/kg showed significant bronchodilation (P less than .05) in percent change from baseline and area under the curve. However, no significant differences were seen between these doses. Moreover, the effect was sustained for 3 hours with both higher doses. Minimal side effects were observed. Metaproterenol sulfate 5% inhalant solution at a dose of 0.01 mL/kg seems to be optimal to elicit significant and sustained bronchodilatory response in preschool children with mild asthma.\r"

  ".W": "A multicenter, prospective randomized controlled trial was performed comparing the efficacy of a single intratracheal dose of modified bovine surfactant extract (Survanta, 100 mg/kg, Abbott Laboratory, North Chicago, IL) with air placebo in preventing respiratory distress syndrome. Infants were enrolled if they were estimated to be between 24 and 30 weeks' gestation, weighed between 750 and 1250 g, and were intubated and stabilized within 15 minutes after birth. A total of 160 infants were treated (79 with surfactant, 81 with air placebo) between 4 and 37 minutes after birth (median time 12 minutes). Of these, 5 infants were excluded from the final analysis. The 72-hour average values for the arterial-alveolar oxygen ratio, fraction of inspired oxygen, and mean airway pressure were calculated from the area under the curve of scheduled values measured throughout 72 hours. Clinical status was classified using five ordered categories (no supplemental oxygen or assisted ventilation, supplemental oxygen only, continuous positive airway pressure or assisted ventilation with intermittent mandatory ventilation less than or equal to 6 breaths/min, assisted ventilation with intermittent mandatory ventilation greater than 6 breaths/min, death). Chest radiographs at 24 hours were graded for severity of respiratory distress syndrome. Infants receiving Survanta had less severe radiographic changes at 24 hours of age and decreased average fraction of inspired oxygen (31% vs 42%, P = .002) compared with control infants. No differences were noted in the average arterial-alveolar oxygen ratio, mean airway pressure, or clinical status on days 7 and 28. A beneficial effect was noted in the incidence of pneumothorax (P = .057) and an increase was noted in the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (P = .052). No differences in incidence of patent ductus arteriosus, intraventricular hemorrhage, sepsis, or bronchopulmonary dysplasia were seen. According to results of a secondary analysis, there was improvement in the fraction of inspired oxygen and a greater number of survivors without bronchopulmonary dysplasia in the subgroup of infants weighing less than 1000 g who were treated with surfactant. It was concluded that a single dose of Survanta given shortly after birth resulted in decreased severity of chest radiographic findings 24 hours after treatment and improved oxygenation during 72 hours after treatment, but did not improve other acute measures of disease severity or clinical status later in the neonatal period. The group at highest risk for respiratory distress syndrome (infants with birth weights between 750 and 999 g) may benefit the most from preventive therapy.\r"

Relatively little is known, however, about the long-term consequences of surfactant treatment. In this report, the results of health and developmental assessment are described at 1 and 2 years of age of 32 survivors of an initial group of 41 infants enrolled in a randomized clinical trial of bovine surfactant therapy. The frequencies of abnormal findings were comparable in the two groups although there was a trend toward a greater frequency of allergic manifestations in the control group (6 of 16 (38%) vs 1 of 15 (7%), P = .08). Similarly, no differences were seen in the mental and motor scores of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development at either 1 or 2 years of age. This study and other recently published reports of follow-up studies of infants treated with surfactant provide encouraging evidence that major long-term side effects do not result from surfactant therapy.\r"

  ".W": "A pair of silkmoth chorion chromosomal genes, HcA.12-HcB.12, was inserted into a baculovirus transfer vector, pBmp2, derived from the nuclear polyhedrosis virus of Bombyx mori. This vector, which permits the insertion of foreign genetic material in the vicinity of a mutationally inactivated polyhedrin gene, was used to acquire the corresponding recombinant virus. Injection of mutant silkmoth pupae that lack all Hc chorion genes with the recombinant virus resulted in the infection of all internal organs including follicular tissue. Analysis of RNA from infected tissues has demonstrated that the two chorion genes present in the viral genome are correctly transcribed under the control of their own promoter in follicular cells, the tissue in which chorion genes are normally expressed. The chorion primary transcripts are also correctly processed in the infected follicular cells and yield mature mRNAs indistinguishable from authentic chorion mRNAs present in wild-type follicles. These results demonstrate that recombinant nuclear polyhedrosis viruses can be used as transducing vectors for introducing genetic material of host origin into the cells of the organism and that the transduced genes are transiently expressed in a tissue-specific manner under the control of their resident regulatory sequences. Thus we show the in vivo expression of cloned genes under cellular promoter control in an insect other than Drosophila melanogaster. The approach should be applicable to all insect systems that are subject to nuclear polyhedrosis virus infection.\r"

Though stable introduction of a BCL2 expression plasmid into Jurkat T cells was by itself insufficient, the combined transfer of BCL2 and MYC genes markedly enhanced the tumorigenicity of these cells in athymic mice. Moreover, a BCL2 antisense expression plasmid ablated tumor formation by Jurkat cells, providing further evidence that this oncogene contributes to the regulation of the in vivo growth of these human T lymphocytes. In addition to their influence on tumor formation, BCL2 sense and antisense expression plasmids increased and decreased, respectively, the in vitro survival of Jurkat T cells in serum-free medium. These observations extend to T cells the finding of synergy of BCL2 with MYC previously reported for B cells and provide evidence that BCL2 can regulate the growth of human T cells.\r"

Several pieces of evidence indicate that the low molecular weight free form is not a proteolytic degradation product of the complex-bound enzyme but that it preexists in vivo: (i) the endogenous free form differs in size from the active proteolytic fragment generated in vitro, (ii) conditions expected to increase or decrease the amount of proteolysis do not alter the ratio of the two forms of the enzyme, and (iii) the free form contains an NH2-terminal methionine residue. A model is presented that provides a rationale for the existence of two forms of arginyl-tRNA synthetase in cells. In this model the complexed enzyme supplies arginyl-tRNA for protein synthesis, whereas the free enzyme provides arginyl-tRNA for the NH2-terminal arginine modification of proteins by arginyl-tRNA:protein arginyltransferase. This latter process targets certain proteins for removal by the ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation pathway. The necessity for an additional pool of arginyl-tRNA for the modification reaction leads to the conclusion that the arginyl-tRNA destined for protein synthesis (and/or protein modification) is channeled and unavailable for other processes. Other evidence supporting channeling in protein synthesis is discussed.\r"

The chimeric gene was transfected by the calcium phosphate-precipitation procedure into primary mouse mammary epithelial cells prepared from pregnant mice. The transfection procedure had negligible effect on expression of the endogenous beta-casein gene. Expression of the beta-casein-CAT chimeric gene required the synergistic actions of insulin, hydrocortisone, and prolactin. Expression of the chimeric gene also depended on the appropriate substratum because the degree of hormonal induction of the chimeric gene was much higher in cells cultured on a reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel) than in cells cultured on either type I collagen gel or plastic. On the other hand, the expression of a simian virus 40-CAT chimeric gene in which the CAT gene was driven by the early promoter of the virus was not influenced by the hormonal milieu and occurred at the highest level in cells cultured on plastic. Additional transfection experiments with a series of beta-casein-CAT constructs suggested the existence of regulatory elements responsible for hormonal induction and negative regulatory elements.\r"

We describe here that the weight and the architecture of the thymus of diabetic rats is restored towards normal not only by insulin but also by insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) treatment. In contrast to insulin, this effect of IGF-I occurs despite persisting hyperglycemia and adrenal hyperplasia. We also investigated the in vivo effect of IGF-I on replication and differentiation of thymocytes from streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Thymocytes from diabetic rats incorporated less [3H]thymidine than did thymocytes from healthy rats. Insulin, as well as IGF-I treatment of diabetic rats increased [3H]thymidine incorporation by thymocytes. Flow cytometry of thymocytes labeled with monoclonal antibodies revealed a decreased expression of the Thy-1 antigen in diabetic rats compared with control rats. In addition, a major deficiency of thymocytes expressing simultaneously the W3/25 and the Ox8 antigens (corresponding to immature human CD4+/CD8+ thymocytes) was observed. These changes were restored towards normal by insulin as well as by IGF-I treatment. The antibody response to a T cell-dependent antigen (bovine serum albumin) was comparable in normal and diabetic rats. We conclude that IGF-I has important effects on the thymocyte number and the presence of CD4+/CD8+ immature cells in the thymus of diabetic rats despite persisting hyperglycemia. However, helper T-cell function for antibody production appears to be preserved even in the severely diabetic state.\r"

Each base change conferred a unique phenotype on the cells. Cells containing plasmid pKK3535 with G792 or T792 showed no difference in generation time in LB broth containing ampicillin, whereas cells with C792 exhibited a 20% increase in generation time in this medium. To study the effect on cell growth of a homogeneous population of mutant ribosomes, the mutations were cloned into the 16S rRNA gene on pKK3535 carrying a spectinomycin-resistance marker (thymine at position 1192), and the cells were grown with spectinomycin. Cells containing G792 or C792 showed 16% and 56% increases in generation time, respectively, and a concomitant decrease in 35S assimilation into proteins. Cells with T792 did not grow in spectinomycin-containing medium. Maxicell analyses indicated decreasing ability to form 70S ribosomes from 30S subunits containing guanine, cytosine, or uracil at position 792 in 16S rRNA. It appeared that C792-containing 30S ribosomes had lost the ability to bind initiation factor 3.\r"

Since tau and gamma are required as stoichiometric components of the replicative complex, a mechanism must exist for the cell to coordinate their synthesis and ensure that both subunits are present in an adequate quantity and ratio for assembly. We have proposed that gamma is produced by a translational frameshift event. In this report, we describe the use of dnaX-lacZ fusions in all three reading frames to demonstrate that gamma, the shorter product of dnaX, is generated by ribosomal frameshifting to the -1 reading frame of the mRNA within an oligo(A) sequence that is followed by a sequence predicted to form a stable secondary structure. Immediately after frameshifting a stop codon is encountered, leading to translational termination. Mutagenesis of the oligo(A) sequence abolishes frameshifting, and partial disruption of the predicted distal secondary structure severely impairs the efficiency. Comparison of the expression of lacZ fused to dnaX distal to the site of frameshifting in the -1 and 0 reading frames indicates that the efficiency of frameshifting is approximately 40%.\r"

Our results show that resting T cells express high levels of ETS1 mRNA and protein, while expression of ETS2 is undetectable. Upon T-cell activation, ETS2 mRNA and proteins are induced, while ETS1 gene expression decreases to very low levels. Late after stimulation, ETS1 mRNA is reinduced and maintained at a high level, while ETS2 gene expression decreases to undetectable levels. Therefore, it appears that in human T cells, ETS2 gene products are associated with cellular activation and proliferation, while ETS1 gene products are preferentially expressed in a quiescent state.\r"

  ".U": "90251636\r", 
  ".W": "Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) is a potent growth inhibitor for many cell types, including most epithelial cells. However, the mechanism of growth inhibition is unknown. In skin keratinocytes, TGF-beta 1 has been shown to inhibit growth and to rapidly reduce c-myc expression. It has been demonstrated that protein synthesis is required for TGF-beta 1 regulation of c-myc in keratinocytes. Here we present evidence that treatment of mouse BALB/MK keratinocyte cells with either antisense c-myc oligonucleotides or TGF-beta 1 inhibited cell entry into S phase. These results suggest that TGF-beta inhibition of c-myc expression may be essential for growth inhibition by TGF-beta 1. The block in c-myc expression by TGF-beta 1 occurred at the level of transcriptional initiation. Studies with a series of 5' deletion c-myc/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs indicated that a cis regulatory element(s), which resides between positions -100 and +71 relative to P1 transcription start site, is responsible for the TGF-beta 1 responsiveness. Based on these data, it is proposed that the mechanism of TGF-beta 1 growth inhibition involves synthesis or modification of a protein that may interact with a specific element(s) in the 5' regulatory region of the c-myc gene, resulting in inhibition of transcriptional initiation.\r"

  ".W": "Analysis of the expression of the c-myc protooncogene has been carried out in the forelimb regenerate of the Xenopus laevis froglet. Northern blot hybridization analysis revealed the presence of a 2.5-kilobase c-myc transcript in the regenerate forelimb at a level at least 7-fold more than the one found in nonregenerating forelimbs or stumps of regenerating forelimbs. In situ hybridization analyses confirmed the relative abundance of c-myc RNA in the regenerate forelimb and provided evidence of spatial localization of high levels of c-myc RNA in specific cell layers. The deepest layers of the wound epithelium of epidermal origin showed a strong signal, whereas virtually no c-myc RNA was detected in the outermost layers. Labeling was also observed in mesenchymal cells of the blastema where it was relatively evenly distributed. This pattern of c-myc RNA in the regenerate might indicate that the expression of c-myc plays a role in the regulation of the continued proliferation of specific cells of the regenerate, whereas repression of this gene in the epidermis correlates with terminal differentiation of keratinocytes.\r"

  ".U": "90251647\r", 
  ".W": "Three different cDNAs and a gene encoding human skin mast cell tryptase have been cloned and sequenced in their entirety. The deduced amino acid sequences reveal a 30-amino acid prepropeptide followed by a 245-amino acid catalytic domain. The C-terminal undecapeptide of the human preprosequence is identical in dog tryptase and appears to be part of a prosequence unique among serine proteases. The differences among the three human tryptase catalytic domains include the loss of a consensus N-glycosylation site in one cDNA, which may explain some of the heterogeneity in size and susceptibility to deglycosylation seen in tryptase preparations. All three tryptase cDNAs are distinct from a recently reported cDNA obtained from a human lung mast cell library. A skin tryptase cDNA was used to isolate a human tryptase gene, the exons of which match one of the skin-derived cDNAs. The organization of the approximately 1.8-kilobase-pair tryptase gene is unique and is not closely related to that of any other mast cell or leukocyte serine protease. The 5' regulatory regions of the gene share features with those of other serine proteases, including mast cell chymase, but are unusual in being separated from the protein-coding sequence by an intron. High-stringency hybridization of a human genomic DNA blot with a fragment of the tryptase gene confirms the presence of multiple tryptase genes. These findings provide genetic evidence that human mast cell tryptases are the products of a multigene family.\r"

EGF stimulated a time-dependent increase in EGF receptor-associated PI kinase activity measured in EGF receptor immunoprecipitates. Activation was detected 15 min after the addition of EGF, and it peaked between 1 and 2 hr. Activation of PI kinase was detected with EGF concentrations as low as 10 pM and maximal stimulation occurred at approximately 1 nM. Analysis of deacylated PI phosphate products, and inhibition of the PI kinase activity by nonionic detergent, indicated that the PI kinase described here was type I or PI 3' kinase. These results demonstrate the regulation of a type I PI kinase by EGF and suggest a potential role in the EGF receptor signal transduction pathway.\r"

We demonstrate that this allosterically modulated regulatory protein is sensitive to HgCl2 concentrations of 1.0 +/- 0.3 x 10(-8) M in the presence of 1.0 x 10(-3) M dithiothreitol for half-maximal induction of transcription of the mer promoter by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase in vitro. Transcription mediated by MerR increases from 10% to 90% of maximum in response to a 7-fold change in concentration of HgCl2, consistent with a threshold phenomenon known as ultrasensitivity. In addition, MerR exhibits a high degree of selectivity. Cd(II), Zn(II), Ag(I), Au(I), and Au(III) have been found to partially stimulate transcription in the presence of MerR, but concentrations at least two to three orders of magnitude greater than for Hg(II) are required. The molecular basis of the ultrasensitivity and selectivity phenomena are postulated to arise from the unusual topology of the transcription complex and a rare trigonal mercuric ion coordination environment, respectively. This mercuric ion-induced switch is to our knowledge the only known example of ultrasensitivity in a signal-responsive transcription mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "The formation of beta-amyloid in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer disease requires the proteolytic cleavage of a membrane-associated precursor protein. The proteases that may be involved in this process have not yet been identified. Cathepsins are normally intracellular proteolytic enzymes associated with lysosomes; however, when sections from Alzheimer brains were stained by antisera to cathepsin D and cathepsin B, high levels of immunoreactivity were also detected in senile plaques. Extracellular sites of cathepsin immunoreactivity were not seen in control brains from age-matched individuals without neurologic disease or from patients with Huntington disease or Parkinson disease. In situ enzyme histochemistry of cathepsin D and cathepsin B on sections of neocortex using synthetic peptides and protein substrates showed that senile plaques contained the highest levels of enzymatically active cathepsin. At the ultrastructural level, cathepsin immunoreactivity in senile plaques was localized principally to lysosomal dense bodies and lipofuscin granules, which were extracellular. Similar structures were abundant in degenerating neurons of Alzheimer neocortex, and cathepsin-laden neuronal perikarya in various stages of disintegration could be seen within some senile plaques. The high levels of enzymatically competent lysosomal proteases abnormally localized in senile plaques represent evidence for candidate enzymes that may mediate the proteolytic formation of amyloid. We propose that amyloid precursor protein within senile plaques is processed by lysosomal proteases principally derived from degenerating neurons. Escape of cathepsins from the stringently regulated intracellular milieu provides a basis for an abnormal sequence of proteolytic cleavages of accumulating amyloid precursor protein.\r"

Analysis of the nucleotide sequence reveals that the cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 508 residues and 56,918-Da molecular mass. Identify of the cDNA clone isolated as mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase was confirmed by the following criteria: (i) Amino acid residues are 65% homologous with hamster cytosolic HMG-CoA synthase. (ii) A 19-amino acid sequence probably corresponding to the catalytic site is highly homologous (90%) to that reported for chicken liver mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase. (iii) The expression product of the cDNA in Escherichia coli has HMG-CoA synthase activity. (iv) The protein includes a sequence of 37 amino acid residues at the N terminus that is not present in the cytosolic enzyme. The predominantly basic, hydrophobic, and hydroxylated nature of the residues of this sequence suggests that it is a leader peptide to target HMG-CoA synthase inside mitochondria. These data plus the hybridization pattern in genomic Southern blot analysis, the different transcript size (2.0 kilobases versus 3.4 kilobases for the cytosolic enzyme), and the different expression pattern shown in RNA blot experiments suggest the presence of two HMG-CoA synthase genes, one for the cytosolic and another for the mitochondrial enzyme.\r"

The direct consequences of human immunodeficiency virus infection on macrophage function are unknown. To address this question we infected normal human macrophages in vitro with a monocytotropic strain of human immunodeficiency virus and performed assays to quantify their extra- and intracellular killing ability. Human immunodeficiency virus-infected macrophages were significantly less effective than control cells in mediating antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity against leukemic cell targets and intracellular killing of Candida pseudotropicalis. The functional defects were profound, related temporarily to active virus production by the macrophages, and could not be overcome by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Treatment of macrophages with 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) 6 days after infection caused a marked decrease in virus production and prevented development of the intracellular killing functional defect. The results suggest that early antiviral therapy may be useful in preventing or mitigating some virus-induced mononuclear phagocyte dysfunction.\r"

Chem. 264, 20831-20834], a highly polarized syncytium that is embryologically derived from skeletal muscle and displays functionally distinct plasma membrane domains on its innervated and noninnervated faces. In the present study, we investigated the subcellular distribution of dystrophin in the adult electrocyte from Torpedo marmorata and the evolution of its distribution during embryogenesis. Immunofluorescence experiments performed on adult electrocytes with a polyclonal antibody directed against chicken dystrophin revealed that dystrophin immunoreactivity codistributed exclusively with the acetylcholine receptor along the innervated membrane. At the ultrastructural level, dystrophin immunoreactivity appears confined to the face of the subsynaptic membrane exposed to the cytoplasm. In developing electrocytes (45-mm embryo), dystrophin is already detectable at the acetylcholine receptor-rich ventral pole of the cells before the entry of the electromotor axons. Furthermore, we show that dystrophin represents a major component of purified membrane fractions rich in acetylcholine receptor. A putative role of dystrophin in the organization and stabilization of the subsynaptic membrane domain of the electrocyte is discussed.\r"

When sections of injured brain are double-stained with antibodies directed against MAP-2 and glial fibrillary protein, all of the reactive astrocytes are found to contain MAP-2. The high levels of this protein appear to represent a permanent change in reactive astrocytes. In parallel quantitative studies, an elevated level of MAP-2 in the injured brain is confirmed by an immunoblot analysis of injured and normal white matter.

Glucocorticoid hormone strongly activates transcription from episomes and induces the disruption of a single nucleosome in an array of phased nucleosomes on the MMTV promoter. Sodium butyrate inhibits the glucocorticoid hormone-dependent development of a nuclease-hypersensitive site that is due to the displacement of this nucleosome, and inhibits induction of RNA transcripts from episomes. Saturation binding studies show that butyrate treatment does not significantly affect the amount or the hormone-binding affinity of the glucocorticoid receptor. In a transient transfection assay, glucocorticoid hormone can activate transcription from a MMTV long terminal repeat-driven luciferase gene construct equivalently in untreated and butyrate-treated cells, indicating that the soluble factors necessary for transactivation of the MMTV promoter are unaffected by butyrate. The differential effect of butyrate on the induction of stable chromatin templates and transiently expressed plasmids suggests that butyrate prevents nucleosome displacement and represses transcription by inducing a modification of chromatin.\r"

  ".W": "The alternative complement pathway is capable of discriminating human cells and tissues from a wide variety of potential pathogens. It has been recently demonstrated that attachment of complement component C3b to activator-derived molecules (e.g., small polysaccharides) restricts inactivation of C3b by factors H and I in a manner similar to activator surfaces. It is now shown that restriction is reversed by certain soluble polyanions (e.g., sialoglycopeptides, heparin, or dextran sulfate) that mimic the effects of sialic acid and glycosaminoglycans on human cells and tissues. Fluid-phase polyanions enhanced binding of factor H to C3b attached to activating particles, indicating that the effect resulted from increased affinity between C3b and factor H. The enhancement was specific for activator-bound C3b since no enhancement was observed on nonactivating particles. While several polyanions could cause this effect, some polyanions could not, indicating specificity. The active polyanions also inhibited lysis of cells via the alternative pathway. The binding site for sialic acid appears to reside on factor H, since factor H bound to heparin-agarose and to sialic acid-bearing fetuinagarose, whereas C3b bound to neither under the same conditions. These observations suggest that occupation of a specific site on factor H by polyanions induces an increase in the C3b-H affinity, resulting in discrimination of host cells and tissues from alternative pathway-activating foreign cells.\r"

The major antigens recognized by the antibodies are the E2 components of the 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes, all of which possess covalently attached lipoic acid cofactors. A bacterial etiology has been proposed for the disease, and patients' antibodies are known to recognize the E2 subunits (E2p) of both mammalian and bacterial pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes. Immunoblotting and ELISA inhibition techniques using extracts of Escherichia coli deletion strains, genetically restructured E2 polypeptides, and isolated lipoyl domains demonstrate that (i) the E2o subunit of the E. coli 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex is recognized by patients' antibodies; (ii) the main immunogenic region of E2p lies within the lipoly domains; (iii) the presence of a lipoly residue within the domain is crucial for effective recognition by the antibodies; and (iv) octanoylated E2p, octanoylated E2o, and octanoylated lipoyl domain, produced by a mutant deficient in lipoate biosynthesis, are recognized by patients' antibodies but not as effectively as their lipoylated counterparts. These findings indicate that antibodies in PBC patients' sera bind to a unique peptide-cofactor conformation within the lipoyl domains of the E2 polypeptides and that this epitope is partially mimicked by substituting the lipoyl cofactor with an octanoyl group.\r"

  ".W": "The current spread of multidrug-resistant malaria demands rapid vaccine development against the major pathogen Plasmodium falciparum. The high quantities of protein required for a worldwide vaccination campaign select recombinant DNA technology as a practical approach for large-scale antigen production. We describe the vaccination of Aotus monkeys with two recombinant blood-stage antigens (recombinant p41 and 190N) that were considered as vaccine candidates because parasite-derived antigen preparations could protect susceptible monkeys from an otherwise lethal malaria infection. In contrast to the natural antigen, recombinant p41 protein (P. falciparum aldolase) could not protect monkeys, although all animals seroconverted. 190N antigen, a recombinant protein containing conserved sequences of the major merozoite surface antigen p190, protected two of five monkeys from critical levels of infection with the highly virulent FVO isolate of P. falciparum. However, the B- and T-cell responses to 190N antigen were similar in protected and unprotected animals so that other unknown factors may contribute to protection. Higher purity or lack of protective epitopes or different structure of protective epitopes in the recombinant proteins might explain the better performance of parasite-derived antigens in vaccination trials. The partial protection obtained with 190N antigen suggests that this molecule could contribute to a vaccine mixture against P. falciparum.\r"

Of 133 episodes involving native mitral and/or aortic valves, brain ischemia occurred in 19%, brain hemorrhage in 7%, and non-central nervous system emboli in 11%; vegetations were identified in 56% of 113 adequate echocardiograms and did not correlate with risk of embolism. In native-valve endocarditis, most (74%) ischemic strokes had occurred by the time of presentation and an additional 13% occurred less than or equal to 48 hours after diagnosis; the incidence of brain ischemia was 13% on presentation, 3% during the first 48 hours of hospitalization, and 2%-5% during the remainder of the acute course. Stroke recurred at a rate of 0.5%/day, often heralding relapse/uncontrolled infection. Only 9% of ischemic infarcts were large (all in patients with Staphylococcus aureus infection), while 8% were small and subcortical. Brain hemorrhage occurred primarily at the time of presentation, particularly in intravenous drug abusers, and was associated with uncontrolled S. aureus infection with pyogenic arteritis. Ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke continue to be frequent and important in patients with infective endocarditis and are clustered during uncontrolled infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Reported regular alcohol consumption was compared with the presence and severity of internal carotid artery disease as assessed by duplex scanning with spectral analysis of the Doppler signal and real-time B-mode imaging at the level of the carotid bifurcation. We found an inverse linear relation between light-to-moderate alcohol intake (less than or equal to 4 standard drinks/day) and severity of internal carotid artery stenosis. No conclusion could be drawn for heavier drinkers because there were too few. A logistic regression model showed that hypertension, cigarette smoking, and age in men and diabetes mellitus and cigarette smoking in women strongly counterbalanced the potential benefit of alcohol consumption. Although regular alcohol drinking cannot be advocated on the basis of our findings, light-to-moderate consumption of alcohol is the first factor to be inversely associated with extracranial carotid atherosclerosis in symptomatic patients with cerebrovascular disease.\r"

Among the risk factors investigated, hypertension alone, ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and smoking failed to explain the racial difference. Although carotid stenosis of greater than or equal to 40% correlated significantly with age in both races (p = 0.001 in whites and p = 0.005 in blacks), blacks had significantly less carotid stenosis of any degree even when age was taken into account. Multivariate analysis showed that race is a significant and independent risk factor for carotid stenosis (p less than 0.0001). Hypertension interacting with race was also significant. Our results require verification in population-based studies. Carotid duplex ultrasonography offers a noninvasive method for carrying out such studies.\r"

  ".W": "The risk of cancer (incidence) prior to age 20 years has been determined for children born to atomic bomb survivors and to a suitable comparison group. Tumor ascertainment was through death certificates and the tumor registries maintained in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The rationale for the study stemmed from the evidence that a significant proportion of such childhood tumors as retinoblastoma and Wilms tumor arise on the basis of a mutant gene inherited from one parent plus a second somatic cell mutation involving the allele of this gene. Gonadal radiation doses were calculated by the recently established DS86 system, supplemented by an ad hoc system for those children for one or both of whose parents a DS86 dose could not be computed but for whom an ad hoc dose could be developed on the basis of the available information. The total data set consisted of (1) a cohort of 31,150 live-born children one or both of whose parents received greater than 0.01 Sv of radiation at the time of the atomic bombings (average conjoint gonad exposure 0.43 Sv) and (2) two suitable comparison groups totaling 41,066 children. Altogether, 43 malignant tumors were ascertained in the children of exposed parents, and 49 malignant tumors were ascertained in the two control groups. A multiple linear regression analysis revealed no increase in malignancy in the children of exposed parents. However, examination of the data suggested that only 3.0-5.0% of the tumors of childhood that were observed in the comparison groups are associated with an inherited genetic predisposition that would be expected to exhibit an altered frequency if the parental mutation rate were increased. There is thus far no confirmation of the positive findings that Nomura found in a mouse system.\r"

  ".W": "The complete 14-kb cDNA for the gene causing the X-linked recessive muscular dystrophy (MD) type Duchenne (DMD) and Becker (BMD) has recently been cloned and made available for deletion/duplication screening in patients. It detects 65 exon-containing nonpolymorphic HindIII fragments spread over a gene locus of about 2,000 kb. When the entire DMD cDNA is used, deletions/duplications can be found in about 65%-70% of affected patients, permitting direct carrier detection by densitometric scanning. But in cases where no deletion/duplication is detectable, RFLP analysis, specially favored within the gene, will be the method for carrier-status determination. Clones 9 and 10-1.2-kb and 0.7-kb fragments, respectively, of the 14-kb DMD cDNA--have been hybridized with human genomic DNA digested by nine different restriction enzymes. Five RFLPs, involving Asp700, PvuII, XbaI, and EcoRV sites, were detected, and Mendelian inheritance could be demonstrated. Since clones 9 and 10 are localized telomeric to the mutation-hot-spot region, their polymorphisms are thought to be very helpful as flanking markers for indirect carrier detection in families with a family history of DMD/BMD. Moreover, these RFLPs can be used for direct carrier detection or exclusion in families with patients showing a deletion/duplication in the region of p9 or p10.\r"

Efficient mechanisms of antibacterial defense are present in the respiratory tract that eliminate microbes before their presence or multiplication leads to disease in the majority of instances. Resident pulmonary defenses consist of aerodynamic defenses, the mucociliary apparatus, alveolar macrophages, complement, and surfactant. These resident defenses can be augmented by the development of an inflammatory response or the development of specific immunity. Significant species variability exists in the efficiency and mechanisms of clearance for oropharyngeal organisms. Streptococci are cleared promptly, Branhamella catarrhalis is cleared slowly, whereas non-typable Haemophilus influenzae multiply before being cleared. A dual phagocytic system of alveolar macrophages and recruited polymorphonuclear leukocytes is required for clearance of most oropharyngeal microbes. Systemic immunization can significantly enhance clearance of non-typable H. influenzae, suggesting immunoprophylaxis might be possible for this organism.\r"

A total of 100 patients were randomized, 43 to undergo amnioinfusion and 57 to be in a control group. Patients undergoing amnioinfusion had a significantly decreased incidence of postpartum endometritis (2.4% vs 19%, p = 0.01) and a lower incidence of cesarean delivery that was due to fetal distress in labor (4.7% vs 16%, p = 0.07). The use of amnioinfusion also made a significant contribution to the four-quadrant ultrasonographic estimate of amniotic fluid volume (14.7 vs 9.8 cm, p less than 0.001). All other maternal and neonatal outcome parameters were similar between the two groups. We conclude that saline solution amnioinfusion in labor may be a beneficial procedure but that further studies are needed.\r"

To investigate this process, placentas from 71 patients with gestational ages between 26 and 42 weeks were examined by means of a peroxidase-antiperoxidase immunostaining technique specific for IgG. Linear regression revealed a significant increase in antibody with advancing gestational age (r = 0.36, p less than 0.01). In addition, placentas from patients in spontaneous term labor revealed a significantly higher antibody level when compared with those of patients at term delivered electively before the onset of labor (mean +/- SEM 2.6 +/- 0.2 vs 1.7 +/- 0.3, p less than 0.02). Patients in premature labor failed to demonstrate this increase in antibody staining. One possible explanation for these findings is an enhanced recognition of the fetal trophoblastic tissue by the maternal immune system at term. It also suggests immunologic factors may play an important role in the initiation of normal labor.\r"

We sought to measure this phenomenon by devising a simple method that would allow us to identify variables that influence fetomaternal transfusion. We investigated patients undergoing transcervical-chorionic villus sampling (n = 15) and transabdominal-chorionic villus sampling (n = 15), restricting the sample to subjects who required only a single catheter passage or needle insertion to obtain villi. Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein was measured before and after the procedure along with alpha-fetoprotein concentration of the transport medium into which the villi had been aspirated. We first confirmed that the change in maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels after chorionic villus sampling, an indirect measure of fetomaternal transfusion, was indeed correlated with the alpha-fetoprotein concentration of transport medium into which the villi were aspirated (p = 0.0350). Fetomaternal transfusion next proved to be correlated with the amount of villi obtained (p = 0.0279). However, when adjusted for the amount of villi obtained, no significant difference was observed between transcervical and transabdominal-chorionic villus sampling with respect to the change in maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels after chorionic villus sampling (p = 0.8512). These data suggest that the magnitude of fetomaternal transfusion depends on the amount of villi obtained but not on the chorionic villus sampling method used.\r"

In each instance the sample was the umbilical vein. The systolic/diastolic ratio was measured in a midsection of the umbilical cord. Analyses used stepwise, multiple linear regression. The mean +/- SEM gestation was 29 +/- 0.4 weeks; 72% of fetuses were greater than or equal to 25 weeks and were considered potentially viable. There was no relationship between the umbilical artery systolic/diastolic ratio and pH, PCO2, or PO2 in fetuses either less than 25 weeks' gestation or greater than or equal to 25 weeks' gestation but with systolic/diastolic ratios greater than or equal to the 95th percentile for control fetuses at 25 weeks' gestation with normal blood gas values (3.5). In fetuses greater than or equal to 25 weeks' gestation with systolic/diastolic ratios that exceeded 3.5 (n = 37), there was a strong relationship between the systolic/diastolic ratio and the umbilical venous PO2 (r = -0.68, p less than 0.0001), which was independent of gestational age. Each fetus with repetitively absent-reversed umbilical artery diastolic blood flow and a heart rate greater than 90 beats/min (n = 6) had blood gas measurements consistent with hypoxia and acidosis. This investigation suggests that factors that lead to an increase in the umbilical artery systolic/diastolic ratio are associated with a progressive impairment of placental gas exchange and that by the time diastolic flow is lost, hypoxemia is present.\r"

  ".W": "Necrosis of the cerebral white matter may be identified in living infants with echoencephalography. Echoencephalographic studies were performed in 89 twins and 12 triplets at less than 36 weeks of gestation to determine the incidence and complications associated with antenatal necrosis of the cerebral white matter. Antenatal necrosis of the cerebral white matter was identified when brain atrophy or cavities in the white matter were present by day 3 of life. Fourteen infants (13.8%) were considered to have antenatal necrosis of the cerebral white matter. The incidence of antenatal necrosis of the cerebral white matter was higher in monochorionic than in dichorionic infants (30% vs 3.3%; p less than 0.001). Univariate analysis showed that antenatal necrosis of the cerebral white matter was significantly associated with polyhydramnios, intrauterine fetal death of the cotwin, hydrops, multiple placental vascular connections, and placental artery-to-artery, vein-to-vein, and artery-to-vein anastomosis. Logistic regression analysis showed that antenatal necrosis of the cerebral white matter was predicted by the presence of either artery-to-artery or vein-to-vein anastomosis and by intrauterine fetal death of a cotwin. Vein-to-vein anastomosis had the strongest association, because 89% of seven infants with vein-to-vein anastomosis demonstrated antenatal necrosis of the cerebral white matter (p = 0.003). Monochorionic multiple gestations frequently are complicated by antenatal necrosis of the cerebral white matter. Multiple vascular connections with vein-to-vein anastomosis appear as the most important associated factor for antenatal necrosis of the cerebral white matter in this population.\r"

We studied 40 fetuses referred for ultrasonography, examination of fetal urine, and possible therapy. We retrospectively assigned fetuses to a good prognosis group if fetal urine was hypotonic (sodium less than 100 mEq/L, chloride less than 90 mEq/L, osmolarity less than 210 mOsm/L) and there was no ultrasonographic evidence of dysplasia; we assigned fetuses to a poor prognosis group if even one criterion was abnormal. Survival was greater in the good prognosis group than in the poor prognosis group (81% vs 12.5%; 87% vs 30%, excluding abortions) (p less than 0.005). We then attempted to assess the efficacy of prenatal urinary decompression by comparing outcome within the good and poor prognosis groups. Survival with intervention was greater in both the good prognosis group and the poor prognosis group (89% vs 70% and 30% vs 0%). In 6 of the 8 survivors in the good prognosis group, severe oligohydramnios was reversed by decompression. We conclude the fetal urine electrolyte levels and ultrasonographic appear helpful in predicting residual fetal renal function and neonatal outcome and that prenatal decompression may prevent the development of fatal pulmonary hypoplasia.\r"

  ".W": "The potential utility of screening for femur length shortening in prenatal detection of Down syndrome (trisomy 21) was evaluated by comparing 49 consecutive fetuses with Down syndrome with 572 chromosomally normal fetuses before genetic amniocentesis. Ratios of measured femur length/predicted femur length and biparietal diameter/femur length were calculated for each fetus. The predicted femur length was calculated from a regression equation relating the biparietal diameter and femur length derived from a sample control group. With this normal regression equation, 7 of 49 (14.3%) fetuses with Down syndrome had short femur lengths (measured femur length/predicted femur length ratio of less than or equal to 0.91) compared with 35 of 572 (6.1%) fetuses with a normal karyotype (p less than 0.05). However, the maximum positive predictive value for identification of Down syndrome based on short femur lengths was only 0.93% for a high-risk population (prevalence of Down syndrome, 1:250) and 0.33% for a low-risk population (prevalence of Down syndrome, 1:700). We conclude that ultrasonographic screening of short femur length is less effective for prenatal detection of Down syndrome than initially suggested.\r"

Complete moles are androgenetically derived, are characterized by a predominance of the 46,XX karyotype, and are associated with a significantly higher incidence of malignant sequelae than are partial moles. A subset of complete moles resulting from dispermy are heterozygous (46,XY) and appear to be associated with the greatest risk of malignancy. Free subunits of human chorionic gonadotropin, beta core fragments, and acidic variants of human chorionic gonadotropin can now be readily measured by radioimmunoassays, fluoroimmunoassays, or isoelectric focusing techniques. Determination of these markers can be of value not only in monitoring response to therapy, but also as prognostic indicators. A subgroup of patients, traditionally classified as \"high risk\" or poor prognosis, who show poor responses to conventional combination chemotherapy have recently been designated as \"ultra-high-risk\" patients. They require more complex chemotherapy and possibly surgery and radiotherapy to achieve remission. The development of chemotherapy over the past decade, including the introduction of etoposide and cisplatin into current protocols and the treatment of patients with advanced gestational trophoblastic disease, are considered in this review.\r"

Hybridization of polyadenylic-(+)ribonucleic acid extracted from amnion, chorion, decidua parietalis, basal plate, and placental trophoblast with a radiolabeled 48 mer oligonucleotide and a 540 base pair complementary deoxyribonucleic acid probe to human placental lactogen showed the placental trophoblast to be the major source of human placental lactogen and the extravillous chorion and basal plate to be additional minor sources.\r"

The study examines the extent of diversity between individual isolates and the differences in the frequency of certain variants of the markers between the 3 countries.

  ".W": "The authors attempted to simultaneously measure cardiac output by thermodilution (COtd), thoracic bioimpedance (CObi), and suprasternal Doppler ultrasound (COdopp) in 68 patients. Subgroups separately compared included patients whose lungs were mechanically ventilated, patients undergoing cardiac surgery, aortic surgery, patients with dysrhythmias, and patients with sepsis. The authors also studied the value of the ventricular ejection time (VET) in evaluating the agreement of CObi and COdopp with COtd. Simultaneous CObi and COtd were available in a total of 56 patients (416 data sets) with an overall correlation coefficient r = 0.61, regression slope (m) of 0.52, intercept (y) of 2.46, and mean (CObi-COtd) difference (bias) of -0.67 +/- 1.72 (SD) l/min. Simultaneous COdopp and COtd were available in 59 patients (446 data sets) with an overall r = 0.51, m of 0.53, y of 2.05, and bias of -0.79 +/- 1.95 l/min. CObi agreed most closely with COtd in patients whose lungs were mechanically ventilated, who had not undergone cardiac or aortic surgery, and with VET difference less than 40 ms (16 patients, 99 data sets; r = 0.74; m = 0.97; y = 0.15; bias = -0.02 +/- 1.53 l/min). COdopp agreed most closely with COtd in patients whose lungs were mechanically ventilated, who had not undergone cardiac or aortic surgery, and in sinus rhythm with VET difference less than 40 ms (10 patients, 45 data sets; r = 0.82; m = 0.98; y = -0.07; bias = -0.82 +/-1.03 l/min). VET by radial artery can help evaluate the reliability of CObi and COdopp.\r"

  ".W": "Ninety women undergoing gynecologic laparoscopy were randomly given clonidine 3 or 4.5 micrograms/kg or saline intramuscularly 45-60 min prior to induction of anesthesia. Anesthesia was induced with thiopental 3.5 mg/kg and maintained with 0.3% end-tidal isoflurane in nitrous oxide and oxygen. The laparoscopy did not begin sooner than 20 min after tracheal intubation. Arterial blood pressure and heart rate were monitored with an automatic oscillometer. When compared with the baseline values, clonidine 4.5 micrograms/kg significantly (P less than 0.001) decreased the mean arterial pressure (MAP) measured before induction of anesthesia. In all three groups, blood pressure and heart rate increased after tracheal intubation and after beginning of laparoscopy (P less than 0.001), but the increments were significantly greater in the control group than in the study groups. During anesthesia alone without surgical stimulation, and again in the recovery room, MAP and heart rate were lower in the study groups than in the control group. Plasma beta-endorphin immunoreactivity (ir beta-E) was measured for ten control-group women and ten women receiving clonidine 4.5 micrograms/kg before premedication, before and after induction of anesthesia, during laparoscopy, and 1 h after the procedure. The plasma ir beta-E increased significantly after the beginning of laparoscopy in both the control group and those given clonidine, but the increase was significantly less (P less than 0.05) in the women premedicated with clonidine. The blunting effect of clonidine on hemodynamics and plasma beta endorphin may reflect a deeper level of anesthesia in those women receiving clonidine as preanesthetic medication or can be explained by an interaction of clonidine with endogenous opiates. The authors conclude that intramuscularly administered clonidine premedication effectively prevents the maximal hemodynamic responses to tracheal intubation and to gynecologic laparoscopy. Further clinical studies on the clinical importance of the role of clonidine preanesthetic medication are warranted.\r"

Patients were randomly assigned to receive general or spinal anesthesia. Group 1 patients received general inhalational anesthesia with neuromuscular blockade. Group 2 patients received spinal anesthesia using 1% tetracaine 0.4-0.6 mg/kg in conjunction with an equal volume of 10% dextrose and 0.02 ml epinephrine 1:1000. In the first part of the study, infants randomized to receive spinal anesthesia also received sedation with im ketamine 1-2 mg/kg prior to placement of the spinal anesthetic (group 2 A). The remainder of group 2 patients did not receive sedation (group 2 B). Respiratory pattern and heart rate were monitored using an impedance pneumograph for at least 12 h postoperatively. Tracings were analyzed for evidence of apnea, periodic breathing and/or bradycardia by a pulmonologist unaware of the anesthetic technique utilized. None of the patients who received spinal anesthesia without ketamine sedation developed postoperative bradycardia, prolonged apnea, or periodic breathing. Eight of nine infants (89%) who received spinal anesthesia and adjunct intraoperative sedation with ketamine developed prolonged apnea with bradycardia. Two of the eight infants had no prior history of apnea. Five of the 16 patients (31%) who received general anesthesia developed prolonged apnea with bradycardia. Two of these five infants had no prior history of apnea. When infants with no prior history of apnea were analyzed separately, there was no statistically significant increased incidence of apnea in children receiving general versus spinal anesthesia with or without ketamine sedation. Because of the small numbers of patients studied, and the multiple factors that may influence the incidence of postoperative apnea (e.g., prior history of neonatal apnea), standard postoperative respiratory monitoring of these high-risk infants is still recommended following all anesthetic techniques.\r"

Furthermore, the effects of thiopental, pentobarbital, ketamine, and diltiazem on the endothelin-induced cerebral vasoconstriction were also studied. Endothelin induced cerebral arterial contractions in concentrations above 3 X 10(-10) M. The median effective concentration (ED50: X10(-9) M) of endothelin was 2.1 +/- 0.7 (n = 6). Endothelin did not elicit contractions in preparations soaked in Ca2(+)-free solution, but addition of 2.5 mM Ca2+ to the baths induced marked contractions. Thiopental and pentobarbital attenuated endothelin-induced contractions at concentrations above 3 X 10(4) M, while ketamine was effective above 10(-3) M. In contrast, diltiazem decreased endothelin-induced vasoconstriction at 10(-6) M. The findings suggest that endothelin may cause contractions of porcine cerebral arteries by influx of Ca2+ through Ca2+ channels. The cerebral vasomotion induced by endothelin, however, does not seem to be influenced by clinical doses of barbiturates and ketamine.\r"

The duration of treatment was six months. Of the 199 patients admitted to the study, 156 completed the six-month trial period. Not all patients had a second angiogram, and in these cases clinical findings were used in the evaluation. Evaluation of the combined angiographic and clinical results showed improvement or no deterioration in 37% of patients in the placebo group compared with 49% in the low-dose and 61% in the high-dose ASA groups respectively. The only statistically significant difference observed was between the placebo group and the group treated with dipyridamole and high-dose ASA (p = 0.01). This difference remained statistically significant at p = 0.039 if only the angiographic findings were considered for group comparison. It cannot, however, be concluded from this study that 75 mg dipyridamole in combination with 100 mg ASA tid is more effective in preventing reocclusion after PTA than in combination with 330 mg ASA tid.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of computed tomography (CT) to detect mediastinal lymph node metastases from nonsmall cell bronchogenic lung cancer is highly controversial, as evidenced by reported accuracies ranging from 0.35 to 0.95 over the past eight years. We examined all studies on this matter published between January 1980 and April 1988, both to describe the overall experience and to identify characteristics (study design and methodology and CT scan techniques) that influenced reported accuracy. Of 79 relevant publications, 37 were excluded because they were review reports, assessed small cell lung cancer, or contained insufficient evidence to construct a contingency table (CT result versus node histology). The pooled, unweighted (weighted) results based on the remaining 42 studies were as follows: sensitivity, 0.79 (0.83); specificity, 0.78 (0.81); accuracy, 0.79 (0.81). Using a node size greater than 1.0 cm to define a \"positive\" CT result, as compared to a smaller diameter, was associated with significantly higher specificity, 0.89 versus 0.76, and accuracy, 0.86 versus 0.75 (p less than or equal to 0.005), but not sensitivity, 0.79 versus 0.75. The observed differences in accuracy between a fourth generation CT (0.83) and either a third or a second generation CT, (0.77 and 0.78, respectively) were not significant at p less than 0.05. No characteristics, either singly or in combination, resulted in accuracies exceeding 0.86. There exists random variation of individual study results around an overall mean accuracy of only 0.79, which is marginally improved by advances in CT technology and methods. Significant advances in the noninvasive detection of lymph node metastases must await an approach fundamentally different from CT-determined node size.\r"

  ".W": "Changes in organ blood flow (Q) produced by 20 cm H2O positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) were measured before and after the induction of hyperdynamic sepsis in nine unanesthetized sheep. During the baseline nonseptic study, PEEP was associated with a 9% fall in thermodilution-measured systemic Q, although arterial perfusing pressures were unaffected. Concurrently, microsphere-derived Q was maintained to the brain and heart, but fell to liver, spleen, pancreas, kidney, large intestine, and gastrocnemius. Twenty-four to 36 h after cecal ligation and perforation, a pre-PEEP septic study demonstrated an increase in all of the cardiac index (CI) (+43%) and systemic O2 delivery (+54%) when compared with the nonseptic study, whereas whole-body O2 extraction (-30%) was depressed. Although PEEP depressed systemic Q (-17%) during the septic study to a greater extent than during the nonseptic study (p less than 0.02), absolute organ Q fell only to pancreas, liver, and spleen. Relative to the simultaneous fall in the CI, Q to some splanchnic organs was not depressed by PEEP to the same magnitude in the septic as in the nonseptic study. When an infusion of Ringer's lactate (993 +/- 295 ml) subsequently restored systemic Q to pre-PEEP septic levels, individual flows that had been depressed by PEEP were not restored. Furthermore, Q-kidney continued to fall, such that the postfluid Q-kidney (-19%) was significantly less than was demonstrated in the pre-PEEP septic study. We postulate that differences noted in the distribution of organ Q between the nonseptic and hyperdynamic septic studies after the application of PEEP were secondary to the vasculopathy of sepsis and/or an alteration in the function of specific organ microcirculations. However, these data do not address whether the changes in organ Q distribution after a PEEP-mediated depression in systemic Q during sepsis significantly restricted tissue DO2. The inability to acutely reverse the PEEP-mediated changes in organ Q after restoring systemic Q by a fluid infusion also suggests the need to evaluate alternative methods of support to organ Q in acute respiratory failure secondary to sepsis when the addition of PEEP acutely depresses systemic DO2.\r"

Group B streptococci (GBS) were infused into 10 young piglets with left lung atelectasis to produce pulmonary vasoconstriction and determine if perfusion to collapsed regions (QL/QT) and intrapulmonary QS/QT increased as pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) increased. Left lung collapse alone increased PVR from 11 +/- 3 to 18 +/- 10 mm Hg/L/min and QS/QT from 1.9 +/- 1.4% to 8.3 +/- 6.4%; QL/QT decreased from 44 +/- 1% to 10 +/- 7% of total pulmonary blood flow (p less than 0.02).

These include respiratory muscle electromyograph (EMG) efficiency, respiratory drive, and the anxiety of the ventilator-dependent patient. After the patient had received mechanical ventilation for 7 days and the day weaning began (start), the patient was randomly assigned to biofeedback or to the control group. There were 20 patients assigned to each group, with mean ages of 60.2 (biofeedback) and 59.3 (control) yr. The patients assigned to the biofeedback group received daily, until extubation or being placed on no resuscitation status (termination), frontalis electromyographic (EMG) relaxation feedback for anxiety reduction and improved respiratory muscle EMG efficiency, tidal volume/diaphragm EMG (VT/DAP), and VT feedback for increasing VT and respiratory drive defined as tidal volume/inspiratory time (VT/TI). The control group was visited daily to control for attention and reassurance. The results showed a significant (p less than 0.01) reduction in mean ventilator days for the biofeedback group of 20.6 +/- 8.9 SD compared with 32.6 +/- 17.6 SD mean days for the control group.

  ".W": "Multiple extrapulmonary organ system failures increase mortality, permeability edema, and alveolar inflammation during gram-negative sepsis because of abnormal regulation of host inflammatory responses. We tested the hypothesis that acute hepatocytic injury induced by the selective hepatotoxin, D-galactosamine (GalN), augments mortality and amplifies pulmonary microvascular permeability to albumin and neutrophilic influx after administering Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 24 h later by impairing the metabolism of endogenously synthesized products of arachidonic acid. We determined the lung extravascular leak of 125I-human serum albumin measured at multiple time points after LPS and enumerated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Because the liver is important in prostaglandin (PG) and leukotriene (LT) metabolism, we measured plasma concentrations of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and thromboxane B2 (TxB2) in addition to paired plasma BALF concentrations of LTB4 and BALF LTC4 60 min and 24 h after LPS. We further assessed the protective effects of a single 20-mg/kg injection given intraperitoneally (i.p.) of the LTA4 synthetase inhibitor, diethylcarbamazine (DEC). After 400 mg/kg GalN, LPS at 2.5 or 1.25 mg/kg i.p. increased mortality (p less than 0.001), albumin leak 60 and 90 min after LPS (p less than 0.05), plasma 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, TxB2, and LTB4 levels and BALF LTC4 within 60 min (p less than 0.05). LTB4 and LTC4 levels in BALF 24 h later were similarly increased (p less than 0.05) as were bronchoalveolar PMNs (p less than 0.001). DEC improved mortality and albumin leak (p less than 0.001), reduced lung influx of PMNs and peripheral leukocytosis (p less than 0.05), attenuated plasma LTB4 and BALF LTC4 levels 60 min after LPS (p less than 0.05), and decreased BALF LTB4 and LTC4 at 24 h (p less than 0.05), but was associated with higher plasma 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and TxB2 values at 60 min. Changes in eicosanoid levels and modulation of responses by DEC in this model suggest that impaired metabolism of endogenously synthesized leukotriences by the damaged liver underlies these phenomena. We conclude that this mechanism may enhance septic lung injury during acute liver dysfunction.\r"

A total of 514 samples of cross-sectioned airways were taken from these lungs, covering as uniformly as possible the whole range from segmental bronchi to terminal bronchioles. In each airway, the perimeter length L of the epithelial basement membrane and the area S of mural smooth muscles were measured using a digital image analyzer, and the thickness D of smooth muscles and the radius R were determined in a standardized state in which the airway was stretched into a circle without changing L or S. On bilogarithmic coordinates, D was found to correlate significantly with R not only in individual cases but also in the total pooled data. D/R, the relative thickness of muscles, increased toward the periphery of the airways. In a theoretical application of Laplace's law to the physical conditions dominating the airway wall, this tendency in D/R suggests that the activity of airflow regulation is highest in terminal airways.\r"

  ".W": "Under the assumption that the more hyperreactive the bronchial muscles are, the greater their work hypertrophy, we analyzed the distribution of hypertrophic smooth muscles along airways to see where in the bronchial tree asthmatic constrictions mainly occur. Autopsy lungs from 16 patients with bronchial asthma, 13 with other COPDs, and 20 controls were submitted to morphometry of the bronchial muscles. In microscopic slides, cross sections of airways were taken from the segmental bronchi to the terminal bronchioles. The perimeter length L of the basement membrane and the area S of muscles were measured, and the anatomic radius R and the muscular thickness D were calculated in a standardized circular state, in which the basement membrane was stretched into a circle without changing L or S. On bilogarithmic coordinates of D and R on which data from the asthmatics were pooled, it was shown that hypertrophy of muscles was the most pronounced in larger bronchi where constriction was most likely to occur. Closer analysis of patients, however, revealed that besides this typical pattern, which we designated Type I asthma, there was a group of patients (Type II) in whom hypertrophy involved the entire range of airways, including the bronchioles, suggesting that the site of asthmatic response varies among patients. In nonasthmatic patients with COPD, only mild hypertrophy of muscles was found in the large airways, despite the presence of obstructive lesions mainly in the small airways.\r"

DESIGN: Cross-sectional physiologic and neuropsychologic evaluation. SETTING: Clinical research unit of a referral-based diabetes clinic. PATIENTS: Eight patients with well controlled diabetes (glycosylated hemoglobin [HgbA1], 8.0% +/- 0.2%), nine patients with poorly controlled diabetes (HgbA1, 11.8% +/- 0.4%), and ten healthy persons. INTERVENTIONS: The insulin clamp technique was used to produce a stepwise decline in plasma glucose from 5.0 to 2.2 mmol/L over 3 hours. Tests of attention, memory, visual-spatial skills, visual-motor skills, and global cognition; a symptom survey; and counterregulatory hormone measurements were done at glucose decrements of 0.6 mmol/L. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients with well controlled diabetes did not differ statistically from those with poorly controlled diabetes regarding the median glucose threshold for dysfunction in visual-spatial skills, visual-motor skills, or global cognition. In contrast, glycemic thresholds for an increase in adrenergic symptoms and release of epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol, and growth hormone were lower in patients with well controlled diabetes than in those with poorly controlled diabetes (P less than 0.05 to 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Despite alterations in the glucose levels at which adrenergic symptoms of hypoglycemia occur and counterregulation begins, there is no statistically detectable change in the glucose threshold at which cognitive deterioration occurs in diabetic persons with strict glycemic control. This dissociation of neuropsychologic function and counterregulatory hormone secretion suggests that diabetic patients with good glycemic control are at increased risk for developing cognitive impairment before the onset of adrenergic symptoms during hypoglycemia.\r"

DATA IDENTIFICATION: An English-language literature search using bibliographic reviews of textbooks and review articles. STUDY SELECTION: Articles were selected on the basis of providing data on the autopsy prevalence of sellar masses, the radiologic and endocrinologic evaluation of such masses, and the prognostic aspects of pituitary adenomas. DATA EXTRACTION: Twelve studies relating autopsy findings, 6 studies describing radiologic characteristics, and 26 articles reviewing various endocrine aspects of pituitary adenomas were evaluated. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: Pituitary adenoma is the most common incidental sellar mass. Scanning techniques are of great importance in differentiating the pituitary adenoma from other mass lesions. Autopsy and radiologic studies suggest that microadenomas (less than 10 mm in diameter) may be present in 10% to 20% of the population but that macroadenomas (greater than 10 mm in diameter) are quite rare. Hormone oversecretion by an adenoma may be asymptomatic but, when present, is very helpful in the differential diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: For adenomas found to be hypersecreting, therapy is as indicated for that specific tumor type. If there is no evidence of hormone oversecretion from microadenomas, we suggest a conservative approach with repeat scanning done at yearly intervals, initially, and subsequently less frequently. Macroadenomas, because they have already indicated some propensity for growth, should either be surgically removed or, if completely asymptomatic, followed closely with repeat scans at 6- to 12-month intervals.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To review the current therapeutic options for patients with the myelodysplastic syndromes. DATA IDENTIFICATION: Studies reported between 1968 and September 1989 were identified through computer searches using MEDLINE and through extensive searching of bibliographies of identified articles. STUDY SELECTION: All articles, abstracts, and reviews were evaluated, and those that contained therapeutic data were analyzed for response rates, survival, and toxicity. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: Therapies for the myelodysplastic syndromes have included hormones, chemotherapy, bone marrow transplantation, and differentiating agents, including hematopoietic growth factors. With the exception of bone marrow transplantation, none is curative or increases survival. Hematopoietic growth factors are of interest for clinical trials, because they increase the number of neutrophils and, occasionally, the number of platelets in patients with the myelodysplastic syndromes. Nonetheless, hematopoietic growth factors are not without toxicity; most notably, they are associated with a risk for acceleration to acute myeloid leukemia, and their effect on survival remains unknown. CONCLUSIONS: Standard therapy for the myelodysplastic syndromes is supportive care. When the disease progresses, patients with aggressive histologic or other poor-risk features should be considered for aggressive chemotherapy, with or without growth factors, or bone marrow transplantation. Patients with good prognostic features are candidates for therapy with growth factors or other potential differentiating agents. Carefully designed and conducted clinical trials that incorporate correlative laboratory science are essential to developing a more rational approach to therapy.\r"

  ".U": "90253110\r", 
  ".W": "The notion of medical futility has quantitative and qualitative roots that offer a practical approach to its definition and application. Applying these traditions to contemporary medical practice, we propose that when physicians conclude (either through personal experience, experiences shared with colleagues, or consideration of published empiric data) that in the last 100 cases a medical treatment has been useless, they should regard that treatment as futile. If a treatment merely preserves permanent unconsciousness or cannot end dependence on intensive medical care, the treatment should be considered futile. Unlike decision analysis, which defines the expected gain from a treatment by the joint product of probability of success and utility of outcome, our definition of futility treats probability and utility as independent thresholds. Futility should be distinguished from such concepts as theoretical impossibility, such expressions as \"uncommon\" or \"rare,\" and emotional terms like \"hopelessness.\" In judging futility, physicians must distinguish between an effect, which is limited to some part of the patient's body, and a benefit, which appreciably improves the person as a whole. Treatment that fails to provide the latter, whether or not it achieves the former, is \"futile\". Although exceptions and cautions should be borne in mind, we submit that physicians can judge a treatment to be futile and are entitled to withhold a procedure on this basis. In these cases, physicians should act in concert with other health care professionals, but need not obtain consent from patients or family members.\r"

In our residency training program, we use clinical problem-solving, journal club article review, and teaching conference preparation to generate appropriate articles from PAPERCHASE (MEDLINE) database searches. With the chief resident supervising the process, articles are then selected and organized in a computerized article file. The software program, Reference Manager (Research Information Systems, Inc., Encinitas, California), stores article citations and supports searches using standard, medical subject heading vocabulary key words.

Operative mortality rates were lower in group 2 (4%) than in group 1 (12%) and the difference was most marked in patients with upper-third lesions, where resections in group 1 had a 23% operative mortality rate but group 2 resected patients had zero mortality (p less than 0.001). A program of operative staging and selection of patients for resection or palliative procedures has resulted in better operative risks with no deterioration in survival.\r"

In an attempt to define the issue more clearly, the reported cases in the English literature from 1940 to 1988 (group 1) and our experience from 1968 to 1988 (group 2) were reviewed. In group 1 there were 222 missiles retained in the hearts of 201 patients. The retained missiles were 45 bullets in 45 patients, 109 shrapnel in 99 patients, 18 pellets in 7 patients, and 50 unidentified missiles in 50 patients. Thirteen of the missiles were completely embedded intramyocardial missiles, 122 were partially intramyocardial, 47 were free in a cardiac chamber, and 40 were intrapericardial. One hundred four of the missiles were removed and 118 were left in place. In group 2 there were 24 missiles, 18 bullets, 1 bullet fragment, and 5 pellets retained in the hearts of 24 patients. Ten missiles were removed, no attempt was made in 13 patients, and an unsuccessful attempt was made to remove one other. From group 1 patients, 6 died, 2 with intracavitary missiles, 3 patients with partially intramyocardial, and 1 patient with an intrapericardial missile, all of whom had either unsuccessful or no attempt to remove the missile. Twenty-seven patients had symptoms, all of whom, except two, had either unsuccessful or no attempt to remove the missile. All group 2 patients did well and had been free of symptoms related to the missiles. This review suggests that the management of missiles in the heart should be individualized according to the patient's clinical course, the site, shape, and size of the missile, and that in selected patients missiles in the heart are tolerated well.\r"

In the past 5 years, 16 single-lung and 13 double-lung transplantations have been performed by the Toronto Lung Transplant Group in patients with end-stage lung disease. Seven perioperative and two late deaths have been recorded so far. Since the introduction of heart-lung transplantation at Stanford in 1981 and at Pittsburgh in 1982 for the treatment of Eisenmenger's syndrome and terminal pulmonary vascular disease, more than 350 combined heart-lung transplantations have been carried out throughout the world. Presently, the 2-year actuarial survival is about 62%. The long-term results have not yet reached the same level of success as those of cardiac transplantation alone. Although several factors have played a role in this difference, a prominent cause has been the lack of a reliable and simple method for pulmonary protection against prolonged ischemia. Most of the techniques proposed against ischemia can be classified as normothermic or static hypothermic cardiopulmonary preservation. The use of the normothermic method has not always been successful. For this reason, interest has now been directed toward the potential for hypothermic preservation of the heart-lung bloc and the use of free-radical scavenger therapy in the reduction of reperfusion injury.\r"

Impairment of long-chain fatty acid metabolism and failure of energy production affect tissues reliant on oxidative metabolism. The accumulation of toxic fatty acyl derivatives impedes gluconeogenesis and urea cycle function which, in turn, causes hypoketotic hypoglycemia, transaminase elevations, and hyperammonemia. Oxidation of accumulated fatty acids through an alternative pathway, omega-oxidation, produces dicarboxylic aciduria. Carnitine must be transported into skeletal muscle. Myopathic carnitine deficiency occurs when this transport mechanism is defective. Most systemic carnitine deficiencies are secondary to other disorders that promote excretion of carnitine as acylcarnitine; however, primary systemic carnitine deficiency, likely due to impaired renal conservation of carnitine, also occurs.\r"

Patients were followed up prospectively for 1 month. Of the 10 patients receiving methylprednisolone, 9 had a marked reduction of vertiginous symptoms and 1 switched to the placebo medication. Of the 10 patients receiving placebo, 3 had relief of vertiginous symptoms, while the 7 with persistent symptoms switched to methylprednisolone and had subsequent effective reduction of vertigo within 24 hours. The electronystagmogram returned to normal within 1 month in all 16 patients taking methylprednisolone, but remained abnormal in 2 of the 4 patients treated with placebo. One patient receiving methylprednisolone had a relapse of symptoms when the dosage was tapered, but symptoms again remitted when the dosage was increased to 32 mg/d. From this double-blind, prospective, placebo-controlled, crossover study, we conclude that methylprednisolone is much more effective than placebo in reducing vertiginous symptoms in patients with acute vestibular vertigo.\r"

We have previously demonstrated that an extract of HIV-1 could induce differentiation of peripheral blood B lymphocytes of healthy volunteers into immunoglobulin-secreting cells. In an attempt to delineate the B-cell stimulatory subregion in HIV-1, we have investigated the influences of native glycoproteins and recombinant proteins of the envelope. The complete envelope glycoprotein, gp160 and a recombinant protein in the carboxyl terminal region of gp41 termed PE-8 were effective in inducing terminal differentiation of normal peripheral blood B lymphocytes and did so in a T-lymphocyte-dependent manner. The activity was not present in the native exterior envelope glycoprotein, gp120 and several other recombinant proteins, viz PE-2 an PE-3, which are in the amino terminal region of gp120 or in env-9, a protein in the junctional region of gp120 and gp41. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies directed to diverse regions of the envelope abrogated the influence of gp160. The PE-8-induced B-cell differentiation was abrogated by goat anti-gp160 antibody but not by goat anti-gp120 antibody or monoclonal antibody to the amino terminal of gp41. These studies suggest that a putative polyclonal B-cell stimulatory epitope of HIV-1 is located in the carboxyl end of the envelope glycoprotein.\r"

We grew Escherichia coli JM109 carrying the vector in a 250-liter stirred tank fermentor and purified RT (p66) under native conditions to apparent homogeneity. Purified p66 (greater than or equal to 5 mg/ml) was not stable, and was rapidly processed to its 51 kD derivative (p51), until p66:p51 levels were approximately 1:1. These latter RT preparations were chromatographed as heterodimers and had approximately fivefold higher specific RT enzymatic activities compared with those containing predominantly p66. P66 purified under dilute concentrations (less than or equal to 0.5 mg/ml) was monomeric in solution, resistant to p51 processing for weeks at 4 degrees C, but also had low specific RT enzymatic activities. To attempt the preparation of homogeneous p66 with specific RT enzymatic activities equivalent to p66:p51 heterodimers, purified heterodimers were denatured and p66 was purified and refolded during extensive dialysis (refolded p66). Refolded p66 (less than or equal to 0.5 mg/ml) was monomeric in solution and had identical specific RT enzymatic activities, Km for dTTP, and inhibition by 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine triphosphate compared with heterodimeric p66:p51 RT. The data indicates that HIV RT obtained from recombinant E. coli under native conditions is extensively processed at concentrations promoting dimerization. Moreover, RT denaturation and refolding yields apparently homogeneous monomeric p66, with specific RT enzymatic activities equivalent to heterodimeric RT.\r"

The HTLV-III(451) gp120 and gp160 were purified by sequential affinity chromatographic steps using a monoclonal antibody to HIV-1 gp41 and an anti-HIV-1-positive human serum. Amino acid sequence analysis of gp120 and gp160 showed the loss of the signal peptide. Digestion of the purified gp120 and gp160 with endoglycosidases revealed that both proteins are heavily glycosylated and contain complex carbohydrates, in contrast to the intracellular form of gp160 which has been shown to contain mannose-rich immature sugars. Competitive binding analysis showed that while both gp120 and gp160 bind CD4, the affinity of gp160 was five times lower than that of gp120. Both gp120 and gp160 inhibited syncytia formation by HIV-1-infected cells when mixed with CD4+ cells. Furthermore, both gp120 and gp160 had strong mitogenic effects on the T cells from HIV-1-infected gibbons but not on cells from uninfected gibbons.\r"

  ".W": "Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and transferrin (Tf) are actively endocytosed by many growing cells during ontogenic and neoplastic growth, but also by peripheral T lymphocytes upon mitogen activation. AFP and Tf uptake occurs through receptor-mediated endocytosis. The purpose of the present work was to assess whether the expression and functional activity of AFP and Tf receptors are impaired in mitogen-activated T cells from several groups of HIV-1 seropositive (HIV+) individuals. Forty HIV+ cases were studied, including 12 patients with AIDS, 12 with lymphoadenopathy syndrome (LAS), as well as 16 asymptomatic homosexuals (As). Quantification of AFP and Tf uptake was carried out by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using fluoresceinated derivatives of these proteins. Compared with healthy blood donors, the three HIV-1 seropositive groups exhibited clear impairment in the ability of their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to internalize AFP and Tf. The decrease in mean values of AFP uptake correlates roughly with the severity of the clinical status. Although these observations need to be confirmed after a much wider study groups, the AFP-Tf-endocytosis assay presented here clearly reveals early defective functions of mitogen-responsive T cells in disease-free subjects and may provide the basis for a prognostic test. The pathophysiological implications of these facts are discussed in relation to the structural and/or metabolic activities of fatty acids and iron, the ligands carried by AFP and Tf, respectively.\r"

With chloroquine treatment of virus-infected cells, significant size reduction of the cell- and virus-associated surface glycoproteins, gp90 of REV-A and gp120 of HIV-1, was observed. In the case of HIV-1, extracellular virions derived from treated cells contained very little gp120. Infectivity and reverse transcriptase assays of HIV-1 demonstrated that by chloroquine treatment the majority of the virions released was noninfectious and the total virus yield was also reduced. The data suggest that chloroquine inhibition of infectious virus production is most likely due to interference with terminal glycosylation in the trans-Golgi network.\r"

Human T-cell (CEM-ss) monolayers or suspension cultures were used to determine effects of structural modifications of Type A phosphorus-containing and Type B nonphosphorus EL analogs on (a) the inhibitory concentration50 (IC50) for HIV-1 syncytial plaque formation and cell growth, and, (b) virus budding at the cell plasma membrane. Results indicate that representative Type A and Type B EL inhibit HIV-1 but not herpes simplex virus type 2 plaque formation when added before or up to 2 days after viral infection. Anti-HIV-1 activity does not involve direct inactivation of virus infectivity. Type A EL (IC50 range = 0.2-1.4 microM) with alkyoxy, alkylthio, or alkyamido substitution at glycerol position 1 and ethoxy or methoxy substitution at position 2, and Type B compounds (IC50 range = 0.33-0.63 microM) with an inverse choline or nitrogen heterocyclic substitution at position 3 have selective activity against HIV-1-infected T-cells. EL treatment of HIV-1-infected cells is associated with subsequent release of reverse transcriptase activity, but infectious virus production is inhibited with time after infection. Electron microscopic examination of HIV-1-infected and EL-treated cells revealed absence of detectable budding virus at the plasma membrane but presence of intracytoplasmic vacuolar virus particles. In summary, these data suggest that EL analogs are a novel class of agents that induce defective intracytoplasmic vacuolar HIV-1 formation in T-cells. Being membrane interactive, EL are ideally suited for combination chemotherapy with DNA-interactive anti-HIV nucleoside analogs.\r"

These recombinant polypeptides were characterized serologically by the Western blot assay against a panel of HIV-2 and HIV-1 antibody-positive sera, and with normal human sera (HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibody negative). Only those polypeptides that are encoded by a segment of the env gene from the N-terminal region of the transmembrane protein gp35 (amino acids 537 to 707) were immunoreactive. Three polypeptides (921, 996, and 997), each encoding this immunoreactive region of the HIV-2 (NIH-Z) gp35, reacted strongly and specifically with antibodies in sera from HIV-2-positive individuals, but not with antibodies in sera from HIV-1-positive or HIV-uninfected individuals. These results show that the N-terminal region of the HIV-2 gp35 contains a highly antigenic determinant which is strongly immunogenic in HIV-2-infected individuals. The gp35-encoded recombinant env polypeptides can potentially be used in diagnostic assays to specifically differentiate between HIV-2 and HIV-1 infections.\r"

Twelve volunteers received either 40 micrograms of rgp160, 80 micrograms of rgp160, hepatitis B vaccine, or alum adjuvant alone on days 0, 30, and 180. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were collected on days 0, 28, 60, 120, 210, and 270 and were cryopreserved. Lymphocyte proliferation to mitogens and rgp160 with and without interleukin-2 stimulation were determined, and lymphokine production and antibody synthesis were measured. All vaccinees responded normally to stimulation with phytohemagglutinin and concanavalin A. One of 3 vaccinees who received 40 micrograms of rgp160, 2 of 2 vaccinees who received 80 micrograms of rgp160, and no controls developed rgp160-specific lymphoproliferative responses. No differences in the production of lymphokines (interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma) after stimulation with mitogens or rgp160 were found when rgp160 vaccinees and controls were compared. We conclude that rgp160 candidate vaccine induces antigen-specific lymphoproliferative responses in humans and does not interfere with immunocompetence as measured by in vitro responses to mitogen stimulation.\r"

Upon expression of the operon, gag serves as the substrate for the protease; the level of protease activity can be determined by measurement of the cleavage product of gag in cell extracts by Western immunoblotting. This system is useful in both detection of protease mutations generated by mutagenesis and in testing substrate specificity of the protease by mutagenesis of the gag sequence. Using this system, we have observed that modification of the N-terminus of HIV protease renders the enzyme temperature sensitive; the temperature sensitivity is made more pronounced by the conserved change of valine to isoleucine at residue eleven.\r"

Optimal experimental conditions are first derived using an approximate mathematical model that permits simple interpretation; these predictions are confirmed by numerical computation using a more rigorous model. It is demonstrated that the peritoneal solute reflection coefficient can be determined when solute transport is in the blood to dialysate direction only during a hypertonic exchange. When solute transport is in the dialysate to blood direction, the solute reflection coefficient can be determined using a hypotonic dialysis solution only for solutes that diffuse slowly across the peritoneum. Reliable determinations of the peritoneal solute reflection coefficient can only be obtained when using these experimental conditions.\r"

  ".W": "A diffusion-based insulin micropump was capable of sustaining normoglycemia in diabetic, pancreatectomized dogs for as long as 10 months. Basal insulin delivery was provided by diffusion into the peritoneal cavity from the insulin reservoir across a silicone rubber porous outlet, while the delivery of insulin was augmented for 35 minutes at mealtimes by repeated squeezing of a polyurethane foam disk; the latter was initiated 15 minutes prior to the start of the meal. In the best implant, which functioned for more than 10 months before it was deliberately terminated, the mean glucose level was 126 +/- 24.7 mg/dl (+/- SD) and the mean Schlichtkrull M value was 2.8. In the other three implants, the mean and standard deviations were a little higher. The basal insulin supply was sufficient to restore normoglycemia each morning, while the augmented supply substantially reduced the size of the postprandial period of hyperglycemia. Over the 10 month period studied, the maximum concentration was 150 mg/dl approximately 6 hours after the beginning of the meal, based on the mean of the approximately 200 glucose profiles determined for this implant. Despite this ability to maintain reasonable normoglycemic profiles for long periods, the pump performance deteriorated over this time period, presumably from a tissue reaction to the porous outlet of the implant. This deterioration was evident in the higher levels of glycemia associated with an insulin delivery program that was maintained for too long or in the need to readjust the program to achieve similar levels of glycemia. Nevertheless, the biocompatibility and efficacy of the controlled release micropump demonstrates the feasibility of this approach.\r"

  ".W": "Data collected during a prospective study to assess the efficacy of detecting early ovarian cancer by transabdominal ultrasonography have been used to refine and extend the screening procedure. The analysis was based on results from 5479 self-referred asymptomatic women, who were scheduled to undergo three annual screens consisting of one or more ultrasound scans. A positive result (based mainly on the presence of abnormal morphology) was obtained at 338 screens (326 women). Five patients with primary ovarian cancer (four stage 1a, one stage 1b; two at screen 1, three at screen 2) were identified (prevalence 0.09%). The apparent detection rate was 100% and the false-positive rate (FPR) was 3.5% at screen 1 and 2.3% overall. The use of abnormal morphology, or the maximum ovarian volume (MOV) greater than 96th centile as alternative criteria for a positive screen result, together with a defined volume change at rescan (VC) would give a FPR of 3.1% at screen 1 and 2.0% overall. The use of abnormal morphology alone at scan 1 and VC at rescan would give an overall FPR of 1.6%. The odds that a positive screen result would indicate the presence of an ovarian mass, a benign tumour, any ovarian cancer or primary ovarian cancer would be about 4 to 1, 2 to 1, 1 to 26, and 1 to 50 respectively. The results provide a more rational basis for the application and development of screening procedures for early ovarian cancer in both pre- and post-menopausal women.\r"

In 100 patients the diagnosis of PROM was confirmed by the collection of amniotic fluid at the vulva. There was no difference in mean depth of amniotic fluid in 100 patients with confirmed PROM, compared with 51 in whom PROM was not confirmed (48.5 mm SD 16.4 vs. 60.1 mm SD 16.5); the frequency of oligohydramnios (fluid depth less than 30 mm) was 5% and 5.8% respectively. There was no relation between ultrasound amniotic fluid quantitation and the onset of labour, the duration of labour nor the frequency of oxytocin augmentation in labour. The results show that ultrasound quantitation of amniotic fluid is of no value in the diagnosis and conservative management of PROM at term.\r"

Investigations to determine whether genuine obstruction is the cause of their symptoms may not be performed and follow-up to exclude the side effects of their outflow obstruction or indeed their treatment may not be carried out. In addition, in cases where digital palpation does not alert the clinician to the possibility of prostatic malignancy, the loss of specimens for histological interpretation may lead to missed diagnoses. In summary, the alternatives to prostatectomy are still limited. Hormonal manipulation, hyperthermia and prostatic dilatation using the smaller balloons have no role at present in symptomatic patients. The role of larger balloons has still to be determined. Alpha blockade, while achieving relief in the short-term, still requires long-term objective follow-up studies in patients with urodynamically proven obstruction to assess patient compliance and the effects of treatment before it can be recommended as a long-term alternative. Similar information is also required before the efficacy of hyperthermia in patients with retention can be determined. For high risk patients with a limited life expectancy who present with retention of urine, prostatic stents may have a role, but once again long-term follow-up data are required before this treatment can be advocated in fitter or symptomatic patients.\r"

Spontaneous cessation of reflux was observed in 6 (35%) of 17 refluxing ureters reassessed after a mean interval of 2.1 years. The significance of isotope findings was sometimes difficult to assess but results in 30 refluxing units support the concept that focal renal scarring is usually a consequence of infected reflux in postnatal life.\r"

This review examines the evidence currently available upon which such decisions must be based. Gallstones may present as biliary pain, acute cholecystitis, biliary obstruction or pancreatitis, but it is not clear who will develop symptoms and what are the commonest initial symptoms. Studies of the natural history of silent gallstones suggest that a large majority of patients with such stones will remain asymptomatic. However, diabetics are at increased risk, as are patients whose stones are detected initially at laparotomy. Incidental cholecystectomy is usually safe, and preoperative detection by ultrasonic screening is an advantage in planning the operation. Prophylactic cholecystectomy is not indicated to prevent gallbladder carcinoma (except in cases of porcelain gallbladder) and there is conflicting evidence about whether cholecystectomy predisposes to colorectal carcinoma.\r"

A consultant surgeon (M.H.) made a simulated management decision on the basis of a clinical summary and a duplex scan report. Twenty-four patients were selected for surgery without angiography; duplex scanning had a sensitivity of 100 per cent and a specificity of 90 per cent in the detection of internal carotid artery stenosis. In two cases duplex scanning misdiagnosed a total occlusion as a critical stenosis. Eighteen patients failed to meet the criteria for surgery and were referred for angiography. Twenty-one patients were selected for conservative treatment on the basis of the duplex scan report. Combining the surgical and conservative groups (45 patients), duplex scanning had a sensitivity of 96 per cent and specificity of 95 per cent for the detection of stenosis greater than 50 per cent. In the identification of a total occlusion, duplex scanning had a poor sensitivity of 50 per cent. These results suggest that routine angiography before carotid endarterectomy is unnecessary in selected patients but that a suspected occlusion should be confirmed by angiography.\r"

Using multiple linear regression three resistance values were derived for runoff at different levels: (1) a single calf vessel (R1); (2) distal popliteal artery (R3); (3) irrespective of the level (R0). There was good agreement between the predicted resistances R0, R1 and R3 and the measured PR. In the single calf vessel group (R1) the limits of agreement (-0.41 to +0.39) and 95 per cent confidence interval (-0.16 to +0.14) with the measured PR were better than in the R0 and R3 groups. These levels of agreement are small enough to replace the measured PR with the predicted PR method. Using the appropriate resistance equation in a further prospective series of 14 cases, there was agreement between the predicted and measured PR (limits of agreement -0.67 to +0.41; 95 per cent confidence interval -0.26 to +0.15). These results confirm the value of PGR in the assessment of critically ischaemic limbs particularly with a single calf vessel. Calf vessel continuity with the pedal arch appears to be a major determinant of PR, particularly in the isolated calf vessel group. A non-invasive resistance value can be derived which will predict the intraoperative peripheral resistance and should help predict subsequent graft outcome.\r"

  ".W": "Intermittent hepatic dearterialization is used in the palliative treatment of liver malignancy. However, its metabolic consequences are not established. Therefore the influences of the procedure on the plasma insulin, glucagon and glucose responses were studied in healthy rats and in rats with a tumour inoculated subcapsularly into the liver. To study the influence on stimulated islet hormone secretion we infused arginine intravenously (7 mg/min) for 30 min, because arginine is known to stimulate the secretion of both insulin and glucagon. During hepatic dearterialization, hyperglycaemia developed; mean(s.e.m.) blood glucose levels after 60 min of dearterialization were 20.2(1.3) mM versus 14.7(1.5)mM in controls (P less than 0.001). Concomitantly, compensatory hyperinsulinaemia and hypoglucagonaemia occurred. Furthermore, during both dearterialization and in the immediate reperfusion phase, the arginine-induced increase in plasma insulin levels was impaired (P less than 0.001), whereas the arginine-induced increase in plasma glucagon levels was not significantly affected. These changes were qualitatively the same in tumour-free and tumour-bearing rats. We conclude that glucose intolerance develops during selective hepatic dearterialization, which is evident both from basal hyperglycaemia and impaired insulin secretion.\r"

The standard combination of cisplatin and etoposide (PE) was used as the control arm. Since January 1987, 78 patients were enrolled and then stratified for previous treatments and performance status (PS). The response rate (RR) of PEI was 26% (95% confidence limits [95 CL], 12% to 40%), with one complete response (CR). The RR of PE was 26% (95 CL, 13% to 39%), with no CR. The median response duration was 5 months (range, 2 to 13 months) for PEI and 4 months (range, 2 to 6 months) for PE. The median survival time was 6 months (range, 1 to 22+ months) for PEI and 7 months (range, 1 to 21+ months) for PE. Leukopenia at recycling was similar in both arms (25% for PEI and 29% of PE). The median leukocyte nadir was 2100/microliters (range, 430 to 4870/microliters) for PEI patients and 3150/microliters (range, 500 to 5000/microliters) for PE patients. Three patients had a drug-related death secondary to infections. This Phase II randomized study suggested that the combination of cisplatin plus etoposide and ifosfamide produces results similar to those obtainable with cisplatin and etoposide.\r"

Each patient was given etoposide at 500 mg/m2/day on days 1 to 3 and cisplatin at 80 mg/m2 (two patients given 120 mg/m2) on day 1; autologous bone marrow was not transplanted. Five patients were given recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF, 50 micrograms/m2) in an attempt to reduce HD-EP induced neutropenia. The overall response was 50% (9 of 18); one complete response (6%), eight partial responses (44%), seven no change (39%), and two progressions of disease (11%). Of the 18 evaluable patients, 12 had been treated with regimens of conventional doses of etoposide with conventional doses of cisplatin or carboplatin, and of these, five (42%) achieved a partial response. The median duration of response was 8.4 weeks (range, 5.3 to 17.7) and the median survival time was 20.3 weeks (range, 1.6 to 91). All of the patients developed severe myelosuppression; rhG-CSF did not shorten the period of the leukopenia. Mucositis and liver dysfunction were the major nonhematologic manifestations of toxicity. Two treatment-related deaths resulted from sepsis. These results suggest that the activities of high doses etoposide with standard doses of cisplatin are synergistic against small cell lung cancer.\r"

Effective means of alleviating these problematic symptoms are lacking. Extensive clinical data demonstrate a weight enhancing effect for the serotonin antagonist, cyproheptadine, in several clinical situations. In addition, sound basic research suggests that cyproheptadine may be helpful in patients with cancer anorexia/cachexia. Because of this, the authors performed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical trial using cyproheptadine, 8 mg orally three times a day in 295 patients with advanced malignant disease. Patients assigned to cyproheptadine had less nausea (P = 0.02), less emesis (P = 0.11), more sedation (P = 0.07), and more dizziness (P = 0.01) than placebo patients. Patients' appetites, measured by serial patient-completed questionnaires, appeared to be mildly enhanced by cyproheptadine. Unfortunately, cyproheptadine did not significantly abate progressive weight loss in these patients with advanced malignant disease; patients assigned to cyproheptadine lost an average of 4.5 pounds per month compared to 4.9 pounds per month for patients assigned to a placebo (P = 0.72).\r"

A total of 54 patients were treated with the initial sites of presentation observed: mediastinum, 26; central nervous system, 14; retroperitoneum, eight; and sacrococcygeal region, six. Megavoltage irradiation was used in 44 patients with a dose range of 2400 to 5580 cGy (mean, 4213 cGy). With a minimum follow-up of 4.0 years and a mean follow-up of 10.8 years, the 5-year actuarial survival for the entire population was 57.8%. Local control was achieved in 26 of 44 (59%) of the irradiated population. Factors of prognostic significance included histologic type at presentation, site of presentation, and radiation doses greater than or equal to 4000 cGy. Radiotherapy appears to be an effective modality in patients with extragonadal seminomas; however, the nonseminomatous tumors do not appear to be as radioresponsive.\r"

Seven of 22 previously reported malignant histiocytosis patients (32%) with descriptions of detailed whole karyotypes have the 17p+ markers, including two of the authors' patients. Five of seven patients with 17p+ involved 17p13. Although breakpoints at the 17p+ in the remaining two were not described, their karyotypes were shown to possibly involve 17p13. The high incidence of this abnormality is not considered accidental, and this breakpoint is not usual in many other neoplastic disorders. These facts may indicate that 17p13 chromosome abnormality is a specific change of malignant histiocytosis.\r"

The cytologic material was collected during a period of 3 years. Sixty-four patients were selected and studied retrospectively. The reactivity of a number of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies was investigated and applied to a diverse group of tumors. Marker expression on routine cytologic and histologic material was compared and the use of immunocytochemistry in diagnosis was evaluated. Immunocytochemistry proved to be an easy and valuable technique for the identification and classification of tumor cells, and there was a good concordance with immunohistology. A discrepancy in marker expression was found in 10% of the slides that were investigated. Immunocytochemistry led to a misdiagnosis in only four cases; however, in these cases cytology alone would not have led to the correct diagnosis. The causes for the discrepancies are discussed. It is estimated that immunocytochemistry contributed to the diagnosis of approximately 50% of the cases, supplying either additional or essential information. A wide variety of markers can be applied reliably on cytologic preparations. The use of panels of antibodies is mandatory.\r"

The panel of antibodies applied included anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), anti-vimentin (VM), anti-S-100 protein (S-100 P), anti-cytokeratin, and anti-prealbumin antisera. All ependymomas and astroblastomas examined expressed both VM and GFAP, which were either absent or focally expressed in choroid plexus tumors. In contrast, all choroid plexus tumors showed anti-cytokeratin immunoreactivity that was absent in the ependymomas and astroblastomas. Five choroid plexus tumors also expressed S-100 P, thus differentiating them from metastatic carcinoma that showed negative immunostaining. Anti-CEA antisera immunoreactivity was seen in six metastatic tumors, whereas none of the primary CNS tumors expressed CEA. Prealbumin was expressed in four choroid plexus tumors and two metastatic tumors. Immunohistochemical typing using a panel of antibodies has allowed the differentiation of most of the papillary tumors in the CNS examined in this study.\r"

In a multivariate logistic model (Cox regression), PS, Hb, and Alk P were found useful for dividing patients into prognostic groups. The prognosis for high-risk patients on standard hormonal treatment was very poor. The authors concluded that research on prognostic factors is useful and permits a division of patients into risk groups that makes choice of treatment more accurate. The use of new treatment combinations as a start treatment is appropriate for high-risk patients with disseminated prostatic cancer.\r"

The tumor histologic subtype was alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) in 20 patients (56%), embryonal RMS in 11 patients (30%), and other types of sarcoma in 5 patients (14%). Fifteen children had grossly complete surgical excision (Clinical Groups I and II), and 15 had localized gross residual tumor (Group III) after initial operative management. Six patients had distant metastases (Group IV) at diagnosis. Twelve patients without distant metastases underwent regional lymph node biopsy; tumor involvement was found in six. Subsequent treatment consisted of chemotherapy with vincristine (VCR) and dactinomycin (AMD) for all patients; patients in Groups III and IV also received cyclophosphamide (CYC) with or without Adriamycin (ADR) (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH). Radiation therapy (RT) was administered to patients in Clinical Groups II, III, and IV. Overall, 28 (78%) patients achieved a complete clinical response. The 3-year disease-free survival rate for these patients was 42%, compared with 52% for all other patients in the combined IRS I and IRS II series (P = 0.44). The overall 3-year survival rate was 59%, compared with 64% for all other patients in IRS I and IRS II (P = 0.48). Aggressive treatment is needed in children with perineal sarcoma to improve their prognosis.\r"

A high priority of the World Health Organization (WHO) cancer control program is the outreach approach that promotes worldwide access to cancer therapies of proven values. Therefore, the first priority in national health programs for breast cancer is to encourage patients to present for diagnosis and treatment at an earlier stage of the disease. In the development of guidelines for the early detection of breast cancer, the WHO emphasizes the importance of appropriate widespread coverage of high-risk groups as opposed to repetitive screening of low-risk groups, so that early detection will be effective. A WHO/USSR controlled trial of breast self-examination and community-based adjuvant therapy is helping to develop the WHO global recommendations for the control of breast cancer. Depending on the extent of the breast cancer problem, the local resources, and the cultural situation, national health strategies should include all three main elements--public education, early detection, locally available treatment, or a combination of these to a national comprehensive program for the control of breast cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Ischaemic renal tubular damage in the perioperative period can lead to acute renal failure (ARF) with a very high mortality rate (60-75 per cent). Recent research suggests that this tubular injury is caused by an imbalance of the oxygen supply and demand of medullary thick ascending limb (mTAL) tubular cells. High oxygen demand is secondary to active reabsorption of solute which is increased in states of intravascular volume depletion. The restricted supply of oxygen is secondary to the organization of blood flow to the inner medulla. Because the vasa recta loop into the inner medulla and a countercurrent exchange process for oxygen is established, the oxygen tension in this area may normally be as low as 10-20 mmHg. In hypoperfusion states, mTAL injury occurs and is exacerbated by intravascular volume depletion, hypoxaemia and endothelial cell swelling which reduces perfusion of these vulnerable and metabolically active mTAL cells. The anaesthetist must prevent or attenuate postoperative renal dysfunction by identifying high-risk patients preoperatively, optimizing intravascular volume status and cardiac output in the perioperative period, as well as responding appropriately to hypoperfusion states. Therapeutic implications relate to this pathophysiological sequence and several physiological and pharmacological considerations are discussed.\r"

Each of these fields continues to grow in response to patient needs, but it is clear that scientific knowledge alone cannot provide the physician with all the guidance necessary to ensure the provision of optimal care. Patient care cannot consist only of making diagnoses, prescribing medications, and performing technical procedures. Particularly in the care of the elderly, the emergency physician must be able to recognize ethical issues and to respond to them in the manner that will provide the greatest benefit to the patient. With the application of such skills, the emergency treatment of the elderly promises more benefit for elderly patients and their families and less doubt and anguish for emergency practitioners.\r"

  ".W": "Diseases do not always show the usual or \"classic\" signs and symptoms in the elderly. Physiologic changes over the years of a long life seem to be responsible for impairment of regulation or function of many organ systems. Since function often is measured in clinical medicine by laboratory testing, physicians frequently face difficult clinical decisions as to the need for further evaluation of a patient based upon a laboratory test result received. For the most part, the laboratory values obtained in elderly persons seem to fall into our traditional or so-called normal ranges, and little evidence supports the need for separate sets of reference ranges for the elderly. A few patients do show abnormalities on specific tests, and a few test values can be expected more frequently than others to be out of line in healthy elderly individuals, specifically: serum alkaline phosphatase (elevations to about 2.5 times the normal) fasting blood glucose (up to 135 to 150 mg/dl) postprandial blood glucose or oral glucose tolerance test (increased above normal to 10 mg/dl per decade of age) normal serum creatinine with the existence of markedly decreased creatinine clearance higher erythrocyte sedimentation rates (up to 40 mm/hr) hemoglobin (lowest acceptable level is 11.0 gm/dl in women; 11.5 gm/dl in men) BUN (up to 28 to 35 mg/dl) The presence of multiple diseases in elderly patients, as well as the many medications often taken, will no doubt be more of a source of confusion and consternation in the clinical correlation of laboratory test results than the lack of adequate reference ranges specifically compiled for the elderly. The question \"What test result is significant and raises suspicion of disease?\" will remain a part of that all-important integration and correlation of the information available to the physician for the diagnosis and treatment of the patient.\r"

  ".U": "90255438\r", 
  ".W": "Delirium, an acute confusional state, is an organic brain syndrome that manifests deficits in attention, irrelevant or rambling speech, and other cognitive deficits. Its symptoms often fluctuate over the course of the day, and patients may be hyperactive--for example, restless and screaming--or hypoactive--for example, quiet, inactive, and stuporous. Occurring in approximately 20% of hospitalized elderly patients, delirium is the most common psychiatric syndrome in acutely ill general medical and surgical patients. Fifteen to 30% of delirious patients expire, and others are prone to a variety of complications: falls, pressure ulcers, oversedation, dehydration, and others. Almost any acute illness can cause delirium in the elderly, but the most common offenders are acute infections and drugs. Many patients have a pre-existing dementia. The first step in arriving at a correct diagnosis is to distinguish delirium from other psychiatric syndromes that can cause confusion, such as dementia, depression, schizophrenia, and mania. Once delirium is established, a comprehensive general examination and a mental status examination is required. Routine laboratory and radiologic tests are directed at the common metabolic and infectious disorders that precipitate delirium. Treatment is directed at the underlying acute illness. In all patients, it is important (1) to treat the underlying acute illness, (2) to provide appropriate fluid and electrolytes, (3) to discontinue any unnecessary drugs, and (4) to allay the patient's fear and agitation through the use of simple, repetitive instructions, orientation cues, and by limiting the use of physical restraints. If psychotropic medications are needed to treat psychotic symptoms, to prevent patients from harming themselves or others, or to facilitate necessary diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, then haloperidol is the drug of choice in most instances. Drugs with anticholinergic properties should be avoided.\r"

The emergency department is in a unique and vital position for providing early diagnosis, for organizing and activating an interdisciplinary team to rapidly assess the stroke patient, and for establishing protocols for therapy. The emergency physician has an important role in increasing general awareness and in helping to educate the public about risk factors and early symptoms of various stroke syndromes. Nursing and emergency personnel must also be made increasingly aware of the desirability of early recognition of stroke and of new therapeutic measures. Stroke patients should no longer be considered of moderate to low priority, as has often been the case in the past. With an aggressive approach in dealing with risk factors, education in early recognition of symptoms, and new and promising interventional therapies, morbidity and mortality from this often catastrophic disease may be dramatically reduced.\r"

In the Emergency Department, it is very important to take a detailed history of the circumstances leading to the fall and to perform a thorough physical examination. Every attempt should be made to identify predisposing factors for the fall and for preventive measures to be initiated. These may include geriatric consultation or a home visit to evaluate home environment. There is a great need for additional research in this field. Falls are one of the syndromes common in the elderly that deserve more careful attention and are considered amenable to both primary and secondary prevention measures.\r"

Because of underlying chronic diseases, these patients are also at increased risk for joint infection and resultant sepsis. Evaluation of synovial fluid from the inflamed joint is important. Light microscopy evaluation with a red polarizing compensator can help diagnose crystal-mediated disease, such as gout or pseudogout. Examination of Gram stains can help diagnose infectious arthritis. Thus, appropriate processing of synovial fluid is mandatory for the diagnosis of many rheumatologic disorders that occur in the elderly. A variety of metabolic disorders are associated with pseudogout and should be searched for on laboratory evaluation. Appropriate laboratory evaluation and follow-up following the acute episode are important in the care of these patients. For example, temporal arteritis with resultant blindness is a feared disorder in the elderly. Transient blindness, headaches, jaw claudication, and an elevated Westergren sedimentation rate suggest this diagnosis. Aches and pain in the neck and shoulder area, especially in the morning, are typical of polymyalgia rheumatica. Polymyalgia rheumatica may also be a symptom of temporal arteritis.\r"

Geriatric patients may present with atypical symptoms that mask serious illness: diagnostic imaging begins with a high index of suspicion and the choice of the proper imaging modality. For certain problems, such as skeletal trauma and chest complaints, conventional radiography provides an excellent screening examination. For other problems--abdominal, vascular, and central nervous system disorders--computed tomography, ultrasound, and radionuclide scanning have become important primary imaging modalities. Since the emergency physician is in a position to direct the initial imaging of the patient, he or she must weight the factors of cost, invasiveness, and accuracy of the diagnostic modalities available at the institution. Emergency radiology is a growing field. References have been included in the reference list for general emergency radiology, specific modalities, and specific anatomic areas. In addition, there are resources that document pitfalls in imaging; the Keats volume is indispensable both in the Emergency Department and in the Radiology Department.\r"

Because of concomitant illness, these patients generally have a substantial operative risk. Further, the symptoms and signs in these patients are frequently milder and less specific than in younger adults with the same conditions. Therefore, the emergency physician must develop a high index of suspicion for these conditions and must seek early surgical consultation, even if a definitive diagnosis has not been established. In other words, in many cases consultation must be sought on the basis of the emergency physician's clinical suspicion rather than on \"hard\" data. Emergency physicians must pay particular attention to associated extra-abdominal disease, which must be diagnosed and stabilized to minimize the risk of emergent surgery. Only aggressive assessment, expeditious resuscitation, and team work with the surgical consultants can minimize the high mortality rate associated with these acute abdominal surgical emergencies.\r"

Unfortunately, many are not staffed with mental health professionals or such expertise is available only on a limited basis, particularly on evenings and weekends. Therefore, one or more members of the Emergency Department staff should have specialized psychiatric training and experience. We have reviewed the format for conducting a psychiatric history and mental status examination and have discussed the most common emergency psychiatric disorders of the elderly and their management in the Emergency Department. In order to assess and treat elderly psychiatric patients properly, emergency personnel must be aware of the medical disorders associated with psychiatric illness and must be prepared to initiate treatment quickly and appropriately.

The resolution of disposition problems brought about through caregiver exhaustion, patients no longer able to care for themselves in the community, and abandonment by individuals and institutions require a complex array of skills. The serious problem of drug and alcohol abuse among the elderly must be recognized by Emergency Department staff. Physical problems often disguise the existence of a problem of substance abuse. Clinicians in the Emergency Department should evaluate elderly patients using social and family history information in addition to a thorough physical assessment. Elder abuse manifests as physical abuse, psychological abuse, material abuse, and active and passive neglect. The problem is growing, and there is a need for skilled observation and detection of elderly patients presenting for emergency care. As the proportion of the elderly population in this country increases, social policies and program development must reflect these changes. Experts in fields such as gerontology, geriatric medicine, psychiatry, nursing, and social work must make recommendations for changes in the medical and social service delivery systems. The availability of coordinated, comprehensive services for the elderly will expand as the movement toward geriatric treatment centers grows. These centers will provide medical, psychiatric, social, and residential care through the concept of a continuum of care. They will employ a multidisciplinary team of geriatric specialists and include outreach as well as treatment services. Communities with a geriatric treatment center provide a valuable resource for patients identified through Emergency Department visits. The Emergency Department must play an active role in assisting hospitals, area agencies on aging, and other concerned members of the community plan programs for elderly patients with physical and social concerns. While these changes are implemented, the Emergency Department will continue to remain responsive to the social concerns of the elderly through deliberate organizational efforts designed to maintain a high quality of care for elderly patients.\r"

The resulting increased permeability of the alveolar-capillary membrane allows shifts of fluid and protein into the interstitial fluid space and alveolus. As hypoxemia develops, the nurse assesses cardinal signs and symptoms derived from the physical examination and observations. Clinical data consisting of results from various laboratory and diagnostic studies confirm the diagnosis of HPPE. Finally, nursing diagnoses can be delineated as the basis on which expert nursing care is planned and implemented.\r"

  ".U": "90256635\r", 
  ".W": "The influence of pulmonary inflation and positive airway pressure on nasal and pharyngeal resistance were studied in 10 normal subjects lying in an iron lung. Upper airway pressures were measured with two low-bias flow catheters while the subjects breathed by the nose through a Fleish no. 3 pneumotachograph into a spirometer. Resistances were calculated at isoflow rates in four different conditions: exclusive pulmonary inflation, achieved by applying a negative extra-thoracic pressure (NEP); expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP), which was created by immersion of the expiratory line; continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), realized by loading the bell of the spirometer; and CPAP without pulmonary inflation by simultaneously applying the same positive extrathoracic pressure (CPAP + PEP). Resistance measurements were obtained at 5- and 10-cmH2O pressure levels. Pharyngeal resistance (Rph) significantly decreased during each measurement; the decreases in nasal resistance were only significant with CPAP and CPAP + PEP; the deepest fall in Rph occurred with CPAP. It reached 70.8 +/- 5.5 and 54.8 +/- 6.5% (SE) of base-line values at 5 and 10 cmH2O, respectively. The changes in lung volume recorded with CPAP + PEP ranged from -180 to 120 ml at 5 cmH2O and from -240 to 120 ml at 10 cmH2O. Resistances tended to increase with CPAP + PEP compared with CPAP values, but these changes were not significant (Rph = 75.9 +/- 6.1 and 59.9 +/- 6.6% at 5 and 10 cmH2O of CPAP + PEP). We conclude that 1) the upper airway patency increases during pulmonary inflation, 2) the main effect of CPAP is related to pneumatic splinting, and 3) pulmonary inflation contributes little to the decrease in upper airways resistance observed with CPAP.\r"

  ".W": "Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is known to produce activation of the expiratory muscles. Several factors may determine whether this activation can assist inspiration. In this study we asked how and to what extent expiratory muscle contraction can assist inspiration during CPAP. Respiratory muscle response to CPAP was studied in eight supine anesthetized dogs. Lung volume and diaphragmatic initial length were defended by recruitment of the expiratory muscles. At the maximum CPAP of 18 cmH2O, diaphragmatic initial lengths were longer than predicted by the passive relationship by 52 and 46% in the costal and crural diaphragmatic segments, respectively. During tidal breathing after cessation of expiratory muscle activity, a component of passive inspiration occurred before the onset of inspiratory diaphragmatic electromyogram (EMG). At CPAP of 18 cmH2O, passive inspiration represented 24% of the tidal volume (VT) and tidal breathing was within the relaxation characteristic. Diaphragmatic EMG decreased at CPAP of 18 cmH2O; however, VT and tidal shortening were unchanged. We identified passive and active components of inspiration. Passive inspiration was limited by the time between the cessation of expiratory activity and the onset of inspiratory activity. We conclude that increased expiratory activity during CPAP defends diaphragmatic initial length, assists inspiration, and preserves VT. Even though breathing appeared to be an expiratory act, there remained a significant component of active inspiratory diaphragmatic shortening, and the major portion of VT was produced during active inspiration.\r"

To investigate whether any changes were induced by release of prostaglandins, the subjects were also pretreated with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin. CPAP produced a significant (P less than 0.001) upward shift of the pressure-volume (PV) curve [change in total lung capacity (delta TLC) 374 +/- 67 (SE) ml, mean delta volume at a transpulmonary pressure of 15 cmH2O (delta VL15) 279 +/- 31 ml] with no change in K, an index of lung distensibility. After CPAP the PV curves returned to normal base line within 20 min. The same pattern was observed after indomethacin, but the increase in TLC was significantly less (P less than 0.01) (mean delta TLC 206 +/- 42 ml) mainly because of a slight and not statistically significant increase in base-line TLC. In five subjects further PV curves with and without CPAP were obtained greater than or equal to 7 days after indomethacin. The responses were not significantly different from those obtained before indomethacin (mean delta TLC 366 +/- 89, mean delta VL15 296 +/- 42 ml). We conclude that CPAP produces an upward shift of the PV curve without a change in lung distensibility. In addition, there may be a small degree of resting alveolar duct tone that is influenced by indomethacin.\r"

Calibration of this device in anesthetized intubated dogs was accomplished by adjusting the electrical gain of its analog waveform to be equivalent to changes of airway pressure during inspiratory efforts against an occluded airway. This procedure, denoted the occlusion test, was also used to identify the site of esophageal balloon catheter placement for its recording of intrapleural pressure deflections. The validity of SIP-derived estimates of inspiratory and expiratory pulmonary resistances and lung compliance was established by finding close agreement with measurements obtained with intraesophageal pressure changes during 1) unimpeded spontaneous breathing, 2) inspiratory resistive loading, 3) bronchoprovocation with aerosolized carbachol, 4) mechanical ventilatory modalities, and 5) induced pulmonary edema. Therefore, movements of the suprasternal fossa with respiration can be reliably transformed into quantitative or semiquantitative changes of intrapleural pressure in anesthetized intubated dogs during major alterations of pulmonary mechanics.\r"

  ".U": "90256665\r", 
  ".W": "The necessity for defining hypoxia as O2-limited energy flux rather than low partial pressure is explored from a systems perspective. Oxidative phosphorylation, the Krebs cycle, glycolysis, substrate supply, and cell energetics interact as subsystems; the set point is a match between ATP demand and aerobic ATP production. To this end the transport subsystem must match the transcapillary and mitochondrial O2 fluxes. High transcapillary O2 flux requires intracellular PO2 in the range 1-10 Torr. In this range the O2 drive on electron transport must be compensated by adaptive changes in the phosphorylation and redox drives. Thus the metabolic subsystem supports diffusive O2 transport by maintaining O2 flux at intracellular partial pressures required for O2 release from blood. Since responses to stress are distributed according to the state of the entire system, several simultaneous metabolic measurements, including intracellular PO2 (or a known direction of change in intracellular PO2) and the O2 dependence of a measurable function are required to judge the adequacy of O2 supply. ATP demand and aerobic capacity must also be evaluated, because the hypoxic threshold depends on the ratio of ATP demand to aerobic capacity. The application and limitation of commonly used criteria of hypoxia are discussed, and a more precise terminology is proposed.\r"

  ".W": "In 10 patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome, we studied the effects on respiratory system mechanics of two levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), best PEEP (BP) and half of this value (HBP), using a respiratory inductive plethysmograph (RIP) combined with a super syringe. We found the following. 1) Inflation compliance of pressure-volume (PV) curves did not change significantly. 2) End-expiratory volume increased with HBP and further with BP (278 +/- 186 and 464 +/- 313 ml, respectively, P less than 0.01). This increase was positively correlated with inflation compliance for HBP and BP (r = 0.794, P less than 0.01 and r = 0.876, P less than 0.01, respectively). 3) No dynamic hyper-inflation was detected on mechanical ventilation at zero end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP), and the time constant of the respiratory system was in the normal range (0.79 +/- 0.21 s). 4) Hysteresis of PVrip curves, which were corrected for gas exchange, decreased significantly with PEEP (P less than 0.05). We conclude that PEEP does not change inflation PV curve but induces an increase in intrathoracic volume whose magnitude is related to compliance and PEEP level. The reduction of hysteresis with PEEP suggests less gas trapping and thus a functional improvement.\r"

On separate occasions nine normal subjects inhaled a single cumulative provocation concentration of methacholine (control) causing a 40% fall (PC40 Vp30) in maximum expiratory flow rate at 70% of base-line vital capacity below total lung capacity during a partial forced expiratory maneuver or 100 or 200 micrograms PAF, and seven subjects inhaled a further dose of 400 micrograms PAF. Methacholine responsiveness was measured before, at 3 and 7 h, then on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, and 14 after each challenge. The maximum falls in Vp30 appeared dose dependent, but a significant difference between the magnitude of the responses was only observed between the 400- and 100-micrograms PAF dose (P less than 0.05). During the control period repeated methacholine challenges resulted in a progressive increase in cumulative provocation concentration of an agonist causing a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s from base line, reaching significance on days 1 and 2 (2.44- and 2.4-fold of base line, respectively, P less than 0.01) before returning to base line on day 7. No difference was seen in methacholine responsiveness after any of the three doses of PAF compared with that after the control. We conclude that PAF causes dose-dependent bronchoconstriction but does not change airways responsiveness to methacholine and that repeated high-dose methacholine challenge leads to loss of responsiveness to this agonist.\r"

The fractures were selected for their liability to delayed union by the presence of moderate or severe displacement, angulation or comminution or a compound lesion with moderate or severe injury to skin and soft tissues. Treatment was by plaster immobilisation in all, with active electromagnetic stimulation units in 20 patients and dummy control units in 25 patients for 12 weeks. Radiographs were assessed blindly and independently by a radiologist and an orthopaedic surgeon. Statistical analysis showed the treatment groups to be comparable except in their age distribution, but age was not found to affect the outcome and the effect of treatment was consistent for each age group. The radiologist's assessment of the active group showed radiological union in five fractures, progress to union in five but no progress to union in 10. In the control group there was union in one fracture and progress towards union in one but no progress in 23. Using Fisher's exact test, the results were very significantly in favour of the active group (p = 0.002). The orthopaedic surgeon's assessment showed union in nine fractures and absence of union in 11 fractures in the active group. There was union in three fractures and absence of union in 22 fractures in the control group. These results were also significantly in favour of the active group (p = 0.02). It was concluded that pulsed electromagnetic fields significantly influence healing in tibial fractures with delayed union.\r"

Twenty-seven animals successfully underwent aortic arch replacement during periods of circulatory arrest from 2.5 to 6.5 minutes. One animal was electively sacrificed 3 years after arch replacement. Various sized aortic arch prostheses manufactured for clinical use would have the potential advantages of technical simplicity of insertion and reduced cardiopulmonary bypass. Alternatively, varying sized tubular grafts for the brachiocephalic branches could be attached to the currently available tubular intraluminal grafts.\r"

However, there is as yet no consensus on which groups in the population should be selected for screening. Some Authors have suggested the screening of populations at risk by virtue of their age, sex and/or the presence of arterial hypertension, and report the incidence of AAA in these populations as 5.3%, 3.4% and 0.25%, respectively. In this study we screened a group of patients with atherosclerotic peripheral vascular disease. Within this group the incidence of aneurysms was found to be 5.9%, which is at least twice the estimated incidence in the general population. Three of the six patients discovered, successfully underwent surgery. We conclude that screening of this specific population group is considerably more cost-effective than universal screening.\r"

The postoperative course was uneventful in the two patients, both of whom showed marked improvement of clinical features. The six other surgical corrections of TAPVD in patients over 40 years of age that have been reported in Japan are also reviewed. The favorable results in these cases were associated with the following common factors: 1) unobstructed forms with large drainage veins, 2) large interatrial communication, 3) normal pulmonary vascular resistance with normal or slightly elevated pulmonary artery pressure, 4) low grade, delayed cyanosis, and 5) the supracardiac type of TAPVD.\r"

Both cases were detected by combined 2-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography. The operative treatment was similar in both patients. After extirpation of the old prosthesis, the orifice of the pseudoaneurysm was closed from inside the heart, either with a Dacron patch or using interrupted sutures supported by a teflon pledget. One of the patients died one month postoperatively but the other one recovered and is clinically well 6 months after repair.

It was initially thought that he had fallen on a sea-urchin. He removed some spines at the time of injury but the finger became stiff, swollen, and painful, and after eight months with no symptomatic improvement amputation through the proximal phalanx was performed. Examination showed an exuberant granulomatous and foreign body type inflammation in the dermis and subcutaneous tissues and affecting the bone, with erosion of the cartilaginous surfaces of the proximal interphalangeal joint. Spines present in soft tissue sections contained no calcium but did contain chitin as shown by a von Wisseling reaction for chitosan. It is concluded that the chitinous spines almost certainly came from a sea-mouse (Phylum Annelida, family Aphroditidae). Sea mice are inconspicuous creatures which live on the sea floor and which may cause some injuries thought to be attributable to sea-urchins.\r"

The method clearly differentiated between organisms confirmed as resistant or sensitive by conventional techniques. Twenty four (50%) disease and 14 (56%) control E coli specimens showed serum resistance. Bactericidal competence of sera from patients with ulcerative colitis was assessed by incubating sensitive E coli with sera from 10 patients with ulcerative colitis and pooled normal serum. All sera effectively reduced viable counts to less than 6% of original inoculum. This study shows that serum samples from patients with ulcerative colitis are bactericidally competent and that there is no increase in the number of serum resistant E coli in patients with ulcerative colitis.\r"

  ".W": "The two most well known and well defined grading systems for dysplasia in colorectal adenomas were compared with regard to reproducibility. The Konishi-Morson system (KMS) operates with several histological and cytological variables and grades of mild, moderate, and severe dysplasia. The Kozuka system is based on the extent of nuclear pseudostratification and also has three grades of dysplasia (III-V). As the group of severe dysplasia is very large in this system, it was extended with two higher grades, similarly based on individual histological criteria, known hereafter as the extended Kozuka system (EKS). Fifty six adenomas were graded by two observers, each observer grading twice according to the KMS criteria and twice according to EKS criteria. Intraobserver reproducibility was excellent for the KMS and moderate for the EKS, but this was not significant. The overall interobserver reproducibility was similar (moderate) for the KMS and for the EKS. Kappa values for interobserver reproducibility on individual categories were excellent for severe dysplasia according to the KMS, but low for all other categories in both systems. By simplifying both systems into two groups a high reproducibility can be obtained, but this implies that all the original grades (III-V) for the EKS must be grouped together. It is therefore recommended that a simplified KMS is used for further studies on the biological importance of dysplasia and for comparison between histological changes and other markers for colorectal neoplasia.\r"

  ".W": "We report a methodology for selecting APC with mutations that have impaired their ability to present Ag to T cells. A20 B lymphoblastoid cells were mutagenized and then repeatedly cocultured with murine T-T hybridomas in the presence of specific Ag. During these cocultures, the T-T hybridomas kill the competent APC, allowing the outgrowth of inactive variants. Two variants, A20.M1 and A20.M2, were isolated and studied in detail. These variants are impaired in their ability to present multiple Ag to T cells. This defect is also observed for the presentation of processing independent peptides by fixed APC indicating that a lesion exists in a post-Ag processing step. The level of expression of MHC molecules is unaffected and the functional defect in the APC is not localized to a particular MHC molecule. In contrast, these mutants were found to have a selective decrease in the expression of the murine homolog of ICAM-1, and the residual ability of these cells to present Ag was not blocked by anti-ICAM-1 mAb. Conversely, Ag presentation by the wild-type A20 is inhibited by anti-ICAM-1 mAb. Similarly, anti-LFA-1 mAb inhibited the response of T cells to Ag presented by the wild-type A20 to a much greater degree than by the mutant cells, indicating that LFA-1 is involved in interaction of T cells with the former, but not latter, APC. In the apparent absence of a contribution of LFA-1 to the T cell-APC interaction, either as a result of mAb blocking or the disruption of the APC membrane, the mutant and wild-type APC have a similar level of Ag-presenting activity. Reconstitution of ICAM-1 expression in these mutants by transfection with murine ICAM-1 cDNA fully restores their ability to present Ag. Together these results demonstrate that a murine ICAM-1 homolog is expressed on A20 B cells, where it functions as a major cell interaction molecule. The degree of functional impairment in these mutant APC gives insight into the contribution of cell interaction molecules to efficient Ag presentation and T cell-B cell interaction. Finally, these results also demonstrate the feasibility of selecting APC with mutations affecting Ag presentation.\r"

Here we show that the mIgGR for Ag is endocytosed in the presence or absence of Ag and that at any given time about 60% of this recycling pool of membrane (m) Ig is inside the cell. During the earliest detectable stages of Ag processing a high proportion of Ag fragments resolved on SDS gels were bound to intact mIg. However, at later times, as fragmented Ag accumulated, the fragments were precipitable only with antibodies against the Fab region of mIgG indicating proteolytic fragmentation of this receptor. Fractionation of cell homogenates on self-forming Percoll gradients revealed that at least two compartments are involved in Ag processing: a low density endosome compartment and a dense \"late endosome\"/lysosomal compartment. The spectrum of Ag fragments observed in each fraction differed: fragments produced at later times during processing were detected only in the late endosome/lysomal fraction whereas the earliest observed fragments were found both in this fraction and in the low density fractions. Monovalent Ag/mIgG complexes appear to have an increased probability, compared to unoccupied mIgG, of targeting to proteolytically active compartments leading to processing of the Ag/mIg complex and to accelerated degradation of the mIgG.\r"

  ".W": "Mononuclear cells in synovial fluids (SF) from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other arthropathies are characterized by functional and phenotypic changes, including impaired mitogen responsiveness and inverted ratios of CD4+/CD8+ T lymphocytes. This is related to previously described activities in synovial fluids that inhibit proliferation of lymphocytes induced by mitogens and cytokines. The present study examines the relationship of these activities and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), which is now known as the most potent endogenous inhibitor of lymphocyte function. It is shown that most of the activity in SF that inhibits IL-1-induced thymocyte or T cell proliferation is neutralized by a specific antibody to TGF-beta. Analysis of the SF in the CCL64 assay, a standard test for TGF-beta, showed a close correlation between the levels of immunosuppressive activity and TGF-beta. SF contain spontaneously active inhibitors of T cell function and this is caused by the presence of active TGF-beta. Higher titers are found after transient acidification, which is known to activate the latent form of TGF-beta. Characterization of the TGF-beta isoforms showed that most of the material in SF is TGF-beta 2. Analysis of TGF-beta effects on T cell subsets demonstrated that it completely inhibits proliferation of CD4+ cells whereas at the same concentrations of purified or rTGF-beta CD8+ cells are only inhibited by maximally 31.1%. SF also preferentially inhibit CD4+ Th cell proliferation and this effect is neutralized by antibody to TGF-beta. Collectively these results indicate that the presence of TGF-beta accounts for most of the immunosuppressive activities in SF and that this factor may be responsible for functional and phenotypic changes of SF lymphocytes.\r"

The bulk CTL cultures from WKA/H and DA rats lysed specifically syngeneic SV40-transformed kidney cells infected with recombinant vaccinia viruses (RVV) expressing HTLV-I gag and pX Ag, but not those infected with RVV expressing HTLV-I env Ag or a control vaccinia virus. From WKA/H rat CTL cultures, four CTL clones reactive with syngeneic HTLV-I-infected cells were isolated, three of which were specific for p27rex/p21x, but the Ag recognized by the other CTL clone was not defined with any RVV used.

  ".W": "In man, three distinct classes of receptors for the Fc fragments of IgG (FcRI, II, III) have been defined. The FcRI has a Mr of about 72 kDa, binds human IgG-coated E, and is recognized by mAb such as 32. The FcRII has a Mr of 40 kDa, binds murine IgG1-coated E, and reacts with the mAb IV.3 and CIKM5, which recognize CDw32 moieties. Lastly, the FcRIII has a Mr of 50 to 70 kDa and is recognized by anti-CD16 mAb. In the present study we have shown that i) only murine IgG1-coated E form rosettes with 49 +/- 1.5% (mean +/- SEM, n = 9) of CD1a+ epidermal cells (EC) (which represent Langerhans and indeterminate cells) and that ii) the mAb anti-FcRII CIKM5 prevents this rosette formation. Among the mAb reacting with the three different types of FcR, only those recognizing FcRII i) stain about 55 +/- 1.5% (mean +/- SEM, n = 9) of the CD1a+ EC and ii) reveal the presence of dendritic cells in epidermal sheets obtained by suction blister. Under the electron microscope i) apparently all the cells forming rosettes or reacting with the gold-labeled anti-FcRII mAb (CIKM5 or the F(ab) fragment of IV.3) contained Birbeck granules and ii) the gold-labeled mAb were internalized in unfixed Langerhans cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis and accumulated in lysosomes. Labeling by the anti-FcRII mAb of the CD1a+ cells in suspension disappears after 48 h of culture. All these observations strongly suggest that CD1a+ EC express only the FcRII. This conclusion was confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments, whereas no specific immunoprecipitate was noted with the anti-FcRI or anti-FcRIII mAb, the anti-FcRII mAb immunoprecipitated a protein of Mr 40 kDa.\r"

  ".W": "A panel of 20 anti-Plasmodium vivax female gamete mAb has been established and was characterized with respect to their transmission-blocking properties in membrane-feeding experiments and their target Ag identified. Seven mAb suppressed the infectivity of P. vivax parasites to Anopheles tesselatus mosquitoes. The m.w. of the Ag recognized by these mAb were ascertained by SDS-PAGE and Western blots. Three sets of polypeptides of low Mr--20, 24, and a doublet of 37/42 kDa--have been defined as target Ag of transmission-blocking antibodies of P. vivax. All epitopes of these target Ag were found to be dependent on the tertiary conformational structure of the Ag. Polymorphism of target Ag of transmission-blocking immunity was investigated in over 30 natural isolates of P. vivax in Sri Lanka based on the reactivity of a mAb with an isolate as assessed by the indirect immunofluorescent test with the use of live extracellular female gametes, and in Western blots with the use of extracted gametes. The functional consequences of antigenic polymorphism on immunity was investigated in transmission-blocking assays by using membrane-feeding experiments. A majority of target Ag of transmission-blocking immunity were found to be polymorphic, exhibiting size as well as epitope polymorphism. Results indicate that failure of a mAb to affect the infectivity of a parasite isolate of P. vivax to mosquitoes can be caused by polymorphism of the target Ag among isolates.\r"

  ".W": "Many acoustic neurinomas and CPA tumours present an audiometric picture of positive-recruitment hearing impairment although often the CMs are not significantly impaired (according to ECochG) and because, even in the case of a small acoustic neuroma, the interpeak latency between wave I and V (ERA) is increased in the majority of cases. Recruitment cannot be explained, in these cases, as an expression of an accompanying vascular inner ear lesion. Therefore, we attempt to interpret the differential audiometric picture to the various patterns of damage of the auditory nerve. The finding of tone decay is seen as an expression of myelin damage corresponding to the hearing loss in multiple sclerosis. The absence of any degree of tone decay excludes an isolated damage of the myelin sheaths; hearing loss then results from a disturbance also of the associated axons. At such a stage, where there is a functional loss to part of the neural fibres but with intact myelinated residual fibres, the result could be the phenomenon of recruitment for suprathreshold stimulation. This theory of selective compression is compared to an isolated efferent lesion theory as the cause for recruitment in AN and CPA tumours.\r"

In the present series, four of the widely practiced surgical procedures for the reduction of the size of the inferior turbinates were evaluated and compared. In all cases turbinectomy was performed as an isolated procedure. Eighty patients with chronic non-allergic rhinitis and hypertrophied inferior turbinates were selected, randomly divided into four groups, and followed up post-operatively for one year. Study of the results indicated that the beneficial effect of the operation is mainly mechanical by reduction of the resistance to nasal airflow. The post-operative improvement in smell acuity correlated positively with the increased patency of the nasal airway. None of the procedures had a deleterious effect on olfactory acuity. In contrast, the operation failed to enhance the mucociliary clearance rate or significantly decrease nasal drainage. Partial inferior turbinectomy and laser turbinectomy improved nasal breathing in 77 per cent of patients, and enhanced olfactory acuity in 78 per cent of patients who had pre-operative hyposmia. The results of turbinoplasty and cryoturbinectomy were less favourable. The surgical technique, advantages, and drawbacks of each of these procedures are discussed.\r"

This paper documents the experience at the Royal Liverpool Childrens Hospital, Alder Hey, from 1973 to 1989. Clinical details were recorded retrospectively from the hospital case notes. Sixty-eight children had orbital sepsis of whom 30 had associated acute sinusitis. Of these 30 children, orbital sepsis was always unilateral with a preference for the left side; ten had diplopia of whom four had a sub-periosteal abscess which was subsequently drained. There were no serious complications although two children had diplopia for two to three months.\r"

  ".W": "The Swedish Ticlopidine Multicentre Study (STIMS) was a double-blind placebo-controlled trial designed to determine whether ticlopidine, a platelet antiaggregatory agent, reduces the incidence of myocardial infarction, stroke and transitory ischaemic attacks in patients with intermittent claudication. A total of 687 patients was monitored for a minimum of 5 years or until an end-point was reached. The number of end points (99 vs. 89), analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle, was 11.4% lower in the ticlopidine group (P = 0.24). The mortality rate was 29.1% lower in the ticlopidine group (64 vs. 89, P = 0.015); this observation could be accounted for by a reduced mortality from ischaemic heart disease. On-treatment analysis showed there to be significantly fewer end points in the ticlopidine group (47 vs. 76, P = 0.017). Diarrhoea was the most common side-effect. Reversible leucopenia or thrombocytopenia was reported in seven patients on ticlopidine. It is concluded that the high morbidity and mortality from cardio- and cerebrovascular disease in patients with intermittent claudication can be reduced by long-term treatment with ticlopidine.\r"

Two of the three patients with severe autonomic neuropathy had a completely abolished plasma epinephrine response to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia, whereas the third patient showed a reduced and delayed plasma epinephrine response. Lipolytic sensitivity to isoprenaline (P less than 0.05), and to epinephrine in the presence of yohimbine (P less than 0.0001), was significantly increased in the diabetic subjects with severe autonomic neuropathy, compared to the other study groups. Moreover, the specific binding of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (+-)-4-(3-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxyl)-(5.7-3H)-benzimidazole- -2-one-hydrochloride (3H-CGP) was markedly exaggerated (P less than 0.05) in the patients with severe autonomic neuropathy. These findings demonstrate that the lipolytic sensitivity to catecholamines in adipose tissue was increased only in patients with severe autonomic neuropathy and impaired epinephrine response to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia. This increased beta-adrenergic sensitivity could, at least in part, be attributed to an increased density of beta-adrenergic receptors in the adipocytes.\r"

The measurements were compared to the number of neurofibrillary tangles as revealed by Congo red staining of adjacent sections. All assays and measurements were done by observers blinded to the clinical diagnoses. Binding was decreased significantly for all ligands except quisqualate in stratum pyramidale of CA1 of the Alzheimer's disease brains. The binding loss was significantly greater for the non-quisqualate and NMDA sites than for the muscarinic, benzodiazepine and kainate sites with the total glutamate and PCP site losses being intermediate. Only the loss of benzodiazepine binding was significantly correlated with the number of neurofibrillary tangles. Lesser binding losses were seen in adjacent areas. This difference in the degree of binding decrease is consistent with the hypothesis that NMDA receptors are located on more distal dendrites of hippocampal neurons. There they may be relatively more vulnerable than the other receptors to the pathological process.\r"

The distribution of myocardial 123I among iodides, free IHA, and esterified IHA was measured in myocardial biopsy specimens. The increase in esterification and decrease in oxidation of IHA due to glucose were quantified using a compartmental mathematical model of myocardial IHA metabolism. Subsequently, in six control and six glucose-perfused dogs, cardiac radioactivity was measured with a scintillation camera for 1 hr following i.v. injection of IHA. Four different methods were used to analyze the myocardial time-activity curves and to calculate the distribution of IHA between oxidation and esterification. Results comparable to those provided by analysis of biopsy specimens can be obtained by considering the curve to be the sum of an exponential and a constant, or by analyzing it with a compartmental mathematical model.\r"

  ".W": "Swine fitted with re-entrant ileo-cecal cannulas were fed purified diets containing either casein or soybean protein to study possible relations between cholesterol metabolism, digestion of dietary constituents and postprandial patterns of various serum components. Compared with soybean protein, dietary casein produced an increase in serum total cholesterol in which the excess cholesterol was located in the low density lipoprotein fraction. Ileal and fecal excretion of neutral steroids was diminished in pigs fed casein, suggesting that cholesterol absorption was stimulated. The apparent ileal absorption of protein was increased in pigs fed casein. The enhanced absorption of cholesterol and protein was associated with a reduced rate of flow of chyme through the ileum. The output of bile acids in the feces of pigs fed casein was decreased, whereas the ileal output was not significantly affected. This could be attributed to increased uptake of bile acids from the cecum and/or colon, which may in part be related to the indirectly observed decreased formation of secondary bile acids. Postprandial serum concentrations of insulin and glucose were temporarily increased in pigs fed casein, whereas those of triglycerides were decreased. We suggest that the decreased excretion of cholesterol and bile acids is the major determinant of casein-induced hypercholesterolemia in swine.\r"

  ".W": "The authors analyzed the value of using mean corpuscular volume (MCV) as a guide for selecting tests for further evaluation of anemia in hospitalized patients. Of the 2,082 patients with anemia admitted to the medical service of a teaching hospital over one year, 655 (31%) had further diagnostic tests to evaluate the cause of the anemia. Within this group of 655 patients, 399 (61%) had normal MCVs. Over half the patients with abnormal serum vitamin B12, folate, or ferritin levels, or with low serum iron (Fe) levels with elevated total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), did not have the MCVs expected according to the classification of anemia proposed by Wintrobe. Furthermore, 5% of patients with evidence of iron deficiency had high MCVs, and about 12% of patients with decreased vitamin B12 levels had low MCVs. The MCV was quite specific in identifying patients who had low ferritin levels: specificity was 83%; however, sensitivity was only 48%. The MCV was also specific (88%) for identifying patients who had low Fe with elevated TIBC; however, sensitivity was only 43%. The MCV was poor in identifying patients with abnormalities of serum vitamin B12 and folate levels. In this study the MCV did not provide sufficient diagnostic accuracy to be a useful criterion for the selection of more definitive tests in the evaluation of anemia in hospitalized patients.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical and histologic features of 87 cases of odontogenic keratocysts were reviewed. Males were affected more frequently than females. All age groups were affected, with a predilection for the fifth and sixth decades. The molar-angle-ramus area of the mandible was the most common location (29.8%). In 7 cases (8.8%), the cysts were part of the basal cell nevus syndrome. Recurrences were observed in 9 cases (10.4%). The cysts were lined by a thin, regular, stratified squamous, parakeratinized epithelium without rete ridges. Orthokeratin was observed in 24.14% of the cases. Mitotic figures were observed in approximately 50% of the cases. Separation of lining epithelium from underlying connective tissue was observed in 82.7%, with subepithelial hyalinization in 75.8% of the cases. Inflammation was observed in 72.4%, cholesterol clefts were observed in 11.5%, and Rushton hyaline bodies in 4.6% of the cases. Dental lamina rests were observed in 32.2% and satellite cysts in 20.7%. Dystrophic calcifications were found in 36.8%. Ameloblastomatous proliferation was observed in 2 cases.\r"
