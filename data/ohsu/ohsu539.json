  ".W": "We have investigated systemically the hypothesis that there exist subtypes of the alpha-1 adrenoceptor in the canine pulmonary artery. The affinity of the alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin, was assessed by Schild Regression Analysis against the agonists, phenylephrine, norepinephrine and methoxamine, in rings prepared from canine pulmonary artery using the classical technique in which control and treatment concentration-response curves are obtained in every tissue. This technique allows for appropriate corrections to be made in tissue-dependent differences in agonist potency, time-dependent changes in agonist sensitivity and differences in maximum responses that result from nonspecific effects of agonists occurring at higher concentrations, as was found to be the case for methoxamine. Two cumulative concentration-response curves were constructed for each agonist at 2-hr intervals, with the first (control) concentration-response curve being constructed before the addition of prazosin, and the second concentration-response curve obtained 1 hr after exposure to prazosin. Prazosin had similar pA2 values against phenylephrine (9.56), norepinephrine (9.32) and methoxamine (9.35), with slopes of the Schild Regressions not differing significantly from the theoretical value of unity, suggesting that blockade was competitive in all cases. The results provide no evidence for heterogeneity in alpha-1 adrenoceptors in canine pulmonary artery when assessed using the classical method involving two concentration-response curves in a single tissue and allowing for appropriate corrections in tissue-dependent differences and time-dependent changes in agonist response.\r"

The stereoselectivity of the monooxygenase reaction with styrene was determined by high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis of the glutathione conjugates formed quantitatively from SO, the product of the monooxygenase reaction. Hepatic microsomes from control rats oxidized styrene at a rate of 13.1 +/- 4.5 nmol/min/nmol of P-450 and with a ratio of the amount of the (R)-styrene 7,8-oxide enantiomer to the amount of the (S)-styrene 7,8-oxide enantiomer (R/S) SO ratio of 0.65 +/- 0.1. These values were determined under incubation conditions in which epoxide hydrolase activity was inhibited by cyclohexene oxide, and at least 95% of the SO formed was converted enzymatically to glutathione conjugates. Treatment of rats i.p. with phenobarbital (PB) or beta-naphthoflavone (beta NF) caused changes in both parameters. Whereas the rates of oxidation in hepatic microsomes prepared from PB-treated rats was unchanged at 15.4 +/- 7.5 nmol/min/nmol of P-450 and decreased in hepatic microsomes from beta NF-treated rats to 9.4 +/- 2.8 nmol/min/nmol of P-450, the preference for formation of the R-enantiomer increased as the R/S ratio changed to 0.92 +/- 0.1 for PB and 1.25 +/- 0.1 for beta NF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Lovastatin, a specific inhibitor of the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, HMG-CoA reductase, has been shown to be highly effective in lowering serum cholesterol in animals and humans and thus represents a promising approach to the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease. During the preclinical safety assessment of lovastatin, oral doses that were tolerated by dogs, rats and mice were found to be lethal to rabbits in subacute studies. Postmortem findings in rabbits consisted of centrilobular hepatic necrosis, frequently accompanied by renal tubular necrosis and occasionally gallbladder necrosis. The liver lesions were associated with up to 300-fold elevations in serum aspartate and alanine aminotransferase activities, whereas the kidney lesions resulted in accumulations of serum urea nitrogen and creatinine. The organ damage was preceded by a progressive decline in food consumption and loss of body weight. All histopathological and serum biochemical changes induced by lovastatin were completely prevented by coadministration of mevalonate, the product of the inhibited HMG-CoA reductase enzyme. In addition, administration of mevalonate after the onset of lovastatin-induced hepatotoxicity effectively reversed the toxicity despite continued drug treatment. These findings indicated that the toxicity of high doses of lovastatin to rabbits is a consequence of a highly exaggerated pharmacologic action in blocking mevalonate synthesis. However, supplementation of lovastatin-treated rabbits with oral doses of the major product of mevalonate metabolism, cholesterol, paradoxically enhanced the liver and kidney damage, which suggested that the toxicity of lovastatin stemmed from depletion of a nonsterol metabolite(s) of mevalonate critical for cell viability.\r"

  ".U": "89141471\r", 
  ".W": "A major research goal of liposome pharmacology is the selective delivery of drugs to target cell populations while minimizing extraction by phagocytic macrophages and blood monocytes of the reticuloendothelial system. The liver is an ideal organ for studying targeting strategies using a variety of liposomes, inasmuch as its discontinuous capillaries have fenestrae through which liposomes less than 0.2 microns in diameter may escape into the extravascular space. In a previous kinetic study, we proposed that the hepatic uptake of small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) in mice was compatible with a model of uptake involving dual, parallel pathways. One is a saturable, phagocytic pathway of uptake mediated by Kupffer cells, the other is a nonsaturable, pinocytotic pathway of uptake mediated by parenchymal cells, favoring the latter pathway at high liposomal dose (Beaumier et al., 1983). In the present study, we demonstrated by the techniques of liver cells fractionation that the uptake of either the bovine brain sphingomyelin/cholesterol (2:1; mole/mole) SUV or distearoyl phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol (2:1; mole/mole) SUV by hepatic parenchymal cells was enhanced markedly by increasing the amount of injected dose of SUV. As high as 85 to 90% of the total liver dose can be attributed to the uptake of SUV by the hepatic parenchymal cells alone, when the injected dose reaches at or above 7.5 to 10 micrograms of lipid per g b.wt. The dose effect on the uptake of liposomes by hepatocytes appears to be a general phenomenon of neutral SUV. Our data suggested that blockade by dose permits a feasible approach to target SUV to hepatic parenchymal cells.\r"

  ".U": "89141472\r", 
  ".W": "In superfused striatal synaptosomes, previously unexposed to Ca2+ during isolation and superfusion, 1.25 mM Ca2+ evokes the release of [3H]dopamine. This Ca2+-evoked release is produced without elevating K+ (4.5 mM) before or after Ca2+ exposure, can be blocked by the Na+ channel antagonist tetrodotoxin, and modulated by dopamine (D2) receptor agonists and antagonists. We now present evidence that functional K+ channels regulate Ca2+-evoked [3H]dopamine release and may be necessary for the dopamine (D2) modulation of this release. The K+ channel blocker tetraethyl ammonium (TEA) could partially prevent D2 agonist (LY-171555) inhibition of Ca2+-evoked release in both olfactory tubercle and striatal synaptosomes. Another K+ channel blocker, 4-aminopyridine, also partially blocked dopamine (D2) agonist inhibition of release. When both 5 mM tetraethyl ammonium and 0.1 mM 4-aminopyridine were employed, by, dopamine (D2) inhibition of Ca2+-evoked [3H]dopamine release was prevented. However, with both K+ channel blockers present, only the initial portion of the release could be blocked by tetrodotoxin. These results are consistent with what might be expected if K+ channels were linked to dopamine (D2) receptors. In additional experiments we found that stimulation of adenylate cyclase by 1 microM forskolin with 0.25 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine present potentiated Ca2+-evoked [3H]dopamine release but that this combination did not affect dopamine (D2) inhibition of [3H]dopamine release. Furthermore, although the protein alkylator n-ethylmaleimide could block dopamine (D2) inhibition of release, pertussis toxin, a specific inactivator of the inhibitory protein regulating adenylate cyclase, had little effect on dopamine (D2) inhibition. Therefore, dopamine (D2) inhibition of dopamine release may not be coupled to adenylate cyclase activity.\r"

The release of neurotransmitters reported here was evaluated using a slice-superfusion assay system. Transmitter release was induced either by an electrical field (for DA and ACh) or by application of either amphetamine or amfonelic acid (DA only). Dopaminergic receptor function was assessed by inhibiting electrically stimulated ACh release with in vitro TL-99 (a dopaminergic agonist) and by reversing that inhibition with in vitro neuroleptics or with ex vivo experimental paradigms (the in vitro analysis of transmitter release subsequent to in vivo drug administration). These data suggest that although there are differences between haloperidol and clozapine, there is no difference between the degree of postsynaptic DA receptor blockade produced that can be attributed to the duration of neuroleptic treatment. Chronic clozapine (20 mg/kg x 21 days) reversed TL-99-induced inhibition of ACh release in the nucleus accumbens only, whereas chronic haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg x 21 days) produced a similar reversal in both brain areas. One possible explanation for the lack of effect of chronic clozapine treatment in the striatum is that carrier-mediated (amphetamine-stimulated) DA release is enhanced in the striatum but not in the nucleus accumbens, suggesting that the potential DA receptor block in the striatum may be compromised by enhanced striatal DA levels. Acute haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg) was found to increase electrically stimulated ACh release in the striatum and DA release in the nucleus accumbens. Tolerance developed in the striatum, but not the nucleus accumbens, with repeated administration. However, acute clozapine had no effect on ACh release in either area, but it was found to enhance DA release in the striatum, an effect to which tolerance developed with chronic administration. Further, comparison of these data with data obtained using haloperidol and clozapine in vitro suggests that it is unlikely that these effects are due to residual drug still present in these tissues at the time of experimentation. These data are discussed with regard to electrophysiological and pharmacological differences observed between clozapine and haloperidol on the activity of A9 and A10 DA cells after chronic neuroleptic treatment.\r"

Because cellular transport may be an important determinant of S-conjugate-induced nephrotoxicity, the characteristics of the transport of nephrotoxic cysteine S-conjugates and analogs were studied in rat renal proximal tubular cells. Time- and concentration-dependent uptake of S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine (DCVC) and S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-L-homocysteine (DCVHC) into cells were observed; higher concentrations were accumulated in the presence of aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA), an inhibitor of cysteine conjugate beta-lyase, indicating that AOAA does not inhibit transport. Saturable sodium-dependent and sodium-independent transport processes were identified; approximately 50% of DCVC uptake, but only 30% of DCVHC uptake, was sodium-dependent. Competition studies indicated that the probenecid-sensitive organic anion transport system, which is sodium-dependent, and system L, which is sodium-independent, participate in the renal proximal tubular uptake of both S-conjugates. In addition, DCVHC uptake occurs by the sodium-dependent system ASC and system A. The greater degree of sodium independence of DCVHC uptake as compared to that of DCVC indicates that system L plays a greater role in DCVHC uptake than it does in DCVC uptake. Both sodium-dependent and sodium-independent uptake of the nonmetabolizable and nontoxic alpha-methyl analogs, S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-DL-alpha-methylcysteine and S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-DL-alpha-methylhomocysteine, were observed at rates comparable to those of DCVC and DCVHC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

(one pellet 7 days before glucose utilization measurement and two pellets 4 days before the measurement) to produce opioid dependence. LCGU rates in 85 brain regions of placebo- and morphine-pelleted rats were similar. In contrast, LCGU rates, 5 hr after implantation of one morphine pellet, were decreased significantly in six areas. The lack of a chronic morphine effect on LCGU suggests tolerance to morphine. Additional support for this view was that an additional dose of morphine (8 mg/kg s.c.) in morphine-dependent rats was also ineffective in altering LCGU and in an antinociception (hot plate) test. Furthermore, plasma morphine levels in chronically treated animals were greater than those in acutely treated animals. Naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal enhanced LCGU, most notably in thalamic and limbic areas, but also in some hypothalamic and hindbrain regions. The findings identify brain areas that may be important in the opioid abstinence syndrome. Furthermore they suggest that adaptations in the brain produce tolerance to morphine, reflected in LCGU rates and latencies in the hot-plate test.\r"

In general, responding under the shock-postponement or the fixed-interval schedules was decreased minimally by doses of naltrexone up to 30 mg/kg, and these effects were not altered appreciably after daily injections of naltrexone under the fixed-interval schedule. Under the fixed-ratio schedule of food presentation naltrexone (0.3 to 10 mg/kg) produced dose-related decreases in responding, and after repeated daily injections of naltrexone the dose-effect curve was shifted more than 3-fold to the left. Under the fixed-ratio schedule of stimulus-shock termination, however, this supersensitivity to naltrexone was not apparent: responding was decreased appreciably only after 17.6 mg/kg of naltrexone. When the fixed-ratio schedule of food presentation was reinstated, the supersensitivity to naltrexone observed previously under this schedule was not evident initially, but reappeared quickly in two of the monkeys. The greater rate-decreasing effects of naltrexone under the fixed-ratio schedules compared to the other schedules may reflect a dependency related to the control rate of responding. Supersensitivity to naltrexone occurred only under the fixed-ratio schedule of food presentation and could be reversed temporarily by intervening exposure to the schedule of stimulus-shock termination. These results extend earlier findings that the behavioral effects of drugs can be dependent upon both past and present environmental influences.\r"

The effects of ACC-9358 on action potentials from isolated canine Purkinje fibers and ventricular muscle were examined using standard microelectrode techniques. In Purkinje fibers, ACC-9358 (1-50 microM) exerted a dose-dependent reduction in maximum upstroke velocity (Vmax) and action potential duration at 50 and 90% repolarization (APD50 and APD90). The reduction of Vmax was voltage-dependent (greater at an extracellular potassium concentration of 6 mM than at 2.7 mM), frequency-dependent (greater at a basic cycle length of 500 than at 2000 msec) and very slow in onset (rate constant of 0.017 action potentials-1) and offset (recovery half-time of 66.9 sec). In Purkinje fibers, ACC-9358 attenuated the action potential shortening effects of lidocaine but not that of nicardipine or nicorandil and shortened APD50 to a greater extent at a basic cycle length of 2000 than at 500 msec.

Rodent proximal small intestine was cut into strips measuring 6.0 x 10.0 mm. Strips cut along the oral-caudal axis were called longitudinal strips, whereas those cut 90 degrees to that axis were called circular strips. The strips were stretched to their optimal lengths and subjected to electrical field stimulation in the presence of various concentrations of atropine, pirenzepine or McN-A-343-11. All three drugs inhibited field-stimulated contraction responses and produced or augmented relaxation responses in both muscle layers. All relaxation responses were abolished by tetrodotoxin, indicating they were due to excitation of inhibitory nerves. For each response examined atropine was significantly more potent than pirenzepine (relative potency ratio, 13.36-95.74). The inhibitory effect of McN-A-343-11 on longitudinal muscle was antagonized by both atropine and pirenzepine, indicating the recruitment of cholinergic inhibitory nerves. Neither atropine nor pirenzepine had any effects on inhibitory responses produced by McN-A-343-11 in circular muscle, indicating the recruitment of noncholinergic inhibitory nerves. McN-A-343-11 also increased spontaneous contraction amplitudes in both muscle layers by a direct (tetrodotoxin-resistant) effect on smooth muscle. This effect was also antagonized by atropine and pirenzepine. Thus, both cholinergic and noncholinergic nerves participate in inhibitory neuromuscular transmission in the small intestine. Circular muscle is dominated by a noncholinergic inhibitory innervation. Longitudinal muscle appears to be controlled by both cholinergic and noncholinergic inhibitory nerves.\r"

Equilibrium saturation analysis (paired) of specific [3H]LTE4 and [3H]LTD4 binding confirmed that [3H]LTE4 possesses lower affinity (kd values: 1.17 +/- 0.14 and 0.38 +/- 0.06 nM, respectively, n = 6, P less than .01) and lower density (maximum binding values: 524 +/- 46 and 988 +/- 66 fmol/mg, n = 6, P less than .01) binding sites. Binding of [3H]LTE4 was 3 to 4-fold more sensitive to inhibition by GTP analogs than has been demonstrated previously on [3H]LTD4. Drug competition assays illustrate that inhibition of [3H]LTE4 binding by agonists displays similar selectivity of (LTD4 greater than LTE4 much greater than LTC4) and stereoselectivity (5S,6R-LTD4 much greater than R,R greater than R,S greater than S,S) to the observed inhibition of [3H]LTD4, suggesting that [3H]LTE4 binds to LTD4 receptors. Selective LTD4 antagonists inhibited [3H]LTE4 binding with a relative potency [compound 1 (ICI 198,615 analog) greater than ICI 198,615 = ICI 204,219 greater than LTD4 greater than LTE4 much greater than FPL55712 = LY171,883] comparable to that obtained against [3H]LTD4.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

DPX lowered the Na-dependent uptake of Pi by OK cells. By comparison enprofylline, 3-propylxanthine (ENP), a weak adenosine receptor antagonist, produced a slight elevation in glomerular filtration rate but no changes in electrolyte excretion by IPRK or Pi uptake by OK cells. Both DPX and ENP produced negligible elevations in basal IPRK cAMP. A 1-nM bolus of PTH elevated urinary and perfusate cAMP 50- and 10-fold, respectively. PTH-elevated urinary and perfusate cAMP were augmented further 4- to 7-fold with DPX and 3- to 4-fold with ENP (All IPRK experiments used 50 microM xanthine).

  ".W": "The effects of i.c.v. administered dermorphin, a highly selective mu-opioid agonist, on cardiac function and renal, mesenteric and hindquarter blood flow were studied in conscious rats. Core temperature, blood gases, arterial plasma levels of norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) also were examined. Cardiac output was measured using a thermodilution technique and regional blood flows using directional pulsed Doppler velocimetry. Dermorphin, at doses of 0.1-100 nmol/kg, increased blood pressure and hindquarter blood flow, renal and mesenteric resistance, and core temperature. Higher doses (1-5 mumol/kg) caused respiratory depression, acidosis, and shock despite profound sympatho-adrenomedullary stimulation. Circulating levels of catecholamines were significantly increased at the dermorphin doses of 0.1-100 nmol/kg. At the 100 nmol/kg dose, plasma levels of epinephrine, norepinephrine, the dopamine metabolite dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and the catecholamine precursor 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine were increased by 2-15-fold. The data indicate that mu opioid receptor stimulation exerts potent effects on cardiorespiratory functions, activates the sympathoadrenomedullary system and produces a pattern of blood flow changes consistent with the stress-induced \"defense\" response (skeletal muscle vasodilation and splanchnic vasoconstriction). Excessive mu opioid receptor stimulation leads to shock due to respiratory and hemodynamic collapse.\r"

Chlorpromazine in micromolar concentrations reduced the amplitude of peak sodium current associated with step depolarizations from a holding potential of -140 mV. Concentration-response curves obtained with a holding potential of -140 mV were best fit by a 2:1 stoichiometry, and were shifted in the direction of lower concentrations when a holding potential of -100 mV was used. In agreement with this observation, the steady-state inactivation curve was shifted to more negative potentials by chlorpromazine. The block was not associated with any change in the time course of sodium current activation or inactivation during a depolarizing step. Chlorpromazine also produced marked use-dependent block as demonstrated by a cumulative increase in the block during a train of depolarizing pulses. This use dependence was due to a higher affinity of chlorpromazine for the inactivated state of sodium channels than for the resting state and to a very slow repriming of the drug-bound sodium channels from inactivation. These blocking actions could contribute to the antiarrhythmic effects of chlorpromazine at low concentrations and to the cardiotoxic effects at high concentrations.\r"

This binding was inhibited in a surmountable fashion with respect to AII by the peptide analogs sarcosine1 (Sar1),Leu8AII and Phe4, Tyr8 AII when added to the incubation media concomitant with AII addition. With a 30-min preincubation, however, the former inhibitor displayed nonsurmountable kinetics whereas the profile of the latter was unaffected. In rabbit aortic strips with the same preincubation time, the Sar1Leu8AII analog was a nonsurmountable antagonist of the contractile effect of AII whereas the inhibition produced by Phe4,Tyr8AII was surmountable by increasing agonist (AII) concentrations. The inhibitory effect of the former was maintained after repeated washing of the tissue whereas that of the latter was readily reversible. Addition of Phe4,Tyr8AII to the bath 5 min before preincubation protected the tissue from the prolonged AII inhibition by Sar1,Leu8AII. These findings indicate different kinetic modes of AII inhibition by these two antagonists. Phe4,Tyr8AII behaves as a reversible, competitive inhibitor of AII binding, whereas Sar1,Leu8AII combines with the AII receptor in a slowly dissociable manner and is therefore not readily displaced by AII.\r"

Cl- was substituted to varying degrees with the impermeant anion, isethionate (IS-), or the permeant anion, nitrate (NO3-). The magnitude of low Cl(-)-induced DA efflux was inversely related to the external [Cl-] and was greater with IS- than with NO3-. Analysis of the composition of the 3H efflux in terms of DA and its metabolites revealed an increase in [3H]DA with decreasing Cl- concentration. Reduction of external Ca++ from 1.3 to 0.13 mM increased low Cl(-)-induced DA efflux. In slices depleted of vesicular DA by reserpine pretreatment and subsequently labeled and superfused in the presence of monoamine oxidase and catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors, the same inverse relationship between [Cl-] and spontaneous DA efflux was observed. Neuronal DA uptake inhibitors, nomifensine, mazindol, GBR-12909 and cocaine, all increased the rate of low Cl(-)-induced DA efflux in the reserpinized preparation. Cl(-)-induced DA efflux in untreated and reserpinized preparations was not blocked by tetrodotoxin, amiloride, furosemide, picrotoxin or 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid). Low Cl- inhibited initial rates of [3H]DA uptake. At Cl- concentrations producing significantly different efflux rates (0 and 7.4 mM Cl-, IS- and NO3- substitution), DA uptake was inhibited in all cases by greater than 90%. Additionally, the binding of [3H]mazindol, one of the uptake inhibitors, to striatal membranes was unaffected by removal of Cl-. In summary, low Cl- produces a nonexocytotic rapid outward transport of DA. Extracellular Cl- is not required for the binding to transporter sites or for the inhibition of neuronal uptake produced by neuronal uptake inhibitors.\r"

Thus, we measured intramyocardial pH using fiberoptic pH probes in 43 anesthetized open-chest dogs pretreated for 30 min with verapamil, or nifedipine in doses that decreased aortic pressure 10 to 15 mm Hg before ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 15 min. Drugs were continued during the 15-min ischemic period until the animals were euthanized without reperfusion: verapamil, 10-20 micrograms/kg/min and nifedipine, 2 to 4 micrograms/kg/min i.v. Verapamil-treated dogs showed higher pH of ischemic subendocardium after 15 min ischemia (6.75 +/- 0.07) than did the nifedipine (6.48 +/- 0.04) or placebo (6.43 +/- 0.05) groups, even if the animals were paced (6.71 +/- 0.11) to prevent the negative chronotropic effect of verapamil (P less than 0.01). Neither verapamil nor nifedipine changed collateral myocardial blood flow from 0.10 +/- 0.02 in the subendocardium and 0.17 +/- 0.03 ml/min/g in the subepicardium. Left ventricular function estimated by left ventricular dp/dt was depressed 15% by verapamil and enhanced 26% by nifedipine. Thus, verapamil, but not nifedipine, relieves acidosis of ischemic myocardium after acute coronary occlusion in doses that sustain a 10 to 15 mm Hg decrease in aortic pressure. Nifedipine, in doses that produced the same 10 to 15 mm Hg decrease in mean aortic pressure, did not increase intramyocardial pH, as it enhanced contractile function, estimated by left ventricular dp/dt.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Their possible coupling to the hydrolysis of inositol lipids and cyclic AMP formation were also investigated. [(-)-[3H]Quinuclidinyl benzilate [(-)-[3H]QNB] binding to the intact cTB10 cells was saturable and displaceable by 1 microM atropine sulfate. The Kd and maximum binding values of (-)-[3H]QNB from saturation studies were 12 pM and 17 fmol/10(6) cells, respectively. Inhibition studies of (-)-[3H]QNB binding to intact cTB10 cells suggested that these muscarinic receptors are of the M1 type defined by their high affinity for pirenzepine and low affinity for AF-DX 116 [11-[2-diethylamino methyl-1-piperidinylacetyl]-5,11-dihydro-6H-pyrido(2,3-b) (1,4)benzodiazepine-6-one]. The muscarinic agonist carbachol stimulated [3H]inositol monophosphate accumulation in the cTB10 cells, which could be reversed by the muscarinic antagonists atropine, pirenzepine or AF-DX 116. The rank order of potency of the muscarinic antagonists in inhibiting carbachol-stimulated [3H]inositol monophosphate accumulation was atropine greater than pirenzepine greater than AF-DX 116, in agreement with that from ligand/(-)-[3H]QNB competition experiments. Pertussis toxin and 4 beta-phorbol, 12-beta-myristate, 13-alpha-acetate reduced carbachol-stimulated [3H]inositol monophosphate accumulation. Prostaglandin E1 stimulated cyclic AMP formation in the cTB10 cells. Carbachol at the concentration of 10 mM exhibited no stimulatory or inhibitor effect on the basal or prostaglandin E1-stimulated cyclic AMP formation. These results suggest that the muscarinic receptors encoded by the transfected m1 gene in the cTB10 cells are of the M1 type and are coupled to the hydrolysis of inositol lipids, possibly via a pertussis toxin sensitive G protein.\r"

All four compounds produced vasopressor responses in beta adrenoceptor blocked (propranolol, 3 mg/kg i.v.) animals. The pressor responses produced by all four compounds were antagonized by the selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin (0.1 mg/kg i.v.), and were relatively unaffected by the selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist, rauwolscine (0.5 mg/kg i.v.), indicating that vasoconstriction produced by the fluorinated imidazolines was mediated exclusively by postjunctional vascular alpha-1 adrenoceptors. The rank order of potency at the alpha-1 adrenoceptor was: 5-fluoro greater than 2-fluoro greater than desfluoro greater than 6-fluoro. At higher doses, 3,4-dihydroxytolazoline and its fluorinated derivatives produced an alpha-2 adrenoceptor-mediated inhibition of neurogenic tachycardia in animals pretreated with prazosin, with all four compounds being equipotent.

The interaction of light and NaNO2 in producing relaxations was studied in a perfusion-superfusion system in which Krebs' solution (37 degrees C, 95% O2-5% CO2) with or without added NaNO2 was perfused (2 ml/min) through a glass tube (1.25 mm, inside diameter) on its way to superfusing an endothelium-free aortic ring a few seconds downstream. UV irradiation either of the solution flowing through the tube or of the aortic ring could be made separately. The ring, mounted for tension recording, was precontracted to a similar level of tone in the absence or presence of NaNO2 by l-phenylephrine HCl. Photorelaxation on direct irradiation of the ring was potentiated markedly by 1 mM NaNO2, was not significantly potentiated further by 10 U/ml of superoxide dismutase, and was inhibited markedly by Hb (1-10 microM) but not by MetHb (10 microM). Irradiation of the perfusing solution produced no relaxation of the aortic ring downstream in the absence of NaNO2, and only small relaxation at 1 mM NaNO2. When superoxide dismutase was present along with NaNO2, irradiation of the perfusing solution (15-120 sec) produced marked relaxation, with magnitude increasing with concentration of NaNO2 (1 microM-1 mM).

  ".W": "These studies were performed in vitro to investigate the nature of the second messenger for lower esophageal sphincter (LES) smooth muscle relaxation in response to electrical field stimulation (EFS) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). It was seen that VIP, permeant derivatives of the cyclic nucleotide 8-bromo cyclic GMP (BrcGMP) and 8-bromo cyclic AMP (8-BrcAMP), the guanylate cyclase stimulant sodium nitroprusside (SNP), the adenylate cyclase stimulant forskolin, M&B 22,948 (cGMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor) and SK&F 94,120 (cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor) caused dose-dependent and tetrocotoxin resistant fall in LES tension. Guanylate cyclase inhibitor methylene blue (MB) (3 x 10(-5) M), caused significant antagonism of fall in LES tension by SNP without modifying the inhibitory response of forskolin. The possible adenylate cyclase inhibitor N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) (1 x 10(-4) M), on the other hand, caused significant antagonism of fall in LES tension by forskolin without any effect on that caused by SNP. The inhibitory responses of 8-BrcGMP and 8-BrcAMP were not modified by MB or NEM. NEM (1 x 10(-4) M) and MB (3 x 10(-5) M) caused significant inhibition of the fall in LES tension with EFS. NEM also caused inhibition of fall in LES tension by VIP. Furthermore, SK&F 94,120 and not M&B 22,948 caused significant potentiation of fall in LES tension by EFS. From these results we conclude that: 1) cAMP and cGMP may act as second messengers for LES relaxation with EFS and VIP, and 2) VIP may act primarily via cAMP system and remains a strong possibility for one of the inhibitory neurotransmitters in the LES.\r"

  ".W": "In membranes from the rat cerebral cortex, the benzothiazepine [3H]diltiazem and the dihydropyridine [3H]nitrendipine label distinct but allosterically interacting calcium channel antagonist recognition sites. In the present study we evaluated the relationship between Ca++ and calcium channel antagonists binding sites within the voltage-dependent Ca++ channel. [3H]Nitrendipine binding to the rat cerebral cortex at 37 degrees C is not inhibited by Ca++, studied as CaCl2, in concentrations up to 10 mM. In contrast, [3H]diltiazem binding under these conditions is inhibited by Ca++ with an IC50 of 0.31 mM. The inhibition of diltiazem binding by Ca++ is reflected in an increase in the EC50 of diltiazem for enhancement of [3H]nitrendipine binding at 37 degrees C but not in the magnitude of its maximal heterotropic positive cooperative effect. Similarly, Ca++ increases the IC50 of verapamil for inhibition of [3H]nitrendipine binding at 37 degrees C without affecting the magnitude of its heterotropic negative cooperative effect. Schild analyses of these data indicate that Ca++ is an essentially competitive antagonist of the allosteric effects of diltiazem (KB = 0.32 mM) and verapamil (KB = 0.33 mM). At 0 degrees C, Ca++ is a negative allosteric inhibitor of the [3H]nitrendipine binding site (IC50 = 0.1 mM) and selectively increases the IC50 of diltiazem and verapamil for the inhibition of [3H]nitrendipine binding to membranes from the rat cerebral cortex. It may thus be suggested that the diltiazem and verapamil recognition sites are closely linked or identical with Ca++ binding site within the slow voltage-dependent Ca++ channel.\r"

Addition of ouabain (5 x 10(-8) to 5 x 10(-6) M) to cultured myocytes exposed to balanced buffered salt solution (BSS) caused a transient increase in [Ca++]i, followed by slow oscillations for about 10 min, and by an elevated steady state level of [Ca++]i thereafter. Concentrations of ouabain between 10(-7) and 5 x 10(-7) M caused an increase in the amplitude of systolic motion (ASM) whereas concentrations above 10(-6) caused a decrease in the ASM, an increase in the beating frequency and an upward shift of the base line, indicating impaired relaxation. When ouabain was added to cardiac myocytes exposed to Ca++-free BSS the increase in [Ca++]i was not observed, but only a transient decrease. To investigate the effect of [K+]o on the ouabain-induced changes in [Ca++]i, ouabain was added to cells exposed to BSS containing low K+ concentration (1 mM instead of 5 mM in balanced BSS). In this medium the increase in ASM by ouabain was similar to that in balanced BSS. Addition of ouabain caused a transient decrease in [Ca++]i. There was no initial increase in [Ca++]i and the steady state level of [Ca++]i was not elevated as compared with the same cells before the addition of ouabain. Similar results were observed in cells loaded with quin2 or with fura2. In view of these results the mechanism of action of ouabain on cardiac myocytes is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The mode of action of i.v. injected ketanserin, LY 53857 and other 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT2) receptor antagonists in lowering blood pressure was examined in anesthetized and pithed spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). In pithed SHR, LY 53857 (1 mg kg-1) had no effect on alpha-1 or alpha-2 adrenoceptors, but ketanserin (1 mg kg-1) had some potency as an alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist, being approximately 100 times less potent than prazosin. Both ketanserin and LY 53857 (0.01 mg kg-1) markedly antagonized the pressor response to 5-HT. In pentobarbitone-anesthetized SHR, ketanserin and LY 53857 (1 mg kg-1) were equieffective at lowering diastolic blood pressure (DBP) subsequent to prazosin (1 mg kg-1), although ketanserin (1 mg kg-1) was more effective at lowering DBP in the absence of prazosin. The blood pressure lowering effects of LY 53857 were unaffected by the peripherally acting 5-HT2 receptor antagonist BW 501C. Neither LY 53857 nor ketanserin lowered DBP in pithed rats. It is concluded that ketanserin in high doses lowers DBP in anesthetized SHR partly by alpha-1 adrenoceptor blockade, but that ketanserin and LY 53857 in high doses have additional blood pressure lowering properties, unrelated to peripheral 5-HT2 receptor blockade.\r"

In the present study, the effect of increasing doses of tertatolol (0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 mg) was examined in different groups of anesthetized rats and the results compared with injection of the vehicle. Bolus i.v. injections of tertatolol resulted in a dose-related elevation of urine volume (UV), from 4.1 +/- 0.3 to 6.0 +/- 0.4, 10.2 +/- 1.3, 13.8 +/- 1.2, 18.8 +/- 1.9 and 16.4 +/- 1.8 microliters/min, respectively. Similarly, urine Na increased from 0.4 +/- 0.1 to 0.8 +/- 0.2, 1.2 +/- 0.2, 2.2 +/- 0.3, 3.4 +/- 0.7 and 2.9 +/- 0.6 mueq/min. These changes were associated with a progressive rise in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from a mean control value of 1.15 +/- 0.10 to 1.28 +/- 0.09, 1.41 +/- 0.07, 1.50 +/- 0.10, 1.62 +/- 0.16 and 1.48 +/- 0.07 ml/min. No change in urinary phosphate excretion was observed. In a separate group of studies, the effect of tertatolol was compared with propranolol (1 mg): the maximal elevation on UV and urine Na was less than 25% of that obtained with tertatolol. Elevation of GFR was also 30% higher in animals receiving tertatolol. The effect of tertatolol on UV and urine Na resulted in part from the rise in GFR but also from tubular inhibition of Na transport, since fractional Na excretion increased from 0.24 +/- 0.09 to a maximal value of 1.76 +/- 0.10%. This tubular action presumably occurs beyond the proximal nephron, because no effect on urinary phosphate excretion was obtained during tertatolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Many studies have shown tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) to potentiate morphine analgesia, but more recent work, using different modes of administration, has revealed inhibition of morphine analgesia by TCAs. The influence of different modes of administration of clomipramine (CMI) on morphine analgesia assessed by the hot-plate test was studied in mice. The administration procedure was based on the pharmacokinetic parameters of CMI determined in the strain used. Acute and chronic (i.e., every half-life of 130 min for five half-lives) administration of CMI (10 or 20 mg/kg i.p.) had opposite effects; the former potentiated morphine analgesia and the latter inhibited it. Five closely repeated administrations (i.e., every 40 min) suppressed the potentiation without producing inhibition. The time course of the influence of CMI showed that the inhibition of morphine analgesia observed after repeated administration of a given dose of CMI occurred if the latter was present for sufficient time; this time decreased when the dose of CMI was increased. Moreover, comparison with literature data shows the importance of standardized patterns of repeated administration: the variability in the frequency of repeated administration and in the time-lag between the last injection of TCA and the test may account for the varying results observed. The discrepancies in the literature regarding TCA/morphine interaction are thus only apparent, and arise merely from varying conditions. Possible mechanisms for the CMI-morphine interaction are discussed: involvement of opiate receptors and/or the serotonergic system.\r"

RNS at 1,2 and 3 Hz (1 msec duration, 10-20 V) for 1 min decreased renal blood flow (RBF) and increased both the renal venous NE concentration (NEC) and calculated renal NE efflux (NEE). The RBF responses to 2 and 3 Hz RNS and NEC responses to 1, 2 and 3 Hz RNS during intrarenal arterial infusion of yohimbine (1.0 micrograms/kg/min) were greater than those observed during the control period. The NEE responses to 1 and 2 Hz RNS, but not to 3 Hz RNS, were also potentiated by the yohimbine infusion. Prazosin treatment (0.2 mg/kg i.v.) attenuated the RBF responses. Subsequent infusion of yohimbine potentiated both the NEC and NEE responses to 1, 2 and 3 Hz RNS in this alpha-1 adrenoceptor-blocked state. These results suggest that an alpha-2 adrenoceptor-mediated inhibitory mechanism of neural NE release exists in the dog kidney, which can be activated by endogenously released catecholamines to modulate the neural control of renal hemodynamics. Alpha-1 adrenoceptor-mediated renal vasoconstriction may affect the evaluation of neural NE release by NEE when high-frequency RNS is applied during inhibition of the alpha-2 adrenoceptor-mediated mechanism.\r"

The actions of estradiol (E2), progesterone (P) and various progestins were investigated. The effects of E2 were reproduced with 5 micrograms/animal: a 2-fold increase in activated ER level in the nucleus at 30 min, 2-fold stimulation of cytosolic ER replenishment at 48 hr and a 4-fold induction of PgR synthesis at 48 hr. The negative regulatory effects of P were also reproduced at doses ranging from 0.25 to 2 mg/animal: inhibition of basal and E2-stimulated cytosolic ER replenishment and inhibition of E2-induced PgR synthesis. NOM-Ac reproduced these negative regulatory effects. The 50% effective doses in reducing estrogen receptor levels and the corresponding potencies relative to P showed NOM-Ac to be 2.4-fold more active than P and to present, when compared to the other progestins, the highest antiestrogenic capacity. Furthermore, in contrast with norethisterone acetate, a 19-nor-testosterone derivative, it was completely devoid of estrogenic potency.\r"

The thoracic aorta was unresponsive whereas the portal vein and pulmonary artery exhibited concentration-dependent relaxing responses to FMLP (1-100 nM). FMLP-induced relaxations developed over several minutes and occurred after a latency of 30 to 40 sec. An inconsistent, brief and small contractile phase preceded the relaxations in some tissues. Stable responses to FMLP could be obtained repeatedly at 1.5-hr intervals. On both the portal vein and the pulmonary artery, the structure-activity relationship of peptides related to FMLP was similar to the one reported for activating phagocytic leukocytes. The peptide Boc-Phe-D-Leu-Phe-D-Leu-Phe behaved as a competitive antagonist of FMLP-induced relaxations with a calculated pA2 of 7.5 on both types of responsive vessels. Indomethacin inhibited the relaxations completely on the pulmonary artery and partially on the portal vein. FMLP-induced vasorelaxations were unaffected by a platelet-activating factor antagonist, BN 52021, or a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, L-651,392. Removal of the endothelium did not prevent the relaxant response to FMLP. The release of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha in the bathing fluid of portal vein and pulmonary artery exposed to FMLP was demonstrated using a radioimmunoassay. FMLP relaxed rabbit vascular strips in a blood-free environment by releasing secondary mediators tentatively identified as prostaglandins; however, a component of the relaxation in the portal vein was not mediated by cyclooxygenase products.\r"

The tissue extraction of [14C] warfarin relative to [3H]water was determined by intracarotid injection technique in male Wistar rats. The tissue extraction of warfarin varied inversely with the concentration of added serum protein, (HSA and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein), and addition of palmitic acid to HSA diminished the extraction. The fraction of drug uptaked by tissue (tissue available fraction) was always dramatically greater than the in vitro free drug fraction, and this was interpreted as an enhanced in vivo drug dissociation from the binding protein. The fraction of drug uptake by salivary gland was closer to the in vitro free fraction than the fraction of drug uptake by brain tissue. The addition of palmitic acid to HSA induced parallel changes in the in vitro free fraction of warfarin and in the brain tissue or salivary gland extraction of warfarin. These data indicate that a part of protein-bound warfarin (as determined in vitro) is available for tissue extraction via an enhanced in vivo dissociation of the drug-protein complex in the tissue microcirculation. The in vitro data were fitted to a saturable model of binding whereas the in vivo data could satisfactorily fit a model dealing with a nonsaturable model of binding, and this is probably the result of the several-fold increase in the in vivo dissociation constant.\r"

A single injection of nicotine (1 mg/kg s.c.) to urethane-anesthetized time-pregnant dams at gestational day (GD) 21 increased dopamine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid (determined by radioenzymatic assay and high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, respectively) in male and female fetal forebrain within 30 min. No significant change was seen in norepinephrine (NE) and MOPEG, but the MOPEG/NE ratio increased in male fetuses. After the administration of nicotine by an osmotic minipump (0.25 mg/kg x hour or vehicle for controls) between GD 12 and 18/19, MOPEG was elevated at GD 18 and reduced at postnatal day (PN) 15 in both sexes; the reduction persisted in males until adulthood (2.5 months). 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid was affected by chronic drug treatment only in males with an increase at GD 18 and PN 15 and a decrease in adulthood. In contrast, homovanillic acid was reduced in adult offspring of both sexes. Male NE and dopamine of both sexes was above control level at PN 15. Cross-fostering data demonstrate that the changes were due to prenatal influences. The observations indicate that central fetal catecholamine systems are responsive to acute administration of nicotine and that chronic prenatal exposure to the drug results in persistent alterations in the functional state of these neurons. The drug-induced pattern of neurochemical alterations changes during ontogeny until adulthood; it depends upon the sex of the offspring.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of stimulatory action of histamine on gastric alkaline secretion was investigated in anesthetized rats. Intravenous infusion of histamine (2-8 mg/kg/hr) dose-dependently stimulated acid secretion and in the presence of omeprazole (60 mg/kg), an H+/K+-adenosine triphosphatase inhibitor, produced an increase of gastric but not duodenal alkaline secretion; the degree of gastric alkalinization was also dependent on the dose of histamine, reaching the maximal values of approximately 1.0 microEq/10 min. Cimetidine (100 mg/kg s.c.) significantly inhibited both acid and alkaline secretory responses caused by histamine, whereas indomethacin (5 mg/kg s.c.) significantly prevented the increased alkaline secretion caused by histamine as well as mucosal acidification (100 mM HCl for 10 min). Tripelennamine (10 mg/kg s.c.) had no effect on either acid or alkaline secretion. Histamine (8 mg/kg/hr) reduced the arterial blood pressure (25.3%) and increased the mucosal vascular permeability in the stomach as determined by Evans blue (160%), but these vascular responses were significantly prevented only by tripelennamine, excluding the possible contribution of the vascular effects to the increased gastric alkaline secretion. These results suggest that histamine may stimulate gastric alkaline secretion as well as acid secretion, and the mechanism of histamine-induced alkaline secretion may involve both endogenous prostaglandins and stimulation of H2-receptors.\r"

AG-1749 (1-100 microM) inhibited the K+-stimulated ATP hydrolysis and vesicular accumulation of H+. AG-1749 bound to the microsomes concentration-dependently and decreased the number of free SH groups; the binding correlating with the enzyme inhibition. Both the binding and inhibition were antagonized by dithiothreitol. N-ethylmaleimide inhibited the (H+ + K+)-ATPase and decreased the binding of [14C]AG-1749 to the microsomes. The inhibitory effect of AG-1749 gradually increased with incubation time, and was enhanced by lowering the pH. AG-2000 and AG-1812, acid-induced rearrangement products of AG-1749, inhibited (H+ + K+)-ATPase potently, rapidly and independently of pH; the inhibition was antagonized by dithiothreitol. We propose that AG-1749 is transformed into its active forms within the acidic compartment of the parietal cells and that the active compounds inhibit (H+ + K+)-ATPase activity by reacting with the SH groups of the enzyme.\r"

Physostigmine and oxotremorine were infused continuously with a miniosmotic pump for 3 weeks, and the performance on several different behavioral tasks was examined during the infusion. In normal rats high doses of physostigmine (4 and 8 mg/kg/day s.c.) produced significant changes in general behavior and impaired performance in the Morris water maze. Oxotremorine (0.25-2 mg/kg/day s.c.) had no significant effects on general behavior or cognitive performance in normal rats, although severe cataracts developed at the high dose (4 mg/kg/day). A deficit in motor habituation in rats with BF lesions produced by bilateral injections of ibotenic acid (30 nmol on each side) was improved markedly by the chronic administration of physostigmine (2 mg/kg/day) and oxotremorine (1 mg/kg/day). BF lesions produced severe impairments in acquisition and retention in a passive avoidance task, an active avoidance and the Morris water maze, which was characterized by a marked disruption of retention. The impairment was also ameliorated markedly by the cholinergic drugs, whereas other behavioral impairments were not affected by the drugs. These results indicate that the continuous administration of cholinergic drugs produces a marked improvement of acquisition and retention in rats with BF lesions, and suggest that the impairment in cognitive performance, especially with regard to retention, caused by BF lesions is due to the disruption of the BF-cortical cholinergic pathway.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between gastric mucosal glutathione (GSH) levels, vascular permeability, gastric motility and mucosal injury caused by ethanol was investigated in rats. Oral administration of 50% ethanol (1 ml) produced elongated reddish bands of lesions in the mucosa with a significant reduction of GSH levels and increase of microvascular permeability. These lesions were significantly inhibited by pretreatment with s.c. administered diethylmaleate (DEM: 1 ml/kg), cysteamine (100 mg/kg) and 16, 16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 (dmPGE2, 10 micrograms/kg) but worsened markedly by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM: 10 mg/kg). Irrespective of whether the animals were treated with 50% ethanol or not, the mucosal GSH levels were significantly decreased or increased, respectively, by DEM or cysteamine, and were not affected by both NEM and dmPGE2. NEM significantly enhanced the vascular permeability in the absence or presence of ethanol (greater than 10%), whereas other agents significantly inhibited only the increased vascular permeability caused by ethanol. On the other hand, gastric motility was potently and persistently inhibited by either DEM, cysteamine or dmPGE2 at the doses which prevented ethanol-induced mucosal injury, whereas NEM had no effect on the motility. These results suggest that 1) the mucosal GSH levels do not relate directly to either development or prevention of ethanol-induced gastric injury, 2) potentiation by NEM of the mucosal injury may be accounted for by its enhancement of the vascular permeability and 3) inhibition of gastric motility may be associated with prevention of mucosal lesions.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies indicate that the new antihypertensive drug, urapidil, acts at the ventral surface of the medulla in cats to produce a fall in blood pressure. In addition, urapidil was found in receptor binding studies to have a relatively high affinity for the serotonin 1A receptor. These results suggest that drugs which bind to the serotonin 1A receptor might exert hypotensive effects at the ventral surface of the medulla (VSM). To test this hypothesis, the effects of 8-hydroxy-2-(di-N-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), the prototype drug for activating serotonin 1A receptors, were evaluated for cardiovascular activity after local application to the VSM. 8-OH-DPAT applied bilaterally to the intermediate area of the VSM in a dose of 1 micrograms/side produced a decrease in mean blood pressure of 60 +/- 7 mm Hg (P less than .05) and a decrease in heart rate of 26 +/- 4 beats/min (P less than .05) (n = 8). Increases in respiratory rate (8 +/- 1 breaths/1 min) and decreases in tidal volume (13 +/- 4 ml) also occurred. These changes were associated with a significant increase in respiratory minute volume (130 +/- 41 ml, P less than .05). Similar cardiorespiratory changes were produced by application of another drug with high affinity for the serotonin 1A receptor, namely B695-40, to the intermediate area of the VSM. Intravenous administration of 8-OH-DPAT in a dose of 100 micrograms/kg mimicked the cardiorespiratory effects of ventral surface application of this agent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The involvement of D-1 and D-2 dopamine (DA) receptors in mediating the DA regulation of preprotachykinin (PPT) gene expression was investigated in rat striatal tissue. Initial experiments determined that acute treatment with the indirect DA agonist methamphetamine induces increases in total PPT messenger RNA, with a maximal effect seen within 3 hr. RNA protection studies established that acute methamphetamine treatment did not affect the relative ratios of the various PPT gene transcripts derived by alternate splicing. The methamphetamine-induced increase in total PPT messenger RNA could be blocked by either a D-1 or a D-2 selective DA antagonist (SCH 23390 and sulpiride, respectively). The D-2 agonist quinpirole, but not the D-1 agonist SKF 38393, mimicked the methamphetamine-induced increase. This D-2 agonist-induced increase was dependent upon D-1 receptor tone, as either co-administration of SCH 23390 or pretreatment with the DA synthesis inhibitor alpha-methyltyrosine blocked the quinpirole-induced increase. These studies provide biochemical evidence for an enabling role of D-1 DA receptors in striatal D-2 DA receptor function.\r"

Midazolam applied bilaterally to the intermediate area of the ventral surface of the medulla in doses of 0.75, 7.5 and 75 micrograms/side reduced tidal volume by -6 +/- 3, -10 +/- 1 and -11 +/- 1 ml, respectively. A dose of 250 micrograms/side produced apnea in each animal tested. Corresponding changes in arterial pressure were -35 +/- 9, -44 +/- 6, -43 +/- 9 and -64 +/- 17 mm Hg, respectively. Larger doses of chlordiazepoxide (e.g., 1000 micrograms/side) were required to produce similar effects. Intravenous administration of midazolam in doses of 1.5 to 150 micrograms had no significant effect on cardiorespiratory activity. However, larger doses of midazolam given i.v. produced cardiorespiratory depression that was similar to that observed with centrally applied drug. Pretreatment or treatment with centrally applied flumazenil or bicuculline counteracted the cardiorespiratory effects of centrally applied midazolam. Most importantly, ventral surface application of flumazenil counteracted the cardiorespiratory depressant effects of i.v. midazolam. Central administration of ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate produced cardiorespiratory effects opposite to those seen with midazolam, and these stimulatory effects were also counteracted by centrally applied flumazenil. These results indicate that alterations in cardiorespiratory activity can be produced by drugs interacting with gamma-aminobutyric acid/benzodiazepine receptors at the ventral surface of the medulla.\r"

  ".U": "89141794\r", 
  ".W": "Experiments were conducted at 37 degrees C to study the kinetics of (a) binding of cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) (CDDP) and of a racemic mixture of d- and l-isomers of trans-tetrachloro-1,2-diaminocyclohexaneplatinum (IV) [or tetraplatin (TP)] to protein [human plasma proteins or bovine serum albumin (BSA)]; (b) aquation (acid hydrolysis) of CDDP and of TP; and (c) binding of charged (aquated) CDDP species to BSA. The experiments were performed at clinically relevant concentrations for CDDP, so that the proportional concentrations of platinum complexes relative to the concentrations of other chemical species in blood plasma were similar to those obtaining in the clinical use of the drug. \"Free\" (unbound) platinum complexes were separated from the protein-bound complexes were separated from the protein-bound complexes by gel filtration chromatography. By use of ion-exchange chromatography, charged platinum species were separated from the uncharged species and free charged platinum species of CDDP were separated from those bound to BSA. Platinum in various fractions was quantitated by atomic absorption spectrophotometry with electrothermal atomization; proteins were quantitated by te Bradford method with Coomassie blue dye. The kinetic data obtained by the application of these methods for CDDP are in good agreement with those obtained by other methods, e.g., binding rates based on separations by centrigugal ultrafiltration. The overall protein-binding reaction of CDDP was consistent with a binding process comprising two consecutive first-order reaction steps: the rate-controlling aquation reaction [half-life (t 1/2), approximately 2 hr] followed by a more rapid binding reaction of the charged (aquated) CDDP species to the protein (t 1/2, approximately 23 min). However, the results for TP indicated that prior aquation was not required for protein binding, and we could surmise that binding of TP to protein proceeds via a direct nucleophilic attack. An unexpected finding was the marked, reproducible difference in rates of aquation between the two lots of TP that we used; this finding suggests the need for cautions evaluation of pharmacokinetic data describing the behavior of TP.\r"

The cytotoxicity of receptor-mediated 125I appears to be sufficient in MCF-7 cells to warrant in vivo experimentation. Furthermore, cytotoxicity not specific to ERs is minimal within the dose range necessary for ER saturation and specific cell killing.

Tumor clones were established from the transfected cells and found to differ in the level of p97 expression. Their outgrowth in immunocompetent syngeneic mice was shown to inversely correlate with p97 antigen expression, and lines that express higher p97 levels elicited a stronger delayed-type hypersensitivity response when injected into the footpads of mice immune to p97. Five clones which expressed very high levels of p97 failed to grow in immunocompetent C3H/HeN mice while they formed tumors in nude (nu/nu) mice. The highest expressing clone, 2A, grew slightly faster than any of the other clones when cultured in vitro. Since several of the transfected clones were found to express a stable level of p97 and have consistent in vivo growth behavior, they provide a useful model for various forms of antigen-specific active and passive immunotherapy with the same agents as those intended for human application.\r"

Seventy-three per cent of the 100 laparotomies reviewed were positive for intra-abdominal sepsis. A discriminant function analysis revealed that eight factors in combination predicted laparotomy outcome. However, the overall accuracy of the discriminant function prediction (76.8%) offered little improvement over the policy in place for performing laparotomies in this group of patients at the participating hospitals during the time period of our investigation.\r"

PASG significantly prolonged the survival time and the time during which a sensory evoked response could be observed. The PASG also prolonged the time before the EEG amplitude began to decrease or a burst-suppression pattern appeared in the EEG. Intravenous infusion of Ringer's acetate did not prolong these times compared to when PASG was used alone; when Dextran 70 was added to the infusion therapy these times were reduced.

Under full anesthesia and after hemodynamic and angiographic measurement, a midline thoracotomy was performed and a 12 m/sec blunt impact was delivered to the anterior surface of the heart in eight dogs with an air-pressurized impactor. Two dogs were sham operated and did not undergo trauma. After closing the chest, the hemodynamic measurements were repeated at 3 hours, 3 days, 2 weeks, and 5 weeks after impact. Hemodynamic measurements included left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and peak left ventricular positive and negative rates of change of pressure. Left ventricular ejection fraction was calculated from ventriculograms obtained with the dog positioned on its right side. All indices of left ventricular performance in dogs that underwent trauma were depressed at 3 hours after impact and recovered gradually to near normal levels at 2 to 5 weeks after trauma. Recovery of left ventricular function occurred in spite of residual patchy scarring of the left ventricular myocardium in the region of impact. No variability of left ventricular function indices was observed over the course of the study in the two sham-operated dogs. The results indicate that blunt cardiac impact can cause depression of left ventricular performance in the immediate post-impact period, but near complete recovery of function occurs within 2 to 5 weeks after the injury, in spite of residual scarring.\r"

During this time seven (19.4%) patients died, three (8.3%) became more independent, four (11.1%) less independent. Life table analysis of discharged patients showed no accelerated death rate in comparison with the normal population. The high mortality associated with burns in the elderly was confirmed. Half the survivors were at least temporarily less independent. Projected life expectancy for the elderly surviving a burn is comparable with his/her uninjured counterpart.\r"

These injuries were characterized by extensive lacerations and contusions, particularly on the dorsal side of the hand and the fingers, with concomitant extensor tendon ruptures, comminuted and complicated fractures, and traumatic amputations of fingers of the dominant hand. The index and middle finger were nearly always injured; the thumb was usually totally spared. The frequency of postoperative complications was low after delayed primary surgical treatment. In this series the mean permanent medical disablement was found to be 12%, ranging from 0 to 50%. The present observations, when made available, alarmed national authorities. In turn, manufacturers were required to equip rotary snowcutters with motorquenchers. This device will probably effectively prevent these injuries in the future.\r"

The frequency of injuries was directly related to the depth of snowfall. Higher temperatures and wet snow were also important. The long and ring fingers of the dominant hand were most frequently injured. A total of 22 digits in 13 patients were involved. Three digits underwent amputation. All patients had fractures, ranging from simple closed fractures of the distal tuft to open comminuted fractures of the proximal phalanx. Injuries were treated with debridement and primary repair. Operator carelessness is usually responsible for the injury. If the public is made aware of snowblower hazards at the time of heavy snowfall, injuries may be avoided.\r"

Before the introduction of the CT scanner, a substantial number of these patients were referred to the regional neurosurgical unit. After having acquired its own scanner, the county hospital took over most of the diagnostic and therapeutic tasks concerning acute head injuries, surgery inclusive. This change in policy resulted in more patients surviving without sequelae, and reduced the average latency to surgery. The proportion of operated patients increased considerably, from 23% to 64%. In a relatively large proportion of the patients, there were complications with continuous ICP monitoring using the subdural bolt. This procedure was therefore discontinued. In spite of the improved results caused by the observed redistribution, the study indicates a need for additional training of the county hospital staff.\r"

To evaluate present attitudes towards subspecialization a questionnaire was sent to the membership of the Western Section of the American Urological Association.

Of those in private practice 16 per cent consider themselves to be subspecialists, although half of these have had no formal training. More subspecialize in oncology, andrology and gynecology than in pediatric urology. Opinions toward issuing certificates of special competence are mixed but opposition to board certification is general. A majority of respondents believe that subspecialization might provide better care for some patients but would increase costs, especially for tertiary care. It would not result in inferior care for patients not having access to the subspecialist. Subspecialization would be expected to reduce the economic return to the nonspecialist without increasing it for the specialist. Respondents believe that it would advance diagnosis, treatment and research in special areas, and improve training and competence but at greater expense. Finally, they express concern that subspecialization may well restrict the experience and competence of general urologists and cause conflict.\r"

However, indwelling stents have an associated patient morbidity and intolerance. A telephone survey of 50 patients (average stone burden 28 mm.) who were discharged from the hospital after treatment with an indwelling internal polymer stent was performed with a standard questionnaire. Symptoms reported with in situ internal ureteral stents included gross hematuria (42 per cent), fever or chills (20 per cent), and persistent discomfort or pain in the bladder and/or flank (26 to 38 per cent). Of the patients 44 per cent reported moderate to intolerable discomfort that was relieved by removal of the stent. The degree of symptoms was not associated with stent composition, style or length, or the presence of a transurethral string. Five patients had premature migration or dislodgment of the internal stent and 4 reported episodes of obstructive pyelonephritis requiring removal of an impacted stent or endourological intervention. Internal ureteral stents placed before extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy have an identifiable patient morbidity while indwelling and, therefore, they should be used judiciously according to the stone burden, renal anatomy and body habitus.\r"

Combined cytometric analysis of deoxyribonucleic acid content and cytokeratin 18 expression was conducted. Of 76 tumor biopsies 38 had a unimodal deoxyribonucleic acid profile with a deoxyribonucleic acid index close to 1.0, while the other 38 showed a bimodal profile: 1 peak with an index of 1.0 and a second peak with an index of greater than 1.0. The 11 grade 1 tumors belonged to the first group, whereas 10 of the 33 grade 2 and 28 of the 32 grade 3 tumors belonged to the second group. Antibody RGE 53 reacted with 4 per cent of the normal bladder cells (umbrella cells), 14 +/- 3 per cent of the cells from grade 1, 33 +/- 8 per cent from grade 2 and 56 +/- 10 per cent from grade 3 tumors. Analysis of cytokeratin 18 expression according to deoxyribonucleic acid content at the single cell level in tumors with a bimodal deoxyribonucleic acid profile showed that cytokeratin 18 was detected frequently in cells with a high deoxyribonucleic acid index but much less so in cells with an index of 1.0. Therefore, expression of cytokeratin 18 can be recognized as a marker of aggressiveness in bladder tumors, since it increases in parallel with tumor grade and cell deoxyribonucleic acid content.\r"

Urinary incontinence may be the pivotal factor that determines whether a patient requires long-term institutional care. For management of urinary incontinence in aged, nonambulatory women use of absorbent products may not prevent decubitus ulcers, while chronic use of indwelling urethral catheters results in bacteriuria and its complications. An effective external urine collection device for women, analogous in function to the condom catheter for men, may improve care by reducing complications, averting admissions to chronic care facilities and lowering medical costs. During 125 patient-days we evaluated 63 applications of an external urine collection device on 7 incontinent women in a nursing home. Each device was allowed to remain in situ for a maximum of 48 hours. Only 14 per cent of the devices required premature replacement due to unacceptable urine leakage. The median device wear time was 48 hours. The only adverse reactions observed were minimal erythema at 2 of 63 device removals and transient periurethral edema in 1 patient, which disappeared with continued use of the device. Thus, this device, exploiting an adhesive developed for ostomy appliances, was effective in maintaining patient dryness and was not associated with severe local reactions. These results appear to warrant clinical trials for extended periods in incontinent women.\r"

A total of 17 patients (16 men and 1 woman) with urinary incontinence resulting from a previous operation was selected for glutaraldehyde cross-linked collagen injection into the region of the urethral sphincter. Before and after implantation patients underwent urodynamic evaluation. Glutaraldehyde cross-linked collagen was injected into the area of the bladder neck or urinary sphincter under direct endoscopic vision. If no improvement occurred reinjection to increase the implant volume was performed at least 3 months after a previous injection. Of the 17 patients 9 were cured or improved. No complications have been reported. This investigation shows that glutaraldehyde cross-linked collagen can be injected into the urinary tract to correct urinary incontinence without observable or measurable morbidity.\r"

Of the patients with postoperative incontinence 2 subsequently were cured with a pubovaginal sling and 1 had a vesicovaginal fistula that was successfully repaired transvaginally. These results support our contention that a vaginal flap urethral reconstruction combined with an appropriate anti-incontinence operation offers a viable and simple alternative to bladder flap urethral reconstruction.\r"

Complete necrosis and fibrosis were found in 25 patients. In 11 patients the retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy specimen showed a mature teratoma. Residual vital malignant tumor was observed in 1 patient. Neither the initial size of the retroperitoneal mass nor the histological status of the primary tumor was predictive of the histological findings in the retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy specimen. The high frequency of mature teratoma raises the question whether omitting post-chemotherapy surgery is a safe routine policy in patients with negative computerized tomography, especially if long-term followup is not feasible. We recommend a post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal operation as routine treatment even in patients with negative computerized tomography.\r"

  ".W": "Fine needle aspiration biopsy has been documented to be safe and accurate for the diagnosis of prostate cancer. A study was done based on 3 objectives to determine 1) whether performing core biopsies and fine needle aspiration in each patient with a prostate nodule increases the detection rate of prostate cancer, 2) the accuracy of preoperative grading by fine needle aspiration in predicting the final pathological grade in radical prostatectomy specimens and 3) the usefulness of fine needle aspiration in screening for unsuspected stage A prostate cancer. Of 203 consecutive patients undergoing prostate biopsies core and fine needle aspiration biopsies were performed in 121. An additional 58 patients underwent prostate biopsies just before transurethral resection of the prostate and 24 underwent radical prostatectomy. The diagnostic accuracy of fine needle aspiration was superior to that of core biopsy (82 versus 74 per cent). Performance of both biopsies yielded a higher percentage of positive diagnoses than either biopsy alone (32.2 per cent versus 24 and 28 per cent). Except in poorly differentiated cancers, fine needle aspiration is a poor predictor of final pathological grade. Fine needle aspiration is not useful in detecting stage A1 prostate cancer. Although fine needle aspiration has several distinct advantages over core biopsies, there is a definite learning curve before its use can be fully exploited. It is important to have an experienced pathologist and to perform both biopsies at each center until sufficient experience is accumulated.\r"

  ".W": "We reviewed our experience with morbidity and mortality associated with clinical local failure after definitive therapy for adenocarcinoma of the prostate by interstitial 125iodine implantation, external beam radiation therapy or radical prostatectomy. Morbid complications included unilateral ureteral obstruction; bladder obstruction and/or incontinence requiring treatment by transurethral resection, or placement of a urethral or suprapubic catheter; hematuria requiring intervention for clot evacuation or fulguration, and perineal and/or pelvic pain. Lethal complications included bilateral ureteral obstruction or bowel obstruction. We treated 108 patients with 125iodine, 178 with external beam radiotherapy and 67 with radical prostatectomy. Clinical local failure occurred in 26 per cent of the 125iodine, 17 per cent of the external beam radiotherapy and 12 per cent of the radical prostatectomy groups. The total incidence of local failure with 125iodine was statistically higher than for radical prostatectomy. Stage C and poorly differentiated tumors were associated with a statistically higher incidence of local failure compared to lower stage and grade tumors. However, within each stage and grade there was no significant difference in local failure between treatment modalities. There was negligible morbidity or mortality secondary to local failure associated with stage A2, stage B1 or well differentiated tumors regardless of treatment modality. There was no difference in the morbidity and mortality between treatment modalities for stage C or poorly differentiated tumors. However, for stage B2 or moderately differentiated tumors treated by 125iodine implantation there was a statistically greater incidence of morbidity and mortality than that associated with external beam radiotherapy and radical prostatectomy. Our observations with regard to selection of primary monotherapy options that provide local tumor control are as follows. Stage A2, stage B1 or well differentiated tumors can be well controlled by all 3 treatment modalities. 125Iodine is associated with local failure-related morbidity and mortality for stage B2 or moderately differentiated tumors, which are statistically higher than for external beam radiotherapy and radical prostatectomy, and therefore, these latter are the preferred treatment. Radical prostatectomy and 125iodine for stage C tumors are associated with a trend to higher local failure, and related morbidity and mortality than is external beam radiotherapy. However, longer followup of the external beam radiotherapy series is necessary to confirm this observation.\r"

We present in detail the pelvic anatomical relationships of a patient with cloacal exstrophy who died 72 days after birth and whose body subsequently was perfused with a formalin-based anatomical fluid. Microdissection of the pelvis with histological confirmation of the identity of structures dissected was performed. The vascular supply to the urinary hemibladders arises from the internal iliac arteries, which pass along the lateral portion of the pelvis and enter each hemibladder. The autonomic innervation to the bladder and corporeal bodies arises from a pelvic plexus that lies on the anterior surface of the sacrum. The innervation to the hemibladders then travels in the midline along the posteroinferior surface of the pelvis before extending laterally to communicate with each hemibladder. Autonomic innervation to the duplicated corporeal bodies arises from the sacral pelvic plexus and travels in the midline to pierce the inferior portion of the pelvic floor posterior and medial to the hemibladders. These nerves then enter the crural region of the corpora. Sensory innervation to the corporeal bodies arises from the sacral trunk and passes posterior to the pelvic floor muscles, traveling just medial to the widely separated ischial spines and then laterally along the corporeal bodies. Illustrations of the anatomy and implications for management of the exstrophy patient are presented.\r"

With the relative relationship of the urethral meatus to the anal sphincter several observations were noted. The more proximal the meatus the higher the incidence of other anomalies and the greater the number of neonatal deaths. Of the patients 30 (60 per cent) had a post-sphincteric meatus located on a peculiar appendage at the anal verge. These patients had the lowest incidence of other anomalies (1.2 per patient) and the highest survival rate (87 per cent). A total of 14 patients (28 per cent) had pre-sphincteric urethral communications (prostato-rectal fistula), of whom 36 per cent died in the neonatal period. Six patients (12 per cent) had urethral atresia. This group had no survivors and the highest incidence of other anomalies (4 per patient). Of our patients 2 had a post-sphincteric meatus and 1 had a pre-sphincteric meatus. In addition to correction of life-threatening anomalies the management of aphallia centers on establishing gender assignment. Bilateral orchiectomy, labial construction and urethral transposition should be done in the newborn period, if possible.\r"

  ".W": "Measurements of IgG and IgA antibodies against common gram negative organisms in pre and post prostatic massage urines were investigated. Lower tract urinary localization specimens were obtained in men with chronic bacterial prostatitis, nonbacterial prostatitis, and without evidence of infection. Quantitative cultures were performed on all specimens. A rapid and simple enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) was developed to measure urinary total immunoglobulins and antibodies to common gram negative organisms (mixed antigen-specific antibodies, MASA). Comparison with a previously developed radioimmunoassay yielded a correlation determinant of 0.89 per cent. Almost all patients had post prostatic massage urinary IgA and IgG levels that were higher than the premassage levels, reflecting the presence of prostatic fluid in the postmassage specimens. In only the patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis, however, were levels of IgA or IgG MASA in the postmassage urines higher than those measured in the premassage urines. This same elevation was found in the urinary specimens from men who could not be diagnosed to have bacterial prostatitis by traditional means on a specific occasion because of antibiotic treatment, inadequate specimens, or bacteriuria, but had chronic bacterial prostatitis confirmed traditionally on another occasion. No detectable MASA were measured in either the pre or postmassage urines of men without a history of previous urinary infections. From these data it appears that urinary MASA may be used to diagnose bacterial prostatitis in situations in which quantitative bacteriologic cultures cannot be performed. These measurements may, furthermore, be used to diagnose chronic bacterial prostatic infection in men who cannot be diagnosed to have bacterial prostatitis when prostatic fluid is unobtainable or culture results are uninterpretable.\r"

  ".W": "The need for effective symptomatic treatment of patients with detrusor hyperactivity is widely recognized. In search of new principles of decreasing bladder contraction we have studied the effects of pinacidil on the isolated human bladder. Pinacidil is a recently developed antihypertensive agent classified as a K+ channel opener, and is believed to depress smooth muscle activity by this action. Pinacidil concentration-dependently depressed contractions elicited by carbachol, low concentrations of K+ (less than 60 mM) and electrical stimulation. In addition it caused a concentration-related increase in the efflux of 86Rb from preloaded detrusor cells. The effects on 86Rb efflux could be inhibited by tetraethylammonium chloride and procaine, but not by apamin, agents known to block K+-channels. The results support the view that part of the pinacidil effect on the human bladder is caused by an opening of K+-channels, efflux of K+ and subsequent hyperpolarization of the detrusor cells. Clinical testing of this new therapeutic principle for treatment of bladder hyperactivity seems justified.\r"

To determine whether the incorporation of urinary macromolecules onto crystals formed in urine in vitro is dependent on the specific crystalline composition, this technique was applied to both uric acid and calcium oxalate crystals. Powdered uric acid was dissolved in urine and the pH lowered to 5.5. The resulting uric acid crystals were centrifuged and the pellet dialyzed against water at pH 8.0. Calcium oxalate crystals produced by the addition of 0.1 M calcium chloride and 0.1 M sodium oxalate to an aliquot of the same urine sample were demineralized with 5% EDTA. Gel filtration chromatography was used to isolate the protein fraction of an aliquot of the urine samples before and after crystallization of uric acid and calcium oxalate. The proteins recovered from the crystals and urine samples were separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Analysis of the gels confirmed that the binding of urinary proteins onto crystals is a selective process and indicate that this interaction is dependent on the specific inorganic composition of the crystals.\r"

  ".W": "Using a pressure flow technique, quantitative analysis of the physiological characteristics of the outflow pathway of the corpus cavernosum was carried out in 19 male dogs weighing 7.5 to 23.0 kg. Pressure flow curves were made on dogs whose pelvic nerve was stimulated electrically and on dogs left unstimulated. When a cyclical change in saline perfusion rate was applied without nerve stimulation, the variable of the intracorporeal pressure showed a large hysteretic loop, indicating that the resistance of the outflow canals to flow was altered by the distension of the sinusoidal space. In dogs whose pelvic nerve was stimulated, the pressure flow curves shifted to the left side in comparison with the outward phase of the pressure flow curve of animals without pelvic nerve stimulation, and this curve piled on the returning phase. No hysteretic relation was observed between the outward and returning phase of the pressure flow curve with pelvic nerve stimulation, but in the detailed analysis, in which the % flow rate was used instead of actual flow rate of saline perfusion, a small hysteretic loop based on the difference of the elasticity of the outlet canals was found. The distension of the corpora cavernosa and the pelvic nerve electrostimulation probably act as the triggers of the same occlusive mechanism in the outflow pathway. The percentage decrease in the blood flow in the outflow canal of the corpus cavernosum induced by the distension of the sinusoidal space or by the pelvic nerve electrostimulation was 69.6 +/- 14.4% (mean +/- SD).\r"

  ".W": "A model has been developed for the study of penile erection in the Sprague-Dawley rat. Anatomical dissections demonstrate a bilateral ganglion lateral to the prostate called the major pelvic ganglion. This ganglion receives input from the pelvic and hypogastric nerves and innervates the pelvic viscera. A large fiber from the major pelvic ganglion courses along the urethra and innervates the corpus cavernosum, the cavernous nerve. In 40 animals, electrical stimulation of either the cavernous nerve or the pelvic nerve resulted in reproducible repetitive tumescence of the corpora cavernosum. Following ablation of the cavernous nerve, electrical stimulation failed to produce erections. Standard mating behavior tests of mounting, intromission and ejaculation in 38 rats showed that surgical ablation of the cavernous nerve resulted in a decrease in the rate of intromissions and ejaculations compared with sham operated controls. Present models for the study of erection have been limited to the dog, monkey and cat. The rat model presented here offers several advantages over these existing models: 1) the cavernous nerve is easily identified, 2) electrical stimulation is easily accomplished and reproducible, 3) behavioral and neurophysiological studies are possible, and 4) animal purchase, housing, and maintenance costs are low. These advantages make this model a uniquely useful tool in the further study of penile erection.\r"

This study compares monopolar and bipolar electrosurgical probes in relation to power losses in urologic endoscopic instruments with the infusion of sterile water and saline, and the power transmitted by probes to tissue correlated to tissue destruction in each fluid. The power losses through each instrument in both solutions were minimal. The bipolar electrode functioned at a much lower power output than did the monopolar electrode. The bipolar probe was also more effective in saline than sterile water. The depth, width and volume of tissue damage for both electrodes were found to vary with generator power output. The data shows the burns had similar diameters for both probes but the bipolar probe caused significantly less burn depth than the monopolar probe. These initial studies indicate that bipolar electrodes can function in normal saline with less depth damage compared to the monopolar probe.\r"

One ovary was then exposed to 1500 shock waves at 20 kV using the Dornier XL-1 experimental lithotripter. One week following this treatment, the animals were sacrificed and both ovaries were step sectioned. We counted all follicles that contained both an oocyte and antrum. These follicles in turn were classified further as being healthy or atretic. No statistical difference in these counts was observed between shocked and unshocked ovaries taken from the same animal. In the definitive study, thirty-one adult female Wistar rats underwent unilateral oophorectomy. These rats were then divided into treated, sham-treated and control groups. The eleven treated animals were given general anesthesia and received 1500 shocks at 15 kV directed at their remaining ovary using the Dornier XL-1 lithotripter. The ten sham treated animals received identical anesthesia and duration of waterbath immersion as the treated group. In contrast, however, sham treated animals were positioned outside the path of the focused shock wave. The control group received no treatment. Normal estrus cycle was maintained in all groups following shock wave exposure. Two weeks after this exposure, all three groups of animals were allowed to mate. All animals in each of the three groups became pregnant. There was no statistical difference in litter size or fetal weights at three weeks gestation. No gross teratogenic effects were observed. The rat ovary appears to be structurally and functionally resistant to the shock wave energy levels used in this experiment.\r"

Eight of 18 (44%) of treated animals had lesions of focal growth plate dysplasia attributable to treatment.

In the group sacrificed at ten weeks, two of six (33%) treated animals had extensive dysplastic lesions which were associated with marked shortening of the shocked limb.

  ".W": "Hyperparathyroidism was described initially in the mid 1920s in patients suffering from a rare and severe form of bone disease, osteitis fibrosa cystica. In the 1940s and 1950s renal stone disease was recognized as a far more frequent complication of primary hyperparathyroidism than bone disease, and approximately half of the patients with primary hyperparathyroidism in clinical series published through the 1970s presented with renal stones. The introduction of routine determination of serum calcium concentration in the mid 1970s has had a dramatic impact on the frequency with which primary hyperparathyroidism is diagnosed in the population, particularly in older individuals with predominantly nonspecific symptoms of the disease. Stone complications appear to occur in less than 10 per cent of such patients. Underlying primary hyperparathyroidism is diagnosed in approximately 1 to 5 per cent of the patients with calcium stone disease. The predominant risk factor for stone formation in primary hyperparathyroidism is hypercalciuria, and patients typically present with moderate to marked hypercalciuria but with only mild hypercalcemia, in the range of 11 mg. per dl. or less. Hypercalciuria in these patients is principally the result of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-mediated hyperabsorption of calcium from the intestine. The pattern of hypercalciuria disproportionate to the degree of hypercalcemia that typifies patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and stone disease reaches an extreme degree in patients with so-called subtle or normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism, in whom diagnosis by routine techniques may be difficult. Parathyroid exploration remains the treatment of choice in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and stone complications.\r"

Total serum calcium levels often are normal in patients with small parathyroid adenomas but levels of serum ultrafilterable and/or ionized calcium usually are elevated in these patients. The recent introduction of improved radioimmunoassays for measurement of circulating parathyroid hormone has led to greatly improved sensitivity of this test for the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism. However, measurement of total urinary cyclic adenosine monophosphate, even when expressed as a function of glomerular filtration rate, is an extremely insensitive test in patients who have parathyroid adenomas weighing less than 1 gm. Consequently, this test no longer is used for diagnostic purposes in our laboratory. Data relating to the prevalence and causes of hyperoxaluria in patients with idiopathic calcium oxalate stones also are presented. Hyperoxaluria (more than 450 mumol. per 24 hours) was found in 21 of 99 consecutive untreated male patients. Approximately a third of the patients with high normal or increased urinary oxalate excretion also have increased urinary glycolate excretion, which is indicative of increased endogenous oxalate production. This metabolic abnormality was unresponsive to pyridoxine administration but preliminary findings suggest that it may be corrected by restricting dietary protein.\r"

The decision strategy for treating stones is not yet codified and it depends on several factors, such as equipment, type and size of stones, needs of the patient and skills of the surgeon. After open stone surgery convalescence lasts approximately 4 to 6 weeks and repeated surgery is more difficult. With endourology convalescence can be reduced to a few days in an uncomplicated case, the risk of complication is approximately 10 per cent and retreatment is not more complicated. Convalescence with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy often is negligible and some extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy units are run on an outpatient basis. However, as with all stone surgeries, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy causes renal bleeding of varying degrees. There are reports of diastolic hypertension after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy in up to 8 per cent of the patients. Retreatment is easy but the late consequences of retreatment are unknown. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy is the dominant means of surgical management for stones in the western world; 87 per cent of our patients are treated with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and 4 per cent with open surgery.\r"

  ".W": "The optimal surgical management of combined aortic and renal atherosclerosis has not been defined. A modified technique of renal endarterectomy performed through the transected aorta before anastomosis of the aortic prosthesis is presented. The surgical course and early follow-up results of the first 44 consecutive patients treated by this technique are reported. Twenty-three patients (25%) had symptomatic coronary artery disease, 36 patients (82%) had arterial hypertension, and 28 patients (64%) had elevated serum creatinine levels (mean 2.10 mg/dl). Primary indications for operation related to aortic disease in 39 patients (89%) and to poorly controlled hypertension in five patients (11%). Seventy-five renal arteries were revascularized; 11% of these arteries were occluded. Revascularizations were bilateral in 27 patients (61%), involved a solitary kidney in three patients (6%), and were unilateral in 14 patients (32%). Aortobifemoral bypass grafting was performed in 16 patients (36%), aortoiliac bypass was performed in 15 patients (34%), and infrarenal aortic replacement was performed in 11 patients (25%). Postoperative complications developed in 14 patients (32%). There were two postoperative deaths (4%). Nineteen patients had transient increases in serum creatinine levels greater than 0.5 mg/dl. Two patients required postoperative dialysis, neither related to failure of their renal revascularization. There were five late deaths, all as a result of myocardial infarction. Renal function improved in four patients and remained stable in 22 patients. Blood pressure was improved in 64% of patients previously hypertensive. These preliminary results indicate that renal endarterectomy through the transected aorta along with aortic reconstruction is a safe, efficient, and effective means of treating these complex lesions.\r"

Luminal accumulation of platelets was assessed by infusing indium-111-oxine (400 microCi) labeled autologous platelets and imaging grafts at 1 week, 3 months, and 6 months after surgery. Image analysis included an indium ratio technique (comparing aortic graft radioactivity to that of an iliac artery) and a red blood cell technetium subtraction technique (excluding blood pool radioactivity from graft radioactivity, with the heart or iliac artery serving as reference regions). Plasma levels of beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4 were correlated with platelet accumulations on the aortic prostheses. Differences in graft radioactivity or platelet-release products were not evident 1 week after surgery. Three months after implantation, Dacron and ePTFE conduits exhibited 87% and 47% (p less than 0.05) more radioactivity with the indium ratio technique than the iliac artery. Similarly, increased Dacron compared with ePTFE graft radioactivity was noted using technetium subtraction techniques: 71% vs 30% with a heart reference and 26% vs 11% with an iliac artery reference, respectively. Increases in graft radioactivity correlated with increases in both plasma beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4 at 3 months (r = 0.6 to 0.9; p less than 0.05 to 0.001 depending on the imaging technique used). At 6 months, differences did not persist. In fact, technetium subtraction techniques suggested less Dacron conduit reactivity. It is speculated that differences in platelet accumulation and activation associated with different graft substrates may prove clinically important.\r"

  ".W": "Many patients who suffer a massive pulmonary embolus die despite emergent therapy. In these desperately ill patients an aggressive, combined method of management was initiated to improve their chances and quality of survival. During a 5-year period 10 patients were treated with (1) low-dose topical, intrapulmonary thrombolytic therapy to dissolve thrombus, (streptokinase or urokinase); (2) anticoagulation to prevent thrombus propagation (heparin); and (3) the simultaneous insertion of a Greenfield filter to prevent the early, recurrent, and therefore potentially fatal pulmonary embolus--\"triple-armed therapy.\" Thrombolytic therapy was administered through a Swan-Ganz catheter wedged against the pulmonary embolus. During the same interval 10 other patients also sustained massive pulmonary emboli but were treated only with systemic heparin. Serial pulmonary arteriography was performed daily. The patients treated by triple-armed therapy responded favorably with a rapid (less than 6 hours), significant improvement in PaO2, pulmonary artery pressure, cardiac output, pulmonary vascular resistance, and blood pressure, compared with patients treated with continuous heparin alone. Nine patients in the triple-armed therapy group survived whereas only six in the heparin group survived. Two additional patients were treated by triple-armed therapy and had thrombolysis with triple-armed therapy with tissue plasminogen activator; these patients demonstrated the most rapid improvement in cardiorespiratory dynamics and arteriographic clearance of emboli. This management protocol shows promise for patients who sustain a massive pulmonary embolus, because it reduces the morbidity associated with pulmonary embolectomy while avoiding the hazards associated with systemic thrombolytic therapy.\r"

  ".W": "In vivo seeding of vascular grafts in dogs has resulted in the formation of a confluent luminal monolayer and increased patency. Results of similar trials in humans have been mixed. Interspecies variation of the harvest, attachment, and growth of vascular endothelium might explain these apparent differences. Endothelial cells were harvested by standard enzymatic techniques from bovine aorta (n = 7), canine external jugular vein (n = 9), and human saphenous vein (n = 8). Growth curves were generated by means of a replicate microwell technique and then compared with the following observations: Harvest of endothelium from human saphenous vein provides a lower yield of viable endothelial cells. When compared to bovine or canine cells, the lag phase of the growth curve of human cells is prolonged and the doubling time in the growth phase is increased. These results suggest that in humans there are fewer available cells, and conditions for endothelial cell growth may be more stringent than for other species. It may be necessary to develop alternative methods of seeding before success in humans can be achieved.\r"

  ".W": "In previous experiments vein graft wall thickening stopped when the ratio of lumen radius to wall thickness equaled that of a normal artery. This led us to postulate that wall stress, which this ratio determines, regulates wall structure. To test this hypothesis we studied the effect of decreasing lumen radius and acutely diminishing wall stress with a rigid, external support. Jugular vein grafts were interposed into the carotid artery of rabbits. The proximal half of the grafts was wrapped with a polytetrafluoroethylene graft. Twelve veins received a tight wrap (2.5 or 3 mm diameter) that decreased the graft diameter, and four received a loose wrap (5 mm diameter) that did not. These grafts were fixed by perfusion after 1 day, 11 days, or 12 weeks. Wall thickness was slightly less in all tight-wrap segments. Total cross-sectional wall area, smooth muscle cell volume, and matrix deposition were significantly reduced in tight-wrap segments. These differences were greatest at 11 days. The observation that narrowing and external support of these vein grafts causes reduction of wall area supports the hypothesis that increased wall stress might be an important stimulus for wall thickening.\r"

  ".W": "Implementation of a protocol that monitored in situ saphenous vein bypass hemodynamics for low-flow states provided insight into the pathophysiologic characteristics and time course of graft failure. From 1981 to 1988, 250 in situ bypasses to popliteal (n = 83) or tibial (n = 167) arteries were performed in 231 patients. Indications for operation included critical limb ischemia in 232 cases (93%), popliteal aneurysm in 11 cases (4%), and disabling claudication in seven cases (3%). Arterial pressure measurements, continuous-wave Doppler spectral analysis, and duplex ultrasonography were used to assess patency, detect hemodynamic changes indicative of graft stenosis, and localize anatomic hemodynamic changes indicative of graft stenosis. Seventy grafts with correctable anatomic lesions (retained venous valves, graft stenosis, arteriovenous fistula, native vessel atherosclerosis) that decreased graft blood flow or ankle arterial pressure or both were identified. Correction of vein conduit or anastomotic lesions comprised 73 (77%) of the 95 revisions performed. Vein-patch angioplasty of a stenosis was the most common secondary operation performed. Graft revision was highest in the perioperative period (10% at 30 days), decreased to 7% per 6-month interval until 18 months, and was 3% per year thereafter. The primary patency rate of grafts not identified to have a correctable lesion was 86% at 4 years, a level similar to the secondary patency of 81% for grafts requiring one or multiple revisions. The surveillance protocol identified grafts with correctable lesions before thrombosis thereby permitting elective revision of patent grafts. Hemodynamic studies confirmed that a frequent mechanism of late failure of grafts was the development of a low-flow state produced by lesions not amenable to revision.\r"

Forty-two dogs underwent proximal and distal thoracic aortic occlusion for 40 minutes with infusion of test agents into the occluded segment. The dogs were divided into six groups. Group 1 (n = 6) served as control. Group 2 (n = 6) received hypothermic crystalloid. Group 3 (n = 6) animals received thiopental. Group 4 (n = 7) received SOD. Group 5 (n = 9) received hypothermic crystalloid and thiopental. Group 6 (n = 8) received hypothermic crystalloid, thiopental and SOD. The animals were observed for neurologic deficit for 72 hours. In group 1, six of six dogs showed complete paralysis. Five of six dogs from group 2, five of six dogs from group 3, and five of seven dogs from group 4 showed complete paraplegia. The remaining dogs in these groups showed varying degrees of recovery. Four of nine dogs in group 5 had complete paraplegia, three dogs showed varying degrees of recovery, and two dogs had no neurologic deficit. In group 6, one dog had complete paraplegia, three had partial recovery, and four had no neurologic deficit. Group 6 was the only group that showed significantly less late neurologic impairment than the control group. We concluded that although cold perfusion, barbiturates, and SOD are not protective when used alone, they are effective when all are used in combination. The combination of cold perfusion, barbiturates, and SOD significantly decreases neurologic deficit after 40 minutes of aortic occlusion.\r"

  ".U": "89141970\r", 
  ".W": "Specific hemodynamic factors have been shown to be associated with atherosclerotic plaque localization at the human carotid bifurcation. Flow field characteristics may also determine plaque distribution in the abdominal aorta. We therefore characterized flow patterns in a glass model abdominal aorta that included its major branches under conditions of steady flow. Outflow resistances of the celiac, superior mesenteric, renal, inferior mesenteric, and iliac arteries were varied to produce flow distributions consistent with rest, the postprandial state, and vigorous lower limb exercise. Flow patterns were visualized with three colors of dye injected simultaneously through capillary tubes at selected locations and recorded as still photographs and by cinephotography on videotapes. Under resting conditions a large region of flow separation and stagnation occurred at the posterior wall of the aorta directly opposite the orifices of the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries. Similar separation regions were observed during the simulated postprandial state but diminished markedly when distal outflow was increased to levels consistent with exercise. In the highly susceptible infrarenal aortic segment, beginning about 2 cm below the renal artery orifices, multiple secondary flow patterns with three to four counterrotating vortex formations were observed under both resting and postprandial conditions but disappeared in the exercise state. Secondary flow patterns were not noted in the suprarenal abdominal aorta, which is usually relatively spared. Such features have been related to plaque localization elsewhere, and the disappearance of these patterns with increased flow velocity during exercise is consistent with the previously noted protective effect of unidirectional laminar high-flow states. The beneficial effects of physical fitness programs may be related in part to these hemodynamic modifications.\r"

Severe arm fatigue (eight patients) and finger ischemia (three patients) were the presenting symptoms. In the remaining 12 athletes, symptoms of hand ischemia were predominant. Noninvasive testing with Doppler ultrasonography and duplex scanning (positional testing and finger systolic pressure recording) and cold immersion were used to aid in diagnosis. In the 11 athletes with thoracic outlet compression, arteriography confirmed the finding with compression of the subclavian artery in five, the axillary artery in one, both subclavian and axillary arteries in two, posterior humeral circumflex artery in one, and subclavian aneurysm in two. Compression of the suprascapular artery was identified in four, the subscapular artery in two, and the posterior humeral circumflex artery in one. Thrombosis of a first baseman's ulnar artery and occlusion of the palmar arch in a frisbee player were documented by arteriography. Decompression of the thoracic outlet consisted of anterior scalenectomy in five, pectoralis minor muscle division in one, and resection of both muscles in two. Removal of cervical rib with interposed vein graft was performed in the two players with arterial aneurysm. Hand ischemia in the remaining athletes was treated conservatively with Dextran-heparin infusion for acute ischemia. Repeat noninvasive study of all players demonstrated absence of compression in their playing position, and all have resumed their playing careers. Hand ischemia in athletes can be evaluated noninvasively and treated conservatively. Resection of hypertrophied muscles to decompress the thoracic outlet together with release of branch artery compression in selected athletes promotes perfusion to arm and shoulder muscles and helps to avoid the catastrophic complication of repetitive trauma leading to sudden arterial thrombosis.\r"

Twelve patients had progressive abdominal pain, three had gastrointestinal bleeding, and one had general malaise. Seven of these 16 patients had previous deep-vein thrombosis. After negative routine gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary evaluation, 11 patients underwent an infusion computerized tomographic scan. Of these, 10 had superior mesenteric vein thrombosis; three of these 10 patients had portal vein thrombosis. Selective arteriography was done in two patients because of gastrointestinal bleeding, and a diagnosis of mesenteric vein thrombosis was made on the venous phase of the examination. The remaining four patients developed acute abdominal symptoms requiring surgical exploration, at which time mesenteric venous thrombosis was discovered. An identifiable coagulopathy was detected in nine patients (protein C deficiency in six, protein S deficiency in two, and factor IX deficiency treated with factor IX concentrate in one). No case of congenital antithrombin-III deficiency was identified. Six of these nine patients had a past history of deep venous thrombosis. Of five patients who underwent surgical exploration, all required bowel resection. In follow-up, two patients died of intestinal necrosis and a third died of associated pancreatic cancer. Thirteen patients were discharged from the hospital. Treatment of coagulopathy was by heparin in three patients and sodium warfarin (Coumadin) in four patients. Long-term anticoagulation was not instituted because of gastrointestinal bleeding in three and cirrhosis in three patients. Mesenteric venous thrombosis can occur without gangrenous bowel. Diagnosis should be suspected when acute abdominal symptoms develop in patients with prior thrombotic episodes and a coagulopathy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The adjusted risk estimate associated with being a current smoker was 3.42 (95% confidence interval [Cl], 2.10 to 5.57); for having smoked for 5 or more pack-years, it was 2.81 (95% Cl, 1.73 to 4.55); and for having smoked at least 100 lifetime cigarettes, it was 2.21 (95% Cl, 1.44 to 3.39). The adjusted risk estimate (also adjusted for actual cigarettes smoked) associated with passive smoke exposure for 3 or more hours per day was 2.96 (95% Cl, 1.25 to 7.03). Risk from passive smoking was greater in women who were not smokers (odds ratio, 3.43; 95% Cl, 1.23 to 9.54) than in women who smoked (odds ratio, 2.59; 95% Cl, 0.23 to 29.24).\r"

The database of 1004 lawsuits was examined to define the impact of the \"standard of care,\" as judged by a practicing group of anesthesiologists, on the likelihood and amount of financial recovery. We found that payment was made in more than 80% of claims made by patients who were judged to have received substandard anesthetic care. Payment also was made in more than 40% of claims when the anesthesia care was judged to be appropriate. We conclude that in the tort-based system of compensation for anesthesia-related injury, the patient has a high probability of financial recovery for injury caused by substandard care. However, if the anesthesiologist provides appropriate care there is still a greater than 40% chance that payment will be made for the claim of malpractice.\r"

Although nonsmokers subsidize smokers' medical care and group life insurance, smokers subsidize nonsmokers' pensions and nursing home payments. On balance, smokers probably pay their way at the current level of excise taxes on cigarettes; but one may, nonetheless, wish to raise those taxes to reduce the number of adolescent smokers. In contrast, drinkers do not pay their way: current excise taxes on alcohol cover only about half the costs imposed on others.\r"

  ".W": "In 108 patients with nonpuerperal mastitis (inflammatory symptoms of duct ectasia), serum prolactin levels were determined before, during, and after treatment. Twenty-nine patients (26.8%) exhibited transiently elevated prolactin levels during the period of inflammation (mean +/- SD level, 42 +/- 22 micrograms/L) that returned to normal within 4 weeks. Twenty-two patients (20.4%) presented with more severe hyperprolactinemia (78 +/- 56 micrograms/L), and 15 were found to have pituitary microadenomas. In 11 cases, mastitis was the first symptom of hyperprolactinemia. A second group of 83 patients with known hyperprolactinemia and 83 normoprolactinemic controls were interviewed with regard to recent symptoms or past treatment of nonpuerperal mastitis. Sixteen hyperprolactinemic women (19.3%) and none of the controls reported that they had experienced mastitis. We conclude that duct ectasia is due in part to increased prolactin secretion. Thus, nonpuerperal mastitis may be a symptom of hyperprolactinemia. On the other hand, nonpuerperal mastitis may induce transient hyperprolactinemia (neurogenic hyperprolactinemia) of about 3 weeks' duration that is less pronounced than central hyperprolactinemia.\r"

The model indicates that both eyes should be treated regardless of disease severity only when the probability of long-term side effects is zero. As risk of long-term side effects increase, treating neither eye or only the worst eye is preferred for an increasingly large spectrum of disease. With high correlations of long-term side effects, treating the worst eye is preferred for moderate levels of disease severity. For high disease severity, treating both eyes is recommended, even when the probability of long-term side effects is high. Better-informed treatment recommendations must await new data to assess risks of long-term side effects and correlations of treatment outcomes and side effects.\r"

The fetal death rate exceeded the neonatal mortality rate. Fetal mortality was higher among black, unmarried, and older mothers. Fetuses of multiple-gestation pregnancies had an unusually high risk of fetal death. Autopsy reports were obtained for 61% of fetal deaths. The underlying cause of death from the fetal death record differed from that on the autopsy report in 55% of cases. Systematic collection of population-based autopsy data is a useful approach for improving the quality and accuracy of mortality statistics on fetal deaths. Many stillbirths remain unexplained, however, and research is needed to identify pathological markers that might reduce the heterogeneity within the fetal deaths currently ascribed to unknown causes.\r"

To determine mortality rates following NICU discharge, we used linked birth, death, and NICU records for infants born to Georgia residents from 1980 through 1982 and who were admitted to NICUs participating in the state's perinatal care network. Infants who died after discharge (n = 120) had a median duration of NICU hospitalization of 20 days (range, 1 to 148 days) and a median birth weight of 1983 g (range, 793 to 5159 g). The postdischarge mortality rate was 22.7 per 1000 NICU discharges. This rate is more than five times the overall postneonatal mortality rate for Georgia from 1980 to 1982. The most common causes of death were congenital heart disease (23%), sudden infant death syndrome (21%), and infection (13%). Demographic characteristics commonly associated with infant mortality were not strongly associated with the mortality following NICU discharge.\r"

None were restricted from clinical duties, were given varicella-zoster immune globulin, or developed disease. Although only 1 of 38 cord serum samples from normal term infants was seronegative, 10 of 22 neonatal intensive care unit infants were seronegative. The high rate of seronegativity among these patients was related to chronological age older than 2 months and to multiple transfusions of packed red blood cells. This probably reflects natural catabolism of maternal antibody and loss of antibody in serum removed from these infants for diagnostic tests. Infants lacking antibody were given varicella-zoster immune globulin. Antibody levels following administration of varicella-zoster immune globulin were directly related to the dose administered.\r"

The relationship was unexpected on the basis of current knowledge of the condition, but we found the older medical literature documents syphilis as the virtually specific cause of deep funisitis with angiophlebitis. Necrotizing funisitis has a characteristic macroscopic appearance, the \"barberpole\" cord, that permits the presumptive diagnosis of congenital syphilis at the time of birth.\r"

After 50 Gy/25 fractions of 10 MV X-ray was given, all 18 tumors decreased from 3.3 +/- 0.8 cm to 2.0 +/- 0.7 cm. At the surgical operation, 16 patients (89%) received pancreatic resection, without operative death. Histologically, in 13 of these 16 cases, the population of severely degenerative cancer cells (SDCC) was more than 1/3 of all cancer cells, and SDCCs were likely to locate at the periphery (advancing point of carcinoma). These histological patterns were considered as favorable to improve the operative curability. However, in the remaining three cases, the SDCC population was less than 1/3. In addition, nonaffected (i.e., viable) cancer cells were detected at the periphery, and this is an extremely adverse condition for subsequent surgery. Chronic pancreatitis in the noncancerous area was present in these three cases, but not in the 13 cases. Therefore, the most significant factor that predicts the radioresistance especially at the periphery of the carcinoma was considered to be coexisting chronic pancreatitis.\r"

To determine the incidence of preinvasive breast cancer at our institution, the results of 469 consecutive outpatient breast biopsies performed at Walter Reed Army Medical Center between July 1, 1985, and January 1, 1987, were reviewed. During this time period, 256 biopsies were performed on palpable masses, and 213 needle localization biopsies were performed on mammographically suspicious lesions. The overall incidence of cancer was 15.4%. Needle localization biopsies yielded a diagnosis of cancer in 17.8% of cases, as did 13.3% of biopsies performed on palpable masses. Eight of 38 (21.1%) carcinomas identified by mammography were preinvasive at the time of diagnosis. Only one of 34 (2.9%) cancers identified because of a breast mass was preinvasive. We conclude that screening mammography is an invaluable tool for the detection of preinvasive carcinoma of the breast and that the increased use of mammography will result in an increase in the incidence of detection of this lesion.\r"

At present, curative resection is the treatment of choice in peripheral T1-2 N0M0 SCLC, and adjuvant chemotherapy may be beneficial. Surgery is also indicated in SCLC patients diagnosed by a limited pathologic sample in whom the clinical course suggests nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The resection may reveal either a mixed tumor or an alternate diagnosis and may be potentially curative. Surgery, at the time of maximal response to chemotherapy in T3N0M0 SCLC, may be curative and reveal the presence of NSCLC elements. The best survival is in patients found to be tumor-free at surgery, and the worst survival is in N2 patients.\r"

  ".W": "Between January 1967 and July 1986, 171 patients with malignant stenosis of the esophagus and cardia were subjected to curative or palliative surgical treatment. Specifically, there were 84 primary esophageal carcinomas, 5 cases of malignant esophageal stenosis caused by an extra-esophageal malignant tumor (inter alia bronchial carcinoma), and 82 primary carcinomas of the cardia. The average age of the patients as a whole was 63.7 years, and the sex ratio (male:female) was 4.0:1. In 18 esophageal carcinoma patients and 21 patients with carcinoma of the cardia curative resection was possible, but in 132 patients merely palliative surgery was performed, most frequently esophageal intubation and gastrostomy. The specific operations with a curative objective performed upon the esophageal carcinoma patients were abdominothoracic esophageal resection with upward displacement of the stomach (n = 16) or interposition of a colonic segment (n = 2), whereas in the patients with carcinoma of the cardia, proximal resection was performed in 13 cases, either subtotally or as a cardiofundectomy, and total gastrectomy in 8 cases. For the subsequent reconstruction of the passage the interposition of a jejunal segment was most frequently used. The clinical mortality for the curative resections was 33% for the 18 esophageal carcinoma patients and 9.5% for the 20 patients with carcinoma of the cardia. The long-term survival rates are depressing: of the patients who underwent curative resection 47.6% were still alive after one year, 28.6% after 2 years and 14.3% after 5 years. Of the patients treated only palliatively on account of an already advanced stage of the tumor, 91.5% died within the first year; only 4.9% of patients from this group were still alive after 2 years.\r"

The succinate dehydrogenase (SD) activity of tissue fragments was assayed, following exposure to a temperature of 43 degrees C (heat treatment) or 37 degrees C (control) for 1, 2, 5, or 10 hr. The sensitivity to heat treatment was estimated by the percentage of SD activity of the heat-treated cells, compared to that of the control cells. The decrease in SD activity following exposure to heat varied with the tissue. The SD activity decreased to a greater extent in the S-180 cells than in the normal tissues. In the normal tissues, the order of sensitivity to heat was stomach, spleen, large intestine, small intestine, esophagus, kidney and liver. These results show that hyperthermia is tissue selective, hence heat treatment of a malignant lesion should be carefully designed.\r"

The overall 5-year survival rate was 38% and the rates in patients with stage I or stage III were 57% and 11%, respectively (P less than 0.05). Survival rates in patients with the oat cell type and intermediate type were 24% and 44%, respectively, but with no significant difference. This carcinoma seemed to originate from primitive multipotential stem cells, i.e., those of a neuroendocrine or epithelial nature. Histochemically and immunohistochemically, argyrophilic granules and neuron-specific enolase, neuroendocrine markers, were detected more frequently in the oat cell type rather than in the intermediate type. In contrast, keratin, epithelial membrane antigen, and carcinoembryonic antigen, epithelial origin markers, were present more frequently in the intermediate type than in oat cell type. However, the difference was significant only in case of detection of argyrophilic granules and the carcinoembryonic antigen (P less than 0.05). Our current recommendation is that surgical resection should be done in the earlier stage in both subtypes. A more favorable prognosis can be expected when adjuvant chemotherapy is prescribed.\r"

Anastomotic leaks developed in nine previously irradiated patients and three required flap reconstructions. Thirty patients had satisfactory swallowing postoperatively and three swallowed poorly. Delayed gastric emptying was a serious problem in two patients, necessitating pyloric bag dilatation in one and pyloroplasty in another. The average postoperative stay was 31 days. Thirty-seven percent survived longer than 12 months and 15% longer than 24 months. The probability of survival after 2 years is 35%. All deaths from recurrent disease occurred within 412 days postoperatively.

  ".W": "Surgical intervention is generally accepted for acute type A dissection, but little is published regarding therapy for acute dissection of the transverse portion of the aortic arch, though involved in approximately 15% of cases. Often, surgical treatment is withheld if aortography suggests a primary tear in the aortic arch. Similarly, resection is limited to the ascending aorta despite intimal tears within the transverse portion of the arch. This work reports a 9-year experience with a policy of emergency resection for all acute aortic dissections involving the aortic arch. Intensive \"antiimpulse\" therapy is instituted and aortic angiograms are obtained. Type A dissections are resected under moderate hypothermia and, if the primary tear extends into the arch or is not found in the ascending aorta, the arch is explored during a brief period of deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest. If necessary, the arch is replaced during circulatory arrest, the patient's head is packed in ice, steroids are administered, and a barbiturate coma is induced. If arch replacement is anticipated preoperatively, surface cooling is also employed. Sixteen acute (up to 14 days) and three subacute (15 to 28 days) transverse arch dissections were treated in this manner between May 1979 and May 1988, with four (21%) hospital deaths (25%, acute; 0%, subacute). Mortality was related to left main coronary dissection with extensive myocardial infarction in two of our four cases, a third death was related to persistent seizures in a renal transplant patient requiring hemodialysis who had lupus cerebritis, and the fourth resulted from rupture of the descending aorta 15 days after arch replacement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In contrast, there is an uncommon variant involving primarily the upper lobes and the superior portions of the lingula and lower lobes, which spares the relatively normally functioning lower lobes. A number of diagnostic tests are available to identify compression of uninvolved lower lobe tissue, the most reliable of which identify pulmonary vasculature that is crowded together. We suggest that whole lung tomograms or pulmonary angiograms provide the most convincing evidence of compression of normal tissue. In properly selected patients with compression or displacement of normal lung, thoracotomy with simple excision of the bullae is tolerated by even the most ill patients if care is taken to carefully support the patient postoperatively with assisted ventilation and prolonged chest tube suction. There were no deaths in 19 patients and the results were rewarding, often spectacular, and surprisingly enduring. It is likely that some patients with operable bullous emphysema are not being studied or offered operation because of a lack of knowledge about the benefits possible with bullectomy.\r"

All were free of mediastinal node involvement as assessed by pretreatment mediastinoscopy. All received 3000 rads of preoperative radiation followed by en bloc resection of the lung and a tangential portion of the involved vertebral bodies. A complete mediastinal lymphadenectomy was also performed. Three patients had true Pancoast's syndrome and in the remaining nine the tumor was located above T6 with the majority in the apex of the chest. Resectability was based on the absence of tumor extension into the costotransverse foramen and the extent of vertebral body involvement. Detailed studies of the decalcified surgical specimen show that the tumor extended into the cortex in two patients, periosteum in six, parietal in three, and up to the visceral pleura in one. Six patients are alive after 1 to 11 years (four beyond 5 years) without evidence of recurrent tumor and arthritic pain. The overall 5- and 10-year survival rate (Kaplan-Meier method) was 42%. In patients with tumors adherent to the vertebral body and no evidence of roentgenographic erosion, the en bloc removal of the lung and the involved portion of the vertebral body is required for complete excision and is associated with long-term survival without sequelae.\r"

  ".W": "The ultrastructure of blood platelets was related to platelet function and secretion products before, during, and after cardiopulmonary bypass. Circulating platelets from 15 patients undergoing aorta-coronary bypass operations were investigated at ten predetermined points of time by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Simultaneously, platelet adenosine triphosphate, diphosphate, and serotonin, as well as plasma levels of platelet factor 4, beta-thromboglobulin, serotonin, thromboxane B2, lactic dehydrogenase, and free hemoglobin were measured. Moreover, platelet responsiveness toward adenosine diphosphate and collagen was determined by optical aggregometry. By scanning electron microscopy, the number of unactivated platelets dropped from 96% +/- 4% to 54% +/- 19% (p less than 0.05) 8 minutes after the onset of bypass. Simultaneously, the percentage of \"shape changed\" platelets significantly increased. No major release reaction was detected at this time. After the initial activation, platelet morphology began to recover although the bypass continued. During the late period of bypass, a highly significant correlation between increasing plasma levels of alpha-granule compounds (platelet factor 4 and beta-thromboglobulin) and lysis parameters (lactic dehydrogenase and free hemoglobin) was found. However, transmission electron microscopic analysis of the arterial filter and scanning electron microscopic findings of circulating platelets indicated that the release products in plasma were due not only to platelet lysis but also to a limited extent to secondary aggregation. In an inverse and probably causative manner, platelet morphology recovered, whereas the sensitivity of platelets to adenosine diphosphate and collagen decreased toward the end of bypass.\r"

  ".W": "Four to seven percent of infants born with aortic atresia have a normal-sized left ventricle in association with a ventricular septal defect and a normal mitral valve. In contrast to the more common group of infants with aortic atresia whose left ventricle is hypoplastic, this important subgroup has potential for complete operative correction involving both the right and left ventricles. Previous reports of surgical management of these infants have described early palliative procedures to control systemic and pulmonary blood flow. Our approach has been to perform complete repair at one stage in the neonate. Continuity between the proximal main pulmonary artery and aorta is established, a patch on the ventricular septal defect baffles left ventricular blood to the pulmonary valve, and a homograft conduit achieves right ventricular-pulmonary artery continuity. Three of four neonates who underwent single-stage repair were discharged from the hospital in good condition. Achieving a physiologically normal circulation simplifies the postoperative management of this condition and is to be preferred over neonatal palliation.\r"

Mitral valve replacement was performed in 72 patients, aortic valve replacement in 35, and mitral-aortic valve replacement in 23. Cumulative follow-up of 121 survivors is 223 patient-years and 100% complete (range 0.4 to 4.5 years). The actuarial survival rate at 4 years is 88% +/- 8% for mitral, 86% +/- 7.8% for aortic, and 84% +/- 8% for mitral-aortic valve replacement. Minor thomboembolism occurred in two patients (0.9% +/- 0.6%/pt-yr) with an actuarial freedom from emboli at 4 years of 100% for mitral, 96% +/- 3.7% for aortic, and 91% +/- 8.6% for mitral-aortic valve replacement. Anticoagulant-related hemorrhage occurred in 10 patients (4.4% +/- 1.4%/pt-yr) with an actuarial freedom at 4 years of 90% +/- 4.8% for mitral, 89% +/- 5.8% for aortic, and 84% +/- 10.6% for mitral-aortic valve replacement.

A further mean increase of 2.2% in the cross-sectional area was measured 137 days after the dilatation. In five uncomplicated experiments a second dilatation was performed with a 23 mm diameter angioplasty catheter after a mean interval of 140 days. The second dilatation produced a further 21% increase in the cross-sectional area. In the five experiments in which two dilatations were performed, there was a total increase in the mean cross-sectional area of 94% produced 273 days after banding. This prosthesis maintains banding of the main pulmonary artery and can be serially dilated by balloon angioplasty.\r"

A total of 160 patients (91%) were operated on for malignant disease. Operative death occurred in 15 patients (8.5%), and there were three anastomotic leaks (1.7%). The prevalence of dysphagia caused by both benign and malignant strictures after esophageal resection in which the EEA stapler was used was 17.4%. The rate of benign anastomotic narrowing in discharged patients was 12.5%. Anastomotic stricture resulting from recurrent tumor caused dysphagia in 6.2% of the patients undergoing resection for malignant disease. The highest rate of benign anastomotic narrowing occurred in patients who had undergone esophageal resection for benign, nondilatable strictures. In these patients, the prevalence of benign anastomotic narrowing was 37.5%, compared with 9.6% in the patients undergoing resection for malignant disease (p less than 0.001). An additional trend was noted: The smaller the stapling head used to construct the anastomosis, the higher the prevalence of benign anastomotic narrowing; however, a statistically significant difference could not be documented. Ninety-five percent of patients with benign anastomotic narrowings complained of dysphagia within the first 6 months after the operation; 79% of these patients required two or fewer dilatations to relieve the dysphagia. Dysphagia after esophageal resection with the aid of EEA stapler occurred in just over one of six patients. The usual cause of the dysphagia was benign anastomotic narrowing, which responds well to dilatation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The procedure was divided into two separate stages. In stage I the latissimus dorsi muscle was prepared for progressive stimulation. For this purpose two pacing leads were attached to the muscle, one at the proximal and the other at the distal end, and connected to a pulse-train generator, which was placed subcutaneously. A stimulation protocol was initiated in which the requirements of the latissimus dorsi muscle were periodically increased. In stage II the latissimus dorsi muscle was dissected to make a pedicle graft, which was introduced into the thorax and wrapped around the left ventricle. Pacing electrodes were sewn onto the pedicle graft in the same fashion as in stage I. Two sensing electrodes were fixed to the epicardium of the right ventricle, and the four leads were connected to a double-chambered pacemaker. Twelve days later, the pacemaker was programmed to a bipolar mode, VAT, and the latissimus dorsi muscle graft was synchronously stimulated in a 1:1 assist mode. The patient's status improved to New York Heart Association functional class II. Echocardiographic studies showed better contraction of the posterior wall of the left ventricle, as well as reduction in its diameters. Radioisotopic studies demonstrated a significant improvement in hemodynamic parameters. Cardiomyoplasty seems to be an alternative in those patients with severe cardiac insufficiency caused by cardiac dilation owing to cardiomyopathy.\r"

These postulates were examined in thermodynamic experiments that demonstrated three points: (1) The temperature of unfrozen saline solution may drop way below the freezing point. (2) When liquids and solid components of saline solution are separated, the components will become hypo-osmolar or hyperosmolar. (3) Ice chips and slush ice produced in the operating rooms may reach temperatures as low as -36 degrees C. We recommend that the possibility of these events should be taken into consideration whenever topical cardiac hypothermia is clinically applied.\r"

After intravenous administration serum EPO levels decayed exponentially from a peak of 3959 mU/ml, with a half-life of 8.2 h. 2.3% of the total intravenous dose was lost in the dialysate during the first 24 h. Peak serum EPO levels of 375 mU/ml at 12 h and 176 mU/ml at 18 h were attained following intraperitoneal and subcutaneous administration, respectively. The bioavailability of subcutaneous EPO (21.5%) was seven times greater than that of intraperitoneal EPO (2.9%). These results suggest that subcutaneous EPO represents the most satisfactory route of administration for CAPD patients.\r"

Factors commonly believed to be associated with NNT, such as the tool used to cut the umbilical cord and the method of preparing the tool, were not confirmed as risk factors. However, applying ghee to the wound stump was. New prevention opportunities deriving from the finding should be pursued aggressively while efforts to develop effective delivery systems to immunise mothers against tetanus continue, a task made difficult by sociocultural factors.\r"

The literature has primarily addressed its use in the adult population. We present our series of 57 children who underwent functional endonasal sinus surgery. The children ranged in age from 3 to 15 years. Follow-up was from 3 to 13 months. Fifty-four of the patients were treated for chronic or recurrent sinus infections. Three patients were treated for complications of acute sinusitis. All patients tolerated the procedure well, and there were no major complications. We conclude that functional endonasal sinus surgery is a safe procedure in the pediatric age group. Although postoperative follow-up in the series was very short, early results appear encouraging. The technical approach is similar to that used in the adult procedure. The pediatric procedure, however, requires a follow-up nasal endoscopy under general anesthesia to achieve optimal results.\r"

Several studies on visual evoked potential and two brainstem auditory evoked potential studies have shown abnormalities in this disease that are reversible with treatment. It has been suggested that visual evoked potential and brainstem auditory evoked potential could be useful to evaluate the effects of hypothyroidism on the central nervous system and to monitor the response to treatment. We recorded brainstem auditory evoked potentials in 15 adult hypothyroid patients immediately before treatment. All patients were women, ranging in age from 34 to 82 years. Fourteen also had an audiometric study. In five patients, both tests were repeated 20 to 22 months after treatment. Audiometry showed that hearing loss increased with age, suggesting that hearing loss in these patients could be secondary more to aging than to hypothyroidism. When compared to sex-matched controls of similar ages, our patients showed no statistically significant differences in brainstem auditory evoked potentials before treatment. Brainstem auditory evoked potential values were not modified in the five patients whose tests were repeated after treatment. The normality of these results raises serious objections to the clinical use of brainstem auditory evoked potential for central nervous system evaluation and therapy monitoring in adult hypothyroidism.\r"

The procedure was evaluated in 45 subjects, 10 normal speakers and 35 patients with dysphonia. Accurate recordings were obtained in 25 subjects (56%). Problems encountered were lack of pharyngeal descent, electrode dysfunction, and signal interference due to phonatory vibration or interarytenoid activity. Signal validity was evaluated in four normal speakers with accurate electrode placement. Significant (p less than or equal to 0.001) increases in PCA activity occurred during tasks requiring vocal fold abduction. The electrode proved to be a useful, noninvasive clinical tool for recording PCA activity in some patients.\r"

At present, there is no reliable, sensitive laboratory test for the evaluation and diagnosis of subclinical central nervous system involvement of the disease. Brainstem auditory evoked potentials with and without increased stimulus rate have been used to diagnose ischemic lesions in the central nervous system. Brainstem auditory evoked potentials, with and without increased stimulus rate, was used to investigate 15 systemic lupus erythematosus patients, 20 normal participants, and 5 patients receiving corticosteroids for bronchial asthma. A significant statistical difference was found in the net effect of increased stimulus rate in comparisons of the systemic lupus erythematosus patients with the normal group. Brainstem auditory evoked potentials, with increased stimulus rate, demonstrated subclinical involvement of the central nervous system in systemic lupus erythematosus, reinforcing the notion that increased stimulus rate measures are sensitive to ischemic changes, in this case, even in neurologically asymptomatic patients.\r"

The purpose of this prospective study, conducted at the time of Deepawali, an Indian festival of fireworks, was two-fold: 1. to measure the acoustic output of representative samples of toy weapons and firecrackers and the intensity level at critical spectator points from the site of emission; and 2. to determine the auditory status of a cross section of the target population, involving 600 participants from various age groups, before and after exposure to firecracker noise at Deepawali. The average sound level at a distance of 3 m was 150 dB, thus exceeding the damage risk criterion for adults (i.e., 130 dB peak level). An average 30 dB persistent sensorineural hearing loss was found in 2.5% of the target population as a result of toy weapon/firecracker noise during Deepawali. The 9- to 15-year-old age group was most affected. A judicious approach in the manufacture and use of toy weapons and firecrackers, in addition to legal restraints, is advocated.\r"

Although optokinetic pattern tests are regarded as valuable in diagnosing lesions of the nervous system that directly or indirectly relate to the reflex route of optokinetic nystagmus, these tests can be significantly influenced by the intention of the person being tested. The present study revealed that the majority of abnormal optokinetic patterns can be induced intentionally. This indicates that optokinetic pattern tests are of limited diagnostic value, and a definite diagnosis should not be made based solely on the optokinetic pattern test result.\r"

  ".W": "More accurate prediction of the prognosis in women with node-negative breast cancer may improve physicians' ability to identify the patients most likely to benefit from systematic adjuvant therapy. With this in mind, we performed DNA flow-cytometric measurements of ploidy and the fraction of cells in the synthesis phase of the cell cycle (S-phase fraction) on 395 specimens of node-negative breast cancer from our bank of frozen tumors, using the aliquots of pulverized frozen tissue from steroid-receptor assays. The median duration of follow-up in patients still alive at the time of analysis was 59 months. Thirty-two percent of the 345 specimens that could be evaluated were diploid, and 68 percent were aneuploid. The probability of disease-free survival at five years was 88 +/- 3 percent in patients with diploid tumors and 74 +/- 3 percent in those with aneuploid tumors (P = 0.02). The S-phase fraction was not a significant additional predictor of disease-free survival in patients with aneuploid tumors. However, the probability of disease-free survival in patients with diploid tumors and low S-phase fractions was 90 +/- 3 percent at five years, as compared with 70 +/- 13 percent in those with diploid tumors and high S-phase fractions (P = 0.007). Similar differences in overall survival were noted. We conclude that DNA flow-cytometric measurements of ploidy and S-phase fraction can be performed on frozen specimens of tumors and are potentially important predictors of disease-free and overall survival in patients with node-negative breast cancer.\r"

The MTBE was continuously infused and aspirated manually four to six times a minute, for an average of five hours per day for one to three days; the treatment was monitored by fluoroscopy. The placement of the catheter and the administration of MTBE caused few side effects or complications, and treatment did not have to be stopped in any patient for this reason. In 72 patients there was complete dissolution of stones or more than 95 percent dissolution. Among 21 patients who were completely free of stones after treatment, 4 had recurrence of stone formation 6 to 16 months later. The other 51 patients had residual debris, which spontaneously cleared completely in 15 patients within 6 to 35 months; only 7 with persisting debris have had symptoms. Five of the initial 6 patients treated, but only 1 of the next 69 patients, have required surgery during follow-up periods of 6 to 42 months. We conclude that the dissolution of gallstones by MTBE delivered through a percutaneous transhepatic catheter is a useful alternative to surgery in selected patients with symptomatic cholesterol stones. Further study will be necessary to establish the long-term effectiveness of this treatment and its appropriate role in the management of the various types of gallstones.\r"
