  ".U": "89391364\r", 
  ".W": "To investigate the pharmacokinetics and effects of intravenous foscarnet, 13 relatively healthy male patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection and a mean CD4+ lymphocyte value of 0.45 x 10(-9) cells per liter were given a continuous intravenous infusion of foscarnet (0.14 to 0.19 mg/kg per min) for 8 to 21 days. Blood and urine samples were taken during and after drug administration to monitor foscarnet concentrations. Lumbar puncture was performed during the infusion in five patients. The concentrations in plasma showed large variations both within and between patients. The disposition of foscarnet could be explained by a triexponential equation (t1/2 lambda 1, 0.40 to 2.52 h; t1/2 lambda 2, 3.20 to 16.7 h; t1/2 lambda 3, 36 to 196 h). Renal clearance accounted for most of the plasma clearance, the difference probably reflecting the passage of foscarnet into bone. Up to 20% of the cumulative dose may have been deposited in bone 7 days postinfusion. Foscarnet was distributed to the cerebrospinal fluid in a concentration varying from 13 to 68% of the simultaneous concentration in plasma. Polyuria and polydipsia were recorded in all patients. There appears to be an association between the degree of malaise, including symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and headache, and concentrations in plasma above 350 mumol/liter.\r"

  ".W": "Antibiotic susceptibility testing of two isolates of the Q-fever agent, Coxiella burnetii, was performed with recently and persistently infected L929 fibroblast cells. The two genetically distinct isolates, Nine Mile and Priscilla, are implicated in two different clinical disease syndromes, acute and chronic Q fever, respectively. We compared the efficacies of rifampin, doxycycline, and five 4-quinolone compounds (ciprofloxacin, difloxacin, ofloxacin, norfloxacin, and pefloxacin) in reducing persistent C. burnetii infection of L929 fibroblasts. In persistently infected cells, the Priscilla isolate was less susceptible to all antibiotics tested when compared with the Nine Mile isolate. The most effective antibiotics against the Priscilla isolate were ofloxacin, pefloxacin, and ciprofloxacin (50% inhibitory concentrations of 0.5, 2.2, and 2.5 micrograms/ml, respectively). In persistently infected cells, the Nine Mile isolate was highly susceptible to all antibiotics tested except doxycycline. In contrast, the Priscilla and Nine Mile isolates in recently infected cells were somewhat susceptible to doxycycline; the Priscilla isolate was significantly more susceptible to ofloxacin and rifampin in recently infected host cells than in persistently infected cells. Persistently infected L929 cells were also treated with antibiotic combinations. Although ciprofloxacin and doxycycline had no synergistic effect on the Priscilla isolate, ciprofloxacin and rifampin acted synergistically. Collectively, these in vitro results are in accord with the fact that chronic Q fever in humans is generally not successfully managed with antibiotics. They also indicate that early diagnosis may be essential and that combination antibiotic therapy that includes quinolones may be effective in treating chronic Q fever.\r"

The MIC ranges, MICs for 50 and 90% of the strains (MIC50s and MIC90s), and percentage of strains susceptible for each agent at the recommended susceptible MIC breakpoint were determined for each genus. The MIC90s (micrograms per milliliter) of the agents against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were as follows: ciprofloxacin, 0.063; Ro 23-9424, fleroxacin, and imipenem, 0.5; ceftazidime, 2; amikacin, 4; and cefotaxime, 16. The MIC90s (micrograms per milliliter) against Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter spp. were as follows: ciprofloxacin, 2; ceftazidime and imipenem, 8; Ro 23-9424, 16; fleroxacin, 32; amikacin, 64; and cefotaxime, 128. Against gram-positive bacteria, excluding the enterococci, the MIC90s (micrograms per milliliter) were as follows: ciprofloxacin, 1; imipenem, 4; Ro 23-9424 and fleroxacin, 8; amikacin, 64; and ceftazidime and cefotaxime, greater than 128. Against gram-positive bacteria, including the enterococci, the MIC90s changed only for the following agents: Ro 23-9424, 16 micrograms/ml; and amikacin, 128 micrograms/ml. Strains of Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were 100% susceptible to Ro 23-9424, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, and fleroxacin, while the other three agents showed somewhat less activity only against N. gonorrhoeae. Against anaerobes, imipenem was the most effective agent, while the activities of the other six agents were variable.\r"

  ".W": "To identify common spatial and structural features of amino alcohol antimalarial agents with the eventual goal of designing more effective drugs and a better understanding of the mechanism of action of this class of antimalarial agents, the three-dimensional crystal and molecular structure of enpiroline, a new antimalarial agent active against chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum, was determined by X-ray crystallography and compared with the crystal structures of the cinchona alkaloids and of the new antimalarial agent WR 194,965. The aromatic rings of the phenyl-pyridine ring system of enpiroline are twisted from each other by approximately 18 degrees. The intramolecular aliphatic N-O distance in enpiroline was 2.80 A (1 A = 0.1 nm), which is close to the N-O distance found in the antimalarial cinchona alkaloids. Enpiroline contains both an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the aliphatic nitrogen and oxygen atoms and an intermolecular hydrogen bond between the aliphatic nitrogen and oxygen atoms of two neighboring molecules. One enantiomer of enpiroline superimposed best with quinine, and the other enantiomer of enpiroline superimposed best with quinidine, suggesting that both enantiomers of enpiroline possess antimalarial activity. Since a common feature of the crystal structures of the amino alcohol antimalarial agents is the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds, the common spatial direction of hydrogen bond formation indicates the potential ability of these antimalarial agents to bind to a common receptor site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The otoacoustic emission test has been found to be practical with a mean test time of 12.1 minutes compared with 21.0 minutes for brain stem electric response. An otoacoustic emission was recorded bilaterally in 274 (79%) babies. Twenty of the 21 surviving infants who failed brain stem electric response in the neonatal period did not produce an emission. It is concluded that the otoacoustic emission test would make a good first screen to be followed by the brain stem electric response if no otoacoustic emission was present. There is poor agreement between the test results in the neonatal period and those of the follow up period, however, indicating the need for continuous monitoring of those babies failed by brain stem electric response.\r"

The questionnaire had a response rate of 84% and was found to be highly repeatable with respect to current symptoms. The overall prevalences of wheeze and shortness of breath in the current year (1986) were 12.1% and 8.5% respectively. Social class, home ownership, parental smoking, and presence of a family pet were unrelated to symptom prevalence. According to the parents the overall diagnosis rate for asthma was 9.5%. In common with other studies, however, we found considerable evidence for undertreatment. The symptoms of wheeze and nocturnal and morning breathlessness occurred more commonly in boys, but this sex ratio decreased with increasing age. The prevalences of wheeze and shortness of breath were similar in the two age groups. In contrast, there were only small differences between the sexes with respect to cough whereas, among children without wheeze or shortness of breath, there was a fall in the prevalence of cough from 18.9% at 7 years to 8.7% at 11 years. When controlling for the other respiratory symptoms, wheeze was the only symptom significantly related to parental asthma. The fall in the prevalence of cough between the two age groups is unlikely to be related to changes in asthma prevalence and, when not associated with wheeze, may be an indicator of separate pathology.\r"

Based on current definitions of HIV infection and excluding children under 18 months old as well as those who had not been studied from birth, two out of 28 children were infected. The estimated rate of maternofetal transmission was therefore 7.1%. In children with proved infection, sequential laboratory data showed that hypergammaglobulinaemia was noted as early as 6 months and often predated clinical signs. This observation, in the presence of non-specific clinical findings, was helpful in alerting the paediatrician to a diagnosis of HIV infection.\r"

Significant improvement was noted in all children in terms of weight gain, number of infectious episodes, and days spent in hospital. This resulted in a 49% saving in cost on treatment compared with costs accrued previously during inpatient admissions. Immunoglobulin concentrations, which were raised at the start of treatment were not altered, and T4 counts continued to decline slowly. HIV core antigen was detected in four children before treatment, but all became core antigen negative after treatment was commenced, this effect being sustained in three. Intravenous immunoglobulin therefore has major clinical benefit, and by reducing viral activity may delay disease progression.\r"

There was a clear peak in the number of children presenting from 1971-5, and although the numbers declined subsequently they have remained at a level similar to numbers found before 1971. There was no difference in the mode of presentation but there was a definite increase in the age of presentation over the time period reviewed. Breast fed babies presented later than bottle fed babies (14 compared with 9 months) despite a similar age of gluten introduction. Similarly bottle fed babies and breast fed babies presented later after 1975 (10.5 compared with 7 months, and 18 compared with 9.5 months, respectively). Before 1975 the median age of gluten introduction was significantly less than that after 1975 (2 compared with 4 months) and the age of gluten introduction correlated with the age of presentation. It is concluded that breast feeding and the age of gluten introduction may influence the age of presentation of childhood coeliac disease but no clear reasons for the rise in incidence in the 1970s have been determined. It does not appear that the disease is declining, however, in recent years children have tended to present later in life.\r"

Faecal osmolality and electrolyte concentrations were measured, which gave clear evidence that the diarrhoea arose from intestinal secretion. Rectal water and electrolyte absorption in 10 jaundiced infants receiving phototherapy, in 10 jaundiced infants not receiving phototherapy, and in 10 healthy controls was measured with a rectal dialysis bag. A further group of eight jaundiced infants was also studied both during and after phototherapy to document the reversal of ion transport changes. Absorption of water, sodium chloride, and potassium was significantly impaired in the patients receiving phototherapy compared with each of the control groups. Such impairment was transient, as it was not apparent when the jaundice faded and phototherapy was stopped. These data show that the colon plays a part in the pathogenesis of secretory diarrhoea and that both hyperbilirubinaemia and phototherapy are necessary for such an effect to develop.\r"

  ".W": "In order to study the clinical, serological, and morphological evolution of chronic hepatitis B virus infection in childhood, a prospective study has been carried out. A total of 90 children with a chronic infection were followed up for a mean (SD) of 3 (1.8) years. At the beginning of the study, 61 children were asymptomatic and 77 were household contacts of chronic carriers. Serologically 77 were hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive and 71 of them were positive to hepatitis B virus DNA. The mean alanine aminotransferase activities were higher among HBeAg positive patients than in antihepatitis B e (anti-HBe) positive ones. The most severe histological damage was also found among HBeAg positive patients. The annual seroconversion rate was 14%. A significant increase in the alanine aminotransferase activity was observed 13 (5.6) months before appearance of anti-HBe in the 85% of cases. Among anti-HBe positive patients, the alanine aminotransferase activities were normal in all except three (19%), two of whom had intrahepatic delta antigen. An increase in the histological activity was observed among patients who maintained HBeAg presence while an amelioration of liver damage was observed in anti-HBe carriers.\r"

  ".W": "An attempt was made to identify the less severe cases of precocious puberty and to describe their natural course. A group of 17 girls with precocious puberty and a bone age advance over chronological age of less than two years (group 1) was compared with a group of 19 patients with severe precocious puberty and bone age advance of two years or more (group 2). Mean (SEM) plasma oestradiol concentrations were 82 (30) pmol/l and 164 (21) pmol/l (p less than 0.05), vaginal maturation indexes were 16 (5) and 41 (4), and plasma somatomedin C concentrations were 1.0 (0.2) U/ml (n = 8) and 2.1 (0.3) U/ml (n = 16) in groups 1 and 2, respectively. The time between onset and diagnosis of secondary sexual characteristics was about one year in both groups. After two years' follow up the untreated patients in group 1 had maintained their predicted final height. These changes were in contrast to those observed at first examination in patients in group 2 who had a mean (SD) predicted final height of -1.3 (0.2) and a mean bone age advance of 3.0 (0.2) years. These data show that bone age advance to chronological age, and plasma somatomedin C concentrations measured at initial evaluation are helpful in identifying less severe and potentially slow progressing forms of central precocious puberty.\r"

All but one child, who had a hearing disturbance, showed normal mental development with normal physical and skeletal maturation. Eleven children had normal concentrations of serum thyroid stimulating hormone and no signs or symptoms of thyroid dysfunction; in three children, diffuse small goitres developed and two further children showed relapse with slightly raised concentrations of thyroid stimulating hormone. It is concluded that 'transient infantile hyperthyrotrophinaemia' is a syndrome, which differs from typical transient neonatal hypothyroidism, and that careful follow up is necessary because some children show signs of mild pituitary-thyroid dysfunction in later childhood.\r"

Each was studied for four 6-8 h consecutive intervals following baseline determinations of 3CNAC and NAG excretion. In accord with pilot data, 24-h urinary excretion of 3CNAC (mg) correlated well with exposure product for DCP (min exposed.mg/m3), r = 0.854, p less than .001. A more precise correlation of the air exposure product with urinary excretion of 3CNAC was discerned by using the morning urine after the previous day of exposure (micrograms/mg of creatinine), r = 0.914, p less than .001. Four workers had clinically elevated activity of NAG (greater than 4 mU/mg creatinine) in any of their urine collections after baseline. Nine workers showed greater than 25% increases in NAG excretion when compared to baseline. Dichloropropene air exposure products of greater than 700 mg.min/m3 or excretion of greater than 1.5 mg 3CNAC/d distinguished abnormally high daily excretion of NAG. These data demonstrate a firm positive relationship between air exposure and internal exposure, and a possible subclinical nephrotoxic effect in DCP workers.\r"

No significant change in forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 sec, FEF50 or FEF75 was demonstrated with formaldehyde exposure nor were the baseline lung function results significantly different from those 38 unexposed controls.

However, there are only limited observations concerning re-exposure to O3 at intervals between 24 h and several days. The present study was designed to assess the effects of re-exposure to 0.35 ppm O3 at intervals of 24, 48, 72, and 120 h. Forty young adult male subjects were assigned randomly to one of four groups in ascending order of time to re-exposure (groups 1-4). Each exercised on a bicycle ergometer for 60 min at a workload that elicited a mean ventilation of 60 l/min on three occasions: protocol 1 (P1), filtered air (FA); protocol 2 (P2), 0.35 ppm O3; and protocol 3 (P3), 0.35 ppm O3. In addition to standard pulmonary function measures, specific airway resistance (SRaw); exercise ventilatory pattern, i.e., respiratory frequency (fR) and tidal volume (VT); and subjective symptoms (SS) were assessed. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences (p less than .05) for all groups between the FA (P1) responses and those for the two O3 exposures (P2, P3) for forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1.0), SRaw, fR, VT, and SS. When the two O3 exposures (P2 and P3) were compared, only group 1 (24 h) responses were statistically significant upon re-exposure: FEV1.0, -16.1 vs. -30.4% (p less than .003); SRaw, 20.5 vs. 34.5% (p less than .05); fR, 44.2 vs. 65.3% (p less than .001); and SS (p less than .015).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty-eight other risk factors for bladder cancer were considered along with chlorinated drinking water exposure estimated by METHOD 4. Stepwise regression models included as significant factors cigarette smoking (p less than .001), chlorination exposure (p = .038), and irradiation to the pelvic area (p = .040). Replacement of chlorinated drinking water exposure estimated by METHOD 4 with any of the remaining three methods resulted in models that included cigarette smoking and irradiation to the pelvic area, but not chlorination exposure. Thus, misclassification of chlorination exposure signified the difference between observing and not observing an association with bladder cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Mucociliary clearance was compared in three groups of normal subjects; each group inhaled a different type of aerosol (sebecate, iron oxide, and aqueous) labelled with 99Tc, to determine the relationship between deposition pattern and the subsequent total lung clearance. Standardization for deposition was accomplished by measuring a central to peripheral ratio (C/P) of deposited radioactivity in the thorax. Lung particle retention at 30, 60, 90, 120 min, and 24 h was measured, and compared at each time period to the C/P ratio. A linear relationship between the retention of aerosol at each time period and the C/P ratio was seen among all aerosols, e.g., aerosol with high C/P ratios had less retention of aerosol at a given time period than aerosols with more diffuse deposition patterns and lower C/P ratios. Furthermore, the relationship was similar to that of the more traditional measurement of regional deposition, the 24-h percentage retention. Lung particle retention was compared among aerosols, using analysis of covariance to standardize for C/P ratio. The intersubject variability was similar among all three aerosol groups. Thus, mucociliary clearance can be standardized in healthy subjects by using an initial deposition index, the C/P ratio, with similar accuracy to the 24-h percentage retention, as an index of aerosol deposition. The use of the C/P ratio, however, has distinct advantages over the 24-h retention, in that studies can be conveniently shortened, used with short lived isotopes, and be adapted to techniques investigating lung permeability instead of tracheobronchial clearance. An unexpected finding was the more rapid clearance of sebecate particles, compared with iron oxide or aqueous particles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In each of the five selected patients who demonstrated this association, macular edema had been present for a minimum of 6 months. Also, preoperative visual acuity was 20/60 or less, good macular capillary perfusion was present on the fluorescein angiogram, and substantial reduction of edema was demonstrated on clinical examination and by decreased leakage and late staining on fluorescein angiography within 8 weeks following treatment. Postoperative visual acuity either improved or remained unchanged for each eye. These results indicate that, in certain eyes, grid photocoagulation can lessen macular edema, thus supporting the rationale for a randomized clinical trial to determine possible benefits of this therapy.\r"

The purpose of the study was to compare the additional information gained by measuring the peripheral visual field with two isopters against the time required for this extra examination. The peripheral visual field supported the diagnosis made by central testing in approximately one fourth of all eyes and added additional diagnostic information in another quarter of the cases. In 7% of the total population, or 11% of eyes with abnormal fields, a normal central field was associated with a glaucomatous peripheral defect. Half of the latter eyes had corresponding glaucomatous optic disc changes. The more sensitive isopter uncovered the vast majority of the peripheral field defects. Measurement of each isopter accounted for 22% of the total testing time.\r"

The analysis improvements include (1) use of an individualized convolution (spread) function for each eye in comparing simulated and experimental scans, (2) separation of vitreous and chorioretinal fluorescence, and (3) precise determination of vitreous position relative to the retina. The average reproducibility in six subjects was 23% for permeability and 22% for diffusivity based on repeated determinations separated in time by at least a week. Diffusivity values, but not permeability values, significantly associated in comparisons of first and second determinations, suggesting permeability may fluctuate in time while diffusivity remains relatively constant. The fluorescence at 3 mm anterior to the retina (commonly employed as a measure of blood-retinal barrier leakiness) was strongly associated with diffusivity. In contrast, the anticipated association between permeability and 3-mm fluorescence was weak or absent.\r"

The affected patients ranged in age from 9 to 86 years when diagnosed. Sixty-four (90%) of the 71 patients were followed up by use after their initial diagnostic examination. The median follow-up was 45.5 months (range, 6 weeks to 12 years). Forty-two of the 64 patients were treated with scatter photocoagulation to the tumor surface on one or more occasions for vision-impairing or vision-threatening nonrhegmatogenous retinal detachment. The subretinal fluid resolved following photocoagulation in all of these eyes, and the vision stabilized in 34 patients (53%). However, the visual acuity at the most recent follow-up was less than 6/15 in 46 (72%) of the 64 affected eyes. Scatter photocoagulation, as employed in this group of patients, frequently results in retinal reattachment and temporary visual improvement, but many patients have permanently decreased vision in the affected eye, particularly when the tumor or the retinal detachment affects the foveal area. One third of the patients with 6/60 or better visual acuity at presentation are estimated to deteriorate to less than 6/60 visual acuity within 10 years.\r"

Animals with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis received daily intraperitoneal injections of either preservative-free saline (group 1), catalase (group 2), or glutathione peroxidase (group 3) for 2.2 months after the onset of appendicular paralysis. Following intravascular administration, extravascular leakage of horseradish peroxidase was histopathologically graded as mild, moderate, or severe within the optic nerve head and myelinated retrolaminar nerve. Severe extravasation of horseradish peroxidase was exclusive to group 1, in addition to moderate and mild leakage. In groups 2 and 3, leakage of horseradish peroxidase was infrequent, and when detected, it was graded as mild. Detoxification of hydrogen peroxide with catalase and glutathione peroxidase substantially reduced horseradish peroxidase leakage in experimental optic neuritis, suggesting a role for hydrogen peroxide and its reactive by-products in the pathogenesis of increased vascular permeability of the blood-brain barrier in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis.\r"

  ".W": "Pigmented rabbits were anesthetized and given an intravitreous injection of 0.1 mL of a test substance or vehicle alone. Vitreous fluorophotometry was performed before injections and at various time points after injections. Compared with pretreatment scans, vehicle-injected eyes showed no change in intravitreous fluorescein sodium leakage at 6 and 24 hours after injection. Injection of adenosine (10(-2) mol/L) resulted in fluorescein leakage that was significantly greater than that which occurred in control eyes at 6 hours after injection, but returned to baseline at 24 hours. This effect was significantly attenuated by an adenosine receptor antagonist (BW-A1433U), suggesting that it was mediated by specific adenosine receptors. A nonselective adenosine receptor agonist, N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine, and two relatively A1 selective receptor agonists, N6-cyclopentyladenosine and N6-phenylisopropyladenosine, also caused dose-dependent intravitreous fluorescein leakage. The relative order of potency was N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine much greater than N6-phenylisopropyladenosine, which was greater than N6-cyclopentyladenosine, implicating A2 adenosine receptors. Intravitreous injection of dipyridamole, an adenosine uptake inhibitor, caused enhanced fluorescein leakage, presumably from extracellular accumulation of endogenous adenosine. The results of this study suggest that adenosine may be a mediator of blood-retinal barrier breakdown.\r"

To investigate the usefulness of this technique in the administration of corticosteroids, we performed transscleral iontophoresis of dexamethasone sodium phosphate (300 mg/mL, 20 mmol/L edetic acid [EDTA]) into rabbits at a current of 1.6 mA for 25 minutes. Eyes were enucleated at different time intervals and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen vitreous bodies and adherent sensory retina were collected and sonicated, and dexamethasone levels were measured using high-pressure liquid chromatography. In addition, to study the facilitation of drug transport by cryotherapy, a second group of rabbits were given a single application of cryotherapy (-78 degrees C, 45 seconds) 3, 7, and 14 days before iontophoresis in the same region. Without cryotherapy, the initial level of dexamethasone in the vitreous body-sensory retina after iontophoresis was 139.3 +/- 51.5 mg/L (mean +/- SE) (n = 6) with a half-life of less than 2 hours. In the cryotreated group, the levels of dexamethasone immediately after iontophoresis 3, 7, and 14 days after cryotherapy were 61.5 +/- 31.7 (n = 6), 88.4 +/- 55.1 (n = 6), and 112.2 +/- 32.5 (n = 6) mg/L, respectively, indicating that levels were lower compared with the group without cryotherapy. Our results suggest that a high dose of dexamethasone can be delivered by using this noninvasive technique and that cryotherapy before iontophoresis does not increase drug levels in the vitreous body.\r"

In the retina, ganglion cells and some amacrine cells were immunoreactive.

Four protocols were compared: a single dexamethasone drop, hourly drops, a 24-hour collagen shield presoaked in 0.1% dexamethasone, and a presoaked collagen shield followed by hourly drops. Dexamethasone concentrations in the cornea, aqueous, iris, and vitreous were measured by radioassay at six time intervals, and cumulative drug delivery over 6 hours was calculated for each tissue. Treatment with a presoaked collagen shield plus hourly drops resulted in peak and cumulative drug delivery to the cornea, aqueous, iris, and vitreous that was twofold to fourfold higher than delivery achieved with hourly drops alone. A presoaked shield by itself yielded equivalent or superior peak and cumulative drug delivery compared with a regimen of hourly drops. Collagen shields significantly enhance topical dexamethasone penetration and may be useful for maximizing the intraocular delivery of dexamethasone and for decreasing the required frequency of topical dexamethasone administration.\r"

The screening tests included in this analysis were fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin (FA) concentration, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), total leukocyte count, serum albumin level, hemoglobin concentration, and qualitative testing of stool for the presence of blood. Of the 24 patients, 21 had abnormal FA values, 17 had anemia, 19 had an increased ESR, 14 had hypoalbuminemia, rectal bleeding was found in 8, and none had leukocytosis. All 24 patients had at least one abnormal screening test value; the most frequently abnormal result was the FA concentration. Pediatric patients without elevated FA values, anemia, a high ESR, bloody stools, or hypoalbuminemia are unlikely to have active Crohn's disease.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of immunologic parameters on the clinical course of malignant melanoma is increasingly evident. However, it is not known which factors contribute to the immunologic host reaction against malignant melanoma. Because epidermal cells and, in particular, normal as well as transformed keratinocytes recently have been demonstrated to release various immunomodulating cytokines, the capacity of melanoma cells to produce interleukin-1 (IL-1) was examined. Accordingly, supernatants derived from different melanoma cell lines contained significant levels of IL-1 activity. Upon high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) gel filtration, melanoma cell-derived IL-1 (MEL-IL-1) exhibited molecular weight heterogeneity, and HPLC chromatofocusing revealed major activity at pH 5.0 and minor activity at pH 7.0. A monoclonal antibody directed against monocyte-derived IL-1 blocked MEL-IL-1 activity significantly and was able to precipitate four species of biosynthetically radiolabeled MEL-IL-1 (25, 17, 6, and 4 kilodaltons), suggesting that MEL-IL-1 is identical to monocyte-derived IL-1. This was also confirmed by Northern blot analysis detecting IL-1 alpha specific mRNA in melanoma cells by hybridization with a cDNA fragment encoding for IL-1 alpha. Thus, melanoma cells, like other epidermal cells, exhibit the capacity to release the immunomodulating cytokine IL-1 and, therefore, probably have the potency to influence host defense mechanisms directed against malignant melanoma.\r"

As anticipated, a severe capillary leak syndrome developed in all patients. Myocardial infarction (MI) occurred unexpectedly in three patients, as evidenced by a focal injury pattern on ECG and elevations of creatinine phosphokinase myocardial band fractions. All patients receiving rIL-2 exhibited major reductions in their left ventricular stroke work index (47 +/- 11 g.m/m2 to 29 +/- g.m/m2), an index of cardiac contractility. It remains uncertain whether the MIs were a byproduct of the capillary leak syndrome in patients with underlying coronary artery disease or whether rIL-2 directly or indirectly damages cardiac muscle.\r"

Various surface stimulating techniques were effective: 1) sacral monopolar electrical stimulation with negative electrodes over S2 sacral foramina and positive electrodes on the legs, 2) sacral bipolar electrical stimulation with electrodes only over sacral foramina, 3) perineal monopolar electrical stimulation, and 4) perineal tactile stimulation. Urodynamic responses were similar to those for sacral epidural electrodes implanted adjacent to sacral nerves. Voiding was obtained both during stimulation and poststimulation. Stimulating parameters that were effective for daily voiding with sacral surface electrodes were 10 pps, 30 to 45 ma, 0.6 ms pulse duration, and 2 to 5 sec stimulation train duration.\r"

Whites also underwent more angioplasty procedures, but the difference was not statistically significant. Although utilization differences may reflect patient preference or different levels of disease severity and socioeconomic status not adequately accounted for, this study suggests that substantial racial inequalities exist in the use of procedures for patients hospitalized with coronary heart disease.\r"

Evaluation included repeating the smear and performing colposcopy in all patients. Colposcopically directed biopsy and endocervical curettage were performed when appropriate. Sixty-seven patients (58.3%) had atrophy, 43 (37.4%) were normal, two (1.7%) had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1, two (1.7%) had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2, and one (0.9%) had human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. There was a strong association between squamous atypia and estrogen deficiency. With the correction of the estrogen deficiency, the squamous atypia reverted to normal in a statistically significant percentage of patients. A Papanicolaou smear report of squamous atypia in women over age 50 should not be considered normal; further evaluation is required. The incidence of cervical or vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia and HPV infection is much lower than reported in studies involving younger patients.\r"

In the early 1970s, the overall increase was attributable to women under 30 years of age, and in the early 1980s to women aged 30 years or more. The increase in the incidence rate of ectopic pregnancy per 100,000 women has taken place somewhat successively since the late 1960s in women aged 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, and 35-39 years. The incidence of ectopic pregnancy per 100,000 women increased by every successive 5-year cohort born since the late 1930s up to the cohort born in 1954-1958; thereafter, the birth cohorts have experienced an equal or even lower risk of ectopic pregnancy. The findings suggest that the large \"baby boom\" cohort (born in 1945-1954), with its high risk of ectopic pregnancy, is mainly responsible for the overall increase in the number of ectopic pregnancies seen in the past decade. When these cohorts end their reproductive years, the marked increase in the number of ectopic pregnancies in Finland may decrease, but the incidence rates will probably stay stable.\r"

The occupational histories, male-to-female ratio (5:1), and ratio of right-to-left rib involvement (9:1)--in addition to results of electromyographic and histologic studies and the principles of bone remodeling--suggest that this hyperostosis occurs at sites most stressed with bending and rotation of the thorax.

  ".W": "We measured the distance between the spinolaminar line and the articular pillars of the cervical spine (the laminar space), identified on lateral radiograph, to determine the diagnostic value of changes in this measurement in cases of unilateral facet dislocation. Twenty-seven cases of unilateral facet dislocation were compared with 70 normal spines and with 29 cases of hyperflexion injuries without unilateral facet dislocation. Abrupt alteration of the laminar space between two adjacent levels was found to be an accurate measure of rotation of the spine at the levels concerned; on the basis of this alteration, we were able to correctly diagnose 23 of 27 cases of unilateral facet dislocation and 22 of 23 cases of unilateral facet dislocation between C2 and C6. In only two of the 70 normal cases was a similar alteration of the laminar space seen, and one of these was due to a previous fracture. In none of the 29 cases of hyperflexion injury without unilateral facet dislocation was there abrupt alteration of the laminar space. We conclude that abrupt alteration of the laminar space is an accurate determinant for rotational anomalies of the cervical spine and, in particular, for unilateral facet dislocation.\r"

Each animal was studied with both unenhanced and enhanced MR and CT with Gd-DTPA and meglumine iothalamate, respectively. The enhancement patterns resulting from these techniques were compared and images were correlated with histopathology. All animals demonstrated abnormal leptomeningeal enhancement on MR with Gd-DTPA, but only one of four dogs exhibited abnormal contrast enhancement on CT. In these animals Gd-DTPA-enhanced MR also identified complications of meningitis, such as ventriculitis and cerebritis, more effectively than CT did. Unenhanced MR was not helpful in identifying meningitis. Histologic evaluation demonstrated that the abnormal areas of contrast enhancement on MR and CT correlated with inflammatory cell infiltration. However, some regions of mild leptomeningitis, ependymitis, and cerebritis identified histologically did not demonstrate abnormal enhancement. Since the animal model used was clinically and pathologically similar to human meningitis, we propose that Gd-DTPA-enhanced MR will subsequently be found more effective than unenhanced MR and IV contrast-enhanced CT for demonstrating meningitis and its complications in humans.\r"

Pathology was obtained in the six patients with primary tumors and in 14 of the 24 patients with metastases. Similar to evolving intraparenchymal hematomas, hemorrhagic neoplasms undergo changes in their appearance that can be categorized into three distinct intensity patterns, or stages. Stage 1 is characterized as iso- or hypointensity on short TR sequences and as hypointensity on long TR sequences; stage 2 as developing hyperintensity on both short and long TR sequences, without evidence of a well-defined black rim; and stage 3 as a hyperintense lesion with a well-defined black rim on long TR sequences. An additional mixed-intensity pattern was identified, which contained areas corresponding to more than one stage. In all of the cases exhibiting this pattern, pathology confirmed that the appearance was due to recurrent bleeding. We found several characteristics on MR that, when present, suggest an underlying neoplasm. These include delay in evolution between stages, central or eccentric hyperintensity in stage 2, and a mixed-intensity pattern. In addition, the presence of a hemosiderin rim does not exclude an underlying neoplasm. We found that the MR patterns that characterize hemorrhagic intracranial neoplasms should help to determine the cause of the hemorrhage.\r"

The MR interpretation was compared with detailed operative diagrams and operative and pathologic reports. The examinations were performed on a 1.5-T MR system with thin-section sagittal and coronal T1-weighted (short TR/TE) images. Each pituitary half was considered separately (54 \"halves\"). Twenty-one pituitary halves were considered to have glandular abnormalities on MR. Compared with surgical findings, 17 MR findings were true positives and four were false positives (one pars intermedia cyst, three normal tissue). Of the 33 pituitary halves considered normal on MR, 26 were true negatives and seven were false negatives. MR had an overall sensitivity of 71% and a specificity of 87% for these adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary adenomas. A focal glandular hypointensity identified on coronal images was the most sensitive predictor of adenoma location. Sagittal images were not useful in either detection or localization. Upward convexity of the gland and deviation of the stalk were less useful indicators. Abnormalities of the sellar floor were the least reliable. In comparison with the capabilities of CT detection of microadenomas described in the current literature, it appears that high-field thin-section MR of the sella is the most sensitive imaging method for preoperative localization of ACTH-secreting adenomas in patients with Cushing disease.\r"

We used a combination of high-field MR, electron microscopy, and histologic techniques in experimental animals to determine whether the hyperintensity of the posterior lobe might be functionally related to hormone neurosecretory processes, and to attempt to establish its chemical nature. Histologic sections of a dog's pituitary gland processed with lipid-specific markers showed intense staining in the posterior lobe but not in the anterior lobe, thus documenting the location of fat in the posterior pituitary. Administration of vasoactive drugs known to influence vasopressin secretion to anesthetized cats produced changes in the volume of high-intensity signal in the posterior pituitary. Subsequent electron microscopy showed a significant increase in posterior lobe glial cell lipid droplets and neurosecretory granules in dehydration-stimulated cats. The data suggest that the pituitary hyperintensity represents intracellular lipid signal in the glial cell pituicytes of the posterior lobe or neurosecretory granules containing vasopressin. The volume of the signal may, in turn, reflect the functional state of hormonal release from the neurohypophysis.\r"

No statistically significant difference in putaminal hypointensity on long TR/long TE spin-echo sequences or on T2*-weighted images using gradient-echo sequences was observed between Parkinson patients and controls. There was also no statistically significant difference in the frequency of restoration of the signal intensity of the substantia nigra between the two groups of patients. The width of the pars compacta of the substantia nigra in patients with Parkinson disease was 2.12 + 0.82 mm (mean +/- SD). This value in age- and gender-matched controls was 2.67 +/- 0.5. Comparing these two groups with an unpaired t test resulted in a p value less than or equal to .005.

One hour after administration of AMI-25 to rats (18 mumol Fe/kg; 1 mg Fe/kg), 82.6 +/- 0.3% of the administered dose was sequestered in the liver and 6.2 +/- 7.6% in the spleen. Peak concentrations of 59Fe were found in liver after 2 hr and in the spleen after 4 hr. 59Fe slowly cleared from liver (half-life, 3 days) and spleen (half-life, 4 days) and was incorporated into hemoglobin of erythrocytes in a time-dependent fashion. The half-time of the T2 effect on liver and spleen (24-48 hr) was shorter than the 59Fe clearance, indicating metabolism of AMI-25 into other forms of iron. IV administration of AMI-25 (30 mg Fe/kg) corrected iron-deficiency anemia and showed bioavailability similar to that of commercially available IV iron preparations within 7 days. No acute or subacute toxic effects were detected by histologic or serologic studies in rats or beagle dogs who received a total of 3000 mumol Fe/kg, 150 times the dose proposed for MR imaging of the liver. Our results indicate that AMI-25 is a fully biocompatible potential contrast agent for MR.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to evaluate superparamagnetic iron oxide (AMI-25) as a contrast agent for MR to distinguish normal spleens from those diffusely infiltrated by lymphoma. As diffuse splenic involvement lacks visible tumor-tissue boundaries, signal-intensity measurements of spleens were used as a diagnostic criterion in 33 patients (lymphoma, n = 8; benign splenomegaly, n = 5; normal subjects, n = 20). Unenhanced MR images were insensitive (four of eight patients) and nonspecific (20 of 25 patients) in the diagnosis of lymphoma. After injection of superparamagnetic iron oxide (40 mumol Fe/kg), lymphomatous spleens showed a significantly higher signal intensity (p less than .05) than did normal spleens or spleens enlarged by benign disease (hepatic cirrhosis, n = 4; spherocytosis, n = 1). Changes in splenic MR signal intensity unambiguously identified eight of eight lymphomatous spleens and 25 of 25 normal or enlarged spleens that did not contain lymphoma. Phagocytosis of superparamagnetic iron oxide in lymphomatous spleens is reduced because of diffuse displacement of splenic macrophages by lymphoma cells and/or by immunologic suppression of macrophage activity. Our results suggest that superparamagnetic iron oxide (AMI-25) can improve the accuracy of MR imaging in the diagnosis of splenic lymphoma. With further development, this noninvasive technique may reduce the need for diagnostic splenectomy in lymphoma patients.\r"

Frontal chest radiographs from 54 patients with traumatic fractures of at least one vertebral body from C6 to T8 were examined for signs suggestive of aortic rupture. These signs included (1) mediastinal width equal to or greater than 8 cm; (2) presence of a left apical cap; (3) a right paratracheal stripe of 5 mm or more; and (4) deviation of the nasogastric tube, when present, to the right of the T4 spinous process. Thirty-seven patients (69%) had radiographic signs suggestive of aortic rupture on the initial anteroposterior chest film. The single patient in this group who actually had an aortic rupture died in the emergency department shortly after admission. The spine fracture could be identified on the initial chest radiograph in 19 (51%) of the 37 patients. These results show that a widened mediastinum on chest radiographs after trauma is not a specific finding of aortic rupture. In these cases, the upper thoracic spine should be examined closely on the initial frontal chest radiograph for evidence of fracture. If a fracture of the upper thoracic spine is identified, an aortic rupture is unlikely in the absence of clinical signs and symptoms supporting this diagnosis.\r"

Chest tube placement was required in 5% of the biopsies. We conclude that transthoracic aspiration needle biopsy is of value in the diagnosis of suspected pulmonary infections.\r"

  ".W": "Six different combinations of film-processor temperature (33.3 degrees C, 35 degrees C), development time (22 sec, 44 sec), and chemistry (Du Pont medium contrast developer [MCD] and Kodak rapid process [RP] developer) were each evaluated by separate analyses with Hurter and Driffield curves, test images of plastic step wedges, noise variance analysis, and phantom images; each combination also was evaluated clinically. Du Pont MCD chemistry produced greater contrast than did Kodak RP chemistry. A change in temperature from 33.3 degrees C (92 degrees F) to 35 degrees C (95 degrees F) had the least effect on dose and image contrast. Temperatures of 36.7 degrees C (98 degrees F) and 38.3 degrees C (101 degrees F) also were tested with extended processing. The speed increased for 36.7 degrees C but decreased at 38.3 degrees C. Base plus fog increased, but contrast decreased for these higher temperatures. Increasing development time had the greatest effect on decreasing the dose required for equivalent film darkening when imaging BR12 breast equivalent test objects; ion chamber measurements showed a 32% reduction in dose when the development time was increased from 22 to 44 sec. Although noise variance doubled in images processed with the extended development time, diagnostic capability was not compromised. Extending the processing time for mammographic films was an effective method of dose reduction, whereas varying the processing temperature and chemicals had less effect on contrast and dose.\r"

In 78, visceral injuries were confirmed at surgery or at follow-up CT. Of the patients with injuries, 14 (18%) had hyperdense hematomas on the non-contrast studies that became isodense after IV administration of contrast material. These hematomas generally were small and posed an immediate threat to life in only one patient (0.5% of all subjects). In 13% of patients with injury (5% of the total), the additional information did influence treatment planning (surgery in two and intensive conservative treatment in eight). Compared with conventional contrast scanning, the combined non-contrast-contrast technique increased the scanning time only by about 5 1/2 min, but it improved the sensitivity and accuracy of CT in detecting visceral injuries from 74% and 84% to 92% and 91%, respectively (p less than or equal to .003 and p less than or equal to .04). Although contrast-enhanced scanning alone accurately depicts visceral injuries requiring surgical treatment, the incorporation of a non-contrast sequence can detect a subgroup of patients who require intensive conservative management with bed rest and close observation. This additional information can be obtained expeditiously, with minimal additional effort or intervention. The use of non-contrast scanning alone is not recommended.\r"

Thus, most patients (64%) had localized involvement of the rectosigmoid colon with sparing of the distal rectum. The anatomic-pathologic basis for the localized spread of prostatic carcinoma to the rectosigmoid colon is illustrated on MR scans. Thus, prostatic carcinoma invading the rectum may be manifested on double-contrast barium enema by a spectrum of radiographic findings, and most patients have localized rectosigmoid involvement with sparing of the distal rectum.\r"

MR data were correlated with histologic features such as fatty degeneration, fibrosis, and peritumoral edema. Unlike metastatic cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma was best detected (p less than .01) with T2-weighted pulse sequences. The mean tumor-liver T2 difference was 34.4%, while the mean T1 difference was only 21.8%. A tissue-specific diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma was possible in 14 of 21 patients by identification of fatty degeneration of the tumor (eight of 17), tumor capsule (five of 21), and/or vascular invasion (six of 21). MR features of peritumoral edema, present in six of 21 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and in seven of 25 patients with metastases, were exclusively associated with malignant tumors. The large variation in tissue characteristics (relaxation times and proton density) seen in primary liver tumors necessitates the use of multiple pulse sequences to maximize lesion detection. However, the combined use of T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo and T2-weighted phase-contrast images had the advantage of distinguishing benign from malignant primary liver tumors in 48 of 55 patients in this series.\r"

Axial long TR/long TE images were evaluated with respect to prostatic zonal size and signal intensity. Findings were correlated with each patient's age (17-74 years). The central region of the prostate and the peripheral zone enlarged with age; the central gland increased in size by an average of 175% between the second and eighth decades and the peripheral zone increased by an average of 67%. The anterior fibromuscular stroma decreased with increasing age (from an average anteroposterior thickness of 1.2 cm in the second decade to 0.4 cm in the eighth decade) and also became thinner as a function of increasing gland size. The periprostatic venous plexus became less prominent as a function of increasing age, decreasing from 2.5 to 1.5 mm in average maximal diameter, but this venous caliber was not significantly correlated with gland size. The conspicuity of the peripheral zone with respect to the central gland was improved, both as a function of increasing age and increasing gland size, and conspicuity was greatest on long TR/long TE images because of excellent contrast resolution. We conclude that in older age groups, the zonal anatomy of the prostate is more clearly defined than in young patients, both because of morphologic changes in prostate structure and because of physiologic changes resulting in differing zonal MR signal intensities.\r"

We used standard interventional equipment, fluoroscopy, and (for access to the upper urinary tract) ureteral catheters that had been partially or completely inserted at cystoscopy by urologists. The successful procedures included insertion of double-pigtail ureteral stents (42 procedures), insertion of single-pigtail ureteral stents (47), advancement of arrested or incompletely inserted retrograde ureteral catheters (42), urothelial biopsy (30), balloon dilatation of ureteral strictures (three), retrograde cannulation of ureteropelvic junction obstructions that could not be negotiated in a percutaneous antegrade fashion (three), and ureteral stone extraction (one). The method was unsuccessful in 12 patients. Failures were due to caudal migration of a ureteral catheter into the bladder in eight patients and to an inability to advance a guidewire beyond an area of ureteral obstruction or perforation in four. Although most commonly used as an adjunct to extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy of renal and proximal ureteral calculi, the perurethral approach was extremely valuable for a wide variety of other indications. Significant complications, encountered in 5% of the procedures, included urosepsis (two), ureteral perforations (five), and cannulation of a false ureteral lumen (two). These problems resolved without sequelae with conservative management. The perurethral transvesical approach represents a relatively simple, safe, and expeditious interventional uroradiologic method. It frequently obviated other more invasive interventions such as percutaneous nephrostomy, ureteroscopy, or surgery.\r"

The results indicate that the marked variation in dental contact rates is a reflection of cohort succession, and not a function of aging per se. Older cohorts having lower dental contact rates are being replaced by younger cohorts having higher dental contact rates. The dental contact rates of the individual birth cohorts themselves are quite stable over time. The results also indicate that economic barriers (especially liquid assets) have become more important than ever before, especially for the oldest-old. These findings have important implications for public policy about the oral health and health care of elderly Americans.\r"

Over a 13-month period 25 of 38 (66 percent) AIDS patients with PCP had positive Giemsa (Diff-Quik) stains of induced sputum. We were unable to predict before sputum induction which patients would be positive based on clinical severity (increased A-a gradient or serum LDH levels). We confirmed prior observations that a normal serum LDH level was found in only 5 percent of documented PCP cases.

With the lead provided by the deficiency state, studies aimed at the linkage between alpha 1AT and its target enzyme, neutrophil elastase, have provided useful information about the pathogenesis of emphysema due to cigarette smoking. alpha 1AT represents the predominant antielastase of the lower respiratory tract. This observation implicates neutrophil elastase as the enzyme responsible for lung destruction, since affinity studies demonstrate that alpha 1ATs physiologically relevant function is the inhibition of neutrophil elastase. However, because of the inexorably slow nature of the emphysema process, demonstration of the protease-antiprotease imbalance in the lungs of smokers has been difficult. Studies using sensitive assays for alpha 1AT function and for neutrophil elastase's presence have added new support for the protease-antiprotease theory, and evaluation of related disorders such as the adult respiratory distress syndrome and cystic fibrosis have provided corraborative evidence. Finally, studies that have indicated that the major site of the protease-antiprotease imbalance is the microenvironment of protease-producing cells offer a new direction for future research into the pathogenesis of emphysema.\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the mechanism by which the low T3 and low T4 syndrome occurs in patients with infection, recombinant human interleukin-1 (IL-1) was administered to mice, and their thyroid hormone metabolism was studied. Continuous sc infusion of IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta at a dose of 0.015-1 microgram/day for 3 days decreased food intake and serum T4, T3, and rT3 concentrations in a dose-dependent manner. In pair-fed control (PFC) mice, serum T4 and T3 also decreased, but rT3 was reciprocally increased. The T3/T4 ratio was greater in IL-1-treated mice than in PFC mice. Although food intake was decreased by 65% in IL-1-treated mice (1 microgram/day) compared with that in fed control mice, type I iodothyronine 5'-deiodinating activity in liver was significantly increased compared with that in fed control mice. Furthermore, the T3 and T4 responses to TSH were greatly diminished in IL-1-treated mice. These findings suggest that IL-1 directly inhibited the effect of TSH on the thyroid gland and decreased the serum concentrations of T4 and T3, and that an increase in type I iodothyronine 5'-deiodinating activity in livers of IL-1-treated mice may account for the greater T3/T4 ratio and lower serum rT3 concentration than those in PFC mice. Since tumor necrosis factor-alpha has a similar effect, we speculate that both cytokines may be synergistically involved in the altered thyroid hormone metabolism in mice (decreased serum T4, T3, and rT3 concentrations) and hypercatabolism in a febrile state.\r"

  ".W": "Studies characterized the structure and function of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors in astrocytic glial cells and neuronal cells in primary culture from neonatal rat brain. [125I]EGF binding to membranes prepared from glial and neuronal cultures was specific and dependent on protein concentration; however, glial preparations bound 5-fold more [125I]EGF per mg protein. Unlabeled EGF competed for binding to both glial and neuronal membranes with an IC50 of 5 nM, whereas insulin, insulin-like growth factor I, and nerve growth factor failed to compete. Scatchard plot analysis of binding data for glial cells yielded a curvilinear plot with dissociation constants of 7.12 nM for high affinity and 6.2 microM for low affinity sites. The higher level of binding in glial compared to neuronal membranes reflected a greater number of binding sites rather than differences in receptor affinity. In glial membranes, [125I]EGF covalently cross-linked to one major protein with a mol wt of 170,000, and EGF stimulated the phosphorylation of a 170,000 protein which was half-maximal at 20 nM. In contrast, neither covalent cross-linking nor receptor autophosphorylation could be detected in neuronal membranes. Culture of glial cells in the presence of EGF stimulated [35S]methionine incorporation into both cellular and secreted proteins, whereas no effect of EGF was observed in neuronal cultures. The addition of EGF to glial cultures produced a dose-dependent stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation as well as the multiplication of cells over a 6-day period. These observations show that functional EGF receptors in the neonatal brain are predominantly localized in glial cells.\r"

  ".U": "89078290\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies revealed that administration of 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [24,25-(OH)2D3] to calcium (Ca)-deficient rats causes a dose-dependent reduction in markedly elevated serum 1,25-(OH)2D3 level. Although the results suggested that the metabolism of 1,25-(OH)2D3 was accelerated by 24,25-(OH)2D3, those experiments could not define whether the enhanced metabolism of 1,25-(OH)2D3 played a role in the reduction in the serum 1,25-(OH)2D3 level. In the present study, in order to address this issue more specifically, serum 1,25-(OH)2D3 was maintained solely by exogenous administration through miniosmotic pumps of 1,25-(OH)2D3 into vitamin D-deficient rats. Thus, by measuring the serum 1,25-(OH)2D3 concentration, the effect of 24,25-(OH)2D3 on the MCR of 1,25-(OH)2D3 could be examined. Administration of 24,25-(OH)2D3 caused a dose-dependent enhancement in the MCR of 1,25-(OH)2D3, and 1 microgram/100 g rat.day 24,25-(OH)2D3, which elevated serum 24,25-(OH)2D3 to 8.6 +/- 1.3 ng/ml, significantly increased MCR and suppressed serum levels of 1,25-(OH)2D3. The effect of 24,25-(OH)2D3 on 1,25-(OH)2D3 metabolism developed with a rapid time course, and the recovery of iv injected [1 beta-3H]1,25-(OH)2D3 in blood was significantly reduced within 1 h. In addition, there was an increase in radioactivity in the water-soluble fraction of serum as well as in urine, suggesting that 1,25-(OH)2D3 is rapidly degraded to a water-soluble metabolite(s). Furthermore, the reduction in serum 1,25-(OH)2D3 was associated with a reduction in both serum and urinary Ca levels. Because the conversion of [3H]24,25-(OH)2D3 to [3H]1,24,25-(OH)2D3 or other metabolites was minimal in these rats, 24,25-(OH)2D3 appears to act without being converted into other metabolites. These results demonstrate that 24,25-(OH)2D3 rapidly stimulates the metabolism of 1,25-(OH)2D3 and reduces its serum level. It is suggested that 24,25-(OH)2D3 plays a role in modifying serum 1,25-(OH)2D3 concentrations by affecting the metabolism of 1,25-(OH)2D3 and may have a therapeutic values in the treatment of hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria caused by 1,25-(OH)2D3 excess.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin-1 (IL-1), a secretory product of activated macrophages and many other cell types, is an important mediator of the acute phase reaction to infection and to endotoxin administration. Previous reports that GH and TSH secretion are decreased following injection of endotoxin or IL-1 led us to test the hypothesis that IL-1 acts by releasing increased amounts of somatostatin (SS), a hypothalamic factor inhibitory of both GH and TSH release. Primary cultures of dispersed fetal rat diencephalic cells were found to contain increasing amounts of immunoreactive SS in both cells and media after addition of recombinant human IL-1 beta. This increase was detectable at 24 hours and continued for up to 6 days, the longest time interval tested. Increased content of SS peptide was accompanied by marked increases in SS mRNA. These changes were dose-related, the lowest effective dose being 10(-10) M. In contrast to the long term response, exposure of the cells to IL-1 beta for one hour had only minimal stimulating effects on somatostatin release. These data indicate that IL-1 beta is neurotrophic for the somatostatinergic neuron, an action that may be responsible at least in part, for the neuroendocrine response to infection.\r"

CRF mRNA was first detected on day 17 of gestation (E17) in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. The levels of hypothalamic CRF mRNA increased progressively from E17 to E19-E20, decreased during the perinatal period, and increased thereafter. The levels of POMC mRNA in the pituitary paralleled the variations in hypothalamic CRF mRNA, showing a peak on E20-E21. POMC mRNA levels in the anterior pituitary were decreased on days 4-7 after birth (P4-P7) and increased steadily thereafter. In contrast to levels in the anterior pituitary, POMC mRNA levels increased steadily from P1 to P21 in the neurointermediate lobe of the pituitary. These data indicate that the expression of both the CRF and POMC genes in the paraventricular nucleus and anterior pituitary, respectively, are reduced during the first week of life, i.e. within the so-called stress nonresponsive period. Our observations suggest that an impaired regulation of ACTH and CRF synthesis due to an immature neuronal pathway within the brain or increased glucocorticoid feedback may account for the stress nonresponsive period.\r"

  ".W": "To study the pathogenesis of osteoporosis in patients with chronic liver disease, we performed dynamic bone histomorphometry and measured serum bone Gla-protein in 80 patients with various types of chronic liver disease. These results were compared with results obtained in 40 healthy controls. Mean trabecular bone volume and mean trabecular thickness were significantly reduced in both men and women with chronic liver disease (p less than 0.001 for both measurements in men and p less than 0.01 for both measurements in women). Osteoporosis as defined by histologic parameters was present in 17 (21%) patients with no significant differences in prevalence rates among the various hepatic disorders. No patient had histologic evidence of osteomalacia, although mineralization lag times were prolonged (p less than 0.01 for men and women). Bone formation rates were significantly reduced in 46 (57%) patients, and unlike the static measurements, were related to the type and severity of the underlying liver disease. Patients with alcoholic liver disease, hemochromatosis, and cholestatic liver disease had lower bone turnover rates and osteoblastic surfaces (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.05, respectively) than patients with chronic active hepatitis. Furthermore, the presence of hepatic cirrhosis was associated with diminished bone formation and lower osteoblast surfaces. Serum bone Gla-protein levels were significantly correlated with bone formation rates and osteoblast surfaces (r = 0.585 and r = 0.434, respectively). A reduction in osteoblast surfaces has not previously been demonstrated in liver disease. This reduction and the associated impairment of osteoblastic activity may contribute to the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and can be assessed by the measurement of serum bone Gla-protein.\r"

Using [3H]phlorizin radioautography, we examined the relation between this increase in transport Vmax and the number and distribution of sodium-glucose co-transporters on the luminal surface of rat ileum. Male Lewis rats were made diabetic with streptozocin. Ninety days later we measured 3-O-methyl-D-glucopyranose absorption and specific [3H]phlorizin binding to the ileal mucosa of the same rats. Net 3-O-methyl-D-glucopyranose flux was 6.9-fold greater in diabetic rats compared with age-matched controls. Specific binding of [3H]phlorizin to the luminal surface was 7.2-fold greater in the diabetic rats. Radioautography revealed that, in chronic diabetes, specific phlorizin binding extends into the midvillus region of the ileum, whereas in age-matched controls, it is confined to villus tips. We believe that, in untreated diabetes, a larger fraction of intestinal villus epithelial cells participate in glucose absorption.\r"

The expression of HLA-DR on cultured thyroid epithelial cells (thyrocytes) from UNG, MNG, and PC after coculture with autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was compared with that on GD and HT cells. The thyrocytes also were cultured with interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) alone. A cytotoxicity assay involving 51Cr-labeled thyrocytes, anti-HLA-DR, and complement was used to determine HLA-DR expression. Stimulation of thyrocytes with 200 U/mL IFN gamma induced HLA-DR (expressed as a cytotoxicity index) equally well on all thyrocytes [AITD (n = 6): IFN gamma, 23.8 +/- 7.7 (+/- SD); unstimulated, 3.6 +/- 2.0; UNG (n = 6), MNG (n = 9), and PC (n = 5): IFN gamma, 22.5 +/- 4.7; unstimulated, 4.0 +/- 3.0]. When cocultured with autologous PBMC, the values were: AITD, 24.9 +/- 10.1; UNG, MNG, and PC, 3.8 +/- 3.7 (P less than 0.001). The supernatants from the AITD cocultures had higher IFN gamma concentrations (by RIA) than those from the other cocultures. We conclude that in UNG, MNG, and PC, the peripheral blood helper T-lymphocytes are not sensitized to thyrocyte membrane antigen(s); consequently, little if any IFN gamma is produced in cocultures, and hence, there is no increase in thyrocyte HLA-DR expression, unlike the situation in AITD (GD and HT). Thus, UNG, MNG, and PC are not primarily autoimmune in nature, as defined by a lack of sensitization of the PBMC of such patients to thyroid antigen(s).\r"

To resolve some of these discrepancies, women participating in the NICHD-Diabetes in Early Pregnancy Study were studied.

We prospectively collected 185 blood samples from 35 insulin-dependent diabetic women and 166 blood samples from 31 control women, all between 5 and 37 weeks gestation. Serum concentrations of hCG, pregnancy-specific beta-1-glycoprotein, placental lactogen, and hCG alpha were measured serially. The relationship between serum hormone, fasting blood glucose, 1-h postprandial blood glucose, and glycosylated hemoglobin concentrations was compared. Serum hCG alpha levels were significantly lower in the diabetic women than in control women at multiple time points during the first and second trimesters, while no consistent differences in the serum concentrations of hCG or pregnancy-specific beta-1-glycoprotein were found between pregnant diabetic and control women. Serum placental lactogen levels were significantly lower in diabetic women at 9-10 weeks and 20 weeks gestation. There were no correlations between fasting blood glucose, 1-h postprandial blood glucose, or glycosylated hemoglobin and any of the placental protein levels in the diabetic women. These data are consistent with a defect in synthesis and/or secretion of hCG alpha by the cytotrophoblast during the first two trimesters of pregnancy in insulin-requiring diabetic women.\r"

  ".W": "TNF-alpha (also known as cachectin) may produce many of its important effects in vivo by actions on blood vessels. Endothelial cells are well known to respond to TNF-alpha. We investigated whether vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC), the most abundant cell type in most vessels, also respond to TNF-alpha and the related cytokine lymphotoxin (TNF-beta). Both human rTNF-alpha and beta (0.1 to 100 ng/ml) induced transient accumulation of IL-1 mRNA by adult human vascular SMC that peaked between 1 and 4 h. The inhibitor of RNA synthesis actinomycin D (1 microgram/ml) blocked the induction of IL-1 mRNA, whereas inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide (1 microgram/ml) resulted in a marked \"superinduction\" of both IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta mRNA species. TNF-alpha treatment also increased intracellular biologically active IL-1 and subsequent release of IL-1 activity from SMC. Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies demonstrated de novo synthesis of IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta precursors in TNF-treated or lymphotoxin-treated SMC. TNF-alpha also activated other SMC functions including the concentration-dependent release of PGE2 from SMC, and time-dependent induction of the gene for (2'-5')-oligoadenylate synthetase, an enzyme thought to mediate the anti-viral and anti-proliferative actions of IFN. We also explored whether SMC, which both produce and respond to IL-1, might also express either of the TNF genes. Bacterial LPS (10 micrograms/ml) caused slight accumulation of TNF-alpha transcripts. Incubation of SMC for 4 h with inhibitors of protein synthesis alone caused little or no elevation of TNF-alpha mRNA, but simultaneous addition of LPS (\"superinduction\" conditions) induced large amounts of TNF-alpha (but not TNF-beta) mRNA. Cells treated with anisomycin (1 microgram/ml) and LPS, then washed to remove this reversible inhibitor of protein synthesis, released TNF-alpha into the medium, as assessed by the L929 cytotoxicity assay and by metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation. Thus, SMC both respond to both TNF and lymphotoxin and can produce TNF-alpha, a cytokine with numerous effects on vascular cells of potential significance in the pathophysiology of septic shock and other inflammatory conditions.\r"

The frequency of the IL-2-responding cells was 1/48 as determined by limiting dilution analysis, and no cell death was evidenced in soft agar cultures. An analysis of the IL-2-binding sites conducted on bone marrow-derived macrophage precursors revealed the presence of 4000 binding sites with intermediate affinity (Kd approximately 3 x 10(-9)). Bone marrow-derived macrophage precursors did not react, even after prolonged culture in IL-2-conditioned media, with mAb recognizing the binding site (AMT-13, 3C7) or a binding site-associate molecule (7D4) of a Mr 50,000 to 60,000 component of the IL-2R expressed by the IL-2-dependent T cell line CTLL-2.

Incubation of these cells with recombinant cytokines at 37 degrees C caused a rapid, dose-dependent decrease in their ability to subsequently bind subsaturating levels of [125I]EGF at 4 degrees C. Inhibition was evident at 5 min after addition of cytokines, reached a maximal level (60-70% reduction) after 15 to 30 min, and declined thereafter. Normal EGF binding was attained by 2 h. Half-maximal inhibition of EGF binding occurred at 10 pM IL-1 and 50 pM TNF. The two cytokines were not additive in their effect. Competition experiments at 4 degrees C showed that the cytokines did not interact directly with EGF-R; Scatchard analysis of binding of [125I]EGF to HuGi after treatment with IL-1 and TNF revealed an increase in EGF-R Kd from 0.75 nM to 2.9 nM with no change in receptor number. The effect of IL-1 and TNF on EGF-R was compared with that of the tumor-promotor PMA which is known to \"transmodulate\" EGF-R affinity by activating protein kinase C which then phosphorylates EGF-R. PMA caused a greater inhibition of EGF binding to HuGi (80 to 85% inhibition; ED50 = 500 pM), and recovery of binding was much slower. Importantly, in HuGi made deficient in protein kinase C by prolonged incubation with PMA, addition of fresh PMA no longer affected EGF binding, while the response to IL-1 and TNF was intact. Cytokine- but not PMA-mediated EGF-R transmodulation was partially reversed by treatment of the cells with millimolar concentrations of the kinase inhibitor amiloride. HuGi were incubated with H3 32PO4, stimulated with PMA or cytokines, and EGF-R were immunoprecipitated; IL-1 and TNF, like PMA, caused a 2- to 5-fold increase in receptor phosphorylation. We conclude that occupation of IL-1 and TNF-R activates a protein kinase, distinct from kinase C, for which EGF-R is a substrate.\r"

The monokines IL-1 and TNF-alpha were also potent inducers of IL-6, whereas lymphotoxin was only effective at much higher concentrations. Endothelial cell supernatant IL-6 was active as hybridoma-plasmacytoma growth factor and as B-cell stimulating factor. Endothelial IL-6 activity was neutralized by a specific anti-IL-6 antibody and by immunoprecipitation it was shown to be identical in size to human fibroblast-derived IL-6. As IL-6 is possibly an important regulator of host defense responses, production of this cytokine by endothelial cells may contribute to the pathogenesis of various inflammatory and immunologic diseases.\r"

Several pre-B cell lines were cloned from IL-3-treated long-term lymphocyte cultures. The growth requirements and physical properties of one representative clone, BL/3, are described. BL/3 cells were shown to be unresponsive to IL-3 except when it is used at very high concentrations. In contrast, significant growth was stimulated by stromal cell conditioned medium previously shown to contain a pre-B cell growth factor. Optimal growth of the pre-B cell clone was stimulated by stromal cell conditioned medium plus IL-3. Synergy between the stromal cell-derived factor and IL-3 occurred when IL-3 was used over a wide range of concentrations including a relatively low amount that was ineffective as a growth stimulus by itself. The finding that more than one factor is required to sustain optimal growth of some pre-B cells parallels the complex growth requirements reported for some primitive myeloid/erythroid progenitors.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of C fragments to induce IL-1 production in human monocytes was examined by using various approaches to carefully exclude the role of contaminating endotoxin. The presence of IL-1 activity in monocyte supernatants and lysates was assayed by the augmentation of PHA-induced proliferation of murine thymocytes. SRBC were opsonized with IgM rabbit antibodies and various human C components to prepare EAC reagents that contained less than 25 pg LPS/ml of EAC at 5 x 10(8) cells/ml. EAC1q, EAC4b, EAC4b2aoxy, EAC4b2aoxy C3b, EAC4b2aoxyC3bi, and EAC4b2aoxyC3d all failed to induce IL-1 production when incubated at 10- to 100-fold excess with adherent human monocytes. Similarly, LPS-free purified C3a, C5a, and C5a des Arg all showed no IL-1-inducing activities at concentrations up to 25 micrograms/ml. However, the same C5a preparations were active on human monocytes in the induction of chemotaxis, and C3a and C5a both induced skin-blueing in guinea pigs. Fragment Ba and Bb preparations purified by gel filtration chromatography contained approximately 100 pg LPS/micrograms Ba or Bb. These Ba and Bb preparations at 10 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively, induced IL-1 production in the presence of 5 micrograms/ml polymyxin B (PMB). However, Ba and Bb preparations purified by affinity chromatography and HPLC contained lower levels of endotoxin contamination and displayed IL-1-inducing activities at Ba and Bb concentrations of 50 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively, that were almost completely inhibited by PMB. To explore further the role of contaminating endotoxin, a Bb preparation was adsorbed with PMB-4B in the presence of a dialyzable detergent to remove LPS bound to the Bb. This LPS-free Bb preparation failed to induce IL-1 production while maintaining intact enzymatic activities. These results indicate that various solid phase or soluble C fragments, including C3b, iC3b, C3d, C3a, C5a, Ba or Bb do not induce IL-1 production in human monocytes in the absence of contaminating endotoxin.\r"

To elucidate the immunomodulating effects of CT at the cellular level we have examined interactions of CT with APC and with B and T lymphocytes in vitro. CT markedly stimulated the production of IL-1 from APC (mouse peritoneal macrophages or macrophage cell line P388D1) but did not induce Ia-Ag and had marginal, if any, effect in potentiating Ia Ag expression stimulated by rIFN-gamma on these cells. CT had differential effect on T cell proliferation in vitro, usually strongly inhibitory but on Con A-stimulated spleen cells during prolonged (greater than or equal to 5 days) culture or when added on day 4 or later to these cultures up to a two- to three-fold enhancement of proliferation was seen. CT-induced inhibition of T cell proliferation was associated with decreased production of IL-2 and anergy to exogenously added IL-2 despite apparently normal expression of IL-2R. Similar to what was found with T cells LPS-stimulated spleen B cells demonstrated both inhibition and enhancement of proliferation in the presence of CT: in high concentrations (greater than or equal to 10(-8) M) and early in culture (day 3) CT had a strong inhibitory effect on the proliferation of B cells, whereas later (day 6) and/or at lower CT concentrations (10(-9) to 10(-11) M) the proliferation was increased up to 10-fold. The net effect of CT treatment on Ig-production by LPS-stimulated spleen B cells was seen as an enhanced level of IgA and IgG but not IgM in culture supernatants. The differential effects of CT on the cells of the immune system observed in vitro may, singly or in combination, explain the immunostimulatory function of CT.\r"

  ".W": "Human blood lymphocytes stimulated in mixed cultures by allogeneic B cell lines were shown to cleave C3 molecules. The B cell lines were derived from Burkitt lymphoma patients: 1) established from their EBV-negative lymphoma, 2) the EBV-positive sublines converted in vitro, and 3) lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) i.e., B lymphocytes transformed in vitro by EBV. These cell lines differed considerably in their capacity to stimulate allogeneic lymphocytes. The split products of C3 were detected in the supernatants and on the surface of the activated lymphocytes at levels which correlated with the strength of stimulation. Lymphocytes cultured with LCL had the highest levels of thymidine incorporation blast transformation, C3 cleavage, and C3 fragment fixation. Lymphocytes exposed to the EBV-negative Burkitt lymphomas were stimulated weakly and their C3-activating capacity was low. Irrespective of the efficiency of lymphocyte stimulation induced in the cultures, 60 to 70% of the blasts were found to fix C3 fragments. The majority of the lymphocytes which fixed C3 fragments were T blasts that carried the CD3 marker and expressed IL-2R (CD25). CD4 and CD8 cells were represented with equal frequency in the C3-fragment fixing and C3-fragment negative populations. Pre-exposure of the MLC-activated lymphocytes to human serum increased their cytotoxic capacity toward CR type 2-carrying targets. The enhanced lysis was abrogated by F(ab)2 rabbit anti-human C3d or rabbit anti-CR type 2 antibodies. The results suggest that the C3 fragments fixed on the lymphocytes bind to CR on the targets and elevate the avidity of binding between the two interacting cells. This was also indicated by an increase in the frequency of lymphocyte-target conjugates.\r"

An important component of the activated T cells is a first order suppressor T cell or Ts1 that is Ly-1+2-, functions only at the afferent limb of the anti-TMA response, binds the TMA ligand and bears cross-reactive idiotypes associated with anti-TMA antibodies. This Ts1 produces a suppressor factor (TsF1) that binds the TMA ligand, bears the cross-reactive idiotypes and I-J determinants and functions to induce an idiotype-specific Ts2 population. To study the biochemistry of this TsF, use was made of T cell hybridomas that constitutively produce TMA-TsF1 (8A.1 and 8A.3). The TsF1 was purified from culture supernatant or cell extracts by (NH4)2SO4 precipitation, reverse phase HPLC and either affinity chromatography or by preparative IEF. The TsF1 has an isoelectric point of 6.5 and a m.w. of 26,000 or 62,000 as analyzed by SDS-PAGE or high performance molecular sieve chromatography. Its precipitation in 30 to 40% (NH4)2SO4; elution pattern from reverse phase high performance columns; its capacity to bind to a mAb specific for L-glutamic acid 60L-alanine30-L-tyrosine10 (GAT)-TsF1 strongly suggest that this protein belongs to the same family of proteins as do the GAT-TsF1 described previously. Most noteworthy is that although these TsF1 proteins show remarkable similarities, they are absolutely specific in their biologic activity; TMA-TsF1 will not suppress the response to GAT-BA-TNP and GAT-TsF1 will not suppress the response to TMA-BA-TNP. Thus the TMA-TsF1 represents a second example of a unique group of Ag-specific proteins whose function is to induce or activate other suppressor T cells in the primary immune response to Ag.\r"

Here anti-influenza A and anti-EBV CD4+ CTL have been studied by using permanent cell lines either untreated or depleted of CD8+ cells. In bulk cultures, HLA class I-restricted anti-viral CD8+ CTL account for all of the detectable killer cell activity, whereas after elimination of CD8+ cells an HLA class II-restricted killer activity mediated by CD4+/2H4-/4B4+ cells was consistently observed. The CD4+ CTL were fully differentiated in all of the cultures tested from the third in vitro passage because they could be demonstrated immediately after elimination of CD8+ cells. These CD4+ killer cells were equivalent to the CD8+ cells in terms of their lytic capacity. The absence of any class II-restricted antiviral activity in bulk cultures seems to be related to the very small numbers of CD4+ cells present in these antiviral cell lines. However, CD4+ cytolytic activity could not be detected during the first two in vitro passages, even when limiting dilution analysis of the CTL precursors were performed, showing that the killer function of Th cells differentiate only after several in vitro stimulations.\r"

In addition, we show that vaccinia virus-specific CD8+ Th cell function is mediated through production of lymphokines, including IL-2, and that the CD8+ Th cell component in the CTL response is labile, decreasing progressively with increasing time after in vivo priming. Thus, this study demonstrates the existence of two phenotypically distinct Th cell pathways in the generation of antivirus CTL responses.\r"

  ".U": "89080261\r", 
  ".W": "The surface expression of CD3-associated TCR chains on hybridoma cell lines derived from adult gamma delta thymocytes was analyzed. These cell lines were unusual, in that a) they expressed a surface heterodimer consisting of a 40- and a 42-kDa chain, i.e., comprised of chains different from any previously reported gamma delta-TCR all of which express C gamma 1- or C gamma 2-encoded gamma-chains; b) their CD3-associated TCR could not be categorized as alpha beta-TCR dimers, despite the similarities in m.w. of the TCR chains, because full size 1.3-kb beta-chain mRNA capable of encoding a functional beta-chain could not be detected in these cells; c) neither of the receptor chains could be precipitated with anti-C gamma 1C gamma 2-peptide antisera. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that the 42-kDa delta-chain is a novel chain, which differs from any reported delta-chains in size, charge and number of glycosylation sites. Collectively, the data on analysis of the 40-kDa chain strongly suggest that it represents a gamma-chain encoded for by the C gamma 4 locus, protein products of which have not yet been reported in the thymus. This gamma-chain was also unique, in that its isoelectric point was much lower than that of other gamma-chains. The gamma- and delta-chains on these C gamma 4-expressing hybridomas were indistinguishable from one another in size and charge (as determined by nonequivalent pH gradient electrophoresis/SDS-PAGE analysis and analysis after endoglycosidase treatment). Because the cell lines were randomly chosen from large panels of hybridomas, these results may well imply strikingly nonrandom pairing of thymocyte-derived C gamma 4 chains and the delta-chains reported here. Thus, only limited additional gamma delta repertoire diversity may be generated by availability of this gamma delta-TCR in the thymus.\r"

  ".W": "One of the difficulties encountered with the treatment of human B cell malignancies with anti-Id antibodies is the emergence of Id variants. The current study was designed to investigate this phenomenon further by using the murine B cell lymphoma model 38C13. Tumors were harvested that developed despite treatment with the anti-Id antibody S1C5 in mice inoculated with 38C13 cells and evaluated by immunofluorescence. Various phenotypes were found among escaping tumor cells. Some cells continued to react with S1C5 whereas others lost S1C5 reactivity. Among these latter cells, some continued to express surface IgM kappa, whereas others no longer expressed surface mu or kappa. After Id variant cell lines were established, immunofluorescence and ELISA of cell lysates from the surface IgM kappa- lines revealed persistent intracellular mu H chain but no detectable kappa. Surface IgM kappa+ lines were fused with myeloma cells and the Ig proteins secreted by the resultant hybridomas analyzed. The apparent m.w. of the mu-chains of these rescued Ig was the same as wild-type 38C13, whereas the kappa-chains were either the same or different in m.w. from the wild type. The IgM kappa of the variant line, T3C, weakly reacted with S1C5 and did not react with other anti-Id antibodies. The IgM kappa of the other variants were nonreactive with all the antibodies. Immunofluorescence of these surface Ig+ variants confirmed this finding. Some of the surface Ig+ and Ig- variant lines grew identically to wild-type tumor in vivo, but only the weakly S1C5-reactive variant T3C was inhibited in its growth by S1C5. Moreover, T3C was the only one of these lines capable of being lysed in vitro with S1C5 by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Further studies revealed that surface Ig+ and Ig- variants emerge in escaping tumors with similar frequency and that these variants represent a major mode of tumor escape from anti-Id treatment in this model.\r"

By determining the binding profile of three separate series of truncated synthetic peptides, it was found that in all three cases the different Ia reactivities mapped to largely overlapping regions of the peptides; although, for two of the peptides, the regions involved in binding the different Ia specificities were distinct. Moreover, subtle differences were found to dramatically influence some, but not other, Ia reactivities. Using a large panel of synthetic peptides it was found that a significant correlation exists between the capacity of peptides to interact with different alleles of the same molecule (i.e., IAd and IAk), but no correlation was found with the capacity of peptides to interact with different isotypes within the same haplotype (i.e., IAd and IEd). These data suggest that different alleles of the same MHC molecule may actually recognize closely related structures, whereas different isotypes may recognize unrelated, albeit non-mutually exclusive, structures on an Ag molecule.\r"

Based on the flow cytometric analysis of cytogenetically distinct thymocytes, there were at least two periods of stem cell immigration into the thymus, one during early larval life and the second before or during metamorphosis. Within the thymus, cohorts of cells derived from the first wave of immigration expanded at different times. The initial expansion occurred before 35 days of development. Cells involved in the second period of expansion were also derived from the initial immigrants, expanded after 35 days, and resulted in a turnover of thymocytes during the larval period. Precursor cells entering the thymus during metamorphosis expanded and resulted in an additional replacement of thymocytes. Cortical and medullary thymocytes were isolated from animals that received embryonic stem cell grafts. No differences in the presence or absence, or in the percentages, of donor thymocytes in these different fractions were observed. When limiting numbers of stem cells were transplanted, several cases of asymmetrical thymic lobe colonization were observed. These data suggested that an inter-thymic exchange of cells did not occur during larval life.\r"

  ".W": "The expression of TCR-associated molecules was examined in human fetal and postnatal tissues. From gestational wk 7 onward in the fetal liver, putative prothymocytes have been identified with cytoplasmic CD3 positivity (cCD3+). These immature cells are TdT- and do not express membrane CD3 (mCD3-) or TCR beta identified by beta F1, but show CD7 and CD45 positivity without CD1, CD2, CD5, CD4, CD8, CD10, and class II Ag. Their high proliferative activity is indicated by greater than 85% Ki67 positivity. After the 10th wk, beta F1+, mCD3+ cells also appear in the liver and these are mostly Ki67- but no TCR gamma delta-bearing cells can be identified at such an early stage of extrathymic development. In the mCD3- TdT-fetal thymus (10 1/2 to 18th wk) cCD3+, mCD3- CD1-blasts proliferate (Ki67+) and lack TCR-beta or TCR-gamma delta. The TdT-, CD1+ cortical thymocytes develop into TCR-beta + and WT31-positive (TCR-alpha beta +) cells. Subsequently TdT-positive thymocytes become detectable around 19 to 20 wk, and in such glands the peak of proliferative activity is seen among TdT+, cCD3+ cells which appear to acquire, in a regular sequence, cytoplasmic beta F1 (TCR-beta), mCD3, and TCR-alpha beta (WT31 positivity) together with the loss of TdT and Ki67 positivity. A newly described transitional population of cells is TdT-, beta F1+ but exhibits no detectable WT31 positivity. These cells correspond to the CD1+, mCD3+ thymocytes and are probably the targets of thymic selection. The cells of the TCR-gamma delta lineage, detected by mAb TCR-delta-1 and delta TCS1, are rare (0.02 to 0.5%) among thymocytes from gestational wk 10 1/2 onward through the whole span of thymic development, but these cells include a proportion (18 to 59%) of cells expressing CD1 Ag, suggesting that these TCR-gamma delta cells differentiate in the thymus. Among the CD1+, TCR-gamma delta + thymocytes, no TdT positivity can be detected.\r"

  ".U": "89080281\r", 
  ".W": "We have recently developed a culture system in which 90% of B cells from human peripheral blood or spleen are induced to strongly proliferate and generate short-term clones of a mean of about 400 antibody-secreting cells. B cells are stimulated by mutant EL-4 thymoma cells in conjunction with T cell supernatant. In the present study, we first investigated whether the frequency of B cell immortalization by EBV would be higher in this system than in a conventional system by using PBMC as fillers. The results showed that the EBV-dependent cloning frequency (0.7%) was not increased compared with the system with the use of PBMC (2.1%). However, the short term proliferation of EBV-infected B cells was 20 times increased in the EL-4 system and EBV nuclear Ag-positive cells participated in this response. Recent reports showed that transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) inhibited the growth of normal B cells, whereas the growth of EBV-immortalized (lymphoblastoid) cells was not inhibited. We have studied the effects of this cytokine in the EL-4 system. TGF-beta (200 pg/ml) was found to inhibit the proliferative response of normal B cells by greater than 95% and the short term response of EBV-infected B cells by 78%. In contrast, the EBV-dependent long term cloning frequency, as well as the proportion of clones producing IgM, IgG, or IgA, was not influenced at all by TGF-beta. In conclusion, potent modulation of the early proliferative response of an EBV-infected B cell population by either stimulatory or inhibitory exogenous signals did not influence the number of cells that subsequently became immortalized.\r"

  ".U": "89080282\r", 
  ".W": "Several human T cell derived factors capable of stimulating human B cells to synthesize DNA have been previously described. One such factor exhibits an apparent m.w. of 50,000 Da and has been termed 50-kDa-B cell growth factor (BCGF). In this report, we show that a human B cell proliferation pathway based on the sequential action of anti-mu antibody, 50-kDa-BCGF and IL-2 is inhibited in the presence of human rIL-4. Although IL-4 itself is capable of triggering B cell DNA synthesis as measured at 72 h, this lymphokine inhibits, in a dose-related manner, the 50-kDa-BCGF driven response of B cells to IL-2 when such proliferation is determined after 144 h. This inhibition takes place at an early step of the B cell activation and does not require the presence of IL-4 during the whole culture period. Such inhibitory activity of IL-4 is specific to the IL-2-induced B cell proliferation because DNA synthesis measured in the presence of semi-purified human 12-kDa-BCGF is not affected by the presence of IL-4. Our results suggest that a particular pathway of human B cell activation leading to the proliferation of these cells in the presence of IL-2 could be either up- or down-modulated by 50-kDa-BCGF and IL-4, respectively.\r"

  ".W": "A limiting dilution assay was developed to quantitate urushiol (the antigen of poison ivy; Toxicodendron radicans) specific T cells from peripheral blood of a patient with a history of rhus (poison ivy) dermatitis. It was found that maximal sensitivity with minimal nonspecific proliferation could be produced with the use of 5 U/ml of recombinant IL2 added to the assay on day 6. This donor was found to have a frequency of urushiol specific peripheral blood T cells of (1/2935). Five interleukin 2 (IL2) dependent urushiol specific T-cell clones were generated from the peripheral blood of this patient. These T-cell clones had a CD8+ (T8+) phenotype and proliferated specifically to both extracts of Toxicodendron radicans (poison ivy) leaves and pure urushiol. Pentadecylcatechol was an inferior antigen, only stimulating proliferation of one clone. The ability of all clones to proliferate to pure urushiol, despite their having been induced with leaf extract, suggests that urushiol, or closely related catechols, represent the only allergenic constituents of Toxicodendron radicans. Lymphokine production in response to antigen varied between (0.6-5.0) units/ml of interleukin 2 (IL2) and (1.0-120) units/ml of gamma interferon. Although none of the clones showed significant cytotoxicity against NK targets, three of five lines showed considerable cytotoxicity against concanavalin A treated (lectin approximated) targets. However, cytotoxicity for rhus conjugated autologous targets was not detected. It was found that several of these CD8+ clones could suppress IgG production in the presence of rhus antigen. The isolation of these T-cells from peripheral blood several months after rhus dermatitis suggests that these clones may have a role in down regulating delayed hypersensitivity to urushiol.\r"

  ".W": "The incorporation of precursor 14C-myoinositol into the three cellular inositol phospholipids (PtdIns, PtdInsP, and PtdInsP2) of cultured, rapidly proliferating keratinocytes is significantly enhanced by the exogenous addition of a high concentration (1 X 10(-7) M) of all-trans retinoic acid or its analog 13-Cis analog, whereas a similar incubation with a low concentration (1 X 10(-10) M) of the same retinoid resulted in an insignificant incorporation of the radio-precursor into the three inositol phospholipids. Incorporation was most marked into the more phosphorylated PtdIns4P and PtdIns4,5P2. These results indicate that retinoic acid affects the biosynthesis of the inositol phospholipids at high concentrations. In contrast, the hydrolysis of 14C-PtdIns4,5P2 and release of 14C-InsP3 from the prelabeled keratinocytes is markedly enhanced by a low physiologic concentration (1 X 10(-10) M) of retinoic acid or its 13-Cis analog. The hydrolysis is rapid, with an accompanying elevated transient release of 14C-InsP3. High concentration (1 X 10(-5) M), on the other hand, supresses 14C-InsP3 release. These results taken together underscore a bifunctional, dose-dependent effect of both the all-trans-RA and its 13-Cis analog on the synthesis and hydrolysis of keratinocyte PtdIns4,5P2. Furthermore, the results suggest that at low physiologic concentrations, these retinoids may function as agonists to perturb the membrane resulting in induced rapid hydrolysis of cellular PtdIns4,5P2, which is coupled to a \"transient\" generation of InsP3 (an intracellular second messenger). The rapid formation of this putative \"second messenger\" may in turn play a role in the cellular proliferative or differentiating biochemical events in the murine keratinocytes.\r"

During acute infection, virus was detected in neural and genital tissue homogenates, including the peripheral nerve, lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia (DRG), spinal cord, brain, vas deferens, epididymis, testes, seminal vesicle, and prostate. Recurrent disease developed in all animals. Persistent virus was detected in DRG but rarely in the vas deferens, seminal vesicle, epididymis, and testes. This model produces disease similar to that seen in men and should prove useful for studying the pathogenesis and immunology of male genital HSV type 2 infections.\r"

PAI-1 activity in these 65 patients was inversely correlated with t-PA activity, which was measured before and after venous occlusion. PAI-1 activity correlated positively with levels of triglycerides. There was a significant negative correlation between PAI-1 activity and levels of high-density lipoprotein. Each patient was placed in one of five groups according to the severity of coronary atherosclerosis, which ranged from normal vessels (group I) to greater than 50% occlusion of three vessels (group V). There were no significant differences among the five groups with respect to mean activity of PAI-1 (p = 0.98) or t-PA activity measured before venous occlusion (p = 0.22) or after occlusion (p = 0.70). T-PA and PAI-1 activities in these five groups were not different from those in 35 healthy men. These data indicate that there is no association between activities of PAI-1 or t-PA and coronary artery disease in this well-characterized male population.\r"

The amount of plasminogen in platelet concentrate converted to plasmin was estimated to be less than 3% by assay of total plasminogen. Supernatant plasma from stored platelet concentrates was examined for the presence of the complement activation peptides C3a and C5a. From day 0 to day 10 of storage, mean C3a levels rose from 327 ng/ml to 6690 ng/ml. An equivalent increase in C3a levels, from 336 ng/ml at day 0 to 6866 ng/ml at day 10, was also observed in stored platelet-poor plasma. C5a was not detected (less than 10 ng/ml) at any point during the storage period; however, we noted a small decrease of borderline significance (p = 0.04) in total C5 from day 0 (117 micrograms/ml) to day 10 (108 micrograms/ml). Only trace amounts of C3 fragments were found on stored platelets, and there was no evidence of the membrane attack complex. These findings indicate the presence of plasmin activity and conversion of C3 during storage of platelet concentrates.\r"

Treatment with IL-2 is associated with significant cardiorespiratory effects, as well as a leaky capillary syndrome requiring careful fluid management. A mild reversible depression of cardiac function is also associated with IL-2 treatment. All patients treated with recombinant IL-2 alone, with transfer of LAK cells, or with cyclophosphamide between December 1984 and September 1987 (total of 423 treatment courses in 317 total patients) were evaluated as to the development of significant cardiorespiratory toxicity. Of the 423 treatment courses, only 1.8% were associated with severe peripheral edema and only 2.8% and 3.1% respectively, were associated with significant ascites or pleural effusions. Thirty-nine of 423 patients (9.2%) had severe respiratory distress and 27 patients required intubation (6.4%). Cardiovascular effects included tachycardia and hypotension requiring vasopressor administration in 65% and intravenous (IV) fluid administration. Weight gain greater than or equal to 10% of body weight was noted in 32% of the 423 patients. Arrhythmias were primarily supraventricular (9.7%) and responded well to conventional medical treatments. Angina or ischemic changes were noted in 2.6% of patients and myocardial infarction in 1.2%. IL-2 caused peripheral vasodilation, with a significant decrease in peripheral vascular resistance (2,254 +/- 398 v 1,303 +/- 351 dyne.s.cm-5, P less than .0001), and an increase in heart rate (66.2 +/- 10 v 104.3 +/- 9.6 beats/min, P less than .0001). There was also evidence of mild cardiac dysfunction, with a significant decrease in the left ventricular stroke work (LVSW) index (P less than .0001) and ejection fraction (LVEF) (from 58% +/- 10% to 52% +/- 9%, P less than .03). A repeat LVEF performed after 1 to 3 months, had returned to baseline values (60% +/- 10%). A mean 64% increase in the rate of disappearance of radioactive iodine (125I) albumin (P less than .05) consistent with the development of a leaky capillary syndrome was noted. Patients with underlying cardiorespiratory diseases may be at greater risk during IL-2 administration and should not be selected to undergo this treatment.\r"

Eligibility criteria included measurable disease, Karnofsky performance greater than or equal to 70%, age greater than 18 years, and adequate bone marrow, renal, and hepatic function. The median age of 35 patients was 56 years (range, 20 to 75). Diagnoses included malignant lymphoma (ML), (nine patients), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (eight), melanoma (eight), colorectal cancer (six), renal cancer (two), and breast cancer (two). The initial 18 patients were treated with 1 mg/m2 (3 x 10(6) U/m2 intravenous [IV] bolus) for five days every other week for a total of 4 treatment weeks (8 weeks total). The subsequent 17 patients were treated with 0.5 mg/m2 (1.5 x 10(6) U/m2). All patients were evaluable for toxicity, and 26 for tumor response. Toxicities included fatigue (71%), nausea (69%), hypotension (54%), fever (51%), chills (40%), weight gain (37%), pruritis or rash (31%), dyspnea (14%), azotemia (6%), confusion (6%), thrombocytopenia (6%), and myocardial infarction (3%). Four patients died from apparently unrelated causes within the first 2 weeks of treatment. Treatment was discontinued before the completion of 8 weeks of treatment because of progressive disease (12 patients), severe hypotension (three), azotemia (one), myocardial infarction (one), early death (four), and miscellaneous causes (two). IL-2 at 1 mg/m2 IV for five days is associated with moderate toxicity, but a dose of 0.5 mg/m2 is tolerable for outpatient administration. Three partial responses (PR) and one minor response (MR) lasting 1 to 17+ months have been observed in 12 patients with ML and CLL evaluable for response. One additional MR was observed in a patient with melanoma. IL-2 deserves further study in patients with ML and CLL.\r"

A bioassay system was developed to measure the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) from canine basilar arteries. Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) was induced in dogs by two injections of autologous blood into the cisterna magna. Angiograms were performed on the 7th day after SAH to check the presence of chronic vasospasm. The animals were sacrificed on the 8th day, and in vitro experiments were performed on rings harvested from the basilar artery. These confirmed loss of endothelium-dependent relaxation in response to bradykinin and arginine vasopressin in the group with SAH. The basilar arteries were perfused with modified Krebs-Ringer solution. The perfusate was bioassayed with a ring of coronary artery without endothelium (bioassay ring). The release of the EDRF was detected by relaxation of the bioassay ring contracted with prostaglandin F2 alpha. Arginine vasopressin and bradykinin added to the perfusate upstream of the basilar artery caused concentration-dependent release of the EDRF. The direct effect of these peptides on the smooth muscle of the bioassay ring was to cause contraction. The release of the EDRF was identical in basilar arteries from the control and the SAH groups. These results indicate that the release of the EDRF is not impaired during chronic vasospasm, and thus that the loss of the endothelium-dependent relaxation is due to a decreased transfer of the EDRF or a reduced responsiveness of the smooth muscle to the factor.\r"

The extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass trial has been criticized for failing to identify and separately analyze those patients with chronic reduction in regional cerebral perfusion pressure (rCPP) who might be most likely to benefit from surgery. Positron emission tomography (PET) measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and blood volume (rCBV) were performed on 29 patients with symptomatic occlusion or intracranial stenosis of the carotid arterial system prior to undergoing EC-IC bypass surgery. Twenty-four patients had evidence of reduced rCPP (increased rCBV/rCBF ratio) distal to the arterial lesion. Of 21 patients who survived surgery without stroke, three suffered ipsilateral ischemic strokes during the 1st postoperative year. A nonrandomized control group of 23 nonsurgical patients' with similar clinical, arteriographic, and PET characteristics experienced no ipsilateral ischemic strokes during the 1st year following PET. Based on these results in 44 patients, the probability that successful surgery reduces the occurrence of ipsilateral ischemic stroke 1 year later was calculated. This probability ranged from 0.045 for a 50% reduction to 0.168 for a 10% reduction. Thus, there was little evidence to suggest that measurements of cerebral hemodynamics can identify a group of patients who would benefit from EC-IC bypass surgery.\r"

In tumor and peritumoral tissue, the transfer constants in the IL-2-treated animals (89.6 +/- 14.6 and 35.8 +/- 6.0, respectively, mean +/- standard error of the mean) were larger (p less than 0.05) than in control animals (61.4 +/- 6.4 and 14.6 +/- 2.2, respectively). In contrast, in normal frontal and occipital tissue contralateral to the tumor-bearing hemisphere, there was no significant difference between the transfer constants in IL-2-treated and control animals. Furthermore, treatment of animals with IL-2 excipient caused no change in permeability as compared to animals treated with Hanks' balanced salt solution. Parenteral injection of IL-2 increases blood-brain barrier disruption in tumor-bearing rat brain but does not increase the vascular permeability of normal brain. Methods to prevent this increased tumor vessel permeability are required before parenteral IL-2 can be used safely for the treatment of primary or metastatic brain tumors.\r"

Fourteen patients (52%) had a connective tissue disease, four (15%) had a probable connective tissue disease, and nine (33%) had primary Raynaud syndrome. In all patients with either a connective tissue disease or a probable connective tissue disease, there was a positive reaction to antinuclear antibody, in contrast to patients with primary Raynaud syndrome, in whom antinuclear antibody was not detected. Nail-fold capillary microscopy scores differed significantly between patients with either a connective tissue disease or a probable connective tissue disease and those with primary Raynaud syndrome for both enlarged loop score (p less than 0.025 and less than 0.05, respectively) and avascular score (p less than 0.005 and less than 0.01, respectively). Photoelectric plethysmography scores were reduced in all groups but did not differ significantly between groups. Our findings suggest that in children with Raynaud syndrome, the primary type is more common than was originally suspected, and that both antinuclear antibody and nail-fold capillary microscopy, but not photoelectric plethysmography, can distinguish patients with primary Raynaud syndrome from those with either a connective tissue disease or a probable connective tissue disease.\r"

Trichomonas vaginalis remained significantly associated with symptoms of yellow vaginal discharge (odds ratio [OR] = 2.4) and vulvar itching (OR = 3.0) and with signs of colpitis macularis (OR = 241), purulent vaginal discharge (OR = 8.0), vulvar erythema (OR = 2.5), and vaginal erythema (OR = 4.3). The sensitivity of symptoms and signs associated with trichomoniasis was relatively low. Nevertheless, clinical manifestations can be used to identify those patients for whom a wet-mount examination would likely have high yield. Careful clinical examination and selective use of wet-mount examination together with wider use of more sensitive tests for subclinical infection, such as culture or direct immunofluorescent staining of vaginal fluid, could lead to improved detection and control of this infection.\r"

Infections of the genital tract contributed half of this morbidity. Only 8% of the women had undergone gynaecological examination and treatment in the past. There was an association between presence of gynaecological diseases and use of female methods of contraception, but this could explain only a small fraction of the morbidity. In the rural areas of developing countries, gynaecological and sexual care should be part of primary health care.\r"

  ".W": "The CD8 (Lyt 2) molecule is a phenotypic marker for T lymphocytes that recognize and react with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. Antibody blocking experiments and gene transfection studies indicate that CD8 binds to a determinant on MHC class I molecules on the target cells, facilitating interaction between effector T lymphocytes and the target cell. The CD8 molecule may also be involved in transmembrane signalling during T-cell activation. The existence of CD8- cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and class I-reactive CTL that are not inhibited by antibody to CD8 suggests that at least some CTL do not require the CD8 molecule to interact with and lyse target cells. We have recently demonstrated that cells transfected with an H-2Dd gene that carries a mutation at residue 227 are not killed by primary CTL8. Here we show that although this mutation abrogates recognition by primary CTL, it does not affect recognition by CD8-independent CTL, suggesting that residue 227 of class I molecules might contribute to a determinant that is the ligand of the CD8 molecule.\r"

PET using (F-18) fluorodeoxyglucose was performed in three patients, revealing hypometabolic lesions. All six patients are alive and well, with no clinical or radiographic evidence of progressive disease at 24 to 57+ months following termination of treatment. The usual criteria for terminating phase II chemotherapy in patients with a recurrent brain tumor are evidence of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. However, chemotherapeutic success mandates that these criteria be expanded to include patients whose response following the initiation of phase II treatment is followed by prolonged (greater than 1 year) radiographic and clinical stability. Complete response, ie, disappearance of all evidence of disease, is unusual in patients with recurrent primary brain tumors, even with highly effective therapy. Continued improvement in the therapy of patients with these tumors will allow wider application of these criteria.\r"

The former formula contained 42% of 8:0 and 10:0 and 19% of 12:0, 14:0, and 16:0; the latter formula contained only 7% of 8:0 and 10:0 and 46% of 12:0, 14:0, and 16:0. Gastric aspirates were obtained on the second and third day of formula feeding for quantitation of lipase activity and of the extent of gastric lipolysis. Fat balance studies were conducted during the last three days of each feeding regimen. The study showed that (1) there was marked hydrolysis of formula fat in the stomach during feeding of either medium-chain triglyceride formula or long-chain triglyceride formula (20% and 16%, respectively); (2) lipase activity in the gastric aspirates was less during feeding of medium-chain triglyceride formula than before the meal, which suggested stimulation of lipase secretion by long-chain fatty acid released from long-chain triglyceride formula fat or more rapid binding of lipase to ingested lipid in the medium-chain triglyceride formula; (3) fatty acid distribution in glycerides and free fatty acids showed preferential release of medium-chain (8:0, 10:0) and long-chain unsaturated (18:1, 18:2) fatty acids in the stomach. The low content of 8:0 and 10:0 in gastric triglyceride and free fatty acids suggested that medium-chain fatty acids were absorbed directly in the stomach.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ejection fraction averaged 70 +/- 14%. Eight percent of patients had 1-vessel CAD and 92% had multiple-vessel CAD. Medical treatment included propranolol, nifedipine, isosorbide dinitrate, dipyridamole and aspirin. Annual mortality was 0% for 1- and 2-vessel CAD and 1.3% for left main equivalent disease, 3-vessel and left main CAD. Treatment significantly reduced the incidence of stable and unstable angina. Fifty-two patients (34%) had a second hemodynamic study 4.2 +/- 1.3 years after initial evaluation. Stenosis progression or new significant obstructions (greater than or equal to 70%) in previously normal coronary arteries occurred in 61% of 123 arteries studied, whereas new occlusions were observed in 12% of the arteries. Nonfatal acute myocardial infarction incidence was 8%. No significant changes occurred in ejection fraction. In conclusion, proper medical treatment in selected patients with advanced CAD but preserved ventricular function is associated with good long-term survival and remission of symptoms, although progression of coronary atherosclerosis does occur in some patients.\r"

The plasmacytoma furthermore reacted with CD30(Ki-1), a reactivity that for this tumor type has not been reported before. Subsequently, normal gastric mucosae affected by all degrees of chronic gastritis were examined. On the basis of serial sections, 5-15% of CD38(OKT10) reactive mucosal plasma cells were observed to also react with CD30(Ki-1).

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Since the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was first described in 1981, we have observed an increasing number of cases of Haemophilus influenzae pneumonia, particularly in young adult patients. To confirm this observation, we systematically identified and reviewed all cases of H. influenzae pneumonia that occurred in adult patients recently hospitalized at our institution. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using a strict case definition, we identified all cases of adult H. influenzae pneumonia that were observed during a recent 32-month period at our institution, a large teaching hospital in New York City. We further reviewed each case record for evidence of AIDS, AIDS-related complex (ARC), or risk of AIDS. RESULTS: H. influenzae pneumonia was diagnosed in 51 adults. Thirty-four cases occurred in young adults (mean age = 33.9 years) with AIDS risk factors, including 23 (67 percent) intravenous drug abusers, six (18 percent) homosexual men, and five (15 percent) with both risks. Nine patients (26 percent) had a previous or concurrent diagnosis of AIDS, four (12 percent) developed AIDS later, and 13 (38 percent) others had ARC. The common presenting symptoms in young adult patients with H. influenzae pneumonia were fever (100 percent), productive cough (100 percent), chest pain (53 percent), and dyspnea (47 percent). Lung consolidation was detected on physical examination in 20 (59 percent), and chest radiograph demonstrated unilateral infiltrates in 18 (53 percent) and bilateral infiltrates in 16 (47 percent), with pleural effusions in three (nine percent). Most patients had an elevated white blood cell count (mean = 9.6 X 10(9)/liter) with a left shift in 22 (65 percent), and hypoxia on room air (mean partial pressure of oxygen = 69 mm Hg). Four patients with H. influenzae pneumonia and coexisting Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia had diffuse, bilateral infiltrates on chest radiograph, with significantly more dyspnea and a higher serum lactate dehydrogenase level than the others. All but one patient showed improvement with appropriate therapy. CONCLUSION: We conclude that potentially serious pneumonia caused by H. influenzae occurs in young adult patients with AIDS, ARC, or AIDS risk.\r"

We therefore measured levels of the complement activation products C1-C1-inhibitor complexes and C3a in serial plasma samples (obtained every six hours) from 48 patients with clinically suspected sepsis, and related these levels to the clinical outcome. C4a was also measured in samples obtained on admission. RESULTS: C3a levels were elevated in 47 patients at least once during the observation period. These levels appeared to be considerably higher in patients who died than in patients who survived. This difference was found for the levels on admission (p = 0.0003), as well as for the highest (p = 0.0010) and the lowest (p less than 0.0001) levels encountered in each patient. The mortality in patients with plasma C3a levels of 13 nmol/liter or less on admission (27 patients) was 33 percent, compared with 86 percent in patients with levels of 14 nmol/liter or more. Patients with septic shock had significantly higher C3a levels than normotensive patients (p values between 0.046 and 0.004). No significant differences in C3a were found between patients who had respiratory distress syndrome and those who did not. C4a levels in plasma samples obtained on admission were elevated in 43 patients. These levels correlated very significantly with C3a levels (p less than 0.0001), and showed similar associations with a fatal outcome. C1-C1-inhibitor complexes were elevated in 23 patients at least once during the observation period. These patients had significantly higher levels of C4a and C3a than patients with normal amounts of C1-C1-inhibitor complexes. Patients who died had higher levels of C1-C1-inhibitor complexes than patients who survived. However, this difference was not significant. CONCLUSION: On the basis of our results, we propose that activation of the complement system via the classical pathway is involved in the development of fatal complications in sepsis.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Although clusters of individuals infected with the human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type I (HTLV-I) have been identified in the United States, no systematic evaluation of the immunologic status of these persons has been reported. We therefore studied a group of 11 HTLV-I-infected former intravenous drug abusers who were long-term participants in a methadone maintenance program in New Orleans, Louisiana, to determine the effects of HTLV-I and chronic opiate use on immunity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Mitogenic responses and results of serologic studies, cell phenotype analysis, and cytotoxicity assays were compared to those in two other HTLV-I seronegative groups: a similar group of 17 methadone users and 15 healthy age-, sex-, and race-matched control subjects. All study participants were seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus type 1. RESULTS: Percentages and numbers of total T lymphocytes (CD2+,CD3+), T-suppressor/cytotoxic lymphocytes (CD8+), cytotoxic lymphocytes (Leu7+, Leu11+, NKH-1+) and B lymphocytes (B4+) were similar among the study groups. Although percentages and numbers of total T-helper lymphocytes (CD4+) were also similar among the groups, HTLV-I-infected subjects had higher percentages and proportions of helper/inducer cells (CD4:4B4+) than did HTLV-I seronegative methadone users. Both methadone using groups had decreased percentages and numbers of suppressor/inducer T lymphocytes (CD4:2H4+). Major histocompatibility complex unrestricted T-cell cytotoxicity (lectin-dependent cellular cytotoxicity), natural killer cell function, and mitogenic responses to the T-cell mitogen phytohemagglutin were similar among the three study groups. Pokeweed mitogen responses were severely depressed in the HTLV-I-infected population. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that HTLV-I infection is associated with abnormalities in T-cell-dependent B-cell proliferative responses. Furthermore, both long-term methadone use and HTLV-I infection are associated with abnormalities in the distribution of CD4+ cell subpopulations. The increase in the helper/inducer and T-cell cell populations and decrease in the pokeweed mitogenic response noted in HTLV-I-infected subjects appear to be markers for infection with this retrovirus.\r"

Data revealed that 60% of the physicians reported medium to high emotional exhaustion and 78% medium to high depersonalization, while 84% reported medium to high levels of personal achievement. Physicians who reported high levels of job satisfaction and personal accomplishment use a balanced number of short- and long-term coping methods in dealing with stress. Further studies should be undertaken to facilitate in-depth analysis of the characteristics of those emergency physicians who report low levels of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization as well as high levels of personal achievement to identify factors that lead to the successful practice of emergency medicine.\r"

Lymphocyte activation has been shown to be accompanied by the appearance of new surface antigens, including Interleukin-2 (IL-2) deceptor (IL-2R) and Ia, and emergence of cells that coexpress helper (Th) and suppressor (Ts) surface markers. IL-2R has been shown to appear early on stimulated cells, before DNA synthesis, whereas Ia appears later. Surface markers (L3T4, Lyt2, Ia, and IL-2R) were analyzed at time 0 and after 24, 48, and 72 hours of mitogen-stimulated culture. The appearance of IL-2R and Ia on Th (L3T4+) and Ts (Lyt-2+) populations was markedly depressed after burn injury, but minimal changes were seen after musculoskeletal injury. In addition, coexpression of L3T4/Lyt2 antigens was markedly reduced in burn-derived cells. Serum from burn-injured animals caused depression of surface antigen expression by stimulated normal cells. Recombinant IL-2, when added to burn-derived cell cultures, did not increase expression of these surface markers during culture, nor did it improve proliferation.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical use of interleukin-2 (IL-2) is limited by severe cardiopulmonary dysfunction. This study examines the mechanism of respiratory failure related to IL-2, using sheep with chronic lung lymph fistulae. Awake animals were infused with an intravenous (I.V.) bolus of IL-2 10(5) U/kg (n = 5) or its excipient (EXC) control (n = 3), every 8 hours for 4 to 5 days. Cardiopulmonary function was monitored daily for at least one 8-hour period. Within 2 hours after each IL-2 administration, mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP) rose. On Day 1, the mean rise was from 13 to 26 mmHg (p less than 0.05), and on Day 5, to 29 mmHg (p less than 0.05). MPAP returned to baseline levels after 2-3 hours. Pulmonary arterial wedge pressure was unchanged from 4 mmHg. There were transient falls in arterial oxygen tension, from 88 to 77 mmHg on Day 1 and to 73 mmHg (p less than 0.05) on Day 5. Lung lymph flow (QL) rose from 2.4 to 6.8 ml/30 minutes (p less than 0.05) on Day 1, and from 4.7 to 10.2 ml/30 minutes (p less than 0.05) on Day 5, whereas the lymph/plasma protein ratio increased on Day 1 from 0.69 to 0.83 (p less than 0.05) and from 0.63 to 0.71 (p less than 0.05) on Day 5. This documents an increase in pulmonary microvascular permeability. Thromboxane (Tx)B2 levels increased transiently after each IL-2 injection in plasma from 195 to 340 pg/ml (p less than 0.05) and in lung lymph from 222 to 772 pg/ml (p less than 0.05) on Day 1, and to similar levels on Day 5. There was a progressive rise in cardiac output from 5.7 to 8.6 1/minute (p less than 0.05) during the 5 days of infusion. Systemic blood pressure did not change. Temperature rose from 39.1 to 41.2 C (p less than 0.05), and shaking chills were common. There was a progressive fall in leukocyte count, from 8.4 to 3.2 X 10(3)/mm3 (p less than 0.05) by Day 5, reflecting a 77% fall in lymphocytes. Lung lymph lymphocyte counts rose, and lymphocyte clearance increased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We found that both interleukin 2 and interleukin 6 are required for optimal generation of CTL from murine thymocytes. Timing studies show that neither lymphokine alone in culture will produce maximum CTL levels during the first 84 hours of culture. In addition, we found that thymocytes cultured with concanavalin A are unresponsive unless either interleukin 2 or interleukin 6 is present from the onset of culture.\r"

The three aphasic syndromes differed in the degree of left-to-right frontal metabolic asymmetry, with Broca's aphasia showing severe asymmetry and Wernicke's aphasia mild-to-moderate metabolic asymmetry, while patients with conduction aphasia were metabolically symmetric. On the other hand, the three syndromes showed the same degree of metabolic decline in the left temporal region. The parietal region appeared to separate conduction aphasia from both Broca's and Wernicke's aphasias. Common aphasic features in the three syndromes appear to be due to common changes in the temporal region, while unique features were associated with frontal and parietal metabolic differences.\r"

By using xenon 133 inhalation and emission tomography, the regional cerebral blood flow distribution was determined and compared with a control group. Striatal regions were found to be hypoperfused and, by inference, hypofunctional in both groups. This hypoperfusion was statistically significant in the right striatum in ADHD, and in both striatal regions in ADHD with other neuropsychologic and neurologic symptoms. The primary sensory and sensorimotor cortical regions were highly perfused. Methylphenidate increased flow to striatal and posterior periventricular regions, and tended to decrease flow to primary sensory regions. Low striatal activity, partially reversible with methylphenidate, appears to be a cardinal feature in ADHD.\r"

Of patients treated with ganciclovir for their CMV retinitis, 81% had a response to the drug, and 61% achieved a complete response, resulting in a nonprogressive and inactive scar.

The bone marrow showed no significant changes at 1.5 hours, suggesting that the peripheral neutrophilia at that time is caused by demargination of intravascular neutrophils and not by release of marrow neutrophils. The bone marrow at 12 hours showed a mild left-shifted myeloid hyperplasia of myeloblasts and promyelocytes and a tremendous erythroid hyperplasia of intermediate and late normoblasts. The bone marrow at 24 hours showed a continued mild myeloid hyperplasia and striking erythroid hyperplasia. In conclusion, IL-6 in vivo acts as a stimulus for myelopoiesis and erythropoiesis and causes accompanying peripheral changes in the number of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and RBCs.\r"

Our objective was to determine whether protein kinase C has a role in signal transduction related to proliferation of these committed progenitor cells. The presence of H-7 or staurosporine led to an inhibition of colony formation stimulated by crude colony-stimulating factor (CSF), interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), granulocyte CSF (G-CSF), or macrophage CSF (M-CSF) in a dose-dependent manner. N-(2-guanidinoethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (HA-1004), a weaker analog of H-7, did not inhibit proliferation of CFU-C. Neither H-7 nor staurosporine had any effect on CFU-E formation. H-7 and staurosporine dose-dependently inhibited the protein kinase C from K562 cells. The potential of these compounds to inhibit proliferation of CFU-C correlated well with the magnitude of their inhibition of protein kinase C from K562 cells. The inhibition of proliferation of CFU-C appears to relate to the potential of these compounds to inhibit protein kinase C. Thus, activation of protein kinase C is presumably involved in the proliferation of CFU-C, and the regulatory system of CFU-E appears to differ from that of CFU-C.\r"

The IL-3 mRNA is localized in discrete areas of the brain and can be found in neuronal cell body and astrocytes.

  ".W": "We have studied the pattern of expression of the lymphokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF alpha) and lymphotoxin (TNF beta) in T-cell lines established by transformation with human T-lymphotropic virus, type I (HTLV-I), the etiologic agent of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). We report here that nine of nine HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines, established by in vitro infection with HTLV-I, including those with CD4+ or CD8+ as well as CD4-/CD8- phenotypes, constitutively produce high levels of TNF alpha and -beta mRNA and secrete biologically active TNF beta into the culture medium. Similar patterns of expression are seen in six of six HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines directly established from ATL patients. In contrast, several T-cell lines, either uninfected or infected with human immunodeficiency virus I, did not produce comparable levels of the TNF beta. Comparisons of a normal functional T-cell clone before and after infection with HTLV-I show that expression of TNF beta mRNA is induced in the infected cells. The high level expression in HTLV-I-infected cell lines dose not seem to involve perturbation of the TNF alpha/beta genetic loci by proviral integration. A cell line (81-66/45) nonproductively transformed with HTLV-I that produces tat-1 in the absence of viral structural proteins, produces both TNF alpha and -beta mRNA. This suggests that expression of these cytokines could be mediated in trans by the tat-1 gene product.\r"

  ".W": "Human B lymphocytes undergo distinct phenotypic changes following activation with antigen and polyclonal mitogens. Increasing interest has focused on the unique subpopulation of B cells that expresses the CD5 antigen. In this study, we examined the signals that induce the expression of CD5 on normal splenic B cells. Only 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induced CD5 expression on highly purified splenic B cells, whereas anti-immunoglobulin (anti-Ig), Epstein-Barr virus, anti-CD20, recombinant interleukin-1 (rIL-1), rIL-2, rIL-4, recombinant interferon-gamma (rINF-gamma), and B-cell growth factor all failed to induce CD5 expression. The expression of CD5 was detected on the cell surface by 48 hours and decreased by 96 hours. Dual-fluorochrome analysis demonstrated that the CD5+ B cells coexpressed the B-cell activation antigens B5, IL-2 receptor, and CD23, thereby providing phenotypic evidence that this B-cell subpopulation is activated. In vitro studies of dual-fluorochrome-sorted, TPA-stimulated splenic B cells demonstrated significantly greater tritiated thymidine incorporation and Ig secretion by the CD20+ CD5- cells than by the CD20+ CD5+ subset. These phenotypic and functional studies are consistent with the notion that TPA-induced CD5+ B cells are a subset of in vitro activated B lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a critical component in the oxygen-dependent microbicidal activity of neutrophils. Hereditary deficiency of MPO occurs commonly, but its genetic basis has not been determined. Previously we have reported the presence of an 89-kilodalton protein, likely pro-MPO, in normal and MPO-deficient neutrophils and hypothesized that the absence of peroxidase activity in neutrophils from affected subjects was the result of defective posttranslational processing of pro-MPO. In this study we analyzed nucleic acids from three completely and two partially MPO-deficient individuals by using a cDNA probe for MPO. The affected individuals studied are unrelated to one another. Neutrophils from all affected subjects lacked mature MPO subunits; however, a monospecific antibody for MPO identified in these cells a high-molecular weight protein that is the same size as pro-MPO. Northern blots demonstrated that the amount and size of RNA (3.3 kilobases [kb]) in a completely deficient subject was normal. BglII digests of genomic DNA from control individuals (n = 14) contained three fragments that hybridized with cDNA for MPO under very stringent conditions. In contrast, BglII digests of genomic DNA from completely MPO-deficient individuals contained an extra fragment of 2.1 kb that was not present in DNA from controls. In addition, two different endonuclease digest patterns were found in MPO-deficient subjects who were biochemically and phenotypically identical. We conclude from these studies that (a) hereditary MPO deficiency is not associated with a major deletion or rearrangement of the MPO gene; (b) myeloid precursors in an MPO-deficient individual contain normal amounts of an mRNA that is the same size as that for MPO in normal individuals; and (c) the genetic basis for MPO deficiency may be heterogeneous, with at least two genotypes generating the same phenotype. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the genetic defect in MPO deficiency results in synthesis of a modified pro-MPO that undergoes defective posttranslational processing.\r"

  ".W": "Immune function in patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) was examined serially during treatment with alternating monthly cycles of recombinant interferon alpha-2a and 2'-deoxycoformycin (dCF). At presentation, most patients had normal numbers of T lymphocytes and their cells had normal proliferative responses to mitogens [phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and concanavalin A (Con A)] and alloantigens. Patients had severe monocytopenia, decreased delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions, and decreased peripheral blood natural killer (NK) activity. Treatment caused a profound decrease in all lymphocyte subpopulations. T cells were more affected than B cells or NK cells. Numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes decreased to levels less than 200 cells/microliters in all patients during treatment. This decrease in T cell number was associated with a marked decrease in proliferative responsiveness to PHA, Con A, and alloantigens. These abnormalities persisted throughout the 14 months of treatment and have continued for up to 6 months beyond discontinuation of treatment. NK cell activity increased during treatment, but cycled depending on the phase of treatment; highest activities were observed after interferon (IFN)-alpha and lower levels of activity were observed after dCF. DTH responses generally did not improve during therapy. Levels of IgM, IgG, IgA, and IgD did not change during treatment, but IgE levels rose in most patients. All immunosuppressive effects were attributable to dCF since patients receiving IFN-alpha 2a alone did not exhibit these same immunosuppressive effects, and patients receiving dCF alone after IFN failure exhibited similar abnormalities. Despite this severe immunosuppression from dCF, life-threatening opportunistic infections have not been observed in our patient population. Six patients developed localized Herpes zoster infection among 21 patients who had received dCF. Pending the results of long-term follow-up, we recommend that dCF be reserved for patients who have failed splenectomy and IFN therapy.\r"

Thirteen patients rapidly achieved complete remissions (CR) (median, 16 weeks). Previous splenectomy (two patients), or chemotherapy (two patients) had no effect on dCF response. Twelve patients have remained in CR. Patients with marked BM infiltration (hairy cell index [HCI] greater than 0.5; n = 5) had more pronounced pancytopenia and showed a slower hematologic recovery than those with a lesser degrees of infiltration. Additionally, patients with cytologic type II HCL (n = 5) had more pronounced pancytopenia with a greater tumor load in the BM, and exhibited slower hematologic recovery than those with type I (n = 5) HCL. There was a gradual decline in BM cellularity from 65% to 25% during year 1, a level which remained stable thereafter. Reticulin in the BM regressed in all nine patients in whom it was increased before dCF therapy. The authors have not seen any dysplastic changes in the hematopoietic cells during the period of follow-up.\r"

Clinical data were reviewed from 134 cases of peripheral T-cell lymphoma diagnosed in three centers. The median age of the patients was 57 years (range, 4-97 years), 59% were male, and 36 patients (27%) had a history of a preceding disorder of the immune system. The tumors were grouped histologically into large cell (43%), mixed large and small cell (40%), and small cell (17%). The stage at diagnosis was I (7%), II (21%), III (22%), and IV (50%). B symptoms were present in 57%. The most frequent sites of extranodal involvement were bone marrow (35%), skin (13%), and lung (11%). Eighty patients were treated with a multiagent chemotherapy regimen with proven curative potential in aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and the remainder of the patients received less intensive chemotherapy (36 patients), radiotherapy (nine patients), or no treatment (nine patients). Fifty percent of the intensively treated patients achieved complete remission and the actuarial 4-year survival was 45%. However, the 4-year, disease-free survival in patients with Stage IV disease was only 10%. Although peripheral T-cell lymphomas appeared similar in many ways to their B-cell counterparts, disease-free survival by stage was low and patients with Stage IV disease had an especially poor outlook.\r"

The erythroleukemia cell line K562 was used as a target cell. The newly diagnosed group included eight patients with localized disease (Stage I-II), ten with bulky but nonmetastatic disease (Stage III), and three with metastases (Stage IV). The mean percent of NK cell activity in the newly diagnosed group was significantly higher than that of the control group. Children with Stage III tumors at diagnosis had higher mean NK cell function than those with Stage I-II and Stage IV. On therapy patients had significantly fewer NK cells and lower NK cell cytotoxicity than those in the other groups studied. We also studied the following: (1) the in vitro effect of recombinant interferon-alpha (rIFN-alpha) and recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) on NK cell function of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from children with solid malignancies; and (2) the susceptibility of neuroblastoma-derived (CHP-126 and SKNSH) and rhabdomyosarcoma-derived (A-204) cell lines to NK cell lysis. Both rIFN-alpha and rIL-2 enhanced NK cell activity of PBL from children with malignancies and healthy children against K562 and solid tumor cell lines. The enhancing effect or rIL-2 was greater than that of rIFN-alpha. CHP-126 and SKNSH cell lines were susceptible to NK cell lysis mediated by the PBL of children with neuroblastoma and the control group. The A-204 cell line was less sensitive than K562 to NK cell cytotoxicity. Our results suggest a potential therapeutic role for both cytokines in the treatment of malignant solid tumors of childhood.\r"

Increased immunoglobulin synthesis with autoantibody formation was documented: polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia (six patients), neutrophil autoantibody (one patient), antinuclear antibody (one patient), and rheumatoid factor (five patients). In addition, serum beta 2-microglobulin level was raised in seven patients, a benign monoclonal gammopathy was detected in one, and concurrent B-type hairy cell leukemia in another. Most patients experienced the complications of hemocytopenia, polyarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, and immediate allergic reactions to drugs or environmental substances, rather than from symptoms of progressive LGL/NK-PD. A review of the literature confirms that an increased immunoglobulin production is common in LGL/NK-PD, and that patients are likely to develop multiple autoantibodies. The incapacity of proliferating, abnormal LGL/NK cells to suppress B-cell activation and immunoglobulin synthesis, documented by several in vitro studies, offers a pathogenetic explanation for these phenomena. This study shows that an anomalous B-cell function contributes greatly to the morbidity of disease in LGL/NK-PD, and points out the utility of investigating the LGL/NK cell system in patients with autoimmune pathologic characteristics of unclear origin.\r"

The optimal dose rates for 5-FU plus LCV were 200 mg/m2/d and 5 mg/m2/d, respectively. The optimal dose rates for 5-FUdR plus LCV were 0.075 mg/kg/d and 5 mg/m2/d, respectively. The dose rate limiting toxicity for 5-FU plus LCV was stomatitis and for 5-FUdR plus LCV it was diarrhea. LCV administered as an admixture with either 5-FU or 5-FUdR on an infusion schedule decreases the optimally tolerated dose rates for these two agents to 83% and 60%, respectively.

Myocardial 11C activity clearance kinetics after intravenous administration of [1-11C]acetate in dogs have been determined noninvasively by positron emission tomography. Biexponential fitting of regional myocardial 11C time-activity curves was performed to give clearance half-times and fractional distribution. The rate constant k1 for the early rapid phase of 11C activity clearance was found to correlate linearly with myocardial oxygen consumption (y = 0.0156x + 0.039; SEE = 0.023; r = 0.95). k1 was approximately 7% lower in septal sectors compared with the left ventricular free wall, suggesting that regional oxygen consumption in the septum was lower; a concomitant regional attenuation of blood flow in the septum relative to the left ventricular free wall was also observed. In dogs using carbohydrates as the predominant fuel, k1 oxygen consumption was somewhat more than in dogs using predominantly free fatty acids (0.021 +/- 0.002 compared with 0.018 +/- 0.002, p less than 0.01), indicating that increased carbohydrate consumption is associated with a small increase in k1 at constant oxygen consumption. It is concluded that measurement of myocardial [1-11C]acetate kinetics allows noninvasive determination of cardiac oxygen consumption by positron emission tomography and that the technique is relatively insensitive to myocardial fuel selection.\r"

Responses, received from 219 (36.5%) parents, indicated only 1 percent did not utilize adequate prenatal care. Women made an average of 11.3 visits during their pregnancies; 83 percent saw their prenatal health care provider at least 10 times. Well-child visits were less adequately utilized, an average of 6.3 visits per child. Fifty-six percent made fewer than seven visits; only 23 percent made all of the nine visits recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Patients who made seven or more well-child visits were more likely to have received their fourth diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus (DTP) immunization and to have health insurance policies that paid for preventive health care services. Results indicate that families use preventive services more consistently before the birth of their children than after. Use of preventive services is associated with adequate insurance coverage and results in more thorough immunization.\r"

In this group, the fertilization rate was 86.7% of the yielded oocytes, and the viable pregnancy rate per patient per cycle was 26.9% (P less than 0.05).

  ".W": "The effects of pertussis toxin and cholera toxin on early events of T lymphocyte activation were examined in the T lymphocyte cell line, Jurkat. Pertussis toxin treatment of these T cells increased inositol phosphates production and led to increases in intracellular free calcium concentration. These effects were produced by the isolated B (binding) subunit of pertussis toxin, alone. Inositol phosphates production resulting from perturbation of the T cell antigen receptor-CD3 complex by MAb was not affected by pertussis toxin treatment but was markedly inhibited by cholera toxin. This effect of cholera toxin paralleled elevations in cAMP content. However, forskolin, in concentrations equipotent for cAMP production, was a weaker inhibitor of inositol phosphates production. Cholera toxin inhibition of inositol phosphates production did not result from inhibition of baseline incorporation of inositol into phosphoinositide substrates of phospholipase C. These studies underline the complexity of toxin effects on cellular systems and suggest that other approaches will be required to implicate guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins in control of the early events of T lymphocyte activation. However, the data presented here provide a molecular basis for the clinical observations of lymphocytosis and the in vitro observations of lymphocyte mitogenesis after pertussis toxin stimulation.\r"

Since systemic and local vasodilatation are hallmarks of sepsis and infection, we studied the direct effect of IL-1 on vascular contractility. We report here that human recombinant IL-1-beta potently inhibits the response of rat thoracic aorta to vasoconstrictor agents. Exposure of isolated rat aortic rings to IL-1 (20 ng/ml) for 1 h did not affect phenylephrine-induced contractions during the exposure period. However, when rings were retested 150-200 min after initiation of IL-1 exposure, contractions were markedly decreased. The cytokine had a similar effect in rings from which the endothelium was removed. Contractions caused by potassium depolarization also were depressed, indicating the effect of IL-1 is not specific to the alpha-adrenoceptor agonist. The inhibitory effect of IL-1 was concentration-dependent (0.2 to 20 ng/ml), and eliminated by pretreatment with cycloheximide (20 micrograms/ml). Indomethacin (10(-5) M) did not prevent the inhibition caused by IL-1. These studies identify IL-1 as a potent inhibitor of vascular contraction, via an endothelium-independent mechanism. Studies with inhibitors suggest that the action of IL-1 is independent of prostanoid synthesis, and may involve synthesis of protein.\r"

Twenty-two percent of caregivers reported a minimum of 15 problems occurring at least twice a week and no caregiver reported an absence of problems. Male patients were reported to have more behavioral difficulties. Level of behavioral disturbance was largely unrelated to cognitive or functional ability. Age was unrelated to cognitive or behavioral disturbance but significantly related to activities of daily living.

Possible major depression was more prevalent among newly admitted residents of both housing components. Comparison of cognitively impaired vs intact respondents revealed that the two groups' self-reports of depression were equally internally consistent, and bore equivalent correlations with observer ratings made by interviewers and direct care staff. Checks of medical records of a group of survey nonrespondents (n = 203) indicated that, excepting the extremely demented, the active sample of 708 accurately represents institution residents as a whole.

Immunol. 138:3108; J. Immunol. 139:1065). We show that the expression of CD4 and CD8 on thymocyte subpopulations with low CD3 (CD3L) and high CD3 (CD3H) is regulated by activation through the CD2 molecule and perturbation of the CD3-T cell receptor complex (CD3-Ti). Similar to its previously reported effects on peripheral T cells, PMA was able to induce the down-regulation of surface CD4, but not CD8, on thymocyte subpopulations. PMA could induce CD4 and CD8 phosphorylation in both CD3L and CD3H fractions. These results suggest that if changes in phosphorylation represent the mechanism by which CD4 and CD8 are able to transmit signals, this mechanism is operative in both CD3L and CD3H subpopulations. Treatment with anti-T11(2) and anti-T11(3) antibodies (CD2 activation pathway) resulted in partial down-regulation of CD4 but not CD8 surface expression on both CD3L and CD3H thymocytes. Similar treatment had no detectable effect on peripheral T cells. The down-regulation of surface CD4 induced by activation via CD2 could be inhibited by treatment of thymocytes with anti-CD3 antibodies. Treatment of thymocytes with anti-CD3 alone or following CD2 activation induced the selective down-regulation of surface CD8 within 15 minutes. These results suggest that CD2 and CD3-Ti triggering may regulate CD4 and CD8 surface expression on thymocytes. Furthermore, these results suggest that \"cross-talk\" between the CD2 and CD3-Ti pathway of activation may involve CD4 and CD8 molecules.\r"

  ".W": "Alkaline phosphatase (APase) has been previously described as a membrane marker correlating with B cell proliferation after stimulation by selected B cell mitogens. We have found, however, that the appearance of B cell membrane APase correlates more closely with differentiation than with proliferation. This conclusion has been drawn from the following observations: 1) APase activity appears well after peak B cell thymidine uptake, 2) mitogens which stimulate only B cell proliferation (Salmonella typhimurium mitogen) fail to induce expression of the enzyme, and 3) when proliferation of mitogen-activated B cells is inhibited, APase activity is not suppressed and may even be augmented. In addition to membrane expression, APase is also spontaneously shed into the surrounding milieu, perhaps as a result of endogenous phospholipase activity. By using a group of well-characterized inhibitors, the APase activity was shown to belong to class I (similar to the bone/liver/kidney class). Because APase always appears in differentiating but not proliferating cells, we would propose that the enzyme appearance is a late marker of B cell activation, associated with cell progression to differentiation and consequent IgM synthesis.\r"

The A-deficient mice had fewer Th by limiting dilution analysis, and retinyl acetate supplementation in vitro restored Th frequency to control levels.

  ".W": "To further define requirements for T cell help in the stimulation of an in vivo IgE response, we studied a system in which the injection of mice with a goat antibody to mouse IgD (GaMD) stimulates large polyclonal IgG1 and IgE responses. In this system, both responses are blocked by anti-CD4 antibody, but only the IgE response is blocked by (anti-IL-4) antibody. Anti-CD4 antibody, if injected 5 days after GaMD, was found to inhibit the GaMD-induced IgE response to a much greater extent than the IgG1 response, even though both responses occur simultaneously and are inhibited to an equal extent by optimal or suboptimal doses of anti-CD4 antibody administered 2 days after GaMD. Even a suboptimal, 50-micrograms dose of anti-CD4 antibody, when injected 5 days after GaMD, inhibited the IgE response to a much greater extent than did an optimal 10-mg dose of anti-IL-4 antibody injected at the same time, even though 10 mg of anti-IL-4 antibody more completely inhibited GaMD-induced IgE production than did 50 micrograms of anti-CD4 antibody when injected 2 days after GaMD. These observations provide evidence that a late acting form of T cell help other than IL-4 is important for the generation of an IgE response but not an IgG1 response in GaMD-immunized mice.\r"

  ".U": "89093920\r", 
  ".W": "We previously reported that idiotype (Id)-loss, stable somatic variants of a B cell hybrid, 2C3E1, are generated both in vitro and in vivo, after interaction of the Id-positive tumor cells with autologous Id-specific effector T cells. The present investigation was undertaken to elucidate further the nature and functional characteristics of the effector T cells. We report here that the idiotype-specific cells mediating the generation of Id- tumor variants are Thy1+ L3T4+ Lyt-2- cells, which respond to specific idiotypic stimulation by secreting IL-2 in vitro. No IL-2 is secreted in response to unrelated Ig or an Id/Ig-2C3E1 tumor variant. Furthermore, the Id-specific T cells exert strong suppressive effects on the expression of 2C3E1 Ig and the effects can be reversed by blocking the L3T4+ T cells with monoclonal anti-L3T4 antibody in vitro during the initial 3 days of co-culture. After 4 days, the T cell-mediated suppression of the 2C3E1-Id is irreversible. In addition to the in vitro studies we have determined that the administration of anti-L3T4 mAb to mice just before priming with idiotype-bearing tumor cells also abrogates the suppressive effects of the idiotype primed spleen cells on Ig expression of 2C3E1. To study the Id-specific effector T cells in more detail we have generated functional Id-specific L3T4+ T cell lines. These T cell lines have been shown to recapitulate the generation of Id- tumor variants that we observed with Id-primed spleen cells. It is concluded that L3T4+, Id-specific Ts cells are responsible for the generation of somatic variants of the B cell hybrid 2C3E1 and that the induction or selection of these variants progresses from a reversible phase to an irreversible phase.\r"

In particular, it is not clear whether thymocytes differentiate directly from pluripotent hemopoietic stem cells that seed to the thymus, or whether T lymphoid-committed stem cells (prothymocytes) arise in the bone marrow before the thymic migration. In order to resolve this question, we have used mAb specific for cell-surface Ag to identify the bone marrow cells which can seed to and repopulate the thymus of irradiated mice. We report here that the majority of thymic-repopulating cells in mouse bone marrow express low levels of the Thy-1 Ag (Thy-1lo) plus high levels of a newly described Ag termed stem cell Ag (Sca-1). Two distinct populations of thymic-repopulating Thy-1loSca-1+ cells in mouse bone marrow can be discriminated based on expression of any of a number of hemolymphoid lineage-specific (Lin) markers. Thus, Thy-1loLin-Sca-1+ and Thy-1loLin+Sca-1+ fractions of bone marrow contain thymic-repopulating cells. A second Ag, stem cell Ag-2 (Sca-2), is expressed by Thy-1loLin+Sca-1+ cells but not by Thy-1loLin-Sca-1+ cells. The Thy-1loLin-Sca-1+ fraction expresses intermediate levels of the phagocyte glycoprotein-1 Ag, and comprises 30% of the Thy-1loLin- bone marrow cells, which have previously been shown to be highly enriched in pluripotent hemopoietic stem cells. By facilitating the isolation of highly purified subpopulations of bone marrow cells that can repopulate the thymus, Sca-1 and Sca-2 should provide an experimental tool for describing the developmental potential of such bone marrow subsets.\r"

By immunoprecipitation technique we determined that the Ag recognized by autoantibody 21G10 has an apparent m.w. of 200 kDa and is present on both T and B lymphocytes but not on fibroblasts. Together with the pattern of immunoprecipitation and the cell lineage distribution we suggest that autoantibody 21G10 likely recognizes the common leukocyte Ag T200. This is further inferred by using a mutant (T200-) cell line and a reference anti-T200 mAb in immunodepletion experiments. Functionally, autoantibody 21G10 blocks (greater than 90%) the incorporation of [3H]TdR by T lymphocytes stimulated in vitro with Con A, and inhibits the production of IL-2 by these cultures. This report demonstrates the existence of autoantibodies directed against lymphocyte cell surface Ag within the natural preimmune repertoire. The implication of this finding with regard to T-B cells interaction early in ontogeny is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Cyclosporin A (CsA), a potent immunosuppressive drug, caused organ-specific autoimmune disease, such as gastritis with anti-parietal cell autoantibodies or oophoritis with anti-oocyte autoantibodies, in BALB/c mice when the drug was administered daily for 1 wk to newborns. Administration to adult mice did not. CsA abrogated the production of L3T4+ T cells and Lyt-2+ T cells in the thymus. Consequently, these T cells were substantially depleted from the peripheral lymphoid organs, especially when the drug was administered from the day of birth. Autoimmune disease was prevented when CsA-treated newborn mice were inoculated with splenic T cells from normal syngeneic mice. However, removal of the thymus immediately after neonatal CsA treatment produced autoimmune disease with a higher incidence and in a wider spectrum of organs, i.e., thyroiditis, sialoadenitis of the salivary gland, gastritis, insulitis of the endocrine pancreas, adrenalitis, oophoritis, or orchitis. Each autoimmune disease was accompanied by the development of circulating autoantibodies specific for the corresponding organ Ag. Immunopathology of these autoimmune diseases was quite similar to that of human organ-specific autoimmune diseases.\r"

  ".U": "89093929\r", 
  ".W": "Our results support the hypothesis that binding the low affinity Fc epsilon R (Fc epsilon R-II, CD23) on IgE-secreting B cells, directly suppresses IgE production. IgE production from AF-10/U266 (a human IgE plasmacytoma) decreased upon incubation with anti-IgE mAb or IgE:anti-IgE immune complexes (IgE-IC). Synthesis was suppressed a maximum of 51% with 10 micrograms/ml of IgE-IC after a 24-h incubation. Spontaneous in vitro IgE synthesis from the B cells of highly atopic individuals was also inhibited in a similar fashion. This effect was isotype specific as IgA or IgG immune complexes did not alter IgE production from AF-10 nor did IgE-IC affect IgA or IgG synthesis from lymphoblastoid cell lines making IgG (GM1500 and RPMI 8866) or IgA (GM1056). U266/AF-10 cells displayed both membrane IgE (greater than 90%) and Fc epsilon R-II (23%). To evaluate the role of these membrane proteins in the observed suppression of IgE synthesis, we treated U266/AF-10 cells with IgE-IC that bound Fc epsilon R-II but could not bind membrane IgE, as the mAb used was directed against an idiotypic determinant on the myeloma IgE (PS) used to make the IgE-IC. Suppression was maximal (greater than 50%) with these complexes at 0.1 micrograms/ml and at a 1/1 ratio of mAb anti-IgE to human myeloma IgE. When IgE-IC were used that were constructed with heat denatured IgE or F(ab')2 fragments of IgE, suppression was abrogated indicating IgE-Fc epsilon R binding was required. Neither PS IgE nor mAb 5.1 (the components of IgE-IC) alone affected IgE synthesis. Furthermore, a mAb binding directly to CD23 suppressed IgE synthesis from AF-10 up to 60%. Using limiting dilution analysis, we determined that IgE production per AF-10 cell was constant (0.9 pg/cell/24 h), independent of cell density and cells incubated with IgE-IC were uniformly suppressed. To clarify the mechanism of IgE-IC-induced suppression on AF-10 cells, we assessed both the proliferative rate and cell cycle distribution upon incubation with IgE-IC. There was no correlation between IgE production and [3H]TdR incorporation by AF-10 cells incubated with IgE-IC or anti-CD23 mAb. The distribution of cells within the cell cycle was unaffected by these treatments, with 60% of the cells in G1. These results define a direct role for the Fc epsilon R-II on B cells in the regulation of ongoing IgE synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "IL-2-binding sites expressed on purified circulating NK cells and high density T lymphocytes were enumerated in 125I-IL-2 binding assays and analyzed by autoradiography after chemical cross-linking of IL-2 to the cells. Quite similar profiles of IL-2R were exhibited by both types of cells consisting of the simultaneous expression of approximately 150 high affinity Tac+ receptors/cell (Kd congruent to 19 pM) and of approximately 540 intermediate affinity Tac- receptors/cell (Kd congruent to 800 pM) which appeared, in cross-linking experiments, to be the isolated 70-kDA protein (p70) subunit of the 55-kDa protein (p55)/p70 heterodimer. The high affinity receptors were distributed on less than 3% of the cells and could be eliminated by complement lysis with anti-p55 mAb. In these conditions, Scatchard analysis no longer revealed two classes of binding sites but only one class of binding sites with intermediate affinity. Although expressed in equal numbers on the surface of NK cells and resting T lymphocytes, the constitutive p70 chains seemed to transmit differently the proliferation signal after effective ligand interaction. Thus, NK cells proliferated strongly in the presence of only 260 pM IL-2, (40 U/ml), whereas resting T cells remained unresponsive to IL-2 concentrations able to saturate the existing p70 receptors (6.5 nM IL-2, 1000 U/ml IL-2) unless monocytes were present. The initiation of cell division seemed to involve the synthesis of p55 chains and the constitution of high affinity receptors as introducing anti-Tac antibody at the start of the cultures inhibited IL-2-induced proliferation. Tac mRNA transcripts accumulated rapidly in NK cells during a 18-h observation period whether anti-Tac antibody was present or not during IL-2 stimulation. In contrast a weak Tac mRNA induction was observed in resting T cells in the same conditions.\r"

  ".U": "89093932\r", 
  ".W": "We characterized the ability of normal human lung fibroblasts to elaborate thymocyte-stimulating activity, spontaneously, and in response to rIL-1. Supernatants from unstimulated fibroblasts did not contain thymocyte-stimulating activity, whereas supernatants from fibroblasts incubated with rIL-1 alpha or rIL-1 beta contained more thymocyte-stimulating activity than could be accounted for by passively transferred rIL-1 alone. This heightened thymocyte-stimulating activity was mediated by fibroblast-derived IL-6 inasmuch as it was neutralized by anti-serum against human rIL-6, and rIL-1-stimulated fibroblasts to accumulate messenger RNA for IL-6 and produce soluble IL-6 protein. However, IL-6 alone could not account for the intensity of this effect because rIL-6 only weakly stimulated thymocyte proliferation. In addition, antisera against the rIL-1 moiety that was used to prepare the supernatant had different effects on supernatants that contained and did not contain active IL-6. In the presence of IL-6 these antisera caused a greater decrease in thymocyte-stimulating activity than could be accounted for by passively transferred rIL-1 alone. When the IL-6 was neutralized the remaining thymocyte-stimulating activity could be quantitatively accounted for and neutralized by antisera against the rIL-1 that was passively transferred. Furthermore, rIL-6 and rIL-1 (alpha or beta) synergized in stimulating thymocyte proliferation. Thus, rIL-1 stimulates fibroblasts to produce a thymocyte-stimulating activity that is largely mediated by a synergistic interaction of fibroblast-derived IL-6 and IL-1. These findings suggest that fibroblast production of IL-6 may mediate or amplify some of the tissue effects of IL-1. In addition they suggest that biologic effects previously attributed to IL-1 may be due to IL-6 alone or the concerted action of IL-1 and IL-6.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have demonstrated that paraformaldehyde-treated macrophages possess IL-1 alpha activity in a variety of bioassay systems. However, no definitive biochemical data in support of the membrane IL-1 alpha concept has been reported. The purpose of the present study was to determine if the biologic activity associated with treated cells is due to a membrane form of IL-1 alpha or alternatively, to the leakage of IL-1 alpha. If the former case was true, then the exposed membrane IL-1 alpha should bind anti-IL-1 alpha antibodies or be cleaved by mild trypsin treatment. In both instances, IL-1 alpha activity should be lost when measured in a subsequent IL-1 bioassay. Our results indicate that pulsing paraformaldehyde-treated normal or cell line macrophages with anti-IL-1 alpha antibodies or treating the cells with trypsin did not affect the ability of the treated cells to function in a murine thymocyte proliferation assay. Furthermore, the standard short term treatment of cells with paraformaldehyde (15 min) did not prevent the leakage of IL-1 alpha from the cells or the processing of the precursor forms of the protein. When cells were treated with paraformaldehyde for 2 h, they no longer released IL-1 alpha or possessed thymocyte stimulatory activity. We also found that short term glutaraldehyde treatment of macrophages completely blocked the release of IL-1 alpha from cells as well as the appearance of cell-associated IL-1 alpha activity. Our results support the conclusion that the stimulatory activity of paraformaldehyde-treated macrophages is not due to a membrane form of IL-1 alpha but is, in fact, due to the continuous release of IL-1 alpha from the cells.\r"

Increased BSF-2 mRNA levels and increased BSF-2 secretion were observed soon after exposure of mononuclear cells isolated from healthy donors to both \"live\" and inactivated HIV. HIV-induced BSF-2 production was seen in monocyte/macrophages, but not in T cells. These results suggest that the HIV-induced overproduction of BSF-2 might contribute to the polyclonal B cell activation seen in AIDS and in infection with HIV.\r"

  ".W": "Inflammatory responses are characterized by the infiltration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) at the involved site. IL-1 may have an important role in mediating this response, but whether IL-1 acts directly on PMN is controversial. In this study, we examined PMN for the presence of IL-1R and determined the effect of IL-1 on PMN migration in vivo. Thioglycollate, proteose-peptone, or IL-1 elicited peritoneal exudate cells were found to bind 125I-IL-1 alpha in a specific and saturable manner. This binding was localized to the PMN in the exudate. Scatchard plot analysis indicates the presence of approximately 1700 receptors per PMN and an apparent dissociation constant of 3.0 x 10(-10) M. Binding sites for 125I-IL-1 alpha were also found on human PMN prepared from peripheral blood. There are approximately 900 receptors per cell on human PMN with a dissociation constant similar to that observed for elicited murine PMN. Binding of 125I-IL-1 alpha to the mouse and human PMN is inhibited by both recombinant human IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta, indicating that both IL-1 proteins bind to the same receptor on these cells. Human PMN were able to internalize radioiodinated IL-1. We conclude that PMN possess receptors for IL-1 and that these binding sites may be important in mediating IL-1 effects on granulocytes that are involved in the inflammatory response.\r"

  ".W": "Leukocytes and vascular cells interact closely in inflammation and immunity and lymphokines are important mediators of this interaction. The present study was designed to define the possible role of IL-6 as a communication signal between vascular and immunocompetent cells. IL-6 was measured as hybridoma growth factor (HGF) on the 7TD1 cell line in the supernatants of human endothelial cells (HEC). HEC released appreciable levels of HGF activity in the absence of deliberate stimulation. In vitro exposure to recombinant IL-1 beta markedly increased (usually 10 to 15-fold) HGF production by HEC. Optimal stimulation was observed with 0.1 to 50 U/ml for 4 to 20 h of incubation. Human and murine rIL-1 alpha stimulated HGF production in HEC. Anti-IL-6 antibodies inhibited the HGF activity of the HEC supernatants, thus confirming, together with the cytokine specificity of the assay, the nature of HEC-produced cytokine. IL-1-treated HEC expressed high levels of IL-6 mRNA as detected by Northern blot analysis. Inasmuch as IL-1 elicits a complex series of changes in HEC, it was important to assess whether IL-6, produced after exposure to IL-1, modified HEC function. Natural or rIL-6 did not affect the functional status of HEC as assessed by proliferative capacity, production of procoagulant activity and prostacyclin, ability to induce adhesion of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The capacity to produce IL-6 may represent an important mechanism by which endothelial cells participate in inflammatory and immune reactions.\r"

Antibodies to this Ag have been shown to act as a potent co-mitogen for B cells. In order to elucidate the function of this Ag, we have now investigated some of its biochemical characteristics as well as the relationship of B cell derived CDw40 to that derived from urinary bladder carcinoma (transitional cell carcinoma, TCC) cells. CDw40 from normal B cells or from the Burkitt lymphoma line Raji showed a characteristic pattern of three bands when analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting: a main band of 47 kDa, a degradation product of 43 kDa, and a dimer of 85 kDa. The dimer was disrupted by reduction with 2-ME but was reformed spontaneously from the purified monomers under nonreducing conditions. CDw40 from two bladder cancer cell lines gave a similar pattern but formed little or no dimer. Thirty amino acids of the amino terminal end of CDw40 from Raji and 22 amino acids of that from TCC cells (HU549) were sequenced. The sequences were unusually rich in cysteines and differed only in that the cysteine in position 6 in Raji CDw40 had been replaced by glutamine in HU549. In addition there were two conservative changes in positions 15 and 19. Taken together these results show that CDw40 derived from B cells or from TCC cells are the same or closely related molecules. Comparisons of the amino acid sequence and biochemical characteristics of CDw40 with proteins having receptor functions indicated a close structural resemblance of CDw40 to the nerve growth factor-receptor.\r"

Interaction of mAb with this pan-B Ag, together with preactivating agents such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or anti-mu, deliver strong growth-promoting signals to the cells. We here demonstrate that signaling through this Ag is dependent on its aggregation on the cell surface. Thus, monovalent antibody fragments were relatively inefficient in this respect but effectively blocked stimulation by intact antibody. By using affinity purified CDw40 protein we have also demonstrated that it is antigenically distinct from other B cell-associated Ag, including the six differentiation clusters CD19 to CD24. The mAb S2C6 and G28.5, prepared by immunizing mice with human bladder carcinoma cells or tonsillar B-cells, respectively, were the only antibodies giving detectable binding. Either of these antibodies could also completely block the binding of the other, suggesting an identity or structural proximity of the epitopes recognized. The CDw40 Ag was shown to be a phosphoprotein lacking intrinsic protein kinase activity. The results provide further evidence for CDw40 being an important B cell growth factor receptor which may also have growth regulatory functions in the development of certain human carcinomas.\r"

Lysis of VZV-infected lymphoblastoid cell lines was observed by TCC from acutely infected subjects, naturally immune subjects, and recipients of the varicella vaccine. VZV glycoprotein I induced cytotoxic T cells but killing was less efficient than killing by TCC stimulated with VZV Ag. The TCC were primarily CD4+ (mean 86.6%) T lymphocytes with 15.2% of the cells coexpressing Leu-19. TCC were predominantly restricted by HLA class II as demonstrated by lack of any blocking using class I mAb and blocking of 15 to 71% by L243, a mAb to class II. Unrestricted killing as measured by killing of K562 cells occurred in all TCC but was minimally greater than that observed against uninfected autologous targets. Phenotypes of PBMC during acute infection had an initial increase in CD4+ cells and an overall decrease in the percentage of circulating Leu-11+ (CD16). No enhanced K562 killing was demonstrated in PBMC from subjects with acute infection compared to subjects without infection. CD4+ CTL may function as an important primary host response in acute varicella. Immunization with live attenuated varicella vaccine induced VZV-specific, memory CTL responses comparable to those of naturally immune subjects. The demonstration of their persistence long after primary VZV infection may indicate a role for CTL in restriction of viral replication during episodes of VZV reactivation from latency.\r"

  ".W": "Impaired cell-mediated immunity predisposes individuals to severe systemic HSV infections. A potential approach for enhancing antiviral immunity is to alter the specificity of T cells and NK cells so that they become cytotoxic against HSV. We describe here the use of heteroconjugate antibodies to augment the killing of HSV-infected cells. Two different types of heteroconjugate antibodies were used: 1) CD3-specific mAb, covalently linked to HSV-specific mAb (e.g., anti-CD3 x anti-HSV-1 glycoprotein C); 2) FcR-specific mAb linked to HSV-specific mAb (e.g., anti-Fc gamma RIII x anti-HSV-1 glycoprotein D). Whereas freshly isolated, PBL were not cytotoxic against HSV-infected target cells in a 5-h 51Cr-release assay, co-incubation with either heteroconjugate resulted in significant cytotoxicity. In vitro activated PBL (anti-CD3 + IL-2) also became more potent killers of HSV-infected cells in the presence of each heteroconjugate. The specificity of anti-CD3 x anti-HSV-1 and anti-Fc gamma RIII x anti-HSV-1 gD for enhancing T cell and NK cell immunity, respectively, was confirmed by using cloned, homogeneous human T cell and NK cell lines as effectors. Kinetic analysis demonstrated that as soon as the infected cells began to express HSV glycoproteins on their surface they became susceptible to this enhanced killing. Prolonged culture of HSV-infected cells with heteroconjugate antibodies and effector cells also decreased the amount of viral replication that occurred, as measured in a plaque inhibition assay. These results suggest that heteroconjugate antibodies are potent immunotherapeutic tools that enhance anti-HSV immunity.\r"

One mRNA encoded a approximately 14-kDa protein with a hydrophobic N-terminal sequence and was abundantly expressed by the Th 2 subset of Th cells, but was not expressed by Th 1 cells. The remaining three mRNA encoded related approximately 8-kDa secreted proteins that are part of a family of small, secreted, and inducible mouse and human proteins. This family of proteins is itself distantly related to another family of growth and inflammatory factors that are associated with various lymphoid and fibroblast activation phenomena. One of the small, inducible, secreted proteins has a predicted mature N terminus identical to that of the previously described macrophage inflammatory protein.\r"

  ".W": "The state of T cell activation and proliferation controls HIV-1 replication and gene expression. Previously, we demonstrated that the administration of PHA and PMA to the human T cell line Jurkat activates the HIV-1 enhancer, which is composed of two nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B) binding sites. Here, we show that PMA alone is sufficient for this effect. In addition, activation of T cells through the surface proteins TCR/CD3 and CD28 increased gene expression directed by the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) to the same extent as PMA. Analysis of 5' deletions in the LTR revealed that the NF kappa B binding sites and sequences in the upstream U3 region are required for this response. Whereas cyclosporin A did not inhibit the effect of PMA, it reduced the effects of agonists to TCR/CD3 and CD28 on the LTR. H7, an inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC), blocked the effects of all stimuli. Thus, PMA activates the NF kappa B sites through a PKC-dependent pathway while ligands to TCR/CD3 and CD28 activate the LTR through a cyclosporin A-sensitive, PKC-dependent pathway of T cell activation. We conclude that mechanisms involved in the expression of IL-2 and the alpha-chain of the IL-2R alpha genes also play a role in the regulation of HIV-1. Physiologic stimuli can activate HIV-1 gene expression; agents that block T cell activation also inhibit activation of the LTR. These observations might serve as a model for the regulation of HIV-1 gene expression in peripheral blood T cells.\r"

The effectiveness of the mAb treatment in mice bearing sarcomas, leukemias, or melanomas was dependent on the host and not the tumor Ly-6 phenotype. The treatment was effective in nu/nu mice, although a more pronounced inhibition of tumor growth occurred in immunocompetent mice. The effectiveness of the therapy in immunocompetent mice was dependent on the dose of mAb and was influenced by the immunogenicity of the tumor. It ranged from significant growth inhibition of weakly immunogenic tumors to complete rejection of strongly immunogenic tumors. The results of cell-mediated cytotoxic assays of splenocytes from mAb-treated mice indicated that Ly-6 mAb treatment induced and/or augmented tumor-specific CTL as well as NK cell activity in these mice. Ly-6 mAb treatment represents a novel method for tumor immunotherapy using mAb recognizing lymphoid differentiation Ag with functional activities.\r"

  ".U": "89093965\r", 
  ".W": "The in vitro incubation of B6 splenocytes with purified, mouse rIL-4 for 4 to 5 days was sufficient to generate lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) activity. In addition, rIL-4 augmented LAK cytotoxic activity when combined with rIL-2, as measured in a 4 h 51Cr-release assay against fresh, syngeneic MCA-sarcoma (MCA-102 and MCA-105) cells. Interestingly, this augmentation was not observed against the cultured YAC-1 target. LAK generation and augmentation of cytotoxicity by rIL-4 was species-specific, because human rIL-4 (up to 20,000 U/ml) failed to elicit these effects in the mouse splenocyte cultures. When 5-day B6 LAK cells (splenocytes incubated in rIL-2 at 1000 U/ml for 5 days) were split and recultured in the combination of rIL-2 plus rIL-4 for 4 additional days at least a twofold greater expansion in cell number resulted compared to similar cells cultured in either rIL-2 or rIL-4 alone. Moreover, LAK cells expanded in rIL-2 plus rIL-4 exhibited substantial increases in in vitro cytolytic activity (on a per cell basis) against MCA-102 and MCA-105 sarcoma cells, but not against YAC-1 targets. FACS analysis or negative selection using Lyt-2 or NK-1.1 mAb plus C revealed no differences in effector phenotype(s) of LAK cells expanded in rIL-2 alone compared to rIL-2 plus rIL-4 to account for the differences observed in both expansion and cytolytic activity by rIL-4. The majority of cells was Thy-1+, Lyt-2+, T3+, and ASGM-1+. However, a marked increase in the granule-associated serine esterase, BLT-E, was found only in LAK cells expanded in the combination of both lymphokines. Collectively, these studies show that rIL-4 has potent regulatory activities on splenic LAK generation, expansion, and cytotoxic function in the mouse.\r"

Sixteen patients with nine squamous cell carcinoma, five large cell carcinoma, one small cell carcinoma, and one adenocarcinoma were studied using positron emission tomography (PET). All patients had high accumulation of [11C]methionine in lung tumors. We evaluated [11C]methionine uptake into the tumor by a semiquantitative value, DUR (Differential Uptake Ratio). There was significant difference (p less than 0.01, Mann-Whitney test) of [11C]methionine uptake between large cell carcinoma (3.98 +/- 0.27) and squamous cell carcinoma (2.92 +/- 0.30). The result suggested that there was correlation between [11C]methionine accumulation and the histologic type of lung cancer.

Also brain images, as well as organ biodistribution were determined in a monkey following the administration of 123I-labeled compound. The S-(-)-I[125I]IBZM showed high specific dopamine D-2 receptor binding in rat striatum (Kd = 0.426 +/- 0.082 nM, Bmax = 480 +/- 22 fmol/mg of protein). Competition of various ligands for the IBZM binding displayed the following rank order of potency: spiperone greater than S(-)IBZM much greater than R(+)IBZM greater than or equal to S(-)BZM greater than dopamine greater than ketanserin greater than SCH-23390 much greater than propranolol, norepinephrine, serotonin. In vivo planar images of a monkey injected with [123I]IBZM demonstrated a high concentration in basal ganglia of brain. The ratios of activity in the basal ganglia to cerebellum and the cortex to cerebellum in monkey brain were 4.93 and 1.44, respectively, at 120 min postinjection. These preliminary results indicate that [123I]IBZM is a potentially promising imaging agent for the investigation of dopamine D-2 receptors in humans.\r"

CMRglc for the second state was sensitive to errors in (a) the values of the rate constants, (b) alignment of PET slices between the two scans, and (c) subtraction of one PET image from another. The root mean square of the average error from each error source was 6.4%, which gives the theoretical reliability of this method. The measured reproducibility, taken from our previous publication, was 4.2-6.2%, which is in good agreement with the present result. This method contributes a small additional error above that expected for two independent scans. However, independent scans done on different days are likely to be subject to larger physiological variations in CMRglc than would occur using this method.\r"

However, treatment with radiolabeled antibodies results in toxic effects to normal tissues, as monitored by losses in body weight and in peripheral wbcs. We have investigated the use of an anti-antibody, or second antibody (SA), as a means of reducing this toxicity. SA rapidly forms a complex with circulating radiolabeled antibody, causing an increase in the clearance rate of the radiolabeled antibody from the blood. Toxicity was significantly reduced in animals given the SA in comparison to the toxicity seen in animals given only the radiolabeled primary antibody (PA). The earlier the SA was administered, the lower was the toxicity. The therapeutic efficacy of radiolabeled antibody was not influenced by the administration of the SA given 48 hours after the PA. Thus, the controlled removal of circulating radiolabeled antibody by an anti-antibody can reduce the toxicity associated with radiolabeled antibody therapy without influencing the antitumor effect.\r"

We have continued to apply simultaneous carotid endarterectomy/coronary artery bypass grafting (CEA/CABG) in selected patients, and in order to place operative risk in perspective, our experience with CEA/CABG was reviewed and contrasted with both CEA and CABG performed as isolated procedures. Seventy-one CEA/CABG were performed from 1978 to 1987, with the bulk of the experience (51/71) accumulated over the past 5 years. CEA/CABG was applied when the carotid lesion was severe (greater than or equal to 75% diameter stenosis). Clinical characteristics of patients with CEA/CABG (e.g., presence of unstable angina, left main coronary artery disease, and impairment of ventricular function) suggested these patients were at higher risk for complications when compared to patients with CABG alone. Yet, other factors influencing stroke risk during cardiopulmonary bypass (patient age, duration of CPB time) were similar between patients with CEA/CABG and patients with only CABG. Most complications in patients with CEA/CABG occurred in the early years of the study. Considering the recent (1983-87) patient cohorts of CEA/CABG and isolated CABG, respectively, there was no significant difference in either operative mortality (2.0% as compared to 2.2%) or perioperative stroke (2.0% as compared to 0.6%). Whereas precise patient selection criteria remain undefined, these findings verify the safety of the combined CEA/CABG approach for most patients who require treatment of both lesions.\r"

Early bypass grafting has been performed in 70 patients with an ischemic interval of less than 4 hours before reperfusion by thrombolysis. Surgery was undertaken an average of 4.5 days after the streptokinase administration. The hospital mortality rate was 1.4%. At 8 years the actuarial survival rate was 88% and the complication-free survival rate, 84%. At the latest follow-up study, 90% of the patients were in functional class I or II. Because of advanced age, 37% of the survivors have retired and 29% are working. Thirty-four percent did not return to work after the operation. In 24 patients a transmural needle biopsy specimen was taken at operation to study the extent of ischemic damage. Surprisingly, the extent of necrosis did not correlate with the ischemic interval (r = 0.17), whereas enzyme activity and extent of necrosis did correlate (r = 0.76). Late angiography was done in 44 patients (56%). The correlation between ischemic interval and regional wall motion score was weak when the whole group was considered (r = 0.35), but 70% of the patients with an ischemic interval of less than 3 hours had normal or near normal regional wall motion. In patients with prolonged ischemia, distribution between normal function and severe damage was uniform. In patients with ultrastructural and wall motion studies, early necrosis and late left ventricular function correlated fairly well (r = 0.69). We conclude that additional early bypass grafting after successful thrombolysis yields excellent long-term clinical results, especially in patients with an ischemic interval of less than 3 hours.\r"

  ".W": "The coexistence of hypothermia and hemodilution in patients in the intensive care unit immediately postoperatively after coronary artery bypass graft operations presents concerns regarding the adequacy of hemodynamics and oxygen metabolism. We evaluated the hemodynamic status and oxygen metabolism during the postoperative recovery period in six patients with moderate hemodilution (hematocrit value 34% +/- 3%) and in eight patients with marked hemodilution (hematocrit value 23% +/- 2%). All patients were well sedated and paralyzed with pancuronium bromide during the study period, during which their body temperature was slowly returning toward normal. In both groups, cardiac index at 34 degrees C was about 40% lower than at 37 degrees C. This was associated with 50% higher systemic vascular resistance and 30% lower oxygen availability to tissue. Oxygen consumption, however, was proportionally lower (45%) and coronary perfusion pressure was higher (28%) at 34 degrees C than at 37 degrees C; thus neither mixed venous nor coronary sinus blood oxygen saturation was compromised under hypothermic conditions. Although the trends in hemodynamic changes were similar in both groups, cardiac indices in patients with marked hemodilution were higher than cardiac indices in those with moderate hemodilution at all temperatures. This observation indicates that the hemodilution-induced rise in cardiac index remains intact even under hypothermic conditions. Under the conditions we studied, hypothermia with or without hemodilution had no significant adverse effects on hemodynamics and oxygen metabolisms of the whole body or of the heart.\r"

  ".U": "89095797\r", 
  ".W": "Patients currently undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting will likely have worse early and late results because of the selection of patients with fewer risk factors for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Therefore, until the results of randomized prospective studies are available, angioplasty should also be compared to bypass grafting before the era of angioplasty to facilitate current comparison with bypass grafting. To obtain these data, I analyzed 500 consecutive patients (aged 33 to 79 years [58 +/- 10 SD], 20% [100/500] female, and 60% [300/500] with three vessel disease) undergoing first-time coronary bypass without associated procedures between late 1976 and mid-1980. Intermittent aortic cross-clamping (for each distal graft) was used for revascularization of all arteries 1.0 mm in internal diameter or larger with stenoses of 50% or greater. This strategy resulted in complete revascularization in 99.8% of patients, averaging 3.2 +/- 1.2 distal grafts per patient. The hospital mortality rate was 0.2% (1/500). The incidence of low output syndrome necessitating pressors (0.8%) or intraaortic balloon pump support (0.2%) was 1% (5/500). Perioperative myocardial infarction rate based on new Q waves was 2.2% (11/500). All but three patients (99.4%) were contacted at 5 years or later with respect to repeat coronary bypass or angioplasty and survival. The survival rate at 5 years, including hospital deaths, was 92.7% +/- 1.2% (70% confidence limits) for cardiac deaths, 89.8% +/- 1.4% for all deaths, and 89.8% +/- 1.4% for all deaths plus three patients lost to follow-up. Approximately 40 factors were screened univariately to determine their effect on survival and survival free from repeat intervention. Multivariate analysis revealed, as in other series, that decreased left ventricular function (ejection fraction less than 50%) was the predominant determinant of decreased 5-year survival for both cardiac death and total mortality. At 5 years, the freedom from reintervention was 97.7% +/- 0.7%. Factors associated with repeat intervention were younger age (52 +/- 11 years versus 58 +/- 10, p less than 0.05) and fewer grafts (2.3 +/- 1.0 versus 3.3 +/- 1.2, p less than 0.01) because of less severe disease (three vessel disease 31% versus 60%, p less than 0.05). These results provide a benchmark for angioplasty which should attain a hospital mortality rate of under 1%, a periprocedure myocardial infarction rate under 3%, and a 5-year survival rate of approximately 90% with more than 95% of survivors free of repeat intervention in unselected patients, not cohorts with primarily single vessel disease.\r"

Of the available sample, 82.3% completed the full study. There was no evidence of intellectual or neuropsychologic impairment after operation. Most patients returned to preoperative status 3 months after bypass grafting. Further improvement may continue 12 and 24 months after operation. The personality tests revealed that anticipation of the operation resulted in signs of emotional arousal and distress, which dissipated after a successful surgical outcome. Similarly, return to work and quality of life was enhanced. The current study represents the first systematic, longer-term follow-up of the psychologic and social consequences of coronary artery bypass grafting operations. The findings of this study are discussed within a model of social reconstitution after the successful resolution of a life-threatening medical condition.\r"

Plasma concentration of neutrophil elastase-alpha 1-antitrypsin complex was higher in all groups than in controls. For all patients, plasma elastase-complex was related to worsening hypoxia and to increased bronchoalveolar lavage protein content. Elastase-complex was present in all bronchoalveolar lavage samples and was related to protein content and differential neutrophil counts. Patients at risk of or with ARDS had a spectrum of respiratory failure to which intravascular and intra-alveolar neutrophil elastase release and capillary permeability were related. This suggests that the state recognised as ARDS is not a distinct pathophysiological entity.\r"

  ".W": "We examined whether the synthesis of interleukin-1 or tumor necrosis factor, two cytokines with potent inflammatory activities, is influenced by dietary supplementation with n-3 fatty acids. Nine healthy volunteers added 18 g of fish-oil concentrate per day to their normal Western diet for six weeks. We used a radioimmunoassay to measure interleukin-1 (IL-1 beta and IL-1 alpha) and tumor necrosis factor produced in vitro by stimulated peripheral-blood mononuclear cells. With endotoxin as a stimulus, the synthesis of IL-1 beta was suppressed from 7.4 +/- 0.9 ng per milliliter at base line to 4.2 +/- 0.5 ng per milliliter after six weeks of supplementation (43 percent decrease; P = 0.048). Ten weeks after the end of n-3 supplementation, we observed a further decrease to 2.9 +/- 0.5 ng per milliliter (61 percent decrease; P = 0.005). The production of IL-1 alpha and tumor necrosis factor responded in a similar manner. Twenty weeks after the end of supplementation, the production of IL-1 beta, IL-1 alpha, and tumor necrosis factor had returned to the presupplement level. The decreased production of interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor was accompanied by a decreased ratio of arachidonic acid to eicosapentaenoic acid in the membrane phospholipids of mononuclear cells. We conclude that the synthesis of IL-1 beta, IL-1 alpha, and tumor necrosis factor can be suppressed by dietary supplementation with long-chain n-3 fatty acids. The reported antiinflammatory effect of these n-3 fatty acids may be mediated in part by their inhibitory effect on the production of interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor.\r"

  ".W": "The receptors found on most T lymphocytes bind to antigen presented on major histocompatibility complex proteins and consist of dimers of alpha- and beta-polypeptides associated with the invariant CD3 complex. A fully competent immune system requires a diverse array of T-cell antigen receptors (TCRs) with different specificities. This diversity is generated by rearrangement of TCR alpha- and beta-chain gene segments within the thymus where the receptors are first expressed. Any cells carrying self-reactive receptors must be eliminated, suppressed or inactivated so that destructive autoimmunity is avoided. Recently, compelling evidence has shown that one process involved in producing such self-tolerance is clonal deletion of autoreactive cells within the thymus by an as-yet-undefined mechanism. Here we show that engaging the CD3/TCR complex of immature mouse thymocytes with anti-CD3 antibodies produces DNA degradation and cell death through the endogenous pathway of apoptosis. Activation of this process in immature T cells by the binding of the TCR to self-antigens may therefore be the mechanism which produces clonal deletion and consequently self-tolerance.\r"

When multivalent allergens bind to the receptor-bound IgE, the consequent aggregation of the receptors leads to the release of mediators responsible for allergic symptoms. In rodents Fc epsilon RI is a tetrameric complex of non-covalently attached subunits: one IgE-binding alpha subunit, one beta subunit and a dimer of disulphide-linked gamma subunits. Complementary DNA encoding the alpha and the beta subunits has recently been isolated, but expression of IgE-binding by transfected cells has not yet been achieved. Here we report the cloning of cDNA for the gamma subunit, and propose a model for the alpha beta gamma 2 tetramer which accounts for many of the structural features of the receptor. The rodent receptor on the surface of COS 7 cells was expressed only when the cDNAs for all three subunits were cotransfected. Successful expression of human IgE receptors should now be possible, eventually to permit the detailed analysis of the human IgE-receptor interaction and assist the search for therapeutically effective inhibitors.\r"

Rhesus monkeys infected with the simian immunodeficiency virus of macaques (SIVMAC), a virus closely related to HIV-1, develop an AIDS-like syndrome, and so provide an important model for the evaluation of potential AIDS therapies. We have assessed the therapeutic effect of recombinant soluble CD4 in SIVMAC-infected rhesus monkeys. Virus was readily isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes and bone marrow cells of these animals before starting treatment with soluble CD4, but became difficult to isolate soon after treatment had begun. Moreover the diminished growth of both granulocyte-macrophage and erythrocyte progenitor colonies from the bone marrow of these monkeys rose to normal levels during treatment. These findings indicate that soluble CD4 could prove valuable in the treatment of AIDS.\r"

  ".W": "Large granular lymphocytes and cytolytic T-lymphocytes (CTL) contain numerous cytoplasmic granules thought to be responsible, at least in part, for the cytolytic activity of these effector cells. Isolated granules are lytic for a variety of target cells and the granule proteins are specifically released upon target-cell interaction. Major proteins in mouse CTL granules are a family of seven serine proteases designated granzymes A to G, and a pore-forming protein called perforin (cytolysin). Purified perforin is cytolytic in the presence of Ca2+ and shows ultrastructural, immunological and amino-acid sequence similarities to complement component C9. Despite these similarities, perforin and C9 are clearly distinct in their mode of target-cell recognition. Whereas C9 insertion is absolutely dependent on a receptor moiety assembled from the complement proteins C5b, C6, C7, and C8 on the target-cell membrane, no requirement for a receptor molecule has been reported for perforin. Here, we demonstrate that phosphorylcholine acts as a specific, Ca2+-dependent receptor molecule for perforin.\r"

  ".W": "The CD4 antigen has been subverted as a receptor by the human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV). Several groups have reported that recombinant, soluble forms of the CD4 molecule (sCD4) block the infection of T lymphocytes by HIV-1, as CD4 binds the HIV envelope glycoprotein, gp120, with high affinity. We now report that sCD4 blocks diverse strains of HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV, but is less effective for HIV-2. The blocking effect is apparent even after adsorption of virions to CD4 cells. Soluble CD4 prevents HIV infection of T-lymphocytic and myelomonocytic cell lines, but neither sCD4 nor anti-CD4 antibodies inhibit infection of glioma and rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines.\r"

We describe the use of fibrin glue in controlling life-threatening hemorrhage in three gynecology patients. Simultaneous injection of equal amounts of cryoprecipitate and bovine thrombin at bleeding sites results in formation of the glue, which effectively controls the bleeding. When used in conjunction with good surgical technique, fibrin glue may decrease the need for blood transfusions and may shorten operating room time.\r"

Subjects were randomly assigned to either a treatment condition, consisting of the application via surface electrodes of a 30-Hz current to the points \"spleen 6\" (lower leg) and \"liver 3\" (foot), or a placebo condition, in which the equipment was attached but not activated. The frequency and strength of uterine contractions were monitored for 1 hour prior to stimulation and then for the final 2 hours of a 4-hour test period. A significant increase in frequency and strength of uterine contractions was found in the electrically stimulated women compared with the placebo-group women. The possible physiologic mechanisms underlying this effect, and its implication for labor induction, are discussed.\r"

Localization of the bleeding site is the next step. In occult and minor overt bleeding, the cause can usually be determined from results of conventional diagnostic tests; however, angiography and even intraoperative endoscopy may be necessary in some particularly difficult cases. In contrast, major overt bleeding may only allow time for angiographic localization before surgery. Using this approach, the primary care physician can successfully manage most patients with lower gastrointestinal bleeding.\r"
