However, thorough understanding and skill in application of rhinoplasty technique are necessary to acquire these better results. The stigma of the columellar incision is slowly being put to rest, as surgeons, employing the technique relate their satisfaction and their patients' lack of dissatisfaction with the scar. Increasingly, surgeons are utilizing this technique, thereby learning more about rhinoplasty and enhancing the teaching and performance of this art. Acceptance is increasing, even to the point of popularity. Open rhinoplasty has survived its infancy and is enjoying a vigorous growth in North America.\r"

  ".U": "88095941\r", 
  ".W": "This article has overviewed complications of rhinoplasty. Generally, these complications fall into two categories: aesthetic (that is, cosmetic sequelae that may require a revision rhinoplasty) and nonaesthetic. Of the nonaesthetic complications, infection has the widest span of severity. A localized Staphylococcus aureus abscess or Pseudomonas infection of the nose may occur postoperatively. Owing to the proximity of the nose to the cranium, a cavernous sinus thrombosis or basilar meningitis may result. Postoperative toxic-shock syndrome is a rare occurrence that surgeons should be aware of; most cases have occurred with the presence of nasal packing, but a case using only plastic nasal splints has been reported also. Bacteremia seems to be uncommon during rhinoplasty. Infection after rhinoplasty is generally much less frequent than one would expect from an operation in an unsterile field. Antibiotics are frequently utilized electively. Postoperative nasal-periorbital edema and ecchymosis are regarded as unavoidable but may be lessened significantly by postoperative head elevation and cold packs. The possibility of postoperative bleeding must be evaluated by the surgeon preoperatively. This sequela usually occurs either within 72 hours postoperatively or at around 10 days postoperatively. Many different causes exist for chronic postoperative nasal obstruction, from poorly supported nasal valves closing upon inspiration to an enhanced allergic rhinitis leading to chronic nasal mucosal edema. The latter may be treated by injection of steroid into the turbinates. Among aesthetic complications, supratip prominence, saddle deformity, and persistent hump are among the more commonly reported. Supratip prominence--\"polly-beak\"--can be caused by inadequate reduction of tip cartilaginous or soft-tissue elements, especially in relation to the reduction of the dorsum. An over-reduced dorsum will leave an otherwise normal nasal tip with a relative prominence. An accumulation of blood or a mucous cyst occurring under the skin of the tip will produce a prominence. Poor tip projection, tip ptosis, and alar collapse are the result of overreduction of tip elements. A dislocated alar cartilage can appear as an asymmetric nasal bossa. Saddle-nose deformity occurs after overaggressive bony and/or cartilaginous hump removal. Infractured nasal bones that subsequently drop into the piriform aperture can create a bony saddle. Persistent hump is due to inadequate reduction of a bony or cartilaginous hump. If the septal cartilage reduction is disproportionate to the bony septum reduction, the appearance of either a hump or a saddle is possible.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88095944\r", 
  ".W": "Two major factors are involved in choosing augmentation materials: (1) the specific properties and limitations of the materials themselves (Table 2) and (2) the characteristics of the site for implantation. A wide variety of materials are currently available and these vary in density, ability to be sculpted, tissue reaction, resorption, migration, incidence of infection, extrusion rate, and ease of removal. Some of these characteristics are self-evident. For example, materials with high infection or extrusion rates (such as Silastic in nasal reconstruction) are clearly not useful in most instances. Likewise, materials that tend to migrate, such as tiny bits of cartilage, can lead to unacceptable results, but cartilage is such a generally good augmentation material in the nose that the measures to ensure stability are worth the additional time required for implantation. Resorption is a potential problem with all the biologic grafts and possibly with Supramid. Again, in certain situations in which alloplasts are unacceptable, such as infected areas, biologicals must be used and the consequences of resorption accepted. Density and ease of sculpting are often a matter of the surgeon's personal choice. As a general rule, bone is best replaced with firm materials and soft tissues are best augmented with soft materials. Should infection or rejection occur, the porous materials are much more difficult to remove; therefore, Silastic or a biological may be the best choice if there is any question about the presence of infection or possible future infection. The effect of the degree of tissue reaction is not well-understood. For example, Supramid elicits a marked tissue response but in general displays high compatibility with the tissues. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the role of tissue reactivity and porosity in the development of infection and extrusion. When choosing the implant material, the specific characteristics of the site for augmentation must be considered. A good example is the nose. Its mobility and thin soft-tissue coverage lead to extrusion of firm implants such as Silastic. By contrast, Silastic works well for chin augmentation. Also, consider present or future bacterial contamination in the area. This is especially important in nasal augmentation, where infection and extrusion can lead to unacceptable deformities. In general, nasal augmentation is best achieved in most circumstances by cartilage. If this is unavailable, then Supramid has a proven record for good tissue compatibility and resistance to infection. For the chin, Silastic (either rubber- or gel-filled prostheses) produces the most pleasing and long-lasting results.\r"

The evidence in the literature which suggests that some of these cases might be due to a 'depressive equivalent' is examined. It is suggested that it is difficult, if not impossible, to formulate a diagnosis of depressive illness in patients who do not have clear symptoms of depression. However, there is evidence in the literature that a relatively high percentage of patients with chronic indeterminate pain appear to have a family history of depression and depressive spectrum disorders. Biological markers of depression also give some indication that certain of these patients may have a link with depressive illness as well as with pain. It is suggested that there is a need to explore the existence of a sub-group of patients with indeterminate pain in whom the mechanism of the pain may be related to the mechanism of depressive illness even though formal depressive symptoms are not found.\r"

The study was designed as a randomized and double-blind single dose but complete cross-over comparison of the combination of 10 mg intramuscular morphine and 10 mg oral cocaine with morphine alone, cocaine alone, and placebo. While patients clearly discriminated between the analgesic effects of morphine and placebo, there were no differences in the analgesic responses to cocaine and placebo, or in responses to morphine and the combination of morphine and cocaine in either patient group. Side effects were predominantly morphine-like and occurred in 59% of patients after the combination, 43% after morphine, 34% after cocaine and 25% after placebo. Interaction effects between cocaine and morphine were observed in terms of positive changes toward selected aspects of mood (e.g., cheerful, friendly) in postoperative patients but toward negative aspects of mood (e.g., sad, serious) in patients with chronic pain.\r"

Current conceptualizations of pain behaviors are examined and methods of assessing pain behaviors are evaluated. The validity and utility of the construct and its limitations are discussed.

  ".U": "88096127\r",

A substantial degree of protection should also extend to partially immunized and unimmunized preschool aged children in the community. Furthermore most of the cases of OPV-associated paralytic poliomyelitis could be prevented. Because the reasons for these beliefs are based on data from small studies and on inferences from related research, specific recommendations for a change from current polio immunization policy must depend on additional clinical research. Well-designed trials comparing several different options for sequencing both inactivated and live vaccines are needed, and these studies should focus carefully on both humoral and intestinal immunity conferred by the various vaccine schedules.\r"

The first step in selecting an antimicrobial agent for treatment of acute otitis media with effusion is to determine in vitro susceptibilities of the most frequently isolated pathogens to commonly used antibiotics. Another important variable to consider is the degree to which the prospective agent penetrates and is concentrated in middle ear fluid. Although bacteriologic eradication of causative pathogens remains an objective of therapy, the desired result of any treatment regimen for both physician and patient is a satisfactory clinical response. Knowledge of geographic bacterial resistance patterns is essential to effective antibiotic therapy and continued successful clinical outcomes. The ideal antimicrobial agent for treatment of acute otitis media with effusion is safe, well-tolerated by infants and young children, is effective against the most frequently encountered pathogens and is affordable.\r"

Fifteen United States clinical investigators participated in the multicenter clinical trial. One hundred twenty children were randomly assigned to a 10-day course of either cefixime, 8 mg/kg, given daily (qd) (60 patients) or amoxicillin, 40 mg/kg/day, administered in three divided doses (60 patients). Tympanocentesis was performed on each patient before therapy was initiated. Pathogens were isolated from a middle ear aspirate in 88% of the cases. Of the specimens from which pathogens were cultured, 33% yielded Haemophilus sp., 41% Streptococcus pneumoniae and 6% Branhamella catarrhalis. Of the 120 patients, 64 (30 cefixime and 34 amoxicillin) were evaluable for assessment of efficacy. Favorable clinical responses (cure or improvement) were obtained in 93% of cefixime-treated patients and in 94% of amoxicillin-treated patients. Overall, bacteriologic eradication rates (as determined by clinical criteria) were 94 and 95%, respectively. Clinical failure or relapse was documented in 2 of 30 (7%) patients treated with cefixime and in 2 of 34 (6%) patients treated with amoxicillin. Gastrointestinal disturbance and rash were significantly more common in children treated with cefixime (22 and 15%, respectively) than in those taking amoxicillin (8 and 2%, respectively), but in only one case was it necessary to discontinue medication because of these adverse effects (rash). Results of this study demonstrate that cefixime given once daily is as safe and effective as amoxicillin in the treatment of acute otitis media with effusion in children and has the possible advantage of less frequent dosing.\r"

During a 6-month period 799 blood cultures were obtained in a tertiary care nursery; 81 (10.1%) grew CONS and 25 (3.0%) grew other bacteria. A comparison group of 121 infants was selected randomly from ill patients whose blood cultures were negative. In addition 70 well infants were matched to CONS-positive cases. Abnormal clinical signs, complete blood cell counts, C-reactive protein, alpha-1-acid glycoprotein and prealbumin were determined at the time of culture. Signs that discriminated best between infants with and without CONS bacteremia were identified by logistic regression analysis. Infants with CONS bacteremia did not differ from infants with sepsis caused by recognized pathogens, except for lethargy, which was significantly more common in unequivocal infection. Infants with presumed infection but negative blood cultures, and noninfected control patients had abnormal signs significantly less often than CONS-positive infants. C-reactive protein, hyperthermia, increased oxygen requirements and lethargy were the most useful signs in identifying neonatal bloodstream infection. This cohort study provides objective evidence for the pathogenicity of CONS in newborn infants.\r"

Two separate groups of children were observed: (1) a group of 12 young, well-nourished, previously healthy infants, who did not generally develop focal complications and had a favorable course; (2) a group of 8 older children suffering from malnutrition and underlying diseases, such as psychomotor retardation, infected hemangiomata, hemophilia and acute hepatitis B who commonly had focal infections such as pneumonia, meningitis or arthritis/osteomyelitis and had a worse prognosis.

All 7 patients were hospitalized for observation with all but 1 begun on empiric antibiotic therapy. Laboratory parameters such as a complete blood count, sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein did not influence decisions for management. Cerebrospinal fluid antigen detection assays were negative in all but one patient with pneumococcal meningitis. Review of these cases did not reveal unique indicators for bacterial meningitis. The results emphasize that the physician must rely on clinical judgment in initiating empiric antimicrobial therapy once apparently normal cerebrospinal fluid parameters are observed.\r"

Various syringe preparation techniques have therefore been advocated to prevent reactions. To evaluate these recommendations we compared rates of minor reactions in 200 children randomly assigned to one of three groups that differed only in the handling of the filled syringe: in Group 1 the needle was changed before injection; in Group 2 the needle was wiped with sterile gauze before injection; in Group 3 the same needle was used to draw up and to inject the dose and was not wiped. Overall 27% of children had febrile (greater than 38 degrees C) reactions, 62% became fussy and 79% had a local reaction. Rates of reactions were nearly identical in the three groups, except that children in group 2 receiving their second dose or more of diphtheria-tetanus toxoid-pertussis vaccine were more likely to become febrile at greater than 38 degrees C (32%) or fussy (78%) (P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.02, respectively). We conclude that changing needles does not reduce the rate of minor local and systemic reactions. Wiping needles may increase the rate of reactions.\r"

Experiments with extensively purified transcription factor tau indicate that the tau B-B block interaction is not influenced by A-B distance; only the ability of tau A to interact with A block sequences is affected, possibly because of the additional free-energy cost of forming a large loop of the intervening DNA.\r"

It encodes a protein with a C-terminal domain related to the src family of protein-tyrosine kinases (EC 2.7.1.112) and, among these, has most significant homology to the lck gene isolated from a murine leukemia virus-induced thymoma cell line. The gene is therefore referred to as c-tkl for cellular tyrosine kinase related to lck. Analysis of genomic DNA reveals that c-tkl is a chromosomal locus distinct from c-src and c-lck. Furthermore, the size of c-tkl mRNA as well as its pattern of expression indicates that it is not the chicken homologue of lck but a different gene. A 3.8-kb transcript of the c-tkl gene, identical to the size determined for c-src mRNA, was observed in cultured chicken embryo fibroblasts and in chicken spleen and brain. In contrast, detection of a definite c-src mRNA signal with mRNA from spleen was not possible under the hybridization conditions employed when the 5' end of v-src was used as the probe, and none of the 11 clones obtained from the cDNA library corresponded to a c-src transcript. Thus previous studies of c-src mRNA expression in spleen may have actually detected c-tkl transcripts.\r"

However, three of the mutants exhibit 5-10 times less activity and several others show 2-3 times less. Simultaneous mutation of two of the most mutationally sensitive regions leads to virtual abolition of activity.

Membrane fractions from the mnn1 mnn2 and mnn1 mnn2 mnn9 mutants are equally effective in catalyzing transfer from GDP-[3H]mannose to add mannose in both alpha 1----2 and alpha 1----6 linkages to an oligosaccharide having the following structure: (Formula: see text) but neither membrane preparation can utilize the homologous mnn1 mnn2 mnn9 oligosaccharide as an acceptor. Thus, addition of the alpha 1----2-linked mannose side chain to the terminal alpha 1----6-linked mannose in oligosaccharides of the mnn9 mutant inhibits the elongation reaction and may serve as an important structural control of mannoprotein glycosylation. The mnn9 mutation also increases the transit time for invertase secretion, meaning that this mutation could affect the processing machinery in the Golgi apparatus.\r"

Activation of CKII was apparent after 5 min of exposure of 3T3-L1 cells to insulin, was maximal by 10 min, and persisted through 90 min. The insulin-stimulated activity was inhibited by low concentrations of heparin and was stimulated by spermine. Activation of CKII was effected by physiological concentrations of insulin (EC50 = 0.15 nM), suggesting that the effect is a true insulin response and not one mediated through insulin-like growth factor receptors. Epidermal growth factor (100 ng/ml for 10 min) also activated CKII in A431 human carcinoma cells, which is consistent with other observations that insulin and epidermal growth factor may have some common effects. Insulin stimulation of CKII activity was due to an increase in the maximal velocity of the kinase; the apparent Km for peptide substrate was not altered. Enhanced activity did not appear to result from increased synthesis of CKII protein, because cycloheximide did not block the effect and because an immunoblot developed with antiserum to CKII showed no effect of insulin on the cytosolic concentration of CKII. Because insulin-stimulated CKII activity was maintained after chromatography of cell extracts on Sephadex G-25, it is unlikely that the effect is mediated by a low-molecular-weight activator of the kinase. Rather, the results are consistent with the possibility that insulin activates CKII by promoting a covalent modification of the kinase.\r"

Transcription of the mini-F repE gene encoding a replication initiator protein (E protein) was examined by operon fusion and by direct determination of repE mRNA. The synthesis rate and the level of repE mRNA were found to increase transiently upon temperature upshift (30 degrees C to 42 degrees C) in wild-type cells but to decrease rapidly in the rpoH mutants. Thus sigma 32 appeared to be directly involved in transcription of repE whose product, E protein, in turn activates DNA replication from the mini-F ori2 region. This scheme of host-controlled plasmid replication is further supported by the analysis of transcription in vitro: RNA synthesis can be initiated from the repE promoter by a minor form of RNA polymerase containing sigma 32 but not by the major polymerase containing the normal sigma factor sigma 70. The sigma 32-mediated transcription from the repE promoter is strongly inhibited by the E protein. We conclude that transcription of the mini-F repE gene is mediated by the host transcription factor sigma 32 and is negatively controlled by its own product.\r"

We generated mutants of Escherichia coli formylmethionine tRNA that have a base pair at the end of the acceptor stem. The mutants generated were C1----T1, which had a U.A base pair, A72----G72, which had a C.G base pair, and the C1A72----T1G72 double mutant, which lacked the base pair. After aminoacylation, the activity of these and other mutant initiator methionyl-tRNAs (Met-tRNAs) in elongation were assayed in a MS2 RNA-directed E. coli protein-synthesizing system and in binding to the elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu). Unlike wild-type initiator tRNA or the T1G72 double mutant, the T1 and G72 mutant Met-tRNAs were active in elongation, the G72 mutant being more active than the T1 mutant. The T1 and G72 mutant Met-tRNAs also formed a ternary complex with elongation factor EF-Tu.GTP, and their relative affinities for EF-Tu.GTP paralleled their activities in elongation. Combination of the T1 or G72 mutation with mutations in the GGG.CCC sequence conserved in the anticodon stem of initiator tRNAs led to a further increase in the activities of these mutant tRNAs in elongation such that one of these mutants was now almost as good an elongator as E. coli elongator methionine tRNA.\r"

This sequence includes six cysteines involved in three intramolecular disulfide bridges. To determine the importance of disulfide bridges to the biological activity of ST1b, we synthesized 15 analogues of the tridecapeptide representing all possible replacements of two of the six cysteines by alanines. Only 2 analogues--namely, A6,11ST1b-(6-18) and A10,18ST1b(6-18)--could inhibit the binding of a radiolabeled analogue of ST1b to rat intestinal cells. The purified peptides were, respectively, 4200 and 130 times less effective as inhibitors than ST1b(6-18), the sequence that includes all six cysteines. In addition, both peptides produce diarrhea when given orally to suckling mice. These analogues share in common only two cysteines (Cys-7 and Cys-15), suggesting that four cysteines, two of which are Cys-7 and Cys-15, are necessary for activity. A pattern of disulfide linkages is proposed where Cys-7 is paired to Cys-15, Cys-6 to Cys-11, and Cys-10 to Cys-18, the preceding disulfide bridges being ranked in descending order of importance in terms of their respective contribution to the activity of the enterotoxin. Using this disulfide bridge arrangement and constraints derived from NMR spectroscopy, we propose a folding pattern for the toxic domain of ST1b.\r"

The introduction into oxyR deletion strains of multicopy plasmids carrying the oxyR-regulated genes for catalase (katG) or alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (ahp) results in overexpression of the respective enzyme activities and decreases the number of spontaneous mutants to wild-type levels. The introduction into oxyR deletions of a plasmid carrying the gene for superoxide dismutase (sodA) decreases the mutation frequency by a factor of 5 in some strain backgrounds. Strains that contain a dominant oxyR mutation and overexpress proteins regulated by oxyR show lower spontaneous-mutation frequencies by a factor of 2. These results indicate that oxyR and oxyR-regulated genes play a significant role in defense against spontaneous oxidative DNA damage. The role of oxidative damage to DNA in \"spontaneous\" mutagenesis is discussed.\r"

We now show that the RAD3 protein also possesses a helicase activity that unwinds duplex regions in DNA substrates constructed by annealing DNA fragments of 71-851 nucleotides to circular, single-stranded M13 DNA. The DNA helicase activity is dependent on the hydrolysis of ATP, has a pH optimum of approximately 5.6, and is inhibited by antibodies raised against a truncated RAD3 protein produced in Escherichia coli. The RAD3 helicase translocates along single-stranded DNA in the 5'----3' direction. The direction of RAD3 helicase movement is consistent with the possibility that it unwinds DNA duplexes in advance of the replication fork during DNA replication.\r"

Gene synthesis provides several advantages over traditional eukaryotic gene-cloning techniques, allowing the incorporation of an efficient ribosome binding site, appropriate initiation and termination sequences, restriction enzyme sites for convenient subcloning and future mutagenesis, and frequently used codons for highly expressed E. coli genes. The sperm whale myoglobin expressed from the synthetic gene constituted approximately 10% of the total soluble protein as holo-protein, indicating that iron-protoporphyrin IX biosynthesis and prosthetic-group incorporation are not limiting in the high-level expression of this heme protein in E. coli. We credit the use of frequently used E. coli codons for the observed high-level expression. The sperm whale myoglobin produced is stable, easily purified to homogeneity, and indistinguishable from commercially available sperm whale myoglobin by optical and magnetic spectroscopic methods.\r"

Enzyme activity measurement and immunoblots of buckwheat hypocotyl homogenates that were fractionated on linear sucrose density gradients and developed with a specific chalcone synthase antibody and a 20-nm ImmunoGold conjugate showed the presence of chalcone synthase in fractions enriched in endoplasmic reticulum membranes. The presence of chalcone synthase on these membranes was not caused by nonspecific adsorption or entrapment of proteins. Immunocytochemical investigations with both a 5-nm and a 20-nm ImmunoGold conjugate showed that chalcone synthase was associated with the cytoplasmic face of rough (ribosome bearing) endoplasmic reticulum membranes. Plasma membrane, nucleus, plastids, mitochondria, golgi, and the tonoplast were not labeled. These data are consistent with our earlier described model suggesting that the synthesis of phenylpropanoids and flavonoids takes place partially or fully on membrane-associated enzyme complexes.\r"

These plasmids were then isolated from the cells by a rapid lysis procedure and examined for their degrees of supercoiling. Functional complementation of a conditional-lethal mutation in topA, which encodes E. coli DNA topoisomerase I, correlates with the expression of a catalytically active yeast enzyme that reduces the degree of negative supercoiling of intracellular DNA. We also show that approximately 130 amino acids of the amino-terminal portion of the yeast enzyme can be deleted without affecting its activity in vitro; activity of the enzyme inside E. coli, however, is more sensitive to such deletions.\r"

In this study the response of S. mansoni cercariae to change in temperature from ambient to that of mammalian hosts was compared to the response of other stages that do not experience such dramatic temperature shifts. In cercariae, temperature increases from 23 degrees C to either 37 degrees C or 42 degrees C primarily induced the synthesis of two proteins unique to this stage, of Mr 60,000 and 58,000. Neither protein could be induced by similar treatment in the other two stages of the parasite found in mammalian hosts. Instead, these stages predominantly synthesized a Mr 70,000 protein that crossreacted with monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against the Mr 70,000 heat shock protein of Drosophila and chicken. No crossreactive material was detected in cercariae, suggesting that a protein homologous to the highly conserved heat shock protein of Mr 70,000 is absent or induced to very low levels by temperature increase at this stage. The induction of the Mr 60,000 and 58,000 proteins was confined to the initial 3-hr period during cercarial transformation to the schistosomula stage.\r"

Cells were microinjected with hapten-labeled tubulin and then processed for triple-label immunofluorescence to determine the pattern of incorporation of the injected subunits into [Tyr]- and [Glu]-MTs. Within 2 min of microinjection, hapten-labeled domains were present at the ends of virtually all [Tyr]MTs but were absent from most [Glu]MTs, demonstrating that [Tyr]MTs grew, whereas most [Glu]MTs did not. After 1 hr of incubation, all [Tyr]MTs analyzed were copolymers of endogenous and hapten-labeled subunits, indicating complete and rapid turnover of these MTs. However, the majority of [Glu]MTs were not hapten-labeled, indicating that they had not turned over. Even 16 hr after injection, cells that had not divided retained a small proportion of [Glu]MTs lacking hapten, implying that some had persisted for most of a cell generation. At mitosis, all MTs were hapten-labeled, indicating that the stable interphase [Glu]MTs had depolymerized. The results establish that the MT network is heterogeneous in its turnover rate, being composed of at least two populations: [Tyr]MTs that turn over rapidly and [Glu]MTs that turn over slowly.\r"

The distribution of high molecular weight caldesmon (h-caldesmon, Mr 120,000-150,000) was restricted to smooth muscles where it was found in large quantity. The low molecular weight protein (l-caldesmon, Mr 70,000-80,000) was widely distributed in nonmuscle tissues and cells. Therefore, the expression of h-caldesmon might be much more specific to smooth muscles. We then examined the expressional changes of two caldesmons during phenotypic modulation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs). In developing gizzards, the expression of caldesmons switched from the l- to the h-form. Contrarily, the expression turned from h- to l-caldesmon in association with dedifferentiation of aortic SMCs in primary culture. In agreement with these observations, the levels of those mRNAs that direct the synthesis of both caldesmons were apparently in proportion to the quantities of protein, as determined by use of an in vitro translation system. In addition, h-caldesmon in smooth muscle-like BC3H1 cells increased in its amount with a concomitant reduction of l-caldesmon following serum-depleted and contact-inhibited cytodifferentiation. These results suggest that the expressional changes of two caldesmons are closely correlated with the phenotypic modulation of SMCs.\r"

Extensive prior data from chromosome studies of tumorigenic and tumor-derived Chinese hamster cells have suggested the presence of a tumor-suppressor gene on 3p. Two tumor-suppressor genes have been described on human 11p, one linked to CAT and one to INS. The present study raises the possibility that the Chinese hamster suppressor may be closely linked to INS or CAT.\r"

  ".W": "We show that HEM1 (encoding 5-aminolevulinate synthase) expression, while constitutive under all steady-state growth conditions tested, is activated by the HAP2-HAP3 global activation system that controls expression of apocytochromes. This finding creates a paradox because apocytochrome activation by HAP2-HAP3 is highly regulated, subject to induction by heme, and subject to further derepression by a shift from glucose medium to one containing a nonfermentable carbon source. We clarify this issue by showing that HEM1 is subject to two additional layers of control that mask regulatory changes. First is a second activation system acting at a site close to the HAP2-HAP3 target sequence that keeps HEM1 turned on under conditions of heme deficiency. Second is a regulated negative control site downstream of the upstream activation site that counteracts derepression in medium containing a nonfermentable carbon source. Thus, transcription of the constitutive gene is actually a composite of opposing regulatory sites. This complex regulatory arrangement may exist to allow HEM1 to be coordinated transiently with apocytochromes for transition to respiratory growth. Conversely, it may reflect the alteration of HEM1 from a regulated to a constitutive gene over evolution.\r"

Our results indicate that the specific base pairs at 18 of the 19 positions are important in transposition. A 9-base-pair segment in the O end corresponds to a binding site for the Escherichia coli DnaA protein. Comparisons of effects of mutations at different positions in this site, and also measurements of Tn5 transposition in dnaA- cells, indicate that DnaA protein participates in O-end-mediated transposition.\r"

Cultured and freshly isolated murine mast cells are shown to be cytotoxic to WEHI-164 and YAC-1 targets in 18-hr viability assays but not in 4-hr assays. Here, we describe a cytotoxic factor in murine mast cells that is immunologically related to tumor necrosis factor (TNF). This TNF-like factor lyses WEHI-164 cells with a slow time course requiring 16-20 hr for the lytic reaction to complete. Antibodies specific for human and murine TNF and human lymphotoxin partially block mast cell lysis of WEHI-164 cells. These antibodies react on immunoblots with one major mast cell protein band of 50 kDa. Immunoblot analysis shows this factor in cloned and uncloned cultured mouse mast cells and in mature \"connective tissue-type\" mast cells freshly purified from rat or mouse peritoneal cavities. The amount of this factor is greatly enhanced in cells that have been stimulated with a combination of phorbol ester/concanavalin A or bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Subcellular fractionation analysis of mast cells with Percoll gradients reveals two pools of TNF-related cytotoxic activity that are associated with free cytosolic material and granule fractions. In contrast to cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells, granule-enriched fractions of mast cells do not contain any hemolytic activity. The localization of the TNF-like molecule in mast cell granules may play a strategical role in the rapid delivery of this mediator to the target cell membrane following cell surface stimulation and degranulation.\r"

The results indicate that in a subgroup of patients this is indeed the case. The antibodies reported in this study have the following properties: (i) they recognize neuronal populations and components in the medial septum and spinal motor neurons in rats perfused with a mixture that fixes small neurotransmitter molecules; (ii) adsorption of the patient CSF with staphylococcal protein A-Sepharose and using a polyclonal antiserum against human IgG3 indicates that the immunocytochemical reaction in these brain regions is mainly due to the subclass IgG3; and (iii) the CSF immunocytochemical reaction is blocked by preincubation of the sections with a rabbit anti-acetylcholine antiserum.

The radicals in the liver were demonstrated to be localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. Rats fed ethanol in a low-fat diet showed significantly less free radical generation. Control animals given isocaloric diets without ethanol showed no evidence of free radicals in liver and heart. When liver microsomes prepared from rats fed the high-fat ethanol diet were incubated in a system containing ethanol, NADPH, and a spin-trapping agent, the generation of 1-hydroxyethyl radicals was observed. The latter was verified by using 13C-substituted ethanol. Microsomes from animals fed the high-fat ethanol-containing diet had higher levels of cytochrome P-450 than microsomes from rats fed the low-fat ethanol-containing diet. The results suggest that the consumption of ethanol results in the production of free radicals in rat liver and heart in vivo that appear to initiate lipid peroxidation.\r"

  ".W": "The accumulation of blood leukocytes at sites of inflammation depends upon their localized adhesion to the vascular lining. We have investigated the hypothesis that this adhesive interaction involves inducible endothelial cell-surface structures that can bind leukocytes. Certain inflammatory/immune cytokines, namely interleukin 1, tumor necrosis factor, and lymphotoxin, as well as bacterial endotoxin, act on cultured human endothelial cells (HEC) in a time- and protein-synthesis-dependent fashion to increase leukocyte adhesion. We have developed two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), H18/7 and H4/18, that identify a cell-surface antigen expressed on cytokine- and endotoxin-stimulated HEC but not on unstimulated HEC. Both mAbs immunoprecipitate the same polypeptides (major species, Mr 115,000; minor species, Mr 97,000, reduced) from biosynthetically labeled cytokine-stimulated HEC. The mediator specificity and kinetics of HEC expression of this protein(s) correlate with increased adhesiveness for leukocytes. In standardized endothelial-leukocyte adhesion assays, mAb H18/7 inhibits the adhesion of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (greater than 50%) and HL-60 cells (greater than 60%) to stimulated HEC by comparison to isotype-matched control mAb; mAb H4/18 also inhibits HL-60 adhesion but to a lesser extent. We have designated the inducible endothelial cell-surface protein recognized by mAb H18/7 and H4/18 \"endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1).\"\r"

Using these assays we show that determination of pS2 gene expression allows the definition of subclasses of estrogen-receptor-containing breast cancers that may be used to more precisely identify estrogen-dependent tumors. Tumor specimens have also been analyzed for the presence of mRNAs for the estrogen receptor and for the ERBB2 oncogene. No evidence for the presence of truncated forms of estrogen-receptor mRNA has been found, and overexpression of the ERBB2 oncogene did not correlate with the steroid receptor status or pS2 gene expression.\r"

We find that the frequency of acquisition of simultaneous resistance is 10-100 times higher than that predicted from the frequency of each resistance selected independently. In approximately 50% of cloned resistant variants, resistance is the result of amplification of the dihydrofolate reductase gene (methotrexate) and/or of the multiple-drug-resistance P-glycoprotein gene (doxorubicin). Prior exposure of cells to hypoxia markedly enhances these resistance frequencies. Our results indicate that the simultaneous emergence of resistance to these two cancer chemotherapeutic agents are not independent events, and we interpret them to constitute two consequences of the same basic process occurring at a high frequency.\r"

  ".U": "88097473\r", 
  ".W": "During short-term sensitization, a simple form of nonassociative learning in Aplysia, the presentation of a single brief noxious stimulus results in enhancement of the defensive withdrawal reflex lasting minutes to tens of minutes. This behavioral plasticity involves presynaptic facilitation of synaptic transmission from the mechanosensory neurons that mediate the reflex to their central target cells. This facilitation is due to cAMP-dependent protein phosphorylation. To determine whether the time course of presynaptic facilitation might be due to a persistent increase in activity of adenylate cyclase (EC 4.6.1.1) itself, persistence of the transmitter, or yet other processes, we developed a perfused-membrane method to analyze the time course of activation of adenylate cyclase by transient stimuli. After stimulation by a pulse of stimulatory transmitter, activation of adenylate cyclase decayed within 60 sec. This finding indicates that the enzyme does not remain persistently active in the absence of transmitter and suggests that short-term retention is likely to be due to other mechanisms. Possible additional mechanisms include continued activation of the cyclase by transmitter, cellular factors extrinsic to the cyclase that prolong the time course of its activation, and persistence of processes downstream from the cyclase.\r"

The evaluation of outcomes of hospital-acquired infections with resistant organisms was often confounded by risk factors also associated with poor outcomes. Nevertheless, for both nosocomial and community-acquired infections, the mortality, the likelihood of hospitalization, and the length of hospital stay were usually at least twice as great for patients infected with drug-resistant strains as for those infected with drug-susceptible strains of the same bacteria. Poor outcomes could be attributed both to the expected effects of ineffective antimicrobial therapy and to the unexpected occurrence of drug-resistant infections complicated by prior antimicrobial therapy for other medical problems. Although the adverse economic and health effects of drug-resistant bacterial infections can only be roughly quantified, it is concluded that antimicrobial resistance is an important health problem and an economic burden to society.\r"

Three hospital-wide outbreaks caused by Enterobacteriaceae occurred; these three outbreaks were due to Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae, respectively. The outbreaks were temporally related to the emergence of gentamicin resistance. Detailed analysis of the recent outbreak due to Enterobacter indicated that an increasing prevalence of gentamicin-resistant E. cloacae predated nosocomial infections by several months; this pattern suggested that such outbreaks could be predicted. Molecular epidemiologic data pertaining to the preservation over a decade of genes encoding gentamicin resistance were reviewed. In contrast to Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa gradually and progressively developed resistance to gentamicin that spread in an endemic fashion, with parallel increases in nosocomial infections. This pattern appeared to relate to different modes of spread and persistence for resistant P. aeruginosa that may require unique methods for control.\r"

Adult pentastomes parasitize the respiratory tracts of reptiles or carnivorous mammals. The infection is generally limited to the tropics and subtropics, but ocular involvement has been reported in the southern United States. The majority of human pentastomiasis is caused by two species. The first, Armillifer armillatus, infects humans as secondary hosts. Infection is usually asymptomatic but has characteristic postmortem and radiologic features. The second, Linguatula serrata, can infect humans as does Armillifer or can cause a self-limited nasopharyngitis--the halzoun or marrara syndrome--with the human acting as a temporary definitive host. This article discusses the biology and parasitology of these metazoans as well as the clinical manifestations, pathology, diagnosis, and epidemiology of pentastomiasis.\r"

The pharmaceutical company encounters difficulties with the return of documents, the ability to use the treatment data for registration claims, and the assessment of outcome and safety in patients with multiple confounding medical problems. The benefits of compassionate therapy for all participants should favor its continued use. Suggestions for the improvement of compassionate therapy programs include streamlining of case report forms and more disciplined completion of forms by investigators.\r"

Sixteen patients had opportunistic infections(s) without Kaposi's sarcoma. The remainder had disseminated Kaposi's sarcoma. The commonest opportunistic infection was Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Two patients were reported to be homosexual. Three others had been living in Africa, and one patient was born in Haiti. In two instances concurrent or subsequent opportunistic infection occurred in family members. All patients died 1 month to 6 years after the initial manifestation of disease.

Because of the age and sex distribution of AIDS cases in Africa, emphasis has been placed on sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Factors thought to influence this sexual transmission include (1) promiscuity, with a high prevalence of sexually transmitted disease; (2) sexual practices that have been associated with increased risk of transmission of AIDS virus (homosexuality and anal intercourse); and (3) cultural practices that are possibly connected with increased virus transmission (female \"circumcision\" and infibulation). Other nonsexual cultural practices that do not fit the age distribution pattern of AIDS but may expose individuals to HIV include (1) practices resulting in exposure to blood (medicinal bloodletting, rituals establishing \"blood brotherhood,\" and possibly ritual and medicinal enemas); (2) practices involving the use of shared instruments (injection of medicines, ritual scarification, group circumcision, genital tatooing, and shaving of body hair); and (3) contact with nonhuman primates. At the current time promiscuity seems to be the most important cultural factor contributing to the transmission of HIV in Africa.\r"

Pulmonary disease indistinguishable from that caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis was the commonest type of infection caused by M. szulgai (18 of 27 cases). Olecranon bursitis was reported in three cases, and disseminated infection was noted in three cases occurring in immunocompromised patients. M. szulgai is more susceptible to standard antimycobacterial agents than are other nontuberculous mycobacteria, notably the Mycobacterium avium complex. Clinical improvement and cure of pulmonary disease can be anticipated when treatment includes at least three drugs effective in in vitro susceptibility tests. Surgical excision appears unnecessary in pulmonary disease but may be indicated in olecranon bursitis.\r"

The contribution of age-related immunologic impairment to the pathogenesis of these infections has been difficult to determine because of a number of confounding variables associated with aging. Nevertheless, studies in vitro and in animals support the hypothesis that immunodeficiency accompanies the aging process. Multiple factors may be responsible for altered cell-mediated immunity in the elderly, including thymic involution, reduced levels of thymic hormones, and an increase in the number of immature T lymphocytes. While studies of T cell subpopulations have yielded conflicting results, it appears that T cell proliferative responses are diminished. Aging is also associated with abnormalities of humoral immunity. Although the number and functional activities of neutrophils from healthy elderly persons are relatively intact, diminished bactericidal activity and altered oxygen metabolism have been reported in extremely old individuals. While the relative importance and clinical impact of these immunologic abnormalities remain unclear, future studies may provide new strategies for the prevention and treatment of infections in this rapidly growing segment of the population.\r"

Care givers should encourage patients with AIDS to express their preferences about life-sustaining treatment in order to avoid dilemmas should these patients later become incompetent. The AIDS epidemic may force more explicit discussions about the allocation of limited health-care resources, such as intensive care. Such allocation decisions should not discriminate against patients with AIDS.\r"

These advances took place in Europe and Great Britain, culminating in the publication in 1868 of the seminal work on fever in human disease by Carl Wunderlich. In the United States thermometry was popularized by a number of distinguished American physicians who used European data that had appeared in British and American journals even before 1868. Thus Edward Seguin and Austin Flint included fever curves and vital signs in articles that appeared in 1866. Flint and Jacob DaCosta added sections on thermometry to their medical textbooks in 1866-1867, and Edouard Seguin (the father of Edward) encouraged the use of thermometry by the public at large in a series of articles in the medical and lay press. Within just two decades thermometry became recognized as an indispensable medical tool, which it remains to the present time.\r"

From the time of its establishment in 1894 until 1923, the psychiatric patients presented treatment and management problems that remained unaddressed. Since 1923, however, psychiatric consultants have provided care and treatment for this segment of the Carville population. This paper presents the findings of three of these consultants for the period 1923 to 1985, and outlines similarities and differences in the diagnoses, treatments, and disposition of patients, as well as indications for future investigations.\r"

In addition, we compared the incidence in uncompromised vs compromised hosts, inpatients vs outpatients, and children vs adults. P-fimbriated E coli were isolated in more than 80% of uncompromised patients with either acute pyelonephritis or acute prostatitis. In clinically compromised patients having these disorders, the incidence dropped to approximately 30% (P less than .025). Neither age nor inpatient/outpatient status was a significant factor. We stress the importance of P-fimbriation as a virulence factor in acute pyelonephritis and acute prostatitis caused by E coli, though these diseases may be caused by less virulent organisms in compromised patients. Thus, patients with acute pyelonephritis or acute prostatitis caused by E coli negative for P-fimbriae probably should be considered compromised; the compromising factor should be determined as a guide to subsequent treatment.\r"

Comparison of annual deaths versus donations (1982 to 1985) between Eisenhower Army Medical Center and the Medical College of Georgia reveals that Eisenhower had lower rates of cornea donation. Attitudinal surveys showed that physicians omitting organ donation requests rarely found personal objections to the request. Few house staff were familiar, initially, with correct criteria for cornea donation. Presentation of this information to physicians increased donation requests and consequently organ retrieval. This trial's success prompted requests for expansion of donation information to include other tissues.\r"

The practitioner caring for children requires both anatomic and physiologic information concerning the urinary tract to assist in diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Advances in diagnostic imaging have resulted in numerous methods for evaluation of the urinary system. These procedures differ in the type of information obtained, risk or discomfort to the patient, and cost. Selection of the proper test(s) requires an understanding of these factors. Based on our survey of recent pertinent literature and our clinical experience, we present guidelines for appropriate diagnostic imaging in children with UTI, and we discuss the benefits and limitations of available imaging techniques along with concepts regarding the pathogenesis of UTI and causes of renal damage from UTI.\r"

A positive diagnosis was made in 32 episodes of pneumonitis (24 patients), giving a diagnostic yield of 80%. In 31 of these the diagnosis was made within 24 hours of bronchoscopy and this enabled the appropriate treatment to be instituted early. Eighteen patients recovered from their primary infection, although two died subsequently of respiratory failure due to postpneumonic lung destruction. Ten patients later developed a second episode of pneumonitis and a diagnosis was made in nine of these. Only three survived a second episode. Bronchoalveolar lavage was well tolerated by all patients and there was no morbidity or mortality that could be directly attributed to the procedure. Bronchoalveolar lavage is a safe and valuable early diagnostic procedure for the investigation of pulmonary complications in patients who have received bone marrow transplants.\r"

One hundred patients with chronic airflow limitation were asked how their quality of life was affected by their illness, and how important their symptoms and limitations were. The most frequent and important items were used to construct a questionnaire evaluating four dimensions: dyspnoea, fatigue, emotional function, and the patient's feeling of control over the disease (mastery). Reproducibility, tested by repeated administration to patients in a stable condition, was excellent: the coefficient of variation was less than 12% for all four dimensions. Responsiveness (sensitivity to change) was tested by administering the questionnaire to 13 patients before and after optimisation of their drug treatment and to another 28 before and after participation in a respiratory rehabilitation programme. In both cases large, statistically significant improvements in all four dimensions were noted. Changes in questionnaire score were correlated with changes in spirometric values, exercise capacity, and patients' and physicians' global ratings. Thus it has been shown that the questionnaire is precise, valid, and responsive. It can therefore serve as a useful disease specific measure of quality of life for clinical trials.\r"

Sequential radiographs showed that in 55 patients the tumour first appeared in adult life and that in 53 it progressively increased in size. The age incidence and progressive growth leads to the conclusion that the tumour is a benign neoplasm rather than a hamartoma, consisting of various connective tissues intersected by clefts lined by respiratory epithelium. The epithelial elements are regarded as entrapped non-neoplastic inclusions and the tumour as a purely mesenchymal neoplasm: the name mesenchymoma therefore seems the most appropriate. There were two recurrences after simple enucleation, 10 and 12 years later. A total of 142 tumours were parenchymal, and only 12 were endobronchial. All lobes were affected but there was a slight preponderance in the left upper lobe. Four patients had two (synchronous) mesenchymomas. There was an associated bronchial carcinoma in 11 patients, synchronous in six and metachronous in five.\r"

Oral terbutaline improved morning peak flow (259 v 213 l min-1) and decreased nocturnal inhaler usage (1.3 v 1.9) with no alteration in sleep quality as assessed electroencephalographically. The study shows that oral sustained release terbutaline can be useful in the treatment of nocturnal asthma without impairment of sleep quality.\r"

Bronchiolar strips from 30 patients, 12 of whom had chronic bronchitis, were examined in the organ bath for their responses to histamine, methacholine, and leukotriene (LT) C4. The same airways were also studied histologically and small airway disease was quantified by subjective grading of the degree of inflammatory cell infiltration, smooth muscle hypertrophy, fibrosis, and goblet cell hyperplasia. The degree of small airway disease varied widely among patients both with and without chronic bronchitis. Multiple regression analysis failed to show increased sensitivity (-log EC50) to histamine, methacholine, or LTC4 in relation to small airway disease. In contrast, the only significant correlations found were between a decreased -log EC50 to histamine and methacholine and an increased small airway disease score. Contractile responses (Tmax) to histamine and methacholine in peripheral airways tended to be higher in patients with chronic bronchitis than in those without. Tmax was not related to small airway disease scores. These results suggest that chronic airway inflammation does not cause in vitro hyperresponsiveness of human small airway smooth muscle.\r"

No effect was found on fasting blood glucose concentration or glycosylated haemoglobin concentration. Peak blood glucose concentration 30 minutes after a 75 g oral glucose load was, however, significantly higher (7.1 (SEM 0.2) versus 6.7 (0.1) mmol/l, or 128 (3.6) v 121 (1.8) mg/100 ml). After treatment there was a 36% increase in fasting serum insulin concentration (7.6 (0.7) versus 5.6 (0.5) mU/l) and a 32% increase in the area under the serum insulin concentration curve after glucose challenge. High dose inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate treatment raised the fasting plasma cholesterol concentration (4.62 (0.25) v 4.16 (0.26) mmol/l, or 178 (9.7) v 161 (10.0) mg/100 ml) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.19 (0.065) versus 0.97 (0.065) mmol/l, or 45 (2.5) v 37 (2.5) mg/100 ml). Fasting blood lactate and pyruvate concentrations were also significantly higher and blood glycerol lower. The findings indicate that high dose inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate may disturb both carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.\r"

Lobar consolidation was the most common radiological pattern, being present in 10 of the 15 cases. Type b was the commonest serotype isolated, but three cases were due to non-typable (non-capsulate) strains. All patients survived, responding well to treatment with penicillin, ampicillin, or chloramphenicol.

Hyperacute rejection caused in sensitized recipients by lymphocytotoxic antibodies is similar in that the immune reaction triggers an acute inflammatory reaction that leads to widespread thrombotic occlusion and devascularization of the graft. The events after xenotransplantation between certain species are essentially the same. Potential strategies to avoid the precipitating antigen antibody reaction or to mitigate the resulting effector cascade are described.\r"

This was statistically significantly lower than survival rates in Lea or Leb patients of 60% and 64%, respectively, at 1 year (P = .01 and P = .009). We conclude that if Le- patients had rejected an Le+ graft, a repeated incompatibility should be avoided since the recipients had already demonstrated immunoreactivity against this epitope. Recipients being confronted with an Le group mismatch in the first graft often have successful grafts and the difference in 1-year graft survival of Lea (75%), Leb (76%), and Le- (68%) patients was not statistically significant different. We suggest that the matching scheme for the Le groups be reevaluated. The older method of matching on the basis of Le+ and Le- is probably no longer justified. According to chemical structure, it would appear that Leb should be a universal recipient and Lec a universal donor. This scheme, however, has failed to correspond to interracial transplants between whites and blacks. A matching scheme that requires identity between donor and recipient showed a remarkable correlation with the results between black-to-black, black-to-white, white-to-black and white-to-white transplants.\r"

Once a secondary anti-B response was mounted, plasma exchange was ineffective and IgM and IgG anti-B titers rose to high levels. Associated with the increased anti-B titers, cardiac function deteriorated and on day 13 the group B heart was replaced by a group A allograft. The compatible allograft functioned well initially but was eventually rejected, and the patient died 51 days after the initial transplantation. Histologic examination of the first allograft revealed a delayed form of typical antibody-mediated rejection with destruction of the microvasculature associated with antibody deposition and acute inflammation. By contrast, the histopathology of the second compatible allograft was typical of cell-mediated allograft rejection. Extracts of myocardium from the incompatible heart contained IgM and IgG anti-B, while no anti-B alloantibody was demonstrable in the extracts of the ABO-compatible allograft and a control heart. The utility of plasma exchange with group AB FFP replacement in such a circumstance requires further study.\r"

  ".W": "Although our analysis is very incomplete, our data indicate that a complete explanation of tolerance induced neonatally to H-2 encoded alloantigens will include elements of clonal deletion and active suppression. Background genes not encoded in H-2 play an important role in determining the extent to which clonal reduction occurs. In mice of B10 background genotype, extensive elimination of clones capable of recognizing class I and class II antigens is accomplished. Tolerance to class I alloantigens alone seems to be maintained almost exclusively by this mechanism. In B10 background mice tolerant of class II antigens alone or in consort with class I alloantigens, peripherally maintained (post-thymic) active suppression exists, that is dependent upon donor I-J expression, and is superimposed on clonal reduction. As a consequence, the activities of class II alloantigen-specific cells appear to be reduced to background, a level insufficient to activate specific effector precursors, even in the presence of relevant alloantigens. Donor alloantigens expressed on chimeric cells that exist among central (bone marrow, thymus) and peripheral (spleen, lymph nodes) lymphoid cells are undoubtedly crucial both to the process of ongoing clonal elimination as well as of active suppression. The role of clonal reduction in the maintenance of class II alone tolerance in mice of A/J background is more obscure. If the class II alloreactive cells that provide helper/inducer activity are identical to the cells that provide effector function (cytotoxic T cells, TDTH cells), then clonal reduction seems not to occur. Instead, class II tolerogen reactive cells remain within the peripheral lymphoid tissues of the tolerant mice, but appear to be incapable of differentiating beyond the initial steps of antigen-driven activation. We know little about the process by which such cells could be placed under these differentiation strictures, nor why they are retained within the tolerant animal's lymphoid mass. However, the absence of detectable chimerism in alloclass II tolerant animals of A/J background may offer an important clue to solving this mystery.\r"

As a consequence of diabetic nephropathy, 163 of them (16%) developed renal failure. Ten diabetic (6%) and 72 non-diabetic (9%) patients received grafts from a living donor. One-year patient survival did not differ between diabetic and non-diabetic patients (76% and 79%, respectively). From the second post-transplant year onwards patient survival was worse in diabetic than in non-diabetic patients. The two groups did not differ with respect to graft survival. Sixty-two diabetic patients (38%) died during the follow-up period, with myocardial infarction as the most common cause of death (31%), followed by infection (15%) and cerebral stroke (13%). Seven myocardial infarctions out of 19 occurred within three months of transplantation. However, significantly more fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarctions were observed in post-transplant patients who had returned to dialysis therapy than in patients with a functioning kidney graft. Blindness did not influence the outcome of transplantation. Nor did the transplantation significantly affect the course of this diabetic complication. In conclusion, although the early success rate of kidney transplantation in our study population was acceptable, the later outcome was poor, mainly due to advanced disease-related complications.\r"

The aim of the study was to compare different methods of determining glomerular function in patients with renal scarring due to previous pyelonephritis and to determine the urinary excretion of beta 2-microglobulin in these patients. All individuals were investigated in hydropenia. The patients with renal scarring had significantly lower GFR, smaller kidneys and lower urinary osmolality than the controls. A significant positive correlation between GFR and total renal area (r = 0.70, p less than 0.001) and between GFR and urinary albumin excretion (r = -0.69, p less than 0.001) was demonstrated. This indicates that determinations of total renal area from an i.v. urography and the urinary albumin excretion can be used for estimating GFR. Increased urinary excretion of beta 2-microglobulin does not occur in patients with renal scarring until the glomerular function is severely deteriorated.\r"

  ".W": "In 23 morbidly obese patients we investigated the influence of a large weight loss (30.6 kg, range 17.5-90.8) on the plasma fibronectin concentrations. Further, changes in plasma fibronectin were related to serum insulin levels and to liver biochemistry. Between the measurements patients had been treated with an intermittent very-low-calorie formula diet sufficient in respect to protein, minerals and vitamins. They were investigated in weight-stable states. Before weight reduction, 14 patients (61%, 95% confidence limits 39-80%) had elevated plasma fibronectin levels. Plasma fibronectin decreased (medians 1.22 and 0.59 mumol/l before and after weight loss, p less than 0.01) and was after weight loss within the normal range in 14 patients. The change in plasma fibronectin was unassociated with the magnitude of the weight loss as well as with the reduction of overweight. The resulting plasma fibronectin levels were also uncorrelated with the body weight and with the final degree of overweight. Serum insulin decreased (p less than 0.01) during the weight reduction and the change correlated (p less than 0.05) with the change in plasma fibronectin. Serum lactate dehydrogenase, which is associated with the degree of hepatic fatty change, declined (p less than 0.01), but the individual change was unrelated with the change in plasma fibronectin. In conclusion, the elevated plasma fibronectin levels in morbidly obese subjects seem to normalize during weight loss. We suggest the normalization to be mediated--at least in part--by a reduction of the insulin levels.\r"

In order to evaluate the possible clinical significance, 65 middle-aged men with impaired glucose tolerance, and normal serum levels of vitamin D metabolites, were enrolled in a three-month study where they were given either 0.75 micrograms alpha-calcidol (1 alpha(OH)D3) daily or placebo. Indices of glucose and lipid metabolism were evaluated before and after treatment. There were no significant changes during the trial neither for fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c or for the intravenous glucose tolerance between the treatment and the placebo groups, nor were there any consistent changes in insulin values during the glucose tolerance test. Subjects treated with alpha-calcidol displayed a significant reduction in body weight with an average of 1.1 kg, while those receiving placebo lost no weight. Treatment did not affect the serum lipoprotein values. Thus, a modest dose of active vitamin D, which did not cause elevation of serum calcium, did not provide general improvement of glucose tolerance or of insulin secretion when given to patients with impaired glucose tolerance, but without vitamin D deficiency, over a three-month period.\r"

Before therapy there was an inverse relationship between serum calcium levels and diastolic blood pressure (p less than 0.02). Treatment with 1 microgram alphacalcidol raised the serum calcium by 0.07 mmol/l during a 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and caused a significant reduction of diastolic blood pressure by 9.2 mmHg compared with placebo (p less than 0.01). The study extends previous observations, in normocalcaemic subjects, of inverse relationships between serum calcium and blood pressure indicating a primary disturbance of calcium homeostasis in hypertension. The observation that a physiologic amount of active vitamin D has hypotensive effects agrees with such a concept and suggests a new principle for the treatment of hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of the present study concerning patients with long-term insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus was to determine whether the serum lipid and lipoprotein concentrations differ in subjects with and without residual insulin secretion. We also investigated whether factors such as sex, smoking, physical activity and microvascular lesions were associated with particular lipoprotein profiles. C-peptide excretion (greater than or equal to 0.2 nmol) in 24-hour urine samples was used as an indicator of residual insulin secretion. Twenty-two pairs of patients with and without residual insulin secretion matched for age at onset and disease duration were participating in the investigations of glycaemic control and microvascular lesions. The HbA1c was significantly lower in C-peptide excretors than in the non-excretors (6.9 +/- 0.3 vs. 7.9 +/- 0.3%, p less than 0.025). The lipids and lipoprotein fractions were all within normal limits. The HDL2/3 ratio was significantly higher in C-peptide excretors than in non-excretors (1.72 +/- 0.28 vs. 1.10 +/- 0.09, p less than 0.05). Multiple regression analysis showed that factors, such as physical activity, body mass index and glycaemic control could explain more of the variation in the different lipid and lipoprotein fractions than residual C-peptide excretion alone. The only fraction correlating with C-peptide excretion was HDL3 cholesterol. It is concluded that minute residual insulin secretion per se is of minor importance for the regulation of lipids and lipoproteins. Glucose control and residual insulin secretion together with environmental factors seem to be of great importance for the regulation of the lipid and lipoprotein levels in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\r"

SMA in low titer associated with liver pathology was a transient phenomenon. SMA in high titer combined with liver pathology seems to be a persistent condition with respect to both parameters, although no additional patients developed CAH between the first testing and re-examination.\r"

  ".W": "Electrocardiographic abnormalities have been known to occur in the context of neurologic disease for a long time. These changes fall into 2 categories: arrhythmias and repolarization abnormalities. However, until relatively recently these changes were believed to represent purely electrophysiologic alterations and not real heart disease. It is now clear that some patients with neurogenic electrocardiographic changes show cardiac enzyme release and myofibrillar degeneration at autopsy. There are 4 major methods for producing myofibrillar degeneration (i.e., contraction band necrosis or coagulative myocytolysis): catecholamine infusion, stress-steroid, nervous system stimulation and reperfusion. The common thread connecting these 4 methods is the opening of receptor-operated calcium channels, resulting in intense contraction of cardiac muscle. Thus, neurogenic influence over cardiac function may represent a continuum. In the mild reversible circumstance, only the electrocardiographic change will be seen, whereas in the severe, irreversible situation, myofibrillar degeneration will ensue with release of cardiac enzymes. Cardiac cell death may be caused by oxygen free radicals produced by metabolism of catecholamines or reperfusion or both, after variable periods of ischemia. This concept represents a unifying hypothesis, tying together the clinical, physiologic, biochemical and pathologic findings in neurogenic heart disease.\r"

  ".W": "For at least the last 200 years it has been suspected that somatic manifestations of psychological distress play a role in the medical recognition and treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD). The cardiovascular system is intricately linked to the experience of emotion, and these links may explain how and when neuroticism can cloud the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. A possible source of anginal symptoms in the absence of angiographically documented CAD is high standing on the personality dimension of neuroticism, which is a broad dimension of individual differences in the tendency to experience negative, distressing emotions and to possess associated behavioral and cognitive traits. A brief review of the clinical cardiologic literature on chest pain is presented, with special attention to distinguishing true angina pectoris from pseudoangina and related syndromes. After a brief description of the major dimensions of normal personality, especially the domain of neuroticism, empirical evidence is reviewed on 1,191 adult men and women who 10 years earlier had made chest pain or discomfort reports part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The findings illustrate neuroticism's links to illness and disease. When the mean initial neuroticism levels of the chest pain groups were compared, significantly higher initial levels of neuroticism were found for those who reported any pain or discomfort. As hypothesized, logistic regression results on myocardial infarction death indicated no increased risk due to neuroticism. Neuroticism was related to increased somatic complaints, including chest pain or angina-like complaints, but was not causally or etiologically related to objective signs or pathophysiologic evidence of disease, especially CAD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Biologic mechanisms responsible for increased risk of coronary disease in persons with high levels of hostility and anger appear to involve increased cardiovascular and neuroendocrine responses to behavioral challenge, and, possibly, inadequate parasympathetic antagonism of sympathetic nervous system effects. Future research should concentrate on further refining our understanding of the hostility complex and its pathophysiologic mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "The word, behavior, means action or reaction. Thus, all physiologic responses meet this definition and are behavior. Furthermore, if the response is neurally mediated, then there are only 3 possible behavioral mechanisms that can be operating to determine it: (1) The response is part of a reflex, elicited by an adequate stimulus. In this case, in an intact animal the expression of the response will be modulated by a variety of situational factors. (2) The response is part of a reflex. However, the capacity of the stimulus to elicit the response is acquired through association with an adequate stimulus. Thus, the reflex is learned rather than innate. (3) The response is part of a \"central command\" and is emitted in anticipation of a consequence whose likelihood of occurrence has been learned. Neurally mediated responses of the circulation meet all these criteria. Thus, circulatory responses not only are passive reflexes, they also are reactive and proactive behaviors, which permit animals to interact effectively with their environments, and which change with practice. These principles explain a variety of cardiovascular effects observed in experimental or clinical settings. Furthermore, by applying well-established behavioral principles to circulatory responses, it is possible to achieve clinically significant effects. This presentation will characterize the way in which behavioral mechanisms are expressed in the circulation, it will describe a number of clinically significant findings that illustrate the importance of these mechanisms, and it will propose a number of applications of behavioral principles that can be used in clinical practice.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical syndrome of angina pectoris was accurately described over 200 years ago by Sir William Heberden. However, in recent years, we have learned that many episodes of myocardial ischemia occur that are not accompanied by symptoms of angina pectoris. These silent ischemic episodes may be detected either during exercise testing, using electrocardiographic criteria that can be combined with scintigraphic studies evaluating myocardial blood flow (thallium perfusion studies) or left ventricular function (gated blood pool scans). In addition, continuous electrocardiographic (Holter) monitoring can be used for the detection of transient ST-segment changes; these changes on Holter monitoring have been correlated with abnormalities of myocardial perfusion and function, indicating that they represent true ischemic events. Studies have shown that patients with coronary artery disease who have evidence of ongoing ischemia, whether symptomatic or silent, have an increased risk for experiencing subsequent cardiac events than patients without evidence of ischemia. Many studies have demonstrated that ischemia during an exercise study after myocardial infarction identifies patients at high risk for recurrent cardiac events, whether or not the ischemia is associated with angina pectoris. Holter monitoring has allowed for the detection of ischemic events out of hospital in ambulatory patients. Studies in stable angina patients have shown that there are many asymptomatic episodes in this setting, which are often occurring at low heart rates during activities of everyday life, without an apparent significant increase in myocardial oxygen demands, and these episodes may even be precipitated by mental stress.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Research over the last 25 years has delineated the syndrome of panic disorder/agoraphobia from a myriad of medical, cardiologic and psychiatric diagnoses. This syndrome is characterized by the sudden onset of episodes of panic and terror, accompanied by extreme physiologic symptoms including palpitations, tachycardia, chest pain, shortness of breath, trembling, faintness, etc. These patients become quite anxious and hypochondriacal and begin to avoid certain situations in which they feel a recurrence of a panic attack would be dangerous or embarrassing. This avoidance (agoraphobia) typically involves malls, grocery stores, churches, crowds, bridges, planes, waiting in lines, visiting dentists, highways, etc., and rarely (5%) actually confines the patient to his home. With the prevalence of 3 to 7% in the general population, evidence suggests that many of these patients are currently unrecognized in primary care, internal medicine and cardiology practices. Over 90% believe they have a physical disorder and do not present to psychiatrists but instead to neurologists (44%), cardiologists (39%) and gastroenterologists (33%). Perhaps as many as one-third of patients with atypical chest pain, particularly if results of coronary angiograms are normal, have unrecognized panic disorder. Effective treatments in most patients are now available and are described. These include medications that block the panic attacks and reduce the anxiety and phobic fears and they are generally used in combination with behavioral treatments.\r"

  ".W": "Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is due to a heterogeneous group of conditions that may affect the mitral valve or the mitral valve apparatus. Although MVP may progress later in life to frank mitral insufficiency requiring mitral valve repair or may predispose to bacterial endocarditis, in most cases it is a benign, idiopathic condition without serious consequences. However, many investigators have documented that MVP is often associated with a constellation of signs and symptoms, which appear to constitute a distinct syndrome. These associated findings include autonomic dysfunction, frequent complaints of chest pain, palpitations, orthostasis, fatigue, dyspnea on exertion and anxiety. Although the risk of significant myocardial dysfunction or bacterial endocarditis appears to be related to patient sex, age and the severity of valvular prolapse and insufficiency, there appears to be little or no relations between the extent of prolapse and the degree of autonomic dysfunction or the severity of symptoms of chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea on exertion and anxiety. The development of uniform diagnostic standards for mental disorders has helped to make it possible to identify several related entities, including generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder and agoraphobia; patients with these disorders frequently somatize their anxiety and complain of many symptoms which may be seen in patients with MVP. Although several studies have reported an increased frequency of MVP in patients with anxiety disorders, recent studies suggest that the conditions are not linked. Iatrogenic cardiac neurosis is common in both groups of patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In addition, the importance of psychological risk factors for the development of coronary artery disease (e.g., life stress and the Type A behavior pattern) and the impact of denial on the cardiac patient's condition will be discussed. Management strategies that include nonpharmacologic (i.e., support, reassurance, brief psychotherapy and cardiac rehabilitation) and psychopharmacologic interventions (e.g., the rational use of benzodiazepines, antidepressants and neuroleptic agents) for psychiatric conditions in the MI patient will be provided.

Contributing factors consist of the type of anxiety, constitutional characteristics and personality traits. The treatment of anxiety thus has a beneficial effect on patients with cardiovascular disease. However, anxiety reduction through medication, even if it includes subjective improvement in somatic symptoms, should not necessarily be equated with beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system. Three groups of medication used in the treatment of anxiety have different effects. Antidepressants lower psychic anxiety but may have the opposite effect on the cardiovascular system, whereas beta-adrenergic blockers lower sympathetic tone without affecting psychic anxiety. Only benzodiazepines fulfill both functions. Since subjective reports of somatic, including cardiovascular, changes correlate poorly with physiologic changes, assessment of new medications should not rely on self-reported improvement in cardiac symptoms but should include objective measures as well.\r"

  ".W": "Parenteral histamine (H2)-receptor antagonists are frequently used to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding caused by stress-induced gastric mucosal damage in critically ill patients. It is generally agreed that the goal of therapy in this syndrome is the consistent elevation of gastric pH levels above a certain value, often set at 4, in order to prevent the underlying mucosal damage from progressing to bleeding. The three H2-receptor antagonists currently available in a parenteral form and suitable for this mode of prophylaxis are cimetidine, ranitidine, and famotidine. The pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of these agents, as they relate to their use in prevention of stress ulceration bleeding, are discussed here. These agents are more noted for their pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic similarities in acid suppression, elimination, and metabolism than for their differences. Ranitidine and famotidine are more potent than cimetidine, and famotidine has a slightly longer half-life than do cimetidine and ranitidine, but current dosing recommendations take these differences into account so that the agents have equivalent efficacy. Cimetidine and ranitidine have been widely used in this application. Less experience has been obtained, to date, with famotidine. Recent studies with primed, continuous infusions of cimetidine indicate that dosing schedule may be the key to obtaining better efficacy in prophylaxis of stress-related mucosal damage. Similar studies with ranitidine have not yielded results as promising as those with cimetidine, however, and few data are available on famotidine.\r"

Because the presence of gastric acid is required for stress-related mucosal damage to occur, therapy aimed at increasing intraluminal pH values has often been used as prophylaxis against complications. The amount of acid suppression required for adequate prophylaxis of gastrointestinal bleeding from stress-related mucosal damage has not been determined, but many investigators use a target gastric pH level of 3.5 to 4.0. When intravenous histamine (H2)-receptor antagonists are given in bolus dosing regimens to critically ill patients, fluctuations in gastric pH values are often observed, as might be expected. However, recent studies with primed continuous infusion of cimetidine in critically ill patients have demonstrated that consistent elevation of gastric pH to 4.0 may be attained with this regimen. Studies with continuous infusions of ranitidine are less conclusive; little information is available on famotidine.\r"

  ".W": "Stress ulcer syndrome, the occurrence of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation from stress-related mucosal damage, is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. The mortality rate in critically ill patients who have bled from stress ulcers ranges from 50 to 77 percent, whereas the mortality rate for similar patients without stress ulcer bleeding ranges from 9 to 22 percent. The mortality rate may be as high as 90 percent in patients with clinically overt bleeding; as many as one-third of these deaths can be directly related to bleeding. Prophylactic therapy for prevention of stress ulcer bleeding is based on three premises: (1) morbidity and mortality related to stress ulcer syndrome are significant; (2) the population at risk can be identified prior to bleeding; and (3) therapy that decreases gastric acidity or improves gastric mucosal defense mechanisms will prevent ulcer formation or progression to bleeding. A review of prospective clinical studies utilizing prophylactic therapy in critically ill patients and patients undergoing surgery revealed a 17 percent overall bleeding rate for placebo groups compared with lower bleeding rates for antacid- and histamine (H2)-receptor-antagonist-treated groups (4 and 7 percent, respectively). Studies varied greatly in definition of bleeding, dosage regimens, and gastric pH goals. The need to measure gastric pH during treatment is controversial, and the optimal pH goal and the length of time for which it must be maintained remain unknown. Controversy exists as to the best therapeutic option for prophylaxis of stress ulcer syndrome, but when prevention of clinically significant bleeding is the therapeutic goal, antacids and H2-receptor antagonists appear to be equally efficacious.\r"

  ".W": "Stress-related mucosal damage of the upper gastrointestinal tract occurs in the majority of critically ill patients. The more severe the underlying disease, the greater the chance that mucosal damage and subsequent bleeding will develop. Clinical outcome is determined by the type and severity of the underlying illness; however, cases with severe gastric damage, as diagnosed by endoscopic examination or by bleeding, have the poorest prognoses. Endoscopy is the most sensitive method for diagnosing stress-related mucosal damage. Other indicators of stress-related mucosal damage are macroscopic evidence of bleeding, blood transfusion requirement, or measures of occult bleeding; these tests cannot diagnose nonbleeding lesions. Low gastric pH values may also indicate physiologic response to stress, but such values are not uniformly correlated with the presence of injury. Vigorous acid suppression with prolonged periods of pH control may be necessary to treat stress-related mucosal damage and to prevent bleeding. Treatment modalities in current use include antacids, cimetidine, and other histamine (H2)-receptor antagonists, and, more recently, sucralfate. Current evidence indicates that antacids, given hourly and titrated to a present pH goal, or primed continuous infusion of cimetidine are the most efficacious regimens in maintaining intragastric pH control.\r"

Physical therapies, such as pressure on the cricoid, have been successful, as has the administration of clear antacids prior to surgery. The histamine (H2)-receptor antagonists cimetidine and ranitidine have also been used successfully as prophylactic therapy when enough time is available prior to operation to make preoperative dosing practical. Metoclopramide, which can be given intravenously, may be useful in emergency surgery. When the degree of risk is high, concurrent use of physical and pharmaceutical interventions is recommended.\r"

What have not been appreciated until recently are the potential therapeutic benefits that may be derived from cytochrome P-450 inhibition. Evidence is presented here that cytochrome P-450 inhibition may protect against hepatic damage induced by acetaminophen and other drugs metabolized via this system. Acetaminophen hepatotoxicity is an especially important problem because of the widespread use of this agent and the evidence that the potential for such injury may be increased in alcoholic persons. Cimetidine has been used in selected cases, one of which is described here, to treat acetaminophen hepatotoxicity. All H2-receptor antagonists may not be alike in this regard. Experimental studies in animal models indicate that although cimetidine protects against the hepatotoxic effects of acetaminophen, ranitidine may actually potentiate hepatic damage. It is thought that the difference between these two H2-receptor antagonists may lie in their affinities for binding to the cytochrome P-450 enzymes. Cimetidine, which binds more strongly, inhibits this system more efficiently, whereas the inhibition produced by ranitidine is not sufficient to confer a protective effect against drug-induced hepatotoxicity.\r"

In treated animals, marked hemodynamic improvement was shown as compared with the untreated animals. Administration of the histamine (H2)-receptor antagonist ranitidine was not effective in reducing resuscitative fluid volume, leading to the hypothesis that cimetidine acts via predominantly non-H2-receptor antagonist mechanisms. Evidence is presented for a multifactorial mechanism by which cimetidine offers protection from burn shock. The mechanisms under investigation include inhibition of the hepatic cytochrome P-450 enzymes, cimetidine/copper scavenging of oxygen free radicals, inhibition of thromboxane synthesis, and imidazole buffering capacity. Acting via one or all of these mechanisms, cimetidine may protect against the vascular permeability changes and circulatory collapse that can follow severe thermal injury.\r"

This decrease probably relates to an increased understanding of those mechanisms responsible for the pathogenesis of stress-related mucosal damage and the application of this knowledge to prophylaxis and treatment. Stress-related bleeding has become less of a clinical problem, in part, because of the development of improved techniques for the treatment of shock and its accompanying gastric mucosal hypoperfusion. The nearly routine use of prophylactic antacid and/or histamine (H2)-receptor antagonist therapy to adequately buffer intragastric acidity is another factor that has minimized the development of stress-related damage. As continued understanding of the mechanisms responsible for stress damage is obtained and therapy applied appropriately, this disease should become a disorder of only historical interest in years to come.\r"

This article reviews the literature in this area and summarizes the questions that remain for future investigators to answer. Interest in the role of protein intake in renal disease dates back to the early 1900s, when several investigators found that the progression of renal failure was accelerated in rats and rabbits fed high-protein diets. Subsequent work in animal models has demonstrated that nephron loss, resulting from a variety of disease states, is associated with elevated intraglomerular pressures and flows. Several investigators now have postulated that these abnormal hemodynamics, resulting from intrarenal vasodilation and hyperperfusion, damage the glomerulus and may produce further nephron loss independent of the initial renal insult. Dietary protein restriction appears to reduce these pressures and flows towards normal in animals, although the operative mechanism has yet to be identified. Limited studies of dietary protein restriction in human renal disease have suggested a beneficial effect, but carefully controlled prospective studies will be necessary to establish clear therapeutic efficacy.\r"

The authors have shown this drug induces myeloid differentiation of HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells and is an effective agent in certain patients with chronic granulocytic leukemia. In order to investigate the mechanism by which this drug inhibits RNA synthesis we have compared the effect of mithramycin on RNA synthesis by whole cells, isolated nuclei, and RNA synthesis by isolated E. coli RNA polymerase and eukaryotic RNA polymerase II. Exposure of HL-60 cells to mithramycin at concentrations of 4.6 X 10(-7) m or higher for 48 hours causes an almost immediate inhibition of RNA synthesis (up to 85% at 4 hours) with only modest cytotoxicity at these concentrations. Endogenous RNA synthesis by isolated nuclei can be inhibited by mithramycin only at high concentrations (greater than 10(-5) m), suggesting that mithramycin primarily may inhibit initiation, rather than elongation. Mithramycin inhibits in vitro transcription of salmon sperm DNA by E. coli RNA polymerase at DNA:drug ratios similar to those required for RNA synthesis inhibition in whole cells. Similar DNA binding studies with synthetic oligonucleotides demonstrate that mithramycin is a potent inhibitor of transcription of Poly dG.dC by E. coli RNA polymerase but has no effect on transcription of Poly dA.dT. The rapid inhibition of whole cell and isolated RNA polymerase transcription, and the relative insensitivity of isolated nuclei, suggest mithramycin may interact with specific DNA sequences in order to inhibit the initiation of RNA synthesis in intact cells.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of enalapril alone and in combination with the cyclooxygenase inhibitors sulindac and indomethacin on blood pressure (BP), plasma aldosterone, renin activity and converting enzyme activity were evaluated in 29 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension, 26 of whom had low plasma renin activity. Patients were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups. All patients underwent a 4-week placebo phase (phase I), then received enalapril (20 mg BID) for 4 weeks (phase II). In phase III, group I (n = 10) continued on enalapril alone; group II (n = 9) received sulindac 200 mg BID plus enalapril, and group III (n = 10) received indomethacin 50 mg BID plus enalapril, all for 4 weeks. Enalapril lowered BP significantly (mean supine BP 149/100 in phase I vs. 134/90 in phase II, p less than 0.05) without inhibiting aldosterone production. The BP effect was not blunted by concomitant administration of sulindac or indomethacin. Enalapril lowered converting enzyme activity to 25% to 30% of baseline and tended to increase renin activity. In the 10 patients who received indomethacin (group III), the effects of enalapril alone and enalapril plus indomethacin on urinary excretion of 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha (PGF1 alpha), a stable metabolite of prostacyclin (PGI2), were examined. Enalapril increased urinary 6-keto PGF1 alpha in group III from 118 +/- 23 to 194 +/- 38 ng/g creatinine (p less than 0.05), while addition of indomethacin reduced 6-keto PGF1 alpha to basal levels (138 +/- 26 ng/g creatinine).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Because of a high percentage of glycolytic muscle fibers (compared to the muscle fiber type of the endurance-trained athlete), the lactic acidosis and heat generated from muscular activity is much greater in the sprint-trained athlete than in the endurance-trained athlete. The role of cocaine in producing seizures and increasing glycolysis, both of which produce lactic acidosis, is discussed. The hypothesis is presented that the elite athlete may be at greater risk of death than the general population from lactic acidosis produced as a result of cocaine-induced seizures.\r"

The observations of early arterial wall connective tissue changes and accompanying early lipid deposition show the importance of understanding cardiovascular risk factors in children. Since risk factors found in childhood are potentially predictive of adult coronary heart disease, methods for prevention of atherosclerosis should begin in children. Rational strategies should be directed to removing atherogenic forces that work in a child at high risk. Primary prevention of atherosclerosis has its maximal potential when begun before advanced irreversible lesions can occur. Consideration needs to be directed to how cardiovascular connective tissue changes and lipid and calcium deposition can be modulated in the injury and healing processes. It is important to recognize that adult coronary artery disease is really a major pediatric problem.\r"

Third are mechanical interactions between the heart and lungs, which are elastic structures sealed within an expandable thorax. In recent years, most attention has been focused on these mechanical interactions, but it is appropriate to consider also the other ways the heart and lungs interact.\r"

Rheumatoid factor was measured by a latex agglutination test, and thyroid microsomal and thyroglobulin antibodies were measured by a hemagglutination assay. Immunofluorescence assays were considered positive if antibodies were detected at a serum dilution of 1:20. All positive samples were retested at increasing dilutions until immunofluorescence or agglutination could not be detected. The control population consisted of 52 normal, healthy, ovulatory, and nonpregnant women. The study population consisted of 84 pregnant women, none of whom had a known autoimmune disorder. The mean ages of the two groups were 32 and 26 years, respectively. The frequency of autoantibody detection was not significantly different in comparing the study (46.2) and control groups (40.5). The results did not support the hypothesis that pregnancy has an effect on the induction or suppression of autoantibody production. Previous studies that suggested differences may have been influenced by the lack of a control group.\r"

However, an increased frequency of one allele (class 1) was observed among nonoverweight patients with gestational onset diabetes mellitus with elevated fasting plasma glucose levels compared with age-, race-, and parity-matched control subjects (p = 0.061). These data suggest that gestational onset diabetes mellitus is a heterogeneous disorder with respect to both genotypic and phenotypic characteristics, and that restriction fragment length polymorphisms near the insulin gene may serve as a molecular marker for susceptibility to gestational onset diabetes mellitus only in some women.\r"

However, methods of measurement and diagnostic criteria are controversial. We prospectively evaluated the reproducibility of amniotic fluid diameter measurement and studied various threshold definitions of oligohydramnios as predictors of small for gestational age fetuses or fetuses with low ponderal index values. An average of the vertical and two perpendicular horizontal diameters of the largest pocket of amniotic fluid was more reproducible than the maximum vertical pocket and better enabled a single observer to differentiate between patients. An average diameter of 10 mm was highly diagnostic of small for gestational age fetuses but was insufficiently sensitive (27%) to serve as a screening test. Although also of limited sensitivity (40%), an average diameter of approximately 30 mm was probably the best screening threshold. Reduced average diameter was significantly related to the occurrence of a ponderal index less than or equal to the tenth percentile for dates. Three of seven (43%) neonates with a ponderal index less than or equal to the tenth percentile and a birth weight greater than the tenth percentile for dates had a low average diameter, suggesting that reduced average amniotic fluid diameter may help to identify the malnourished fetus with birth weight greater than the tenth percentile for dates.\r"

In all women birth weight was predicted within 7 days of delivery. Of the 61 pregnancies, 49 (80%), 41 (67%), 30 (49%), and 17 (28%) weighed less than 1750, 1500, 1250, and 1000 gm, respectively; 14 published formulas were compared for accuracy in predicting birth weight in these four categories. The formulas with the smallest absolute mean percent errors incorporated head and abdominal circumferences and femur length. The formula of Weiner et al., derived from low birth weight infants, produced the smallest absolute mean percent error and SD, 10.9% +/- 7.9%; this error was further reduced to 7.7% +/- 6.5% in infants weighing less than 750 gm. These findings suggest that birth weight in the preterm fetus is best predicted by a formula targeted to such a population.\r"

Four groups of six subjects each were studied: (1) normal weight (within 10% ideal body weight) anovulatory, (2) obese (greater than 120% ideal body weight) anovulatory, (3) normal weight eumenorrheic, and (4) obese eumenorrheic. After dexamethasone suppression, human chorionic gonadotropin (2000 IU/1.5m2 body surface area intramuscularly) was administered to each subject. Serum testosterone levels were subsequently determined hourly for 17 hours. On a separate occasion, an oral glucose tolerance test was administered to five subjects from each group. Serum glucose and immunoreactive insulin levels were determined before and after the ingestion of a standard 100 gm glucose load. As a group, the anovulatory women had higher (p less than 0.05) basal testosterone levels (1005 +/- 97 pg/ml) than did the ovulatory women (241 +/- 21 pg/ml) (values +/- SE). Obesity per se was not associated with increased basal testosterone levels. Testosterone levels rose in response to human chorionic gonadotropin (p less than 0.005) only in obese anovulatory women, reached maximal levels after 3 hours, and subsequently remained stable. Basal immunoreactive insulin levels were elevated (p less than 0.05) only in obese anovulatory women (52.4 +/- 20 microU/ml) compared with obese eumenorrheic (8.7 +/- 1.0 microU/ml), normal weight anovulatory (5.8 +/- 2.4 microU/ml), and normal weight eumenorrheic (4.6 +/- 0.4 microU/ml) women. Similarly, maximal increases in immunoreactive insulin levels after glucose ingestion were significantly greater (p less than 0.01) in obese anovulatory women compared with other groups. Of note is the observation that maximal changes in testosterone observed within the first 3 hours after human chorionic gonadotropin and maximal changes in insulin were correlated (r = 0.91, p less than 0.01). These data suggest that (1) both insulin resistance and an abnormal acute response to human chorionic gonadotropin are seen only in obese anovulatory women and (2) the degree to which these two abnormalities are manifested is clearly correlated. The mechanism(s) responsible for this interrelationship, as well as the underlying cause(s) of these biochemical defects, remain to be elucidated.\r"

To study the effect of insulin on the ability of endometrium to aromatize androgens to estrogens, late proliferative endometrium was obtained from normally cycling women at the time of indicated surgery, separated into component glands and stroma, and grown to confluence. Separated gland and stromal cultures were incubated in triplicate with increasing insulin concentrations and epidermal growth factor. Aromatase activity was assayed by the production of tritiated water from tritium-labeled androstenedione. The activity was noted to increase proportionally with increasing concentrations of insulin greater than 10 U/ml, and the effect was specific. These data suggest the following conclusions: (1) Insulin stimulates aromatase activity in both endometrial glands and stroma; (2) hyperinsulinemia may predispose to endometrial neoplasia by enhancing endogenous endometrial estrogen production.\r"

  ".W": "Immunophenotypic analysis of paraffin-embedded tissues of lymphoproliferative disorders has been facilitated by recent developments of monoclonal antibodies that react with epitopes that survive histologic processing. Leukocyte common antigen (LCA) antibody has made a significant contribution to the immunocytochemical separation of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas from nonlymphoid neoplasms. However, a small percentage of lymphomas, particularly some large cell or immunoblastic B-cell tumors, will not label with LCA antibody. Other antibodies, directed against B lymphocytes, experience problems of specificity and a lack of sensitivity when applied to formalin-fixed specimens. The authors recently investigated a monoclonal antibody (L26) that demonstrates excellent specificity and sensitivity for B lymphocytes, and tumors derived from them, in formalin- and B5-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. The avidin-biotin peroxidase complex (ABC) technique was utilized for immunostaining 95 cases of malignant lymphoproliferative disorders and a variety of normal and neoplastic nonlymphoid tissues. When applied to sections of benign lymphoid tissue, the L26 antibody labeled germinal center cells, mantle zone and scattered interfollicular lymphocytes, but not histiocytes or plasma cells. L26 marked 100% (44/44) of the large cell and immunoblastic B-cell lymphomas, along with 1 case of pre-B cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. This included 8 cases that were LCA-negative. None of the T-cell lymphomas or plasma cell tumors studied demonstrated L26 immunostaining. No normal, benign, or neoplastic nonlymphoid tissues examined stained with this antibody. L26 successfully labels B lymphocytes and B-cell lymphomas in routinely processed tissues, often with greater sensitivity and intensity than LCA. This antibody should prove invaluable in the investigation of atypical lymphoid proliferations and the identification of B-cell derived lymphomas, when fresh or frozen tissue is unavailable for analysis.\r"

  ".W": "Amyloid deposition is a prominent feature of a number of brain disorders, in which amyloid fibrils are found within blood vessel walls, the neuropil (neuritic plaques), neurons (neurofibrillary tangles). These include Alzheimer's disease (AD), AD changes associated with Down's syndrome, neurologically asymptomatic amyloidosis, Parkinson dementia of Guam, hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis of Icelandic origin (HCHWA-I), hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis of Dutch origin (HCHWA-D), and sporadic cerebral amyloid angiopathy (SCAA). Recently it was shown that the amyloid deposits in AD, Parkinson dementia of Guam, and HCHWA-D are formed by a similar 4-kd polypeptide called beta-protein. Because the nature of the amyloid deposits in other types of cerebral amyloidosis is not known, we have conducted immunocytochemical studies on brains from autopsy cases of AD, HCHWA-D, SCAA and neurologically asymptomatic elderly individuals. Brains from two subjects without neurologic involvement were used as controls. Sections from these specimens were incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against 1) a synthetic peptide of 28 residues (anti-SP28), homologous to the NH2-terminal sequence of the beta-protein, 2) the main amyloid component of the HCHWA-I, a variant of cystatin C, and 3) purified fraction of neurofibrillary tangles. In all cases, anti-SP28 antibody specifically stained amyloid deposits in leptomeningeal and cortical vessels and neuritic plaques. These findings demonstrate that the amyloid deposits of SCAA and aged brains are composed of a protein antigenically similar to AD, HCHWA-D, and Parkinson dementia of Guam beta-protein, suggesting that all of these clinically and etiologically different morbid conditions are pathogenetically related. On this basis, they can be tentatively grouped as beta-protein deposition diseases. In addition, we found that HCHWA-D and SCAA vessels were mainly affected, while in AD parenchymal involvement predominates. These differences in the localization and extent of beta-protein deposits may account from the predominance of vascular complications in HCHWA-D and SCAA and of dementia in AD.\r"

However, the MtT/F4 tumor had significantly more prolactin (PRL)-secreting cells. Mammosomatotropic (MS) cells, which produced both PRL and GH, were identified in both normal and tumorous pituitaries with the RHPA and ICC. A combined procedure of RHPA followed by ICC staining on the same slide also revealed MS cells in both normal and tumorous pituitary cells, although the percentage of MS with this technique was less than with the other two methods. These results show that MS cells from a significant population of cells in the MtT/F4 tumor and that the RHPA and ICC can be used to study the regulation of this cell type.\r"

Forty-seven tumors expressed monotypic immunoglobulin, one or more B-lineage antigens, and Ia (HLA-DR) antigen. Proliferation centers expressed the T9 antigen and increased numbers of Ki-67-positive cells. One tumor was of T-cell origin, had a cytotoxic/suppressor cell phenotype, and showed anomalous loss of Leu-1 antigen. Immunophenotypic findings were correlated to the clinical presentation and morphologic features of each neoplasm. Sixteen tumors were associated with peripheral lymphocytosis (greater than 4000/cu mm), 13 biopsies were obtained from extranodal sites, 16 tumors had proliferation centers, and 11 neoplasms had plasmacytoid features. The authors found no absolute and few statistically significant immunologic differences between the B-cell tumors according to their clinical presentation or morphologic features. Tumors associated with peripheral lymphocytosis more commonly expressed the Leu-1 antigen (P less than 0.01) and IgD (P less than 0.01) and less frequently were stained by BA-2 (P less than 0.05) and OKT9 (P less than 0.05). Plasmacytoid neoplasms more frequently expressed the Tac (P less than 0.01) and T9 antigens (P less than 0.05), and all expressed kappa light chain (P less than 0.05). Extranodal neoplasms more commonly expressed IgM (P less than 0.01). In contrast to the markedly different clinical presentation and morphologic appearance these tumors may have, the immunologic data suggest that B-cell small lymphocytic neoplasms are relatively homogeneous. For an individual case, immunophenotype does not predict clinical presentation or morphologic features.\r"

Through the release of interleukin-1, (IL-1), monocyte/macrophages have been shown to induce the proliferation of mesangial cells and to stimulate the secretion of a glomerular basement membrane-degrading neutral proteinase. In addition, mesangial cells release a cytokine that expresses many of the biologic properties of monocyte IL-1, including stimulation of mesangial cell proliferation. Because many of the actions of IL-1 are mediated by the induction of prostanoid prostaglandin (PG) synthesis, the authors determined the effects of purified macrophage and mesangial IL-1 on the secretion of prostaglandin E (PGE), prostacyclin, and thromboxane. The results indicated that cycling MCs release primarily PGE in response to purified IL-1. The local release by either monocytes or mesangial cells of IL-1 during glomerular inflammation, with subsequent mesangial cell generation of vasodilatory PGE, may be responsible in part for the alterations in the glomerular microcirculation observed in these disorders.\r"

  ".W": "The authors investigated the ability of rat alveolar macrophages to acquire peroxidase activity in the course of pulmonary inflammation. Granulomatous pulmonary inflammation was induced in bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-immunized rats by intravenous injection of BCG in mineral oil. In contrast to normal alveolar macrophages, which are peroxidase-negative, alveolar macrophages lavaged from the BCG-treated rats showed significant peroxidase activity in large cytoplasmic inclusions compatible with internalized exogenous material. Alveolar macrophage uptake of intact peroxidase-positive neutrophils was also observed. Maximal numbers of peroxidase-positive alveolar macrophages were observed after the initial influx of neutrophils into the lungs, and peroxidase activity could be demonstrated in cell-free lavage fluid during the acute phase of lung injury. Normal alveolar macrophages acquired peroxidase activity after incubation with peritoneal exudate neutrophils, with purified soluble human myeloperoxidase, and with opsonized erythrocytes. It is concluded that alveolar macrophages acquire peroxidase activity from multiple sources during pulmonary inflammation. Internalization of peroxidase by the alveolar macrophage may serve to clear a potentially toxic enzyme(s) from the alveolar space and contribute to the resolution of pulmonary inflammation.\r"

The Genucom evaluation performed by an experienced examiner required 25 to 30 minutes for a 14 test bilateral examination. The instrument provided detailed graphical and tabular data of the test results. One hundred \"normal knees\" were examined in a series of seven Genucom tests. Normal \"laxity bands\" for both males and females were generated for a range of load applications for the seven tests. There was no significant difference observed between the male and female laxity distributions. However, a slightly lesser laxity was observed for the male population in general. A group of 38 subjects with 1 injured knee were assessed concurrently using clinical and instrument techniques. Comparisons were made for the 90 degrees anterior-posterior (AP) drawer, the 30 degrees AP drawer (Lachman), and the varus/valgus stress test. For the 90 degrees AP drawer test, 16 subjects were found clinically to have less than or equal to 5 mm of excess laxity based on comparison with the opposite normal knee. The instrumented measurement concurred in 10 cases. In the other six cases it was noted that laxity on the uninjured knee reached the maximum of the \"normal\" instrumented population, that is with higher than normal laxities. Fifteen subjects were clinically tested with greater than 5 mm of excess laxity. The instrumented test concurred in all but one.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Recently, more attention is being paid to the treatment of the articular surface defect in the young, active individual. Resurfacing or \"shell\" allografts are being considered as one of the alternatives for treatment. The immune response by the host may be the chief obstacle to the successful use of fresh osteoarticular allografts. Since proteins on the surfaces of allograft bone cells are considered to be the principal antigens eliciting the immune response, we hypothesized that mechanical masking of these cells by a biodegradeable blocking agent might prevent the immune response. Osteoarticular allografts of the distal femur were performed in rats and the cut surfaces of the graft were coated with cement before implantation. In a preliminary experiment, six biodegradeable cement materials were tried (bone wax, zinc polycarboxylate, collodion, fibrin adhesive, zinc oxide, and isobutyl-cyanoacrylate). Of these, the zinc oxide cement and isobutyl-cyanoacrylate were effective in inhibiting the immune response observed in control rat distal femur allografts. A second experiment was performed using nine rats with zinc oxide and nine rats with isobutyl-cyanoacrylate cements. These were compared with 20 control rats that had allografts without cement coating. Eighteen of the control rats (90%) developed an immune response, while only 22% (2/9) of the rats with zinc oxide coating and 33% (3/9) of the rats with isobutylcyanoacrylate developed an immune response. In a third experiment distal femur allografts were performed in 13 rats using only the liquid component of the zinc oxide cement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All patients had carotid bifurcation disease and were followed for an average of 46 months. The endpoint for follow-up was a transient ischemic attack or stroke. Patients were categorized according to degree of stenosis (greater or less than 75 percent) and morphologic plaque characteristics (calcified, dense, or soft). Patients with hemodynamically significant stenosis were at greater risk of transient ischemic attack or stroke than their counterparts with less than 75 percent stenosis. However, even patients with less than 75 percent stenosis were at risk if the plaque was less organized (dense or soft). Patients with hemodynamically significant stenosis and morphologically soft plaque were at the greatest risk of transient ischemic attack or stroke. Those patients with calcified plaque and less than 75 percent stenosis had the lowest risk of transient ischemic attack or stroke. Morphologic plaque characteristics, as well as degree of stenosis, is important in determining which patients are candidates for carotid endarterectomy.\r"

Under control conditions, blood pressure, heart rate, plasma noradrenaline, adrenaline, and renin activity did not differ between the two groups. Nifedipine, at a dose of 10 mg administered sublingually, lowered the blood pressure and increased the heart rate, plasma noradrenaline, and renin activity. The normotensive relatives of patients with essential hypertension did not differ in their responses from the normotensive subjects with no family history of hypertension, with the exception of plasma noradrenaline thirty minutes after nifedipine. These results provide evidence to suggest that there is no functional abnormality with increased dependency of vascular smooth muscle tone on calcium influx in the prehypertensive state.\r"

The current data, however, do not clearly identify any single abnormality in the autonomic nervous system that is ubiquitous in all asthmatic patients. Rather, it appears that bronchial hyperreactivity results from many factors and that distinct autonomic nervous system abnormalities may occur in individual subjects. Future studies of how autonomic control of airway function in asthma may be disordered should prove useful in gaining a better understanding of the pathophysiology of asthma and in designing new treatment modalities.\r"

Demonstration that newer agents lack these CNS effects requires quantitative and objective measurements that are sensitive enough to assess the psychomotor capabilities required for such activities as driving an automobile. These capabilities include extended attention span, vigilance, visual tracking, rapid information processing, and reaction time. We have used several psychomotor function tests to conduct two investigations assessing the CNS effects of cetirizine. In the first study, 12 healthy, atopic subjects received single oral doses of hydroxyzine 25 mg, cetirizine 10 mg and 20 mg, and placebo in a double-blind, four-way crossover study. Skin-wheal response to intradermal histamine, psychomotor effects, and serum concentrations of each drug were measured for 36 hours after each dose. The CNS effects were measured using critical flash-fusion frequency tests and Stroop word testing. Perceived feelings of drowsiness were measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS). In the second study, 15 healthy subjects received single oral doses of diphenhydramine 50 mg, cetirizine 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg, and placebo in a double-blind, five-way crossover study. Skin-wheal response to intradermal histamine, psychomotor effects, and serum concentrations of each drug were measured for 24 hours after each dose. The CNS effects were measured using digit-symbol substitution testing. \"Trails-B\" maze tracking, and an analyzer of driving performance that assessed reaction time and vigilance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The daily life of children with disabilities had less variety and a slower tempo, with more time being spent in dependent activities, quiet recreation, and personal care, and with less participation in social engagements, active recreation, household tasks, and activities away from home. Their activities were, however, more often associated with concurrent social input. Although statistically significant differences in activity were found, the size of differences were minor to moderate, except for indicators of dependence. Age was the covariate most strongly affecting activity. Results indicate similar developmental patterns for the two groups, but children with disabilities had less involvement with education and increased TV viewing with increasing age.\r"

  ".W": "The teratogenicity of ethanol has been well-documented during the past decade in clinical cases as well as animal models. It has become clear that, short of spontaneous abortion, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome represents the most serious consequence of sustained heavy drinking throughout pregnancy. The overall incidence of FAS is about 1-2/1000 live births, although it is considerably higher if one only considers alcoholic women who continue to drink during pregnancy. The incidence of Fetal Alcohol Effects (FAE) is much higher. Most clinical follow-up studies have failed to find significant improvement of intellectual functioning over time. Moreover, problems with attention, cognition, and perception have become apparent in children exposed to alcohol prenatally but without a clinical diagnosis of FAS. Animal models have demonstrated rather conclusively that ethanol is teratogenic in several species. The effect is dose-dependent and the type of malformation observed depends upon the stage of development when the exposure occurred. A single exposure in a high enough dose is sufficient to produce birth defects and decreased fetal weight in mice. Studies with rats have demonstrated behavioral defects similar to those seen clinically, including hyperactivity and deficiencies in response inhibition. Neuroanatomical reports confirm a structural defect in the hippocampus, as suggested by the behavioral deficits observed. Neurochemical correlates of impaired behavior have been inconsistent. With regard to mechanism of action, impaired placental transfer of essential nutrients has been confirmed by several laboratories, while the role of hypoxia, acetaldehyde, and prostaglandins remains to be proven conclusively. Any, or all, of these potential mechanisms may play a role in alcohol-induced teratogenesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The specificity of ethanol in relationship to other drugs with similar behavioral actions is also briefly reviewed. It is concluded that the ethanol molecule itself is primarily responsible for the behavioral effects but that other compounds may contribute to the effects. Ethanol is seen as being more unique than previously thought in that it has behavioral actions that are not the same as gaseous anesthetics.\r"

The effect of ethanol on these parameters was also studied. All parameters measured declined with time in the hormone-free cultures. In hormone-supplemented cultures, the DNA-content, the activity of glucokinase, pyruvate kinase, hexokinase and lactate dehydrogenase and the secretion of albumin was maintained at reasonable levels throughout the 13 days, whereas both the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase and the rate of ethanol oxidation fell significantly, although less than in hormone-free cultures. Addition of 50 mM ethanol to the hormone-supplemented culture medium caused a ca. 20% fall in the activity of glucokinase and pyruvate kinase and a 20% increase in alcohol dehydrogenase activity. No effect of ethanol was observed on the activity of hexokinase and lactate dehydrogenase or on the secretion of albumin.\r"

Chronic ethanol produced hypoglycaemia in diabetic mice but prevented insulin-provoked hypoglycaemia in normal mice. Insulin and ethanol had additive effects in diabetic mice. The hypoglycaemic effect of CET is not dependent upon insulin and can be explained by an increase in insulin-independent brain glucose uptake. Ethanol-induced hypoglycaemia and the changes in glucose uptake occur at relatively low blood levels of ethanol (4-20mM, 18-90mg%) and are rapidly reversible on withdrawal. Diabetic mice appear to be more sensitive to the effects of ethanol on glucoregulation.\r"

These MT changes parallelled changes in the Ac-CHO levels in the medium. In the Ac-CHO added medium, the MT cables exhibited change within 3 hours. In the Et-OH and 4-methyl pyrazole added medium, Et-OH and Ac-CHO levels, and MT cables did not change during a 24 hour observation period. A decrease in hepatic MT was also confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. These results indicated that acute administration of Et-OH resulted in a decrease of hepatic MT. However, the effect was attributable to Ac-CHO and not to Et-OH itself.\r"

Therefore, maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), human placental lactogen (HPL) and pregnancy specific beta-1-glycoprotein (SP 1) were followed in 35 pregnant problem drinkers and 14 abstinent control women throughout pregnancy. Thirteen women gave birth to infants with FAS. These women had low levels of AFP and SP 1, but the levels of HPL were normal. Low AFP predicted FAS correctly in 59% with a relative risk of 2.46. Low SP 1 predicted FAS in 56% of the cases with FAS, and a relative risk was 3.29. HPL assay was useless in the detection of FAS. Low AFP and SP 1 may reflect primary or secondary effects of ethanol abuse in pregnancy and appear useful in predicting FAS. These tests can be recommended for routine use in the antenatal care of drinking women.\r"

Although heavy drinkers have a higher rate, the majority of work problems occur in light or moderate drinkers as these are more numerous.

Due to extrapolation from the present limited data, there are great difficulties in calculating economic costs; estimates have varied from pounds 60 million to pounds 2 billion a year. In view of the human and economic costs a number of bodies are now making efforts to encourage alcohol policies in the workplace. Further research is required on many aspects of the problem.\r"

Nevertheless, this trial has confirmed the beneficial effect of a reduction in the rate of alcohol consumption on alcoholic liver disease. Apart from clinical evidence of a higher rate of alcohol consumption by patients receiving the active drug during the trial, no adverse side-effects were identified and for this reason, it is suggested that a further trial should be considered with the daily dosage so far used in man (20 mg/kg) increased toward that (100 mg/kg) employed with benefit in animal experiments.\r"

At least three months after implant a double blind randomised short and long term crossover study was performed in ten patients with complete heart block: block was present at rest and during exercise on a modified Bruce protocol. Symptoms were assessed on a visual analogue scale and exercise capacity (maximal oxygen consumption and anaerobic threshold) was measured during rate responsive (peak rate 125/min) and conventional fixed rate (VVI) pacing (70/min). One month after randomisation treadmill exercise was performed. The mode was then changed to the other pacing mode and exercise was repeated three hours later. After another month the process was repeated but in the reverse order. During long term assessment there was subjective improvement in the sensation of breathlessness with rate responsive pacing. During short term assessment maximal oxygen consumption increased and the benefit was maintained during long term rate responsive compared with long term VVI pacing; oxygen consumption at the anaerobic threshold was similarly improved. Activity detecting rate responsive pacing is better than fixed rate ventricular pacing in patients with complete atrioventricular block.\r"

Monoclonal antibody P2, which appeared most suitable for immunohistology, is a mouse monoclonal antibody of IgG1 subtype, specific for the precursor enzyme plasminogen and for the high molecular weight chain of the active enzyme, plasmin. Immunofluorescence analysis of normal human epidermis revealed that reactivity with P2 was confined to the basal cell layer. In psoriatic lesions, however, this regional organization was not found. Immunoreactivity in this case was scattered throughout all the hyperproliferating cell layers, which is taken as evidence for an altered distribution of PG-P in psoriatic lesions. In psoriasis other components of the PA/PG-P system have previously been found to be altered. In this context our findings add to the hypothesis that this system may be involved in the pathology or the pathogenesis of psoriatic lesions.\r"

Cardiac output was measured by Doppler and cross-sectional echocardiography at the aortic, pulmonary and mitral valves. Cardiac chamber size and ventricular function were investigated by M-mode echocardiography. Flow measurements at the three intracardiac sites correlated closely. Cardiac output fell from a mean of 7.42 l/min at 38 weeks to 4.96 l/min at 24 weeks after delivery, a fall of 33%. Most of this decrease (28%) had occurred by 2 weeks. This was associated with a 20% reduction in heart rate and an 18% reduction in stroke volume. By 2 weeks after delivery there was a significant decrease in left atrial dimension and left ventricular end-diastolic dimension. Left ventricular wall thickness and mass declined throughout the period of study as did aortic, pulmonary and mitral valve areas. M-mode derived indices of myocardial contractility were all significantly reduced by 2 weeks and thereafter showed no further change. No haemodynamic differences were found between lactating and non-lactating mothers.\r"

  ".W": "A competitive inhibitor of the action of oxytocin on the uterus, 1-deamino-2-D-Tyr-(OEt)-4-Thr-8-Orn-oxytocin, was studied for the first time in 13 patients with established, uncomplicated premature labour. Intravenous infusion of 10-100 micrograms/min of the analogue was given for 1-10 h and the effect was monitored by external cardiotocography. In all women an inhibition of uterine activity was observed, and in the majority of patients infused with 25 micrograms/min and a total dose of about 5 mg or more of the drug total inhibition of uterine contractions was achieved. There were no effects on the maternal and fetal pulse rates, nor were there any other side-effects. The results of this preliminary study support the concept of an increased concentration of uterine oxytocin receptors being aetiologically important in uncomplicated premature labour. They also suggest that the present oxytocin antagonist could be an interesting therapeutic alternative in the condition, primarily because of the marked selectivity of its effect.\r"

Samples from five normal women, six with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and 10 with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) were tested. A small population of MoAb 3.9 positive and only occasional MoAb E11 positive macrophages were found in the normal cervix. In HPV infection and CIN there was a significant infiltration of MoAb 3.9 positive and MoAb E11 positive macrophages in both the epithelium and the stroma. The pattern of infiltration in these groups of women suggests that these macrophages were most likely to be functioning as the first line of defence against the spread of the virus infection, either through a direct anti-virus mechanism or non-specific phagocytosis.\r"

  ".U": "88107499\r", 
  ".W": "Epidemiological investigation of the incidence and aetiology of hydatidiform mole (HM) is receiving increasing attention. Recent, population-based studies suggest that earlier reports of a very high incidence of HM in Asia, Africa and South-Central America may have been exaggerated, due primarily to selection bias in patients studied at university hospitals. Japanese population studies indicate a two-fold higher rate of HM compared with Caucasian rates but Chinese rates appear to be similar. Population studies presently available suggest a worldwide range of HM somewhere between 0.5 and 2.5/1000 pregnancies. When deliveries form the rate denominator the rates are somewhat higher, depending primarily on the national rate of induced abortions. The independent effects on incidence of geographic locale, ethnicity and socio-cultural factors have not been adequately disentangled although the genetic studies suggest ethnicity might be the predominant variable. Maternal age is the most consistently demonstrated risk factor; teenagers and, especially, women over age 35 being at increased risk. The independent effects of paternal age and pregnancy history are not established. Women with a history of one HM seem to have a ten-fold risk of repeat HM compared with women who have no history of HM. Aetiological studies have not revealed any environmental risk factor for which there is unequivocal agreement about its influence on HM. New case-control studies of HM aetiology must classify HM according to genetic aetiology. Cohort studies are required to explore more fully the relation of HM to malignant sequelae.\r"

To study the effect of uterine contractions before labour on uterine blood flow, simultaneous Doppler recordings from branches of the uterine artery and external tocodynamometry were made in seven women during the last trimester. Velocities fell during 18 of the 20 contractions studied (median 35%, range 19-71%). Extrapolating from labour contractions, this corresponds to a pressure increase of 30-40 mmHg.

The production of PGI2, and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha (the stable metabolite of PGI2), was higher in both veins and arteries as the distance from the placenta at which the vessels were sampled was increased. A similar correlation between production by venous rings and distance from the placenta was observed for TXB2, but there was no apparent gradient of TXB2 production by the samples of arterial rings. No statistically significant variations were discernible in the ratio of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha:TXB2 (approximately 50 in the veins and approximately 20 in the arteries) in relation to the sampling distance. The significance of these high ratios is discussed in relation to umbilical blood flow and fetal well-being and development.\r"

Ovarian function was monitored by regular pelvic ultrasonography and urinalysis over a period of nine cycles. During the first three cycles after hormone implantation, follicular development continued in almost half the study group, but only one of the women in each treatment group showed signs of follicular rupture and luteinization. By the sixth cycle, over half the women given the lower dose of oestradiol were developing follicles, including a large functional cyst in one, but none of them ovulated. A further implant given early in the seventh cycle was associated with ovarian suppression in all cases. Both doses of implant elevated the excretion of oestrone-3-glucuronide compared to pretreatment. The contraceptive and therapeutic implications of these results are discussed.\r"

Forty-seven patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder and six controls were studied. Cryostat sections were stained with a panel of 10 biotinylated lectins by means of the avidin-biotin-peroxidase technique. Sixteen tumours were also studied after conventional formalin fixation and paraffin embedding. In general, staining by lectins of tumours was more intense than staining of control urothelium and staining of tumours invading bladder muscle was greater than that of superficial tumours (both P less than 0.001). A small but statistically significant diminution of staining was observed after formalin fixation and paraffin embedding (P less than 0.05). Four lectins--Bandeiraea simplicifolia (P less than 0.01), Vicia villosa (P less than 0.01), peanut agglutinin (P less than 0.001) and soyabean agglutinin (P less than 0.001) stained invasive tumours more frequently than superficial tumours in frozen sections. Thus, increased binding of certain lectins was found in human transitional cell tumours and correlated with muscle invasion and poor differentiation.\r"

On the other hand, anal dilatation was not associated with any significant change in rectal emptying or anal pressure. Pre-operative anal pressures during attempted defaecation in patients who achieved a good result after anorectal myectomy were significantly higher than those that did not (median, 136 (range, 120-208) versus 114 (79-129) cmH2O, P less than 0.025). Patients having a good result after anorectal myectomy had a significantly shorter history of constipation (median, 4 (range, 2-14) versus 38 (4-72) years, P less than 0.01) and normal colonic transit (median, 100 (range, 4-100) versus 10 (0-90) years, P less than 0.05) compared with those who had no benefit after operation.\r"

  ".W": "Recent advances in knowledge, and controversy, concerning cutaneous mechanoreception are reviewed. In particular, the question of perceptive specificity is discussed in the light of new experimental approaches, namely microneurography and microstimulation of identified tactile units from the glabrous skin of the human hand. Additional data are also presented. It is concluded that the human brain has an exquisite capacity to detect, localize, delineate, and classify sensations from the input of individual tactile units in the glabrous skin of the hand. The physiological specificity of low-threshold mechanoreceptors in the hand, which has been well documented in previous studies, can now be linked to distinct attributes of very simple tactile sensations which subjects report when a single afferent is stimulated electrically through an intraneural microelectrode. This conclusion does not conflict with the concept that the brain normally makes use of temporal and spatial patterns of impulses from a large number of receptors of various types to form more complex tactile percepts, such as in the recognition of texture, but the microstimulation data demonstrate that particular patterns of nerve impulses are not a necessary determinant of the subjective quality attribute of a simple tactile sensation. On the contrary, the sensations elicited by a train of impulses in a single afferent unit are remarkably distinct and well characterized in a number of respects. A further conclusion is that the afferent inputs are processed differently in tactile subsystems. This observation warrants caution in generalizing results from one system into a common theory of the origin of sensory modality.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, cortisol and hGH were measured in burn patients (mean burn surface area 21 per cent) treated or not with ornithine alpha-ketoglutarate (OKG). An increase in basal values of glucose, insulin, C-peptide and cortisol was demonstrated in both groups, whereas hGH values diminished. OKG modified neither insulin nor hGH values 24 h after its enteral administration nor insulin levels within the first 4 h after intake. On the other hand, 60 min after enteral nutrition was restarted the hyperglycaemia observed in untreated subjects was reduced by OKG whereas a hyperinsulinism was observed in both groups. These results suggest that: (i) the anticatabolic/anabolic action of OKG in burn patients is not mediated by insulin or hGH, (ii) OKG probably induces an increase in glucose tolerance in burn patients, in whom there is a state of insulin resistance. The mechanism of this action requires further study.\r"

The drug was administered as a 2% suspension twice daily for 1 week to one eye in 10 subjects. Ten other subjects, serving as controls, received a placebo drop to one eye on the same schedule. Subjects and examiners were unaware of whether the drug or placebo was being used. IOP was measured before the study began and twice daily on days 1, 2, 4 and 8 of the study. The drug had no significant effect on IOP. The most likely explanation is failure of an adequate concentration of the drug to reach the ciliary body.\r"

Nineteen cases of adult epiglottitis were analysed retrospectively. In 53% of the patients, the symptoms were present for less than 24 h prior to hospitalization. Sore throat and dysphagia were invariably present. Three patients presented with stridor and 2 with complete airway obstruction. Throat cultures from 5 patients grew beta-haemolytic streptococci and from 2 Haemophilus influenzae type B was grown. Two tracheotomies and 1 nasotracheal intubation were performed. One death occurred. It is emphasized that any adult with an acute sore throat and dysphagia should undergo indirect laryngoscopy and that blood cultures should always be part of the routine bacteriological investigation. Cooperation and understanding among otolaryngologists and anaesthesiologists is of paramount importance in the management of acute adult epiglottitis, as nasotracheal intubation and cricothyroidotomy appear to be the methods of choice in securing an airway. Ampicillin and chloramphenicol are recommended in the medical treatment.\r"

  ".W": "A double-blind parallel group study was undertaken during May and June 1985 to compare the effect of nedocromil sodium (1% nasal spray) and placebo, taken twice daily, in relieving the symptoms of rhinitis caused by birch pollen. Two centres were involved. The 54 patients studied had a history of rhinitis in 2 previous birch pollen seasons and positive skin tests to birch pollen. Patients were treated for 4 weeks, but to compare the effects of the 2 treatments the peak pollen periods were used. For dairy card symptoms, results in the 2 centres differed: in Tampere, there were trends in favour of nedocromil sodium with respect to itching (P = 0.04, sneezing (P = 0.06) and total symptoms (P = 0.09); in Oulu no significant differences were seen. Nasal peak expiratory flow rates were slightly better in the nedocromil sodium group. In respect of antihistamine usage, results in the 2 centres were similar and significantly more were used in the placebo group (P less than 0.01). At the end of the trial, both the patients' and the investigators' opinions of treatment effect favoured nedocromil sodium. There were no serious side effects. The results suggest that nedocromil sodium 1% nasal spray, when given twice daily, is effective in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis.\r"

  ".W": "To clarify the significance of the parameters which might indicate the abnormalities in the kidney, urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), urinary total protein (TP), urinary beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2MG) and serum NAG were determined in 61 type 1 diabetics who had neither retinopathy nor macroalbuminuria (negative albuminuria by Albustix), and in 19 age, sex-matched nondiabetic subjects. Urinary NAG, urinary TP and serum NAG levels were significantly elevated in the diabetics compared with the nondiabetic subjects, even though in the diabetics, whose duration of diabetes was not longer than 2.5 years. The relationships between these parameters and glycemic indices at different periods were studied in diabetics. Urinary NAG was correlated the strongest with the mean blood glucose level over the 7 days before the collection of urine (r = 0.47) among the 5 glycemic indices. On the other hand, urinary TP and urinary beta 2MG were correlated the strongest with the urinary glucose at the time of collection of urine (r = 0.77 and r = 0.37, respectively) among the 5 glycemic indices. No correlation of urinary NAG, urinary TP or urinary beta 2MG with stable HbA1 was observed. On the multiple regression analysis, 32% of the changes in urinary NAG, 61% of urinary TP, 19% of urinary beta 2MG and 20% of serum NAG were explained merely by the blood glucose levels, respectively. No relationship was observed among each parameter and duration of diabetes, insulin dose, urinary excretion of C-peptide or lipid levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In 100 urine specimens from normal test persons, patients with infections of the lower urinary tract, with chronic pyelonephritis and glomerulonephritis were studied. The adhesion of strains of Escherichia coli to human uroepithelial cells depended on the concentration of single urinary factors. While increased concentrations of urea and creatinine favored the adhesion process, a statistically significant negative influence was found with regard to potassium, immunoglobulins and pH value. Considering the multifactorial effects of the urinary constituents, we found in a multivariate comparison that none of the studied physiological features alone exerts a fundamental influence upon adhesion, but in their entirety they determine the environmental conditions for the adhesion of bacteria to cells in the urine.\r"

It is not certain that the net effect of administration of this agent to patients with metabolic acidosis is positive, other than when given as replacement for renal or gastrointestinal bicarbonate losses. 2. Adequate oxygenation and ventilation must be ensured before it is given. 3. Profound fluctuations in blood pressure and cerebral blood flow, intracranial bleeds, and compromise of oxygen delivery to tissues all have been found to be possible adverse effects of sodium bicarbonate infusion. Because hyperosmolarity and sodium content are important factors, the commercially prepared solutions (0.9 or 1M) should be diluted 1:2 to 1:4 with water and given over not less than several minutes--if it is to be given at all. 4. Current recommendations for dose, dilution, and rate of administration, including those mentioned above, are largely arbitrary. If sodium bicarbonate were a newly proposed treatment for hypoxic metabolic acidosis, one would recommend that carefully conducted prospective laboratory and clinical trials be done before giving it to sick patients. As it is in widespread use, one can only reiterate that if it is to be given, it should be used with extreme caution.\r"
