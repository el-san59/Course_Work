The selective loss of anterior CA1 neurons of the hippocampus 4 days after 5 minutes of bilateral ischemia was complete in greater than 90% of the gerbils examined. We tested 11 agents for their ability to protect against neuronal loss. Only those agents that were associated with the GABAergic system exhibited protection and only when administered before the ischemic insult. The possibility that delayed neuronal death is the result of a primary defect in inhibitory neurotransmission is considered.\r"

We recently encountered three patients with the abrupt onset of pure motor hemiparesis as the initial manifestation of primary or metastatic brain tumor. In each patient, early computed tomography demonstrated a nonhemorrhagic, right frontal, enhancing mass lesion. While the mechanism whereby brain tumor may present abruptly and simulate a stroke remains uncertain, these cases illustrate that pure motor hemiparesis can be the initial symptom of intracranial tumor. Early computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is suggested for all patients who present acutely with pure motor hemiparesis.\r"

The scheme is based on the reaction patterns obtained by immunoblotting the normal and abnormal sialoglycoproteins (SGPs) found in these cells with several murine monoclonal antibodies that recognize different epitopes on alpha-SGP (Glycophorin A). The abnormal alpha found in MiI and MiII cells is easily identified with these antibodies, as is the abnormal alpha-delta SGP found in MiV cells. Certain alpha-SGP antibodies recognize epitopes on the abnormal SGPs found in MiIII, MiIV, and MiVI cells, although the mode of inheritance of these abnormal SGPs suggests that they are related to delta-SGP (Glycophorin B). Antibody R18 reacts with the abnormal SGP of MiIII cells but not that of MiIV or MiVI cells, whereas antibody BRIC 119 reacts with MiIII, MiIV, and MiVI cells. None of the abnormal components in these three cell classes react with antibody R10 or with an antibody (BRIC 163) that recognizes an epitope on the cytoplasmic portion of alpha-SGP. The immunostaining of membranes from persons heterozygous for the MiVII and MiVIII classes revealed patterns identical to those of normal red cell membranes. However, antibody R18 did not react with any of the SGP components of homozygous MiVII cells.\r"

Among the 911 nonduplicate pretransfusion specimens from recipients without a clinical history of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex (ARC), the overall prevalence of antibody to HIV was 2.9 percent (5.2% among males and 0.6% among females; p = 0.00002). If recipients in specifically defined or possible high-risk groups (n = 348) were excluded, a seropositivity rate of 1.8 percent (10/563) was detected, with all the positives occurring in men (10/242, 4.1%) and none in women (0/321, 0%). This demonstrated prevalence of HIV infection among blood product recipients in San Francisco before transfusion was substantially higher than the known 0.02 to 0.04 percent prevalence in the donor population. Therefore, the population of women without known risk for AIDS is the best in which to assess the risk of HIV infection in patients who are currently receiving seronegative blood transfusions.\r"

There were side effects during 612 (12%) of the 5235 procedures done, involving 252 (40%) of the 627 patients treated. The most common reactions were fever, chills, urticaria, muscle cramps, or paresthesias; these reactions were encountered more frequently when plasma was used in the replacement fluid. Most reactions had little or no clinical significance. However, there were 28 severe complications, including one cardiac arrest and two respiratory arrests. Five late deaths occurred, but these were not related directly to PE. Although PE is relatively safe, life-threatening reactions do occur, and patients require careful observation during the procedure.\r"

  ".W": "The utility of prenatal testing of maternal serum for platelet-reactive antibody was assessed in 25 women at risk of delivering infants with neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (NAT). Seventeen women were incompatible with their husbands for the PlA1 antigen and three for Baka; in five families, no demonstrable platelet-specific antigen incompatibility was found. Analysis of the clinical outcome demonstrated that women with platelet-specific antibody detectable in any of the assays at any time during gestation were at risk of delivering thrombocytopenic infants (neonatal platelet count 31,250/microliters if mother did have antibody, as compared with 138,750/microliters if she did not; p less than 0.005). When only PlA1-incompatible pregnancies were examined, this association remained significant (mean neonatal platelet count in infants exposed to anti-PlA1, 34,285/microliters; that in infants not so exposed, 243,000/microliters; p less than 0.001). Changes in antibody strength throughout pregnancy did not correlate with the severity of NAT. The combination of the antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the indirect immunofluorescence test appeared to be most sensitive in detecting relevant platelet-specific alloantibodies. It is concluded that the detection of platelet-specific alloantibody in maternal serum in pregnancies at risk for NAT predicts moderate to severe NAT. However, the failure to detect such antibody does not always predict a normal neonatal platelet count.\r"

  ".U": "89146835\r", 
  ".W": "Calcium is an intermediate messenger between platelet stimuli and platelet response. Published studies have shown that the decreased ability of platelets to control calcium flux during long-term storage leads to platelet senility. Platelet metabolism might be more efficient during storage if pharmacologic agents that limit calcium movement were incorporated into the platelet concentrate storage solution. This hypothesis was tested by storing platelets with the calcium channel blocker, diltiazem, or with a prostaglandin B1 derivative, PGBx. During a 15-day storage period, platelets incubated with either diltiazem or PGBx showed improved function, as measured by aggregation, as compared to control platelets. The PGBx -enhanced platelet function during storage was accompanied by a significant decrease in glucose and an increase in adenosine triphospate concentrations. Platelet function after storage with PGBx improved in spite of significantly lower pH levels of the platelet concentrates at all time points tested. These studies suggest that the maintenance of calcium ion homeostasis during long-term platelet storage is important to in vitro platelet function even if the Ca2+ balance is maintained at the expense of pH and the glucose concentrations.\r"

As compared with the original PVC bag, this bag has increased gas permeability by its reduced film thickness, larger surface area (400 ml capacity), and more porous label. The oxygen permeability coefficient, K(O2), of the new container was measured to be 655 nmol per min per atm. On the basis of previous studies relating the K(O2) to the maximal platelet count, it was predicted that this maximal count would be in the range of 7.9 to 8.9 X 10(10) platelets. This prediction was confirmed by carrying out 58 studies measuring pH, pO2, and platelet count on platelet concentrates (PCs) stored for up to 7 days. After 5 days of storage all PCs with counts above 8.0 x 10(10) had pH less than or equal to 7.0, whereas those with counts below 8.0 x 10(10) had pH greater than or equal to 7.0. Six units (10%) with counts above 9.0 X 10(10) had pH levels of 6.5 or below. Thirteen of the PCs underwent extensive in vitro testing of platelet function during 7 days of storage. No significant differences were found in pH, ATP content, and decrease in platelet count, as compared with studies (n = 22) using PCs stored in polyolefin containers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

As with intra-umbilical cord transfusion, the procedure has been described as having a high risk of complication characterized by bradycardia and cardiac-arrest. Intra-coronary hyperkalemia was suspected as being a major contributing factor towards the complications experienced, particularly by the intra-cardiac delivery. The procedure is warranted, however, in cases where intra-umbilical cord transfusion is not possible. Therefore, studies comparing various methods of preparing packed cells for intravascular transfusion were initiated. The plasma potassium levels of gravity sedimented packed cells and saline washed red cells resuspended in either Ringer's lactate, pooled donor plasma or saline were measured. Products of saline washed/resuspended packed red cells transfused within 2 hours of preparation were found to have low potassium levels while exposing the fetus to minimal risk of transfusion transmitted infection and were therefore selected to be the most suitable product. Using this product, a significant decrease in the incidence of severe bradycardia resulting in cardiac-arrest, following intravascular transfusion (32 procedures) was observed.\r"

During a 25-month study, the rates of both false-positive and false-negative IS crossmatch results were evaluated, and the sensitivity and specificity of the IS crossmatch were determined. During the study period, 53,656 IS crossmatches were performed for patients without significant RBC antibodies. Fifty-five patients had positive IS crossmatches, and no false-negative reactions were found. In tests of 55 patients with positive IS crossmatches, 77 false-positive and 5 true-positive reactions were noted. The causes of the false-positive reactions were rouleaux (36 patients), cold-reactive antibodies (8 patients), a combination of rouleaux and cold-reactive antibodies (2 patients), fibrin clot (1 patient), and undetermined (3 patients). The sensitivity and specificity of the IS crossmatch were 100 and 99.86 percent, respectively. Laboratory personnel should be aware that the IS crossmatch may have false-positive or false-negative results, and they should develop written protocols to distinguish quickly between true-positive and false-positive reactions.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the prognostic significance of hypercalcemia associated with renal cell carcinoma and the efficacy of different treatment modalities. Twenty-seven of 160 (16.8%) patients with renal cell carcinoma were found to have tumor-induced hypercalcemia: 24 had Stage IV disease, 1 Stage III disease, and 2 Stage I disease. There was no evidence of bone metastasis in 13 of 27 (48%) patients. A total of 89 episodes of acute hypercalcemia were treated: 36 episodes resulted in a complete response ([CR] calcium levels returning to normal), 24 partial response ([PR] calcium decrease greater than 1 mg/dL, but above normal) and 29 negligible response ([NR] calcium decrease less than 1 mg/dL) to treatment modalities used. One patient with Stage I disease and 3 with Stage IV disease underwent nephrectomies resulting in 2 CR and 1 PR. There was a complete response (CR) to mithramycin in 7 of 10 (70%) acute hypercalcemic episodes, to furosemide and mithramycin in 12 of 20 (60%), to steroids or furosemide and steroids in 3 of 7 (43%), to hydration in 4 of 13 (31%), and to furosemide in 7 of 25 (28%). The response rates to phosphates, indomethacin, and calcitonin were low but involved a small number of patients. Survival in 24 patients with Stage IV disease was 5-239 days (av 87.3 days). There was essentially no survival difference between patients who had an initial calcium elevation less than or greater than 13 mg/dL. We conclude that mithramycin is more effective in controlling acute hypercalcemia secondary to renal cell carcinoma than furosemide or hydration. Steroids appear to be effective but our experience was limited. Surprisingly, the degree of calcium elevation did not show a significant correlation with survival.\r"

  ".W": "Recently we treated 54 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer: 8 had Stage A disease, 13 had Stage B1, 32 Stage B2, and 1 Stage C. Fifty of these patients underwent bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy and retropubic radical prostatectomy, while the other 4 patients underwent bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy only. Pathologic staging revealed pelvic lymph node metastases in 12 patients. We reviewed these 12 Stage D1 cases to see whether or not the intraprostatic tumor location influenced the locoregional metastatic nodal pattern. We found that metastases occurred ipsilaterally in 5 cases, while the other 7 patients experienced bilateral pelvic involvement. We failed to find any case in which contralateral nodal involvement occurred without the tumor also involving the pelvic lymph nodes ipsilateral to the intraprostatic tumor. The data suggest that it would be reasonable to perform pelvic lymphadenectomy only on the same side of the prostatic lesion. This modified approach potentially could reduce morbidity and cost to the patient.\r"

Primary suturing of the rupture was performed in 65 patients, and catheter drainage alone without suturing of the rupture was performed in 34. The incidence of blunt trauma causing the rupture of gross hematuria on admission, and of associated injuries was similar in both groups. There was a higher incidence of women older than sixty years in the group managed by catheter drainage alone, and a higher incidence of laparotomy for associated intra-abdominal injuries and a higher mortality rate in the group treated by primary suturing. There were three early complications in the group treated by suturing (hematuria with clot retention 2, sepsis contributing to death 1) and four early complications in the conservatively treated group (hematuria with clot retention 1, pseudodiverticulum with bone spike in its floor 1, persistent urinary fistula 1, and sepsis contributing to death 1). There were two late complications in 42 patients followed in the group treated by suturing (urethral stricture 1, frequency and dysuria 1), and three late complications in 14 patients followed in the conservatively treated group (hyperreflexic bladder 2, urethral stricture and vesical calculi 1). Catheter drainage alone for extraperitoneal rupture from external trauma was simple, quick to perform, and appealing in the multiple-injured patient. Although the early and late complication rates were higher in the conservatively managed group, there was no statistically significant difference from the group treated by primary suturing.\r"

The simplicity of design has dispensed with the need for more costly and conventional instrumentation (e.g., optical urethrotome, Albarron lever) at a fraction of the cost. The urologist can not only inspect the lower urinary tract (Cf fiberscopes) but also perform endoscopic procedures short of a full transurethral prostatectomy with maximum patient comfort.\r"

Two of the treated patients had improvement in uroflow and experienced stabilization of clinical symptoms. Two had no significant change in uroflow and required prostatectomy within the observation period. One required prostatectomy soon after dilatation. One of the 3 patients in the control group required prostatectomy in the two-year follow-up period and the other 2 continue to have obstructive symptoms. Although dilatation of the prostatic urethra by balloon may relieve some patients of urinary outflow obstruction due to BPH, it appears that a 36F balloon dilator does not produce dramatic or consistent results, and the effects of larger balloons should be evaluated.\r"

C3H/He mice were transplanted subcutaneously in the hind limb with 2.5 X 10(5) tumor cells. One day after transplantation, mice were randomized into groups to receive saline (control), PDT, CP 25 micrograms, CP 250 micrograms, CP 25 micrograms + PDT, and CP 250 micrograms + PDT. PDT was administered by intraperitoneal (IP) injection of Hpd (12.5 micrograms/g body weight), followed twenty-four hours later by photoirradiation. CP was given intralesionally at the same time as IP injection of Hpd (24 hours before photoirradiation). A low dose of CP (25 micrograms) was shown to enhance the effect of PDT while PDT reduced the benefit obtained with high dose of CP (250 micrograms). In a second series of experiments, CP (250 micrograms) treatment after photoirradiation was shown to give significantly greater benefit than CP treatment before photoirradiation. The study thus indicates that the effectiveness of combined immunophototherapy is dependent on the sequence of the combination and its intricate relationship with the dosage of CP. The enhancement of PDT by low dose of CP in this model suggests the usefulness of this combined immunophototherapy in enhancing tumor control and in lessening deleterious side effects.\r"

The incidence of exercise-induced ST segment depression greater than or equal to 1 mm was significantly greater in patients with multivessel versus single-vessel disease (27% versus 14%; p less than 0.005) and in patients with multivessel coronary disease who had incomplete versus complete revascularization (36% versus 10%; p less than 0.001). An abnormal exercise ECG result was associated with a significantly increased risk of cardiac events in patients with multivessel disease but not in patients with single-vessel disease. Exercise-induced angina occurred in a small and similar proportion of patients with single and multivessel coronary disease (8% versus 12%). The presence of exercise-induced angina was associated with a higher incidence of follow-up cardiac events in patients with multivessel disease and incomplete revascularization (52% versus 33%; p less than 0.05). Exercise duration was significantly less in patients with multivessel disease who had a subsequent cardiac event compared with that in patients who did not have such an event (458 +/- 168 versus 519 +/- 156 seconds; p = 0.01). Thus an abnormal exercise ECG finding within 1 month of successful coronary angioplasty is predictive of subsequent cardiac events in patients who have multivessel disease. The prognostic content of the test might be further improved if the test were performed several months after the procedure when the risk of restenosis is greatest.\r"

Fourteen pigs underwent coronary artery occlusion for 1 hour followed by 2 hours of reperfusion. In seven animals uncontrolled reperfusion was achieved by complete release of the arterial occlusion resulting in hyperemic flow. In seven other animals coronary flow during reperfusion was controlled at baseline levels eliminating hyperemic flow. Our results show that controlled reperfusion lessens end-diastolic wall thickness, reduces myocardial calcium deposition, increases the rate of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, and preserves cellular high-energy phosphate stores in the ischemic-reperfused myocardium when compared to the uncontrolled reperfusion state. These data suggest that the magnitude of flow at an early stage of reperfusion is one of the important determinants in the outcome of ischemic myocardium.\r"

The relation of infarct size to the major determinants of infarct size was analyzed by uni- and multilinear regressions. Seven control dogs had ventricular fibrillation at reperfusion compared to one dog with leukopenia. In the group with leukopenia the mean infarct size was smaller (31.1 +/- 5.8% of area at risk) than in the control group (47.7 +/- 2.9, p = 0.02). In addition, the two multiple linear regression equations were significantly different (p = 0.01). Myocardial blood flow to the central ischemic zone did not change significantly between 20 and 120 minutes of ischemia in the control dogs (n = 12; subendocardial = 0.08 +/- 0.03 vs 0.07 +/- 0.03 ml/min/gm; subepicardial = 0.20 +/- 0.07 vs 0.20 +/- 0.05 ml/min/gm) and in the dogs with leukopenia (n = 12; 0.07 +/- 0.02 vs 0.07 +/- 0.02 ml/min/gm and 0.15 +/- 0.004 vs 0.18 +/- 0.04 ml/min/gm). A similar reduction in myocardial blood flow was observed after 6 hours of reperfusion in the control dogs (0.34 +/- 0.07 ml/min/gm vs 1.02 +/- 0.11 at baseline, p less than 0.01) and in the dogs with leukopenia (0.25 +/- 0.04 vs 0.81 +/- 0.08 ml/min/gm, p less than 0.01). It was concluded that the leukocyte-dependent myocardial injury did not appear to be mediated through a flow mechanism during either ischemia or reperfusion.\r"

Overall, mean left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 28 +/- 10% 1 month after infarction to 33 +/- 10% at 3 years (p less than 0.01); mean end-diastolic volume decreased from 217 +/- 99 ml to 171 +/- 80 ml (p less than 0.002). Stepwise improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction occurred in 15 of these patients (group B) and was associated with a significant increase in exercise capacity. Mean ejection fraction in group B was 26 +/- 7% at 1 month and 41 +/- 10% at 3 years (p less than 0.001). In all of these patients there was improved regional wall motion in the noninfarct zone, whereas five patients also showed improvement in the infarct zone. The results indicate a progressive improvement in left ventricular function that occurs over time in some patients after first Q wave anterior infarction, independent of intervention.\r"

Of this group, 10 patients (11%) were asymptomatic (ALMD) and 79 patients (88%) were symptomatic (SLMD). All 10 ALMD patients were men, with a mean age of 53 years (range 40 to 65). Treadmill tests (TMT) were performed for: ECG abnormalities six; pre-jogging evaluation two; risk factor evaluation two. The TMT within 9 minutes showed 2 mm or greater ST depression in seven (70%) and 1 to 2 mm in three (30%). Similar TMT results were obtained in the SLMD group, although two patients had negative responses. The degree of stenosis of the left main coronary artery and the frequency of three-vessel disease were similar in both groups. The ejection fraction (EF) and contractile pattern of the left ventricle (LV) were normal in all 10 ALMD patients, but the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was abnormal in three (70%). In the SLMD group, 51 (64%) had an abnormal ejection fraction, 50 (65%) had wall motion abnormalities, and 25 (32%) had an abnormal LVEDP.\r"

After selected age-specific changes in the incidence rates of initial events of acute MI between 1975 and 1981, the incidence rates of acute MI markedly declined between 1981 and 1984, resulting in decreases in the age-specific incidence rates of initial acute MI between 1975 and 1984. For the combined study periods, the in-hospital CFR of acute MI increased from 5.0% in patients less than 55 years of age to 7.9% in those 55 to 64 years, to 16.1% in those 65 to 74 years and to 32.1% in patients 75 years of age and older. Among discharged hospital survivors, increasing age was related to poorer long-term survival over a 5-year follow-up period. The results of this population-based study reinforce the need for, and importance of, modification of coronary risk factors in both young and older individuals, and of focused therapeutic efforts to salvage jeopardized myocardium in elderly patients hospitalized with acute MI.\r"

We evaluated the electrophysiologic, antiarrhythmic, and hemodynamic effects of d-sotalol infusion (1.5 to 2.75 mg/kg) and of chronic oral therapy (200 to 400 mg bid) in 10 patients with chronic, paroxysmal supraventricular tachyarrhythmias refractory to 5 +/- 2 standard agents. Four patients had paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), four had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, two had atrial flutter, and one had nonparoxysmal reciprocating junctional tachycardia (NPRJT). PSVT was inducible or spontaneously present in 4 of 4 before d-sotalol. After intravenous d-sotalol PSVT was noninducible in three patients and slowed by 40% in one. Atrial fibrillation was inducible or spontaneously present in 4 of 4 before therapy. After intravenous d-sotalol, one became noninducible, and three achieved rate-slowing (the mean falling from 69 to 61 bpm). In one patient, atrial flutter became noninducible; in another, d-sotalol slowed the rate of atrial flutter by 28%. D-sotalol restored sinus rhythm in the patient with NPRJT. Intravenous d-sotalol increased the sinus cycle length; the QTc, PR, and AH intervals; and the AV nodal functional refractory period, the AV nodal effective refractory period; and the right ventricular effective refractory period significantly. The atrial effective refractory period, sinoatrial conduction time, and corrected sinus recovery time tended to increase, but did not reach statistical significance. The QRS, PA, and HV intervals did not change. Mean BP fell 13.4 +/- 9.2% after intravenous d-sotalol, but no adverse symptoms developed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Because calcium channel blocking drugs have antiadrenergic effects, we hypothesized that they might blunt the adrenergic response to defibrillation. Ventricular fibrillation was induced in 35 closed-chest dogs. Each received 4 to 7 direct current transthoracic shocks at three energy levels to determine defibrillation energy requirements. Heart rate and blood pressure were recorded. Energy sequences were repeated after 45 minutes of no intervention (control, n = 5) or after 45-minute infusions of diltiazem (0.1 mg/kg/min, n = 10), verapamil (0.1 mg/kg bolus plus 0.01 mg/kg/min, n = 10), or nifedipine (40 micrograms/min for 3 minutes plus 2 to 20 micrograms/min adjusted to maintain a 10 mm Hg drop in mean arterial pressure, n = 10). Our results show that the normal post-shock rise in mean arterial pressure was blunted by the calcium channel blockers diltiazem (systolic arterial pressure at 15 and 60 seconds post-shock, pre-drug versus post-drug: 102 +/- 9 versus 64 +/- 9 mm Hg and 113 +/- 10 versus 87 +/- 6 mm Hg; p less than 0.05) and verapamil (108 +/- 9 versus 78 +/- 12 mm Hg and 113 +/- 7 versus 90 +/- 10 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). There were no differences in blood pressure responses after nifedipine treatment or no drug. Heart rate responses were not altered by diltiazem or verapamil; after nifedipine administration, post-shock heart rates were slower.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Previous studies have found that sinus rhythm can be distinguished from a variety of tachyarrhythmias by algorithms that are based on time-domain and frequency-domain analysis of intracardiac electrograms. Amplitude distribution analysis (time-domain) and power density spectral analysis (frequency-domain) are two of the techniques that have seemed to hold promise. However, previous studies have not evaluated whether lead maturation or drugs such as lidocaine, propranolol, verapamil, or isoproterenol can interfere with the ability of these algorithms to distinguish among cardiac rhythms. In the present study, five dogs had permanent atrial pacing leads placed. On a series of days, recordings were made from the atrial leads during sinus rhythm and induced sustained atrial fibrillation, both before and after administration of cardioactive drugs. For up to 1 month after implantation, progressive lead maturation did not prevent differentiation of atrial fibrillation from sinus rhythm by either amplitude distribution analysis or power density spectral analysis. However, the difference between the power density spectra of sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation became progressively less with time. Isoproterenol, lidocaine, verapamil, and propranolol had no consistent effects on amplitude distribution analysis of atrial electrograms during sinus rhythm or atrial fibrillation. However, there were marked effects of drugs on amplitude distribution characteristics in individual dogs. Propranolol and lidocaine produced consistent changes in power density spectra during sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation, respectively; both drugs reduced the ability of power density spectral analysis to differentiate sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To determine if the adaptation of ventricular refractoriness to an abrupt increase in heart rate is impaired in heart failure, electrophysiologic findings in 11 patients with structurally normal hearts (group I) were compared to findings in 28 patients with chronic heart failure (mean left ventricular ejection fraction 0.23 +/- 0.05). Heart failure was due to coronary artery disease in 14 patients (group II) and to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy in 14 patients (group III). The effective refractory period at the right ventricular apex was measured during unipolar cathodal pacing at twice diastolic threshold following a 12-beat ventricular drive at a cycle length of 600 msec. The pacing cycle length was then decreased to 400 msec for one, two, and three beats and the refractory period was determined for each beat at the faster rate. For each beat the mean refractory periods of group II and III patients were similar and were significantly longer than those of group I patients (p less than 0.01). The refractory period progressively shortened at the 400 msec cycle length and the percent decrease for each beat was similar among all three groups (p greater than 0.10). In the group II and III patients there was no correlation of the refractory period or change in refractory period with the pulmonary artery, right atrial, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A reasonably accurate, simple, inexpensive, noninvasive method of determining ejection fraction (EF) is necessary to evaluate left ventricular function in epidemiologic studies and individual patients. Using the concepts of left ventricular mass reflected by precordial R wave summation (M) and left ventricular volume (V) estimated by chest roentgenography in 114 patients with myocardial disease undergoing left ventriculography, EF was predicted with the formula: EF = 63.74 - (2.16.V) + (0.34.M); R2 = 0.69; standard error of the estimate (SEE) = 11. Because angiographic inferior wall motion (IWM) abnormalities significantly affected the results, but inferior Q waves were usually only present in patients having one infarct, a noninvasive technique to predict the presence of inferior wall motion abnormality (IMA) in patients having multiple infarcts was developed and based on the relationship of precordial R wave summation (M) and roentgenographic heart volumenometry (V). By combining V, M, and IMA (which predicted IWM) to determine EF, multiple linear regression analysis showed that EF = 67.30 - (1.56.V) + (0.23.M) - (14.18 IMA) (R2 = 0.77; SEE = 9). Prospective validation of the formula was then done in 139 consecutive individuals, with R2 = 0.49 and SEE = 9. This study demonstrates that routinely performed, simple, inexpensive clinical tests provide data that can be combined by multiple regression analysis to predict resting EF in patients with heart disease affecting the left ventricle. This unique method may allow inexpensive ventricular function screening in large population studies and in addition might provide an independent index of myocardial performance for clinical use, since it reflects the amount of contractile mass per unit of left ventricular volume.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Transmitral velocity was recorded before and after balloon inflation during coronary angioplasty. At baseline the transmitral velocity pattern in patients with LAD stenosis differed from that of normal subjects with a significant (p at least less than 0.05) decrease in the early diastolic filling phase (E area 0.094 +/- 0.022 m in normal subjects vs 0.078 +/- 0.008 m in patients) and an increase in the late diastolic filling phase (A area 0.034 +/- 0.007 m vs 0.042 +/- 0.008 m). Correspondingly the ratio E area/A area decreased (2.7 +/- 0.51 vs 1.9 +/- 0.4) and the ratio A area/total area increased (0.28 +/- 0.04 vs 0.35 +/- 0.05). During coronary occlusion the E area and the ratio E area/A area decreased further, whereas the A area and the ratio A area/total area increased. The results suggest that patients with single-vessel disease and normal systolic function often exhibit an altered pattern of transmitral velocity even in the absence of overt ischemia, and that during acute regional ischemia early diastolic filling is further compromised with compensatory enhancement of the late diastolic filling phase.\r"

At the eye examination (1973 to 1975) there were 133 diabetic persons with no cardiovascular disease, of whom 41% had lens changes. Of these 133 persons, 57 had at least one cardiovascular event by the time of the most recent follow-up examination (1981 to 1983). Regression analyses suggested an increased risk of cardiovascular events among diabetic persons with lens changes (incidence rate ratio = 1.8; p = 0.07). Specifically there were associations of lens changes with the development of congestive heart failure (incidence rate ratio = 3.6; p = 0.01) and coronary heart disease (incidence rate ratio = 2.4; p = 0.08). Thus lens changes, in addition to being early prognostic signs of mortality, appear to be predictors of cardiovascular disease in adult-onset diabetes.\r"

Results showed a pronounced dose-response relationship between cigarette smoking and cholesterol levels in men of all age groups and in women of premenopausal age; however, average cholesterol levels were similar in exsmokers and subjects who had never smoked. Risk analysis revealed a strong positive association between cholesterol and prevalence of nonfatal myocardial infarctions. Notably patients with newly diagnosed hypercholesterolemia reduced their cholesterol levels an average of 40 mg/dl under the care of a physician. These results indicate that cholesterol screening coupled with physician follow-up and treatment can have a substantial impact in lowering cholesterol levels and the attendant risk of cardiovascular disease.\r"

The crossover design of trial requires the successive examination of different treatments. This may result in a lengthy trial for the participant and an increase in the dropout rate. Therefore the parallel group design is usually performed for a comparison of several active drugs or drugs and placebo. This design avoids the potential problems of order and carryover effects, and when of a long duration, takes into account short-term and longer term responses to drugs. Crossover trials with limited periods of treatment for each phase can be carried out with fewer numbers of subjects and are more economical of patient resources. However, care must be taken to correct for order effects by appropriate design and to exclude carryover effects. Usually such a design only allows the investigator to comment on short-term blood pressure responses. The extrapolation of such information for longer term use of the drugs in clinical practice requires much caution.\r"

In elderly subjects and patients with mild and moderate renal insufficiency, there was little change in the kinetics of benazepril or benazeprilat. In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min), benazeprilat elimination was slowed, which resulted in greater accumulation after repeated dosing. In patients with hepatic cirrhosis, the kinetics and bioavailability of benazeprilat were not affected. Therefore dose adjustment is unnecessary because of the patient's age, mild or moderate renal impairment, or hepatic cirrhosis. Dose reduction is necessary in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min.\r"

  ".W": "The temporal evolution of left ventricular (LV) function after intracoronary streptokinase therapy for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was assessed from the data of 264 patients who had complete occlusion of either the left anterior descending or the right coronary artery before treatment. Angiography was performed immediately, and at 3 days and 6 months after AMI in 91%, 71% and 47% of the study group, respectively. Wall motion was measured by the centerline method. In patients with sustained reperfusion, the ejection fraction decreased at 3 days (delta = -2.0 +/- 9.9%, n = 134, p = 0.02) and recovered later (from 54 +/- 12% acutely to 57 +/- 12% at 6 months, n = 82, p less than 0.05). These changes in global function were associated with a marked regression in hyperkinesis in the noninfarcted wall by 3 days, and delayed recovery of wall motion in the infarct region (delta = 0.2 +/- 0.9 at 3 days, p = 0.055; 1.0 +/- 1.2 at 6 months, p less than 0.001). Patients without reperfusion or with reocclusion had a more severe decrease in ejection fraction at 3 days, and little or no subsequent functional recovery. The length of the hypokinetic segment increased significantly by 3 days but subsequently diminished to slightly less than the acute value. It is concluded that full recovery of ischemically impaired myocardium takes greater than 3 days, but compensatory hyperkinesis regresses earlier so that global LV function deteriorates by the third day. Variability or deterioration of LV function early after AMI need not be due to infarct extension; it can reflect regression of hyperkinesis in the noninfarcted region.\r"

The differences were statistically significant, except for erythrocyte PLP and total potential enzyme activity. The adjusted relative odds of a myocardial infarction for subjects in the lowest quartile of plasma PLP was about 5 times higher when compared with those in the highest quartile (relative odds = 5.2, 95% confidence interval = 1.4 to 18.9). Similar findings were found with the other vitamin B6 indexes. No significant association between infarct size, as estimated by creatine kinase level, and the vitamin B6 indexes was observed.\r"

Quantitative exercise thallium-201 scintigraphy was performed 2.2 +/- 1.2 weeks after successful PTCA in 68 asymptomatic patients, 64 (94%) of whom had class III or IV angina before the procedure. Clinical follow-up was obtained in all patients at a mean of 10 +/- 2 months and all were followed for at least 6 months; 45 patients (66%) remained asymptomatic during follow-up and 23 (34%) developed recurrent class III or IV angina at a mean of 2.6 +/- 1.2 months. Multivariate analysis of 22 clinical, angiographic and exercise test variables revealed that thallium-201 redistribution, any thallium scan abnormality, presence of a distal stenosis and treadmill time were the only significant predictors of recurrent angina after PTCA. Using a stepwise discriminant function model, thallium-201 redistribution was the only significant independent predictor. Despite its prognostic value relative to other variables as a predictor, thallium redistribution at 2 weeks after PTCA was only detected in 9 of the 23 patients (39%) who subsequently developed recurrent angina, although only 2 of the 45 patients (9%) who remained asymptomatic during follow-up demonstrated thallium-201 redistribution at the time of early testing. After repeat angiography was performed in 17 of the 23 patients with recurrent angina, 14 (82%) demonstrated restenosis and 3 (18%) had worse narrowing distal to or remote from the site of dilatation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Coronary anatomy and LV end-diastolic pressure at catheterization were compared with results of supine exercise radionuclide ventriculography in 66 patients evaluated for chest pain. Forty-six patients had significant CAD (greater than 75% diameter stenosis) and 20 patients were normal. Radionuclide ventriculography was performed within 18 hours of catheterization, at rest and at peak exercise. Relative LV end-diastolic volumes were extrapolated from end-diastolic counts. LV end-diastolic counts increased during exercise in 19 of 20 normal subjects. In patients with CAD, LV end-diastolic counts increased in 35 (group A) and decreased in 11 (group B). The percent change in LV end-diastolic counts from rest to exercise, rest ejection fraction, exercise ejection fraction and rest LV end-diastolic pressure for each group were 20 +/- 23%, 60 +/- 13%, 67 +/- 13% and 8 +/- 3 mm Hg in normal subjects; 20 +/- 20%, 50 +/- 12%, 47 +/- 13% and 12 +/- 4 mm Hg in group A; and -9 +/- 8%, 54 +/- 21%, 49 +/- 18% and 21 +/- 7 mm Hg in group B (mean +/- standard deviation).

  ".U": "89148120\r", 
  ".W": "To assess the electrophysiologic characteristics of the excitable gap, 12 patients with orthodromic atrioventricular (AV) reciprocating tachycardia were studied. During tachycardia, 8 patients used a left-sided and 4 patients a right-sided anomalous bypass tract for retrograde conduction. QRS complex-synchronized single extrastimuli were delivered from high right atrium, right ventricular apex and coronary sinus, respectively, scanning the whole cycle length of tachycardia. An excitable gap was determined to be present if tachycardia resetting or tachycardia termination occurred. The duration of the excitable gap varied among different pacing sites and occupied 0 to 48% (mean 17 +/- 16) of basic tachycardia cycle length (240 to 480 ms, mean 327 +/- 70). Three patterns of tachycardia resetting were observed: the sum of coupling interval and return cycle being (1) less than a fully compensatory pause in 12 of 12 patients, (2) more than a fully compensatory pause in 5 of 12 patients and (3) equal to a fully compensatory pause in 2 of 12 patients, depending on extent of AV nodal conduction delay exhibited in return cycle. Tachycardia termination was possible when extrastimuli were delivered from right ventricular apex and coronary sinus but not from high right atrium, and only when basic tachycardia cycle length was greater than or equal to 290 ms in 7 of 12 patients. Tachycardia termination was accounted for by development of orthodromic conduction block in AV node in 7 of 7 patients and in bypass tract in 2 of 7 patients. Therefore, site of extra-stimulation and basic tachycardia cycle length affect electrophysiologic manifestations of excitable gap. Further, functional properties of the AV node influence patterns of tachycardia resetting and are primarily responsible for tachycardia termination during programmed single extrastimulation.\r"

  ".W": "Reduction of random noise by signal averaging is required to uncover ventricular late potentials (LPs). Noise reduction is dependent upon the ambient noise before the study and the number of signal-averaged QRS complexes. Prior studies have used a fixed number of QRS complexes (e.g., 150 to 200) for performing signal-averaged electrocardiograms (SAECGs). Because of variable background noise levels, it was hypothesized that variable noise levels after processing could interfere with detection of LP. Accordingly, SAECGs were performed for each patient to 2 prespecified noise endpoints (expressed as the standard deviation/square root of number of beats): 1.0 microV, which has been used previously as a minimal residual noise level, and 0.3 microV, a low level that generally can be attained in less than 450 beats. Root mean square-voltage noises in the 40-Hz high pass filtered vector magnitude for these studies were 1.36 +/- 0.57 and 0.58 +/- 0.28 microV, respectively. The relative prevalence of LP was evaluated in 3 groups. Group I was comprised of 26 patients with sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias, group II included 59 patients after myocardial infarction and group III had 14 normal volunteers. The prevalence of LP was greater in group I (69 vs 46%, p less than 0.001) and group II (34 vs 24%, p less than 0.01) with the 0.3-microV studies. In group III, the prevalence did not change (7 vs 7%, difference not significant). The greater detection of LP was due to improved resolution of the terminal low-amplitude QRS segment. Therefore, using the 0.3 microV level instead of 1.0 microV increased sensitivity of LP without loss of specificity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In control studies, sustained AF (greater than 1 minute), nonsustained AF (1 to 60 seconds) and no AF were found in 14, 18 and 8 patients, respectively. After disopyramide, the ability to initiate AF was totally lost in 18 patients (group A), while 22 patients (group B) showed sustained AF (11 patients) or nonsustained AF (11 patients). The effective refractory period of the atrium was 232 +/- 41 ms in the control study and 266 +/- 49 ms after disopyramide. Atrial functional refractory periods before and after disopyramide were 282 +/- 43 and 317 +/- 48 ms, respectively. The differences and ratios of the refractory periods after and before disopyramide were higher in group A than in group B (p less than 0.001). The prolongation of atrial refractoriness after disopyramide was important to suppress the initiation of AF in group A. In some group B patients, on the other hand, the initiation of AF was promoted after disopyramide. Disopyramide may alter the atrial electrophysiologic substrate required for AF initiation.\r"

During initial evaluation, lisinopril produced significant decreases in mean systemic arterial pressure, pulmonary artery wedge pressure, systemic vascular resistance, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, mean right atrial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance, and concomitant increases in cardiac index and stroke volume index. After 12 weeks of therapy with lisinopril, the dosage of which was titrated to produce optimal relief of symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF), repeat hemodynamic studies revealed persistent significant reductions in baseline systemic arterial pressure, pulmonary artery wedge pressure, mean pulmonary arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance. However, the increases in cardiac index and stroke volume index were not statistically significant. To determine if further acute hemodynamic changes occur during long-term therapy, the patients were readministered a dose of lisinopril. This caused further decreases in systemic arterial pressure, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary artery wedge pressure, systemic vascular resistance and mean right atrial pressure, and an increase in cardiac index. Lisinopril did not change stroke work index at either initial or rechallenge study. This study indicates that in patients with CHF treated with lisinopril, acute hemodynamic effects persist after 12 weeks of therapy, and acute hemodynamic response continues to occur upon drug readministration.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of severe mitral regurgitation (MR) due to active rheumatic carditis is ill defined. This study involved 73 patients, aged 7 to 27 years (mean 13), with severe MR and active rheumatic carditis who were subjected to surgery. Sixty-one were studied retrospectively (group 1) and 12 prospectively (group 2). Active rheumatic carditis was diagnosed according to the modified Jones' criteria, morphologic appearances of the heart at operation and histology of the valve. All patients had preoperative 2-dimensional echocardiographic and intraoperative assessment of the mitral valve apparatus. The presence of mitral valve prolapse--defined as failure of leaflet edge coaptation resulting in systolic displacement of the free edge of the involved leaflet toward the left atrium--was determined in all patients. Mitral anular diameter and maximal systolic chordal length were measured at 2-dimensional echocardiography in group 2 patients and compared to values obtained from matched control subjects. Anular and chordal dimensions in 6 of the group 2 patients were correlated with precise measurements obtained at surgery. Mitral valve prolapse involving the anterior leaflet was detected on echocardiography and confirmed at surgery in 69 patients (94%). Mitral anular dilatation was observed at operation in 70 patients (96%). Maximal anular diameter was significantly greater (p less than 0.0001) than in matched control subjects (37 +/- 4 vs 23 +/- 2 mm). The mean anular dimension measured at surgery (36 +/- 3 mm) was similar to that obtained by echocardiography and individual values using the 2 methods correlated well (r = 0.93). Chordal elongation was observed in 66 patients at operation (90%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It was thought that the long-term survival of patients with tricuspid atresia would be improved by the introduction of the Fontan procedure and its subsequent modifications. This study reviews the clinical course of 84 patients with tricuspid atresia identified in the first year of life in the Fontan era. Prior palliative operations, their results and their ultimate application for the Fontan procedure were considered. Eleven patients died before surgical intervention and 5 did not undergo catheterization or echocardiographic confirmation before death. Five children underwent the Fontan procedure without prior palliation and 1 child does not require palliation at the present time. Sixty-seven patients (80%) had surgical procedures before evaluation for the suitability of a Fontan operation. Thirty-four patients had a second surgical palliation and 9 patients had a third palliation. The surgical mortalities for the first, second and third palliative surgery were 17.9, 17.6 and 0%, respectively. Thirty-two patients (38%) underwent the Fontan procedure and 2 deaths occurred (6%). An estimate of the probability of surviving for 1 year was 64% (95% confidence limits 54 to 74%) and that of 8 years was 55% (95% confidence limits 44 to 66%).\r"

  ".W": "The feasibility and potential adverse effects of using intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in 19 children ages 7.5 to 16 years undergoing surgical repair of a variety of congenital heart defects were evaluated. The ability of TEE to assess the adequacy of surgical repair as well as left ventricular function and wall motion abnormalities in this setting was also examined. Intraoperative transesophageal 2-dimensional and Doppler evaluation, and, in selected patients, echo-contrast and color flow imaging, were performed with either a 3.5- or 5.0-MHz phased array probe mounted within the tip of a flexible gastroscope. Probe insertion was successful in 18 of 19 patients. Fiberoptic endoscopy (9 patients) and autopsy (1 patient--cardiac donor) performed within 24 hours of surgery demonstrated no significant esophageal abnormalities. Intraoperative wall motion abnormalities were identified in 8 patients but did not persist after the operation. An adequate surgical repair was demonstrated by contrast and color flow imaging in most patients. Microcavitation was detected in 6 patients for greater than 5 minutes after a standard debubbling procedure. No patient displayed any adverse neurologic effects. It is concluded that, with the currently available probes, intraoperative TEE can be performed safely and reliably in children as young as 7.5 years of age. The procedure provides valuable information regarding wall motion abnormalities, cardiac function and the adequacy of surgical repair.\r"

Values of these variables for monozygotic and dizygotic twins reared together were obtained from other studies. Maximum likelihood tests of genetic and environmental components of variation for PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval and ventricular rate indicated a significant contribution of genetic effects (most heritabilities ranged from 30 to 60%), with a negligible contribution from common familial environmental effects.\r"

Typical LV hypertrophy map patterns were identified at successive instants during the PQRST waveform by removing from sequential LV hypertrophy maps the corresponding normal variability range at each electrode site. The presence in individual patients of 1 or more patterns typical in time and location of LV hypertrophy allowed retrospective assignment to the LV hypertrophy group. The most consistent discriminant patterns were excessive negative voltages in the anterior torso with reciprocal excess of positive voltages in the upper right chest during the second half of the P wave, excessive negative voltages in the lower right anterior torso at mid-QRS and excessive negative voltages in the left precordium with reciprocal excess of positive voltages in the upper right chest throughout ST-T. Best classification results were achieved with ST-T features, followed by features from the P wave, the QRS waveform and the PR segment. Cumulative use of ST-T and P features yielded a specificity of 94% with a sensitivity of 88%. Little improvement was obtained by the addition of QRS and PR information. The discriminant map criteria were applied to body surface potential maps from 169 new subjects (77 normal subjects ages 20 to 30 years and 92 patients with complicated LV hypertrophy). Little modification in specificity (93%) and sensitivity (90%) was observed. The performance of commonly used standard lead criteria was also tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although in vitro studies have shown that C. pylori is susceptible to most commonly used antibiotics, predictions from in vitro sensitivity studies have not led to a safe and generally effective therapy; C. pylori has proved to be very difficult to eradicate in vivo. We used the urea breath test to assess the susceptibility of C. pylori in vivo to various drugs. C. pylori was susceptible to bismuth subsalicylate, bismuth subnitrate, and furazolidone. C. pylori was not susceptible (i.e., urease activity remained despite administration of the drug) to the following drugs: 1) antiulcer agents (cimetidine, ranitidine, famotidine, omeprazole, misoprostol, sucralfate, liquid antacids); 2) NSAIDs (aspirin, indomethacin, ibuprofen, naproxen, tolmetin); 3) antibiotics (oral penicillin V, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, dicloxacillin); 4) salts (lithium, ferrous sulfate, gold); 5) miscellaneous (acetaminophen, phenytoin, hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol, metoprolol, metoclopramide, ursodeoxycholic acid). Oral antimicrobials can be administered directly onto the site of infection, so that a very low oral dose will provide many multiples of the in vitro minimal inhibitory concentration. Furazolidone suspension (7 mg) was administered seven times daily (daily dose 49 mg) to three individuals infected by C. pylori during suppression of gastric acid secretion with famotidine (40 mg bid). After 4 days, all subjects had significant reductions in urease activity (two to normal and one to a borderline value). This response suggested that very low-dose therapy may be useful either alone or combined with bismuth. Conclusive establishment of an etiologic (or major contributory) relationship of C. pylori to ulcer disease will require a safe and reliable method to eradicate the organism from the stomach and duodenum.\r"

However, the percentage of biopsies of normal mucosa was substantially higher than that of a compared series of biopsies not selected according to age of the patients. According to our findings in adolescents, the interstitial stroma of normal gastric mucosa in the antrum, as well as in the corpus, was absolutely free of round cells. Bacterial colonization with Campylobacter-like organisms (CLO) occurred almost as frequently as in the series not selected according to age. Consequently, the biopsy material of adolescents substantially more often featured normal mucosa with bacterial colonization, mostly of the minimal focal variety, than did the compared series. Colonization with CLO apparently takes place at an early age, and may exacerbate into a massive colonization.\r"

Common symptoms were upper abdominal pain and symptoms of gastroduodenal obstruction. Contiguous disease of the gastric antrum and duodenum was present in 60% of patients. Endoscopic examination revealed abnormalities in 62 of 67 patients. Granulomas or granulomatous inflammation was found in 37 of 76 patients. Forty-nine patients treated medically were followed up for 2-25 yr (median 9.7 yr). Good to excellent results were obtained in 45 patients. Thirty-three patients required surgical intervention, usually for gastroduodenal obstruction. Reoperation was required in eight patients, seven of whom had had vagotomy with gastroenterostomy or subtotal gastrectomy. In two of these seven patients, marginal ulcers developed. Both patients had had gastroenterostomy and vagotomy. Our experience does not support the routine use of vagotomy when a bypass procedure is performed. Good to excellent results were achieved in 26 of the 30 surgically treated patients followed up for more than 1 yr (1-43 yr; median 11 yr). Measured in terms of need for surgical intervention, gastroduodenal disease generated considerably less morbidity than did distal Crohn's disease (p less than 0.001). Most patients achieved good to excellent results whether treated medically or surgically.\r"

Three hundred sixty-five patients with definite CD were identified, and a complete follow-up was obtained. The incidence of CD rose from 0.33 (per 10(5)) in 1970 to 3.10 in 1979. This rise was noted in both sexes, in all age groups, in all major Jewish community groups, and was demonstrated in three different regions of the study area. It is thought to represent a true (10-fold) increase in incidence. The mean annual incidence was 1.55/10(5). The prevalence in 1970 was 7.08/10(5), and in 1980 it was 19.47/10(5). In 1970, the age-adjusted prevalence in immigrants from Europe-America was 13.27 and in immigrants from Asia-Africa it was 1.69. In 1980, the difference between the two groups narrowed and the prevalences were 26.05 and 12.37, respectively. This decrease in differences between original migrant groups, as well as the rapid changes in incidence, point to the effect of environmental factors in the pathogenesis of CD. Population studies worldwide have demonstrated an increased incidence of CD in Jews, with marked differences among Jews in different geographic areas. This suggests the coexistence of genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of the disease.\r"

PC infection did not occur significantly more often in patients with communicating PC or in those with preoperative ERCP. Factors that did not influence outcome included PC size, multiplicity, anatomic location, and PC communication with the pancreatic duct. Results from both ERCP and culture of PC contents add significantly to our knowledge of PC disease.\r"

Survival was not correlated with baseline GFR or RPF, but was correlated with changes in both GFR and RPF after indomethacin administration (p less than 0.01). The cumulative survival rate from 1 to 7 yr was significantly higher (p less than 0.01) in patients with a decrease in GFR of less than or equal to 15% after indomethacin administration than in patients with a decrease in GFR of more than 15%. Findings for changes in RPF after indomethacin administration were similar. These results suggest that the augmentation of prostaglandin inhibition by indomethacin is associated with a poor prognosis of liver cirrhosis. It may be involved in the depletion of renal prostaglandins to maintain renal hemodynamics in patients with liver cirrhosis.\r"

  ".W": "One gram of dehydrocholic acid was injected intravenously into two patients with percutaneous transhepatic cholangial drainage, and the biotransformed metabolites profiles over a 120-min period in serum and bile were analyzed. In serum unconjugated 3 alpha-hydroxy-7,12-dioxo-cholanoic acid (3 alpha-OH-7,12-OXO) acid was markedly increased after the injection of dehydrocholic acid, and reached about 80 microM within 30 min. On the other hand, conjugated 3 alpha, 7 alpha-dihydroxy-12-oxo-cholanoic acid (3 alpha,7 alpha-OH-12-OXO) was consecutively increased with lag time to an elevation of 3 alpha-OH-7,12-OXO. In bile, the major constituent of metabolites was conjugated 3 alpha,7 alpha-OH-12-OXO (more than 90% of the excreted metabolites), while conjugated 3 alpha-OH-7,12-OXO was detected as minor constituent. Therefore, between bile and serum, there was great difference in biotransformed metabolites profiles. The mechanism of elevation of unconjugated 3 alpha-OH-7,12-OXO in serum remains obscure, but this new finding raised a question as to whether organ-reducing 3-keto group of dehydrocholic acid is restricted to the liver.\r"

Shunts were mimicked by the simultaneous infusion of glycocholic acid into a small peripheral portal venule and a peripheral vein. The total infused amount was kept constant, but the ratio at the two infusion sites varied. Determination of the extraction efficiency of the liver by simultaneously measuring the hepatic vein and arterial blood for systemically infused [14C]glycocholic acid permitted the calculation of shunted blood from information provided by the concentration of glycocholic acid in the hepatic vein, artery, and portal vein blood. This method was tested for various proportion of shunting from none to complete. The total hepatic flow was determined with single injection of indocyanine green and the individual arterial and portal vein flows determined with flowmeters. The input ratios of shunting related quite closely to that calculated from the flowmeters or the hepatic extraction ratio.\r"

Although all routine laboratory and radiologic investigations were negative, colonoscopy revealed the presence of serpiginous ulcers with pseudopolyps and inflamed intervening mucosa in the proximal half of the colon. Therapy with oral steroids was helpful, but the disease exacerbated a few months after prednisone was discontinued. Repeat evaluation showed similar endoscopic findings and, on colonic biopsy, noncaseating granulomas compatible with Crohn's disease were seen. Again, the patient responded well to oral steroids and sulfasalazine. We believe that gastrointestinal involvement in our patient is compatible with Crohn's disease and that screening tests to rule out chronic inflammatory bowel disease should be performed in the presence of gastrointestinal involvement in Behcet's disease. Behcet's disease may be a part of the spectrum of chronic inflammatory bowel disease.\r"

To evaluate whether sucralfate could be used to treat hyperphosphatemia secondary to chronic renal failure and whether this treatment resulted in a reduced exposure to aluminum, an open-label crossover study was designed to determine the efficacy, relative potency, safety, and cost of sucralfate v aluminum hydroxide. Of the 21 hemodialysis patients completing both phases of the crossover study, serum phosphate could be maintained below 4.5 mg/dL (1.45 mmol/L) in 16 with sucralfate and in 14 with aluminum hydroxide. The 16 patients controlled on sucralfate consumed 1,694 +/- 190 mg/d of aluminum to maintain a serum phosphate concentration of 3.91 +/- 0.17 mg/dL (1.27 +/- 0.05 mmol/L) compared with the 14 patients controlled on aluminum hydroxide with an aluminum intake of 2,678 +/- 294 mg/d (P less than 0.025) and a serum phosphate concentration of 3.94 +/- 0.13 mg/dL (1.27 +/- 0.04 mmol/L). Thus sucralfate was an effective, albeit expensive, alternative to aluminum hydroxide for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia associated with chronic renal failure. Although the difference in aluminum intake was significant, use of sucralfate did not result in lower serum aluminum concentrations.\r"

In this investigation, four groups of Munich-Wistar rats were studied to determine if glomerular dynamics or another renal metabolic consequence of Tx was responsible for the protective effect as measured by 24-hour protein excretion (UPROT). The groups were TxT4, thyroxine-replaced Tx rats with five-sixths nephrectomy; Tx, Tx rats not receiving replacement thyroxine with five-sixths nephrectomy; TxI, Tx rats not receiving replacement thyroxine with five-sixths nephrectomy that were given continuous intraperitoneal isoproterenol to restore systemic and renal hemodynamics; and TxT4(C), two-kidney Tx rats receiving replacement thyroxine that served as normal controls. Five-sixths nephrectomy was carried out 2 weeks after Tx, and experiments were carried out 1 week later. Serum T4 was profoundly reduced and there was failure to gain weight in Tx and TxI rats, despite similar protein intakes in all groups. Cardiac output was reduced in Tx, but was similar in TxI to levels in TxT4 rats. Whole-kidney glomerular filtration rate was lower in Tx, at 0.145 +/- 0.052 mL/min (P less than 0.05), but similar in TxI (0.305 +/- 0.147 mL/min) to that in TxT4 rats (0.317 +/- 0.135 mL/min). Twenty-four-hour urinary protein, which was 129 +/- 57 mg in TxT4, was reduced in Tx to 9 +/- 3 mg (P less than 0.01) but restored in TxI to 89 +/- 30 mg, a level similar to that in TxT4.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The amount removed from the extracellular compartment as a proportion to the total amount removed from the whole body by hemofiltration was 86.5% +/- 10.6% for guanidinosuccinic acid, 69.1% +/- 15.6% for sodium, 59.4% +/- 3.3% for uric acid, 56.4% +/- 2.1% for inorganic phosphate, 45.6% +/- 5.3% for creatinine, 43.1% +/- 7.2% for potassium, 42.9% +/- 3.1% for guanidinoacetic acid, 42.5% +/- 7.5% for methylguanidine, 37.2% +/- 8.4% for chloride, 36.3% +/- 2.8% for urea, and 6.9% +/- 2.9% for glucose. These results show that extracellular substances such as sodium and guanidinosuccinic acid were removed mainly from the extracellular compartment. On the other hand, glucose was removed only from the intracellular compartment, since blood glucose level is regulated. Although uric acid, inorganic phosphate, creatinine, potassium, guanidinoacetic acid, and methylguanidine are intracellular substances, they accumulated also in the extracellular fluid in renal failure, and were removed from both compartments, intracellular as well as extracellular, by hemofiltration.\r"

Several hormonal mediators of this response have been proposed, including renal prostaglandins (PGs). We studied ten normal subjects before and after ingestion of indomethacin. All subjects had three 30-minute baseline creatinine and iothalamate clearances measured before and three one-hour clearances measured after an 80-g protein meal. The night before the second test, the subjects took 25 mg indomethacin and 150 mg one hour before the test meal. Urine PG excretion decreased significantly during the second test, from 0.60 +/- 0.23 to 0.30 +/- 0.14 ng/min (P less than 0.01). Initial iothalamate clearance increased from 110 +/- 10 to a mean of 122 +/- 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 (average increase of 12 mL/min/1.73 m2) during the second hour after the test meal. After ingestion of indomethacin, the GFR remained unchanged from a baseline of 101 +/- 9 to 101 +/- 7 mL/min/1.73 m2 (average change of -1 mL/min/1.73 m2). Because the time of peak increase after the meal varied from subject to subject, the maximal increase in GFR after the meal was calculated and found to be significantly less during the second test, 13 +/- 3 v 22 +/- 4 mL/min/1.73 m2 (P less than 0.05). Because PGs can stimulate glucagon secretion and because glucagon has been suggested to mediate the protein-stimulate GFR response, we measured plasma glucagon during both tests; these levels were not different.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We report two cases from a family with primary Fanconi syndrome. A 39-year-old white woman with a history of frequent bone fractures developed hypophosphatemia, hypouricemia, hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis, and renal glycosuria. Her 15-year-old son had renal glycosuria without metabolic acidosis. Both had mildly to moderately impaired renal function. Determination of amino acids in 24-hour urine specimens confirmed the generalized nature of aminoaciduria. Acid-loading, bicarbonate-loading, and phosphate-loading tests revealed that the mother had proximal (type II) renal tubular acidosis and excessive renal loss of phosphate for her level of renal function. These tests for the son were normal or within normal limits of his renal function. Known causes of Fanconi syndrome, such as cystinosis and Wilson's disease, were excluded by slit-lamp eye examination and leukocyte cystine level determination. One unexpected finding in the son was the preseNce of nephrocalcinosis on x-rays; a percutaneous needle biopsy of the kidney showed tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and calcium oxalate crystal deposits. The two cases presented here represent a familial variety of the primary Fanconi syndrome, a rare entity with a limited number of cases reported in the literature.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE AND PATIENTS AND METHODS: Many symptoms in outpatient practice are poorly understood. To determine the incidence, diagnostic findings, and outcome of 14 common symptoms, we reviewed the records of 1,000 patients followed by house staff in an internal medicine clinic over a three-year period. The following data were abstracted for each symptom: patient characteristics, symptom duration, evaluation, suspected etiology of the symptom, treatment prescribed, and outcome of the symptom. Cost estimates for diagnostic evaluation were calculated by means of the schedule of prevailing rates for Texas employed by the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services for physician reimbursement. RESULTS: A total of 567 new complaints of chest pain, fatigue, dizziness, headache, edema, back pain, dyspnea, insomnia, abdominal pain, numbness, impotence, weight loss, cough, and constipation were noted, with 38 percent of the patients reporting at least one symptom. Although diagnostic testing was performed in more than two thirds of the cases, an organic etiology was demonstrated in only 16 percent. The cost of discovering an organic diagnosis was high, particularly for certain symptoms, such as headache ($7,778) and back pain ($7,263). Treatment was provided for only 55 percent of the symptoms and was often ineffective. Where outcome was documented, 164 (53 percent) of 307 symptoms improved. Three favorable prognostic factors were an organic etiology (p = 0.006), a symptom duration of less than four months (p = 0.009), and a history of two or fewer symptoms (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The classification, evaluation, and management of common symptoms need to be refined. Diagnostic strategies emphasizing organic causes may be inadequate.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Symptoms suggesting altered autonomic regulation of cardiovascular function have been noted in some patients with mitral valvular prolapse (MVP) but may also occur in patients with other disorders. We evaluated cardiovascular responses to autonomic stimuli in 118 patients with symptoms of dysautonomia, 78 of whom had MVP, and 40 of whom did not, to determine if unique patterns of these responses distinguished patients in one symptomatic subgroup from another. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The responses of patients to standing, quantitated Valsalva maneuver, facial immersion in ice water, and administration of isoproterenol, phenylephrine, and tyramine were compared with those in 12 asymptomatic patients with MVP and 23 normal volunteers. RESULTS: Constitutional, cardiovascular, and neuropsychiatric symptoms occurred with similar frequency in the two symptomatic patient groups. The most common pattern of abnormal responses in symptomatic patients with or without MVP was (1) an increased heart rate and elevated plasma norepinephrine levels while supine and then while standing quietly for five minutes, (2) an exaggerated increase in heart rate during phase II of Valsalva, (3) a diminished bradycardic response during phase IV of Valsalva, and (4) an exaggerated heart rate response to administration of isoproterenol. The increased heart rate during Valsalva, but not the exaggerated sensitivity to isoproterenol, was correlated with the magnitude of the chronotropic response to standing only in symptomatic patients with MVP. Exaggerated hypertensive overshoot during phase IV of Valsalva was observed in only a few symptomatic patients. No consistent pattern of these abnormalities, however, was noted in any of the patient subgroups. Hemodynamic responses to autonomic stimuli in asymptomatic MVP patients were generally indistinguishable from those observed in normal subjects. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that abnormal cardiovascular responses to autonomic stimuli may occur in any patient with symptoms of dysautonomia regardless of the presence or absence of MVP and that the pattern of these abnormal responses may be diverse. It is therefore important to characterize the pattern of altered autonomic regulation of cardiovascular function in each patient when considering mechanistic implications or making therapeutic decisions about these patients.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Identification of the hereditary non-polyposis colorectal carcinoma syndrome (HNPCC) is a basis for secondary prevention. The objectives of this study are to investigate the natural history of HNPCC and to assess the effect of screening. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Screening for colorectal carcinoma was performed in 22 HNPCC families (colonoscopy or double-contrast barium enema and sigmoidoscopy). The patients were subdivided into two groups. Group A comprised patients with colorectal cancer who were referred because they were symptomatic. Group B included family members of these patients who were found to have a colorectal lesion by screening. We compared these groups with respect to the stage of tumor growth. RESULTS: Histologic examination of the tumors in Group A (87 patients) revealed Dukes A carcinomas in six patients, Dukes B carcinomas in 37, Dukes C carcinomas in 21, and Dukes D carcinomas in 10 patients (classification unknown in 13 patients). In Group B (20 patients), adenoma was found in 14 and carcinoma in six patients (Dukes A in two and Dukes B in four patients). A total of 93 patients, including those whose tumors were detected by screening, had a colorectal carcinoma. The age at diagnosis ranged from 24 to 81 years (mean age: 46 years). The location of the colonic tumors was proximal in 60 percent. Multiple primary tumors were found in 26 percent. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that screening leads to the early detection of colorectal carcinomas and adenomas in asymptomatic members of HNPCC families. Screening should be initiated at the age of 20 and continued during the life of the individual. Careful examination of the right colon is indicated because of the frequent occurrence of tumors in the proximal colon. A subtotal colectomy is indicated at the time of diagnosis of the initial colon cancer because of the risk of multiple primary tumors.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Thyroid hormone resistance affects the pituitary gland and a variety of other tissues. We studied a large kindred with this disorder and measured a number of clinical markers of tissue metabolism to determine if these markers were useful in elucidating the sites and degree of resistance. PATIENTS: A kindred of 89 persons in four generations was identified; 44 had thyroid function tests, and 14 (five to 67 years old) were found to have thyroid hormone resistance. RESULTS: The inheritance pattern was autosomal dominant, with no common HLA haplotype. Physiologic measurements in five affected members showed marked heterogeneity. Four patients had normal baseline cardiac contractility, but only two experienced a shortening of their QKd interval into the hyperthyroid range with triiodothyronine (T3) therapy. Intrathyroidal 127I content was increased in two patients and was normal in two. Bone mineral content was normal in two men, but two women had marked osteopenia. The propositus, hypothyroid after inappropriate 131I therapy, had a hypothyroid ventilatory response to hypercapnea. This response became low normal during T3 (100 micrograms/day) administration but not during long-term thyroxine (T4) (300 micrograms/day) administration. Three other patients had values within normal limits and one had a hyperthyroid ventilatory response. Peripheral biochemical markers of thyroid hormone action were measured in 13 affected and 19 unaffected family members. Sex hormone-binding globulin was increased in zero of 13 affected patients (versus 19 of 20 hyperthyroid, chi 2:p less than 0.001); ferritin was elevated in two of 13 patients (versus 11 of 20 hyperthyroid, p less than 0.02); angiotensin converting enzyme activity was increased in one of 13 patients (versus 12 of 20 hyperthyroid, p less than 0.025). The eldest patient had marked cardiac sensitivity despite normal biochemical markers. We attempted to suppress the integrated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) using T3 (72 and 100 percent suppression in two patients), dopamine (40 percent suppression in one), 3,5,3'-triiodothyroacetic acid (TRIAC) (94 percent suppression in one), and verapamil (10 percent and 40 percent suppression in two). Neuropsychologic function was studied in 14 individuals (11 affected, three unaffected). Although mild impairments were detected, they were not specific for thyroid hormone resistance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

We decided to evaluate the prevalence of Felty's syndrome and granular lymphocyte proliferation among patients with rheumatoid arthritis and to determine the fraction of patients with granular lymphocyte proliferation who also had rheumatoid arthritis. PATIENTS, METHODS, AND RESULTS: We retrospectively analyzed 1,053 cases of rheumatoid arthritis and 13,505 marrow examination reports for the decade 1978 to 1987. Among patients with Felty's syndrome rheumatoid arthritis with neutropenia/leukopenia, and rheumatoid arthritis with splenomegaly, we identified 18 patients with neutropenia as a manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis. We also identified marrow examinations in 150 patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Using blood counts, microscopy of marrow, and surface antigen analysis of mononuclear cells, we determined that 12 patients had typical Felty's syndrome and six had granular lymphocyte proliferation, representing prevalences of 1.1 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively. No patient had granular lymphocyte proliferation without neutropenia. CONCLUSION: Granular lymphocyte proliferation and neutropenia with or without splenomegaly in rheumatoid arthritis commonly resembles typical Felty's syndrome. Further, the six patients with granular lymphocyte proliferation represent 20 percent of our institution's patients with granular lymphocyte proliferation, supporting the previously described common association of this disorder with rheumatoid arthritis. The relatively large fraction of deaths (due to malignancy and infection) among the patients with typical Felty's syndrome suggests that their mean survival may be comparatively less than in those with granular lymphocyte proliferation.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: We performed this study in order to expand on an earlier report indicating a high prevalence of the sleep apnea syndrome in male patients with end-stage renal disease treated with hemodialysis and to determine whether patients with chronic renal insufficiency (prior to the initiation of therapy for end-stage renal disease) and female patients with end-stage renal disease treated with hemodialysis were affected. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Polysomnography was performed in 26 male and female patients with chronic renal insufficiency and end-stage renal disease treated with hemodialysis who were not receiving testosterone. They included 22 whose histories were suggestive of sleep apnea (\"symptomatic\") and four whose histories were not (\"asymptomatic\"). RESULTS: Sixteen of the symptomatic (73 percent) and none of the asymptomatic patients were found to have clinically significant sleep apnea syndrome (p less than 0.02). Both female patients and patients with chronic renal insufficiency had sleep apnea. In nine of these 16 cases, the disorder was primarily of the obstructive type. CONCLUSION: These preliminary data raise the possibility of an association of chronic renal disease and the sleep apnea syndrome, and suggest that some of the daytime sleepiness and disturbed nocturnal sleep in such patients may be related to sleep apnea. They also indicate that questioning patients with chronic renal disease and symptoms suggestive of a sleep disorder is useful in determining who are at high risk for the sleep apnea syndrome. Further study is required to establish a causal relationship between chronic renal disease and the sleep apnea syndrome, and to determine the prevalence of the latter in patients with end-stage renal disease.\r"

The mutant enzyme is characterized by abnormal electrophoretic mobility, thermolability, Km for NADP, abnormal deamino NADP use and a decreased sensitivity to inhibition by NADPH. G-6-PD activity of hemolysate, as measured under optimal in vitro conditions, was not initially decreased, whereas fibroblasts, granulocytes, and platelets showed a markedly decreased level of enzyme activity. These properties identify G6PD Titusville as a unique variant of this X-linked, housekeeping enzyme. We conclude that although the propositus with G6PD Titusville had a transient hemolytic episode, we cannot be certain whether this association was a causative one.\r"

A relationship was sought between these acute variations of the stenotic lumen and the clinical response to treatment with the same drug (20 mg four times daily). Treatment efficacy was evaluated with exercise testing in group 1 and Holter monitoring in group 2. In group 1 the residual segment of stenotic diameter showed an increase, decrease, or no change with the calcium antagonist. Nifedipine failed to improve 40% of the cases (21% unchanged and 19% worsened) in group 1. In the same group of patients, the responses to exercise tests were dissociated from the acute vasomotor pattern. Changes in the pressure-rate product also did not explain the clinical results. In group 2 the majority of lesions had compliant portions, which invariably reacted to nifedipine with dilatation. All patients with the Prinzmetal form had relief of the anginal episodes with treatment. These data suggest that the therapeutic efficacy of nifedipine in classic effort angina probably is the net result of influences on the myocardial oxygen consumption and supply, and the acute coronary vasomotor pattern does not allow to predict the clinical response. Stenotic lesions in the Prinzmetal form possess a distinct sensitivity to the relaxant action of calcium channel blockade, which reasonably explains the highly positive response to treatment.\r"

Covariate analysis found that patient survival on dialysis therapy was not influenced by race, sex, or marital status. Patients more than 60 years of age and patients with renal failure secondary to diabetes mellitus or hypertension had the worst survival on dialysis. Patients entering into CAPD were associated with diminished survival when compared to HHD but not to LCD. The ability of the initial dialysis technique to maintain a person on dialysis was not different when patients were matched for age, race, and etiology of renal failure. Only a randomized prospective trial will answer the question as to whether continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis can maintain a patient at home as long as home hemodialysis.\r"

Illustrations include pretesting and planning of research, collection of data and translation of instruments, instrumentation of measures, and analysis and interpretation of data.

The authors identified cases in which mental health was an issue in seven Montana counties for 3 years before and 3 years after the 1979 reform. They found that acquittals based on the insanity plea markedly declined, but that dismissals based on incompetence to stand trial increased substantially following the reform. They conclude that dismissal based on incompetence to stand trial became a substitute for acquittal based on the insanity plea under mens rea.\r"

Both small uninucleated and large multinucleated EE schizonts were found in 5-day-old cultures. A mouse monoclonal antibody to the repeat region of the P. cynomolgi CS protein densely labeled the plasma membrane and surface of 5-day-old EE schizonts as well as the surrounding parasitophorous vacuole membrane and space. Density of labeling decreased significantly as EE schizonts increased in size and maturity. Labeling of large, multinucleated 5-day-old schizonts was sparse and limited to the surface of EE schizonts and to small patches of electron dense material which were attached to the inner surface of the parasitophorous vacuole membrane. Mature 8-day-old EE schizonts with developing merozoites had little detectable labeling. CS antigen was not associated with internal structures within developing schizonts. Labeling was not observed in the host cell cytoplasm or on the surface of infected hepatocytes. These findings indicate that epitopes associated with the repeat region of the P. cynomolgi circumsporozoite protein are sequestered within infected host cells during EE development.\r"

  ".W": "Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) plays an important pathogenic role in infections caused by several microorganisms and has been implicated in host cell invasion. The mechanism of host cell penetration by the intracellular protozoan Toxoplasma gondii involves several steps; we have investigated the role of PLA2 in cellular invasion by the tachyzoite stage of this parasite. We assayed T. gondii invasion of human fibroblast monolayers by measurement of the selective incorporation of 3H-uracil into growing intracellular parasites. Exogenous PLA2 from snake venom (Naja naja) increased the penetration of fibroblasts by T. gondii, while horse antiserum to Naja hannah venom inhibited penetration. An irreversible PLA2 inhibitor, p-bromophenacyl bromide, blocked penetration without metabolically disabling the parasite. When host fibroblasts were preincubated with this drug, penetration was not affected, supporting a role for parasite rather than host cell PLA2 in the penetration process. Another PLA2 inhibitor, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, also inhibited penetration. We assayed extracellular T. gondii tachyzoites, purified from host cell debris, for PLA2 activity by radiometric detection of fatty acid release from labeled Escherichia coli membranes. Sonically disrupted parasites contained a low level of calcium-dependent PLA2 with maximum activity at pH 8.5-9.0. These experiments suggest that a phospholipase is implicated in T. gondii host cell invasion.\r"

The dose of Sb expected to kill 50% of promastigotes and amastigotes of the parent sensitive clone (WR 669) and the resistant clone (WR 669R) was determined by exposure of suspensions in physiologic salt solution for 3 hr. The approximate Ed50s in microgram Sb/ml were: 10,000 for WR 669R promastigotes; 7,000 for WR 669R amastigotes; 200 for WR 669 promastigotes; and 150 for WR 669 amastigotes. Thus, Sb resistance and Sb sensitivity expressed by promastigote clones are also expressed by their respective amastigotes. Studies with 125Sb-Pentostam showed that WR 669R amastigote resistance was not due to altered Sb uptake over 1 hr. When amastigotes pretreated with Pentostam were incubated with 14C labeled metabolic precursors, susceptibility to Sb was correlated with inhibition of glycolytic enzymes and of fatty acid beta-oxidation.\r"

HBsAg was found in 18.7%, and seropositivity for any hepatitis marker (HBsAg, anti-HBs, or anti-HBc) was found in 63.9%. The prevalence of HBsAg was highest in subjects less than 5 years of age (32.3%). Seropositivity for any hepatitis marker increased from 48.4% in subjects less than 5 years to 88.5% in persons greater than or equal to 50 years of age. HBeAg was present in 70% of HBsAg-positive women of childbearing age. Residence in Khalawaat and parenteral therapy for malaria were found to be independent risk factors for HBsAg-positivity. Age, residence in Khalawaat, crowding, and having had a tattoo were predictive of seropositivity for any hepatitis marker.

  ".W": "In this study, we sought to identify changes in the picture of a selected surgical condition during an interval of time that has brought about radical departures from previously established policies and programs. As a direct consequence, the patients take a more circuitous route to the surgeon. A significant number of patients with acute appendicitis in 1986 (37 percent) and 1987 (29 percent) suffered a prolonged delay in hospitalization or surgical referral compared with patients in 1980. This delay was accompanied by a more advanced stage of disease that ultimately caused a markedly increased morbidity (13 percent in 1986 and 24 percent in 1987, compared with 5 percent in 1980) and subsequent extended length of stay. This deterioration in patient care and failure at cost containment had previously been examined for conditions that can be operated electively. This study documents that the constraints also affect the treatment of patients whose initial condition requires urgent operative treatment. With specific relation to patients with acute appendicitis, surgeons recognize the value of the negative appendectomy. It appears the so-called gatekeepers must find a way to accept a certain negative hospitalization to referral rate. If current constraints will not allow this, the policies and programs behind the constraints should be changed.\r"

Seven patients (7 percent) developed prolonged early postoperative gastric atony. Six of the 71 patients (8 percent) who had truncal vagotomy had atony, whereas only 1 of the 30 patients (3 percent) with proximal gastric vagotomy had atony (p = 0.08). The atony resolved with medical management in all patients after a median of 23 days. At follow-up (median 3 years), 74 percent of patients with truncal vagotomy had an excellent or good result compared with 86 percent of those with proximal gastric vagotomy (p greater than 0.1). The conclusion was that prolonged early postoperative gastric atony occurs uncommonly after vagotomy for obstructing peptic ulcer. Preservation of antropyloric innervation by using proximal gastric vagotomy instead of truncal vagotomy may be helpful, but does not completely prevent the atony.\r"

The results were compared with the emptying data of operated patients without bezoars. The gastric retention of Tc 99m-labelled solids at 45, 75, and 105 minutes was 85 +/- 15 percent (mean +/- SD), 79 +/- 17 percent, and 65 +/- 24 percent, respectively. No differences were found when results were compared with those of operated patients without bezoars.

Postoperatively, the diameter of the positive skin test area decreased in each of 10 patients without ranitidine (p less than 0.006) but increased in 9 and was unchanged in 1 of the ranitidine-treated patients (p less than 0.01). The skin test changes were similar during the two tests in ranitidine-treated surgical patients and the nonoperative control subjects. Ranitidine did not amplify the response in the nonoperated group. The potential role of histamine blockade in reversal of other aspects of postoperative immunosuppression and reduction in the risk of infection should be explored.\r"

Most patients had multiple organ involvement and were on some form of systemic therapy at the time of surgery. Thirty-seven postoperative complications were confined to 20 of these cases. Comparing this complicated group with the remaining 16 uncomplicated cases, the patients in the former group had a higher mean dose of steroid preoperatively, more organ involvement by SLE, and more frequent renal involvement; a higher percentage of the cases in this group were emergent rather than elective. The majority of factors examined failed to show predictive value in the outcome of surgery in lupus patients. We conclude that surgical complications are frequent in SLE patients and have identified four factors predictive of increased morbidity.\r"

Patient characteristics and presenting symptoms were similar in single and synchronous carcinomas. The frequency of patients with associated benign neoplasms was significantly higher than that in the parent series. An examination of the modified Dukes' classification stage of the lesion in each patient revealed a higher incidence of lymph node involvement and a greater frequency of mucinous adenocarcinoma in patients with synchronous carcinomas. The 5-year survival of patients with synchronous growths did not differ from that of patients with single lesions, even when classified by Dukes' stage. Preoperative diagnosis was difficult, being achieved in no more than 30 percent of patients. Because of the poor accuracy of barium studies, total colonoscopy is the method of choice for this evaluation. We adopted a conservative surgical policy backed by life-long follow-up.\r"

Most surgeons who advocate nondrainage after cholecystectomy also routinely obliterate the gallbladder bed. The theoretic considerations are a decrease in post-operative drainage and avoidance of adhesions to the liver. To evaluate the validity of the first consideration, 88 patients undergoing elective cholecystectomy were randomly allocated into two groups. In the first group, the gallbladder bed was reperitonealized whereas in the second group, the raw surface was left uncovered. No significant difference in the amount of postcholecystectomy drainage could be demonstrated in the two groups of patients studied.\r"

Preliminary clinical, angiographic, and noninvasive laboratory parameters suggest that there is a significant reduction of both residual technical defects and early recurrent stenosis. Specifically, no perioperative thrombosis or early restenosis was encountered in the 98 endarterectomies. Furthermore, only two technical defects have been noted, and one of these occurred in one patient who required a longitudinal arteriotomy and attendant suture line when the common carotid artery was transected too proximally and the eversion maneuver could not be accomplished. Serial long-term clinical and noninvasive laboratory follow-up evaluation, in addition to indicated postoperative angiography, will continue in an effort to assess the durability of a technical approach to carotid endarterectomy that may minimize residual defects and early restenosis.\r"

Diligent follow-up is essential for verifying the true results of hernia surgery techniques. Such follow-up requires that the surgeon be dedicated to examining his patients for many years, as well as to understanding, recording, and referencing the exact anatomic and functional defects found and the repairs used to correct them. Only with these factors identified and recorded can there be a basis for meaningful reporting and valuable conclusions. The classification of inguinal hernias presented here is intended to provide surgeons an opportunity to better evaluate their own methods and to more clearly communicate results with colleagues.

This parameter was measured by recording the maximum force required to push a curved surgical needle through a thin laminated synthetic membrane. Three comparable groups of reversed cutting-edge needles were selected from different manufacturers for needle penetration testing. The results of this testing demonstrated that the needle diameter, manufacturing process, and the manufacturer were all important determinants of needle sharpness. Needles with a smaller diameter were sharper than those with a larger diameter. In addition, electrohoned or hand-honed needles were sharper than those subjected to only machine grinding. When comparably sized needles were compared, Ethicon manufactured the sharpest needles, followed by Davis & Geck and Deknatel needles. Scanning electron microscopic photographs and elemental analysis of the surgical needles could be correlated with their sharpness. The sharper needles had long, narrow cutting edge geometries compared with the short wide geometries of duller needles. The sharpest needles were fabricated from an American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) 45500 stainless steel alloy that has stronger tensile and yield strengths than those of ASTM 42000 and 42020 alloys used in the creation of the other needles. This stronger alloy allows the manufacturer to produce a longer, narrower cutting point geometry with reduced danger of either bending or breakage during surgery compared with needles made from weaker alloys (ASTM 42000 and ASTM 42020), which accounts for the superior sharpness of the Ethicon surgical needles.\r"

Morphine and clonidine were administered intrathecally (i.t.) by lumbar puncture to rats either alone or in the presence of either i.t. yohimbine, an alpha 2 antagonist, or systemic naloxone, an opioid antagonist. The effect of tolerance to systematically administered morphine on responses to i.t. morphine and clonidine was examined in mice. Antinociception was determined by observing the response to a clamp applied to the tail (Haffner test) in mice and by the tail-flick test in rats; log dose-response curves for antinociception were generated for morphine, clonidine, and each drug combination. Morphine and clonidine both produced dose-dependent antinociception when given i.t. in both species. The i.t. administration of yohimbine attenuated the antinociceptive effect of both clonidine and morphine, but naloxone attenuated only the response to morphine. Further, a sub-analgetic dose of i.t. clonidine potentiated the effect of i.t. morphine. In morphine-tolerant mice, i.t. morphine was not efficacious whereas clonidine retained full efficacy, although potency was slightly diminished. Thus, it appears that alpha 2 adrenoceptor-mediated antinociception is independent of opiate receptor mechanisms. Clinical use of intrathecal combinations of alpha 2 adrenergic and opiate receptor agonists to increase analgesia and use of intrathecal alpha 2 agonists for pain relief in patients tolerant to opiates might deserve evaluation.\r"

  ".W": "A rat model was used to determine whether isoflurane exacerbates liver dysfunction and whether its metabolism is changed in the presence of cirrhosis. Male Wistar rats were gavaged weekly with carbon tetrachloride until cirrhosis was well advanced. They and control rats without pretreatment with carbon tetrachloride and without cirrhosis were then exposed to 1.45% (1 MAC) isoflurane for 3 hours. Blood and urine samples were taken before, immediately, as well as 4, 24, 48, and 72 hours after anesthesia to measure liver function and isoflurane defluorination. After the last samples had been obtained, the rats were sacrificed and the liver removed for histologic examination and in vitro metabolic studies. Serum levels of SGOT and SGPT and inorganic fluoride production in rats with cirrhosis were similar to those in control rats without cirrhosis. Concentrations of cytochromes b5 and p-450 and specific activities of microsomal defluorinase and several cytosolic enzymes were significantly lower in cirrhotic than in noncirrhotic liver, but their total amounts in whole liver were the same. The results imply that cirrhosis does not increase the risk of acute hepatotoxicity of isoflurane. They also demonstrate that metabolism of isoflurane and perhaps other volatile anesthetics may be unaffected in rats with cirrhosis, even though liver architecture is severely disrupted.\r"

Lidocaine and tetrodotoxin decreased the square of the conduction velocity in proportion to the decrease in Vmax. In contrast, halothane and enflurane only slightly affected Vmax, but decreased the conduction velocity in a concentration-dependent manner. These results suggest that these volatile anesthetics affect conduction velocity by a mechanism different from that of fast sodium channel blockers. Caution should be used when these anesthetics are administered to patients receiving class 1 antiarrhythmic agents or who have pre-existing intraventricular conduction disease.\r"

Induction time was 120 seconds with midazolam and 111 seconds with thiopental. There were significant differences with regard to diastolic blood pressure. Side effects occurred with approximately equal frequencies, but vomiting was significantly more frequent after thiopental. Perivenous tenderness and erythema occurred in four patients, all after thiopental.

The posterior approaches of Dekrey at L3 (n = 20) and Chayen at L4-5 (n = 20) proved similarly effective in producing blockade of the femoral, obturator, and lateral femoral cutaneous nerves, as well as the nerves to the psoas muscle. The anterior approach of Winnie (femoral sheath or 3-in-1 block) using paresthesia (n = 20) or peripheral nerve stimulation (n = 20) proved effective in producing blockade of the femoral and lateral femoral cutaneous nerves, but ineffective for obturator nerve blockade. None of the four techniques produced blockade of the sacral plexus. Perhaps our means of assessing blockade (motor) is what produced the difference between our findings and those of others.\r"

This level of sedation was then maintained with a variable-rate infusion of either methohexital 180 +/- 65 mg/hr, etomidate 32 +/- 12 mg/hr, or midazolam 7.5 +/- 4 mg/hr (mean dose +/- SD) To maintain a stable level of sedation, changes in the maintenance infusion rate were required more frequently with methohexital (4.6 +/- 3 times) than with etomidate (2.6 +/- 2 times) or midazolam (2.7 +/- 3 times). Decreases in oxygen saturation below 95% were more frequent with midazolam than with methohexital and etomidate, while recall of intraoperative events was less frequent after midazolam. Observer evaluations found less sedation in the methohexital and etomidate groups than in the midazolam group during the early postoperative period. However, the patients' evaluation of residual sedative effects (e.g., postoperative sedation visual analogue scores) and discharge times from the recovery room were similar in all three groups. Nevertheless, patients given midazolam had significantly greater impairment of performance on the digit-symbol substitution test in the early postoperative period than did patients given either methohexital or etomidate.\r"

Adequate neuromuscular relaxation permitted successful intubation at 5 minutes for doxacurium 50 micrograms/kg and at 4 minutes for 80 micrograms/kg.

Either neostigmine 45 micrograms/kg, neostigmine 60 micrograms/kg, or edrophonium 1000 micrograms/kg was given for reversal when T1 had spontaneously recovered to 25% of baseline level, T1 being the first response to repetitive train-of-four (TOF) stimuli (2 Hz for 2 seconds at 10-second intervals) expressed as percent of baseline level. The T4:T1 ratio is the amplitude of the fourth twitch relative to the first twitch in a TOF stimulus expressed as a ratio. T1 rapidly achieved 90% of baseline in 5-10 minutes after reversal of neuromuscular blockade. In contrast, the T4:T1 ratio lagged, recovering to a mean of 0.6 at 20 minutes when T1 was over 90% of baseline. Recovery patterns were not statistically significantly different (unpaired t-test) among the three reversal regimens. Therefore, the reversal data were pooled.

  ".W": "Previous pharmacologic studies indicating competitive interactions between adenosine and nifedipine at the adenosine vascular receptor suggest that adenosine may be a less effective hypotensive drug after pretreatment with nifedipine. This hypothesis was tested in 18 pentobarbital-anesthetized, open-chest dogs by evaluating the hypotensive effects and regional hemodynamic responses to 60-minute intravenous adenosine infusions before and after bolus injection of nifedipine (20 micrograms/kg, IV). Regional blood flow was measured with 15-microns radioactive microspheres. Before nifedipine, infusion of adenosine at a rate of 126 +/- 30 mumol/min caused a 50% reduction in mean aortic pressure that in the presence of no change in aortic blood flow was attributable to a proportional decrease in systemic vascular resistance. These systemic effects were associated with heterogeneous changes in regional blood flow; blood flow decreased in the renal cortex (-68%), pancreas (-50%), spleen (-77%), and skin (-61%); increased in the left (+112%) and right (+265%) ventricular myocardium; and did not change significantly in the duodenum, liver, skeletal muscle, or brain. Nifedipine did not alter the dose requirement or time course of the adenosine-induced hypotensive response or affect the associated systemic hemodynamic changes. Furthermore, nifedipine caused only minor alterations in the regional blood flow changes during adenosine-induced hypotension. Apparently the high plasma levels of adenosine required for controlled hypotension in the present study were sufficient to overcome the blocking influence of nifedipine at the adenosine vascular receptor. The study demonstrates that the hypotensive action of adenosine remains unimpaired after pretreatment with nifedipine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this paper we studied infants delivered by elective and nonelective cesarean section at the Winnipeg Women's Hospital from 1975 to 1983 (n = 3940) to determine the effect of anesthetic technique on neonatal outcomes. A trained anesthesia nurse interviewed all parturients and reviewed their antepartum, labor and delivery, and anesthesia records. Assessments of neonatal outcomes were based on 1- and 5-minute Apgar scores, need for positive pressure oxygen by mask or intubation, and neonatal deaths (within 30 days). These outcomes were determined in three subgroups of neonates delivered by cesarean section: those delivered by elective section, those delivered by urgent cesarean section for dystocia or failure of labor to progress, and those delivered by section because of fetal distress. Overall, 12.5% of the infants had 1-minute Apgar scores of 4 or less, and 1.4% had 5-minute Apgar scores of 4 or less. Neonates born to mothers given general anesthesia had worse outcomes than those born to mothers given regional anesthesia. Among neonates delivered after elective section, general anesthesia was associated with a higher incidence of low Apgar scores at 1 minute. In neonates delivered by nonelective section, general anesthesia was associated with higher rates of low Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes as well as greater requirements for intubation and artificial ventilation. There were no differences seen in neonatal death rates with general and regional anesthesia in the three groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In a double-blind fashion, all patients received 3 ml (7.5 mg) of either solution in the lateral decubitus position with the operated side up, the table being kept horizontal for 30 minutes after injection. The mean highest sensory levels in both groups, and in both operated and non-operated sides in the same group, were comparable, ranging between T7 and T8.5. Duration of analgesia was 134 minutes with tetracaine and 130 minutes with bupivacaine (NS). In both groups, motor blockade was satisfactory in 29/30 patients on the operated side. The frequency of a decrease in systolic blood pressure of more than 30% was similar in the two groups. The authors conclude that hypobaric solutions of both tetracaine and bupivacaine are suitable for surgical repair of hip fractures in geriatric patients and produce comparable anesthetic and hemodynamic effects.\r"

The studies were performed in 24 open-chest dogs during basal anesthesia with a narcotic. Myocardial blood flow (MBF) was measured using radioactive microspheres, myocardial surface tissue PO2 by means of a platinum multiwire surface electrode. One control group and three experimental groups were studied: enflurane (1.1 vol%), isoflurane (0.7 vol%, both end-tidal concentrations), and dipyridamole (0.4 mg/kg). Mean arterial pressure significantly decreased to an average of 70 mm Hg in all three experimental groups. Although MBF was unchanged during enflurane (-18%) and isoflurane (+20%), it increased during dipyridamole (+304% p less than 0.05 vs baseline and control, enflurane, and isoflurane groups). Myocardial oxygen consumption decreased significantly during enflurane and isoflurane but remained unchanged during dipyridamole. Thus, the ratio between myocardial oxygen delivery and consumption increased 6% with enflurane (p less than 0.05 vs baseline), 47% with isoflurane (p less than 0.05 vs baseline and control group) and 280% with dipyridamole (p less than 0.05 vs baseline and control, enflurane, and isoflurane groups). Coronary venous PO2 remained unchanged during enflurane but increased significantly during isoflurane and dipyridamole. Left ventricular surface tissue PO2 was unchanged in enflurane and isoflurane animals and decreased slightly, yet significantly, during dipyridamole. All variables remained unchanged in the control group. Thus, isoflurane and dipyridamole interfered with MBF autoregulation and increased myocardial oxygen delivery out of proportion to myocardial demands.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirty patients were randomly assigned to three groups to receive oral cimetidine 300 mg or ranitidine 150 mg or no H2-antagonist the night before surgery and again 1-2 hours prior to induction of anesthesia. Succinylcholine (1.5 mg/kg i.v.) was given to facilitate tracheal intubation after induction of anesthesia; neuromuscular function was monitored by evoked compound electromyogram. Pretreatment blood samples were analyzed for PChE activity. PChE activity and levels of appropriate H2-antagonists were measured in preinduction blood samples. No significant effect of either cimetidine or ranitidine on the duration of action of SCh or PChE activity was demonstrated. We conclude that H2-antagonists administered preoperatively do not prolong the duration of action of succinylcholine or alter PChE activity.\r"

The catheters were inserted in dogs anesthetized with isoflurane (1.7%, inspired) and N2O (66%) in O2 and placed in the sitting position with the head 90 degrees to the horizontal. Swan-Ganz catheters were positioned with the right atrial (RA) port just above the junction of the superior vena cava (SVC) and the RA and the pulmonary artery (PA) port in the pulmonary artery. The Arrow and Bunegin-Albin multi-orifice catheters were placed with the proximal orifice just above the SVC-RA junction and the distal orifice near the mid-RA. Dogs were then given a predetermined lethal dose of air (5 ml.kg-1) over 30 sec via the jugular vein. Attempts to aspirate venous air emboli were begun with the first decrease in expired CO2. Both RA and PA ports of the Swan-Ganz catheter were used for aspiration. The amounts of gas retrieved expressed as a percent of the injected air and the incidence of successful resuscitation were compared. Significantly greater percentages of injected venous air were retrieved with the Bunegin-Albin catheter (63 +/- 14%, mean +/- SEM) than with the Arrow multi-orifice catheter (6 +/- 2%) or the Swan-Ganz catheter (14 +/- 5%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Analgesia was evaluated by the maximal tolerance to a spring-loaded rod on the tibia and manubrium. Analgesic assessments and arterial blood samples were taken prior to and at set time intervals following drug administration. Pentamorphone produced a linear increase in pain tolerance with increasing dose as well as a dose-dependent depression of ventilation. Pentamorphone had no effect on blood pressure or heart rate in the doses used. Plasma histamine levels at 5 minutes were not elevated with any of the dosages. Pentamorphone appears to be an analgesic with clinically tolerable side effects in the range 0.12 to 0.24 microgram.kg-1 that merits further evaluation under clinical conditions.\r"

Spinal evoked potentials were used to measure spinal cord conduction and enabled us to time the measurement of SCBF associated with maximum reduction in latency and amplitude of spinal evoked potentials produced by instillation of 5 ml of 2% lidocaine in the epidural space. We used the radioactive microsphere technique to quantitate SCBF in the cervical, upper thoracic, lower thoracic, and lumbar regions of the spinal cord. A narcotic/relaxant technique was used to eliminate SCBF changes associated with other anesthetic agents. Other parameters known to affect SCBF were kept constant and within normal physiologic values. As compared with saline solution controls, there were significant decreases in SCBF in all the four areas of spinal cord in animals given epidural lidocaine, most marked in the lumbar area.\r"

The optimal dose of butorphanol combined with 8.5 to 10 ml 0.25% bupivacaine was 2 mg; with 2 mg, the duration of analgesia was significantly greater and the time to onset of analgesia significantly shorter than when no butorphanol was added, and the amount of bupivacaine could be reduced 50%. Adverse fetal effects were not observed except that of a low amplitude sinusoidal fetal heart rate pattern with doses of 3 mg butorphanol. All neonatal observations were normal. It is concluded that epidural butorphanol can be a useful and safe adjunct to bupivacaine used for epidural analgesia during labor.\r"

Both the quality of analgesia and the incidence of side effects were documented. Compared with patients receiving PCA morphine, patients given epidural morphine reported significantly lower pain scores both at rest (0.7 +/- 1.1 versus 3.4 +/- 2.1, P less than 0.01) and with mobilization (3.2 +/- 2.1 versus 6.1 +/- 2.1, P less than 0.01). Although patients receiving epidural morphine had a greater incidence of urinary retention, there were no significant differences in the incidence of nausea or pruritus. There was no respiratory depression in either group. We conclude that epidural morphine provides superior analgesia with a clinically inconsequential increase in side effects. Further, epidural morphine may have special advantages when early mobilization is indicated.\r"

The epidural group (N = 20) received continuous epidural anesthesia with bupivacaine postoperatively for 26-30 hours and the control group (N = 20) received intermittent injections of ketobemidone for postoperative pain relief. Postoperative bowel movements and propulsive colonic motility were estimated from the first passage of flatus and feces and by following radiopaque markers by serial abdominal radiographs. In the epidural group, the times for first passing of flatus (31 +/- 22 hours; mean +/- SD) and feces (70 +/- 44 hours) were significantly shorter than in the control group (flatus 58 +/- 14 hours and feces 103 +/- 26 hours). The average position of the markers was significantly more distally in the epidural group immediately after operation and the markers continued to move forward during the first postoperative day. In the control group, the markers did not move during this period. The results demonstrate that postoperative bowel peristalsis returned earlier in the patients given epidural analgesia with bupivacaine for pain relief than in patients given a narcotic.\r"

The respiratory effects of this system and sedation with midazolam were studied in 70 awake patients anesthetized with epidural blockade. On immersion, surface abdominal pressure and respiratory frequency (f) increased. Tidal volume (VT) and arterial saturation (SaO2) decreased. After intravenous midazolam 0.045 mg/kg body weight, VT decreased further to 35% below pre-immersion values and stone excursions measured by fluoroscopy diminished by more than 50%; reduction of VT and stone excursions were linearly correlated (R = 0.45). SaO2 declined sharply to 6.1% (range -1.5-13.8%) below pre-immersion values, whereas end-tidal CO2 (PETCO2) increased more slowly and f remained above the pre-immersion rate. In three patients, SaO2 decreased to below 85% but was rapidly restored to 98-100% by oxygen administration. The respiratory effects of sedative drugs are exaggerated by the Dornier HM3 system, and continuous monitoring of gas exchange and appropriate oxygen administration are recommended in patients receiving regional anesthesia and sedation.\r"

In tandem the development of various implantable narcotic delivery systems has complemented and facilitated the expanded role of intraspinal narcotics in the treatment of cancer pain. Appropriate patient selection is crucial if optimal results are to be achieved. Factors to be considered in patient selection should include the results of the preimplantation spinal narcotic trial, infection trial, infection and local conditions, hematologic status, physiologic and behavioral abnormalities, cost, patient support systems and life expectancy. By interfacing these factors with the unique profiles that each of the five types of implantable narcotic delivery systems offer, improved results both in terms of pain relief and patient satisfaction can be expected.\r"

Changes in the amplitude of the first heart sound were found to correlate closely with changes in the maximum rate of rise of left ventricular pressure (r = 0.9551, 0.001). P less than 0.001). Simultaneous changes in cardiac output and arterial pressure also occurred. Cardiac depression from anesthetics and/or disease is a major concern during anesthesia. Perioperative phonocardiography, a simple and noninvasive procedure, merits further investigation as a possible monitor of cardiac performance.\r"

This study was conducted to determine the distribution of house dust mites in houses of mite-sensitive asthmatic children and normals, the species of mites in various house dust samples, the seasonal prevalence, and the relation between the content of mite allergen and the mite density in dusts. Serial samples were collected every month between February 1986 and January 1987 from 61 houses of mite-allergic patients and nine normals. About 1 m2 surface area each of (A) family couch, (B) TV room floor carpet, (C) mattress, and (D) bed room floor carpet was vacuumed for one minute. The flotation method was used to collect mites in dusts and mites were counted under an inverted phase contrast microscope. Identification of house dust mite species was also performed. The RAST inhibition method was used for assay of mite allergen in dust extracts. The results showed the following six points. (1) Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (DP) was the dominant species found in house dust in the Taipei area (78.8%). (2) The mean number of mites was greater in August through November and lowest in July. (3) The content of mite allergen did not correlate with the number of mites in dust sample. (4) The average number of mites in patients' houses was not different from that in normals' houses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To determine whether mast cell degranulation is involved in sulfite sensitivity, we performed single-blind, placebo-controlled oral aqueous challenges with potassium metabisulfite in 13 patients with histories suggestive of sulfite sensitivity. Ten patients were also skin tested with potassium metabisulfite at 10 mg/mL and all had negative reactions. Serum samples were obtained from all the patients before the challenge and for 180 minutes after the challenge. The samples were tested for the presence of neutrophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis, using both a 51chromium microchamber chemotaxis assay and a leukocyte polarization technique. Six of 13 patients had positive challenges as defined by a fall equal to or greater than 20% in their forced expiratory volume in one second. No significant increase in neutrophil chemotactic factor activity was detected in the postchallenge serum samples from patients who experienced positive or negative challenges. We conclude that sensitivity to aqueous metabisulfite is not associated with mast cell degranulation in metabisulfite skin test-negative patients.\r"

All the children had reduced basal forced expiratory flow (FEV1) and bronchial reversibility of at least 20% after inhalation of salbutamol. The study had a double-blind design with a crossover technique. The inhaled dose of ipratropium bromide solution was increased stepwise from 25 micrograms to 500 micrograms and saline was used as the placebo. FEV1 was recorded 20, 40, and 60 minutes after inhalation of the test solution. At the lower ipratropium bromide dose levels no bronchodilatory effect was seen, but 60 minutes after the inhalation of 500 micrograms ipratropium bromide the increase in the FEV1 was significantly greater than that after placebo. Additional inhalation of salbutamol caused no further rise in FEV1. At the 500-micrograms level a fall in the heart rate was noted. No side effects occurred. We concluded that ipratropium bromide has bronchodilatory properties in childhood asthma when given in sufficiently high doses.\r"

The mean number of wheezing crises per year was significantly higher for the children living in polluted areas (10.4 versus 7.69). In addition, incidence of severe asthma (types II, III, and IV) in children living in polluted areas was markedly increased whereas the slight form of asthma (type I) was more frequent in children living in non-polluted areas. No correlation, however, between the wheezing episodes and levels of atmospheric contaminants (fumes and SO2) was detected when a group of 84 extrinsic asthmatic children living in polluted areas was studied longitudinally for a year. The data indicate that air pollution, as an isolated agent, plays a transient role in the appearance of wheezing episodes in subjects with extrinsic asthma. Results also suggest that the air pollution may potentiate wheezing episodes via alternative mechanisms.\r"

There were significant differences in linear reactivity between the N and the three asthmatics but no difference among the three asthmatic groups. On the other hand, both timed and log reactivities showed significant differences between the three asthmatic groups. Log and timed reactivities corrected by baseline Grs did not differentiate the YAL from the YAH but showed a significant difference between the YAH and OAH. This study suggests that timed and log reactivities may be better indices of bronchial reactivity than linear reactivity because they differentiate asthmatics, and that bronchial reactivity in asthmatics may be dependent on not only baseline airway caliber in asthmatics but also other factors such as atopic status or age.\r"

During the steady-state period after 15 days of treatment, serum theophylline levels were measured one and two hours after dosing and then every two hours until 9 PM the following day. The peak concentration (mean +/- SD) of serum theophylline (20.9 +/- 6.5 micrograms/mL) was observed eight hours after dosing while the through concentration (4.34 +/- 2.62 micrograms/mL) was measured 24 hours after dosing; the percent fluctuation (mean +/- SD) was 966.45 +/- 1105.55%. Another 15 children were treated with the same preparation administered at 8 AM after breakfast and at 8 PM after supper. Serum samples for theophylline concentration were obtained immediately before dosing at 8 AM and then every two hours for the following 12 hours. The mean theophylline level observed immediately before dosing at 8 AM was 10.16 +/- 3.84 micrograms/mL while the mean level at 8 PM was 9.39 +/- 4.77 micrograms/mL. The peak serum level was 13.07 +/- 5.13 micrograms/mL at 2 PM, while the trough was 9.31 +/- 3.71 micrograms/mL at 10 AM, with a percent fluctuation of 155.21 +/- 147.95%. Few side effects were seen in both groups. The results of our study clearly demonstrated that in children the percent fluctuation and peak-trough differences are far greater with once daily than with twice daily dosing and this should be considered when planning theophylline treatment in asthmatic children. The administration of a once-a-day preparation every 8-12 hours can however result in overlapping absorption patterns.\r"

The results of analyses showed large variations depending both on the method and the reference protein used. More than 2-fold variations in the protein content were obtained using Bradford's protein binding method. In the present communication the protein contents of these birch IS-candidates were reestimated by Lowry, a modified Lowry technique, Bradford's protein-dye binding, bicinchoninic acid reagent and amino acid compositions. Great variations were obtained for the protein contents, depending on the technique employed, emphasizing the difficulties of choosing a proper method of protein analyses of pollen allergens. The Lowry and the bicinchoninic acid reagent methods gave the highest obtained protein estimates, while the modified Lowry and Bradford's protein-dye binding methods showed the lowest values. The amino acid analysis gave concentrations similar to those obtained by Lowry and bicinchoninic acid reagent methods. The Lowry method seemed to be adequate for the analysis of plant proteins. The amino acid analysis is currently the most precise method for estimation of the protein concentration irrespective of additional prosthetic groups. A serious shortcoming of the method is that it requires an amino acid analyser or other liquid chromatrographic systems, which are not commonly in laboratory use.\r"

There were seven (6.3%) deaths among the 112 immediate survivors. All deaths occurred among the 19 (17%) victims who were critically injured (ISS greater than 15), giving a mortality in this population of 37 per cent. Six (86%) of the seven deaths were associated with an initial delay in treatment. Head injury was the most common fatal injury among both immediate fatalities (71.4%) and immediate survivors (57%). Thoracic injury and burns each accounted for 29 per cent of survivor deaths. Triage efficiency, as determined by the rates of overtriage (80%) and undertriage (0), did not appear adversely to affect mortality. Critical analysis of disasters such as this can contribute to improvements in preparation and casualty care in the event of future disasters.\r"

Eight (28.6%), had head injuries and 3 (10.7%) sustained spinal cord injuries with a permanent neurologic deficit. Intrathoracic injury occurred in 2 patients (7.1%) and intraabdominal injuries occurred in 1 (3.6%). Moreover, death occurred in 3 (10.7%). Simultaneously reviewed were admissions resulting from motor vehicle accidents (MVA) and motorcycle accidents (MCA) during the same period. By comparison, the death rates (DR), fracture rates (FR), and spinal cord lesions with deficit (SLR) were significantly higher in accidents with ATVs than with MVAs or MCAs. The death rates for ATVs, MVAs, and MCAs were 10.7 per cent, 4.6 per cent, and 1.2 per cent, respectively, with significance between the MCA and ATV groups, P = .0395. The FR were 75 per cent, 53 per cent, and 65 per cent, respectively, with P = .265. SLR was found in 10.7 per cent, 2.3 per cent, and 4.4 per cent of these same groups, with P = .0001. These data suggest that ATV riders are at a higher risk for sustaining fractures, significant spinal cord injuries, or death. ATVs clearly present a health hazard to riders of all ages.\r"

  ".W": "Hematuria after blunt abdominal trauma is common with multiple organ system injuries, and many trauma centers routinely perform intravenous pyelography (IVP) on all trauma patients having any degree of hematuria. However, it has been suggested that many IVPs could be avoided if more selective criteria were used. To help determine the need for an IVP, we reviewed the records of 102 consecutive patients undergoing IVP after blunt abdominal trauma over a 17-month period. Twenty-six (25%) patients had gross hematuria. Of these, seven (27%) had abnormal IVPs, and two (7.7%) of those required urologic surgery. Seventy-six (75%) patients had microscopic hematuria. Of these, one (1.3%) had an abnormal IVP but required no urologic surgery. Thus, if IVP had been performed only when gross hematuria was present, then all surgically significant urinary tract lesions would have been recognized, and 75 per cent of these 102 patients would have been spared IVPs. We agree with others that microscopic hematuria alone is not an indication for emergency IVP in these trauma patients. However, gross hematuria or other strong clinical evidence of renal injury still mandates IVP early during the assessment of patients who have suffered blunt abdominal trauma.\r"

The groups were similar with respect to age, initial arterial operation, incidence of diabetes, and use of antibiotics and postoperative anticoagulation. Wound complications were frequent in both groups (62.5% vs. 57.1%, respectively) but outcome of these wound problems was quite different. Graft infection and anastomotic disruption were significantly less frequent in group I patients. Because fewer infected prostheses had to be removed group I patients were less likely to require high level amputations. Sartorius transposition is an effective method of protecting vascular grafts jeopardized by the high frequency of wound problems associated with early reoperation.\r"

  ".W": "Postoperative bleeding following cardiovascular procedures is troublesome and often life-threatening. The effect of heparin (H) is usually reversed with protamine sulfate (P) at the end of vascular procedures; subsequent bleeding or abnormal coagulation times are ascribed to so-called heparin rebound and are treated with extra empiric doses of P. H rebound has heretofore been described only by using biologic clotting tests, which are often abnormal postoperatively. Thus, many instances of postoperative bleeding are treated with inappropriate and dangerous doses of P in the mistaken impression that more H needs to be reversed. Using the new test for plasma H, the azure A Assay, which measures H chemically rather than biologically, 27 patients were tested after cardiac bypass surgery to determine whether H rebound truly exists. Azure A levels of H were measured before the bypass procedure and every half hour from 0-8 hours after bypass in routine coronary artery bypass patients. Tests for prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) were performed simultaneously. The azure A test was performed on 252 samples of blood in the 27 patients; only one sample drawn anytime except immediately after bypass contained measurable H (0.4%). This sample became negative for H in the ensuing 30 minutes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Intraplaque hemorrhage was present in 63 (76.8%) of 82; 46 (90.2%) of 51 in Group A had hemorrhage, in contrast to 17 (54.8%) of 31 in Group B (P less than .001). Twenty-nine (56.86%) plaques from patients in Group A had multiple hemorrhages and 22 (43.14%) had single or no hemorrhages; in contrast to two (6.45%) that had multiple hemorrhages and 29 (93.55%) that had single or no hemorrhages in patients in Group B (P less than .0005). Forty-seven plaques were removed from patients receiving antiplatelets; 43 (91.48%) of these showed hemorrhages. Of the 35 plaques that were removed from patients not receiving antiplatelets, 26 (74.2%) showed hemorrhages (P = .071). However, when the plaques were studied for multiple hemorrhages, 28 (59.5%) of 47 had multiple hemorrhages in patients receiving antiplatelet agents in contrast to 3 (8.57%) of 35 in patients receiving antiplatelet agents (P less than .00001). The authors conclude that 1) the intraplaque hemorrhage is an important and common feature in symptomatic carotid disease, 2) antiplatelets increase the incidence of plaque hemorrhages, particularly multiple hemorrhages that carry higher incidence of symptoms. Therefore the use of antiplatelet agents in certain patients with carotid artery disease is questioned.\r"

  ".W": "In a previous study the authors reported greater endothelialization and thrombus-free surface area in albumin-coated grafts compared with collagen-coated grafts after 1 month's aortic interposition. Another study was undertaken to determine whether these differences persisted after a 6-month implantation period. A 6 cm segment of either an albumin-coated [n = 6] or a collagen-coated [n = 4] graft was implanted into a canine descending thoracic aorta for 6 months. Light micrographs from multiple sections of each explanted graft were scored from 1 to 4, least to most, for tissue ingrowth, perigraft inflammation, and capsular thickness. Using computer planimetry, luminal thrombus free surface area and endothelial coverage were calculated from gross and electron photomicrographs, respectively. The results were averaged and expressed as mean +/- standard error (SEM). After 6 months, no significant differences were noted between the albumin-coated grafts and the collagen-coated grafts, both of which were durable and served equally well as scaffolds for vascular remodeling and tissue incorporation. The authors conclude that the safety, ease of handling, low porosity, low thrombogenicity, and durability of the albuminated grafts warrant their clinical trial.\r"

Most of the changes are reversible with surgery. However, in longstanding AV fistulas, irreversible degenerative changes occur in the arterial wall and result in dilatation and thrombosis. This can make late closure technically difficult. This report presents a case of peroneal AV fistula of 18 years duration. The diagnosis, management, and complications of long-standing AV fistulas are discussed.\r"
