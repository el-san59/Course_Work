  ".W": "Patient initiation of mammographic screening is one method of increasing compliance with screening mammography guidelines. A low-cost screening project using a mobile van was developed at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Analysis of the first 2,099 patients revealed that the participants were generally white (92%), more likely to have had a previous mammogram than the norm (33% in this study vs 19% in a 1986 Gallup survey), and relatively high-risk (30% having a breast cancer risk factor). The cancer detection rate was 6.2 per 1,000 women screened, with a biopsy rate of 1.3% and a positive predictive value of 48%. More than half the cancers detected were in situ lesions or invasive carcinomas smaller than 1 cm. Our results suggest that low-cost mobile mammographic screening can operate at appropriate levels of sensitivity and specificity and is well accepted by participants. Such projects require considerable preliminary planning, significant financial and time commitment by the physicians involved, and meticulous follow-up. A mammography management software system was developed to facilitate tracking of patients for routine and diagnostic follow-up studies and rapid communication of results. Although most follow-up studies and biopsies were done in the community, resistance in the medical community was significant and is perhaps the greatest impediment to such screening endeavors.\r"

Although the overall cancer mortality rate among white and nonwhite women in the South remained stable, the relative contributions of cervical and lung cancer changed considerably with time. The proportion of cancer deaths in southern women attributed to cervical cancer decreased by 50% while the proportion ascribed to lung cancer tripled. The South's cancer mortality experience differed substantially from that of the rest of the United States, which suggests that southerners diverge from residents of other parts of the United States in their risk of cancer, and in their access to and use of services for cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. This study provides information for planning strategies for the reduction of cancer mortality in the South.\r"

There was no statistically significant difference in initial blood pressure, pulse or hematocrit among the three groups. The mean injury severity score (ISS) was higher for those in groups 1 and 2 (26.8 and 25.6, respectively) versus patients in group 3 (17.9) (p). There were a total of 38 intra-abdominal injuries in 34 patients of which 21 required surgical repair. No patient in the nonoperative group required laparotomy for a missed associated intra-abdominal injury. There were a total of 15 intra-abdominal complications related to splenic management. In the observation group, seven patients ultimately required laparotomy for continued splenic bleeding. In the splenorrhaphy group, the complication rate was significantly lower versus the other two groups (p). We concluded that, if technically feasible, splenorrhaphy is a safe procedure in the multiply injured patient in the absence of hypotension and coagulopathy. Nonoperative management of blunt splenic trauma should be viewed with caution because of the high failure rate in the multiply injured patient.\r"

We have substantially modified the constant infusion biliary manometry model, successfully used in large animals, to measure contractility of the gallbladder in guinea pigs. A silicone catheter for manometry was placed in the fundus of the gallbladder of an anesthetized guinea pig, and the biliary tree was constantly infused at 0.1 milliliter per minute with normal saline solution. The intraluminal pressure of the system was continuously recorded. The model was used to demonstrate a dose-response curve to bolus administration of exogenous cholecystokinin (0.01 to 1.0 nanomole per kilogram) and also to study the actions of proglumide, an antagonist to gastrin and cholecystokinin, and CR-1409, a newer, specific cholecystokinin antagonist, on cholecystokinin-induced contraction of the gallbladder of the guinea pig in vivo. Proglumide, at a dose of 5 millimoles per kilogram, completely abolished increases in intrabiliary pressure caused by cholecystokinin (0.5 nanomole per kilogram), whereas this effect was achieved by only 5 micromoles per kilogram of CR-1409. In both, there was full recovery from cholecystokinin antagonism within one hour. CR-1409 is one thousand times more potent than proglumide against cholecystokinin-induced changes in intrabiliary pressure in vivo and appears to be a useful pharmacologic reagent to study cholecystokinin-mediated components of physiologic contraction of the gallbladder.\r"

Three patients who had had steroid therapy had suppuration postoperatively, while all of the other patients had an uneventful recovery period. Recurrence was seen in three patients who suffered from onychogryposis, which may require some other method of treatment. Complications were seen in early instances, three inclusion cysts with infection and three nail spikes. Technical error caused these complications, and these have disappeared with the use of this technique.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the changes in the management of splenic trauma, the charts of all patients with splenic injury, documented either roentgenographically or at operation, treated at the Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles from 1965 through 1985 were reviewed. One hundred and eleven patients with confirmed splenic injury were treated. Forty-one patients were seen during the first decade (1965 to 1975) and 70 during the second decade (1976 to 1985). The majority of patients were boys with a mean age of seven years. All of the patients sustained blunt abdominal trauma. During the first decade, all of the patients who had a recognized splenic injury underwent splenectomy. In the second decade, 44 patients were treated without surgical intervention. Twenty-six of the patients required surgical treatment. Splenorrhaphy was successful in 15; however, splenectomy was required in 11 patients. The patients who required surgical therapy had more complications and required more blood products than those patients who were treated nonsurgically. The overall survival rate was 95 per cent and was similar in both decades. Associated injuries, not the splenic injury, were responsible for the lethal outcome of the nonsurvivors. Although the majority of children with splenic injury can be managed nonoperatively, surgical intervention continues to be necessary in our experience in approximately 38 per cent of the patients with an over-all splenic salvage rate of 85 per cent.\r"

A rim of low signal intensity on a T1-weighted image and high signal intensity on a T2-weighted image most likely represented cerebrospinal fluid space: this finding was seen around eight tumors. No distinct rim could be identified in five tumors. Of these five, two tumors grew invasively into the brain. Although mixed features predominated in meningiomas, magnetic resonance imaging could well delineate a tumor-brain relationship in most of the cases.\r"

  ".W": "The autopsy findings of 133 patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms were reviewed: 24 (18%) had multiple aneurysms. Intraventricular hemorrhage was seen in 53 patients (40%), and intracerebral hematoma was seen in 52 (39%). Intraventricular hemorrhage was seen most frequently in patients with anterior communicating artery aneurysms [21 of 40 (53%)]. Intracerebral hematoma occurred most frequently in patients with middle cerebral artery aneurysms [11 of 28 (39%)]. Hemorrhages arising from anterior communicating artery aneurysms had two types of penetration routes into the lateral ventricle. The first was through the inferomedial portion of the frontal lobe, and the second was through the corpus callosum. The second type was poorly visualized in horizontal sections of the brain. Of 40 patients with anterior communicating artery aneurysms, the first type of penetration route was observed in 15, and the second type was found in 3. The second type is rare, and if the hemorrhage is not massive, it may be overlooked in axial computed tomography scans. Of the 109 ruptured aneurysms, 18 (17%) were 4 mm or less in diameter, 50 (46%) were 5-9 mm in diameter, and 41 (38%) were 10 mm or larger in diameter. In the 21 patients with multiple aneurysms, unruptured aneurysms were smaller than ruptured aneurysms in 17 of 27 (63%), equal size in 9 (33%), and larger in 1 (4%). Regarding rerupture, the larger the ruptured aneurysms were, the higher the percentage of rerupture, that is, 11% of 18 ruptured aneurysms of 4 mm or less in diameter, 32% of 50 of 5-9 mm in diameter, and 37% of 41 of 10 mm or larger in diameter had reruptured. It seems that the larger the size of the aneurysm, the higher the risk of rerupture as well as of initial rupture.\r"

Twenty-five patients with hemiparesis (hemiparesis group) and 13 patients with headaches only and without any neurological deficits (headache group) were examined before surgery for chronic subdural hematoma. Among the hemiparesis patients, 15 were examined after surgery. Preoperative regional cerebral blood flow values in the headache group were normal in all regions bilaterally and showed no significant regional difference in one hemisphere or interhemispheric difference between the corresponding regions in both hemispheres, whereas preoperative regional cerebral blood flow values in the hemiparesis group were generally around the lower limit of the age-matched normal value and were subnormal in some areas, and the regional cerebral blood flow values were significantly lower on the hematoma side than on the intact side in most regions. The rolandic region especially showed the lowest regional cerebral blood flow value of 32.3 in the Initial Slope Index on average and the most significant interhemispheric differences of regional cerebral blood flow. Such a preoperative reduction of regional cerebral blood flow in the hemiparesis group normalized along with clinical improvement after evacuation of the hematoma. It was suggested that localized cerebral blood flow reduction at the rolandic cortical region under the hematoma might be one of the causative factors of hemiparesis in chronic subdural hematoma.\r"

Men with hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and men who were heavy smokers were treated. We assessed stroke end points and cause-specific mortality using a stroke register and death certificates. During a mean follow-up of 11.8 years, 230 strokes occurred in the entire population sample (participants and nonparticipants) (7% subarachnoid hemorrhages, 13% intracerebral hemorrhages, 42% cerebral infarctions, and 38% unspecified strokes). Using univariate analysis, we found measured high blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), smoking, known hypertension, diabetes mellitus, stroke in either parent, severe psychological stress, marital status, atrial fibrillation, previous transient ischemic attacks, previous myocardial infarction, effort-induced chest pain, and intermittent claudication to be significantly related to all stroke. Of the stroke types, subarachnoid hemorrhage was not related to any of these indicators, and intracerebral hemorrhage was related only to measured high blood pressure. Using multivariate analyses, we found measured high blood pressure, smoking, and severe psychological stress as well as atrial fibrillation, previous transient ischemic attacks, and intermittent claudication to be independent risk factors for nonhemorrhagic stroke. Serum cholesterol concentration, occupational and leisure-time physical activity, body mass index, alcohol abuse, and low occupational class were not risk factors for stroke.\r"

Computed tomography or autopsy was obtained in 86.1% and showed an increase in the proportion with lacunar infarction, striatocapsular infarction, and parenchymal hemorrhage relative to the frequencies in Caucasians. This increase in the incidence of cerebral hemorrhage occurs not only in semicomatose and comatose patients but also in alert patients (16.9%) and those with a lacunar syndrome (12.5%). Our findings suggest that cerebrovascular disease in the Chinese selectively affects small vessels, causing lacunes and hemorrhages. In future community studies on stroke prevalence, researchers should be cautious about interpreting similar prevalence rates as reflecting similar risk factors or pathologies.\r"

The study group comprised 50% of all patients admitted for acute stroke between February 1, 1986, and January 31, 1987. Of the 129 patients, 125 returned to their own homes and four moved into an old people's home. Once they returned home, only minor changes occurred in the patients' place of residence or functional capacity. The majority of the patients (90%) were still living in their own homes after 12 months; 99% could walk independently indoors, 92-95% could climb a staircase, and 90% could manage their daily hygiene. Eight patients (6%) died during follow-up, and one fourth of the patients were hospitalized again. The average number of days of rehospitalization during the 12 months was 23. Our study may serve as a guide to the planning of stroke programs and to a more effective and efficient use of available health resources.\r"

In each patient, extremity paresis was quantified according to the five-point scoring system advised by the Medical Research Council, upper extremity function was quantified using the Barthel Index subscore for feeding and dressing the upper body, and lower extremity function was quantified according to a five-point scoring of the ability to walk. Improvement was recorded for upper extremity function in 52% of the patients and for lower extremity function in 89%. Best extremity function was reached a mean +/- SEM of 9 +/- 3 and 10 +/- 4 weeks after stroke for the upper and lower extremities, respectively. In patients experiencing complete recovery, this occurred a mean +/- SEM of 7 +/- 2 weeks (for both upper and lower extremities) after the stroke. Only 8-11% of the patients with paresis scores of less than or equal to 2 regained independent extremity function after rehabilitation. Half of the patients with paresis scores of greater than or equal to 3 regained independent extremity function after rehabilitation, while the other half were able to perform extremity function with only minimal assistance. As predictors of extremity function, the Barthel Index subscore was slightly better (r = 0.64) than paresis score (r = 0.58). However, because evaluation of extremity paresis is easy, it appears to be useful as a preliminary predictor of outcome following stroke.\r"

Among the seven patients without focal neurologic deficits, regional cerebral hypoperfusion was demonstrated in only one who died. Among the 10 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, one died before surgery, and six developed postoperative delayed ischemic deficits, of whom two died. Among the patients with angiographically documented aneurysms, regional hypoperfusion correlated with the presence and severity of delayed neurologic deficits, whereas correlative computed tomographic scans showed either early infarction or no relevant abnormality. This technique facilitates early diagnosis of cerebral tissue hypoperfusion due to vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage.\r"

We investigated intraindividual asymmetry of carotid atherosclerosis by measuring geometric aspects of the carotid bifurcation. We measured diameter stenosis, the internal carotid artery/common carotid artery area ratio, and the angle of the carotid bifurcation on 40 arteriograms. Stenosis asymmetry was significantly associated with area ratio asymmetry (r = 0.355, p less than 0.025); there was no such association between stenosis asymmetry and bifurcation angle asymmetry. Geometric factors of the carotid bifurcation, particularly the area ratio, may help explain intraindividual asymmetry in carotid atherosclerosis.\r"

The major differences between pediatric and adult patients were in regional cerebral blood volume and regional oxygen extraction fraction. Regional cerebral blood volume was more markedly increased relative to the control value in the children than in the adults. Also, regional oxygen extraction fraction was greater than control in areas with low blood flow in the children but was never increased in the adults. However, in the adults, only regional transit time was significantly prolonged relative to the control values. The increased regional oxygen extraction fraction relative to the control value observed in children with moyamoya disease may explain why transient ischemic attacks are a common symptom in this group.\r"

Conventional models for cerebral blood flow calculation employ 11 minutes of data collection. However, in many circumstances it is not possible to maintain steady-state physiologic conditions for 11 minutes. We compared a monocompartmental model that requires only 3 minutes of data collection with the bicompartmental model that requires 11 minutes of data collection. The correlation between the absolute values for global cerebral blood flow (initial slope index, intravenous method) in 72 anesthetized patients was r = 0.88; for 54 awake patients inhaling xenon-133, the correlation was r = 0.77. Cerebral blood flow was determined with intravenous xenon-133 at baseline and during a CO2 challenge in 50 patients during cerebrovascular surgery under general anesthesia. Reactivity to a 10-mm Hg rise in PaCO2 was calculated in absolute terms and as a percentage change from baseline using both the 3-minute and the 11-minute models. The correlation of CO2 reactivity calculated with the two models was r = 0.9 for the absolute values and r = 0.8 for the relative change. Cerebral blood flow calculated with the two models correlated well in both awake and anesthetized patients. In addition, there was a good correlation between CO2 reactivity calculated with the two models. In situations in which physiologic conditions cannot be held stable for 11 minutes, the 3-minute initial slope index may be used to quantitatively assess cerebrovascular reserve with a CO2 challenge.\r"

In the hypertensive patients, a decrease in regional cerebral blood flow was closely related to blood pressure; these changes were most pronounced in the supratentorial structures, especially the striatum and thalamus. In contrast, the regional cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen was less related to blood pressure. Consequently, the regional oxygen extraction fraction was increased in the hypertensive patients, while regional cerebral blood volume and the regional cerebral blood flow volume ratio were unchanged. Multivariate regression analysis confirmed that hypertension was an independent factor affecting regional cerebral blood flow. The analysis also disclosed that age, sex, hematocrit, smoking, and PaCO2 affected regional cerebral blood flow. These findings suggest that the hemodynamic reserve in hypertensive individuals is reduced, which may predispose them to cerebral ischemia and perhaps stroke, even during small decreases in cerebral perfusion pressure.\r"

These 11 patients also accounted for 11% of the 98 cases of polycystic kidney disease during the 28-month study period. As verified by computed tomography, parenchymal hemorrhage occurred mainly in the putamen and the thalamus, the usual sites for hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage. One patient with cerebral hemorrhage was autopsied and one was studied angiographically, but in neither patient was an intracranial aneurysm identified. In the patients with polycystic kidney disease and intracranial hemorrhage, hypertension had been inadequately treated or even undetected; therefore, I emphasize early detection and more effective control of hypertension in patients with polycystic kidney disease for prophylaxis against hemorrhagic cerebrovascular events.\r"

Cardiac arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, and cardiac valvulopathy were grounds for exclusion. The presence of anticardiolipin antibodies was not influenced by age. In the 88 patients without lupus, anticardiolipin antibodies were significantly more common in the group suffering brain ischemia than in the group with nonischemic neurologic disorders (29% versus 5%, p less than 0.01, chi 2 test). These controlled data demonstrate an association between the presence of circulating anticardiolipin antibodies with stroke, but not with other neurologic conditions.\r"

Difficulty in assessing nuclear shape required the introduction of an angularity comparator chart to improve the investigator's accuracy. Three investigators typed neurons obtained from normal, ischemic, and ischemic-reperfused rat brains. Accuracy and reproducibility of the investigators' typing decisions with and without the angularity comparator charts were evaluated. The accuracy of subjective shape assessment was compared with objective digitizer measurements of the same. The angularity comparator charts reduced subjective shape classification error by two thirds, and group error (overall performance expressed by the coefficient of variance) decreased from 15.9% to 4.7% for Type I (normal cells), from 33.9% to 17.3% for Type II (cells with angular nuclei), from 15.5% to 14.1% for Type III (cells with smeared nuclei), and from 3.2% to 5.5% for Type IV (dead cells). Thus, Type I and IV neurons can be assessed at a higher reproducibility than the intermediate Types II and III. Our typing method can also be used to evaluate the effect of treatment regimes on ischemic neuronal damage.\r"

A high dose (50 micrograms/ml, 3 X 10(-4) M) of histamine constricted the arterioles, whereas lower doses (20 and 10 micrograms/ml) relaxed them. Constriction was blocked and dilation occurred when selective injury of the endothelium was produced by light from a helium-neon laser in the presence of intravascular Evans blue. From this we conclude that the constriction was endothelium-dependent and was caused by the release of an endothelium-derived constricting factor. Constriction was also blocked by each of two antagonists of the H1 histamine receptor and by pretreatment of the arterioles with indomethacin. H1 blockade unmasked a dilating action of 1 micrograms/ml histamine, a dose too low to affect the diameter of arterioles not treated with the H1 blocker. An H2 blocker interfered with the relaxation by low-dose (10 micrograms/ml, 6 X 10(-5) M) histamine. These data indicate that for mouse pial arterioles, histamine can interact with H1 receptors on the endothelium to release an endothelium-derived constricting factor that causes constriction of the underlying muscle while simultaneously interacting with H2 receptors in the muscle that mediate relaxation of the vessel.\r"

Our goal was to examine the possibility that collaterals develop after unilateral carotid artery occlusion. During temporary occlusion of both carotid arteries in nine ketamine-anesthetized male rats, mean +/- SEM blood flow in both parietal cortices was 23 +/- 4% of the preocclusion (control) blood flow (120 +/- 7 ml/min/100 g) measured by laser Doppler flowmetry (p less than 0.05). After permanent occlusion of one carotid artery for either 1-2 days (n = 10) or 6 weeks (n = 7), mean +/- SEM blood flow was 16 +/- 2% and 30 +/- 3% of control, respectively, during a temporary test occlusion of the other carotid artery. During the test occlusion, blood flow in the cortex ipsilateral to the 6-week occlusion was 170% that in the contralateral cortex (which was similar to the blood flow immediately after temporary occlusion of both carotid arteries) and twice that after 1-2 days of occlusion. Mean luminal diameter of the basilar-carotid anastomosis ipsilateral to the 6-week occlusion was 186% that of the contralateral anastomosis, which showed only minimal change, and 145% that after 1-2 days of occlusion. We conclude that during 6 weeks of permanent carotid artery occlusion the anastomosis enlarges and its blood flow or reserve increases. Thus, collaterals developed ipsilateral to, but not contralateral to, the 6-week carotid artery occlusion, which suggests the possibility of greater collateral protection on the permanently occluded side.\r"

Three days later the rats were decapitated and the brain infarct volumes were compared with those in 10 control rats that received saline before middle cerebral artery occlusion. The mean volume of the infarct in the cerebral cortex was reduced by 33% in the group treated with methionine sulfoximine (p less than 0.01). This protective effect may be mediated by a presynaptic mechanism; methionine sulfoximine profoundly inhibits brain glutamine synthetase, thereby interrupting the astrocyte-neuron glutamate shuttle and impairing neuronal glutamate release. Methionine sulfoximine also increases brain glycogen stores, and this increased energy reserve may benefit penumbral tissue during the peri-infarct period. Further study of the mechanisms by which methionine sulfoximine decreases infarct volume could lead to new therapeutic approaches for stroke.\r"

Neither age nor presence of cerebrovascular risk factors was of aid in predicting angiographic features. The concomitance of cerebral infarction and active neurosyphilis does not imply a cause-and-effect relation, since atherosclerotic lesions may coexist with arteritis or may even represent the only angiographic feature.

Rapid testing at the time of sampling is vital to distinguish fetal from maternal blood. Blood typing was performed by slide technique in the treatment room during 38 procedures on 25 patients. Anti-I was used to test 50 presumed PUBS; venous I-positive maternal blood was tested in parallel. Because anti-I cannot detect fetal blood after umbilical vein transfusion (UVT) of I-positive donor blood, ABO and Rh blood typing reagents were used to test 29 samples when maternal and fetal or donor blood groups differed. Monoclonal reagents were used for optimal detection of weak AB antigens in fetal blood. Avid, chemically modified anti-D was used for Rh typing. Blood typing showed 27 (34%) of 79 samples to be maternal blood. Fetal blood was obtained in 8 of 10 cases investigated for fetal disorder and in 16 cases of potential HDN (anti-D, 5; -CD, 5; -cE, 2; -K, 2; -c; -E). The absence of HDN (antigen-negative fetus) was determined in 4 cases. UVT afforded live birth of 9 of 10 infants with HDN and was not indicated in two cases.\r"

The procedures are standardized and easy, and they provide clear and stable reactions that improve the interpretation of results. The process uses special microtubes filled with a mixture of gel, buffer, and reagent. Depending on the test to be carried out, the test uses a neutral gel containing no reagents (reagents are added to top of gel) or a specific gel containing reagents (e.g., antiglobulin serum or anti-A, -B, -D, etc.). A suspension of RBCs (for typing or the direct antiglobulin test) or a mixture of RBCs and serum (for reverse ABO typing or antibody characterization) is centrifuged through the gel under precise conditions. In negative reactions, the RBCs pass through the gel and pellet in the bottom of the tube, whereas, in positive reactions, they are trapped in the gel and the reaction may be read for hours afterwards. The test is easy to perform, sensitive, and reproducible. The antiglobulin tests can be performed without washing of the RBCs. There should be a reduction of risk from biohazardous materials.\r"

The sensitivity for platelets was 40 x 10(3) per mL, that for granulocytes was 10 x 10(3) per mL (starting from 0.2 mL of red cell filtrate), and that for T lymphocytes was 0.006 x 10(6) per mL (starting from 5 mL) and 0.0015 x 10(6) per mL (starting from 50 mL). These direct assays were used in experiments on filtration with three types of filters: the Cellselect B-1005, B-1014 and the B-1013 (bedside filter). After filtration of 1 unit of blood cell suspension through the B-1005, the number of remaining platelets was found to vary between less than or equal to 0.04 x 10(6) and greater than 15 x 10(6) per mL (n = 16); after filtration through the B-1013 filter, the remaining platelets were greater than 0.04 x 10(6) per mL. Upon filtration of a second unit of blood cell suspension through the B-1013 filter, the number of remaining platelets varied between less than or equal to 0.04 x 10(6) and 5 x 10(6). In both filter types, the number of remaining granulocytes was always less than 0.01 x 10(6) per mL. A study of T-lymphocyte contamination revealed that, upon filtration of 1 unit of blood through the B-1005, T-lymphocyte numbers were less than or equal to 0.0015 x 10(6) to 0.15 x 10(6) per mL (starting from 5 and 50 mL); upon filtration through the B-1013 filter, the number of remaining T lymphocytes varied between less than or equal to 0.006 x 10(6) and 0.2 x 10(6) per mL (starting from 5 mL). After filtration of a second unit of blood cell suspension through the B-1013 filter, the number of remaining T lymphocytes ranged from less than or equal to 0.006 x 10(6) to 0.1 to 0.5 x 10(6) per mL (starting from 5 mL). The direct radioimmunoassay is an improvement over the present electronic particle-counting techniques with regard to both sensitivity and specificity and may therefore be useful in quality control procedures in blood transfusion as well as in the development of new filters.\r"

A probability sample of 80 of these patients was selected randomly for detailed chart review. Of this sample, 78 (98%) were confirmed to have AIDS (86%) or ARC (14%). On the basis of the yearly census of the SFGH AIDS clinic, a transfusion incidence of 0.89 PRBC units per patient per year for patients with AIDS and 0.27 PRBC units per patient per year for those with ARC was estimated. Whereas 26 percent of the 177 transfusions studied in detail involved more than one associated (possibly causative) factor, antimicrobial drug therapy, zidovudine therapy, and disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection were the sole associated factors in 20, 14, and 12 percent of the transfusions, respectively. To assess the role of MAC, the 263 transfused patients were compared with the 574 patients whose blood was submitted to the SFGH Mycobacteriology Laboratory during the same period. Patients whose blood yielded MAC had a relative risk of 5.2 for transfusion-requiring anemia. In 80 percent of cases, the patient returned home after transfusion. Most PRBC transfusions administered to AIDS or ARC patients were optimal therapy.\r"

Bone marrow transplantation is becoming increasingly accepted as an effective treatment for hematologic disorders, including acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. To find suitable donors, bone marrow donor registries are being developed. The first-year costs of establishing an unrelated bone marrow donor registry are reported here. First-year costs are largely due to personnel costs and HLA typing charges. The cost per registrant decreases over time, but further decreases due to economies of scale are limited by the continued fixed requirement for HLA typing. Data are presented by separating costs into six unique categories, thereby allowing other blood centers to estimate start-up costs based on our experience.\r"

However, IgG-coated control cells failed to agglutinate in the negative reactions, casting doubt on their validity. At 4 degrees C, the patient's serum exhibited a large cryoprecipitate (2.9 mg/mL), made up predominantly of an IgG kappa paraprotein and having trace amounts of IgM and C3. Clear serum separated at 37 degrees C became cloudy within 10 minutes at room temperature (RT); within 4 hours, approximately 60 percent of the total precipitable cryoprotein had precipitated. Red cells (RBCs) incubated in fresh serum that had cooled to RT or RBCs obtained from RT or refrigerated samples contained cryoprecipitate that sedimented with the RBCs during washing with RT saline. On resuspension, enough IgG cryoglobulin redissolved to neutralize completely the commercial anti-IgG reagents. If the patient's samples were maintained at 37 degrees C, cryoprecipitate did not form, and RBCs washed four times at 37 degrees C gave valid DAT and IAT reactions. The removal of all cryoprecipitate from the patient's serum by centrifugation after overnight incubation at 4 degrees C also made possible valid antibody screening and compatibility tests.\r"

Recipient (C57B1/6J) mice were transfused with either saline, syngeneic blood or allogeneic (Balb/c) blood on two occasions, days 0 and 3. One week after the last transfusion, recipient mice were injected intravenously with varying numbers of methylcholanthrene-induced fibrosarcoma cells. Twenty days later the number of pleural nodules was counted as an index of pulmonary metastasis. The data demonstrate that the inoculation of 2.5 x 10(5) or 1 x 10(5) tumor cells resulted in significantly higher numbers of pulmonary metastases in mice that received allogeneic BT than the mice that received syngeneic blood or saline. In contrast, allogeneic BT caused significant inhibition of pulmonary metastases in mice that received 3.5 x 10(5) tumor cells. The data suggest that the immunomodulatory (stimulatory or inhibitory) effect of BT is dependent on the numbers of tumor cells inoculated. It is likely that the conflicting reports in the literature on the effects of BT on tumor growth may be due to inoculation of different numbers of tumor cells. These results have an important bearing in understanding the effect of allogeneic BT on tumor growth both in experimental animals and in cancer patients.\r"

Endoscopic treatment can also be used with satisfactory results and less morbidity in selected patients. A failed endoscopic attempt should not interfere with a subsequent open procedure. Conversely, a failed open procedure may be remedied by endoscopic surgery.

Although seemingly a radical maneuver, it did not cause complications in any of 51 cases.\r"

The safety of the procedure, in the hands of a skillful resectionist, should be equivalent to that of a transurethral prostatectomy or bladder tumor resection.

Further clinical studies are necessary to determine if, indeed, this can be considered a curative procedure.

  ".W": "Open surgical repair of upper urinary collecting system strictures or obstructions is difficult and is less likely to be accepted by the patient than an endoscopic or ureteroscopic approach. In the hands of an experienced urologic endoscopist the use of our cold blade has the advantage of less trauma to the ureter, already compromised by poor blood supply, than blind dilation; there is visual control of the procedure and acceptance by the patient that the urologic surgeon is doing the procedure; and it is adaptable to rigid or flexible endoscopes and ureterorenoscopes. Furthermore, there is information that the results are better, at least in the short term, than the more traumatic endoscopic procedures associated with dilation. However, only long-term future series will give us an evolving view of this resistant problem. Finally, the ureteral knife we have developed has the potential to be converted to an electrosurgical device for incision or coagulation, when appropriate. An application is pending with the US Food and Drug Administration concerning electrosurgical applications of the ureteral knife (in conjunction with J.R. La Course, PhD, and G.C. Gerhard, PhD, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of New Hampshire, Durham). The high dielectric constant of the sheath, combined with hemostatic or incisional properties in this latter mode, would likely prove advantageous.\r"

Sessions were given for different lengths of time ranging between ninety minutes and five hours, during which the prostate temperature was kept at 42.5 degrees C (+/- 0.5 degrees C) or 44.5 degrees C (+/- 0.5 degrees C). Three-dimensional temperature distributions in the prostate were measured accurately and verified by a Luxtron Fluoroptic Unit. Temperatures were constantly monitored in the rectal wall and in the prostatic urethra. Thorough and systemic follow-up was done before, during, and after each treatment, and the observations are reported. Two interesting preliminary observations were made: (1) differential blood counts showed significantly monocytosis following the treatments and lasted for at least one week, and (2) values of creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) and serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) were found to rise irreversibly in those animals which were later found to have definite histopathologic evidence of localized necrotic damage.\r"

  ".W": "In a study of occupational illness reported to a regional poison control center and to gauge the center's outreach and services, we did follow-up interviews of 301 case contacts over a 6-month period. We ascertained referral routes, reasons for contacting the poison control center, and awareness of the center's function. For 122 cases a nonphysician was the initial poison control center contact. Of the nonphysician contacts, 41 had already consulted a health care provider and been referred to the poison control center for assistance. Of the 70 persons with exposure, only 21 had been aware before their exposures that poison control center services might include occupational chemical illness consultation. Physicians and nonphysicians expressed similar reasons for contacting the poison control center, with 118 of 301 identifying the need for an exposure hazard risk assessment. These data suggest that although those contacting a poison control center because of occupational illness include a variety of cases, they have many similar service needs.\r"

Most of them (816/1012, 81 percent) were treated in community hospitals by primary care physicians. The remaining 196 (19 percent) were treated in the referral center, usually by a cardiologist. Cardiac catheterization within 2 days showed an open infarct artery in 87 percent of the community hospital and 83 percent of the referral center patients (P = NS). Predischarge ejection fraction was similar for community hospital and referral center patients (49 percent +/- 14 percent versus 51 percent +/- 14 percent, respectively), and there was a similar rate of bleeding complications (10 percent versus 13 percent, respectively). We conclude that primary physicians can use intravenous streptokinase effectively and safely in the treatment of patients in community hospitals.\r"

From seven dependent measures, we found high marital adjustment scores to be significantly correlated with less obesity, lower frequency of forgetting blood pressure medications, and less cessation of blood pressure medicine. These effects were much larger in a younger subsample of respondents who were 28 to 50 years old. The Dyadic Adjustment Scale measures the respondent's perception of the degree of affection and consensus, cohesion, and satisfaction in marriage. We conclude that the perception of positive marital interaction and communication ultimately contributes to controlled blood pressure by helping the patient to maintain healthy weight and to remember and continue taking blood pressure medication.\r"

We conducted a survey of 300 primary care physicians to assess their knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and breast screening practices. Our results show that only 71 percent of the respondents ordered mammograms for all women aged 50 to 75 years, which is the recommendation by the National Cancer Institute and American Cancer Society. Approximately 46 percent of respondents performed CBE on all women patients aged 50 to 75 years. Inadequate patient insurance coverage, equivocal radiology reports, patient reluctance or worry, and patient embarrassment all appear to be barriers to physicians' utilization of breast screening.\r"

Of the 978 physicians surveyed, 607 (62 percent) returned completed questionnaires. Three hundred twenty-three (53 percent) were not practicing obstetrics. The remaining 284 physicians currently practicing obstetrics constituted the study group. Ninety-four percent of these physicians routinely assessed smoking status at the first prenatal visit. Ninety-eight percent advised pregnant smokers to quit smoking during pregnancy. The most frequently used method of intervention was personal counseling (97 percent), followed by referral to smoking cessation clinics (40 percent), and behavior modification (20 percent). Fifty-seven percent of the physicians reported using antismoking pamphlets, and 30 percent used antismoking posters designed for pregnant women. Only 11 percent of the physicians surveyed were generally satisfied with the effectiveness of their current methods. Nonetheless, 97 percent were convinced that the benefits of smoking cessation during pregnancy merited their efforts. The physicians in this sample consistently have advised their pregnant smokers to quit, but most believe there is a need for more effective smoking cessation methods.\r"

Previous basic as well as clinical studies have suggested that interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) correlates with interstitial fluid volume and can be measured with a catheter placed in the subcutaneous space. We constructed a simple device to monitor IFP. The mean IFP for 7 healthy volunteers was -1.19 mmHg. IFP was measured in 25 patients at presentation and as clinical status evolved. Patients were classified as hypervolemic, normovolemic, or hypovolemic on the basis of their clinical status, the evolution of their condition, and laboratory and radiographic data. IFP correlation with assigned classification was statistically significant. The results suggest IFP can be measured readily and reliably in humans and is sensitive for reflecting the hydration of the interstitial compartment. This measure can assist in the determination of patient fluid requirements.\r"

  ".W": "The association between ventricular ectopic activity (VEA) and ischemic episodes during everyday activities was investigated in ambulatory patients with stable angina pectoris. Seventy-five consecutive patients with proven coronary artery disease, ischemic episodes on Holter monitoring and positive treadmill tests, but without known ventricular arrhythmias, were prospectively studied. In these 75 patients, a total of 719 ischemic episodes were recorded during 127 twenty-four-hour monitoring periods. Forty-three patients had either no or only very low baseline VEA (less than 14 ventricular premature complexes [VPCs]/24 hours); none of these patients had increased VEA during any ischemic episode. However, among 32 patients who had greater than or equal to 14 VPCs/24 hours (average 243 VPCs/24 hours), increased VEA during ischemic episodes was observed in 11 (31%). These 11 patients had a total of 174 ischemic episodes and the increased VEA appeared in 47 (27%) of the episodes. During 40 of the ischemic episodes the number of single VPCs increased significantly compared to the baseline background VEA: during 4 episodes trigeminy appeared and during another 3 bigeminy was observed. More complex VEA was not observed. Among the 11 patients with increased VEA, only 4 developed VPCs during treadmill testing. No correlation was found between the severity of the ischemic episodes (degree of ST depression and duration of ischemia) and the increased VEA. In 83% of these episodes the increased VEA appeared during the last (possibly reperfusion) phase. No correlation was found between the appearance of ventricular arrhythmias during ischemic episodes and the presence or absence of chest pain at the same time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Abnormal coronary vasoconstriction was induced by a hyperventilation test in 16 patients (group I) while the remaining 67 had a negative response (group II). No differences were observed between the 2 groups with regard to clinical, exercise and angiographic data. All group I patients and 16 patients in group II repeated hyperventilation and exercise tests after the administration of dihydropyridine-type calcium antagonists (7 patients nifedipine, 9 patients felodipine). After treatment 15 of 16 group I patients had a negative response to the hyperventilation test. The total exercise duration was significantly increased (278 +/- 183 vs 554 +/- 248 seconds; p less than 0.001) with higher values of rate pressure product at peak exercise (168 +/- 47 vs 235 +/- 67 mm Hg x beats/min/100; p less than 0.0025). In group II no significant differences were observed between pre- and posttreatment values for total exercise duration (244 +/- 210 vs 308 +/- 243 seconds) and rate pressure product at peak exercise (170 +/- 46 vs 188 +/- 56 mm Hg x beats/min/100). These data show that the hyperventilation test can be used to select a subset of patients with stable exertional angina and detectable abnormal coronary vasoconstriction who will improve their exercise tolerance with coronary vasodilator treatment.\r"

  ".W": "A cohort of 112 consecutive patients with angiographically defined intracoronary thrombi was treated with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and followed prospectively to determine early and late outcomes. Coronary angioplasty using a treatment modality of intravenous and intracoronary heparin, antiplatelet agents and prolonged inflations with oversized balloons (balloon:vessel ratio, 1.2:1) resulted in clinical success in 103 patients (92%) at hospital discharge. No periprocedural thrombolytic therapy was used and prolonged pretreatment with heparin was not routinely used. Four patients (3.5%) required elective coronary bypass surgery, and 4 patients (3.5%) required emergency coronary artery bypass grafting because of abrupt closure. Late clinical follow-up (mean 7 months) was available in 99 of the 103 successfully treated patients (96%). Seventy-three percent of patients were asymptomatic at follow-up, and 27% had class I or II angina. No patients had a late myocardial infarction. Elective coronary artery bypass surgery was required in 3 patients (3%) and repeat coronary angioplasty in 17 patients (17%). There were 2 late cardiac deaths at 7 months. Ninety-four patients (95%) had an event free follow-up defined as absence of coronary artery bypass surgery, myocardial infarction or death. In conclusion, coronary angioplasty alone, using intracoronary heparin and prolonged balloon inflations with relatively oversized balloons may be helpful to achieve a high initial success rate, low incidence of in-hospital complications and excellent long-term results in patients with intracoronary thrombus.\r"

The costs for diagnostic and therapeutic service for patients with CAD were linked to medical decision algorithms outlining the diagnosis and management of patients with CAD. Because CAD is a changing illness not represented by a single event, the algorithm tracked patients for 5 years after the time of diagnosis, or until death, to develop average cost estimates. The estimated 5-year costs (in 1986 United States dollars) of the 5 CAD events were: acute myocardial infarction $51,211, angina pectoris $24,980, unstable angina pectoris $40,581, sudden death $9,078 and nonsudden death $19,697. The costs of major CAD surgical procedures were also calculated because of their impact on health care costs for patients with CAD. These include: coronary artery bypass surgery per case over 5 years $32,465, and angioplasty per case over 5 years $26,916. The high cost of CAD reflects the improved technology and more effective and expensive therapies now available.\r"

Available data, however, do not provide evidence that the risk associated with the increase in cardiac muscle mass is independent of the severity of preexistent coronary artery disease. In a cohort of predominantly black patients with a high prevalence of hypertension and LV hypertrophy, LV mass as estimated by echocardiography was found to be a powerful prognostic factor independent of ejection fraction and obstructive coronary disease. After excluding patients with either a dilated LV cavity (diastolic internal diameter greater than 5.8 cm) or asymmetric septal hypertrophy (septal:posterior wall ratio greater than 1.5) LV mass/height remained significantly increased in decedents compared to survivors (116 +/- 38 vs 131 +/- 47 g/m, p = 0.014), while the thickness of the ventricular septum and the posterior wall were even more highly predictive of a fatal outcome (p = 0.003 and 0.001, respectively). After exclusion of patients with eccentric LV hypertrophy, differences in LV muscle mass in survivors and decedents were due entirely to increased thickness of the ventricular wall, and no differences in cavity dimensions or LV ejection fraction were noted. Stepwise regression analysis was used to demonstrate that measures of LV hypertrophy were the most important predictors of survival and eliminated the contribution of all other prognostic factors to the model except the number of stenotic vessels. The relative risk associated with a 100-g increase in mass was 2.1, while a 0.1-cm increase in posterior wall thickness was associated with approximately a 7-fold increase in the risk of dying.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients with these new drug-associated spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias often manifested a preexisting substrate for such arrhythmias: sustained VT or VF was induced in 65% of patients at baseline, and in 58% of patients when tested with their previously taken antiarrhythmic drug. Among those without inducible sustained ventricular arrhythmias in the drug-free state, 78% remained free of inducible sustained arrhythmias when tested with the same drug they had been taking at the time of the clinical arrhythmia. Even patients without a definable electrophysiologic substrate for sustained VT or VF remained at risk for arrhythmia recurrence if treated with alternative antiarrhythmic medications: 40% of such patients who continued to receive an antiarrhythmic agent different from that being administered when their clinical VT or VF occurred had recurrent spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias during follow-up. Thus, patients with drug-associated clinical sustained ventricular tachycardias form a heterogenous group that should be evaluated individually and not empirically managed for a \"proarrhythmic effect\" simply by antiarrhythmic drug withdrawal or drug substitution.\r"

While receiving propafenone, a drug with moderate negative inotropic activity, peak flow velocity declined by 9 +/- 8% (p less than 0.05), the flow velocity integral (termed stroke distance, representing stroke volume) declined by 8 +/- 11% (p less than 0.10), the rate-corrected stroke distance declined by 9 +/- 8% (p less than 0.02) and the minute distance, representing cardiac output, declined by 10 +/- 12% (p less than 0.05). In contrast, while receiving mexiletine, a drug with minimal negative inotropic activity, none of these parameters changed significantly. Five of 9 patients (56%) treated with propafenone showed a decline in rate-corrected stroke distance exceeding the 95% confidence limit of day-to-day variability, which was +/- 13 percent. Two of these 5 patients developed clinical signs of congestive heart failure. Continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography can detect antiarrhythmic drug-induced LV dysfunction and may be used to anticipate the development of significant clinically overt congestive heart failure.\r"

Twenty-five patients with chronic atrial flutter resistant to combined digitalis and quinidine therapy were studied electrophysiologically after restoration of sinus rhythm by overdrive pacing or by eventual direct current cardioversion. Recurrence of atrial flutter was observed in 12 patients during a mean follow-up period of 17 months (range 3 to 50). Electrophysiologic testing included programmed high right atrial stimulation at a paced drive cycle length of 600 ms and incremental pacing up to 200-ms paced intervals. When coupling intervals of 90% of the drive cycle length were compared to coupling intervals of 48% of the drive cycle length, the increase in S1A1 interval, defined as the interval between the stimulus artifact and the atrial activation near the atrioventricular junction, was greater in patients with subsequent recurrence of atrial flutter (47 +/- 11 vs 21 +/- 18 ms). Stepwise logistic regression analysis identified the S1A1 increase to be the sole independent predictor of recurrence (p = 0.0082) while previous episodes of atrial flutter or the presence of organic heart disease were identified as dependent variables. Reclassification showed a 91% sensitivity and a 92% specificity. Correct classification was achieved in 92% of patients. The initiation of atrial dysrhythmia had no predictive value. The assessment of the S1A1 interval by programmed atrial stimulation appears helpful in delineating the patient risk of recurrent atrial flutter after termination by overdrive pacing.\r"

With univariate analysis, these patients were younger (29 +/- 20 vs 42 +/- 16 years; p less than 0.05), had a higher incidence of syncope (p less than 0.025), dyspnea (p less than 0.001), reduced peak filling rate (2.9 +/- 0.9 vs 3.4 +/- 1.0 end-diastolic volume/s; p = 0.09) with increased relative filling volume during the rapid filling period (80 +/- 7 vs 75 +/- 12%; p = 0.06) and decreased atrial contribution (17 +/- 7 vs 22 +/- 11%; p = 0.07). Stepwise discriminant analysis revealed that young age at diagnosis, syncope at diagnosis, reduced peak ejection rate, positive family history, reduced peak filling rate, increased relative filling volume by peak filling rate and concentric left ventricular hypertrophy were the most statistically significant (p = 0.0001) predictors of disease-related death (sensitivity 92%, specificity 76%, accuracy 77%, positive predictive value 25%). Discriminant analysis excluding the diastolic indexes, however, showed similar predictability (sensitivity 92%, specificity 76%, accuracy 78%, positive predictive value 26%). To obtain more homogeneous groups for analysis, patients were classified as survivors (116) or electrically unstable (40), including sudden death, out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia during 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiography, and heart failure death or cardiac transplant (5).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It is a possibility that the nature of the process leading to heart failure may determine, in large part, the pathogenesis of this decline. Sera of some patients with dilated cardiomyopathy contain antibodies directed against the beta-adrenoceptor, as judged by ligand binding inhibition, immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting assays. Because deranged immune function is thought to play a role in dilated cardiomyopathy, immunogenetic markers of the propensity to develop anti-beta-receptor antibodies were sought. The prevalence of HLA-DR4 was significantly higher in dilated cardiomyopathy patients (40 vs 24% in 511 normal subjects, pc less than 0.001). In contrast, no association was found between HLA phenotypes and alcoholic cardiomyopathy. Furthermore, 72% (13 of 18) of the HLA-DR4 dilated cardiomyopathy patients had anti-beta-receptor antibodies compared to 22% (7 of 33) HLA-DR4-negative patients; in the latter, presence of antibody was linked to the HLA-DR1 phenotype. Conversely, 67% (15 of 23) of the antibody-positive patients were typed as HLA-DR4 compared to only 10% of the antibody-negative patients. Interestingly, none of the 23 antibody-positive patients were typed as HLA-DR3 while 37% of the antibody-negative did. Only 25% of alcoholic cardiomyopathy patients had anti-beta-receptor antibodies and no preponderant HLA association could be demonstrated. These results suggest that the presence of anti-beta-receptor antibodies in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy may be under the control of the major histocompatibility locus.\r"

Twenty-one young patients, aged 2 to 19 (mean 11) years with congenital heart disease and a tachyarrhythmia occurring in the setting of chronic bradycardia were studied. The effects of pacing were evaluated by comparison of the number of episodes of clinical tachycardia during the 12-month intervals before and after pacemaker implantation. During these intervals, antiarrhythmic drug therapy was not altered. Patients were analyzed as independent groups, based on the type of tachyarrhythmia: supraventricular (n = 5), atrial flutter (n = 9) and ventricular (n = 7). The modes of chronic pacing were AAI (n = 4), DDD (n = 6) and VVI (n = 11). The prevention of bradycardia by pacing was associated with a significant decrease in the frequency of supraventricular (p = 0.008) and ventricular (p = 0.02) tachyarrhythmias. However, the frequency of atrial flutter was not altered. Prevention of tachycardia was more frequently associated with the AAI and DDD modes of pacing compared to VVI (p = 0.08). Pacing represents an effective therapy for certain tachyarrhythmias associated with chronic bradycardia, although critical modes may be required.\r"

In most transplant centers, patients with a history of malignancy and severe heart failure have not been considered acceptable candidates for cardiac transplantation. In the last 4 years at Stanford University Medical Center, 8 cardiac transplants have been performed in 7 patients with a history of neoplastic disease. Six of these patients had already received treatment for lymphoproliferative disorders and in 1 case, a patient underwent a transplant after treatment for adenocarcinoma of the colon. Six of the 7 patients were discharged from the hospital and in that group, the 1-year posttransplant survival rate was 71%. This was comparable to an overall 1-year survival rate of 80% for patients undergoing a cardiac transplant at our center during the same period of time. At follow-up averaging over 2 years, there has been 1 case of recurrent neoplasia. One patient with evidence of radiation-induced pulmonary damage died of respiratory failure 2 days after transplantation. One patient required retransplantation because of intractable rejection and subsequently died from infectious complications. Immunosuppressive therapy in these patients has not been associated with an increased risk for neoplastic recurrence or for the development of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders. The current study demonstrates that in a carefully selected group, previously treated neoplastic disease should not represent a contraindication to cardiac transplantation.\r"

Two-dimensional and M-mode echocardiography and arterial blood pressure were used to study left ventricular morphometrics and contractility in 44 normal children, aged 2 to 12 years. Left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic length, diameter, wall thickness, volume and mass all showed linear increases with body surface area (p less than 0.001 in all). Shortening and ejection fractions, velocity of circumferential fiber shortening, morphometric ratios and endocardial meridional and circumferential stress (mean 46 and 115 g/cm2, respectively) all remained constant. A load-independent measure of the normal resting left ventricular contractile state was determined by relating the rate-corrected velocity of circumferential fiber shortening to end-systolic endocardial meridional and circumferential stress; there was an inverse linear correlation (r = -0.641 and -0.557 respectively, p less than 0.001). These data provide a quantitative basis for assessment of myocardial hypertrophy, afterload and contractile state in childhood.\r"

Subjects of both sexes were categorized into four subgroups on the basis of their participation in leisure-time activities of various intensities. In general, subjects practicing vigorous activities on a regular basis had lower subcutaneous skinfold thicknesses and waist-to-hip ratios (WHRs) than those not performing these activities. These differences remained statistically significant after a covariance analysis was used to remove the effect of total energy expenditure of leisure-time activities on subcutaneous fat and fat distribution. Moreover, the WHR remained significantly lower in subjects performing high-intensity exercise after the effect of subcutaneous fat on fat distribution was adjusted for.\r"

Follow-up of a subsample of 25 macrobiotic infants in March-April revealed physical symptoms of rickets in 55% of the macrobiotic infants. All concentrations in blood were considerably below those in the preceding summer; the average 25(OH)D concentration was 12.3 +/- 4.3 nmol/L. Further analysis indicated that the low availability of calcium in the macrobiotic diet was an independent factor in causing the high prevalence of rickets in summer.

Adult male subjects (n = 11) were given saturation doses of 2 mg unlabeled folic acid/d for 7 d before the study. After an overnight fast each subject consumed 677 nmol each of 3',5'-labeled bideuterofolic acid and glutamate-labeled tetradeuterofolic acid. The 48-h urinary excretion of deuterated folates represented 5-6% of the ingested dose. The molar ratio of labeled folates in urine was not significantly different from the molar ratio in the ingested dose, which indicated equivalent absorption and metabolism of these labeled forms of the vitamin. These results support the validity of this protocol for in vivo studies of folate bioavailability.\r"

All patients required total parenteral nutrition beginning 1 wk before BMT. After conditioning therapy the concentration of absolute and lipid-standardized alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene in plasma decreased significantly, presumably as a result of an enhanced breakdown of these antioxidants. The loss of these lipid-soluble antioxidants has to be considered as a possible cause for early posttransplant organ toxicity.\r"

Milk selenium was lower (p less than 0.01) in the rainy than in the dry season (208 vs 256 nmol/L, respectively). Milk selenium was similar in samples from women in early (1-6 mo postpartum) and late (13-19 mo postpartum) lactation. During late lactation, parity, which ranged from 1 to 11, was negatively correlated with milk selenium regardless of plane of maternal nutrition (p less than 0.02). Measures of protein, glutathione peroxidase, and total peroxidase were not affected by stage of lactation or parity. Glutathione peroxidase activity accounted for 38% of the peroxidase activity in milk. Results show that although length of lactation alone had little impact, milk selenium secretion was influenced by both maternal nutritional adequacy and parity of rural Gambian women.\r"

Iron deficiency did not reduce the concentration of either serum or intracytoplasmic thymulin. Although T-cell subsets in the thymus were not altered, both the cortical and medullar regions were depleted of thymocytes. In the spleen iron deficiency (but not underfeeding) significantly reduced the percentage of L3T4+ cells, of Lyt-2+ cells, and thus of the overall T-cell population. However, it did not affect the ratio of L3T4+ to Lyt-2+ T cells. Thymocyte proliferation was significantly reduced at the concanavalin A (Con A) dose (10 mg/L) that produced maximal stimulation in control and pair-fed mice but not at low (7.5 mg/L) or high (15 mg/L) Con A concentrations. We conclude that the impairment in immune functions associated with iron deficiency is not due to an impairment in thymic endocrine function but rather to decreased immunocompetent lymphocytes.\r"

This paper reports findings obtained from questionnaires and diet records completed by 40 healthy subjects and 118 patients with chemosensory dysfunction. Chemosensory disorders were frequently associated with decreases in food acceptability. Although dietary responses to these dysfunctions varied greatly, patients with distorted or phantom smell and/or taste sensations tended to report weight loss whereas those with simple sensory loss were more likely to report weight gain. Indices derived from diet records did not indicate that either group of patients was at substantial nutritional risk, but food frequency responses and estimates of body mass index were consistent with patient reports of changes in dietary patterns and weight. In addition, marked weight change and aberrant dietary practices were noted in individual patients. Thus, there were indications that chemosensory dysfunction may be associated with nutritionally important dietary alterations.\r"

  ".U": "90164466\r", 
  ".W": "A predictive equation for resting energy expenditure (REE) was derived from data from 498 healthy subjects, including females (n = 247) and males (n = 251), aged 19-78 y (45 +/- 14 y, mean +/- SD). Normal-weight (n = 264) and obese (n = 234) individuals were studied and REE was measured by indirect calorimetry. Multiple-regression analyses were employed to drive relationships between REE and weight, height, and age for both men and women (R2 = 0.71): REE = 9.99 x weight + 6.25 x height - 4.92 x age + 166 x sex (males, 1; females, 0) - 161. Simplification of this formula and separation by sex did not affect its predictive value: REE (males) = 10 x weight (kg) + 6.25 x height (cm) - 5 x age (y) + 5; REE (females) = 10 x weight (kg) + 6.25 x height (cm) - 5 x age (y) - 161. The inclusion of relative body weight and body-weight distribution did not significantly improve the predictive value of these equations. The Harris-Benedict Equations derived in 1919 overestimated measured REE by 5% (p less than 0.01). Fat-free mass (FFM) was the best single predictor of REE (R2 = 0.64): REE = 19.7 x FFM + 413. Weight also was closely correlated with REE (R2 = 0.56): REE = 15.1 x weight + 371.\r"

The main conclusions are first, that in dealing with human beings value judgements cannot be avoided, but to avoid sterile discussion they must be separated from objective descriptions of adaptive responses. Second, the way ahead lies in examining the shape of the responses of different functions to different degrees and kinds of stress. Objective studies of this kind do not require use of the word adaptation.\r"

Alterations in metabolic efficiency of +/- 10% in total energy expenditure are the limits of what can normally be expected on prolonged under- or overfeeding. The supposed twofold variation in energy requirements of adults is based on measurements of food intake, which, despite involving weighted intakes over a week, cannot be considered realistic. Subtle differences in the energetic responses to fat, protein, and carbohydrate signify the different effective energetic contribution of isoenergetic substrates and may account for the propensity to obesity in individuals and societies on a high-fat diet.\r"

During the first 13 months following licensure of each of the vaccines, there were 127 cases reported in recipients of PRP vaccine vs 17 cases in recipients of PRP-D vaccine. The total number of reported cases for each vaccine is not necessarily comparable, since the extent of vaccine use in the population and the extent of reporting of cases may have been different during the two periods. However, the proportion of reported cases occurring equal to or 14 days or more after vaccination (a period considered sufficient to develop immunity) was significantly greater for PRP vaccine (106 [83%] of 127 cases) compared with PRP-D vaccine (7 [41%] of 17 cases). Based on the ratio of late-onset to early-onset cases observed for PRP vaccine, we would have expected 50 late-onset cases after PRP-D vaccination. Since only 7 late-onset PRP-D vaccine failures were reported (86% fewer than expected), the data suggest that PRP-D vaccine was more effective in preventing disease 14 days or more after vaccination than was PRP vaccine.\r"

Results of the study demonstrate that knowledge of AIDS and of the modes of human immunodeficiency virus transmission have increased dramatically over the past 5 years. Ninety-eight percent of high school students in this study understood the modes of transmission and that merely touching a person with AIDS will not transmit the virus. However, results also revealed that many negative biases remain toward people who have been infected with human immunodeficiency virus. Forty-five percent of the students believed that homosexuals and intravenous drug users were \"getting what they deserve.\" Recommendations are made that future educational efforts focus on changes in attitudes and behaviors in relation to adolescents' previously acquired knowledge of AIDS.\r"

A comprehensive questionnaire on patterns of alcohol and other drug use, early childhood and nuclear family psychological and behavioral history, and previous suicidal attempts was completed by 298 (88%) of 340 outpatient adolescent substance abusers in three geographic regions east of the Mississippi River. An abbreviated Beck Depression Inventory was included to ascertain current symptoms of depressed mood. Adolescents admitting to a previous suicide attempt (30%) were compared with two age- and sex-matched samples. Substance abusers were three times as likely as a normative population of non-drug-using age- and sex-matched peers to make a suicide attempt. Thirty-three percent of attempts reported occurred prior to high school. Both the wish to hurt oneself and actual suicide attempts were found to increase significantly after the initiation of substance use. Forty percent used drugs within 8 hours before the suicide attempt, and 23% of attempters reported that their families continued to have a firearm with ammunition in the home following the suicide attempt. Adolescent substance abusers who had attempted suicide were significantly more likely than a matched group of nonattempters in the same drug treatment facility to: (1) complain of usually feeling \"blue\" or sad (depressed affect) during early childhood, (2) identify important childhood behavioral problems, (3) identify long-standing self-perceived impaired self-concept, and (4) identify serious parental problems, such as chronic depression or alcoholism. Self-perceived chronic loneliness in childhood appears to be a singularly important initiator of adolescent drug use and subsequent suicide attempts among drug abusers.\r"

To determine the consequences of these nosocomial bacteremias, a cohort study was conducted in which two comparison subjects were matched with each of 38 bacteremic infants by hospital, birth weight within 100 g, and nearest date of discharge. To adjust for duration of stay in the hospital, it was also required that both comparison subjects have survived and remained in the hospital for as long as the time until bacteremia occurred in the bacteremic infant. The average day of onset of bacteremia was the 20th hospital day. Despite having similar birth weights and comparable severity of underlying illness, bacteremic infants remained in the hospital for an average of 19.8 days longer than the nonbacteremic comparison subjects (77.3 vs 57.5 days). The bacteremic patients received antibiotics for an average of 11.2 more days than the nonbacteremic infants. Vancomycin hydrochloride was given to 20 (52.6%) of the bacteremic patients but only 4 (5.3%) of the comparison patients. All of the comparison subjects and 37 of the 38 infants with bacteremia survived. Thus, nosocomial bacteremia with coagulase-negative staphylococci is a late complication of hospitalization that occurs in infants who are already relatively long-term survivors. This bacteremia appears to be associated with substantially longer hospital stay and antibiotic therapy but little, if any, excess mortality.\r"

Older children had underlying chronic disease more commonly than younger children (47 of 62 vs 24 of 62). Chronic illnesses in older children included bronchopulmonary dysplasia and/or reactive airway disease (34 of 47), congenital heart disease (9 of 47), gastrointestinal disease (7 of 47), and genetic disorders (7 of 47). Three of the four deaths from RSV infection occurred in older children; all four had underlying disease (three with congenital heart disease and one with biliary atresia). We conclude that children older than 12 months with underlying disease are at increased risk for serious or fatal RSV infection and are not always protected by previous RSV disease. Such older children should be considered candidates for passive or active immunoprophylaxis against RSV infection as such agents become available.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin 1 beta have been shown to be mediators of meningeal inflammation in animal models of bacterial meningitis. The presence of both cytokines in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with bacterial meningitis has been documented recently. In this study, we measured concentrations of interleukin 1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in CSF samples from 36 patients with nonbacterial (aseptic) meningitis, 13 of whom had culture-proved enteroviral meningitis, and from 14 control patients. None of the samples from patients with aseptic meningitis and from the controls had detectable tumor necrosis factor activity in CSF. Thirty-two (89%) of 36 patients with aseptic meningitis had detectable interleukin 1 beta in CSF (mean +/- SEM, 48 +/- 11 pg/mL). These concentrations were significantly smaller than those previously reported in patients with bacterial meningitis (944 +/- 128 pg/mL). Only 2 of the 14 control patients had detectable CSF interleukin 1 beta concentrations of 21 and 42 pg/mL. A significant correlation was evident between interleukin-1 beta concentrations and white blood cell counts in the CSF of patients with aseptic meningitis. Our data suggest that the initial events of CSF inflammation in children with aseptic meningitis are different than those in patients with bacterial meningitis, and the participation of these two cytokines, especially tumor necrosis factor-alpha, is less critical to the process.\r"

Large concentrations of tumor necrosis factor alpha (range, 100 to 85,000 pg/mL) were found in 12 (75%) of 16 patients with bacterial infection and in none of the patients with noninfectious origins. Large concentrations of interleukin 1 beta (greater than 200 pg/mL) were found in 15 (94%) of 16 patients with bacterial infection and in none of the other patients. In the latter group, small concentrations of interleukin 1 (range, 40 to 120 pg/mL) were present in 5 (63%) of 8 patients. Serum samples obtained simultaneously were negative for both cytokines. Tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 1 beta concentrations correlated significantly and with leukocyte counts in synovial fluid. We conclude that large concentrations of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 1 beta are produced locally in patients with suppurative arthritis and they may be potentially useful in differentiating this condition from other kinds of arthritis.\r"

Most homes surveyed had a videocassette recorder, cable television, and more than one television set. Frequent parental discussion of program content with children was reported by 38% of respondents. Availability of television and parent-child discussion of content were not correlated with viewing hours or viewing Public Broadcasting Service. Frequent use of television as a distraction for the child correlated positively with viewing hours. Viewing Public Broadcasting Service correlated negatively with parent-child coviewing and with use of television as a form of entertainment. Children's own television viewing content correlated positively with viewing Public Broadcasting Service. Of all measured factors in the home environment, parental attitudes were most closely associated with children's viewing habits.\r"

Retention of calcium was similar for all formulas studied: 45% +/- 4% (mean +/- SEM) from whey-hydrolysate, 47% +/- 2% from whey-predominant, and 53% +/- 7% from casein-predominant formula. Calcium retention from human milk, 72% +/- 3%, was significantly higher than from formula. Using these retention values and the calcium concentrations of the diets, infant formula and human milk deliver approximately equal amounts of calcium to the infant.\r"

  ".W": "As pediatric cardiac surgical techniques have improved in recent years, mortality rates have dropped and attention has turned to residual morbidity, especially neurologic sequelae. Although the majority of children undergoing open-heart surgery for correction of congenital heart defects apparently emerge with no adverse consequences, a small percentage suffer permanent neurologic injury (seizures, motor disorders). Another small and not well-defined population may be left with disorders of higher cortical function, such as mental retardation or learning disabilities. A survey of six major pediatric cardiac surgery units in North America was undertaken in 1988-1989 to ascertain current approaches to the detection and management of neurologic sequelae of pediatric open-heart surgery. All units reported seeing a small but definite incidence of postoperative neurologic symptoms, including alterations of consciousness, seizures, and localized abnormalities such as hemiparesis or delayed choreoathetoid syndromes. Postoperative neuroimaging procedures have shown a disturbing incidence of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, unsuspected cerebral atrophy, and subdural hematomas. Pathogenesis may include factors related to preoperative brain anomalies and/or hypoxic insults, altered cerebral blood flow and metabolism during hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass with or without total circulatory arrest, embolization, and low cardiac output states postoperatively. Further studies are needed to examine the mechanisms of injury and to develop techniques to minimize the occurrence of these sequelae, as they may be associated with life-long neurologic disability and reduced quality of life.\r"

Ten of the preoperative studies were interpreted as normal. One third (5 of 15) of the patients showed ventriculomegaly and dilatation of the subarachnoid spaces on preoperative magnetic resonance images. Measurements of the preoperative and postoperative magnetic resonance images showed a postoperative increase in the bicaudate and third ventricular diameters. Four patients in the study group developed postoperative subdural hematomas. The subdural hematomas were small and caused no demonstrable mass effect on magnetic resonance imaging. One patient had a preoperative white matter infarction. There was 1 patient with a postoperative infarction.\r"

A wide variety of CPR-related injuries have been described since the institution nearly 30 years ago of this now common-place emergency technique. The forensic pathologist must be aware of both typical and unusual CPR-related trauma patterns in order to differentiate between injury produced during emergency therapy procedures and injury sustained through other mechanisms (for example, during an assault or an accident). This article describes two recent separate and unrelated incidents in which an elderly woman was murdered. In each instance, bony injuries of the anterior thoracic wall structures were identified during the autopsy. Defense attorneys in each case attempted to use these injuries as proof that their accused clients had performed external cardiac massage on their victims, thus indicating that the homicides had not been intentional, and that the perpetrators showed remorse. These cases are presented, with a discussion of the typical features of CPR-related thoracic wall trauma as compared with willfully inflicted injury.\r"

The roles of compliance and the medical staff may change in each phase. In particular, the stresses of the maturity phase may be balanced in a complex, enmeshed, and precarious fashion. A developmental view implies that adaptive mechanisms at one stage may be maladaptive in others, and that relationships and ethical viewpoints may change radically as the response to the disease and its treatment progresses. The developmental phase must be taken into consideration when decisions are made in the care of patients with ESRD.\r"

Second, since the most recent transplant group was randomized to two alternative immunosuppressive drug regimens, we compared the quality of life of the patients on cyclosporine/prednisone therapy (N = 51) and the patients on a conventional immunosuppressive therapy (antilymphocyte globulin/prednisone/azathioprine; N = 40). Patients had to be age 19 to 56 years and nondiabetic to be included in this research. Data were collected with survey questionnaires containing measures of physical, emotional, and social well-being, vocational rehabilitation, sexual adjustment, and marital and family adjustment. Case mix or background differences were controlled as much as possible using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and comparison of adjusted means. Our results show that the successful transplant patients scored higher than both dialysis groups (P less than 0.05 for nine of 11 measures) on almost all variables, demonstrating a higher quality of life. The effect of a failed transplant on quality of life was also examined. In terms of the recent transplant patients, the cyclosporine group scored consistently higher on all physical, emotional, and social well-being measures (excluding males' vocational rehabilitation), although differences are not always significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The framework is developed in three stages. First, the issue of guiding ethical principles is examined, with a multiple-principle approach being adopted. Second, common models of the care-giver/patient relationship (warrior, parental, contractual, covenantal) are identified, and their varying impacts on treatment decisions are explained and assessed. Third, specific criteria for determining when to initiate and terminate treatment are introduced. Two criteria (willingness and medical benefit) are commended in the context of initiating treatment, while three distinctions (willing v unwilling, passive v active, and terminal v nonterminal) are found to be particularly helpful when deciding if treatment should be terminated. Two illustrative cases involve end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The first describes a noncompliant and abusive intravenous (IV) drug user on hemodialysis who wants to continue on dialysis and eventually receive a living-related donor kidney transplant. The second describes a patient's decisions to refuse feeding gastrostomy and jejunostomy, any further surgical or diagnostic intervention, and eventually dialysis-though only after a period of time when he wants dialysis alone to continue.\r"

  ".W": "Forty-eight adult patients without clinical evidence of inguinal or abdominal wall hernias underwent peritoneal scintigraphy shortly after beginning continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Scintigraphically detectable subclinical structural defects involving the inguinal canal or abdominal wall were present in 14 patients. Within 5 months, four of these defects progressed to clinically significant CAPD-related structural complications. These patients could not be distinguished by clinical or scintigraphic criteria from the 10 patients with nonprogressive structural defects. No scintigraphic structural defects were detected in 34 patients, 30 of whom remained free of CAPD-related structural complications. Five patients developed symptomatic structural complications during follow-up in areas that had been scintigraphically normal at the onset of CAPD. We conclude that some CAPD-related structural complications arise de novo, while others represent progression of subclinical pre-existent structural abnormalities that can be detected by peritoneal scintigraphy. However, most asymptomatic scintigraphic defects do not progress to a symptomatic stage, limiting the usefulness of prospective peritoneal scintigraphy as a guide to recommend prophylactic repair of all asymptomatic structural defects in patients beginning CAPD.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to define manifestations of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) in older patients with the disease. Fifty-seven subjects age 50 years or more, who were at risk for having inherited the gene for ADPKD, were evaluated for renal size, hypertension, back and abdominal pain, symptoms consistent with urinary tract infection (UTI), hematuria, end-stage renal failure, and liver cysts. The diagnosis of ADPKD was made in 32 of the 57 at-risk subjects (56%). At the time of study, only one patient with the disease was asymptomatic and normotensive and denied any previous symptoms suggestive of the disease. Clinical manifestations of ADPKD in the 31 symptomatic patients were hypertension (69%), a history of back and abdominal pain (47%), symptoms consistent with UTI (41%), hematuria (31%), and end-stage renal failure (47%). Liver cysts were found in 44% of patients. No statistically significant differences in the frequency of any manifestations of ADPKD between men and women were found, although the frequency of symptoms consistent with UTI tended to be higher in women (53%) than in men (27%). Most patients developed symptoms after the age of 40 years. Notably, 31% of the older patients with ADPKD had normal serum creatinine levels. Thus, older subjects with kidney cysts who are at risk to have inherited the gene for ADPKD, should be considered to have the disease even in the presence of well-preserved kidney function. This observation may play an important role in assessing the prognosis of older subjects at risk who have bilateral renal cysts and in genetic counseling of their relatives.\r"

  ".W": "Studies were performed in the awake, chronically catheterized male Sprague-Dawley rat to investigate renal hemodynamics in the baseline state and also in response to a large intravenous (IV) amino acid (glycine) load. Studies were performed in young adult rats (age 3 to 4 months), old rats (age 18 months), and senescent rats (age 22 to 24 months). Histologic evaluation of the kidney permitted a correlation between structural and functional changes with aging. Histology showed progressive glomerular damage (sclerosis) with aging. In 18-month-old rats, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was normal, which, considering the level of glomerular injury (only 64% normal glomeruli), must indicate heterogeneity of glomerular function, with some hyperfunctioning glomeruli. By 22 to 24 months of age (at which time approximately 50% mortality has occurred in males of this strain), GFR is substantially reduced, as is renal plasma flow rate (RPF). Severe glomerular damage was observed histologically (only 34% normal glomeruli), indicating widespread heterogeneity of glomerular function. Young adult rats displayed a substantial renal vasodilation in response to acute IV glycine infusion, which resulted in approximately 25% increases in GFR and RPF. The renal vascular responsivity to glycine was diminished at 18 months and was completely absent in 22- to 24-month-old rats. This altered renal vasodilatory response to glycine probably reflects both structural changes associated with aging and also the compensatory vasodilation of intact hyperfunctioning remnant nephrons as other nephrons are lost due to aging.\r"

We prospectively studied renal urate handling in 23 patients and reviewed the records of 73 consecutive patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC), who were seen in our AIDS clinic between March 1985 and April 1988, to determine the incidence, significance, and, when possible, the cause of hypouricemia. Hypouricemia was defined as serum urate less than or equal to 0.18 mmol/L (3 mg/dL). Renal clearance studies were performed in 23 patients, 10 hypouricemic and 13 nonhypouricemic. Eight patients (six with hypouricemia) underwent central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring, which was performed for clinical signs and symptoms of extracellular volume depletion. Fourteen (eight with hypouricemia) had daily urine urate measured. Hypouricemia was found in 21 (21.9%) of 96 patients. It was more common in females and intravenous (IV) drug abusers, and was associated with more opportunistic illnesses, particularly mycobacterium avium intracellulare (MAI) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections. Hypouricemia occurred in three patients with ARC and 18 patients with AIDS and was associated with cerebral atrophy in all 12 hypouricemic and 14 of 28 nonhypouricemic patients who had cranial computed tomography (CT) scans. During a comparable follow-up period, 71.4% of the hypouricemic as compared with 38.7% of nonhypouricemic patients died. Eleven developed hypouricemia as outpatients. Fractional excretion of uric acid (FEua) was elevated in the eight patients with CVP less than 1 cm of water, and in 10 of 10 with and nine of 13 without hypouricemia, despite CVP less than 1 cm water in eight.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Parameters studied were total peritoneal WBC yield, percentage and absolute number of various WBC types, and expression of WBC receptors known to be involved in normal host defense mechanisms. WBCs were obtained from peritoneal dialysis effluents (overnight dwell), which were collected at monthly intervals for 6 to 8 months from eight CAPD patients--four with a history of high peritonitis incidence (HPI) (more than two episodes in 12 months) and four with a history of low peritonitis incidence (LPI) (no episodes in more than 24 months). Our results demonstrated that there was no significant difference in the overall mean total cell yields or absolute cell counts between the two patient groups. WBC differentials, although differing somewhat among patients, stayed quite stable over time for an individual patient and there was no significant difference between the two patient groups. Analysis of receptors on the peritoneal WBC was performed using flow cytometry and fluorescein-conjugated chemotactic factors (C5a and fMet-Leu-Phe-Lys), as well as monoclonal antibodies specific for Fc receptors and complement receptors, CR1 (CD35) and CR3 (CD11b). Although there was a trend toward increased expression of all these receptors in the HPI patients, there was no significant difference in the fluorescence intensity of peritoneal neutrophils or macrophages that expressed these receptors between the two patient groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Subclavian vein stenosis and/or thrombosis had occurred and were shown in five of 44 patients who had arteriovenous access created distal to the venous outlet obstruction, resulting in the loss of three of five of these accesses. In view of the fact that subclavian vein stenosis or occlusion is not associated with any clinical findings and we were unable to identify any predisposing factors associated with the use of the catheters, all patients who have had previous subclavian vein catheters probably should be evaluated to determine the patency of the subclavian vein before creation of a permanent access in that arm.\r"

The ultrastructure of 2,400 heart muscle cells and nuclei was studied. Fractional volumes of main cell components, mitochondrial surface density, and mitochondrial surface: volume ratio were calculated in 480 micrographs. After 10 minutes of ischemia we observed signs of sarcolemmal fragility, mitochondrial swelling, and lipid droplet accumulation. After 20 minutes of ischemia sarcolemmal fragmentation, chromatin clumping or margination and a maximal cytoplasmic edema were evident. The fractional volume of mitochondria was equally increased in ischemic zones of all groups. In both normal and ischemic zones there was a tendency toward smaller fractional volumes of lipid droplets during ischemia. In the normal zone there was mild cytoplasmic edema and slight mitochondrial swelling 10 minutes after occlusion as compared with the sham group. The present study demonstrates that a large proportion of cardiac myocytes undergoes severe damage within 20 minutes of coronary occlusion.\r"

Sections were examined for Ia antigen expression using immunohistologic techniques, and in situ quantification of Ia antigen was made using an immunogold method. Epidermal keratinocytes expressed Ia antigen before the grafts were rejected and the amount of Ia antigen expression increased and exceeded the amount of Ia antigen of Langerhans cells during the course of rejection. The progressive increase in class II antigen expression on EKs correlated with the appearance and relative accumulation of dermal lymphocytic cells. On the other hand, Ia antigen was not expressed on vascular endothelial cells during rejection. Our results suggest that the Ia-positive keratinocytes can serve as target cells in skin rejection of limb allografts. The immunogold technique we used seems most pertinent for a quantitative examination of cell-surface antigens in situ.\r"

Transformed clones were selected in G418-containing medium at a rate of 10(-4) per cell. All transformed clones were immortalized and contained in the early passages two free recombined plasmids derived from pSV3-neo. At advanced passages pSV3-neo sequences were found integrated in the cellular genome. Transformed cells had an altered morphology and growth pattern that differed among clones. Some clones reached high density in low-serum medium. All the clones stained positively for the intranuclear T antigen. Some clones had distinct transcripts for the large T and small t antigens, while in others only larger or truncated transcripts were found. Alpha-actin filaments were visualized by immunofluorescent staining in all the clones, but Northern blot analysis revealed a significant reduction in transcripts for this actin. All the transformed clones accumulated, to a variable extent, cholesteryl esters after incubation with beta very low-density lipoprotein. Six of the eight transformed clones maintained a diploid chromosome number, but there was an increase in structural chromosome aberrations, predominantly dicentrics. Transfection of pSV3-neo into rabbit vascular SMCs is an efficient model for obtaining transformed clonal populations. These clones show some phenotypic changes that may be relevant to the study of atherogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "The expression of cytokeratin (CK) polypeptides was studied in 59 transitional cell carcinomas (TCC) of the urinary tract of different grade and stage. Using a panel of 14 polypeptide-specific monoclonal CK-antibodies we identified immunohistochemically 8 different CKs separately, ie, CKs 4, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 18, and 19, while in immunoblotting studies CK5 expression was detected indirectly by using the antibody RCK102, recognizing CK5 + 8. In low-grade TCCs (G1-G2), the CK distribution was comparable to that in normal urothelium, however with a variable expression of CK13 in the different tumors and a uniform distribution of CK7. In higher-grade TCCs (G3), a decrease in CK13 expression was observed, particularly in the areas of muscle invasion. Furthermore, the appearance and increasing expression of CK14 (not present in normal urothelium or G1 TCCs) with higher grade and stage was striking. With tumor progression changes in epitope configurations of CK8 and CK18 were detected, as concluded from immunohistochemical assays with the panel of monoclonal antibodies for each of these two CKs. In extreme cases this resulted in differential staining patterns of the invasive and noninvasive components within one tumor. In 7 of 32 G3 TCCs, some of which showed areas with evident squamous differentiation, a decrease in the expression of CK7 and/or CK8 was seen. We conclude that tumor progression in TCCs is associated with discrete changes of CK expression, which can be detected using monoclonal antibodies.\r"

Variable, but generally small, numbers of gamma/delta lymphocytes are present in peripheral blood and in all lymphoid tissues. The vast majority, greater than or equal to 90%, of lymphoid tissue delta lymphocytes reside in interfollicular (T-cell) zones. Approximately 90% of delta thymocytes are present in the thymic medulla. The percentage of CD3-positive T cells that express delta are: spleen 12.5 +/- 8.1%, peripheral blood 4.0 +/- 3.1%, appendix 2.9 +/- 1%, lymph node 2.2 +/- 1%, thymus 1.4 +/- 0.5%, and tonsil 0.7 +/- 0.5%. We further demonstrated that 1) gamma/delta-thymocytes and gamma/delta peripheral lymphocytes express T-cell lineage restricted antigens CD3 and CD2 but only a variable subset, 30% to 90%, express T-cell lineage associated antigens CD5 and/or CD8; (2) approximately 60% of gamma/delta thymocytes express low-density CD4 while all gamma/delta peripheral lymphocytes lack detectable CD4; 3) gamma/delta lymphocytes lack natural killer (NK), macrophage, and B-cell associated antigens CD16, CD14, and CD20, respectively, but greater than or equal to 70% of gamma/delta T lymphocytes express CD11b, Leu7, and NKH-1, antigens, which are also expressed by suppressor/cytotoxic and NK cells; and 4) a large subpopulation, approximately 25%, of gamma/delta thymocytes are in S1-G2 phase, while greater than or equal to 98% of gamma/delta peripheral lymphocytes are small lymphocytes in G0-G1 phase and lack activation/proliferation markers. Together these results indicate that gamma/delta lymphocytes are resting, mature T cells that probably play a primary role in suppressor/cytotoxic phenomena. They also indicate that gamma/delta lymphocytes variably express multiple-cell surface antigens associated with various cell lineages, suggesting that gamma/delta lymphocytes represent a considerably more heterogeneous cell population than previously appreciated and that they may actually subserve multiple functions.\r"

Rats were depleted of platelets (mean platelet count less than 20,000/mm3) with goat anti-rat platelet IgG before induction of GN and platelet depletion was maintained for 48 hours. At 72 hours sections were immunostained for cyclin, an S-phase-related nuclear antigen, to identify proliferating cells, and for the common leukocyte antigen (CD45) to identify infiltrating leukocytes. Platelet depleted rats had fewer proliferating resident glomerular cells (CD45-, cyclin+) compared to controls (0.8 +/- 0.5 vs. 2.8 +/- 1.4 cells/glom cross section, P less than 0.01) and better renal function (creatinine 1.07 +/- 0.12 vs. 1.27 +/- 0.15 mg/dl, P less than 0.05). These effects were not due to changes in circulating or glomerular leukocyte counts, complement, or glomerular antibody binding. These studies provide the first direct evidence that platelets mediate glomerular (probably mesangial cell) proliferation in antibody-mediated GN.\r"

  ".W": "Expression of the IL-2 receptor (Tac antigen/CD25) is documented in malignant lymphomas. Because IL-2 is a major lymphocyte growth factor, an IL-2-dependent growth could be involved in the proliferation of Tac-positive lymphomas. Indeed such a mechanism has been demonstrated experimentally for the growth of T-cell lines. To investigate this point in human lymphomas, we used in situ hybridization to analyze the expression of the IL-2 gene in 20 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, among which 12 expressed the IL-2 receptor. Nine of these were anaplastic large cell lymphomas expressing the Ki-1-related antigen. We here show that IL-2-producing cells are present in all the lymphomas we analyzed. As a mean, there is no significant difference in the percentage of IL-2-producing cells between Tac-positive and -negative lymphomas. However, the level of IL-2 production is highly heterogeneous in both groups, and the highest density of IL-2-producing cells was observed in 2 Tac-positive lymphomas. Simultaneous detection of cellular antigens and of IL-2 mRNA demonstrates that IL-2 is produced by reactive T cells rather than by tumor cells. These results suggest that if IL-2 is involved in the growth of Tac-positive lymphomas, it acts as a paracrine, rather than an autocrine, factor.\r"

  ".W": "Calcifying matrix vesicles (MVs) are released from chondrocytes and osteoblasts in monolayer culture. In the present studies, we tested the ability of rachitic versus normal rat growth plate chondrocytes in micromass or monolayer primary cultures to produce MVs. Unlike earlier reports of in vitro MV biogenesis by chicken chondrocytes in which most MVs were released into the medium, we found that most of the released rat matrix vesicles were entrapped in a newly formed cartilaginous matrix enveloping the cells. These matrix-associated MVs could be isolated by mild collagenase treatment and concentrated by differential centrifugation. Vesicle production slowed in the older 2- to 4-week-old cultures and, unlike vesicle release from cultured chicken chondrocytes, active vesicle production did not show a second burst of activity at 3 to 4 weeks. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity diminished with time in culture in cells and matrix vesicles, suggesting a decrease in differentiative expression. Protein profiles on SDS polyacrylamide gels of native matrix vesicles and culture-derived MVs from rachitic and normal cells were quite similar and showed a typical simplified protein pattern as compared to chondrocyte plasma membrane proteins. There were distinctive proteins migrating at 130, 80 to 95, 66, 43, 20, and 14 kd. Culture-derived MVs showed vigorous in vitro calcifying activity that was ALP related. We conclude that 1) rachitic chondrocytes are essentially normal in their matrix vesicle production; 2) matrix entrapment of MVs is a characteristic of rat chondrocyte cultures; and 3) culture-produced MVs are similar to native MVs in protein profile and calcifiability, and thus can be studied as a model for normal MV composition and calcification.\r"

In contrast, all 19 well- and moderately differentiated pulmonary adenocarcinomas were completely negative, and of the total 88 non-mesotheliomatous malignancies studied, staining comparable to the mesotheliomas was seen in only 6 tumors (2 pulmonary adenocarcinomas, 2 adenocarcinomas of the breast, 1 adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, and 1 melanoma), although limited, weaker staining was seen in additional cases. Five of the six strongly to moderately positive nonmesotheliomatous tumors had immunoreactivity for complementary immunoreactants (CEA, Leu-M1, S-100 protein, HMB-45). Our results with ME1, the first monoclonal antibody that recognizes malignant mesothelial cells, provides a basis for using this reagent in the differential diagnosis of tumors of the pleura and peritoneum.\r"

  ".U": "90164685\r", 
  ".W": "Arterionephrosclerosis is diagnosed at autopsy by assessing the severity and extent of certain structural features in the renal cortical arteries seen in tissue sections. These features are characterized by fibrotic intimal thickening and medial shrinkage, a progressive change from the youthful muscular pattern to the elderly sclerotic pattern. Intimal fibrosis can be quantified by expressing intimal thickness as a percentage of the arterial outer diameter (% OD). The magnitude of arterionephrosclerosis, found by averaging the measures of intimal fibrosis seen in a kidney, can be calculated from age and mean blood pressure, using a standard prediction function. This function is a quantitative statement of a fundamentally important principle: just as blood pressure is a continuous variable that can range from low to high levels, arterionephrosclerosis is also a continuous variable that can take any degree of abnormality of arterial structure from minimal to maximal. Furthermore, a correspondence exists between the two quantities so that each can be calculated from the other. In this study, a correlation of 0.966 was found between the observed and the calculated magnitudes of arterionephrosclerosis over 10-year age groups from 25 to 34 years to 65 to 74 years, using group average data within age groups. For individuals, however, the correlations between observed and calculated magnitudes of arterionephrosclerosis were about 0.6 in a former study of elderly subjects and about 0.1 in the subjects aged 6 to 27 years in this study. The average growth rate of arterionephrosclerosis was found to be about 0.25 %OD per year from ages 15 to 54 years, and about 0.13 %OD per year from ages 55 to 70 years; the growth rate did not increase in the oldest age groups when blood pressure averaged higher than blood pressure in more youthful subjects. These and other findings are consistent with the view that the reason a correlation exists between blood pressure and arterionephrosclerosis could be because the magnitude of arterionephrosclerosis is one of the determinants that sets the level of blood pressure. From this perspective, each individual can be viewed as having other determinants of blood pressure, methodologic or biologic, which add to or subtract from the values set by age and arterionephrosclerosis. When subjects are pooled into groups, so that individual determinants balance out, the group average levels of mean blood pressure could be interpreted as reflecting little other than the magnitude of arterionephrosclerosis at each specific age.\r"

The inclusions consist of aggregates of parallel fine fibrils, often in contact with lipid droplets and partially limited by a membrane. The inclusions have affinity for Congo red and exhibit a bright green birefringence after this staining. Therefore, the inclusions can be regarded as a form of senile amyloid.\r"

Disease was induced consistently in rats but never in mice. Unlike rats, mice were resistant to downmodulation by cyclosporine of class II antigen expression in the thymic medulla. In rats with CSIA, MHC class I and II antigen expression was induced on all target epithelia, frequently before mononuclear infiltration or tissue injury, consistent with a role for MHC antigens in selecting cells for injury. Much increased numbers of strongly class II-positive interstitial dendritic cells were present throughout the body, even in tissues not involved by CSIA. Thus, class II expression alone is insufficient to lead to cell injury in CSIA.\r"

Projections based on the fitted model suggest that a ban on legalized abortion today would have a major impact on adolescent childbearing in New York City as well as other parts of the country, although the magnitude of the change would vary according to local conditions.\r"

An average of 18 cases per year of Salmonella arizona were reported in the county between 1980 and 1987.

Logistic regression tested whether alcohol and drug use, perceived susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), severity of HIV if infected, effectiveness of condoms in preventing infection, barriers to condom use, and behavioral cues such as exposure to media or personal communication about acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were independently related to condom use. Among sexually active respondents, (61 percent of those interviewed) 31 percent reported always using condoms. Respondents who believed condoms are effective in preventing HIV transmission and worried they can get AIDS were 3.1 and 1.8 times, respectively, more likely to use condoms all the time. Respondents who carried condoms and who had discussed AIDS with a physician were 2.7 and 1.7 times, respectively, more likely to use them. Those who believed condoms do not reduce sexual pleasure and would not be embarrassed if asked to use them were 3.1 and 2.4 times, respectively, more likely to use condoms. Teens who averaged five or more drinks daily or used marijuana in the previous month were 2.8 and 1.9 times, respectively, less likely to use condoms.

Those counseling adolescents about HIV should assess and discuss beliefs outlined in the Health Belief Model, as well as their alcohol and drug use.\r"

  ".W": "This study analyzes how the growing proportion of women in the United States physician population will affect the amount and type of physician services available to the US population. Female physicians work fewer hours per week, are slightly less likely to be in patient care, and tend to enter different specialties than male physicians. Female physicians also have higher retirement rates than male physicians, but due to their lower mortality rates, have work lives nearly as long as male physicians. We examined how the changing composition of the physician population will affect the availability of physician services by comparing historical and projected trends for the number of active post-residency physicians with comparable trends for a full-time-equivalent measure of physician supply. The full-time-equivalent measure takes into account the different labor supply behavior of key subpopulations (e.g., women and graduates of US versus foreign medical schools). The results suggest that the changing composition of the physician population will reduce the growth of effective physician supply between 1986 and 2010 but only by four percentage points.\r"

Fifty-seven patients (1.1 percent) were found to have Cryptosporidium. Seasonal peaks in positivity were observed in the spring, summer, and early autumn months. In children, younger age was associated with higher positivity rate of cryptosporidiosis. As a result of these surveillance efforts, Oregon's first known outbreak of cryptosporidiosis was detected and investigated during 1988. Twenty-five persons were infected, including children, parents, and staff associated with two day care centers. The cost of routine screening for Cryptosporidium was $1.13 per specimen in our laboratory, and we consider it useful.\r"

The correlation coefficient for per capita sales and per capita self-reported consumption for the 21 states was 0.81. Per capita sales were also significantly correlated with the prevalence of self-reported heavier drinking, binge drinking, and drinking and driving; the corresponding correlation coefficients were 0.74, 0.59, and 0.51. These findings suggest that states with higher per capita sales of alcohol also have higher rates of self-reported consumption and drinking patterns suggestive of high-risk behavior.\r"

Successively lower rates were observed for women covered by non-Kaiser health maintenance organizations (26.8 percent), Medi-Cal (22.9 percent), Kaiser (19.7 percent), self-pay (19.3 percent), and Indigent Services (15.6 percent). Vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) occurred more than twice as frequently in women covered by Kaiser (19.9 percent) and Indigent Services (24.8 percent), compared to those with private insurance (8.1 percent). Sizable, although less pronounced, associations between payment source and cesarean section use were noted for the indications of breech presentation, dystocia, and fetal distress. Accounting for maternal age and race/ethnicity did not alter these findings. Variations in the use of cesarean section have a substantial financial impact on health care payors.\r"
