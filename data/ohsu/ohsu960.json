There are no established normal human levels of endothelin-1 or endothelin-3 in the cerebrospinal fluid. We measured cerebrospinal fluid endothelin-1 and endothelin-3 levels in five groups of patients: normal controls, patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral vasospasm, patients with severe head injuries, patients undergoing temporal lobectomy for intractable epilepsy, and a patient with a gunshot injury to the thoracic spine. Endothelin-3 levels were significantly elevated in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and may participate in cerebral vasospasm and subsequent neurologic deterioration.\r"

  ".W": "Nine patients suffering closed head injury were studied using transcranial Doppler ultrasound recording of the basal cerebral arteries. On admission, six patients had Glasgow Coma Scores of 7 or less, while three had initial scores of 8-10. Eight of the nine patients (82%) developed abnormally high mean velocities (greater than or equal to 110 cm/s) in one or more vessels. The onset, duration, and amplitude of the altered flow velocities were somewhat different from those that are seen with vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, which tend to occur later. Cerebral angiography in one of the study patients confirmed the presence of vasospasm. Multivariate regression analysis showed a definite correlation between the velocities recorded, even when abnormally elevated, and concurrent pH and PCO2 measurements (p = 0.01, R2 = 0.23). Although these results suggest that the cerebral vasculature retains its vasoreactivity following head injury, arguing against vasoparalysis, inconsistencies found in some of the patients lead us to think that both vasospasm and vasoparalysis may occur following head trauma but that they may have different temporal profiles.\r"

A thermal diffusion flow probe with a pressure port is left in contact with the cortex at craniotomy. Postoperative intracranial pressure--cortical blood flow can be monitored and acute changes or trends are readily detected. The thermal flow probe has been previously compared with radioactive xenon (133Xe) clearance and hydrogen clearance methods of measuring cortical blood flow in animals. The technique gives a real-time quantitative indication of flow. Changes in cortical blood flow can be observed within a few seconds and the effects of treatment can be readily observed. Changes in flow due to vasospasm have been demonstrated in subarachnoid hemorrhage. It is anticipated that information learned from this method will aid in the management of patients with head trauma, tumors, and subarachnoid hemorrhage.\r"

More rarely, familial trigeminal neuralgia has been described in the setting of hereditary peripheral neuropathy, especially Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. We describe patients from two different families with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and medically intractable trigeminal neuralgia. Both patients were successfully treated by percutaneous retrogasserian glycerol rhizolysis.

Eighty patients with known coronary artery disease, positive treadmill stress test results and greater than or equal to 2 ischemic episodes during a 24-hour period of Holter monitoring were studied. The lowest and the highest ischemic thresholds were determined for each patient. The mean lowest ischemic threshold was 85 beats/min, and the mean highest ischemic threshold was 109 beats/min. The highest ischemic threshold was identical to ischemic threshold values noted during exercise. Of the 895 ischemic episodes, 654 (74%) were preceded by a moderate (greater than 10%) increase in heart rate. The variability of ischemic threshold (difference in percentage between the highest and lowest ischemic thresholds) increased with the number of ischemic episodes (range 2 to 60%). However, in different patients with a similar number of ischemic episodes, different variability was observed. These differences in ischemic thresholds are probably indirect indicators of the vasomotor activity of the coronary arteries in different patients.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 1,975 plasma diltiazem concentrations were obtained from 1,067 patients enrolled in a multicenter secondary intervention study of diltiazem after acute myocardial infarction. To evaluate the determinants and significance of diltiazem concentrations in this patient population, we related drug concentrations to a variety of clinical variables recorded on the case history forms. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that (1) time from the last drug dose, (2) drug dose taken, (3) patient height (an index of lean body weight), and (4) patient age were important determinants of plasma concentration. For an equivalent dose, plasma diltiazem concentrations in a 75-year-old patient were about double those of a 25-year-old patient. Total weight and drug dose prescribed did not significantly affect plasma concentrations. Whereas drug concentrations were higher (p = 0.01) among patients with left-sided heart failure, they were not altered by renal dysfunction, hepatic disease or beta blockers. Diltiazem concentrations were a significant determinant of diastolic arterial pressure (p less than 10(-9), but neither systolic pressure nor heart rate were significantly related to diltiazem concentration. The overall incidence of adverse experiences was not related to drug concentrations, but the occurrence of second- and third-degree atrioventricular block in the coronary care unit and the need for a temporary pacemaker were substantially higher among patients with a drug concentration greater than 150 ng/ml (7.4 and 1.9%, respectively) than among patients with lower concentrations (2.6% for atrioventricular block, 0.3% for pacemaker; p = 0.02 for each). The risk of atrioventricular block was particularly increased by high diltiazem concentrations in the face of acute inferior infarction. These results suggest that diltiazem's pharmacologic and clinical effects in a large population are concentration-related, and that the consideration of patient size, age, and left ventricular function in selecting a diltiazem dose may allow for effective drug therapy with a reduced likelihood of adverse effects.\r"

The mean time interval from onset of symptoms to thrombolytic therapy was 85 +/- 51 minutes in group A and 137 +/- 50 minutes in group B (p less than 0.0005). In 91% of the patients, thrombolytic therapy was administered less than 3 hours after symptom onset. Complication rates during the pre- and in-hospital period were low and did not differ between groups. Three patients died (1 in group A, 2 in group B) from reinfarction 7 to 14 days after admission. Left-sided cardiac catheterization before discharge revealed a patency rate in the infarct-related artery of 61% in group A and 67% in group B (difference not significant). Global left ventricular function and regional wall motion at the infarct site did not differ significantly between group A and B (ejection fraction 51 +/- 10%, n = 28 vs 53 +/- 14%, n = 28; wall motion -2.3 +/- 1.3 vs -2.2 +/- 1.1 standard deviation, respectively). Also, peak creatine kinase did not differ significantly (838 +/- 634 U/liter in group A vs 924 +/- 595 U/liter in group B). Prehospital thrombolysis using a bolus injection of urokinase has a low risk when performed by a trained physician with a mobile care unit. The saving of 45 minutes in the early stage of an acute infarction through prehospital thrombolysis did not appear to be important for salvage of myocardial function.\r"

Patients exercised to the same work load as each isotope was studied. Normal and hypoperfused left ventricular mass was determined with an automated method. Estimated total left ventricular mass was similar for both stress/redistribution Tl-201 and stress/rest Tc-99m MIBI images. The mean estimated defect size in the redistribution Tl-201 images was 32 +/- 34.7 vs 33 +/- 38.4 g in the resting Tc-99m MIBI studies (difference not significant). The individual determinations of defect mass were highly correlated (r = 0.93; p less than 0.0001). Estimated defect size in the stress Tl-201 images (52 +/- 46.2 g) was significantly larger than the exercise Tc-99m MIBI estimates of defect mass (42 +/- 39.9 g; p less than 0.05).

Partial redistribution of Tc-99m MIBI could explain the discordance. Stress Tc-99m MIBI SPECT defect size determined by visual interpretation or by the use of isocount analysis may be smaller than what is seen with stress Tl-201 SPECT.\r"

  ".W": "A low primary success and high restenosis rate after recanalization of chronic total occlusions by conventional coronary angioplasty have encouraged the application of new interventional techniques like excimer-laser angioplasty. In 39 patients with a coronary occlusion for 1 to 12 months, recanalization was attempted by laser angioplasty through a multifiber-catheter coupled to a pulsed XeCl excimer laser. After successful passage of the occlusion by a standard guidewire in 27 patients (69%), the laser catheter was advanced over the central guidewire and crossed the occlusion in 25 patients (64%). In 2 patients with unsuccessful passage of the laser catheter, the subsequent attempt with a low profile balloon catheter also failed. In 19 of the 25 patients with successful laser recanalization, the residual stenosis exceeded 50% and was therefore followed by additional balloon angioplasty. The average residual stenosis after laser was 61 +/- 17% of the vessel diameter, and after balloon angioplasty 28 +/- 9% (n = 19), whereas after laser angioplasty alone it was 38 +/- 5% (n = 6). No complications associated with the laser application were observed. Angiographic control after 24 hours showed a reocclusion of 2 (8%) recanalized vessels. In this pilot study, laser angioplasty proved to be a safe and feasible method for the treatment of chronic total coronary occlusions. Because it was necessary to guide the catheter by a central wire, the primary success was limited by a successful passage of the wire of the occlusion. The rate of stand-alone laser angioplasty has to be increased by future improvements of the technique to enable a comparative evaluation of this method with conventional angioplasty.\r"

  ".W": "Exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias occur often after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), but their prognostic significance is unknown. Two hundred patients examined by exercise electrocardiography and cardiac catheterization (including left ventriculography, bypass graft and native coronary artery angiography) before and 3 months after CABG were prospectively followed up. Exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias occurred more often after (49 of 200 patients, 24.5%) than before (32 of 200 patients, 16.0%) CABG (p less than 0.05). There were no differences between the patients with and without ventricular arrhythmias in the prevalence of graft patency (79 vs 80%) or the postoperative ejection fraction (57 +/- 9 vs 57 +/- 12%). Ten cardiac deaths occurred during the mean follow-up time of 61 +/- 19 months, 8 of which were witnessed sudden cardiac deaths. All cardiac deaths occurred in patients who did not have exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias after CABG. The postoperative ejection fraction was lower in the cardiac death patients (42 +/- 16%) than in the survivors (58 +/- 10%) (p less than 0.01). No other clinical or angiographic variable predicted the occurrence of cardiac death. Thus, the prevalence of exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias increases after CABG, but the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias does not indicate an increased risk of cardiac death.\r"

  ".W": "Forty-three ambulatory patients with angina of increasing frequency underwent continuous monitoring of left ventricular (LV) function for an average of 2.9 +/- 1.9 hours to determine the incidence and temporal sequence of LV dysfunction, ST-segment depression and chest pain. Indicators of ischemia were: a decrease in ejection fraction greater than 5% lasting greater than 1 minute; horizontal or downsloping ST-segment depression of greater than or equal to 1 mm; or onset of the patient's typical chest pain complex, or a combination of these. During the monitoring interval, subjects performed daily activities such as sitting, walking, climbing stairs and eating. In 11 patients, 22 episodes of chest pain or ST-segment depression, or both, were observed. Eighteen episodes were accompanied by a decrease in ejection fraction (9 patients); chest pain accompanied the decrease in ejection fraction during 13 episodes, whereas ST-segment changes occurred during 7. In 12 of 13 episodes the decrease in ejection fraction began earlier than the onset of chest pain, whereas in 1 patient ejection fraction decrease and chest pain onset started at the same time. The average interval from a decrease in ejection fraction to the onset of chest pain was 56 +/- 41 seconds (range 0 to 120). ST changes occurred after the onset of a decrease in ejection fraction in 6 of 7 episodes. The average interval from the onset of ejection fraction decrease and the onset of ST change was 99 +/- 91 seconds. These data suggest that LV dysfunction manifested by a decrease in ejection fraction is an earlier indicator of myocardial ischemia than is angina pectoris or electrocardiographic evidence of ischemia.\r"

The protocol followed a stepwise design: first, conventional guidewires and low-profile balloons were used, followed by \"balloon-on-the-wire\" systems (Probe, Ace) or by a shaft-enforced, tip-deflecting catheter (Omniflex). In 97 patients with occlusions of 2 to 12 weeks' duration, recanalization was achieved in 51 patients (53%) with the conventional approach and in 29 patients with the new devices (balloon-on-the-wire [n = 5], Omniflex [n = 24]), thereby raising the success rate to 82%. In 57 occlusions of greater than 12 weeks' duration, the recanalization attempt was successful in 58%, mediated in 16 patients (28%) by the Omniflex catheter and in 5 patients by balloon-on-the-wire systems. There were no life-threatening complications and only 1 (0.6%) emergency bypass operation was necessary. New angioplasty devices are therefore of considerable value in the attempt to improve the results of coronary angioplasty in chronic total occlusions.\r"

Aspirin treatment started 24 hours before, and heparin 6 hours and phenprocoumon 2 days after surgery. The results of the vein graft angiography and the clinical outcome 3 months postoperatively did not differ: 22% of 218 vein graft distal anastomoses in the aspirin group and 20% of 272 in the anticoagulant group were occluded. At least 1 occluded distal anastomosis was present in 38% of 74 patients in the aspirin-treated group and in 39% of 86 in the anticoagulant group. Worst-case analysis of all randomized patients showed graft occlusions, cardiovascular complications or lost to follow-up in 42% of 122 aspirin-treated patients compared with 41% of 113 patients treated with anticoagulants. For grafts with endarterectomy the occlusion rate was lower in the aspirin (12% of 49) than in the anticoagulant (22% of 41) group (p less than or equal to 0.05). Increased perioperative blood loss in the aspirin group (1,211 +/- 814 ml in the first 48 hours vs 874 +/- 818 ml in the anticoagulant group [p less than or equal to 0.001]) without a higher reoperation rate indicates effective platelet inhibition with low-dose aspirin. Because occlusion rates were equal but high in these patients with advanced stage of coronary artery disease, a combination of low-dose aspirin and anticoagulation should be investigated to reduce graft occlusion rates further.\r"

Arterial vasodilation was assessed by measurement of changes of forearm blood flow by mercury in Silastic strain-gauge plethysmography during brachial artery drug infusions. Forearm blood flow increased during amlodipine infusions (0.4 to 45 micrograms/min/100 ml forearm tissue) from 2.9 +/- 1.7 to a maximum of 23.6 +/- 7.6 ml/min/100 ml (687%), while sodium nitroprusside caused an increase from 3.0 +/- 1.8 to 16.2 +/- 5.4 ml/min/100 ml (449%), attesting to the importance of transmembrane calcium influx for the maintenance of vascular tone. The addition of verapamil 40 micrograms/min/100 ml to an infusion of amlodipine 44.5 micrograms/min/100 ml resulted in a further increase of forearm blood flow, from 23.6 +/- 7.6 to 34.4 +/- 9.8 ml/min/100 ml (p less than 0.05). The precise mechanisms of this finding have yet to be elucidated but may be due to interactions of the effects of the binding of these 2 chemically and pharmacologically different calcium antagonists to distinct binding sites at calcium channels. The clinical relevance of this observation for the treatment of coronary artery disease and systemic hypertension needs further study.\r"

  ".W": "Systolic left ventricular dysfunction is relatively common in even asymptomatic alcoholics, but whether diastolic function is also altered is much less well-studied. We used M-mode and Doppler echocardiography to study left ventricular size, mass, systolic function and diastolic filling in 32 alcoholics free of clinically detectable heart disease and in 15 healthy control subjects. Left ventricular mass index and posterior wall thickness were higher in alcoholics than in controls, but there was no statistically significant difference either in end-diastolic size or in systolic ventricular function. More abnormalities were found in the Doppler indexes of diastolic function, however. The alcoholics had a prolonged relaxation time (200 +/- 6 vs 184 +/- 5 ms [mean +/- standard error], p less than 0.05), a decreased peak early diastolic velocity (52 +/- 2 vs 60 +/- 3 cm/s, p less than 0.05), a slower acceleration of the early flow (410 +/- 18 vs 552 +/- 43 cm/s2, p less than 0.01), and a higher atrial-to-early peak velocity ratio (0.74 +/- 0.04 vs 0.60 +/- 0.05, p less than 0.05). This pattern of changes suggests a primary abnormality in the relaxation of the left ventricle. In multivariate analyses, the abnormalities in the Doppler indexes were independent of the duration of alcoholism, the quantity of the most recent ethanol exposure and the increased mass of the left ventricle. Impaired early filling of the left ventricle due to delayed relaxation is common in asymptomatic alcoholics and may in fact be the earliest functional sign of preclinical alcoholic cardiomyopathy.\r"

The PPS group had an average main pulmonary artery (PA) diameter similar to the control group (0.91 vs 0.96 cm, difference not significant), but had smaller branch PA diameters: right PA = 0.41 vs 0.50 cm, p less than 0.001, and left PA = 0.41 vs 0.49 cm, p less than 0.001. The PPS group also had greater peak velocities in the main PA (76 vs 63 cm/s, p less than 0.05), right PA (193 vs 118 cm/s, p less than 0.001) and left PA (187 vs 123 cm/s, p less than 0.001). Similarly, the ratio of peak velocity in the branch/main PA was greater for the PPS group: right/main PA peak velocity = 2.91 vs 1.92, p less than 0.01, and left/main PA peak velocity = 2.73 vs 1.99, p less than 0.05. The calculated right ventricular output for the PPS group was more than the control group: 437 vs 261 ml/min/kg, p less than 0.001. Hematocrits were not done on the control group, but the PPS group had an average hematocrit which was low (34%). It is concluded that patients with PPS have mild underdevelopment of the PA branches, with consequent increased flow velocity and turbulent flow. This turbulent flow may be contributed to by increased cardiac output and mild anemia.\r"

The specimens were classified according to the number and the patterns of the truncal cusps. The position of the truncal cusps was defined in relation to intracardiac structures, namely, the atrioventricular orifices. Bicuspid truncal valves were observed in 8 cases (21%), tricuspid in 22 cases (56%) and quadricuspid in 9 cases (23%). All tricuspid valves had 2 anterior and 1 posterior cusp. Great variability in the origin of the coronary arteries was observed, with a tendency for the right coronary artery to arise from the anterior right quadrant and for the left coronary artery to arise from the anterior and left quadrant. Such a tendency was observed in 50% of the bicuspid, in 59% of the tricuspid and in 66% of the quadricuspid valves. The anatomic right ventricle was always observed to be vascularized by a right coronary artery, and the anatomic left ventricle by a left coronary artery, even in cases in which there was a single coronary trunk. The anterior surface of the right ventricle was crossed by a right coronary artery in 5 cases. A single coronary artery was observed in 7 cases (18%). Embryologic considerations are offered, especially regarding the relation between the observed variability in coronary artery patterns in TA and the absence of the truncal septation.\r"

Patients were classified into 3 groups based on the equilibration of intrapericardial with right atrial and pulmonary arterial wedge pressures (mm Hg): group I (n = 16), intrapericardial pressure was less than right atrial and pulmonary arterial wedge pressures; group II (n = 13), intrapericardial pressure was equilibrated with right atrial but not pulmonary arterial wedge pressures; group III (n = 48), intrapericardial pressure was equilibrated with right atrial and pulmonary arterial wedge pressures. Pericardiocentesis produced the following changes: group I--significant (p less than 0.03) decreases in intrapericardial pressure (7 +/- 2 mm Hg), right atrial pressure (3 +/- 2 mm Hg), pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (2 +/- 2 mm Hg), and the inspiratory decrease in arterial systolic pressure (3 +/- 4 mm Hg) but no significant change in cardiac output; group II--significant (p less than 0.02) decreases in intrapericardial pressure (11 +/- 5 mm Hg), right atrial pressure (6 +/- 4 mm Hg), pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (4 +/- 5 mm Hg), and inspiratory decrease in arterial systolic pressure (8 +/- 7 mm Hg), and increase in cardiac output (1.1 +/- 1.2 liters/min); group III--significant (p less than 0.001) decreases in intrapericardial pressure (16 +/- 7 mm Hg), right atrial pressure (9 +/- 4 mm Hg), pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (8 +/- 5 mm Hg), inspiratory decrease in arterial systolic pressure (17 +/- 11 mm Hg), and increase in cardiac output (2.8 +/- 1.5 liters/min). The changes after pericardiocentesis in all parameters were significantly (p less than 0.05) greater in group III than in groups I or II except for the change in right atrial pressure, which was not significantly different in groups II versus III. The changes after pericardiocentesis indicate pericardial effusion caused the greatest abnormalities in group III but also caused significant abnormalities of pressure and flow in group II and of pressure alone in group I.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At the time of transesophageal echocardiography, 30 patients (59%) were being mechanically ventilated. Transesophageal echocardiography was performed without significant complications in 49 patients (96%), and 2 patients with heart failure had worsening of hemodynamic and respiratory difficulties after insertion of the transesophageal probe. The most frequent indication, in 25 patients (49%), was unexplained hemodynamic instability. Other indications included evaluation of mitral regurgitation severity, prosthetic valvular dysfunction, endocarditis, aortic dissection and potential donor heart. In 30 patients (59%), transesophageal echocardiography identified cardiovascular problems that could not be clearly diagnosed by transthoracic echocardiography. In the remaining patients, transesophageal echocardiography permitted confident exclusion of suspected abnormalities because of its superior imaging qualities. Cardiac surgery was prompted by transesophageal echocardiographic findings in 12 patients (24%) and these findings were confirmed at operation in all. Therefore, transesophageal echocardiography can be safely performed and has a definite role in the diagnosis and expeditious management of critically ill cardiovascular patients.\r"

  ".W": "Antibacterial chemotherapy against Helicobacter pylori is currently being assessed by open or randomized controlled clinical studies for its efficacy in eradicating this bacterium from the stomach of patients with gastritis or gastroduodenal ulcer. Whereas there is presently no \"optimal\" agent and treatment scheme, the combination of some antibiotics (metronidazole, tinidazole, amoxicillin) with bismuth salts proves definitely superior in vivo to either of these agents administered alone. Several reasons have been proposed, to explain the clinical failure after treatment: insufficient concentration of active drugs in gastric mucus, instability of some agents at an acidic pH, inappropriate formulation of drug, insufficient duration of treatment, and variable compliance of patients. Recently, it has appeared from several clinical trials that H. pylori may rapidly acquire resistance to some antibiotics, and that this event might also account for clinical failure. A critical review of the literature on H. pylori treatment indicates that association of bismuth and antibiotics or of antibiotics alone both may efficiently reduce the risk of emergence of resistance and improve the therapeutic outcome. Guidelines of treatment are suggested in order to avoid the future misuse of antibiotics that would increase selection of antibiotic-resistant H. pylori and negatively affect the ecology of the gastric microflora. Likewise, an accurate definition of a subset of patients with H. pylori who really will require treatment needs to be rapidly established.\r"

Few studies have attempted to evaluate the effect of normal aging on P and UES mechanics. Pharyngeal and upper esophageal sphincter dynamics were studied in 10 healthy elderly adults (age greater than 60; range 62-79 yr) and 10 younger adults (age less than 60; range 24-59 yr). A solid-state intraluminal transducer system was used with a proximal unidirectional Konigsberg microtransducer and a circumferential (sphincter) transducer located 5 cm distally. Mean resting UES pressure was significantly (p less than 0.05) lower in the elderly than in the younger subjects (52 +/- 5 vs 72 +/- 6 (SE)) mm Hg. A significant inverse relation (R = -0.54; p less than 0.02) was found between age and resting UES pressure. Time from peak of pharyngeal contraction to UES nadir was significantly (p less than 0.05) shortened in the healthy elderly vs younger controls (10 +/- 30 vs 90 +/- 20 ms) during dry swallows. Our studies indicate that aging is associated with lower resting UES pressure and delayed UES relaxation, relative to the pharyngeal peak.\r"

H. pylori positivity or negativity was defined as the concordance of two of the following tests: RUT, microbiologic culture, and histologic examination on bioptic samples. RUT sensitivity was 100%, whereas specificity was 87.5%. The presence of nodular antritis had a sensitivity of 96.4% and specificity of 87.5% in H. pylori infection diagnosis. The predictivity value of combined RUT and nodular antritis, whether positive or negative, was 100%. Only in case of discordance do we suggest the utilization of other expensive tools for diagnosis of H. pylori infection.\r"

Four different stains and culture for H. pylori were performed on biopsy specimens from the gastric antrum. Sixteen (40%) of 40 patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex (ARC) were diagnosed to be infected with H. pylori versus 14 (39%) of 36 age-matched control patients. Eight of 15 AIDS/ARC patients without AIDS-related esophagogastroduodenal findings (53%) were infected with H. pylori versus 8/25 (32%) with endoscopic findings typical of AIDS. No invasion of the lamina propria by H. pylori was noted in any patient. Active chronic gastritis was present in 60% of AIDS/ARC patients and 61% of controls. Fifty-eight and 59%, respectively, of active chronic gastritis cases were infected with H. pylori. All the H. pylori infections, except one, were found in patients with chronic gastritis. In AIDS/ARC patients, H. pylori infection and active chronic gastritis are as common as in other patients referred for upper endoscopy. They may play a pathogenic role, especially when endoscopic AIDS-related findings are lacking. Cell-mediated immune deficiency does not appear to increase the risk of infection with H. pylori.\r"

  ".W": "An epidemiological study of ulcerative colitis was performed in the Upper Galilee, Israel, over a 20-yr period (1967-1986). The average annual incidence of ulcerative colitis was 2.23 per 100,000 population, and the prevalence on December 31, 1986, was 44.58 per 100,000. Considering the fact that strict steps were taken to include only definite cases, these figures are probably an underestimation. An increase of the average annual incidence from 0.88 in the period 1967-1976 to 3.79 in 1977-1986 was found. When the data were stratified according to ethnic groups, the highest average annual incidence and the highest point prevalence was found in Israeli-born Jews (6.9 and 138.2 per 100,000 population, respectively). When Jewish residence patterns were compared, the highest average annual incidence and point prevalence were found among Kibbutz members (5.52 and 110.39, respectively), and the lowest (1.94 and 38.76) among Moshav inhabitants. There were 10 Arab patients with an average annual incidence of 0.96 and a point prevalence of 19.27. There were 25 women and 28 men (female:male ratio of 0.89). Among the Jews, the female:male ratio was 1.04. Peak incidence was found in the 25- to 34-yr-old range. No second peak was noticed. Anemia was demonstrated in 66.6% of the women and 27.5% of the men in our study. We suggest that the increase in UC incidence and prevalence in Israeli and Asia/africa-born Jew and in Arabs in the Upper Galilee points toward environmental factors in the etiology of this disease.\r"

Only 20% of patients developed measurable anti-HBs. One who failed to develop anti-HBs developed chronic hepatitis B after exposure to her infected sexual partner. Type of liver disease in the native liver, age, sex, sexual preference, timing of immunization (before or after transplantation), and dosage of hepatitis B vaccine did not seem to explain the lack of immunologic response to hepatitis B vaccine. It is presumed that immunosuppression, both from the underlying disease and from immunosuppressive medications, best explains our findings. Liver transplantation patients infrequently benefit from hepatitis B vaccine. It is possible that other vaccines given to prevent viral and bacterial illness may also fail to elicit immunologic response in such patients.\r"

Data were examined from 1970-1977 and 1980-1987. In the early sample of 460 cirrhotic patients, 33% had gallstone disease, contrasted with 12% in the controls. In the 1980s, among 299 patients, 46% had gallstone disease, whereas it was present in 13% of the controls. The prevalence of stones was significantly greater in the patients than in the controls for both time periods and, among the patients, was significantly greater in the 1980s than in the 1970s (p less than 0.05). A comparison of cirrhotic patients with and without gallstones indicated a significantly higher incidence of ascites in the patients with gallstones. The gallstones in cirrhotics were more frequently pigmented than in the controls in both time periods. In 100 living patients with advanced cirrhosis studied by sonography during 1987 and 1989, the prevalence of gallstones was 43%, almost the same as the autopsy sample from 1980-1987. In these cirrhotics, ascites, encephalopathy, and varices were more prevalent in the patients with stones than those without. We conclude that pigmented gallstones are increasing in cirrhosis of the liver related to the severity of the liver disease.\r"

Plasma levels of lipidic phosphorus, esterified cholesterol, and TG also were measured, and the unsaturation index (UI) was calculated for each fraction. Total plasma concentrations of saturated FA, linoleate, and polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) were lower in cirrhotics than in controls. This profile was also found in plasma levels of PL- and CE-associated FA. No detectable amounts of C20:3n9 were found in cirrhotic patients. Percent FA distribution of lipid fractions showed a lower percentage of linoleate and PUFA and a higher relative amount of saturated and monoenoic FA in cirrhotics than in controls. As a consequence, the UI of PL and CE was diminished in liver cirrhosis. Linoleate and PUFA deficiency was more marked in CE than in PL, as shown by the number of patients with values below the 5th percentile of the control group, suggesting an attempt to maintain the unsaturation of PL as the most important component of cell membranes. Hepatic failure, poor essential FA intake, and malnutrition are some of the possible etiologic factors for PUFA deficiency in cirrhosis. Their relative contribution to plasma FA abnormalities, as well as the clinical and pathophysiological consequences of PUFA deficit in cirrhotic patients, requires further investigation.\r"

We have prospectively compared two ascites culture methods in cirrhotic patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: 1) conventional (on chocolate agar, blood agar, Mac Conkay agar, and thioglycolate broth), and 2) modified [inoculation of 10 ml of ascites in a tryptic soy broth (TSB) blood culture bottle at the patient's bedside]. In a 21-month period, 70 episodes of SBP were diagnosed according to our criteria in 60 cirrhotic patients. Both culture methods were performed simultaneously. The conventional grew bacteria in 40 episodes (57%), whereas the modified grew bacteria in 54 episodes (77%), a significantly higher sensitivity (p = 0.0001). In 16 cases (23%), ascitic culture was negative by both methods. The mortality rate was higher among patients with culture-positive SBP than those with culture-negative SBP (46% vs 37%), but did not reach statistical significance. We conclude that ascitic fluid inoculated into a TSB blood culture bottle at the patient's bedside should be used routinely for ascites culture in cirrhotic patients.\r"

The splenic venous blood flow, measured with a pulsed Doppler flowmeter, had not changed significantly 1 month postoperatively (676 +/- 501 to 540 +/- 306 ml/min). The WBC and platelet counts significantly (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01, respectively) increased 1 month postoperatively, whereas there was a small, but significant (p less than 0.05), decrease in RBC count. We concluded that splenic blood flow increases immediately after DSRS with splenopancreatic disconnection, but this increase may be only short term.

The patient we are reporting had peritoneal mesothelioma which presented with dysphagia and weight loss, in addition to the radiological and manometric picture of achalasia. Secondary achalasia was suspected clinically, and was confirmed by computed tomography and laparotomy. The diagnosis of peritoneal mesothelioma was made only by histopathological examination. We are not aware of any other report documenting the association of peritoneal mesothelioma and achalasia.\r"

A follow-up radionuclide gastric-emptying study after physiologic steroid replacement showed complete normalization of gastric emptying. Although gastric stasis has long been suspected of being present with primary adrenal insufficiency, this represents the first case in which it has been documented, and so should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with chronic nausea and vomiting.\r"

Plasma GABA and serum ammonia levels were measured before and after ileostomy. Although the clinical syndrome and the EEG improved markedly after the ileostomy, the plasma GABA levels remained markedly elevated. Preoperative and postoperative GABA levels were 865 and 633 pmol/ml, respectively (nl = 100-180 pmol/ml). Our findings confirm previous reports of the efficacy of colonic exclusion in patients with intractable portasystemic encephalopathy. However, our results conflict with the hypothesis that GABA itself is the key mediator of the syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To identify a low-risk subset of patients with community-acquired pneumonia that could safely be treated in the ambulatory setting; and to assess how clinicians make the hospitalization decision. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective, observational study of 280 ambulatory and hospitalized adults with clinical and radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Patients were followed to assess all potential morbid complications and 6-week mortality. Physicians responsible for managing these patients were surveyed to assess the reasons for treating in a hospital or ambulatory setting and the therapies that dictate hospitalization. RESULTS: Sixty-one percent (170 of 280) of patients did not have an indication for admission at presentation using modified Appropriateness Evaluation Protocol criteria (a severe vital sign abnormality, alteration in mental status, suppurative complication, arterial hypoxemia, severe laboratory abnormality, or an acute coexistent medical problem requiring admission independent of the pneumonia). Among these 170 patients, 38% had a complicated course defined as death within 6 weeks, development of a new suppurative or medical complication due to pneumonia, intensive care unit admission, persistent fever or use of intravenous fluids or oxygen beyond 3 days, hospitalization lasting more than 3 days, or subsequent hospitalization in patients initially treated in the ambulatory setting. Five predisposing factors for a complicated course were identified in logistic regression models. The odds ratio for age more than 65 years was 2.7; for comorbid illness, 3.2; for temperature more than 38.3 degrees C (101 degrees F), 4.1; for immunosuppression, 12.0; and for a high-risk etiology, 23.3. The risk of a complicated course increased linearly with the number of risk factors, from 12% with none to 100% with four or more factors (p less than 0.001). Physicians most often relied on the general clinical appearance of the patient when making the triage decision, and most commonly cited intravenous antibiotics and chest physical therapy as treatments requiring hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: If validated, our findings could improve physicians' assessment of prognosis, and may identify a low-risk subset of patients with community-acquired pneumonia who could safely be managed in the ambulatory setting.\r"

Because the fluoroquinolone ofloxacin is effective for Chlamydia trachomatis infections, we investigated its role in treating C. pneumoniae infections. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-seven patients were enrolled in a randomized trial of antibiotic therapy for acute lower respiratory tract infections. The patients were randomly assigned to oral treatment with either ofloxacin (400 mg twice a day) or erythromycin (400 mg four times a day) for 10 days. Frozen acute and convalescent serologic specimens were tested for TWAR antibody by microimmunofluorescence. Susceptibility testing of C. pneumoniae to ofloxacin was also performed. RESULTS: Four patients who received ofloxacin were retrospectively identified as having C. pneumoniae pneumonia (two) or bronchitis (two). Within 2 weeks of starting ofloxacin therapy, all were cured or markedly improved. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of ofloxacin for three previously isolated clinical strains of C. pneumoniae were determined to be 1.0 to 2.0 micrograms/mL, well within the achievable serum levels (3 to 5 micrograms/mL) with ofloxacin therapy. CONCLUSION: Ofloxacin may be an effective alternative antibiotic treatment for C. pneumoniae respiratory infections.\r"

Therefore, we determined the quantities of these agents prescribed to outpatients in our Veterans Administration teaching hospital, and the relationship of patient age to total number of doses prescribed per prescription. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pharmacy and patient records related to 655 consecutive prescriptions for triazolam (Halcion) and flurazepam (Dalmane) were reviewed. Only 266 (41%) of the prescriptions were for 30 or fewer doses, while 178 (27%) were written for 180 or more doses. RESULTS: Thirty-six percent of prescriptions for patients aged 65 years or older were for 180 or more doses, compared with 24% for those aged 45 to 64 years old, and 16% of the prescriptions for patients less than 45 years old (p less than 0.0001). In a multivariate analysis controlling for six other factors related to the total number of doses prescribed, patients aged 65 years or older were still more likely to receive a prescription for 180 or more doses (relative risk 1.9, 95% confidence interval 1.3, 2.8). CONCLUSION: We conclude that inappropriately large quantities of benzodiazepine hypnotics were commonly prescribed, and that patients aged 65 years or older were at greatest risk for receiving such prescriptions.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To describe the incidence, presentation, clinical course, and management of avascular necrosis of bone following bone marrow transplantation, and to identify risk factors related to its development and outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients developing avascular necrosis after transplantation between March 1974 and May 1988 were identified by means of the Minnesota Bone Marrow Transplant Database and hospital records and included in analysis. Of 902 consecutive patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation, 28 developed avascular necrosis of bone. RESULTS: Twenty-eight of 642 allogeneic transplant recipients (10.4% by product limit estimate) developed avascular necrosis compared to zero of 260 autologous transplant recipients. Symptoms developed 1 to 62 months (median 12 months) after transplantation. In the 28 patients a total of 91 joints were affected (mean 3.3 per patient, range one to eight joints). The hip joint was most often involved (64% of patients), followed by knee (61%), ankle (29%), shoulder (21%), and elbow (7%). Initial standard radiographs were negative in 13 patients, while in nine patients, technetium-99 scans and/or magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated changes of osteonecrosis before changes on routine radiographs. Almost all patients had received steroid prophylaxis and therapy for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). We observed a significant correlation between the total cumulative dose of steroids and number of joints involved (p less than 0.01). A multivariate analysis (allogeneic transplant patients only) identified acute or chronic GVHD requiring steroid therapy (p = 0.003), and increasing age (p = 0.002) as significant and independent risk factors. Fourteen patients required surgery, including joint replacement in 11 patients. In six of six patients, hip core decompression failed to halt disease progression, and total hip arthroplasty was subsequently required. CONCLUSION: Avascular necrosis of bone is a frequent late complication of bone marrow transplantation, causing significant morbidity and often requiring surgery; diagnosis using conventional imaging techniques may be difficult and treatment remains inadequate.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the response and tolerance to long-term treatment using 13-cis-retinoic acid (13-CRA) in transfusion-dependent patients with the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and to determine the effects of therapy on the natural history of the disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-six consecutive patients with transfusion-dependent MDS seen in a medical school hospital and outpatient clinic from 1981 to 1988 were studied. The first 21 patients were treated with 13-CRA alone and the next 45 patients with 13-CRA plus alpha-tocopherol (AT). We compared responses to and toxicities of therapy, rates of transformation, and survival from onset of therapy in 20 evaluable patients treated with 13-CRA alone and 43 patients treated with 13-CRA plus AT. RESULTS: Four patients responded (20%) at 4 to 8 months to 13-CRA alone, but this response was associated with considerable toxicity and resulted in cessation of therapy. Among the responders, only one continued therapy and is currently in remission, whereas three discontinued therapy because of toxicity and have had a relapse and died. In the 13-CRA plus AT group, we observed one prolonged complete remission and 10 partial remissions (26%), with a decrease in skin and constitutional toxicities by the addition of AT, which enabled the continuation of 13-CRA indefinitely. Although the response rates were similar in both groups, fewer patients (28% versus 60%) experienced progression to acute leukemia in the 13-CRA plus AT group than in the group receiving 13-CRA alone, who terminated treatment (p = 0.018). A twofold increase in median survival of the RA/RARS and RAEB/CMML patient groups was observed with 13-CRA plus AT but was not significant (p greater than 0.5). CONCLUSION: This study shows a 20% to 26% response rate to 13-CRA and suggests that 13-CRA, if given continuously, decreases the rate of progression or transformation to acute leukemia in patients with MDS. The addition of AT ameliorates the toxicity of 13-CRA and allows for long-term treatment with 13-CRA. Since the standard treatment for MDS is currently unsatisfactory, these findings indicate that longer treatment with a non-marrow-suppressive agent such as 13-CRA is important, and further trials to determine the role of 13-CRA plus AT in combination with new recombinant growth factors in the therapy for transfusion-dependent MDS should offer a new approach to a disease common in the elderly population.\r"

We then used these two clinical scales to compare density and nodularity to histopathology of breast tissue at the margins of segmental resections in 60 women undergoing breast-conserving treatment of primary breast cancer. In cases such as these, a large sample of \"normal\" tissue is intentionally removed when the wide excision is done to obtain negative margins. Histopathology at the margins was graded according to the consensus panel of the American College of Pathology; as might be expected in women with previous cancer, some higher-risk histopathology was found in 37% of cases. A relationship was sought using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Neither clinical breast density (rho = 0.16) nor clinical breast nodularity (rho = 0.01) related to the presence of high-risk histopathology in the underlying tissue. Interestingly, breast nodularity increased with age (rho = 0.28), and clinical density and nodularity were inversely related (rho = -0.28). CONCLUSION: We conclude that neither clinical breast density nor nodularity correlates with histopathology and that it is unlikely that a larger study would find a clinically useful correlation. Therefore, a clinical examination should not be used to decide that high-risk histopathology is likely to be present in an individual woman's breast.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Patients with chest pain but without angiographic evidence of significant atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD) are often found to have other medical or psychiatric disorders, including mitral valve prolapse, panic disorder (PD), and major depressive disorder (MDD). The purpose of this study was to determine the degree of comorbidity between MDD/PD and mitral valve prolapse in a group of patients with non-CAD chest pain. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients referred for cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography for suspected CAD who were 70 years of age or younger and without other significant medical illnesses or cardiac complications were eligible for study. The first 100 patients who agreed to a psychiatric diagnostic interview were recruited. RESULTS: Forty-eight of the 100 patients were found to be without significant CAD. Forty-two percent of these patients, compared to 19% of the patients with significant CAD, were found to have either MDD, PD, or both. Eighty percent of the patients without CAD who had mitral valve prolapse also had either MDD or PD (p less than 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: The finding that mitral valve prolapse was significantly associated with MDD/PD has implications for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with non-CAD chest pain, and may explain why these patients complain of symptoms.\r"

  ".U": "91068752\r", 
  ".W": "PURPOSE: Coronary heart disease has been described to be increased with both glucose intolerance and cigarette smoking. All three of these have also been reported to be associated with central adiposity (disproportionate deposition of fat on the trunk compared to the extremities). The purpose of this analysis was to determine the relationship of cigarette smoking to glucose intolerance and coronary heart disease, the relationship of cigarette smoking to risk factors such as adiposity, body fat distribution, and plasma lipoprotein and insulin levels, the relationship of cigarette smoking to these risk factors independent of disease status, and whether these risk factors could account for any of the relationship between cigarette smoking and disease status. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study design was cross-sectional. The study sample contained 219 middle-aged and elderly Japanese-American men: 77 with normal and 74 with impaired glucose tolerance and 68 with type II diabetes. There were 54 men with coronary heart disease. A detailed smoking history was obtained. Glucose tolerance status was established by medical history and a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. Coronary heart disease was determined by medical history and a resting electrocardiogram. Adiposity and fat distribution measurements were body mass index (kg/m2), skinfold thicknesses, body circumferences, and cross-sectional fat areas by computed tomography. Levels of insulin, C-peptide, cholesterol (total, low-density lipoprotein [LDL], high-density lipoprotein [HDL], HDL2, HDL3, very-low-density lipoprotein [VLDL]), and triglyceride (total, VLDL) were measured in fasting blood specimens. RESULTS: A central pattern of body fat was associated with both non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease. Smoking history was related to both adiposity and body fat distribution, and was strongly related to coronary heart disease but not to diabetes. Past smokers who had smoked up to a month ago were the heaviest while present smokers who were currently smoking or had smoked within the past month were the leanest. However, although present smokers had reduced amounts of fat, this was attributable to those present smokers without heart disease. Present smokers with heart disease were not as lean and had increased amounts of intra-abdominal fat. Past smokers had the greatest amount of central fat and this was attributable to those with heart disease. By two-way (smoking history and coronary heart disease status) analysis of covariance, smoking history was significantly related only to subcutaneous fat disposition on the chest and abdomen independent of coronary heart disease, while coronary heart disease status was strongly related to plasma levels of insulin C-peptide, VLDL, HDL, HDL2, and HDL3 cholesterol, and total and VLDL triglyceride, independent of smoking history. Further analysis showed that none of the body fat variables could account for the risk of coronary heart disease associated with smoking history. Higher fasting plasma C-peptide levels in past smokers accounted statistically for part of the risk of coronary heart disease associated with cigarette smoking. However, this effect was not mediated by any of the body fat measurements. CONCLUSIONS: Disproportionately increased intra-abdominal fat is related to coronary heart disease but not to smoking history. Smoking history is related to coronary heart disease but not to diabetes. Weight gain is associated with smoking cessation and appears to be concentrated in the central subcutaneous regions, especially for those who have coronary heart disease. Weight gain associated with cessation of smoking appears to be unrelated to atherogenic changes in lipids, lipoproteins, or insulin. Other pathogenic processes must be considered in the association between smoking and coronary heart disease.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to examine the effect of low-dose aspirin (325 mg on alternate days) on the primary prevention of angina pectoris in the United States Physicians' Health Study. Despite a postulated role of platelets in atherogenesis and myocardial ischemia, the effect of chronic platelet inhibition on the development of clinical angina pectoris is unknown. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The Physicians' Health Study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial among 22,071 male physicians aged 40 to 84 years, free from previous myocardial infarction, stroke, and transient cerebral ischemia at entry, and followed for an average of 60.2 months. The 21,738 physicians who were also free from angina pectoris at baseline constituted the study population for the present analyses. RESULTS: During 106,652 person-years of follow-up, 331 patients with confirmed angina pectoris were diagnosed, 194 of whom underwent a coronary revascularization procedure (coronary artery bypass graft surgery or coronary angioplasty). As compared to participants assigned placebo, the relative risk of confirmed angina pectoris in the aspirin group was 1.10 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88 to 1.38). For coronary revascularization, the relative risk was 1.19 (95% CI, 0.88 to 1.59). After simultaneous control for other coronary risk factors in a proportional-hazards model, these relative risks remained near unity at 1.07 (95% CI, 0.84 to 1.36) and 1.11 (95% CI, 0.81 to 1.52), respectively. When the risks of angina pectoris were examined according to year of randomization in the trial, there was no pattern of increasing benefit with longer duration of treatment. CONCLUSION: These randomized trial data indicate that chronic platelet inhibition with low-dose aspirin for an average duration of 60.2 months does not reduce the incidence of angina pectoris.\r"

Systematic or occasional use of condoms during the previous 12 months was reported by 46.9 percent of respondents. Among condom users, 38.7 percent declared they had never used condoms before the last 12 months, fear of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) rather than contraception being the main motivation of these recent users. Multivariate analysis indicates that voluntary testing for HIV, average or more than average fear of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and knowledge of HIV carrier in personal relations are associated with condom use.\r"

  ".W": "Health systems in developing countries are facing major challenges in the 1990s and beyond because of a growing epidemiological diversity as a consequence of rapid economic development and declining fertility. The infectious and parasitic diseases of childhood must remain a priority at the same time the chronic diseases among adults are emerging as a serious problem. Health policymakers must engage in undertaking an epidemiological and economic analysis of the major disease problems, evaluating the cost-effectiveness of alternative intervention strategies; designing health care delivery systems; and, choosing what governments can do through persuasion, taxation, regulation, and provision of services. The World Bank has commissioned studies of over two dozen diseases in developing countries which have confirmed the priority of child survival interventions and revealed that interventions for many neglected and emerging adult health problems have comparable cost-effectiveness. Most developing countries lack information about most major diseases among adults, reflecting lack of national capacities in epidemiological and economic analyses, health technology assessment, and environmental monitoring and control. There is a critical need for national and international investment in capacity building and essential national health research to build the base for health policies.\r"

  ".W": "This article quantifies the magnitude and correlates of the major imbalances affecting the employment of physicians in the urban areas of Mexico. Since the early 1970s the country has experienced a rapid increase in the supply of doctors, which its health system was unable to absorb fully. In 1986, we conducted a survey in the 16 most important cities based on a probability sample of households where someone with an MD degree lived. A total of 604 physicians were interviewed for a response rate of 97 percent. The unemployment rate was 7 percent of potentially active physicians; 11 percent held a nonmedical job, and another 11 percent exhibited low productivity and/or income. All in all, we project that 23,500 physicians in these cities were either unemployed or underemployed. This medical employment pattern was analyzed against five independent variables: generation (i.e. the year in which the physician started medical school), gender, social origin, medical school quality, and specialty. Apart from generation, type of specialty exhibited the strongest correlation with the employment situation of a physician. The results suggest that higher education and health care in Mexico may be producing rather than correcting social inequalities. Policy alternatives are discussed to restore a balance between the training of physicians, their gainful employment, and the health needs of the population.\r"

  ".W": "A comprehensive review of available sources of mortality data was undertaken to document the changes that have occurred in infant mortality in Nicaragua over the last three decades. It was found that a rapid fall in infant mortality commenced in the early 1970s and has continued steadily since. Trends in several different factors which might have led to this breakthrough were examined including: income, nutrition, breastfeeding practices, maternal education, immunizations, access to health services, provision of water supplies and sanitation, and anti-malarial programs. Of these, improved access to health services appears to have been the most important factor. At a time when the number of hospital beds per capita was dropping, increasing numbers of health care professionals, particularly nurses, were becoming available to staff primary health care facilities built in the 1960s. These were provided at least partly in response to the growing political turmoil enveloping the nation at that time. Certain Nicaraguan cultural attributes may have added to the impact of the reforms. Efforts in the field of public health made since the 1979 insurrection appear to have maintained the decline in child mortality.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of Italian physicians' attitudes, beliefs, and personal characteristics on medical decision making is examined in the case of surgical treatment of early breast cancer. Responses to a mail survey of 657 physicians from different specialties were analyzed comparing doctors recommending a radical procedure (9%) to those preferring a conservative procedure for younger patients only (25%), and those considering conservative surgery the treatment of choice regardless of patients' age (66%). The findings suggest that the likelihood of physicians' preferring a conservative procedure is influenced by their specialty and the extent to which they feel that a patient should have a role in the treatment decision more than by differences in the beliefs of treatment outcomes. Only preferences of the small group indicating radical surgery as the sole admissible treatment can be accounted for by ignorance or distrust of results of recent trials. These findings suggest that other than scientific factors guide many doctors in their decision making; they may help to explain why the diffusion of research results into clinical practice is often disappointingly slow.\r"

  ".W": "Feeding patterns by mothers and child acceptance of food were measured in a Peruvian village to determine changes on days when children had diarrhea as compared to days of convalescence and health. Morbidity surveillance identified 40 children, aged 4-36 months, with diarrhea. Children were followed using twelve-hour in-home structured observations during two to four days each of diarrhea, convalescence, and health. Using scales of maternal encouragement to eat and child acceptance of food and cumulative logistic regression analyses, maternal encouragement to eat decreased significantly during convalescence compared to diarrheal days (OR: 0.54, 90% CI: 0.35, 0.82) and health compared to diarrhea (OR: 0.65, 90% CI: 0.46, 0.93). In contrast, child acceptance of food increased during health compared to diarrhea (OR: 1.55, 90% CI: 1.02, 2.35). Results illustrate the importance of carefully examining the behavioral aspects of nutritional intake. Decreases in intake during diarrhea are due to anorexia and not withdrawal of food by mothers. In response to reductions in child appetite during illness, mothers are more likely to encourage children to eat, while they tend to become more passive feeders after the diarrhea has stopped. Program efforts should focus on messages to feed children more actively especially after diarrhea episodes, when appetite levels increase.\r"

Regular smoking and use of alcohol in the 30 days prior to the survey were reported by 22.3 percent and 82.8 percent, respectively. Nearly one-third of the students (30.3 percent) reported lifetime use of psychotropic drugs without prescription, without ever having used any illicit drug. Illicit drug use is less common in Greece than in other European and North American countries with a lifetime prevalence rate of 6 percent. Regular use of tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs was more common in males, while unprescribed use of licit psychotropic drugs prevailed in females. Regular smoking, drinking, and illicit drug use were associated with urbanization but not socioeconomic status. Between 1984 and 1988 in an Athenian subsample of schools there was a 20 percent increase in illicit drug use among males. Use of psychotropic drugs without prescription decreased much more than use of tobacco and alcohol.\r"

It is concluded that changes in drug use behavior so far appear to have resulted in a stabilization of the epidemic among injectors, at a level with a still disturbingly high incidence rate of 5-6 per 100 person-years.\r"

This is particularly striking considering that the average birthweight for smokers is lower than for non-smokers. A birthweight difference of more than 500 grams was found between babies of mothers who neither smoked nor drank and mothers who smoked and drank heavily. Our data suggest that women's smoking habits should be taken into consideration when giving pregnant women advice about drinking.\r"

MedisGroups measures severity both on admission and approximately one week into the hospital stay. The data base was a random sample of 20,985 admissions of Medicare beneficiaries with one of six conditions from 833 hospitals in seven states between January 1985 and May 1986. In all six conditions, higher admission and mid-stay severity scores were generally associated with higher risk of death. Across the six conditions, the R-squared values for predicting death using admission scores ranged from 0.01 to 0.16; R-squared values using mid-stay scores ranged from 0.03 to 0.34; and R-squared values from combining admission and mid-stay scores ranged from 0.05 to 0.41. Admission MedisGroups score was thus only modestly predictive of 30-day mortality. While the mid-stay score was more powerful, it may not be an appropriate severity adjuster to screen for quality using hospital mortality rates because it could be influenced by substandard care.\r"

Estimates of the duration of time between onset of HIV-related symptoms and work loss derive from the life table method of Kaplan and Meier. A Cox proportional hazards model is used to estimate the effect of risk factors on the probability of withdrawing from work in each time interval. Eighty-six percent of the respondents worked prior to onset of the first symptom of HIV-related illness; 40 percent were working at the time of the most recent interview, a mean of 958 days later. The total number of hours worked declined by 59 percent during this time. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicates that 50 percent who worked prior to onset of HIV-related illness stopped working within two years and all had stopped within 10 years after onset of the first symptom.\r"

Retail prescriptions for oral contraceptives peaked at approximately 68 million in 1973 and have remained between 50 million and 60 million since 1981. Despite this relative consistency in the number of prescriptions, physician \"mentions\" of oral contraceptives have increased by approximately 75 percent. This increase may reflect closer monitoring of women on oral contraceptives. Use of multiphasic formulations has steadily risen, accounting for 37 percent of the oral contraceptive prescriptions in 1988. Mean estrogen and progestin doses in all types of formulations have steadily declined. A change in the type of estrogen and progestin used in preparations has coincided with this decline in dose. The association between age and use of high-dose formulations seen in the past was no longer evident in 1988. The data demonstrate that oral contraceptive formulations in wide use today differ in hormone content from those of the past, when most of the major studies addressing the risks associated with oral contraceptive use were completed. There is therefore a need to determine the risks and long-term effects associated with these newer formulations.\r"

Arthroscopic observations of the joint capsule through the normal range of motion revealed that the inferior glenohumeral ligament is actually a complex of structures consisting of an anterior band, a posterior band, and an interposed axillary pouch. While these components of the inferior glenohumeral ligament complex were present in all 11 specimens, they were best demonstrated in some shoulders by placing the humeral head in internal or external rotation in varying degrees of abduction. Histologic examination of the joint capsule revealed that the anterior and posterior bands of the inferior glenohumeral ligament complex were readily identifiable as distinct structures comprised of thickened bands of well-organized collagen bundles. Although slight variations were noted in the attachment sites of the anterior and posterior bands to the glenoid, the inferior glenohumeral ligament complex was observed to attach to the humeral neck in one of two distinct configurations. A collar-like attachment, in which the entire inferior glenohumeral ligament complex attaches just inferior to the articular edge of the humeral head, was observed in six specimens. In the remaining five specimens, the attachment was in the shape of a \"V,\" with the anterior and posterior bands attaching adjacent to the articular edge of the humeral head and the axillary pouch attaching at the apex of the \"V\" distal to the articular edge. The orientation and design of the inferior glenohumeral ligament complex supports the functional concept of this single structure as an important anterior and posterior stabilizer of the shoulder joint.\r"

Isokinetic evaluations demonstrated that the extension torque of the involved knee recovered to a slightly lower level than that of the controls, although the flexion torque recovered to a level equivalent to that of the controls. Arthroscopic evaluations revealed that the allografts were elaborately remodeled, viable, and taut. There was no sign of immunologic rejection at any time postoperatively.

The results obtained with conservative treatment were good in 40% of cases, average in 20%, and poor in 40%. In our opinion, these results justify the treatment of this condition with physical therapy before proceeding with surgical correction. The objective of physical therapy was to decrease the compressive forces in the anterior compartment of the knee by increasing the structural flexibility of the flexor and extensor muscles. This increase in flexibility was obtained by instituting stretching exercises for the hamstrings, gastrocnemius, and quadriceps.\r"

  ".U": "91068826\r", 
  ".W": "Eighteen patients with 20 symptomatic hips underwent lengthening of the iliopsoas tendon for persistent painful snapping of this \"internal\" variety of snapping hip. We referred to the pathologic, painful snapping of the iliopsoas in the deep anterior groin as the \"internal\" snapping hip. This is in contrast to the more common and better-known \"external\" snapping that involves the greater trochanter and its overlying soft tissues. The results of our iliopsoas lengthening procedure are presented here. Lengthening of the iliopsoas tendon was accomplished by step cutting of the tendinous portion of the iliopsoas. The pathoanatomy of this poorly understood symptom complex was described in 1984 paper from this institution and is reviewed here. Iliopsoas bursography demonstrated a sudden jerking movement of the iliopsoas tendon between the anterior inferior iliac spine and iliopectineal eminence, synchronous with the patient's pain and often accompanied by an audible snap. The average preoperative duration of symptoms was 2.9 years, and the average length of postoperative followup was 25 months. All patients, except one, had a marked reduction in the frequency of snapping after tendon lengthening, and 14 of 20 hips had no snapping postoperatively. Of the six patients who had recurrence of snapping, all but one stated that this occurred much less frequently and was much less painful compared to the preoperative state. Two hips required reoperation. Postoperatively, only three patients complained of subjective weakness, and most patients were unlimited in physical activity with return to activities such as competitive football, pole vaulting, and long-distance running.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These cases do not include patients with initial ACL injuries combined with other intraarticular damage. Diagnosis was by physical and arthroscopic examination. Examination took place an average 13.6 months after injury. Of the 98 isolated ACL injuries, 56 were complete ruptures and 42 were partial ruptures. In most cases of partial rupture, the clinical diagnosis was wrong. \"Meniscal damage\" was the usual diagnosis in these cases; the true diagnosis was made only by arthroscopic examination. Thirty-four of the 98 patients with isolated ACL injuries (30 men and 4 women) developed further intraarticular damage. Of these 34, 20 had complete ACL rupture and 14 had partial ACL rupture. Treatment after primary injury included physiotherapy in all patients and bracing in those whose knee was unstable during daily activities. Reconstructive surgical procedures were not performed in those patients. The time lapse from the primary to the secondary injury varied from 1 month to 20 years, with an average of 28 months. The secondary damage was caused by a secondary injury that was mild (22 cases) or developed insidiously (12 cases). Five types of secondary damage were observed: partial ACL tears that became complete--11 cases; meniscal tear--8 cases; loosening and subluxation of the anterior horn of the medial meniscus--14 cases; and fracture or damage to the articular condylar cartilage, with or without bone involvement--11 cases. It should be emphasized that the secondary damages were at times combined.\r"

Seventy-two percent of the patients in the review had glenoid labral tears. Ninety-two percent of patients who had a diagnosis of either recurrent anterior dislocation or recurrent anterior subluxation demonstrated a tear of the anterior inferior margin of the glenoid labrum. Sixty-eight percent of patients with a diagnosis of impingement demonstrated tears at the superior margin of the labrum. There was a significant difference between throwing and nonthrowing athletes. Partial rotator cuff tears were noted in 18 patients, the majority occurring in throwing athletes. Other abnormalities, such as degenerative joint changes and biceps tendon lesions, were also noted at the time of arthroscopy. A large number of glenoid labral tears found at the time of arthroscopy appeared to be associated with conditions other than instability, which may or may not affect the throwing athlete. There also appeared to be a high correlation between tears in the anterior inferior glenoid labrum and anterior instability. Arthroscopy enabled us to identify other significant information about the status of the biceps tendon or the undersurface of the rotator cuff. These are areas in which problems might otherwise have been missed. Degenerative changes of the articular surface, not apparent on plain radiographs, may also be better evaluated arthroscopically.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the effectiveness of our treatment regimen, we retrospectively studied the surgically treated knees of 155 athletes, aged 15 to 42 years, who had sustained acute ACL tears. All were treated with ligament excision and intraarticular bone-patellar tendon-bone reconstruction followed by early motion with emphasis on full extension. The follow-up period ranged from 2 to 7 years. Of the 155 patients, 140 were available for final followup at a minimum of 2 years after reconstruction. The patients were evaluated by objective measures (KT-1000, Cybex, Lachman test, range of motion, and postoperative competition level) and subjective assessment scores (pain, swelling, stability, activity level, walking, stair climbing, running, jumping, or twisting). The subjective scores were tabulated for stability level, total score, and activity level. After the patients achieved full range of motion, the KT-1000 measurements at a 20 pound force revealed an average difference of 1.3 mm between the injured and noninjured knees. All but 3 of the 140 patients had a firm endpoint on the Lachman test, and the Cybex tests showed a mean hamstring strength of 98% and mean quadriceps strength of 90%. Sixty of the 69 varsity athletes who were eligible to play returned to preinjury competition level the following season. One had reconstruction failure and eight chose not to continue competition for academic reasons. The questionnaire score average was 92.7 (maximum, 100 points, normal athletic knee score 93.5). We concluded that the surgical procedure, with emphasis on early full extension postoperatively, achieved excellent results and provided a stable knee.\r"

Twelve of these patients were followed more than 5 years. We report 93% good and excellent results subjectively and 89% good and excellent results objectively. The quality of improvement was sustained in all 12 of the patients who were evaluated again after more than 5 years from surgery. When examined separately, 75% of those patients with advanced patellar arthrosis achieved a good result; none of these patients achieved an excellent result. Postoperative continuous passive motion has markedly reduced the incidence of stiffness. Serious complications such as compartment syndrome, infection, and skin slough were avoided completely in 51 consecutive cases. Patellofemoral contact pressure studies in five cadaver knees have shown that anteromedial tibial tubercle transfer can provide substantial reduction of patellofemoral contact stress while helping to balance medial and lateral facet pressures. This surgical procedure is mechanically and clinically successful for alleviating intractable pain related to patellar malalignment and articular degeneration. This procedure enables the majority of appropriately selected patients with malalignment and patellar articular degeneration to resume increased levels of activity with substantially diminished pain.\r"

The effect of each support method on the subjects' vertical jumping ability was also assessed. Fourteen ankles were treated with both methods of support. Passive inversion-eversion range of motion was measured on an ankle stability test instrument during five testing sessions: 1) before support, 2) before exercise, 3) 20 minutes during exercise, 4) 60 minutes during exercise, and 5) after exercise. The two-way analysis of variance and posthoc comparisons revealed maximal losses in taping restriction for both inversion and eversion at 20 minutes into exercise. The orthosis demonstrated no mechanical restrictive failure until before and after exercise comparisons were made, and then only eversion range of motion was compromised. Neither support system affected subjects' vertical jumping ability. These results suggest that the semirigid orthosis may be more effective than taping in providing initial ankle protection and in guarding against ligamentous reinjury.\r"

This is the first time that the incidence of spinal stenosis, as determined by Torg's ratio, has been demonstrated in a population of professional and rookie football players. Because one-third of this population has cervical spinal stenosis as determined by the Torg ratio, other factors should be considered in the evaluation of a player with a transient quadriplegic episode when making continued play decisions.\r"

We are reporting on 13 athletes who were found to have symptoms related to compression of the subclavian or axillary artery or their tributaries. Nine were amateur or professional baseball pitchers. Severe arm fatigue or finger ischemia, secondary to embolization, were presenting symptoms. Arm fatigue was noted in all pitchers. After complete history and physical examination, including auscultation for bruits in functional positions, all athletes were evaluated by noninvasive tests (Doppler and Duplex scanning). Arteriography was performed with positional testing, recreating overhead activity, and complete radiographic visualization of the dye to the digital arteries. Two patients were found to have subclavian artery aneurysm. The remaining athletes were found to have compression of the subclavian artery beneath the anterior scalene muscle (five patients), the axillary artery beneath the pectoralis minor (two patients), both arterial segments (two patients), and one was found to have arterial compromise at the level of the humeral head. Branch artery compression was also noted. One pitcher occluded the posterior circumflex humeral artery with embolization to the digit. The two patients with subclavian aneurysms underwent saphenous vein bypass with cervical rib resection. All of the other athletes except one underwent resection of a 2 to 3 cm segment of the anterior scalene muscle or pectoralis minor muscles. All returned to their previous level of activity except one patient who developed impingement type symptoms and required acromioplasty. He is currently undergoing rehabilitation. Proper recognition of vascular compromise in the upper extremity of athletes is essential to avoid the catastropic complications of arterial thrombosis.\r"

Two patients had acute symptoms with sudden posttraumatic hand ischemia with finger and palmar pain. Diagnosis was established by history and physical examination and confirmed by noninvasive testing. Testing included use of Doppler examination and cold tolerance examination with thermistors. Two athletes required angiographic evaluation because of severe ischemia and continuous pain. All patients in this group were managed nonoperatively. Those with chronic complaints were counseled regarding cold avoidance and instructed to increase their glove padding. The two patients with acute symptoms required vasodilator (papaverine chloride) infusion, followed by intravenous heparin and dextran. All baseball catchers returned to their sport with dissipation of symptoms.\r"

Most injuries (N = 15) occurred during running. The diagnosis was confirmed within 3 to 104 weeks (mean, 14 weeks) after the initial onset of symptoms. Sixteen of the patients were treated with internal fixation, the remaining seven were treated conservatively. Seven patients (30%) developed complications requiring major surgery. Five of these patients had Type 3 fractures (displaced) and four had been treated with internal fixation initially. The remaining two patients had Type 1 fractures (endosteal or periosteal callus without an overt fracture line); one was treated operatively and the other conservatively. Three patients developed avascular necrosis and two were treated by hip replacement. The third patient was treated with arthrodesis. Three refractures and one pseudarthrosis were treated by osteotomy. At followup, all elite athletes stated that they had to end their career as a result of the injury. Results were rated by the ability of the athlete to return to sports. There were 9 bad or fair results, 13 good, and 1 excellent result. No difference in activity level or subjective rating was observed between the surgically and conservatively treated group either preinjury or postinjury. The most important factor influencing the complication rate seems to be the type of fracture. The high incidence of displaced fractures (Type 3) could speculatively be caused by undiagnosed tension side stress fractures. If so, the delay in correct diagnosis may be disastrous. However, we could only objectively observe this in one of our cases.\r"

The understanding of the etiology of thromboembolism and the role of platelets, endothelium, and the plasma proteins in the development of thrombotic disorders has recently improved. Other blood cells, in particular neutrophils, have been suggested as possible mediators of thrombosis in clinical disorders characterized by decreased capillary blood flow. Newer imaging techniques such as duplex scanning have improved the accuracy and ease of diagnosis. Thrombolytic therapy is a more physiologic approach to the management of thrombosis, but its role is limited by systemic fibrinolysis. The development of fibrin-specific agents and better delivery techniques in combination with thromboembolectomy and anticoagulation should improve the management of patients with thrombosis.\r"

In 40% of cases, intraoperative pre-bypass contrast arteriography was necessary to identify a graftable tibial or pedal artery. The results of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and autogenous bypasses were compared after 1 to 3 years. After 1 year, patency was 85% and 67% for autogenous and PTFE bypasses, respectively. Limb salvage was 90% for autogenous bypass and 70% for PTFE bypass. Cumulative patency rates at 3 years were 80% for autogenous and 57% for PTFE grafts. Graft surveillance with duplex scanning and AAI was valuable in detecting failing grafts. For both types of reconstruction, secondary procedures were required to maintain patency. We attribute the excellent results with PTFE in part to long-term aspirin and warfarin therapy. In cases of combined superficial femoral and severe infra-popliteal occlusive disease, PTFE bypass is an excellent alternative when no autogenous conduit is available.\r"

Dimensions of in vitro ultrasound images from human arteries (eight normal and nine arteriosclerotic) were compared with those from histologic sections of the vessels. In addition, in vivo ultrasound studies (23 normal and 22 arteriosclerotic) of canine femoral arteries were compared with luminal dimensions obtained from angiograms of the vessels. The correlation of in vitro ultrasound images to luminal diameters (n = 22, r = 0.96), adventitial diameters (n = 19, r = 0.83), and wall thickness (n = 19, r = 0.68) in normal human vessels was significant (p less than 0.05). In vitro measurements of images and histologic specimens from human atherosclerotic arteries also correlated significantly (p less than 0.05) with luminal diameters (n = 27, r = 0.91), adventitial diameters (n = 24, r = 0.60), and wall thickness (n = 24, r = 0.62). Morphologically, in vitro images of the wall of normal human arteries had a concentric laminated appearance and atherosclerotic vessels had patchy echodense and echolucent areas. In vivo studies showed significant correlation of diameters for both normal (n = 16, r = 0.91, p less than 0.05) and arteriosclerotic (n = 16, r = 0.57, p less than 0.05) canine arteries compared with luminal dimensions measured from uniplanar angiograms. We conclude that rotating A-scan intraluminal ultrasound accurately defines both normal and atherosclerotic arterial wall morphology and dimensions. This technology may be valuable for intravascular guidance of angioplasty devices by identifying the location and consistency of lesions.\r"

Of 311 catheters inserted, 151 (49%) required removal, of which 111 (74%) were attributed to peritonitis. Cumulative patient survival was 80%, 60%, and 53% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. Diabetic patients had statistically significant lower survival rates. Additional complications including catheter leakage, catheter malposition, catheter obstruction, and abdominal wall hernias were negligible. Although CAPD is not free from serious complications, our data show remarkable improvement since 1980 in catheter longevity, hospital stay, and infection rates.\r"

We speculated that the ethanol concentration in the gastric wall may exceed plasma levels by direct diffusion across the mucosa and through the muscle layers. A model of acute ethanol ingestion was created by partitioning the stomachs of three dogs with a surgical stapling device and instilling carbon 14 (14C)-labeled ethanol into the proximal segments. The flux of ethanol was traced by counting 14C in serial sections of the gastric wall. A mucosa-to-serosa gradient of 14C activity was established. The data indicate that direct diffusion from the mucosal surface will produce dramatically higher concentrations of ethanol in gastric muscle than would be anticipated from serum levels alone.\r"

  ".W": "Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical problem in pregnancy requiring emergent intervention. To establish a contemporary patient profile and formulate an effective management strategy, a retrospective review was conducted of 84 pregnant patients who underwent laparotomy with a preoperative diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Gestational stage at presentation included the first trimester in 27 patients (32%), the second trimester in 37 patients (44%), the third trimester in 13 patients (16%), and the puerperium in 7 patients (8%). Fifty-four patients (64%) had pathologically proven acute appendicitis; the incidence did not vary by trimester. Other intra-abdominal conditions were detected in 15 patients (18%). There were no significant differences between patients with positive and negative laparotomies (or among trimesters) regarding frequency of presenting symptoms and signs or laboratory results. Operation occurred within 24 hours of symptom onset in 19 of 54 (35%) instances of proven acute appendicitis. Perforation occurred in 23 of 54 patients (43%), all of whom had symptoms exceeding 24 hours (p less than 0.0005). Five instances of perinatal death and one case of extreme perinatal morbidity were associated with negative laparotomies; only one of these was attributed to operation itself. No adverse long-term maternal morbidity or mortality occurred. Wound infection developed in seven cases of acute appendicitis (six perforated) and two negative explorations. We conclude that (1) gestational physiologic changes obscure the accurate diagnosis of acute appendicitis; (2) the natural history of acute appendicitis is not affected by trimester of presentation; and (3) adverse sequelae of acute appendicitis are obviated by prompt operative exploration and prevention of appendiceal perforation.\r"

  ".W": "Myocardial contusion remains an elusive clinical entity, which consumes a disproportionate amount of scarce and expensive critical care resources for the purpose of cardiac monitoring. This study attempts to define a group of patients at high risk who can be identified from the available data present at the time of admission. All patients admitted with the suspicion of a myocardial contusion over a 3-year period were retrospectively studied. The records were examined for history, physical findings, electrocardiographic (ECG) results, creatine kinase levels, Injury Severity Score (ISS), and echocardiographic findings. A diagnosis of a myocardial contusion was made if patients had an ECG consistent with acute injury, increased creatine kinase-MB, or an abnormal echocardiogram consistent with acute injury. Patients were stratified into two groups: Group 1 patients satisfied the criteria for a myocardial contusion and Group 2 patients lacked sufficient evidence to substantiate this diagnosis. The records were then examined for the presence of factors available in the emergency room that might be predictive of a myocardial contusion or its complications. A total of 88 patients were evaluated; 27 of these were found to have a myocardial contusion (Group 1) with 61 patients placed in Group 2 (no myocardial contusion). Group 1 patients had an abnormal admission ECG (p less than 0.05), and an ISS greater than or equal to 10 (p less than 0.05). Multivariate analysis identified two factors predictive of a myocardial contusion: an abnormal ECG and an ISS greater than 10. When these two predictors were absent, the probability of a myocardial contusion was 1%. No predictors of a complication of a myocardial contusion were identified. These data suggest that a combination of easily obtained variables in the emergency department can be used to select a patient population at high risk for myocardial contusion. Prospective evaluation of these variables is necessary.\r"

In nine patients, a balloon catheter was passed into a bleeding site through a bullet track or proximal artery and inflated with saline or radiologic dye. In two of these patients, the proximal balloon catheter was folded on itself, tied in that position, and left in the patient permanently. In the other seven patients in this group, the balloon catheter was attached to a three-way stopcock and left temporarily inflated postoperatively. These patients were then observed in the intensive care unit for 3 to 4 days, at which time the balloon was withdrawn. Eight of nine patients survived without recurrent hemorrhage after removal of the balloon catheter, while one patient with a Fogarty balloon placed in the carotid siphon died of a cerebral infarction. Balloon catheter tamponade was also used on a temporary basis in one patient with a posterior cardiac wound and in one patient with an anterior stab wound of the inferior vena cava at the renal veins, whereas in two patients with high cervical arteriovenous fistulas, one had permanent placement of the balloon catheter while the other had temporary placement. One of the latter patients also had acute hemorrhage. Although all four patients survived, one of the patients with a fistula developed a recurrence and another required two separate operative procedures for correct placement of the balloon to cure the fistula.\r"

We collected data regarding patient age, gender, degree of hemodynamic stability, number of units of blood required, severity of splenic injury, Injury Severity Score, and results of treatment. There were 143 adults (age greater than 16 years) and 26 pediatric patients (age less than 17 years), with mean age in the 2 groups of 31.6 and 11.4 years, respectively. Males comprised 72% of the group, and blunt injury occurred in 154 of the 169 patients. In the adults, splenectomy, splenorrhaphy, laparotomy without operative treatment of the spleen, and nonoperative management were observed 48%, 30%, 14%, and 8% of the time and in the pediatric group 31%, 27%, 19%, and 23% of the time, respectively. By using operative splenic repair techniques and increased use of nonoperative management, the splenic salvage rate has increased in the last 6 years from 41% to 61% without an increase in morbidity and mortality. Incidence of spleen salvage correlated with severity of spleen and overall injury and cardiovascular stability.\r"

One hundred sixteen patients (48%) were randomized to an open lavage technique and 126 (52%) to a percutaneous (closed) guide wire procedure. The closed procedure required an average of 16 minutes to complete with one operator, whereas the open method required two operators and an average time of 26 minutes (p less than 0.001). Technical complications occurred in 31 patients undergoing closed lavage (25%) and 4 patients undergoing open lavage (3%) (p less than 0.01). Fifty-eight percent of the closed lavage complications were related to fluid return and 42% to guide wire placement. All the open lavage complications were caused by inadequate fluid return. These data do not support the initial use of percutaneous lavage. The open technique is favored and certainly used when the closed method fails or when direct visualization of the peritoneal cavity is indicated. Physicians involved in the management of abdominal trauma must be familiar with both methods of DPL.\r"

The role of duplex Doppler in the evaluation of intra-abdominal vascular disease remains unclear. This article summarizes the current status of duplex scanning in the investigation of the mesenteric arteries, the renal arteries, and the portal venous system. The examination is technically demanding, operator-dependent, time-consuming, and frequently unsatisfactory due to bowel gas, obesity, complex anatomy, or postoperative alterations in the normal anatomic patterns. Its advantages reside primarily in the absence of toxicity and in the generation of physiologic as well as anatomic information. In centers with the proper instrumentation and a skilled technician, duplex examination can be useful in the diagnosis and management of abdominal vascular disease and avoids the inherent dangers of contrast angiography.\r"

Thirty of 56 elderly patients (54%) required urgent surgery for acute cholangitis, acute cholecystitis, or obstructive jaundice (serum bilirubin greater than 5 mg/dL), compared with 97 of 257 younger patients (38%) (p = 0.029). Mortality in elderly patients was significantly higher (5 of 56) than in younger (6 of 257) patients (p = 0.015). In three of the five patients who died, urgent surgery was performed for obstructive jaundice, reflecting the higher mortality experienced by jaundiced patients in the entire series (9.4%). Biliary cultures grew organisms in 25 of 27 elderly patients (93%). This is in contrast to findings of bactibilia in 62 of 118 patients (53%) under the age of 80 (p = 0.001). Similarly, preoperative blood cultures were positive more often in elderly (63%) than in younger patients (26%) (p = 0.007). Mean postoperative hospital recovery was longer in the elderly group (16.2 +/- 8.5 days) than in the younger group (12.2 +/- 9.3 days) (p = 0.002). In conclusion, elderly patients, particularly those with obstructive jaundice, are at higher risk for complicated biliary tract disease necessitating choledochotomy. They appear to be more susceptible to bactibilia and bacteremia, and require longer hospital recovery than younger patients.\r"

All DWGs were submucosal and all were located in the first or second portions of the duodenum except one found in the fourth portion. Tumor size ranged from 1 to 15 mm, and nine were less than 5 mm. Of 12 patients with single DWGs, 9 have remained eugastrinemic after resection (mean follow-up: 5.5 years). None of the patients with multiple DWGs became eugastrinemic after surgery. DWGs are characteristically single, small or microscopic, submucosal, located in the proximal duodenum, rarely metastasize to the liver, and are usually curable by surgical resection.\r"

Mean and median follow-up were 49.7 months and 47 months, respectively. Patients who died during the postoperative period were not included. Perioperative transfusion was defined as administration of whole blood or packed cells within 30 days of operation. The overall cumulative 5-year disease-free survival rate was 67%. In patients with transfusion, it was 53% and in patients without transfusion it was 81% (p = 0.0055). A multivariate analysis was performed that included patient age, race, sex, cell type, extent of operation (pneumonectomy versus lobectomy/segmentectomy), operative blood loss, admission hematocrit, discharge hematocrit, and the presence or absence of perioperative transfusion. The only variable that significantly correlated with 5-year disease-free survival was the presence or absence of perioperative transfusion (p = 0.0278), and this effect was not related to the number of transfusions. Retrospective analysis of long-term results of patients surviving curative operation for stage I lung cancer shows that any perioperative transfusion significantly worsens the patient's prognosis and suggests very strongly that this association is due to an adverse effect of the transfusion rather than the transfusion serving as a marker for another risk factor.\r"

This study defines and examines the clinical sequelae of patients admitted with a suspicion of MCC. Criteria for observation following isolated, minor blunt chest trauma are suggested. Hospital and trauma registry records of patients admitted over a 33-month period with suspected MCC were reviewed. Conventional evaluation criteria, cardiac-related complications, and associated injuries were analyzed for 524 patients. Twenty-eight cardiac-related complications occurred in 27 of 524 patients (5%). These complications included 23 dysrhythmias, 3 infarctions, and 2 pericardial effusions. There were 23 patients with abnormal admission electrocardiograms and 4 with normal ones. Of the latter, one patient developed dysrhythmia 4 hours after admission, and three had other major multi-system injuries requiring admission to the intensive care unit. The overall incidence of cardiac-related complications in minimally injured patients was 0.1%. There were no complications in patients with isolated chest wall contusions, a normal admission electrocardiogram, and a normal rhythm at 4 hours. There was no significant association between creatine phosphokinase isoenzymes or echocardiogram and cardiac-related complications. The complete absence of significant cardiac sequelae in patients with isolated chest wall contusion, normal admission and 4-hour electrocardiograms, and no other associated major injuries suggests that these patients need not be admitted.\r"

This phenomenon has been seen in some neonates undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. We performed echocardiograms and measured creatine phosphokinase isoenzymes and lipid peroxide levels in 16 neonates before, during, and after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Infants who developed stunned myocardia by echocardiography did so shortly after initiation of bypass and exhibited concurrent elevations of the MB fraction of creatine phosphokinase. Lipid peroxide levels did not simultaneously rise. These data suggest that oxygen-derived free radicals may not cause the stunned myocardium seen in neonates undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.\r"

These episodes occurred during mechanical ventilation in 46 patients, during spontaneous ventilation in 15 patients with artificial airways, and the remaining 39 occurred in nonintubated patients. Hypoxemia was recognized by pulse oximetry in 59, arterial blood gas analysis in 24, mixed venous oximetry in 15, and transcutaneous oxygen monitoring in 2. These events were due to problems with the ventilator or airway in 42, recent interventions in 21, new pulmonary process in 19, progression of underlying disease in 11, and unknown causes in 7. Two thirds resulted from mechanical problems amenable to simple intervention; there were two adverse outcomes. In conclusion, acute hypoxia is a frequent potentially morbid SICU event. Advances in continuous oxygen monitoring permit early identification and thereby may limit adverse outcomes, but should not prompt an expensive diagnostic work-up.\r"

The urban trauma center retains an important role in trauma care even when the initial care must be provided at the local level. Twenty-five trauma patients were transferred to University Hospital between 1985 and 1988 after definitive care was initiated in community hospitals. During the same time period, a total of 147 trauma patients were transferred to the trauma service. No information was available on the total incidence of trauma. Medical records were reviewed to determine the reasons for transfer. Major reasons included the need for further complex surgery, better critical care support, and inadequate blood banks. Trauma centers serving rural areas provide a valuable resource well beyond the initial 24 hours.\r"

Of 114 women initially observed mammographically, 2 were later found by biopsy to have carcinoma. Initial assignment to mammographic observation delayed the recommendation for biopsy 3 and 12 months, respectively, in these patients, but no effect on outcome was documented. Because they have benign lesions by clinical and mammographic criteria, 102 women (53%) have been spared biopsy; they continue to be monitored closely. We believe these data support the use of a selective approach to biopsy based on specific mammographic criteria.\r"

A subgroup of 34 (4%) presented with untreated locally advanced disease without demonstrable distant metastases at the time of diagnosis (stage IIIB = T4abed, NX-2,MO). During the first 5 years (1975 through 1979), 17 patients were treated primarily with sequential radiotherapy and chemotherapy (Group A). From 1980 to 1984 (Group B), the management consisted of four courses of induction multi-drug chemotherapy followed primarily by mastectomy and additional chemotherapy. The mean follow-up for the most recent group (Group B) is 48 months. Follow-up was complete. While the local disease control rate was the same for both groups (76%), the survival was remarkably different. Group A patients experienced a median survival of 15 months, and only one survived 5 years. In Group B, the median survival was 56 months with nine patients (53%) alive between 40 and 76 months, seven (41%) of whom are 5-year survivors. While the overall mortality of patients with inflammatory breast cancer was greater in both groups when compared with the group with noninflammatory disease, the survival of patients in Group B was better than in Group A for both inflammatory and noninflammatory cancers (p less than 0.01). Estrogen receptor, nodal, and menopausal status did not influence survival. These data suggest that neoadjuvant chemotherapy improves survival for patients with stage IIIB breast carcinoma and delays the establishment or progression of distant metastases. Mastectomy is an important component in the treatment of this disease.\r"

There were 763 catheter insertions attempted with prospective documentation of complications in 664 consecutive patients. Catheter insertion was successful in 722 attempts (95%). There were only 13 pneumothoraces (2%). Thirty catheters required repositioning (4%). The average catheter duration was 191 days (range: 0 to 892 days). Fifty-six catheters (8%) were removed because of suspected infection. Documented catheter sepsis occurred in 21 patients (3%); catheter site infection occurred in 8 patients (1%). Thus, only 0.22 infections per catheter year occurred during this 382 catheter-year experience. The estimated cost of catheter insertion was $562, which is one-third the estimated cost for tunneled catheters ($1,403) and for reservoir devices ($1,738). In our experience, percutaneous subclavian catheterization is a reliable, cost-effective method compared with tunneled or reservoir devices, with an equivalent incidence of catheter-related infections. The cornerstone of our success with this program is a staff dedicated to catheter care and intensive patient education. In centers where a large number of patients require central venous access, percutaneous catheterization should be the technique of choice.\r"

Ten patients without volume therapy served as a control group. Significantly less hypertonic solution than standard solution was effective in doubling pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Fluid requirements in the patients who received the hypertonic solution were significantly less during, as well as after, cardiopulmonary bypas in comparison to those in the other groups. Cardiac index increased most in the patients who received the hypertonic solution (+34.8%), as did right ventricular end-diastolic volume. Patients in that group showed the highest decrease in total systemic resistance (-29.8%), whereas arterial pressure and right ventricular ejection fraction remained almost unchanged in all groups. No negative alteration in coagulation or organ function was demonstrated within the investigation period. It can be concluded that hypertonic saline hydroxyethyl starch solution seems to be a valuable alternative to conventional volume therapy in cardiac surgery.\r"

Major intra-operative events that cause concern appear to be related to the severity of the presenting illness and the development of respiratory failure. Others have reported the development of intra-operative cardiac failure. All cases were successfully managed operatively using conventional one-lung anaesthesia, although resort to partial cardiopulmonary bypass may have been indicated in some. The indications and attitudes to utilising cardiopulmonary bypass in the evolution of techniques for facilitating single-lung transplantation are reviewed.\r"

  ".W": "Within 15 min of endotracheal intubation, the resolution of pulmonary edema was studied over the next 12 h in 34 mechanically ventilated patients by (1) serial measurements of the alveolar-arterial oxygen difference, (2) the extent of edema on the initial and follow-up chest radiograph, and (3) by an initial and final measurement of total protein and albumin concentration in sequential samples of pulmonary edema fluid. Based on the oxygenation and chest radiographic data, 24 patients clinically improved and 10 patients did not improve. In the 10 patients who did not clinically improve (3, hydrostatic edema; 7, permeability edema), there was no change in the final edema fluid protein concentration (4.1 +/- 1.1 g/100 ml) compared with the initial edema fluid protein concentration (4.2 +/- 1.0 g/100 ml) (p = ns). However, in the 24 patients who clinically improved (15, hydrostatic edema; 9, permeability edema), there was an increase in every patient's final edema protein concentration (5.6 +/- 2.3 g/100 ml) compared with their initial edema protein concentration (3.8 +/- 1.2 g/100 ml) (p less than 0.01). In 13 of these 24 patients, the final edema fluid concentration (7.3 +/- 1.6 g/100 ml) exceeded the final plasma protein concentration (5.6 +/- 0.8 g/100 ml) by a mean value of 1.7 g/100 ml protein. The data provide the first evidence in humans to support the hypothesis that active ion transport across the alveolar epithelial barrier is the primary mechanism for clearance of edema fluid from the air spaces of the lung.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To investigate circulating PAF in persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), we studied PAF and its degradative enzyme, acetylhydrolase. Thirteen neonates with PPHN, diagnosed by routine clinical methods including echocardiography, were compared to six age-matched control patients with respiratory distress. Overall, plasma PAF levels were elevated in patients with PPHN compared to control patients (20.1 +/- 3.9 versus 1.6 +/- 0.7 ng/ml, p less than 0.01). In addition, plasma PAF concentrations in patients with PPHN correlated with the severity of disease as defined by the delta AaPO2 (r = 0.65, p = 0.015). In three patients with elevated PAF levels, as the clinical status improved, the plasma PAF values decreased. Acetylhydrolase activity was similar in both groups (3.96 +/- 0.90 versus 3.78 +/- 1.44 nmol/ml/min, p = NS). We conclude that PAF production is increased in PPHN and that abnormal production of PAF may be associated with pulmonary hypertension.\r"

Ten mongrel dogs were anesthetized and mechanically ventilated. Five received a bolus infusion of Escherichia coli endotoxin (5 mg/kg), and the remainder received a sham infusion. After 4 to 5 h, the anesthetized dogs were rapidly exsanguinated, and femoral, renal, and superior mesenteric arteries were removed. Arterial rings were mounted on force transducers in organ baths; contraction to phenylephrine or potassium-substituted Krebs-Henseleit solution (KCl), and relaxation to nitroprusside or acetylcholine were studied. Smooth muscle contractions to phenylephrine or KCl were similar between sham and endotoxin for each agonist. Also, nitroprusside-elicited relaxation from half-maximal phenylephrine-elicited contraction was similar. However, relaxation elicited by acetylcholine was markedly impaired in vessels from endotoxin-treated dogs. The negative log molar concentration of acetylcholine producing 50% relaxation for femoral arteries was 7.38 +/- 0.11 (endotoxin) versus 8.09 +/- 0.12 (control, p = 0.002), for renal arteries it was 6.71 +/- 0.33 (endotoxin) versus 7.81 +/- 0.18 (control, p = 0.019), and for mesenteric arteries it was 7.27 +/- 0.03 (endotoxin) versus 7.95 +/- 0.15 (control, p = 0.002). These results demonstrate that endotoxin treatment impairs endothelium-dependent relaxation of canine arteries in vitro. The data suggest that vascular changes in endotoxemia are accompanied by alteration in endothelial cell function, perhaps through altered endothelial production of vasodilatory mediators.\r"

Patients with symptomatic pulmonary sarcoidosis underwent pulmonary function tests and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage. Patients were treated with 10 mg methotrexate or prednisone weekly for at least 6 months and repeat studies were performed. A comparison was made between those patients receiving methotrexate (12 patients) and those receiving prednisone (12 patients). For both groups, there was a significant improvement in the vital capacity with therapy (Prednisone: Pre = 2.5 +/- 0.14 L (Mean +/- SEM); Post = 3.1 +/- 0.18 L, p less than 0.01; Methotrexate: Pre = 2.4 +/- 0.14 L; Post = 2.8 +/- 0.18 L, p less than 0.01).

Alveolar macrophages from the symptomatic sarcoid patients were found to be spontaneously releasing hydrogen peroxide and tumor necrosis factor. After treatment with either prednisone or methotrexate, alveolar macrophages retrieved by lavage spontaneously released less of either macrophage product. We found that effective doses of methotrexate for sarcoidosis led to significant changes in lymphocyte and macrophages retrieved by lavage.\r"

All were perfused with Tyrode's solution mixed 1:1 with autologous whole blood at 40 ml/min/kg for 30 min, and then degassed. A modified natural surfactant (Survanta, Ross Laboratories) was then injected into the trachea of four lungs injured with HCl (100 mg/kg at 25 mg/ml). Two quasi-static pressure-volume curves were determined. The mean alveolar pressures at 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90% of TLC were greater in the HCl group than in the control group (p less than 0.05). However, no difference was observed between the control lungs and those that received HCl + Survanta. In 13 anesthetized, paralyzed, and ventilated rabbits, deflation pressure-volume curves were determined from TLC to FRC (measured by helium dilution). Then, 0.1 N HCl (3 ml/kg) was injected into the trachea and, in seven, Survanta was instilled 5 min later. The mean alveolar pressures at 60, 70, 80, and 90% TLC were higher at 15 and 60 min in the HCl group compared with their pre-HCl time point (p less than 0.05). In the HCl + Survanta group, no differences were seen at 15 min, and only slight increased were seen at 60 min. No effect of surfactant replacement on arterial blood gases was observed. HCl aspiration increased recoil in both excised and in vivo lungs, and surfactant replacement with Survanta returned recoil to normal.\r"

Resistance was measured by both constant flow inflation and occlusion methods as inspiratory flow rates were increased from 0.66 to 2.0 L/s. Endotracheal tube resistance was subtracted from total resistance to obtain respiratory resistance. In contrast to the flow-dependent increase in endotracheal tube resistance, respiratory resistance decreased continuously as flow rate and airway pressure increased, except in four of six patients with asthma in whom respiratory resistance increased as flow increased. Mechanical airway dilatation, tissue resistance, stress relaxation, and time-constant inequalities may contribute to the decrease in respiratory resistance. In status asthmaticus, however, the effects of turbulence, noncompliant airways, and/or \"reflex\" bronchoconstriction may be sufficient to cause a flow-dependent increase in resistance.\r"

  ".W": "Because flow-volume loops (FVLs) are clinically useful in evaluating upper airway (UA) obstruction and the fact that patency of the nasopharyngeal ventilatory pathway is important to the prevention of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the present study examined the role of nasal compared with oral FVLs in evaluating patients with OSA. Fourteen obese male patients 56 +/- 3 yr of age with a mean apnea plus hypopnea index (AHI) of 51 +/- 9/h were studied along with 14 nonobese, healthy, age- and sex-matched control subjects whose mean AHI was 6 +/- 1/h. Nasal and oral FVLs obtained in the normal subjects indicated the nose behaved like a variable resistor, with flow limitation during inspiration but not during expiration. In the patient group, flow limitation was observed during expiration as well as inspiration indicating nondistensibility of the nasopharyngeal ventilatory pathway in the patients compared to the control subjects. A change in body position from upright to supine in the OSA group was associated with small reductions in expiratory but not inspiratory flow rates. The area under the nasal supine flow-volume loop (FVLANaSup) was found to be highly correlated with awake resting PaO2 (r = 0.80) and PaCO2 (r = -0.83) in the patient group. In addition, multiple linear regression analysis revealed that PaO2 and the area under the nasal FVLs independently contributed to the prediction of AHI with a multiple R of 0.89. These results suggest that limitations to ventilation via the nasopharynx may significantly influence both gas exchange and the frequency of sleep-disordered breathing in patients with OSA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Serum levels of p24 antigen and erythropoietin, and CD4-positive helper T-lymphocytes in blood were assessed in 36 additional patients with various clinical stages of HIV infection. In patients with MAI infection, survival was significantly related only to total lymphocyte count, hematocrit, platelet count, and sex. Of these, hematocrit and total lymphocyte count were the only linear predictors of survival. Anemia was significantly more profound in patients with AIDS and MAI than in the other patients. This anemia in patients with MAI could not be ascribed to increased peripheral destruction of red cells, deficient nutritional factors, or erythropoietin production, HIV viral or bacterial load, or a general effect on other blood elements such as neutrophils or platelets. The influence of MAI on survival in patients with AIDS did depend upon whether the MAI occurred as an index infection or was preceded by other opportunistic infections. Patients with other preceding opportunistic infection lived for a much shorter duration from the time of diagnosis of MAI.\r"

A total of 50 episodes of nosocomial pneumonia in critically ill patients in which etiologic diagnosis was well established were prospectively followed in a medical-surgical intensive care unit (ICU). S. aureus was isolated in a total of 13 episodes. In the univariate analysis the variables significantly associated with S. aureus nosocomial pneumonia were below 25 yr of age, coma, nonuse of corticosteroids, and antecedent trauma. A step-forward logistic regression analysis defined only coma as significantly influencing the risk of developing S. aureus nosocomial pneumonia. We suggest that antimicrobial drugs active against S. aureus must be included in the initial empirical antimicrobial regimen for treating nosocomial pneumonia in patients with coma. The identification of factors influencing the etiology and the possibility of earlier effective antimicrobial treatment may represent a further step in the control of nosocomial pneumonia in critically ill patients by improving its prognosis.\r"

A series of 421 chest X-rays corresponding to consecutive autopsies was reviewed by six B readers working independently and using modified International Labour Organization forms. The prevalence of true pleural thickening was approximately 6%. Using a strict definition of positivity, the average specificity was 0.85. Specificity decreased when a more liberal definition was used. (The average sensitivity was 0.32, which appeared to increase with a more liberal definition of positivity; because of small numbers of true positives, the sensitivity estimates were unstable.) Kappa statistics for interreader agreement ranged from 0.06 to 0.40, suggesting considerable interreader variability. Decreasing film quality was associated with decreasing sensitivity, but specificity was not affected by film quality. Because the chest X-ray has suboptimal test characteristics in the diagnosis of pleural thickening and because there is considerable interreader variability, we conclude that caution is required in interpreting radiologic detection of pleural thickening using ILO procedures.\r"

To compare the effects of the commercial amphibole asbestos amosite on parenchymal fibrosis, we histologically graded fibrosis in four different sites in the lungs of 20 shipyard and insulation workers with heavy amosite exposure and measured by analytic electron microscopy fiber concentration and size in corresponding portions of lung tissue. Fibrosis grade was found to be strongly positively correlated with amosite concentration and negatively correlated with mean fiber size parameters, including fiber length, width, surface area, and mass. A comparison of our present results with our data on the chrysotile miners and millers showed that the regression lines of fibrosis grade versus concentration for amosite, chrysotile, and tremolite were statistically different. These findings indicate that amosite concentration, like chrysotile and tremolite concentration, is closely and directly related to fibrosis at the local lung level. Furthermore, these observations again raise the possibility that short fibers may be more important than is commonly believed in the genesis of fibrosis in man.

Data on 1-s forced expiratory volume, FEV1 (adjusted for age, sex, race, height, and ascertainment group) and the number of cigarettes smoked per day were available on 978 individuals in 384 nuclear families residing in the Baltimore metropolitan area. All these individuals were seen twice between 1971 and 1981, with an average of 5 yr between visits. The direct effect of an individual's own smoking explained 10 and 3% of variation in adjusted FEV1 among parents and offspring, respectively. Shared environmental factors influencing personal smoking behavior accounted for 5% of the parent-offspring correlation in adjusted FEV1 and 3% of the sibling correlation in adjusted FEV1 in this sample. Undefined environmental factors that influenced an individual's smoking habits and could be shared among relatives were found to explain 19% of the familial correlations in smoking. Genetic heritability estimates ranged between 36 and 40%, with no evidence of intergenerational differences in the expression of apparent genetic control of pulmonary function.\r"

  ".W": "The paper mills in South Karelia, the southeast part of Finland, are responsible for releasing a substantial amount of malodorous sulfur compounds such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S), methyl mercaptan (CH3SH), and methyl sulfides [(CH3)2S and (CH3)2S2], into ambient air. In the most polluted residential area the annual mean concentrations of hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan are estimated to be 8 and 2 to 5 micrograms/m3 and the highest daily average concentration 100 and 50 micrograms/m3. The annual mean and highest daily concentrations of sulfur dioxide (SO2) are very low. We studied the effects of malodorous sulfur compounds on eye, nasal and respiratory symptoms, and headache in adults. A cross-sectional self-administered questionnaire was distributed in February 1987 and responded to by 488 adults living in a severely (n = 198), a moderately (n = 204), and a nonpolluted community (n = 86). This included questions about occurrence of the symptoms of interest during the previous 4 wk and 12 months and individual, behavioral, and other environmental determinants of the symptoms. The response rate was 83%. The odds ratios (OR) for symptoms experienced often or constantly in severely versus nonpolluted and moderately versus nonpolluted communities were estimated in logistic regression analysis controlling potential confounders. The odds ratios for eye (moderate exposure OR 11.70, Cl95% 2.33 to 58.65; severe exposure OR 11.78, Cl95% 2.35 to 59.09) and nasal symptoms (OR 2.01, Cl95% 0.97 to 4.15; OR 2.19, Cl95% 1.06 to 4.55) and cough (OR 1.89, Cl95% 0.61 to 5.86; OR 3.06, Cl95% 1.02 to 9.29) during the previous 12 months were increased, with a dose-response pattern.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The cumulative prevalence of asthma or wheezing was 13.2% and of hay fever, 32%. There were significant correlations in liability to reported disease among twins, and these were higher in monozygotic twins (MZ) (r = 0.65) than in dizygotic twins (DZ) (r = 0.25), and in male MZ twins (r = 0.75) compared with female MZ twins (r = 0.60). Analysis under the assumptions of the classic twin model suggested that there were genetic factors common to asthma and hay fever, with a correlation in genetic liability to the traits of 0.52 for men and 0.65 for women. These genes acted substantially in a nonadditive fashion in men but not in women. As the genetic correlation was significantly less than unity, this implied additional genetic factors influencing either or both diseases individually. The estimated heritability of these diseases was 60 to 70% in this population. Environmental causes of both diseases also were correlated (r = 0.53 for men and 0.33 for women). Cigarette smoking was only weakly associated with wheezing.\r"

The prevalence of immunologic sensitization and occupational asthma to psyllium is unknown. We investigated the personnel of four chronic care hospitals, including two where four cases of occupational asthma had been confirmed the year preceding the trial. A questionnaire and skin prick tests with psyllium and various inhalants were administered to 193 of 248 (78%) of the workers who agreed to participate. Seventy-five subjects (39%) had a history of respiratory symptoms in normal life and/or respiratory symptoms and/or rhinoconjunctivitis after handling psyllium. Six (3%) showed skin reactivity to psyllium. Increased specific IgE antibodies were found in 20 of 162 of the sera that were tested (12%). In the second part of the study, a histamine inhalation challenge was performed on 70 of 75 (93%) of the subjects with a history suggestive of asthma and/or occupational asthma and/or skin reactivity to psyllium. Twenty (29%) had significant bronchial hyperresponsiveness. The six subjects with a history suggestive of occupational asthma (n = 3) and/or asthma (n = 6) and/or positive skin test results to psyllium (n = 6) had significant bronchial hyperresponsiveness and increased specific IgE levels. They all underwent specific inhalation challenges with psyllium in the laboratory. Four developed bronchospastic reactions (two immediate and two dual reactions). We conclude that by including the initial four cases reported in the year preceding the initiation of this trial, the prevalence of IgE sensitization to psyllium was between 5 (skin testing) and 12% (increased specific IgE levels).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Bradykinin, kallidin (lys-bradykinin), and [des-Arg9]bradykinin are oligopeptides that may contribute as mediators in the pathogenesis of asthma by interacting with specific receptors designated B1 and B2. In this study, we have investigated the airway response to inhaled bradykinin, kallidin, and [des-Arg9]bradykinin in normal and asthmatic subjects. Changes in airway caliber were followed as maximum expiratory flow at 30% of the vital capacity (Vp30) and as forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1). Only one of the six normal subjects responded to bradykinin at the maximum cumulative concentration (5.33 mg/ml). Neither kallidin nor [des-Arg9]bradykinin had any measurable bronchoconstrictor effect in the normal subjects whether airway caliber was measured as Vp30 or FEV1. In the 10 subjects with asthma, bradykinin and kallidin, but not [des-Arg9]bradykinin, produced a concentration-related fall in FEV1. The geometric mean provocation concentrations of inhaled agonist reducing FEV1 by 20% of baseline were 0.03, 0.08, and 0.44 mg/ml for bradykinin, kallidin, and histamine, respectively. Bronchoconstriction produced by bradykinin and kallidin was maximal within 3 to 5 min with recovery occurring over 30 to 45 min. Because bradykinin and kallidin are agonists of B2 receptors and [des-Arg9]bradykinin is an agonist for B1 receptors, these in vivo structure activity studies suggest that asthmatic, but not normal, airways are hyperresponsive to kinins when compared to histamine and that this potent bronchoconstrictor action is a specific pharmacologic effect compatible with the stimulation of B2 receptors or a variant of these.\r"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the changes in airway reactivity with age in infants and young children. We tested 24 healthy term subjects 4 to 24 months of age (mean 13 months) with history negative for lower respiratory illnesses and wheezing. Airway function was assessed by maximal expiratory flow at FRC (VmaxFRC), generated by rapid chest compression. After baseline measurements, each subject inhaled increasing concentrations of methacholine (Mch), beginning with 0.075 mg/ml, until VmaxFRC decreased 30% or Mch = 2.5 mg/ml. Sensitivity to Mch was defined as the threshold concentration (TC) required to decrease VmaxFRC 2 SD from control, and the Mch required to decrease VmaxFRC 30% (PC-30). Airway reactivity was defined as the slope between TC and PC-30 (SPC-30). We found significant regressions for TC, PC-30, and log SPC-30 versus age. TC and PC-30 increased with increasing age (r = 0.51, p less than 0.02; r = 0.63, p less than 0.001, respectively), indicating decreasing sensitivity to Mch with increasing age. Log SPC-30 became less steep with increasing age (r = -0.59, p less than 0.01), reflecting decreasing reactivity to Mch with increasing age. Of these infants, 10 had their Mch challenge repeated a mean of 8 months (range 4 to 11.5) following their initial test, with no lower respiratory illnesses in the interim.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

If this is true, prevalence data on BHR in a general population should show an independent association between BHR and smoking status. To test this, we analyzed BHR to inhaled methacholine in 654 white men without known asthma, in relation to smoking, skin-test reactivity, type of work (office versus industrial), and indicators of baseline airway caliber (FEV1 % predicted and FEV1/FVC). BHR was measured in the traditional way (PC20) and as the slope of FEV1 versus the methacholine concentration (linear scale). A PC20 of less than 16 mg/ml was considered \"responsive\" for analyses of this outcome. We found that although a positive skin test, smoking, and being an industrial worker all appeared to be significant predictors of increased BHR (p less than 0.05), once FEV1 (% predicted) and FEV1/FVC% were taken into account, none of these variables alone remained significantly associated with BHR. The strongest predictors of BHR were prechallenge FEV1 and FEV1/FVC (both p less than 0.01). The combination of smoking, atopy, and work groups, which identified a small subgroup of atopic smokers who were office workers, also remained significantly associated with increased BHR. We also used a regression model that allowed for comparison of predictors for BHR between the most responsive subset of the population (n = 84) and the remainder of the study population.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Sodium metabisulfite (MBS), a commonly used preservative, induces bronchoconstriction in asthmatics, probably through the release of sulfur dioxide (SO2). The mechanisms involved in MBS- and SO2-induced bronchoconstriction are not yet certain. We aerosolized MBS or acid control solution (pH, 2.7) to anesthetized, tracheostomized guinea pigs pretreated intravenously with propranolol (1 mg/kg). MBS was given at increasing doubling concentrations (0.01, 0.02, 0.04, and 0.08 M) every 5 min. Steep concentration-response curves were observed, and most animals responded at 0.02 or 0.04 M. Tachyphylaxis was seen at high concentrations and during a subsequent MBS challenge 15 min later. For pharmacologic studies, we stopped the challenge when lung resistance (RL) had increased by at least 350%; a second challenge was found to be reproducible. MBS response was measured as the concentration needed to increase RL by 350% (PC350). Atropine (1 mg/kg given intravenously) did not affect PC350 or the peak RL response. Inhibition of neutral endopeptidase by inhaled phosphoramidon (7.5 nmol) administered before the repeated challenge did not alter PC350 value to MBS or peak RL responses (phosphoramidon, 201 +/- 49% of first peak; vehicle, 164 +/- 35%). In addition, the increase in RL was not prolonged in the phosphoramidon-treated group. Animals treated subcutaneously with capsaicin (50 mg/kg) 1 wk before the experiment, so as to deplete neuropeptides from airway sensory nerves, had PC350 values similar to those of the control animals. Our data demonstrate that inhaled MBS causes bronchoconstriction in guinea pigs by mechanisms that are due neither to a cholinergic reflex nor to the release of tachykinins from airway sensory nerves.\r"

Experiments were performed on isolated diaphragm strips from three groups of animals 4.9 +/- 0.4 (SE), 12.8 +/- 0.2, and 18.8 +/- 0.3 months of age. Aging was associated with a decrease in the maximal isometric tension generated per unit cross-sectional area of muscle and slowing in the time-to-peak tension and rate of muscle relaxation. The velocity of muscle shortening at a given load was also significantly less in older than in younger animals, and the force-velocity curve became flatter with advancing age as reflected by increases in the Hill coefficient (a/P0). Changes in maximal active tension and maximal velocity of unloaded shortening with aging correlated weakly (r greater than 0.3; p less than 0.05) and were of similar magnitude (-17 to -21%), suggesting that aging affects these two indices of muscle function in similar fashion. Finally, the diaphragm fatigued more rapidly in older than in younger animals. We conclude that aging depresses the ability of the adult diaphragm to generate tension and to shorten and resist fatigue.\r"

To determine the direct effect of cooling on the response of tracheal muscle to parasympathetic and muscarinic stimuli in situ, the temperature of a segment of canine cervical trachea was adjusted to 37 degrees, 30 degrees, or 25 degrees C by superfusing temperature-controlled saline over its epithelial surface. The contractile response of the tracheal muscle to electrical stimulation of the vagus nerves and to intra-arterial acetylcholine was then determined. Cooling the segment to 25 degrees C decreased the contraction induced by parasympathetic stimulation. However, cooling did not alter the contraction induced by intra-arterial acetylcholine. Parallel studies were conducted in vitro using nine excised tracheal muscle strips taken from the same section of trachea in three additional dogs. Cooling the tracheal muscle to 25 degrees C in vitro increased the maximal contraction induced by both electrical field stimulation and by acetylcholine. Thus, cooling in situ does not alter the response of tracheal muscle to muscarinic stimuli and inhibits the response to parasympathetic stimuli. These data indicate that augmentation of the tracheal muscle response elicited by cooling in vitro does not reflect the response in situ. They suggest that a direct effect of cooling on airway smooth muscle response to parasympathetic and muscarinic stimuli does not account for cooling-induced bronchoconstriction in vivo.\r"

Eosinophils were obtained from lungs of rats infected with Toxocara canis by bronchoalveolar lavage, incubated with PMA, and administered to an isolated perfused rat lung preparation. Vascular endothelial permeability was assessed by measuring the capillary filtration coefficient (Kf,c) in the perfused lungs. In lungs receiving either no eosinophils (control) or nonactivated eosinophils, there were no changes in pulmonary hemodynamics or Kf,c. However, in lungs receiving 2 x 10(6) eosinophils activated with PMA, there was a transient 4.8-fold increase in pulmonary vascular resistance that peaked at 30 min, primarily due to the constriction of small arteries and veins. After the initial pressor response, Kf,c was increased to 7.5 times control at 130 min and resulted in marked lung edema, increased wet-dry weight ratios, and edema on histologic examination. Pulmonary arterial pressure and Kf,c responses were dose related for eosinophil numbers between 1 x 10(6) and 4 x 10(6) cells. Peak airway pressure (Paw) during constant tidal volume ventilation also increased in lungs receiving activated eosinophils compared to the control and nonactivated eosinophil groups. These findings indicate that activated eosinophils are potent effector cells and can cause pulmonary vasoconstriction, bronchoconstriction, and vascular endothelial injury without widespread plugging of capillaries by aggregated eosinophils.\r"

  ".W": "Pulmonary colonization and infection with nontypable (unencapsulated) Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) occurs commonly in the setting of chronic lung diseases. Because the study of NTHI pulmonary infection in animal models has been limited by the rapid clearance of organisms, a model of persistent pulmonary infection was developed. Groups of rats were inoculated by transtracheal instillation of viable NTHI suspended in broth or semisolid agar. Some rats had received hexamethylphosphoramide (HMP) in drinking water before inoculation to cause respiratory epithelial mucosal damage. Groups of animals were sacrificed serially. Lungs were cultured quantitatively and their gross and microscopic anatomy examined. NTHI was recovered in small quantities from few broth-inoculated rats after the first day of infection and in none after Day 7. In contrast, NTHI was recovered from the majority of animals and in greater amounts through 2 wk after agar-borne inoculation. HMP pretreatment further enhanced recovery through 4 wk after inoculation with an agar vehicle. The pulmonary inflammatory reaction was brief in broth-inoculated rats. The longer persistence of gross and histologic changes seen in agar-infected lungs paralleled the enhanced recovery of NTHI. Abscess formation occurred at 7 to 14 days in some agar-inoculated animals. Thus pulmonary inoculation of NTHI in a viscous vehicle resulted in perpetuation of infection and inflammatory response, and previous damage to respiratory mucosal epithelium induced by HMP further enhanced such infection.\r"

A group of 10 sheep were anesthetized with halothane and pancuronium followed by endotracheal intubation. In the first experiment 5 sheep were given air (sham group) and 5 were insufflated with cooled cotton smoke with a modified bee smoker. In the second part of our study (Experiment 2) the animals were insufflated with the following number of smoke breaths: 1 x 12 (n = 3); 2 x 12 (n = 4); 3 x 12 (n = 4) 4 x 12 (n = 4); and sham control (n = 1). After 30 min the animals were killed with KCl and the trachea prepared for scanning, transmission electron, and light microscopy. Our initial observation with scanning electron microscopy revealed a large amount of mucus on the surface of the epithelia. Numerous ciliated cells had been sloughed from the epithelium and were observed on the surface of the remaining ciliated cells. The sloughed cells were intact, and the cilia remained on the apical cell surface. Light and transmission electron microscopy revealed that most goblet cells were in the process of extruding mucus. The cytoplasm of goblet and basal cells appeared normal. Ciliated cells had a slightly vesiculated cytoplasm, and many were in the process of being sloughed from the epithelial surface. In these cells desmosomal attachment had been separated. The light microscope evaluation of the tracheal epithelium showed there was no dose-dependent effect between the four treatment groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Neuropeptides of the bombesin family provide potent mitogens to elucidate these pathways. These peptides bind to specific receptors that have been characterized by radioligand binding and sensitivity to antagonists and identified as glycoproteins with a Mr of 75,000-85,000 by chemical cross-linking. After binding, bombesin elicits a cascade of early molecular events including stimulation of phosphorylation of the acidic Mr 80,000 cellular protein, which is a major substrate of protein kinase C; Ca2+ mobilization mediated by Ins(1,4,5)P3, Na+ and K+ fluxes, transmodulation of EGF receptor, enhancement of cAMP accumulation, and expression of the proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-myc. Studies using membrane preparations and permeabilized 3T3 cells indicate that G proteins play a role in the transduction of the mitogenic signal triggered by the binding of bombesin to its receptor. A pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein couples the bombesin receptor to the generation of a signal that activates protein kinase C, whereas a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein mediates cross-talk between transmembrane signaling pathways. Bombesin-mediated mitogenesis can be blocked by different antagonists and by interrupting the signal-transduction process at various postreceptor levels. Thus, prolonged treatment with vasopressin causes heterologous desensitization to the mitogenic action of bombesin. This mitogenic block is mediated by uncoupling the receptor from its signaling system. Loss of responsiveness to bombesin-stimulated DNA synthesis is also induced by down-regulation of protein kinase C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The usefulness of phosphotyrosine antibodies for the detection of physiologically regulated or deregulated tyrosine kinases is discussed in this report. This rather rare enzymatic activity is shared by receptors for some polypeptide growth factors and by the products of Class 1 oncogenes. The antibodies are able to detect proteins phosphorylated on tyrosine in fibroblasts stimulated with growth factors such as EGF and PDGF. The major phosphorylated protein species are the receptors themselves, which undergo phosphorylation only after the addition of the exogenous factor and only transiently. Phosphotyrosine antibodies were able to detect the products of the retroviral Class 1 oncogenes, which are endowed with deregulated tyrosine kinase activity. In fact, in these cases a constitutive phosphorylation of the relevant proteins was observed, which occurred continuously and independently of the presence or lack of exogenous ligands. A tyrosine kinase constitutively activated in human gastric carcinoma cells was detected by P-Tyr antibodies. This molecule has been characterized at the molecular level, and the mechanisms responsible for its enzymatic activation have been investigated. The question of whether the tyrosine kinase identified is responsible for the induction and the maintenance of the transformed phenotype in gastric carcinomas remains to be answered. It is reasonable to suggest that this might be the case by analogy with other situations such as Class 1 oncogenes activated by transduction by retroviruses, abnormal expression of EGF receptors, or deregulated activity of c-abl-encoded proteins in chronic myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Thus, the search for deregulated kinases by means of phosphotyrosine antibodies seems to be useful for identifying new activated oncogenes in clinical oncology.\r"

  ".W": "The development of human lung cancer may require multiple genetic deletions affecting a number of chromosomes, e.g., 1, 3, 11, 13, and 17. These genetic aberrations may induce the activation of proto-oncogenes (c-jun, ras, c-raf1) and the loss of tumor suppressor genes (p53). Some of the activated proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are more selectively expressed or absent in small-cell lung cancer (L-myc, c-myb, c-scr, Rb gene) or non-small-cell lung cancer (c-erbB-2, c-sis, c-fes). These genes may thus be of importance for selection of differentiation pathway. The c-myc oncogene is frequently amplified in small-cell lung cancer cell lines in a much higher frequency than in vivo. This indicates that c-myc seems to be related to tumor progression and a relatively late event in the lung cancer development. The uncontrolled production of multiple growth factors has been identified in human lung cancer cell lines. These factors can promote and inhibit the proliferation via paracrine and autocrine loops via specific receptors. The products from some of the activated proto-oncogenes (c-sis, c-erbB-2) are sequences homologous to a certain growth factor (PDGF) and a receptor (EGF) identified in lung cancer. The production and action of these growth factors may be of major importance for further activation of proto-oncogenes via intracellular signal transduction and specific oncogenic activation leading to further tumor progression.\r"

The ras proteins acquire transforming potential when a point mutation in the gene leads to replacement of an amino acid in one of the critical positions 12, 13, or 61. Overexpression of the normal protein, usually associated with gene amplification, can have similar effects. The detection of mutationally activated ras genes has been facilitated by the development of oligonucleotide hybridization assays that allow the identification of each possible mutation at the critical sites. Employment of the polymerase chain reaction has greatly increased the sensitivity of these assays. Studies of human lung cancer have shown that adenocarcinoma is the only subtype associated with ras mutations. These occur in about 30% of primary tumors. In almost all cases, the mutation is present in codon 12 of the K-ras gene. No mutations have been observed to date in tumors of nonsmokers, suggesting that the mutation may result from exposure to carcinogenic ingredients of tobacco smoke. Amplifications of ras genes were shown to be very uncommon in clinically early stages of lung cancer. Analysis of the clinical data of patients who were operated on for adenocarcinoma of the lung shows that K-ras mutations are not associated with particular histologic characteristics of the tumors or with specific presenting features. Patients with K-ras mutations, however, had significantly worse survival than did those without an activation.\r"

  ".W": "Tissues in adults can be maintained at constant mass or they can increase or decrease in size because of imbalances of synthetic and degradative processes acting at the cellular and molecular levels. Some size changes are caused by physiologic conditions to which the tissue must adjust. Alternatively, the balance may be distorted in favor of net tissue increase in pathologic situations such as cancer. Strict regulatory mechanisms are required to keep proliferation responsive to the organism's needs; these mechanisms may be defective in disease. Net tissue proliferation requires repeated rounds of cell duplication in excess of that necessary to counterbalance cell death. Duplication of a cell requires a net doubling of its every molecule and structure. The myriad of molecular events required for cell proliferation such as DNA duplication and its partitioning at mitosis are tightly regulated in normal cells. One may conceive of two classes of molecules: those required for \"housekeeping,\" which constitute the cell's structural and functional machinery, and those such as growth factors, their receptors, and second messengers involved in signal transduction responsible for regulating the activities of the housekeeping molecules. These molecular events and the cascade of processes that control them can be organized within the sequence of the cell cycle. In this brief overview, we illustrate these issues with a few examples taken from very recent discoveries of novel proteins that appear to have major regulatory roles. Most of these results have been obtained with mammalian fibroblasts, but some have originated with discoveries made using two very different yeasts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Peptide growth factors are known to control not only cell proliferation but other events such as differentiation, chemotaxis, and matrix deposition as well. The transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) family of regulatory peptides serves as a prime example to illustrate the multiplicity of effects elicited by peptide growth factors in various lung-derived cell types. At present, the TGF beta family consists of at least 17 proteins and, based on sequence analysis, they can be divided into two groups: a cluster that shows very high sequence similarity to TGF beta 1, the closely related group, and a cluster that shows weaker sequence similarity to TGF beta 1, the distantly related group. The purpose of this brief review is to summarize the salient features of TGF beta structure and regulatory abilities of the closely related group. In addition, we will outline the evidence suggesting a role for TGF beta in normal lung development and physiology. Emphasis will be placed on studies with the closely related members TGF beta 1 and TGF beta 2 because, until recently, purified protein was available only for these two proteins.\r"

Environmental factors in conjunction with genetic factors are important determinants in this disease. The acquisition of defects in the control of proliferation and differentiation appears to constitute crucial steps in the transition of a normal to a neoplastic cell. Several factors have been identified that control positively or negatively the proliferation and differentiation of tracheobronchial epithelial cells. These factors include EGF/TGF alpha, TGF beta, insulin/IGFI, KGF, certain cytokines, retinoids, and activators of protein kinase C. Studies with neoplastic cells have identified several protooncogenes and tumor suppressor genes whose gene products are involved in the regulation of cell growth of normal tracheobronchial epithelial cells, and when mutated, lost, or activated, bring about a neoplastic phenotype. Future studies on the precise function of these genes will help to elucidate the mechanisms by which proliferation and differentiation in normal tracheobronchial epithelial cells are regulated and help to understand the molecular changes involved in diseases such as cancer.\r"

  ".W": "The evaluation of the cancer cell is a complex multigene process. Tumor suppressor genes that are lost or inactivated, as well as genes that are overexpressed, play key roles in tumor progression. The identification of overexpressed genes has been expedited by the presence of transforming genes in some animal retroviruses. However, tumor suppressor genes have been difficult to identify and isolate because of their loss or inactivation during tumorigenesis. By a variety of methods, summarized in this review, a few tumor suppressors have been cloned and characterized, and many more have been recognized indirectly. The general finding at this time is that the same tumor suppressors (and oncogenes) are found associated with many different tumors, that several different altered genes are found typically in the same tumors, and that other oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes seem to be characteristically altered in particular tumor types as well. Functions of tumor suppressor genes include the control of normal cell activities such as proliferation and differentiation as well as senescence, which is a special kind of differentiation in which cells lose their ability to divide. The genetic basis of senescence and identification of genes involved in overcoming senescence, leading to immortalization (i.e., indefinite growth potential), are important areas of current investigation. Our laboratory is engaged in senescence/immortalization studies as a result of our discovery that normal human mammary epithelial cells can be immortalized by DNA of the human papilloma virus. These new studies are summarized here.\r"

With the advent of new techniques in cytogenetics and in the molecular analysis of DNA extracted from lung tumors, it has now become possible to test this hypothesis and to search for candidate genes that may be targeted by the chronic exposure of these environmental insults. Early work in this field, studying lung tumors of different histologic types, appears to implicate several distinct chromosomal loci (at chromosomes 3p, 13q, 17p, and others), suggesting that sequential genetic events occur during the initiation and progression pathways to pulmonary tumorigenesis. Identifying the candidate gene products and understanding the chronology and stringency of mutational events at these loci will be an essential goal to understanding the cellular basis of lung tumors and for developing strategies for the next generation of diagnostic and therapeutic studies.\r"

However, pp60c-srcN is expressed only in highly differentiated neuroblastomas.

  ".W": "The differentiation of adipose precursor cells can be divided into early and late events. Growth arrest at the G1/S boundary triggers the activation of early genes, i.e., pOb24 and lipoprotein lipase; the expression of both genes is primarily regulated at a transcriptional level. The expression of late markers, which lead to terminal differentiation and accumulation of neutral lipids, takes place after a limited number of mitoses of early-marker-expressing cells. Only terminal differentiation requires the presence of growth hormone and triiodothyronine as obligatory hormones and insulin as a modulating hormone, and results in the formation of triacylglycerol-filled, non-dividing cells. It appears that terminal differentiation involves the cyclic AMP pathway, the diacylglycerol pathway, and a third pathway triggered by insulinlike growth factor-I and insulin. It is thus proposed that a combination of mitogenic-adipogenic signals is required to trigger terminal differentiation of preadipose cells.\r"

This highly differentiated cell is induced to proliferate in lungs of animals of all ages during various forms of growth and during the repair process after lung injury. Using type 2 (T2) cells isolated from adult and neonatal rat lungs and an SV40-T transfected T2 cell line, we have shown tha growth-arrested T2 cells constitutively express genes associated with G1 and S phase of the cell cycle, yet they do not efficiently translate the proteins encoded by these genes. This block of growth-related gene expression is post-transcriptional and appears to involve mechanisms that control translation, perhaps at the level of initiation. Furthermore, growth-arrested T2 cells initiate DNA synthesis; however, the cells do not complete the cell cycle, suggesting that they are arrested in a late stage, perhaps the G1/S border. Differential screening of a cDNA library of growth-arrested T2 cells with DNA from growing and growth-arrested T2 cells has identified four families of genes preferentially expressed in the growth-arrested cells. These genes, which are in the process of being characterized, may be responsible for the unusual type of growth arrest demonstrated by T2 cells.\r"

  ".U": "91069064\r", 
  ".W": "Investigations of the pathways regulating normal growth of epithelial cells have revealed the existence of two major growth-factor signaling cascades required for proliferation. One pathway is activated by IGF-1 or high insulin concentration. The other is triggered by EGF, TGF alpha, or members of the FGF family, including the recently discovered epithelial-cell-specific growth factor, designated keratinocyte growth factor (KGF). Its expression pattern in vivo suggests that KGF plays an important normal physiologic role as a stromal effector of epithelial cell proliferation. Oncogenes, which represent constitutively activated forms of genes critically involved in growth-factor signaling pathways, specifically abrogate the requirement for mitogens of the EGF pathway. Examples of such genes include the erbB/EGF receptor and erbB-2, which encode structurally related receptor proteins and are often amplified and/or overexpressed in epithelial malignancies. Employing reduced stringency hybridization with v-erbB as a probe, we recently identified a third member of this receptor family, designated erbB-3. cDNA cloning revealed a predicted 148-kD transmembrane polypeptide with structural features similar to those of the EGF receptor. Normal erbB-3 expression in keratinocytes and glandular epithelium suggests its physiologic role in these cell types. Moreover, markedly elevated erbB-3 mRNA levels in certain mammary tumor cell lines suggest that increased erbB-3 expression may also play a role in some human epithelial malignancies.\r"

DESIGN: A questionnaire survey of a random sample of members of the College. PARTICIPANTS: Members (2254) of the College were surveyed; 1446 (64%) responded and 1290 (57%) of the responses were usable. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: More than 80% of respondents were satisfied with their relationships with patients, professional challenges, and opportunities to interact with colleagues. Only about half were satisfied with their potential income, and most were dissatisfied with their autonomy or loss of control over clinical decision making. Major sources of concern were administrative burdens, the threat of malpractice litigation, loss of income, and loss of clinical autonomy. Forty percent of internists say that they discourage students from careers in internal medicine, and only 39% would once again pursue such a career. \"Pain in the practice\" seems generalized among internists: logistic regression analysis failed to show any specific groups who were most dissatisfied or concerned. With regard to access, 18% of internists had many patients without health care insurance; 69% had some patients without coverage; and the majority (61%) had some patients who lost their insurance because of changing jobs or location. Assuring universal access to care received the highest priority rating of a set of criteria for health care reform. CONCLUSIONS: There is growing dissatisfaction with the practice of internal medicine, primarily related to concerns over loss of clinical autonomy, the increase in administrative burdens, the potential loss of income, and the threat of malpractice litigation. Although physicians are concerned about patients' access to care, proposals to improve access should be examined for their effects on the major sources of physicians' dissatisfaction with practice.\r"

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Most men and women selecting internal medicine (n = 1931) as well as those switching from earlier preferences for internal medicine (n = 1606) made their final decisions about specialty during the third and fourth years of medical school. Almost 50% of students planning to be internists cited \"intellectual content\" as the most important factor in their choice of specialty. \"Diagnostic challenge\" was next most frequently cited. \"Type of patient seen\" and \"role models\" were more frequently cited as the most important factors in specialty choice for all other specialties than for internal medicine. Students who switched away from earlier preferences for general internal medicine cited the following most important factors in descending order of frequency: \"too demanding of time and effort,\" \"inconsistent with personality,\" \"negative clerkship experiences,\" \"don't like the type of patient,\" and \"specialty chosen more fulfilling.\" The same five factors, in a different order of frequency, were given for switching from the subspecialties of internal medicine. CONCLUSIONS: Most medical students make their final choices about specialty during or after their clerkship year. Knowledge of these students' attitudes toward internal medicine could form the basis for the development of strategies to enhance the attractiveness of internal medicine among these students while they are making their final decisions about specialty.\r"

DESIGN: Cross-sectional, self-administered questionnaire survey conducted in 1989. PARTICIPANTS: All senior internal medicine and family medicine residents in ten geographically representative states who were identified through the 1986 National Residency Matching Program. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Seventy-four percent of residents reported that patients with AIDS accounted for 5% or more of general medicine admissions, and 50% of residents reported that they were currently following one or more human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients in their continuity clinics. Among residents who had provided ambulatory care to patients with AIDS, 77% felt that it was an excellent educational experience, and among those who planned to do general primary care in their future practices, 74% planned on providing primary care to patients with AIDS. However, 61% expressed concerns about the adequacy of their training in AIDS ambulatory care. A greater amount of contact with outpatients who had AIDS, but not with inpatients who had AIDS, was associated with residents' intending to provide AIDS primary care in their future practices. Among all residents, 23% reported that, if given a choice, they would not provide care to any patients with AIDS, and 23% reported that they would not work in an area with a high prevalence of AIDS because of concern about contracting the syndrome. Nine percent of residents reported that they had been exposed to a blood-contaminated needlestick from an HIV-seropositive patient. CONCLUSIONS: Although most residents have substantial contact with inpatients and outpatients with AIDS, most still find their education in AIDS ambulatory care to be deficient. A minority of residents would prefer not to care for patients with AIDS. Residency curricula should include training and experience in ambulatory AIDS care, explicitly address negative attitudes toward caring for patients with AIDS, and include programs to reduce needlestick exposures.\r"

DESIGN: Performance on items that were common to four pairs of the 1983 to 1988 certifying examinations (1983 and 1985, 1984 and 1986, 1985 and 1987, and 1986 and 1988) was analyzed. RESULTS: The scores of graduates of U.S. medical schools decreased, and the scores of non-U.S. citizens who graduated from foreign medical schools increased. Trends in the performance of graduates of Canadian and osteopathic medical schools and of U.S. citizens who graduated from foreign medical schools were not discernible. CONCLUSIONS: The cumulative decline in the performance of graduates from U.S. medical schools and the progressive improvement in the performance of non-U.S. citizens who graduated from foreign medical schools may ultimately manifest itself in patient care.\r"

CONCLUSIONS: The number of internists entering subspecialty training has risen at a considerably slower rate in the last 5 years compared with the 5 years before that. The length of subspecialty training has increased significantly since 1976. There has been a shift in subspecialty choice from hematology to oncology and toward joint programs offering both subspecialties.\r"

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of all 127 U.S. medical schools based on telephone interviews and review of faculty handbooks. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Ninety-three percent of medical schools responded. Twenty-two percent of medical schools have no written guidelines for maternity leave, 45% categorize maternity leave as a form of sick or disability leave, and only 34% have developed specific policies. Most schools (61%) require that maternity leave be taken from allotted sick days or from vacation days (or from both) for women to obtain salary support. The time available from sick and vacation leave averages 6.8 weeks. Although 72% of schools make allowances in the tenure probationary period for extended leaves of absence, few have developed specific provisions for childbearing or childrearing. Finally, 18% of medical schools have child care facilities. CONCLUSIONS: Considerable work is needed to develop adequate support for faculty members who are parents. Recommendations include developing specific parental leave policies and flexible tenure systems and providing adequate child care facilities.\r"

DESIGN: Mail survey. SETTING AND SUBJECTS: A sample of 2610 members and fellows of the American College of Physicians (ACP) participated in the study. They engaged in patient care activities more than 20 hours per week and were stratified by gender and region. They lived in four geographic areas of the United States (Northeast, Southeast, Central, and West), comprising 21 ACP regions. MEASUREMENTS: A questionnaire requesting background information as well as information about personal health; record keeping; use of immunizations (pneumococcal, influenza, tetanus, hepatitis B); use of screening tests and procedures for detecting cancer (breast examination, Papanicolaou smear, stool occult blood test) and other diseases (electrocardiograms, cholesterol level tests, chest radiographs); and behavioral counseling to promote health (in the areas of smoking, exercise, and alcohol and seat belt use). MAIN RESULTS: Internists used effective preventive interventions less frequently and ineffective practices more frequently than experts recommend. Internists' use of health promotion and disease prevention activities is associated with habit, attitude, and a lack of adequate knowledge. Younger physician age, general internal medicine practice, and personal health promotion and disease prevention practices were strongly associated with more appropriate use of recommended practices (P less than 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Internists' use of disease prevention and health promotion activities falls short of expert recommendations. Programs to improve the delivery of preventive services might be aimed at improving physicians' personal health practices, might be directed toward patients, and might include the development of effective systems to remind physicians.\r"

DESIGN: A random stratified sample of members and fellows of the American College of Physicians in 21 regions selected to represent all areas of the United States. Because of the relatively small proportion of women in this group, they were oversampled. SETTING: Physicians' practices. PARTICIPANTS: One thousand three hundred and forty-nine internists (members or fellows of the College) returned questionnaires, for a response rate of 75%; 52% defined themselves as general internists. INTERVENTIONS: A questionnaire was used to obtain information on internists' use of cigarettes, alcohol, and seat belts and their level of physical activity. Data were obtained on the indications used for counseling and the aggressiveness of counseling about each of these four habits. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Bivariate and logistic regression analyses were used to compare the tendencies of internist subgroups both in using various indications for counseling and in the thoroughness of counseling. Generalists were more likely than specialists to counsel at least once all patients who were at risk and to be more aggressive in counseling. Ninety percent of respondents counseled all of their patients who smoked, but 64.5% never discussed the use of seat belts. Only 3.8% of these internists currently smoked cigarettes, 11.3% drank alcohol daily, 38.7% were extremely or quite active, and 87.3% used seat belts all or most of the time. Among men internists, for every habit except alcohol use, personal health practices were substantially associated with counseling patients; for example, nonsmoking internists were more likely to counsel smokers, and very physically active internists were more likely to counsel about exercise. Among women internists, being very physically active was associated with counseling more patients about exercise and alcohol use. CONCLUSIONS: The low level of self-reported counseling among these internists suggests that further emphasis on training in these skills is needed. The association between personal and professional practices suggests that medical schools and housestaff training programs should support health promotion activities for future internists.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the factors that attract students toward and push students away from a career in internal medicine. DESIGN: National survey of senior U.S. medical students using a stratified random cluster sampling of medical schools. PARTICIPANTS: The survey included 1650 U.S. senior students from 16 medical schools, of whom 1244 (76%) responded. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A survey instrument was developed and pilot tested at 17 medical schools. Twenty-four percent of the respondents to the final survey chose a career in general internal medicine (9%) or subspecialty internal medicine (15%). A career in internal medicine had been \"seriously considered\" by 608 respondents (50%) who finally chose a career other than internal medicine (the \"switchers\"). Compared with other specialties, internal medicine was perceived as being more stressful to residents, more demanding of time and workload as a career and a residency, and as an easier residency to enter. Internal medicine was also seen as providing less satisfaction for residents, having lower income potential, and allowing less leisure time. For the 608 switchers, the most important influences leading to their decision to switch were the type of patient seen in internal medicine (for example, chronically ill, alcohol and drug abusing patients) as well as dissatisfaction and stress among internal medicine residents. Factor analysis showed that three factors, \"intellectual challenge of internal medicine,\" \"primary care interests,\" and \"the medicine clerkship\" attracted students toward internal medicine, whereas three others, \"taking care of chronically ill patients,\" \"level of satisfaction among internists and medical residents,\" and \"workload and stress\" pushed students away from internal medicine. Factors pushing students away from internal medicine were significantly more negative with regard to a career in general as opposed to subspecialty internal medicine (P less than 0.001). CONCLUSION: Medical students have serious reservations about internal medicine as a career choice. Perceptions about the medical residency, the patients they expect to see, and the dissatisfaction among residents and internists are foremost in their thinking. Changes to improve the attractiveness of internal medicine should address these adverse perceptions while building on the positive influences identified by the respondents.\r"

Whether that change will be in directions desired by internists will depend on whether effective leadership of the discipline is accepted by the academic department chairs. Individually, and as a group, they are the only ones with sufficient authority to take control and initiate and sustain needed change. The time frame for action is short and diminishing. Opportunities still exist for effective leadership to present the discipline as more attractive to students by demonstrating that they can play an important role in helping to solve problems in health care. Unmet societal needs underlie much of the public's disaffection with the profession, and the chairpersons must begin to solve those needs. Today's practice environment is ever less appealing with increasing regulation and intrusive third-party actions. These stresses will increase until internists understand from research the value of what they do in practice and learn to choose what is effective in outcome and cost. Practice models integrating the skills and talents of internists, as these are focused on the needs of patients, are experiments that can be started in academic departments. Initiatives for such changes depend on active leadership--now sorely lacking in internal medicine.\r"

The latter are functioning increasingly as categorical disease centers, such as cardiac or cancer centers, which involve subspecialists from several departments. These new \"horizontal\" organizational units are thought to enhance the effectiveness of patient care as well as the generation of resources, especially for research and training. However, subspecialists operating outside of the framework of training, accreditation, and standards established by internal medicine are at risk for being less effective in dealing with the \"whole\" patient. Further, the critical evaluation of clinical practices of subspecialists is greatly needed and is far more likely to be accomplished effectively within departments of internal medicine than in categorical disease centers. Therefore, although some strengthening of the new horizontal organizational units now seems appropriate, this process must not be allowed to erode the important integrating structure provided by internal medicine.\r"
