  ".W": "Neutralizing antibodies (NAs) against four isolates of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) were assayed in HIV-1 antibody positive sera from the United States, Haiti, Zimbabwe, and Zaire. Overall, there were NAs detected in 95, 81, 60, and 73% of sera with reciprocal geometric mean titers (GMTs) of 626, 23, 10, and 20, respectively, against HIV-1MN, HIV-1IIIB, HIV-1RF, and HIV-1Z3. Sera from North America had significantly higher NA titers against HIV-1MN. In each country, the highest antibody titers observed were against the MN strain. Otherwise, sera from the U.S. neutralized most strongly HIV-1IIIB, sera from Zaire neutralized most strongly HIV-1Z3, and sera from Zimbabwe had equal titers against all three viruses. The differences between countries were reflected in analyses of NA titers of subgroups classified on the basis of clinical status, indicating that the differences were not likely to be related to differences in clinical status of the patients being tested. Some of this antigenic variation is reflective of known genetic diversity, while some is not. The results suggest that undefined preserved and variable regions containing neutralization epitope(s) exist. These data do not indicate a need to define antigenic subtypes of HIV-1 at present. The existence of conserved neutralization epitope(s) may indicate the potential for broad immunogenicity of appropriately selected vaccine antigens.\r"

This antianalgesic effect of dyn A was eliminated by 3 or 5.5 hr pretreatment s.c. with 10 or 100 mg/kg of morphine, respectively. This desensitization lasted for about 18 hr. Three-hour pretreatment intrathecally with dyn A also desensitized the mice to dyn A. Previously we had shown that i.c.v. administration of morphine simultaneously activates analgesic and antianalgesic systems and the latter is mediated spinally by dyn A, an endogenous antianalgesic opioid. Present results are consistent with that concept and systemic pretreatment with morphine may release dyn A in the spinal cord to produce the desensitization to the subsequently elicited antianalgesic action of dyn A.\r"

In a mouse model of pain (acetylcholine abdominal constriction), bromfenac showed a rapid onset of activity (20 min) that persisted for at least 4 hr. In a rat model of inflammation (carrageenan foot edema), a single oral dose of bromfenac, 0.316 mg/kg, produced significant anti-inflammatory activity up to 24 hr after dosing. Bromfenac was readily absorbed after oral administration, peak plasma levels being achieved at the earliest time tested: 20 min in the mouse and 30 min in the rat. The plasma half-life of bromfenac in rats is less than 4 hr. Since the anti-inflammatory activity persisted for 20 to 24 hr in spite of its short plasma half-life, it appears that there is no direct correlation between duration of activity and plasma drug level.\r"

  ".W": "5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) depolarized 87% of the rat dorsal root ganglion cells recorded. 5-HT increased the input resistance (Rin) in 50%, decreased Rin in 41% and produced both responses in 9% of the responding cells. When 5-HT increased the Rin, the response was mimicked by the 5-HT2 agonists alpha-methyl-5-HT, (+/-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4 iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane HCl, quipazine and MK 212 (6-chloro-1-[1-piperazinyl]-pyrazine), but not by 2-methyl-5-HT or carboxamidotryptamine. The response to 5-HT was antagonized by ketanserin, spiperone and methiothepin. The unsurmountable blockade induced by higher concentrations of ketanserin was not explained by pseudo-irreversible antagonism or multiple receptor subtypes, but could result from a two-state receptor model or multiple subtypes of the 5-HT2 receptor. This conclusion is supported by the partial agonist action of DOI. Cells responding to 5-HT with depolarization and decreased Rin responded similarly to 2-methyl-5-HT and phenylbiguanide, but not to alpha-methyl-5-HT or carboxyamidotryptamine. This response was surmountably blocked by ICS 205-930 (3-tropanyl-indole-3-carboxylate) (pA2 = 10.3) and MDL 72222 (3-tropanyl-3,5-dichlorobenzoate)(pA2 = 7.8). The arylpiperazines, quipazine and MK 212, antagonized the action of 2-methyl-5-HT with IC50 values of 8 and 4 nM, respectively. These data indicate that 5-HT2 receptors mediate the increased Rin and 5-HT3 receptors mediate the decreased Rin.\r"

Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein in plasma was slightly increased and the free fraction of propranolol was slightly decreased in the 24-month-old rats. For the four drugs studied, the volume of distribution and the clearance were decreased in the older rats. For propranolol, metoprolol and antipyrine these decreases were already observed in 12-month-old rats, for atenolol only in the 24-month-old rats. There was no change in half-life as a function of age for the three beta blockers; for antipyrine a significant increase in half-life was seen. The decreased volume of distribution suggests a lower tissue binding or a decrease in total body fluid. The change in clearance in function of age can probably be explained for metoprolol and propranolol by a decrease in hepatic blood flow as no change in metabolism or protein binding occurs, for atenolol by a decrease in renal function and for antipyrine by a decrease in metabolism. After p.o. administration of the beta blockers, no significant increase in area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve was observed for propranolol and metoprolol as a function of age, but for atenolol, a significant increase in area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve was seen in the 24-month-old rats, due to a decrease in renal function, as bioavailability of atenolol did not change in function of age.\r"

  ".W": "The C-terminal fragment of human calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), hCGRP8-37, fails to induce any biological activity in a variety of isolated tissues and behavioral assays even though it possesses nanomolar affinity for [125I]hCGRP alpha binding sites in the central nervous system and peripheral membrane preparations. However, hCGRP8-37 displays relatively potent, competitive antagonist properties toward the action of native hCGRP alpha in guinea pig atrial and ileal preparations and on the central nervous system-mediated inhibition of CGRP on food intake. On the contrary, in the rat vas deferens the antagonistic potency of hCGRP8-37 was much weaker and was ineffective against CGRP-induced hyperthermia after i.c.v. injection. Such evidence suggests the existence of at least two classes of CGRP receptors, the first (CGRP1) being sensitive to the antagonist properties of hCGRP8-37, whereas the second (CGRP2) is not. The use of hCGRP8-37 should greatly facilitate the characterization of the physiological roles of CGRP-like peptides, especially those which are mediated via the activation of CGRP1 receptors.\r"

Overall, both compounds are of a similar potency and efficacy. BY 1023/SK&F 96022 exhibited a somewhat longer duration of the antisecretory action than omeprazole in the Ghosh-Schild rat. In the modified Shay rat, on the basis of equieffective doses in terms of the initial effect, both compounds had a comparable duration of action. However, the p.o./i.v. dose ratio upon acute administration was larger for omeprazole, possibly reflecting its lower stability in the acidic environment of the secreting stomach, compared to BY 1023/SK&F 96022. As in vivo, both compounds were equipotent to inhibit acid production in rabbit isolated fundic glands. However, omeprazole interacted with the 7-ethoxycoumarin dealkylase in vitro with high affinity (Ki = 38.5 mumol/l), in contrast to BY 1023/SK&F 96022 (Ki = 135 mumol/l). Compared to omeprazole, BY 1023/SK&F 96022 also showed less interaction with the cytochrome P450 enzyme hydroxylating ionazolac. Moreover, this difference between the two compounds was also found in the rat in vivo with respect to their interaction with diazepam. Thus, both compounds displayed a comparable antisecretory potency in vivo and in vitro but showed a different interference with cytochrome P450 in favor of less interaction by BY 1023/SK&F 96022.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of acetylethylcholine mustard (Aech-M) on the muscarinic receptor coupled adenylate cyclase system of intact GH3 cells were investigated. The concentration of Aech-M and Ach that inhibited specific [3H]N-methylscopolamine binding by 50% was similar for both compounds (9.3 microM for Ach and 10.7 microM for Aech-M). Pretreatment of intact GH3 cells or isolated membranes with 10 to 50 microM Aech-M, followed by washing, reduced the [3H]N-methylscopolamine binding capacity by 60% and 75-77%, respectively, without changing the KD value for the radioligand to the remaining receptors. Both Aech-M and Ach attenuated forskolin (1 microM) stimulated cAMP formation with half-maximal effects (EC50) occurring at 0.84 microM for Ach and 0.24 microM for Aech-M. The maximal inhibition was 70-80% for Ach and 30-40% for Aech-M. However, the dose-response for Aech-M was biphasic such that at high concentrations (greater than 50 microM) there was a reduction in its ability to attenuate cAMP formation. After 3 min incubation with either Ach or Aech-M, the addition of atropine completely reversed their inhibitory effect even though with Aech-M there was a greater than 50% reduction in receptor capacity. Furthermore, over a 12-min incubation, Ach produced a relatively stable 67-76% reduction in cAMP accumulation, whereas with Aech-M the initial attenuation was gradually reduced such that by 10 min of incubation, no effect was observed. Finally, pretreatment with Aech-M resulted in a reduced sensitivity to the action of Ach as the EC50 values for inhibition of cAMP accumulation were increased 7.6- and 13.5-fold, respectively, with little or no change in the maximal response. The data indicate that Aech-M produces a transient agonist effect to attenuate cAMP formation in intact GH3 cells followed by an antagonist action probably after irreversible binding to the receptor.\r"

Single ventricular cells were prepared by the collagenase dispersion procedure, and membrane currents were recorded with a patch electrode by use of the whole-cell voltage clamp method. ICa was obtained by intra- and extracellular perfusion with the Cs(+)-solutions that suppressed potassium currents. IK was evaluated in Co+(+)-Tyrode's solution in which 0.9 mM Co+(+) was substituted for equimolar Ca+(+) to abolish ICa. Isoproterenol, a nonselective beta adrenoceptor agonist, increased not only ICa but also IK at the same threshold concentration (1 nM). In contrast, the threshold concentration of T-1583, a selective beta-1 adrenoceptor agonist, for increasing ICa (1 nM) was distinctly lower than that for increasing IK (100 nM). These results suggest that ICa and IK can be differentially modulated by beta adrenoceptors.\r"

  ".U": "90308699\r", 
  ".W": "Acute treatment with the centrally active beta-2 adrenergic agonist clenbuterol reduced response rate and increased reinforcement rate of rats responding under a differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate (DRL) 72-sec schedule in a dose-dependent manner (ED50 value of about 0.1 mg/kg). With repeated treatment, rapid tolerance developed to this effect of clenbuterol. Redetermination of the dose-response function for clenbuterol, following 2 weeks of repeated daily administration, showed that clenbuterol no longer affected DRL behavior at doses up to 3 mg/kg. Interestingly, tolerance developed to clenbuterol even when it was administered after each daily session. This suggests that behavioral factors did not contribute, in an appreciable manner, to the development of tolerance to clenbuterol, and that neuropharmacological changes were sufficient for tolerance development. Such an interpretation is supported by the finding that the density of beta-2 adrenergic receptors in the cerebral cortices and cerebella of rats receiving the same repeated-treatment regimen was reduced with a time course similar to the loss of behavioral responsiveness. The effects of two additional beta-2 selective agonists, SOM-1122 and zinterol, on DRL behavior also were attenuated after repeated treatment with clenbuterol. By contrast, the effects of the beta-1 selective agonists dobutamine and prenalterol and the antidepressants desipramine, phenelzine and fluoxetine on DRL behavior were unaltered after repeated treatment with clenbuterol. These findings suggest functional independence of the beta adrenergic receptor subtypes and further suggest that, consistent with neuropharmacological data, the behavioral effects of the antidepressants do not depend on functionally responsive beta-2 adrenergic receptors.\r"

  ".W": "A study was made of the isometric responses of isolated canine thoracic ducts to several physiological vasoactive substances. Contractions of the lymphatic smooth muscles were induced by epinephrine, norepinephrine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, histamine (HIS) and prostaglandin F2 alpha in a dose-dependent manner. The decreasing order of potency in the contractile responses was as follows: epinephrine greater than norepinephrine greater than 5-hydroxytryptamine much greater than HIS not equal to prostaglandin F2 alpha. There were no significant regional differences in the responses to vasoconstrictive agents. Phenylephrine, xylazine and clonidine caused a dose-dependent contraction in the lymphatic preparations. Prazosin (10(-8) to 10(-7) M) inhibited the phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction in a competitive manner. Xylazine-induced responses were inhibited competitively by yohimbine (10(-8) to 10(-7) M). These results suggest that both alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors are located on the lymphatic smooth muscles of canine thoracic ducts. On the other hand, acetylcholine, isoproterenol, HIS, adenosine and ATP caused dose-dependent relaxations in canine thoracic ducts precontracted by 10(-5) M norepinephrine. The decreasing order of potency in the relaxant responses was as follows: acetylcholine much greater than isoproterenol much greater than adenosine not equal to HIS not equal to ATP. There were no significant regional differences in the relaxant responses to the agents. Procaterol, salbutamol, dobutamine and denopamine caused a dose-dependent relaxation of isolated canine thoracic ducts. Propranolol (10(-9) to 10(-8) M) inhibited procaterol- and dobutamine-induced vasorelaxations in a competitive manner. Metoprolol (10(-8) to 10(-7) M) inhibited only the dobutamine-induced vasorelaxation, but did not significantly influence the procaterol-induced response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The present study was conducted to determine if treatments initiated at different prepubertal ages would be equally effective in delaying sexual maturation and if changes in prepubertal hormone secretion accompanied the delay. Treatments with THC (10 mg/kg) or vehicle were initiated at 24, 27 or 30 days of age and continued until first estrus was detected by vaginal smears. In one experiment, serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and prolactin (PRL) were measured at 24, 27 or 30 days of age after different durations of treatment. First estrus was delayed (4.8 +/- 1.1 days) when THC treatment started at 27 days of age, but not when treatment started at 24 or 30 days of age. Serum LH was reduced after 1 or 4, but not 7, days of treatment; however, LH suppression was associated with pubertal delay only when it occurred at 27 to 30 days of age. Serum PRL, which increased with age, was suppressed after 1 day of THC treatment at 27 or 30 days of age, but only the former was associated with delayed puberty. Suppression was not evident at 24 days of age after 1 day of THC, or at other ages after treatment for longer than 1 day. These results define a narrow interval, encompassing the ages of 27 to 30 days, during which THC exposure resulted in pubertal delay. Such treatment reduced serum LH and PRL levels, but reductions also occurred with treatments that did not result in maturational delay. The relationship of hormone suppression to the delay thus remains unclear, although the timing of suppression might be a factor.\r"

DuP 697 had no effect on phenylquinone writhing in rats (ED50 greater than 100 mg/kg), but was analgetic against inflammation-related pain in the Randall-Selitto assay (ED30 = 3.5 mg/kg) and was a very potent antipyretic agent (ED50 = 0.05 mg/kg). The drug was not ulcerogenic in rats at single doses up to 400 mg/kg. DuP 697 (5 mg/kg i.v.) did not alter renal blood flow or the renal vascular response to angiotensin II in furosemide-pretreated, volume-depleted rats. In contrast, indomethacin (5 mg/kg i.v.) decreased renal blood flow and potentiated the renal vascular response to angiotensin II in these animals. DuP 697 was a moderate inhibitor of bull seminal vesicle prostaglandin (PG) synthesis (IC50 = 2.4 X 10(-5) M) and a potent inhibitor of rat brain PG synthesis (IC50 = 4.5 X 10(-6) M) but was ineffective against rat kidney PG synthesis (IC50 7.5 X 10(-5) M). These differential effects of DuP 697 on PG synthesis by various tissues may account for its high potency as an anti-inflammatory and antipyretic agent and its minimal toxicity profile.\r"

  ".W": "Aminoglycoside antibiotics cause phospholipid accumulation in the kidney proximal tubule cell by inhibiting phospholipid catabolism in lysosomes. To evaluate the mechanism of inhibition, we purified lysosomal phospholipase A1 from rat kidney and examined the effects of gentamicin and tobramycin on the hydrolysis of di-[1-14C]oleoylphosphatidylcholine alone or in the presence of unlabeled phosphatidylinositol. Gentamicin and tobramycin were weak inhibitors of phospholipase A1 action with dioleoylphosphatidylcholine as substrate; the amount of drug required to reduce hydrolysis by 50% was greater than 10 mM. However, when unlabeled phosphatidylinositol was present in the liposome, gentamicin and tobramycin caused 50% inhibition at 0.03 or 0.01 mM, respectively, a decrease of more than three orders of magnitude. When the concentration of phosphatidylinositol-containing vesicles was increased, inhibition by aminoglycosides could be overcome. The results are consistent with the previously demonstrated ability of gentamicin and tobramycin to bind to liposomes containing negatively charged phospholipids which, in turn, may interfere with phospholipase A1 degradation of phosphatidylcholine. Inhibition by the substrate depletion mechanism has been reported previously with lipocortin/calpactin where binding of these proteins to the surface of substrate vesicles results in a substrate depletion type of inhibition. The mechanism of aminoglycoside inhibition of phospholipase A1 appears to be a variant of this phenomenon in which the polycationic drugs bind to phosphatidylinositol, a nonmetabolized component of substrate vesicle, preventing productive interaction of the enzyme with the phosphatidylcholine substrate.\r"

  ".W": "This article describes the novel pharmacological activity of MDL 28,753, a compound designed as a potential receptor antagonist of the peptidoleukotrienes. In the isolated longitudinal muscle of the guinea pig ileum, MDL 28,753 was a full agonist at the leukotriene (LT) D4 receptor and had a pD2 of 8.9 compared with a pD2 of 9.2 for LTD4. The contraction induced by MDL 28,753 was antagonized in a competitive manner by known LTD4 receptor antagonists, FPL 55,712 (pA2 = 7.3) and ICI 198615, and the peptidoleukotriene receptor antagonist, MDL 43,291 (pA2 = 6.7). However, under conditions in which the LTD4 receptors, but not the LTC4 receptors, were selectively inhibited by ICI 198615, MDL 28,753 showed no agonist activity at the LTC4 receptor. Instead, it competitively antagonized the agonist activity of LTC4 (pA2 = 6.1) in the longitudinal muscle of the guinea pig. Interestingly, under the same conditions, LTD4 also antagonized the agonist activity of LTC4. The functional difference of activity at these receptors supplies additional evidence for multiple receptors for the peptidoleukotrienes in guinea pig tissues. The unexpected lack of agonist action and unexpected antagonist activity of LTD4 at the LTC4 receptor suggests that the third carboxyl group in LTC4 is a critical binding requirement for agonist activity at the LTC4 receptor in guinea pigs.\r"

In isolated tissues, YM-16151-1 produced a competitive antagonism of CaCl2-induced contraction in the isolated rabbit aorta with a pKca-1 value of 8.17, and also produced a competitive antagonism of isoproterenol-induced positive chronotropic responses in the isolated rat atria with a pA2 value of 8.47.

Calcium entry blocking activity of YM-16151-1 was 7 times weaker and 3 times greater than nifedipine and diltiazem, respectively. Beta-1 adrenoceptor blocking activity of YM-16151-1 was 2 times weaker than that of propranolol. YM-16151-1 showed about 900-fold selectivity for beta-1 adrenoceptor. YM-16151-1 also showed a weak alpha-1 adrenoceptor blocking activity and its potency was about 13 times weaker than that of phentolamine. S-(-)- and R-(+)-isomers of YM-16151-1 showed the same potency of calcium entry blocking activity. However, in beta-1 adrenoceptor blocking activity, the S-(-)-enantiomer was about 13 to 22 times more potent than the R-(+)-enantiomer.

Despite profound and prolonged loss of serotonin innervation, long-term behavioral effects of MDMA have not previously been reported. In this study, we monitored the short- and long-term effects of MDMA administration on the ultrasonic isolation call of the rat pup. At 30 to 60 min after a single dose of MDMA (0.5-10.0 mg/kg), isolation calls decreased as much as 90%, with a rebound increase in calling noted 10 to 25 h following administration of the highest dose. Repeated administration of 10 mg/kg MDMA (once or twice daily on postnatal days 1-4) resulted in a lasting, dose-dependent decrease in ultrasonic vocalization monitored on days 6, 9, 12 and 15. Concurrent measures of locomotor behavior, geotaxis and weight gain were not altered subsequent to repeated MDMA treatment. Both serotonin content and serotonin terminals (assessed by [3H]paroxetine binding) in cortex were reduced by repeated MDMA treatment, whereas concentrations of catecholamines and their metabolites were unaltered. Repeated prenatal MDMA exposure did not affect postnatal rates of calling or the biochemical markers of serotonin in cortex. Pups lesioned with MDMA postnatally showed not only long-term behavioral and biochemical changes but also altered responsiveness to the serotonin 1B agonist 1-[3-(trifluromethyl)phenyl]piperazine. Taken together, these studies indicate that serotonergic lesions in a sensitive phase of development can have long-term selective effects on the rat pup ultrasonic isolation call, a behavior critical for mother-infant affiliation.\r"

Blockade of beta adrenoceptors with propranolol did not alter the response to (-)-epinephrine nor did i.a. isoproterenol produce a significant vasodilation. Vasoconstrictor responses elicited by (-)-epinephrine and (-)-norepinephrine were antagonized by treatment with phentolamine (2.5 mg/kg i.v.) and by yohimbine (0.5 mg/kg i.v.) but were only marginally blocked by prazosin (0.1 mg/kg i.v.). A dose-related depression of cutaneous blood flow was also caused by clonidine at doses virtually identical to those of (-)-norepinephrine.

There is controversy, however, as to the existence of a functional link between the presynaptic receptors and the neuronal uptake carriers. An alternative hypothesis involves competition for the presynaptic receptor sites between the exogenous agonist and the released neurotransmitter. In order to examine the proposed functional interaction, we studied the alpha-2 adrenoceptor-mediated inhibition of the electrically evoked release of [3H]-5-HT from slices of the rat hypothalamus, a model in which endogenous NE does not activate the alpha-2 heteroreceptors located on 5-HT terminals. The inhibitors of 5-HT uptake, citalopram (0.01-1 microM) and paroxetine (1 microM), which by themselves did not modify [3H]-5-HT release, antagonized the inhibition of [3H]-5-HT overflow produced by UK 14.304, an alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist. The inhibition of the electrically evoked release of [3H]-5-HT by exogenous NE (0.1-1 microM) was also attenuated in the presence of citalopram. In contrast, citalopram did not modify the electrically evoked release of [3H]-NE or the inhibition of [3H]-NE release mediated by UK 14.304. When the 5-HT autoreceptor was blocked by cyanopindolol, the inhibitory effect of UK 14.304 on [3H]-5-HT release was unaltered in the presence of citalopram.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Effects were examined in squirrel monkeys responding under a schedule of shock titration. Under this procedure shock was scheduled to increase once every 15 sec from 0.01 to 3.7 mA in 30 steps. Five responses on a lever during the 15-sec shock period terminated the shock for 15 sec, after which the shock resumed at the next lower intensity. The intensity below which the monkeys maintained the shock 50% of the time (median shock level) was determined. l-Methadone and U50,488 produced dose-dependent increases in median shock level. Nalbuphine, butorphanol and levallorphan also increased median shock level, but these increases were much smaller than those observed with l-methadone or U50,488.

  ".W": "Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that serotonin (5-HT) elevates transferrin production by choroid plexus epithelial cells in primary culture in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion. The present study shows that 5-HT stimulates phosphoinositide hydrolysis in these cells and further demonstrates that the phosphoinositide hydrolysis response is mediated by the 5-HT1c receptor. To determine if the effect on transferrin is also mediated by the 5-HT1c receptor, the effects of 5-HT receptor agonists and antagonists were examined in choroid plexus epithelial cells in primary culture. The stereoisomers of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and the piperazine derivative 6-chloro-2-[1-piperazinyl]-piperazine (MK-212) were evaluated as potential agonists. MK-212 and (+)LSD mimicked 5-HT, increasing transferrin levels to the same extent. The levorotary isomer, (-)LSD, had no effect. This agonist profile agrees with that previously found for 5-HT1c receptor-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis. Three antagonists with varying potencies to block 5-HT1c receptor-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis were examined: ritanserin, mianserin and spiperone. The results of these studies were less clear-cut. Neither mianserin nor ritanserin significantly reduced the effects of 5-HT on transferrin, even though they markedly reduced 5-HT-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis. Consistent with its low potency at the 5-HT1c receptor, spiperone, a 5-HT2 and 5-HT1a antagonist, was a less effective antagonist of the phosphoinositide hydrolysis response than were ritanserin and mianserin. Spiperone also failed to block the effect of 5-HT on transferrin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Five adult, male White Carneaux pigeons were trained to respond under a titrating delayed matching-to-sample schedule of reinforcement. Under this schedule, the length of the delay was changed as a function of the pigeons' performances in a manner that resulted in approximately 80% accuracy in matching performance. During the first five trials of each session, the delay value was fixed at either 3 sec or 30 sec (starting delay). On the 6th and all subsequent trials, the length of the delay value was increased by a fixed amount (the titration step), did not change or was decreased by an amount equal to the titration step. Initially, the starting delay and the titration step were set at 3 sec. These values were then systematically changed to a starting delay of 30 and a titration step of 3, and finally, a starting delay of 3 and a titration step of 1. Using this procedure, the effects of pentobarbital (0.3-10 mg/kg), cocaine (0.01-10 mg/kg), d-amphetamine (0.003-3 mg/kg) and phencyclidine (0.03-3 mg/kg) were determined under the different titration parameters. Pentobarbital was shown to decrease matching performance at doses (3, 5.6 and 10 mg/kg) that did not decrease response rates. Phencyclidine produced a similar effect at a dose of 1 mg/kg under two of the three phases of the experiment. No such specific effects were observed with cocaine or d-amphetamine. Thus, of the four drugs studied, pentobarbital showed the most pronounced effect on matching performance. Whether this represents merely a loss of stimulus control or a specific effect on memory is yet to be determined. In addition, the results of these experiments clearly show that when the delay value is allowed to change as a function of the pigeons' performance, pigeons are able to perform at or above 80% accuracy at longer delay values than those generally reported using fixed-delay values.\r"

When bladder domes from 22 day and 22 to 24 month Fischer rats are compared, changes in composition include: a 25% decrease in percentage of protein [(milligrams of protein per milligram of wet weight) x 100]; an approximately 40% decrease in both the total phospholipid content and in the content of the major phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine; and a 69% increase in the cholesterol to phospholipid ratio. These changes are indicative of a more rigid lipid bilayer in the aged rat bladder. Changes in AC with aging include a decrease in basal and forskolin-activated AC and a loss of the ability of isoproterenol to activate AC in the aged (22-24 month) rat bladder dome homogenate. Activation by isoproterenol (ISO; 3 microM) is 55 and 72% over 5' guanylimidodiphosphate [Gpp(NH)p; 1 microM] controls in 22 day and 90 day rat bladder dome homogenates, respectively. Activation by AC by NaF and Gpp(NH)p does not decline with aging. Ethanol, an agent that increases membrane fluidity, stimulates AC to a much greater extent in homogenates from the 22 month than from the 22 day or 90 day rat bladder dome. The ethanol-induced activation occurs not only in basal AC but also in Gpp(NH)p- and ISO-plus Gpp(NH)p-activated AC. The observed changes in AC with aging in part may reflect changes in the membrane lipid environment.\r"

Norepinephrine caused a rapid increase in the glycerol level in adipose tissue (lipolysis index) that was further increased by the alpha adrenoreceptor blocker phentolamine. At 10(-11) mol/l of norepinephrine caused a 100% stimulation of lipolysis (P less than .025). In the presence of phentolamine the lipolytic effects of catecholamines at 10(-12) mol/l was isoproterenol greater than epinephrine greater than norepinephrine. All these three lipolytic catecholamines caused a transient increase in the adipose tissue dialysate glycerol level, which peaked after 20 to 30 min of catecholamine exposure and then declined. The apparent tachyphylaxia could not be overcome by a gradual increase of the catecholamine concentration from 10(-12) to 10(-8) mol/l. However, the selective alpha-2 adrenoreceptor agonist clonidine caused a continuous and dose-dependent decrease in the dialysate glycerol level; the minimum effective concentration was 10(-9) mol/l. In conclusion, catecholamines have a lipolytic effect in situ at much lower concentrations than those in the circulation. This effect is transient and is related to beta adrenoreceptors. In additio, catecholamines have alpha adrenoreceptor-mediated effects on lipolysis in situ.\r"

In this study, we evaluated the pulmonary vascular effects of L-arginine-HCl and its benzoyl derivative N-alpha-benzoyl-L-arginine ethyl ester (BAEE) in the rat, in comparison with other vasodilators such as acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside. In isolated pulmonary artery rings incubated with indomethacin (10 microM) and precontracted with phenylephrine (2 microM), BAEE (10(-6)-10(-5) M) significantly (P less than .05) relaxed the rings more than L-arginine. This effect was potentiated by the endothelium (P less than .05). The relaxing effect of BAEE (ED50 = 2.1 X 10(-6) M) and acetylcholine (ED50 = 2.4 X 10(-7) M) was significantly less potent than that of sodium nitroprusside (ED50 = 1.1 X 10(-8) M). Moreover, pretreatment with the soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitors methylene blue (10(-5) M) and hemoglobin (10(-5) M) antagonized BAEE-induced relaxation in intact pulmonary rings but had no effect on the relaxation elicited with atrial natriuretic peptide. In the isolated lung preparations perfused with the endoperoxide analog U46619 (5-10 nmol/min), sodium nitroprusside (10(-10)-10(-8) M) elicited potent vasodilation (ED50 = 2.8 X 10(-9) mol) whereas no vasodilation was observed with acetylcholine (10(-8)-10(-5) mol). BAEE (10(-6)-10(-5) M) decreased in a dose-dependent manner pulmonary perfusion pressure, and similar doses of L-arginine showed only a mild vasodilating effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This rightward shift in the dose-response curve, which was concentration and time dependent, was interpreted as desensitization of the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor-mediated inhibition of cyclic AMP production. The fact that no decrease in efficacy was observed appears to result from a receptor reserve. Agonist preincubation effects on subsequent p-aminoclonidine (an alpha-2 adrenergic partial agonist) inhibition and partial irreversible inactivation of receptors confirmed the presence of an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor reserve in HT29 cells. Desensitization appeared to have a heterologous component since inhibition of vasoactive intestinal peptide-stimulated cyclic AMP production by somatostatin was also attenuated. We also assessed the effect of alpha-2 agonist preincubation on subsequent 5-bromo-6-[2-imidazoline-2-yl-amino] quinoxaline inhibition of parathyroid hormone-stimulated cyclic AMP production in OK cells. As with HT29 cells, agonist preincubation resulted in a concentration- and time-dependent shift in the dose-response curve. In both cell lines, long-term preincubation with an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist resulted in a 40% decrease in subsequent [3H]yohimbine binding, indicating down-regulation of the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor.\r"

  ".U": "90308723\r", 
  ".W": "Aluminum, an abundant element in the earth's crust, has been implicated in various pathological disorders and low concentrations of this element have recently been shown to inhibit brain glycolysis. However, despite the fact that aluminum accumulates in high concentrations in the liver, potential effects of this metal on hepatic intermediary metabolism have not been explored. In perfused livers from untreated rats, maximal rates of production of lactate plus pyruvate (glycolysis) were 93 +/- 15 mumols/g/hr. Glycolysis was severely inhibited in livers from aluminum-treated rats (0.5 mg/kg, 6 hr before experiment) with maximal rates of only 23 +/- 4 mumols/g/hr. In contrast, glucose production (glycogenolysis) and hepatic oxygen uptake were not altered significantly by prior treatment with aluminum. In livers from fasted rats, pretreatment with aluminum did not influence gluconeogenesis or production of lactate and pyruvate from fructose (5 mM). This finding indicates that pyruvate kinase is not inhibited by aluminum and implicates phosphofructokinase, hexokinase and/or glucokinase as sites for the inhibitory effect of aluminum on glycolysis. In liver homogenates from untreated rats, increasing concentrations of aluminum did not show any appreciable effect on hexokinase or glucokinase activity but did cause progressive decreases in phosphofructokinase activity. Therefore, aluminum-induced inhibition of liver phosphofructokinase, an important control site in the glycolytic pathway, is most likely responsible for aluminum-induced inhibition of hepatic glycolysis.\r"

  ".W": "Cholinergic and nonadrenergic noncholinergic (NANC) excitatory nerves in guinea pig trachea are subject to presynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptor inhibitory control. Although the trachea is also innervated by NANC inhibitory nerves, little is known about their presynaptic regulation. The present study assessed the capacity of alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonists to modulate NANC inhibitory nerves and for comparison, cholinergic excitatory nerves in guinea pig trachea. To eliminate effects of intrinsic sympathetic nerve stimulation and prostanoid production, tissues were pretreated with guanethidine, propranolol and indomethacin. The alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine (1 microM), induced a 12-fold rightward shift of the frequency-response curve for neurally mediated cholinergic contractions but had no effect on the concentration-response curve for exogenously administered acetylcholine. This action of clonidine was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by the alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine, and by the alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin, NANC inhibitory responses were unaffected by clonidine (1 microM). The alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonist, phenylephrine (1 microM), failed to influence responses induced by cholinergic or NANC inhibitory nerve stimulation, acetylcholine or vasoactive intestinal peptide. Furthermore, in tissues treated with propranolol but not subjected to adrenergic neuronal blockade with guanethidine, neurally mediated cholinergic responses were not altered by yohimbine (0.3 microM) treatment. These results indicate that in guinea pig trachea: 1) cholinergic nerves are modulated by presynaptic, prazosin-sensitive inhibitory presynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptors and 2) NANC inhibitory nerves do not possess presynaptic, modulatory alpha adrenoceptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study, however, reports that the alpha-1 adrenergic blocking activity of prazosin is lower in the presence than in the absence of the plasma protein alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG), at the same unbound concentrations. This phenomenon suggests that plasma proteins can modify the activity of drugs by mechanisms other than those reflected by changes in the unbound fraction values. The pharmacodynamic activity (percentage of decrease in systolic blood pressure) of prazosin was studied in control rats and in rats that were administered 40 mg/kg of human AAG. The effect vs. log unbound concentration relationships were right-shifted in the presence of AAG both after intravenous bolus doses (160 micrograms/kg) and during intravenous infusion (0.6-2.4 micrograms/min/kg), i.e., AAG decreased the activity of unbound prazosin. The Emax and EC50 (mean +/- S.E.) values for unbound prazosin in control animals in the intravenous bolus study were 33.4 +/- 2.6% of the control blood pressure (zero time) and 6.2 +/- 1.4 ng/ml, respectively; and in AAG-treated animals 37.8 +/- 6.0% of the control blood pressure and 18.9 +/- 6.1 ng/ml, respectively. The EC50 value was statistically significantly increased in the presence of AAG (t = 4.97, P less than .001) whereas no difference was seen in the Emax value (t = 1.65, P greater than .1). The possible underlying mechanism(s) of the effect of AAG is discussed.\r"

So-called \"partial agonist\" benzodiazepines appear to cause limited benzodiazepine effects and little or no behavioral tolerance. To evaluate behavioral and neurochemical effects of a partial agonist during chronic administration, we treated mice with Ro16-6028, 0.25, 1 and 4 mg/kg/day by implanted osmotic pumps, evaluating open-field activity and binding and function at the GABAA receptor. All three doses of Ro16-6028 caused dose-dependent decreases in vertical movements (rearing), and no tolerance was observed up to 14 days at any dose. In contrast, tolerance occurred to the effects of clonazepam at 7 days. Benzodiazepine receptor occupancy was essentially complete in all brain regions evaluated at doses of 1 and 4 mg/kg/day. Benzodiazepine binding in vivo at 0.25 mg/kg/day was transiently decreased in cortex at 7 days but was unchanged in any other brain region. Benzodiazepine binding in cortex in vitro was unchanged over time at any of the three doses, as were t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate binding and binding at the low- and high-affinity GABA sites measured by [3H]SR-95531. GABAA receptor function as determined by muscimol-stimulated chloride uptake was unchanged over 14 days of administration at Ro16-6028 doses of 0.25 and 4 mg/kg/day. Concentrations of Ro16-6028 were constant during administration at 1 and 4 mg/kg/day. These data indicate that chronic Ro16-6028 causes dose-dependent behavioral effects without the development of tolerance and that, despite substantial or complete benzodiazepine receptor occupancy, few effects occur at the GABAA receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Medium containing Am (30 microM + 1 microCi of [14C]Am) was perfused through the lung for 20 min (uptake), followed by 20 min of perfusion with drug-free medium (efflux). Lack of metabolism enabled us to follow Am by measuring the amount of radioactivity in perfusate and lung. Other concentrations of Am (3, 60 and 120 microM; n = 2-4 each) were also examined. Inhibited uptake and accelerated efflux of Am were attempted with the pneumophilic amphiphilics chlorimipramine, chlorphentermine, chlorpromazine, verapamil and with the main metabolite of Am: desethylamiodarone (60 and/or 240 microM; n = 3-4 lungs each). Lung extracted Am extensively during uptake. The amount of Am accumulated at 20 min (inflowing concentration: 30 microM) averaged 1307 +/- 109 (S.E.) nmol/g, corresponding to a tissue to medium ratio of 43.3 +/- 1.6. Spontaneous efflux of Am was incomplete. At 40 min, 862 +/- 105 nmol of Am remained bound per g of lung, suggesting sequestration of Am in a slowly effluxable pool in which calculations show that more than 50% of the drug will ultimately persist. Uptake and efflux rates obey biexponential kinetics, indicating storage into two pools. Uptake rate and the amount of Am accumulated in lung at 20 min increased in proportion to inflowing concentration up to 60 microM. At 120 microM the increase was less. Neither amphiphilic was capable of inhibiting Am uptake, whereas only chlorphentermine significantly accelerated Am efflux.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the present report, we identify compound LY277359 maleate as a potent, p.o. active, highly selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist lacking gastroprokinetic effects. LY277359 maleate was a potent and selective antagonist of 2-methyl 5-HT-induced contraction in the guinea pig ileum (KB = 1.6 nM), a response mediated by activation of 5-HT3 receptors. Given both i.v. (0.0003, 0.001 and 0.003 mg/kg) and p.o. (0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg), LY277359 maleate inhibited the bradycardic response to i.v. administered 5-HT in urethane-anesthetized rats. The duration of antagonism of 5-HT-induced bradycardia persisted beyond 6 hr after p.o. administration of LY277359 maleate (0.03 mg/kg p.o.). In contrast to its potent 5-HT3 receptor antagonist activity, LY277359 maleate, in doses up to 1 mg/kg p.o., did not affect gastric emptying in rats, suggesting minimal, if any, gastroprokinetic activity of LY277359 maleate. This is in contrast to another 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, zacopride, which did produce a marked increase in gastric emptying in rats at doses of 0.1 mg/kg p.o. and higher. LY277359 maleate (0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg i.v. and 0.07, 0.1, 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg p.o.) did have effects consistent with other 5-HT3 antagonists, to inhibit cisplatin-evoked emesis in dogs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The flounder proximal tubule primary monlayer cultures mounted in Ussing chambers have provided a means to examine the relationship of these models to transepithelial transport. Unidirectional transepithelial 3H-PAH fluxes were determined in 12-day-old monolayers on floating collagen gels under continuously short-circuited conditions. The kinetic values of PAH secretory flux were complex. Over the range of 0.6 microM to 1.5 mM the K1/2 was 0.4 mM and Vmax was 80 nmol/cm2/h. Reabsorptive flux did not saturate. 1 mM probenecid inhibited 95% of the secretory flux (0.07 +/- 0.18 compared with control of 1.38 +/- 0.34 nmol/cm2/h at 10 microM PAH) and had no significant effect on reabsorptive flux (probenecid, 0.07 +/- 0.04; control, 0.05 +/- 0.01 nmol/cm2/h). 0.1 mM 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanalostilbene-2,2'-diasulfonic acid and 1 mM benzoylpropionic acid also significantly inhibited secretory flux (95 and 78%, respectively). These inhibitors appeared to be specific in that no effects on transepithelial potential difference, resistance or phlorizin-sensitive current were seen. Removal of Na during flux measurement reduced net PAH secretion to zero, and 1 mM ouabain reduced PAH secretory flux to 10% of control within 90 min with no effect on reabsorptive (leak) flux. Clamping transepithelial voltage to +/- 10 mV had no significant effect on PAH fluxes. Addition of glutarate to flounder saline significantly inhibited PAH secretory flux starting at 0.1 mM and caused 90% inhibition at 1 mM; no stimulation of transport was noted at any glutarate concentration.\r"

Although these compounds are thought to be noncompetitive antagonists in the brain due to the fact that they do not compete effectively for agonist binding to brain tissue in vitro, pharmacological evidence is lacking. The alteration of nicotine's dose-response curves for depression of spontaneous activity and antinociception was determined in the presence of increasing concentrations of pempidine. Pempidine was found to increase the ED50 of nicotine (0.73 mg/kg) for depression of spontaneous activity in a dose-related manner. At a dose of 3 mg/kg, pempidine increased nicotine's ED50 4.7-fold. The maximum effect of nicotine was achieved in the presence of the highest dose of pempidine, suggesting competitive antagonism. However, pempidine did decrease the maximum effect of nicotine in producing antinociception at doses that increased the ED50 13.7-fold which suggests a noncompetitive action. The structural requirements for mecamylamine's antagonism of these nicotine effects was also determined in order to address the question of whether the antagonists are interacting at a receptor site. The structure-activity relationships of the mecamylamine analogs revealed that the N-, 2- and 3-methyl groups were important for optimal potency. Optical isomerism was found to have little effect on potency. Addition of pyridinyl groups to the nitrogen abolished the activity of these compounds. The structural requirements for the agonists and antagonists therefore appear to be quite different. The alterations produced similar results for antagonism of both effects of nicotine. Mecamylamine and pempidine therefore appear to exhibit both competitive and noncompetitive properties in antagonizing the central effects of nicotine.\r"

In the GPI, tolerance to and physical dependence on various opiates were induced by direct incubation with an agonist and tolerance and abstinence were assessed after its rapid removal by extensive washing. Dependence, as evidenced by an increase in twitch height and after removal of the agonist as compared to that before incubation, provided an index of the degree of physical dependence. The extent of the supersensitive response after agonist removal was noted to be related directly to the agonist concentration and the degree of tolerance development. Furthermore, the supersensitive response was found to be stereospecific, naloxone reversible and preferentially mu receptor-mediated. Likewise, tolerance to opiates could be demonstrated in the MVD by direct incubation with an agonist. Unlike the GPI, rapid removal of the agonist by washing did not produce a supersensitive response to electrical stimulation. However, a supersensitive response was demonstrable in the presence of naloxone. Thus, after a tolerant/dependent state was induced by incubation of the vas with a predetermined dose of [D-Ala2, D-Leu5]enkephalin that completely abolished the twitch response, the subsequent addition of naloxone resulted in a supersensitive response to electrical stimulation that was concentration-dependent. The maximum twitch response in the presence of naloxone, compared to that obtained before incubation with the agonist, provided an index of the extent of dependence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Both anesthetics demonstrated a dose-dependent direct coronary vasodilation that was reversible, with the median effective dose being 1.31 +/- 0.08 (mean +/- S.E.) for halothane, and 1.53 +/- 0.12 for isoflurane (P = 0.06; units of measure are the fraction of minimum alveolar concentration for each anesthetic). Further studies indicated that maximal vasodilation by adenosine was diminished after 90 min of perfusion, independent of anesthetic administration. Myocardial oxygen consumption was decreased significantly from the beating state by arrest, but neither anesthetic nor adenosine affected myocardial oxygen consumption further. These data indicate that halothane and isoflurane are equipotent for inducing direct dilation of coronary resistance vessels in the isolated perfused arrested rat heart.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of the platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonist, WEB 2086, and the xanthine, enprofylline, on PAF-induced plasma exudation in tracheobronchial airways has been studied in guinea pigs. Superfusion of PAF (4 nmol) onto the tracheal mucosal surface caused a significant exudation of the i.v. plasma tracers [131I]albumin and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (fluorescein-labeled dextran MW 156 kDa) during the first 15 min after PAF (early response) and also 5 hr later (late response). The early, but not the late, response could be identified histologically by a particulate tracer (carbon given i.v.) which was trapped in submucosal leaky vessels. WEB 2086 [3 mg (6.6 mumol)/kg] caused significant attenuation of both the early plasma exudative response (with loss of carbon-labeled vessels) and the late plasma exudative response to PAF. The late response was equally well attenuated by enprofylline [4.85 mg (25 mumol)/kg] given before PAF. It is concluded that PAF-induced late (as well as early) plasma exudative responses in guinea pig tracheobronchial airways are the result of specific receptor activation by topical PAF and that the antiasthma xanthine enprofylline can inhibit this PAF-induced late response. Our data suggest that particulate tracers, such as carbon, cannot detect microvessels involved in the ongoing late phase exudative response to PAF.\r"

Release was stimulated with 30 mM K+ while superfusing with Krebs-Ringer buffer, in the presence or absence of U-50,488H (3 nM to 1 microM). In both tissues, U-50,488H resulted in a concentration-related increase in release. The estimated EC50 values were found to be 14 and 42 nM in brain and spinal tissues, respectively. The increase in release was antagonized by 3 x 10(-7) M naloxone. The induction of release was found to be a Ca+(+)-dependent process which was significantly reduced in Ca+(+)-free medium containing ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid. Tolerance to U-50,488H was induced in mice using a slow release method. They were tested with the tail-flick assay to ensure tolerance had developed. The U-50,488H-induced release of [3H] serotonin was observed to decrease from both tissues of the U-50,488H-tolerant animals. These findings suggest that tolerance to the antinociceptive action of U-50,488H is accompanied by a decrease in its ability to stimulate serotonin release from brain and spinal tissues.\r"

  ".W": "Myocardial cells utilize membrane transport systems for proton extrusion as well as internal buffers to preserve pH homeostasis. Our laboratory had shown previously that amiloride (0.01-1.0 mM) causes a time- and dose-dependent increase in action potential duration, early after depolarizations and enhanced automaticity. Ion-selective microelectrode technique was used to evaluate whether the observed electrophysiologic effects of amiloride are linked to inhibition of Na/H exchange and subsequent inability of the myocardial cell to maintain steady-state intracellular pH (pHi), either under normal physiological conditions or in the presence of an imposed acid load. We analyzed different components of intracellular pH transients that occur in response to NH4Cl exposure and washout, which allowed us to quantitatively describe the effects of Na/H exchange inhibition in a multicellular preparation. Amiloride (0.01-1.0 mM) did not change the steady-state pHi, but did cause a dose-dependent increase in both the time for the pHi to reach a minimum value (time-to-peak) during washout of NH4Cl as well as in the absolute minimum value of pHi (peak acid). The effects of amiloride on pHi transients are rapidly reversible and antagonized by physiologic values of extracellular sodium activity. We conclude that Na/H exchange inhibition by amiloride does not cause intracellular acidosis under normal physiologic conditions, despite the dramatic changes in action potential characteristics. However, amiloride affected the time-to-peak and the peak acid value of the pHi transient during NH4Cl washout at concentrations that had no discernible effect on the overall time course of pHi recovery.\r"

  ".W": "A human monoclonal antibody, designated 53-2-4, has been isolated and characterized in terms of its ability to interact with clostridial neurotoxins. In enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay assays the antibody reacted with native tetanus toxin, tetanus toxoid and the C fragment obtained from the carboxyterminus of the toxin (AA 864-1314). The antibody did not react with the B fragment of tetanus toxin (AA 1-863) or with six serotypes of botulinum neurotoxin (A to F). Both culture supernatant from the clonal line producing the antibody as well as homogeneous protein obtained by affinity purification of the antibody neutralized tetanus toxin. When tested in vivo, the antibody provided complete production against a supralethal injection of toxin; when tested in vitro, the antibody produced at least 99% inactivation of a 1 x 10(-9) M solution of toxin. The exceptional neutralizing activity of the antibody was attributed to its high affinity for the toxin (4.2 x 10(-10) mol/liter). Animal experiments revealed a novel phenomenon that has been labeled delayed intoxication. At the appropriate ratio of antibody to antigen, the toxin was retained in the host in a latent form. After several days the biological activity of the toxin became apparent and there was onset of nervous system poisoning. Isolated tissue experiments showed that each antibody molecule is capable of associating with two antigen molecules. The antibody has greater neutralizing activity when mixed with free toxin than when mixed with toxin already bound to plasma membrane receptors.\r"

Concern about surgeon-to-patient transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) persisted despite reassurances from health authorities. Therefore, HIV antibody testing was offered to the surgeon's patients. We identified 2160 patients operated on since 1982; none had been reported to Tennessee's AIDS registry. A total of 264 had already died; none were reported to have died of AIDS or other HIV-related diseases. Of the 1896 patients remaining, we contacted 1652; 616 (37%) were tested. Only one (an intravenous drug user) was HIV antibody positive, and his medical history suggested that he may already have had AIDS at the time of his surgery. These results support the concept that the risks to patients operated on by HIV-infected surgeons are most likely quite low and support recommendations for the individualized assessment of HIV-infected health care workers.\r"

Study subjects were patients in a long-term care facility (mean age, 87 years) newly begun on a regimen of NSAID therapy. For the study group as a whole, the serum urea nitrogen level rose 1.7 mmol/L 5 to 7 days after initiation of therapy, with no significant changes in serum creatinine or potassium levels. In a comparison group of 45 patients not receiving NSAID therapy, no significant change in the serum urea nitrogen level was noted during a similar period. A subgroup of 15 patients (13%) experienced a greater than 50% increase in the serum urea nitrogen level during NSAID therapy, with a mean increase of 89% (8.6 mmol/L). A return to the baseline level occurred within 14 days after discontinuation of NSAID therapy. Two factors were significantly predictors of a greater than 50% increase in the serum urea nitrogen level: concurrent loop diuretic therapy (odds ratio, 2.2) and high NSAID dose (odds ratio, 2.0). These findings suggest that reversible azotemia develops in a sizable proportion of the very old who are treated with short-term NSAID therapy.\r"

We conducted a face-to-face survey of 122 general surgeons, orthopedic surgeons, and anesthesiologists in three hospitals to evaluate the influence of several clinical and nonclinical factors on transfusion decision making. We found widespread deficiencies in physicians' knowledge of transfusion risks and indications. Each transfusion risk was estimated correctly by fewer than half of the physicians surveyed, and only 31% responded correctly to a set of four questions regarding transfusion indications. Attending physicians routinely had lower knowledge scores than did residents, yet they exhibited more confidence in their knowledge. Residents' transfusion decisions, however, were strongly influenced by the desires of their attending physicians, resulting in their ordering potentially inappropriate transfusions. Of the residents surveyed, 61% indicated that they ordered transfusions that they judged unnecessary at least once a month because a more senior physician suggested that they do so. These findings provide insights for the development of strategies to improve transfusion practices, which would address the dual concerns of quality of care and cost containment.\r"

Among the 2923 patients who were located and provided information, 32 patients developed clinical hyperparathyroidism. The incidence of clinical hyperparathyroidism was 18.7 per 100,000 person-years below the age of 40 years and 171 per 100,000 person-years in the age range of 40 to 60 years. This represents a 2.9-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.6 to 4.3) and 2.5-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 3.9) increase in the incidence of hyperparathyroidism compared with that among the general population. In addition, 31% of the patients who developed hyperparathyroidism also developed thyroid cancer, which is higher than the 11.2% prevalence of thyroid cancer in the patients who received radiation therapy who did not develop parathyroid tumors. Patients with a history of head and neck irradiation should have their parathyroid glands evaluated on a regular basis.\r"

Therefore, a case-control study with 1177 individuals who died of leukemia and 5330 other deaths (controls) was conducted using estimates of dose to bone marrow computed from fallout deposition rates and subjects' residence locations. A weak association between bone marrow dose and all types of leukemia, all ages, and all time periods after exposure was found. This overall trend was not statistically significant, but significant trends in excess risk were found in subgroups defined by cell type, age, and time after exposure. The greatest excess risk was found in those individuals in the high-dose group with acute leukemia who were younger than 20 years at exposure and who died before 1964. These results are consistent with previous studies and with risk estimates for other populations exposed to radiation.\r"

In such studies, more than 90% of these particles are trapped in the precapillary arterioles of the lung, resulting in an extremely inhomogeneous distribution of radionuclide. We used a computer program that accounted for the inhomogeneity of radiopharmaceutical distribution and calculated the dose to individual lung cells. Absorbed doses to individual lung cells were found to vary by a factor of about 30,000. We believe that such findings call for a reevaluation of the justification for dosimetry at the organ level and an examination of the implications of absorbed doses calculated at the cellular level for the estimation of radiation risks.\r"

Although from 1950 to 1984 only 18 cancer cases were identified among the in utero sample, cancer risk did appear to significantly increase as maternal uterine dose increased. However, since the observed cases are too few in number to allow a site-specific review, the increased cancer risk cannot be definitively attributed to atomic bomb radiation, as yet. For those members of the F1 population who were less than 20 years old between 1946 and 1982, cancer risk did not appear to increase significantly as parental gonadal dose increased. Follow-up of this population will continue to determine if the patterns of adult-onset cancer are altered.\r"

We focus primarily on the risk of death from cancer among individuals in the Life Span Study sample of the Radiation Effects Research Foundation from 1950 through 1985 based on recently revised dosimetry procedures. We report the risk of cancer other than leukemia among the atomic bomb survivors. We note that the number of excess deaths of radiation-induced malignant tumors other than leukemia increases with age. Survivors who were exposed in the first or second decade of life have just entered the cancer-prone age and have so far exhibited a high relative risk in association with radiation dose. Whether the elevated risk will continue or will fall with time is not yet clear, although some evidence suggests that the risk may be declining. It is important to continue long-term follow-up of this cohort to document the changes with time since exposure and to provide direct rather than projected risks over the lifetime of an exposed individual.\r"

These studies have also helped to define the stages in the development of the human brain that are particularly susceptible to radiation-related damage. Exposure at critical junctures in development increases the risk of mental retardation, small head size, subsequent seizures, and poor performance on conventional tests of intelligence and in school. The most critical period, 8 through 15 weeks after fertilization, corresponds to that time in development when neuronal production increases and migration of immature neurons to their cortical sites of function occurs. The epidemiologic data are, however, too sparse to settle unequivocally the nature of the dose-response function and, in particular, whether there is or is not a threshold to damage. If a threshold does exist, it appears to be in the 0.10- to 0.20-Gy fetal-dose range in this vulnerable gestational period.\r"

The 1990s present a new challenge for the medical community in a different social and international context characterized by increasing global interdependence. Another view of physician activism is presented to complement advocacy for nuclear disarmament in the promotion of peace. A framework for analysis is provided by \"fateful visions\"--accepted policy views of prospective superpower relations--drawn from practitioners of foreign policy, international relations, and security affairs. A perceptual gap may exist between physicians who wish to address underlying ethical and public health concerns on security issues and policy practitioners who are accustomed to discussion within existing policy frames of reference that can be pragmatically used. A strategy is proposed for physicians to use their specialized training and skills to evaluate trends in global health interdependence. The international physicians' movement may contribute substantively to the formulation of policy by expanding and interpreting an increasingly complex database on interdependence, and by creating a dialogue with policy formulators based on mutual recognition of the value and legitimacy of each professions' expertise and complementary contributions to international security policy.\r"

Our data suggest that the victim's cumulative skeletal radiation dose may have exceeded 350 Sv by the time he died. This figure far exceeds most current estimates of what radiation exposure level would constitute a rapidly lethal dose if given acutely. The physiological response to longterm internal radiation exposure and the highly localized nature of alpha particle irradiation may require the development of new models for the assessment of risk in cases of internal alpha particle irradiation.\r"

In dogs with induced tricuspid insufficiency, aortic pressure, right and left atrial pressures, and aortic blood flow increased, similar to the results obtained in the clinical study. Diaphragm pacing produced a sufficient tidal volume (7.2 to 12 ml/kg) for maintenance of normal blood gas levels in the patients, all of whom recovered spontaneous breathing without any weaning problems after 2 to 6 hours of diaphragm pacing. The catheter electrode used for stimulation was placed 30 mm away from the sinus node to avoid arrhythmias. Respiratory control by diaphragm pacing is hemodynamically superior to that by intermittent positive-pressure ventilation, and its efficacy is expected, especially in critical cases or in diseases or conditions in which the decrease in the load of the right heart affects the hemodynamic status of the patient.\r"

The 45 patients with Down's syndrome catheterized under 1 year of age had a lower mean pulmonary blood flow (3.2 versus 5.7; p = 0.0001) and higher mean pulmonary vascular resistance (8.3 versus 4.6 Wood units.m2; p = 0.0003) than their 34 normal chromosome counterparts. When all ages were included, 38 of 81 (47%) of the children with Down's syndrome and 32 of 40 (80%) of the normal children were considered operable. Non-Down's syndrome patients who had operations had a higher pulmonary blood flow (5.8 versus 3.3; p = 0.004) and lower pulmonary vascular resistance (3.6 versus 6.0 Wood units.m2; p = 0.005) than Down's syndrome patients. Of the 34 patients who did not have operations because of pulmonary vascular obstructive disease, 31 had Down's syndrome. In 10 of 81 children with Down's syndrome, fixed pulmonary vascular obstructive disease was diagnosed before the age of 1 year, while this was found in none of 40 normal children. Our data demonstrate that Down's syndrome patients with complete atrioventricular canal have a greater degree of elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance in the first year of life and more rapid progression to fixed pulmonary vascular obstructive disease than children with normal chromosomes.\r"

  ".W": "The Abiomed BVS System 5000 (Abiomed Cardiovascular, Inc., Danvers, Mass.) is a gravity-filled, pneumatically driven external prosthetic ventricle that has been implanted as a circulatory support device in six patients 9 to 58 years of age, presenting with a refractory heart failure nonamenable to any type of corrective operation. Three (including a 9-year-old girl) had an end-stage nonobstructive myocardiopathy, and two (including one patient who had had a massive recent myocardial infarction) had an ischemic heart disease. When first seen, the 58-year-old patient had an acute rejection and graft failure occurring 2 months after a first transplantation. All patients showed evidence of a low-output state (cardiac index less than 1.5 L/min/m2), with renal failure (mean urinary output, less than 27 ml/min) and hypoxia (mean arterial oxygen pressure = 56 torr under 80% forced inspiratory oxygen), despite maximum pharmacologic support (dobutamine, 16 to 18 gamma/kg/min; dopamine, 3 to 18 gamma/kg/min; adrenaline, 0.2 to 0.7 gamma/kg/min; furosemide, 7 to 17 gamma/kg/min). The device was implanted through a midline sternotomy and under peripheral normothermic bypass. Five patients received a biventricular support, and one a single left prosthetic ventricle. The cannulation included a right-angled cannula in both the left and right atrium and a suture of the arterial Dacron tubes onto the ascending aorta and main pulmonary artery. After careful deairing of the tubing and ventricles, the console was activated and the bypass progressively discontinued. Heparin infusion was begun 3 hours after chest closure and was continued for the duration of assist pumping, which was 2 to 11 days (mean duration, 7.43 days). The system could provide a complete support of the circulation with both right and left ventricular index remaining stable at 2.4 to 3 L/min/m2. After a dramatic improvement at the time of the system activation, the urinary output remained adequate, thus allowing for a decreasing need for diuretic therapy. In two cases, including one of isolated left ventricular assist pumping, the circulation could be totally supported during 11 hours and 23 hours, respectively, of refractory ventricular tachycardia. Four of six patients were shortly weaned from inotropic agents. Hematologic studies showed a moderate decrease of the coagulation factors level during the first 6 hours of circulatory support, and this remained stable and within normal limits thereafter. There have been three cases of bleeding complications necessitating surgical revision on the sixth hour, the twelfth hour, and the sixth day, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Iron catalysis is involved in the generation of the highly cytotoxic hydroxyl radical and in the chain reactions of subsequent lipid peroxidation that lead to irreversible membrane damage. Assuming that ischemically stored heart transplants may incur free radical injury at the time of reoxygenation, we assessed the effects of the iron chelator deferoxamine in 70 isolated isovolumic buffer-perfused rat hearts subjected to the following protocol: cardioplegic arrest; cold (2 degrees C) storage for 5 hours; global ischemia at 15 degrees C for 1 hour, intended to simulate the implantation procedure; and normothermic reperfusion for 1 additional hour. During poststorage ischemic arrest, the following techniques of myocardial protection were evaluated: hypothermia alone; high-pressure (60 cm H2O) cardioplegia given at 0, 30, and 55 minutes of arrest; low-pressure (30 cm H2O) cardioplegia given at 0 and 55 minutes of arrest; and low-pressure (30 cm H2O) cardioplegia only given at 55 minutes of arrest. Treated hearts had deferoxamine (6 mumol) added to the cardioplegic solution used throughout the experimental time course. Further, in the treated group subjected to the protocol of single cardioplegic delivery at end ischemia, deferoxamine was given both in the cardioplegic reperfusate and in the Krebs buffer over the 15 initial minutes of reflow. Based on comparisons of postreperfusion ventricular pressure development, maximal rate of rise of ventricular pressure, left ventricular compliance, and coronary flow, the best myocardial protection was afforded by deferoxamine given as an additive to single-dose cardioplegic solution at the end of arrest and to the reperfusate during the initial phase of reoxygenation. As the drug has no inotropic effect, its protective action is most likely related to a decrease in catalytic iron available for free radical production and lipid peroxidation. These results support the hypothesis that oxidative damage may contribute to donor heart failure and demonstrate that this form of damage can be efficiently acted upon by iron chelation. The clinical relevance of these data stems from the fact that deferoxamine is available for human use and might become an effective means of improving donor heart preservation in the setting of clinical heart transplantation.\r"

In all patients, there were average increases in mean arterial pressure from period 1 to period 2 of 9.4 (95% confidence interval 5.8, 13.0) mm Hg, from period 2 to period 3 of 6.3 (95% confidence interval 1.2, 11.4) mm Hg, and from period 1 to period 3 of 15.7 (95% confidence interval 10.6, 20.9) mm Hg. At 2.0 L.min-1.m-2, mean arterial pressure was 7.2 (95% confidence interval 1.6, 12.9) mm Hg higher than at 1.5 L.min-1.m-2. Peripheral vascular resistance was significantly affected only by stage and flow rate. There were, in all patients, mean increases in peripheral vascular resistance from period 1 to period 2 of 239 (95% confidence interval 135, 343) dynes.sec.cm-5, from period 2 to period 3 of 85 (-64, 234) dynes.sec.cm-5, and from period 1 to period 3 of 324 (95% confidence interval 175, 473) dynes.sec.cm-5. At 1.5 L.min-1.m-2, the peripheral vascular resistance was 316 (95% confidence interval 152, 480) dynes.sec.cm-5 higher than at 2.0 L.min-1.m-2. Alteration in flow rate, but not flow character or arterial pH, had a significant effect on peripheral vascular resistance. It is hypothesized that the increase in peripheral vascular resistance during the course of cardiopulmonary bypass results from an active capillary mechanism, whereas the increase that is associated with reduction in flow rate reflects a passive mechanism. The increase in peripheral vascular resistance with decrease in flow rate indicates impaired tissue perfusion, unlike that occurring with stage.\r"

Since 1983, 17 patients have undergone a cavopulmonary shunt procedure (five primary operations, 12 secondary operations). Diagnoses were single ventricle complex (n = 4), hypoplastic right heart syndrome (n = 10), and hypoplastic left ventricle (n = 3). Age at primary operation ranged from 3 1/2 to 30 months (median 6 months). Weight ranged from 3.5 to 9.7 kg. Age at secondary operation ranged from 10 months to 14 years (median 15 months). Seven cavopulmonary shunt operations were performed without cardiopulmonary bypass (six via thoracotomy and one via sternotomy) and 10, with cardiopulmonary bypass. All patients in the bypass group had additional procedures: takedown of modified Blalock-Taussig shunt, seven patients; revision of right ventricular outflow tract, four patients; reconstruction of pulmonary arteries, four patients; tricuspid valvuloplasty, one patient; and Damus procedure, one patient. There was one (1/17) operative death (Damus procedure). One patient required early revision. Follow-up ranges from 1 to 53 months (median 23 months). Twelve of 16 had a good to excellent late result, with a rise in mean arterial oxygen saturation from 69% to 83%. Three patients died late (4 to 53 months) (pulmonary vascular disease, pulmonary arteriovenous malformations, and pneumonia, one patient each). There was one late failure (converted to Glenn shunt). The cavopulmonary shunt is an excellent palliative procedure when right atrium-pulmonary artery connection (modified Fontan) must be deferred because of age, weight, or anatomic considerations. Five patients have undergone right atrium-pulmonary artery connection later. In addition, at the time of the modified Fontan operation, the cavopulmonary shunt approach may optimize the anatomic connection (eight additional patients).\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-one patients undergoing a coronary artery bypass graft operation for the third time were retrospectively reviewed to assess the factors of importance in the management of these patients. The study spans 5.8 years and represents 6.2% of coronary bypass reoperations and 0.6% (21/3500) of total bypass operations during that time. The indication for reoperation was disabling angina pectoris not responsive to medical treatment in 20 patients (95%) and unstable angina pectoris with an intraaortic balloon pump present in one patient (5%). Median sternotomy was used in all and cardiopulmonary bypass in all but one who had an interposition vein graft without cardiopulmonary bypass. Internal mammary artery grafting was used in 86% of patients. There were no operative deaths. One patient died 12 months after his operation. Four patients (19%) required intraaortic balloon pump support postoperatively for up to 6 days. There were no reexplorations for bleeding. One patient required sternal rewiring for an early dehiscence (5%). Respiratory failure occurred in eight patients (38%). Average stay was 4.4 days in the intensive care unit and postoperative hospital stay was 13.7 days. No new Q waves were noted postoperatively. Detailed follow-up was obtained on 18 of the 20 survivors (90%). The two remaining are alive but declined interview efforts. All patients interviewed reported feeling subjectively better than before operation; however 61% of these interviewed continue to have some degree of angina pectoris. One patient has had a late myocardial infarction. This report suggests that the third time coronary bypass can be done with good results when myocardial revascularization is indicated.\r"

All of the patients had symptoms. The mean New York Heart Association class was 3.3 +/- 0.9. Adequate decalcification with restoration of leaflet mobility was achieved in all patients, including seven with bicuspid aortic valves. Leaflet perforation occurred and was successfully repaired in five patients. Ten patients underwent concomitant myocardial revascularization. There were two operative deaths (9%) and three late deaths. Echocardiograms were obtained preoperatively, postoperatively, and at 6 months. The mean aortic valve area increased significantly from 0.72 +/- 0.17 to 1.42 +/- 0.31 cm2 (p less than 0.001) and the peak gradient decreased from 74 +/- 34 to 25 +/- 13 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). At 6 months the aortic valve area (1.29 +/- 0.48 cm2) and peak gradient (31 +/- 12 mm Hg) continued to be significantly better than the preoperative measurements (p less than 0.001), but the 6-month aortic valve area was slightly decreased and the gradient increased when compared with the immediate postoperative values (p less than 0.02). The prevalence of mild to moderate aortic insufficiency increased from 50% of the patients preoperatively to 87% at 6 months (p less than 0.05). Two patients subsequently required aortic valve replacement for restenosis and aortic insufficiency. Ultrasonic decalcification is effective in relieving aortic stenosis, but subsequent restenosis and insufficiency may limit its application.\r"

  ".W": "The St. Jude Medical valve is a bileaflet prosthesis with excellent hemodynamic characteristics, but the long-term surgical experience with this valve, its durability, and its biocompatibility are unknown. During a 10-year period from March 1978 to 1988, 690 prostheses (290 aortic, 252 mitral, and 74 double aortic-mitral) were inserted as the initial valve replacement substitute in 616 patients (mean age 63 years). Coronary atherosclerosis was present in 58%. Follow-up totaled 2031 patient-years (mean 3.3 years) and was 95% complete (32 lost). Early (30-day) mortality rates were 5.2%, 11.9%, and 8.1% after aortic, mitral, and double valve replacement; 5- and 9-year actuarial survival rates were 71% +/- 3% and 51% +/- 8%, 59% +/- 4% and 41% +/- 6%, and 69% +/- 6% and 47% +/- 15%, respectively. Deaths were associated with extensive coronary atherosclerosis (p less than 0.001), older age (p less than 0.001), advanced preoperative New York Heart Association functional class (p less than 0.05), and malignant ventricular arrhythmias (p less than 0.05). No structural failures have been observed. Embolism (40 events) occurred at a rate of 2.0%/pt-yr (2.3% aortic, 1.6% mitral, 2.0% double). There were six cases of valve thrombosis (0.3%/pt-yr; one fatal). Hemorrhage was the most frequent complication (2.6%/pt-yr); 13 (25%) of 52 events were fatal, accounting for 62% of all valve-related deaths. After the target prothrombin time ratio was lowered, the rate of hemorrhage decreased by 44% (2.7% to 1.5%/pt-yr), while the combined rate of embolism and valve thrombosis increased slightly (2.2% to 2.5%/pt-yr, a 14% change). In summary, the St. Jude Medical valve remains a durable valve substitute. Survival was strongly related to the presence of associated coronary atherosclerosis. The most common complication has been hemorrhage; a less intensive warfarin regimen may reduce hemorrhagic risk while maintaining thromboembolic protection.\r"

We subjected 141 consecutive adult patients and nine children to antegrade/retrograde cardioplegia using rapid transatrial insertion of the Retroplegia cannula (Research Medical, Inc., Salt Lake City, Utah). Single venous cannulation was used in 116 patients having coronary artery bypass grafting or aortic valve replacement, or both. Initial antegrade blood cardioplegia caused immediate arrest (less than 1 minute) and the cardioplegic dose was divided equally between antegrade and retrograde delivery. Included are 95 patients having isolated bypass grafting (34 with extending infarction, cardiogenic shock, or ejection fraction less than 20%); 19 having coronary reoperations, 42 with aortic or mitral valve procedures, or both; and nine children having repair of congenital defects (e.g., repair of ventricular septal defect, Rastelli operation, Konno operation). Septal temperature in patients with occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery fell to 11.5 degrees +/- 0.5 degrees C after retrograde cardioplegia versus only 16 degrees +/- 3 degrees C after antegrade cardioplegia (p less than 0.05). The overall hospital mortality rate was 2% and no complications followed transatrial retrograde cannulation of the coronary sinus.\r"

  ".U": "90309355\r", 
  ".W": "Although the etiology of allograft coronary artery disease, a major limiting factor in long-term survival after cardiac transplantation, is poorly understood, it is undoubtedly in part immune mediated and not detected by routine endomyocardial biopsy. Therefore it is possible that withdrawal of maintenance corticosteroids, although providing other short- and long-term benefits, could increase the prevalence of allograft coronary artery disease by permitting undetected immune-mediated vascular injury to occur. To assess whether corticosteroid-free maintenance immunosuppression increased the prevalence of allograft coronary artery disease, we reviewed serial angiograms of 102 patients (49% not receiving corticosteroid maintenance therapy) who underwent heart transplantation after March 7, 1985. Multiple variables including serum cholesterol, recipient and donor age, sex, blood pressure, rejection frequency and severity, early rejection prophylaxis protocol (polyclonal versus monoclonal T-cell agents), and corticosteroid use were examined in relation to allograft coronary artery disease by univariate and multivariate analyses. Allograft coronary artery disease was identified in 21 patients (seven severe, four moderate, and 10 mild). The prevalence by Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis was 17% at 1 year and 25% at 2 years. No further allograft coronary artery disease was detected among patients undergoing angiography at three years. Increased allograft coronary artery disease was not noted in patients withdrawn from maintenance corticosteroids when compared with their corticosteroid-requiring counterparts. In fact, with each 1 gm increment in cumulative corticosteroid use, a slightly increased risk (1.04, p less than 0.05) of allograft coronary artery disease was noted (Cox regression model). None of the other variables correlated with the prevalence of allograft coronary artery disease. Thus withdrawal of maintenance corticosteroids is not associated with an increased risk of early allograft coronary artery disease and minimization of corticosteroids may lead to a decreased long-term incidence of coronary artery disease in cardiac transplant recipients.\r"

  ".W": "Oxyradicals potentially limit the myocardial protection provided by blood cardioplegia in ischemically damaged hearts. We tested the hypothesis that the addition to blood cardioplegic solution of a new oxyradical scavenger--N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)-glycine--would result in improved left ventricular performance and oxygen consumption compared to that resulting from the use of blood cardioplegia alone. Gauges and transducer-tipped catheters for left ventricular minor axis ultrasonic dimension were placed in 17 open-chest dogs, and instantaneous left ventricular pressure-diameter data were acquired by computer. The aorta was crossclamped for 30 minutes during total vented bypass to induce ischemic injury. The heart was reoxygenated and protected by multidose, hypothermic blood cardioplegic solution alone (n = 9) or enhanced with 0.0132 mmol N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)-glycine (n = 8) for 1 hour of cardioplegia-induced arrest. Preischemic and postischemic left ventricular performance was measured by slope changes in end-systolic pressure-diameter relations induced by gradual afterload reduction during right heart bypass. When blood cardioplegia alone was used, postischemic left ventricular systolic performance was depressed by 73.2% +/- 10.0% (166.8 +/- 56.1 mm Hg/mm versus 25.1 +/- 7.0 mm Hg/mm). N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)-glycine did not significantly attenuate this functional depression (62.7% +/- 9.0%, 146.6 +/- 67.6 mm Hg/mm versus 33.6 +/- 11.9 mm Hg/mm). The postischemic end-diastolic pressure-diameter relation was shifted to the right, whereas chamber stiffness was increased comparably, with or without N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)-glycine. Postischemic oxygen consumption in the beating working state, calculated from left ventricular blood flow (measured by microspheres) and arterial-coronary sinus oxygen extraction, averaged 7.8 +/- 0.9 ml O2/100 gm/min with blood cardioplegia alone and 7.5 +/- 1.0 ml O2/100 gm/min with N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)-glycine, and was unchanged from paired preischemic values in both groups. We conclude (1) that N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)-glycine added to blood cardioplegic solution in the dose and delivery regimen tested did not improve ventricular systolic and diastolic performance compared with blood cardioplegia alone and (2) that postischemic oxygen consumption may not parallel the extent of left ventricular functional recovery.\r"

In the endocardial and epicardial groups, the accessory pathway was in the left free wall in 22 and 18 patients, respectively, posterior septal in two and seven, and in the right free wall in one patient in each group. There was no early or late death in the endocardial group, and postoperative complications developed in five patients (20%). Pathway ablation was completely successful in 22 patients (88%), preexcitation recurred in two patients (8%), and one had recurrence of supraventricular tachycardia (4%). One of the failures occurred with a posterior septal pathway (50%), and the two others with a left free-wall pathway (9%). With the epicardial technique, there were no early deaths and one late death caused by atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. Five patients (19%) had postoperative complications. The pathway was ablated successfully in 22 patients (85%), preexcitation recurred in three patients (12%), and supraventricular tachycardia remained inducible in another patient despite disappearance of the delta wave. Three of those failures occurred with anterior left free-wall pathways (16%), but only one patient had recurrent supraventricular tachycardia (4%) requiring immediate reoperation, which was successful. In conclusion, although epicardial or endocardial approaches produced similar results, our observations suggest that left free-wall accessory pathways located high anteriorly may be ablated in a more reproducible way with the endocardial technique, whereas the epicardial approach appears easier for posterior septal pathways. We therefore believe that any surgeon beginning such surgery should be aware of the possibilities and limitations of each of the two techniques.\r"

All transfusion services should institute written informed consent that clearly defines the patient's options, including the use of homologous blood, autologous blood, and directed donations. The risk of transfusion with an infectious blood product is dependent on the number of donors per recipient and the prevalence of undetected, contaminated blood in the tested blood supply. The chance that an adverse transfusion will occur can be calculated by use of these variables. Comparative risks can be explained to patients, thereby providing an understanding of the transfusion risk of human immunodeficiency virus, the human T-cell leukemia virus, and the agent of non-A, non-B hepatitis (hepatitis C).\r"

  ".U": "90309360\r", 
  ".W": "Patients undergoing cardiac operations constitute the majority of recipients of fresh frozen plasma. In most centers the reason for transfusing fresh frozen plasma is to replace clotting factors. However, the decrease of clotting factors during cardiopulmonary bypass is not sufficient in most patients to cause abnormal bleeding. One of the major causes of nonsurgical bleeding after cardiac operations is acquired platelet dysfunction, which can be corrected by transfusion of 1 unit of fresh whole blood. Because plasmatic factors in fresh whole blood may be responsible for this improvement, a study was designated to evaluate the effect of transfusing fresh plasma on platelet function after cardiac operations. Forty patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass were randomized to receive either fresh plasma or the fresh packed cell fraction. Administration of packed cells increased platelet number (118 +/- 8.5 to 154 +/- 7.6 x 10(9)/L, p less than 0.05), shortened bleeding time (7.57 +/- 0.4 to 4.0 +/- 0.3 minutes, p less than 0.05), and improved platelet aggregation in response to collagen and epinephrine (32% +/- 4.7% to 50% +/- 5.6% and 37% +/- 5.8% to 50% +/- 5.8%, respectively, p less than 0.05). Fresh plasma, however, neither increased platelet number nor improved bleeding time or platelet aggregation. Each group later received the remainder of the blood unit, with similar results. The results suggest that improvement of platelet function in patients receiving fresh whole blood after cardiac operations is not related to plasmatic factors. Therefore the massive use of fresh frozen plasma in patients after cardiopulmonary bypass should be reconsidered.\r"

Nonetheless, it has proved to be a useful alternative technique in carefully selected patients. Herein we report our experience with seven symptomatic patients who were treated with self-bougienage for recurrent benign esophageal strictures. These seven patients (six men and one woman; mean age, 66.9 years) had had dysphagia for a mean of 37.9 months and had undergone a mean of 6.7 endoscopic dilations before their involvement in a self-bougienage program. During a mean follow-up period of 36.3 months (range, 10 to 78 months) after initiation of self-bougienage treatment, all seven patients became asymptomatic and remained free of dysphagia. No complications occurred in any patient, and no further endoscopic dilations were necessary. Our results suggest that self-bougienage can provide long-term symptomatic relief in selected patients with recurrent benign esophageal strictures.\r"

Of this group, 703 alumni (52%) responded to the survey, 532 of whom were currently practicing internal medicine. Our detailed analysis was based on responses from these 532 and, for some aspects of evaluation, on the 121 general internists who had completed residency training after 1970. Of the respondents, 42% spent more than 80% of their time in general medicine, and 53% had at least some subspecialty practice; 55% were involved in teaching, 20% in some research, and 37% in various administrative duties. In 27%, all patient-care activities involved primary care, an increase from 18% in a 1979 survey and 9% in 1972. Of those who were subspecialists, 67% spent more than half their time in subspecialty practice. Of those who were trained after 1970, 90% were board certified. Most respondents thought that their training in the internal medicine subspecialties was adequate, that additional procedure training was needed in joint aspiration, line placement, and flexible sigmoidoscopy, and that many allied medical areas were important to their practice and necessitated additional training. Although virtually all respondents assessed their inpatient training as adequate, only 42% were fully satisfied with their outpatient training. Alumni surveys can be useful in restructuring a residency program to meet the needs of the trainees.\r"

Psychiatric diagnoses had been recorded for 16 of the 34 members with the translocation compared with only 5 of the 43 without it. The lod scores (against chance linkage of the translocation with mental illness) were greatest when the mental disorders in the phenotype were restricted to schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, recurrent major depression, and adolescent conduct and emotional disorders. Although the mental illness in this family may not be typical of that in the general population, the findings suggest that the q21-22 region of chromosome 11 may be a promising area to examine for genes predisposing to major mental illness.\r"

In the acute phase of the open trial, eleven patients (73%) improved and avoided colectomy; the mean response time was 5.8 days. Patients who responded were maintained on oral cyclosporin (6-8 mg/kg daily) for a 6-month chronic phase. Six of the eleven patients have been weaned from steroids and remain in clinical and endoscopic remission 5-18 months after discontinuation of cyclosporin; three are well at 5 months and their steroid dose is being tapered; one patient relapsed after 5 months on oral cyclosporin and underwent colectomy; and one patient failed to show continued improvement with oral cyclosporin but is in clinical remission after changing to mercaptopurine treatment. Slight self-limiting adverse side-effects of cyclosporin were seen, but none necessitated withdrawal from the study. Cyclosporin seems to be an effective treatment for patients with severe active ulcerative colitis who have not responded to steroids.\r"

Women entering in the 6th week of gestation had a greater probability of aborting before TA-CVS than women entering after day 48. 26 women aborted spontaneously before TA-CVS, the majority of abortions occurring at 10-12 weeks. TA-CVS was done in 346 women. 11 pregnancies were terminated because of genetic anomalies, and 8 women had spontaneous fetal loss. These findings justify delaying prenatal diagnosis in older pregnant women until 12 weeks of gestation.\r"

Increased jitter and blocking were seen up to 3 weeks before clinical illness or decrement developed. Stimulation at 10 Hz appeared more sensitive in detection of abnormalities than stimulation at 3 or 5 Hz. Jitter values did not correlate with anti-Torpedo acetylcholine receptor (AChR), nor with anti-rat AChR antibody titer. No correlation was found between jitter and AChR loss or AChR-antibody complexes in muscle. It is concluded that, in addition to AChR loss and the presence of AChR-antibody complexes, other factors must determine the neuromuscular dysfunction in EAMG and possibly myasthenia gravis.\r"

Recordings were made at different times during the process of regeneration, ranging from 3 months up to 11 years. The responses showed a constant shape and latency to every stimulation (simple or repetitive). The latency was shorter the more distal the level of injury and the greater the elapsed time from the reinnervation. The point of \"reflexion\" of the responses is at or very near the line of nerve suture. The electrophysiological behavior of the responses fits well with either the criterion of axon reflex or ephaptic response. We discuss both possibilities and conclude that it is not possible, with the electrophysiological technique that we used, to distinguish between an axon reflex and an ephaptic response.\r"

Concentric needle EMG showed abundant and persistent spontaneous activity, maximal at insertion, and uninfluenced by local curarization. Single-fiber EMG showed rather stable, sometimes intermittent, discharge series with occasional amplitude and/or frequency fluctuations. It could be demonstrated that this activity did not consist of complex repetitive discharges, but of independent activity of individual muscle fibers. This contrasts with findings by other investigators that have been published in this journal. Light microscopic studies of quadriceps and intercostal muscles showed no abnormalities, whereas electron-microscopic findings were in accordance with earlier studies in SJS. Endplate analysis revealed no specific changes; the postsynaptic structures gave the impression of an accelerated-maturation.\r"

  ".W": "Skeletal muscle fibers from a patient with Schwartz-Jampel syndrome were studied in vitro. The fibers had normal resting membrane potentials, but their resting [Ca2+]i was elevated. The resting potentials were unstable and spontaneous depolarizations caused twitching in all fibers. Stimulated contractions were characterized by markedly slowed relaxation which was due to electrical after-activity. Neither curare (0.7 microM), tocainide (50 microM), nor phenytoin (80 microM) had an effect on the myotonic activity. In contrast, procainamide (200 microM) suppressed the hyperexcitability without affecting the twitch amplitude. The steady-state current-voltage relation was normal in 5 fibers, but altered in 3 others. These latter fibers had an increased specific membrane resistance owing to a decreased Cl- conductance. The Na+ channels were investigated in the cell-attached patch clamp mode. In all patches on either type of fiber, depolarizing pulses elicited delayed, synchronized openings of Na+ channels. These abnormal openings occurred even after the surface membrane repolarized. We hypothesize that these altered membrane conductances are responsible for the hyperexcitability and the associated slowed relaxation.\r"

Sensory orthodromic conduction along median and tibial nerves was typical of FA and did not change between first and last examinations, nor were there morphological changes between the first and the second sural nerve biopsies. Peripheral nerve involvement is thought to be a result of defective development of the largest neurons and to remain stable from a very early stage of the disease; the clinical worsening may then be due to a progressive involvement of the pyramidal tracts and the cerebellar pathways.\r"

MUs over the full range of voluntary recruitment thresholds were studied. Patients with slightly affected FDIs (5) mainly showed MUs with enlarged MEPs and increased twitch forces. In contrast, the patients with more severely affected FDIs (15) revealed decreased twitch forces, especially in the MUs with higher thresholds. The corresponding MEPs could be enlarged as well as normal. It appears that MU sprouting and the resulting increase of twitch force can compensate for the loss of motoneuron in early stages of ALS. In more advanced stages, however, a decline of the force of the surviving MUs, especially of those with higher thresholds, seems to contribute to the progressive muscle weakness, in addition to the corticospinal degeneration and the reduction in the number of motoneurons.\r"

Because myotonic mouse muscle has a strongly reduced PV content, the reduced PV serum level in ADR mice indicated that serum PV is derived from skeletal muscle. Serum PV in mdx mice, in which muscle PV content is close to normal, is a measure of the necrosis of fast muscle fibers. Serum levels of PV and CK were not significantly elevated in heterozygous (mdx/+) carrier females. Serum PV in Duchenne patients was below the limit of detection.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. To evaluate the epidemiology of infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in selected urban communities in the United States, we instituted active surveillance at sentinel hospitals by anonymous testing of samples of blood specimens for HIV-1 antibody. To reflect better the rates of HIV-1 seroprevalence in the communities served by the sentinel hospitals, we excluded specimens from all patients with diagnoses that are often associated with HIV infection. RESULTS. From January 1988 to June 1989, 89,547 specimens were tested at 26 hospitals in 21 cities. The overall rate of HIV-1 seroprevalence was 1.3 percent, but it ranged from 0.1 to 7.8 percent according to hospital (median, 0.7 percent). The age distribution of persons seropositive for HIV-1 was similar across hospitals and closely paralleled that of persons with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). In areas of low seroprevalence, HIV-1 infections were highly concentrated among men. However, the male-to-female ratio (median, 7.0) decreased steadily with an increasing overall rate of seroprevalence (P less than 0.001); at the five hospitals with the highest rates of seroprevalence, the median male-to-female ratio was only 2.9. The median black-to-white ratio of HIV-1 seroprevalence was 1.8, but at hospitals with low rates of seroprevalence the rates in blacks and whites were nearly equal. At two hospitals in the communities with the highest prevalence of AIDS, 1.1 to 3.8 percent of adolescents 15 to 19 years old and 18 to 22 percent of all men 25 to 44 years old were seropositive for HIV-1. CONCLUSIONS. In these sentinel, urban populations there is tremendous variation in the rate of HIV-1 infection (over 70-fold). The very high seroprevalence at some sentinel hospitals indicates the need for routine screening for HIV-1 infection among some groups of patients, regardless of clinical presentation.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. The optimal management of immune thrombocytopenic purpura during pregnancy remains controversial because the risk of severe neonatal thrombocytopenia remains uncertain. We studied the outcome of the index pregnancy in 162 women with a presumptive diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenic purpura to determine the frequency of neonatal thrombocytopenia and to determine whether neonatal risk could be predicted antenatally by history or platelet-antibody testing. RESULTS. Two maternal characteristics were identified as predicting a low risk of severe neonatal thrombocytopenia: the absence of a history of immune thrombocytopenic purpura before pregnancy, and the absence of circulating platelet antibodies in the women who did have a history of the condition. Eighteen of 88 neonates (20 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 13 to 30 percent) born to women with a history of immune thrombocytopenic purpura had severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count less than 50 x 10(9) per liter at birth), as compared with 0 of 74 (0 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 0 to 5 percent) born to women first noted to have thrombocytopenia during pregnancy (P less than 0.0001). Among the women with a history of immune thrombocytopenic purpura, 18 of 70 neonates (26 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 16 to 38 percent) born to those with circulating platelet antibodies had severe thrombocytopenia, as compared with 0 of 18 infants (0 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 0 to 18.5 percent) born to those without circulating antibodies (P less than 0.02). Thus, the risk of severe neonatal thrombocytopenia in the offspring of women without a history of immune thrombocytopenic purpura before pregnancy and of women with a history of the condition in whom circulating platelet antibodies are not detected was 0 percent (95 percent confidence intervals, 0 to 5 and 0 to 18.5 percent, respectively). CONCLUSIONS. The absence of a history of immune thrombocytopenic purpura or the presence of negative results on circulating-antibody testing in pregnant women indicates a minimal risk of severe neonatal thrombocytopenia in their offspring.\r"

The agamous gene therefore probably encodes a transcription factor that regulates genes determining stamen and carpel development in wild-type flowers.\r"

  ".W": "Peptides bound to class I or class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-encoded molecules are ligands for the antigen-specific T-cell receptor of T-cells carrying the CD8 and CD4 antigens, respectively. MHC class I-restricted T cells generally recognize peptides derived from processing of endogenously synthesized cellular antigens, whereas class II-restricted T cells usually recognize peptides derived from exogenous antigens entering antigen presenting cells. Accordingly, two separate pathways of antigen processing and presentation have been proposed. The fungal metabolite brefeldin A (BFA), an inhibitor of protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum, inhibits presentation of endogenous antigens for MHC-restricted T-cell recognition. The selectivity of BFA activity has been inferred to reflect presentation of a given antigen processed through the cytosolic or the endocytic route. Here we show that BFA also greatly inhibits the presentation of exogenous protein antigens by MHC class II molecules to T cells, indicating a broader effect of this drug on antigen presentation and an additional similarity between the two processing pathways. As cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, also inhibits presentation of protein antigens to class II-restricted T cells, the data indicate that peptides generated by processing of exogenous proteins binds to newly synthesized class II molecules for presentation to T cells.\r"

  ".W": "Stimulation of the endothelial lining of arteries with acetylcholine results in the release of a diffusible substance that relaxes and hyperpolarizes the underlying smooth muscle. Nitric oxide (NO) has been a candidate for this substance, termed endothelium-derived relaxing factor. But there are several observations that argue against the involvement of NO in acetylcholine-induced hyperpolarization. First, exogenous NO has no effect on the membrane potential of canine mesenteric arteries. Second, although haemoglobin (believed to bind and inactivate NO (refs 11-15)) and methylene blue (which prevents the stimulation of guanylate cyclase) inhibit relaxation, neither has an effect on hyperpolarization. Finally, nitroprusside, thought to generate NO in vascular smooth muscle, relaxes rat aorta without increasing rubidium efflux. Nevertheless, nitrovasodilators, nitroprusside and nitroglycerin cause hyperpolarization in some arteries. NO might therefore be responsible for at least part of the hyperpolarization induced by acetylcholine. We now report that hyperpolarization and relaxation evoked by acetylcholine are reduced by NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, an inhibitor of NO biosynthesis from L-arginine. Thus NO derived from the endothelium can cause hyperpolarization of vascular smooth muscle, which might also contribute to relaxation by closing voltage-dependent calcium channels. Our findings raise the possibility that hyperpolarization might be a component of NO signal transduction in neurons or inflammatory cells.\r"

  ".W": "The response of a retinal rod cell to a weak flash of light is mediated by a receptor/GTP-binding protein (rhodopsin/transducin) signal transduction system and terminates within a second. The T alpha subunit of transducin (composed of subunits T alpha, T beta and T gamma) is triggered by photoexcited rhodopsin (R*) to release GDP and bind GTP. The binding of GTP causes release of the T alpha unit from T beta gamma and allows it to modulate the activity of an enzyme that generates a second messenger. Termination of the response requires the hydrolysis of the GTP by intrinsic GTPase. As with other G proteins, the GTPase activity of transducin seems to be slow. Reported in vitro turnover rates of a few molecules of GTP hydrolysed per molecule of transducin per minute imply a T alpha-GTP deactivation time of many seconds. But this time might be only a small fraction of that of the GTPase cycle. We have now used time-resolved microcalorimetry in bovine rod outer segments (ROS) to monitor the heat release due to the hydrolysis of GTP by a transducin population that had been quickly activated by flash illumination of rhodopsin. The enthalpy of GTP hydrolysis is released within 1 s at 23 degrees C. This deactivation time seems to be independent of any diffusible factor in the preparation and concurs with the termination kinetics of the rod's response. Thereafter, transducin seems unable to reload GTP for many seconds. This refractory 'resetting' time may account for the low steady-state GTPase rates in vitro.\r"

The activities of these key regulatory enzymes are directly neutralized by their primary endogenous inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). Although some individuals with a tendency to develop thrombotic disorders exhibit elevated levels of PAI-1 in their plasma, the cause-and-effect relationship between increased PAI-1 and thrombosis is still unclear. Specifically, it is not known whether chronic depression of fibrinolytic activity results in the development of thrombosis. To address this question we developed transgenic mice in which the contribution of PAI-1 to thrombus formation could be evaluated. The results presented in this report indicate that elevated levels of PAI-1 contribute to the development of venous but not arterial occlusions.\r"

This implies that the position of the polyadenylation signal determines its efficiency, and we report here experiments aimed at investigating the basis of this phenomenon. Our results with cauliflower mosaic virus suggest that proximity to the transcription initiation site inhibits messenger RNA 3'-end processing directed by polyadenylation signals.\r"

It is commonly assumed that the brain constructs its percept of the visual scene from information encoded in the selective responses of such neurons. We have now tested this hypothesis directly by measuring the effect on psychophysical performance of modifying the firing rates of physiologically characterized neurons. We required rhesus monkeys to report the direction of motion in a visual display while we electrically stimulated clusters of directionally selective neurons in the middle temporal visual area (MT, or V5), an extrastriate area that plays a prominent role in the analysis of visual motion information. Microstimulation biased the animals' judgements towards the direction of motion encoded by the stimulated neurons. This result indicates that physiological properties measured at the neuronal level can be causally related to a specific aspect of perceptual performance.\r"

  ".W": "Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus is a widely studied model system for understanding the cellular mechanisms of memory. In region CA1, LTP is triggered postsynaptically by Ca2(+)-dependent activation of protein kinases, but the locus of persistent modification remains controversial. Statistical analysis of synaptic variability has been proposed as a means of settling this debate, although a major obstacle has been the poor signal-to-noise ratio of conventional intracellular recordings. We have applied the whole-cell voltage clamp technique to study synaptic transmission in conventional hippocampal slices (compare refs 28-30). Here we report that robust LTP can be recorded with much improved signal resolution and biochemical access to the postsynaptic cell. Prolonged dialysis of the postsynaptic cell blocks the triggering of LTP, with no effect on expression of LTP. The improved signal resolution unmasks a large trial-to-trial variability, reflecting the probabilistic nature of transmitter release. Changes in the synaptic variability, and a decrease in the proportion of synaptic failures during LTP, suggest that transmitter release is significantly enhanced.\r"

Myelin basic protein has been studied as a potential autoantigen in the disease because of its role as an encephalitogen in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and post-viral encephalomyelitis and because of the presence in the blood of multiple sclerosis patients of in vivo-activated T cells reactive to myelin basic protein. Immune involvement in multiple sclerosis has been further suggested by the association with the major histocompatibility complex class II phenotype DR2, DQw1. To define the T-cell specificity toward myelin basic protein, 15,824 short-term T-cell lines were established from multiple sclerosis subjects, subjects with other neurological diseases, and normal controls. Here we report a higher frequency of T-cell lines reactive with a DR2-associated region of myelin basic protein between residues 84-102 in patients with multiple sclerosis compared with controls. A second region, identified between residues 143-168, was recognized equally in multiple sclerosis patients and controls and was associated with the DRw11 phenotype. These DR2 and DRw11 associations were also observed among T-cell lines generated from family members of a multiple sclerosis patient. The immunodominant 84-102 peptide from myelin basic protein was both DR2- and DQw1-restricted among different T-cell lines. These results raise the possibility that this immunodominant region may be encephalitogenic in some DR2+ individuals.\r"

  ".W": "Certain cell fate decisions are specified by cell-cell interactions during the development of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. For example, in a wild-type hermaphrodite gonad, two cells, Z1.ppp and Z4.aaa, have the potential to become the anchor cell (AC). Intercellular communication establishes their fates and ensures that only one cell becomes the AC, while the other becomes a ventral uterine precursor cell (VU). One component of this intercellular communication seems to be the 'AC-to-VU' signal from the presumptive AC that causes the other cell to become a VU. Genetic and developmental studies indicated that the lin-12 gene specifies the fates of Z1.ppp and Z4.aaa. Molecular studies suggest that lin-12 directly participates in their communications, perhaps acting as the receptor for the 'AC-to-VU' signal. Here, we report the molecular lesions associated with lin-12 gain-of-function mutations, cell isolation experiments, and genetic studies of an unusual lin-12 allele. These data suggest that self-association of the putative lin-12-encoded receptor leads to its activation, and that certain gain-of-function mutations result in ligand-independent activation.\r"

Transcription of the vertebrate U6 and 7SK RNA genes by RNA polymerase III depends exclusively upon upstream signals, some of which are indistinguishable from the elements essential for polymerase II-specific genes. In the plant Arabidopsis thaliana the promoter elements for the U6 and U2 small nuclear RNA genes, transcribed by RNA polymerases III and II respectively, are identical, comprising a -30 TATA box and an upstream element specific for small nuclear RNA genes. The distance between these elements differs, however. Here we report evidence that this separation is crucial in determining whether the genes are transcribed by polymerase II or III.\r"

The second group, with Schirmer test greater than 5.5 mm/5 min, showed similar changes to be localized in the interpalpebral bulbar conjunctiva only, while the eye surface protected by the lids was almost normal. These observations suggest a pathogenetic role of tear evaporation in eyes with tear film instability even in the presence of a 'theoretically' normal tear production.\r"

We have enumerated several injuries that frequently occur together and have called them clinical dyads. It is hoped that knowledge of the associations will prevent oversight of the second lesion. The radiographic examination serves as an extension of the physical examination, confirming clinical suspicions and documenting the extent of many injuries. We have outlined what we believe is a prudent radiographic examination in a multiply injured patient. It provides information about the areas most likely to have injuries but is not so extensive that it hinders patient care. It is a starting place or survey and may lead to other, more complicated radiographic studies should the findings warrant them.\r"

The majority of these injuries are related to hyperflexion. Plain radiography remains the mainstay of diagnosis of vertebral injuries. However, CT and MR imaging have important places in assessing patients with vertebral injuries. The radiographic assessment of these injuries is made easier by the fact that each injury occurs in a predictable and reproducible pattern that is defined by the mechanism. These features are termed the \"fingerprints\" of injury and indicate the full extent of damage. By recognizing the fingerprints and carefully evaluating the patient for abnormalities of alignment, bony integrity, cartilage or joint space, and soft tissues, it is possible to determine rapidly the full extent of injury and plan further evaluation and treatment. Instability may be assumed if there is displacement, widening of the interspinous space, widening of facet joints, widening of the interpediculate distance, or disruption of the posterior vertebral body line.\r"

Subjects received no analgesia during the latent phase and either no analgesia or epidural analgesia during the active and/or transition phase. Data were analyzed according to phase and analgesic condition. For subjects with no epidural analgesia, both the Present Pain Intensity (PPI) and the Present Behavioral Intensity (PBI) scores were correlated within and between phases. In contrast, Coping/Distress scores were weakly correlated between the latent and active labor phases and were unrelated between the active and transition phases. PPI and Coping/Distress scores were highly correlated within the latent phase but were independent within the active and transition phases of labor. PBI and Coping/Distress scores were moderately correlated within the latent and active phases and were unrelated during the transition phase. Epidural techniques reduced subjective pain and pain behavior significantly but had no apparent effect on the coping or distress-related cognitive activity characteristic of active labor. We concluded that coping and distress-related cognitive activity in labor may follow a phase-specific pattern which is relatively independent of pain or pain relief after labor has become active.\r"

One group received intracutaneous injections of sterile water in the lumbosacral region, while the other group was given corresponding subcutaneous injections of isotonic saline, regarded as a placebo treatment. In the group that received intracutaneous sterile water injections the mean VAS score was significantly more reduced compared to the placebo group at 10 min (P less than 0.001), 45 min (P less than 0.02), and at 90 min (P less than 0.05) after the treatment. The midwives' blind estimation of the effectiveness of treatment was consistent with the VAS assessment. However, the requirement of pethidine (meperidine) was similar in the 2 groups. The analgesic method presented was found to be an effective treatment against lower back pain during the first stage of labour and it is speculated that the mode of action resembles acupuncture.\r"

  ".W": "Altogether 553 children (195 first graders, mean age 6.8 years, and 358 third graders, mean age 8.7 years) participated in the development of a self-report measure to assess the intensity of children's pain. The first step was the derivation, from children's drawings of facial expressions of pain, of 5 sets of 7 schematic faces depicting changes in severity of expressed pain from no pain to the most pain possible. With the set of faces that achieved the highest agreement in pain ordering, additional studies were conducted to determine whether the set had the properties of a scale. In one study, children rank-ordered the faces on 2 occasions, separated by 1 week. All 7 faces were correctly ranked by 64% (retest 1 week later, 61%) of grade 1 children and by 86% (retest 89%) of grade 3 children. In a second study, the faces were presented in all possible paired combinations. All 7 faces were correctly placed by 62% (retest 86%) of the younger and by 75% (retest 71%) of the older subjects. A third study asked children to place faces along a scale: a procedure allowing a check on the equality of intervals. The fourth study checked on whether pain was acting as an underlying construct for ordering the faces in memory. We asked whether children perceived the set as a scale by asking if memory for an ordered set of faces was more accurate than for a random set. The final study checked, with 6-year-old children, the test-retest reliability of ratings for recalled experiences of pain. Overall, the faces pain scale incorporates conventions used by children, has achieved strong agreement in the rank ordering of pain, has indications that the intervals are close to equal, and is treated by children as a scale. The test-retest data suggest that it may prove to be a reliable index over time of self-reported pain.\r"

Three descriptive studies involving 1223 children, aged 8-17 years, were conducted in school and hospital settings. The aims were to develop and examine the validity and reliability of a word list for measuring pain quality that was free of age, gender, and ethnic biases. A word list with 43 words was developed and resulted in sensory, affective, evaluative, and total scores that correlated with pain location and pain intensity scores (r = 0.19-0.44; P less than or equal to 0.01). Pain quality scores decreased over time in a postoperative pain model. Test-retest reliability of the word list scores was high (r = 0.78-0.95; P less than 0.001). This word list was revised and resulted in a word list with 56 words relatively free of gender, ethnic, and developmental biases. Additional research is needed to assess the psychometric properties of this word list in pediatric populations experiencing different pain syndromes.\r"

  ".W": "A model of experimental peripheral neuropathy producing pain-related disorders has recently been described in the rat. The present study aimed to investigate, using a different and quantifiable behavioural approach, the abnormal pain-related sensations in the animals. The neuropathy was produced by 4 ligatures tied loosely around the common sciatic nerve. 6-8 days after surgery, most of the rats exhibited pain-related disorders ipsilateral to the sciatic ligation, which became maximal 2 weeks after surgery. Mechanical noxious stimulation (pinching of the hind paw) revealed hyperalgesia in all the animals. Rats also exhibited allodynia when tested with the vocalization threshold test to paw pressure (mean vocalization thresholds were 65.5 +/- 3.6% of the preoperative control, P less than 0.01, n = 95). Tests using heat (40, 42, 44, 46 degrees C) and cold (10 degrees C) stimulation (immersion of the rat's hind paw in a bath until it was observed to struggle) indicated hyperalgesia to noxious heat (decrease of 30% in the immersion duration (ID) at a temperature of 46 degrees C), and allodynia to non-noxious heat (decrease of 30% in the temperature of the struggle threshold) and to cold stimulation (decrease by 40% in the ID). In addition, the animals showed modifications in the spontaneous postures of the affected hind paw in a natural setting, suggesting a 'spontaneous' pain-related behaviour (the mean 'pain' rating, derived from the technique used for the formalin test and numbered 0-5, was 2.8 +/- 0.4, P less than 0.01, n = 12). Lastly, sensitized responses were observed to mechanical stimulation after thermal stimulation in the non-noxious range applied to the lesioned but not the non-lesioned paw. The time course of pain-related disorders was comparable whatever the behavioural test, with recovery 2 months after surgery. These results clearly show that the neuropathy produces abnormal pain-related disorders in the rat, which are reminiscent of those observed in some human neuropathies.\r"

Infants meeting these criteria whose parents were judged to be adequate observers and had a telephone and automobile were eligible for outpatient management. Infants were given ceftriaxone to cover the possibility that the low risk criteria might miss more infants with serious bacterial infections than was predicted. From Jan. 1, 1987 to May 31, 1989, 86 infants younger than 2 months were enrolled. There were no serious complications in these infants. Twelve had transient problems possibly related to the intramuscular ceftriaxone therapy. One low risk infant was hospitalized for Neisseria meningitidis bacteremia and five other infants were hospitalized for medical or social reasons. All six hospitalized infants had short admissions and did well. This study supports the continued use of the low risk criteria to distinguish infants unlikely to have a serious bacterial infection. Furthermore, in a selected group of low risk infants, outpatient management may be an acceptable alternative to inpatient therapy.\r"

We could demonstrate neither reduced IgG2 nor specific anti-polysaccharide antibody activity in the otitis-prone children.

There was neither a relationship between the IgG2 concentration and the number of otitis episodes prior to enrollment nor a reduction in otitis frequency in the gamma-globulin-treated group.\r"

Although colonization of low birth weight infants with U. urealyticum occurs frequently, the actual rate of vertical transmission of U. urealyticum in preterm infants has not been determined. Sixty-five preterm infants (less than 37 weeks of gestation) born to mothers colonized with U. urealyticum had eye, throat, vagina and rectum cultured for U. urealyticum at 1, 3 and 7 days of age and weekly thereafter for the first month of life while the infants remained in the hospital. Thirty-eight infants (58%) had at least one culture site positive for U. urealyticum (eye, 8%; throat, 37%, vagina, 54%; and rectum, 18%). Vertical transmission was not affected by method of delivery or duration of rupture of amniotic membranes. The rate of vertical transmission of U. urealyticum was higher among infants with birth weight less than 1,000 g (89%) than among those with birth weight of 1,000 g or greater (54%) (P = 0.07). Chronic lung disease developed in 9 of the 65 (14%) infants; 8 were colonized with U. urealyticum. The high rate of ureaplasmal colonization and chronic lung disease in infants less than 1,000 g makes these infants a suitable target population for a clinical treatment trial to determine whether eradication of U. urealyticum would decrease the incidence of chronic lung disease.\r"

The overall prevalence of any hepatitis B virus marker was 3.4%, increasing from 1.7% in 3- to 5-year-old children to 5% in 10- to 11-year-old children (P less than 0.002). Prevalence was not associated with the father's years of schooling (odds ratio, 1.98; confidence interval, 95% (0.9 to 4.6] or with the family size (odds ratio, 2.96; confidence interval, (0.7 to 11.8]. The overall HBsAg prevalence was 0.8, a rate that was lower than the 5.6% found in pregnant women. The finding of only 12 HBsAg-positive children of the 1,426 tested, despite 80 of them being born to HBsAg-positive carrier mothers (on the basis of the 5.6% HBsAg prevalence among pregnant women), is probably attributable to the low proportion (5%) of hepatitis B e antigen positivity among the HBsAg-positive carrier mothers in the study area. The observed low HBV infection rate in younger age groups, which confirms recent studies in other areas of Italy, appears to be the result of several factors: improved socioeconomic conditions; decreased family size; and increased use of disposable syringes in the last few years.\r"

Thirty-two men and 32 women (35-55 years) without a history or signs of cardiovascular disease (CVD) were studied. Subjects produced a VM of 40 mmHg for 10 seconds in each of five randomly assigned bed (flat, sidelying, 30 degrees elevated, 70 degrees elevated) and chair positions. Age covaried with SBP and HR responses to the VM. When age relationships were factored out, the most intense changes in SBP during the VM occurred in the 30 degrees and 70 degrees elevated and chair positions. Persons with a history of atherosclerotic CVD, on bedrest, should be positioned with head of the bed flat to reduce cardiovascular risks associated with the VM.\r"

The MYTH was completed by 13 teachers on 155 preschool children in a cross-sectional study and on sub-samples of this original group who were followed during a 2-year longitudinal study. These results were used to investigate internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the MYTH. Construct validity was evaluated by factor analysis as well as by examining the relationship of the MYTH scale and its subscales to cardiovascular reactivity, self-esteem, and locus of control. Construct validity was further assessed by testing for a predicted difference between boys and girls on the MYTH.\r"

The HRHS was developed to measure the effects of hardiness in individuals with actual health problems. Items were generated that measured the presence, rather than absence, of the hardiness dimensions based on theoretical definitions of health-related control, commitment, and challenge. Two factors were isolated using principal components analysis (n = 389). These two factors, Challenge/Commitment and Control, accounted for 32.1% of variance. Factor loadings were strong, ranging from .41 to .68. Parsimony of the HRHS was achieved by reducing the original 51-item scale to 34 items. Alpha reliability coefficients were .91 for the total scale and .87 for each subscale. Test-retest, reliability coefficients ranged from .74 to .78. The final scale retained only two of the originally conceptualized three dimensions of the health-related hardiness construct.\r"

One hundred nine subjects (58 males and 51 females) participated in the cross-sectional mail survey. Psychosocial attribute strength was a significant predictor of basic need satisfaction; basic need satisfaction was a significant predictor of perceived stress; and basic need satisfaction, perceived stress, and disease severity were significant predictors of symptomatic experience. The psychosocial attributes variable was a significant predictor of basic need satisfaction for both sexes. For males, basic need satisfaction and stress were significant predictors of symptomatic experience, while psychosocial attributes were not. For females, the psychosocial attributes variable was a significant predictor of symptomatic experience, while basic need satisfaction and stress were not. The findings suggest that psychosocial resources and perceived stress may be important factors in the symptomatic experience of adults with COPD. Males and females seem to differ in the role psychosocial attributes and basic need satisfaction play in the dynamics of the proposed model.\r"

In addition, employed mothers were employed more hours prenatally and reported prenatal plans to be employed sooner after the infant's birth than nonemployed mothers. Employed mothers also perceived more support from others for their employment and greater financial necessity and availability of child care than nonemployed mothers. Higher scores on employment orientation were correlated with higher maternal education level, fewer children, more hours employed, higher total support for their employment, higher financial necessity, and less choice and satisfaction with employment status.\r"

These spiral-shaped bacteria have internal periplasmic flagella that propel the cells in low-viscosity and gel-like high-viscosity media. A model of Leptospiraceae motility has been previously proposed that states that the subterminally attached periplasmic flagella rotate between the outer sheath and the helical protoplasmic cylinder. The shape of the cell ends and the direction of gyration of these ends are determined by the direction of rotation of the internal periplasmic flagella. Rotation of the periplasmic flagella in one direction causes that end to be spiral-shaped, and rotation in the other direction causes that end to be hook-shaped. One prediction of the model is that these right-handed spirochetes roll clockwise when swimming away from an observer. For maximum swimming efficiency, the model predicts that the sense of the spiral-shaped end is left-handed and gyrates counterclockwise. The present study presents direct evidence that the cell rolls clockwise (protoplasmic cylinder helix diameter = 0.24 micron; pitch = 0.69 micron), the ends gyrate counterclockwise, and the spiral-shaped end is left-handed (helix diameter = 0.6 micron; pitch = 2.7 microns)--as predicted by the model. The hook-shaped end appears approximately planar. The approach used was to illuminate stroboscopically cells slowed by Ficoll and analyze the resultant multiple-exposure photographs focused above and below the axis of the cell. The methodology used should be helpful in analyzing the motility of the larger and more complex spirochetes.\r"

These secreted polypeptides all bind to the 170-kDa cell-surface EGF receptor, activating its intrinsic kinase activity. However, amphiregulin exhibits different activities than EGF and TGF-alpha in a number of biological assays. Amphiregulin only partially competes with EGF for binding EGF receptor, and amphiregulin does not induce anchorage-independent growth of normal rat kidney cells (NRK) in the presence of TGF-beta. Amphiregulin also appears to abrogate the stimulatory effect of TGF-alpha on the growth of several aggressive epithelial carcinomas that overexpress EGF receptor. These findings suggest that amphiregulin may interact with a separate receptor in certain cell types. Here we report the cloning of another member of the human EGF receptor (HER) family of receptor tyrosine kinases, which we have named \"HER3/ERRB3.\" The cDNA was isolated from a human carcinoma cell line, and its 6-kilobase transcript was identified in various human tissues. We have generated peptide-specific antisera that recognizes the 160-kDa HER3 protein when transiently expressed in COS cells. These reagents will allow us to determine whether HER3 binds amphiregulin or other growth regulatory proteins and what role HER3 protein plays in the regulation of cell growth.\r"

The Reo3R is expressed by mature oligodendrocytes and astrocytes but not by O-2A progenitor cells. It appears at an early stage of oligodendrocyte development, coincident with the O4 marker but prior to galactocerebroside or myelin basic protein. Anti-Reo3R antibodies stimulate the expression of galactocerebroside by developing oligodendrocytes. Divalent Reo3R-binding peptides are similarly active. Maximal stimulation of galactocerebroside expression occurs with treatment as short as 4 hr, consistent with a receptor-mediated process. Cell surface structures used as an attachment site by reovirus type 3 may also play a role in the regulation of oligodendrocyte differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "Cytokines, including interleukin 1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin 6, are often produced in response to tissue injury and contribute to several host responses such as weight loss, anorexia, and acute-phase protein synthesis. However, the role of IL-1 in specific tissue responses is unclear. To test our hypothesis that specific in vivo blockade of IL-1's action might inhibit the catabolic host changes associated with inflammation, mice were passively immunized with a monoclonal antibody directed against the murine IL-1 receptor prior to initiation of a turpentine-induced sterile abscess. This antibody prevents IL-1-mediated proliferation of murine thymocytes in vitro by inhibiting IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta by way of competition for a common receptor. Weight loss following turpentine challenge was prevented by daily injections of anti-IL-1 receptor monoclonal IgG. Body composition analysis confirmed that lean tissue and fat were preserved by passive immunization. Furthermore, pretreatment with an anti-IL-1 receptor monoclonal antibody significantly attenuated the plasma amyloid P and interleukin 6 responses but did not affect the decline in plasma albumin or the increase in circulating corticosterone. Passive immunization of similar mice with polyclonal antisera against another cytokine, tumor necrosis factor alpha, failed to prevent either the weight loss or hepatic acute-phase protein changes observed in this inflammatory model. These findings suggest that IL-1 orchestrates weight loss and body compositional changes during inflammation and contributes to the induction of interleukin 6 and acute-phase protein synthesis.\r"

We have used differential hybridization screening to isolate an E. histolytica-specific cDNA clone. The cDNA was found to encode a serine-rich E. histolytica protein (SREHP) containing multiple tandem repeats. The structural motif of SREHP resembles some of the repetitive antigens of malarial species, especially the circumsporozoite proteins. A recombinant trpE fusion protein containing the tandem repeats of SREHP was recognized by immune serum from a patient with amebiasis, demonstrating that SREHP is a naturally immunogenic protein. An antiserum raised against the recombinant fusion protein specifically bound to two distinct bands with apparent molecular masses of 46 and 52 kDa in a crude preparation of E. histolytica trophozoite membranes. This antiserum also inhibited E. histolytica trophozoite adhesion to Chinese hamster ovary cells in vitro. The ability to isolate E. histolytica-specific genes, and to express those genes in Escherichia coli, may be important in studying the molecular basis of E. histolytica pathogenesis and for the future development of vaccines.\r"

  ".W": "Optimal expression of the high-affinity Fc receptor for IgG (FcRI) by the human monocyte cell line U-937 requires the presence of low density lipoprotein (LDL), and neither cholesterol nor high density lipoprotein can provide the component necessary for optimal FcRI expression. Here we show that FcR-mediated phagocytosis also requires LDL. U-937 cells were cultured in medium containing interferon gamma and either fetal calf serum (FCS) or delipidated FCS (DLFCS). The phagocytosis of IgG-coated erythrocytes was measured by a colorimetric assay. U-937 cells cultured in DLFCS medium had less than 16% of the phagocytic activity of cells cultured in normal FCS medium. Phagocytosis of IgG-coated erythrocytes could be inhibited 85% by the addition of murine IgG2a myeloma protein (5 micrograms/ml). U-937 cells cultured in DLFCS medium supplemented with pure cholesterol in ethanol (10 micrograms/ml) had only 30% of the phagocytic activity of cells grown in FCS medium. Addition of very low density lipoprotein (0.2 mg of protein per ml) to DLFCS medium also failed to increase phagocytosis. However, the addition of LDL (0.2 mg of protein per ml) to DLFCS medium restored 90% of the phagocytic activity. Since neither pure cholesterol nor very low density lipoprotein restored normal phagocytic function to U-937 cells despite a normalization of cellular cholesterol content, the restoration of phagocytosis observed with LDL replacement cannot be explained by mere delivery of cholesterol by LDL. Thus, LDL is required for the expression of FcRI and FcR-mediated phagocytosis by U-937 cells and may be an important regulator of phagocytic activity of monocytes and macrophages in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "The role of the intradiscal polypeptide loops in bovine rhodopsin has been investigated by deletions in the N-terminal tail and in loops B-C, D-E, and E-F as well as by single amino acid substitutions in the D-E loop. Mutants with three types of phenotypes were observed. Type I mutants showed a rhodopsin-like chromophore and glycosylation. Type II mutants did not regenerate the chromophore and showed abnormal glycosylation. Type III mutants showed poor chromophore regeneration and abnormal glycosylation. Reduced transducin activation was shown by some type I and III mutants. Single amino acid substitutions in the D-E loop gave mostly type I mutants. Deletions in loops B-C, D-E, and F-G gave type II mutants, whereas deletions in the N-terminal tail produced type III mutants. Systematic deletions of two adjacent amino acids in loop D-E indicated that the amino acid sequences 171-182 and 189-192 were essential to rhodopsin structure. Immunofluorescence double-staining and transmission electron microscopy of one type II mutant (with residues 189 and 190 deleted) showed that it was mostly in the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas the wild-type protein was in the plasma membrane. We conclude that the first step in the assembly of the rhodopsin molecule is the formation of a three-dimensional structure in the intradiscal domain involving the bulk of the out-of-the-membrane polypeptide segments followed by the linkage of Cys-110 and Cys-187 through a disulfide bond.\r"

Using EPR and the spin traps 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline 1-oxide (DMPO) and N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone (PBN), we have shown that Cu,Zn-SOD catalyzes the formation of \"free\" .OH radicals from H2O2 in pH 7.6 bicarbonate buffer. Supporting evidence includes the following: (i) H2O2 and active Cu,Zn-SOD are required to yield significant signals from spin-trap-OH adducts. (ii) With O2-., Cu,Zn-SOD causes the appearance of intense resonance signals due to DMPO-OH adducts. These signals were inhibited strongly by catalase. (iii) With H2O2, Cu,Zn-SOD, and DMPO, radical scavengers formate and azide, but not ethanol, decrease DMPO-OH signals while causing new intense signals due to their corresponding DMPO-radical adducts. Failure of ethanol to quench DMPO-OH signals is discussed in light of the positively charged active channel of the enzyme. (iv) With PBN as a spin trap, ethanol quenches .OH radical signals and yields PBN-trapped hydroxyethyl radical signals. (v) Mn-SOD does not catalyze \"free\" .OH radical formation and it also exerts no effect on the signals of DMPO-OH adducts when added together with the Cu,Zn-SOD. The capacity of Cu,Zn-SOD to generate \"free\" .OH radicals from H2O2 may in part explain the biological damage associated with elevated intracellular SOD activity.\r"

Developing spermatids in homozygous males form prominent abnormal multinucleated syncytia (symplasts) and do not complete maturation. In addition, abnormal cytoplasmic vacuolation is commonly seen in Sertoli cells. One flank of the transgenic integration site within the genome has been cloned and used to show linkage between homozygosity for the transgene and the mutant phenotype. The flank maps to mouse chromosome 14 approximately 4 centimorgans proximal to the gene encoding esterase-10 (Es-10). As no other gene that is known to be essential for spermatogenesis has been mapped to this region of the genome and as the mutant phenotype is unique, the transgenic insert appears to affect a previously unidentified gene. We have named the mutation \"symplastic spermatids\" (sys).\r"

Hearts isolated from rats treated 6 hr earlier with IL-1 also had increased polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), H2O2 levels, and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) contents compared with hearts from untreated rats. Depletion of circulating blood PMN by prior treatment with vinblastine prevented both early (from treatment 6 hr before study) IL-1-induced increases in myocardial PMN accumulation, H2O2 levels, and GSSG contents and late (from treatment 36 hr before study) increases in myocardial G6PD activity and protection against I/R. Our results indicate that IL-1 pretreatment causes an early (6 hr after IL-1 treatment) myocardial PMN accumulation and most likely an H2O2-dependent oxidative stress, which contributes to late (36 hr after IL-1 treatment) increases in myocardial G6PD activity and decreases in I/R injury.\r"

Although the CD28 antigen has functional and structural characteristics of a receptor, a natural ligand for this molecule has not been identified. Here we show that the CD28 antigen, expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, mediated specific intercellular adhesion with human lymphoblastoid and leukemic B-cell lines and with activated primary murine B cells. CD28-mediated adhesion was not dependent upon divalent cations. Several mAbs were identified that inhibited CD28-mediated adhesion, including mAb BB-1 against the B-cell activation antigen B7/BB-1 and some mAbs against major histocompatibility complex class I antigens. B7/BB-1 expression correlated closely with CD28-mediated adhesion, but class I expression did not. Transfected COS cells expressing the B7/BB-1 antigen adhered to CD28+ CHO cells; this adhesion was blocked by mAbs to CD28 and B7/BB-1. The specific recognition by CD28 of the B-cell activation antigen B7/BB-1 represents a heterophilic interaction between members of the immunoglobulin superfamily that may serve to regulate T-cell cytokine levels at sites of B-cell activation.\r"

This question was addressed by comparing the nucleotide binding properties of the free beta subunit with those of the heterodimer. The free beta subunit was obtained from an in vitro expression system and its nucleotide binding properties were determined by an assay that requires approximately 100-fold less protein than conventional assays. This assay exploits the observation that the recovery of beta-tubulin from Mono Q anion-exchange columns is dependent on added nucleotide. Our results demonstrate that the newly synthesized beta subunit and the heterodimer bind nucleotides with similar specificity. We found that in the presence of magnesium the alpha subunit enhances GTP binding to the beta subunit approximately 4-fold. However, in the absence of magnesium the alpha subunit appears to specifically weaken GTP binding to the beta subunit. Thus, nucleotide binding to the E site in the heterodimer may not be solely defined by the beta subunit.\r"

These are located within 315 nucleotides upstream of the mRNA start site. Transient expression of reporter genes linked to serially deleted sequences of the IL-3 promoter has allowed mapping of two activator sequences and an interposed repressor sequence. The proximal regulatory region is specific to IL-3 and prerequisite for efficient transcription. Its effect is enhanced by a second, more distal activating sequence consisting of an AP-1 binding site. Between the two activators lies a transcriptional silencer, which is a potent repressor in the absence of the AP-1 site. DNA-nuclear protein binding experiments demonstrate specific complex formation within each of these functional regions. Thus, both positive and negative regulatory elements appear to control expression of the human IL-3 gene in activated T cells.\r"

Animals exhibit ataxia, tremor, and abnormalities of posture and tone. Native diphtheria toxin, ricin, and ricin A chain do not cause ataxia and do not reduce the Purkinje cell population after intrathecal injection into guinea pigs at toxic or maximally tolerated doses. However, in rats, which will tolerate higher doses of diphtheria toxin than guinea pigs, Purkinje cells can be killed by both CRM107 and diphtheria toxin. A truncated mutant of diphtheria toxin, called CRM45, can also cause Purkinje cell killing but has additional toxicity not seen with CRM107. Animals treated with intrathecal CRM107 or CRM107 linked to antibodies may serve as models for Purkinje cell loss in a broad spectrum of human diseases and may be used to further study cerebellar physiology.

The altered hormone possessed the same binding affinity to mouse liver membrane preparations as wild-type bGH. Transgenic mice containing the mutated bGH gene, however, showed a significant growth-suppressed phenotype. The degree of suppression was directly related to serum levels of the altered bGH molecule.\r"

We have examined the liver-specific characteristics of this promoter by DNA-protein interactions and by demonstrating the in vivo function of the promoter using the luciferase reporter gene expression system. The DNA-protein interactions in this region appear to be almost entirely liver-specific. Among these, a liver-specific nuclear factor, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein, binds to at least five sites on this promoter. Transient cotransfection experiments using CCAAT/enhancer binding protein expression vectors and the core promoter in the context of either the native hepatitis B virus genome or the luciferase reporter gene demonstrate that CCAAT/enhancer binding protein at low concentration modestly activates expression from the core promoter but represses at high concentration.\r"

During spontaneous oscillations or after direct current injection, dendritic spikes are initiated as slow and graded plateau potentials at the level of the tertiary or spiny branchlets of the dendrite. As the plateau potentials become sufficiently high to reach the firing threshold for full dendritic spike generation, calcium entry is observed at the more proximal branches of the dendritic tree. These action potentials are then conducted orthodromically toward the soma and may invade other branches in the arbor antidromically. Simultaneous recording of the intracellular electrical activity and the Fura-2 fluorescent signal indicates that the intracellular calcium transients are accompanied by a very rapid increase in intracellular calcium concentration. This increase in [Ca2+]i exhibits an almost equally fast return to baseline after the termination of the action potential, indicating the presence of very efficient calcium sequestering and extruding mechanisms in the dendrites. Iontophoretic application of glutamate at the dendritic level provided a further demonstration of the spatial separation of plateau potentials from dendritic spikes and gives further insights into the details of dendritic integration in this neuron.\r"

Sequestration of the receptor away from the cell surface as well as a down-regulation of the total number of cellular receptors are believed to contribute to this agonist-mediated regulation of receptor number. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these phenomena are not well characterized. Recently, tyrosine residues located in the cytoplasmic tails of several membrane receptors, such as the low density lipoprotein and mannose-6-phosphate receptors, have been suggested as playing an important role in the agonist-induced internalization of these receptors. Accordingly, we assessed the potential role of two tyrosine residues in the carboxyl tail of the human beta 2AR in agonist-induced sequestration and down-regulation of the receptor. Tyr-350 and Tyr-354 of the human beta 2AR were replaced with alanine residues by site-directed mutagenesis and both wild-type and mutant beta 2AR were stably expressed in transformed Chinese hamster fibroblasts. The mutation dramatically decreased the ability of the beta 2AR to undergo isoproterenol-induced down-regulation. However, the substitution of Tyr-350 and Tyr-354 did not affect agonist-induced sequestration of the receptor. These results suggest that tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic tail of human beta 2AR are crucial determinants involved in its down-regulation.\r"

  ".W": "Pharmacologic, biochemical, and genetic analyses have demonstrated the existence of multiple alpha 2-adrenergic receptor (alpha 2AR) subtypes. We have cloned a human alpha 2AR by using the polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotide primers homologous to conserved regions of the previously cloned alpha 2ARs, the genes for which are located on human chromosomes 4 (C4) and 10 (C10). The deduced amino acid sequence encodes a protein of 450 amino acids whose putative topology is similar to that of the family of guanine nucleotide-binding protein-coupled receptors, but whose structure most closely resembles that of the alpha 2ARs. Competition curve analysis of the binding properties of the receptor expressed in COS-7 cells with a variety of adrenergic ligands demonstrates a unique alpha 2AR pharmacology. Hybridization with somatic cell hybrids shows that the gene for this receptor is located on chromosome 2. Northern blot analysis of various rat tissues shows expression in liver and kidney. The unique pharmacology and tissue localization of this receptor suggest that this is an alpha 2AR subtype not previously identified by classical pharmacological or ligand binding approaches.\r"

  ".W": "Ten proteins that span a wide range of phosphorescence lifetimes were examined for sensitivity to quenching by four agents of disparate chemical nature. The results show that quenching efficiency is relatively independent of the quencher and is highly correlated with depth of burial of the phosphorescent tryptophan. The bimolecular quenching rate constants (kq) measured for the different proteins, spanning 5 orders of magnitude in kq, are found to decrease exponentially with the distance (r) of the tryptophan in angstroms from the protein surface--i.e., kq = Aexp(-r/rho), where A contains a geometrical factor dependent on tryptophan burial and surface geometry [corrected]. Theoretical analysis shows that this behavior can be expected for an electron-exchange reaction between the buried tryptophans and quenchers in solution in the rapid diffusion limit. Therefore, the results obtained provide evidence for an exponential dependence of electron-transfer rate on distance in a protein environment and evaluate the distance parameter, rho, for electron transfer through the general protein matrix at 1.0 A. For a unimolecular donor-acceptor pair with ket = koexp(-r/rho), ko approximately 10(9) sec-1.\r"

  ".W": "In accord with a set of prespecified principles of cell synchrony induction, a three-step procedure was developed to arrest cells reversibly in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Cultures of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were presynchronized in early S phase by sequential treatment with isoleucine deficiency and hydroxyurea blockades; then they were switched to medium supplemented with either of two agents that inhibit DNA topoisomerase II activity by different mechanisms, Hoechst 33342 at 7.5 micrograms/ml for 12 hr or VM-26 at 0.5 micrograms/ml for 8 hr. Up to 95% of the cells accumulated in G2 phase under those conditions. After switch of Hoechst 33342-treated cells to drug-free medium, the cells divided as a highly synchronized cohort of cells within 3 hr. Up to 85% of the cells in a culture of human diploid dermal fibroblasts (HSF-55 cells) could be accumulated in G2 phase by placing cells presynchronized in early-S phase in medium containing Hoechst 33342 at 0.1 micrograms/ml for 10 hr. Reversal of G2 arrest in the HSF-55 cultures resulted in cells dividing synchronously over 3.5 hr. By varying the concentration of Hoechst 33342 and the duration of the treatment period, it was possible to alter the position within G2 phase at which cells accumulated. This synchronization protocol should greatly facilitate study of G2/M biochemical events in mammalian cells, in particular, those associated with cdc2 gene regulation of the onset of mitosis.\r"

Beta 2-Adrenergic receptors, but not beta 1-adrenergic receptors colocalize with \"whisker barrels\" in this tissue. Thus, each whisker sends a specific multisynaptic pathway to the somatosensory cortex that can be histochemically visualized and only one subtype of beta-adrenergic receptor is specifically associated with this cortical representation. Additionally, neonatal lesion of any or all of the whisker follicles results in loss of the corresponding barrel(s) as shown by histochemical markers. This loss is paralleled by a similar loss in the organization of beta 2-adrenergic receptors in the somatosensory cortex. Other results indicate that these beta 2-adrenergic receptors are not involved in moment-to-moment signal transmission in this pathway and, additionally, are not involved in a gross way in the development of whisker-barrel array.\r"

  ".W": "The mitochondrial uncoupling protein (UCP) is a membranous proton carrier exclusively synthesized in brown adipocytes. The cDNA for the rat UCP was placed in an expression vector and transfected into mammalian cells. Its expression was tested in transiently transfected CHO cells. In these cells the UCP was detected in mitochondria by using antibodies. Permanent expression of the UCP was achieved in stable transformed CHO cell lines. In these cells the UCP was characterized in mitochondrial membranes, by using antibodies and hydroxyapatite purification. The protein expressed in CHO cells displayed the functional characteristics of brown adipocyte UCP. It induced the uncoupling of respiration in isolated CHO mitochondria. The membrane potential of transformed mitochondria was also significantly lowered, as a result of the proton translocating activity of the UCP. GDP is known to inhibit the proton pathway in brown fat mitochondria. Addition of GDP to CHO mitochondria containing UCP resulted in a recoupling of respiration and an increase in membrane potential. Thus we conclude that functional UCP is expressed in CHO cells and that the insertion of the UCP alone in any mitochondria is sufficient to induce the uncoupling of respiration. This approach should allow studies on the structure-function relationship of the UCP and of several other related mitochondrial carriers.\r"

  ".W": "A temporal sequence of interrelated cellular, biochemical, and molecular events which occurs during the progressive expression of the differentiated osteoblast phenotype in primary cultures of fetal rat calvarial cells results in the development of a bone-tissue-like organization. This ordered developmental sequence encompasses three periods: proliferation, matrix maturation, and mineralization. Initially, the cells actively proliferate and synthesize type I collagen. This is followed by a period of matrix organization and maturation and then by a period of extracellular matrix mineralization. At the completion of proliferation, when expression of osteoblast phenotype markers such as alkaline phosphatase is observed, the cell-cycle-related histone genes are down-regulated transcriptionally, suggesting that a key signaling mechanism at this transition point involves modifications of protein-DNA interactions in the regulatory elements of these growth-regulated genes. Our results demonstrate that there is a selective loss of interaction of the promoter binding factor HiNF-D with the site II region of an H4 histone gene proximal promoter that regulates the specificity and level of transcription only when the down-regulation of proliferation is accompanied by modifications in the extracellular matrix that contribute to progression of osteoblast differentiation. Thus, this specific loss of protein-DNA interaction serves as a marker for a key transition point in the osteoblast developmental sequence, where the down-regulation of proliferation is functionally coupled to the appearance of osteoblast phenotypic properties associated with the organization and maturation of an extracellular matrix that becomes competent to mineralize.\r"

  ".W": "After exposure to low density lipoprotein (LDL) that had been minimally modified by oxidation (MM-LDL), human endothelial cells (EC) and smooth muscle cells (SMC) cultured separately or together produced 2- to 3-fold more monocyte chemotactic activity than did control cells or cells exposed to freshly isolated LDL. This increase in monocyte chemotactic activity was paralleled by increases in mRNA levels for a monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) that is constitutively produced by the human glioma U-105MG cell line. Antibody that had been prepared against cultured baboon smooth muscle cell chemotactic factor (anti-SMCF) did not inhibit monocyte migration induced by the potent bacterial chemotactic factor f-Met-Leu-Phe. However, anti-SMCF completely inhibited the monocyte chemotactic activity found in the media of U-105MG cells, EC, and SMC before and after exposure to MM-LDL. Moreover, monocyte migration into the subendothelial space of a coculture of EC and SMC that had been exposed to MM-LDL was completely inhibited by anti-SMCF. Anti-SMCF specifically immunoprecipitated 10-kDa and 12.5-kDa proteins from EC. Incorporation of [35S]methionine into the immunoprecipitated proteins paralleled the monocyte chemotactic activity found in the medium of MM-LDL stimulated EC and the levels of MCP-1 mRNA found in the EC. We conclude that (i) SMCF is in fact MCP-1 and (ii) MCP-1 is induced by MM-LDL.\r"
