  ".W": "The influence of morphologic parameters on the recurrence of stenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of 49 stenoses in aortocoronary venous bypass grafts of 41 patients was investigated. Vessel dimensions were measured quantitatively. Angioplasty was successful in 46 stenoses (94%) of 38 patients (93%). In 35 patients (92% of successfully treated patients) with 42 stenoses, control angiography was performed after a mean interval of 189 +/- 186 days. In 9 patients (26%), 9 stenoses (21%) had recurred. The diameter of the grafted coronary artery distal to the anastomosis was significantly smaller in grafted arteries with than without recurrent stenoses (1.92 +/- 0.52 vs 2.45 +/- 0.50 mm; p less than 0.01). Recurrence also correlated with the ratio between graft diameter and coronary artery diameter greater than 1.35 (p less than 0.02) and with the stenosis length greater than 10 mm before angioplasty (p less than 0.01). Graft age, graft diameter and stenosis location in the graft had no significant influence on recurrence. Thus, the diameter of the grafted coronary artery and the length of the critical stenosis are parameters for recurrence after angioplasty of graft stenoses and should be considered in the selection of patients for this intervention.\r"

Forty-one patients who were participants in a 3-month cardiac rehabilitation program were compared with 100 patients who did not participate in a formal program. On average, patients in both groups were well educated, older Caucasians who had minimal cardiac dysfunction (New York Heart Association class I or II). Patients in the 2 groups were not different at baseline in sociodemographic or clinical characteristics or in any of the dependent measures of anxiety, depression, psychosocial adjustment to illness or marital adjustment. Six months after initial testing, patients who attended cardiac rehabilitation were significantly less anxious (F[1,139] = 5.09, p = 0.03), less depressed (F[1,139] = 8.39, p = 0.004), had better psychosocial adjustment (F[1,139] = 5.87, p = 0.02), and were more satisfied with their marriages (F[1,139] = 8.6, p = 0.004) than nonparticipants. The findings support the effectiveness of group cardiac rehabilitation for this subgroup of patients in facilitating their psychosocial recovery after an acute cardiac event.\r"

Patients were randomized to either sotalol or placebo as initial treatment, and if the SVT was not terminated a crossover was performed after 20 minutes. A total of 43 patients were enrolled, 38 of whom with spontaneous (n = 14) or induced (n = 24) SVT were analyzed for sotalol efficacy. Most patients (n = 27) had atrioventricular (AV) nodal reentrant tachycardia, and an important subgroup (n = 11) had circus movement tachycardia, using an accessory pathway for retrograde conduction. The number of patients converting to sinus rhythm as a result of the initial treatment was significantly higher in the sotalol group than in the placebo group, for spontaneous (p less than 0.005) as well as for induced tachycardia (p less than 0.001). Sinus rhythm was achieved within 30 minutes in 83% of all patients who received sotalol as the first drug, compared with 16% of the patients first receiving placebo (p less than 0.0001). For sotalol safety analysis, 42 patients were included. A total of 37 patients received sotalol, 19 as the first treatment, and 18 as the second treatment, while 25 patients received placebo. A total of 15 possible adverse effects were reported, occurring in 10 patients with sotalol versus 4 with placebo. The only severe side effect (hypotension) necessitating termination of drug administration occurred with placebo. No proarrhythmic effects were observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The present study was undertaken to reassess prospectively the immediate and long-term results of direct-current electrical cardioversion in chronic atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, and to determine factors predicting clinical outcome of the arrhythmia after direct-current cardioversion. Two-hundred forty-six patients underwent direct-current electrical cardioversion and were followed during a mean of 260 days. Multivariate analysis was used to identify factors predicting short- and long-term arrhythmia outcome. Cardioversion was achieved in 70% of patients with atrial fibrillation and in 96% of patients with atrial flutter. Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that arrhythmia duration (p less than 0.001), type of arrhythmia (fibrillation vs flutter, p less than 0.02) and age (p less than 0.05) independently influenced conversion rate. On an actuarial basis, 42 and 36% of patients remained in sinus rhythm during 1 and 2 years, respectively. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that the type of arrhythmia (p = 0.0008), low precardioversion functional class (p = 0.002) and the presence of nonrheumatic mitral valve disease (p = 0.03) independently increased the length of the arrhythmia-free episode. Rheumatic heart disease shortened this period (p = 0.03). In conclusion, patients having a high probability of conversion together with a prolonged post-shock arrhythmia-free episode can be identified. This may improve the cost-benefit ratio of cardioversion.\r"

Ten survivors developed cardiac arrest during or after sporting activities (group A) and 7 others during or after an exercise stress test (group B). There were 15 men and 2 women. The mean age of group A was 46 years and of group B 55 years. Coronary risk factors, as well as previous angina and myocardial infarction, were more frequent in group B. Only 3 of the 17 survivors had anginal symptoms before sudden death. Sudden death in group A was associated with acute myocardial infarction in 8 and unstable angina in 2 and was associated in group B with acute myocardial infarction in 2, unstable angina in 3 and silent ischemia in 2. Coronary angiography was acutely performed in 15 patients. In most patients the ischemia-related coronary artery was totally or subtotally occluded. Clinical and angiographic findings indicate that exercise-related sudden ischemic death was due to an acute coronary event--in most cases unexpected and unpredictable. It is suggested that exercise-induced intracoronary changes were probably responsible for the development of acute coronary (sub)occlusion and sudden death.\r"

Of the 72 subjects, 19 (12 men and 7 women) had a family history of hypertension and were compared with 19 subjects without a family history of hypertension who were matched for systolic BP and gender. There were no detectable differences in 2-hour average BP, left ventricular (LV) mass or wall thickness, or echocardiographic systolic functional indexes between subjects with and without a family history of hypertension. Doppler-derived diastolic functional indexes demonstrated more prominent late diastolic filling in subjects with a family history of hypertension.

Diastolic function, as assessed by diminished normalized early peak filling rate and prolonged duration of rapid filling, was decreased in hypertensive patients compared with normotensive patients (p = 0.02). When compared with lean patients with similar blood pressure levels, obese patients exhibited a lower normalized peak filling rate (p = 0.0014) but no difference in duration of rapid filling. A significant correlation was observed between the normalized peak filling rate and either body mass index or left ventricular (LV) mass (r = 0.355 and r = -0.32, respectively; p less than 0.001). Obese patients had greater LV end-diastolic and systolic dimensions (p less than 0.005 and p less than 0.02, respectively), LV wall thickness (p less than 0.05) and LV mass (p less than 0.007) than lean patients. Impairment of LV filling was most pronounced in obese hypertensive patients. It is concluded that the burden on the left ventricle imposed by obesity causes cardiac enlargement and impairment of LV filling regardless of levels of arterial pressure.\r"

This radionuclide study assessed myocardial ischemia and LV function several years after documented coronary occlusion without myocardial infarction. Over 5 years, 24 consecutive patients, who underwent cardiac catheterization for angina pectoris without myocardial infarction, had isolated total occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery with well-developed collateral vessels. Five patients were successfully treated by coronary bypass grafting and 3 by coronary angioplasty. Among the 16 medically treated patients, 1 was lost to follow-up and 1 died (extracardiac death). The mean (+/- standard deviation) follow-up (14 patients) was 48 +/- 15 months. At follow-up, 8 patients still had clinical chest pain, 11 received antianginal therapy, 4 patients had no stress ischemia and the other 10 had greater than or equal to 1 sign of stress ischemia. All patients had a normal LV ejection fraction at rest (mean 60 +/- 3%; range 55 to 65%). Collateral circulation preserves LV function at the time of occlusion and, in some cases, prevents the development of myocardial ischemia; in patients with persisting myocardial ischemia after well-collateralized coronary occlusion, LV function is not impaired at long-term follow-up.\r"

At the end of the 100-day follow-up period, the cumulative probability of survival in patients with coronary artery disease or with dilated cardiomyopathy decreased in the captopril group (90.3%) when compared with the enalapril group (97.2%). The excess mortality in the captopril group could not be related to the indexes of the severity of heart failure, such as baseline exercise duration, functional class, cardiothoracic ratio, ejection fraction or dose of diuretic drugs. Furthermore, the excess in mortality was seen in all subsets of patients examined as well as across countries. Examination of the dosing regimen used, however, suggests that insufficient daily dosage of captopril or the inadequate schedule of administration, or both, might be responsible for different degrees of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition between the enalapril and captopril groups and hence for the difference in mortality. It is important in future clinical trials to determine to what extent complete circadian angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition is necessary to provide the full benefit of this therapy in heart failure.\r"

Previous studies have been unable to predict 1-year outcome because of limited acute and follow-up clinical, invasive and echocardiographic data. The purpose of this study was to predict long-term outcome based on comprehensive data obtained at the time of valvuloplasty and at 3 and 6 months after the procedure. Of 170 consecutive patients undergoing BAV, 108 (mean age 78 years) were at least 1 year from their procedure. Prospective clinical, micromanometer hemodynamic, digital ventriculographic and echocardiographic/Doppler data were collected at baseline and immediately after the procedure. Echocardiographic data were also obtained at 3 and 6 months. With use of Cox model analysis, major events (defined as cardiac death [n = 30], aortic valve replacement [n = 21] or repeat BAV [n = 13]) were predicted by advanced age, baseline heart failure class, and baseline echocardiographic-determined diastolic left ventricular diameter. Only baseline left ventricular ejection fraction proved to be a significant predictor of cardiac death (p = 0.002) in a multivariate model. Absolute values after BAV (stroke work, first derivative of left ventricular pressure, valve area, end-systolic volume, Fick cardiac output, transvalvular gradient) and acute changes measured by catheterization or echocardiography did not provide additional predictive information over that of post procedure ejection fraction. Similarly, echocardiographic valve area and transvalvular gradient at 3 months added no further prognostic data. With an ejection fraction greater than or equal to 45% (n = 63), cardiac survival at 1 year was 80%, irrespective of age, sex, congestive heart failure class or severity of coronary artery disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Beta-adrenergic receptors were examined using crude membrane in LV papillary muscle obtained at mitral valve replacement. Cardiac function was evaluated at preoperative cardiac catheterization with the interval to surgery of 1 to 33 months (average 7). Beta-adrenergic receptor density in 7 patients with New York Heart Association class II or III congestive heart failure was higher than that in 3 patients with class IV heart failure (59 +/- 19 vs 37 +/- 3 fmol/mg protein, p less than 0.05). Beta-adrenergic receptor density showed a positive correlation with end-systolic stress/end-systolic volume index ratio, the index for contractile function (p less than 0.005). Other parameters such as cardiac index, pulmonary artery wedge pressure and LV ejection fraction had no significant correlation to beta-adrenergic receptor. The results demonstrated that increases in symptom and LV dysfunction, particularly of the contractile state, was associated with decreased myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor density from possible down-regulation in patients with chronic mitral regurgitation with or without aortic regurgitation.\r"

To this end, sex-specific linear regression analyses were used to examine the contribution of diabetes mellitus and glucose intolerance to age-adjusted echocardiographic parameters in 1,986 men (mean age 48 years) and 2,529 women (mean age 50 years) from the original Framingham Study cohort and the Framingham Offspring Study. Subjects with evidence of cardiovascular disease at the time of echocardiogram were excluded. Diabetics had higher heart rates than nondiabetics (67.9 vs 64.0 beats/min (p = 0.002) in men, and 73.1 vs 68.3 beats/min (p = 0.004) in women). Diabetic women had increased left ventricular (LV) wall thickness (18.7 vs 17.1 mm, p less than 0.001), relative wall thickness (0.403 vs 0.377, p = 0.008), LV end-diastolic dimension (46.9 vs 45.7 mm, p = 0.03) and LV mass corrected for height (100.4 vs 82.2 g/m, p less than 0.001). Women with glucose intolerance showed similar, less significant trends (p = 0.007 for wall thickness, p less than 0.01 for LV mass). In diabetic men, fractional shortening was slightly reduced (0.355 vs 0.360, p less than 0.05). In a multivariate model that included potentially confounding factors, diabetes remained an independent contributor to LV mass (p = 0.004) and wall thickness (p = 0.008) in women. In a separate linear regression model, which assessed the association of age with LV mass, the age-coefficient for diabetic women was much higher than that for nondiabetics (13.6 vs 6.6 g/m per 10-year increment in age).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Forty-eight cases of infective endocarditis (IE) that occurred in 42 patients with congenital heart disease were reviewed from 1970 through 1990 and were compared with a 20-year review of 108 cases diagnosed between 1953 and 1972. The review demonstrates that the natural history of IE in children has changed over the last 2 decades, with half of the cases occurring after surgery for congenital heart disease. In the postoperative group, 46% of patients had undergone valve replacement and 7 of these (29%) had a right ventricular to pulmonary artery valved conduit as the site for IE, suggesting significant additional risk in this setting. Among patients with nonsurgically treated congenital heart disease and IE, mitral valve prolapse has emerged as an important underlying heart lesion occurring in 29% of patients. The bacterial spectrum has shifted, with a significant increase in the incidence of uncommon causative organisms. Mortality has continued to decline with survivorship of 90% in this series.\r"

  ".W": "Left ventricular (LV) diastolic filling pattern of obese subjects with eccentric LV hypertrophy was studied. Findings were compared with those of normal control subjects and hypertensive patients with concentric LV hypertrophy. M-mode, 2-dimensional and Doppler echocardiograms were recorded in 11 obese (body mass index greater than 30 kg/m2) normotensive patients with eccentric LV hypertrophy, 10 normal control subjects, and 18 nonobese, hypertensive patients with concentric LV hypertrophy whose antihypertensive medications were discontinued 2 weeks before study. LV hypertrophy was defined as LV mass/height greater than 143 g/m. Hypertrophy in the obese patients was eccentric: Their LV internal dimension (61 +/- 3 mm) was greater than that of hypertensive patients (55 +/- 5 mm, p less than 0.001) and normal control subjects (55 +/- 2 mm, p less than 0.01); their septal (10.7 +/- 0.7 mm) and posterior (10.9 +/- 0.6 mm) wall thicknesses were smaller than those of the hypertensive patients (12.2 +/- 1.7 mm, p less than 0.05 and 11.7 +/- 1.2 mm, respectively, difference not significant). Pulsed-wave Doppler echocardiographic filling indexes were used to evaluate LV diastolic filling. Obese patients had a higher peak velocity of atrial filling (69 +/- 14 vs 54 +/- 15 cm/s, p less than 0.05), lower early/atrial filling velocity ratio (1.0 +/- 0.26 vs 1.32 +/- 0.21, p less than 0.05), prolonged deceleration half-time (108 +/- 9 vs 86 +/- 15 ms, p less than 0.01) and lower peak filling rate corrected to stroke volume (4.08 +/- 0.68 vs 4.96 +/- 0.88 stroke volume/s, p less than 0.05) than normal control subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Because handrail support reduces the energy cost of treadmill walking, claudication and hemodynamic responses of patients with peripheral vascular occlusive disease should also be affected. Furthermore, the reliability of the test results may be reduced unless the same pressure is applied to the handrails over repeated tests. The effect of handrail support on claudication and hemodynamic responses, and on their reliability, were examined during single-stage (2 mph, 12% grade) and progressive (2 mph, 0% grade with 2% increase every 2 minutes) treadmill protocols. Ten patients with stable disease performed both protocols 3 times, separated by 1 week, with and without handrail support. Claudication pain distance and maximal walking distance were greater (p less than 0.05) when handrail support was permitted, and they increased (p less than 0.05) over repeated tests of each protocol. No increase was noted over the tests without support. The responses and reliability of foot transcutaneous oxygen tension, ankle systolic pressure and ankle/brachial systolic pressure index after exercise to maximal tolerable pain were not affected by handrail support. Because claudication distances were altered, it is concluded that handrail support should not be allowed when assessing claudicants, unless balance cannot otherwise be maintained.\r"

Eight adults (three men, five women) ate a high-carbohydrate (60% of calories from carbohydrate) and a high-fat (60% of calories from fat) diet for 7 d each according to a randomized, crossover design. Six subjects were studied for an additional week on a mixed diet (45% of calories from fat). For each subject, total caloric intake was identical on all diets and was intended to provide the subject's maintenance energy requirements. All subjects spent days 3 and 7 of each week in a whole-room indirect calorimeter. Diet composition did not affect total daily energy expenditure but did affect daily nutrient oxidation by rapidly shifting substrate oxidation to more closely reflect the composition of the diet. These results show that diet composition can affect substrate oxidation without producing measurable effects on total energy expenditure.\r"

Fat-controlled diets were prescribed, one with and one without a fish-oil supplement (control diet), successively during 3 wk in random order. Total calorie, fat, and cholesterol intakes were similar in the two diets. Triglycerides in serum and very-low-density lipoproteins were lower and high-density-lipoprotein 2 cholesterol was higher with the n-3 PUFA-supplemented diet. These effects as well as a significant decrease in platelet aggregation can be considered beneficial in terms of cardiovascular risk. However, significant increases in low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and PAI activity occurred and were correlated. This latter effect could be detrimental.\r"

Significant decreases (P less than 0.05) were observed in the numbers of total leukocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes from 1 to 2 wk of the VLED and onward. Only lymphocyte counts returned to baseline levels with refeeding. The proportions of other monoclonal-antibody-defined mononuclear cell populations (except a small decrease in CD4+) did not change during dieting. [3H]Thymidine uptake by mononuclear cells cultured for 96 h decreased significantly (P less than 0.05) at wk 6 in response to concanavalin A, phytohemagglutinin, and pokeweed mitogen and after only 1 wk to phorbol myristate acetate + ionomycin. Delayed-type-hypersensitivity skin-test responses did not decrease at wk 5 vs those at baseline. The VLED produced nonspecific decreases in circulating leukocyte numbers and in vitro responses to several mitogens (of different cell-subset specificity), suggesting that in susceptible individuals or if there is longer exposure to such diets, such responses could assume clinical significance.\r"

In 1971 the baseline population consisted of 175 normoglycemic subjects. During the follow-up period (1972-1975) an oral glucose-tolerance test (OGTT) was carried out annually. In univariate analyses, baseline BMI and the habitual intake of carbohydrates and pastries, as determined from a cross-check dietary history, were positively associated with the incidence of glucose intolerance. The habitual intake of legumes was inversely related to the incidence of glucose intolerance. These results could not be explained by potential confounding factors such as age, gender, alcohol use, energy intake, prescribed diet, medication use, and comorbidity. These results suggest that energy balance and the use of carbohydrate-rich foods are related to the development of glucose intolerance in an elderly population.\r"

Lactulose raised day-long concentrations of breath hydrogen and serum glutamine as indicators of increased colonic fermentation by 78 +/- 13% (P less than 0.001) and 24.7 +/- 9.5% (P less than 0.05), respectively). Unexpectedly, however, fasting serum total and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B concentrations were higher at 2 wk by 8.9 +/- 1.5% (P less than 0.001), 10.9 +/- 2.2% (P less than 0.005), and 18.9 +/- 5.9% (P less than 0.02), respectively, compared with the control diet. With lactulose, mean free fatty acid concentrations were reduced over the day by 19.5 +/- 5.9% (P less than 0.02), with no change in mean day-long blood glucose, serum insulin, or C-peptide concentrations. We conclude that certain rapidly fermented substrates may raise rather than lower serum lipids, possibly through increasing the amount of acetate absorbed from the colon.\r"

The difference between whole milk and the LR milks was statistically significant (P less than 0.05) but there was no difference between any of the LR milks. Whole milk provoked symptoms in most subjects whereas 95% LR milk produced none. Only one of six subjects reacted to the 50% and 80% LR milks. The results suggest that a 50% level of lactose reduction in milk may be adequate to relieve the signs and symptoms of milk intolerance in the majority of healthy adults with lactose malabsorption.\r"

The effects of zinc and manganese on iron absorption were studied in human subjects by using paired observations and a dual-radioisotope method (55Fe and 49Fe). Manganese inhibited iron absorption both in solutions and in a hamburger meal. Fractional iron absorption is strongly dose dependent. Adding 2.99 mg Mn to 0.01 mg Fe reduced iron absorption to the same extent as increasing the iron dose 300-fold to 3 mg, strongly indicating a direct competitive inhibition of manganese on iron absorption. In the same experiment with zinc, no inhibitory effect was observed, suggesting different pathways for the absorption of zinc and iron. An intraluminal interaction may occur, because a fivefold excess of zinc to iron (15 mgZn/3 mg Fe) reduced iron absorption by 56% when given in a water solution but not when given with a hamburger meal.\r"

Alcohol intake was independently associated with increased risk of both hip and forearm fractures and with a dose-response relation. Compared with nondrinkers, women consuming greater than or equal to 25 g alcohol/d had an RR of 2.33 (95% CI = 1.18-4.57) for hip fractures and an RR of 1.38 (95% CI = 1.09-1.74) for forearm fractures.

Lean women had proportionally less adipose tissue in the lower thorax and upper abdomen than did obese women. Reducing the number of MRI scans from 17 to 4 did not increase the residual SD of predicted body adipose tissue (2.9 percent) when body density was used as the reference measure. MRI gave an estimate of total-body adipose tissue significantly closer to the value for fat percent produced when the results from five other techniques (skinfold thickness, underwater weighing, 40K whole-body counting, isotopic water dilution, and tetrapolar bioelectrical impedance) were averaged than when any other technique was used alone. MRI-determined percent body adipose tissue in women is close to, and proportional to, estimates derived by underwater weighing.\r"

In 36 healthy males, resistance and reactance at three frequencies were compared with extra-cellular water (ECW) and total body water (TBW) determined by isotope dilution. ECW was best predicted by resistance measured at 5 kHz, corrected for height and weight (R = 0.930, SEE = 1.94 L) whereas TBW was best predicted by resistance at 100 kHZ and weight (R = 0.947, SEE = 2.64 L). Cross-validation analysis on two randomly selected subsets (n = 18 each) indicated that the prediction equations were reproducible and valid. Thus, BI at dual frequencies is valid for determination of body-water compartments and may be useful in the nutritional assessment of patients in whom body water and hydration is of clinical concern.\r"

Predicted basal energy expenditure (PBEE), body surface area (BSA), and body weight correlated significantly with REE (r2 = 0.76). Days postburn and burn size (% BSA burned) only accounted for 21%, and 24% of the variation in the elevation in REE above PBEE. The single most powerful predictor of REE was PBEE (REE = 1.29 x PBEE); addition of other variables did not improve the prediction. When our recently described activity factor of 1.2 for burn patients is used, the data predict that the average energy requirement to maintain energy balance is 1.55 x PBEE, which is significantly lower than commonly used recommendations, especially for larger burns. The energy required to ensure that 95% of patients achieve energy balance was (1.55 x PBEE) + (2.39 xoff+PBEE0.75), approximately equal to 2 x PBEE. Because the equations presented are derived from measurements of energy expenditure, they represent the most valid approach to estimating energy requirements.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this research was to determine if resting energy expenditure (REE) and exercise energy expenditure (EEE) differed between nonobese female cyclical dieters (n = 11) and nondieting control subjects (n = 12). Dieters were defined as having intermittent periods of caloric restriction (less than or equal to 4184 kJ/d, or less than or equal to 1000 kcal/d) for greater than or equal to 7-10 d four times in the preceding year. Dieters were significantly (P less than 0.01) heavier (66 vs 57 kg) and fatter (26% vs 21% body fat) than controls subjects whereas fat-free tissue was similar in both groups. Dieters had significantly (P less than 0.003) lower relative REE than did control subjects (2.8 vs 3.1 mL O2.kg-1.min-1; 79 vs 92 kJ.kg body wt-1.d-1, or 19 vs 22 kcal.kg body wt-1.d-1) but absolute REE (kJ/d, or kcal/d) was similar. Regardless of the workload examined, relative EEE was significantly (P less than 0.009) lower in dieters than in control subjects whereas absolute EEEs were similar at each workload. Results indicate an increased efficiency of food utilization during exercise in dieters but no difference in absolute REE. In addition, repeated bouts of dieting may alter body composition.\r"

  ".W": "We studied relations between alcohol intake, body mass index, and diet in 89,538 women and 48,493 men in two cohort studies. Total energy increased with alcohol consumption (partial r = 0.11, P less than 0.001), and carbohydrate intake decreased from 153 g/d in abstainers to 131 g/d in women drinking 2.5.0-49.9 g alcohol/d. The decrease in carbohydrate intake was due mainly to decreased sugar consumption with higher alcohol intake (partial r = -0.05, P less than 0.001), reflecting decreased energy consumption from sources excluding alcohol. In men total energy increased with alcohol consumption (partial r = 0.19, P less than 0.001), from 7575.6 (abstainers) to 9821.5 kJ/d (greater than 50 g alcohol/d). Energy intake excluding alcohol varied little with alcohol intake (partial r = 0.003, P = 0.48) but sucrose intake decreased with higher alcohol intake. These data suggest that calories from alcohol were added to energy intake from other sources in men, and that in women, energy from alcohol intake displaced sucrose. The consumption of candy and sugar is inversely related to alcohol intake, raising the possibility that it is related to appetite for alcohol.\r"

Strength index showed declines of approximately 6% for C and EE and gains of approximately 3% and approximately 10% for EEWT and WT, respectively. These clinical trials did not show advantages of any exercise regimen over diet alone for weight loss, body-composition changes, or declines in RMR. Improvements in work capacity were limited and strength improved in groups that participated in strength training.\r"

The recovery rate (Rr) in the Atole villages was 12% higher than in the Fresco villages (P less than 0.05). This effect was above all due to the children in the Atole villages who consumed greater than or equal to 10% of the daily recommended dietary intake of energy (RDI) from the supplement (high-Atole group) and whose total energy intake (including home diet) was 10.5% of the RDI higher than a comparable high-Fresco group with low supplemental energy intake. All those in the high-Atole group whose wasting was due to malnutrition recovered. Much of this recovery (range 29-52%) was due to the increased supplementation. This proportion rose after potential confounding variables were controlled for.\r"

The composition of the antepartum secretion was related to the permeability of the junctional complexes between mammary cells. Significant increases in lactose, glucose, pH, and ionized calcium and significant decreases in protein, sodium, potassium, chloride, and calcium concentrations were observed between 1 and 6 mo. Significant differences among individuals, which persisted through lactation, were observed for the concentrations of sodium, potassium, chloride, and inorganic phosphate. The amount of lactose, ionized calcium, and magnesium transferred to the infant was also characteristic of each mother-infant pair. Our data imply that lactation performance is determined in the first month postpartum.\r"

This is unfortunate because program features are of little consequence if the nutrients calculated are not of acceptable quality. The purpose of this paper is to focus on the evaluation of the nutrient database as the foremost consideration in selecting nutrient-calculation software. Six questions that may be used as a guide for evaluating a nutrient database are presented and discussed.\r"

Postpartum changes in lactose, sodium, and chloride concentrations signalled closure of the paracellular pathway during days 1-2. From days 2 to 4 postpartum, initiation of copious milk secretion was accompanied by significant increases in citrate, free phosphate, glucose, and calcium concentrations and a decrease in pH. During weaning, significant changes in milk protein, lactose, chloride, and sodium concentrations were observed only when milk volume fell below 400 mL/d; more than one feed per day was necessary to maintain milk secretion. Temporal changes in the concentration of other milk components, except glucose and magnesium, were not different in weaning and non-weaning women. Differences between the relation of milk volume and composition during lactogenesis and weaning suggest that volume is differently regulated in the two periods.\r"

Subjects were randomly assigned to either the soy-protein or cow-milk-protein experimental period, with subsequent crossover after a washout period, each period lasting 4 wk. Diets were planned to provide 20% energy as protein, 28% as fat (polyunsaturated:monounsaturated:saturated fatty acids, 1:3:3) and less than 200 mg cholesterol/d. No changes were observed in either plasma cholesterol, low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, or apolipoprotein concentrations. However, the soy beverage significantly reduced the concentrations of triglyceride and very-low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (P less than 0.05) and significantly increased the concentrations of high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and HDL3-C (P less than 0.04 and P less than 0.03, respectively). These results indicate that the administration of soy protein may induce clinically beneficial effects in children with FH.\r"

Good antibody responses to pertussis toxin (PT), filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), and agglutinogens occurred in all age groups after both the third and fourth doses. After the fourth (booster) dose, the mean antibody values in initially seronegative infants vaccinated at 3 to 8 months of age were as follows: anti-PT, 67.8 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay units (EU) per milliliter; anti-FHA, 149.5 EU/mL; the agglutinin titer was 125.6. The values in initially seronegative children vaccinated at 24 to 30 months of age were as follows: anti-PT, 92.9 EU/mL; anti-FHA, 251.7 EU/mL; the agglutinin titer was 275.8. Reactions following immunization were minimal. Except for drowsiness after the first dose in infants, there were no clinically significant differences in reactions between infants and older children. The findings in this study coupled with the recent demonstration of efficacy of this vaccine in 2-year-old children supports the recent Japanese recommendation to lower the age of immunization with acellular pertussis vaccine combined with tetanus and diphtheria toxoids to 3 months.\r"

Overall, PRP-NOMP was highly immunogenic. Geometric mean titers of anti-PRP antibody increased from 0.09 to 3.3 mg/L and 6.6 mg/L following each dose of vaccine, respectively, in the 2- to 18-month age group. Similarly, anti-PRP antibody geometric mean titers increased from 0.12 to 5.9 mg/L in the older than 18-month age group. However, we noted an apparent inverse relationship between vaccine dosages and immune responses following two doses of PRP-NOMP in 2- to 18-month-old children. Anti-PRP antibody geometric mean titers were 12.0, 6.9, and 3.5 mg/L, respectively, after the second dose of vaccine containing 7.5, 15, or 30 micrograms of PRP.

Contrary to the premise, an apparent protective effect against invasive bacterial disease was detected after all childhood vaccinations. However, when adjustment was made for frequency of well-care visits and day-care attendance, no significant relationship was seen between receipt of routine childhood immunizations and risk of invasive heterologous bacterial disease for any individual vaccine, although a statistically significant protective effect was detected within 1 or 3 months after the receipt of any vaccine. Since a decreased risk of invasive bacterial disease was also noted to be related to the receipt of routine well-child pediatric care, other preventive health care measures may be responsible for the apparent immunization protective effect.\r"

First, a case-control comparison was performed with 186 children who had invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b or Streptococcus pneumoniae disease (cases) and 186 healthy controls matched for sex, region of residence, birth date, and number of DTP immunizations. The proportion of cases and controls immunized in the 30-day period before onset of disease for cases or reference date for controls was identical, suggesting no association with DTP immunization. In a second analysis, the occurrence of any illness, particularly infectious diseases, in 104 study subjects was compared for the period 30 days before and after 377 DTP immunizations. The rate of illness before immunization was 53%, and after immunization, 43%, again suggesting no causative effects from DTP immunization. Despite the high rates of invasive bacterial disease and nearly compete DTP immunization status in this population, no consistent relationship could be demonstrated between DTP immunization and susceptibility to infectious diseases.\r"

  ".W": "This report describes and evaluates a 42-station objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) administered to 29 pediatric residents and six medical students. In half of the stations, residents spent 5 minutes performing a clearly defined clinical task while being rated by an observer. In the other half of the stations, they answered questions based on the data just gathered. There were six interviews with real or simulated patients, four physical examinations, six laboratory tests or procedures, and one chart review. Eight rest stops were provided. The results of the OSCE were compared with those of resident performance ratings and the Pediatric Board's in-training examination. The OSCE scores could clearly separate the students from the residents and each class of residents from all others (construct validity). The in-training examination could not separate first-year post-graduate level and second-year postgraduate level residents. Resident performance ratings could distinguish only first-year postgraduate level from third-year postgraduate level residents. Residents uniformly agreed that the OSCE measured important clinical objectives attesting to its content validity. Reliability for the OSCE was calculated at the 0.8 to 0.83 range. It is concluded that valid and reliable clinical examinations in pediatrics are feasible, practical, and highly desirable.\r"

  ".W": "Obesity impairs performance in most athletic events, but the influence of increased body fat on cardiopulmonary function has not been clearly delineated. An understanding of the fatness-fitness relationship is important in the optimal design of exercise programs for obese subjects. In this study, 27 adolescent females with body fat levels ranging from normal to gross obesity were evaluated to determine the impact of adiposity on physiologic factors during maximal and submaximal treadmill walking. Increased skinfold measures correlated significantly with absolute maximal oxygen uptake throughout the range of body fat levels (r = .72), and oxygen consumption per kilogram of body weight and treadmill endurance time both declined as fatness increased (r = -.49 and -.42, respectively). Obesity did not affect submaximal walking economy. These findings indicate that increased fat levels are associated with increased cardiopulmonary exercise capacity, but that functional fitness declines because of the inert load created by excess body fat. Therefore, therapeutic exercise programs for obese adolescents are best designed to increase caloric expenditure and decrease body fat rather than to improve aerobic fitness.\r"

  ".W": "Seasonal variation in growth of normal children has been well described, although the mechanism by which it occurs has not been elucidated. The growth of 52 growth hormone-deficient children treated with synthetic human growth hormone was analyzed. A similar seasonal variation was observed, with mean (+/- SEM) peak growth occurring in the summer (8.2 +/- 0.3 cm/y) and winter (7.7 +/- 0.2 cm/y), and trough growth occurring in the autumn (6.9 +/- 0.3 cm/y). Forty-seven percent of subjects grew minimally during the autumn, and only two children showed peak growth in that season. Individual variations between maximal and minimal growth seasons amounted to 3.5 +/- 0.3 cm/y. The seasonal pattern was statistically significant for the group as a whole, for the prepubertal subgroup, and for the boys. The variation persisted when the first year of treatment was excluded to avoid bias of the initial growth spurt. The season of onset of therapy did not affect total growth during the first year. The demonstration of a seasonal pattern in growth of these children suggests that the seasonal variation may be mediated by peripheral rather than central factors. Paired clonidine-provoked growth hormone levels and an integrated concentration of 24-hour growth hormone levels and serum levels of insulinlike growth hormone I measured in a control group of normally growing children were also analyzed and showed no seasonal variation. This further suggests that peripheral rather than central factors are responsible for the seasonal variation in children's growth.\r"

Most oncologists based their choice of antiemetics on personal experience.

Overall injury rates were slightly higher for children who attended out-of-home child care than for those who do not. This occurred because children who attended out-of-home child care had a higher injury rate during home care than did the children who did not attend out-of-home child care at all. Although out-of-home child care may carry an increased risk of infectious disease relative to home care, it does not appear to carry an increased risk of injury and, in fact, may confer a lower risk.\r"

A logistic regression model was used to estimate the odds ratios for being overweight at 17 years of age for 500-g birth weight categories from less than 2500 g to 4500 g or greater. Information on the ethnic origin, paternal education, birth order, maternal age, and area of residence at birth was available, and these factors were used as possible confounders. The adjusted odds ratios for being overweight (greater than or equal to 90th percentile; body mass index greater than 24.6 kg/m2) and severely overweight (greater than or equal to 97th percentile; body mass index greater than 27.8 kg/m2) at 17 years of age was elevated for the three birth weight categories above the normal reference category of 3000 to 3499 g, with an estimate of 2.16 and 2.30 for male subjects with a birth weight greater than 4500 g and 2.95 and 4.39 for female subjects. The data suggest that higher birth weights correlate strongly with being overweight in late adolescence independently of other factors considered. However, the predictive power of this association is poor.\r"

Many institutions have established a local committee to monitor transfusion practices and audit such practices regularly. To assist in this task, the Pediatric Hemotherapy Committee of the American Association of Blood Banks has developed guidelines for the conduct of pediatric blood transfusion audits. These guidelines, summarized herein, cover transfusion of red blood cells, platelets, white blood cells, fresh-frozen plasma, albumin, and clotting concentrates. The use of cytomegalovirus low-risk and irradiated blood products is also discussed. Throughout the report, special attention is given to the transfusion needs of newborn infants.\r"

Birth weights, gestational ages, post-natal ages, and cardiopulmonary status of all groups at the start of the study were comparable. Continuous infusion of these low doses of dopamine for 3 days after birth did not significantly improve levels of blood gases, acid-base balance, or clinical outcome. In newborns with systemic hypotension, dopamine improved cardiovascular status and caused early return of blood pressure to the normal range. Infusion of low doses of dopamine produced mild to moderate natriuresis and insignificant increases in glomerular filtration rate and urine volume.\r"

There was a consistent and significant increase in epidermal growth factor/creatinine values at the time of diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis compared with baseline values. Epidermal growth factor levels in infants without necrotizing enterocolitis and in early nutrition remained unchanged. These results suggested that urinary epidermal growth factor/creatinine levels may differentiate stage II and III necrotizing enterocolitis from stage I disease. The increased epidermal growth factor/creatinine levels may be related to the absorption into the circulation of preexisting gastrointestinal tract epidermal growth factor through damaged tissue or to increased synthesis by the gastrointestinal tract in response to the injury caused by necrotizing enterocolitis.\r"

We describe a 654-g infant born at 30 weeks' gestation by cesarean section due to severe maternal hypertension. His course was complicated by five episodes of sepsis, including three with group B streptococcus. The results of hematologic and immunologic studies were normal except that absolute neutrophil counts were low (less than 1 x 10(9)/L) with intermittent increases during sepsis. Human recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor administered subcutaneously (10 micrograms/kg per day initially) resulted in an absolute neutrophil count of greater than 30 x 10(9)/L within 2 weeks. The dosage was lowered and the absolute neutrophil counts were maintained at 8 to 12 x 10(9)/L with no further septic episodes. The human recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor therapy was discontinued after 7 months, and the patient remained healthy with an absolute neutrophil count of greater than 2 x 10(9)/L. Thus, treatment with human recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor may be useful as a temporary measure for neonatal neutropenia associated with sepsis. A controlled, clinical trial is warranted.\r"

The duration of mechanical ventilation ranged from 22 to 128 days, and the duration of requirement of supplemental oxygen ranged from 34 to 1033 days. No significant correlations were found between duration of mechanical ventilation or oxygen therapy and overall neurodevelopmental outcome. In contrast, cranial ultrasound findings of intracranial hemorrhage and/or periventricular echodensity related specifically to poorer cognitive outcome. By age 3 years, severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia is not a sufficient predictor of neurodevelopmental outcome. Intracranial hemorrhage and periventricular echodensity continue to be important predictors.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the relationship between lower esophageal sphincter (LES) intraluminal pressure and its intraluminal pH, we studied six healthy volunteers. We recorded intraluminal pressure and pH concurrently using rapid pull-through, slow pull-through, and station pull-through, as well as, rapid push-through and slow push-through techniques. The results showed that LES length was 35 +/- 4 (SE) mm by RPT and 30 +/- 3 mm by SPT. The pressure was maximal in the proximal half of the LES. On rapid pull-throughs, the intraluminal pH rose from about 1.5 to reach a value of about 2.5 at the peak of the high pressure zone. With continued withdrawal into the esophageal body, the recorded pH rose minimally to about 3-4. On push-throughs, the pH recorded along the LES was the same as that of the esophageal body. After the electrode cleared the LES, the pH abruptly fell to gastric pH. During station pull-through with the electrode 0.5-1.5 cm proximal to the distal LES margin, transient pH drops were observed with swallows. With rapid swallows, however, the pH drop did not occur until after the last swallow. This finding suggests that the pH drops with swallows were due to axial LES movement rather than gastroesophageal acid reflux. We conclude that 1) the relationship of the gastroesophageal pH transition zone and LES high pressure zone is better defined by a sphincter push-through than a pull-through; 2) the transition between gastric and esophageal pH occurs either at or slightly distal to the distal LES margin; and 3) swallow-induced axial LES movement may cause spurious recording of acid reflux when the pH probe is positioned within the distal half of the LES.\r"

Nine (14%) rings were detected radiographically only with a solid bolus; eight of these patients had dysphagia and seven rings were 20 mm or less in caliber. Impaction related to ring caliber, and was found in all 17 (100%) rings that were 13 mm or less in diameter, in 17/24 (71%) 14- to 19-mm rings, and in 6/22 (27%) rings 20 mm or more in caliber.

Marshmallow impaction occurred in 17 (74%) of 23 patients who had endoscopy; three of the 23 patients had normal endoscopy. In conclusion, radiographic examination supplemented by the use of a marshmallow bolus best detects lower esophageal mucosal ring.\r"

Unfortunately, these methods carry the risk of radiation exposure and require expensive and complex equipment. Carbon-13, a stable, nonradioactive isotope, has been used successfully as a marker in the gastrointestinal tract for other purposes. A preliminary study using ingested NaH13CO3 and measuring 13CO2 breath excretion suggested that this test might be a simple, noninvasive, and inexpensive method for determining gastric emptying. To determine the efficacy of NaH13CO3 as a noninvasive marker for gastric emptying, the resulting 13CO2 breath excretion was determined simultaneously with standard radiolabeled meal measurements of gastric emptying of liquids and solids in 15 patients. 13CO2 breath excretion did not correlate with the gastric emptying of either solids or liquids, as determined by radionuclide techniques. These results suggest that NaH13CO3 is not a reliable indicator of gastric emptying. Factors other than gastric emptying may affect the rate of 13CO2 absorption and exhalation, rendering it unreliable as a measure of gastric emptying.\r"

  ".W": "Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed 42 times in 38 patients aged 14 months to 20 yr at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh from 1982 to 1990. The adult side-viewing duodenoscope, Olympus JF1T, was used for all procedures. Intravenous sedation was used in 68% of the patients, whereas general anesthesia was employed in the remainder. Visualization of the appropriate ductal system was accomplished in 35 patients (92%). No therapeutic maneuvers were performed at endoscopy. Eleven of the 22 patients with ductal abnormalities underwent surgical treatment, based on the ERCP findings. The only complication encountered was mild pancreatitis in three patients (8%), all with a history of pancreatitis. We conclude that ERCP is a safe, useful procedure in the evaluation of children with pancreaticobiliary disorders, and in the identification of surgically correctable lesions in 29% of those patients.\r"

  ".W": "Sphincter of Oddi motor activity was investigated in seven patients with an anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction and in six controls by endoscopic manometry under fluoroscopy. Characteristic phasic wave activity was observed in the sphincter segment in both groups. Amplitude of the phasic contractions was significantly higher in the disease group than in controls (100.8 +/- 14.1 mm Hg vs. 55.2 +/- 4.3 mm Hg, p less than 0.02). Although those with the anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction had a longer common channel (15-30 mm), the length of the sphincter segment with the phasic wave activity was not different. The phasic activity was not seen at the junction of the pancreatic and bile ducts in disease groups. Bile obtained from within the bile duct showed a very high concentration of amylase. Morphine given to cause spasm of the sphincter increased basal pressure and frequency of the phasic waves in all controls. The response to morphine was similar in two patients in whom the anomalous junction was studied, but the procedure was complicated by acute pancreatitis in one of them. These findings suggest that contractions of the sphincter of Oddi in patients with the anomalous junction may contribute to reflux between the pancreatic and bile ducts, leading to various pathologic conditions associated with this anomaly.\r"

The mucin-hypersecreting tumor was defined as an enlarged major or minor papilla with a dilated orifice and visible mucin oozing on endoscopy. The series consisted of six men and one woman ranging from 47 to 79 yr old. The excretion of mucin through a patulous orifice of the enlarged ampulla of Vater was seen in six patients and of the enlarged minor papilla in the other patient with pancreas divisum. The main pancreatic duct was dilated in all patients. Amorphous mucin was seen in the dilated duct of five patients, and papillary nodules were present in two patients. Computed tomography and/or ultrasonography showed dilatation of the main pancreatic duct with multilocular cysts in six patients and with a solid tumor in the other patient. The tumor was located diffusely in the main pancreatic duct in one patient, whereas it was confined to branches in the head (four patients), body (one patient), or tail (one patient) of the pancreas in the six other patients. Histopathologic diagnosis was a cyst lined by hyperplastic mucus-secreting epithelium in one patient, mucinous cystadenoma in two, and mucinous cystadenocarcinoma in two. Five patients underwent resection and have survived for 1-46 months after the operation. The authors would like to emphasize this endoscopic syndrome because about half of mucin-hypersecreting tumors are malignant with a favorable prognosis.\r"

All stones were fragmented and removed from three patients, but one patient died from bronchopneumonia before ductal clearance could be achieved. The procedure was well tolerated, without any complication. The major disadvantage is the multiple maneuvers required and the prolonged hospital stay. Percutaneous transhepatic choledochoscopic electrohydraulic lithotripsy provides a safe and effective alternative for nonoperative treatment of common bile duct stones in high-risk patients when the duodenoscopic approach fails.\r"

In the analysis of 226 first stents, advanced age of patients and higher serum bilirubin levels before insertion were found to be significant unfavorable factors limiting the duration of stent function. Overall, older age, male sex, no stent cleaning, and insertion on three or more occasions were significant unfavorable prognostic factors for patency. The risk of occlusion for stents inserted on three or more occasions was 2.32 times that of the first stent insertion. The median duration of patency of first, second, and subsequent stents was 177, 98, and 97 days, respectively. Diagnosis and the area of stenosis were unrelated to patency. No predictive significance of length or size of stent between 10- and 12-French gauge was found in our study.\r"

The main presenting symptoms were abdominal pain, icterus, and fever, and the classical triad of jaundice, pain, and abdominal mass was seen in only one patient. The mean age of presentation was 25.5 +/- 10.1 yr, and females predominated (82%). Type Ia cysts (fusiform choledochal cyst) were the commonest. Intrahepatic cysts were seen in four patients; three of these were associated with extrahepatic biliary ductal cysts (type IVa). Internal drainage procedures performed elsewhere in six patients were followed by recurrent cholangitis, necessitating excision of the cyst. Hence, the preferred operation for congenital biliary cysts is cyst excision and hepaticojejunostomy.\r"

Biochemically, transferrin content in the Golgi fraction was clearly high in the rats with alcoholic liver injury. Desialo-glycoproteins were found in the serum of rats with alcoholic liver injuries. These results suggested that the glycosylation and secretion of hepatic glycoproteins in the Golgi apparatus were impaired in alcoholic liver injury. These abnormalities in the Golgi apparatus function may be important for the development of alcoholic liver injury.\r"

Liver biopsies revealed severe parenchymal damage in all the cases with piece-meal necrosis, bridging necrosis or bridging fibrosis. In two of four cases, there was a lobular distortion. AFP stain by an immunoperoxidase method showed a positive result in surviving hepatocytes. Lectin affinity electrophoresis of AFP in the four cases, together with an additional 12 patients with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis and 44 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, all having AFP levels above 1,000 ng/ml, revealed that the chronic hepatitis patients had a benign pattern of AFP bands, in contrast with the pattern of hepatocellular carcinoma with increased proportions of lentil lectin-reactive AFP-L3 and/or erythroagglutinating phytohemagglutinin-reactive AFP-P4, indicating that the analysis of lectin reactivity of AFP has a great value in differentiating the benign and malignant conditions with increased serum levels of AFP above 1,000 ng/ml.\r"

In addition, the adr carriers were more often positive for HBeAg and less often positive for anti-HBe than the adw carriers (p less than 0.001). Multivariate analyses indicated that the HBsAg subtypes were associated with liver dysfunction not directly but through the relationship between the HBsAg subtypes and HBeAg/anti-HBe status. HBeAg/anti-HBe status of each age bracket in the adr carriers and in the adw carriers suggested that adr carriers are seroconverted later than adw carriers.

  ".W": "One hundred thirty-two of 980 patients (13.5%) with Crohn's disease (CD) involving the colon, admitted to The Mount Sinai Hospital between 1959 and 1985, developed 175 colonic strictures. Thirty-three patients developed more than one stricture. The frequency was twice as great in colitis (19%) as in ileocolitis (11%). Ten malignant strictures were identified in nine patients (three ileocolitis, six colitis). One of these patients had three strictures (two malignant, and one benign), and two had two strictures (one malignant and one benign). The frequency of cancer in patients with stricture (6.8%) was higher than in those without stricture (0.7%, six of 848, p less than 0.001). There were no differences in clinical symptoms between patients with benign and malignant stricture. Seventeen of 165 benign strictures (10.3%) were long, extending over more than one anatomical segment of colon, but all 10 malignant strictures were short (p less than 0.0001). The age at the diagnosis of stricture was higher in the nine patients with malignant stricture than in the 123 patients with benign stricture (mean age 57.2 vs. 41.4 yr, respectively, p less than 0.01). The proportion of strictures that were malignant increased with duration of disease from 3.3% with less than 20 yr of CD, to 11% with CD of 20 yr or more. All nine patients with malignant stricture were treated surgically, and four of the nine died of colon cancer during a mean follow-up of 4.3 yr. Prognosis was worse in six other nonstricture cancers in this series, with five colon cancer deaths during mean follow-up of 1.6 yr. In view of the high rate of malignancy, 6.8% in this series, colonoscopy with biopsy is essential in Crohn's disease patients with colonic strictures, and surgery must be considered when a stricture cannot be fully assessed during colonoscopy.\r"

Simultaneous objective anal sphincter pressure measurements, when compared with these subjective values, revealed a correlation coefficient of 0.97 (p less than 0.05).

The diagnosis of appendicitis was difficult to make in this patient because of the presumptive diagnosis of tuberculosis ileitis and the frequent presentation of abdominal pain with fever in AIDS patients. Although CMV colitis is frequently seen in AIDS patients, the prevalence of CMV appendicitis is exceedingly rare. The problems related to making a diagnosis of CMV appendicitis and the therapeutic management of CMV infections are reviewed.\r"

At colonoscopy, skip areas with plaques, ulcers, and a pseudopolyp were observed. The colitis resolved endoscopically after a 6-wk course of intravenous amphotericin B, and the patient has had no recurrence of symptoms while on maintenance therapy with amphotericin B. However, the organisms continue to be noted on biopsies of normal-appearing areas in the rectum and sigmoid 5 months after diagnosis. Colonic involvement with H. capsulatum, an organism endemic to the Midwest, may be seen more frequently as the total number of cases of HIV-infected individuals increases in this region.\r"

They then supervised the partner over a series of trials on a visual scan test and could influence the partner by either giving an uncomfortable electric shock (aggressive alternative) or a comfortable vibration (nonaggressive alternative) at each incorrect response from the partner. Both alternatives were said to be equally instrumental in reaching the goal of winning the money and both could be varied in intensity on a 10-point scale and without limits in terms of duration. Aggression was measured as number of aggressive responses chosen, and in terms of intensity and duration. Nonaggression was measured in terms of intensity and duration. Intoxicated subjects did not increase their aggression but all groups chose significantly more nonaggressive responses and did so with higher intensity and duration. Frustration did not significantly affect these types of responding. Results are discussed in terms of methodological considerations and the importance of using realistic experimental paradigms is stressed. Also, theoretical implications are discussed.\r"

Rats were pretreated intraperitoneally (ip) with varying doses of ethanol or saline 30 min prior to administration of cyanamide (0.68 mmol/kg; ip), 4-hydroxypyrazole (1 mmol/kg; ip) or saline. Rat tissues were perfused in situ under ether anaesthesia. Brain catalase activity was measured using the Clark electrode. Results confirmed inhibition of brain catalase activity by cyanamide and 4-hydroxypyrazole. Ethanol protected catalase from cyanamide and 4-hydroxypyrazole inactivation in a dose-related manner. In a second study, homogenates from perfused brains were incubated in the presence of glucose and glucose oxidase with ethanol or saline and cyanamide or saline. Cyanamide was shown to inhibit the catalase activity in vitro in a dose-related manner. Ethanol prevented this inhibition of catalase when added to the incubation medium prior to cyanamide. These data suggest a competition between ethanol and inhibitors for the H2O2-catalase compound. They also confirm the presence and generation of H2O2 in the rat brain in vivo, and overall seem to support the notion that centrally formed acetaldehyde via brain catalase may be responsible for some of the psychopharmacological actions of ethanol.\r"

When 5% and 10% ethanol solutions were presented as the sole source of fluid (1-bottle test), MR/Har rats, respectively, ingested 15% more, or 9% less, than their baseline water intake, whereas MNRAs ingested 6% less, or 42% less than their baseline intake. However, because MNRA/Har rats drank significantly more water than MR/Har's under ad libitum conditions (MNRA/Har, 46.6 +/- 1.83 ml; MR/Har 32.45 +/- 1.64 ml/24 hr), males and females of the two strains ingested a similar amount of ethanol in the 1-bottle test (5% ethanol, 4-7; 10% ethanol, 6-12 g/kg body weight/24 hr). In 2-bottle free-choice tests administered after an extended period of forced ethanol consumption, MR/Har male and female rats exhibited a strong ethanol preference (X = 80%) and consumed a larger amount of ethanol (MR/Har, 7-13; MNRA/Har, 6-9 g/kg body weight/24 hr) than MNRA/Har's. Across all conditions, females of both strains ingested a greater relative amount of ethanol than males. The strain difference in ethanol preference was found to be independent of prior exposure to ethanol because it was also found when 2-bottle free-choice tests were carried out in naive animals (Experiment 2). The pattern of development of ethanol preference in individual animals was characterized by abrupt onset, after variable periods of exposure to the 2-bottle choice test, and maintenance of strong ethanol preference thereafter. The extensive behavioral and biological definition of the Maudsley strains is a valuable asset in attempting to elucidate the biobehavioral correlates of ethanol preference.\r"

  ".W": "This study reports on the interactive effects of ethanol and caffeine on growth of rat fetal hepatocytes. Exposure of cultured rat fetal hepatocytes (RFH) to ethanol in concentrations above 1 mg/ml, causes a blockade of EGF-dependent cell replication along with an overexpression of surface EGF receptors (EGF-R). However, RFHs exposed for 24 hours to ethanol at a concentration of 1 mg/ml alone had little effect on cell replication. Caffeine, when combined with this concentration of alcohol, progressively impaired RFH growth by up to 100%. Caffeine alone up to 10 micrograms/ml, on the other hand, caused a progressive increase in RFH replication associated with a 69% enhancement of DNA synthesis. Caffeine concentrations in excess of 50 micrograms/ml had no effect on replicative capacity. Concomitant caffeine exposure had no effect on the ethanol-related increase in cell DNA content, yet it caused a further enhancement of the cell protein accural induced by ethanol alone. Caffeine (10 micrograms/ml) alone had no effect on EGF-R expression, while ethanol (2 mg/ml) increased it by almost 200%. Addition of caffeine to ethanol reduced this enhanced EGF binding by 45%. Scatchard analysis indicated that no treatment altered ligand affinity for the receptor, but that the alterations in binding caused by ethanol and the caffeine/ethanol combination reflected changes in binding capacity, in both low and high affinity components. It is concluded that (1) ethanol blocks EGF-mediated replication accompanied by a reduction in DNA synthesis, (2) caffeine alone at low concentrations has the opposite effect and can actually potentiate the EGF-mediated mitogenic response, (3) caffeine in combination with ethanol acts synergistically to reduce RFH replication.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Changes in the water content of the red blood cells and the mean corpuscular volume paralleled these changes but were more closely associated with T2. It is suggested that T1 and T2 may reflect different aspects in water content and free-to-bound ratio of water. The significance of these findings is discussed in the context of changes previously observed in the brains of alcoholic patients, and in rats fed a diet supplemented with alcohol for 6 months.\r"

After 10 and 17 weeks of ethanol exposure about 300 nmol of ethyl esters of oleic, palmitic, stearic, and linoleic acids were found per gram adipose tissue. The ethyl esters disappeared after 1 week of abstinence. Closer analyses, using radioactive ethanol, revealed a half-life of the esters of less than 24 hr. The bulk of the esters was found in a membrane preparation of isolated adipocytes. Hormone-sensitive lipase hydrolyzed emulsified ethyl oleate as efficiently as that of trioleoylglycerol, but in mixed ethyl oleate/trioleoyl glycerol particles the hydrolysis of ethyl oleate was slower, suggesting a decreased accessibility. Synthase activity was found in adipose tissue from rats not exposed to ethanol. It doubled after 10 and 17 weeks of ethanol and decreased with a half-life of at least a week after abstinence. It was concluded that ethyl esters of fatty acids are formed in rat adipose tissue as previously shown in other tissues. They seem to be stored mainly in membranous parts of the adipocytes. Synthase activity is induced by ethanol. The elevated activity has a longer half-life, and may be useful as an indicator of alcohol abuse.\r"

The average age of the treated alcoholics in these three groups ranged from 37 to 51. Between two-thirds and three-quarters were male. Inpatient alcoholism treatment services were more frequently used than outpatient, with inpatient admissions averaging between 1.2 and 1.5 per person. For enrollees of the midwestern manufacturing firm, total alcoholism treatment costs averaged $4,665 per person (December 1985 dollars).

  ".W": "The gastroprotective properties of GM1-ganglioside, an indigenous component of epithelial cell membrane, was investigated. The experiments were conducted with groups of rats with and without indomethacin pretreatment. The animals received intragastrically either a dose of GM1 as emulsion in 5% gum arabic or vehicle alone, followed by ethanol given at various time intervals up to 3 h after the GM1. The animals were sacrificed 30 min after the ethanol dose and their gastric mucosa subjected to macroscopic and histologic assessment, and physicochemical measurements. In the absence of GM1, ethanol caused extensive gastric hemorrhagic lesions which were significantly reduced by pretreatment with GM1 at dose as low as 70 micrograms/100 g body weight. Removal of sialic acid from GM1 led to the loss of gastroprotection. Furthermore, the effect of GM1 was not thwarted by indomethacin. The maximal protection was achieved 1 h following GM1 dose and this protective effect persisted at least 2.5 hr. The results of physicochemical measurements revealed that GM1 was capable of preventing the detrimental effect of indomethacin on the adherent mucus gel dimension, and on its content of sulfo- and sialomucins, protein, and phospholipids. The effects brought by GM1 were also accompanied by a significant (40-60%) increase in mucus gel viscosity, hydrogen ion retardation capacity (35-46%) and hydrophobicity (70-94%). The results indicate that the gastroprotective action of GM1 occurs through the enhancement of the physicochemical characteristics of the mucus layer, and does not appear to be mediated by endogenous prostaglandins.\r"

Because beta-sitosterol is the most plentiful, being present in bourbon at microgram/dl quantities, we have chosen to begin our quantitation work with this compound. The variability of the amount of beta-sitosterol contained in various brands of bourbon and in different lots of the same brand of bourbon have been assessed using combined gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) for quantitation following a simplified procedure to extract compounds of interest from bourbon.\r"

  ".W": "We have reported previously that chronic alcohol consumption in the rat produced elevated total serum high density lipoprotein (HDL) fraction, but HDL particles of the alcohol-fed rat were deficient in apolipoprotein (apo) E. In that report, serum HDL particles were prepared by successive ultracentrifugation method and there were concerns that the apo E deficiency in HDL particles was artificially produced by centrifugal forces. In the present report, apo Al affinity column chromatography was used instead of successive ultracentrifugation and it likewise yielded HDL particles from alcohol-fed rats that exhibited lower apo E: apo Al ratio than HDL from control rats (0.185 +/- 0.016 vs. 0.303 +/- 0.017, respectively). When the total serum lipoprotein fraction (d less than 1.21) was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), both HDL and VLDL peaks were higher in alcohol-fed rats than controls. The size of apo E deficient HDL particles from alcohol-fed rats determined by HPLC did not differ from that of normal HDL particles. When HDL (1.063 less than d less than 1.21) was subfractionated into HDL2 (1.063 less than d less than 1.125) and HDL3 (1.125 less than d less than 1.21), only HDL2 of alcohol-fed rats showed lowered apo E: apo Al ratio when compared with same HDL subfraction of control animals. Therefore, the molecular structure of only HDL2 (but not HDL3) was affected by alcohol-feeding. Another HDL subpopulation which is enriched with apo E, i.e. HDL1 (1.054 less than d less than 1.063), was also prepared.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The lines did not differ in inhibition of [3H]-TBOB binding by pentobarbital, phenobarbital, muscimol or picrotoxin. Although the lines displayed almost identical KD and Bmax for [3H]-diazepam binding, the GABA agonist, muscimol, was a more potent stimulator of [3H]-diazepam binding in membranes prepared from HAS rats than from LAS rats.

FT-IR spectra were obtained from the liver tissues of the rats pair-fed a nutritionally adequate liquid diet and ethanol/dextrose via an implanted intragastric tube for 6 months. The pressure on the liver samples was raised up to 10 kbar, taking FT-IR spectra at regular increments as the pressure was raised. Total lipids measured by the band derived from the stretching mode of carbonyl groups in lipid (v C = O) were increased 4 times in the liver of ethanol-fed rats (E) compared with the pair-fed control rats (C). The frequency of the C = O band of E decreased with increasing pressure, which indicated that hydrogen-bonding was present on the C = O groups of lipids in E. The intensity of the CH stretching bond of the HC = CH groups was 2.8 times higher in E than that in C, which means that there was an increase in the population of unsaturated double bonds in acyl chains of lipids in E. The conformational structure of the protein molecules was slightly changed in E. The reactivity of carboxylate side groups in proteins observed by reaction with Ba++ ions was higher in E than that in C. These infrared spectroscopic results suggest that chronic ethanol intake induces not only an increase in the amount of total lipid but also changes the composition of lipids and the conformation of protein molecules in the liver of rats.\r"

In this report, we investigated the effects of chronic ethanol treatment and selective breeding for hypnotic sensitivity to ethanol on IP3 and ethanol-stimulated calcium release from brain and liver microsomes. Chronic ethanol treatment did not alter IP3-stimulated calcium release from brain microsomes or ethanol-stimulated calcium release from brain or liver microsomes. Chronic ethanol treatment increased the spontaneous release of calcium from brain but not liver microsomes. In microsomes isolated from cerebellum or cerebral cortex of long-sleep (LS) and short-sleep (SS) mice, ethanol and IP3 released calcium in a concentration dependent manner. The amount of calcium released by ethanol and IP3 was larger in microsomes isolated from cerebellum than microsomes from cerebral cortex. However, the amount of calcium released by ethanol and IP3 did not differ between the two lines in either brain area. These results do not support the idea that the hypnotic effects of ethanol are due to ethanol-induced calcium release from a nonmitochondrial intracellular calcium store in brain tissue. The development of ethanol tolerance and dependence also does not appear to be associated with altered ability of ethanol to release calcium from non-mitochondrial intracellular stores; however, effects of chronic ethanol exposure on spontaneous release of intracellular calcium could alter neuronal function in ethanol dependence.\r"

These changes in neuronal number may reflect ethanol-induced disturbances in early developmental processes, that is in the proliferation of neuronal precursors. Hence, the present study examined the effect of ethanol on cell proliferation in the two neocortical proliferative zones, the ventricular zone (VZ) and subventricular zone (SZ). From gestational day 5 to 21, pregnant rats were fed an ethanol diet (6.7% v/v), pair-fed an isocaloric control diet, or fed chow and water. Pregnant rats were given a series of one to nine injections of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). After immunohistochemical processing, the ratio of cells in each proliferative zone that were labeled with BrdU to the total population was determined. The portion of the population that was cycling (growth fraction), the total length of the cell cycle, and the length of the S-phase of the cell cycle were calculated for VZ and SZ cells. Exposure to moderate levels of ethanol has markedly different effects upon the two neocortical proliferative zones. In the VZ, the length of the total cell cycle was significantly greater in ethanol-treated rats than in controls; however, the growth fraction and the length of the S-phase were unaffected by ethanol. In contrast, in the SZ, the growth fraction was significantly greater in ethanol-treated rats, but ethanol had no effect on the length of the total cell cycle or of the S-phase. These differences may underlie the ethanol-induced abnormalities in neuronal generation.\r"

Neither ethanol nor baclofen alone altered chloride influx. The GABAB antagonists, phaclofen and 2-hydroxy-saclofen, completely blocked the increase in chloride flux produced by ethanol in the presence of either baclofen or GABA. Ethanol increased the chloride conductance produced by the GABAA agonists muscimol, isoguvacine, imidazolacetic acid and amino-propane sulfonic acid and this action of ethanol was blocked by phaclofen. The specific GABAA antagonist, bicuculline, blocked ethanol-induced increase in chloride flux in the presence of either baclofen or GABA. GABA-activated chloride channels were also studied in Xenopus oocytes expressing mouse brain mRNA. In this preparation, GABA action was enhanced by ethanol, pentobarbital, and diazepam, and 2-hydroxy-saclofen partially antagonized the action of ethanol without altering the effects of pentobarbital or diazepam. These results suggest that ethanol enhancement of GABAA receptor-chloride channel function also requires activation of GABAB receptors.\r"

In the present study, we characterized these binding differences further and determined whether similar differences are present in other rodent line pairs produced by selective breeding for differences in ethanol sensitivity. The alcohol-insensitive AT rats had more high-affinity [3H]muscimol binding sites in the cerebellum than the alcohol-sensitive ANT rats. The cerebellar \"diazepam-insensitive\" [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding sites were displaced by several benzodiazepine agonists (diazepam, lorazepam, clonazepam, and midazolam) at micromolar concentrations with greater efficacy in the ANT than the AT rats. Analyses of the displacement curves indicated that the \"diazepam-insensitive\" [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding sites have 30 to 300 times higher affinity to benzodiazepine agonists in the ANT than AT rats. There was no difference between the rat lines in the displacing potency of Ro 15-1788, a weak partial agonist; Ro 15-4513, a partial inverse agonist; or Ro 5-4864, a peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor ligand. Thus, the affinity difference seen in the cerebellar [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding sites seems to be specific for benzodiazepine agonists. This difference in affinity may explain the behavioral difference in sensitivity to lorazepam between the rat lines. No differences in [3H]muscimol binding or in the sensitivity of [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding to micromolar diazepam concentrations were found between other rodent line pairs tested (LS/SS, HAS/LAS, HOT/COLD, FAST/SLOW, AA/ANA).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Alcohol (ETOH) intoxication on the other hand suppresses the immune system and increases susceptibility to infection. Since the liver is the primary site both for metabolism of ETOH and detoxification of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), this investigation was directed at studying the effect of acute ETOH intoxication on the LPS-induced enhancement of in vivo glucose utilization in different types of hepatic cells. Rats were given an intravenous (IV) injection of ETOH followed by a constant infusion for 7 hr to maintain blood alcohol levels at about 175 mg/dl. E. coli LPS was administered IV at 4 hr and in vivo glucose utilization by the different types of liver cells was estimated 3 hr later using the 14C-2-deoxyglucose technique. Hepatocytes (HP), Kupffer (KC), and endothelial cells (EC), as well as the sequestered polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), were separated from the liver by collagenase-pronase digestion followed by centrifugal elutriation and Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation. The number of PMN in the liver was increased several-fold 3 hr after LPS administration. The presence of ETOH did not inhibit the LPS-induced neutrophil migration into the liver. ETOH depressed the LPS-induced increase in glucose uptake in both EC and KC by 50 to 80%, respectively. It also reduced the LPS-induced increase of plasma tumor necrosis factor activity by 80%. ETOH alone did not produce any significant changes in the parameters studied.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Biphasic dose-response curves were obtained for LS and SS mice with the SS mice showing a sedative limb of the dose-response curve shifted to the right. The effects of 2.0 g/kg ETOH were also assessed in a diallel cross of the selected LS/SS lines and C57BL/6Abg and MOLD/RkAbg inbred strains. The 2.0 g/kg dose produced a wide range of responses, from sedation in C57BL/6Abg mice to extreme activation in SS and MOLD/RkAbg mice, and no effect in LS mice. The responses of F1 hybrids reflected a typical pattern of partial dominance, with heterosis in some crosses. When present, dominance was in the direction of greater locomotor activation. These patterns were confirmed by biometrical genetic analysis of the 4 x 4 diallel cross of the two lines and the two inbred strains. The data indicate that loci in addition to those responsible for selection for sedative sensitivity in LS and SS mice can influence locomotor activation produced by sub-hypnotic ETOH doses, and that SS and MOLD mice show locomotor activation for different genetic reasons.\r"

Small dominance effects were typically directional in the direction of more activation, or resistance to sedation. No evidence was found for maternal effects, sex linkage, or epistasis. Sex differences were seen in the increased susceptibility of male mice to locomotor sedation at higher ETOH doses. In the diallel cross, there was no correlation between the degree of activation produced by low ETOH doses and sedation produced by higher doses. This indicates that while considerable genetic influences exist for both activational and sedative domains of ETOH effects, these genetic influences are relatively independent.\r"

Both alcoholism and smoking appear to be influenced by genetic factors but it is not known whether the same or different genes regulate the abuse of ethanol and nicotine. Recent studies have demonstrated that the long-sleep (LS) and short-sleep (SS) mouse lines, which were selectively bred for differences in ethanol-induced anesthesia (\"sleep-time\"), also differ in several effects of nicotine and the muscarinic agonist, oxotremorine. In order to determine whether or not these differences are due to chance, the relative sensitivities of rat lines which were selectively bred for differences in ethanol-induced sleep-time were determined. The high alcohol sensitivity (HAS) rat line was more sensitive to the locomotor and body temperature depressant effects of nicotine than was the low alcohol sensitivity (LAS) rat line. The control line (CAS) was intermediate in sensitivity. The rat lines did not differ in sensitivity to oxotremorine's hypothermia-producing effects. The numbers and affinities of two classes of brain nicotinic receptors were measured in eight brain regions. No differences among the rat lines were detected. These results suggest that ethanol elicits some of its depressant actions via an effect on brain nicotinic systems, but the differences in sensitivity to ethanol and nicotine are probably not due to differences in the number of brain nicotinic receptors. Perhaps this interaction explains the high correlation between alcoholism and smoking in humans.\r"

Following initiation, they were tested under a variety of operant conditions to examine the ability of ethanol to reinforce lever pressing behavior. Regardless of initiation procedure, the animals maintained lever pressing behavior with ethanol reinforcement, even at ethanol concentrations as high as 40% (v/v). Slightly higher daily session intakes (g/kg) were found at the higher ethanol concentrations following the secondary-conditioning initiation procedure compared with the sucrose-fading technique. When both ethanol and water were concurrently available, the rats showed a high preference for ethanol reinforcement. When varying concentrations of sucrose were substituted for water, the amount of ethanol ingested decreased as the concentration of the alternative sucrose increased. However, if the response requirement for the sucrose was substantially greater than that for ethanol, the rats shifted their responding to the lever associated with ethanol presentation. The results are discussed in relation to prior work using similar procedures with Long-Evans non-selected rats and with the alcohol non-preferring (NP) rat line.\r"

  ".W": "It is known that a signal peptide is required for the import of a protein into mitochondrial matrix. It is also known that a signal peptide can be attached to any protein and allow it to be imported. We recently reported that the rate of import of rat liver mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase precursor was slower than that of ornithine transcarbamylase precursor (Wang TTY, Farres J, and Weiner H. Arch Biochem Biophys 272, 440-449, 1989). It was not known if the difference in the rate of import was related to the fact that the mature portion of aldehyde dehydrogenase is larger (500 amino acids compared with 322 amino acids) or because the signal peptides were different. We further showed that treatment of the mitochondria with alcohols caused an inhibition of the import of the precursor of aldehyde dehydrogenase but not that of ornithine transcarbamylase. In the present study we constructed chimeric proteins that contained the signal peptide from one precursor protein and the mature portion from the other. We found that the rate of import was related to the overall size of the precursor protein. Consistent with this observation was finding that a truncated aldehyde dehydrogenase precursor, which contained 317 amino acids, was imported more rapidly than was the authentic precursor. Consistent with this finding was the fact that butanol caused the inhibition of only the large precursor proteins. Thus, it appears that size of the protein being imported is a major determinant of the rate at which a precursor protein is imported into mitochondria.\r"

  ".W": "The combined effects of alcohol intoxication and intense physical exercise on the adrenergic system were studied in eight healthy male volunteers. Ethanol (0.8 g/kg body weight) was administered perorally to bring about a mean serum concentration of 21 mmol/liter (0.1%); each subject also participated in an identical control session without alcohol. Acute alcohol intake alone did not change the concentrations of plasma adrenaline or noradrenaline or the density, affinity, and functioning (ability to mediate catecholamine-stimulated production of cAMP) of lymphocytic beta-adrenergic receptors. In contrast, acute ergometer exercise brought about an approximately 10-fold increase of plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations, a 2- to 3-fold increase of beta-adrenergic receptor density and an enhancement of isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP production. Alcohol intake immediately before the ergometer exercise did not modify these changes. In conclusion, acute physical exercise activates the human adrenergic system, with an increase of both plasma catecholamines and lymphocytic beta-adrenergic receptors. Moderate alcohol intoxication does not affect exercise-induced alterations of these parameters.\r"

In the present study we demonstrate that these same IgG antibodies cross-react with N-ethyl-dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine when this adduct is incorporated into the surface of hepatocytes. Hapten-specific IgG antibodies were purified from the sera of rabbits sensitized to an albumin-acetaldehyde conjugate that had been reduced with sodium cyanoborohydride (N-ethyl-RSA). The N-ethyl-RSA was coupled to an Affi-Gel-10 column to affinity purify the IgG. Liposomes containing N-ethyl-dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine were fused with isolated hepatocytes, the affinity purified primary IgG antibodies were added, then fluorescein-conjugated second antibodies were added, and antibody binding to hepatocytes was measured by flow cytometry. The fluorescence of these hepatocytes was significantly greater (p less than 0.01) than control hepatocytes prepared with (1) pre-immune primary IgG antibodies with fluorescein-conjugated second antibodies, (2) no primary antibody but with fluorescein-conjugated second antibodies, and (3) no fluorescein-conjugated second antibodies.\r"

An assessment of donor parameters is thought to be important in selecting good donors; however, the criteria utilized have not been standardized. This study was performed to determine the effect of a measurable donor blood alcohol level on graft survival. Fifty-two patients who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation at the University of Pittsburgh were included in the study. Twenty-five patients received liver grafts from donors having a blood alcohol level between 0.04 and 0.4 g/l with a mean of 0.17 g/l. Twenty-seven patients received a liver graft from a donor who had no measurable blood alcohol. There were no differences between these two groups of donors regarding the time of initial hospitalization until the time of donation. Graft failure within the first 30 days was 24% for those receiving an organ from an alcohol-positive donor as compared with 22.2% in those receiving an organ from an alcohol negative donor. The recipient mortality rate was 16% and 11%, respectively. No relationships between the donor blood alcohol level and organ performance, frequency of primary graft nonfunction, or number of episodes of acute cellular rejection were evident. Based upon these data, the presence of a measurable blood alcohol level in a donor should not mitigate against organ donation.\r"

Cytosolic acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH-2) increases in some strains while decreasing in others with ethanol treatment. Further work suggests that the mRNA for ALDH-2 (Ahd-2 mRNA) levels are altered following ethanol feeding in a strain-dependent fashion. This report identifies differences in Ahd-2 at the genomic DNA level among different strains of mice. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) associated with the Ahd-2 locus were found for the restriction enzymes EcoRI, HindIII, Pst I and Rsa I. The mouse strains included in this study could be categorized into two groups based on their overall Ahd-2 associated DNA banding patterns. Strains C57BL/6J, C57BL/6J*, C57BL/10J and BALB/c form group 1 while strains C3H/HeJ, C3H/HeSnJ, 129/ReJ, Csb, SW and DBA/2J form group 2. With the exception of BALB/c, group 1 represents alcohol preferring strains while group 2 are alcohol avoiding strains. Additional work will be required to determine the physiological significance (if any) of these RFLPs and their possible relationship to ethanol preference and avoidance.\r"

Given the physiological importance of the spleen, certain controversy has arisen regarding the most appropriate method of managing this type of trauma. Nonoperative therapy in children has proven to be successful not only in the case of kidney lesions but also for splenic lesions. Nonoperative management carried out in the authors' hospital on a group of 56 patients (49 adults and seven children over the age of 7 years) has proved successful in 37 cases. The success of this technique requires a well-formulated protocol, diagnostic methods (ultrasound and computed tomography), rigorous patient control in the emergency room during the initial phase (first 48 hours), the availability of a medical team if surgical intervention becomes necessary (persistent or recurrent hemorrhage), and complementary measures which facilitate the cicatrization of the splenic injury (bed rest, antibiotic therapy).\r"

The authors' NLB experience was reviewed to determine whether the method of anesthesia affected accuracy, yield, complication rate, or cost. All biopsies were performed in a standard operating room using either local anesthesia (Group 1, n = 14), local anesthesia with an anesthesiologist present (Group 2, n = 14), or general anesthesia (Group 3, n = 10). The mean operative times were 54, 59, and 56 minutes for Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In groups 1 and 2, 100 per cent of the specimen radiographs showed the target lesion had been excised, although one biopsy was indeterminate. Among Group 3 two target lesions could not be identified on specimen radiographs and one was indeterminate. There was one malignancy in Group 1 compared with four malignancies in Group 2 and two in Group 3. The average hospital bill was $1,172 for Group 1, $1,418 for Group 2, and $1,488 for Group 3. Anesthesiologists' fees added an additional $224 to Groups 2 and 3. NLB can be performed using local anesthesia without sacrificing accuracy or yield, increasing operative time, or increasing complication rate; the cost is significantly less than with general anesthesia.\r"

Ready recommendation for biopsy of nonpalpable lesions imaged by x ray is a conservative radiologic policy but is unsettling for patients and creates an imperative bind for surgeons. Like the decision to send the patient with right lower quadrant abdominal pain home rather than to the operating room, the diagnosis that requires clinical confidence and precision is nonappendicitis. Noncancer of the breast is a similar diagnosis that can usually be made on clinical and mammographic findings rather than passing such patients through to invasive diagnosis. A series of 84 patients was referred for needle localization of nonpalpable mammographically detected lesions called suspicious on screening examination. Of these 84 patients, new radiographic reports reinterpreting the findings without biopsy were written on the original mammogram in 15 patients. This is a cancellation rate of 21 per cent. In 69 patients needle localization was carried out with the finding of cancer in 28 per cent, compared with the national average of 15 per cent. This higher than average yield caused concern whether any unbiopsied cancers had been followed, and a review of these patients was undertaken. In the log of patients referred for needle localization, the prereading by the mammographer performing the needle localization was recorded in advance of biopsy confirmation, and specificity proved to be 94 per cent and sensitivity 96 per cent. Of the cancers that were detected, 39 per cent were proven in patients older than 50 years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

With a follow-up range of 3 months to 20 years, six patients have died with metastatic carcinoid tumor, two patients died without evidence of disease, 12 patients are alive with metastasis, and 35 patients are alive, free of disease. In this series three determinants for risk of metastasis in GI carcinoid tumors were evident: primary size, serosal penetration, and primary site in the small intestine. In patients with any of these risk factors, resection with regional lymphadenectomy is recommended.\r"

The most frequent location of these tumors in the biliary tree appears to be the common bile duct (50%), followed by the cystic duct (37%), the hepatic ducts (15%), and the gallbladder (4%). Most patients have been treated with resection followed by restoration of biliary continuity using biliary enteric diversion. In the case presented, the tumor was located at the hepatic confluence with extension into the hepatic substance requiring segmental duct cholangiojejunostomy after resection. This resulted in fulminant sepsis and death despite adequate preoperative biliary decompression and the lack of signs or symptoms of infected bile. Alternative forms of management in the treatment of this benign condition at this location are discussed.\r"

Nonmalignant neck masses were located in the thyroid or submaxillary gland in 60 per cent of these patients. Thyroid adenoma, reactive cervical nodes, and mixed tumor of the submaxillary salivary glands represented the three most commonly occurring nonmalignant pathologic conditions in this series. When stratified by age and sex, thyroid abnormalities, specifically thyroid adenoma, occurred most often in females of all ages. In males, reactive nodes were usually seen before 40 years of age; thereafter, tumors of the submaxillary salivary gland predominated. Most studies of nonmalignant neck masses indicate that reactive nodes are the most common condition in patients of all ages. Thyroid conditions were seen most frequently in this group of patients. The probable explanation is a tertiary referral pattern to surgeons. Patients with nonsurgical conditions were, presumably, identified and managed earlier and not referred further, and therefore did not appear in this group of patients.\r"

Open packing has not been widely accepted, fearing that it may delay perineal wound healing. The purpose of this paper, therefore, was to retrospectively evaluate, the experience at Ferguson Hospital with abdominoperineal resection from 1977 through 1986. The study population consisted of 288 patients undergoing abdominoperineal resection for rectal adenocarcinoma. Forty-six patients had the perineal wound closed primarily and 242 had the perineal wound packed open. Ninety-four patients had the pelvic peritoneum left open and 194 underwent closure of the pelvic peritoneum. Overall operative mortality was 2.1 per cent, and there was no significant difference between primary closure and open packing of the perineal wound with respect to hospital stay, operating time, operative blood loss, perioperative mortality, incidence of postoperative bowel obstruction, incidence of postoperative complications, or average time for perineal wound healing. Therefore, it would appear that packing the perineal wound following abdominoperineal resection is a viable means of handling the bottom end.\r"

Previously, virtually all patients with these lesions were treated for a nonspecific neck mass. However, in the present case, a preoperative diagnosis of nonfunctioning parathyroid carcinoma was made based on the technetium pertechnetate/thallium 201 subtraction scan. The authors report on the 14th case of nonfunctioning parathyroid carcinoma, a review of the literature, and guidelines for the preoperative and operative evaluation of neck masses suspected to be parathyroid carcinoma.\r"

Computerized tomography and upper gastrointestinal series confirmed the presence of a gastric mass. Laparotomy and local resection showed a gastric duplication comprised of two cysts, one with communication to the stomach lumen. Gastric duplication is a rare entity, especially in the adult. Though generally benign, local ulceration or fistula formation can cause symptoms and may suggest a more malignant process that warrants investigation.\r"

STUDY MATERIAL: Three hearts fixed in neutral formalin and well preserved with all the relevant areas of conduction system intact. METHODS: Light microscopic examination of subserial sections of the sinus node, atrioventricular node and His bundle, coronary chemoreceptor and regional nerves, ganglia, and small coronary arteries. Routine stains used were Goldner trichrome and Verhoeff-van Gieson. RESULTS: Arterial abnormalities were numerous and primarily of two types: focal fibromuscular dysplasia causing moderate to severe narrowing, as well as endarteritis and panarteritis. Extensive examples of neuritis and ganglionitis were present throughout the heart, including the conduction system, where arterial abnormalities were also abundant. In the coronary chemoreceptor there were both old and new lesions comprising focal inflammation with degeneration as well as older areas of fibrotic destruction. Within the sinus node, areas of dense fibrosis replaced all nodal tissue. These abnormalities were similar in nature and extent in all three hearts. CONCLUSIONS: The pathologic lesions present in the coronary arteries, neural structures, and conduction system of the heart in patients who died from the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome provide a suitable anatomic substrate for substantial cardiac electrical instability, including the occurrence of sudden death. In cases of unexplained cardiac electrical instability or sudden unexpected death an inquiry should be made about previous use of L-tryptophan. In patients with the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, the possibility of cardiac electrical instability should be considered as part of long-range clinical management.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective controlled trial. SETTING: A general internal medicine-teaching clinic in a university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-one medical interns. INTERVENTION: Thirty-one interns received a manual of comparative drug prices annotated with prescribing advice, two feedback reports, and weekly cost-oriented prescribing reminders. A control group concurrently participated in a manual-based educational program on cholesterol management. MEASUREMENTS: Copies of 3012 prescriptions written over 8 months were analyzed. MAIN RESULTS: Intervention group physicians prescribed less expensive drugs within classes of drugs. The change in drug price score per prescription was -0.15 (95% Cl, -0.27 to -0.04; P = 0.01). A score of 3 was assigned to the most expensive, 2 was assigned to intermediate-priced, and 1 was assigned to the least expensive drug or drugs in the class. An increase of 0.74 months' (Cl, 0.49 to 0.98; P less than 0.001) supply of medication was dispensed per prescription, reducing dispensing fees. The program was well accepted by the physicians. CONCLUSION: This relatively simple educational intervention can help physicians to reduce their patients' drug expenses and may serve as a model for incorporating cost information into the routine practice of medicine.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To examine, from the perspective of primary care physicians, the value of mental status findings and ancillary tests in diagnosing dementia or its causes. DATA SOURCES: Studies identified using MEDLINE and bibliographies of pertinent articles. STUDY SELECTION: Selection based on availability of information on specific findings or tests, the criterion standard used to confirm diagnoses, the disease spectrum, and the richness of the reported data. DATA EXTRACTION: Data collected on sensitivity and specificity. In many cases, the originally reported data are re-analyzed to illustrate the usefulness of alternative cut-off values or to answer specific clinical questions. Likelihood ratios estimated to summarize test results. DATA SYNTHESIS: Probability of dementia is greatly reduced (likelihood ratio, 0.06 to 0.2) when either normal serial 7s, 7-digit span, 3-item recall, or clock drawing test results are obtained; abnormal results only moderately increase the odds of disease. Low (less than or equal to 20), intermediate (21 to 25), or high (greater than or equal to 26) scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) increase (likelihood ratio greater than or equal to 8.2), have little effect (likelihood ratio, 1.3 to 2.4), or decrease (likelihood ratio, 0.06 to 0.1) the odds of disease. The usefulness of tests to investigate the cause of dementia varies depending on the pretest probability of the specific condition. CONCLUSIONS: Several useful methods exist to screen for cognitive impairment, and clinicians need to be familiar with the strengths and limitations of their preferred screening methods. In investigating the cause of dementia, routinely obtaining a VDRL test, cerebral imaging studies, serum cobalamin level, or folate level is unwarranted.\r"

  ".U": "91282192\r", 
  ".W": "This conference focuses on the controversies about managing thyroid cancer, emphasizing the possibility that the treatment of patients with potentially fatal thyroid cancer may be improved. Although the mortality rate from thyroid cancer is low, it is the highest among cancers affecting the endocrine glands (excluding the ovary). Exposure to radiation during childhood in the 1930s and 1940s increased the incidence of but not the mortality from thyroid cancer, because these tumors are mainly papillary cancers developing in young adults. These rates may change as the exposed cohort ages. Risk factors that increase mortality include older patient age and the growth characteristics of the tumor at diagnosis, the presence of distant metastases, and cell type (for example, the tall-cell variants of papillary cancer, follicular cancer [to be distinguished from the more benign follicular variant of papillary cancer], medullary cancer, and anaplastic cancer). Local metastases in lymph nodes do not seem to increase the risk for death from papillary cancer, but they do increase the risk for death from follicular and medullary cancer. In the latter, mortality is decreased by the early detection and treatment of patients with the familial multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome 2a. There are excellent tumor markers for differentiated cancer of the parafollicular and of the follicular cells (serum calcitonin and serum thyroglobulin levels, respectively). Measuring the calcitonin level allows early diagnosis of familial medullary cancer, whereas measuring the thyroglobulin level, although useful only after total thyroidectomy, allows early recognition of recurrence or metastases of papillary or follicular cancer. Initial surgery, protocols for follow-up, and the use of radioiodine for the ablation of any residual thyroid and the treatment of metastatic cancer are discussed. Because these tumors resist currently available chemotherapy regimens, possible ways to increase the effectiveness of radioiodine therapy are considered as are new approaches to treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Pharmaceutical manufacturers commonly contract with clinical investigators for pre-market testing of new products. The per-patient reimbursement offered to the investigator generally exceeds the per-patient costs incurred by the investigator. This excess represents a windfall that can be used to pay for travel, equipment, or supplies, or to fund research for which the investigator cannot obtain funding through peer-reviewed granting channels. This excess raises a potential conflict of interest, because it may lead the investigator to propose experimental treatment for a patient when the patient might be better served by conventional treatment or by no treatment at all. Not only does this situation pose a conflict of interest, it also is a conflict of which few patients are aware and fewer are informed. We propose that all experimental subjects be informed of the source, amount, and mechanism of funding for the experimental treatments they undergo. Further, we propose that payments from pharmaceutical manufacturers for pre-market testing of drugs go to the medical school dean rather than to the individual investigator. With this money, the dean can defray the direct as well as the indirect costs of the clinical study; the remainder, which would otherwise go directly to the investigator, should be placed in a funding pool for which the entire medical school could compete. This solution largely eliminates conflict of interest, addresses informed consent, and reasonably balances the interests of the experimental subject, the clinical investigator, the pharmaceutical manufacturer, and the academic institution.\r"

DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized, crossover study, with each patient serving as his or her own control. SETTING: Clinical research center at a university hospital. PATIENTS: Twelve patients with hypertension. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were placed on 10-day isocaloric diets providing a daily potassium intake of either 16 mmol or 96 mmol. The intake of sodium (120 mmol/d) and other minerals was kept constant. On day 11 each patient received a 2-litre isotonic saline infusion over 4 hours. MEASUREMENTS: Blood pressure; urinary excretion rates for sodium, potassium, calcium, and phosphorous; glomerular filtration rate; renal plasma flow; and plasma levels of vasoactive hormones. MAIN RESULTS: With low potassium intake, systolic blood pressure increased (P = 0.01) by 7 mm Hg (95% CI, 3 mm Hg to 11 mm Hg) and diastolic pressure increased (P = 0.04) by 6 mm Hg (CI, 1 mm Hg to 11 mm Hg), whereas plasma potassium concentration decreased (P less than 0.001) by 0.8 mmol/L (CI, 0.4 to 1.0 mmol/L). In response to a 2-litre isotonic saline infusion, the mean arterial pressure increased similarly on both diets but reached higher levels on low potassium intake (115 +/- 2 mm Hg compared with 109 +/- 2 mm Hg, P = 0.03). Potassium depletion was associated with a decrease in sodium excretion (83 +/- 6 mmol/d compared with 110 +/- 5 mmol/d, P less than 0.001). Plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentrations also decreased in patients during low potassium intake, but concentrations of arginine vasopressin and atrial natriuretic peptide, glomerular filtration rate, and renal plasma flow were unchanged. Further, low potassium intake increased urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorus and of plasma immunoreactive parathyroid hormone levels. CONCLUSION: Dietary potassium restriction increases blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension. Both sodium retention and calcium depletion may contribute to the increase in blood pressure during potassium depletion.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To determine if a 6-month course of therapy with IMREG-1, a leukocyte-derived immunomodulator, slows disease progression in patients with AIDS-related complex. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind trial. SETTING: Five academic- and three community-based clinics. PATIENTS: Immunocompromised patients (143) with HIV. INTERVENTIONS: IMREG-1 or placebo every 2 weeks (13 doses). MAIN RESULTS: Twelve of forty-eight patients on placebo and 5 of 95 patients on IMREG-1 experienced adverse events (AIDS-defining opportunistic infection or neoplasm, wasting syndrome, HIV-associated encephalopathy, or peripheral sensory neuropathy). Based on an intention-to-treat analysis, Kaplan-Meier event probabilities were 26% for the placebo group and 6% for the IMREG-1 group (P less than 0.001); based on the Cox proportional hazards model, the relative risk for patients on placebo compared with patients on IMREG-1 was 5.1 (95% CI, 1.8 to 14.8). The frequency of symptoms significantly increased from baseline in patients receiving placebo. The mean decrease in CD4+ cells from baseline was 80 x 10(6) cells/L in the placebo group and 29 x 10(6) cells/L in patients on IMREG-1, with 20% (8) and 38% (32) of patients, respectively, showing a trend toward an increase (P = 0.04). In patients receiving IMREG-1, the size and rate of delayed hypersensitivity responses were larger than in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AIDS-related complex experienced fewer adverse events and constitutional symptoms after IMREG-1 treatment. The slower loss of CD4+ cells and increased size and rate of delayed hypersensitivity responses most likely reflect the effect of IMREG-1 on the immune system. No toxicity related to IMREG-1 administration was observed.\r"

In this study, surrogate decision makers' views (those of primary care providers and close family members) were compared with the decisions of currently competent chronically ill elderly patients, using a hypothetic cardiopulmonary resuscitation scenario under circumstances of current health and progressive dementia. Concordance between patients and their surrogates was evaluated by assessing percent agreement, kappa coefficient (for concordance beyond chance), and directionality of discrepant responses. Most patient respondents chose to be resuscitated in both scenarios. Although patients predicted that both their physicians (90%) and family members (87%) would accurately represent their wishes, neither family members nor physicians, in fact, were able to adequately predict patients' wishes in both scenarios (kappa less than or equal to 0.3 in all scenarios; percent agreement range, 59% to 88%). Few patients had ever discussed their resuscitation preferences with either their family member (16%) or their physician (7%). These results cast doubt on the usefulness of a strict substituted judgment standard as an approach to medical decision making for patients with diminished mental capacity.\r"

PATIENTS: Patients were 554 North Carolina residents (age range, 30 to 79 years) hospitalized between 1980 and 1982 with a discharge diagnosis indicating newly diagnosed chronic renal dysfunction and a serum creatinine level consistently at or above 130 mumol/L (1.5 mg/dL). Controls were 516 persons chosen randomly by telephone screening (if younger than 65 years of age) and from listings of Medicare recipients (if 65 years of age or older), frequency-matched to patients by age, race, sex, and proximity to study hospitals. MEASUREMENTS: Data on use of prescription NSAIDs and other analgesics before 1980, other risk factors, and potential confounders were obtained by telephone interviews. Patients were classified by frequency and duration of use; daily users were those who took an NSAID for at least 360 consecutive days. MAIN RESULTS: A twofold risk for chronic renal disease was associated with previous daily use of NSAIDs (adjusted odds ratio, 2.1; 95% Cl, 1.1 to 4.1). Increased risk was predominantly limited to men older than 65 years, for whom the odds ratio for daily use was 10.0 (Cl, 1.2 to 82.7) after adjusting for use of other analgesics. In other age-sex groups, the risk associated with NSAID use tended to be increased among those with heart disease or other factors that might indicate compromised renal circulation. These findings did not result from confounding by known renal disease risk factors and were not readily explained by potential biases. CONCLUSIONS: Regular use of NSAIDs may increase the risk for chronic kidney disease in some high-risk groups. With the recent over-the-counter availability and increasing popularity of NSAIDs, the possibility of an increased risk for chronic renal disease associated with their use may warrant further scrutiny.\r"

MAIN RESULTS: The patients who did not receive thrombolytic therapy were older, more likely to be women, and more likely to have a history of hypertension, previous myocardial infarction, or chronic angina (all comparisons, P less than 0.002). An average of 1.9 reasons for exclusion were identified per patient among the ineligible patients. Mortality was fivefold higher among ineligible patients (19%; Cl, 16% to 21%) than among protocol-treated patients (4%; Cl, 1% to 6%) (P less than 0.001). In-hospital mortality rates for excluded patients were 28% (Cl, 23% to 32%) in elderly patients (age, greater than 76 years; n = 396); 29% (Cl, 23% to 35%) in patients with stroke or bleeding risk (n = 209); 17% (Cl, 14% to 20%) in patients with delayed presentation (greater than 4 hours after the onset of chest pain; [n = 599]); 14% (Cl, 11% to 16%) in patients with an ineligible electrocardiogram (ECG) (n = 673); and 26% (Cl, 21% to 32%) in patients with a miscellaneous reason for exclusion (n = 243). Independent predictors of increased mortality were: age greater than 76 years, stroke or other bleeding risk, ineligible ECG, or the presence of two or more exclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Thrombolytic therapy is currently used in the United States for only a minority of patients with acute myocardial infarction: those who have low-risk prognostic characteristics.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of autoantibodies and autoimmune disease and their influence on therapeutic results during alpha-interferon treatment in patients with malignant midgut carcinoid tumors. DESIGN: Consecutive sample of patients. SETTING: University hospital. PATIENTS: One hundred thirty-five patients (70 women, 65 men; median age, 59 years) with biopsy-proven tumors, liver metastases, and no autoimmune disease. INTERVENTIONS: Leukocyte alpha-interferon (n = 88) or alpha-interferon 2b (n = 47) three times a week. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Signs and symptoms of autoimmune disease or development of autoantibodies to thyroid antigens, nuclear antigens, or gastric parietal cells. Tumor responses were determined by reduced liver metastases or reduced urinary 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid excretion, or both. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (19%) developed the following autoimmune disorders after a median of 9 months of therapy: thyroid disease (n = 18), systemic lupus erythematosus (n = 1), pernicious anemia (n = 4), and vasculitis (n = 2). Antibodies to microsomal thyroid antigen or thyroglobulin were detected in 16 patients before therapy and in another 11 patients during therapy. Antinuclear antibodies were detected in 16 patients before and in another 19 patients during therapy. Clinical thyroid disease developed in more than 60% of patients who had or developed thyroid antibodies but in only 7% of initially autoantibody-negative patients. Autoimmunity did not correlate with objective tumor response. CONCLUSION: Patients with malignant carcinoid tumors may develop autoimmune disease during alpha-interferon therapy, especially when autoantibodies are present. They should therefore be monitored for autoimmunity, which does not appear, however, to influence tumor responses.\r"

SETTING: A research hospital that recruits patients from the entire United States. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of a cohort of patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex participating in long-term zidovudine-based antiretroviral protocols. PATIENTS: Fifty-five patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and either AIDS or severe AIDS-related complex who were followed for as many as 4 years while they received antiretroviral therapy. MEASUREMENTS: CD4 counts were measured. MAIN RESULTS: Ten patients are known to be alive and 1 was lost to follow-up. Of the 44 patients who are known to have died, the CD4 range was known within 6 months of death in 41. All but 1 of these 41 assessable deaths occurred in patients whose CD4 counts were known to have fallen below 50 CD4 cells/mm3 (P less than 10(-10)). The hazard of dying in the cohort ranged from 0 deaths/patient-month (95% CI, 0 to 0.008 deaths/patient-month) in patients with 200 or more CD4 cells/mm3 to 0.07 deaths/patient-month (CI, 0.050 to 0.094 deaths/patient-month) in patients with fewer than 50 CD4 cells/mm3. For the patients who died and whose cases were assessable, the mean of the last three CD4 counts obtained before death was 7.7 CD4 cells/mm3 (CI, 0.9 to 63.3 cells/mm3). The median survival of patients once their CD4 counts fell below 50 CD4 cells/mm3 was 12.1 months (CI, 7.2 to 19.4 months). CONCLUSIONS: In a carefully followed cohort treated with zidovudine-based antiretroviral therapy, nearly all deaths occurred in patients with fewer than 50 CD4 cells/mm3. These findings may have implications in the monitoring of patients with AIDS and in the use of CD4 count as a clinical trials end point for the antiretroviral therapy of HIV infection.\r"

DESIGN: A case-control study and tracing of the source eggs. SETTING: A Tennessee community and a large layer farm in Indiana. PATIENTS: Case patients ate at the implicated restaurant and subsequently developed S. enteritidis gastroenteritis; controls ate with the case patients, but did not develop gastroenteritis. MEASUREMENTS: Eighty-one case patients were identified; 73 (90%) had eaten egg-containing sauces at a local restaurant on a given evening. The eggs were traced to their farm of origin in Indiana. The farm was inspected 5 weeks after the outbreak. MAIN RESULTS: Of 24 patients with culture-proved cases, 11 were hospitalized. Hollandaise and bernaise sauces prepared with intact, extra-large, grade-A eggs were strongly associated with illness (P less than 0.001). Salmonella enteritidis was isolated from specimens collected from chickens and the farm. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, phage typing, and plasmid profiles of isolates from the farm and from patients were indistinguishable. CONCLUSIONS: Salmonella enteritidis infection is a large and growing public health problem that is spreading beyond the northeastern United States. This study shows a direct link between infected poultry flocks and an outbreak of human illness.\r"

Our focus is the evaluation of cognitive processes underlying the ability to make competent decisions, with an emphasis on the identification of areas of preserved function that may be used to bypass intellectual deficits. The assessment of the cognitive processes underlying competency involves a series of steps designed to evaluate attention, language, memory, and frontal lobe function. The examiner must first show that the patient has an adequate level of attention for participation in the further testing of specific cognitive functions; second, that the patient is able to comprehend relevant instructions, retain information long enough to evaluate it in relation to relevant recent and remote experiences, and express his or her wishes; and finally, that the patient has sufficiently intact judgment and awareness. The examiner must determine whether the patient's preserved cognitive abilities are sufficient for him or her to make an adequate judgment in relation to the specific question being asked. If cognitive function is found to be significantly impaired, the examiner should do a detailed assessment for the presence of compensatory abilities that can be used to bypass the deficits. For example, the examiner should assess whether patients who cannot speak are still able to express their wishes by pointing, using gesture, or even by drawing pictures. Unless such an assessment has been done, patients should not be considered incompetent.\r"

  ".W": "Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], a lipoprotein variant, was relegated for almost 25 years to the study of a few specialists. During the past 3 to 4 years, however, there has been a tremendous upsurge of interest in Lp(a), primarily because of multidisciplinary efforts in structural and molecular biology. Findings emerging from these efforts include the following: Lp(a) represents a cholesteryl-ester, low-density-lipoprotein (LDL)-like particle with apolipoprotein (apo) B-100 linked to apo(a); apo(a) is a glycoprotein coded by a single gene locus on the long arm of chromosome 6, which has several alleles, accounting for its remarkable size polymorphism (300 to 800 kD); apo(a) size polymorphism relates to plasma levels and density distribution of Lp(a); apo(a) is strikingly similar to plasminogen; and in vitro, Lp(a), in appropriate levels, competes for some physiologic functions of plasminogen in the coagulation and fibrinolytic cascade and may thus be thrombogenic. The LDL-like properties of Lp(a) may also confer atherogenic potential, but the mechanisms underlying this atherogenicity remain to be defined. In epidemiologic studies, high plasma Lp(a) levels have been associated with an increased incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, especially in patients less than 60 years of age. Moreover, Lp(a) has been found as an intact particle in the arterial intima, particularly in association with atherosclerotic plaque. This finding suggests that Lp(a) can transverse the endothelium, possibly by a non-receptor-mediated process, and, at the intimal level, acquire thrombogenic and atherogenic potentials. Current information justifies the need to determine plasma Lp(a) levels in patients with a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Unfortunately, the available techniques need to be standardized. Apolipoprotein(a) exists in isoforms of different sizes, and the importance of determining apo(a) phenotypes in clinical practice remains to be established.\r"

It also led to charges by the State of New York of gross negligence against her resident physicians. The residents were exonerated of all charges by a review panel with lay and physician representation after testimony of expert witnesses. Although the Commissioner of Health concurred with this verdict, residents were charged with gross negligence by the Board of Regents, a lay panel. Fundamental contrasts in the way the two panels made their judgments supports the importance of peer review in disciplining physicians in matters of medical judgment. Analysis of the actions by New York State against the residents also underscores the importance of other principles in the oversight of physician behavior that are applicable to all jurisdictions: resolution of charges without undo delay, an equitable and consistent standard for the administration of sanctions, and adherence to a clearly defined standard for the level of culpability required for disciplinary action. Both the structure of the review process and its application in this instance led to violations of each of these principles.\r"

This commentary focuses on the two obvious candidates: payers and physicians. Although payer-based allocation has the advantage of allowing physicians to act strictly on behalf of their patients, it lacks precision and flexibility. Physician-based allocation places allocation decisions in the hands of individuals better positioned and better equipped to make choices that maximize health outputs. To preserve clinical freedom and minimize micromanagement of individual patients, physicians should expand their advocacy role beyond individual patients and recognize their responsibility to populations. In doing so, physicians would acknowledge that societal and patient interests differ and that health care is just one of many important social goods. For physicians willing to make these choices, five general guidelines are offered. Finally, mechanisms to encourage physician-based allocation are considered.\r"

The ratio of the length of the ET cartilage with insertion of the TVPM to its total length from the nasopharyngeal end to near the tubal isthmus was calculated in all 30 cases. In all 20 controls, but in only 6 of 10 CP cases, the TVPM inserted into the lateral lamina of the ET cartilage at its tip portion (chi 2 test, p less than .025). The ratio was significantly smaller in CP cases (0.178 +/- 0.172) than in controls (0.419 +/- 0.120) (t = 4.305, p less than .001).

The procedure was well tolerated even by those patients with strong vomiting reflexes. The operation time was halved, as was the convalescence. Two patients (1.4%) developed scarring with nasal obstruction, but the impact of factors other than the laser approach itself seemed to be the cause. By scored questionnaires the effect on snoring, family complaints, and daytime somnolence was evaluated in two comparable random groups of patients. Sixty-three patients had LUPP procedures, and 37 had UPPP. The short-term results showed that about 90% of the patients considered themselves essentially improved as regarded snoring and that most patients felt more alert, irrespective of the surgical method used.\r"

Results suggest that secretory IgA in nasopharyngeal secretions is related to bacterial adherence and adds to the prevention of nasopharyngeal infections.\r"

A sensorineural hearing loss was found in 12 patients, 2 of whom revealed sudden deafness. Two other patients with neuro-Behcet's syndrome showed a vestibular function deficit, and 3 others exhibited altered caloric stimulation test results. Two of these last patients also revealed a simultaneous bilateral auditory deficit. HLA typing showed the presence of the B51 antigen in 10 of the 14 patients with ear involvement, while only 3 of the 6 patients without ear involvement were HLA-B51-positive. Results suggest that audiovestibular involvement is common in Behcet's syndrome: sudden deafness may be the first sign of ear disturbance; vestibular lesions may represent an early sign of neuro-Behcet's syndrome; and the HLA-B51 antigen is associated with ear involvement. Otoneurologic study can reveal hidden brain stem lesions in Behcet's patients during flare-ups of the disease, even without obvious signs of neurologic deficits.\r"

Twenty-eight Behcet patients (80%) showed some degree of hearing loss. The averaged pure tone audiogram of the Behcet group showed statistically significant auditory deficits in comparison with that of the control group. None of either the Behcet group or the uveitis group showed any hearing deterioration during the follow-up period. Five Behcet patients under CyA therapy demonstrated improvement in their hearing. The difference between the two groups of Behcet patients (CyA versus conventional treatment) was found to be statistically significant (p less than .05). Thus, CyA might serve as an important mode of treatment of sensorineural hearing loss on an inflammatory \"autoimmune\" background.\r"

Postural stability was studied with posturography evaluating the velocity of anterior-posterior body sway. With closed eyes the increase of sway velocity did not differ between the groups, either with or without simultaneous proprioceptive disturbances when the subjects were standing on a bare surface. Body sway velocities were found to increase more in subjects with a BVL than in normal children when subjects were standing on foam rubber. When proprioceptive cues were disturbed, body sway velocities increased in both groups, but significantly more in children with BVL when subjects stood on foam rubber. This occurred both with and without open eyes.\r"

These results were compared with HPV DNA specimens from their newborns, who were sampled by exfoliated cells from the oral-pharyngeal cavity and vulva or tissue from the foreskin 24 to 72 hours after delivery. Among the mothers, 18.1% (13 of 72) typed HPV-positive by the ViraPap/ViraType DNA hybridization technique. Two neonates (2.8% or 2 of 72) tested positive from oral-pharyngeal specimens. This finding supports the hypothesis that respiratory tract papillomatosis may develop as a result of perinatal vertical transmission of HPV. Furthermore, this study suggests that neither cesarean section nor prepartum treatment of HPV lesions will always protect against neonatal acquisition of HPV.\r"

That multiple peaks appear in the compound action potential in patients with hearing loss implies that click sounds elicit successive and separated volleys of neural excitation in the ascending auditory pathway, whereas click sounds in patients with normal hearing mainly give rise to a single volley of neural activity. This difference in the pattern of auditory nerve activity might explain why there are often multiple peaks in the brain stem auditory evoked potentials in patients with hearing loss and that the peaks are often less well-defined than peaks in patients with normal hearing.\r"

Within days a low-frequency loss (below 8 kHz) is detected; within weeks a very high-frequency loss (above 8 kHz) develops; and finally within months the 8-kHz region is also affected. Following the application of excess pressure, presumably to the endolymphatic spaces, via a cannula placed in the endolymphatic duct, a sequence of CAP audiogram changes occurs that is not similar to that observed with hydrops. There is first a very high-frequency loss (above 4 kHz), then a very low-frequency loss (below 4 kHz), and finally the 4 kHz region is also affected and thresholds for all frequencies become even more raised. The data thus suggest that a slow accumulation of endolymph as induced by blockage of the endolymphatic duct does not produce the same disorder as a rapid onset of a high pressure applied at the base of the cochlea. In addition the data suggest that raised endolymphatic pressure is not likely to be significant in early stages of hydrops, but could contribute to the later high-frequency sensitivity losses.\r"

Findings indicated that the frontonasal suture region was an active secondary site of growth unaffected by extirpation. Examples of differential sutural growth were presented. The proximal and distal regions of both the nasal bone and septum were their most active sites of growth. Extirpations of the central section of the cartilaginous nasal septum resulted in severe upper facial deformity in young but not in adult rabbits. Trauma to the nasal bone region in the young rabbit did not result in severe facial deformity as did trauma to the cartilaginous nasal septum. Another purpose of this report is to present some of the different approaches used to study the nasoseptovomeral region.\r"

Discrete motor performance tasks were identified within each of the 32 items. The purpose of this paper is to report the results of an empirical method of determining the factor structure underlying the motor performance tasks of the TAMP. Initially, motor performance tasks were categorized into a priori groupings based on previous literature and clinical judgment. The TAMP was administered to 206 children and adults (age range 6 to 86 years) with physical disabilities. Diagnoses included a variety of musculoskeletal and neurologic disorders. A principal-factor analysis was used to organize and cluster the item tasks into appropriate common factors. Seven factors were identified that accounted for 70.6% of the total variance for the assistance dimension; similar results were obtained for other measurement dimensions of the TAMP. The defined factor structure has patterns of similarity to the motor performance variables as defined by clinical judgment; however, the tasks were organized into factors that were more functionally oriented than expected. The results provide a framework for which the motor performance tasks of the TAMP might be organized into scales that identify essential performance constructs for rehabilitation. The results permit examination of the nature and clinical importance of these common motor performance factors for clinical evaluation and the description of functional disability.\r"

Fifteen men (67.6 +/- 6.1 years) with OA of the knees underwent a four-month exercise program, three times per week. Muscle strength, endurance, and speed were 50% less in OA patients than in controls. After rehabilitation, there was a significant increase in strength (35%), endurance (35%), and speed (50%). Deficiencies and improvements in the muscles were greater at longer muscle lengths. Increases in muscle function were associated with decreased dependency (10%), difficulty (30%), and pain (40%). The average increase in all measured parameters was 10% and 25% after two and four months of rehabilitation, respectively. Improvements were sustained for eight months after rehabilitation. The muscle rehabilitation program was designed specifically to improve function; the improved muscle function was translated into improved functional performance.\r"

Seventeen patients studied after five years of dialysis all had polyneuropathy. Nine patients studied after seven years of dialysis all had median nerve dysfunction. Abnormalities were as common with peritoneal dialysis as with hemodialysis. Nerve dysfunction was independent of the disease underlying renal failure, the side of the dialysis access shunt, and the presence or absence of osteodystrophy.

Children with systemic onset were likely to have shoulder disease within 2.5 years of onset and to have more severely limited PROM. Children with polyarticular onset developed shoulder arthritis any time during the course of their disease. With either type of onset, internal rotation was the most commonly and severely limited motion, followed by abduction. Clinicians treating children with JRA should carefully monitor pain and examine both rotational and planar components of shoulder motion.\r"

It has been previously stated that a shuffling gait with short steps would increase the period of foot flat and thus minimize any excessive local plantar pressures. This theory was quantitatively evaluated with a portable, in-shoe pressure data-acquisition system. Seven pressure sensors were located in the left and right insoles under the metatarsal heads, hallux, and posterior and anterior heels. Plantar pressure data were acquired from ten able-bodied subjects during four minutes of continuous shuffling and walking at a metronome-controlled cadence. Peak pressures, foot-to-floor contact durations, and pressure-time integrals under each sensor during shuffling and walking were analyzed and compared. Peak pressures were decreased at all sensor sites during a shuffling gait. The greatest decreases were noted at the first and second metatarsals (up to 57.8%) and hallux (up to 63.2%). A 41.6% decrease in overall summated peak plantar pressures during shuffling was found. Foot-to-floor contact durations during shuffling were increased from 22.0% to 76.9% at all 14 sensor locations. Pressure-time integrals during shuffling were increased at the heels (up to 78.9%) and decreased at the metatarsal heads and great toes (up to 26.7%). There was a 3.3% increase in the overall summated pressure-time integral during shuffling. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that a shuffling gait increases the period of foot flat and the area of weight bearing, resulting in lower peak plantar pressures on any one area.\r"

Three testing staircases of different riser and tread dimensions were used. Temporal and cinematographic data were collected simultaneously via switchmats and a high-speed camera, respectively. Measures of stairclimbing gait cycle duration, swing and stance phase durations, cadence, and velocity appeared to be systematically related to subject height. Stance (19% to 64%) and swing (36% to 81%) phase durations varied considerably depending on stair dimensions during stair descent. Less variation was observed in stance (50% to 60%) and swing (40% to 50%) values during tasks of stair ascent. Individuals appeared to adjust to stair dimensions by varying the flexion/extension patterns of the knee rather than those of the ankle or hip. Depending on the staircase climbed, knee flexion angles ranging from 83 degrees to 105 degrees were required. Stair dimensions, therefore, appeared to influence the temporal and angular kinematics of the lower limb during stairclimbing.\r"

Temporal and kinematic analyses were conducted on representative gait cycles at three speeds of walking: slow, normal, and fast. Subjects were filmed by two phase locked cameras, one each in the sagittal and frontal planes, operating at a speed of 50 frames per second while the subjects traversed a 10-m walkway in one direction. Obese subjects displayed longer cycle duration (p less than .001), lower cadence (p less than .001), lower relative velocity (statures/sec, p less than .001), and longer stance period (sec, p less than .001) than normal-weight subjects at all speeds. Other temporal differences included gait asymmetry and greater stride width for the obese, all pointing to a slower, more tentative normal speed and problems encountered when walking at speeds other than normal. Greatest instability was evidenced at the slow speed of walking. Joint angle displacement data showed a largely invariant pattern among speeds for most joints studied and similar patterns for both study groups. Normal-weight subjects displayed more consistent patterns of rotation at all joints and speeds, and for the hip and knee joints, there was greater total excursion that favored increased flexion. Obese subjects displayed a more flat-footed weight acceptance period in early stance and a greater external rotation (out-toeing) of the foot at all phases of the gait cycle.\r"

In contrast to the marked recovery observed in mobile animals, the immobilized rats with similar cord lesions showed no significant motor recovery during the period of immobilization. Immobilized rats without cord lesions showed minimal transient deficits. In conclusion, hindlimb activity appears to be a necessary condition for motor recovery after subtotal spinal cord injury.\r"

Similarly, experience in dealing with multidisciplinary treatment teams also seems to help. However, survey results indicate that formal training to acquire administrative/managerial skills or to lead multidisciplinary treatment teams is not offered in many residency programs. Physical medicine and rehabilitation residency curricula require that residents learn management techniques consistent with their team leadership roles. We suggest several methods of offering formal training to residents and to physiatrists in practice, via continuing education.\r"

Predisposing factors include rapid weight loss, prolonged supine positioning, and using a spinal orthosis, all of which are common among acute traumatic quadriplegic patients. This paper presents three patients, aged 24, 16, and 20 years, with traumatic quadriplegia treated with supine positioning and cervical orthoses, who had postprandial nausea and emesis, bloating, and abdominal pain during rehabilitation. Upper gastrointestinal radiographic series demonstrated abrupt duodenal obstruction to barium flow in all three patients. Two of the patients had complete relief of symptoms with conservative management, and one required surgical duodenojejunostomy. Enhanced awareness of this condition may result in improved recognition of this disease as a cause of persistent, unexplained gastrointestinal disturbances in quadriplegic persons, thereby optimizing its treatment and reducing its potential morbidity.\r"

Hypothermia can also develop during inpatient rehabilitation, particularly as a side effect of certain medications. We present a patient with C4 incomplete spinal cord injury whose core body temperature was chronically subnormal, and who developed acute hypothermia on several occasions during inpatient rehabilitation. The results of tests of his autonomic function were abnormal. Acute hypothermia (core temperature approximately 34C) was induced when he was challenged with nifedipine. The serum level of phenytoin became elevated to toxic levels during two episodes of acute hypothermia, but the serum level of carbamazepine did not change appreciably. This case demonstrates that people with spinal cord injuries are at risk for hypothermia, that hypothermia can be induced by nifedipine, and that significant thermal challenges can occur during routine inpatient rehabilitation. In addition, hypothermia appears to affect the metabolism of phenytoin.\r"

Variables measured were the following: (1) average velocity of entire movement, (2) velocity for 10 degrees increments of a movement, and (3) ratio of average peak 10 degrees increment velocity to average velocity. In addition, qualitative examination of velocity profiles was performed. Slow movements were performed in a discontinuous manner by both groups; however, observable differences in peak/average velocity were noted between groups in the unsupported position during slow and fast movements. Able-bodied individuals performed seven of eight fast movements with greater velocity (p less than .05) than brain injured individuals, and the fast movements of the able-bodied subjects were continuous.\r"

Individuals with TBI and their spouses identified problems in living as most important; loss of employment and restrictions on autonomy were reported as the most problematic. Men with TBI placed priority on controlling their anger, whereas, women with TBI were concerned with their mood disorders, particularly depression. Women with TBI and able-bodied wives of men with TBI placed high priority on the use of support groups as a coping strategy. Men placed higher priority on individualistic approaches to adjustment, such as suppression of feelings. A number of testable hypotheses resulted from the pilot study.\r"

In the first, a CHI subject demonstrated excessive verbalization characterized by poorly organized, but task-appropriate, content. In the second, a CHI subject demonstrated fair to good organization but little appropriate content. Prognostically, the presence of appropriate, although disorganized, content was an early indication that the subject was able to appreciate potential relationships of characters in the stimulus picture. The second pattern represented a more severe cognitive dysfunction. This subject's attempts at stories, although well organized, were merely elaborate descriptions of the picture. Discourse analyses appear to be well suited for the assessment of CHI adults.\r"

A third group of age-matched, able-bodied men (n = 10) were used as controls. A battery of tests assessing the presence of fatigue (using a symptom checklist and two rating scales), depression, anxiety, and health status were given at the time of isokinetic/isometric testing. The mean fatigue rating, a subjective score, for the fatigue group of BI subjects was significantly worse than the other groups (p less than .01). There was a positive correlation between clinically significant Zung depression scores and fatigue rating (r = .46) and between Zung anxiety scores and fatigue rating. The depression scores for those who complained of fatigue were significantly higher than the other groups (p less than .005). Maximal isometric contractions were no different among the three groups. The mean maximal isokinetic torque during the 20 repetitions was greater in controls than in the BI groups, but did not reach statistical significance (p less than .25).

Behavioral therapy was used to treat a 26-year-old woman who complained of debilitating dizzy spells after mild head injury sustained in a motor vehicle accident. During a three-week baseline period before treatment, the patient reported a weekly average of 48 dizzy spells, which prevented participation in independent activities and kept her homebound and psychologically distressed. Nine-week behavioral treatment included biofeedback-assisted relaxation training, psychologic counseling, gaze-fixation practice, desensitization exercise, and generalization training. This protocol has been used successfully to train aviators to combat vertigo and nausea in flight. Our regimen included hourly recording of physical activity, notation of frequency of dizzy spells, and use of behavioral methods during nine weeks. The patient reported 90% reduction in dizzy spells and full resumption of independent activities including driving and athletics. Results are discussed in the context of behavioral problems associated with BPV and application of behavioral methods to the complaint of dizziness.\r"

The mean age of the sample was 39.5 years at recruitment: 69% were men. Participants reported substance use information across four periods covering six months before injury to an average of 13 years after injury. All participants reported use of substances with abuse potential at some time in their lives; the time of greatest use was injury to six months before first interview. The duration of this period ranged from 18 months to 43 years. Problems resulting from substance use were reported by 70%; more than half (52%) the sample reported problems during this postinjury period. Sixteen percent of the sample believed they needed treatment at some time; the time of greatest perceived need was in the period after injury. Treatment for substance abuse was received by 7%. Problems attributable to abuse of both prescription and nonprescription medication were reported, suggesting the importance of close monitoring of substance-use patterns in persons with SCI who are prescribed sedating or narcotic medications. Timely assessment of problems related to substance use and provision of treatment services to persons with traumatic injury are indicated to prevent a potential dual disability.\r"

To determine if individual characteristics and behaviors present during rehabilitation can identify high-risk individuals, records of 5,200 spinal cord injured patients admitted to the Rocky Mountain Regional Spinal Injury System were reviewed. Of 489 deaths, 9% were due to suicide. They were compared with a control group of equal size, matched on age, gender, and injury level. The two groups differed significantly on postinjury despondency; expressions of shame, apathy, and hopelessness; and preinjury family disruption (p less than .01). They also differed on alcohol abuse, active involvement in the injury, preinjury depression or despondency, destructive behavior, and one aspect of etiology (p less than .05). Discriminant analysis yielded a predictive model that correctly classified 81% of the suicide group and 79% of the control group. Many of the demographic predictors identified in this study are similar to those reported in the scientific literature. However, when combined with specific behavioral characteristics manifested during rehabilitation, they comprise an array of variables that permits development of a clinical model for predicting suicide among persons with spinal cord injuries.\r"

Seventeen patients were studied, subtle electrodiagnostic evidence of denervation was sought. Measurements of fiber density and analysis of turns and amplitude showed no abnormalities in nine patients. Five patients had borderline elevated fiber density. Analysis of turns and amplitude showed mild neurogenic changes in two patients and borderline changes in three patients. These findings were disparate, with isolated abnormalities in individual muscles. It was concluded that (1) there is a group of patients whose histories of poliomyelitis are uncertain, and (2) the lack of clear evidence for previous denervation after extensive electrodiagnostic testing is a valid means for excluding the diagnosis of postpoliomyelitis syndrome.\r"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate retrospectively the functional status of 14 SCD children who had had strokes and to compare them with age-matched and gender-matched SCD children who had not had strokes. By doing so, we would be able to quantify the eventual physical and cognitive functional outcomes of survivors of stroke secondary to SCD and assess the impact of stroke on these patients. These children (five boys and nine girls) with SCD and stroke(s) were 11.6 +/- 4.3 years of age (range five to 18 years). They experienced one to three strokes at a mean age of 6.1 +/- 5.2 years (range one to 17 years). A series of tests were administered to these subjects to evaluate physical and psychosocial functions. These tests were performed at least one year after the latest stroke. This study showed that all of the SCD-stroke children were physically independent. Only a few had impairments of hand functions and mild difficulties in self-care activities. However, most of these children demonstrated intellectual deficits ranging from borderline to moderate mental retardation, reduced language functions ranging from low normal to retarded range, and problems in adjustment. Intelligence quotient of the children with SCD-stroke(s) was significantly lower than those of age-matched and gender-matched nonstroke SCD children, suggesting that stroke caused an adverse effect on the cognitive functioning of these children. The results indicate that in the SCD-stroke children psychosocial deficits outweighed physical disabilities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A multiple-baseline design (across ventilator and tracheostomy procedures) was used to evaluate the effectiveness of an information-only procedure and combined relaxation and cognitive distraction procedures. Partial-interval recording was used to measure heart rate, disruptive mouth noises, and demands and complaints to staff members. The patient's behavior did not change during a no-intervention baseline or during the information-only condition. Cognitive distraction and relaxation procedures were introduced, first during ventilator checks and then during tracheostomy care; corresponding decreases in heart rate, mouth noises, and demands and complaints were noted. Gains were maintained at one year follow-up. Results suggest that information alone may not effectively reduce anxiety behaviors for some ventilator-dependent patients unless additional anxiety-reduction procedures are implemented.\r"

  ".W": "To determine test-retest reliability and criterion validity of the Baltimore Therapeutic Equipment Work Simulator (BTE), 30 male volunteers, 18 to 30 years, performed three criterion tasks at light (CL), medium (CM), and heavy (CH) levels of intensity and three corresponding simulated tasks (SL, SM, SH), all of which were repeated on a subsequent session. Oxygen consumption (VO2) and heart rate (HR) were monitored continuously during these tasks. Correlation coefficients between trials of the same task for VO2 (r = .74-.87) and HR (r = .58-.78) indicated significant test-retest reliability. Although criterion-simulation correlation coefficients were significant, consistently high criterion validity was found only at CL-SL (VO2, r = .81 and .83; HR, r = .88 and .95). The nature of the task may have influenced CM-SM correlations. It also appears that subjects underestimated the amount of resistance required on the BTE to simulate CH. Caution is urged in making judgments about a subject's abilities to do real work at medium and heavy intensities based only on test results from the BTE.\r"

T-test comparison of sensory latency of values before and after treatment indicated improvement for the total group. Chi-square and t-tests failed to reveal significant differences between relief and no-relief groups for gender, affected hand, presence of concomitant conditions, duration of symptoms before treatment, age, length of time between pretreatment and posttreatment nerve conduction testing, initial nerve latency of motor and sensory fibers, or the difference between pretreatment and posttreatment sensory latencies. A significant difference was found for motor latency; the relief group improved and the no-relief group deteriorated. Data suggest that splinting is most effective if applied within three months of symptom onset. Those with damage to the wrist structures or median nerve were least responsive to splinting.\r"

  ".W": "When administered systemically to spinalized animals, clonidine, the prototypic alpha 2 adrenergic receptor agonist, purportedly acts at spinal sites to suppress motor responses related to painful peripheral and vesical stimulation and spasticity, and to improve vesicourethral coordination. Hence, the action of clonidine (400 micrograms in three divided doses in a 16-hour span) on spinal vesical and somatic reflexes was examined in five patients with suprasacral spinal cord lesions by assessing volume-induced micturition reflexes and limb motor discharges that occurred spontaneously or were elicited by noxious and nonnoxious cutaneous stimulation. Clonidine caused a significant reduction in (1) blood pressure, (2) amplitude of detrusor contraction, and (3) vesical external urethral sphincter dyssynergia. Limb motor electromyography discharges were not markedly attenuated, although spatiotemporal changes (eg, irradiation, after-discharges) were observed in some of the patients. The results are ascribed to binding to spinal cord alpha 2 adrenergic receptors located on segmental and intersegmental (propriospinal) interneurons, released from descending inhibition, with greater motor system specificity on striated sphincter innervation. Clonidine may be clinically effective in the treatment of hyperactive micturition reflexes in patients with chronic spinal lesions.\r"

Although claudication causes substantial patient disability, most patients are treated conservatively because of the risks of surgical therapy and the uncertain efficacy of drug therapy. It was hypothesized that rocker-soled shoes would decrease the work of the plantar flexors and therefore increase walking distance in patients with calf claudication. To test this hypothesis, walking distances in patients with calf claudication using rocker-soled shoes and a placebo shoe insert were compared. Rocker-soled shoes significantly increased both the total distance walked and the distance at which patients were initially bothered by symptoms by 77m (37%, p less than .0005) and 89m (91%, p = .003), respectively. It was concluded that rocker-soled shoes may reduce disability in patients with calf claudication by increasing walking distance.\r"

Each subject wheeled his or her personal wheelchair, which was mounted on a set of frictionless rollers with side-mounted flywheels. Metabolic and cardiorespiratory responses were continuously monitored by means of an automated metabolic measurement cart interfaced with an electrocardiograph. Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences (p greater than .05) between the mean values of the two test trials for six peak values. Reliability coefficients (p less than .01) were: oxygen uptake (0.98), heart rate (0.97), ventilation volume (0.96), respiratory exchange ratio (0.91), oxygen pulse (0.96), and ventilatory equivalent for oxygen (0.88). The investigators concluded that these six physiological responses in subjects with SCI undergoing WE are highly reliable, and that these variables can be used in the objective prescription, monitoring, and evaluation of exercise rehabilitation programs for individuals with SCI.\r"

Operation of the device involved shuttling a plastic buoy on two 6-m waxed ropes between two persons. Aerobic requirements were generally appropriate for arm training, corresponding to mean values of 5.3, 7.0, and 10.1 ml.kg-1.min-1 at the three progressive metronome settings. Perceived exertion (Borg, 6 to 20 scale) at these work rates was 8.3, 10.4, and 14.6, whereas average heart rate and systolic blood pressure responses were 77, 85, and 114 beats.min-1 and 145, 158, and 175 mmHg, respectively. Continuous ECG monitoring during upper body exercise revealed no significant ST-segment depression or serious arrhythmias. The device appears to be a safe and effective complement to a cardiac exercise training program.\r"

Nonparametric statistical methods are then applied to these data to determine which information is significant at the .05 level. The exact duration of significant information is identified without the need for arbitrary thresholds and filters to eliminate unwanted information. Events are then classified into groups of similar events by comparing: (1) correlation coefficients, (2) point-to-point differences, (3) amplitudes, and (4) areas. The classification is further refined by the use of firing-rate information.\r"

Measurements taken from x-rays have been used to obtain objective measures of shoulder subluxation, but have not been used to compare the effects of different shoulder supports. This study used x-ray measurements to evaluate different shoulder supports for subluxation in hemiplegia and to see if there was a significant difference between the Harris hemisling and the Bobath sling. The Harris hemisling gave good vertical correction of subluxation and compared closely to the uninvolved shoulder. The Bobath sling did not correct the subluxation as well, and the mean difference between the two slings was significant. The arm trough or lap board was less effective and tended to overcorrect. The Harris hemisling and arm trough or lap board had horizontal measurements similar to the uninvolved shoulders. The Bobath sling, however, distracted the glenohumeral joint horizontally and was more variable. The mean horizontal difference between the Harris hemisling and the Bobath sling was significant. These results support the effectiveness and specificity of shoulder support to decrease subluxation after hemiplegia.\r"

Proximal muscle weakness, especially of the lower extremities, and muscular atrophy were the predominant clinical features. Elevated serum creatine kinase levels were noted in four female and 12 male patients, and the degree of elevation was higher in the male patients (up to 32 times the upper limit of normal) than in the female patients. On initial evaluation, two patients were wheelchair-bound, whereas the others were ambulatory. On follow-up evaluation three to 32 years later (mean, 15.5 years), 11 patients used wheelchairs, although only three were wheelchair-bound. The disease followed a steady, slowly progressive course.

This paper presents the cases of three patients with high-level spinal cord injury and symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia who developed atrial fibrillation without any cardiac or metabolic disease that would predispose them to this. The paper proposes that autonomic dysreflexia might predispose a patient to atrial fibrillation by altering the pattern of repolarization of the atria, making the heart susceptible to a reentrant type of arrhythmia. High-level spinal cord injured patients may be at increased risk for the development of atrial fibrillation, an arrhythmia which, if left untreated, can increase the incidence of an embolic cerebrovascular accident that could further impair the patient's functional status.\r"

Two months of bed rest diminished the radiating symptoms, but the weakness persisted. Three months post onset a severe burning dysesthesia developed in the right foot, and the patient became unable to bear weight on that extremity. Physical examination revealed 4-/5 weakness of the ankle dorsiflexors, foot evertors, toe extensors, and hip abductors. The entire right foot was swollen and had a red, mottled discoloration. An EMG was equivocal, and a three-phase bone scan was positive in the right foot in all three phases, which is characteristic of reflex sympathetic dystrophy. A repeat CT scan and review of the earlier scans revealed a high lateral disc fragment at the exit foramina of the L5 nerve root. Upon laminectomy, a free disc fragment at the exit foramina was removed, and the patient's symptoms resolved completely. Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome is very rarely reported in association with lumbar radiculopathy. This case emphasizes the need to carefully evaluate the far lateral exit foramina on CT scan in patients with symptoms of radiculopathy. Myelogram is characteristically normal in these cases.\r"

This life-threatening bradycardia is attributed to an imbalance in the autonomic nervous system resulting from dissociation of the parasympathetic from the sympathetic responses during the stage of spinal shock. A patient with a C2 complete quadriplegia secondary to birth trauma who experienced symptomatic bradycardia, continuing for 21 months after injury despite intensive medical management, is reported. Clinical improvement followed insertion of a cardiac pacemaker. Possible etiologies for the continuation of abnormal bradycardia episodes after the resolution of spinal shock are discussed. Cardiac pacemaker implantation is advocated for patients with high cervical spinal cord injuries and continuing symptomatic bradycardia not responding to medical measures.\r"

Approximately 90% of these patients were effectively managed either with a single injection (58%) or with multiple injections (33%) of this compound. Seventeen patients experienced recurrence a mean of 11.9 months after the initial injection. Three had minor flares and were not reinjected; the others responded to reinjections. Ten percent of the cases could not be controlled with local injection, and these patients were referred for surgery. Adverse reactions were self-limited and relatively minor; no tendon ruptures or local infections occurred. We present a discussion of our review of the literature regarding medical therapy and surgical release for this condition. Treatment of De Quervain's tenosynovitis with methylprednisolone acetate injection rapidly controls the signs and symptoms, does not lead to serious adverse reactions, and should be the preferred initial treatment.\r"

There was no statistically significant correlation between HA levels and 7 other clinical and biochemical parameters in patients with RA. In the OA group, however, plasma HA levels were found to correlate with an objective functional capacity score and with an articular index based on the total amount of cartilage in involved joints. In a retrospective longitudinal study of 6 patients with RA, plasma levels of HA did not show a significant correlation with plasma levels of elastase or with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. These data support in part the contention that plasma HA may be unique as a marker, in that it may be a reflection of synovial involvement and inflammation, rather than only of inflammation, in arthritis.\r"

This probably reflects increased leakage of HA from the inflamed joints into the circulation. In a prospective study of 40 patients with early RA, we evaluated the relationship of serum HA to clinical, laboratory, and radiologic parameters of disease activity. The patients were followed for 12 months; all had active disease at study entry. We confirmed the previous finding of higher serum HA concentrations in RA patients compared with healthy controls. At study entry, the patients' serum HA levels correlated positively with clinical and laboratory parameters of acute inflammation. Despite marked clinical improvement during therapy with second-line drugs, the serum HA levels increased during the followup period. At the end of 1 year, these levels correlated with the radiologic progression of joint lesions, whereas they showed a less pronounced correlation with clinical or laboratory parameters of inflammation. We conclude that, in early RA, serum HA levels may reflect ongoing joint destruction and may even predict subsequent joint damage.\r"

The frequencies of HLA-DR antigens in patients with possible or probable RA (n = 49) were similar to those in controls. In patients with definite RA (n = 134), the frequencies of DR1, DR4, and DRw53 were increased, whereas the frequencies of DR2, DR3, DRw6, DRw13, and DRw52 were decreased, compared with controls. Comparison of HLA-DR frequencies in patients with definite RA subclassified according to the severity of the disease at the end of the followup period revealed a difference only in the frequency of DR4, which was increased in patients with progressive RA (59.2%) compared with those who had mild RA (34.8%). Further analysis showed that, compared with DR4-negative RA patients, DR4-positive patients had more swollen joints, higher scores on the Ritchie articular index, the Health Assessment Questionnaire, and the Steinbrocker functional classification, more radiologic abnormalities, and more use of second-line drugs. Also, the rate of progression of radiologic abnormalities, functional classification, and use of second-line drugs was higher in DR4-positive patients. We conclude that DR4 is associated with a more severe disease course, and is a prognostic marker in early RA.\r"

In serum samples from 125 controls with 4 different chronic diseases (systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis, bronchial asthma, and polyarteritis nodosa), levels of IgA-, IgA1-, and IgA2-RF were found to be increased in 7%, 7%, and 8%, respectively. Comparison of RF levels in samples of serum, synovial fluid (SF), and saliva from RA patients indicated local production of both IgA-RF subclasses in salivary glands and in synovial tissue. Significant positive correlations were found between levels of IgA-RF subclasses in SF and serum, but not in serum and saliva or in SF and saliva. Fractionation of serum, SF, and saliva from patients with RA (by high performance liquid chromatography under acidic conditions) demonstrated that both IgA subclasses with RF activity occur mainly in fractions that also contain IgM. The results of this study show that 1) IgA-RF in serum and SF is mainly of IgA1 subclass, 2) both IgA-RF subclasses are produced locally in salivary glands and in synovial tissue, 3) the production of both IgA-RF subclasses at mucosal and nonmucosal sites is independent from each other, and 4) both IgA-RF subclasses occur predominantly in polymeric form in serum, SF, and saliva in RA patients.\r"

Reactivity with MAb to gE was observed regardless of the Gm specificity of the polyclonal RF and the cross-reactive idiotypes (6B6, 17.109, or G6) of the monoclonal RF. No positive reactions were noted between protein A and Fab fragments of any of the anti-gE MAb.

The GERI-AIMS scales have standardized-item alpha levels greater than 0.70 and correlate well with clinical measures of arthritis severity. Information gained by using the GERI-AIMS has important public policy implications, insofar as information on both generic and disease-specific functional impairment is needed to establish priorities for basic research, epidemiologic, and intervention studies.\r"

Data on 76 pregnancies in 51 JRA patients were collected retrospectively. Comparison of pre-pregnancy disease activity with the course during gestation showed that pregnancy did not cause reactivation of the symptoms of quiescent JRA. Patients with minor symptoms at conception and the majority of those with active inflammation experienced improvement or total remission in the second half of gestation. Four JRA patients with active anterior uveitis had active eye disease during pregnancy also. Seventy-four of the pregnancies resulted in births of infants that were healthy and of normal birth weight; 1 infant had low birth weight and 1 was stillborn. Twenty children were delivered by cesarean section, and in 15 cases this was related to sequelae of JRA. A flare 3-6 months postpartum was reported after 45 pregnancies. However, in none of the patients whose disease was quiescent before or during pregnancy did this cause permanent reactivation of the JRA. Comparison of these 51 patients with 45 age-matched female patients without children revealed that disease severity and functional impairment were the limiting factors in the decision for or against having children.\r"

The Ro/SS-A in platelets is largely the 52-kd form. Moreover, the 52-kd isoform in platelets is antigenically different from that in lymphocytes. In addition to the varied isoform distribution, a different distribution of the Ro/SS-A-binding RNA (hY RNA) is seen in platelets. While there are 4 hY RNA (hY1, hY3, hY4, and hY5) in lymphocytes and other nucleated cells, we have found that platelets contain only 2 hY RNA: hY3 and hY4. This hY RNA distribution is also different from that in red blood cells, which contain only hY1 and hY4. The different distributions of the Ro/SS-A components in lymphocytes, red blood cells, and platelets suggest different functional roles for the various protein and RNA components, as well as the possibility of different tissue-specific events related to the Ro/SS-A-autoanti-Ro/SS-A system.\r"

  ".W": "The physical interaction of particulates with resident mononuclear phagocytes is a consistent feature in certain forms of crystal-induced inflammation. In this study, we observed that monosodium urate crystals stimulated the rapid release of neutrophil chemotactic activity from monocytes, and that this activity steadily increased over 24 hours. Because the release of monocyte-derived neutrophil chemotactic activity was markedly diminished by pretreatment of the monocytes with cycloheximide, and was completely removed from conditioned media by adsorption to heparin-agarose, we addressed the possibility that monocyte-derived neutrophil chemotactic factor/interleukin-8 (IL-8), a heparin-binding neutrophil-activating polypeptide, might modulate these activities. Urate crystal-induced IL-8 secretion from monocytes was verified by radioimmunoassay. In addition, an IL-8-specific antibody markedly inhibited the neutrophil-activating capacity of the conditioned media from monocytes activated by urate crystals, as well as by inflammatory silica crystals. Last, IL-8 was significantly increased in gouty synovial fluids (range 3.0-16.8 ng/ml, mean 8.4 ng/ml, n = 6) relative to osteoarthritic synovial fluids (range 1.1-1.7 ng/ml, mean 1.5 ng/ml, n = 6) (P = 0.006). We conclude that microcrystal-induced secretion of IL-8 by mononuclear phagocytes may mediate a number of forms of crystal-induced inflammation.\r"

We report herein that transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta 1), alone and in synergy with epidermal growth factor (EGF) or TGF alpha, markedly stimulates PPi elaboration by porcine articular cartilage in organ culture and monolayer culture. This effect is not seen with platelet-derived growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, or insulin-like growth factor types 1 and 2, substances which also affect chondrocyte metabolism or are mitogenic. TGF beta 1 produces only a modest increase in nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase (NTPPPH), a chondrocyte ectoenzyme that produces PPi; this implies the existence of other pathways for PPi elaboration. TGF beta 1 is present in joint fluid and cartilage. TGF beta 1, TGF alpha, and EGF are the first known physiologic modifiers of cartilage PPi production. They provide a novel model for the study of CPPD crystal formation in cartilage, as well as new insights into the pathogenesis of this common affliction of aging.\r"

  ".W": "Alcoholic liver disease includes steatosis, alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis. Other liver diseases of genetic origin, but with a curious association with alcohol intake, are hemochromatosis and porphyria cutanea tarda. The attribution of chronic hepatitis to alcohol intake remains speculative, and the association may reflect hepatitis C infection. Hepatic injury attributed to alcohol includes the changes reported in the fetal alcohol syndrome. Steatosis, the characteristic consequence of excess alcohol intake, is usually macrovesicular and rarely microvesicular. Acute intrahepatic cholestasis, which in rare instances accompanies steatosis, must be distinguished from other causes of intrahepatic cholestasis (e.g., drug-induced) and from mechanical obstruction of the intrahepatic bile ducts (e.g., pancreatitis, choledocholithiasis) before being accepted. Alcoholic hepatitis (steatonecrosis) is characterized by a constellation of lesions: steatosis, Mallory bodies (with or without a neutrophilic inflammatory response), megamitochondria, occlusive lesions of terminal hepatic venules, and a lattice-like pattern of pericellular fibrosis. All these lesions mainly affect zone 3 of the hepatic acinus. Other changes, observed at the ultrastructural level, are of importance in progression of the disease. They include widespread cytoplasmic shedding, and capillarization and defenestration of sinusoids. Progressive fibrosis complicating alcoholic hepatitis eventually leads to cirrhosis that is typically micronodular but can evolve to a mixed or macronodular pattern. Hepatocellular carcinoma occurs in 5 to 15% of patients with alcoholic liver disease. The clinical syndrome of alcoholic liver disease is the result of three factors--parenchymal insufficiency, portal hypertension and the clinical consequences of extrahepatic damage produced by alcohol. At the several phases of the life history of alcoholic liver disease, the individual factors play a different role. The clinical manifestations of alcoholic steatosis are mainly extrahepatic in origin. Those of alcoholic hepatitis reflect mainly parenchymal insufficiency and those of cirrhosis are mainly those of portal hypertension. Alcoholic liver injury appears to be generated by the effects of ethanol metabolism and the toxic effects of acetaldehyde, perhaps the immune responses to alcohol- or acetaldehyde-altered proteins, and questionably enhanced by viral hepatitis. Alcoholic hepatitis may be mimicked histologically, and to a varying degree clinically, by a number of conditions (obesity, diabetes, several drug-induced injuries, jejunoileal bypass, and related \"shortcircuiting\" of the bowel). Perhaps the most important facet of the hepatotoxicity of alcohol is its enhancement of the effects of a number of other hepatotoxic agents, among which acetaminophen is the prime example.\r"

A rapid increase in blood flow velocities was demonstrated during the first several days. Pulsatility index, which was initially high, gradually fell after birth and remained stable thereafter. The blood flow velocities of small-for-date infants were determined by their gestational ages. The systolic and mean blood flow velocities were influenced more by postnatal age than by gestational age, birth weight, or body weight. The increase in conceptional age was associated with a decrease in the pulsatility index and an increase in the systolic and mean flow velocities. The transcranial Doppler technique is a useful method and will provide more accurate information about the cerebral hemodynamics in neonates than the previously employed continuous wave Doppler technique.\r"

VEPs were recorded during the acute stage of cortical blindness in all children and were repeated in 24 of them. Either flash or pattern stimulation was used, depending upon the age and visual status of the child. All but one of the children who had normal flash VEPs while cortically blind, recovered normal visual function. All patients with abnormal VEPs had permanent visual impairment or blindness and all but one of those with absent VEPs remained blind. The recovery period was highly variable, ranging from 5 days to 3 years. Thus, flash VEPs recorded during the period of blindness were useful in predicting visual outcome, regardless of etiology. Repeat studies using pattern VEPs were valuable in monitoring recovery in many of these patients.\r"

The primary lesion was located in the axon terminal; the majority of terminal axons were dystrophic with tubulo-membranous profiles, while there were only a few dystrophic axons in the nonterminal axons. According to these findings, it is logical to consider that interruption of axonal transport at the site of the \"turnaround\" process is a cause of dystrophic change of the terminal axon in infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy.\r"

The regional cerebral blood flow patterns correlated with the clinical manifestations during both episodes. Hyperperfusion of the contralateral hemisphere was suggested by asymmetric 99mTc-HMPAO uptake, whereas symmetric 123I-N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine uptake was detected during the interictal period. The results suggested that alternating hemiplegia in infants represents an atypical manifestation of epilepsy, despite the lack of paroxysmal electroencephalographic abnormalities during the episodes. 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT appears to be a useful method for detecting transient regional cerebral blood flow alterations during paroxysmal events because the tracer is rapidly available for emergencies and retains a fixed distribution for 5-8 hours, sufficient time to allow for SPECT acquisition.\r"

Complementation assays demonstrated that the patient's fibroblasts complemented fibroblast lines from all known defects in fatty acid oxidation except long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. Urine and serum carnitine profiles also were indicative of a defect in the oxidation of long-chain substrate; however, the palmitoyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity was actually increased. This finding indicates that the patient had a defect that was distinct from, but possibly related to, long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. This patient demonstrates the laboratory and pathologic findings in defects in fatty acid oxidation and how they differ from those in Reye syndrome.\r"

It remains difficult to predict accurately neurologic outcome among survivors, particularly infants with moderate hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Visual evoked potential (VEP) is a reproducible measure of cortical function and reflects acute changes in central nervous system status secondary to asphyxial insult. We performed serial VEPs on 36 term infants with documented birth asphyxia to investigate the relationship between VEPs and neurodevelopmental outcome at 18 months of age. Fourteen infants were neurologically intact at subsequent examination; all had normal VEPs during the first week of life. Twenty-two infants had died or were significantly handicapped at 18 months of age; 20 had abnormal VEPs persisting beyond day 7 of life. Abnormal VEPs accurately predicted abnormal outcome (100%) and were both sensitive (91%) and specific (100%). In 20 infants who were classified as moderately asphyxiated according to the criteria of Sarnat and Sarnat, even greater accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity (all 100%) were observed. VEPs demonstrate good correlation with neurodevelopmental outcome in term infants with birth asphyxia and provide accurate prognostic information useful in the clinical management of these infants.\r"

Vitamin B6 therapy alone was continued in a single patient (8%) who remained seizure-free during the 15-month follow-up period. Initial treatment with vitamin B6 and valproic acid improved the electroencephalogram significantly more (P less than 0.05) than initial vitamin B6 treatment alone. The group which had valproic acid added to vitamin B6 therapy had significantly fewer seizures (P less than 0.05) and better electroencephalograms (P less than 0.01) than did the group treated initially with vitamin B6 alone. There were no significant differences among the group treated initially with vitamin B6, the group treated initially with valproic acid, and the group in which valproic acid was substituted for vitamin B6. ACTH was more effective in abolishing seizures than was valproic acid or vitamin B6 and valproic acid. ACTH had an excellent effect on seizures in 86% of patients who did not respond well to vitamin B6, valproic acid, or both; however, many of these patients had later recurrence of infantile spasms. The combination of vitamin B6 and valproic acid is effective and safe in the treatment of infantile spasms.\r"

  ".W": "The ongoing federal budget crisis has led to extensive debate over how much money the federal government should spend on scientific research. In the struggle for limited funds, many advocacy groups will covet the large sums proposed for science research, and the scientific community may be called upon to justify its large share of the discretionary funding, especially the large increases for some science agencies and \"big science\" projects. Many would instinctively support the assertion that scientific progress is a cornerstone of national well-being, but the connection between strong federal support of research and vigorous economic growth or societal vitality is not straightforward. Two variables--science and technology, not science alone, are basic to the larger issues of the economy and social welfare. Federal policy must facilitate development in coordination with support for basic science. Scientists, in turn, must help foster a perspective that encompasses research and development as a whole and that seeks to identify explicitly the connections between the nature of the R&D effort and economic vitality and quality of life. Furthermore, society needs a free flow of information between all members of the science and technology community and an end to the artificial and harmful barriers between them. The science community must focus on setting priorities, refining science and technology policy to maximize available resources, and convincing voters that science can make crucial contributions to the long-term welfare of the nation.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined the reasoning processes of beginning, intermediate, and senior students in two medical schools with different curricular formats. One school had a conventional curriculum (CC) where basic science was taught one and a half years before the clinical training, and the other had a problem-based learning curriculum (PBLC) where basic science was taught in the context of clinical problems and general problem-solving heuristics were specifically taught. The students were asked to give diagnostic explanations of a clinical case, both before and after being exposed to relevant basic science information. Two distinct modes of reasoning were identified, each reflecting a curriculum type. A predominantly \"backward-directed\" hypothetico-deductive mode of reasoning was found in the explanations of the PBLC students, and a \"more forward-directed\" pattern of reasoning was found in the explanations of the CC students. Students in the PBLC produced extensive elaborations using relevant biomedical information, which was relatively absent from the CC students' explanations. However, these elaborations were accompanied by a tendency to generate errors. These results have important implications regarding the strengths and weaknesses of the two types of curricula.\r"

The problems encountered in establishing the reliability and validity properties of performance assessment necessitate rethinking the accepted definitions of reliability and validity. The authors examine the relationship between Classical Test Theory and job performance. They discuss several critical issues: the meanings of reliability and validity in performance assessment and the balance between them (including simple versus complex behaviors), stability of performance, specific versus generic abilities, and the role of experts in clinical performance assessment. The authors call for a critical appraisal of applying Classical Test Theory to the assessment of job-related behaviors.\r"

The study demonstrated that the technical aspects of a matching program for medical school applicants can be successfully operated. The applicant participation was 48.7%, with 76.1% of the ranked students responding. The schools ranked 1,122 students, with approximately 38% being ranked by more than one school. Of the 905 students who were matched to a school, 88% were matched to one of their top three choices. Of the students who had actually accepted a position at a school under the normal admission procedure, 60% had been matched to the same school by the matching program. The conclusions are that the program operates properly, that it fulfills the wishes of the students as well as could be expected, and that it parallels the current admission process to a reasonable degree.\r"

The authors formulated a 46-item questionnaire concerning the interview process for medical school applicants, then in 1989 sent it to admission officials at all the 127 LCME-accredited schools in the United States. The questionnaire concerned the interview's status as a predictor; interviewers and interview structure; interviewer training; and the utility of interview data. Seventy-two percent of those sent the questionnaire completed and returned it. The responding admission officials indicated that the interview had two major purposes at their schools: as a means of assessing candidates' noncognitive skills and as a public relations tool. Most schools' interview processes were loosely to moderately structured, and interviewers received minimal training. It is concluded that the interview's role is primarily subjective and that it has a definite but imprecise influence on admission decisions.\r"

Significant findings include the following: 15 of the 16 schools provided some ethics education (with wide-ranging objectives); the amounts of time alloted for such instruction ranged from ten and a half hours to 45 hours (per degree, not per year), with no discernible pattern in the distribution of hours across the years; most teaching was case-based and issue-oriented; most instructors were physicians; and almost all the schools conducted assessments of students using a pass-fail standard.\r"

Learning to perform procedures and tasks (psychomotor skills) would be accomplished in the required fourth-year acting internships. Problem-based learning (PBL) was chosen as the clerkship's primary instructional method. Comprehensive student and program evaluation systems were established. The response by faculty and students has been very positive. Students believe that the new clerkship has helped them increase their abilities in resource use, time management, and retention of knowledge. Faculty have noted students' increased eagerness and enthusiasm for learning.\r"

This 1988 study of final-year medical students at the two universities in Victoria, Australia, sought to assess their attitudes towards the choice of location for postgraduate training as well as ultimate practice location. The authors gave a cross-sectional, self-administered questionnaire to 360 students; 314 (87%) responded. The majority of the students expressed a desire to do their internships and postgraduate training in a metropolitan hospital. To identify the students' attitudes that might have influenced their choices, factor analysis was carried out. The \"education and training\" factor accounted for the highest percentage of the variance observed. As in most other similar studies, a strong relationship was observed between a student's rural background and the student's subsequent intention to train and work in a rural area.\r"

The course covered the physical bases, scopes, and limitations of the most widely used diagnostic, therapeutic, and prosthetic technologies. The test was composed of both open-ended sequential questions and multiple-choice questions on the same material. The scores for the two testing modes were correlated, paying special attention to answers that demonstrated a flagrant lack of knowledge, corroborated by subsequent answers. The correlation between the qualities of the answers for the two testing modalities was found to be significantly positive for the lower half of the class of students and negative for the upper half, suggesting that the two modes of testing measure different aspects of competence. The implications of the findings to medical education and accreditation are discussed.\r"

In addition, they examined the consistency of classification of candidates and the perceived appropriateness of the number of candidates classified \"competent.\" The findings provide evidence of the validity of standard-setting procedures based on both the performance of criterion groups and the judgment of \"experts.\"\r"
